It was first published in 2008 and won the 40th Man Booker Prize in the same year. The novel provides a darkly humorous perspective of India's class struggle in a globalized world as told through a retrospective narration from Balram Halwai, a village boy. In detailing Balram's journey first to Delhi, where he works as a chauffeur to a rich landlord, and then to Bangalore, the place to which he flees after killing his master and stealing his money, the novel examines issues of religion, caste, loyalty, corruption and poverty in India. Ultimately, Balram transcends his sweet-maker caste and becomes a successful entrepreneur, establishing his own taxi service. In a nation proudly shedding a history of poverty and underdevelopment, he represents, as he himself says, \\"tomorrow.\\" The novel has been well-received, making the New York Times bestseller list in addition to winning the Man Booker Prize. Aravind Adiga, 33 at the time, was the second youngest writer as well as the fourth debut writer to win the prize in 2008. Adiga says his novel \\"attempt[s] to catch the voice of the men you meet as you travel through India — the voice of the colossal underclass.\\" According to Adiga, the exigence for The White Tiger was to capture the unspoken voice of people from \\"the Darkness\\" – the impoverished areas of rural India, and he \\"wanted to do so without sentimentality or portraying them as mirthless humorless weaklings as they are usually.\\" ==Plot summary== Balram Halwai narrates his life in a letter, written in seven consecutive nights and addressed to the Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao. In his letter, Balram explains how he, the son of a puller, escaped a life of servitude to become a successful businessman, describing himself as an entrepreneur. Balram was born in a rural village in Gaya district, where he lived with his grandmother, parents, brother and extended family. He is a smart child but is forced to leave school in order to help pay for his cousin's dowry and begins to work in a teashop with his brother in Dhanbad. While working there he begins to learn about India's government and economy from the customers' conversations. Balram describes himself as a bad servant but a good listener and decides to become a driver. After learning how to drive, Balram finds a job driving Ashok, the son of one of Laxmangarh's landlords. He takes over the job of the main driver, from a small car to a heavy-luxury described Honda City. He stops sending money back to his family and disrespects his grandmother during a trip back to his village. Balram moves to New Delhi with Ashok and his wife Pinky Madam. Throughout their time in Delhi, Balram is exposed to extensive corruption, especially in the government. In Delhi, the contrast between the poor and the wealthy is made even more evident by their proximity to one another. One night Pinky Madam takes the wheel from Balram, while drunk, hits something in the road and drives away; we are left to assume that she has killed a child. Ashok's family puts pressure on Balram to confess that he had been driving alone. Ashok becomes increasingly involved in bribing government officials for the benefit of the family coal business. Balram then decides that killing Ashok will be the only way to escape India's Rooster Coop – Balram's metaphor for describing the oppression of India's poor, just as roosters in a coop at the market watch themselves get slaughtered one by one, but are unable or unwilling to break out of the cage. Similarly, Ashok too is portrayed as being trapped in the metaphorical Rooster Coop: his family controls what he does and society dictates how he acts. After bludgeoning Ashok with a bottle and stealing a large bribe, Balram moves to Bangalore, where he bribes the police in order to help start his own taxi business. Just like Ashok, Balram pays off a family whose son one of his taxi drivers hit and killed. Balram explains that his own family was almost certainly killed by Ashok's relatives as retribution for his murder. At the end of the novel, Balram rationalizes his actions and considers that his freedom is worth the lives of his family and of Ashok. And thus ends the letter to Jiabao, letting the reader think of the dark humour of the tale, as well as the idea of life as a trap introduced by the writer. ==ThemesGlobalization=== The White Tiger takes place in a time in which increased technology has led to world globalization, and India is no exception. In the past decade, India has had one of the fastest booming economies. Specifically Americanization in India has played its role in the plot, since it provides an outlet for Balram to alter his caste. To satisfy Pinky's want for American culture, Ashok, Pinky, and Balram simply move to Gurugram, New Delhi instead of going to back to America. Globalization has assisted in the creation of an American atmosphere in India. Ashok justifies this move by explaining \\"Today it’s the modernest suburb of Delhi. American Express, Microsoft, all the big American companies have offices there. The main road is full of shopping malls—each mall has a cinema inside! So if Pinky Madam missed America, this was the best place to bring her\\". By blackmailing Ram Persad, the other driver, Balram is promoted and drives Ashok and Pinky to their new home. Ashok is even convinced India is surpassing the US, \\"There are so many more things I could do here than in New York now...The way things are changing in India now, this place is going to be like America in ten years\\". Balram is noticing the rapid growth as well. From the beginning of his story he knows that in order to rise above his caste he should become an entrepreneur. Although his taxi service is not an international business, Balram plans to keep up with the pace of globalization and change his trade when need be. \\"I‘m always a man who sees ‘tomorrow’ when others see ‘today.’\\" Balram's recognition of the increasing competition resulting from globalization contributes to his corruption. ===Individualism=== Throughout the book, there are references to how Balram is very different from those back in his home environment. He is referred to as the \\"white tiger\\" (which also happens to be the title of the book). A white tiger symbolizes power in East Asian cultures, such as in Vietnam. It is also a symbol for freedom and individuality. Balram is seen as different from those he grew up with. He is the one who got out of the \\"Darkness\\" and found his way into the \\"Light\\". ===Freedom=== In an interview with Aravind Adiga, he talked about how \\"The White Tiger\\" was a book about a man's quest for freedom. Balram, the protagonist in the novel, worked his way out of his low social caste (often referred to as \\"the Darkness\\") and overcame the social obstacles that limited his family in the past. Climbing up the social ladder, Balram sheds the weights and limits of his past and overcomes the social obstacles that keep him from living life to the fullest that he can. In the book, Balram talks about how he was in a rooster coop and how he broke free from his coop. The novel is somewhat a memory of his journey to finding his freedom in India's modern day capitalist society. Towards the beginning of the novel, Balram cites a poem from the Muslim poet Iqbal where he talks about slaves and says \\"They remain slaves because they can’t see what is beautiful in this world.\\" Balram sees himself embodying the poem and being the one who sees the world and takes it as he rises through the ranks of society, and in doing so finding his freedom. ===Social class/caste=== The book shows a modern day, capitalist Indian society with free market and free business. It also shows how it can create economic division. In India there are social classes and social castes. The novel portrays India's society as very negative towards the lower social caste. The novel is based on the disparities of two worlds: darkness, inhabited by poor and underprivileged who cannot even meet their bare minimums; and the lighted world, inhabited by zamindars, politicians, businessmen etc. who shamelessly exploits the ones from darkness, making them even more poor and grows their own grandeur. Balram refers to it as the \\"Darkness\\". When Balram was asked which caste he was from, he knew that it could ultimately cause a biased stance in his employer and determine the future of his employment. There is definitely a big difference seen in Balram's lower caste from back home and his current higher caste in their lifestyles, habits, and standards of living. This novel is showing how our economic system today creates socioeconomic discrimination that create a big division in society. It limits opportunity, social mobility, health, and other rights and pleasures that should be given to all. There is a big difference in the amount of money spread around in society today and this book is alluding to that fact. === Critical Analysis === Aravind Adiga's White Tiger tells the story of Balram Halwai. Born in India's overarching darkness of perpetual servanthood and poverty, Balram seeks a life in the light—a life of freedom and financial prosperity. Balram, a man of many names and of strong conviction, is one of the few who are able to escape the Darkness. Unlike the majority of the poor in India, eternally pent up in the Coop, he is willing to sacrifice his family for his own self gain. His ambition and inner drive propels him to commit murder to achieve freedom. To be one's own man, one must break free from the darkness and live life being able to choose his own path. When Balram says, “All I wanted was the chance to be a man—and for that, one murder was enough,” he is technically correct. While murdering Ashok will result in the resultant murder of his family, the one murder alone is enough to break free from the Darkness. By murdering Ashok, therefore, Balram becomes his own man, free of the chains of servitude and finally able to control his own destiny. According to Balram, there are two different types of people in India. There are those in the light—politicians, businessmen, entrepreneurs, to name a few, who prosper financially and sit at the top of society—and there are those in the Darkness, trapped in lives of poverty and subservience. He explains, “Please understand, Your Excellency, that India is two countries in one: an India of Light, and an India of Darkness” (12). To explain this division he uses the metaphor of the Coop: “Go to Old Delhi… Hundred of pale hens and brightly colored roosters, stuffed tightly into wire-mesh cages… They know they are next, yet they cannot rebel. They do not try to get out of the coop. The very same thing is done with humans in this country” (147). The Coop represents life in the Darkness: a life where the “roosters,” or people, cannot choose their own fate, where they live in poverty, where they see their family decimated around them and are unable to intervene, and in which they inevitably will live and die without ever the possibility of escape. Balram's family is in the Darkness. While they are supposed to be sweetmakers, or Halweis, they live in poverty. His father works tenuously as a rickshaw puller, and his brother works in the local tea shop. Balram's father implants in him early on this idea of breaking away from the Darkness, and of becoming his own man. He instates in Balram the goal of becoming one of those men who are in the light. He says, “My whole life, I have been treated like a donkey. All I want is that one son of mine—at least one—should live like a man” (26). In the eyes of Balram's father, a man should live in the light, free from the grueling life of manual labor and servitude. Balram adopts this goal, and devotes his life towards attaining it. Later, Balram uses the metaphor: “There are just two castes: Men with Big Bellies, and Men with Small Bellies. And only two destinies: eat—or get eaten up” (54). Balram has a big belly, filled with the lust of freedom and of riches—the same belly which will eventually propel him to murder Ashok and give up his family for the sake of becoming a man. In his childhood, Balram recognizes that he is special. When an official comes to evaluate his school, he singles out Balram because he is the only one who can read and write. He sees great potential in the boy: “You, young man, are an intelligent, honest, vivacious fellow in this crowd of thugs and idiots… You need to go to a real school” (30). The rest of the students are cast into the lowly group of “thugs and idiots, because they will forever remain in the darkness. They do not have the ambition, drive or intelligence that is needed to escape—the same characteristics which the inspector sees in Balram. The inspector knows that Balram exceeds everyone else within the “jungle” of his lowly school and town. He says, “In any jungle, what is the rarest of animals – the creature that comes along only once in a generation? The white tiger” (30). Balram calls himself White Tiger permanently after this event. He fully takes on and embodies the life of a white tiger. In Balram's opinion, “[Slaves] remain slaves because they can’t see what is beautiful in this world” (34). A “white tiger” can never be a slave, because it can see and pursue beauty. “Beauty,” in this case, is the life of financial prosperity and freedom of choice that Balram yearns for. Amidst the other animals in the darkness, amidst the other children in his school and the rest of India trapped in lives of Darkness, all who are unable to see beauty, and who carry with them small bellies, Balram, the “White Tiger,” knows that he must escape any means possible. Balram only faints twice in his life. Each time he faints it is because he realizes that the Darkness is inescapable without some form of resistance. He first faints when he sees his mother's dead body around the Ganges: “Soon she would become part of the black mound… And then I understood: this was the real god of Benaras—this black mud of the Ganga into which everything died, and decomposed, and was reborn from, and died into again. The same would happen to me when I died and they brought me here. Nothing would get liberated here” (15). Balram cannot fathom the prospect of forever remaining in the Darkness. He sees the overwhelming power that being in the Darkness has on the ones in it: that when surrounded by others marked by a lack of ambition, leading lives of destitute servitude, unable to choose the paths of their own lives, one inevitably surrenders to that same life. Balram faints thinking that this could happen to him. Balram faints for a second time when he goes to the zoo. He sees the White Tiger trapped in the cage and realizes that he sees himself: “[The tiger] was hypnotizing himself by walking like this - that was the way he could tolerate this cage” (237). Balram's current predicament of servitude serves as his own cage. Balram was “hypnotizing himself” by buying into his life of servitude. He wholeheartedly embraced his master, with whom he treated with great love, to distract himself from the fact that he was living in a life that he and his father wanted so desperately for him to break free of. “All at once, the tiger vanished” (237). When Balram sees himself in that cage, he has an epiphany. Up to this point, he had never seriously considered rebelling against or killing Ashok. But the tiger vanishes from the cage because, at that moment, the caged version of Balram ceased to exist. A changed man, he realizes that he must kill Ashok to become his own man and enter into a life of Light. After this epiphany, Balram quickly and deliberately frees himself from the Darkness by killing Ashok. Despite the fact that his family may be murdered, Balram commits this act because it will transport him to the life he has dreamed of and therefore make him a man. Balram has so much disdain for him family, since he sees the harsh ways by which they drain the life out of his father, that they no longer remain a relevant part of his life. Therefore, he is justified in sacrificing them, at least in his eyes. His epiphany at the zoo puts in context that life is not worth living if it is lived in the Darkness. After killing Ashok with the glass shards of a broken liquor bottle, he says, “I’ve made it! I’ve broken out of the coop!” (275). In this India of Light and Darkness, Balram is now in the light. By resisting the life of Darkness and by killing Ashok, he now leads a life in which he can choose his own fate. The difference between “this India,” Laxmangarh, and “that India,” Bangalore, is that in “this India” Balram is a free independent man who can finally control his own destiny (262). The chandelier embodies Balram's transformation into a man. Literally, it represents the materialistic success which he has encountered in his entrepreneurial ventures as an independent businessman. Figuratively, it sheds light on him, amidst the Darkness still prevalent in the everyday life of India. It represents Balram's escape from the presence of Darkness which used to dominate his life. By killing Ashok, Balram becomes his own man, freeing himself from servitude and entering a life of independence. === Quotes === I put my hand out and wiped the vomit from his lips, and cooed soothing words to him. It squeezed my heart to see him suffer like this - but where my genuine concern for him ended and where my self-interest began, I could not tell: no servant can ever tell what the motives of his heart are. Do we loathe our masters behind a facade of love - or do we love them behind a facade of loathing? We are made mysteries to ourselves by the Rooster Coop we are locked in. ==Film adaptation== On April 5, 2018, Ramin Bahrani was set to direct and write the adaptation of The White Tiger for Netflix. On September 3, 2019, Rajkummar Rao, Priyanka Chopra, and Adarsh Gourav were cast in the film. ==References * Aravind Adiga Official website * Adam Lively, Review in The Sunday Times * David Mattin, Review in The Independent * Sanjay Subrahmanyam, Review in the London Review of Books * Interview with Aravind Adiga in Rediff * Analysis of the novel at Let's talk about Bollywood *The White Tiger – uRead.com * Roy, Pinaki. \\"Inside Tiger's Jaws: Rereading Aravind Adiga's The White Tiger\\".

Other recorded vernacular names for the plant are small green protea or scoly. In the Afrikaans language it is known by the name of kleingroenroos, or alternatively witskollie. ==Taxonomy== Protea scolymocephala was first described by Linnaeus as Leucadendron scolymocephalum, but moved to the genus Protea by Johann Jacob Reichard in 1779 or 1780. ==Description== It is a small, erect shrub between 0.5 and 1.5 metres in height. It has a single main stem, which branches into a large number of secondary stems. The leaves are linear-spatulate and curve upwards. The inflorescence is yellowish green and relatively small, some 3.5 - 4.5 cm in diameter. The species flowers in Spring, between June or July to November, with the peak in early Spring, between August to September. This species is monoecious with both sexes in each flower. The fruits are persistent, which means they are retained on the plant after drying. The seeds stored within the fire-resistant, dried fruit, and when released after fires are dispersed by means of wind. Individual plants generally have a generational length of some 20 years. ==Distribution== P. scolymocephala is endemic to the Western Cape province of South Africa, where it is found from approximately the Olifants River and the Gifberg in the north, through Cape Town, to Hermanus in the east, and from Kleinmond to Hawston in the west. It grows on the Slangkop headland on the Cape Peninsula. ==Gallery== File:Protea scolymocephala 1DS-II 2-3824.jpgProtea scolymocephala cultivated at Paarlberg Nature Reserve, Paarl, Western Cape, South Africa File:Protea scolymocephala 1.jpghabitus of plant cultivated at the University of California Botanical Garden in Berkeley File:Protea scolymocephala kz2.jpghabitus at Auckland Botanic Gardens, New Zealand File:Protea scolymocephala.jpgdeveloping inflorescence at the University of California Botanical Garden File:Protea scolymocephala 1DS-II 3-5534.jpgleaves and flowerheads at the Caledon Wild Flower Show in Caledon, Western Cape ==Ecology== It grows in sandy flats (sandveld) and coastal lowlands, and is often found growing near drainage lines. It is found from altitudes of 0 to 400 metres. The mature plants are usually completely killed by wildfires, but the seeds can survive such events within the fire-resistant inflorescences. It is pollinated by birds and rodents. The roots are eaten by mole rats. ==Conservation== In 1998 it was said to be largely extirpated in the southern part of its range, but still locally common in the north. The status of the population of this species was first assessed as 'vulnerable' by the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) in 2005. In the 2019 SANBI assessment the authors state that the population is decreasing and that the situation of the population is such that its status might require upgrading to that of 'endangered' in the near future, should current trends in the northern part of its range continue. Its range has decreased by some 40% over the last sixty years. Over the sixty year time period, the range has furthermore been decreased by urban expansion, agriculture, invasive vegetation, too frequent wildfires, groundwater extraction and increased mole rat activity. The expansion of rooibos tea plantations and arable land for the production of potatoes are specific present-day threats causing habitat loss in the northern part of this species' range, and likely are the greatest threats to its survival. Other possible problems identified as threats to the survival of this species are direct effects from invasive species, over- harvesting due to gathering of plant (parts), habitat loss, habitat degradation and other intrinsic factors such as changes in native species dynamics. ==References * scolymocephala Category:Flora of the Cape Provinces ","title":"Protea scolymocephala"},{"id":"19248237","text":"The Grosser Diamantstock is a mountain of the Bernese Alps, located west of Handegg in the Bernese Oberland.

The prison, which opened in 1889, is a facility of the Michigan Department of Corrections that holds about 1,100 inmates in maximum and minimum-security housing. The inmate population consists of adult males, aged eighteen and older. The prison was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as State House of Correction and Branch Prison on November 23, 1977. MBP was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in order to maintain its original buildings. MBP has become one of the state's most outstanding tourist attractions because of the beautiful flower gardens and other landscaping around the prison grounds. MBP was a prison full of attempted escapes, bloodshed, and reconstruction during the 19th century. The first outdoor game to feature an official NHL team was held on February 2, 1954. The Detroit Red Wings played an exhibition game on an outdoor ice surface, in degree weather, against inmates at Marquette Branch Prison. After the first period the Red Wings led in the game 18–0; the rest of the game the score was not kept. ==Origin== During the late 19th century the population in the Upper Peninsula quickly grew as did the number of criminal convictions. Lower Michigan prisons (Ionia and Jackson) were becoming overpopulated and the cost of moving prisoners from the Upper Peninsula to the Lower Peninsula prisons was becoming expensive. Talk of building a prison in the Upper Peninsula began. The Business Men's Association of Marquette, Michigan argued that Marquette provided a \\"centrally located community with excellent transportation and water facilities as well as the natural resources required to build the prison.\\" The Michigan legislature appropriated $150,000 to fund the proposed prison. The prison board of commissioners approved the site for the Marquette Branch Prison. A total of ten companies submitted bids for the prison. The lowest bid ($135,817.00) belonged to Wahlman and Grip of Ishpeming and they were given the contract. The first buildings included an administration building, east and west cell block wings connected by a rotunda, a dining hall, a hospital, and a power house. Construction began with the rotunda and west wing in July 1886 and all buildings were completed by June 22, 1889. ==Historic Buildings== Marquette Branch Prison Marquette MI 1912 The original 1889 complex included the Administration Building, Rotunda, Cell Block A, and Cell Block B. Cell Block A was demolished in 1971, but the other buildings still remain. These buildings, designed by William Scott and Company of Detroit, form an imposing Richardsonian Romanesque complex constructed of local sandstone, with a contrasting red sandstone used for the stringcourses, cornices, window surrounds, arches, and tower battlements. The Administration Building is a three-story structure measuring 112 feet by 56 feet, with a hipped roof. A central square tower which extends to a height of 88 feet, and contains a massive 10-foot wide Syrian entryway arch. The corners of the building contain octagonal bays topped by a pointed spire. Between the octagonal bays and the central tower are two wall dormers which project above the eave line. Round-arch windows are located on each story. Behind the Administration Building, a corridor leads to the Rotunda, a semi-octagonal three-story structure topped with a cupola. 75 by 75 foot Rotunda. Two styles of arched windows are used on the rotunda. When it was constructed, the roof of the Rotunda was the largest and heaviest in the Upper Peninsula, and the original supporting timber and trusswork are still intact. Connected to the Rotunda is the one-story rectangular Cell Block B, which has arched windows along the sides and is five small cupolas used as air vents along the top. In addition to the 1889 buildings, the prison complex includes a wing of 1923 cell blocks (blocks C, D, E, and F), a separate additive service building, a 1938 school, and a 1955 cell block extension. The 1971 Brooks Center Hospital adjoins the Rotunda, and stands where the original Cell Block A was located. ==1800s== Governor Cyrus G. Luce appointed Orison C. Tompkins as the first warden. The selection angered many people in the Upper Peninsula because Tompkins was from the Lower Peninsula. Tompkins' first action was to get inmate tradesmen from the prison in Jackson, Michigan so they could start construction of additional buildings. The first three prisoners, William Durno, Horace Becker, and Gust Peterson, were transferred from the prison at Jackson on June 22, 1889. Early prisoners provided an array of nationalities. Convict #4, Alphonse Hetu, was a French-Canadian; convict #5, Paddy Brennan, was from Ireland; and convict #6, Mattis Walli, was born in Finland and sentenced from New York. Women were also sentenced to MBP at this time and their work was in the kitchen, laundry room, hospital, and hosiery mill. In 1893, women were no longer sentenced to MBP but to the Detroit House of Corrections. ==1900sWarden Catlin's murder=== In 1921 the sixth warden of MBP, Theodore Burr Catlin, was appointed. Soon after his appointment a grand jury began investigating the prison. The chief clerk was found guilty of embezzling prison funds. Then, September brought the escapes of three prisoners. First was Arthur \\"Gypsy Bob\\" Harper who escaped by hopping the fence. This was the first escape in seventeen years. Ten days later, two other convicts escaped over the same fence by using a ladder they had made from scrap lumber found in the prison yard that was being used during construction of additional cell blocks. All three convicts were caught and returned to MBP. This was not the end of \\"Gypsy Bob's\\" trouble-making. On December 11, 1921, along with two other convicts (Jasper Perry and Charles Roberts), Gypsy Bob attacked Warden Catlin, Deputy Fred Menhennett, the deputy's son Arthur, and prison guard Charles Anderson in the prison movie theatre. The three convicts were armed with knives. They stabbed their four unsuspecting victims numerous times. The movie theatre was in total chaos, yet surprisingly, no other inmates got involved in the attacks. The main target of the three attackers was Warden Catlin who managed to close himself in a room until other prison guards were able to restore order and detain the three attackers. All four victims eventually died from complications caused by their knife wounds. The attackers were flogged on three occasions. On Monday December 12, 1921 Harper and Perry received 30 lashes each and Roberts received 25 lashes. Then Perry and Roberts each received 25 more lashes each on Tuesday and Wednesday. Harper was not flogged because he was acting insane (smashing his head on the floor) and eventually put in a straitjacket to avoid other personal harm. The punishment of flogging was approved by the governor in certain cases such as this. The murder case was eventually dismissed because the flogging had served as their punishment. They could not be legally punished again because that would be considered \\"double jeopardy\\" so the state of Michigan no longer had a case against Harper, Perry, and Roberts. The three remained at MBP to serve out their life sentences with no further punishment. After the death of Warden Catlin, a prisoner was quoted as saying, \\"Warden Catlin was a man of intense courage. He was fair and just to everyone and compromised on nothing. Punishment was meted out when deserved, and encouragement when appropriate. He was everything a prison warden should be.\\" ===Escape attempts=== In March 1922, five inmates attempted to escape through the roof of the west wing. They were successful, but were recaptured by prison officials soon after their escape. In May, \\"Slippery Jim\\" Cushway and two other inmates escaped while at work. The three escaped in a car that Leo Carney stole from a place near where he worked and picked up the other two on the way to Milwaukee. Cushway had escaped numerous times from prison. Many other escapes were successful in the 1920s. In April 1923, two fugitives, Steve Madaja and Russell Smith, escaped through the roof of the west wing and were never retrieved. On June 21, two inmates working at the prison lumber yard were found missing. George Bloochas and George Natchoff had escaped; Natchoff had stolen a .45 caliber automatic and about 40 rounds of ammunition. The hunt began for these two fugitives. Bloochas was captured first and he warned the police of the danger of Natchoff because of the weapon he possessed. During days of swamp battle, Natchoff shot many rounds, killing one deputy, Frank Curran, and injuring another. Eventually they killed Natchoff, who had a total of 14 bullet holes in his body. These escapes represent a few of many escapes that occurred during the 1920s at MBP. Also in the 1920s additional cell blocks were constructed as well as new boilers and a new dining hall that could seat around 500 inmates. ===Dr. Hornbogen's murder=== On August 27, 1931, three convicts (Andrew Germano, Charles Rosbury, Martin Duver) from Detroit opened fire in the hospital. The three first shot Doctor A.W. Hornbogen and then proceeded to the second level of an old factory and barricaded themselves. Exchange of fire continued for two hours. At one point a white flag was waived and a bottle with a note attached was thrown at the warden. The note read, \\"We have a bottle of explosives that will wreck this place, unless you give us a car and open the gates.\\" The warden responded with \\"Start shooting again, boys!\\" Tear bombs were eventually used and the three mobsters killed themselves as they realized that their capture was inevitable. The mobsters' motive seemed to be revenge on Dr. Hornbogen for the death of their friend, Fred Begeman, who had died of heart disease and kidney trouble under Dr. Hornbogen's watch. The three intended to escape, but their plan failed and the fatality list consisted of Dr. Hornbogen, Frank Oligschlager (trustee shot trying to help the doctor), Andrew Germano (convict), Charles Rosbury (convict), Martin Duver (convict), Frank Hohfer (convict who was armed but never engaged in the shoot- out and killed himself after his other three confederates killed themselves). This attempted escape caught national headlines, including The New York Times. ===G. Mennen Williams prison incident=== On July 8, 1950, G. Mennen Williams, the Governor of Michigan, was attacked and briefly held hostage while visiting the prison, as part of an inmate escape plot. ==2000s== There are six level-V housing units surrounded by a twenty-foot stone wall and 10 feet of metal fencing. These units consist of single-prisoner cells and have a capacity of 546. The perimeter of the maximum security section is monitored by eight gun towers. Five of the eight towers have the capability to monitor activity inside the housing units. There are four housing units for level-I inmates. This section consists of four dormitories, O Dorm, A Dorm, N Dorm, and P Dorm. \\"Both A and N Dorms have full-size gymnasiums and classrooms in them while O and P Dorms have large recreational dayrooms. All level-I housing units are double bunked. The capacity of the level-I housing units is 670.\\" The Brooks Medical Center is an inpatient health care facility and outpatient clinic. There are more than 30 staff at the medical center, one doctor, two dentists, a dozen nurses, and several other support staff. There are two full service kitchens at MBP, a dairy farm, and a heating and power plant.Dahl, Nicole. \\"Facility Description.\\" 2008. Programming at MBP currently consists of prisoner work assignments, psychological services, library services (MBP has one main law library and four other mini law libraries), a large volunteer program, religious, as well as recreation and educational programs.

Unwanted Cinema features Henry Koster, Felix Jackson, Joe Pasternak, Otto Wallburg, Hans Jaray, Franziska Gaal, Rosy Rarsony, Hortense Raky, Oskar Pilzer, Zolan Vidor, Ernst Verebes. The documentary shares clips from their films and interviews with their family. ==Synopsis== On his American debut, director Henry Koster stood in the lobby waiting to see if the audience would laugh at his film. If they laughed, he knew he could make a career for himself. If they didn't, he'd have to return to Europe, where he could be killed by the Nazis. The audience laughed uncontrollably. Unwanted Cinema profiles Koster and other Jews who were involved in the movie business before and during World War II, as they struggled to preserve both their careers and their lives. Until the dawn of Hitler, Jewish actors and producers throughout Europe enjoyed critical acclaim and stardom. But once anti-Semitism began to spread, it threatened not only their celebrity but also their lives. Filmmakers and actors moved to Vienna and Budapest where their “unwanted cinema” was produced independently. Later, in hopes of escaping war-torn Europe, many Jews involved in cinema traveled to Hollywood to test their skills and their luck. The documentary points to both the cruelty and irony of anti-Semitism. Talent that was “unwanted” in Europe because of prejudice was celebrated on the other side of the ocean. The charming clips interspersed throughout the documentary prove the injustice of rejecting Jewish talent. One Hundred Men and a Girl, which was nominated for five Oscars, is just one example of the exceptional films that these refugees were responsible for. ==See also== *Louis B.

Written and directed by Jim Hanon (Beyond the Gates of Splendor, End of the Spear), and produced by Mart Green, the film explores the international collision of HIV/AIDS policies while following the journey of two HIV-positive women who enter a pageant in Botswana. What is happening in Botswana, where half of all pregnant women are HIV positive, is set contrasted with the past successes of Uganda, which has experienced one of the largest reductions in HIV infections ever recorded. == Inspiration == According to Hanon, HIV/AIDS is an almost unimaginable tragedy that everyone acknowledges at some level; but Hanon believes it is largely compartmentalized by those Westerners who have no direct experience with the disease. Hanon wanted to find out why, unlike previous pandemics, people are still dying of a preventable disease. He traveled to the International AIDS Conference in Toronto and found that answering that question meant addressing the issue of controlling sexual behaviors and moral judgement, which is already a point of conflict between many church and homosexual communities. Controlling sex also raises issues of women's rights in parts of the world where women are not able to refuse their partners. Producer Mart Green had read a book by Dr. Edward C. Green, which shared the success of the Uganda ABC program (Abstinence, be faithful, use a condom) and how this program is under attack from AIDS activists. Questions emerged about sex, human rights, and ideology. Hanon felt that the Miss HIV pageant in Botswana was a place to explore these questions. == Individuals featured == * Elizabeth Romolale - HIV Positive contestant * Gaelebale Thabang - HIV Positive contestant * Bill Gates * Melinda Gates * Bill Clinton * Dr. Edward C. Green * Dr. Norman Hearst * Martin Ssempa == Filming == Miss HIV was filmed on location across sub-Saharan Africa and at the International AIDS Conference in Toronto with Bill and Melinda Gates and former President Bill Clinton.

VP-8 is tasked to undertake maritime patrol, anti-submarine warfare (ASW), and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. The Squadron is equipped with the Boeing P-8A Poseidon. The squadron was originally established as Patrol Squadron 201 (VP-201) on 1 September 1942, redesignated Patrol Bombing Squadron 201 (VPB-201) on 1 October 1944, redesignated Patrol Squadron 201 (VP-201) on 15 May 1946, redesignated Patrol Squadron, Medium Seaplane 1 (VP- MS-1) on 15 November 1946, redesignated Patrol Squadron, Medium Landplane 8 (VP-ML-8) on 5 June 1947 and redesignated Patrol Squadron 8 (VP-8) on 1 September 1948. It is the second squadron to be designated VP-8, the first VP-8 was redesignated VP-24 on 1 July 1939. ==Operational historyWorld War II=== NAS Banana River in 1942 U-134 under attack by VP-201, 1943 VP-201 was established at NAS Norfolk, Virginia on 1 September 1942, under the operational command of FAW5, flying PBM-3 Mariner seaplanes. The squadron was sent on 6 October 1942 to NAS Banana River, Florida, where most of the operational unit training was undertaken. The squadron received its own new PBM-3C aircraft on 1 December 1942. On 6 February 1943 VP-201 returned to its home port at NAS Norfolk. Flight crew training continued concurrently with patrol operations along the Atlantic seaboard as a part of Task Force 28 in the Eastern Sea Frontier. On 27 May 1943 the squadron's PBM-3C aircraft were replaced by the newer PBM-3S with improved radar. After refitting, a six- aircraft detachment deployed to NAS Bermuda. Patrols were flown ranging out to , lasting 12 to 18 hours. Convoys to and from Europe were covered in a radius of from Bermuda. On 9 July 1943 Lieutenant Soverel and crew attacked U-134 off Bermuda, the submarine, caught on the surface, manned its potent anti-aircraft (AA) defenses and heavily damaged the PBM-3S, forcing it to return to base. As a result of this encounter, subsequent patrols were made in pairs of aircraft. On 30 July 1943 VP-201 held a change of command at NAS Norfolk, the former commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander M. H. Tuttle, and half of the squadron personnel and assets were transferred to form the cadre of a new PB4Y-1 Liberator squadron, VB-111, the remainder of the squadron and its newly assigned personnel were transferred the next week to a new home port at NAS Bermuda under the administrative control of the Commander Bermuda Air Group. An intensive period of training ensued. On 8 June 1944 VP-201 was transferred back to its original home port at NAS Norfolk under the administrative control of FAW-5, and assigned duties involving regular flights between Bermuda and Norfolk carrying supplies and personnel. On 12 June the squadron deployed to NAS Key West, Florida, under the operational control of FAW-12 for a two-week period of Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) refresher training. On 12 July VP-201 deployed to NAS Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone, under the operational control of FAW-3 under the Commander Panama Sea Frontier. Upon completion of the deployment, the squadron was reassigned to a new home port at NAS Key West under control of FAW-12, on 27 July 1944. From 1 November half of the squadron's PBM-3S aircraft were outfitted with L-8C Leigh searchlights at NAS Key West. After training in use of the new British-designed equipment, the squadron was assigned routine operational flights involving ASW patrols and convoy escort. From 1 April 1945 squadron flight crews were divided into three sections and sent in rotation to Harvey Point, North Carolina, to pick up replacement aircraft, the PBM-5. Familiarization training on the new seaplanes was conducted at Harvey Point before sending the section back to NAS Key West. On 29 May VPB-201 was transferred to a new home port at NAS Coco Solo, under the operational control of FAW-3. The squadron engaged in ASW, searchlight tactics, gunnery, bombing, and instrument training flights. Following the end of World War II, the squadron's aircraft inventory was reduced from 15 to 9 and it also experienced a reduction in personnel due to the postwar demobilization. {   width=99% ! width=\\"33%\\"  Deployment Duration ! align=\\"center\\"  Wing ! align=\\"center\\"  Base ! align=\\"center\\"  Aircraft ! align=\\"center\\"  Operating Area -  May 2, 1943 – June 1944  FAW-5  Bermuda  PBM-3S  Atlantic -  July 12, 1944 – July 27, 1944  FAW-3  Panama  PBM-3S  Caribbean - } ===Cold War=== 1946–1949 P2V-3 in 1949.

The squadron was supported by during the relocation from Panama to Puerto Rico. Upon arrival, a detachment of three aircraft was sent to NAS Trinidad to serve as part of the Air Sea Rescue Task Unit. In December 1947 VP-ML-8 received its first contingent of replacement aircraft, the new P2V-2 Neptune. The squadron, home ported at NAS Norfolk, was under the control of FAW-5. A period of transition training commenced for the switch from seaplanes to landplanes. On 1 March 1949 VP-8 deployed to NAS Argentia, Newfoundland. The primary emphasis during this tour of duty was the testing of the P2V aircraft in cold weather conditions, flying in temperatures as low as -55 °F.

The squadron flew 450 surveillance missions in support of counter-narcotic operations in the Caribbean area of responsibility (AOR), resulting in 13 arrests and the seizure of 11 metric tons of illegal drugs worth US$171.4 million. Search and rescue efforts in the region accounted for 14 saved lives. Operating in a split deployment to NAS Roosevelt Roads from August 2001 to February 2002, VP-8 was active in counter-drug operations in the Caribbean, working with the Coast Guard and U.S. Customs, which interdicted or disrupted $7.6 billion in illegal drugs, including over 28,000 kg of cocaine. From NAF Keflavik, the squadron participated in NATO exercises, as well as undertaking new operational tasks involving homeland defense and Operation Enduring Freedom. Operation Iraqi Freedom VP-8 - Operation Iraqi Freedom From February to August 2003, VP-8 deployed to NAF Sigonella and Souda Bay, Crete, to provide 24-hour P-3 support for the two carrier battle groups in the Mediterranean during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), flying nearly 100 overland combat missions and over 4,000 flight hours from Italy, Greece, Germany, Spain, and Senegal. This split-site deployment also included support to Operation Joint Guardian, Operation Deliberate Forge, Operation Enduring Freedom, and NATO Joint Command Lisbon. Its second OIF deployment, starting December 2006, involved VP-8 operation out of Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar as part of Task Group 57.2, a maritime patrol and reconnaissance organization consisting of 22 aircrews and 21 aircraft. Operation Unified Assistance During its Western Pacific deployment to Misawa Air Base and Kadena Air Base, VP-8 participated in the U.S. military response to the aftermath of 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake (Operation Unified Assistance), sending the first U.S. military aircraft on station to the disaster area from to Utaphao, Thailand, and Diego Garcia, as well as flying Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HADR) missions to the affected region. P-8A Poseidon Transition In July 2014 VP-8 started the transition from the P-3C to the P-8A Poseidon. In March 2016, VP-8 began the squadron inaugural deployment of its P-8A Poseidon with a six-month deployment to Kadena AFB, Japan. Japanese F-35 Crash On 9 April 2019, VP-8 P-8A Poseidon's operating out of Misawa AB assist in the search of a Japan Air Self-Defense Force F-35A and its pilot, that crashed off the coast of Japan. ==Awards & Commendations== A P-8A of VP-8 takes off from Kadena Air Base, 29 November 2017. *Joint Meritorious Unit Award – 1990, 1991 *Navy Unit Commendation - 1978, 1983, 1991, 2003 *Meritorious Unit Commendation - 1970, 1971, 1977, 1979, 1983, 1986, 1997 *Navy Expeditionary Medal - 1983 *Coast Guard Unit Commendation - 1985 *Southwest Asia Service Medal - 1991 *Navy \\"E\\" Ribbon - 1950, 1960, 1962, 1983, 1991, 1997, 2000, 2007, 2014 *CINCLANTFLT Golden Anchor Award - 1995, 2005 *Isbell Trophy - 1962, 1984, 1986, 1988, 1996 *U.S. Sixth Fleet \\"Hook 'em\\" Award - 1980, 1983, 1984, 1988, 1991 *Golden Wrench Award for Maintenance - 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 *U.S. Naval Excellence Officers to Mast Trophy - 2012 *Arleigh Burke Fleet Trophy - 2014 ==Aircraft assignments== The squadron was assigned the following aircraft, effective on the dates shown: *PBM-3 - September 1942 *PBM-3C - December 1942 *PBM-3S - May 1943 *PBM-5E - April 1945 *P2V-2 - December 1947 *P2V-3 - January 1949 *P2V-5F - July 1955 *P-3A - August 1962 *P-3B - December 1965 *P-3C UII - August 1981 *P-3C UII.5 - September 1985 *P-3C UIIIR - June 1994 *P-8A Poseidon - July 2014 ==Home port assignments== The squadron was assigned to these home ports, effective on the dates shown: *Naval Air Station Norfolk, Virginia - 1 September 1942 *NAS Banana River - 6 October 1942 *Naval Air Station Norfolk - 6 February 1943 *Naval Air Station Bermuda - August 1943 *Naval Air Station Norfolk - 8 June 1944 *Naval Air Station Key West, Florida - 27 July 1944 *Naval Air Station Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone - 29 May 1945 *Naval Station San Juan, Puerto Rico - 15 March 1946 *Naval Air Station Norfolk - December 1947 *Naval Air Station Quonset Point, Rhode Island - September 1948 *Naval Auxiliary Air Station Chincoteague, Virginia - April 1958 *Naval Air Station Norfolk - July 1959 *Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland - July 1961 *Naval Air Station Brunswick, Maine - July 1971 *Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida ==See also== * History of the United States Navy * List of United States Navy aircraft squadrons * List of squadrons in the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons * List of Lockheed P-3 Orion variants ==NotesSources== * * * ==External links== *Official Web Site – U.S. Navy *VP-8 Alumni Association *VP-8 – U.S. Navy Patrol Squadrons – VPNavy.org *Patrol Squadron Eight – Globalsecurity.org *VP-8 Unit Page – Military.com *VP-8 Web Page – Tiger-Lair.org *VP-8 Web Page – NATO Tiger Association Category:Patrol squadrons of the United States Navy Category:Military units and formations in Maine ","title":"VP-8"},{"id":"19248541","text":"The Ministry of Social Affairs () of Lebanon is part of the cabinet. ==History and functions== The ministry was created in 1993 by Law Number 212 and modified by Law Number 327 and Decree Number 5734.

The plot focuses on a group of boys aged 7-14 who survive a massacre in their village in Northern Italy in 1944 and what happens to them. The film was attacked by critics for its depiction of children learning about violence. Many critics felt that the film went to unnecessary lows. It failed at the box office and Rock Hudson moved into TV acting after this film. ==Plot== In Northern Italy in 1944, the entire population of the village of Reanoto is massacred by the SS under the command of the cruel Major Sturmbannführer Taussig for helping the Italian resistance movement. The only survivors are a group of young boys in ages from 7 to 14 led by Aldo, who witnessed the mass execution and vow revenge. That night, a detachment of US Army paratrooper saboteurs jump into the area with a mission to destroy a strategic dam with the partisans prior to the Fifth United States Army's advance into the area. Their drop zone has been discovered by Wehrmacht troops under the command of Hauptmann Friedrich von Hecht, who kill them all except the leader of the paratroopers, Captain Turner, who is rendered unconscious and goes unnoticed by the Germans when he lands in the branches of a tree. The Germans capture the demolition equipment from the dead Americans. Aldo and his friends rescue Turner by spiriting him away from the ambush. Realising that Turner needs medical attention, they kidnap German doctor Bianca Freedling, to nurse him to health, and keeping her captive even after Turner's recovery. In order to avenge the massacre of Reanoto, Aldo wants Turner to train him and his friends in the use of military weapons and tactics. Turner uses the opportunity as a second chance to complete his sabotage mission, using the boys instead of his late command. He has the boys steal the captured American demolition gear from von Hecht's headquarters, killing SS Rottenführer Gunther in the process, but Aldo hides the detonators until Turner leads them in their revenge. He trains them to use German MP40 guns. Turner and the doctor go to look at the dam. The doctor tries to stab Turner with a pair of scissors and then runs towards a passing German armoured car but Turner drags her into cover and rapes her. In response to the killing of Gunther, Standartenführer Jannings hunts for Turner and his \\"Dead End Kids\\" an SS-led affair, placing von Hecht under the command of Taussig and reassigning his regular Wehrmacht troops to guard a tunnel. Not long after this, Turner and the boys steal a truck and drive to SS headquarters, slaughtering all of Taussig's men in a surprise attack. Killing the SS was enough for most of the boys, but not for Aldo, who is becoming emotionally and mentally unhinged. He wants to keep killing Germans. Von Hecht, after an argument, shoots and kills Taussig in the aftermath of the attack on SS headquarters, and goes after Turner and the boys solo. While Turner and a few of the boys are planting Composition C charges on the dam, Aldo and a few of the others go against orders and directly engage the German guards on top of the dam, which very nearly costs the entire mission. Taking over an MG42, Aldo becomes blood-drunk as he mows down Germans, even going so far as to shoot down his own friend Carlo when Carlo blocks his shot. Despite interference from von Hecht, Turner and the kids successfully plant the explosives and blow up the dam, flooding the valley. With the dam destroyed and the Germans routed, the American troops begin moving in. When Turner learns of Carlo's death, as well as that of another boy who died protecting Bianca and some of the younger children, he regrets having involved the children and breaks all of the guns. Aldo however refuses to hand his over, and runs off, encountering von Hecht, who survived the destruction of the dam. Aldo shoots and wounds him just as Turner catches up to him, and after failing to talk him out of finishing the German officer off, prevents him by force, taking his gun away. He takes von Hecht prisoner as von Hecht expresses his admiration for Turner's success. Turner, Bianca, von Hecht and all of the surviving boys except for Aldo go down to meet the approaching column of American soldiers. Aldo lingers. After seeing to it that the others are safely aboard a truck, Turner goes back for Aldo, who angrily throws rocks at him because he stopped him from killing von Hecht. But finally he is overcome with remorse for having killed Carlo, and begs Turner's forgiveness. Turner gives it, and scoops the defeated and frightened boy up, and carries him to the waiting truck. ==Cast== * Rock Hudson as Capt.

After the failure of the large budgeted Darling Lili, he thought an action war film geared to the youth market directed by the experienced Phil Karlson had potential. The female lead was originally to have been played by Sophia Loren, but she dropped out at the last moment and was replaced by Koscina.. Koscina, who had a childhood in World War II Yugoslavia, felt that the idea of the film of war destroying mentally as well as physically was an interesting one.. Her role as a female German doctor captured by partisans was similar to the lead in the acclaimed The Last Bridge. Though set in 1944, the hairstyles, American fatigues and attitudes are from the late 1960s, with Hudson first wearing the moustache he would have throughout the 1970s. Time Magazine called the film “a weird little war movie full of bizarre energy and merciless violence, a kind of ‘Dirty Dozen Reach Puberty’”.. Ennio Morricone's score included a whistling theme that was used in the film by the children themselves. Michael Avallone wrote a novelisation of the film as a tie-in. An exploitation guide for cinema owners suggested dressing up boys under 15 in army uniforms and putting actual hornets' nests (hopefully without their makers) in shop windows to promote the film.. ==Reception== In what would be the last year of film productions about war, this film opened in both Europe and the U.S. to controversy. Critics attacked the film for its depiction of children learning violence and going to war with an American leading them: there was even a sexual assault by both the boys and later Turner on Koscina's German nurse. Many felt that such depictions did not make a good war film and felt this particular film went to unnecessary lows. This, plus the anachronistic touches in sets and costumes and resentment over the ongoing Vietnam War happening at the time, led the film to fail at the box office, along with other war films like Catch-22, Murphy's War, and Waterloo. After this film, Rock Hudson turned to TV and the show McMillan and Wife. ==See also== * List of American films of 1970 ==References* Category:1970 films Category:1970s war films Category:American war films Category:Macaroni Combat films Category:American films Category:Italian films Category:English-language films Category:Italian Campaign of World War II films Category:Films scored by Ennio Morricone Category:United Artists films Category:Films directed by Phil Karlson ","title":"Hornets' Nest"},{"id":"19248587","text":"Telefe Bahía Blanca (call sign LU 80 TV) is an Argentine private, over-the-air television station broadcasting on channel 9 from Bahía Blanca, Buenos Aires.

Sānanda: sa- means “with”, ananda means joy, bliss. ==Historical descriptions== In Sutra 1:17 Patanjali tells us that samprajnata samadhi comprises four stages: \\"Complete high consciousness (samprajnata samadhi) is that which is accompanied by vitarka (reasoning), vicara (reflection), sananda (ecstasy), and sasmita (a sense of 'I'-ness).\\" Sānanda is free from vitarka and vicara. This is joyous samādhi and it gives intense joy. In sānanda the gross and the five elements are given up. There arises in the Yogi a peculiar perception in the form of intense joy. In this state the mind continues to function, but knowledge of any particular object slowly fades away and the yogi becomes aware of the inner consciousness only. He experiences supreme bliss. In sānanda samādhi the yogi experiences a state of rapture or ecstasy, and the only thought in the mind is the wordless awareness of the feeling of \\"I am in pleasure, I am happy.\\" ==Modern descriptions== According to Dr. Sarasvati Buhrman PhD, \\"Babaji once explained that when people feel blissful sensations during sādhanā, on a gross level the breath is equal in both nostrils, and on the subtle level pranic flow in ida and pingala nadis is balanced. This is called the sushumna breath because the residual prana of the sushuma, the kundalini, flows in sushumna nadi, causing sattva guna to dominate. \\"It creates a feeling of peace. That peace is ananda.\\" In sananda samadhi the experience of that ananda, that sattvic flow, is untainted by any other vrittis, or thoughts, save the awareness of the pleasure of receiving that bliss.\\" According to John C Lilly, sānanda is the highest state of consciousness that can be experienced while staying in the body. In his book Center of the Cyclone he describes sānanda as, \\"blissful state, making the Christ, the green qutub, realization of baraka, the reception of divine grace, cosmic love, cosmic energy, heightened bodily awareness, highest function of bodily and planetside consciousness, being in love, being in a positive LSD energy state.

Since 1993 he has been the Archbishop of Riga in the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia. Vanags is seen as conservative on theological or moral issues and opposes women's ordination. He also opposes abortion and euthanasia, and encourages homosexual people to be chaste.Religious Freedom in the World edited by Paul Marshall, pg 198 He presided over the agreement of fellowship with the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod of the United States. ==Background and education== Vanags studied at Liepaja 5th High School (1965–1976), the Latvian State University Chemistry Department (1976–1982), and the Lutheran Theological Seminar (1984–1989). He worked as a chemistry teacher in Riga Vilis Lacis 31st High School (1982–1985). ==Religious career== Vanags was ordained as a pastor in 1985. He was appointed by the Synod to lead the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia in 1993, following the death of Kārlis Gailītis, the previous archbishop, in a car crash. Lutheranism is the leading faith in Latvia, with a quarter of the country's 2.4 million population counted by the church as active members. Vanags has shunned the practice of the mainstream Lutheran church by refusing to ordain women since his appointment in 1993. ==Homosexuality controversy== Archbishop Vanags has been criticised for his perceived homophobia, particularly when he deposed (defrocked) 36-year-old pastor Maris Sants from Holy Orders. Sants was known for ministering to AIDS patients, but Archbishop Vanags deposed the priest “due to his promotion of a tolerant attitude to homosexuality”. Through a statement by Mara Grigola, secretary to Vanags, he accused Sants of expressing in public \\"information that is against Lutheran doctrine\\". He also stated, \\"Persons who accept homosexual orientation as normal cannot work in the Latvian Evangelical Lutheran Church\\". Sants told AFP that his dismissal came without warning, following an interview he gave with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in which he discussed his own homosexuality. \\"It's the practice in our church to dismiss people and not consult them. The church is not only conservative, but going backwards\\" said Sants, who added that he had been criticised by church officials for ministering to AIDS sufferers. Vanags recently contributed an essay to an anti-homosexuality book which is being investigated by state security police following complaints that it breaches defamation laws. \\"Now homosexuals are recognized as a minority so in principle after them pedophiles may also be recognized as a minority\\", Vanags was recently quoted as saying in the daily Rīgas Balss. He is also quoted as saying, \\"What we could actually say to our brothers and sisters who are in this homosexual orientation, is that they're welcome to receive all that the Gospel means for the church, but we cannot accept their homosexual relationships as a normal alternative to marriage\\". == References  *Biography at the Lutheran Church website *Latvia Revived: interview in Touchstone, May 2001 *Article in \\"Touchstone\\", December 2010 *Latvian Lutheran pastor defrocked for promoting homosexuality.

Jack J. Pendleton (T-AKV-5 /T-AK-276) was a constructed during World War II as a Victory ship and named the SS Mandan Victory. The Mandan Victory was placed into service by the War Shipping Administration's Emergency Shipbuilding program under cognizance of the U.S. Maritime Commission. Post- war she was acquired by the U.S. Army and placed into service as USAT Sgt. Jack J. Pendleton. In 1950 she was reacquired by the Navy and placed into service as the USNS Sgt Jack J. Pendleton (T-AKV-5). Pendleton continued to serve her country throughout the Korean War and Vietnam War. In 1973, while sailing in the Paracel Islands, Sgt Jack J. Pendleton struck a reef off Triton Island. Attempts to remove her from the reef failed, and she was abandoned. ==Victory ship built in Oregon== Sgt. Jack J. Pendleton was laid down under Maritime Commission contract as Mandan Victory (MCV hull 109) on 15 April 1944 by the Oregon Shipbuilding Corp., Portland, Oregon; launched on 26 May 1944; sponsored by Mrs. George C. Carter; and delivered to the Maritime Commission's War Shipping Administration on 19 June 1944. She built under the Emergency Shipbuilding program. ==World War II service== Operated under a general agency agreement by the Isthmian Steamship Co. for the remainder of World War II and during the postwar period, Mandan Victory was subsequently operated by the Waterman Steamship Corporation and by A. L. Burbank and Co. In December 1947, she was laid up with the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Wilmington, Delaware. ==Transferred to the U.S. Army== On 23 April 1948, she was transferred to the Army. Renamed Sgt. Jack J. Pendleton, the Victory ship received miscellaneous alterations, including the addition of radar and the enlargement of her hatches, during the summer; and, in the fall, she commenced 18 months of operations under the Army Transportation Service. ==Acquired by MSTS== On 1 March 1950, the ship was transferred to the Navy for operation by the newly established Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS), now the Military Sealift Command. Designated as a cargo ship and aircraft ferry, the former Army ship was given a civil service crew; placed in service as USNS Sgt. Jack J. Pendleton (T-AKV-5); and assigned to transpacific operations from her home port, San Francisco, California. ==Korean War service== In late June, as the war in Korea broke out, she completed her second round trip to Japan as an MSTS ship and, for the next two years, was employed in moving combat cargoes westward. In the summer of 1952, however, she was shifted to runs to the Marshall Islands and the Mariana Islands; and, in March 1953, she resumed a Far East Schedule which she maintained until after the s:Korean Armistice Agreement. ==Post-Korean War service== From 1954 to 1956, her destinations ranged from islands in the Central Pacific Ocean, to Japan, Korea, Okinawa, Taiwan, the Philippine Islands, and Thailand. During the summer of 1956, she conducted arctic operations. On board was poet and yeoman Allen Ginsberg, who used the ship's mimeograph to print 52 copies of \\"Siesta in Xbalba\\", his first publication, while the ship was anchored off Icy Cape, Alaska. With the fall, resumed her schedule in the more temperate and tropical zones of the Pacific. ===Rescuing a Japanese crew at sea=== In 1958, she was commended for rescuing the entire crew of a large Japanese fishing vessel which had gone down in the Pacific; and, in the same year, she again added northern ports in the Aleutians to her delivery points. ===Temporary service in the Atlantic=== In 1959, after calls at ports on the Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea, and the Gulf of Aden, the ship transited the Suez Canal to take on and deliver cargo in the Mediterranean. From there, she moved into the Atlantic Ocean and, in late March, arrived at New York City. She then continued on to Norfolk, Virginia, whence, for the next two months, she conducted transatlantic runs. Redesignated AK-276 (7 May 1956), Sgt. Jack J. Pendleton carried supplies to northern bases in Greenland in July and in August; and, in September, she sailed for northern Europe, whence she made her way back to the Pacific via the Suez Canal. During October and November, she put into ports on the Indian subcontinent, in southeast Asia, on the island of Taiwan, and on the Korean peninsula. In early December, she was in Japan; and, on the 29th, she arrived at Seattle, Washington, whence, with the new year 1960, she returned to San Francisco to resume transpacific operations. Later in that year, the Victory ship interrupted her more routine schedule to bring the Navy's bathyscaph, Trieste, back to San Diego, California, after the research vessel had set a record dive of 35,800 feet in the Mariana Trench. ==Vietnam War service== Later in the 1960s, as the Vietnam War necessitated a speed-up in the supply line, she was employed in shuttling cargo from Subic Bay to South Vietnam. Since that time, and until, September 23, 1973 when it went aground. Sgt. Jack J.Pendleton, had been home ported in Oakland, California. ==Grounding== While sailing from Vietnam and returning to the United States on September 23, 1973 transiting the Paracel Islands, a group of small islands and reefs in the South China Sea. These islands were normally used for navigation, particularly Triton Island, which was at the Western end of a straight West-to-East passage thru the gap between the Paracels and the Spratly Islands. The ship planned to turn East once it cleared Triton Island, not knowing that wind and waves had set the Pendleton to the north. Sgt. Jack J. Pendleton ran aground on a reef at Triton Island at 17 1/2 knots, very early in the morning, so smoothly that the Captain was not disturbed in his cabin. Various attempts were made to salvage her, however, those attempts failed, the cargo was removed, and she was abandoned. The salvage operation was conducted by the , , , and . The major interest in the Sgt Jack Pendleton to the US Government were two large railroad car generators. One of these generators was loaded on the bow, making direct salvage of the ship almost impossible. There were cases of old rifles and cases of ammunition on board as well. After many attempts, including an unsuccessful attempt by the embarked UDT/Seals (Underwater Demolition Team)from the Deliver to blow a hole in the reef surrounding Triton Island to facilitate the salvage operation using LCU-8s instead of the CH-46 and CH-53 helicopters from Mount Vernon and Mount Hood, members of all five ships were sent aboard the Sgt Jack Pendleton to salvage whatever was felt could be used for the rest of their deployments. The main cargo on the ship was contaminated ammunition for large caliber guns that was being returned from Vietnam to the US. These large shells were stowed in holds both fore and aft. Although a hole was blown in the reef, it was felt that removal of the ammunition by crane was not possible. It was determined that leaving a large ship loaded with unstable ammunition and grounded on an island claimed by multiple countries (some friendly, some not) was not a diplomatic thing to do. The only possible method to remove all this unstable ammunition was by helicopter. An EOD team from the Mount Hood was sent aboard to remove any masts that would prevent the helicopter from reaching the hold located amidships. In a well-orchestrated set of explosions, the main mast amidships was severed at its base, and then 1/2 a second later blown over the port side of the ship. It dropped vertically from the height it had on the ship into the clear water just to port side. Hundreds of pallets of large caliber shells were then lifted by Mount Hoods helicopters, using a lanyard that was more than 100 ft long, from the Sgt Jack Pendleton and set down on the flight deck of Mount Vernon, whose deck crewmen then moved them via pallet jack to a point where they could be reached by Mount Vernons cranes and lowered into the mezzanine and well deck, a very hazardous operation given the nature of the live ammo and the pitching of the ship in the open ocean. Duluth's electronics technicians salvaged the radar antenna and communications gear onboard and transferred it by CH-46 to the flight deck of the Duluth. The put to sea again on 25 September to help to refloat the grounded Sgt. Jack J. Pendleton and returned to Subic Bay from that mission on 9 October. As the storm subsided, Beaufort and Reclaimerhooked their steel cables and beach gear to the aft section of Sgt. Jack J. Pendleton and attempted to tow her off of the snow white coral reef; there was no moving the ship. A barge was supplied from the Deliver to unload the ammunition, and get it to South Vietnam, the unloading was completed by the sailors of Sgt. Jack J. Pendleton. While the unloading was being completed, the crews of Beaufort and Reclaimer put its Navy Divers, Scuba, and Hard Hat Divers into the water to recon the bottom hull of Sgt. Jack J. Pendleton. Beaufort and Reclaimer Hull Technician Divers, and the Explosive Ordnance Demolition E.O.D. Divers noticed a crack in the hull; it was a gap between four inches to twelve inches, and compartments were flooded, which added additional weight. The bow of Sgt. Jack J. Pendleton was protruding approximately twenty feet up toward the sky. Additional ships were dispatched to the scene to assist in pulling the ship off the reef. During the same time, China sent a message stating it owned the island and to stop all procedures and depart the island; North Vietnam also stated it owned the coral reef and to make haste out of the area or it would send a warship to engage the Navy ships, both dispatches were taken seriously, however, neither country possessed an operational naval vessel nearby. All towing attempts failed, and a typhoon was closing in on the area. Beaufort and Reclaimer made one final attempt October 4th. Another ship rammed the starboard side of \\"Beaufort\\", nearly crushing a sailor, as the I-Beam of the other ship crushed-in the side of Beaufort. The ship was hit so hard, the mast began to shake violently, and the men on the ship's bridge were on the deck waiting for it to crash. Beaufort removed all men from Sgt. Jack J. Pendleton, and loaded Divers into a Mike Boat, Landing Craft. The Divers took dive equipment, and demolitions supplied from Deliver to the 'Pendleton', and set charges to the hull. After retreating approximately 1,000 yards, the charges exploded, and the ship was there \\"for the duration\\". It was used as a Radar Beacon for aircraft. Beaufort Hull Technicians shored its bulkhead with wood and steel, until it could get back to port for major repairs. During repairs, a U.S. Naval Destroyer was docked starboard side to Beaufort. ==Honors and awards== Qualified vessel personnel were qualified for the following: * National Defense Service Medal * Vietnam Service Medal * Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal ==Note== Some accounts of this vessel give her name as \\"Pendelton\\" instead of the correct name \\"Pendleton\\" which is the spelling of the person for which she was named by the Navy. ==References== * * NavSource Online: Service Ship Photo Archive - T-AKV-5 / T-AK-276 Sgt Jack J.

As a result, Lenore loses the love of Karados, a knight, and is banished from King Arthur's court. The King encourages a romantic attachment between Karados and his niece. The two are scheduled to be betrothed at the Feast of the Peacock, and King Arthur orders that Lenore be brought back to court to witness the event. Meanwhile, Lenore is ministered to by a guardian spirit who weaves her a beautiful new gown. Lenore arrives at the court along with the guardian spirit who is in the guise of a minstrel. The guardian spirit has brought the gown he weaved to the court proclaiming to the men that it will only fit a man of great virtue and the women that it will only fit the most beautiful woman. He has also brought a drinking-horn which only a true knight can empty. To the chagrin of the knights, Queen Ginevra proclaims that she will try on the gown first. When she approaches the gown, it flies away from her. All the other ladies of the court attempt to try on the gown with the same result. When Lenore reaches for the gown it stays still and fits her perfectly. Similarly, none of the knights can empty the drinking-horn except for Karados.

He was obliged to work from a young age. At 16 years old, he joined the youth wing of the Communist Party of Poland (KPP), where he became an active militant. In 1931, he was arrested by the regime of Józef Piłsudski and condemned to five years in prison. Invigorated by his incarceration, he resumed his activism on release. His friends advised him to leave Poland to escape persecution by the police. Grzywacz arrived in Paris in 1936 but soon left for Spain, where he fought in the International Brigades against General Francisco Franco's revolt and the worldwide threat of fascism. After the defeat of the republican army, he spent time in the concentration camps of Gurs and et Argelès-sur-Mer, but managed to get away. === Second world war === In the German occupation of France during World War II, Grzywacz became active in the underground trade unionism movement. He organized Jewish workers in the fur industry. However, he regarded this work to be too sedate for him, and joined the FTP-MOI where he fought against the Germans. He slipped between the fingers of the Gestapo during their massive arrest operation against foreign fighters. Grzywacz' experience as a fighter for republican Spain and the Francs-Tireurs prepared him for the suffering he was to endure when he was brought before a German military tribunal, sentenced to death, and executed on the 21 February 1944 at Mont Valérien. ==See also== * Francs-tireurs et partisans - Main-d'œuvre immigrée * Affiche rouge * Brigades Spéciales * Geheime Feld Polizei ==Bibliography == *FFI - FTPF, Pages de gloire des vingt- trois (Pages of glory of the 23), Immigration, 1951 (French). == External links == * The daily life of a \\"Terrorist\\" (French) * Discussion between André Santini and Henry Karayan (French) Category:1909 births Category:1944 deaths Category:People from Wołomin Category:Polish Jews Category:Jews in the French resistance Category:FTP-MOI Category:Members of the Francs-tireurs et partisans Category:Executed Polish people Category:Resistance members killed by Nazi Germany Category:International Brigades personnel Category:People executed by Germany by firearm Category:Polish people executed by Nazi Germany Category:Executed people from Masovian Voivodeship Category:Affiche rouge ","title":"Szlama Grzywacz"},{"id":"19248667","text":"Robert Darley Waddilove (born Robert Darley; known after 1762 as Darley Waddilove; November 1736 – 18 August 1828) was Dean of Ripon. Waddilove was born in November 1736, was son of Abel Darley of Boroughbridge. This branch of the Darley family had lived for four generations at Ripley in Yorkshire, but the Waddilove's father migrated to Scoreby in East Riding. He was educated at Westminster School and Clare Hall, Cambridge, of which society he became a scholar, but was unable to take a fellowship, having inherited landed property at Boroughbridge from his uncle, Robert Waddilove (d. 1762), president of Barnard's Inn, whose name he assumed. He graduated BA in 1759, and MA in 1762. He was curate of Wotton in Surrey, and in 1767 rector of Whitby. From 1771 to 1779 he was chaplain to Thomas Robinson, 2nd Baron Grantham, ambassador to the Court at Madrid, during which time he exchanged Whitby for Topcliffe, and appointed himself rector of Cherry Burton, both in Yorkshire. In 1780 he became prebendary of Ripon, 1782 prebendary of York, and in 1786 Archdeacon of the East Riding. He was chaplain to Robert Hay Drummond and William Markham, Archbishops of York, and in 1791 became Dean of Ripon. He received the degree of LLD from John Moore (Archbishop of Canterbury). He held the deanery of Ripon with the archdeaconry until his death. During his residence in Spain Waddilove became friends with Abbe Bayer, tutor to the Spanish court, and had access to the library of the Escorial, where he collated the manuscript of Strabo for Thomas Falconer's edition (Clarendon Press, 2 vols. fol. 1807), and obtained much useful information for Robertson's History of America, which the historian gratefully acknowledges in the preface. He also wrote remarks on the pictures in the king of Spain's collection which had formerly belonged to Charles I of England, translated Mengs's Essay on Painting (2 vols. London, 1796), and received from Infante Gabriel of Spain a copy of the translation of Salluse made by the prince. In 1775, while in Spain, he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, for which he wrote several papers, among them 'An Historical and Descriptive Account of Ripon Minster' (Archæologia, vols. xvi. and xvii.) At his death he left to the library of York Minster a magnificent copy of Falconer's 'Strabo,' and of the rare work Bibliotheca Arábica del Escurial. Waddilove was an active magistrate and zealous in his ecclesiastical duties; in one instance he was recorded as having destroyed a stage to prevent an illegal boxing match in the village of Grewelthorpe near Ripon.http://www.grewelthorpe.org.uk/history/boxing-match He was president of the Society for the Relief of the North Riding Clergy, and earnestly promoted its interests. His private charities were extensive, and he gave on several occasions large sums to increase the endowments of parishes in his own patronage or that of the chapter. Waddilove died at the deanery, Ripon, on 18 August 1828. On 3 April 1781, at the age of 45, he married Anne Hope Grant, daughter of Ludovic Grant (Luss in Argyll) who was 10 years his junior. Anne died in May 1797 after a long and painful illness, aged just 51. Waddilove's eldest son, Thomas Darley Waddilove, died in March 1799 aged only 17, and his youngest son (another priest), Robert Darley Waddilove, died in Penzance, Cornwall in July 1813 at the age of 24.

The phenomenon of macromolecular crowding alters the properties of molecules in a solution when high concentrations of macromolecules such as proteins are present. Such conditions occur routinely in living cells; for instance, the cytosol of Escherichia coli contains about 300– of macromolecules. Crowding occurs since these high concentrations of macromolecules reduce the volume of solvent available for other molecules in the solution, which has the result of increasing their effective concentrations. Crowding can promote formation of a biomolecular condensate by colloidal phase separation. This crowding effect can make molecules in cells behave in radically different ways than in test- tube assays. Consequently, measurements of the properties of enzymes or processes in metabolism that are made in the laboratory (in vitro) in dilute solutions may be different by many orders of magnitude from the true values seen in living cells (in vivo). The study of biochemical processes under realistically crowded conditions is very important, since these conditions are a ubiquitous property of all cells and crowding may be essential for the efficient operation of metabolism. Indeed, in vitro studies showed that crowding greatly influences binding stability of proteins to DNA. ==Cause and effects== The interior of cells is a crowded environment. For example, an Escherichia coli cell is only about 2 micrometres (μm) long and 0.5 μm in diameter, with a cell volume of 0.6 - 0.7 μm3. However, E. coli can contain up to 4,288 different types of proteins, and about 1,000 of these types are produced at a high enough level to be easily detected. Added to this mix are various forms of RNA and the cell's DNA chromosome, giving a total concentration of macromolecules of between 300 and 400 mg/ml. In eukaryotes the cell's interior is further crowded by the protein filaments that make up the cytoskeleton, this meshwork divides the cytosol into a network of narrow pores. The volume of accessible solvent (red) for two molecules of widely different sizes (black circles) at high concentrations of macromolecules (grey circles). Reducing the available volume increases the effective concentration of macromolecules. These high concentrations of macromolecules occupy a large proportion of the volume of the cell, which reduces the volume of solvent that is available for other macromolecules. This excluded volume effect increases the effective concentration of macromolecules (increasing their chemical activity), which in turn alters the rates and equilibrium constants of their reactions. In particular this effect alters dissociation constants by favoring the association of macromolecules, such as when multiple proteins come together to form protein complexes, or when DNA-binding proteins bind to their targets in the genome. Crowding may also affect enzyme reactions involving small molecules if the reaction involves a large change in the shape of the enzyme. The size of the crowding effect depends on both the molecular mass and shape of the molecule involved, although mass seems to be the major factor - with the effect being stronger with larger molecules. Notably, the size of the effect is non-linear, so macromolecules are much more strongly affected than are small molecules such as amino acids or simple sugars. Macromolecular crowding is therefore an effect exerted by large molecules on the properties of other large molecules. ==Importance== Macromolecular crowding is an important effect in biochemistry and cell biology. For example, the increase in the strength of interactions between proteins and DNA produced by crowding may be of key importance in processes such as transcription and DNA replication. Crowding has also been suggested to be involved in processes as diverse as the aggregation of hemoglobin in sickle-cell disease, and the responses of cells to changes in their volume. The importance of crowding in protein folding is of particular interest in biophysics. Here, the crowding effect can accelerate the folding process, since a compact folded protein will occupy less volume than an unfolded protein chain. However, crowding can reduce the yield of correctly folded protein by increasing protein aggregation. Crowding may also increase the effectiveness of chaperone proteins such as GroEL in the cell, which could counteract this reduction in folding efficiency. It has also been shown that macromolecular crowding affects protein-folding dynamics as well as overall protein shape where distinct conformational changes are accompanied by secondary structure alterations implying that crowding-induced shape changes may be important for protein function and malfunction in vivo. A particularly striking example of the importance of crowding effects involves the crystallins that fill the interior of the lens. These proteins have to remain stable and in solution for the lens to be transparent; precipitation or aggregation of crystallins causes cataracts. Crystallins are present in the lens at extremely high concentrations, over 500 mg/ml, and at these levels crowding effects are very strong. The large crowding effect adds to the thermal stability of the crystallins, increasing their resistance to denaturation. This effect may partly explain the extraordinary resistance shown by the lens to damage caused by high temperatures. ==Study== Due to macromolecular crowding, enzyme assays and biophysical measurements performed in dilute solution may fail to reflect the actual process and its kinetics taking place in the cytosol. One approach to produce more accurate measurements would be to use highly concentrated extracts of cells, to try to maintain the cell contents in a more natural state. However, such extracts contain many kinds of biologically active molecules, which can interfere with the phenomena being studied. Consequently, crowding effects are mimicked in vitro by adding high concentrations of relatively inert molecules such as polyethylene glycol, ficoll, dextran, or serum albumin to experimental media. However, using such artificial crowding agents can be complicated, as these crowding molecules can sometimes interact in other ways with the process being examined, such as by binding weakly to one of the components. ==Macromolecular crowding and protein folding== A major importance of macromolecular crowding to biological systems stems from its effect on protein folding. The underlying physical mechanism by which macromolecular crowding helps to stabilize proteins in their folded state is often explained in terms of excluded volume - the volume inaccessible to the proteins due to their interaction with macromolecular crowders. This notion goes back to Asakura and Oosawa, who have described depletion forces induced by steric, hard-core, interactions. A hallmark of the mechanism inferred from the above is that the effect is completely a-thermal, and thus completely entropic. These ideas were also proposed to explain why small cosolutes, namely protective osmolytes, which are preferentially excluded from proteins, also shift the protein folding equilibrium towards the folded state. However, it has been shown by various methods, both experimental and theoretical, that depletion forces are not always entropic in nature. == Macromolecular crowding in regenerative medicine == Satyam et al. from National University of Ireland, Galway (NUI Galway) proposed macromolecular crowding as means to create ECM- rich tissue equivalents. The principle of macromolecular crowding is derived from the notion that in vivo cells reside in a highly crowded/dense extracellular space and therefore the conversion of the de novo synthesised procollagen to collagen I is rapid. However, in the even substantially more dilute than body fluids (e.g., urine: 36–50 g/L; blood: 80 g/L) culture conditions (e.g., HAM F10 nutrient medium: 16.55 g/L; DMEM/ F12 medium: 16.78 g/L; DMEM high glucose and L-glutamine medium: 17.22 g/L), the rate limiting conversion of procollagen to collagen I is very slow. It was confirmed that the addition of inert polydispersed macromolecules (presented as spherical objects of variable diameter) in the culture media will facilitate amplified production of ECM-rich living substitutes. Macromolecular crowding, by imitating native tissue localised density, can be utilised to effectively modulate in vitro microenvironments and ultimately produce ECM-rich cell substitutes, within hours rather than days or months in culture, without compromising fundamental cellular functions. ==See also== *Ideal solution *Colligative properties ==ReferencesCategory:Physical chemistry Category:Tissue engineering Category:Protein methods Category:Biophysics ","title":"Macromolecular crowding"},{"id":"19248701","text":"Andorra participated in the eighth Winter Paralympic Games in Salt Lake City, United States.

Barwell successfully lobbied the Prime Minister, David Cameron to introduce legislation to make driving under the influence of drugs a similar offence to driving under the influence of alcohol. Cameron met with the Groves family and legislation was included in the 2012 Queen's Speech. The legislation created a new offence under the Crime and Courts Act 2013. ===PPS and junior minister=== Barwell was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to Greg Clark, Minister for Cities and Decentralisation. In September 2012, he was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Michael Gove the Secretary of State for Education.Croydon Central MP Gavin Barwell nets new job with Michael Gove Croydon Advertiser, 12 September 2012; Retrieved 28 December 2012 The Prime Minister David Cameron appointed Barwell to the position of Assistant Government Whip on 7 October 2013.

At the 2017 general election held just 15 months later, Barwell lost his marginal seat. He was Minister of State for Housing and Planning and Minister for London from July 2016 to June 2017. ===Deletion of material from Wikipedia=== In December 2014, the local paper The Croydon Advertiser called on Barwell to \\"stop launching campaigns\\" and \\"persistent attempts at headline-grabbing\\" saying \\"Gavin, we get it, there's an election on.\\" The page on Wikipedia was one of a number edited ahead of the 2015 general election by computers inside parliament; an act which The Daily Telegraph said \\"appears to be a deliberate attempt to hide embarrassing information from the electorate\\". ===Allegations of electoral fraud=== In May 2016, a member of the public complained to the Metropolitan Police Service over possible electoral fraud in Barwell's 2015 election campaign. The claims relate to the number of leaflets Barwell delivered in his constituency, as undelivered election material does not fall under the election spending limit. Barwell denied the claims, saying he followed 'proper process' when filing the election expenses. Barwell was found in a separate investigation to be in breach of the Code of Conduct by Kathryn Hudson, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. However, the Police investigation concluded in October 2016 that there was no case to answer. ===2017 defeat=== In the snap general election of 2017, Barwell lost his seat to Labour's Sarah Jones by 5,652 votes. When he lost his seat he was awarded a \\"loss of office\\" (redundancy) grant of £8,802 inline with his age and length of parliamentary service. He returned the full amount to IPSA upon his appointment as Downing Street chief of staff. In December 2018 it was announced that he would not be the Conservative candidate in the next election in Croydon Central. ===House of Lords=== Barwell was nominated for a life peerage in Theresa May's Resignation Honours List in September 2019. He was created Baron Barwell, of Croydon in the London Borough of Croydon, on 7 October 2019. ==Downing Street Chief of staff (2017–2019)== On 10 June 2017, Theresa May appointed Barwell Downing Street Chief of Staff. Following the Grenfell Tower fire of 14 June 2017, he was criticised by The Independent for adding to delays in publishing a report into fire safety which followed the 2009 Lakanal House fire. The day following the fire, he walked past journalists but refused to answer any questions. Following the departure of Theresa May as Prime Minister in July 2019, Barwell stepped down as Chief of Staff and was replaced by Dominic Cummings and Sir Eddie Lister. ==Personal life== Barwell married Karen McKenzie in 2001.

It was one of CompuServe's most popular games throughout its lifetime with thousands of players joining the month-long game cycles. It was only shut down after CIS was purchased by AOL and moved to the web-based \\"CompuServe 2000\\" interface that would not cleanly support it. A modified version, Stellar Emperor ran for much of the same time period on GEnie, also ending in 1999 when that service shut down by General Electric. A new version of Stellar Emperor, sporting a new client-server GUI, was run for a short period on Kesmai's GameStorm. ==HistoryS=== In 1979 University of Virginia 4th year students Kelton Flinn and John Taylor started work on a game for the Hewlett-Packard HP 2000F time sharing minicomputer. Known simply as S, the game supported up to eight players on directly connected 2400 baud terminals. Much of what would become MegaWars III was present in S, but greatly simplified. This included ship-to- ship combat, the galaxy layout and creation engine, and a simple planetary economics system. The game was much \\"smaller\\" however, supporting fewer players and a smaller 255-system \\"galaxy\\". ===MegaWars=== Bill Louden was in charge of games at CompuServe. In 1982 he purchased a version of DECWAR and turned it over to the programmers at Kesmai, who wrote many of CompuServe's games. While completing their doctorates, Flinn and Taylor started Kesmai, a reference to their first commercial product, Islands of Kesmai. They found that the copyright said nothing about commercial uses, and quickly produced a new version that removed any potentially lawsuit-friendly names from the Star Trek universe with more generic versions. The new version, MegaWars, went live on CompuServe in 1983 and ran continuously until 1998, although there were a few times where they closed it down during that period only to revive it after receiving complaints from the players. Numerous additions were made during its run, notably different classes of ships, and later versions looked little like the original DECWAR. In 1985 Louden left CompuServe to form GEnie at General Electric. Kesmai re-scrubbed the system for use on GEnie, producing Stellar Warrior. Like MegaWars, Stellar Warrior ran for years, and was finally killed when GEnie was shut down in 1999. ===MegaWars III=== Returning to S, CompuServe asked the game to be tied to MegaWars, which was a big hit, and the new version emerged as MegaWars III, II being a client-server version of the original MegaWars which was not released. During the conversion, the game was greatly expanded. The maximum number of simultaneous players was increased from eight to 100, and the galaxy contained 1000 systems. However, another feature was lost; in S the player could close with an enemy ship in space and attempt to take it over, taking that ship's cargo if they were successful. The game first went live on CIS on 19 January 1984, with this initial game running until 15 March. This was much longer than later games, which generally settled into a one-month period. From that point the game ran continually with only minor changes until 24 November 1999, when it no longer worked due to CIS turning off the \\"classic\\" text-mode interface which was needed to run the game. ===Stellar Emperor=== Louden, who had been instrumental in setting up Kesmi on CIS, convinced General Electric to start a similar service on their machines, naming it GEnie. Many of the Kesmi games were ported to the new systems, although with minor changes to the names and theming in keeping with the new service. On GEnie, MegaWars III became Stellar Emperor. The game was modified from the original, the most notable change being the removal of the ship customization system and its replacement with a fixed set of pre-rolled designs. Like the original, this version of Stellar Emperor shut down in 1999 when the GEnie service ended. The game was saved from completely disappearing when Kesmi opened their own online service, GameStorm. Stellar Emperor ran on this service, but now used a 2D graphical client that made many of the interactive portions of the game a point-and-click affair. However, this did not save it for long; Electronic Arts purchased Kesmi in 1999, and shut the service down in 2001. ===MegaWars III, The Rebirth=== The loss of MegaWars III has let to a number of efforts to revive the game in various forms. MegaWars III, The Rebirth is a browser based reincarnation of MegaWars III played on CompuServe and Stellar Emperor played on GEnie in the 1980s. Rebirth was created by David Baity, a well-known player of the original MegaWars III. Greatly enhanced performance eliminated all limitations to the number of players. Additionally, third party applications could easily be integrated into the game and several have been written. The initial release of Rebirth took place in 2010. ==References *MegaWars III, The Rebirth official website *Review by Richard Bartle archived at Textfiles.com Category:4X video games Category:Inactive massively multiplayer online games Category:Multiplayer video games Category:Space trading and combat simulators Category:1984 video games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"MegaWars III"},{"id":"19248729","text":"Mawby in 2011 Russell G.

Kellogg Foundation for 25 years, during which he was credited for creativity in programming by providing opportunities for youth and leadership in the field.News and Information Services Forum, (Grand Valley State University, September 2, 2008) ==Early life and philanthropy== Mawby was born in Kent County, Michigan in 1928 and grew up on a fruit farm. ==Education and career== Mawby attended Michigan State University and graduated with a baccalaureate degree in horticulture and was a member of Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity. In 1951 he completed his Master's degree in Agricultural Economics from Purdue University, and in 1959 he received his doctorate, also in Agricultural Economics, from Michigan State University. He served on the faculties of both institutions once he completed his degrees and later became a professor and assistant director of the Cooperative Extension Service responsible for 4-H Clubs and youth programming throughout Michigan. In December 1964, upon the completion of his doctorate degree, Mawby joined the staff of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation as director of the Division of Agriculture. In that position, he developed the Michigan Agricultural Leadership Program, which became a model for the national rural leadership movement. Just three years later he was promoted to vice president and in 1970 became the president and chief executive officer. The Kellogg Foundation became the national leader in providing support and funding for innovative programs in a number of fields including adult continuing education, access to primary health care, and the development of leadership, especially through the Kellogg National Fellowship Program. Additionally, he spearheaded projects throughout the United States of America, Europe, and Latin America. Upon Mawby's retirement in 1995, he served as a foundation trustee until 2000 and served as an honorary trustee until 2017. ==Leadership positions== *Director of the Division of Agriculture- The W.K.

The film appeared in the summer of 1969, a few months before the arrival of Pollack's smash hit They Shoot Horses, Don't They?. The film is based on the novel of the same name by William Eastlake published in 1965, and has the dubious distinction of being one of the very few war movies that is both pro and anti war at the same time. Eastlake enlisted in the United States Army in 1942. He served in the Infantry for four and a half years, and was wounded while leading a platoon during the Battle of the Bulge. ==Plot== The film opens with long, beautiful shots of ancient European art and sculptures being blown to pieces amidst the sounds of war and dissonant screams; a lone narrator begins his tale of \\"eight American soldiers\\" as the scene abruptly flashes back to a few weeks earlier. Prior to the Battle of the Bulge, a ragtag squad of American soldiers (implied to be some sort of replacement outfit), led by one-eyed Major Abraham Falconer (Burt Lancaster) and including Sgt. Rossi (Peter Falk), art expert Captain Beckman (Patrick O'Neal), and the highly intelligent narrator and sole African- American, Pvt. Allistair Benjamin (Al Freeman Jr.), take shelter in an ancient Belgian castle, the Maldorais, containing many priceless and irreplaceable art treasures. Although Falconer begins an affair with the young and beautiful Countess (Astrid Heeren), he is surprised to find the Count of Maldorais Henri Tixier (Jean-Pierre Aumont) encouraging him; in fact, the impotent nobleman hopes the Major will impregnate the Countess so that his line may continue. Meanwhile, Beckman begins to butt heads with Falconer over both the value of the art (in the context of either saving or destroying it in the event of a German assault) as well as Beckman's own unrequited attraction to the Countess, who seems to symbolize the beauty and majesty of the European art that he had studied before the war. The enlisted men seek their own pleasures in the brothel of the nearby town, the psychedelic \\"Reine Rouge\\" (Red Queen) run by a mystical madam, while Beckman marvels at the castle's artworks, many of which are stored beneath the castle for safekeeping. Sgt. Rossi, a baker before the war, falls in love with a baker's widow and decides to go AWOL, resuming his pre-war life. Others in the group are sympathetic to his cause, and rather than arresting him, try and talk him into re-enlisting. Another soldier falls in love with a Volkswagen Beetle; his affection for the foreign vehicle borders on paraphilia and becomes a long running and anachronistic gag throughout the rest of the movie. Soon after the very first scene, that of the ragtag group, slowly riding on a problematic Jeep, there is a sense of foreboding, a feeling of inevitability of what will eventually transpire. But in the mean time, the soldiers' days of leisure and peace almost threaten to undermine the very reality and the ugliness of the war itself. There is a recurring theme of eternal recurrence, as one soldier drunkenly ponders out loud that maybe he's \\"been here before\\". And, although the men are eager to sit out the war that they feel will soon end, the audience is not so sure. The experienced Major Falconer confirms the audience suspicions, by predicting that Germans will attack the thin American positions in the Ardennes and that the castle is a strategic point in the Germans advance towards the crossroads of Bastogne. The Major's theories are further confirmed when he sees German star shell signals and successfully ambushes a German reconnaissance patrol led by a German officer who was once billeted in the castle and was a previous lover of the Countess. Captain Beckman and the Count are horrified that the Major will not abandon the castle, a decision that will surely lead to its destruction; Falconer, however, is adamant that to give the Germans one thing means that they'll just end up \\"taking everything\\" later on (see appeasement). Falconer prepares defensive positions around the castle and sends his unit into town. The Germans are initially taken by surprise, as Falconer directs the local sex workers at the \\"Reine Rouge\\" to draw them into a trap with Molotov cocktails; however, the defenders soon find themselves outnumbered and outgunned (although two GIs manage to steal and repurpose a working German tank, which they jokingly claim is \\"better than ours\\"). Seeing no other choice but to retreat to the safety of the castle, Falconer attempts to rally shell shocked American troops retreating from the Ardennes into the Maldorais, forcing (at gunpoint) a band of zealous, hymn-singing conscientious objectors, led by Lt. Billy Byron Bix (Bruce Dern), to lead the dazed survivors in a bizarre Pied Piper-esque procession; symbolically, they are all mostly killed by an exploding shell, all except for Falconer, who stoically returns to the castle for his last stand astride a pale white horse. He returns to find that the Count has run over to the German lines; Beckman thinks he has a scheme to betray them and let the Germans seize the castle by using the underground storage tunnels to gain access; however, it is soon revealed that the Count was really only trying to buy as much time for the Americans as possible so that they could make it to the castle and strengthen their defenses. As soon as his ruse is discovered, he is gunned down trying to run from the Germans. Falconer and Beckman put aside their personal and ideological differences and grimly prepare for the oncoming assault with a .50 caliber machine gun pointed across the castle grounds. At the conclusion of the film, everyone defending the castle, (with the exception of Pvt. Benjamin and a pregnant Countess, who escape to safety using the art storage tunnels following the orders of Maj. Falconer) is eventually killed by waves of besieging Germans. The final battle scene is bizarre, featuring the enemy storming the gates of the castle using a ladder carrying fire truck, as much of the castle (along with its art treasures) is obliterated by artillery, incendiaries and other weapons. Part of the ending is brilliantly overdubbed by the narrator who explains (which is how Pvt. Benjamin's book will eventually read) how all the Americans survive, when in fact we can clearly see on the screen that all the Americans (except Pvt. Benjamin) die. Maj. Falconer, the last defender left alive, begins to think of all of the people whom he has killed or have died because of his actions as well as the Countess as he guns down the rapidly approaching swarm of German soldiers, implying that he did indeed feel guilty about their deaths and that he loved the Countess much more than he let on. A shell finally lands on top of his position and explodes as the screen goes white. The film finishes where it began, echoing the theme of eternal recurrence, with more long shots of the undemolished Maldorais as it once stood, as well as a voice- over of Pvt. Benjamin's narration from the very beginning, and then the final credits roll. ==Cast== * Burt Lancaster as Major Abraham Falconer * Patrick O'Neal as Captain Lionel Beckman * Jean-Pierre Aumont as the Count of Maldorais * Peter Falk as Sergeant Rossi * Astrid Heeren as Therese * Scott Wilson as Corporal Clearboy * Tony Bill as Lieutenant Amberjack * Al Freeman Jr. as Private Allistair Piersall Benjamin * James Patterson as Elk * Bruce Dern as Lieutenant Billy Byron Bix * Michael Conrad as Sergeant DeVaca * Caterina Boratto as Red Queen * Olga Bisera as the Baker's Wife ==Quotes== Beckman: \\"Hey Benjamin, now there's a title for your book...

This is an assistive device that allows patients in hospitals and nursing homes and people receiving home health care to be transferred between a bed and a chair or other similar resting places, by the use of electrical or hydraulic power. Sling lifts are used for patients whose mobility is limited. Sling lifts are mobile (or floor) lifts or overhead lifts (suspended from ceiling, wall-mounted or overhead tracks). The sling lift has several advantages. It allows heavy patients to be transferred while decreasing stress on caregivers while also reducing the number of nursing staff required to move patients. It also reduces the chance of orthopedic injury from lifting patients. Another kind of sling lift, which is called a ceiling lift, can be permanently installed on the ceiling of a room in order to save space. Mistakes using patient lifts may result in serious injury and some injuries that have been caused by improper use or malfunction of sling lifts have led to civil lawsuits. ==See also== *Casualty lifting * Lift chair ==References== Category:Medical equipment Category:Mobility devices Category:Lifting equipment Category:Accessibility ","title":"Patient lift"},{"id":"19248794","text":"The Breithorn is a mountain of the Swiss Lepontine Alps in the Valais.

The first time these debates were held was during the 1968 election. They were until recently produced by a consortium of the main Canadian television networks, namely the CBC/SRC, CTV, Global and TVA, although other channels such as CPAC (and C-SPAN in the United States; English-language debate only) carry the broadcasts as well. ==Inclusion criteria== Although there are usually a dozen or so political parties registered with Elections Canada at any given time, not all party leaders are invited to the debates. The stated criteria for inclusion have shifted over time with the maneuvering for political advantage, but the typical criteria set by the debate consortium has been that a political party needs to have representation in the House of Commons. Over the years, there have been at least three and as many as six, leaders at each such debate. Public criticism of the debates has emerged outlining that corporate media executives decide who is allowed to be heard in a public forum critical to deciding elected officials. Given the overlap between governments and corporations, there is a conflict of interest having corporate executives impacting elections. There have been calls to have Elections Canada set up an impartial debates protocol. Following the 1988 federal election, after a decision of the Attorney General of Canada to stay a prosecution under the Broadcasting Act initiated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) against several Canadian television networks, at the instance of the CRTC, a private prosecution was instituted on behalf of the Green Party of Canada by former Chief Agent and Treasurer Alberta Greens Newsletter Volume 6 Number 3 Autumn 1994 Greg Vezina against CBC, CTV and Global, claiming that these broadcasters had breached the Television Broadcasting Regulations 1987, because they had not included the Green Party and other accredited and registered small political party leaders in the leaders' debates during a federal general election and had failed to provide equitable time to them. In R. v. Canadian Broadcasting Corporation et al., (1993) 51 CPR (3d) 192, the Ontario Court of Appeal held that debates were not of a partisan political character. The Court believed that while the participants in a debate may very well be partisan, the program itself, because it presented more than one view, was not. The court therefore ruled that debates were not covered by the relevant section of the regulations and notwithstanding provisions of under the Canada Elections Act limiting, restricting and in many cases prohibiting contributions of political advertising and broadcasting, declared both acts to be 'a complete code' and therefore there was no requirement to provide any time at all for parties or candidates excluded from debates during election campaigns no matter how many candidates or parties were excluded so long as two or more were included in such programs. (Broadcasters and other media used the same reasoning to exclude commentators and representatives from smaller parties in news and public affairs panels and programs both during and in between elections in Canada.) The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada which refused to grant leave to appeal (without reasons as is the custom) in decision 23881 by Justices La Forest, Sopinka and Major JJ, released on May 6, 1994. Judgements of the Supreme Court of Canada, Bulletin of May 6, 1994 Subsequently, the CRTC issued Public Notice CRTC 1995–44, Election-period broadcasting: Debates, which stated, In view of this judgment, the commission will no longer require that so-called \\"debates\\" programs feature all rival parties or candidates in one or more programs. Public Notice CRTC 1995-44 In both the 1993 election and the 2000 election, Greg Vezina working as an independent producer, the Green Party and the Natural Law Party of Canada organized All Party Leaders' Debates which invited the leaders of all registered and accredited parties to participate. On both occasions the leaders of the major parties declined, but the leaders of the other smaller political parties participated. While all other members of the Election Broadcasting Consortium failed to broadcast the 1993 program after announcing they would, in both the 1993 and 2000 the one- hour debates were carried on CBC Newsworld and the debates and another hour of town hall questions and answers afterword on CPAC (English: Cable Public Affairs Channel and in French: La Chaîne d'affaires publiques par câble). The debates were widely covered by the media including the Globe and Mail who wrote about the 2000 debate. Globe and Mail Nov. 20, 2000 , Fringe debate features less yelling, better karma\\" The 2000 Debate was the first of its kind broadcast and archived on the Internet on the Democracy Channel website link to Democracy Channel website http://democracychannel.net Prior to the 2008 election, the Green Party, which, from at least the 1997 election until 2008, was consistently the highest-polling party among those without a seat in Parliament, had unsuccessfully argued on several occasions for a role in the debates. In the 1993 French-language debate, Reform Party leader Preston Manning opted to make only an opening statement, as he was only fluent in English at the time. However, as parties with seats in the House of Commons prior to the election, they qualified regardless of this criticism. ==1968 debate== { style=\\"border: solid 1px #bbb; margin: 0 0 0 1.4em; float:right; font-size:90%; text-align:center\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\"  Party leaders and participants - Liberal leader, Pierre Trudeau  - Pierre Trudeau, Liberal Robert Stanfield, Prog.

Réal Caouette, speaking only in French, was present only during the latter of the part whilst Douglas and Stanfield only debated in English. Trudeau alternated between French and English. Private network CTV originally proposed a 90-minute debate between only Trudeau and Stanfield, prompting the NDP to protest. Trudeau demanded that all leaders be included and that the debate be in both official languages. Ultimately, the debate was organized jointly by CTV and CBC/Radio-Canada as a two-hour event with Trudeau, Stanfield and Douglas debating for the 80 minutes, and Creditiste leader Caouette joining in for the final 40 minutes. Simultaneous translation was provided. Alexander Bell Patterson, leader of the rump Social Credit Party of Canada, was not included.http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/05/25/ruffled-feathers-power- p_n_7434208.html The debate was conducted in Parliament's Confederation Hall; moderators were Pierre Nadeau of Radio-Canada/CBC and Charles Templeton of CTV with questions from a panel of journalists made up of Ron Collister, Tom Gould, and Jean-Marc Poliquin.http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/1968-leaders- debate Six years earlier, during the 1962 federal election, Liberal leader Lester Pearson had challenged Progressive Conservative prime minister John Diefenbaker to a televised debate but was turned down. ==1979 debate== { style=\\"border: solid 1px #bbb; margin: 0 0 0 1.4em; float:right; font- size:90%; text-align:center\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\"  Party leaders and participants - Liberal leader, Pierre Trudeau Progressive Conservative leader, Joe Clark Ed Broadbent, NDP leader - Pierre Trudeau, Liberal Joe Clark, Prog.

Leaders participating in the 1984 debates were Liberal leader and prime minister John Turner, Progressive Conservative leader Brian Mulroney, and NDP leader Ed Broadbent. The most notable moment of the main English language debate was when Mulroney confronted Turner over his approval of patronage appointees by the outgoing prime minister, Trudeau in which Mulroney scolded Turner, telling him \\"You had an option, sir. You could have said, 'I am not going to do it. This is wrong for Canada, and I am not going to ask Canadians to pay the price.' You had an option, sir — to say 'no' — and you chose to say 'yes' to the old attitudes and the old stories of the Liberal Party. That sir, if I may say respectfully, that is not good enough for Canadians.. \\" The Progressive Conservatives won a landslide majority, leaving the Liberals nearly tied for second place with the NDP. The broadcast consortium's French-language debate was held on July 24, 1984 and the two-hour English-language debate was held the next day. Both debates were held in Ottawa and conducted in the studios of CJOH-TV. The moderator for the English debate was McGill principal David Johnston, who also moderated the 1979 debate.

The first two were held in Vancouver. The French-language debate was on Thursday, December 15, 2005, followed the next day by the English debate. The English debate was moderated by Trina McQueen, who was President and COO of CTVGlobemedia from 2000 to 2002. The final debates were scheduled for Gatineau and Montréal, the English- language debate on Monday, January 9, the French-language debate on January 10. The four participants were Liberal leader and incumbent prime minister Paul Martin, Conservative leader Stephen Harper, NDP leader Jack Layton, and Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe. The Conservatives were elected with a minority government, while the Liberals became official opposition. Bloc Québécois support remained mostly stagnant, while the NDP made modest gains. ==2008 debates== { style=\\"border: solid 1px #bbb; margin: 0 0 0 1.4em; float:right; font-size:90%; text-align:center\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\"  Party leaders and participants - Conservative leader, Stephen Harper Liberal leader, Stéphane Dion Jack Layton, leader of the NDP - Stephen Harper Conservative Stéphane Dion Liberal Jack Layton NDP - Gilles Duceppe, leader of the Bloc Québécois 100px Elizabeth May, leader of the Green Party - Gilles Duceppe, Bloc Québécois  Elizabeth May, Green - } Two debates took place during the 2008 election. The French- language debate was on October 1 from 8:00 to 10:00 p.m. EDT and was moderated by Stéphan Bureau. The English-language debate was held the following evening, from 9:00 to 11:00 p.m. EDT, and was moderated by Steve Paikin. Both were held at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa.News Release – 2008 Leaders' Debate, September 8, 2008 The timing of the English debate, at exactly the same time as the previously-scheduled U.S. vice presidential debate, means that Canadian networks did not have to preempt any popular simulcast American programming in order to carry the domestic broadcast. Sources close to the consortium reported that this was indeed a key motivation for choosing the October 2 date. The five participants were Conservative leader and incumbent prime minister Stephen Harper, Liberal leader Stéphane Dion, NDP leader Jack Layton, Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe, and Green Party leader Elizabeth May. The consortium had announced that the Greens would again be excluded from the debates even though sitting MP Blair Wilson had crossed the floor to the Greens just prior to dissolution. Two parties, the Conservatives and the NDP, opposed the inclusion of the Green Party, citing a deal struck between the Green Party and Liberals where the Liberals would not run in Green Party leader Elizabeth May's riding, Central Nova, and the Green party in Liberal leader Stéphane Dion's riding, Saint-Laurent—Cartierville. Stephen Harper and Jack Layton said that if the Green Party were included, they would not participate in the Leaders' Debates. Dion said that while he supports May's inclusion, he would not attend if the prime minister did not, and the Bloc Québécois said it never threatened to boycott the debates. The media consortium in charge of the debate decided that it would prefer to broadcast the debates with the four major party leaders, rather than risk not at all. The Green Party indicated it would lodge a formal complaint with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). Tony Burman, a former CBC News Chief and Chair of the Network Consortium, called the process \\"a sham\\" and called for an independent body to govern the debates. A considerable public outcry resulted, with extensive coverage on TV, radio, and websites. The NDP leader in particular came under pressure from his own members and supporters. Former prime minister Joe Clark called for May to be included. On September 10, the Conservatives and NDP announced they no longer opposed May's participation; shortly thereafter, the consortium invited May to participate.Broadcast Consortium to invite Elizabeth May to participate in 2008 Leaders' Debates, press release, September 10, 2008 ===Format and draw results=== The following format was to be followed for the 2008 debates:Broadcast Consortium press release, September 19, 2008 *Each leader will have 45 seconds for an opening statement, and the same length for a closing statement. *The debates will each be divided into eight themed segments (one question per theme). The leaders will be informed of the themes, but not the questions, five days prior to the debates. *Questions will be posed by Canadians via pre-taped segments. These will be selected from questions submitted to the consortium via email. *For each question, each leader will have 45 seconds to respond, followed by eight minutes of open debate. The parties and the consortium later agreed to allot additional time to the economy because of the 2008 global economic crisis.

The English-language debate was held on April 12, 2011 from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m. EDT, and was moderated by Steve Paikin. The French-language debate was held on April 13 from 8:00 to 10:00 p.m. EDT and was co-moderated by Paul Larocque and Anne- Marie Dussault. Both were held at the Government Conference Centre in Ottawa.News Article – Canadians heard our message: Leaders, April 12, 2011 After the original date was chosen for the French debate, a Montreal Canadiens playoff hockey game was scheduled for the same day, causing the debate to be moved one night forward. The four participants in both debates were Conservative leader and incumbent prime minister Stephen Harper, Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, NDP leader Jack Layton, and Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe. Green Party leader Elizabeth May was excluded from the debate by the media consortium, as her party did not have representation in the House of Commons.News Article – Leaders' debates set without May, March 30, 2011 The English debate was best known for Layton's attack on Ignatieff for having the worst House of Commons attendance record of any of the party leaders. Layton said, \\"You know, most Canadians, if they don't show up for work, they don't get a promotion.\\" This quote has been compared to Brian Mulroney's \\"You had an option, sir — you could have said 'no'.\\" rebuttal to John Turner. The new Conservative Party won its first majority mandate, and the NDP formed the official opposition for the first time with 103 seats. Conservative gains came mostly at the expense of the Liberals in the GTA, while NDP gains came from equally from the Bloc Quebecois, Liberals and Conservatives in Quebec, and to a lesser extent from the Liberals in Ontario (primarily Toronto). The Liberals came in third (34 seats and less than 19% of the vote), while the Bloc Québécois was reduced to only 4 seats. The Greens won their first seat in British Columbia. ==2015 debates== { style=\\"border: solid 1px #bbb; margin: 0 0 0 1.4em; float:right; font-size:90%; text-align:center\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\"  Party leaders and participants - Conservative leader, Stephen Harper Thomas Mulcair, leader of the NDP Liberal leader, Justin Trudeau - Stephen Harper, Conservative Thomas Mulcair, NDP Justin Trudeau, Liberal - Gilles Duceppe, leader of the Bloc Québécois 100px Elizabeth May, leader of the Green Party - Gilles Duceppe, Bloc Québécois  Elizabeth May, Green - } Traditionally, party leaders participated in at least two nationally televised debates during the federal election – at least one each in English and French. These debates were produced by a consortium of Canada's major television networks. In May 2015, the Conservatives said they would not participate in the consortium debates and instead would take part in as many as five independently staged debates in the run-up to the fall federal election. Ultimately, the Conservatives agreed to participate in a French- language debate organized by the consortium of broadcasters as one of their five debates. The New Democratic Party confirmed that Tom Mulcair would accept every debate where the Prime Minister was present. The NDP had previously confirmed their intention to participate in both of the consortium debates before Stephen Harper withdrew but ultimately only participated in the French language consortium debate which included the Conservatives. Liberal leader Justin Trudeau attended the Maclean's, Globe and Mail, and French consortium debates; and the Liberals confirmed he would attend the other debates. The Bloc Québécois attended the French language consortium debate and confirmed their attendance at the French-language TVA debate. The Green Party attended the Maclean's and French language consortium debates, and confirmed their intention to participate in the English language consortium debate. Strength in Democracy, which had the same number of seats in the House of Commons at dissolution as the Greens and Bloc Québécois, were not invited to participate in any of the televised debates. The leaders of the party objected to their exclusion and launched a petition demanding that all parties represented in Parliament be invited to the debates. Other minor parties without representation in the House of Commons were not invited to participate in any of the televised debates. Completed televised debates: {  - ! Subject !! Participants !!

Two official debates were organized and held by the newly created Leaders' Debates Commission. The English language debate took place on October 7 and the French on October 10. Both debates took place at the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Quebec. On August 12, 2019, the Commissioner extended invitations for Justin Trudeau, Andrew Scheer, Jagmeet Singh, Elizabeth May and Yves-François Blanchet to attend. He also sent a letter to Maxime Bernier indicating that he did not qualify for the debates at that time, and asked for additional information from the People's Party so that a final decision could be reached by September 16. Bernier criticized the decision saying that it would not be a \\"real debate\\" without him. On September 16, the Commission announced that Bernier would be invited to attend the official debates. The government established rules in 2018 to determine which party leaders are invited to the official debates. To be invited a party must satisfy two of the following: # Have at least one member elected under the party's banner; # Nominate candidates to run in at least 90% of all ridings; and # Have captured at least 4% of the votes in the previous election or be considered by the commissioner to have a legitimate chance to win seats in the current election, based on public opinion polls. In November 2018, Minister of Democratic Institutions Karina Gould said that Maxime Bernier would qualify for the debates as leader of the People's Party of Canada if the party nominated candidates in 90% of ridings.

It was moderated by Pierre Bruneau. Trudeau committed to attending, after the date was moved forward from the originally scheduled date of October 16. Neither Elizabeth May nor Maxime Bernier were invited due to them not having elected an MP under their respective parties' banners in Quebec. Following the debate, political commentators praised the performances of Trudeau, Singh and Blanchet. The winner varied depending on the analyst, but general consensus was that Andrew Scheer had performed poorly. Based on a poll they conducted, David Colleto from Abacus Data came to the conclusion that Andrew Scheer did not have a good night, that Blanchet and Trudeau could split the spoils of victory and that Mr. Singh performed well and francophones responded favourably to what they saw, but that it may not be enough to boost NDP fortunes in Quebec.

McDynamo was sired by Dynaformer. == Background == Foaled April 6, 1997, McDynamo was a son of Dynaformer, who sired 25 Grade 1 winners, including Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro. His dam was Rondonia, a daughter of Irish champion Monteverdi. Rondonia also produced Old Chapel, a graded stakes-winning full-brother to McDynamo, and Radonezh (by Barkersville), a graded stakes winner in Russia. McDynamo was bred in Kentucky by Richard Fox, Nathan Fox, and Richard Kaster. He was later bought by Michael Moran for $82,000 at the Keeneland yearling sale in September of 1998. ==Racing Career == As a three-year-old, McDynamo came in seventh at the Pimlico Race Course in May 2000 in his debut race. He won his next start at Pimlico at 1½-miles, but had just two more starts before being sidelined for a year after surgery to remove a hind ankle chip. He won only one of five races as a four-year-old. After unsuccessful efforts at Saratoga Race Course (ridden by Pat Day) and Belmont Park, Moran turned McDynamo to Sanna Hendriks, who specializes in training steeplechasers. McDynamo won his first jump race by 4¼-lengths at Far Hills Races on October 20, 2001. The 2004 running of the Grade 1 $175,000 Breeders' Cup Steeplechase saw McDynamo, then a 7-year-old gelding coming back for his first race in 11 months after recovering from hock surgery, win the race for a second consecutive year, defeating Hirapour by 1½ lengths in a finishing time of 5:06.8. The race covered a 2⅝-mile distance and jumps over 14 fences. The crowd was estimated at 45,000.\\"McDynamo wins second straight Breeders' Cup Steeplechase\\", USA Today, October 23, 2004.

McDynamo was humanely euthanized on December 1, 2019 at the age of 22; he had been suffering from arthritis and general infirmities of old age. “Nothing in particular happened,” Neilsen said. “He had one stifle that bothered him, and it was just arthritic and whatever and there was nothing to do to it. It got harder to keep weight on him, he never did well in the wintertime. He looked a little unsteady behind to me and he wasn’t going to get any better. He was happy and comfortable and everything. I was nervous with the weather coming in – he’d have a hard time on frozen ground – and it felt like the right thing to do.” He was buried on the farm. == References  * McDynamo's pedigree Category:1997 racehorse births Category:American steeplechase racehorses Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Eclipse Award winners Category:United States Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame inductees ","title":"McDynamo"},{"id":"19248855","text":"Angola first competed at the Summer Paralympic Games in 1996, and has competed in every edition of the Summer Paralympics since then.

The network is currently operated jointly by the Sabres (Pegula Sports and Entertainment) and by Entercom Communications. Rick Jeanneret is the network's primary play-by- play voice and has served in that capacity since 1971, with Rob Ray currently serving as color commentator. In the 2008-2009 season, former Winnipeg Jets/Phoenix Coyotes broadcaster Curt Keilback covered for Jeanneret during the team's western road trip. In the 2009-2010 season, the Sabres did not send their television broadcast crew on the western road trip and used the local broadcasts of the Phoenix Coyotes, Anaheim Ducks, Los Angeles Kings and Vancouver Canucks as the \\"home\\" broadcast. Jeanneret and then color commentator Harry Neale had reduced duties for 2011-2012, with the duo only handling home games and a third of the road games; Kevin Sylvester and Danny Gare handled the broadcasts of the remaining games that season. The radio network's postgame show is hosted by WGR personality Brian Koziol. Mike Schopp and Chris \\"Bulldog\\" Parker host the pre-game show, which airs only on WGR. On television, a pregame show and postgame show are broadcast, and hosted by Brian Duff and Martin Biron. (Prior to 2005, the television pregame-postgame shows were simulcast on radio. The postgame was known as Hockey Hotline and hosted by Mike Robitaille, first with host Brian Blessing and then Josh Mora.) The theme song for broadcasts has been the \\"Sabre Dance\\" by Aram Khachaturian since the team's debut. From the 2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs through the 2009-10 season, the team used for its main theme an instrumental cut of \\"Hurricane 2000,\\" an orchestral arrangement of the song \\"Rock You Like a Hurricane\\" recorded by Scorpions and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra on the album Moment of Glory. From the 1990s through 2006 the team used a custom-made theme. Beginning shortly after Terry Pegula's acquisition of the team, the song was changed back to \\"Sabre Dance.\\" For the 2011-12 season, a hard-rock version of \\"Sabre Dance\\" rotates with MSG Network's standard hockey theme as the theme for the Sabres Hockey Network broadcasts. ==Current Radio Network== *WGR 550 AM Buffalo, NY (flagship station) *WCMF 96.5 FM Rochester, NY *WROC 950 AM Rochester, NY (only when not in conflict with Rochester Americans games) *WQRS 98.3 FM Salamanca/Olean, NY *WBTA 1490 AM Batavia, NY *WQFX 103.1 FM Russell, PA (Jamestown, NY/Warren, PA area) *WDOE 1410 AM Dunkirk, NY *WMTT 820 AM Elmira, NY *WOTT 94.1 FM Watertown, NY *WQTK 92.7 FM Ogdensburg, NY ==Television== The Sabres Hockey Network has produced Sabres games since the team's days on the Empire Sports Network; Empire and the Sabres were both under the control of John Rigas from 1996 until Rigas's arrest in 2003.

The play-by- play and commentary is radio simulcasted over video, an arrangement unique in the National Hockey League. The other 12 games air only on the radio network, including all games broadcast on the league's national outlets. In New York City and the surrounding areas, Sabres games against the New York Rangers, New York Islanders or New Jersey Devils (other hockey teams to which MSG owns TV rights) have usually carried the Sabres Hockey Network feed on the SAP of MSG or MSG Plus. The Sabres also have the capabilities to broadcast preseason home games on the team's Web site. MSG Western New York is carried on DirecTV, channel 635-1. The network is also available on Charter Spectrum, the predominant cable provider in New York State. The channel is available on Verizon FiOS, with high-definition feeds only arriving in late 2011 after a protracted legal dispute in which MSG refused to provide Verizon with an HD feed. The channel and therefore most Sabres games are not available on Dish Network due to a years-long continuing carriage dispute between the Dish and MSG Networks. Starting with the 2013-14 season, Bell Satellite TV began re- broadcasting MSG broadcasts into Canada in areas within 50 miles of KeyBank Center (the Niagara Peninsula territory east of Hamilton) on channel 442 which is dubbed \\"Sabres TV\\" at the moment by Bell. Local telecasts of Sabres games had not been available in Canada since they moved to cable with the Empire Sports Network's launch in 1991, even though the area is in the Sabres' territory; international regulatory hurdles had to be cleared before the games could be broadcast across the border. The announcement of the expansion to a full channel did not indicate if or when the additional programs in question will be carried in Canada. In the past, single games were sold to one of the Buffalo broadcast stations (WGRZ-TV, WIVB-TV, WUTV and WKBW-TV), usually games played on Saturdays. This has happened only once since MSG took over the broadcast contract: WGRZ and WHEC-TV were given rights to simulcast MSG's coverage of the February 11, 2012 game between the Sabres and the Tampa Bay Lightning, as a one-time goodwill gesture in the ongoing dispute between Time Warner Cable and MSG; the two sides had an approximately 1½-month contract dispute that left games unavailable on cable for most of the state.MSG to allow Channel 2 to air Sabres game The Buffalo News, February 6, 2012 Games carried by NBC Sports Network, NBC, and CBC Television are not produced by the Sabres, and these television broadcasts are not considered to be part of the Sabres Hockey Network.

The Rochester situation is unique in that a different station carries regular season games than in the postseason. This is because WROC has a much weaker AM signal, and the network switched to FM station WBZA to maximize coverage during the postseason. In 2008, with Entercom's purchase of WCMF, Sabres games moved to that station instead. Since 1997, the radio play-by-play has been simulcast on the station's cable partner (Empire Sports Network from 1997 to 2004, and MSG Network/MSG Western New York from 2005 to the present). Prior to this, Ted Darling was the team's television play-by- play voice, though he was forced to retire due to Pick's disease in 1991. John Gurtler did TV play-by-play from 1991 to 1995, and Rick Jeanneret took over those duties from that point, adding radio simulcasts in 1997. Unlike most shows on MSG Network, the Sabres control all television broadcasts of their games. ==See also== *MSG Western New York, the TV broadcaster of the Sabres ==References *Buffalo Sabres Official Site - Sabres Hockey Network Radio network Category:National Hockey League on television Category:National Hockey League on the radio Category:Simulcasts Category:Entercom Category:Sports radio networks in the United States Category:Pegula Sports and Entertainment ","title":"Sabres Hockey Network"},{"id":"19248882","text":"KSBS may refer to: * KSBS-FM, a radio station (92.1 FM) licensed to serve Pago Pago, American Samoa * KSBS-CD, a low-power digital television station (channel 19, virtual 10) licensed to serve Denver, Colorado, United States * the ICAO code for Steamboat Springs Airport ","title":"KSBS"},{"id":"19248886","text":"Dararweyne is a town in south-central Sanaag in Somaliland . ==References *Dararweyne Category:Populated places in Sanaag ","title":"Dararweyne"},{"id":"19248887","text":"The Unterrothon (or simply Rothorn) is a mountain of the Swiss Pennine Alps, overlooking Zermatt in the canton of Valais.

Since its founding in 1947, the AAA Foundation has sponsored over 200 projects related to highway safety, covering topics such as distracted, impaired, and drowsy driving; road rage; graduated driver licensing; driver's education and training; and pedestrian safety. The AAA Foundation research agenda is centered on four priority areas: Driver behavior and performance, emerging technologies, roadway systems and drivers and vulnerable road users. Research in each of these areas is intended to identify the causes and consequences of motor vehicle crashes, evaluate possible countermeasures and solutions, and offer recommendations for achieving the overarching goal of preventing injuries and fatalities on the nation's highways. Research findings are communicated to policymakers, safety partners, and the media, and are used to develop public educational materials, such as brochures, handbooks, videos, and computer games/software. These products are designed to help drivers understand the potential hazards they will face on the road - such as work zones, railroad crossings, and inclement weather - and hone the skills needed to manage these risks and arrive at their destinations safely. The AAA Foundation is also recognized as a leader in promoting the idea of Traffic Safety Culture; that is, a social climate in which traffic safety is highly valued and rigorously pursued. Since 2008, the AAA Foundation has published its annual Traffic Safety Culture Index in an effort to benchmark and track key indicators of the public's beliefs and attitudes toward highway safety. Information is collected through a nationally representative telephone survey that measures both attitudes and behaviors regarding, among other things, drinking and driving, cell phone use/texting behind the wheel, speeding, and seatbelt use. AAA Foundation projects have also been used to help strengthen laws, build public awareness of safety concerns and trends, and advise transportation agencies and highway departments on roadway improvement needs. For example, a 2006 report, Safety Impacts of Pavement Edge Drop-offs documented and analyzed the effects such drop-offs have on roadway departure crashes. The study was cited by the Federal Highway Administration's Office of Safety in its promotion of a cost-effective technology known as the Safety Edge, one of nine countermeasures FHWA considers proven to reduce motor vehicle crashes and improve safety.FHWA Guidance Memo on Proven Crash Countermeasures, July 2008 ==References * AAA.com * The U.S. Road Assessment Program * Federal Highway Administration Office of Safety Category:Charities based in Washington, D.C.

In the June 1998 Sokcho submarine incident, a North Korean submarine was found in South Korean waters off Sokcho entangled in fishing nets, the submarine was towed to a South Korean navy base and sunk while in tow. When recovered from 30m of water and opened the crew were all dead in an apparent murder-suicide. Another infiltration occurred in July when a dead commando and abandoned infiltration craft was discovered near the city of Donghae. ==Battle== On December 17, 1998, a ten-ton North Korean I-SILC-class semi-submersible infiltration vessel was observed by a South Korean guard post about 2 km off the coast of Yeosu and ROK Navy ships were scrambled to intercept it. After several warnings were given, the ROK Navy fired warning shots at the semi-submersible. The North Korean craft ignored the warnings and opened fire on the South Korean vessels. It then attempted to escape, fleeing southwest while being tracked by patrol planes and boats, but several hours later it had sunk in of water approximately 100 km south of Geoje Island. ==Aftermath== The South Korean navy attempted to recover the bodies of the dead North Koreans and pieces of the infiltration craft. The body of one North Korean frogman was found. From the size and type of the vessel it was assumed that the entire crew consisted of four sailors and that all had died. Searches were also conducted on nearby land to make sure that infiltrators had not landed on the coastline. When questioned, the North Korean government denied sending the vessel or knowing anything about its origins. This incident helped fuel increasing tensions between the two governments and an even larger naval skirmish was fought the next year. The North Korean regime's Korean Central News Agency issued a statement on December 19, 1998: > The South Korean puppets said that they located a \\"submarine\\" in the sea off > Ryosu, South Jolla Province, at 11:15 p.m. on December 17 and had a battle > in which the \\"submarine\\" was sunken and they brought a dead body clad in > diving-suit to the land. They also said that they issued an order called > \\"Jindogae nN.1\\" throughout the coastal areas of South Korea and have been > put on the red alert.

The district was named for the inner western Perth suburb of Subiaco, which fell within its borders. It was normally a safe seat for the Liberal Party and its predecessors, but was won on several occasions by Labor in landslide elections. Subiaco was a new seat created under the Constitution Acts Amendment Act 1899, which took effect at the 1901 election, where it was won by Labor candidate Henry Daglish. In 1903, he became leader of the eight-member Parliamentary Labor Party, succeeding Robert Hastie, and in a want of confidence motion on 10 August 1904 following the 1904 election, he became premier at the head of a minority government supported by four independents. His government collapsed just over a year later, and Daglish resigned from the Labor Party. After accepting the post of Chairman of Committees of the Legislative Assembly in 1907, he joined the Ministerial faction of the party, later becoming Minister for Works. He was unexpectedly defeated by a relatively unknown Labor candidate, Bartholomew James Stubbs, at the 1911 election. Stubbs held the seat until his death in overseas combat on 26 September 1917, following which a Nationalist candidate, Samuel Brown, won the seat at a by-election. He was defeated at the 1921 election by the National Labor candidate, Walter Richardson—the only occasion on which the party ever gained a seat it did not already hold at an election. Richardson held the seat until the 1933 election, where in circumstances not dissimilar to 1911, he lost the seat to a Labor candidate. However, it was regained three years later for the Nationalists by Florence Cardell-Oliver, who went on to hold the seat for 20 years. On her retirement, Labor candidate Percival Potter won the seat at the 1956 election—a landslide for Labor—for a single term. Hugh Guthrie held the seat until his retirement in 1971, and was followed by local GP Dr Tom Dadour. The seat's final member, elected after Dadour's retirement, was Carmen Lawrence, later to become Premier. The seat was abolished at the 1989 election and its voters were divided between the new seat of Glendalough and the existing seats of Floreat and Nedlands. While the namesake suburb was transferred to Nedlands, Lawrence transferred to Glendalough. ==Members for Subiaco== {  - !colspan=\\"2\\"Member!!Party!!Term -    rowspan=3  Henry Daglish  Labour  1901–1905 -  bgcolor=#E2725B   Independent Labour  1905–1908 -    Ministerial  1908–1911 -    Bartholomew Stubbs  Labor  1911–1917 -    Samuel Brown  Nationalist  1917–1921 -    rowspan=2  Walter Richardson  National Labor  1921–1925 -    Nationalist  1925–1933 -    John Moloney  Labor  1933–1936 -    rowspan=3  Florence Cardell- Oliver  Nationalist  1936–1945 -    Liberal  1945–1949 -    Liberal Country League  1949–1956 -    Percival Potter  Labor  1956–1959 -    rowspan=\\"2\\" Hugh Guthrie  Liberal Country League  1959–1968 -    Liberal  1968–1971 -    rowspan=2  Dr Tom Dadour  Liberal  1971–1984 -    Independent  1984–1986 -    Dr Carmen Lawrence  Labor  1986–1989 } ==See also== * Subiaco, Western Australia ==References== Category:Former electoral districts of Western Australia ","title":"Electoral district of Subiaco"},{"id":"19248960","text":"Louis-Simon Auger (29 December 1772, in Paris – 2 January 1829, in Paris) was a French journalist, literary critic and playwright. == External links == * ** Lettres de Mmes. de Villars, de Coulanges et de La Fayette, de Ninon de L'Enclos et de Mademoiselle Aïssé accompagnées de notices bibliographiques, de notes explicatives par Louis-Simon Auger * Category:Members of the Académie Française Category:18th-century French journalists Category:19th-century French journalists Category:French male journalists Category:18th-century French dramatists and playwrights Category:19th-century French dramatists and playwrights Category:Writers from Paris Category:1772 births Category:1829 deaths Category:Suicides by drowning in France Category:19th-century French male writers Category:18th-century male writers ","title":"Louis-Simon Auger"},{"id":"19248977","text":"Royal Wootton Bassett Academy (RWBA) (formerly Wootton Bassett School) is a mixed secondary school and sixth form in the town of Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, England, for students aged 11 to 18. In July 2011, the school became an academy. == Facilities == The facilities include an AstroTurf sports pitch and numerous sports facilities catering for tennis, cricket, football, rugby and hockey. The sixth form centre has classrooms and a lecture theatre with retractable chairs, also used as a drama studio. == Administrative structure == Adopted in the early 2000s, the school employed a system of phases. There were three main categories, the 'Transition', 'Development' and 'Extension' phases, all of which were presided over by an Assistant Headteacher. This system has since been abolished, after proving unpopular with staff and drawing criticism as \\"corporate jargon\\". The school since returned to the traditional method of grouping students into Lower School, Upper School and Sixth Form. The school operates a system of tutor groups, each tutor having approximately 30 students. Tutors rarely teach students from their own group. The main role of groups is to create a stable peer system, with each aiming to tutor the same group throughout their 5 years, or 7 if they stay on for sixth form. The layout of the school is like two 'E's back to back, and a main corridor running down the middle, nicknamed 'The Street' by pupils and teachers alike. Each branch teaches a different subject, with wings of varying lengths, the longest three being Admin/Reception, School Hall and Gymnasium, Science and D&T.; Each floor within each wing also teaches a different subject, (e.g. the English wing is underneath the Maths wing). The Modern Foreign Languages wing used to be the shortest, under half the length of the others, until the sixth form centre was added. == The house system == RWBA's house system encapsulates the holistic approach the Academy takes to the development of its students and staff. There are five houses, co-ordinated by five heads of house, each named after the four \\"Bassetts\\": Winterbourne, Compton, Wootton, Berwick and Bassett. They compete in a year-long series of competitions and events such as team-building competitions, pumpkin carving, harvest festival basket designs, sports tournaments and £10 fund raising challenges. Fundraising for international, national and local charities plays an important part in competitions and provides the students with a sense of self in the world. The house system promotes a strong family sense of identity with the house, and with the Academy, and is widely valued by students and staff alike. == References  External links == * Category:Secondary schools in Wiltshire Category:Academies in Wiltshire Category:Royal Wootton Bassett ","title":"Royal Wootton Bassett Academy"},{"id":"19249010","text":"The cover of \\"Action Update\\" (August 16, 1979) showing Sam Brown (right), the Director of the Action Corps which administered the Peace Corps, Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) and other service programs.

The Making of the President Series as quoted by David Kaiser at history unfolding In 1967 Brown was the chairman of the National Student Association's national supervisory board. In 1967 Brown ran for president of the National Student Association and lost. Brown received a B.A. from the University of Redlands in 1965, an M.A. from Rutgers University in 1966, pursued graduate studies at Harvard University Divinity School from 1966–1968, and was a Fellow at the John F. Kennedy Institute of Politics, Harvard University, in 1969. ==National Student Association spokesman during the CIA National Student Association scandal== In 1967, Ramparts magazine reported that the CIA had been using the U.S. National Student Association (NSA) for intelligence gathering abroad.Agee Jr., Phil Campus Watch fall, 1991 pp. 12-13 courtesy of www.cia-on-campus.org As revealed by the then president of the organization, Philip Sherburne, in a conversation with the organization's finance director, Michael Wood, the CIA had been funneling money to the organization through various charity fronts in exchange for covert cooperation from students in the NSA's international programs.Ramparts Magazine. March, 1967. pp29-38. Reported by Sol Stern, with the special assistance of Lee Webb, Michael Ansara, and Michael Wood. Obtained via cia-on-campus.org As spokesman for the national NSA's national supervisory board at the time, Brown was particularly appalled by the predicament of members of the NSA's international programs: \\"The fantastic pressures these people were under were simply incomprehensible to me ... The agony of these people who were trapped and were unable to break this relationship was awful.\\"The New York Times. \\"Students Accuse C.I.A. of 'Trapping' Some Into Spying\\" by Ben. A. Franklin. February 18, 1967. Brown said that the supervisory board had no knowledge of the CIA's involvement until it was reported, announced that the NSA would assist in any investigation of the CIA's role, and said \\"The United States Government owes an unconditional apology to the N.S.A. for using the N.S.A. in this duplicitous manner.\\" ==Antiwar organizerVietnam Summer=== Brown first got involved in organizing during \\"Vietnam Summer\\" in 1967 when five hundred paid staffers and twenty-six thousand volunteers organized hundreds of grass roots antiwar projects. Brown was one of the volunteers who gained valuable experience during Vietnam Summer. \\"I know the first time that I ever went and knocked on somebody's door and waited for them to answer so that could tell them that I wanted to talk to them about the war was not an easy moment,\\" said Brown. Brown said that the volunteers gained valuable organizing skills that he and others would later apply during Eugene McCarthy's presidential bid. \\"To some extent the McCarthy campaign couldn't have happened without that,\\" said Brown.The War Within: America's Battle Over Vietnam By Tom Wells. Published by iUniverse, 2005. , ===Youth Coordinator for McCarthy for President=== Brown was the youth coordinator for Senator Eugene J. McCarthy's Presidential campaign. According to Tom Wells in his book The War Within Brown would sometimes entertain the notion that McCarthy could win the nomination \\"sometimes for up to thirty minutes at a stretch.\\"The War Within by Tom Wells. Published by iUniverse, 2005 p 225 The campaign's main appeal for Brown was that \\"it gave an opportunity and gave an excuse to walk up to people's doors and say, 'Hi. I'm Sam Brown. I'm here because I'd like to talk to you about the war in Vietnam - and about Gene McCarthy.'\\" Brown hoped that the McCarthy campaign would show people that protesters were \\"not some crazy minority.\\" In 2008 Brown's wife, Alison Teal, wrote about Brown's role at the 1968 Democratic Convention. \\"In 1968, my husband Sam was the liaison between the McCarthy campaign and the protesters and was eventually a defense witness at the Trial of the Chicago Seven,\\" wrote Teal. \\"Within the leadership of the 1968 convention, there were agents provocateurs from the Chicago police and the FBI.\\" Brown says that hard work is the secret for being a successful organizer. \\"You have to be willing to work for very long hours for very little remuneration,\\" says Brown. \\"But there's a great psychic remuneration.\\" \\"Sam has three great qualities,\\" said a friend in 1969. \\"He is willing to work every minute of every day. He is calm in the most tense crises. And he is a terribly, terribly nice, sweet person.\\" Brown said in 1969 that organizing is what he does best and that he does not want to become a celebrity. \\"The worst thing that can happen to an organizer is to become identified as a leader,\\" said Brown. \\"There s a terrific antileadership bias in the country now.\\" ===Coordinator for the Vietnam Moratorium Committee=== In April 1969 while Brown was a graduate student in ethics at Harvard Divinity School, Jerome Grossman came to Brown with the idea for a nationwide strike to protest the war in Vietnam. Brown liked the idea but suggested that instead of calling it a strike, that it be called a moratorium. In June 1969 Brown moved to Washington and set up the office of the Vietnam Moratorium Committee. David E. Rosembaum wrote in the New York Times in 1969 that Brown \\"is a young man with a genius for organizing who has been the prime mover behind the Vietnam Moratorium protests.\\" As part of organizing the moratorium, the group ran three full page advertisements in the New York Times for a total cost of $26,328. Brown drew a salary from the moratorium committee of $75 a week. One of Brown's roles in organizing the Moratorium was fund raising which Brown called \\"the most demeaning thing there is.\\" Nonetheless Brown went on fund raising trips and appeared on television as the moratorium's spokesman. Brown brought his contact lists from the McCarthy campaign with him to work on the Moratorium. \\"Lists are the guts of organizing,\\" says Brown. Brown's lists included people who had contributed to liberal causes in the past, community organizers, and a list of faculty members who had signed antiwar advertisements.New York Times. \\"the Moratorium Organizers: Cluttered Precision\\" by David E. Rosenbaum. October 9, 1969. On October 15, 1969 an estimated two million people took part in the moratorium in what may have been the largest US demonstration of all time. On November 15, 1969 a crowd estimated at 250,000 had a massive demonstration at the Washington Monument.[New York Times. \\"Moratorium Group to Disband; Says Public s Tired of Protest\\" by David E. Rosenbaum. April 19, 1970. After the November 15 demonstration the energy in the movement seemed to dissipate. Observers attributed the apathy to President Nixon's November 3 speech in which he outlined his plan for \\"Vietnamization\\" of the Vietnam war. Brown called Nixon's speech \\"a tremendous political coup by managing to identify himself with the cause of peace.\\" The organizers said that the demonstrations had been at least a partial success and took some credit for Nixon's troop withdrawals and the dismissal of the head of Selective Service, General Lewis B. Hershey. The New York Times reported that the committee was $100,000 in debt. Brown said he hoped to make up the deficit through several \\"peace concerts.\\" The Moratorium Committee announced on April 19, 1970 that it was disbanding and the organizers said that money had dried up and the \\"political fad\\" of large demonstrations had run its course. The four national coordinators including Brown said that they each planned to continue antiwar activities on their own. Brown said that he planned to write a manual on how to organize. \\"You'd be surprised how many people don't know how to draw up a telephone tree, set up an office, call a press conference,\\" said Brown. \\"I want to tell them how to do this.\\" ===Storefront Organizing: A Mornin' Glories' Manual=== In 1972 Brown published Storefront Organizing: A Mornin' Glories' Manual.Storefront Organizing: A Mornin' Glories' Manual By Sam Brown. Published by Pyramid Books, 1972. , Brown dedicated the book to Jesse Unruh \\"who taught me the importance of organization\\" and to Gene McCarthy who showed Brown that \\"there are some things worth organizing for.\\" The book is a compendium of some of the basics of organizing \\"to help and encourage people who want to organize.\\" Brown doesn't claim the book s definitive because \\"imagination and inventiveness are the prime ingredients of organizing.\\" Brown says he wrote the book to be effective regardless of one's ideological point of view. However, Brown states that \\"the bias is against the status quo, rather than for it\\" because \\"the few have always been well organized, the many have never been organized and have never had a voice. Grassroots organization is the way to change that.\\" Brown's book contains the nuts and bolts of grassroots organizing including discussion of such topics as establishing a storefront, finding support in your community, planning programs, getting out crowds, handling the press, fundraising, planning rallies, and canvasing and getting out the vote. ===Post-organizing activities=== Brown worked as a consultant for the FUND for Neighborhood Development from 1972-1973. Brown was Vice President of Brown's Better Shoes from 1970 to 1974. ===Election as treasurer of Colorado=== Brown was elected state treasurer of Colorado and served in the position from 1975 to 1977. ==ACTION director== Sam Brown was appointed director of the Action by President Jimmy Carter in 1977. Brown was appointed Director of ACTION by President Jimmy Carter in 1977.Webster University. \\"CAROLYN ROBERTSON PAYTON\\" (1925 - 2001). Anthony Lake, a member of president Carter's transition committee, recalled \\"Sam was very good at pushing his point of view with sufficient flexibility so he could make deals and stick with them. He has very deeply held and decent principles, but he is practical enough to move them along.\\"Chaplin, Gordon \\"Action's where the Peace Corps Is\\" from the Washington Post, February 5, 1978 pp. SM9 Action Corps had been created in 1971 by President Richard Nixon to administer the Peace Corps, Volunteers in Service to America and other service programs.New York Times. \\"Nixon Submits Plan to Merge 9 Volunteer Programs\\" by Jack Rosenthal. March 24, 1971. ===Changes in ACTION mission=== Seven months into his tenure as ACTION director, Brown released a blueprint for change, declaring \\"the mission of Action is to mobilize people for voluntary action at home and abroad to change the conditions that deny fulfillment of human needs by calling on the best and most creative instincts of the human spirit.\\" Brown's outline for the new direction of the organization included: *VISTA volunteers were to reemphasize community organizing and advocacy. *Decision-making in VISTA programs would be controlled by local offices rather than state or regional ones. *There would be a workplace democracy program within ACTION *The peace corps would refocus on \\"basic human needs.\\" ===Appointment and resignation of Carolyn Payton and surrounding controversy=== After a five-month search for a new director of the peace corps, in which Brown offered the job to Rafer Johnson, then-representative Ron Dellums of California, Jane Hart – the widow of former Senator Philip Hart – and LaDonna Harris, Brown appointed Carolyn Payton as director of the Peace Corps.The New York Times Headliners section, November 26th, 1979. Brown clashed with Payton from the start. And after only thirteen months in the position, in November 1979, Brown asked for her resignation. She initially agreed to resign, then withdrew her resignation and issued a statement that implied she would not leave unless asked directly by president Carter, who asked for her resignation shortly thereafter. Payton cited, in part, policy differences between ACTION and the Peace Corps saying \\"as Director, I could not, because of the peculiar administrative structure under which the Peace Corps operates, do anything about this situation. As an ex-director, I am free to sound the alarm.\\" Future congressman John Lewis, then the associate director of ACTION under Brown, wrote that the conflict between Brown and Payton was entirely over policy: \\"The resignation of Carolyn Payton stemmed from regrettable – but nonetheless honest and unreconcilable – differences with the administration concerning policy and philosophy.Lewis, John \\"'Unfounded Rumors' about ACTION\\" The Washington Post, February 18, 1979. Controversy after Payton's resignation Many of the policy issues between Payton and Brown were revealed after her resignation. Brown for example announced that the Peace Corps would only work in the poorest countries based on GNP and announced that the Peace Corps would pull out of countries that did not meet its criteria for aid.'All You Need is Love: The Peace Corps and the Spirit of the 1960s by Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman. Published by Harvard University Press, 1998 , Peace Corps Director Payton responded that \\"Whether or not we could find satisfactory jobs for volunteers was a better criteria than how much money a country has ... It's offensive to me to tell a host country what their needs are.\\" According to Payton, Brown wanted to \\"send volunteers for short periods to developing countries and then bring back the skills they had learned to fight poverty in the United States\\". She also claimed that Brown's policy went against the original goals of the Peace Corps and said that Brown was \\"trying to turn the corps into an arrogant, elitist political organization intended to meddle in the affairs of foreign governments.\\" In 1994, during the confirmation hearings for Brown's later ambassadorship to the CSCE, Payton's resignation was interpreted in two very different ways by his supporters and opponents. According to the 44 Senators who later rejected the motion for cloture on Brown's appointment as ambassador to the CSCE (the Senators who opposed his nomination), Brown was undiplomatic and unjustified in dismissing Payton. They claimed, that Payton's differences with Brown ended in an argument during a trip to Morocco, when Brown openly berated Dr. Payton before Action Corps officials and Brown's \\"attacks culminated with a midnight phone-call demanding her resignation, which she refused to give, after which he went to her hotel room and pounded on her door for a full fifteen minutes, demanding to be let in to continue his harassment\\". According to those 56 Senators in support of the cloture motion (and, presumably, of Brown's nomination): > Criticisms of Mr. Brown's performance at this agency are unfounded. In the > 1970s, Senator Simon (who was then Representative Simon), held extensive > hearings on the operation of the ACTION Agency. A few problems were > uncovered, but they were long-standing problems that were eventually > corrected by Mr. Brown, and the hearings produced no direct criticism of his > performance. The final result of those hearings was that Congress decided he > was doing an exemplary job, and it increased the agency's budget by 20 > percent. ===Appointment of Richard Celeste as Peace Corps Director and internal restructuring=== After Payton's resignation, Richard Celeste was appointed the new Peace Corps Director on April 27, 1979. According to P. David Searles in his book the Peace Corps Experience: \\"Under Celeste the agency was given considerable autonomy to direct its own affairs,\\" wrote Searles, \\"although strictly speaking it remained under the Action umbrella.\\"The Peace corps Experience By P. David Searles.

I see the movement people gearing up, the same familiar faces, and I want to say, 'Hold on, hold on.' It's a wholly different situation that needs to be analyzed on its own merits.\\"New York Times. \\" The Vietnam Generation Surrenders Its Certainty\\" by Jane Gross. January 15, 1991. ==Head of delegation to the CSCE and OSCE== Margaret Carlson reported in Time Magazine in 1994 that President Clinton had appointed Brown Ambassador to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), a 52-nation organization in Vienna that mediates conflicts in the former Soviet republics and promotes human rights, and that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had held hearings on Brown on November 18, 1993 and approved his nomination by a vote of 11 to 9. Before Brown's nomination could come to a Senate vote, Republicans Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Hank Brown of Colorado sent Brown a barrage of over 100 questions including why Brown had dropped a requirement that Peace Corps volunteers be instructed in the menace of communism and whether Brown had thrown any objects, \\"including human feces,\\" at the 1968 Democratic Convention. \\"No one understands why Hank Brown has decided to make Sam Brown his nemesis,\\" wrote Carlson. \\"Some think Hank Brown simply wants to zing the President, refight the Vietnam War and triumph over an old rival. (Sam Brown was treasurer of Colorado; Hank Brown was a member of the state legislature.)\\" Brown's supporters were unable to overcome a Republican-led filibuster against giving ambassadorial rank to Brown and President Clinton went ahead with Brown's appointment without senate approval.The Washington Post. \\"Deadlock Prevails In Senate; Sam Brown Backers Fail to End Debate\\" by Helen Dewar. May 26, 1994. Brown served as the Head of Delegation, without the rank of ambassador, to the US Mission to the OSCE in Vienna. On November 17, 1997, President Clinton awarded Brown the personal rank of Ambassador in his capacity as the Head of Delegation to the 1997 OSCE Ministerial Preparatory conferences, an appointment that does not require Senate confirmation.History of the Department of State During the Clinton Presidency (1993-2001)\\" Appendix 4: Clinton Appointments (1993-2000), Personal Rank of Ambassador As head of delegation Brown defended the CSCE as an alternative to NATO in shaping European security.International Herald Tribune. \\"Q&A;: U.S. and Russian Differences on European Stability\\" by Joseph Fitchett. October 10, 1994. \\"The CSCE is the natural multilateral forum, as the trans- Atlantic institution where Russia has an equal voice, for work on these questions. This is not war and peace in the traditional sense, but instability around Russia's borders. It's very different from what NATO does,\\" said Brown. \\"The CSCE doesn't have guns and is not going to have. It doesn't have the strength of NATO's unanimity. But NATO isn't equipped to handle some things we do.\\" Brown's tenure at the OSCE was greeted enthusiastically by his fellow representatives. Christos Botzios, the Greek Ambassador to the OSCE, said \\"He has added enormously to the prestige of the United States, as a country that cares about cooperation ... I think all my colleagues would agree with me.\\"The New York Times. Europe Agency Takes on the Fight for Democracy by Raymond Bonner. September 3rd, 1997. ==Later careerExecutive director of the Fair Labor Association (FLA)=== The Fair Labor Association (FLA) named Brown their Executive Director in January 2000. The Fair Labor Association is a non- profit organization designed to complement existing international and national labor laws that was created in 1999 after President Bill Clinton recognized the need for supervision over the apparel industry regarding issues of human rights. ===Role in 2004 election=== Brown worked to raise funds for John Kerry in the 2004 election and was not happy about the debate over Kerry's service in Vietnam. \\"I'm really upset that we're stuck on Vietnam,\\" he said, \\"but what really appalls me is that unlike 1968, when there was a real clash of ideas, this year we hear nothing from either candidate - not Bush, not Kerry - about what they propose to do to extract us from this awful mess in Iraq.\\" Thirty- six years after the idealism that produced the McCarthy insurgency, Brown said, \\"I see nasty, mean-spirited politics on all sides, the equivalent of the kind of scrum you see in the Chicago commodities pits.\\" The Los Angeles Times reported that Brown and his wife Alison Teal raised about $800,000 for the Kerry campaign including about $300,000 in \\"ideological money\\" from the East Bay area. Brown and his wife raised funds by hosting house parties for Kerry, seeking donations from strangers on the grocery line, and soliticiting from Teal's online blog. ==Personal== He married Alison Valentine Teal, born in 1945 in Omaha, Douglas County, Nebraska, the only daughter of Clarence W.

He was frequently ill as a child and this resulted in him being home-tutored. His father had authored numerous books about golf and this proved to be influential on Wethered as he took up golf from an early age. Wethered was called up in 1918 to serve in the Royal Artillery in World War I. However, he was recalled from France some weeks later as peacetime was declared. Upon his return he enrolled at Christ Church at Oxford University. He joined the Oxford golf team with Cyril Tolley, a good friend of his, and both were successful young golfers. His game was defined by great power and technique with iron clubs. His driving was less accomplished but his ability to recover more than made up for this shortcoming. He graduated from Oxford with a BA in English in 1921. ==Golfer== Wethered narrowly lost The Open Championship to Jock Hutchison in the 1921 edition of the tournament. Had he won the competition he would have been the last British amateur to do so. No British amateur had come so close since Harold Hilton won the 1897 Open Championship. He followed this achievement with further successes: his driving began to improve and he won his first Amateur Championship in 1923 at Deal, Kent. This was the peak of his sporting career. He continued to earn the respect of his peers for his modest demeanour. A runner up in the Amateur Championship twice (1928 and 1930), Wethered won the President's Putter five times. Furthermore, he was capped by England numerous times in competition against Scotland and in the Walker Cup against the United States, emerging victorious with regularity. In singles competition he beat all-comers, losing only to American golfer Bobby Jones. He continued to be involved in golf, however, working with the committee at The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. He was elected captain of the club in 1939 and finally took office in 1946. He was successful as an investor and upon his retirement he returned to the golf courses to play out his remaining days. At the age of 74 he scored a remarkable round of 74 at the Royal Wimbledon Golf Club. He died at his home at Garnet House, Wimbledon. ==Later life== Wethered's golfing abilities had begun to wane by the 1930s and his focus turned to his career as a stockbroker in London. He was married twice, but was childless. His first wife was Elizabeth, daughter of Lord Charles Cavendish-Bentinck (1868–1956), marriage dissolved in 1954. His second wife was Marjorie Stratford, whom he married in 1957. ==Results in major championshipsAmateur wins (1)=== { !Year!!Championship!!Winning Score!!Runner-up -  1923  The Amateur Championship  align=center7 & 6  Robert Harris } ===Results timeline=== { cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\\" - eeeeee;\\" !align=\\"left\\"Tournament !1920 !1921 !1922 !1923 !1924 !1925 !1926 !1927 !1928 !1929 - align=leftThe Open Championship eeeeee;\\" style=\\"background:yellow;\\"2 LA T32 eeeeee;\\" WD eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" CUT eeeeee;\\" - align=leftThe Amateur Championship R64 R256 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"QF style=\\"background:lime;\\"1 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"SF R128 R128 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"SF style=\\"background:yellow;\\"2 R128 - align=leftU.S. Amateur eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\"DNQ eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" } { cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\\" - eeeeee;\\" !align=\\"left\\"Tournament !1930 !1931 !1932 !1933 !1934 !1935 !1936 - align=leftThe Open Championship eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" - align=leftThe Amateur Championship style=\\"background:yellow;\\"2 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"R16 R128 R32 R32 eeeeee;\\" R32 - align=leftU.S. Amateur eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" } Note: Wethered only played in The Open Championship, The Amateur Championship, and U.S. Amateur.

It is open weekdays without charge. ==Overview== The garden was created in 1857 by Gustave Thuret (1817-1875), a botanist best known for studies of reproduction in algae, who used it to conduct plant acclimatization trials with friend and lichen expert Jean-Baptiste Édouard Bornet (1828-1911). In 1868, novelist George Sand described it in her Traveller's Letters as the loveliest garden she had ever seen. It was bequeathed to the nation in 1878, and in 1927 attached to the Institute of Agronomic Research, which in 1946 became the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA). Today the garden contains approximately 2,500 trees and shrubs in its collections, representing some 1,600 exotic species (144 genera, 131 families) from Mediterranean or hot climate countries including South Africa, Australia, California, Chile, and Mexico, as well as China, Japan, and New Zealand. About 50 to 100 new species are planted each year. The garden contains fine collections of cycads, conifers (with an exceptional collection of cypress), palms (30 species including excellent specimens of Jubaea), legumes (various species of Australian acacias), Mediterranean oaks, Australian Myrtaceae (Callistemon, Calothamnus, Eucalyptus, Melaleuca), a large collection of Pittosporum spp., and Proteaceae including Banksia, Grevillea, Hakea, and Leucadendron.

The small stream that runs along the bottom of the field where the school was built is called the Hreod Burna, from which the first school got its name. It is a term found in the Domesday Book entry for the locality and describes a minor tributary of the River Ray which still runs through the valley in which Nova Hreod Academy lies. Hreod Burna Senior High School was opened in 1966 for students aged 14 to 18, and had a sixth form. Initially, children were drawn from Moredon Secondary and Ferndale Secondary. The Head Teacher was Dr Blackwell, who remained at the school until 1984, just after New College opened to provide education for all sixth form students in the region. In 1983, Hreod Burna Senior High School amalgamated with Moredon Secondary School to form Hreod Parkway School, under the headship of Mr Cleall. Both Ferndale Secondary and Pinehurst Secondary were closed, and their buildings used for other activities by the local council. Hreod Parkway School began receiving pupils aged 11 to 16 from the same area covered by Hreod Burna Senior High School. However, it is widely acknowledged that a combination of council under-funding and the catchment area having a high number of low-income families unable to pick up the shortfall, were significant factors in Ofsted introducing special measures as a failing school in April 1996. ==Rebuilding== In 1997, Andrew Fleet took over as Head Teacher and set about repairing the school's academic reputation and rebuilding the campus, which had fallen into serious disrepair. The inspectors identified a number of areas of improvement since the last inspection in 1996. \\"The school was re-organised in 1998 so that the lower and upper schools were split either side of Akers Way. Plans were drawn up to completely rebuild the school. Mr Fleet introduced many new systems and procedures to raise standards, but these measures are yet to be applied consistently across the school by all teachers\\". \\"We have not suddenly started work on these problems since Ofsted visited\\", Fleet said, \\"We have been addressing our problems ever since I arrived, but in some areas progress has been slower than we'd hoped. Being in special measures will actually help us accelerate certain changes that we need to make, as it will enable greater intervention by the school and the LEA to address the problem areas\\". ==New campus== New school on Akers Way in January 2007 In Easter of 2007, Fleet achieved his goal when Hreod Parkway was vacated and everyone moved into the new campus built on an adjacent green field site. The new school was renamed Nova Hreod. Julie Tridgell became Headteacher in September 2008. In 2009, and again in 2016, GCSE results put Nova Hreod on the list of the most improved schools in the country. ==ULT Academy conversion and transformation== The school converted to Academy status during the 2013/14 school year, under the United Learning group. This conversion saw ULT's Darren Barton take over as Headteacher (Principal in ULT terms). In 2015 the school's headline GCSE measures doubled to 60%. The following year, this increased to 62% of students gaining at least five A*-C grades including English and Maths. In February 2017, Ofsted inspectors judged the school to be 'Good', the first time in the school's history that it had achieved such a rating. ==References * Category:Secondary schools in Swindon Category:Educational institutions established in 1966 Category:1966 establishments in England Category:Academies in Swindon Category:United Learning schools ","title":"Nova Hreod Academy"},{"id":"19249270","text":"Daisy Tourné in 2007 Daisy Tourné (born 1951) is a Uruguayan politician.'Daisy Tourné', Wikipedia (in Spanish) :es:Daisy Tourné ==Background== Tourné is an elementary school teacher and a social psychologist by profession. ===Frente Amplio associations=== She is aligned politically with the Frente Amplio movement, which has been in government office since 2005, headed by President of Uruguay Tabaré Vázquez. Between 1995 and 2007 Tourné served as a deputy for Montevideo, prior to taking up ministerial office. ===Family links=== Daisy Tourné is a niece to former Senator Uruguay Tourné, of the conservative National Party (Uruguay). ==Ministerial office== Between 2007 and June 2009 she served as Interior Minister in the government of President Tabaré Vázquez, the first woman to have been appointed to that post. Tourné succeeded José Díaz in the post in 2007. She was herself succeeded in her post in 2009 firstly as a temporary measure by Víctor Rossi, and then by Jorge Bruni as a permanent appointment. ===Visit of US President George W.

Bush, to whom a significant hostility among many of Ms. Tourné's Frente Amplio colleagues, raised in a tradition which magnifies Che Guevara and his Cuban fellow revolutionaries, was widely noted. This event occurred very shortly after her appointment to office. ===Controversies=== In 2008 the opposition Colorado Party Presidential front runner Pedro Bordaberry Herrán called on Tourné to resign. Bordaberry's call followed his publicly expressed doubts about what he claimed was Tourné's lack of commitment to her ministerial responsibility for public safety issues.Teledoce.com - Portal de noticias The criticism, which highlighted likely discourse during the 2009 Presidential elections, was rejected by Tourné. Resignation from Frente Amplio government However, Tourné eventually did resign on 4 June 2009. According to some reports, the President himself asked Tourné to resign the Ministry following the incident, while these reports were contradicted by others. The resignation occurred following some public gaffes, which included comments widely deemed indiscreet about former President Luis Alberto Lacalle.Biographical note: Mr. Lacalle is leader of her uncle Uruguay Tourné's National Party (Uruguay). She also made a widely noted personal comment re. former Vice President Luis Antonio Hierro López.Dimite la ministra del Interior en Uruguay tras un discurso soez This event came about 18 months after the Frente Amplio had disavowed another prominent member within its ranks for comparable comments made regarding the son of former President Lacalle. =Tourné and public debate on alleged 'crudeness' in political discourse= There followed a public debate on the supposed significance of 'crudeness', with some observers having regarded Ms. Tourné as having been unacceptably 'crude'.Spanish: 'soez'. In turn, the Uruguayan Socialist Party spokesman on the contrary accused the Opposition of 'crude machismo'.El PS defendió a Tourné y negó que Vázquez pidiera su renuncia - Diario EL PAIS - Montevideo - Uruguay; Spanish: 'soez machismo' The party also offered an alternative version of the reason for Ms. Tourné's resignation, namely, that she had voluntarily left President Vázquez's government, countering suggestions that she had been dismissed. ==See also== * Politics of Uruguay * List of political families#Uruguay * Pedro Bordaberry#Interior Minister Daisy Tourné * Juan Domínguez (Uruguay)#Disavowal by Frente Amplio and Opposition * Uruguay Tourné#Background and early career ==References== * :es:Daisy Tourné * Category:Interior Ministers of Uruguay Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Chamber of Representatives of Uruguay Category:Broad Front (Uruguay) politicians Category:Politicians from Montevideo Category:Uruguayan people of French descent Category:Women government ministers of Uruguay Category:20th-century women politicians Category:21st-century women politicians Category:Female interior ministers ","title":"Daisy Tourné"},{"id":"19249300","text":"Gour Das Bysack (sometimes parts of his name have been transliterated as Gaur, Dass, Dos, Bysac) was a Bengali writer prominent in the late 19th century.

Its first session was then prorogued by the Governor General on December 4, 2008, at the request of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who was facing a likely no-confidence motion and a coalition agreement between the Liberal party and the New Democratic Party with the support of the Bloc Québécois (2008–2009 Canadian parliamentary dispute). Of the 308 MPs elected at the October 14, 2008 general election, 64 were new to Parliament and three sat in Parliaments previous to the 39th: John Duncan, Jack Harris and Roger Pomerleau. There were three sessions of the 40th Parliament. On March 25, 2011, the House of Commons passed a Liberal motion of non-confidence by a vote of 156 to 145, finding the Conservative Cabinet in contempt of parliament, an unprecedented finding in Canadian and Commonwealth parliamentary history. On March 26, 2011, Prime Minister Stephen Harper subsequently asked Governor General David Johnston to dissolve parliament and issue a writ of election. ==Party standings== The party standings as of the election, and at dissolution, were as follows: {  + Standings in the 40th Canadian Parliament - !colspan=2 rowspan=2Affiliation !colspan=2House Members !colspan=2Senate Members - !2008 Election Results !At Dissolution !On Election Day 2008Members of the Canadian Senate are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister and remain as Senators until the age of 75, even if the House of Commons has been dissolved or an election has been called. !At Dissolution 143 143 21 52 77 77 58 46 49 47 0 0 37 36 0 0 2André Arthur and Bill Casey. 1André Arthur 5Anne Cools, Michael Pitfield, Marcel Prud'homme, Jean-Claude Rivest, Mira Spivak. 2Anne Cools, Jean-Claude Rivest. 0 0 3Elaine McCoy, Lowell Murray, Norman Atkins 2Elaine McCoy, Lowell Murray 0 1Helena Guergis— 0 0 0 0 1Raymond Lavigne sat as a Liberal, but was not officially part of the Liberal caucus. 0 0 0 1Lillian Dyck. 0 - colspan=2Total members 308 305 89 102 0 3 16 3 - colspan=2Total seats colspan=2308 colspan=2105 } ===Resignations and by-elections=== NDP MP Dawn Black resigned her seat of New Westminster—Coquitlam effective April 13, 2009, to run (successfully) in the provincial riding of New Westminster in the 2009 British Columbia general election.\\"NDP MP to seek provincial seat in B.C.\\". cbc.ca, March 7, 2009.

A4 By-elections in these three ridings were not scheduled prior to the issue of the writ for the 41st general election. ==1st session and prorogation== The first session of the 40th parliament opened on November 18, 2008, after Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the Conservatives won a slightly stronger minority government in the 2008 election. With a new government in session, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty tabled a fiscal update nine days later. Among other things, the update cut government spending, suspended the ability of civil servants to strike, sold off some Crown assets, and eliminated existing political party subsidies. This fiscal update was rejected by the opposition, and became a catalyst for talks of a coalition government. Stéphane Dion of the Liberal Party and Jack Layton of the New Democratic Party, signed an accord stating that in the event that the government lost the confidence of the house, they would form a coalition with the support of Gilles Duceppe and the Bloc Québécois, if asked to do so by the Governor General of Canada Michaëlle Jean. However, Stephen Harper delayed the vote of non-confidence scheduled for December 1, and the Governor General prorogued parliament on Harper's advice on December 4, 2008, until January 26, 2009. After prorogation, calls came from within the Liberal Party for Dion to resign immediately. Dion initially scheduled his resignation for the party's leadership convention in May 2009, but on December 8, 2008, he announced that he would step down upon the selection of an interim leader. After the withdrawal of Bob Rae and Dominic LeBlanc from the 2009 leadership race, Michael Ignatieff became the only leadership candidate, and therefore was appointed interim leader of the Liberals and the opposition on December 10, 2008. ==2nd Session and prorogation== The Governor-in-Council recalled parliament on January 26, 2009. Its first business (after the Throne Speech) was to present the federal budget, which included a large deficit. After negotiations with new opposition leader Michael Ignatieff, the government promised to present regular updates on the stimulus budget, and the Liberals and Conservatives joined to pass the budget and keep the Conservative government in power. The Conservative government made crime a major focus of the session. The Conservatives reintroduced their former mandatory minimums bill, known as Bill C-15. On December 30, 2009, Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that he would advise the Governor General to prorogue parliament during the 2010 Winter Olympics, until March 3, 2010. He telephoned Governor General Michaëlle Jean to ask her permission to end the parliamentary session and Jean signed the proclamation later that day. According to Harper's spokesman, he sought his second prorogation to consult with Canadians about the economy. In an interview with CBC News, Prince Edward Island Liberal member of parliament Wayne Easter accused the Prime Minister of \\"shutting democracy down\\". The second prorogation in a year also received some international criticism as being not very democratic. In response to the prorogation, demonstrations took place on January 23, 2010, in over 60 Canadian cities, and at least four cities in other countries. The protests attracted thousands of participants, many who had joined a group on Facebook. ==Senate appointments== The Senate of Canada has seen new members appointed in blocs of 18, 9, and 5; all were appointed to the Conservative caucus. The balance of power shifted for the first time on August 27, 2009, when the Liberal caucus was reduced to holding a plurality of 52 seats. On January 29, 2010, the balance shifted again as five vacancies were filled by appointed Conservatives, giving them a plurality of 51, with the Liberals holding the next-highest number of seats at 49. The Conservatives achieved an absolute majority when Don Meredith and Larry Smith were appointed on December 20, 2010. After dissolution, Smith and Fabian Manning resigned to run in the 2011 election. That reduced the Conservative caucus to 52, but they retained a majority of sitting senators as there were 50 senators of other parties and 3 vacancies. ===Honorary Senators=== The Senate of Canada posthumously awarded the title of Honorary Senator during the 40th Parliament to five pioneering women known as The Famous Five. {  - Emily Murphy - Henrietta Muir Edwards - Nellie McClung - Irene Parlby - Louise McKinney } ==Members== :For full lists of members of the 40th Parliament of Canada, see List of House members of the 40th Parliament of Canada and List of senators in the 40th Parliament of Canada. ==CommitteesHouse=== *Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development *Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics *Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food *Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage *Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration *Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development *Standing Committee on Finance *Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans *Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development *Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates *Standing Committee on Health *Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities *Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology *Standing Committee on International Trade *Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights *Standing Committee on National Defence *Standing Committee on Natural Resources *Standing Committee on Official Languages *Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs *Standing Committee on Public Accounts *Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security *Standing Committee on the Status of Women *Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities *Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs ===Senate=== *Standing Committee on Aboriginal Peoples *Special Committee on Aging *Standing Committee on Agriculture and Forestry *Special Committee on Anti-terrorism *Standing Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce *Standing Committee on Conflict of Interest for Seniors *Standing Committee on Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources *Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans *Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade *Standing Committee on Human Rights *Standing Committee on Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration *Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs *Standing Committee on National Finance *Standing Committee on National Security and Defence **Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs *Standing Committee on Official Languages *Standing Committee on Rules, Procedures and the Rights of Parliament *Selection Committee *Standing Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology **Subcommittee on Cities **Subcommittee on Population Health *Standing Committee on Transport and Communications ===Joint Committees=== *Standing Joint Committee on Library of Parliament *Standing Joint Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations ==OfficeholdersSpeakers=== * Senate: Noël Kinsella, Conservative Senator for New Brunswick. * House of Commons: Peter Milliken, the Liberal member for Kingston and the Islands. ===Other Chair occupants=== Senate * Speaker pro tempore of the Canadian Senate: ** Rose-Marie Losier-Cool, Liberal Senator from New Brunswick (until March 2, 2010) ** Donald H.

Maltese folklore is the folk tradition which has developed in Malta over the centuries, and expresses the cultural identity of the Maltese people. Maltese folklore, traditions and legends still live in the minds of the older-generations, and these are slowly being studied and categorized, like any other European tradition. A number of national and international folklore festivals are undertaken on an annual basis, some of which are under the patronage of the National Folklore Commission and the Ministry for Culture and the Arts. Notably, every December the Malta International Folk Festival is staged in Valletta, with delegates from countries around the World. == Weddings == Traditional Maltese weddings featured the bridal party walking in procession beneath an ornate canopy, from the home of the bride's family to the parish church, with singers trailing behind serenading the bride and groom. The Maltese word for this custom is il-ġilwa. This custom along with many others has long since disappeared from the Islands, in the face of modern practices. Recreation of a traditional Maltese 16th century wedding New wives would wear the għonnella, a traditional item of Maltese clothing. However, it is no longer worn in modern Malta. Today's couples are married in churches, chapels or hotels in the village or town of their choice. The nuptials are usually followed by a lavish wedding reception, often including several hundred guests. Occasionally, couples will try to incorporate elements of the traditional Maltese wedding in their celebration. There has been a recent resurgence of interest in traditional weddings. The annually held Maltese Traditional Wedding in the Village of Żurrieq is very popular. Around May of each year, thousands of Maltese and tourists attend a traditional Maltese wedding in the style of the 16th century. This includes il-ġilwa, which leads the bride and groom to a wedding ceremony in various places such as the parvis of St. Andrew's Chapel. The reception that follows features folklore music (għana) and dancing. In September 2008, the 3rd Edition of the Qala International Folk Festival in Gozo featured \\"It-Tieg fl-Antik\\". This re- enactment of a traditional Gozitan wedding was officiated at Bishop Michael Buttigieg Square in front of the stone cross column, after which, a procession with the newly weds, led up to the Main Square of the village of Qala, where a typical ‘festin’ was awaiting them, serving traditional delicacies of the period. == Birth and childhood == Traditional Maltese proverbs reveal a cultural preoccupation with childbearing and fertility: \\"iż-żwieġ mingħajr tarbija ma fihx tgawdija\\" (a childless marriage cannot be a happy one). This is a belief that Malta shares with many other Mediterranean cultures, most notably, Israel, Palestine and Morocco. In Maltese folktales, the local variant of the classic closing formula, \\"and they all lived happily ever after\\" is \\"u għammru u tgħammru, u spiċċat\\" (and they lived together, and they had children together, and the tale is finished).Pullicino, supra, at 208-9. Rural Malta shares in common with Mediterranean and traditional Jewish society a number of superstitions regarding fertility, menstruation, and pregnancy, including the avoidance of cemeteries during the months leading up to childbirth, and avoiding the preparation of certain foods during menses. Pregnant women are encouraged to satisfy their cravings for specific foods, out of fear that their unborn child will bear a representational birth mark (Maltese: xewqa, literally \\"desire\\" or \\"craving\\"). Maltese and Sicilian women also share certain traditions that are believed to predict the sex of an unborn child, such as the cycle of the moon on the anticipated date of birth, whether the baby is carried \\"high\\" or \\"low\\" during pregnancy, and the movement of a wedding ring, dangled on a string above the abdomen (sideways denoting a girl, back and forth denoting a boy). Traditionally, Maltese newborns were baptised as promptly as possible, partly out of fear of limbo should the child die in infancy, and partly because according to Maltese (and Sicilian) folklore an unbaptised child is not yet a Christian, but \\"still a Turk\\". Traditional Maltese delicacies served at a baptismal feast include biskuttini tal-magħmudija (almond macaroons covered in white or pink icing), it-torta tal-marmorata (a spicy, heart-shaped tart of chocolate-flavoured almond paste), and a liqueur known as rożolin, made with rose petals, violets and almonds. On a child's first birthday, in a tradition that still survives today, Maltese parents would organize a game known as il-quċċija, where a variety of symbolic objects would be randomly placed around the seated child. These may include a hard-boiled egg (they grow into wealth), a Bible(they become priests), crucifix or rosary beads(they become clerics), a book, and so on. Whichever object the child shows most interest in is said to reveal the child's path and fortunes in adulthood. Money refers to a rich future while a book expresses intelligence and a possible career as a teacher. Infants who select a pencil or pen will be writers. Choosing bibles or rosary beads refers to a clerical or monastic life. If the child chooses a hard-boiled egg, it will have a long life and bear many children. More recent additions include calculators (refers to accounting), thread (fashion) and wooden spoons (cooking and a great appetite). == Folktales== In the early years of the twentieth century, Maltese folktales were collected by the Jesuit scholar Manwel Magri and published in the series Kotba tal-Mogħdija taż-Żmien and also in the collection Ħrejjef Missirijietna (\\"tales from our fathers\\").Gilbert Puech (1994). Ethnotextes maltais. Volume 1 of Studia Melitensia, ISSN 0943-7908. Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz. . p. 193. This collection of material inspired subsequent researchers and academics to gather traditional tales, fables and legends from all over the Archipelago. Magri's work also inspired a series of comic books released by Klabb Kotba Maltin in 1984. The titles included Bin is-Sultan Jiżżewweġ x-Xebba tat-Tronġiet Mewwija and Ir-Rjieħ. Some of the stories are about giants, witches and dragons; others are about imaginary Maltese beings. These include the kawkaw or gawgaw, a grey and slimy creature who roamed the streets at night and could smell out naughty boys and Il-Belliegħa, a monster that lived in wells and could pull in children who looked into them.Tarcisio Zarb (1998). Folklore of an island: Maltese threshold customs. San Ġwann, Malta: Publishers Enterprises Group. . p. 112–116. In 2014, Stephan D. Mifsud published The Maltese Bestiary: An Illustrated Guide to the Mythical Flora and Fauna of the Maltese Islands, an encyclopedia of Maltese monsters from folktales. Mifsud worked as a biologist with an interest in unusual creatures. Within his work, he discusses how he has managed to find large collections of monsters and creatures from other cultures, but noticed a gap in research on Maltese creatures despite his knowledge that many creatures were cited in Maltese folklore. This lead him to create his own compendium of Maltese monsters, similar to what is available for Greek or Norse legendary beasts. == Other festivities == S.L.Cassar, Valletta carnival, ca. 1900 === Carnival === Maltese Carnival (Maltese: il- karnival ta' Malta) has had an important place on the cultural calendar for just under five centuries, introduced to the Islands by Grand Master Piero de Ponte in 1535. It is held during the week leading up to Ash Wednesday, and typically includes masked balls, fancy dress and grotesque mask competitions, lavish late-night parties, a colourful, ticker-tape parade of allegorical floats presided over by King Carnival (Maltese: ir-Re tal-Karnival), marching bands and costumed revellers. === Holy Week === Holy Week (Maltese: il-Ġimgħa Mqaddsa) starts on Palm Sunday (Ħadd il-Palm) and ends on Easter Sunday (Ħadd il-Għid). Numerous religious traditions, most of them inherited from one generation to the next, are part of the paschal celebrations in the Maltese Islands, honouring the death and resurrection of Jesus. === Mnarja === Mnarja, or l-Imnarja (pronounced lim-nar-ya) is one of the most important dates on the Maltese cultural calendar. Officially, it is a national festival dedicated to the feast of Saints Peter and St. Paul. In fact its roots can be traced back to the pagan Roman feast of Luminaria (literally, \\"the illumination\\"), when the early summer night of June 29 was illuminated by torches and bonfires. A national feast since the rule of the Order of St. John, Mnarja is a traditional Maltese festival of food, religion and music. The festivities still commence today with the reading of the \\"bandu\\", an official governmental announcement, which has been read on this day in Malta since the 16th century. Originally, Mnarja was celebrated outside St. Paul's Grotto, in the north of Malta; however, by 1613 the focus of the festivities had shifted to the Cathedral of St. Paul, in Mdina, and featured torchlight processions, the firing of 100 petards, horseraces, and races for men, boys and slaves. Modern Mnarja festivals take place in and around the woodlands of Buskett, just outside the town of Rabat. It is said that under the Knights, this was the one day in the year when the Maltese were allowed to hunt and eat wild rabbit, which was otherwise reserved for the hunting pleasures of the Knights. The close connection between Mnarja and rabbit stew (Maltese: \\"fenkata\\") remains strong today. In 1854 British governor William Reid launched an agricultural show at Buskett which is still being held today. The farmers' exhibition is still a seminal part of the Mnarja festivities today. Mnarja today is one of the few occasions when participants may hear traditional Maltese \\"għana\\". Traditionally, grooms would promise to take their newly or recently wed brides to Mnarja during the first of year of marriage and, for luck, many of the brides would attend in their full wedding gown and veil, although this custom has long since disappeared from the Islands. ==Music== The ċuqlajta is a traditional instrument which includes different types of wooden clappers and ratchets which produce a variety of sounds. One particular type of clapper dates to Roman times and can still be seen in folkbands particularly in Gozo.\\"Maltese Traditional Instruments\\", Maltese Consulate of Australia ===Parish bands=== Virtually every parish in Malta has a band club (Maltese: il-każin tal-banda), and in some cases, two. The bands typically consist of woodwind and brass instruments, and percussion. They are feature performers in the village festa, accompanying the statue of the parish's titular saint with celebratory music. Their music is very similar to their Sicilian and Southern Italian counterparts. Although drums and flutes are known to have participated in religious processions in Malta as early as the 16th century, today's Maltese band clubs are a more recent introduction to Maltese culture, from around the 19th century, at the height of British rule. The village bands were in part assembled in response to, and heavily influenced by, the marching bands of the British military. Indeed, the oldest of today's Maltese bands was set up by Filippo Galea whose father was a bandmaster with the British military. A few years after setting up his band (Banda di San Filippo) in 1851 in Zebbug, Filippo followed in his father's footsteps and made a distinguished military career as a bandmaster. Other renowned Maltese musicians like Indri Borg are also accredited with the setting up of bands of which only one survives to this day (L-Isle Adam Band of Rabat, founded in 1860), although Maestro Borg also took charge of the Banda di San Filippo in 1860. However, throughout the 1800s, Malta experienced a steady influx of Sicilian and Italian refugees and immigrants, fleeing from civil war or under sentence of exile, who stimulated and popularized the concept of a village band. == Feasts == Local festivals celebrating the patron saint of the local parish, similar to those in southern Italy, are commonplace in Malta. Several festi take place in different towns and villages across Malta every weekend in the summer. A festa reaches its apex with a High Mass featuring a sermon on the life and achievements of the patron saint, after which a statue of the religious patron is taken around the local streets in solemn procession, with the faithful following in respectful prayer. The religious atmosphere quickly gives way to several days of revelry, band processions, fireworks, and late night parties. In the weeks leading up to a local festa, the main streets around the parish are richly decorated, with brocade banners, ornate religious sculptures mounted on pedestals and, all around the zuntier (parvis) of the parish church, hawkers set up stalls stocked with food and the local variety of nougat. The parish church itself is typically illuminated at night, although the fjakkoli (flaming lanterns) of yesteryear have been supplanted by bright-coloured electric bulbs. Some of the seaside towns feature a unique and popular medieval game known as the ġostra. Although the word itself is derived from the Italian giostra, Maltese ġostra has little in common with medieval jousting, and is in fact derived from the Neapolitan game of the Cockaigne pole. It involves a 10-metre long greased pole, mounted on a barge out in the bay, perched on a precarious angle out over the sea. Competing youths scramble up the pole, in an attempt to snatch a pennant, flag or other trophy from the top of the pole. ==See also== * Għana (folk music) * Maltese cuisine ==References== Category:Maltese culture Category:European folklore ","title":"Maltese folklore"},{"id":"19249412","text":"TIK () is a Ukrainian folk rock band with heavy influences of ska and shanson. It was formed in 2005 in Vinnytsia, Ukraine. The band's name is an abbreviation of the Ukrainian phrase \\"Тверезість і культура\\" which means \\"Sobriety and Culture\\". ==History== TIK can trace its origin in 2000 when the history student Viktor Broniuk (vocals, accordion) and the music student Denys Repey (bass guitar) in Vinnytsia decided to form a band that they called TIK from the Ukrainian phrase \\"Тверезість і культура\\". In 2003 they were joined by the guitarist Kostiantyn Terepa and the drummer Oleksandr Filinkov. The band made their first real public appearance at a concert in Vinnytsia on June 2, 2005, and that date is considered to be the birthday of the band. In the autumn of 2005 the band was joined by Yuriy Martsyniuk (keyboards and saxophone) and shortly after that the band recorded its first demo tape. In 2006 the guitarist Kostiantyn Tegera left the band and was replaced by Serhiy Oliynyk. But later also Denys Repey and Yuriy Martsyniuk left the band.

The film gives voice to those who, by insisting on equality and justice, spoke up for social change throughout U.S. history and also illustrates the relevance of this to today's society. The film is narrated by historian Howard Zinn and is based on his books A People's History of the United States (1980) and, with Anthony Arnove, Voices of a People's History of the United States (2004). The People Speak is produced by Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, Chris Moore, Anthony Arnove, and Howard Zinn. It is co- directed by Moore, Arnove and Zinn. ==Production== The movie was shot on location in Boston, in front of live audiences at Emerson's Cutler Majestic Theatre in January 2008 and at Malibu Performing Arts Center, Malibu. ==Cast== Allison Moorer, Benjamin Bratt, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Chris Robinson, Christina Kirk, Danny Glover, Darryl \\"D.M.C.\\" McDaniels, David Strathairn, Don Cheadle, Eddie Vedder, Harris Yulin, Jasmine Guy, John Legend, Josh Brolin, Kathleen Chalfant, Kerry Washington, Lupe Fiasco, Marisa Tomei, Martín Espada, Matt Damon, Michael Ealy, Mike O'Malley, Morgan Freeman, P!nk, Q'orianka Kilcher, Reg E.

Each passionate reading flows out of the previous one.\\" USA Today reported Damon as saying: \\"This is the perfect format for a history lesson. You’re getting the actual historical text verbatim, so there’s no spin, performed by these great actors. History is intimidating. There’s so much to know. If I could go back to college again, I would be a history major.\\" According to the newspaper, Springsteen taped at his ranch in New Jersey while Brolin was at work and Brolin said: \\"They ended up spending five or six hours.

This spider was operated by a number of operators, controlling the 8 legs and other movements of the spider. It investigated the city, visiting landmarks such as St George's Hall and the Albert Dock, and walking down streets and climbing onto the side of a derelict tower block at the end of each performance, and was met with a very positive response, with seemingly all of Liverpool turning out to see it, as well as tourists visiting the city to see La Princesse. The people of Liverpool took the great spider to their hearts and many thousands turned out to see the spectacle, regardless of the poor weather. Some estimates put the crowd at 150,000 over the weekend. This event therefore could be considered the jewel in the crown of the Capital of Culture celebrations. The crowds had experienced a once in a lifetime spectacle. Its £1.8 million price tag was criticised by some, however the event undoubtedly brought much more than this into the city in tourism. The city also received worldwide media attention from the event and many international visitors. == See also == * Royal de Luxe - a similar French mechanical marionette street theatre company ==References *La Machine's home page * La Machine's webpage on the Liverpool event *Liverpool City of European Culture webpage on the event *Main BBC webpage (portal) about the event *BBC Liverpool 08 portal with many videos *BBC video about preparations for the event *BBC webpage about the event *BBC webpage about the event; Friday 5 September the spider wakes up *BBC video about the event; Friday 5 September early morning *BBC video about the event; Friday 5 September the spider wakes up *BBC video about the event; Friday 5 September the spider performs *Blog post containing videos of La Princesse Category:Performance artist collectives Category:Robotics companies ","title":"La Machine (production company)"},{"id":"19249478","text":" I-202 was one of only three s of the Imperial Japanese Navy to be completed during World War II. The I-201 class were of advanced design, and had been built for high underwater speed. They were the fastest operational submarines built during World War II, surpassing even the German Type XXI submarines.Stille, p. 38 ==Service history== Launched on 2 September 1944, I-202 was the second I-201-class submarine to be completed, on 12 February 1945. After a battery charging operation which attempted to reduce the time taken by using higher current, I-202 suffered explosions in her battery compartments which ruined 500 battery cells and damaged her pressure hull. In June 1945 I-202 was in Kure Naval Arsenal for repairs to her pressure hull, and to replace her ruined batteries. When the work was nearly completed, an air raid warning was given and Captain Imai decided to sail immediately. I-202 had reached the open sea when bombing of the base began, but as it was unable to dive it was hit on the aft deck by strafing aircraft. was sunk as result of the raid and it was decided to evacuate to Maizuru, Kyoto. A convoy of 35 small cargo vessels, some minesweepers, and five submarines including I-202 and I-201 left Kure at the end of June to run the Kanmon Straits by night. I-202 made the dangerous passage surfaced, on battery power, with the entire crew except for essential personnel assembled on the top deck and forbidden to move. I-202s repairs were completed at Maizuru and she resumed training and embarked a load of torpedoes. At the end of July the Staff of the Sixth Fleet held a conference at which Captain Imai was present. It was decided to sail to the Pacific Ocean in early August by way of Yokosuka. However, when Imai returned to Maizuru on 31 July 1945 the port was under heavy attack by carrier-based aircraft. Despite spending the raid submerged, I-202 had suffered slight damage, its periscope being destroyed and some of its casing plates penetrated by splinters. This damage meant that the planned operation could not be conducted, and the submarine had to wait for a new periscope to arrive. While I-202 was waiting at Maizuru, the atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, while Maizuru was under constant threat of air attack. On 15 August the war ended with the surrender of Japan but two days later I-202 sailed with I-201, I-121, and one other submarine and deployed in a line off Vladivostok. The Sixth Fleet staff ordered them on several occasions to return to Maizuru, and on 22 August a staff officer flew into Maizuru to stress the importance of the order. The submarines finally returned to Maizuru on 24 August after destroying their radios and other equipment, and in October sailed to Sasebo where they and their sister ship were taken out of service on 30 November and handed over to the Occupation Forces. ==Postwar== I-202 was scheduled to be delivered to Britain, but the Soviet Union was also strongly interested in acquiring it, and it was eventually sunk by the US Navy off the Gotō Islands on 5 April 1946 to avoid trouble between Britain and the Soviets.Lengerer, p. 64 ==NotesReferences== * * Category:World War II submarines of Japan Category:I-201-class submarines Category:1944 ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1946 Category:Ships sunk as targets ","title":"Japanese submarine I-202"},{"id":"19249527","text":"Mark Joseph (born Mark Joseph Muzsnyai, 1981) is an English musician.

He is known especially for his theological criticism of the Leuenberg Concord and his research on the relationship between justification and theosis in the theology of Martin Luther. His initiating and furthering this research caused him to be regarded as the father of \\"The New Finnish Interpretation of Luther\\" or \\"the Finnish School of Tuomo Mannermaa\\". ==Finnish School== Mannermaa led the development of \\"The New Finnish Interpretation of Luther\\" that presents Luther's views on salvation in terms much closer to the Eastern Orthodox doctrine of theosis rather than established interpretations of German Luther scholarship.Dorman, Ted.

Braaten and Robert W. Jenson in a work entitled, Union with Christ: The New Finnish Interpretation of Luther. Mannermaa states, \\"the external impulse for this new wave of Luther studies in Helsinki came surprisingly from outside the boundaries of Luther research. It came from the ecumenical dialogue between the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland and the Russian Orthodox Church that was initiated by Archbishop Martti Simojoki at the beginning of the nineteen-seventies.\\"Tuomo Mannermaa, \\"Why Is Luther So Fascinating? Modern Finnish Luther Research,\\" Union with Christ, (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1998), 1. The New Finnish Interpretation has been challenged because it downplays Luther's roots in key theological developments in Western Christendom, and it characterizes Luther's teaching on Justification as based on Jesus's righteousness which indwells the believer rather than Jesus's righteousness as imputed to the believer.William Wallace Schumacher, \\"'Who Do I Say That You Are?'

On December 8, 1995, Scully fought two-time world champion Michael Nunn for the WBO NABO super middleweight title. Although ESPN commentators had the fight close, Nunn was awarded a unanimous win, including a curiously wide score on the card of judge Harold Gomes. His victories include a unanimous ten-round decision over Art Baylis (On Prime TV Network), a ten-round decision over WBC International champion Billy Bridges at Harrah's in Atlantic City (on ESPN) and a second-round stoppage over former IBO world champion Willie Ball at Foxwoods Resort and Casino in Connecticut. Scully also captured a November 1989 unanimous decision on USA's Tuesday Night Fights, over the former #1 nationally ranked amateur Alphonso Bailey of Kentucky. Scully-Bailey was the co-feature to Simon Brown's IBF title defense against Luis Santana. On May 22, 1992 at Agawam, Massachusetts Scully captured a unanimous 12-round decision over Southern Boxing Association champion Melvin Wynn of Atlanta, Georgia in a fight contested for the World Boxing Federation Intercontinental Super Middleweight title. Scully also frequently served as a sparring partner for some of the biggest names in the sport, including the highly regarded world champions Henry Maske, Mike McCallum, Vinny Pazienza, Roy Jones Jr. and James \\"Lights Out\\" Toney. In November 2010, \\"Iceman\\" John Scully was inducted into the fifth class of the Connecticut Boxing Hall of Fame at the Mohegan Sun Resort and Casino in Connecticut. ==Professional boxing record== -

Since 2001, has been successful as a professional trainer, guiding four boxers to world championships (WIBF Lightweight Champion Liz Mueller, WBA Junior Middleweight Champion Jose Antonio Rivera, IBO Super Bantamweight Champion Mike Oliver and WBC Light heavyweight Champion \\"Bad\\" Chad Dawson). The crowning moment may have been when he masterfully guided Rivera to the WBA Junior Middleweight Championship, with a clear points victory on Showtime over defending champion Alejandro \\"Terra\\" Garcia. Scully has also had a hand in the professional training of notable boxers Israel \\"Pito\\" Cardona, Matt Godfrey, \\"Sucra\\" Ray Olivera, Scott \\"The Sandman\\" Pemberton, Lawrence Clay-Bey, Matt Remillard, Francisco \\"The Wizard\\" Palacios and George \\"Monk\\" Foreman III. The Iceman also assists in the training camps of former world amateur champion and now IBF light heavyweight world champion Artur Beterbiev, who fights out of Montreal, Canada by way of Chechnya (head trainer is Marc Ramsay). He is considered an important part of the development of future WBC light heavyweight world champion \\"Bad\\" Chad Dawson. Scully first trained Dawson for three successful fights in 2004 and 2005 before unforeseen promotional problems caused Dawson to leave to train in Florida with Dan Birmingham. Scully and Dawson, however, reunited as a team early in the summer of 2011. Scully later guided Dawson to the biggest win of his professional career on April 28, 2012 at the legendary Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The HBO televised matchup saw Dawson capture a 12-round decision to take the WBC Light heavyweight title from legendary champion Bernard \\"The Executioner\\" Hopkins. Notably, when Dawson seemingly began to mentally falter at the halfway point of the match, Scully masterfully kept the challenger steady, focused and on track between rounds. The exceptional cornerwork was properly noted by HBO's ringside broadcast team of Larry Merchant, Emanuel Steward and Jim Lampley. Known for his insightful takes on the sport of boxing, especially his corner work between rounds of televised fights, Scully has written a highly praised boxing book entitled, \\"The Iceman Diaries\\" that details his life within the sport. He appears often on ESPN Classic, working alongside Joe Tessitore, as a ringside analyst for that network's ESPN Classic Boxing Series. A frequent and widely acclaimed columnist for Britain's \\"Boxing News\\" magazine, Scully has also been featured several times on ESPN News, before and after major fights, previewing and analyzing the action, including Pay-Per-View battles between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Shane Mosley, and Manny Pacquiao and Miguel Cotto. In 2015 Scully joined the cast of the Nuvo-TV boxing reality show \\"KNOCKOUT\\" alongside Roy Jones Jr., Floyd Mayweather Sr. and Sugar Shane Mosley. Scully was inducted into the Connecticut Boxing Hall of Fame in November 2009 at the Mohegan Sun Casino. He was also inducted into the Billy C. Boxing Hall of Fame (along with Ernie Shavers and Marlon Starling) at South Glens Falls, New York on November 19, 2011. ==References== *http://www.boxingscene.com/forums/showthread.php?t=86909 *http://newsroom.mohegansun.com/2009/10/05/scully-heads-up-connecticut-boxing- hall-of-fame-inductees.html *http://www.secondsout.com/features/main- features/interview--iceman-john-scully *http://www.boxingtalk.com/pag/article.php?aid=31296 *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OGCyt_82rI&sns;=em *http://leftjaballnight.com/teamleftjab/john-scully-exclusive-team-leftjab- interview-talks-spencebrookwardkovalev/ *http://www.boxrec.com ==External links== * Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Boxers from Connecticut Category:American color commentators Category:Boxing commentators Category:American male boxers Category:Middleweight boxers ","title":"Iceman John Scully"},{"id":"19249629","text":"David James ( – 2 January 1929) was a Welsh international rugby union halfback who played club rugby for Swansea.

The fighting at Ban Houei Sane was one in a series of battles fought between North Vietnamese and Allied forces during the Tet Offensive. The small outpost, defended by the 700 man Bataillon Volontaire (BV-33), was attacked and overwhelmed by the vastly superior PAVN and their PT-76 light tanks. The failure of BV-33 to defend their outpost at Ban Houei Sane would have negative consequences only a few weeks later, when the PAVN would strike again at Lang Vei. ==Background== During the First Indochina War the Viet Minh constructed a pathway in neighbouring Laos in order to transport vital military supplies to southern Vietnam. Over time that pathway, now known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail, grew in importance as the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sought to topple the rival government in the south, the Republic of Vietnam. In the late 1950s, the Ho Chi Minh Trail was expanded to support the Viet Cong (VC)'s increasing military activities in South Vietnam. To protect this vital lifeline, the PAVN were deployed to take control of various areas in eastern Laos adjacent to the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone. The increasing PAVN activities in those parts of Laos did not go unnoticed, as the governments of South Vietnam and Laos began working together to establish a small outpost at Ban Houei Sane for the purpose of monitoring PAVN movements in 1959. In April 1961, the newly created Bataillon Volontaire 33 (BV-33) of the Royal Lao Army arrived at Ban Houei Sane, after it was forced to retreat from Tchephone by PAVN and Pathet Lao forces. At Ban Houei Sane, the Laotians constructed new defensive positions with assistance from the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN)'s 1st Infantry Division. One year later, BV-33 began monitoring North Vietnamese movements along the Vietnam-Laotian border. ==Battle== By the mid-1960s, when U.S military forces increased their presence in South Vietnam, the Laotian units at Ban Houei Sane also detected increasing PAVN movement along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Towards the end of December 1967 six thousand trucks carrying supplies for PAVN/VC forces in southern Vietnam were detected moving down the Trail. That tremendous build-up came as a result of North Vietnam's decision to launch an all-out attack on Allied forces during the Tet celebrations. In order to lure American combat units away from the major cities the North Vietnamese High Command decided to launch the first strike; on 21 January 1968, the PAVN began their attacks on the Khe Sanh Combat Base, where six thousand U.S. Marines were stationedCitation needed. As part of that major effort, General Tran Quy Hai made the decision to knock out the small outpost of Ban Houei Sane once and for all, as the Royal Laotian Army's BV-33 was considered an important tool in the Allies' intelligence gathering effort. On the night of 23 January 1968, the PAVN 24th Regiment struck the defenders of Ban Houei Sane from three directions. Initially the assault was spearheaded by the 3/24 Battalion with the 198th Armoured Battalion in support, but the first assault wave was delayed for various reasons. Firstly PAVN infantry and armoured corps lacked the experience in combined operations, secondly the local terrain posed many difficulties for the tank crews, causing the PT-76 light tanks to bog down attempting to cross a stream. By 06:00 Colonel Lê Công Phê ordered his troops to advance on Ban Houei Sane despite the delays of the 198th Armoured Battalion. As PAVN units moved towards the Laotian outpost, the PT-76's of the 198th Battalion turned up causing much confusion among the defenders. On the day the PAVN launched their attacks, the weather was poor for aerial operations. As PAVN engineers blew up Laotian obstacles there was little that U.S. Forward Air Controllers could do to stop their advance as ground targets could not be identified. After three hours of fighting the Laotian commander, Lieutenant Colonel Soulang Phetsampou, informed the U.S. Forward Air Controllers that all Laotian positions had been overwhelmed and that they would abandon the outpost. At that point, the Laotian commander requested assistance from the CIDG camp at Lang Vei, to help evacuate his soldiers and their families. However assistance from Lang Vei would never arrive, so the soldiers of BV-33 and more than two thousand civilian refugees made their way eastward along Route 9, approaching the South Vietnamese border. On 24 January, the survivors of the Ban Houei Sane battle and their families reached the Lang Vei CIDG camp. Initially the military personnel at Lang Vei treated the Laotian refugees with caution, but they were finally given assistance when the Lang Vei camp commander allowed the Laotians to take up positions in the nearby Lang Vei village. ==The next target== For Captain Frank C. Willoughby, commander of the Lang Vei CIDG camp, the arrival of the Laotian refugees also brought some disturbing development on the battlefield. For the first time the PAVN had deployed tanks in battle, and it was only fifteen kilometres away from Lang Vei. Fearing a repeat of the deadly PAVN attacks, BV-33 soldiers were allowed to assist local forces by conducting patrols around the CIDG camp. As the Laotians settled down in Lang Vei, the U.S. Air Force conducted airstrikes targeting the Ban Houei Sane airfield to prevent the PAVN from utilising the airfield for operations against Khe Sanh. On 30 January, Captain Willoughby's fears were confirmed when a PAVN soldier defected to the special forces at Lang Vei, and informed them of the whereabouts of the 304th Division. On 6 February 1968, the PAVN struck Lang Vei. ==See also== *Laotian Civil War *Battle of Khe Sanh ==References *Khe Sanh: The Other Side Of The Hill Category:Laotian Civil War Category:Conflicts in 1968 Category:1968 in Laos Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War Ban Houei Sane Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War in 1968 Category:January 1968 events Ban Houei Sane ","title":"Battle of Ban Houei Sane"},{"id":"19249730","text":"Sensen may refer to: * Sen-Sen, a type of breath freshener * Datengoku Sensen, Ali Project's 26th single ==People== * Oliver Sensen, a German philosopher ","title":"Sensen"},{"id":"19249735","text":"El Chavo del Ocho, often shortened to El Chavo, is a Mexican television sitcom created by Roberto Gómez Bolaños. The show was based on a series of sketches performed on Gómez's eponymous sketch show, Chespirito, which were first performed in 1971. El Chavo became its own series in 1973 and aired until 1980, becoming one of the most popular television programs in the world. Following its cancellation and the relaunch of Chespirito, the El Chavo sketches returned in 1982 and continued to be performed on Chespirito until 1992 when Gómez, by this point in his sixties, discontinued them due to his advancing age. The show follows the life and tribulations of the title character, a poor orphan child (played by Gómez Bolaños) that lives on a Mexican housing complex, typically called a vecindad. He is accompanied by a cast of neighbors, children, and other characters.

He is not particularly bright (which Roberto Gómez Bolaños insinuated on the launch of the animated series may be a consequence of poor nutrition) and is remarkably clumsy, often hitting Quico, Don Ramón and Señor Barriga with balls, brooms, shoes, hammers, bricks, chairs and other objects. Chavo arrived at the neighborhood at the age of four and apparently lived in apartment #8 with an elderly woman (who is never seen, but is mentioned in the novel El diario de El Chavo del 8). After her death, Chavo spends most of his time inside an abandoned barrel that he calls his \\"secret hideout\\". He has a craving for ham tortas, a popular kind of sandwich in Mexico. He has a crush on Paty, along with Quico (which is their first fight over their crush, although she kisses Chavo in the animated series). Despite being a hungry 8-year-old child, he seems to have an incredible physical strength, since his punches are able to stun or even topple a full-grown man, mostly Don Ramón. In the English dub version of the series, he is voiced by Mona Marshall. Unlike in the original series and the Spanish version of the animated series, instead of being called \\"Chente\\" or \\"Chavito\\", he is called \\"Chavorino\\" by his friends sometimes. Also, the \\"El\\" part of his name was officially removed from his character's bios in the animated series, possibly to keep in with the show's English production on Americanizing the series. Instead of ham tortas, he has a craving for ham sandwiches, although the Christmas specials state that he also has cravings for jelly sandwiches for mysterious reasons, but those jelly sandwiches are actually ham tortas (ham sandwiches) in the original Spanish version, called jelly sandwiches in the English version. Also, his friend \\"Vicente\\" (or Chente) is renamed as Chova (switching the A and the O around). In Brazil, his name was changed to Chaves, which means \\"Keys\\" in Portuguese, because the word chavo does not make sense in this language. Actually, Chaves is a Portuguese language surname, with a Spanish language version, spelled Chávez. ===La Chilindrina=== *Portrayed by María Antonieta de las Nieves *Years: 1972–1973, 1973, 1975–1980, 1980–1992 La Chilindrina is the daughter of Don Ramón. \\"Precocious\\" is the best way to describe Don Ramón's intelligent and mischievous daughter, who likes to take advantage of her slow-witted friends to play pranks on them and take their toys or snacks. She usually wears a short green-patterned dress, white shorts, and a red sweater that is always twisted on the back. She has freckles, horn- rimmed eyeglasses, a missing front tooth, and two pigtails that are always uneven, one significantly higher than the other one, just like her socks. \\"Chilindrina\\" is the name of a typical Mexican bun, with chocolate sparkles on top, reminiscent of the character's freckles. In early episodes, La Chilindrina used to have longer ponytails which were cut by El Chavo. In most episodes, she is seen to have a crush on Chavo, and is very jealous of his crush on Paty. La Chilindrina was cut from the El Chavo animated series due to disputes with Roberto Gomez Bolaños (creator of all El Chavo characters) and Maria Antonieta de las Nieves (Chilindrina's portrayer) about who owned the rights to the character and if the character was allowed to be used publicly outside of El Chavo. María Antonieta de las Nieves was able to win a legal battle over Chespirito in 2003, which gave her permission to act as La Chilindrina in public, and granted her rights over the character so that character is separated from the cast but still be on it by the fans. She was replaced by Popis (Phoebe) or Ñoño (Junior) in the animated series version. In Brazil, her name was changed to Chiquinha. ===Quico=== *Portrayed by Carlos Villagrán *Years: 1972-1973, 1973–1979 Federico Matalas-Cayando Corcuera, known as Quico, is a spoiled, greedy, overprotected 9-year-old boy, son of Doña Florinda and a late naval captain (also named Frederico), who reportedly died when his vessel was attacked and, according to Quico, was eaten by a white shark. Arrogant, manipulative, and envious, Quico always wants to draw everyone's attention to himself, either by screaming loudly or by showing off his newest toy. Because of this, he usually gets El Chavo in trouble when he does something wrong, especially to Don Ramón, after which Don Ramón hits El Chavo angrily on the head. Partially due to his mother's influence (and former wealth and status as the wife of a naval officer), he believes that he and his mother are superior to everyone else in the neighborhood. He still finds time to play with—as he and his mother call them – chusma (\\"riffraff\\"), namely Chavo, Chilindrina, and Don Ramón. However, Quico has proved many times to be Chavo's best friend, often assisting him in Chavo's mischievous acts, as seen due to the fact that they are mostly seen playing together in the front yard, and that he was geniunely hurt when El Chavo left La Vecindad in the episodes \\"El Ratero de la Vecindad\\" and \\"El Billete de Loteria\\". Moreover, Quico is a good kid deep inside, even though there are several occasions in which he acts self-centered. Quico wears a rainbow-colored beanie cap, a dark blue naval officer's shirt with a red ascot, bright yellow socks he pulls all the way up to his knees, and white low-top shoes. He is also widely identified by his enormous cheeks, which he can puff out quite largely, and his minuscule intelligence, often responding to the Spanish words for idiot, stupid, dummy, etc. (he even displays delight about being called such things, oblivious to the fact that all these words are insults). Despite his stupidity, Quico displays more deceptive abilities and common sense than Chavo, and is the most likely to break the fourth wall (especially regarding that four of his quotes do this so). Often in the series Quico mentions that he has or that his mom will buy him a \\"square ball\\" and in \\"Termina el Romance\\" he and El Chavo refused to help Professor Jirafales reconcile with his mother due to Professor Jirafales having promised to them a square ball. In 1979, when Carlos Villagran quit the show, Quico is said (in the episode named \\"Vámonos al Cinema?\\") to have gone off to live with his rich godmother, reportedly \\"unable to stand the riffraff anymore.\\" No one in the show ever talked about him afterwards, or said anything about his absence, as if he had never existed. Villagran's character, Quico, starred in a rather short-lived spin-off series, Ay, Que Quico! in the late 1980s, which attempted to revive the series using a \\"hip-hop\\" twist and gave Villagran's character a slight wardrobe make-over. In the English dub version of the animated series, the main role is sometimes as the antagonist, he is voiced by Doug Erholtz. Instead of being called \\"Tesoro\\" (treasure/darling), he is called \\"Muffin\\". ===Don Ramón=== *Portrayed by Ramón Valdés *Years: 1972-1973, 1973–1979, 1981-1982 Don Ramón is an unemployed widower with a very lanky, nearly emaciated build. He has black wiry hair and a moustache and is usually seen wearing a sun hat, a T-shirt, and jeans. His greatest aspiration seems to be living an uncomplicated life, but in the vecindad, this seems impossible. He is constantly hounded for the rent which he has neglected to pay for fourteen months (a figure that seems to be static since Señor Barriga forgives several months of his rent in several episodes) – however, in one episode, he did pay at least one month of rent while on the verge of eviction from Señor Barriga. His daughter (Chilindrina) is a perennial headache and his neighbor Doña Florinda's response to any imposition on her lifestyle is a loud slap on his face, which causes him to spin in a circle. He eventually became something of a scapegoat for Florindas wrath, with her ending up slapping him when he wasn't even present when something went wrong. Although rather high-strung and quick-tempered, Don Ramón manages to keep a fairly upbeat attitude and to (just barely) make a living doing odd jobs. He's also a fan of all sports and pretends to be knowledgeable in them (having demonstrated boxing, bowling, American football, baseball and even bullfighting – with a dummy bull – to the kids), but due to the kids' own shortcomings, he always comes up short. Chavo often mispronounces his name as Ron Damón, that is a common way of spelling by children. One quote popularized by himself is \\"There is no bad work, the downside is having to work\\". He is a fan of Club Necaxa, which in the day was generally known as a perennial mid- table also-ran, per Don Ramón's quote \\"Yo le voy al Necaxa\\", meaning that he neither wished for glory nor suffering. His personality of always being a good-hearted and (not always) noble man, made Don Ramón one of the most cherished characters in the history of the show. In Brazil he is known as Seu Madruga (literally \\"Mr. Dawn\\") and is considered to be the most popular character, with some of his quotes used under many circumstances, not only the funny ones. An example is during the 2000s that was considered the peak of success of the character in the country, Don Ramón was often used heavily as an internet meme, to the point of having several Orkut communities related to him and even fangames with him being the protagonist. In 2010 a book entitled \\"Seu Madruga: Vila e Obra\\" was published exclusively in Brazil in honor of the character and his actor showing curiosities, interviews and unpublished photos about Ramón Valdés. In the English dub version of the animated series, he was known as Mr. Raymond or nicknamed Rister Maymond by El Chavo and was, like Quico, voiced by Doug Erholtz. ===Doña Florinda=== *Portrayed by Florinda Meza *Years: 1972-1973, 1973–1980, 1980–1991 Florinda Corcuera y Villalpando,Viuda de Matalas Cayando, commonly referred to as Doña Florinda, is the mother of Quico and love interest of Professor Jirafales. She is a widow; her late husband, after whom Quico was named, was a naval officer who died at sea. It is often said by Quico that he descansa en pez (a pun on \\"rest in peace\\", literally meaning \\"rests in fish\\", indicating that he was swallowed by a shark). Her full name is Florinda Corcuera y Villalpando, viuda de (widow of) La Regueira. Doña Florinda sees herself as being socially, morally and economically superior to her neighbors (and, according to the book El Diario del Chavo del Ocho, she was indeed rich until the death of her husband, leaving her without a way to obtain money and eventually waste it, forcing her to move to the vecindad), and while not misanthropic, snobbish, or bully-like, she tends to give orders to the others, such as putting signs that ban animals and infants from the vecindad (much to Barriga's chagrin, because she does it without his authorization). She is so fiercely protective of Quico that whenever he is upset, she'll beat up Don Ramón without seeking explanation. In fact, a recurring gag in the series is that she unfairly accuses him of \\"attacking\\" Quico and goes to slap him, even when he is not present in the scene. When Villagran left the show – thus concluding Quico's presence in the vecindad – she still slaps Don Ramón, but less often. This is due to Don Ramón laughing loudly whenever a rude comment is directed towards her (mostly coming from El Chavo). She likes cleanliness and order and also likes to cook and for that reason becomes famous among her neighbours. Once she accepted a partnership selling churros (a Mexican pastry) with Don Ramón. She is easily recognized by the fact that she always keeps her hair in curlers (except in some early episodes), even at work or on vacation in Acapulco. In later episodes, she opens a restaurant called \\"Restaurante Doña Florinda\\". Derisively, the kids call her \\"Vieja Chancluda\\" (\\"vieja\\" being \\"old lady\\", and \\"chancluda\\" as someone who uses \\"chanclas\\", sandals). In the English dubbed version of the animated series, she is known as Mrs. Worthmore (a pun on worth more) and voiced by Kate Higgins. Her restaurant was renamed \\"Mrs. Worthmore's Cafe\\" as well. In Brazil, her name was translated to Dona Florinda. ===Profesor Jirafales=== *Portrayed by Rubén Aguirre *Years: 1973–1980, 1980–1992 Professor Inocencio Jirafales is the school teacher. He is highly educated but naïve, although he carries on a ludicrously innocent relationship with Doña Florinda and patiently teaches way above the heads of his students. He is patient and professionally ethical. When angered, he shouts \\"Ta-ta-ta- taaaaa-TAH!!!\\". His last name is a reference to the very tall Aguirre, who stands at a height of 1.98 m or 6 ft 6 in (\\"jirafa\\" is Spanish for giraffe; the closest English equivalent would be Giraffald). The children (and sometimes adults, most notably Don Ramón) refer to him as \\"Maistro Longaniza\\" (being \\"maistro\\" a mispronounced form of \\"maestro\\", an alternative for \\"professor\\", both meaning \\"teacher\\", and \\"longaniza\\", a long kind of sausage). Although he appears throughout all the series (almost 20 years) having a romance with Dona Florinda, by the time it finished, neither one suggested the possibility of going beyond that idyllic relation – there's an in-joke among the series production that statizes his full name to be \\"Inocencio Jirafales\\", being \\"Inocencio\\" both a real-life name in Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries and a play on \\"innocence\\", thus adding to the \\"innocent\\" way he treats his relationship towards Doña Florinda. Even though he claims to have a strong hatred of violence, Jirafales is more than willing to beat up Don Ramón if he does something stupid or that leaves him outraged (in the episode in which Don Ramón teaches El Chavo some basic boxing classes and even lends his boxing gloves to the kid, Jirafales has beaten him so violently that even Doña Florinda displays disgust over it). In the English dub version of the animated series, he is known as Professor Girafalde (a pun on the word giraffe) or nicknamed Professor Sausage (Maistro Longaniza) or Professor Firehose (in the Fireman episode) and even Professor Drainpipe By El Chavo (sometimes called \\"Professor Girafalges\\" by non-marketing teams) and is voiced by Bob Buchholz. In Brazil his name is written on a few occasions Professor Girafales (nicknamed by the children as Professor Linguiça, in the translation for Portuguese). ===Doña Clotilde=== *Portrayed by Angelines Fernández *Years: 1972-1973, 1973–1980, 1980–1991 Doña Clotilde, sometimes referred to as \\"La bruja del 71\\", is a retired woman who chases after Don Ramón. Because she is old and somewhat eccentric, the kids think she is a witch, and refer to her as \\"The Witch from (Apartment) 71\\". Some of the adults also refer to her as that, often by mistake, due to the kids frequently calling her a \\"witch\\". She refers to herself as señorita (Miss) because she has never been married, which also she gets upset by when called señora (Mrs.), meaning that she is a married woman. In one episode of the series, Chavo stated that \\"She's not a witch because if she were, she would use her magic to turn (herself) into a young, beautiful woman.\\" She is a single woman, thirsty for love, and frequently seeks it with Don Ramón, who is a widower. Because she never wants people to know her real age, she is always saying the number of candles (40 candles) she had to use in her \\"last\\" birthday's cake (she never says to have more than 49) – even then, people never believe her, mostly because she also acts like a senior woman. She has always been in love with Don Ramón, her neighbor. But he is not interested in her, so Doña Clotilde tries and does everything she can to conquer him like bringing him food from the store, buying him medicine when he can't sleep, baking cakes for him, or lending him luggage. In fact, all the times that Don Ramón is \\"interested\\" in her is when she faints in the middle of the yard and was going to bring him something from the store or just when being polite with her is his only choice. When Ramon Valdes left the show, her affections turned towards Jaimito, el cartero. She is always dressed with a blue or pink hat (1950s style) with \\"leaves\\", blue gown, and black shoes. In the beginning of the series she had also a black sweater. Regarding to her income, the source is unknown. Some might suggest she receives a pension, or maybe gets her money out of an inheritance. Otherwise, it would be impossible for her to pay the rent to Señor Barriga, pay her expenses and buy all the things she gives to Don Ramón. In the English dub version of the animated series, she was renamed Miss Pinster (a pun on the word spinster) or nicknamed The Witch of 71 by the children and is voiced by Mona Marshall, like El Chavo. In Brazil her name is Dona Clotilde or Bruxa do 71. Some sources in Spanish misspell her name as Cleotilde. ===Señor Barriga=== * Portrayed by Edgar Vivar * Years: 1972-1973, 1973–1979, 1980–1991 Zenón Barriga y Pesado is the landlord of the vecindad. Bolaños states that Señor Barriga prefers going personally to receive the residents' rents in order to save up his own time or a rent collector's salary. He rarely succeeds in collecting rent from Don Ramón and is greeted upon his every arrival by being (accidentally) kicked, tripped, beaten, or hit by a flying object thrown by El Chavo. His last name is a reference to his obesity (\\"barriga\\" is both Spanish and Portuguese for \\"belly\\", but the surname actually exists). In two episodes throughout the series (the first when Don Ramón buys a bowling ball while working as a buyer/salesman of home antiques; the second when Doña Florinda first sets up a restaurant) his full name is revealed to be \\"Zenón Barriga y Pesado\\" (literally \\"Zeno Belly and Heavy\\", but Pesado is a real surname too), and \\"Zenón\\" being a pun on \\"Cenón\\" (\\"dining man\\" or \\"big dinner\\"); Zenón is also the Spanish form of Zeno. He is also well known because of his patience with Don Ramón and his unpunctual rent payments and all the kids' (mostly Chavo's) misbehavior like punching him or nicknaming him (always making fun of his obesity). In one episode, he follows through on his eviction threat to Don Ramón, but while he is packing his belongings, Chavo and Quico come across an old scrapbook with pictures of Don Ramón as a boxer in his younger years. Barriga is overcome with emotion; as it turns out, he was heavily in debt and was about to go to jail when he desperately bet against Don Ramón in a boxing match, and won back enough money to clear his debts. Even though he is the victim of Chavo's various pranks, he cares very deeply about him, even offering to take him to Acapulco instead of his son Ňoño, who is off on a camping trip with the Boy Scouts. In the English dub version of the series, he is renamed Mr. Beliarge (pun on the word belly and large) and is voiced by Dave Mallow. In Brazil, his name translates to Seu Barriga (literally \\"Mr. Belly\\") or Senhor Barriga. ===La Popis=== * Portrayed by Florinda Meza Doña Florinda's niece and Quico's cousin. Cutesy and dumb, Popis was usually only present in schoolroom scenes until after Quico left the series, when she filled in for his character in remakes of old episodes. She would frequently say \\"Acúsalo con tu mamá\\" (\\"Tell on him with your mom\\") sometimes at inappropriate moments, known in the English dub of the animated series as \\"I'm telling...\\", such as when Professor Jirafales told Quico that he gave the wrong answer. Whenever she says or does something wrong, she blames it on her doll, Serafina, which she loved as a daughter. In the English dub version of the animated series, she is renamed as Phoebe, her doll is renamed as Stephanie and she is voiced by Kate Higgins. She fills in for Chilindrina in the animated series, as Chilindrina never appears or is mentioned in the series. ===Ñoño=== * Portrayed by Edgar Vivar Pronounced NYO-NYO, as in yo-yo, Señor Barriga's son, he is as fat as his father, and thus is always the butt of the classroom's fat jokes. Ñoño was another classmate, but often appeared around the neighborhood if any scenes needed an extra kid. He is well-studied and good-hearted, but like most of the other kids, naïve to say the very least, so he is often taken advantage of. He also substituted for Quico in the later years. Ñoño usually gets teased by his peers due to his weight. In the animated series, he is renamed as Junior and is voiced by Yuri Lowenthal of Ben 10 and Naruto fame. A hard joke on him over his weight was one where Quico and Chilindrina have several balloons and Chavo, hidden in his barrel, burst the balloons first to make his friends angry at each other and then to make them cry. When Ñoño arrives, with balloons too, Chavo confuses him with a balloon and burst his belly making Ñoño to \\"burst\\" leaving only his clothes visible. In Brazil, his name was changed to Nhonho. ===Godínez=== * Portrayed by Horácio Gómez Bolaños An overall and baseball cap-wearing kid who usually keeps to himself and tries to dodge questions in the classroom so he can focus on drawing and playing musical instruments. Godínez is his surname; his given name is unknown. He seems to be a capable student but is totally uninterested. Godínez only appears on rare occasions. Horácio Gómez directed the show for a period. In real life, he was brother to Roberto, creator and writer of the series. In the English dub version of the animated series, he is renamed as Gordon, and is voiced by Kate Higgins. Like his Spanish counterparts, Gordon is funny and makes ridiculous remarks. ===Jaimito, el cartero=== * Portrayed by Raúl Padilla A sociable but forgetful and negligent postal worker who appears in a few of the last episodes and takes over for Don Ramón and Quico in the Chavo segments on the hourlong \\"Chespirito\\". Whenever he enters the vecindad, he is seen carrying an old bicycle, which he cannot ride because he couldn't learn (and he'll be instantly dismissed if he tells at the post office he doesn't know how to ride the bicycle). Jaimito also is rather lazy and tends to avoid carrying out tasks with the excuse of \\"avoiding fatigue\\" (in the English dub of the animated series, his excuse is that \\"his tiredness makes him tired\\"). He hails from Tangamandapio which, although being a real location in Mexico, is thought by fans of being just a coincidental joke (Jaimito once said that \\"Tangamandapio is bigger than New York; it's so big, it doesn't appear in any maps\\"). In the English dub version of the animated series, he is renamed as Manny the Mailman who comes from Upsidedowntown and is voiced by Dave Mallow. In Brazil, his name was changed to Jaiminho, o carteiro and his hometown Tangamandápio. ===Doña Nieves=== * Portrayed by María Antonieta de las Nieves Chilindrina's great-grandmother, and Don Ramón's grandmother (the one constantly referred to by Doña Florinda). Has character traits of both Don Ramón and Chilindrina. In some late \\"Chavo\\" episodes and early \\"Chespirito\\" episodes, she also takes over for her grandson Don Ramón. María Antonieta de las Nieves had been playing a nameless character similar to Doña Nieves for years in a variety of sketches, but she did not work particularly well in the Don Ramón role; for one thing, it was awkward that Doña Nieves and Chilindrina could not appear in scenes together except via special effects. In the series, she is renamed as Mrs. Nieves. By the late 1980s, her character had virtually disappeared from \\"El Chavo\\". In Brazil, her name was changed to Dona Neves. She has also appeared in various Dr. Chapatín sketches. ==Minor characters== *Doña Eduviges (Janet Arceo), only in 1973: For two episodes she lives in the upstairs apartment of the vecindad and interacts with the other characters. Except for dressing differently and living in a different apartment, she acts exactly the same as Doña Clotilde, right down to her heavy-handed flirting with Don Ramón. But obviously she was crazy, because one time she said that she dyed her hair white just because it was fashionable. The kids even call her \\"La Loca de la Escalera\\" (\\"The crazy lady upstairs\\"). In the very next episode, Doña Clotilde is back and Doña Eduviges is never mentioned again. Jaimito, el cartero is assumed to have moved into her apartment or one next to it, since he usually came from the same direction. *Paty and Gloria, in 1972, 1975 and 1978: Paty (who is Chavo's age) and her aunt Gloria (who is Don Ramón's) move into the upstairs apartment. They are considered to be very beautiful and the men and boys of the vecindad immediately fall in love with them, while the women and girls get jealous of them. The 1978 Paty (Ana Lilian de la Macorra) became a regular character, appearing in many episodes of the half-hour version's last season. In the English dub version of the animated series, Paty and Gloria names were not changed (except Paty was given another t in her name) and were both voiced by Tara Platt. Gloria was interpreted by Maribel Fernández in 1972, Olivia Leiva in 1975 and Regina Torné in 1978; Paty was interpreted in 1972 by Patty Juárez, Rosita Bouchot in 1975, Ana Lilian de la Macorra in 1978 and Patty Strevel in 1987. *Malicha (María Luisa Alcalá), only in 1974: Don Ramón's god- daughter. During María Antonieta de las Nieves' absence, Malicha briefly replaced her. Much like Doña Eduviges, she disappeared after a small number of episodes and was barely missed. *Don Román (Germán Robles), only in 1975: He takes Don Ramón's place in an episode of the 1975 season; he is said to be Don Ramón's cousin. In Brazil, his name was changed to Seu Madroga, being analogous to Don Ramón/Seu Madruga. *Señor Hurtado (José Antonio Mena and Ricardo de Pascual), in 1974 and 1976: A suspicious man (actually a thief) who lives in the vecindad in a single episode conveniently named \\"El Ladrón De La Vecindad\\". His felonies are charged to Chavo by mistake (which results in everyone in the vecindad accusing El Chavo of theft, causing him to temporarily leave the vecindad in a nocturnal scene full of sorrow, thus making this one of the saddest scenes of the series), but he ultimately returns the stolen objects, restoring Chavo's innocence towards his neighbors; however, Hurtado never does claim the robberies himself. His name is reference to the Spanish word \\"hurtado\\", implying he's, in fact, a thief (\\"hurtar\\" is Spanish for \\"to steal\\"). In the English dub of the animated series, he is known as \\"Mr. Crookley\\" and since the English version's credits did not list the character, it is possible that he is either voiced by Kirk Thornton (who does various bit parts of the show) or Dave Mallow (judging by his voice which sounds like a combination of Manny and Beliarge). In Brazil, his name was translated into Senhor Furtado, fitting to his surname (\\"furtar\\" is Portuguese for \\"to steal\\") very similarly to the original Spanish language. *Senõr Pelonsillo (a.k.a. Señor Calvillo), only in 1976: This bald character only appears in a two-part episode called \\"Se Vende La Vecindad.\\" In this episode, Sr. Barriga discovers that he has heart problems and must move to a location with a lower altitude. Senõr Pellosino thus offers to buy the vecindad, or neighborhood, from him. Everybody is against it, and had a crush on Doña Cleotilde.

Eset Batyr led a large army of Kazakhs and defeated the aggression of Khiva. Eset Batyr also successfully defended his ancestral lands against Kokand Khanate's aggression.Torekhanov, Tauman. Dala Herculesi, Almaty: Atamura, 2008, == Anti-Colonial Uprising == In 1847–1858 years Eset batyr led a revolt of Kazakhs against the Russian administration. Tsar's administration sent two Cossack detachments and 200 Kazakhs controlled by Sultan Taukin and Major Mikhailov from the Ural division. Also, 600 Kazakhs were sent under the leadership of Elekey Kasymov by the Tsar administration. Eset batyr sent 800 people against Russian troops who were destroyed by people of Eset Batyr.Torekhanov, Tauman. Kanmen Zhazylgan Tagdyrlar, Almaty: Atamura, 1999, In 1854–1858 years, there was uprising of Kazakhs living in Aral region, due to high taxes of the Tsar administration. At that time, extortion or taxes carried out by camels. For instance, the military campaign of Perovskii in 1853 to conquer city of Akmeshit in Kazakhstan required almost 8 thousand camels. Kazakhs organized an uprising and moved to the territory of the Emba river. The rebels put a number of demands: removal of tax for households, termination of sending of punitive detachments to the Kazakh steppe, allowing usage of pastures and the possibility to move on the banks of rivers Zhem, Mugadzhar, Elek, Kobda, Zhayyk. V.A Perovskiy organized a punitive detachment and sent Baron Wrangel with a large army to suppress the uprisings. Eset Batyr agreed with Baron Wrangel, but the war did not stop and subsequently Eset batyr continued military actions against the military colonial posts and Cossack troops. The newly created punitive detachment under the leadership of Sultan Arslan Zhantorin was defeated by the army of Eset Batyr. Sultan Arslan Zhantorin was killed. == The suppression of uprising == The suppression of the uprising was accompanied by mass killings of civilian population. Many rebels were executed while others were sent to jail such as Batyr Becket Serkebaeyev. In 1858 uprising was totally suppressed. The Russian Government understood that it would be unsuccessful to continue using force against Eset Batyr and Governor-General Katenin offered peace to Eset Batyr promising to comply with the demands of rebellions. Eset Batyr and the Russian administration reached a peace deal. == Eset batyr in historical essays == * AI Dobrosmyslov, \\"Turgayskaya Oblast - historical sketch\\" (Orenburg, 1902, pp. 407–409): \\"The most important Batyrs were Shekti batyrs Dzhankozha Nurmuhamedov and Eset Kotibarov.

The contest was held on November 29, 2008 in Aarhus, Denmark and the participating countries were Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland. Each country submitted two songs to participate in the first round with the top placing entry from each country proceeding to the super-final. The winner of the MGP Nordic 2008 was Norway's The BlackSheeps with \\"Oro jaska beana\\". == Format == Each country partakes in a national selection for MGP Nordic. The top two songs from each country proceed to MGP Nordic. Eight songs participate in the contest to make it more substantial. All eight songs in the Final are performed. After the eight songs have been performed the Scandinavian countries vote for their favourite. After the voting has closed, the top song from each participating country is announced. The top four songs then sing again in the Super Final. The Scandinavian countries then vote again for their favourites. The winner is announced after the second round of voting has taken place. The voting system is different from the Eurovision and the Junior Eurovision Song Contest. It is also different from the Eurovision Dance Contest, making it unique in European contests. The percentage of votes given by a country is translated directly into points, e.g. 21% equals 21 points. No country can get nil points as each country gives points to every country. A country cannot vote for themselves, like in the Eurovision contests. The winning song then sings again as the credits roll.MGP Nordic 2008 (2008-11-29). SVT1.

The village of Illingworth has competitive sports teams within the area including Crossleys Juniors (football), Illingworth C.C. (cricket) and Illingworth A.R.L.F.C.

Illingworth is one of the Halifax villages that have all become suburbs through urban expansion. Situated on the side and top of a hill, this is an exposed area, and feels cooler than lower down districts. An ancient settlement, many old buildings remain, but many have been lost including the old Talbot public house, demolished in the 1930s for a new building to be erected, in a Tudor style with stained glass windows. This in turn has been demolished in 2009. The Commercial Inn is another pub now demolished, and on its site there are some mews style private housing. The old village smithy stands derelict. In the 1970s, some ancient cottages were lost on Church Terrace, as were some farmsteads on the upper west of Keighley Road to make way for the Abbey Park social housing scheme. The greater part of this housing scheme has in turn been demolished to make way for private sector housing. Housing in Illingworth includes a mixture of social housing: the Halifax council built their estates towards the north of Halifax and more recently new private housing. Illingworth is on the whole in what could be described as an attractive setting, the countryside is never far away, and there are many ancient buildings, but the village centre has witnessed severe deterioration of the environment with the aforesaid demolitions of the two public houses, and the \\"tram shelter\\". which gave a focal point on Wrigley Hill. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Illingworth, West Yorkshire and Mixenden ==References Category:Villages in West Yorkshire Category:Areas of Halifax, West Yorkshire ","title":"Illingworth, West Yorkshire"},{"id":"19249885","text":"Mpoti is a village in the Sotouboua prefecture in the Centrale Region of Togo.Maplandia world gazetteer ==References== Category:Populated places in Centrale Region, Togo ","title":"Mpoti"},{"id":"19249948","text":"David McMillan (born 1956) is a British-Australian drug smuggler who is best known for being the only Westerner on record as having successfully escaped Bangkok's Klong Prem prison. His exploits were the subject of the 2011 Australian telemovie, Underbelly Files: The Man Who Got Away. ==Early life== McMillan was born in Saint Marylebone, London, England, on 9 April 1956. He is the son of John McMillan CBE, who was the controller of Associated-Rediffusion Television, and his Australian wife. After his parents separated, he emigrated to Australia with his mother and sister. He attended Caulfield Grammar School in Melbourne, Victoria. As a child, 12-year-old McMillan appeared nightly on the Nine Network's 'Peters Junior News', presenting news stories for children in a regular 5-minute TV bulletin. After working as a cinema projectionist and camera operator in Sydney, he began a short-lived career in advertising with Masius Wynne Williams in Melbourne. ==Criminal career== A part-time job at a city cinema introduced McMillan to the fringes of the underworld; a group of safe-crackers who had turned to narcotics when police surveillance curtailed their traditional profession. Connections with the free-marijuana hippie lobbyists brought those two worlds together and a tempting opportunity for McMillan, who was well-travelled. At the time, he was a distributor of the monthly magazine, The Australasian Weed, a drug-reform periodical, and advocated the complete lifting of the prohibition against drugs for recreational use. McMillan then began a career as a drug smuggler, during which he developed the bag-duplication system at Sydney's Kingsford-Smith Airport in the late 1970s as he smuggled hashish from India. In 1979, McMillan fell out with disgraced peer Lord Tony Moynihan after the exiled lord attempted to trap McMillan in a gambling-sting operation using the large-scale bets of the Chinese-run cockfights in Manila. Moynihan had hoped to employ McMillan's technical expertise to detonate an explosive capsule in the necks of fighting cocks, and so determine the winners. Moynihan planned only to swindle McMillan out of the betting stake after a test game. McMillan was alerted to the scam by his Chinese film-making friends and left the Philippines after cautioning Moynihan. Lord Moynihan would later move on to hoodwink smuggler Howard Marks in the 1980s, resulting in Marks's conviction and imprisonment in America. Imprudent spending attracted the attention of federal police when a Clénet Coachworks car was imported from California bearing papers that had greatly undervalued the vehicle. This slip-up led to a major investigation which eventually revealed houses, businesses and properties along the eastern coast of Australia bought with cash and valued in millions of dollars. These assets later became the subject of Australia's first important confiscation of drug-earned assets. At the peak of his career in the 1980s, McMillan was a multi-millionaire and maintained homes, offices and apartments all over the world. After three years, McMillan and business partner Michael Sullivan were arrested following Operation Aries, a Victoria Police/Federal Police taskforce operation reported to have cost over A$2 million. McMillan and Sullivan, along with their partners, Clelia Teresa Vigano and Mary Escolar Castillo respectively, had been arrested on 5 January 1982 for conspiracy to import heroin. The four had several false passports between them and stood trial with S. Chowdury and Brendan Healy on twelve counts of conspiring to import drugs between 1979 and 1981. Healy was acquitted on all charges, and nine others accused of the conspiracy accepted indemnity against prosecution in exchange for testifying against their co- conspirators.[3] McMillan stood accused of travelling under 30 false passports and keeping station houses in London, Brussels and Bangkok. The trial heard charges of an attempt to escape Melbourne's high-security Pentridge Prison by helicopter using former SAS personnel in a scheme engineered by a vengeful Lord Moynihan.Sydney Morning Herald. Copter Plan Foiled. 21 January 1983 The prosecution opposed bail for Castillo, who had a four-month-old baby with Sullivan, because she had access to funds and it was thought she could flee to her wealthy parents in her native Colombia.

The consequent six- month trial produced 116 witnesses and a hung jury that finally returned a verdict after seven days sequestration. Despite being acquitted of 11 of the 12 counts, McMillan was found guilty of the remaining count and was sentenced to 17 years, before being released in 1993 on parole.an article in the Australian Financial Review gives his view of day-release after a long sentence During the trial, agents from the United States’ Drug Enforcement Administration testified against the Thai national Chowdury who they believed had links to the Golden Triangle's third biggest heroin exporter, and to the kidnap and murder of an agent's wife in Chiang Mai. McMillan denied any connection with Chowdury, and was acquitted of the relevant charge, however the American involvement led to a lifelong antipathy between the DEA and McMillan.[19].Mills, James, The Underground Empire, 1978 McMillan was arrested in April 2012, in an operation referred to Bromley police by the UK Border Agency concerning an ounce of heroin mailed from Pakistan. In the consequent trial, an undercover policewoman testified to delivering a package from which thirty grams of Asian heroin had been removed. McMillan had not opened the parcel, addressed to a previous resident, and denied any knowledge of the unidentified sender.[20].Trial Transcript, Croydon Crown Court, 5 August 2012 After a six-day trial McMillan was sentenced at the Croydon Crown Court to six years’ imprisonment for the evasion of the prohibition on importing A-class drugs. The verdict is subject to appeal as at 2014. ==Thailand== While on parole, McMillan flew to Thailand, travelling under the name Daniel Westlake. After a close-call at Don Muang airport, he was arrested in Bangkok's Chinatown and charged with heroin trafficking. He was held in Klong Prem Central Prison. Klong Prem Central prison (Thai: คลองเปรม; rtgs: Khlong Prem) is a maximum security prison in Chatuchak District, Bangkok, Thailand. The prison has several separate sections and houses up to 20,000 inmates. For two years, McMillan watched as inmates fell prey to drugs, disease, violence, death and despair. Due to his financial status, McMillan lived more comfortably than the average inmate while in prison.http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/09/16/lifestyle/lifestyle_30048997.php McMillan had his own chef and servants, dined on food bought from the supermarket, and also had his own office, television and radio. Facing the death penalty and a transfer to Asia's most notorious prison Bang Kwang Central Prison, also known colloquially as the Bangkok Hilton, McMillan resolved that this was not going to be the end of him. McMillan later stated, \\"I had no interest in my trial. I knew what it was going to be like – a farce, a mockery, a sham and a travesty – and that I would receive the death penalty.\\" McMillan escaped from Klong Prem in August 1996, never to be seen in Thailand again. During the night he cut the cell bars with hacksaws, scaled seven inner walls, then mounted the outer wall using a bamboo-pole ladder. Once out of the prison, McMillan changed into civilian clothes and carried an umbrella as he walked away from the prison. McMillan credits the umbrella with helping him escape, saying that \\"escaping prisoners don't carry umbrellas\\". Four hours later, with a false passport, he was on a flight to Singapore and 12 hours later was sitting in a hotel. Prison authorities raced to the airport to look for him once they realised he was missing, however, McMillan caught a plane in time and later said, \\"There’s nothing better than the suction sound of an aeroplane door being sealed.\\"http://www.metro.co.uk/news/862906-david- mcmillan-how-i-made-my-jailbreak-from-klong-prem-prison#ixzz1gVCpeYCd Future Australian attorney-general Robert McClelland when praising Australia's embassy in Thailand remarked that McMillan: \\"… a prisoner... escaped from the Thai jail in quite exceptional and athletic circumstances. In terms of mere escape, it was really quite an achievement.\\" An account of the Thai prison and his jail break can be found in his 2008 autobiography, Escape.http://www.thaiprisonlife.com/books/escape/ ==Pakistan== After fleeing Thailand using false documents, McMillan was kept safe in Balouchistan, Pakistan under the protection of Mir Noor Jehan Magsi of the Magsi clan, from where he began operations to Scandinavia.Andrew Rule (2000). The One Who Got Away. The Sunday Age, Melbourne.29 October 2000 McMillan was arrested in Lahore, Pakistan, as a result of the confession of a captured courier. McMillan was flown to Karachi, Pakistan, and held in Karachi Central Jail. This jail maintained a class system for prisoners, through which McMillan kept servants and private rooms. Due to a financial dispute with the prison superintendent concerning his illegal mobile phone, McMillan was transferred at night to the Hyderabad jail, where he was kept in the dungeons until being rescued by Lord Magsi. Not wishing to add to the existing Interpol warrants, McMillan returned to Karachi to stand trial, where he was acquitted by a Customs Court judge who found there was no evidence that McMillan had sponsored the courier, and that the government of Thailand had not made representations for extradition. The courier, a former boxer from Liverpool, was sentenced to five years in custody, eventually released and has since disappeared. During his time in Hyderabad, McMillan formed a friendship with the members of a Moscow street gang, who were completing a ten-year sentence for the hijack of a commercial liner outside their Russian prison. The gang had been separated by the Russian prison authorities, a decision overcome by gang leader Andreas, who flew his hijacked aircraft to Krasnoyarsk from where he freed the other members of his team before flying to Pakistan, then under the control of General Zia al Huq, known for his independence from both the Soviet Union and the US. The story of the Russian prisoners and their ordeal is outlined by McMillan in Unforgiving Destiny, although the author withdrew the commissioned book, \\"White Russians\\", as \\"too violent — even for me — and depressing\\".\\"Unforgiving Destiny\\", Amazon-Createspace books, 2017, p. 397 ==Return to England== McMillan returned to London in 1999. He was arrested in 2000 in Copenhagen, Denmark. He was arrested at Heathrow airport in 2002 for smuggling 500 grams of class A drugs. For this crime he served a sentence of two years. As of 2007, the warrant for McMillan's arrest in Thailand for heroin trafficking is still active and he is still wanted in Australia for breaching parole. However, the UK government does not extradite anyone to a country which carries out the death penalty, and breaching parole is not an extraditable offence. In June 2009, McMillan appeared as a guest in a 50-minute episode of Danny Dyer's Deadliest Men 2: Living Dangerously, which aired on Bravo TV. The episode includes interviews and presents McMillan as having settled peacefully with his partner Jeanette and children. An Australian television company Screentime, released a telemovie that aired on Channel Nine in February 2011, loosely based on McMillan's smuggling, arrest, imprisonment in Bangkok and briefly outlined his escape from Klong Prem. The low-budget film was the 3rd in the Underbelly Files series. McMillan is to see published McVillain: the Man Who Got Away, scheduled for launch 1 April 2011.http://www.panmacmillan.com.au/display_title.asp?ISBN=9780980717044&Author;=McMillan,%20David McVillain is the first in a series planned for the great rises and falls in McMillan's life. Although launched on the springboard of the Underbelly telemovie, the books differ in almost every factual event according to McMillan. In November, 2014, Thailand formally began extradition proceedings against McMillan in London. He was arrested at the request of the Thai government, and held at Wandsworth prison. A long-running challenge began at the Westminster Magistrates Court headed by defence barrister Tim Owen, QC.Westminster Magistrates Court record May, 2016 Evidence was presented detailing human-rights abuses under the rule of the Thai generals who had staged a coup in May of that year, as well as expert evidence on Thai prison conditions. However, Judge Arbuthnot ruled against McMillan, as did the UK Home Secretary. However, two weeks before McMillan was due to be sent back to Bangkok, the Thai authorities withdrew their request, stating technical reasons. McMillan was freed in September, 2016. In late April, 2017, McMillan published an autobiography of the 35-year pursuit by authorities that resulted in capture and escapes throughout the world, focusing on the persistence of one DEA agent. Unforgiving Destiny – The Relentless Pursuit of a Black Marketeer () is dominated by the years in Baluchistan and Afghanistan, his dealings with Taliban as a friend is kidnapped, and his role as advisor to a tribal warlord. A contrast is made between the central Asian badlands and the high life when at the peak of McMillan's smuggling success throughout Colombia, New York and Scandinavia. Of the latest book, McMillan says: “The challenge is to present the facts, real life, as part of readers’ own lives when, for me, the events were often felt as unrelenting terror. I suppose the fact I was up against implacable forces helped me – not in survival, of course, but in telling the story.”http://davidmcmillan.net/ He says the lengthy book is, “an attempt to fill in the important blanks, perhaps my last.” A link to the music of the period is online.https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL15mJziZMVmuKG4CY7yCpyaaxRPjII33I Recordings of the author narrating selections of the book are available.http://unforgivingdestiny.com/ Of this latest release, McMillan says, \\"I have tried to craft the action to higher standards, but with biography, there's no dodging the revealing of motives.

It is a Grade II* listed building. ==Building== Only the west tower from the medieval (15th century) church survives. The rest was built in 1739 by Rhodes of Barlborough and 1839 by Colvin. It is of ashlar with a lead roof. The graveyard includes a 1963 model of the earlier church. The clock tower has two clocks, one facing West, the other East which would be visible to people approaching from either direction along Main Street. ==Notable burials== The church is reputed to be the burial place of Will Scarlet. The place is not known, but a piece of the earlier church serves as a memorial. ==Rocking Ceremony== The Church of St Mary of the Purification is the only church that is known to continue to hold an annual Rocking Ceremony during which a baby boy, born nearest to Christmas Day and having married, Christian parents living in Blidworth, is “rocked” in a cradle on the Feast of the Purification of Mary, which is on the Sunday nearest to Candlemas. The ceremony is a symbolic enactment of the story from the Bible found in Luke's gospel, depicting the Presentation of Christ at a temple.Baby Jack becomes the 91st Rocking baby Chad (Mansfield local newspaper), 27 February 2013, p.54 Accessed 31 July 2018 It is thought to have started in the 13th century, but was banned from 1600. The custom was revived in 1842 by the vicar, John Lowndes but then fell out of use. It was revived again in 1922, and has been using the same cradle since then. All of the babies who have taken part in the Rocking Ceremonies have their names recorded upon a plaque at the rear of St Mary's Church with their full name and the year in which they were 'Rocked'. In 2010 a sculpture of a cradle was made to celebrate the custom.

Wave riding sports include swimming, surfing, kayaking, and bodysurfing. In surfing terminology, \\"waterman\\" refers to a versatile athlete who can engage in various forms of water sports depending on conditions. One early person given this title was Duke Kahanamoku. A Waterman may also include in their list of sports; rowing, sailing, kite boarding, windsurfing, scuba diving, freediving, prone paddling, and standup paddleboarding (SUP). Fishing includes both common above water pole fishing and underwater spearfishing, both with a simple spear or a spear gun. Freediving skills are often used when fishing underwater.

The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Liverpool, the archdeaconry of Liverpool and the deanery of Huyton. In the Buildings of England series, Pollard and Pevsner describe the church as being \\"largish\\" with \\"an intimate interior\\". ==History== The church was built in 1843–44 to a design by Edmund Sharpe for the 13th Earl of Derby at a cost of about £20,000 (). It was consecrated on 6 June 1844 by Rt Revd John Bird Sumner, Bishop of Chester. Transepts designed by Edward Paley, Sharpe's successor in the architectural practice, were added in 1860. In 1871–72 a memorial chapel to the 14th Earl of Derby, designed by Paley and Austin, was added. It cost £3,000, which included the cost of a monument with a figure by Matthew Noble. In 1892–93 a new vestry and a new east window by Paley, Austin and Paley were built. An organ was installed in the Derby chapel in 1913. In 1981–82 the church was reordered, a nave altar was introduced, and meeting and service facilities were installed in the base of the tower. ==ArchitectureExterior=== The church is constructed in sandstone with freestone dressings and has a stone tile roof. Its architectural style is mainly Early English. The plan of the church consists of a west steeple, a five-bay nave with north and south aisles and a clerestory, a north porch, north and south transepts, a five-bay chancel with a north chapel (formerly the Derby chapel), and a south vestry. The tower is in three stages, with angle buttresses. In the bottom stage is a west doorway with lancet windows above. The middle stage also contains windows with pointed arches. In the top stage are two-light bell openings containing quatrefoil tracery, flanked by blind arches. The tower is surmounted by a broach spire with two tiers of lucarnes. Each bay on the south side of both the aisles and the clerestory contains a pair of windows. The transepts have buttresses, a corbel table, two-light north and south windows in Decorated style, and small west windows. The chancel also has a corbel table. Its east window has five lights with Perpendicular tracery, and the two two-light south windows are in Decorated style. The north chapel is also in Decorated style, and has a four-light north window. Along the north side of the church are three-light windows, and a frieze of quatrefoils. The vestry has a square-headed window and an east doorway re-set from an earlier doorway. ===Interior=== The nave arcades are carried on quatrefoil piers with foliage capitals. The chancel arch includes carvings of Queen Victoria and the Archbishop of Canterbury. The nave is floored with 19th-century relief tiles, and there are encaustic tiles in the chapel. Inside the church is an intricately carved bench from Knowsley Hall which is dated 1646, and royal arms dated 1567. The reredos, dating from 1866, was designed by Edwin Stirling. In the Derby chapel is a recumbent alabaster effigy by Matthew Noble of the 14th Earl of Derby. Along the chancel walls are memorial mosaics dating from the 1910s and 1920s. The octagonal font was created in 1890 by Stubbs and Sons of Liverpool. The pulpit is polygonal and dates from about 1946. Stained glass in the church includes the east window of 1893 by Shrigley and Hunt, a window in each transept by Lavers and Barraud, and a window in the south wall of the chancel of 1923 by Powell and Sons. The three-manual organ was made in 1913 by Rushworth and Dreaper of Liverpool. ==External features== The churchyard contains the war graves of a soldier of World War I, and two soldiers of World War II. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Knowsley, Merseyside *List of architectural works by Edmund Sharpe *List of ecclesiastical works by Paley and Austin ==References== Citations Sources * * Although this is self-published, it is a scholarly work and fully referenced throughout.

It was established in 1855 as an almshouse. It was then used as a workhouse for inmates with short sentences who worked the surrounding farmland. It was later rebuilt in the 1880s and again in 1974. Bridgewater State Hospital currently houses 309 inmates, all of whom are adult males.Kauffman, Kelsey:Prison Officers and their world, p. 42. Harvard Press.1988 The facility was the subject of the 1967 documentary Titicut Follies. Bridgewater State Hospital falls under the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Department of Correction. ==History== By the 1970s, the campus of the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Bridgewater (MCIB) housed four separate facilities - the State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, the Treatment Center for Sexually Dangerous Persons, a center for alcoholics, and a minimum-security prison. In 1968, hearings were conducted after a study showed that 30 inmates were committed to the state hospital illegally. Most of the prisoners stayed at Bridgewater because they did not have the legal skills or money available to help their claims. Many of the prisoners' terms had long expired. An example of this was a patient named Charles who was sentenced to Bridgewater in 1910 for breaking and entering. The maximum time for this felony was two years, and he still remained in the prison after 1967. Furthermore, in later news, the number of inmates at Bridgewater was found to have grown to 500. Many felt that society was not doing its job in distinguishing men who needed regular prison rehabilitation and psychiatric help. Changes were needed in what constitutes a person to be sent to a mental hospital. Also among the changes that needed to be implemented were the confidentially between the inmates and the doctors, as well as having a standard by which a person is considered mentally insane. Bridgewater State Hospital in 2016 In 1967, a legislative committee investigated allegations of \\"cruel, inhuman, and barbarous treatment\\". Witnesses were able to describe problems with the water and sewage systems, and insufficient medical, kitchen, and recreational facilities. As a result, in 1972, John Boone, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Corrections, closed the segregation unit at Bridgewater State Hospital because it required maintenance. Bridgewater's facilities were not suitable for the standard means of health and living. Also, 90-year-old cell blocks did not have any toilets. Boone closed the Departmental Segregation Unit at Bridgewater to hold hearings for the 16 inmates who had been transferred out of Norfolk. Albert DeSalvo, who confessed to being the Boston Strangler, was an inmate at Bridgewater in 1967. He briefly escaped and was transferred to the maximum-security prison at Walpole. At one time at Bridgewater State Hospital, many of the inmates were there long after their sentences were complete. In 1968, over 250 cases of forgotten men at Bridgewater were reviewed. Some inmates were at Bridgewater over 25 years. Some inmates were transferred to Bridgewater from other jails and prison facilities and kept at Bridgewater for much longer than their sentences required. In September 2016, Governor Charlie Baker announced the hospital will be moving away from a historical prison model and toward a more clinical approach to the treatment of the mentally ill. According to the plan, every inmate will receive an individualized plan of treatment within 10 days of admission to the facility. Inmates who are on psychiatric medications would be seen by a psychiatrist on a timely basis and the facility would move to electronic health records. ==Documentary== Titicut Follies is a documentary film that highlights cases of patient mistreatment at Bridgewater in 1967. The film's title is taken directly from a name originally given to an annual talent show performed by the patients. Filmmaker Frederick Wiseman observed the hospital for 29 days, filming the harsh treatment the inmates received from the correctional officers, and how doctors were not aware of the proper treatment the inmates needed. This was apparent with one inmate who was classified as a paranoid schizophrenic. He came to Bridgewater for medical testing, but ended up being a resident there. He received powerful medication that made his mental state worsen as time progressed. He went to a review board to explain that he did not need to be at Bridgewater because the treatment he was receiving was not proper for his well being. His complaints were disregarded and the board suggested stronger doses of tranquilizers. His case was not rare at Bridgewater. Throughout the film, the viewer can see the mistreatment inmates received from the guards and staff. In one instance, the guards were harassing an inmate because his cell was not clean. He was obviously mentally ill and frustrated by the repeated questions the guards asked him about his cell but he could not do much. Furthermore, one inmate was not eating, so he was force fed by one of the doctors at the facility. While force feeding him with a tube, the doctor smokes a cigarette, whose ashes mix with the water and other liquids he is giving the inmate. The documentary then flashed to the death of the same inmate. In addition, when the inmates were in their cells, they did not have any clothing. Massachusetts attempted to block release of the film; much legal action followed. It ended up partially prohibited in the state of Massachusetts (only). ==Officer deaths at Bridgewater== * Feb. 13, 1928 - Nightwatchman Wilfred Gerrior and night supervisor George E. Amlaw were strangled to death and clubbed during an escape attempt.Plunkett, John. “State Farm Inmates Kill Two Guards”, Biddeford Daily Journal’’, Biddeford, Maine, February 13, 1928. * January 1, 1942 - Two inmates beat officer Franklin Weston to death in the carpenter shop, where they stole several tools to use as weapons; they were shortly discovered by Howard Murphy, whom they attacked and killed. They later encountered Officer George Landry and beat him to death. ==Controversy and reform== 2017 A major reform initiative by Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker replaced management of the hospital and four-fifths of the staff, granted a significant amount of turnaround funding, removed uniformed guards, and closed the \\"intensive treatment\\" unit where forced restraints and solitary confinement were used. After about five months with a new system of conflict prevention and resolution, a visiting The Boston Globe reporter said that the institution felt more like a hospital than a prison after the reform. After Years Of Scrutiny And Inmate Deaths, Bridgewater State Hospital Shows Signs Of Progress 2014 A Civil lawsuit was settled out of court regarding a patient's declining health from abuse, namely, being excessively restrained and secluded. The particular patient had spent over 6000 hours in isolation, despite never having had been convicted of a crime. 2014 Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick formally reprimanded Administration officials regarding their attempts to cover up procedural mishaps, including the use of forced restraint, that precipitated the death of a patient in 2009. Then superintendent Karin Bergeron was exposed in internal e-mails as having attempted to cover up reports of the murdered patient's death after it was ruled a homicide. 2014 The Boston Globe published an exposé on how the use of forced restraints – in which patients are bound to a table by hands and legs –increased over a 5-year period at an alarmingly high rate, in spite of the death of a patient in 2009 resulting from the use of such \\"four point restraints\\". The Department of Correction's own Internal Affairs Unit had formally found that in 2011, facility officers Howard and Raposo had violated a procedural policy that states that guards shall never put pressure on a restrained inmate's back. Surveillance video revealed that the two guards pushed down on a handcuffed patient's back with force, forcing his chest toward his knees, a maneuver sometimes called “suitcasing.” According to the article:\\"In December 2013 alone, Bridgewater State Hospital, with a population that hovers around 325, held patients in seclusion and restraints for more than 13,000 hours — a rate of 1,491 hours per 1,000 patient days, vastly more than other state-run psychiatric facilities. Five Department of Mental Health facilities with about 626 in-patient beds held patients in seclusion and restraints for a total of only 135 hours in that month — 7.07 hours per 1,000 patient days.\\" 2012 Fox News Boston released the security camera footage of officers strapping down a patient whose death had been ruled a homicide in 2009. The tape's footage is controversial because officer Derek Howard could be seen using an illegal restraint practice. 2009 A patient was killed when improperly restrained. The man's family was awarded $3 million in damages to settle a lawsuit. At that time Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick called for an investigation into the practices at Bridgewater. 2008 George A. Billadeau, a police Sergeant at the facility, was the subject of a formal complaint that accused him of making a racial slur to a patient 2007, The Disability Law Center, a human rights advocacy firm in Boston, sued Bridgewater State Hospital over illegally restraining a patient. 2007 A patient committed suicide by hanging himself in the showers while there on a 30-day court evaluation when BSH staff failed to prevent it. 2004 The family of murdered inmate William Mosher planned to sue the state and BSH for $150 million for failing to protect their son. 2004 William Mosher Jr., a patient who suffered from bipolar disorder, was murdered in his room by a fellow inmate when the facility failed to protect him by keeping his enemy away. 1999 Massachusetts Correctional Legal Services served and won a successful lawsuit against Bridgewater for an officer throwing acid in a patient's face. Until the lawsuit, the DOC and BSH had dropped the investigation midway through. 1989 ABC news Nightline broadcast a TV news special outlining mistreatment of the patients at Bridgewater State Hospital 1987 After eight patient deaths in a year, The New York Times did an exposé on Bridgewater State Hospital and its poor treatment of patients. ==References * Bridgewater State Hospital - Mass.

His parents were Betsey (Holman) Babbitt, and Nathaniel Babbitt, a blacksmith, tavern owner and ensign in the militia of Oneida County, New York. As a child, he attended public school and worked on the family farm. He \\"possessed a most ingenious and inquiring disposition\\",(archive) and by the time he was twenty he was working in a machine shop and had learned the trades of wheelwright, machinist and file maker. He took an interest in and studied chemistry from a professor who visited the workshop occasionally to give instruction to the workmen. By age 22 Babbitt had enough money to open his first machine shop in Little Falls, where for 12 years, he manufactured pumps and engines. During this time he invented a practicable and economical mowing machine, one of the first made in America. His business was destroyed by a flood in 1834, but he persevered. ==Manufacturing== Babbitt's Soap and Saleratus Manufacturing Babbitt moved to New York City, where he began to manufacture \\"saleratus\\" (or sodium bicarbonate, commonly called baking soda). He used a process which he invented, and sold the product in small, convenient and well marked packages. He packaged and marketed his product so well that he quickly controlled most of the sodium bicarbonate market. He started producing a baking powder, a soap powder and several varieties of soap, all of them also successfully marketed well, and very popular. In 1851, he became the first to manufacture and market soap in individual bars, which he packaged attractively and added a claim of quality. He took the ordinary and proved it could be turned into a marketable product. He, along with others like him, helped change American merchandising. Babbitt invented most of the machinery he used in his production plants. He owned extensive iron works and machine shops in Whitesboro, New York. He held more than 100 patents. In addition to inventions concerning his own field of business, his invention ideas ranged from wind motors, to gun barrels, armor plate, ventilators, steam engine appliances, canal boats and artificial icemakers. ==Advertising== Babbitt's Soap advertisement Babbitt became known as a genius of advertising. He rivaled his friend P. T. Barnum in originality and success, becoming a household name throughout the U.S. His soap was one of the first nationally advertised products. The soap was sold from brightly painted street cars with musicians, which helped lead the phrase \\"get on the bandwagon.\\" Babbitt was the first manufacturer to offer tours of his factories and one of the first to give away free samples. He used the advertising slogans, \\"Soap for all nations\\" and \\"Cleanliness is the scale of civilization\\". == Embezzlement == In the 1870s, Babbitt and his business were embroiled in a major embezzlement case. Two trusted employees were charged and eventually convicted of having stolen some $200,000 to $300,000 from Babbitt over a period of several years. The case attracted extensive public attention.A GREAT EMBEZZLEMENT.; HOW A MANUFACTURER WAS ROBBED A CONFIDENTIAL CLERK EMBEZZLES $300,000 A LONG SEARCH FOR THE THIEF HIS ARREST YESTERDAY HOW IT WAS MADE., The New York Times, January 5, 1876B.T.

He was survived by his wife, Rebecca McDuffie Babbitt (1820 - 1894) and his two daughters, Ida Babbitt Hyde and Lillia Babbitt Hyde (1856–1939), to whom he left one half of his $5,000,000 estate as well as the controlling interest in his company. Lillia established The Lillia Babbitt Hyde Foundation in 1924, and served as its president until her death in 1939. The bulk of her estate was left to the Foundation, raising the value of its assets as of June 1941, to approximately $3,200,000.

The Isle of Man does not have an island-specific opt-out of the BBC or ITV regional news programmes, in the way that the Channel Islands get their own version of Spotlight and Channel Report; instead, the Isle of Man is included as part of BBC North West and ITV Granada. ==United Kingdom television channels available in the Isle of ManBBC=== Television first reached the Isle of Man from the Holme Moss transmitter in Northern England. This transmitter broadcast the BBC TV service on the VHF 405 line system from 12 October 1951. The signal was strong enough to reach a large part of the Isle of Man, especially the east coast which includes the island's capital, Douglas. In July 1955 the new high- powered Divis transmitter based in Belfast, Northern Ireland came into service, and its signal could easily be received on the west coast of the Isle of Man, bringing the BBC Northern Ireland television service to the island. BBC TV signals from Sandale transmitter in Cumbria could be received in northern parts of the island since that transmitter started broadcasting in 1956, and signals from the BBC TV Llandonna transmitter in North Wales could be received in southern parts of the island since 1958.https://www.thebigtower.com/live/HolmeMoss/Index.htmhttps://www.thebigtower.com/live/Sandale/Index.htmhttps://www.thebigtower.com/live/Divis/index.htm The Isle of Man is covered by BBC North West on BBC One, and receives the local news programme BBC North West Tonight and news bulletins covering the island are included in that programme. The island receives the national England variation of BBC Two. There is no specific island continuity, and the island uses the England-wide continuity for both BBC One and BBC Two. The Isle of Man is part of BBC English Regions. Some viewers receive services from Northern Ireland, Wales and North East & Cumbria rather than from island-based relays. ===ITV=== Until 1965, ITV television could be received on the Isle of Man from at least four mainland transmitters in the United Kingdom. Winter Hill transmitter in Lancashire broadcast the Granada Television region to a large part of the island, especially the east coast and the capital Douglas since 1956, Black Mountain transmitter in Belfast could be received on the island's west coast since October 1959 when the Ulster Television region launched in Northern Ireland. The Caldbeck transmitter based in Cumbria which broadcast Border Television could be received in the northern parts of the island from 1961, and the southern parts of the island received ITV transmissions from the Arfon transmitter which broadcast the ITV Wales service from 1962. It was not until March 1965 that the broadcasting authorities decided to assign a region to the Isle of Man, and thus the creation of relay transmitters on the island itself. ITV Border film crew at Snaefell Railway on the Isle of Man (August 1984) Commercial television came to the island on 26 March 1965, unlike the Channel Islands (which were given their own franchise of Channel Television), the Isle of Man was included in the large ITV Border franchise based in Carlisle. After it was announced that the ITV Border and ITV Tyne Tees would merge, a survey was taken of Isle of Man viewers in autumn 2008, and coverage of the island was transferred from ITV Border to ITV Granada on Thursday 16 July 2009. The island receives the national ITV continuity, and news from the island is featured in Granada Reports. Like the BBC, some viewers receive ITV services through their aerials from elsewhere, including Northern Ireland's UTV and ITV Wales, rather than from local relays. ===Channel 4=== The commercial network Channel 4 broadcasts to the island but Channel 4 does not provide any regionalisation other than advertising. The Isle of Man is covered by Channel 4's North Macro advertising region. ===Channel 5=== The United Kingdom's Channel 5 broadcasts to the island but also utilises a single national channel with regional advertising in which the Isle of Man is covered by The North macro. ===Digital television=== The Isle of Man receives the full digital channel service from North West England region. Viewers on the Isle of Man can access the main Freeview transmitters based on the island which transmit the \\"Freeview Lite\\" service of just over 20 TV channels and just over 20 radio stations. Depending on location on the island, the full Freeview line-up of channels can be received from Winter Hill transmitter in the Granada region, the Divis transmitter based in Belfast transmitting the UTV region, the Caldbeck transmitter in Cumbria transmitting the Border region and the Arfon transmitter based in North Wales transmitting the ITV Wales service. Signal quality and availability of the full channel line-up from these transmitters varies, depending on the signal coverage available from them on the island. ==PlatformsAnalogue terrestrial=== Digital switch-over for the Isle of Man was completed on 16 July 2009. ===Freeview=== The Isle of Man is included as part of the North West region for Freeview. Alongside Freeview, Youview television service is also available to viewers on the Isle of Man, available from the Freeview transmitters with a broadband internet connection. ===Satellite Television=== The paid-for subscription Sky TV service, the free-to-air Freesat from Sky service and the free-to-air Freesat service are fully available on the Isle of Man. ==Television licence== The United Kingdom TV licence also covers the Isle of Man which, as of August 2018, is £150.50 and primarily used to fund BBC services. The Isle of Man funds free TV licences for persons 75 and over. ==Local television== In 1993, Tynwald passed legislation (the Broadcasting Act 1993) allowing for the establishment of local television services. One application for a licence to run such a service was received by the Communications Commission from Manx Television Limited, a company formed for the purpose of the application. This was rejected in 2003 due to failure to supply relevant supporting evidence.APPLICATION FOR TV STATION LICENCE - Communications Press Release (Archived from the original), Isle of Man Government press release, 3 December 2003. Retrieved 24 December 2017 That's Media Group, a community TV provider in the UK announced proposals to establish a dedicated home Isle of Man television service during the 2017 Celtic Media Festival. No details of any intended delivery method were disclosed. ==Online Television== Since May 2012, Manx Telecom TV (MTTV) has operated online by local journalist Paul Moulton providing on-demand news content to a local Isle of Man audience. MTTV has proven to be popular as the Isle of Man does not have a local TV station unlike its counterparts in the Channel Islands. Other presenters on MTTV are Joanne Clague and Mark O'Connor.

The script, written by Aselton and his college friend Adam Nagata, tells of Brian (Dano), a mattress salesman who wishes to adopt a baby from China, but finds himself sharing his passion, with the quirky, wealthy Harriet (Deschanel) when they meet in his store. The story was based on Aselton's childhood wish for his parents to adopt a Chinese baby. The film was shot in New York and Connecticut. It had its world premiere at 2008's Toronto International Film Festival and was released in the United States on April 3, 2009. ==Premise== Young mattress salesman Brian decides to adopt a baby from China. Brian's life becomes more complicated and contemplative when he forms a relationship with quirky, wealthy Harriet, whom he meets at his mattress store. ==Cast== * Paul Dano as Brian Weathersby * Zooey Deschanel as Harriet \\"Happy\\" Lolly * John Goodman as Al Lolly * Edward Asner as Mr. Weathersby * Jane Alexander as Mrs. Weathersby * Leven Rambin as Missy Thaxton * Sharon Wilkins as Linda * Zach Galifianakis as Homeless Guy * Clarke Peters as Roger Stovall ==Production== Aselton said that, as the youngest child in his family, he wanted his parents to adopt a Chinese baby so that he could have a younger sibling; his younger brother did in fact adopt a baby later. He and co-writer Adam Nagata were fascinated by the idea and built the story around Brian's wanting to adopt a baby. Aselton and Nagata, college friends who both come from literary backgrounds, aimed to write the film as novelistic and surrealist rather than expository. They wanted to show \\"those little things that are often found in literature but rarely in film\\", such as Brian and his father's age difference and how it affects their relationship, and Harriet's walking around in her underpants and how it affects her and Brian's relationship. Aselton chose the title Gigantic because \\"There's an innocence about the [word]\\" due to its use by young children to describe something fantastic. He felt that the title was \\"a juxtaposition against Brian's life changing decision to adopt a baby\\". The script languished for several years before the film went into production, when producer Mindy Goldberg brought the script to Christine Vachon of Killer Films. Aselton said the most challenging part of making the film was casting the two lead roles of Brian and Harriet. Paul Dano liked the script and was one of the first actors to sign on, which attracted others to join the cast. Aselton said that Dano was one of the first to audition for the role and the first to understand the story; Deschanel was the second actor to understand, and so both were cast. To prepare for his role, Dano talked to salesmen at Sleepy's, a mattress store, and bought Chinese language tapes to learn some of the language as his character did. Filming began on March 3, 2008 and lasted for 23 days. As a director of commercials, Aselton brought many of his former crew members with him to work on Gigantic. Most of production took place in Brooklyn and Manhattan but several scenes were filmed in Stamford, Connecticut and Los Angeles. Filming locations included Brooklyn Heights' Cadman Plaza West and Cobble Hill's Quercy restaurant. Scenes in the mattress store were filmed inside an abandoned warehouse, which cinematographer Peter Donahue described as \\"a big space with perfect texture on the walls and windows in the right places for motivated, practical light\\". Though the producers wanted to use 16 mm film because of the tight budget, Aselton and Donahue chose to use Super 35 format, mainly using medium-long lenses. ==Release== The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2008. Following its screening at American Film Market, First Independent Pictures bought the film's North American distribution rights. The film was pre-screened at Vassar College in the fall of 2008. It was screened at the Cornell University Cinema on February 14, 2009 and in March at the Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema and the AFI Dallas International Film Festival, where it won the Target Filmmaker Award for Best Narrative Feature. It was given a limited theatrical release on April 3, 2009, coinciding with its showing at the Gen Art Film Festival. ==Reception== Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 36% approval rating based on 83 reviews, with a weighted average of 4.57/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"This overly quirky, incessantly whimsical indie is too self-conscious for its own good\\". Slant Magazine called the film a \\"meager sum of quirky details\\" and gave it (½ out of four stars), though it complimented Dano's \\"fine performance.\\" Stephen Holden called it a \\"serious comedy about the children of privilege...a cautiously surreal, absurdist movie\\" with a protagonist (played by Dano) who's a \\"close spiritual relative of the polite young men who drift through mumblecore films\\"; the review concludes: :With its off-center dialogue and upscale industrial settings, Gigantic strains to be original. But beneath its indie affectations it is really another contemplation of generational misunderstanding. Instead of the passionate '60s and '70s rebels pursuing authenticity in the material world, or '80s and '90s nihilists flamboyantly self-destructing, the movie's meek lovebirds only want something worth their commitment. The Village Voice called it \\"another flimsy indie comedy for the heap\\" with a \\"screenplay's per-page quota of 'unexpected' tweaks [that leave] little room for much else.\\" Gigantic earned $102,704 in gross revenue in its limited thirteen-week, eleven-theater release, with its one-theater opening weekend collecting $10,294 of that total. Worldwide, the film grossed $165,888. ==ReferencesIONCINEMA.com interview with writer/director Matt Aselton Category:2008 films Category:2008 comedy films Category:American comedy films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films shot in Connecticut Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Films produced by Christine Vachon Category:Killer Films films Category:2008 directorial debut films ","title":"Gigantic (film)"},{"id":"19250248","text":"Luis Felipe \\"Puchy\\" Delgado Robles (born February 2, 1954 in Hatillo, Puerto Rico) is a retired professional baseball player who spent seven seasons in professional baseball, including part of a season (1977) in Major League Baseball with the Seattle Mariners. He played 13 games in his one-year major league career, and had four hits in 22 at-bats, with two runs batted in (RBIs). Over his minor league career, Delgado played for the Class-A Winter Haven Red Sox, the Class-A Winston-Salem Red Sox, the Triple-A Rhode Island Red Sox, and the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox in the Boston Red Sox organization; the Triple-A San Jose Missions in the Seattle Mariners organization; the Triple-A Omaha Royals in the Kansas City Royals organization; and the Triple-A Wichita Aeros in the Chicago Cubs organization. In 765 career minor league games, Delgado batted .261 with 729 hits, 89 doubles, 33 triples, and 17 home runs. ==Professional careerBoston Red Sox=== Before the 1973 season, Delgado signed as an amateur free agent with the Boston Red Sox. He was assigned to the Class-A Winter Haven Red Sox at the start of the 1973 season. With Winter Haven, he batted .264 with 73 hits, six doubles, and four triples in 99 games. In 1974, Delgado continued to play for the Winter Haven Red Sox. In 111 games, he batted .264 with 44 runs, 96 hits, one doubles, five triples, and 27 runs batted in (RBIs). Delgado was tied for first on the Red Sox in triples. Delgado continued at the Class-A level in 1975, this time with the Winston-Salem Red Sox of the Carolina League. He batted .257 with 100 hits, 11 doubles, four triples, and one home run in 104 games. Delgado split the 1976 season between the Class-A Winston-Salem Red Sox and the Triple-A Rhode Island Red Sox. With Winston-Salem, he batted .294 with 143 hits, 21 doubles, six triples, and seven home runs in 122 games. He led the Carolina League in hits, and was fifth in batting average. That season, he also played two games with the Rhode Island Red Sox and got one hit (a double) in two at-bats. ===Seattle Mariners=== Despite playing in the Boston Red Sox organization in 1977, he was selected by the Seattle Mariners in the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft. In 1977, Delgado began the season with the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox. He batted .281 with 73 runs, 132 hits, 20 doubles, five triples, seven home runs, 53 RBIs, 18 stolen bases, and 12 caught stealing in 119 games. Delgado led the Red Sox in runs, stolen bases, and caught stealing. After spring training in 1977, Delgado was optioned to the minor leagues. He made his major league debut that season on September 6. In that game against the Kansas City Royals he struck out in his first at-bat. Delgado's first hit, a single, came against the Texas Rangers on September 9. He finished his first and last major league season with four hits, four runs, in 23 at-bats. In 1978, Delgado continued playing in the Seattle Mariners organization. With the Triple-A San Jose Missions, Delgado batted .252 with 83 runs, 136 hits, 19 doubles, seven triples, two home runs, 49 RBIs, and 49 stolen bases in 136 games. He led the Missions in games played, triples, and stolen bases that season. ===Later career=== In Delgado's final season, 1979, he played for two different organizations. On March 20, 1979, Delgado was traded to the Chicago Cubs for Larry Cox. Delgado was assigned to the Triple-A Wichita Aeros in the Cubs organization. With the Aeros, he batted .159 with 13 hits, four doubles, and one triple in 19 games. Delgado then joined the Kansas City Royals organization later that season and was assigned to the Triple-A Omaha Royals. In 17 games with the Omaha club, he batted .224 with 11 hits, and one double. 1979 would prove to be Delgado's final season in professional baseball. ==References== ;General references # # ;Inline citations ==External links== Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:People from Hatillo, Puerto Rico Category:Seattle Mariners players Category:San Jose Missions players Category:Winter Haven Red Sox players Category:Winston-Salem Red Sox players Category:Pawtucket Red Sox players Category:Wichita Aeros players Category:Omaha Royals players Category:Rhode Island Red Sox players Category:Major League Baseball players from Puerto Rico Category:Major League Baseball outfielders ","title":"Puchy Delgado"},{"id":"19250278","text":"Psallentes (\\"those who sing\\") is a Gregorian chant ensemble founded in 2000 and based in Leuven, Belgium. ==Members== Psallentes consists of singers Conor Biggs, Lieven Deroo, Pieter Coene, Paul Schils and Philippe Souvagie and is directed by Hendrik Vanden Abeele. Psallentes has a lifelong association with early music ensembles Capilla Flamenca and Millenarium, with whom they made several recordings.

Psallentes performed several extracts from this Antiphonary at the press conference announcing the acquisition. Psallentes gather evidence on how this music was performed. Hendrik Vanden Abeele's research at the University of Leiden focuses on the thorny and controversial problem of rhythm, memory as the major requisite for a good singer of chant, and the voice as a research tool. Interactions between research and performance result in ‘authentic’ as well as more present-day interpretations of plainsong. ==Discography== *2001 - Arnold de Lantins: Missa Verbum Incarnatum.

Participants report on their thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and/or environment in the moment (right then, not later; right there, not elsewhere) or shortly thereafter. Participants can be given a journal with many identical pages. Each page can have a psychometric scale, open-ended questions, or anything else used to assess their condition in that place and time. ESM studies can also operate fully automatized on portable electronic devices or via the internet. The experience sampling method was developed by Larson and Csikszentmihalyi. ==Overview== There are different ways to signal participants when to take notes in their journal or complete a questionnaire,Hektner, J.M., Schmidt, J.A., Csikszentmihalyi, M. (Eds.). (2006). Experience Sampling Method: Measuring the Quality of Everyday Life. Sage Publications, Inc. like using preprogrammed stopwatches. An observer can have an identically programmed stopwatch, so the observer can record specific events as the participants are recording their feelings or other behaviors. It is best to avoid letting subjects know in advance when they will record their feelings, so they can't anticipate the event, and will just be \\"acting naturally\\" when they stop and take notes on their current condition. Conversely, some statistical techniques require roughly equidistant time intervals, which has the limitation that assessments can be anticipated. Validity in these studies comes from repetition, so you can look for patterns, like participants reporting greater happiness right after meals. These correlations can then be tested by other means for cause and effect, such as vector autoregression, since ESM just shows correlation. Some authors also use the term experience sampling to encompass passive data derived from sources such as smartphones, wearable sensors, the Internet of Things, email and social media that do not require explicit input from participants. These methods can be advantageous as they impose less demand on participants improving compliance and allowing data to be collected for much longer periods, are less likely to change the behaviour being studied and allow data to be sampled at much higher rates and with greater precision. Many research questions can benefit from both active and passive forms of experience sampling. ==Software and related tools== The first mobile device application that could be used as a tool for Experience Sampling Method was the ESP Package (dating to the late 1990s). This had limited functionality in that it is designed for older iOS Palm devices and had limited scheduling capabilities. It no longer works on modern mobile devices. iHabit was the first smartphone mobile application designed for Experience Sampling. It was developed in 2011 and used in a study published by PLOS One in 2013. In 2015, it was superseded by the LifeData system, which was used in a study published by JAMA Pediatrics in 2016. This system has subsequently been used in numerous studies. The PIEL Survey app (first version 2012) is a free app available in iOS and Android versions and has since been used in more than 12 academic publications. It can be used for scheduled, random and on-demand surveys. Unlike many platforms, no server is required as data is saved on the device and emailed to the researcher or else retrieved by file sharing.https://pielsurvey.org/profile/survey-experience-sampling-method/ Other early smartphone platforms for ESM include SurveySignalHofmann, W., & Patel, P. V. (2015). SurveySignal: A convenient solution for experience sampling research using participants’ own smartphones.

The largest ESM study was achieved through PSYT's Mappiness App, PSYT’s apps collect data through ESM as well as reporting the data back to users to enable real-time visualisation and tracking of variables. Several other commercial and open source systems are currently available to help researchers run ESM studies,Conner, T. S. (2013, May). Experience sampling and ecological momentary assessment with mobile phones. Retrieved from http://www.otago.ac.nz/psychology/otago047475.pdf including BeepMe,as available through, e.g., F-Droid catalogue and Expimetrics. Physiqual enables researchers to gather and integrate data from commercially available sensors and service providers to use them in ESM, including Fitbit and Google Fit. As of 2014, Movisens have developed the ability to trigger sampling forms from physiological data such as actigraphy and ECG. unforgettable.me provide a platform for both active and passive experience sampling that allows the integration of some 400 data sources. In 2020, the AthenaCX platform (beta) was launched by an Irish based startup. AthenaCX's platform enables researchers to easily create and distribute experience sampling studies which can also be integrated with wearable devices; giving researchers access to health data along with their study. The powerful software enables researchers to trigger specific questionnaires which are dependent on a participant's gathered health/activity data. The platform has a central focus on the BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) process. The app is readily available from the Google and Apple App Stores so participants can get fully up and running within platform in a matter of minutes. ==See also== * Ambulatory assessment * Diary studies * Event sampling methodology * List of psychological research methods * Quantified self ==References== Category:Psychological methodology Category:Sampling techniques ","title":"Experience sampling method"},{"id":"19250299","text":"Henri Garcin (born 11 April 1929) is a Belgian film actor.

By Louisa Ajami, NOW Staff, September 1, 2008 Randa Chahal Les Infidèles, a 1997 drama, is about the relationship between a French diplomat and a former Islamist who agrees to turn over the names of his colleagues if the French government will release an imprisoned friend. Civilisées (A Civilized People) released in 1999, is a black comedy about the Lebanese Civil War, which killed at least 100,000 people.Lebanese Filmmaker: Randa Chahal Sabbagh by Mai Hoang, World Press Review, March 2004 issue (VOL. 51, No. 3) Lebanese Filmmaker: Randa Chahal Sabbagh Sabbagh deployed a 'vaudevillian cast' including foreign servants and philanthropists, visiting expatriates, militiamen and criminals – in a profane and disunified story mixing elements of absurdist plays. Some 40 minutes of the film was censored for its 'obscenity' and 'uncomplimentary representation of Lebanon during this particularly unsavory spell of its history'. It was subsequently screened only once, at the Beirut International Film Festival. Chahal became noted in 2003 with The Kite, which received the Silver Lion at the 2003 Venice Film Festival and won several prestigious prizes and international acclaim; the Grand Special Jury Prize, the Cinema for Peace Award and the Laterna Magica Prize. Set in a low-key South Lebanese village, the film is about love, life, death and the absurdity of the Israeli occupation, seen from the perspective of a Druze family separated following the division of their village into two with one half annexed to Israel. The story evolves around an arranged marriage between Lamia, a 16-year-old Lebanese Druze girl, (played by Flavia Bechara) and her Israeli Druze cousin (played by Maher Bsaibes). The drama unfolds under the vigilant yet impotent Israeli-Lebanese border guards; one of whom is played by renowned Lebanese composer, actor and playwright Ziad Rahbani. The Kite is used 'as a metaphor for love and for life at the border', it explores, with depth and sometimes humor, 'the meaning of brides, of the hope they represent for divided families and, sometimes, for divided nations'.Film Journal International 2004A critique of 'The Syrian Bride' (Eran Riklis) with a praise to \\"The Kite\\", by Maria Garcia, Film Journal International, Sept. 2008 In 2005, Chahal started a new project with the distinguished Lebanese- American Hollywood film-producer Elie Samaha with the working title Too Bad for Them.

It is the second album of his music (after Out of the Ruins) on which he did not perform or conduct, though he does provide liner notes. String Quartet No. 3 is built out of Out of the Ruins and became a fixture in numerous Nyman film scores in the 1990s. The album was issued by Argo Records with two different covers. Decca Records reissued the album in the UK on July 8, 2002, as part of the British Music Collection, giving it yet a third cover. Nyman's four string quartets are the subject of chapter 7 in Pwyll ap Siôn's The Music of Michael Nyman: Texts, Contexts, and Intertexts.Aldershot, Hants: Ashgate Publishing, 2007 The album is the first of several recordings of the Nyman string quartets. The Lyric Quartet would also record String Quartets 2 and 3, and sections of String Quartet No. 4 on String Quartets 2, 3 & 4/If & Why (2002). The Nyman Quartet (Musker and Hinnigan with violinists Gabrielle Lester and Catherine Thompson), according to the liner notes of Acts of Beauty • Exit no Exit (2006), is set to record all four some time in the future. The album was reissued by MN Records with a new cover and liner notes in November 2012. This edition is subtitled \\"Chamber Music Vol. II\\".https://www.amazon.com/Nyman-Quartets-Nos-1-3-Balanescu- Quartet/dp/B0094BDP5I/ref=sr_1_22?ie=UTF8&qid;=1369241932&sr;=8-22&keywords;=michael+nyman It is not the aforementioned rerecording. ==String Quartet No. 1== The String Quartet No. 1 (1985) was commissioned by the Arditti Quartet. Nyman had attended a performance of Ludwig van Beethoven's Grosse Fuge by the group, and found it the most theatrical performance on a string quartet he had ever witnessed, performed as though Beethoven had been trying to break through the limitations of the string quartet to create an orchestral sound. The quartet was originally intended to be a \\"compendium\\" of string quartet literature, but he decided that two pieces from different eras were enough of a contrast. It is built out of three distinct and diverse pre-existing music sources: John Bull's Walsingham Variations, Arnold Schoenberg's String Quartet No. 2, and Alex North's \\"Unchained Melody\\". The use of Bull is an homage to his professor, Thurston Dart, who presented Nyman with the Musica Britannica edition of Bull's keyboard works as a graduation gift. \\"Walsingham\\" was a popular song in Bull's time, and Nyman's use of \\"Unchained Melody\\" (originally written for a 1955 prison film titled Unchained and famously covered by The Righteous Brothers, and the favorite song of Nyman's wife, Aet) is a contemporary equivalent. As noted by Pwyll Ap Siôn,p. 165 \\"Unchained Melody\\" is musically related to \\"Walsingham\\", as its opening three-note pattern of C-D-E is a slight variation of the melody of \\"Walsingham\\". \\"Unchained Melody\\" enters in figure H (measure 274) over a bass line of variation 9 of \\"Walsingham\\" that previously appeared in figure E. Schoenberg's String Quartet No. 2 is notable in two ways: first, it broke with convention by adding a part for a soprano vocalist, and second, it broke away from the tonal language standard and paved the way for modernist music. Nyman incorporates the Schoenberg material beginning in figure B, and it does not return until figure I. The material Nyman uses is an eight-note (two-measure) phrase for the cello transcribed by Nyman for first violin. Siôn notesp. 166 that Nyman compresses the nearly two-octave phrase into one octave. When it returns in figure I, Nyman has added tremolo, as well as syncopation more characteristic of his own style. ==String Quartet No. 2== String Quartet No. 2 (1988) was commissioned for a dance work called Miniatures, choreographed and performed by Shobana Jeyasingh, who dictated the rhythmic structure of the piece, based on the South Indian Bharata Natyam tradition. Melodically and harmonically, it is Western classical music, while structurally it is Karnatak music. The Balanescu Quartet performed this work with the original dance as well as adding it to their concert repertoire. Miniatures was renamed Configurations when Jeyasingh added two additional dancers to the choreography. Each of the six movements are in different rhythms: the first movement is 4-beat, the second 5-beat, the third 6-beat, the fourth 7-beat, and the fifth, 9-beat (2+3+2+2). The sixth and final movement is in multiple cycles of the preceding beat patterns. ==String Quartet No. 3== String Quartet No. 3 (1990), commissioned by Alexander Balanescu, is based on Romanian folk music, along with material from his choral work Out of the Ruins, via a process Nyman describes as \\"translation.\\" It affected much of Nyman's composition throughout the 1990s—riffs, in particular, a seven-note scalar ostinato, from it appear in À la folie, Carrington (in which it was used as a temp track and ultimately was transformed into a theme for Lytton Strachey), Practical Magic (not used in the finished film), The End of the Affair, and The Claim. The translation is not as simple as it may sound, as Pwyll ap Siôn notes,p.173 the first violin has new melodic material higher than the highest notes of the soprano melody, which is largely for the second violin. In addition, he elides caesuras and makes use of the stringed instruments' ability to sustain far longer than a human voice. Among the passages new to the string quartet are measures 17-24, 125-126, and a cello part beginning at measure 63. Some cause of the variation is that the quartet is a celebration of the fall of Nicolae Ceauşescu, whereas Out of the Ruins is an expression of the hopelessness after an earthquake. Siônpp. 174-175 describes numerous places where the accents and descriptors of the work indicate a very different feeling and approach to the music, with the quartet being much more aggravated, while the choral work reflects sorrow without indignation. Like the first String Quartet, the piece is a reflection of Nyman's postgraduate work with Thurston Dart, who sent him to Romania in 1965 to gather folk music. The Romanian folk melodies that have been added to Out of the Ruins were all gathered on that trip. ==Track listing== String Quartet No. 2 #I #II #III #IV #V #VI String Quartet No. 3 #beginning #fig.

He was educated at hospitals in Maastricht, Brussels and the army medical school in Utrecht. ===Career=== He received his commission as medical officer 3d class in the Royal Netherlands Army in 1828. In 1838 he participated in the 10-day war of Belgian Revolution. While working in Haarlem at the military hospital in 1851, Mathijsen first used plaster of Paris as a bandage.Uncle Plaster and the invention of the Orthopedic plaster cast (in Dutch) Until then a Belgian method was used with starch that took up to a day to dry and harden. Across the street he watched workers repairing cracks in the church with strips of jute dunked in plaster of Paris. He reasoned that a jute bandage soaked in water and plaster of Paris applied in the same way as the Belgian method would harden within a few minutes and thus made a better fixation for broken bones. After testing his idea on chickens he published his findings in a Dutch medical magazine Repertorium in February 1852.Nieuwe wijze van aanwending van het gips-verband bij beenbreuken: eene bijdrage tot de militaire chirurgie, Volume 1, by Anthonius Matijsen, published by J.B. van Loghem Jr., 1852 In 1853 his idea was praised by a research panel for its value to the military, \\"especially on the battlefield\\". Haarlemmers remembered him as \\"Uncle Plaster\\" or \\"Oom Gips\\".

He attended Lowell High School, as well as the University of California, Berkeley, where he graduated in 1912. He served in the U.S. Army Balloon Corps in World War I. The destruction that he witnessed motivated him strongly towards conservation.\\"Newton Drury \\". Pugsley Award website. Retrieved on June 14, 2010. ==Career== In 1919, he and his brother Aubrey formed the Drury Brothers Company, an advertising and public relations agency. That same year, the organizers of the Save the Redwoods League, many of whom knew Drury from the university, asked Drury Brothers to manage the League. Newton Drury became executive secretary in charge of publicity and fund raising, a position he held for twenty years. Drury and the league obtained a six-million dollar bond measure passed to buy California redwood groves. ===National Park Service=== Drury with Eleanor Roosevelt at the dedication of Franklin D. Roosevelt's home at Hyde Park, New York, as a national shrine in 1946 Drury declined appointment as NPS Director in 1933, but accepted the job in 1940. He was the first director without prior national park responsibilities, but came with strong conservationist credentials, having served as executive secretary of the Save the Redwoods League in California. During World War II he successfully resisted most demands for consumptive uses of park resources. Less eager than his predecessors to expand the park system, he opposed NPS involvement with areas he judged not to meet national park standards. Differences with Secretary of the Interior Oscar L. Chapman over Chapman's support for dams in Dinosaur National Monument contributed to Drury's resignation in 1951. After his resignation from the park service Drury accepted the position as head of the California Division of Beaches and Parks. He was instrumental in changing some of the operational policies of the state park system to that similar to the national park system. In particular he dropped the recreational emphasis in summer programming to that of interpretation with a natural history emphasis. ==Death== Drury died in December 1978. He received a Pugsley Medal twice, a silver medal in 1940 and a gold medal in 1950. He was board chairman of the Save the Redwoods League at his death.\\"National Park Service History: Directors of National Park Service\\". NPS. Retrieved on June 14, 2010. ===Legacy=== The Newton B. Drury Scenic Parkway is the long four lane highway through Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park in Humboldt County, California, which was completed in 1993, honoring his efforts in the creation of Redwood National and State Parks. As a result of CalTrans move of US Route 101 outside the eastern edge of the park, Old Growth Redwoods within the park will not ever be removed to widen the road. This road, though shorter, is similar in quality to the Avenue of the Giants in Southern Humboldt County. Drury Peak in the Mount San Jacinto State Park, Riverside County, California, is named after him as well. ==References== Category:Directors of the National Park Service Category:1889 births Category:1978 deaths ","title":"Newton B.

He surpassed Roger Åkerström's combined record on September 22, 2011, when he and his Linköpings HC team played a game against Skellefteå AIK at Cloetta Center which ended 4–0 in Skellefteå's favour. It was his 912th game. At the time of his retirement after the end of the 2011–12 season, he had played 950 SHL games, 808 of which were regular-season ones. His regular season record was beaten on September 14, 2013, when David Petrasek played his 809th regular season game. After playing another four games in the 2013–14 season, Petrasek also beat Håkanson's combined record when he had played his 951st SHL game overall. ==Career statisticsRegular season and playoffs=== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

Although a reliable and dynamic player with a heavy, but clean tackle, Morgan suffered at the hands of the selectors often dropped for players who never showed any international longevity.Thomas (1979), pg 142. Morgan first played with Abertillery at the age of 18 at centre, but when called up for National Service he switched to wing-forward while playing for the army. While garrisoned at MOD Bicester, he asked if he could run out for Bicester Rugby Union Football Club and, with tough selection in those days, was selected to play for the 2nd XV. He wore skipper Ken Haddock's shirt and went on to score two tries. He continued to play for Bicester and played for both club and country (Wales) on successive Saturdays in 1958. Within two years of first wearing a Bicester jersey, he was also called up for duty with the British Lions in 1959 and then again in 1962https://bicesterrufc.rfu.club/club-history.

Estreito partnered up with the Flemish Fernão Dulmo (Ferdinand Van Olm), and asked King João II of Portugal to approve their 40-day voyage to the fabled island Antillia, which the Portuguese called the Seven Cities. The King agreed to fund the exploration, under certain circumstances: Dulmo shall command the fleet to Antillia for the first forty days, and Estreito shall take over afterwards and be responsible for everything discovered until their return home. The Dulmo-Estreito voyage sparked an intense interest in later Portuguese westward voyages. Christopher Columbus had also proposed a similar journey to João II, yet his bargain was inferior to that of Dulmo. The king's rejection of Columbus left him to go to Spain for his American journey. Dulmo and Estreito, using a map drawn by the German Martin Behaim, set sail from the island of Terceira, Azores in March 1487. Unfortunately, Dulmo and Estreito, like several other pre-Columbian explorers, were unaware that sailing directly west would result in battling heavy winds, and eventually died at sea.http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1955/1/1955_1_72_print.shtml ==References== ;Notes ;Sources * Category:Portuguese explorers Category:15th- century explorers Category:People from Funchal Category:15th-century Portuguese people Category:Maritime history of Portugal ","title":"João Afonso do Estreito"},{"id":"19250826","text":"Valley High School is a high school in Valley Station, Kentucky.

He became a draftsman with the U.S. Geological Survey, where he testified effectively at Congressional and budget hearings and his writings stimulated park interest. Demaray moved to the National Park Service (NPS) when its headquarters was first staffed in 1917. He served as associate director from 1933, and his brief tenure as Director (from April to December 1951), before his planned retirement, was a reward for his long and distinguished service. In the second spot during the tumultuous New Deal and the difficult wartime years (when he remained in Washington while the headquarters office relocated to Chicago), he proved an extremely effective administrator. Perhaps his greatest accomplishment was to maintain good working relations with Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes during the irascible secretary's 13-year regime (1933–1946).

It is about 65 parsecs away from the Sun that is larger than, but of a similar mass to, the Sun. However, HD 154672 is much older. The star is very metal-rich, which is one of the reasons why it was targeted for a planet search by the N2K Consortium, which discovered the gas giant planet HD 154672 b using Doppler Spectroscopy; the discovery was reported in October 2008. The N2K collaboration chose HD 154672 primarily because it aimed to discover the correlation between a star's metallicity and the mass of orbiting planets. HD 154672 was targeted by the Magellan Telescopes. It is the host of the first planet discovered from the telescopes by N2K. ==Observational history== HD 154672 was first targeted for a planet search in 2004 by the N2K Consortium, a collaboration of astronomers hoping to take radial velocity measurements of previously untargeted stars using Doppler spectroscopy; however, HD 154672 had been previously targeted by a series of surveys, and was previously included in the Henry Draper catalog and the catalog of the European Space Agency's Hipparcos satellite. The Magellan Telescopes, which were used to observe HD 154672. N2K deliberately biased its search towards closely orbiting Jupiter-size planets (Hot Jupiters) in the orbit of metal-rich stars, as the consortium hoped to discover how the mass of a planet relates to its host star's metal content. Initially, HD 154672 was noted as a host to a short-orbit Hot Jupiter, although additional observations revealed that the prospective planetary body had a longer orbit than previously expected, as revealed by the Magellan Telescopes at Chile's Las Campanas Observatory. Use of the Magellan Clay telescope's Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph (MIKE) helped collect sixteen radial velocity measurements for HD 154672; a team of American astronomers and one from the Vatican City used these measurements to confirm the existence of planet HD 154672 b and to determine its mass. The discovery of HD 154672's planet was reported in the Astronomical Journal on October 7, 2008 along with a planet in the orbit of HD 205739. ==Host star== HD 154672 is a sunlike G-type star that has a mass of 1.06 times that of the Sun and a radius that is 1.27 times that of the Sun. Thus, it is slightly larger than the Sun, although it has a similar mass. The star has an effective temperature of 5714 K, slightly cooler than the Sun; however, it is far richer in iron, with a measured metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.26. This means that the star has 1.82 times more iron than the Sun does. HD 154672 is far older than the Sun, as its estimated gyrochronological age is estimated at 9.28 billion years. HD 154672's spectrum suggests that the star's chromosphere (its outer layer) is not active. HD 154672 is located 65.8 parsecs (214.6 light years) away from Earth. It has an apparent magnitude (V) of 8.22, making the star too dim to see from Earth with the naked eye. The star is slightly dimmer than planet Neptune as perceived with the naked eye, which has an apparent magnitude of 7.78 at its brightest. The star's actual brightness is measured with an absolute magnitude of 4.12, similar to that of the Sun. ==Planetary system== HD 154672 b is a Hot Jupiter, as it is a closely orbiting planet with a high mass. Specifically, HD 154672 has a mass that is 5.02 times greater than Jupiter's mass. It also orbits at a distance of 0.6 AU, or about 60% of the mean distance between the Earth and Sun. This orbit is completed every 163.91 days. HD 154672 b has an orbital eccentricity of 0.61, denoting a very elliptical orbit. The planet's discoverers noted that if water existed in the planet's atmosphere, it might change from a liquid state to a gaseous state as the planet swings closer to its host star, increasing its temperature. ==See also== * HD 205739 * HD 74156 * 54 Piscium * HD 80606 * HD 37605 * HD 17156 * HD 89744 ==References== * Category:Durchmusterung objects 154672 083983 Category:Planetary systems with one confirmed planet Category:G-type subgiants Category:Ara (constellation) ","title":"HD 154672"},{"id":"19251108","text":"Lamprostola is a genus of moths in the subfamily Arctiinae described by Schaus in 1899. ==Species== * Lamprostola aglaope Felder, 1875 * Lamprostola endochrysis Dognin, 1909 * Lamprostola nitens Hampson, 1900 * Lamprostola olivacea Schaus, 1896 * Lamprostola molybdipera Schaus, 1899 * Lamprostola pascuala Schaus, 1896 * Lamprostola thermeola Dognin, 1912 * Lamprostola unifasciella Strand, 1922 ==References * Category:Lithosiini Category:Moth genera ","title":"Lamprostola"},{"id":"19251114","text":"Bertram Alexander Heffernan (born March 3, 1965 in Centereach, New York) is an American former professional baseball player.

She was credited as the author of Hardy's posthumously published biography, The Life of Thomas Hardy, although it was written (mostly or entirely) by Thomas Hardy himself in his old age. ==Biography== Dugdale was born in Edmonton, London,Births England and Wales 18371983. the daughter of headmaster Edward Dugdale. Florence attended the National Infants School in Enfield for two years until 1886 when she went to St Andrew's Girls School. At the age of 20, her parents paid ninepence per week for her to study at the Higher Grades School. From 1895 onward, Florence's life was centred on her teaching. She began training at St Andrew's Girls School, where she and her sister Ethel received prizes from the Diocesan Board of Education for \\"Religious Knowledge and a proficiency in secular subjects\\". In 1897, she became a fully qualified teacher at St Andrew's (her father's school). She was companion to Lady Stoker, wife of Sir Thornley Stoker, brother of Bram, author of Dracula. Florence first met Thomas Hardy in 1905 when she was age 26. She became his passionate friend and helper, and stopped teaching in 1908 - both to assist Hardy and to begin her writing career. In 1912, she published her first book, The Book of Baby Birds, with Hardy's contribution. In the same year, Hardy's wife Emma died, and she moved into Max Gate, Dorchester, Dorset, in 1913. In 1914, they married at St Andrew's Church, Enfield, despite their age difference of 39 years. During the marriage, Florence found herself increasingly in the shadow of Emma (whom Thomas had neglected while she was alive). Thomas's frantic and subdued love poetry - obviously written with Emma in mind - was a cause of embarrassment and misery for Florence. Nevertheless, in 1928, when Hardy finally died aged 87, she was so stricken with grief that a doctor was required. The Hardys befriended T. E. Lawrence, and Florence attended his funeral. Florence Hardy died at Max Gate, the home she had shared with Thomas, of cancer, aged 58. She was cremated in Woking Crematorium, and her ashes were buried in Stinsford churchyard, where Hardy's heart and his first wife were interred. == Publications == * Illustrated by Edward Julius Detmold. * Illustrated by W.

The church is Grade I listed by the Department for Culture, Media & Sport as a building of outstanding architectural or historic interest. ==History== Egmanton appears in a Domesday Book entry for 1085 as among the possessions of Roger de Busli, but there is no mention of a church or priest.\\"Our Lady of Egmanton\\", Southwell & Nottingham church History Project In the early eighteenth century it became the custom in Egmanton for couples who had been married in the church to give a cake to the church bell ringers, who in turn would inscribe their names in the belfry. The list was removed as part of the restoration work done at the end of the 19th century. A nineteenth century tradition records that it was customary to store a large ham at the church, kept ready for one of the local families, who were accustomed to bury their dead \\"in ham\\", i.e., the ham was eaten at a feast after the funeral. The parish war memorial was unveiled and dedicated on Saturday 20 March 1920.\\"Egmanton - St Mary's Church\\", Nottinghamshire county Council ==Architecture== Parts of the church date back to Anglo-Saxon times. The stone building has a chancel, clerestoried nave, a north aisle of four bays, a south transept and a west tower. The windows in the south transept are late fourteenth century. The west tower was built in the 15th century.\\"History\\", The Society of Our Lady of Egmanton Romanesque features are a plain south doorway, the north arcade and the font.\\"St Mary, Egmanton, Nottinghamshire\\", The Corpus of Romanesque Sculpture in Britain and Ireland The three bells in the tower are by the foundry of John Taylor & Co.\\"Our Lady of Egmanton\\", Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers ==The shrine== The shrine of Our Lady of Egmanton is within the parish church. The origin of the shrine is a reported apparition of the Virgin Mary to a local woman in nearby Ladywood, sometime prior to the 12th century. Until its destruction in 1547, the Shrine was an object of devout pilgrimage. There are pilgrim crosses scratched by medieval pilgrims to mark the completion of a vow, by the south door and in the north isle.\\"Church of Our Lady of Egmanton\\", Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire Medieval Graffiti Survey Pilgrims from the north would traditionally use Egmanton as a stopping-off point as they travelled to Walsingham on pilgrimage. Modern pilgrimages to it were restarted in 1929. In 1930 Father Alfred Hope Patten, restorer of the shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham, led a pilgrimage. The Society of Our Lady of Egmanton organizes several pilgrimages every year. ==Restoration== The present image of Our Lady crowned and with the Holy Child, was the work of Sir Ninian Comper, and was erected as part of a major restoration in 1896 carried out under the patronage of Henry Pelham-Clinton, 7th Duke of Newcastle. The restoration by Comper in 1896 to 1898 preserved the building but also introduced several fine features which create the distinctive interior. These include the organ case modelled on the one in the cathedral at Freiburg im Breisgau, the pulpit modelled on that in Ghent. The stained glass windows are also by Comper. The Rood Screen was restored in 2005 by Michelle Pepper and was partly funded by a grant from the Nottinghamshire Historic Churches Trust.\\"Our Lady of Egmanton church\\", Nottinghamshire Historic Churches Trust ==Organ== Comper placed the organ above the south door entrance.

Among founders, there were such well-known people such as Edmund and Władysław Zyzak; Ludwik, Franciszek and Władysław Pantofliński; Leonard Rybarski; Otto Szmidt; Wiktor Dubowski and other local youths, passionate about football. Their first opponents were small clubs founded in those years, from Kraków, Lwów, and other towns. In 1930 the club was promoted to local A-Class, which roughly is the equivalent of contemporary Second Division. They remained there for four years. After World War II, Koszarawa suffered a steady decline. It was not until 2001 that the team gained promotion back to the Fourth Division. They stayed there for a few years until they were promoted, this time to the Third Division. In their first season they started brightly, but after the sale of top scorers Krzysztof Zaremba to local giants Podbeskidzie Bielsko-Biała and Krzysztof Bizacki to GKS Tychy they failed to regain the same form they had had before, and finished in 11th place. In 1949 the club was renamed Związkowiec after a merger with local side Soła Żywiec, but it was short lived as in 1950 Związkowiec was liquidated as the merger was undone, and the club returned to the name TS Koszarawa.

The basic types of prestressing are: *Precompression with mostly the structure's own weight *Pre-tensioning with high-strength embedded tendons *Post-tensioning with high-strength bonded or unbonded tendons Today, the concept of a prestressed structure is widely employed in the design of buildings, underground structures, TV towers, power stations, floating storage and offshore facilities, nuclear reactor vessels, and numerous bridge systems.

It is the site of dozens of small fires which burn constantly from vents in the rocks on the side of the mountain. Directly below the fires are the ruins of the temple of Hephaistos, the Greek god who was associated with fire through his role as the blacksmith to the gods. To see the fires and the ruins, visitors must first go to the entrance at the foot of the mountain. The site is at the top of an easy one kilometre climb. Most people visit at night, when the fires are at their most spectacular. In ancient times sailors could navigate by the flames, but today they are more often used to brew tea. ==Ancient references== It has been suggested that the fires are the inspiration for the fire-breathing Chimera in Homer's Illiad. The site was identified as the ancient Mount Chimaera by Sir Francis Beaufort in 1811, and described by T. A. B. Spratt in his Travels in Lycia, Milyas, and the Cibyratis, in company with the late Rev. E. T. Daniell. The discussion on the connection between the myth and the exact location of Chimera was started by Forbiger in 1844. The English archaeologist George E. Bean was of the opinion that the name was \\"allochthonous\\", meaning that it had originated somewhere else. He believed that the original location was further west, as cited by Strabo, at a location where similar fires burned. The fires of Yanartaş at night. ==Location== The location is 80 km southwest of Antalya, near the town of Çıralı. The area is located on a track popular with hikers and trekkers on the Lycian Way. ==Fires== The fires are grouped over an area of 5000 m2 and are fueled by gas emissions which have been burning for at least 2500 years. These emissions seem to change seasonally: vents and flames are more vigorous in winter months. This is a common characteristic of such seeps, where gas flux is typically modulated by gas pressure build-up induced by groundwater recharge and changes in atmospheric pressure. ==Gas composition== The vents emit mainly methane (87%). The rest is made of hydrogen (7.5-11%), nitrogen (2-4.9 %), light alkanes (0.57%), carbon dioxide (0.01-0.07 %) and helium (80 ppmv). These proportions and the isotopic composition indicates a mix from 2 origins, in equal part: * an organic thermogenic gas, related to type III kerogen occurring in Palaeozoic and Mesozoic organic-rich sedimentary rocks, * an abiogenic gas produced by low- temperature serpentinization in the Tekirova ophiolitic unit. ==Source of gas== Abiotic methane ordinarily only forms at temperatures much higher than those that occur in the rocks at Yanartaş. However, ruthenium is present in the igneous rocks under the flames, and is believed to act as a catalyst, permitting the formation of methane at the lower temperatures (i.e., below 100 °C) that occur at Yanartaş. These vents represent the biggest emission of abiogenic methane discovered on land so far. The emissions do not have a volcanic origin, since methane is not related to mantle or magma degassing. ==See also== *Çıralı *Lycia *Kemer ==ReferencesBooks== * * ==External links== *Smith's Classical Dictionary *Pictures of Yanar taş *Pictures of Chimaira Category:Antalya Category:Persistent natural fires Category:Geology of Turkey Category:Kemer District ","title":"Yanartaş"},{"id":"19251597","text":"Ardagh was a station which served Ardagh in County Limerick, Ireland. ==History== The station was opened by the Waterford and Limerick and Rathkeale and Newcastle Junction railways, then absorbed into the Great Southern and Western Railway.

Tramping is defined as a recreational activity involving walking over rough country. Trampers often carry a backpack and wet-weather gear, and may also carry equipment for cooking and sleeping. ==History== Alpine climbing has been a recreational activity from the early days of European settlement, and possibly earlier. From the 1950s tracks, huts and bridges were built in the forested areas of New Zealand to support hunters culling introduced deer species which had become a threat to the biodiversity of New Zealand. As tramping became popular these facilities were increasingly used by trampers. In later years tramping has become popular for both local and foreign tourists. Tramping clubs were formed in many towns, cities and universities with regular trips being organised. The clubs sometimes own a bus to transport club members to the tracks. ==Tramping tracks== A network of tramping tracks has been developed throughout New Zealand of varying lengths and difficulties. A small number of tramping tracks cross private land either in part or in full. All of the major tramping tracks are on public land that is administered by the Department of Conservation. Among the best-known tracks are the ten Great Walks and the ultra-long-distance Te Araroa. ==Huts== Mt Brown Hut, Lake Kaniere Scenic Reserve, West Coast, New Zealand There is a network of more than 950 backcountry huts throughout New Zealand operated by the Department of Conservation (DOC) on public land. Some areas have privately owned huts on public land used for commercial tourism operations. The majority of the huts were built by the now defunct New Zealand Forest Service for deer culling operations. Other huts were built by alpine clubs, schools, and ski clubs. Some of the buildings on public land that are readily accessible by vehicle, are generally \\"baches\\" or \\"cribs\\" built by private individuals when control of the use of public land was less stringent. These baches are not made available to the public. Some public huts are associated with a local club and volunteers from clubs will perform much of the maintenance on these huts. In the Tararua Forest Park north of Wellington huts are managed in a partnership between DOC and various lower North Island clubs. In the eastern Southern Alps near Christchurch some huts are managed solely by the Canterbury Mountaineering Club and they rely on fees from these huts to help pay the cost of maintenance. Amongst experienced trampers there is a strong culture of looking after huts. The phrase \\"hut etiquette\\" encompasses looking after any hut that is used and showing consideration for other hut users. Most huts on the conservation estate are open to the public and the state of a hut depends on the care by those who use it. ==Environmental care code== This environmental care code promoted by the Department of Conservation contains a 10-point checklist of things that can be done in the outdoors to help minimise impact:Environmental care code - Department of Conservation { class=\\" float-left\\"  1  Protect plants and animals  Treat New Zealand's forests and birds with care and respect. They are unique and often rare. -  2  Remove rubbish  Litter is unattractive, harmful to wildlife and can increase vermin and disease. Plan your visits to reduce rubbish, and carry out what you carry in. -  3  Bury toilet waste  In areas without toilet facilities, bury your toilet waste in a shallow hole well away from waterways, tracks, campsites and huts. -  4  Keep streams and lakes clean  When cleaning and washing, take the water and wash well away from the water source. Because soaps and detergents are harmful to water-life, drain used water into the soil to allow it to be filtered. If you suspect the water may be contaminated, either boil it for at least 3 minutes, or filter it, or chemically treat it. -  5  Take care with fires  Portable fuel stoves are less harmful to the environment and are more efficient than fires. If you do use a fire, keep it small, use only dead wood and make sure it is out by dousing it with water and checking the ashes before leaving. -  6  Camp carefully  When camping, leave no trace of your visit. -  7  Keep to the track  By keeping to the track, where one exists, you lessen the chance of damaging fragile plants. -  8  Consider others  People visit the back country and rural areas for many reasons. Be considerate of other visitors who also have a right to enjoy the natural environment. -  9  Respect our cultural heritage  Many places in New Zealand have a spiritual and historical significance. Treat these places with consideration and respect. -  10  Enjoy your visit  Enjoy your outdoor experience.

While there, he acted in plays and sang in operas and other musical productions. In the mid-1790s he started composing incidental music for company's plays and writing singspiele. His first score for the company was the ballet Le nozze disturbate, which premiered in 1795 to great success. The company performed the work 39 times that year alone. Beethoven based his 12 variations on a Menuett à la Vìganò WoO 68 (1795) on an air from the ballet. In 1796, his opera Der Tiroler Wastel premiered at the theater to rave reviews. The work was Haibel's greatest success and was given 66 times that year and 118 times in all at the Freihaus-Theater. The work was staged in a multitude of other theatres throughout the Austro-German part of Europe and no other original score by Haibel ever equalled its success. Haibel continued to compose music for the theater until the death of his first wife Katharina (ca. 1768 – Vienna, 14 February 1806). At the time, he was not to be found in Vienna, for in 1804 he had already left for Diakowar (Đakovo), Slavonia,Lorenz, Michael (2008) Neue Forschungsergegnisse zum Theater auf der Wieden und Emanuel Schikaneder (\\"New research results concerning the Theater auf der Wieden and Emanuel Schikaneder\\"), p. 13.

Recent research has brought to light 16 Masses by Haibel written during this time, preserved in the Kuhač collection at the Nacionalna i Sveučilišna Knjižnica in Zagreb. Haibel became Mozart's posthumous brother-in- law when he married Sophie Weber, Constanze's sister, on 7 January 1807.

It can occur in males or females, but literature is abundantly favored toward researching mating calls in males. In addition, mating calls are often the subject of mate choice, in which the preferences of one gender for a certain type of mating call can drive sexual selection in a species. This can result in sympatric speciation of some animals, where two species diverge from each other while living in the same environment. There are many different mechanisms to produce mating calls, which can be broadly categorized into vocalizations and mechanical calls. Vocalizations are considered as sounds produced by the larynx and are often seen in species of birds, mammals, amphibians, and insects. Mechanical calls refer to any other type of sound that the animal produces using unique body parts and/or tools for communication with potential mates. Examples include crickets that vibrate their wings, birds that flap their feathers, and frogs that use an air sac instead of lungs. == Vocalizations  Birds === Song sparrow Mating call of Japanese bush warbler, Horornis diphoneThe use of vocalizations is widespread in avian species and are often used to attract mates. Different aspects and features of bird song such as structure, amplitude and frequency have evolved as a result of sexual selection. Large song repertoires are preferred by females of many avian species. One hypothesis for this is that song repertoire is positively correlated with the size of the brain's song control nucleus (HVC). A large HVC would indicate developmental success. In song sparrows, males with large repertoires had larger HVCs, better body condition and lower heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratios indicating better immune health. This supports the idea that song sparrows with large song repertoires have better lifetime fitness and that song repertoires are honest indicators of the male's \\"quality\\". Possible explanations for this adaptation include direct benefits to the female, such as superior parental care or territory defense, and indirect benefits, such as good genes for their offspring. Japanese bush warbler songs from island populations have an acoustically simple structure when compared to mainland populations. Song complexity is correlated with higher levels of sexual selection in mainland populations, showing that a more complex song structure is advantageous in an environment with high levels of sexual selection. Another example is in purple-crowned fairywrens; larger males of this species sing advertising songs at a lower frequency than smaller rival males. Since body size is a characteristic of good health, lower frequency calls are a form of honest signaling. Negative correlation between body size and call frequency is supported across multiple species within the taxa. In the rock sparrow, song frequency is positively associated with reproductive success. Slower song rate is associated with age and is preferred by females. Reproductive status of the individual is communicated through higher maximum frequency. There was also positive correlation between age and extra-pair copulation frequency.rut Bird calls are also known to continue after pair formation in several socially monogamous bird species. In one experimental population of zebra finches, there was increased singing activity by the male after breeding. This increase is positively correlated with the partner's reproductive investment. The female finches were bred in cages with two subsequent males that differed with varying amounts of song output. Females produced larger eggs with more orange yolks when paired with a male with a high song output. This suggests that the relative amount of song production in paired zebra finch males might function to stimulate the partner rather than to attract extra-pair females. === Mammals === During the breeding season, mammals will call out to the opposite sex. Male koalas that are bigger will let out a different sound than smaller koalas. The bigger males which are routinely sought out for are called sires. Females choose sires because of indirect benefits that their offspring could inherit, like larger bodies. Non-sires and females do not vary in their body mass and can reject a male by screaming or hitting him. Male-male competition is rarely exhibited in koalas. Acoustic signaling is a type of call that can be used from a significant distance encoding an organism's location, condition and identity. Sac-winged bats display acoustic signaling, which is often interpreted as songs. When females hear these songs, named a 'whistle', they call onto the males to breed with a screech of their own. This action is termed 'calling of the sexes'. Red deer and spotted hyenas along with other mammals also perform acoustic signaling.Logan, C. J. & Clutton-Brock, T. H. Validating methods for estimating endocranial volume in individual red deer (Cervus elaphus). Behavioural processes 2013; 92, 143–6 Tungara frog === Amphibians === Most frogs use an air sac located under their mouth to produce mating calls. Air from the lungs channels to the air sac to inflate it, and the air sac resonates to produce a mating call. The larynx is larger and more developed in males, which causes their call to be louder and stronger In the túngara frog, males use a whining call followed by up to seven clucks. Males who have a whine-cluck call are more successful in attracting females than males whose call is a whine alone. The ability to produce clucks is due to a specialized fibrous mass attached to the frog's vocal folds, creating an unusual vocalization similar to the two-voiced songs found in some birds. In the common toad, sexual competition is driven in large part by fighting—successful males often physically displaced other males from the backs of a female in order to gain access to mating with that female. Larger males were more successful in such takeovers, and had higher reproductive success as a result. However, the vocalizations of these toads provide a reliable signal of body size and thus fighting ability, allowing contests for possession of females to be settled without risk of injury. === Insects === While mating calls in insects are usually associated with mechanical mating calls, such as in crickets, several species of insects use vocalizations to attract mates. In the Asian corn borer, males emit clicking sounds that mimic the echolocation of bats which prey on the moths. They then take advantage of the female's \\"freezing\\" response to mate with the female. In the Japanese lichen moth, however, the female is able to distinguish between the sounds made by males and those made by bats and other predators. As a result, the males use ultrasonic clicking as a more conventional mating signal, compared to the \\"deceptive\\" courtship song used in the Asian Corn Bearer. ==Mechanical calls== Mating calls also take form through mechanical processes. Animals that are unable to vocalize their call may use their body to attract mates. === Crickets === Mating call of field cricket, Gryllus pennsylvanicus In the field cricket, Gryllus integer, males rub their wings together to create a rapid trill that produces sound. Males individually vary in the durations of their trilling or, what is more sophisticatedly called, bout length. The bout length of each male is heritable and passed on to his future offspring. Also, females prefer to mate with males that have longer bout lengths. The end result is that males with longer bout lengths produce more offspring than males with shorter bout lengths. Other factors that influence the formation of these bout lengths include temperature and predation. In field crickets, males prefer warmer sites for mating as shown by an increase in the frequency of their mating calls when they were living in warmer climates. Predation also affects the mating calls of field crickets. When in a potentially dangerous environment, males cease calling for longer periods of time when interrupted by a predator cue. This suggests that there is an interplay between intensity of mating call and risk of predation. === Sonation === As described in Sonation, \\"the term sonate is described as the deliberate production of sounds, not from the throat, but rather from structures such as the bill, wings, tail, feet and body feathers, or by the use of tools\\". In several amphibian and fish species, other special structures are used to produce different sounds to attract mates. Birds are common users of sonation, although several amphibian and fish species have been shown to use sonation as a form of mating call as well. In general, sonation is one factor that plays into how a female may choose a mate. There are other features of mating such as territory defense or mate defense, which contribute to the cause of finding suitable mates. As outlined below, each species uses a distinct method to produce a non-vocal mating call in order to be most successful in attracting mates. The examples below represent the most common examples found in the literature, although many more examples may exist in nature that are still currently unknown. Feather of male Pavo cristatus (Indian peafowl). These feathers are used in sonation to create infrasound with intent of mating.  Birds  The feathers, the beak, the feet, and different tools are all used by different bird species to produce mating calls to attract mates. For example, the snipe uses its feathers to produce a \\"drumming\\" sound to attract mates during a special mating dance. Snipes used specialized tail feathers to create a sound described as a \\"rattle\\" or \\"throbbing\\" noise.Bahr, P. H. \\"On the \\"bleating\\" or \\"drumming\\" of the snipe (Gallinago coelestis).\\" Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London. Vol. 77. No. 1. Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 1907 Palm cockatoos use sticks to drum on hollow trees, creating a loud noise to attract the attention of mates. Bustards are large, highly terrestrial birds that stamp their feet during mating displays to attract mates. Mirafra apiata, commonly known as the Clapper lark, engages in a complex display flight that is characterized by the rattling of the wings. Many species of birds, such as manakins and hummingbirds, use sonation for mating calls. However, peacocks exhibit a feature of sonation that reveals intrasexual and intersexual properties of this type of mating call. Males move their feathers to produce a low-frequency sonation (infrasound) and sonate more frequently in response to a sonation by other males. This is attributable to a male's desire to advertise its presence above other males looking for mates, suggesting that sonation carries an intrasexual function. In addition, females show increased alertness when hearing the infrasound signals produced by males' wing-shaking, which highlights how the two sexes use sonation to interact with each other.  Fish  While most bird species use their feathers, tools, or feet to produce sounds and attract mates, many fish species use specialized internal organs to sonate. In Gadoid fish, special muscles attached to the swimbladder assist in the production of knocking or grunting sounds to attract mates.  Lepidoptera  In many lepidoptera species including the adzuki bean borer (Ostrinia scapulalis), ultrasonic mating calls are used to attract females and keep them motionless during copulation. These pulses have an average frequency of 40 kHz. == Speciation due to mating call differences == Differences in mating calls can lead to the separation of different populations within a species. These differences can be due to several factors, including body size, temperature, and other ecological factors. These can arise in the form of tonal, temporal, or behavioral variations in mating calls that subsequently lead to the separation of populations. The separation of these populations due to differences in mating call and mating call preferences can lead to the evolution and creation of new, unique species. This type of speciation is most often sympatric speciation: where two or more species are created from an existing parent species that all live in the same geographic location. Although there is an absence of research on mammals and birds, this phenomenon has been heavily researched in several frog species around the world. The examples below illuminate speciation due to mating call differences in several frog species around the world. These distinct species are included because they are the focus of the majority of current research. Two Microhyla olivacea in a mating position === Microhyla olivacea and Microhyla carolinensis === These two species of narrow-mouthed frog live in the southern United States and have overlapping ranges in Texas and Oklahoma. Researchers have discovered that these two different species alter the frequencies of their call in the overlap zone of their ranges. For example, the Microhyla olivacea mating call has a significantly lower midpoint frequency in the overlap zone than the mating call outside this zone. This leads researchers to suggest that the differences in mating call in the overlap zone of M. olivacea and M. carolinensis act as an isolating mechanism between the two species. They also hypothesize that the evolution of these differences in mating call led to the separation of these two different frog species from one common species. thumb Engystomops petersi === Engystomops petersi === Female preferences for specific male mating calls can lead to sexual selection in mating calls. Females may prefer a specific type of call that certain males possess, in which only those males will be able to mate with females and pass on their genes and specific mating call. As a result, this female preference may lead to divergence of two species. In Amazonian frogs, sexual selection for different calls has led to the behavioral isolation and speciation of the túngara frog (Engystomops petersi). From genetic and mating call analysis and, researchers were able to identify that two populations of the túngara frog were almost completely reproductively isolated. From their research, scientists believe that differences in female preferences for mating call type have led to the evolution of this speciation process. Specifically, the Yasuní population females prefer the male mating call that includes a whine, while the other population does not prefer this whine. Subsequently, the Yasuní males include the whine in their call, while the other males do not. For this reason, the differences in call have led to the mechanical separation of this species. === Pseudacris triseriata === A Chorus Frog making a mating call Several studies have shown that the species Pseudacris triseriata (Chorus Frog) can be divided into two subspecies, P. t. maculata and P. t. triseriata, due to speciation events from mating call differences. The Chorus Frog has a very large home range, from New Mexico to Southern Canada. These two subspecies have an overlapping range from South Dakota to Oklahoma. In this overlapping range, both the call duration and the calls per second for each species is much different than outside of this range. This means that calls of these two subspecies are more similar outside of this range, and starkly different within the range. For this reason, scientists suggest that these subspecies evolved from differences in mating call type. Additionally, these subspecies are rarely recorded to have hybrid offspring, which further suggests that there is complete speciation due to mating call differences. The differences in mating calls also help to reinforce the speciation process. ==References== Category:Mating Category:Animal developmental biology Category:Reproduction in animals Category:Sexology Category:Sexuality ","title":"Mating call"},{"id":"19251684","text":"Chambers at the 2011 Time 100 gala Raymond G.

The village has around 30 permanent residents. The tower was built in 1689, with an upper conical iron section added in 1870. Open fires, serving as beacons, have been lit at the site since early times. Landsort is the southernmost point of the Stockholm archipelago. ==Lighthouse== The first lighthouse in the modern sense was lit in 1651 and, until the current tower was raised, a couple of different buildings were used to support the light. The tower of 1689 was constructed to carry an open fire, which burned coal. In 1840, a colza oil lamp was installed. A flame consumed paraffin from 1887 but in 1938 the beacon was electrified. Today the Swedish Maritime Administration owns and runs the lighthouse. During World War II and the Cold War, Landsort was a military base for the Swedish Coastal Artillery. ==Climate== The Swedish weather service SMHI operates a meteorological station at Landsort. The southern end of the island has a typical oceanic climate with several maritime features. One of those is the delayed summer (May and June are very cool compared to nearby mainland areas), called seasonal lag. There is a very low diurnal temperature variation, which often results in very mild nights year-round compared with nearby cities and towns. Winters are more prone to cold than summers are to heat, owing to the possibility of coastal ice eliminating maritime moderation in winter months when inland temperatures are colder. During months in which ice is not a risk, all-time lows are much milder than during adjacent months. These cold snaps are rare. The area has a distinct microclimate, with relatively low precipitation for the reference period of 1961-1990. In spite of it being an extreme maritime climate by Swedish standards, it still is quite continental compared to similar latitudes in Scotland. In summer, Landsort is isolated from heat waves affecting the east coast, with temperatures rarely going above . Between 2002 and 2016 there were only 14 such occurrences, at a 0.9 days average. The chilly temperatures are especially marked by May temperatures often staying 10 degrees lower or more than during coastal or inland warm periods. Summers are rather short, with June being relatively chilly and rapid cooling starting from September onwards. In spite of the cool summer days, Landsort has never reported September frost, a very unusual occurrence for Swedish weather stations. Overnight lows can be extremely mild. During a late summer 2002 heat wave, Landsort did not fall below the entire August. On the other extreme, during a 2006 heat wave affecting the entire southern mainland, Landsort never rose above in spite of frequent hot days in its vicinity. The drastic cooling in winter months has resulted in an all-time cold record of , typical of inland locations, but the all-time record heat measured at just is comparatively low, especially since nearby Stockholm recorded that very day in 1975. ==See also== * List of lighthouses and lightvessels in Sweden ==ReferencesSjofartsverket * The Swedish Lighthouse Society Category:Islands of Nynäshamn Municipality Category:Islands of the Stockholm archipelago Category:Lighthouses in Sweden Category:Villages in Sweden Category:1651 establishments in Sweden ","title":"Landsort"},{"id":"19251753","text":"The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics competed for the only time at the Summer Paralympic Games in 1988.

The holotype of P. perrierensis is a partial left coracoid in the Collection Université Montpellier, accession number PRR 2585. The four paratypes are the distal part of a left humerus (PRR2591), the proximal part of a left ulna (PRR 2571), the distal part of a left ulna (PRR 2578), and the distal part of a right tarsometatarsus (PRR 2576). The type specimen of P. artophoron is a fossil slab and counterslab containing most of the postcranial skeleton and some feather impressions. This specimen is in the collection of the Forschunginstitut Senckenberg, accession number SMF-ME 1144 A and B. The feathers of P. artophoron show some unique characteristics. The feathers on the trunk are about wide and long. They appear to be membranous and ribbon-like, without barbs. This may be an artifact of preservation, but eight nearby primaries show barbs quite clearly. Peters noted that ribbon-like, elongated plumes are known from some living birds, but all are used in display. He writes that display feathers are unexpected in a nocturnal owl, and wonders if this lineage of owls was, in fact, diurnal.Peters, Dieter Stefan (1992) \\"A new species of owl (Aves:Strigiformes) from the Middle Eocene Messel oil shale\\" pp. 161-169 in \\"Papers in Avian paleontology honoring pierce Brodkorp\\" edited by Kenneth Campbell, Jr. NO. 36 Science Series Natural history Museum of Los Angeles County.

There are a few exceptions, such as college or university students from other provinces who are covered by their home province plans, international college and university students who generally purchase private plans from their student unions, and certain foreign workers, who either purchase private insurance plans or go uninsured. > The Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec was established in 1969 for the > purpose of setting up the public health insurance plan.

Unlike most other provincial health plans, the Quebec health plan covers prescription medicines for many people. The annual cost varies depending upon each person's situation. People who are eligible for private prescription coverage are required to enroll in the private plan and are not eligible for the RAMQ prescription plan. The only medical services that are not covered by the Régie are those considered not medically necessary, such as services requested on the basis of cosmetic reasons. A majority of physicians in Quebec participate in the plan, implying that they are remunerated directly by the board for the services they provide. The Régie issues a health insurance card to persons eligible for the Quebec Health Insurance Plan. Because the card gives access to insured healthcare services, it is important for insured persons to carry their card with them at all times. There are 7.4 million holders of this card issued by RAMQ. The card was first implemented by Quebec's Health Minister Claude Castonguay in 1970, considered one of the key persons in the establishment of public medical insurance and healthcare in Canada. ==Information appearing on a health insurance card== # The bar code, found on the cards issued as of 11 January 2010. # The health insurance number (HIN), unique to each person, consisting of: #* the first three letters of the last name; #* the first letter of the first name; #* the last two digits of the year of birth; #* the month of birth (to which 50 is added to indicate female); #* the day of birth; #* a two digit administrative code used by the Régie. # The person's identity: #* first name (if the number of characters in the first name exceeds the space available, only the initial will appear on the card); #* last name at birth; #* husband's last name, if requested by a woman married before 2 April 1981 or by a woman married outside Quebec who exercises her civil rights under that name; #* the number of cards issued to the person since 1984. # The person's birthdate and sex. # The year and month of expiry. # The person's photograph and signature, both of which are digitized and incorporated into the card.

His best remembered work is perhaps the 1855 opera Raymond and Agnes, though his most successful opera during his lifetime was The Night Dancers. Portrait of Edward James Loder as it appeared on the first page of the London Illustrated News, 27 November 1858 ==Biography== Loder was born in Bath, Somerset. He was the son of John David Loder (1788–1846), a violinist and musical director of the Theatre Royal, Bath, and his wife Rosamund, née Mills (1787–1856), a step- daughter of the comedian John Fawcett. Edward Loder's twin brother John Fawcett Loder (1809–1853) was a violinist, and a younger brother William Sowerby Loder (1812–1851) was a cellist who married the soprano Emily Woodyatt. His cousins included the composer and conductor George Loder (1816–1868) and George's sister, composer and pianist Kate Loder. Loder's family sent him to Frankfurt in 1826 to study under Ferdinand Ries, who was an old friend of the family. He returned to England in 1828 and embarked on a successful career as an opera conductor in London as the music director of Princess's Theatre, and, from 1851 in Manchester, leading the Theatre Royal. His first composing success was Nourjahad in 1834. His compositions include operas, cantatas, ballad operas, string quartets, and many songs. Today he is most remembered for his opera Raymond and Agnes (1855), which was revived in Cambridge in 1966. His most successful opera during his lifetime was The Night Dancers, sometimes referred to as The Wilis, or The Night Dancers, or Giselle, or The Night Dancers, first produced in 1846 and revived at Covent Garden in 1860. On 10 November 1831, Loder married Elizabeth Mary Watson (c.1813–1880) at Bristol. It appears they were separated within a few years, as in 1861 he stated that his wife was Louisa Alice Foster, born c. 1838. He appears to have fathered a son (Edward Loder Garside 1850-1940) with the actress Clara Garside Neville (1827–1869) during his marriage to Louisa. Tributes at the time of his death state that he was a bachelor.

With an elevation of above sea level, the mountain is located east-north-east of Launceston. The mountain habitat is a mixture of temperate old growth rainforest, subalpine and alpine landscapes. ==Location and features== TV transmission towers on Mount Barrow Tarns on the alpine plateau at Mount Barrow Mount Barrow is a Jurassic dolerite-capped plateau with widespread block fields and a sharp summit ridge at the north- eastern end. It is the closest alpine mountain to Launceston - the plateau extends to and reaches a maximum altitude of above sea level, making it the second highest peak in eastern Tasmania. The road to the summit is periodically closed in winter due to snow; near the summit this becomes a narrow gravel road leading to a parking area, with an old stone hut nearby. The snow line is located at around . The mountain is in lands once occupied by Tasmanian Aborigines and lies at the border of country occupied by the Ben Lomond Nation, to the south; the Letteremairener Clan, in the Tamar Valley and the Pyemmairrenerpairrener clan, to the north-east. === Nomenclature === It is probable that the indigenous name for the mountain was pialermeliggener, transcribed by G.A. Robinson when he was searching the upper Pipers River area. pialermeliggener is sometimes used to describe nearby Mt Arthur, but examination of Robinson's travels and the translation of the aboriginal word (with the suffix meaning cliffs or scree near summit) accord with the exposed cliffs on most faces of Mt Barrow. The feature is shown as Row Tor on some maps of the area in the early 1800s although, confusingly, this is most often used as the early toponym for nearby Mt Arthur. The modern name is believed to have been for Sir John Barrow, a British Admiralty official. It is probable that Lieutenant-Governor Franklin named the mountain in Sir John Barrow's honour; as the two were likely acquainted and the mountain first appears as such on maps during Franklin's Governorship. Confusing the issue further, Mt Barrow is named 'Ben Loder' in John Glover's 1836 painting and the mountain is further mentioned in newspaper print several times as 'Mount Barron' - and may have been known colloquially as such in the 19th Century.  Cartography of the Mount Barrow region  Versions of Flinders' 1798 map, adapted in 1825, clearly show the Mt Barrow region depicted as Row Tor; however, maps of 1843 onwards clearly shows Mount Barrow marked in its present location and adds 'Row Tor' as the foothills slightly west towards Launceston. Later maps of the north-east show Row Tor as occupying the present day location of Mt Arthur, it's possible that originally Row Tor was the colloquial name for the broader north-east highlands region and the separate massifs of present-day Mount Arthur and Mount Barrow were delineated cartographically in the 1840s. Geology of Mount Barrow Mount Barrow is mostly dolomite from the Jurassic period, which has been predicted to have come to the surface around the late Cretaceous, with more recent granite developed in the Ice age. When the Ice age ended, rain would have washed away the stagnant dirt and uncovered the variety of rocks that can now be seen at the summit. === History of the Mount Barrow area === The mountain formed an imposing barrier to settlers for long into the 19th Century and the steep and rainforested country behind the mountain was visited infrequently. In the 1830s the country was explored by George Robinson and the botanist Robert William Lawrence, who both commented on the steep and difficult country. The hinterland was subject to scientific exploration by Paul Strzelecki in 1846 and prospectors gradually opened up the rugged country in the north-east after that time. By the late 1870s settlement had made inroads into the surrounding valleys and the forests began to be exploited for their wood, as well as clearing country for emerging settlements such as Nunamara, Patersonia and Diddleum Plains. A state reserve on Mount Barrow occupies and is an important habitat for several threatened species. These include the Tasmanian Wedge-tailed Eagle, the spotted-tail quoll and Eastern quoll and the Mount Arthur Burrowing Crayfish. Marsupials regularly sighted on the mountain include wombats, pademelons, Bennett's wallabies and Forester kangaroos. The reserve also features a pleasant picnic ground with a nature trail beginning and ending there. Numerous mountain streams are found across the escarpment and these can turn into substantial waterfalls after heavy snowfall. Mount Barrow is the main television and FM radio transmission site for north east Tasmania. The broadcasting and telecommunication structures are subject to ice build up and have shields incorporated into their designs to prevent damage from falling ice. Due to the rugged terrain the programme reaches the sites via microwave links instead of the usual fibre optic cables. Electrical power reaches the facilities by an overhead line running up the eastern side of the mountain. ==See also== * List of mountains in Tasmania ==References External links == * Mount Barrow State Reserve Barrow Barrow, Mount ","title":"Mount Barrow"},{"id":"19252141","text":"William Bradbery (11 July 1776 – 11 August 1860), an entrepreneur, was the first person in England to cultivate and sell watercress on a commercial basis. ==Early life== William was born in Didcot in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), he was one of seven children to Thomas and Catherine Bradbery. In 1796 he married Phoebe Whiting in Marcham, Berkshire. Until around 1805 he stayed in the Marcham area, then they moved to Springhead, Northfleet in Kent, where he first started to cultivate watercress. ==Watercress cultivation== William's grandson Richard Bradbery at the watercress farm West Hyde In an article by Henry Bellenden Ker, FRS in 1822, to the London Horticultural Society. He states, \\"I lately found that watercress is grown in this neighbourhood, by Mr. William Bradbery, for the purpose of supplying the London markets. Mr. Bradbery first began to cultivate the watercress in February 1808, at Northfleet Spring Head, near Gravesend. For this purpose, he procured young plants, and placed them, with a small proportion of the wet earth in which they grew, in shallow running water; the plants soon formed large tufts, and rapidly spread over the water; and he then gathered the cress regularly for the London markets\\". \\"Mr. Bradbery now having left Northfleet last year (1820),began to plant, at a considerable personal expense, beds of the cress, at West Hyde, near Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire. Mr. Bradbery has about five acres of lakes planted with cress. He sends the cress in hampers, each containing eight dozen bunches, to the London markets, every day throughout the year, except Sundays; three days in each week to Covent Garden market, and the other three days to Newgate market. This cultivation of the watercress has insured a constant and regular supply to the metropolis, and the gatherings are received much fresher, and more regularly packed, than those obtained from plants in the wild state; where little selection is made as to the quality, or attention paid to the state of the vegetable, which is usually sent up to town in sacks, and often much bruised and broken before it reaches the retail dealer\\". West Hyde proved to be an ideal place to grow the cress, as water bubbled to the surface in a line of springs. The water containing suitable minerals which assisted the growth of the cress. By the mid-19th century, William Bradbery was sending cress to many cities throughout the country, being, Manchester, Liverpool, York, London, Oxford even up to Edinburgh. In the 1841 census return, William described himself as a \\"Market Gardener\\", employing 22 workers from West Hyde and surrounding area. He even sent cress to the Great Exhibition of 1851, at The Crystal Palace. ==Retirement== William Bradbery's headstone in St Thomas's churchyard Now residing in some style, he and his wife lived at Corner Hall, in West Hyde, the family home for over 75 years. Having created a substantial business for himself and his family, William retired in his sixties, and let his son Job take over the running of the business, who in turn passed it onto his son, Richard. William died on 11 August 1860, a little over a month before his wife Phoebe, who died on 19 September 1860. They are buried together in the churchyard of St Thomas, in West Hyde. The watercress business continued on in the ownership of the Bradberys for some years after William died.

His mother Yanick Jean was a writer, and his father was a poet, writer, and art director named Syto Cavé. Cavé often accompanied his famous father on his tours of the Caribbean (Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Lucia), France, the United States and Canada. Surrounded by people who loved the arts, and born to writers, it was natural for Cavé to follow in their footsteps. During his adolescence, Alan frequently played guitar, belting out soulful and heartfelt words and melodies that, to many audiences, seemed beyond his age. Cavé's performance debut happened when an actor in a play fell ill and he was asked to sing the song \\"La Personne\\". The enthusiastic audience reception crystallized for Cavé the desire to have a musical career, and Alan Cavé became a household name in Haiti. In 1987, he met with Alex Abellard and Eddy Saint-Vil to audition, and Cavé was quickly signed for the group Zin. The group released their first album, \\"O Pa\\", in 1989. More than two decades later, Zin's guitarist-songwriter Eddy St. Vil, keyboardist and leader Alex Abellard, and its 11 band members remain popular, with sweet ballads and traditional Haitian kompa grooves. Cavé's voice, sometimes characterized as \\"seductive,\\" considerably aided the success of the band. ==Career== Cavé has become a prolific songwriter, with a catalogue of songs and unreleased recordings in English, French, and Haitian Creole. When once asked what inspires him, he answered simply: “Life and people”. He said he would prefer to be remembered as writer and composer, as it takes not just talent, but passion, aspiration, discipline and hard work to write songs and release an album. He is a sought-after performer in the French-Caribbean community. Cavé has collaborated with some known kompa artists and bands of the French Caribbean such as Malavoi, Mario DeVolcy, Tanya Saint-Val, Haddy N'jie and Roy Shirley. In 2001 he launched his first solo album, Se Pa Pou Dat, which was an enormous success. This album seems to transcend barriers of language and cultural sound, with its melodies popular in Japan, Africa and South America, even though listeners may not understand the words.

He is professor of Structural Economy at the Faculty of Economic Sciences of the University of Santiago de Compostela. He is a former memberq of the National Council of the Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG in the Galician acronym), he is currently the leader of Renewal–Nationalist Brotherhood, an independentist political party. He formerly had representation in the Galician parliament. ==Academic life== Beiras graduated with a law degree in 1957 from the University of Santiago de Compostela. That same year, he moved to Paris to study economics at the University of the Sorbonne, where he also studied French Language and Literature. In 1960, he taught his first course on Political Economy at the Complutense University of Madrid and a year later, in 1961, he moved to London to attend the London School of Economics, where he continued to advance his studies. During the 1966/1967 academic year, Beiras received a scholarship from the Juan March Foundation, which allowed him to attend a research course with François Perrou at the Institut de Sciencie Economique Apliquée (Paris). During his time in France, he became acquainted with Robèrt Lafont's concept of \\"internal colonialism\\", a concept that would remain embedded in his political discourse for years to come. He was the vice-director of the Revista de Economia da Galiza (\\"Galician Journal of Economics\\") from 1963 to 1968. In 1967, he was granted a prize from Casa Galiza in New York City for his book O problema do desenrolo na Galiza rural (The Problem of Development in Rural Galicia). In 1968 he moved back to Galicia for good, taking up a job as a lecturer in economy at the University of Santiago de Compostela. In 1970, while spending a few months in Madrid, he published his doctoral dissertation under the title Estructura y problemas de la poblacion gallega (\\"Structure and Problems of the Galician Population\\"). His dissertation earned him an Extraordinary Doctoral Prize, as well as a position as associate professor in Structural Economy. In 1972 he published one of this key works: O atraso económico da Galiza (\\"The Economic Underdevelopment of Galicia\\"), and he was offered the post of temporary Dean, a position he eventually accepted in 1975. While still publishing books, he directed a research project on the modernization of Galian agriculture sponsored by the Pedro Barrié de la Maza foundation and the University of Montpellier. In 1977 he was invited to join the Real Academia Galega (The Royal Galician Academy) – the institution he would leave in 1982 as he disagreed with the linguistic policies endorsed by the Academy (and following the example of Carvalho Calero). In 1980 he became head professor of Structural Economy at the University of Santiago de Compostela, where Beiras still remains today. The 1980s were prolific in publications not just related to economics or politics, but also literary. He would even publish translations from French classics into Galician. ==Life in politics== As a politician he was one of the founding members of the clandestine Galician Socialist Party, in 1963, in Francoist Spain. In 1964 he took on the role of International Relations, a position which would grant him access to a number of European Socialist organizations. He would eventually become Secretary General of the party in 1971. Yet, he resigned in 1977 due to the unfavorable results in the first democratic elections of Spain after the death of Franco. In 1982 Beiras tookpart in the foundation of the BNG (Galician Nationalist Bloc) as member of the National Directive Board. In 1985 he gained a seat at the Galician Parliament and gradually became the indisputable leader of Galician nationalism. Beiras took the party to its best results ever in 1997, receiving the support of almost 25 per cent of the electorate. In 2004 he established a number of pacts with nationalist parties from Catalonia and Basque Country in order to gain greater media coverage and, most importantly, joint political weight in the Spanish Parliament. That same year, 2004, he decided to renounce to the candidacy for the Galician presidency for the next elections and gradually leaves active politics. However, being unhappy with the internal dynamics of BNG shortly after he yielded leadership, he fostered a critical organization within it - the Encontro Irmandinho - in order to promote party transparency and internal democracy. After abandoning the first line of BNG, Beiras has been actively involved in anti-globalization movements such as Altermundo and the World Social Forum (WSF) . In 2008 he was invited to join the Council of the WSF . Beiras is also the co-founder and president of the politically oriented foundation Galiza Sempre, since 1999. ==Beiras as an author== He has published a large number of books and articles in politics and economics, but as an intellectual Beiras has also shown an interest in literature and music (he is an accomplished pianist). He contributed to the creation of publishing houses such as Editorial Galaxia and Edicións Laiovento. At present he is a regular columnist of newspaper Galicia Hoxe. Occasionally he publishes in the newspaper A Nosa Terra and in the prestigious Galician cultural journal Grial. ===Selected works=== * Antígona (translation into Galician of Jean Anouilh's Antigone, with Xosé Luís Franco Grande), 1959 * O problema do desenrolo na Galiza rural, 1967 * Introducción á economía galega de hoxe (Beiras et al.), 1969 * Estructura y problemas de la población gallega, 1970 * O atraso económico de Galiza, 1972 * A Galiza rural na encrucillada, 1975 * Contaminación industrial e desenvolvimento, 1975 * O atraso e Nós.

Drivers for the roll-out of real-time policy functionality include: * The ability to differentiate offerings in crowded/competitive markets; * The need/desire to boost revenues; and * The need to reduce churn by increased customer loyalty and service usage. Examples of real-time policy include: * User preference policies – Includes parental or corporate controls, content filters, calendaring restrictions, authorized-user lists and spending controls, among others. * Targeted promotion/advertisement policies – Policies that guide how and what types of ads are delivered, including number of ads to be sent, content of ads and delivery methods; * Content management policies – Policies based on rules around how content is delivered. For instance, content management can be used to protect minors from adult material, restrict business users from unrelated or inappropriate downloads, or simply classify which “persona” or account pays for what content-types; * Handoff and network access policies for seamless mobility – Users have control over whether or not their devices will switch amongst various network types, such as WiFi, cellular or microcell, to take advantage of various quality boosts or costs savings; and * Usage limits/bandwidth policies – CSPs can adjust upload/download speeds, bandwidth consumption based on a subscribers' plan. == Market Adoption == kajeet utilized real time policy to become one of the first service providers to launch a mobile service aimed at preteens,kajeet Cell Phones Created By Dads for Kids, Go featuring an array of parental control features.

Access to a Yammer network is determined by a user's Internet domain so that only individuals with approved email addresses may join their respective networks. The service began as an internal communication system for the genealogy website Geni.com, and was launched as an independent product in 2008. Microsoft later acquired Yammer in 2012 for US$1.2 billion. Currently Yammer is included in all enterprise plans of Office 365 and Microsoft 365. ==HistoryPre-acquisition=== In 2008 Yammer was built as an internal feature for Geni by David O. Sacks. After 6 months of use at Geni, Sacks brought Yammer to TechCrunch50 to showcase its abilities and launch the product as an independent service away from Geni. Yammer won top prize at TechCrunch50, which allowed them to seed more money into the project. It was determined early on that a corporate email address would be required to use Yammer. In 2009 Yammer went through its first redesign. The main feature set included profiles, profile photos for groups, following suggestions, and a product called 'YammerFox', which was an extension for Firefox that popped up an alert to the end user when a message was received. In 2010 new integrations were launched in the application, such as polls, chat, events, links, topics, Q&A;, and ideas. Yammer also launched their own app store which included Crocodoc and Zendesk. By now, Yammer had grown to over 1 million total users on the platform. Yammer also released their SharePoint 2007 Integration, and moved to Scala for their real-time work. In 2011 Yammer made the move from Scala back to Java for their real-time work due to the complexity of rolling out Scala. Yammer Notifications was released as a replacement to YammerFox. During this period, Yammer grew its userbase to 4 million total users. In 2012, Yammer purchased OneDrum. This acquisition allowed Yammer to implement real-time document editing, as well as document edit history. Yammer was also purchased by Microsoft for US$1.2 billion.Microsoft announced that the Yammer team would be incorporated into the Microsoft Office division, but would continue to report to Sacks. ===Post-acquisition=== In 2013 Microsoft integrated Yammer into Dynamics CRM and pushed the Yammer subscription into their Office 365 enterprise plans. In 2014 Microsoft announced that Yammer development was being moved into the Office 365 development team, and Sacks announced that he was leaving Microsoft and Yammer. Yammer also allowed login through Office 365, as well as plans to have Yammer show up in the Office 365 header for selection by end users. In 2015 Yammer removed several features related to how it worked with SharePoint, including support for SharePoint Server 2013. There was renewed focus on the Yammer Embed Feed. In 2016 Yammer removed the Yammer Enterprise Plan, due to a shift in using the more general Office 365 subscription structure. They also announced that Yammer would integrate with Office 365 Groups as well as allow end users the ability to create and edit Word, PowerPoint, and Excel documents using Office Online. In 2019 Yammer announced 'The New Yammer', which focused on a redesign based on Microsoft's Fluent Design System. In November, they announced full integration into Microsoft Teams, Microsoft's competitor product to Slack. ==See also== *List of social networking websites ==References== Category:2008 software Category:2008 establishments in California Category:Companies based in San Francisco Category:Companies based in Redmond, Washington Category:American social networking websites Category:Blog hosting services Category:Internet properties established in 2008 Category:Microsoft acquisitions Category:Microsoft subsidiaries Category:Microsoft Office Category:Microsoft websites Category:Collaborative software Category:2012 mergers and acquisitions ","title":"Yammer"},{"id":"19252450","text":"Church of Marbehan Marbehan is a small Belgian village located in Wallonia in the province of Luxembourg.

The East Sitting Hall is located on the second floor of the White House, home of the President of the United States. First used as a reception room for guests of the president (the Lincoln Bedroom and the Queens' Bedroom were originally offices of the chief executive), it is now a family parlor with access to the east rooms on the second floor. The room is entered from the second floor corridor on the west side of the room. A large fanlight window on the east side of the room faces the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, the East Colonnade, the East Wing, and the U.S. Treasury. Two disguised doors allow access to a closet and a staircase up to the third floor. Charles Dickens wrote this about the room during the administration of John Tyler: > [W]e went upstairs into another chamber, where were certain visitors, > waiting for audiences. At sight of my conductor, a black in plain clothes > and yellow slippers who was gliding noiselessly about and whispering > messages in the ears of the more impatient, made a sign of recognition, and > glided off to announce him.

But there were no such means of beguiling > the time in this apartment, which was as unpromising and tiresome as any > waiting-room.... Because the East Sitting Hall is situated above the East Room (which has a 22-foot ceiling), access to the East Sitting Hall was originally by way a small set of stairs from the Stair Landing. During the Truman reconstruction, the room was reduced by the addition of a lavatory and side stair to the third floor; the steps were replaced with a ramp through an arched corridor. Sister Parish, the first interior designer brought in to decorate during the Kennedy restoration, created the original concepts of the redesigned East Sitting Hall, which became a repository of furniture and memorabilia associated with the life of President James Monroe. ==See also== * West Sitting Hall == References == *Abbott James A., and Elaine M.

Sea caves, and other sorts of erosional and crevice caves, may be formed in volcanic rocks, but through non-volcanic processes and usually long after the volcanic rock was emplaced. ==Types== There are many types of lava caves, with these being the most notable: *Lava tubes are the most common and extensive type of lava cave. Lava tubes usually form in pahoehoe lava flows, though exceptions exist. As the lava is emitted from the vent area, it spreads in the path of least resistance. The outer layers of the lava harden, while the interior forms horizontal conduits that channel the advance of the flow. These conduits are the beginning stages of lava tubes that serve to insulate the heat from the lava which then provides a way for the lava flow to advance longer distances. Dependent upon the slope, terrain, and lava viscosity, different kinds of lava tubes can form. Multilateral tubes are those that form paralleling, often branching and anastomosing tubes. Multilevel tubes are those that sit directly on top or underneath another tube, sometimes above or below several tubes. Some lava flows hold a mixture of multilevel and multilateral tubes. One other form a lava tube is the tube-in-tube which can form inside lava tubes if the linings of the walls are weak enough to lean inward, forming a new floor above the old. Tube-in-tubes are generally noted to form during the last lava draining through the main lava tube. :*Ice caves Some lava tubes are referred to as ice caves because they contain ice within. Small surface tubes *Surface tubes are small drained rivulets, or runners of the same highly fluid lava that flows in lava channels. They form on an existing hardened surface, and most are too small to enter. They are created by flowing lava that turns itself inside out. Sometimes referred to as \\"toes,\\" they are thought to be instrumental in the growth (lengthwise) of lava tubes. They usually form when vents, channels, or reservoirs of lava overflow. They are very shallow and typically reside within the first few feet under the surface. Some surface tubes can connect to lava tubes deeper below the surface. Surface tubes typically have a uniform wall thickness and semi- circular cross section, flat side down against the surface where they formed. Branching is common and broadly dendritic networks are not unusual. Widths range from about four inches (a decimeter) to several yards (meters). Length depends primarily on an uninterrupted supply of lava and ranges widely. Surface tubes are far more numerous than is generally realized because most are subsequently buried. *Inflationary caves tend to be small chambers that form when lava is pressurized and pushes exterior rock. The lava may then later drain leaving an inflationary cave. In some cases, volcanic gases may exert pressure on solid or semi-solid lava and form what is basically a bubble of thin rock called a blister. These blisters are at times big enough to qualify as a cave. Inflated caves can be mistaken for lava tubes because they often share many of the same characteristics. An example of inflationary caves can be found in pressure ridges. Pressure ridges are fractured lobes of hardened lava and may occasionally be hollow. :*Liftup caves are related to pressure ridges and the inflationary process. Liftup caves can form on the edges of pressure ridges or pressure plateaus where the convex edge of a ridge or plateau begins to expand outward it commonly leaves a void below. Liftup caves are usually no more than though longer ones have been discovered up to long. *Open vertical conduits, or OVCs, are vertical passages through which lava rose to the surface then receded. They have a round or oval-shaped passage. Depths range from a few feet to at least 165 feet, and diameters range from less than a foot to 25 feet. Their interior consists of remelted lining, usually adorned with short stalactites. OVCs usually, though not necessarily, form at the top of a vent structure like a spatter cone, spatter ridge, or hornito. Hornitos are open vertical conduits that form atop lava tubes. One of the deepest and most spectacular OVCs known is Thrihnukagigur in Iceland. It drops 120 meters from the surface to the upper floor of the magma chamber. *Pit craters form when magma that doesn’t quite reach the surface drains to form a void, and the ground above it slumps. These huge open-air pits, with their sheer walls, are analogous to some of the large shafts that formed by solution, and typically require a roped descent for exploration. While most have no extension beyond the visible floor, others may have entrances into adjacent (now empty) magma chambers, such as was seen when the crater of Mauna Ulu in Hawai\`i Volcanoes National Park was explored by a team of Swiss cavers. In Na One, a pit crater on Hualālai Volcano in Hawaii, a narrow opening at the bottom of an -deep pit crater leads into an open vertical volcanic conduit, with a total depth of . A lava mold of a tree trunk *Rift or fissure caves, form along volcanic rift zones and eruptive fissures, or in fractures associated with volcanic activity. These are tectonic in formation, caused by stress in lava during and after solidification. They may also be the site of fissure eruptions, and the walls covered with spatter. Notable rift caves include Crystal Ice Cave, formed in Idaho’s Great Rift (and now part of Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve). Caves in the Great Rift are known up to deep. *Lava mold caves, sometimes erroneously called \\"lava casts\\", form when lava flows around trees (lava tree molds) or even large dead animals. The engulfed material eventually burns or decays away, but ends up leaving a hollow space with the original shape. Usually these are not very large but can get somewhat complex where groups of fallen logs were touching, and may then form caves that go in several directions where the resulting voids intersect. Such caves are known from Washington (US), near Ape Cave, and most notably from Japan in the Yoshida-tanai area. Elephant mold caves are known from the Nyiragongo volcano in Africa, and one in the shape of a Tertiary-age rhinoceros is known from Blue Lake, Washington.Chappell, W.M.; Durham, J.W. & Savage, D.E.

After four months, he dropped out after an instructor said, \\"Young man, the drawing of Caesar is good, but that caricature you made of me on the border is terrible\\".Danger Trail ==Career== Westover was 18 years old when he landed a job as a sports cartoonist with the San Francisco Bulletin. He also contributed to the San Francisco Chronicle, the San Francisco Post and the Oakland Herald. His first comic strip, Daffy Dan, about a baseball player, was published in the Post.Wheeler, Christopher. \\"Russ Westover\\".

Westover worked on his concept of a flapper character in a strip he titled Rose of the Office. With a title change to Tillie the Toiler, it sold to King Features Syndicate. Leaving the Herald, he began Tillie the Toiler for King Features in 1921, and the working-girl strip quickly established a wide readership, leading to a 1927 film adaptation by Hearst's Cosmopolitan Pictures with Marion Davies as Tillie. During the late 1920s, more than 600 papers were carrying Tillie The Toiler. In 1926, he added another strip, The Van Swaggers, to his Sunday page as a topper. Cupples & Leon published a series of at least eight Tillie the Toiler reprint collections beginning in the 1920s and continuing into the 1930s. Westover profited from another movie when Kay Harris appeared in the title role of Columbia Pictures' Tillie the Toiler in 1941.

In 1773 he went to Vienna to study with Georg Christoph Wagenseil. Beginning in 1777 he was composing religious works for Saint Stephen's Cathedral. In the 1780s he became a prolific composer of incidental music for plays and singspiele. His best-known singspiel is Der Dorfbarbier, which premiered in 1796. His other compositions include numerous cantatas, ten symphonies, several concertos (including a well-known one for harp), and five string quartets. Mozart was a good friend of Schenk and Beethoven studied under him in 1793. In around 1823, he composed a variation on a waltz by Anton Diabelli (D 718), being one of the 51 composers who contributed to Vaterländischer Künstlerverein.

It is open daily except Tuesday; an admission fee is charged. The garden can be traced back to 1875 when the De Monléon family constructed the property. In 1905 Lord Percy Radcliffe, former governor of Malta, with his spouse Rahmeh acquired the property, adding adjacent farmland to form a garden. In 1957 Miss May Sherwood Campbell acquired the property and a second garden, now accessed by a bridge, and created a pond with water hyacinths, water lilies, and papyrus. In 1966 she donated her property to the nation, which transferred it to the Ministry of National Education. It then became a research center for Mediterranean flora managed by the National Museum of Natural History. The garden opened to the public in 1967. Today the garden contains some 1,500 taxa growing within a microclimate of high humidity where temperatures rarely fall below 5°C (41°F) in winter. It features Sophora toromiro (a species of small trees since disappeared from Easter Island), as well as exceptional olive trees (more than 400 years old) and collections of exotic plants including palm trees, chorisia, datura, and lotus, plus fine collections of citrus, olives, and palm trees. Rare species include Aloe marlothii, Araucaria columnaris, Castanospermum australe (Moreton Bay chestnut), Cnicothamnus lorentzi, and Ficus religiosa.

Their musicians were characterized by a strong English sensibility, as well as the French influence stemming from in-house writer/producer Louis Philippe. During its original run, él received much press interest, but little sales—except in Japan, where the label became an enormous influence on J-pop acts like Cornelius and Pizzicato Five. The label closed in 1989. In 2005, it was revived as a reissue label. ==Overview== Alway, who cut his teeth in the late seventies working with The Soft Boys and promoting clubs and concerts in Richmond, London, joined Cherry Red Records in 1980 to work alongside the company's founder, Iain McNay. Over the next few years he signed many of the artists who would become most closely associated with the label — The Monochrome Set, Felt, Everything But The Girl, Marine Girls, Fantastic Something, Eyeless in Gaza etc. This was widely recognised as a golden period for the label, culminating in the release of \\"Pillows & Prayers\\", the budget priced compilation that encapsulated the label's emerging style. It dominated the then prestigious UK independent charts in 1983. Alway then misguidedly (by his own subsequent admission) formed the Warner Bros. Records-backed Blanco Y Negro with Geoff Travis of Rough Trade, taking several Cherry Red artists with him, notably Monochrome Set and Everything But The Girl. The relationship with Warner Bros. did not gel, however, leading to a return to the Cherry Red family and the high concept él Records, which he had founded as a subsidiary outlet while at Blanco, became his new focus. él combined the technicolor exoticism of Powell and Pressburger with the escapist fantasy of The Avengers. The stylised visual aesthetic of The Prisoner with the dry-witted late seventies British television comedies The Good Life and The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin. Richard Briers and Leonard Rossiter were, to Mike Alway, what Malcolm McLaren was to Alan McGee. él's playful humour and highly visual aesthetic spoke to the Japanese and was a significant influence on the Shibuya-kei phenomenon that involved Cornelius, Pizzicato Five and Kahimi Karie. Indeed, él and Alway were immortalised in Kahimi Karie's domestic top ten hit, \\"Mike Alway's Diary\\", that was written by the high priest of \\"J-Pop\\", Keigo Oyamada. Although Alway had recruited a cast of performers he would describe as the best English pop writers of their generation — Vic Godard, Bid (The Monochrome Set), Karl Blake (Shock Headed Peters), Jessica Griffin (Would-be-goods), Victor Armada (Mayfair Charm School), Nick Currie (Momus), Philippe Auclair (Louis Philippe) and former Jonathan King teen prodigy Simon Turner (The King of Luxembourg), critical acclaim was not matched by sales and in 1988 the project was abandoned. In 2005, él reinvented itself (again under the Cherry Red flag) with Alway applying his eclectic taste to the restoration of historic editions; film soundtracks, jazz and flamenco guitar, Brazilian and Indian recordings, vocal and Modern Classical music ==Selected list of él artistsOriginal label=Historical label=See also== * List of record labels * List of independent UK record labels ==References== Category:British independent record labels Category:1984 establishments in England Category:Companies based in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames ","title":"Él Records"},{"id":"19252712","text":"Guggenheim Museum Fulcrum Gallery (also known as \\"Shakespeare's Fulcrum\\" or \\"Fulcrum\\") was an American art gallery that opened underneath the Guggenheim Museum SoHo in New York City in January 1993, by Valerie Monroe Shakespeare. It was designed by her husband, Tery Fugate-Wilcox, who contributed the gallery motto: \\"Without Art we are but Monkeys with Car Keys\\". Fugate-Wilcox is credited as photographer on all of the gallery's ads, and was listed as one of the nineteen artists represented by the gallery. The owner said in an interview, that the name \\"Fulcrum\\", (written with angular \\"u's\\", like old Latin) came from Archimedes, \\"Give me a place to stand, a lever long enough and a fulcrum. and I can move the Earth\\". She said she hoped Fulcrum would become a \\"pivotal point in art history\\".[Randell, Susan. \\"Dealers in the 1990s\\", Manhattan Arts International, June–Aug. 1994 pg. 6, Illust.] Fulcrum Gallery was founded to exhibit Actual Art exclusively [\\"Actual Art At Shakespeare's Fulcrum\\" Wall Street Reporter] and did so until the effects of the attacks of 9/11 caused the gallery to close in February 2002. ==History== The artist-oriented, artist-designed (by Tery Fugate-Wilcox) gallery was first located in a space at 144 Mercer Street, under the Guggenheim Museum, SoHo.

Art Now Gallery Guide, January 1995 – December 1998] After the exhibition at Robert Miller Gallery,[Lubelski, Abraham. \\"Tery Fugate-Wilcox at Robert Miller Gallery\\" New York Arts, International Edition, April 2000] publisher of New York Arts Magazine chose one of the photographs for the cover of their next issue. Valerie Shakespeare's nude torso was to be featured on the cover. The publisher, Abe Lubelski asked Tery Fugate-Wilcox to design the cover. His design is shown below. After stating he was \\"thrilled with the design\\" Lubelski asked Fugate-Wilcox to include thin profiles on either side of Shakespeare's image, of Mayor Juliani and Hans Haake, so that the magazine could cash in on a major controversy, at the time, over an artwork, \\"Nazi Garbage Cans\\", Haake was showing in the Whitney Museum, as a parody of the Mayor's conflict with the sanitation union.[Lubelski, Abraham. \\"Hans Haake at the Whitney Biennial\\" NY Arts, International Edition, April 2000, Illust.] Original design of New York Arts coverHowever, Lubelski then took it upon himself to reduce Shakespeare's figure to a circle, placed in the center of a Nazi flag,[COVER, illust.

Many SoHo residents came in to thank the artist for enabling their gardens to bear fruit for the first time. The bees were covered by CNN, in a 4-minute spot that aired all over the world, HBO, Art Now Gallery Guide, New York City Guide, the New York Times, Where Magazine and New York Magazine.[CNN, HBO, Art Now Gallery Guide, New York City Guide, the New York Times, New York Magazine, Where Magazine] WNYW's Good Day New York did its entire show, with Julie Golden, live from Fulcrum Gallery on March 9, 1995[Good Day New York, Fox 5, 3/9/95] and the movie Great Expectations used Shakespeare's Fulcrum Gallery in one of its scenes.

CBS, WNYW, NBC, and ABC, covered, along with the New York Times, art exploded in the street by Tery Fugate-Wilcox on Chinese New Year despite a ban on explosives by Mayor Giuliani. The owner, Valerie Shakespeare was interviewed during the huge Chinese dinner party, open to the public, and asked what she thought of the Mayor allowing a SoHo art gallery to set off explosives, while banning the same for all of Chinatown, breaking their 5000-year-old traditions? Ms. Shakespeare was seen on all the networks, saying, \\"I think it stinks!\\"[\\"Chinese New Year without its usual Bang\\", New York Times] ==Shakespeare's Fulcrum Dinners== Fulcrum gallery began, like all other galleries, having \\"regular\\" openings with tiny cups of white wine. But being raised in Arizona, Shakespeare's sense of hospitality moved her to offer food as well. After a particularly crowded opening, for which she had cooked all day, she noticed the neither she, nor none of her artists, staff or collectors had gotten anything to eat. As she sat in a restaurant, buying dinner for over 30 people, she wondered, \\"What's wrong with this picture?\\" So began her signature sit-down dinners every week, for friends and supporters of Actual Art.[New Yorker Magazine Goings on About Town Fulcrum Gallery Feb. 1995] In 1997, Fulcrum Gallery moved to a two-level space, complete with outdoor sculpture garden for art to weather, and a firepole, at 480 Broome Street, in SoHo. This gallery was also artist-designed, by Tery Fugate-Wilcox. The gallery continued at the Broome Street location, where the installation of a full kitchen permitted the gallery's weekly sit-down dinners to be expanded for 35 to 45 people and the occasional buffet party for hundreds, including the dinner party for Chinese New Year, with art by Tery Fugate-Wilcox, that was blown up on the street, complete with fireworks and a dragon for the celebration, during a ban by Mayor Rudy Giuliani on explosives,[ NBC, ABC, CBS, WNYW News; New York Times] and a Nude Portrait Marathon with Barneby Ruhe making conventional paintings of nude models, while Tery Fugate-Wilcox had living nudes standing in huge frames on the walls of the gallery.

Although the gallery struggled to keep its doors open, especially since several of its staff were living in the gallery, after they were made homeless by the collapse of the twin towers, the inability, coupled with unwillingness of clients to fly into New York City in the aftermath of the tragedy, finally caused Fulcrum Gallery, along with many other galleries and businesses, to go out of business and close its doors permanently.[\\"Life is\\" New York Observer January 2005] ==Chronological list of one-person exhibitions== \\"Painting Brushes\\" \\"Collection\\" \\"3500 A.D.

Held on the eve of the nation's independence from Yugoslavia, this was Croatia's first international match in the modern era.Croatia - International Matches 1990-1995 , RSSSF However, the match was considered unofficial by FIFA, because Croatia at that time was not affiliated to FIFA. Croatia was readmitted to FIFA on 3 July 1992. ==Background== With the abolishing of the one-party political system in SFR Yugoslavia in 1990, SR Croatia's (constituent republic within the Yugoslav federation) first parliamentary elections were held over two rounds of voting on 22 April and 7 May 1990 resulting in an overwhelming victory for the nationalist Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) led by Franjo Tuđman. With the rising nationalism and ethnic tensions, several incidents took place at football matches in SR Croatia over the coming months. Only six days later, on Sunday, 13 May 1990, a riot broke out at Maksimir Stadium during a Yugoslav First League match between the Croatian club Dinamo Zagreb and the Serbian club Red Star Belgrade. Dinamo midfielder 21-year-old Zvonimir Boban attacked a policeman and got a 6-month suspension by the Yugoslav FA (FSJ), causing him to miss the 1990 FIFA World Cup as well as the pre-tournament friendlies.The Day Yugoslav Soccer Died At one of those friendlies on 3 June 1990 versus the Netherlands at Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb (Yugoslavia's last preparation match before the World Cup) local Croatian fans booed the Yugoslav anthem and players, while cheering for the opposing Netherlands side which won the match 0-2. On 26 September 1990, several weeks into the following Yugoslav League season, another incident broke out, this time in Split. Hajduk Split's home match against Partizan Belgrade at Poljud Stadium was cancelled after local fans stormed the pitch, chased Partizan players off, tore down the Yugoslav flag from the official mast and burned it.Knjiga o najvećim Hajdukovim utakmicama ==Game== The United States was on a tour of Europe where the team was already scheduled to play Poland.

The exhibition was permitted by the Croat secretary of the Football Association of Yugoslavia, Ante Pavlović, who suspended the decision of the association's own committees regarding the match.Ante Pavlović odlikovan Ordenom Reda časti Despite conflicting with the Yugoslav juniors' match in the European finals, the match drew 30,000 spectators.

According to Hindu scripture, the god Mahadev was very much impressed by the long and difficult practice (tapasya) of devil named Bhasmashoor. So the god Mahadev assured to Bhasmasoor to fulfill any of the wish. The devil Bhasmashoor asked a wish if he put his hand over whomsoever that will be destroyed immediately. But the Bhasmashoor wanted to check that power over the Mahadev himself. So that the god Mahadev had been chased by Devil and Mahadev was hidden here in a cave. This is how this place was known as escaped God(Bhag-Dev), and later this place is named as Bhardeu. This cave is known nowadays Gupteshwor Mahadev’s Cave, which is located on peak of the hill almost 2 hour walking from the village. Bhardeu VDC is just 22 km south from ring-road Satdobato.

Born in Transylvania, Kingdom of Hungary, since 1920 Romania, he became a German citizen in 1930, and then East German after 1945. From 1919 to 1920 he studied at the Leipzig Conservatory. In 1920 he enrolled at the Berlin Hochschule für Musik as a student of Rudolf Krasselt and Siegfried Ochs for conducting, and for orchestration of Emil von Řezníček, and with Friedrich Koch and Franz Schreker for musical composition, graduating in 1923. He served as choirsmaster at the Volksoper Berlin from 1923–1925. In 1927 joined Laban's dance company where he conducted productions for three years. Wagner-Régeny first gained notice as a composer with his theatre pieces for Essen. In 1929 he met the designer Caspar Neher, who wrote the texts for Wagner-Régeny's best-known operas. In 1930 Wagner-Régeny became a naturalized German citizen, and married, his wife being half-Jewish. Between 1930 and 1945 he worked as a freelance composer and teacher, and with the rise of the Nazis was promoted by a faction of the party as a composer of the future despite the stylistic closeness of his music to the proscribed Kurt Weill. He managed to gain the friendship and esteem of Baldur von Schirach and his works were performed by Karl Böhm and Herbert von Karajan. However, the success of his opera Der Günstling (after Georg Büchner, Dresden, February 20, 1935) was followed by doubts regarding his subsequent output, ending in a scandal with his opera Johanna Balk at the Vienna State Opera (April 4, 1941), which aroused the ire of Joseph Goebbels. As punishment, Wagner-Regény was drafted into the military in 1942 (or 1943), though he managed to secure a desk job in the army, and survived the war. After the close of World War II, Rudolf Wagner-Régeny opted for East instead of West Germany. He was director of the Rostock Hochschule für Musik from 1947 to 1950. In 1950 he was appointed as a professor of composition at the (East) Berlin Hochschule für Musik and at the Academy of Arts. He continued to work there until illness prevented it in 1968. As a composer, Wagner-Regény wrote numerous symphonic works and chamber works. He composed 12 operas of which Die Bürger von Calais (1936, libretto by Neher), Johanna Balk (1938), Das Bergwerk zu Falun (1958, after ETA Hoffmann) (cf. \\"The Mines of Falun\\") and Prometheus (1959) are considered his best work. His 1958 ballet Tristan is also greatly admired. He struggled to find a musical language distinct from the extremes of modernism but without any association with fascist aesthetics. His early compositions were inspired by Busoni, Kurt Weill and Schoenberg. His theatre collaborations with Neher and Bertolt Brecht were also of importance for the development of his style. After composing works along traditional lines, he adopted his own twelve-tone serial technique in 1950. In their transparency and austerity, his stage works follow the music theatre of Weill and Hanns Eisler and somewhat parallel those of Boris Blacher. ==Works== ;Stage works: * Moschopuls (première, Gera, 1928) * Der nackte König (Gera, 1928) * Sganarelle or Der Schein trügt (Essen, 1929) * La sainte courtisane (Gera, 1930) * Der Günstling (Dresden, 1935) * Die Bürger von Calais (Berlin, 1939) * Johanna Balk (Vienna, 1941) * Prometheus (Kassel, 1959) * Das Bergwerk zu Falun (Salzburg, 1961) * Persische Episoden (Rostock, 1963) ;Instrumental music: * Orchestral music with piano, 1935 * String quartet, 1948 * Two dances for Palucca, 1950 * Three orchestral pieces: Mythological Figures, 1951 * Three orchestral sets, 1952 * Seven fugues, 1953 * Introduction and ode for symphonic orchestra, 1967 ;Vocal music: * 10 Lieder on texts by Brecht, 1950 * Cantata “Genesis”, 1956 * Jüdische Chronik, 1961 * Hermann Hesse songs \\"Gesänge des Abschieds\\", 1968/69 * Three Fontane-Lieder, 1969 ==Sources== *David Drew.

He was capped once by England B. ==Playing career== Swinbourne began his career at Wath Wanderers, the Yorkshire-based nursery club of Wolverhampton Wanderers. He moved south to join Wolves in 1944 and signed as a professional the following year. After proving himself in the reserve ranks, he made his debut on 17 December 1949 in a 1–1 draw with Fulham. He came to the fore during the 1950–51 season, replacing Jesse Pye in the attack, and finished as top goalscorer with 22 goals. Injuries waylaid him the following year, but in the next campaign, forming what was described as \\"a potent dual spearhead\\" with Dennis Wilshaw, he was once again the club's leading scorer with 21 goals. His tally of 24 in the 1953–54 season was a career best and helped Wolves capture their first ever league championship. It was Swinbourne himself who scored twice in the final game, a 2–0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur that confirmed the title. The following season brought another strong return, including two goals in Wolves' famous floodlit victory over Honved of Hungary. In 1955 he scored for England B in a 1–1 draw against their German counterparts: His career was halted when he damaged his knee while hurdling over a posse of cameramen on the pitchside at Luton Town's Kenilworth Road ground in November 1955. After trying to return just weeks later, he was forced to undergo surgery on the injury. He was never able to resume his playing career and was forced to announce his retirement in May 1957. ==Later life== In later life, Swinbourne lived in Kinver before moving to a nursing home in Kidderminster. He died on 27 December 2015, aged 86, following a long battle with vascular dementia. He was survived by his wife, Betty, and daughters Jayne and Helen. ==References * Film clip of Wolves v Honved 1954 at British Pathé Category:1929 births Category:2015 deaths Category:People from Conisbrough Category:Footballers from Doncaster Category:English footballers Category:England B international footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. players Category:English Football League players ","title":"Roy Swinbourne"},{"id":"19252989","text":"Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service is the statutory fire and rescue service responsible for fire protection, prevention, intervention and emergency rescue in the county of Staffordshire and unitary authority of Stoke-on-Trent. The county has a population of 1,126,200 (mid-2017 est.) and covers a total area of 2,260 km2 (1,010 sq miles). Staffordshire shares the majority of its border with Derbyshire, Cheshire, West Midlands (County) and Shropshire; although, in much shorter stretches, the county also butts up against Worcestershire, Warwickshire and Leicestershire. As of 1st August 2018, the fire service functions under the control of the Staffordshire Police and Crime Commissionerhttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/696/made acting as the Fire & Rescue Authority. The county provides considerable risks to its residents and firefighters. These include the industrial city of Stoke-on- Trent and the large industrial towns of Burton-upon-Trent, Stafford, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Tamworth and Cannock. The busiest stretch of motorway in Europe (the M6 between Walsall and the north-west) runs through the county, as does the M6 Toll road. The main 'A‘ roads the A5, A50, A34 and A38 also cross the county. These well-used routes are regularly the scene of numerous road traffic accidents, vehicle fires and chemical incidents. There are also many significant rural risks in Staffordshire: The medieval hunting grounds of Cannock Chase is designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), and is made up of heathland, chaseland and forest that stretches between Stafford, Cannock, Rugeley and Chase Terrace. In the north of the county the Staffordshire Moorlands is an area of remote wilderness where The Pennines spill over the Derbyshire and Cheshire borders, and has an area of around 576 square kilometres (220 square miles). These areas pose a considerable risk of wildfires, and regularly keep firefighters extremely busy during hot dry spells. Also, the moorlands offer their own logistical difficulties during harsh winters, particularly to the residents of the towns and villages dotted throughout the hills - towns like Leek and Biddulph, and the villages of Ipstones and Longnor amongst others. The Staffordshire Moorlands is home to Flash, the highest village in Britain. It stands 463 metres (1,518 feet) above sea level. == Organisation == Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service ceremonial squad The service is run under the command of the Chief Fire Officer and an executive board, and provides emergency response from 33 strategically located fire stations, divided into three delivery groups: * Northern * Eastern * Western Staffordshire Fire & Rescue Service has its headquarters and training school at Pirehill near the town of Stone in mid-Staffordshire. Their fire control centre used to be at Pirehill, but was closed after its amalgamation with fire control of the West Midlands Fire Service in March 2014. So now both brigades operate under a joint control centre situated in Birmingham. The county's maintenance workshops are located at the Joint Emergency Transport Facility in Trentham Lakes industrial park, a Joint Workshop with Staffordshire Police and Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service. A Scania P94D appliance outside Brewood Fire Station in October 2015 Of the thirty-three strategically located fire stations, only Stafford, Tamworth Belgrave and Sandyford operate on a completely wholetime (W/T) 24-hour crewing basis. Longton, Hanley, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Cannock and Burton-upon-Trent operate as wholetime/retained stations (WT/RET), which means, along with a 24-hour station-based complement of firefighters, they have retained on-call \\"back-up\\" personnel that, when required, crew the second fire engine housed at the fire station, as well as some of the specialist appliances stationed there. All wholetime firefighters work the four \\"watch\\" system. This produces an eight- day week, with crews operating on a \\"two-days-on, two-nights-on, four-days- off\\" system. The eight-day week means that a firefighter's duty shifts and their days off \\"rotate\\" by one day week-to-week. Leek and Lichfield fire stations are day-crewed/retained (DC/RET): firefighters respond from the fire station as wholetime firefighters between the hours of 8:00am and 6:00pm with a retained on-call crew available if needed to crew other appliances based at the station. After 6:00pm the stations become retained on-call only, and the fire appliances are crewed by the same firefighters but not from the station itself. All other Staffordshire fire stations are retained on-call only (RET). All retained firefighters respond from home or work, and are notified by a pager, and, therefore, have to live or work within five minutes driving time of their station to meet strict Home Office response times. == Fire stations/appliances == { class= - valign=bottom !

But after the demise of Dennis as a chassis provider the fleet purchasers at Staffordshire Fire & Rescue service opted for Scania P94Ds with construction responsibilities shared between John Dennis Coachbuilders and Emergency One UK. They also purchased three M.A.N. 14.28 pump rescue ladders that were allocated to quieter, more rural stations; but these didn't prove too popular and were removed from active service ahead of time. As the ageing Dennis fleet was slowly retired the county soon became standardised on the Scania P chassis, although sister company M.A.N. were entrusted to provide the base for several \\"special\\" appliances, and to a one-off order of three four-wheeled-drive \\"Rural Response Pumps\\" which were allocated to the rural outposts of Longnor near Buxton and to Ipstones near Leek, with the third going to Cannock as their \\"on call\\" pump. In 2016, Staffordshire decided to take a drastic step away from the typically British type fire engine - although Staffordshire's current fire engines are built on a foreign chassis with a foreign cab, the actual fire engine itself is quintessentially British, and is typical of the type utilised by almost every British fire service for decades. But in 2017 Staffordshire F&RS; placed an order for eleven radical pumping appliances with a very distinctive European flavour from the British arm of the Austrian company Rosenbauer, Rosenbauer UK. Underneath, while still a typical \\"B-Type\\" fire engine, in styling they resemble the fire engines seen operating on mainland Europe for decades. They are third generation Rosenbauer AT appliances where the \\"AT\\" stands for \\"advanced technology\\". So in many ways, they are far removed from the usual British fire engine because of their many innovations developed at Rosenbauer. They are built on the Volvo FL6.14 chassis, which is another first for Staffordshire. Each of Staffordshire's ten wholetime/day-crewed fire stations will receive one AT, with the eleventh going to Penkridge, Staffordshire's busiest on-call (retained) station. The appliances are similar to those purchased by Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service and by Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service. Deliveries were expected to begin in the Spring of 2018, but because of teething problems, they actually began to enter service in February 2019 and continued through 2019 and into 2020. Staffordshire Fire Brigade used to operate three different frontline pumping appliances, and designated them thus: Pump Escapes, (PE) Water Ladders (WrL), Water Tenders (WrT). Pump Escapes fell out of favour with every brigade, and Staffordshire's were phased out in the late 1970s, leaving just Water Ladders and Water Tenders, with neither appliance carrying any considerable rescue equipment. Through the eighties and nineties RTC rescue gear was carried on five Rescue Tenders and two Special Incident Units. But in the mid-1990s Staffordshire began a program of enhancing the rescue gear on its frontline 'first-away' Water Ladders which led to the eventual removal of all-but-one Rescue Tender and both Special Incident Units. They also changed from being a 'Brigade' to a 'Fire & Rescue Service' to reflect this modernisation. These 'enhanced' Water Ladders became designated as Pump Rescue Ladders (PRL) at one pump fire stations, and Rescue Ladders (RL) at multi-pump stations because they no longer carried a light portable pump (LPP), whereas the station's Water Tender still carried one. From around 2010 to 2020 Staffordshire designated their frontline pumping appliances in four different ways: Pump Rescue Ladders, Pump Rescue Tenders, Water Tenders and its four- wheeled-drive pumps as Rural Response Pumps. But in the spring of 2019 managers committed to simplify the jargon by referring to all of their frontline pumping appliances as Pump Rescue Ladders (PRL). The following list of chassis and body-builders explains the current, and previous, fleet's designations: * PRL - Latest purchases that became operational in 2019 and 2020 - Volvo FL6.14/Rosenbauer AT * PRL (PRT) - Scania P285DB/Emergency One * PRL & WrT - Scania P94D/Emergency One, Scania P94D/John Dennis Coachbuilders, Scania 270DB/Emergency One * PRL (RRP) - M.A.N.

By 2009 austerity had seen 70 full-time firefighter jobs lost in Staffordshire alone. Then between 2011 and 2015 Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service were forced to make a £4 million saving. In 2016 they had a further £1.5 million cut from their £45 million annual budget. Along with firefighters, appliances were lost too. Burton-upon-Trent and Newcastle-under- Lyme each used to operate two wholetime fire engines and one retained. Both stations had a wholetime pump replaced by a 'targeted response vehicle': a smaller fire appliance based on a Mercedes Benz van chassis. Several of these appliances were purchased over the next few years, and were used in place of conventional full-sized fire engines. Reports of their effectiveness were mixed, but eventually all but one of them has been retired or mothballed. Today only Lichfield operate one, and is crewed by their retained sector. Hanley in Stoke-on-Trent city centre used to operate a turntable ladder high- reach appliance, but it was never replaced when it was retired. County town Stafford once operated two wholetime pumps, a high-reach aerial ladder platform, a rescue tender and a rope rescue unit. Today it just operates one wholetime pump and the ageing Land Rover rope rescue unit. Its hydraulic platform and rescue tender were not replaced upon their retirement, and their second pump transferred to the newly built Rising Brook retained fire station on the opposite side of the town. Burslem fire station in Stoke-on-Trent was once a wholetime/retained station operating two pumps and a foam tender, but when in 2011 a new one-pump wholetime fire station became operational at Sandyford near Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent, Burslem fire station became a single- pump retained set-up, with their foam capability transferring to Cheadle. At the same time the two-pump day-crewed/retained station at Kidsgrove to the north of Stoke lost their day-crewed pump, becoming a one-pump retained station. The two-pump retained fire stations of Uttoxeter, Cheadle and Wombourne each lost their water tender in 2007. With two-pump retained Rugeley and Stone losing theirs in 2016. In 2010/2011 Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service began a major fire station rebuild and modernisation programme. The £100 million required to build twenty-two brand-new state-of-the-art 'community fire stations' and to modernise six others came from a PFI initiative. The towns of Stafford and Tamworth also gained a second fire station to enable firefighters to meet strict attendance times in the congested towns. The extensive rebuild was divided into two phases: * Phase One: Complete rebuilds at Burslem, Cannock, Hanley, Kidsgrove, Newcastle- under-Lyme and Uttoxeter; with brand-new additional stations at Rising Brook (Stafford) and Sandyford (Stoke-on-Trent); two brand-new stations in Tamworth to replace the one existing station located in the town centre which found itself far enough away from the newly built areas of the rapidly growing town to merit a second station to meet strict response times. The two new stations are designated as Tamworth Belgrave (wholetime) and Tamworth Mercia (retained on-call). Phase One also saw significant refurbishments at Biddulph, Barton- under-Needwood, Cheadle, Gnosall, Longnor and Wombourne. * Phase Two: Complete rebuilds at Burton-upon-Trent, Chase Terrace, Codsall (now designated as Bilbrook & Codsall), Kinver, Leek, Lichfield, Loggerheads (to replace nearby Ashley fire station which closed when the new station became operational), Longton (Stoke-on-Trent), Penkridge, Rugeley and Stone. == See also == * Fire service in the United Kingdom * Staffordshire Police * West Midlands Ambulance Service * List of British firefighters killed in the line of duty == References  External links == * Category:Local government in Staffordshire Category:Fire and rescue services of England ","title":"Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service"},{"id":"19253007","text":"John David Donaldson (born May 5, 1943 in Charlotte, North Carolina) is an American former Major League Baseball second baseman.

Bungamati is a Newar town on a spur of land overlooking the Bagmati River The first stele of the Licchavi king Amshuverma was found in Bungamati and dated to 605. It contains the earliest mention of the Kailashkut Bhawan palace. ==Names and History== During the Licchavi Kingdom, the town was called Bugayumigrama. The word 'Bugayumi' is a Kiratian dialect so it is the proof that the settlement had come into existence since Kirati period before the Christian Era. During the Malla period, it was called Bungapattan. Bungamati is also called Amarapur or Amaravatipur. The original settlement of Bungamati was located uphills around the recent 'Chunikhel' area; recent 'Bungamati' being the place of cremation surrounded by huge forest, the original place is still called 'Bugal'. It is said that when Red Machhindranath was brought into the valley then the settlement was shifted to present location of Bungamati after the temple of Red Machhindranath was constructed. ==Temples/ Monasteries== Bungamati is the hometown of the deity Machhindranath, regarded as the patron of the valley and his large shikhara- style temple in the center of the village square is his home for six months of the year; he spends the rest of his time in Patan. The process of moving him back and forth between Patan and Bungamati is one of the most important annual festivals in the valley. The Karya Binayak Temple, one of the most important temples in Nepal, is dedicated to Ganesha. The view is spectacular from the temple, which is surrounded by trees and large bamboo and overlooks the Bagmati valley to the foothills. thumb ===Machhindranath Temple=== thumb The central ritual focus of Bungamati is the Temple of Machhindranath. To the villagers, Machhindranath is known by the name “Bungadeya”; the name is derived either after the village founded at the spot where Bhairav howled “bu” (birthplace) or from the word “Bungaa:” meaning “watering place” or “spring” like the explanation of the name of the village and several residents in Bungamati offer the second derivation. Bungadeya has many important mythological, historical and contemporary ritual associations with water. Bungadeya being a primordial rain god, who was later identified with the benevolent Aryavalokiteshvara. Machhindranath is also known by the name of “Karunamaya” meaning an embodiment of love and kindness like a mother figure. While Bungamati Newa people refer to Machhindranath as Bungadeya, Newas from other parts of the valley use the name Karunamaya to refer to Machhindranath. The god of Bungamati and Patan is also identified as Raktapadmapani Lokeshvara and Aryavalokiteshvara. Another important part of historical importance in Bungamati is the living goddess, Kumari. Generally, people only know three Kumaris (in Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhaktapur), but there is also one in Bungamati. ===Hayangriva Bhairab Temple=== Hayangriva is chief Bhairav among all the ancient Bhairavs of Kathmandu Valley. The protector and ancestor god of Bungamati is Hayangriva Bhairav. ===Manakamana Temple or Aju/Aji Bhairav Temple=== Bungamati is also homeabode of Goddess Manakamana. People believe that Manakamana is in Gorkha district, but the fact is the original Manakamana is in Bungamati. It is said that upper part of the body of Goddess above navel is in Bungamati and lower part of the body below navel is in Gorkha. Bungamati observes Manakamana Jatra as the main festival of Bungamati which usually occurs in the month of October during Navami, Dashami and Ekadashami of Dashain festival. During those three days the temple at Gorkha is shut down and the priest sends the devotees to Bungamati ===Shristikanta Lokeshvara Temple=== Bungamati is the birthplace of Shristikanta Lokeshvara, the god attributed to the creation (shristi) of overall living entities of the world. There is ample of evidences that shows Bungamati as the foremost settlement of Kathmandu Valley, and one of the reason is it is the home abode of Shristikanta Lokeshvara who created existence of Nepa Valley. ===Karyabinayak Temple=April 2015 Nepal earthquake== After the April 2015 Nepal earthquake, the city saw a massive destruction as most of its houses were made up of traditional mud and brick elements. Almost three years after the earthquake residents in Bungamati have yet to see any restoration work. Both residential homes and historic monuments remain in ruins. Faced with a winter of little shelter residents moved back into damaged buildings.http://admin.myrepublica.com/society/story/44248/15-months-after- killer-quake-bungamati-still-in-ruins.html ==Gallery== File:Bhairav of Bugmati.jpgBugmati Bhairav File:Bungamati Temple.JPG File:Bungamati.jpg File:Bungamati, village newar (Népal) (8629060836).jpg File:Bungamati, village newar (Népal) (8629058868).jpg File:Sur la place du temple (Bungamati, Népal) (8627953571).jpg File:Bunga Dyo ( Rato Machhendranath ) at Bungamati, Lalitpur.jpg ==References *UN map of the municipalities of Lalitpur District *Fourth Kumari of Bungamati Category:Populated places in Lalitpur District, Nepal ","title":"Bungamati"},{"id":"19253048","text":"Prinsepia is a genus of trees in the Rosaceae.

Dalchoki has a temple dedicated to Dalchoki devi. According to another myth, Dalchoki was said to be a point from where Prithivi Narayan Shah attacked Kathmandu.

These intentions soon became apparent when he was found playing 7 card stud poker with 11 other men; Prince was a poker cheat extodinaire in his youth, and it became known he was running an underground gambling den cheating other men out of their money then wiring it back to Liberia. He left the village on the next bus (the number 691 to Kenya). ==Staying in Dalchoki== Timilsina Community Home-Stay Dalchoki has a Home-stay facility. There are about 6 home-stays registered under Nepal Tourism Board in Dalchoki. ==Demography== A women plucking SoyabeansDalchoki has a diverse ethnicity. There are Tamang, Brahmin and Chhetri, Magar and Nagarkotis in majority while there are few Sunuwars (categorized as Dalits) and other ethnic communities. Dalits share a better-off position in Dalchoki and a less discriminative environment in classes. Restrictions on touching taps or drinking water touched by the Dalits are much abolished concept in Dalchoki. Most people follow Buddhism and Hinduism. The main languages spoken here are Tamang and Nepali and few of the Nagarkoti speak their language ==Climate== Mustard fields of DalchokiThe climate of Dalchoki is mostly cold. It often is foggy. In winter the temperature goes below 0° Celsius and results in jamming of water supply with water frozen inside the pipes. At certain year interval, it snows at Dalchoki. ==Transportation== Mustard fields of Dalchoki Dalchoki has an access to a graveled road. The bus route to Ikudol from Lagankhel plied via Dalchoki but on year 2012-13 it fell under an upgrading plan and no longer reaches Dalchoki. ==Education== The schools in Dalchoki include: *Shree Goth-Bhanjyang Higher Secondary School *Shree Manokamana Primary School *Shree Buddha Primary School ==References *UN map of the municipalities of Lalitpur District Category:Populated places in Lalitpur District, Nepal ","title":"Dalchoki"},{"id":"19253129","text":"Devichaur is a village development committee in Lalitpur District in the Bagmati Zone of central Nepal.

The SCAJAP fleet was designated Task Group 96-3 in the organization of Naval Forces Japan. ==Fleet and operations== Japanese hospital ship Takasago Maru At the end of the war Japan was acutely short of large passenger ships. Only two had survived hostilities: NKK Line's Hikawa Maru and OSK Line's Takasago Maru. Both had served as hospital ships and SCAJAP requisitioned them as transport ships. On 7 December 1945 a conference was held at Tokyo as a result of which it was recommended that 100 Liberty ships, 100 LSTs and seven hospital ships be made available to SCAJAP for repatriation. The ships were to be converted in Japan to carry repatriates and were crewed by the Japanese. Of the shipping requested, 106 Liberties and 100 LST's were received, but only 85 of the LST's were retained for repatriation, the other 15 LST's being used to support the economy of Korea. On arrival in Japan, under direction of SCAJAP, these ships were modified to carry passengers, provided with trained Japanese crews, and put in service at a rate of 25 a week. Six of the Liberties were converted into hospital ships of about 1,200 beds each. Since total available passenger capacity of these SCAJAP vessels was approximately 400,000 by the end of March 1946, all United States Seventh Fleet shipping was released from repatriation. Over 50 percent of the total Japanese repatriation fleet, with a capacity of 100,000 spaces supplemented US shipping.(Source: MacArthur D.

Tracy on Iwo Jima (February 24, 1945) William Homer Genaust (October 12, 1906 – March 4, 1945) was a United States Marine Corps sergeant who was missing in action during the battle of Iwo Jima while serving as a war photographer in World War II. He is best known for filming the second U.S. flag-raising on top of Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945. Genaust operated a then-modern and lightweight 16 millimeter motion picture camera which used 50-foot color film cassettes.You Tube, Smithsonian Channel, 2008 Documentary (Genaust films) \\"Shooting Iwo Jima\\" Retrieved July 5, 2015 His motion picture of the flag- raising became one of the best-known film clips of the war, and documents the event famously depicted in the Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia. Genaust was reportedly killed in action nine days later, and his remains have not been recovered. == U.S. Marine Corps == Iwo Jima footage, including scenes preceding and following the flag-raisings on Iwo Jima, digitally scanned in 2016 by the Motion Picture Preservation Lab at the National Archives Born in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Bill Genaust was raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He enlisted in the Marine Corps in Minneapolis on February 11, 1943, to be a combat cameraman. After recruit training, he was sent to Quantico, Virginia, to become a Marine Corps still photographer and motion picture camera photographer. === Battle of Saipan === Genaust served in the Pacific Theater during World War II and was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star Medal with Combat \\"V\\" and Purple Heart Medal in September 1945, for heroic actions using a rifle in a firefight on Saipan where he was wounded on July 9, 1944. He was recommended for the Navy Cross by Norman Hatch, his photo section commander, but the nomination was turned down because Genaust was a cameraman and not an infantryman. He also shared in the Navy Presidential Unit Citation awarded to the 4th Marine Division for the Battle of Saipan and Tinian (June 15 – August 1, 1944). It took eight months for Genaust to recover from his leg wound he obtained on Saipan. He was given the opportunity to return home, but instead he volunteered to go to Iwo Jima. === Battle of Iwo Jima === Portion of Genaust's footage of the second flag-raising on Iwo Jima used in the 1945 film To the Shores of Iwo Jima Genaust (left, with motion picture camera) and Joe Rosenthal capturing what became known as the \\"Gung Ho\\" image of the Marines present at the second flag-raising on Iwo Jima (February 23, 1945) Genaust was assigned to help train Marine photographers on how to film in a combat zone. There were three Marine divisions in a force of approximately 70,000 servicemen which included about 60 Marine cameramen training to assault Iwo Jima. Genaust would accompany the Marine infantrymen riding in and on landing craft. On February 19, filming on the way in, Genaust landed on the beach with members of the 4th Marine Division. On the third day, he moved closer to Mount Suribachi where the 28th Marines, 5th Marine Division were located with orders to capture the mountaintop. There he teamed with Marine still photographer Pfc. Bob Campbell, and proceeded to take more film action at the base of Suribachi. On February 23, 1945, a 40-man patrol consisting primarily of members of Third Platoon, E Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines, 5th Marine Division were ordered to climb up Mount Suribachi and seize and occupy the summit. The patrol was led by E Company's executive officer, First Lieutenant Harold Schrier, who had volunteered to take over the platoon and raise the battalion's small American flag to signal the volcano was captured. The flag which was attached to a Japanese iron water pipe was raised approximately 10:30 a.m., by Schrier, his platoon sergeant, and another sergeant.Platoon Sergeant Ernest Thomas was interviewed by CBS broadcaster Dan Pryor on February 25, 1945, aboard the USS Eldorado (AGC-11): \\"Three of us actually raised the flag\\". Marine photographer Staff Sergeant Lou Lowery accompanied the patrol and photographed the Marines and Navy corpsmen climbing to the top of Mount Suribachi, the Marines tying the flag on the pipe, and the men around the flagstaff after it was raised. Around noon, Marine photographers Sergeant Genaust and Private Campbell were ordered to go up Mount Suribachi. On the way there, they met Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal who first arrived on Iwo Jima with the 4th Marine Division on February 19 (he went back and forth from a ship each day), but missed the first flag raising on top. The three photographers proceeded to climb up Mount Suribachi together as a four Marines from Second Platoon, E Company, also climbed up with orders to raise a large replacement flag on top. On the way up, Rosenthal, Genaust, and Campbell met Lowery coming down who told them about the first American flag raising. Once on top, another Japanese pipe was found and the second and larger U.S. flag was attached unto it which would make a single flag on top more visible from any point on the island. After the three got on top, Genaust with his motion picture camera, stood at the left side of Rosenthal, and filmed the second flag being hoisted by six Marines. USMC Statement on Marine Corps Flag Raisers, Office of U.S. Marine Corps Communication, 23 June 2016 Under Lt. Schrier's orders, the larger flag was raised as the smaller flag was lowered. Genaust's film captured the six Marines getting in place to raise the larger flag, the raising of the flag/flagstaff, and the securing of the bottom of the flagstaff with rocks. Rosenthal became famous for taking the black and white photograph of the second flag raising which appeared in Sunday newspapers on February 25. Similar still photographs were also taken on top of Mount Suribachi by Campbell and other photographers including a U.S. Army and U.S. Coast Guard photographer. Genaust's film also captures other Marines on the summit as they gaze up at the flag during the second flag raising. These Marines are not visible in Rosenthal's famous photograph. === Death === Genaust was reported missing in action on March 3, 1945, after he was shot in a large cave at or around Hill 362-A, located on the northern part of Iwo Jima. On March 4, he was ruled killed in action. After talking with two photographers at Iwo Jima, Genaust's friend Lt. Col. Donald L. Dickson offered the following account of Genaust's death in a letter to his widow: :As I understand it, a group of Marines were clearing caves of die-hard Japs. Grenades were thrown in one cave and it was believed all the enemy were killed. The Marines wanted to double check and asked Bill if they could borrow his flashlight. Bill said he would go in with them. They crawled in and Bill flashed his light around. There were many Japs still alive and they immediately opened fire. Bill dropped without a sound. As the bearer of the light he had been the first target for a number of bullets. I feel sure he never knew what happened to him. :The Marines forced the Japs deeper into the cave but could not get them out. More men would have been killed in carrying out of the narrow cave Bill's lifeless body. :TNT charges were quickly placed at the cave mouth and exploded. The whole cave mouth was blocked with earth from the explosion and Bill's body was completely buried by it. Photo section commander Norman Hatch gave some detail on the circumstances around Genaust's death. He reported that, because of poor lighting conditions on Iwo Jima, Genaust had joined an infantry team clearing caves and tunnels. At one cave, a Japanese soldier was found sitting at a table and shuffling routine paperwork. The Marines called out but were unable to get his attention. An interpreter, a lieutenant, was brought in to speak to the soldier in Japanese, but he received no response. As the patrol leader got ready to go underground to investigate, he asked Genaust for his flashlight. Genaust said he would go in himself and talk to the Japanese soldier. Two- thirds of the way into the cave Genaust was shot by machine-gun fire coming from a hidden entrance. The lieutenant ordered the cave closed, and Genaust's body was buried in the blast. Despite renewed search efforts in 2007, the body of Genaust has not been recovered. He is among 250 Americans listed missing on Iwo Jima, although most of those were lost at sea. == Military awards == Genaust's military decorations and awards include the following: { - colspan=\\"5\\" align=\\"center\\" -    -    - } {  - colspan=\\"5\\" align=\\"center\\"Bronze Star Medal w/ Combat \\"V\\" colspan=\\"5\\" align=\\"center\\" Purple Heart Medal w/ one \\" Gold Star - colspan=\\"5\\" align=\\"center\\"Combat Action Ribbon colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"center\\"Navy Presidential Unit Citation colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"center\\"Navy Unit Commendation - colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"center\\"American Campaign Medal colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"center\\"Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal w/ two \\" bronze stars colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"center\\"World War II Victory Medal - } ;Certificate of Appreciation Genaust received a posthumous Certificate of Appreciation from the Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Paul X.

Social Security Administration. was a 6-year-old American boy who became the center of a legal battle between his parents, Steve and Gayle Koochin, and Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City. ==Biography== Jesse Koochin was born in Dunedin, Florida the youngest of four children born to Steve and Gayle Koochin, and resided in Clearwater. His parents were Scientologists. His mother worked as a graphic designer and his father as an engineer. ==Cancer diagnosis and treatment== Shortly after his sixth birthday, Jesse was diagnosed with an \\"inoperable and incurable\\" brain tumor— medulloblastoma with metastasis to the brain and spine—on April 19, 2004. His parents sought holistic treatment in three states, including Georgia, where they agreed to try standard radiation treatment as his condition worsened. However, Jesse's condition was determined to be too advanced for radiation or chemotherapy, so his parents took him to another alternative clinic in Mexico for treatment. His parents claimed he improved in Mexico from the alternative treatment. The Mexican treatment included \\"injecting him with live cells from the embryo of a blue shark and placing an ointment on his head, which his father described as killing and pulling out the tumors.\\" The Koochins then sought more holistic treatment at the Modern Health Clinic in Bountiful, Utah, but the clinic determined he was too ill for treatment. On September 15, 2004, Jesse developed respiratory problems and was taken to Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City and placed on a ventilator. On October 8, \\"his tumor pushed his brain stem down through the skull,\\" and he was in an unresponsive coma. Subsequently, two physicians independently examined him on October 11 and 12 and determined that the child was brain dead. The hospital informed his parents that they would order life support removed within 24 hours. ==Legal fight== However, the Koochins rejected the hospital's definition of death. Instead, relying on traditional notions of cardiopulmonary death, they filed for an immediate restraining order to keep Koochin on a ventilator and to receive other treatment. They declared that he had been in a \\"similar coma\\" from May 23, 2004 to July 11, 2004 and had successfully awakened, and also claimed that the hospital staff did not perform an EEG exam or cerebral perfusion study to test for brain activity. The Utah judge granted the restraining order on October 13 and ruled that the hospital would not be allowed to declare him brain dead without performing the two tests.

He currently lives in San Antonio, Texas with his wife Layne and their son Brennen and daughter Bo. ==Professional life== Downes holds both Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees from California Polytechnic State University. In the early 1990s, after a three-year teaching stint in public education, Bobby spent much of the 90's leading teams of missionaries into more than 20 countries as an ambassador. In 1999, Bobby founded ChristianCinema.com, now the largest selection of faith-affirming and family- approved movies on the Internet. The company is the largest independent retailer of faith-based movies in the U.S. The company specializes in title curation and consumer marketing of faith-based movies and is respected in the industry as one of the leading key indicators for faith-based movies. He led the company into one of 2010’s 'Inc. 5000' leading companies in America. Today, the company is the leading Transactional Video on Demand platform for Christian & Family Movies with thousands of movies streamed over platforms like iOS, Apple TV, Roku, and Android. During the last two decades, Bobby has been involved in every aspect from script development, financing, production, marketing and distribution worldwide in all formats. Bobby has produced more than a dozen feature films for the faith market. Beginning in 1999, Bobby produced his first independent feature film The Moment After and its sequel The Moment After 2: The Awakening, both of which were acquired by Sony Pictures. Bobby produced Mercy Streets starring Eric Roberts and again worked with Roberts in Six: The Mark Unleashed', starring Stephen Baldwin and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Both films acquired for distribution by Sony Pictures. He executive produced for producer Ralph Winter (X-Men, Fantastic 4) on Frank Peretti's best-selling novel film version distributed by 20th Century Fox, producing The Lost Medallion with Bill Muir, The Redemption of Henry Myers and Hoovey, the true life story of Eric Elliott.

From January 2006 through the end of 2008, Bobby helped finance, develop the branding, collaborated on the writing and was core to bringing the #1 New York Times' best-selling novel The Shack to publication through its first million books sold. He was then instrumental in structuring a deal with Hachette Book Group, the world's second largest publisher. The book has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide and remained number one on the New York Times Bestseller list for more than 50 weeks. ==FilmographyProducer/Executive Producer=== *The Moment After (1999) *Mercy Streets (2000) *Lay It Down (2001) *Time Changer (2002) *Six: The Mark Unleashed (2004) *The Visitation (2006) *The Moment After 2 (2006) *Like Dandelion Dust (2009) *The Lost Medallion (2009) *The Redemption of Henry Myers (2013) *Hoovey (2013) *Faith of our Fathers (2015) *The National Bible Bee Game Show (Season 2) (2017) ==References * Category:American film producers Category:Living people Category:1967 births ","title":"Bobby Downes"},{"id":"19253387","text":"Vivy may refer to: * Vivy, Belgium, a town in Belgium, now part of the municipality of Bouillon * Vivy, Maine-et-Loire, a French municipality in the Maine-et-Loire department *Grand-Vivy Castle in Switzerland *Petit-Vivy Castle in Switzerland *Vivy Yusof, Malaysian businesswoman ==See also== *Vivi (disambiguation) ","title":"Vivy"},{"id":"19253429","text":"James Jeffrey Roche (May 31, 1847April 3, 1908) was an Irish-American poet, journalist and diplomat. Roche emigrated as a young child, and grew up in Prince Edward Island, Canada. He came to Boston in 1866, and joined the staff of the Irish newspaper. He became editor-in-chief in 1890, and was a leading spokesman for Catholic intellectuals in New England. When most Democrats in the region deserted William Jennings Bryan in 1896, Roche and the Boston Pilot gave Brian strong support.

The family settled in Prince Edward Island in the same year as his birth. The boy was educated by his father, and later in St. Dunstan's College. Here, at the age of fifteen, foreshadowing his career, he turned journalist and proudly edited the college weekly \\"unto the urn and ashes\\" of its infant end. His youth had a fair share of spirited adventure, an encountering of odd characters and scenes, a sharp observance of events, and a close, rapid, honest mental life.The Magazine of poetry, Vol.1 (1889) Charles Wells Moulton, Buffalo, New York In 1866 he went to Boston, became a businessman and prospered there, but later reverted to literature, his early love and first unconscious choice. In print he was noted for an absurd, unique humor. Already married, in 1883 he joined the staff of the Boston Boston Pilot as an assistant editor under John Boyle O'Reilly, and later became editor of the newspaper. At this time he wrote a History of the Filibusters in Spanish America, a novel, and a drama.

The limitations of this class are that at any one issue (i.e. yearly) only ten may be awarded. There may however only be fifty members of this award at any one time. Any person whether national or expatriate may be appointed to this class if they are distinguished persons. The Court of St James's has placed it immediately above the Knight/Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, and below the Knight/Dame Grand Cross of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. The medal, designed by Patrick O'Callaghan, is two inches in overall size and made in silver gilt and enamels. The straight armed cross pattee in silver gilt has linking the four arms the crescent shape symbol of the paramount chiefs. Each such link contains a double headed frigate bird which is cast into the crescent shape. In the centre the shield only of the Solomon Islands Coat-of-Arms in full colour enamels sits on a green enamel background. This is surrounded by a royal blue enamel circular band with base metal (i.e. silver gilt) piping on both circumferences and contains the wording \\"SERVICE TO SOLOMON ISLANDS\\" in raised silver gilt lettering. At the top of the cross is a ring to which a loop, made of gilt, is attached. The medal is awarded with individual metal cases covered with blue rexine and lined with green velvet. O'Callaghan, R. (1986) Solomon Islands Honours and Awards. Honiara: Solomon Islands Government. The design of the Cross originates from two sources. The first is from the honours and awards systems throughout the world which have used for many years the basic cross shape. The second is that the cross is the traditional symbol of Christianity, which has spread throughout Solomon Islands. All the awards in the Order of Solomon Islands are of the \\"neck hanging\\" variety, and are not accompanied with lapel pins. The reason for this is rather simple. As the majority of the population of Solomon Islands live outside the capital city in rural areas, and in a hot and humid tropical climate, it is very acceptable for men to wear little if any clothing on the top half of their bodies. With nowhere to pin an award it seemed sensible to design the award as a neck hanger. == See also == * Star of Solomon Islands * Commonwealth realms orders and decorations == References == Category:Solomon Islands culture Category:Orders, decorations, and medals of the Solomon Islands Category:Awards established in 1981 Category:1981 establishments in the Solomon Islands ","title":"Cross of Solomon Islands"},{"id":"19253447","text":"Echoes from Ugarit includes original music compositions for piano and orchestra recorded with The Russian Philharmonic Orchestra with Seregey Kondrashev as a conductor, and Andrey Kudryavtsev concertmaster.

Like its predecessor, it was a conventional, low-wing cantilever monoplane with fixed, tailskid undercarriage. The Kl 32, however, had a smaller cabin (seating three), and a fuselage built from wood rather than metal. Eight Kl 32s were entered in the competition, seven by German teams and one by a Swiss team. These were powered by a variety of engines, including the Bramo Sh 14, Argus As 8, de Havilland Gipsy, and Hirth HM 150. Notable German pilots included Robert Lusser (who designed the aircraft), Wolf Hirth, and Reinhold Poss. Hirth won the short takeoff trial in his Kl 32, and Poss tied for second place in the overall competition with his. Five of the teams flying Kl 32s finished in the top ten in the \\"rally over Europe\\" part of the competition, and five of the top ten scores overall were achieved by teams flying Kl 32s.

Kulischer (; 1881–1956) was a Russian American sociologist, an authority on demography, migration, and manpower, and an expert on Russia. Kulischer coined the phrase “displaced persons” A. J. Jaffe (April 1962), “Notes on the Population Theory of Eurgene M. Kulischer”. In: The Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly, Vol. 40, No. 2:187-206. and was among the first to seek to document the number of persons lost in the Holocaust as well as the subsequent relocation of millions of Europeans after World War II. ==Biography== Born in Kiev in 1881 he died in Washington D.C, on April 2, 1956. Like his father, Michael Kulischer a noted Russian historian, he insisted that no migration occurs in isolation. Along with his brother Alexander, he worked on Kriegs-und Wanderzüge, Weltgeschichte als Völkerbewegung (War and Migration; World History as Peoples' Movements), (Berlin-Leipzig, Walter de Gruyter, 1932) and Europe on the Move: War and Population Changes, 1917-1947. They were intended to show that migrations and wars go hand-in-hand. In a way, Kulischer was himself an example of a displaced person. Following the Russian Revolution (1917), he fled Russia for Germany in 1920. Following the collapse of the Weimar Republic, he fled Germany for Denmark. In 1936 he went to Paris. In 1941 — at the age of 60 — Kulischer \\"crossed clandestinely the demarcation line between the occupied and the unoccupied parts of France\\" and went to the United States; his brother Alexander, \\"when crossing the demarcation line, was arrested by Pétain's gendarmes and died in a concentration camp.” Eugene M. Kulischer (1948), Europe on the Move: War and Population Changes, 1917-1947. Columbia University Press ==Work== In the United States Kulischer “served successively as consultant or staff member of the International Labor Office, the Office of Strategic Services, the Bureau of the Census, the Department of the Army, and the Library of Congress. His major works include The Displacement of Population in Europe (Montreal, 1943), and Europe on the Move (New York, 1948)”.Obituary (April 1956), \\"Eugene M. Kulischer.\\" Population Index, Vol. 22:100 At the heart of Kulischer's work is a simple axiom: individual short- distance movements in their combined action create great population shifts.Europe on the Move, 1948 An expansion of that concept is his oft quoted dictum: > “The migratory movement is at once perpetual, partial, and universal. It > never ceases, it affects every people, but at a given moment it sets in > motion only a small number of each population; hence the illusion of > immobility. In fact, there is never a moment of immobility for any people, > because no migration remains isolated”.Europe on the Move, p. 9 With that paragraph Kulischer created a bridge linking the migration of individuals and the demographic fact of great migrations. Kulischer and his brother, along with millions of others, tried to put Europe as far behind them as they could on the eve of World War II. All of them had their own reasons. Some left because of their ethnicity, others because of their religion. Some left because of their politics, and others because they feared the upheaval they were sure was looming on the horizon. For Kulischer and his brother the reason was close at hand. Not only were they Jewish, they forecast the outcome of World War II based on demographic trends. They reasoned that Russia and Germany were on a collision course and Germany would lose.Europe on the Move, p. vi “Man's history,” Kulischer remarked, “is the story of his wanderings”.Europe on the Move, p. 8 From the standpoint of the sociology of knowledge he added, “Most scholars are rooted in their environment. They differ in their ability to outgrow it”.Jaffe, quoted on page 193 By combining those two statements we have Kulischer and a great many of his peers who lived as exiles abroad and grew as they moved, for instance Austrian Social Scientists in Exile 1933-1945.Müller, Reinhard and Christian Fleck (2000), \\"Österreichische Soziologinnen und Soziologen im Exil 1933 bis 1945\\" , University of Graz. As Jackson and Howe recently observed in evaluating the impact of migrations: > \\"E. M. Kulischer once reminded his readers that in A.D. 900 Berlin had no > Germans, Moscow had no Russians, Budapest had no Hungarians, Madrid was a > Moorish settlement, and Constantinople had hardly any Turks.

Originally playing folk metal, they turned more towards symphonic and gothic metal. Lyriel has recorded five studio albums and published a DVD of a live performance. ==History== The band's lineup remained unchanged from their formation until 2008. Lyriel played as opening act for bands such as Elis, Visions of Atlantis, Regicide, Xandria, Schandmaul, Corvus Corax, Saltatio Mortis, Oomph, Schelmish, Korpiklaani and Manfred Mann's Earth Band. In 2005 they toured Germany, Austria and Belgium with Elis and Visions of Atlantis, in February 2006 Lyriel played on the “Romantic Darkness Tour“ together with Regicide and Xandria. Moreover they played on the Celtic Rock Festival at Greifenstein castle in Hesse. A video was released of the show. The first studio album Prisonworld was released on 17 January 2005. Especially notable is the song \\"Lind e-huil\\" which is sung in Sindarin, a fictional Elvish language created by J. R. R. Tolkien. The song \\"The Symmetry of Disfiguration\\" was inspired by Wendy and Richard Pini's Elfquest series. Their second studio album Autumntales was published on 29 September 2006. It continues the band's style and among other songs contains a cover version of \\"Hijo de la Luna\\". The performance of the string instruments was lauded by the musical press, as well as Jessica Thierjung's singing. The track \\"My Favourite Dream\\", recorded together with Sabine Dünser of Elis, was also acclaimed as one of the harder songs on the album. In September 2008 drummer Daniel de Beer left the band and was replaced by Marcus Fidorra. Since then the lineup has changed several times. The First Chapters, a remastered compilation album containing the first two studio albums was published in 2009. A new album Paranoid Circus followed on 29 January 2010. German voice actor Simon Jäger, known for dubbing actors like Heath Ledger and Matt Damon, appears as a guest artist on the album, reading an introduction and an excerpt from Hermann Hesse's short story The Wolf in the middle of the album. German and Austrian reviews agreed that while offering a high musical standard this album lacks the general speed of the previous releases. The album was re-released on AFM Records in April 2011 with a new cover artwork and 2 bonus tracks. Lyriel signed with AFM Records in 2011. A fourth album named Leverage was released in February 2012. Among a mix of soft folk rock as well as symphonic metal, it features a duet with Schandmaul vocalist Thomas Lindner. Leverage received positive reviews in Germany, Austria and the United Kingdom. It was however noted that the \\"album does lose some steam near its conclusion\\" and that the band should have dared to evolve towards harder metal songs. Leverage contains two songs \\"The Road Not Taken\\" and \\"Parting\\" that are based on lyrics by Robert Frost and Charlotte Brontë respectively On the extended edition there is a version of \\"Everything's Coming Up Roses\\" by Black. The band's fifth album Skin and Bones was released in September 2014 after bassist Steffen Feldmann had left the band. In March 2015, founding member Oliver Thierjung announced that he had left the band because of health issues. He was replaced by Thomas Raser in April that year.

The program depicts unexpected and surprising animal encounters that are caught directly on tape at the scene. Each different video usually has computer 3D rendering of something to do with an animal attack on a human, either intentionally or unintentionally, animals fighting each other, animals causing havoc within a community, or animal rescues in which the animal is in grave danger (e.g., is deeply stuck in mud or ice, or is stuck on a cliff) or has been severely wounded. Most of the time, no one is killed, although a few deaths and many minor and severe injuries have occurred. Due to the disturbing content, Untamed & Uncut holds a TV-14 rating.

Zaragoza's taifa emerged in the 11th century following the destruction of the Caliphate of Córdoba in the Moorish controlled Iberian Peninsula. During the first three decades of this period (1018–1038), the city was ruled by the Arab Banu Tujib tribe. They were replaced by the Arab Banu Hud rulers, who had to deal with a complicated alliance with El Cid of Valencia and his Castilian masters against the Almoravids, who managed to bring the Taifas Emirates under their control. After the death of El Cid, his kingdom was conquered by the Almoravids, and by 1100 they had crossed the Ebro into Barbastro, which brought them into direct confrontation with Aragon. The Banu Hud stubbornly resisted the Almoravid dynasty and ruled until they were eventually defeated by the Almoravids in May 1110. The last sultan of the Banu Hud, Abd-al-Malik, and Imad ad-Dawla of Saraqusta, were forced to abandon the capital. Abd-al-Malik allied himself with the Christian Aragonese under Alfonso I of Aragon and from then on the Muslim soldiers of Saraqusta served in the Aragonese forces. Between c. 1040 and c. 1105, the Taifa of Lérida was separate from that of Zaragoza. ==List of EmirsTujibid dynasty=== *Mundir I al-Tuybi al-Mansur: c. 1013–1021/2 *Yahya: 1021/2–1036 *Mundir II: 1036–1038/9 *Abd Allah ibn al-Hakam al-Tujibi: 1038/9 ===Huddid dynasty=== *Suleiman Al-Mustain I ibn Hud: 1038/9–1046 *Muhammad al-Hayib Adud ad-Dawla (Calatayud): 1046/7–1066/7 with... *Lubb (Huesca): 1047–1048 and... *Mundir al-Hayib al-Zafir Nasir ad-Dawla (Tudela): 1047–1048/9 and... *Yusuf al-Muzaffar Sayf ad-Dawla (Lérida): 1047–1078/81 and... *Abu Ya'far Ahmad al-Muqtadir: 1046–1081 or 82/3 *Yusuf al-Mu'tamin: 1081 or 82/3–1085 *Ahmad II al-Musta'in: 1085–1110 *'Abd al-Malik Imad ad- Dawla (Rueda, Z. 1110 only): 1110–1130 *Abu Dja'far Ahmad Zafadola (Rueda.

The central character, Sir John, is based on Falstaff. It was written and performed by Matt Sax. The first performance was at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. ==Synopsis== The show opens with Sir John presenting his protégé, Clay, for his first major concert. Clay shows up an hour late, blood covering his face. In an attempt to stall for time, Sir John tells the audience the story of Clay's life. Clay's real name is Clifford Keys. His father is an emotionally absent businessman, and his mother is a depressed chain-smoker. When he is seven years old, Clifford's parents decide to divorce, and his father manipulates the boy into asking to stay with his father. After missing three of Clifford's birthdays in a row, Clifford's mother commits suicide. His father quickly remarries. Years pass, and Clifford is sixteen years old. To escape his dysfunctional family, he begins going to open-mic nights at a small bookstore. The MC is Sir John, a talented rapper whose face was deformed in a car accident and has no chance of getting signed to a record label. Clifford begins weekly hip-hop lessons with Sir John, and he begins his transformation from awkward novice to confident storyteller. When Sir John asks Clifford to rap about the girl he loves, Clifford reveals that he is in love with his stepmother, and they have slept together. Sir John begs Clifford to come live with him, but Clifford refuses. Clifford's father returns one night to find his wife and son in bed together. He throws Clifford out of the house, and Clifford goes to live with Sir John. Three years pass, and under Sir John's wing, Clifford has become the successful rapper Clay. His song about his family life is a radio hit. On the night of his on-stage debut, Clifford's father tracks him down and reprimands him for embarrassing his family, telling him, \\"Your mother is rolling in her grave.\\" In the ensuing fight, Clifford nearly kills his father, but he decides to let him go. After Clifford recounts the fight, Sir John tell him that he is proud of Clifford for letting his father go. They get him cleaned up in time for him to come out on stage and give a triumphant debut performance. ==Lincoln Center Production at The Duke on 42nd St.== Developed in collaboration with and directed by Eric Rosen * Sound Designer: Joshua Horvath * Orchestrator: Joshua Horvath * Music Producer: Joshua Horvath ==History== Kirk Douglas Theatre during the 2008 run of Clay.

In authenticated hadiths, Sufyani is said to be descended from Abu Sufyan.Naim ibn Hammad, al- Fitan, 1/282 According to hadiths, he will be the rival and opponent of Mahdi. Reports about Sufyani are available in both Sunni and Shia Hadith collections. The Sufyani is a distinctly different individual than the Dajjal. The hadith regarding the Sufyani specify that he is a tyrant who will spread corruption and mischief on the earth before the Mahdi. He will be such a tyrant that he will kill the children and rip out the bellies of women. The Sufyani will murder those from the household of the prophet and will rule over Syria. When he hears about the Mahdi, he will send an army to seize and kill him. However the earth will swallow this army before it even reaches the Mahdi. == Descendant of Sufyani == In a narrated hadith Sufyani is said to be descended from Abu Sufyan, father of the first Umayyad caliph(the hadith has no grading which makes it a weak narration). Naim bin Hammad, al-Fitan, 1/282 ==Prior to his emergence== Before the rise of the Sufyani, there will be a sedition in the Maghreb, which will spread in every direction that no party or group could protect itself from it. > Disorder, strife, and fear will emerge in the Magrib (west)... Strife will > proliferate. (Ash-Sharani, Mukhtasar Tazkirah al-Qurtubi, p. 440) > A kind of corruption will surface from which no party will be able to > protect itself, and spread immediately in every direction. This situation > will persist until one comes and says: “O people, from now on your leader is > Imam Mahdi(as).” (Ibn Hajar al-Haythami, Al-Qawl al-Mukhtasar fi \`Alamat al- > Mahdi al-Muntadhar, p. 23) Later the sedition which started in the west will arrive to Al-Sham (the Levant), thus two banners will fight for control over the Syrian region; they will fight until their armies are exhausted. ==Forecasting of Sufyani revolt and government== Following these events the Sufyani will start an uprising in the dry valley of Transjordan and move to seize Damascus, he will gain much support and he will advance to capture the rest of Syria, defeating the two other competing forces. Once he captures the 5 districts of Al-Sham, he will send armies to Iraq. Shaikh Tabarsi (shia commentator)interprets the Quranic verse 34:51 concerning the fate of the army of the sufyani, referring to it as the army of the desert of bayda, where the earth will swallow them.https://www.al-islam.org/mahdi-quran-according-shiite-quran-commentators- vasran-toussi/chapter-3-mahdi-classical-and-modern#9-quran-34:51 Abu Hurayrah has narrated that the Prophet said: > A man will emerge from the depths of Damascus. He will be called Sufyani. > Most of those who follow him will be from the tribe of Kalb. He will kill by > ripping the stomachs of women and even kill the children. A man from my > family will appear in the Haram, the news of his advent will reach the > Sufyani and he will send to him one of his armies. He (referring to the > Mahdi) will defeat them. They will then travel with whoever remains until > they come to a desert and they will be swallowed. None will be saved except > the one who had informed the others about them. (Mustadrak Al-Hakim) The Sufyani will be followed, for the most part, by the tribe of Banu Kalb, and will have fought with anyone daring to oppose him. Injustice will rule the day and his disregard for life will reach the point where defenseless women will be ripped open and innocent children slain unmercifully. The tribe of Qays will rise up against him, however, they will not succeed, and he will slaughter all of them. The Sufyani's army will go to Kufa; a city in Iraq, and from there he will launch an attack against the Khurasan. At the Gate of Istakhr, Shu'ayb bin Salih and the Hashimites will join forces and engage the army of the Sufyani. The battle will be extremely fierce with a tremendous loss of life and the army of the Sufyani will suffer a temporary defeat. It is at this time that a yearning for the Mahdi's appearance is on the lips of everyone. The army of the Sufyani will march from the direction of Iraq to seize the Mahdi, however, when they reach the desert near Dhi Hulayfah the ground will swallow them up. However, two will escape to convey the news but even when he learns of the occurrence he will not be deterred. There will be some people from the Quraysh who manage to escape from him to Constantinople, which will be at that time under the control of the Non-Muslims. When the Sufyani asks for their return they will be returned whereupon not only the escapees' throats will be slit but those like them. Khalid bin Ma'dan said: > The Sufyani will emerge with three staffs in his hand. Anyone whom he > strikes with them will die. (Nu'aym bin Hammad) The Sufyani is a man whose trial involves his person, his power, his speed and his fighting. One of his wonders consists of his staffs, which kill anyone he strikes with them. The hadith about the Sufyani confirms that he is a tyrant who will spread corruption and crime in the Earth immediately before the appearance of the Mahdi. ==History== At least nine figures were revolted in Levant using Sufyani as their title between 749 and 1413 AD. The first one was Ziad ibn Abdollah ibn Yazid ibn Muawiah ibn Abi Sufyan who revolted against Abbasids. The second Sufyani revolted in 754 and then Abu Harb al-Muburqa about one hundred years later. In 1413, someone used this title and revolted against Mamluk Sultanate. He tried to exactly follow the Hadiths, but Mamluks suppressed and killed him. ==See also== * Khasf al-Bayda' * Abu Muhammad al- Sufyani * Al-Mubarqa * Mahdi * Masih ad-Dajjal * Islamic eschatology * Nafs-e- Zakiyyah (Pure soul) * Reappearance of Muhammad al-Mahdi * Signs of the reappearance of Muhammad al-Mahdi ==FootnotesReferences== * ==External links== * Do we believe in the Sufyani who will allegedly come before the Dajjal?

As a child and teenager, he studied the piano and violin, sang in church choirs, played in jazz and rock bands, and took courses with Ronald Gibson and Peggie Sampson at the University of Manitoba. He studied composition at Indiana University where he graduated with a bachelors in music in 1964. Between 1968-70 he led and composed for a 'third stream' jazz ensemble and attended Pierre Boulez's 1969 conducting class in Switzerland. In 1959 he became organist-choirmaster at Wesley United Church, Winnipeg where he served for many years. He became the music director at the Manitoba Theatre Centre in 1964 and from 1966-1970 he worked as a composer, arranger, and conductor for CBC Radio and television. In 1970 he began to work as a freelance composer and arranger, and in 1977 he moved to Toronto where he still resides. He was president of the Canadian League of Composers 1979-82 and began to sit on the board of directors of SOCAN in 1997. He was honored with an honorary doctorate from the University of Manitoba in 2007. In 2014, he was named a Member of the Order of Canada. ==Compositions== As a composer, Davies's music is fundamentally optimistic in disposition which critics have often described as \\"happy\\", \\"cheerful\\", and \\"uplifting\\". Rhythmically vigorous, well orchestrated, and readily accessible, his music strives for simplicity and elegance while still using a wide range of historical and contemporary musical forms and techniques such as twelve- tone, aleatoric, jazz, and popular music elements. A pragmatist, Davies has criticized the trend within classical composition to reject popular music forms. He believes it is socially irresponsible to pursue the clever or different merely for the sake of academic approval. Davies says that \\"artists must have utility in the community, and their music must embody melodies that are memorable, something that is cherishable.\\" Davies first came to public attention for his Mennonite Piano Concerto which was commissioned by the B.B. Fast Foundation. The concerto premiered on 27 October 1975 by the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Bill Baerg with pianist Irmgard Baerg. The work was received with high praise and has since been recorded several times, including a 1983 recording with Baerg and the London Symphony Orchestra. He has since composed a variety of compositions in several genres including symphonic works, chamber music, film and television scores, operas, musical theater, and jazz music among others. He has written over 600 songs for the CTV children's series Let's Go and Rockets. His other compositions for stage, television, and film include, The Last Winter (1990), The Nutcracker Prince (1990), Tooth Fairy, Where Are You?, The Nature of Things (2002), For the Moment (1994), the music for the 1999 Pan American Games, and the musical The Importance of Being Ernest which was performed for the Stratford Festival in 2005. He has written music for several commissions including Pulsations (1978) for the CBC; Anerca (1969) for the Contemporary Dancers; Animal Capers (1983) for the Famous People Players; The Magic Trumpet (1969) and Reginald the Robot (1971) for the Manitoba Theatre Centre; Fun For Four (1980) for the Orford String Quartet; The Big Top (1985) for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet; numerous works for the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra including Celebrations (1969), From Harmony (1968), A Short Symphony (1974), and the Jazz Piano Concerto (2001); Jazz Concerto for Organ and Orchestra (2000) for Wayne Marshall; and Yukon Scenes (1985/1997) for the Yukon Arts Council among others. The Musical Circus was commissioned by Soundstage Canada in 1981, which performed the work in Eastern Europe. Perhaps his most highly regarded work is his oratorio Revelation which uses texts from the Bible's Book of Revelation. It premiered in February 1996 by the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra and the Mennonite Oratorio Choir under Bramwell Tovey and has subsequently been performed in Vancouver, Ottawa, and Hamilton. This was followed in 2007 by the opera Transit of Venus, commissioned by Manitoba Opera. In 2008, Davies completed a tuba concerto entitled \\"Concerto for Tubameister\\" which received its piano premier in Vancouver, BC on 26 September 2008 performed by J.c. Sherman, for whom the work was composed. The work received its orchestra premiere with the Winnipeg Symphony, Chris Lee, soloist, in January, 2009. Sherman gave the US piano premier in 2010, and the US orchestra premier on 5 October 2014 with the Olympia Symphony. In 2002, Davies won a Gemini Award for Honour Before Glory. ==References== *Manitoba Opera page on Davies' Transit of Venus, accessed 5 February 2010 *Uptown Magazine review of Transit of Venus, accessed 5 February 2010 ==External links== *The Canadian Encyclopedia biographical page, accessed 5 February 2010 *Composer's own website, accessed 5 February 2010 *Victor Davies fonds (R15446) at Library and Archives Canada Category:1939 births Category:Canadian classical composers Category:Canadian opera composers Category:Living people Category:Canadian male classical composers Category:Male opera composers Category:Members of the Order of Canada Category:Musicians from Winnipeg ","title":"Victor Davies"},{"id":"19254000","text":"Slime & Reason is the sixth studio album of original material by Roots Manuva.

It was a low-wing cantilever monoplane of conventional design with fixed, tailskid undercarriage, and side-by-side seating for two within an enclosed cockpit. Construction throughout was of wood, with the fuselage built using a new semi-monocoque technique which Klemm patented. Plans to produce the design in series were abandoned with the outbreak of the Second World War. ==Development== In January 1937 Major Werner Junck, chief of the LC II, the technical wing of the Reichsluftfahrtministerium responsible for the development of new aircraft, informed various minor aircraft manufacturers such as Bücker, Fieseler, Gothaer Waggonfabrik, Flugzeugwerke Halle and Klemm that they would not get any contracts for the development of military aircraft. He therefore advised them to concentrate in the development of a Volksflugzeug or a small twin-engined plane. As a result, Klemm developed the Kl 105, while the other companies produced the Fi 253, the Si 202, the Bü 180 and the Go 150.Luftarchiv – Fieseler Fi 253 ==SpecificationsReferences== ;Notes ;Bibliography * * * Category:1930s German sport aircraft Category:Klemm aircraft Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Low- wing aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1938 ","title":"Klemm Kl 105"},{"id":"19254131","text":"Adrian Hernandez (born March 25, 1975) is a former Major League Baseball pitcher who played for the New York Yankees and Milwaukee Brewers. ==Baseball careerNew York Yankees=== Hernandez was signed by the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent on June 2, , to a four-year, $4 million contract.\\"Hernandez pitches in as Brewer\\" He was instantly dubbed the nickname \\"El Duquecito\\" due to the similar pitching style of fellow Cuban Orlando Hernández. Hernández flew through the Yankees minor league organization in 2000 after going 8–2, with a 3.89 earned run average and 86 strikeouts in 12 games, all starts. Hernandez made his major league debut on April 21, , versus the Boston Red Sox, pitching three innings allowing one earned run on two hits. He was called up and sent down to the minors on three occasions in 2001 and finished the season, going 0–3 in six games (three starts), with 10 strikeouts and a 3.68 ERA. In , Hernandez struggled in both the majors and the minors. He finished the season with a 12.00 ERA in two games in the majors. After spending the entire season in the minors he was granted free agency by the Yankees on October 15, 2003. ===Milwaukee Brewers=== On October 15, , Hernandez signed with the Milwaukee Brewers. After making five relief appearances for the Brewers, he made his first start with the team on May 8, 2004. Despite not allowing any hits, he walked seven batters and gave up three runs in 4.1 innings. On May 11, 2004, he was designated for assignment by the Brewers and was optioned to the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians. In the minors, he struggled, going 0–8 leading to the end of his career. ==See also== *List of baseball players who defected from Cuba ==References , or Cuban-Play (Series Nacionales), or Pelota Binaria (Venezuelan Winter League) Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Cardenales de Lara players Category:Columbus Clippers players Category:Defecting Cuban baseball players Category:Cuban baseball players Category:Indianapolis Indians players Category:Industriales de La Habana players Category:Major League Baseball players from Cuba Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Mexican League baseball pitchers Category:Milwaukee Brewers players Category:New York Yankees players Category:Norwich Navigators players Category:Sportspeople from Havana Category:Tampa Yankees players Category:Trenton Thunder players Category:Vaqueros Laguna players ","title":"Adrián Hernández (baseball)"},{"id":"19254153","text":"The West Link () is a railway tunnel under construction under central Gothenburg. The purpose of the project is to increase capacity and reduce travel times on the Gothenburg network by changing the Gothenburg Central Station from a terminus to an underground transit station. Two new underground stations, Haga and Korsvägen, will also be built. Of the 1.02 million people (2018) who live in Greater Gothenburg (1.7 million in Västra Götaland County), 450,000 people live outside the Gothenburg municipality. https://www.scb.se/hitta-statistik/statistik-efter- amne/befolkning/befolkningens-sammansattning/befolkningsstatistik/pong/tabell- och-diagram/kvartals--och-halvarsstatistik--kommun-lan-och- riket/kvartal-1-2018// Approximately 175,000 people in the region commute to or from Gothenburg Municipality daily. The majority of these people use cars for transportation and the roads in the region are overloaded. Better rail communications to different parts of Greater Gothenburg and better connections to current public transport networks would improve the situation. There is a political wish to reduce car dependency and increase public transport usage. Significant sums of money have been – and are being – invested in rail infrastructure in the other Swedish urban areas such as the Stockholm and Malmö regions (over 40 bn SEK each during 1990-2010). Rail investment in the greater Gothenburg area has not kept up with these other urban areas. The largest improvement according to the proposed plan would be for commuters from places along the railways from Kungsbacka/Borås and who work or study near Haga station, where a large part of the University of Gothenburg is located. 15 minutes could be saved per journey. Time would be also saved on other journeys, for example around 5 minutes from Alingsås to Sahlgrenska or Chalmers. In addition to this, it would allow high-speed trains from Stockholm to serve destinations such as Kungsbacka, Varberg, Falkenberg etc. via Gothenburg Central station without turning there. The main reason to build the tunnel is to increase capacity. The Gothenburg Central Station has no capacity for more trains in rush hours, which obstructs the wish to increase train traffic and build a new railway to Borås, the second largest city in the province, which has dense bus traffic to Gothenburg. == History  Planning process === As early as the 1950s there were plans for a tunnel under the inner city for railbound vehicles, then for trams. The plans were abandoned because of the cost. The city has to finance tramways, while the government finances railways. The planning process has taken a long time, being included in preliminary city plans in the mid 90s under the project name \\"Centrumtunneln\\". A feasibility study was conducted in 2001-2002 by Banverket in cooperation with Västra Götalandsregionen, Västtrafik, Göteborgsregionen, and the city of Gothenburg. Similar rail tunnel projects have already been implemented in Malmö and in Stockholm. Västlänken is not part of the Trafikverket Future plan (swe: Framtidsplan) 2004-2015, nor the alternative plan. Construction could start earlier since the Västra Götaland Regional Council is willing to invest money in the project. === Routes === Banverket investigated three routes for Västlänken, including new stations along the routes in the city centre. The route alternatives were named after the proposed new stations: Haga-Korsvägen, Haga-Chalmers, and Korsvägen. In addition to these underground alternatives, an expansion of the current rail network to the south, with a larger terminus station, was also investigated, named Förstärkningsalternativet ().  Decision  On December 19, 2007, Banverket chose the Haga-Korsvägen alternative as it best fulfilled the goals for the expansion. A majority of other governmental bodies to which the proposed routes were referred for consideration also agreed on that opinion. == Construction == The construction cost for the project is estimated at SEK 14.5 billion, using a price index of January 1, 2007. By 2012 the estimated cost had increased to 20 billion. The cost of the project will be partially financed by road tolls levied on vehicles entering and leaving central Gothenburg, as well as on those simply passing by the city on the major thoroughfares. The official construction start ceremony took place on 30 May 2018.Första spadtaget för Västlänken == Art == art on building fence Trafikverket (the Swedish Department of Transportation) are hosting a public art project from 2018 through 2026 to make the building fences less of a negative intrusion in the city.https://www.trafikverket.se/contentassets/5d3919bd8e2b4360819605262fd65fe4/information_konst- pa-byggplanken_210x210_181031.pdfhttps://www.gp.se/kultur/kultur/recension- planksidan-konsten-på-västlänkens-byggplank-1.15856422 There are 8 kilometers of building fences during the construction period, 2,8 to 4 meters high.https://www.gp.se/kultur/kultur/så-ska-åtta-kilometer-västlänksplank- livas-upp-1.12710063 Trafikverket publicly asked artists to submit ideas and presentations of artworks that could be part of the project.https://www.goteborgdirekt.se/nyheter/trafikverket-soker-konstnarer- till-vastlankens-plank/repsaq!VqxZ4HeYycz3Ajn84zGlw/ The first 2 artworks were created in 2018.https://ng.se/artiklar/linneplatsen-ska-prydas-med-konstverk The big start was in 2019.https://www.gp.se/kultur/kultur/recension- planksidan-konsten-på-västlänkens-byggplank-1.15856422 There are or will be artworks in Centralen, Kanaltorget, Sankt Eriksgatan, Västa Sjöfarten, Packhusplatsen, Skeppsbron, Södra Hamngatan, Rosenlund, Haga, Pustervik, Linnéplatsen, och Korsvägen.https://www.trafikverket.se/contentassets/5d3919bd8e2b4360819605262fd65fe4/information_konst- pa-byggplanken_210x210_181031.pdf The project is called Planksidan. == See also == *City Tunnel, Malmö *Citybanan, Stockholm *Gothenburg quadricentennial jubilee == References == Category:Railway lines in Sweden Category:Railway tunnels in Sweden Category:Transport in Gothenburg Category:Proposed tunnels in Sweden Category:Proposed public transport in Sweden Category:Proposed rail infrastructure in Sweden Category:Proposed railway tunnels in Europe Category:West Coast Line (Sweden) Category:Underground commuter rail Category:2025 in rail transport ","title":"West Link"},{"id":"19254206","text":"Qiyaməddinli (also, Kiyəməddinli, Kiamadani, Kiyamadinli, and Kiyamandynly) is a village and municipality in the Aghjabadi Rayon of Azerbaijan. == References == * Category:Populated places in Aghjabadi District ","title":"Qiyaməddinli"},{"id":"19254220","text":"The Government of National Unity, also known as the \\"grand coalition cabinet,\\" was a designation for the coalition government in Kenya from April 2008 to April 2013.

The main game of the Series matched the English national cricket team against an all-star team from the Caribbean, called the Stanford Superstars. The prize money awarded in the tournament was winner- take-all; the players for the winning team in the yearly game took home $20 million prize money, and the losing players did not earn anything. The domestic West Indies and England Twenty20 champions competed for the Champions Cup, as well as playing in a series of other exhibition matches with the Superstars and England. The tournament collapsed following the arrest (and subsequent conviction) of Allen Stanford for an $8 billion fraud, part of which funded the prize money for the Super Series. ==History== Allen Stanford proposed emphasizing Twenty20 cricket as a way to promote cricket in the West Indies. He created the Stanford 20/20, a yearly tournament featuring teams from the island nations that made up the West Indies. From the first edition of his tournament in 2006, he aimed to have the best players from his tournament play as a team against an international team. Initially, South Africa had been planned to play against the Stanford team for a prize of US$5 million, but that effort fell through after scheduling conflicts with the WICB. In 2008, Stanford looked to expand the tournament and decided once again to feature a high-stakes game featuring the best players in the West Indies versus an international team. Stanford initially wished to invite Sri Lanka, India, Australia and South Africa to come and play a single-elimination tournament in Antigua, with the winner facing his all-star team. However, due to contractual issues with the ICC and ESPN-Star and scheduling constraints that tournament was infeasible. Instead, Stanford invited the winners of the World Twenty20, India, to play for a prize of US$5 million (later US$10 million) and planned to ask Australia to come as a back-up should India decline or be unavailable. India, who were in the process of launching the highly successful first year of their domestic Twenty20 league, the Indian Premier League, declined as they did not want to be involved in a privately funded programme. When that deal fell through, Stanford increased the prize money to US$20 million and aimed to get either England or Australia involved. After meeting with the ECB from April through June, Stanford finally signed a five-year deal with the England and Wales Cricket Board to host a series of US$20 million, winner-take-all matches, worth $100 million in total. In addition, the deal included an annual Twenty20 quadrangular involving England (as hosts), West Indies and two invitational teams with a prize of US$9.5 million. ==Prize money== The final $20 million prize was split as follows: each of the 11 players on the winning team who played in the championship game would take home $1 million. Another $1 million would be split amongst the players who were selected for the winning team, but did not play in the championship game; $1 million would go to the management team and the remaining $7 million would be split between the English Cricket Board and the West Indies Cricket Board.\\"Stanford Super Series: England cricketers will go in to bat for $1m apiece\\", Valentine Low, The Times, 10 September 2008 == Competitors == The Stanford Superstars and an England XI were scheduled to compete in the first five tournaments. Alongside them were the champions of the Stanford 20/20 in the West Indies and the champions of the Twenty20 Cup in England. These were Trinidad and Tobago and Middlesex Crusaders. The two domestic champions competed for the Champions Cup whilst Stanford Superstars and England contested the Final, labelled the 20/20 For 20 match. == Reception == The matches were well attended, but the press (especially the British contingent) was mainly very sceptical. \\"Of all the short-form matches currently being organised,\\" wrote Stephen Brenkley on 26 October, \\"the conclusion is easily reached that Stanford Superstars v England is the most offensive. It has no context as a proper sporting competition, it is neither country versus country, club versus club or invitation XI versus invitation XI. It is a rococo hybrid. It has money, but nothing else going for it.\\"Brenkley 2008. It has since been alleged that Stanford's creation of the tournament was primarily a method to launder his income from the fraudulent businesses schemes for which he is now serving a penal sentence in the U.S.A. ==Dissolution== Following the first year of the series, the future of the competition was put in doubt after Stanford disbanded his team of 12 'Stanford Legends' who had been acting as ambassadors for the tournament.Stanford legends given the chop, Cricinfo, 17 December 2008 In the wake of fraud charges made against Stanford, the ECB terminated all contracts with Stanford in February 2009, meaning that the England cricket team took no further part in Stanford organised matches.ECB severs all ties with Stanford, BBC Sport, 20 February 2009.

Beta Doradus is a Cepheid variable that regularly changes magnitude from a low of 4.08 to a high of 3.46 over a period of 9.842 days. The light curve of this magnitude change follows a regular saw-tooth pattern. During each radial pulsation cycle, the radius of the star varies by ±3.9 times the Sun's radius around a mean of 67.8. Its spectral type and luminosity class are likewise variable, from F-type to G-type and from a supergiant to a bright giant. Far ultraviolet emissions have been detected from this star with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer, while X-ray emissions were detected with the XMM-Newton space telescope. The X-ray luminosity is about 1 × 1029 erg/s and the emission varies with the pulsation period, suggesting a connection with the pulsation process.

In 1977 the band had a number three hit single in Australia with \\"You've Gotta Get Up and Dance\\". ==HistoryBeginnings and Australian success=== Founded in early 1974, by Liverpool tenor-saxophonist, Albie Donnelly (born Albert Edward Donnelly, 12 August 1947, Huyton, Liverpool), and drummer Dave Irving (born David Geddes Irving, 18 November 1946, Crosby, Liverpool) after they had both left the 'In Crowd' cabaret band, Supercharge soon built up quite a cult following in Liverpool at 'The Sportsman', a popular city-centre pub on Sunday and later Monday nights and also at the 'Dove and Olive' at Speke. Original members included Donnelly (bandleader, vocalist, and tenor saxophonist), Ozzie Yue (guitar/vocals) (born Austin J Yue, 12 August 1947, Liverpool), Allen 'Gaz' Gaskell (tenor sax, guitar, harmonica, and vocals), Alan Peters (trumpet), Bob Robertson (baritone sax), Pete Newton (bass guitar), Tony Dunmore (bass) and Dave Irving (drums). Supercharge also quickly established themselves as a major player on the UK college / university circuit. Their first album Between Music and Madness, which was locally produced, soon followed. Around 1975, in an attempt to attract a major record label offer, Supercharge began to gig regularly on the London live circuit at venues such as the Hope and Anchor, Islington, the Nashville Rooms, and the Marquee Club. As a result, Supercharge were soon signed by Virgin Records, and with the company's new record producer, Robert \\"Mutt\\" Lange, they had a number three hit in Australia with their 1976 single \\"You've Gotta Get Up and Dance\\". Personnel on these recordings also included organist Iain Bradshaw. It was also in Australia that their first album, Local Lads Make Good went gold - resulting in a number of successful major tours with a version of the band that included Les Karski on guitar. These live UK gigs often featured celebrated live sound engineer Chrys Lindop, and included the infamous comedy track 'She Moved The Dishes First', which Donnelly claims they wrote so they could mess about a bit while the band were replacing broken guitar strings. This track also achieved notoriety when it was picked up and played regularly by Radio Caroline. Meanwhile, back in the UK, although their record sales were disappointing, Supercharge still managed to achieve a reputation as one of the UK's best live bands. This included Supercharge's opening set for Queen at the 1976 Hyde Park Festival. However, it was becoming clear to Donnelly that Virgin did not really know what to do with them, and they eventually parted company sometime during the punk era. Despite their reputation as a killer band live, Richard Branson decided that after two albums without major success that he would only offer Donnelly / Karski a continuous deal. The rest of the band became redundant, and ironically months later the 'Local lads' album went gold in Australia. However, the deed had been done, and Donnelly resorted to taking a scratch band to do the hit tour in Australia much to the chagrin of the original guys who had put all the hard studio and roadwork in to get the band where it was. ===Success in Europe=== The next chapter in Supercharge's history was the invasion of Europe, which began at the end of the 1970s-early 1980s. By now the band also featured Andy Parker on vocals and saxophone. Other members (at one time or another) included Mike Snow - trumpet; Dick Hansen - trumpet; John Burke - trumpet Tony Winders - guitar; Phil Loughran - guitar; Tony Judge - piano; Steve Snow - trombone; Paul Ambrosius - bass/vocals; Dave Dover - bass; Kenny Shearer - bass; Dave 'The Frug' Hormbrey - drums; Tony Lunney - drums. Albums during this early period included, Now Jump, and Kingsize. In late 1983, the Liverpool band Juke (Allen 'Gaz' Gaskell - tenor saxophone, guitar, harmonica, bass, vocals; Mickey Kearns - baritone sax; guitar; vocals; Bob Hardy - bandleader, keyboards, guitar, vocals; Dave Sheppley - guitar, bass, vocals; Paddy Chambers - guitar, vocals; Steve Grant - drums, vocal) struck a deal with Donnelly and his then manager, \\"Memo\\" Rhein, to work together for the next twelve months as Supercharge '84. This version of the band was so successful that at the end of 1984, Donnelly and Rhein persuaded them to stay on for a further five months. During the time that Juke and Donnelly were together they managed to clock up well over 200 gigs. Many of these were for Europe's 'Jet-Set', and included the wedding of Tina Onassis (which resulted in the 1984 album Groovers In Paris - which is still Supercharge's top selling rhythm and blues album). Gigs also included parties for Gunter Sachs at the Dracula' Club in St. Moritz; and a New Year's Eve party in Marbella for Adnan Khashoggi. ===Mid 1980s=== The next version of Supercharge began performing live in mid-1985, and moved away from the successful horn driven 'Rhythm and Blues-Maximum Show' format of Supercharge '84, and instead featured material written mainly by guitarist/vocalist Colin Frost and pianist Tony Judge. This version of the band also included bassist Brendan O'Connor. In 1986/7, guitarist Dave Shepley (who had been a member of Juke and had switched to bass in Supercharge '84) and guitarist/vocalist John \\"Fat Ted\\" Lewis, helped Donnelly to once again convert Supercharge into a major player on the late 1980s and early 1990s European Jazz and Rhythm and Blues live-scene. This powerhouse rhythm and blues version of Supercharge (which at various times included: Andy Parker - vocal and tenor saxophone; Steve Snow - trombone; Dick Hansen - trumpet Tony Peers - trumpet; Paul Latham - trombone; Graham Price - bass; John \\"Fat Ted\\" Lewis - guitar and vocal; Roy \\"The Boy\\" Herrington - guitar; Dave Sheppley- guitar; Lenni Zaksen - tenor saxophone; Terry Kennaugh - guitar; Mal Bowers - keyboards; Paul Hetherington - bass; Tony Lunney - drums) quickly began to pick up a number of major tours with artists such as Chuck Berry and B.B. King, and this soon took the band back to stadiums and bigger concert hall gigs, where they still perform. Nashville keyboard-player and vocalist Greg Barrett joined in the late 1980s and demonstrated a more soulful side of Supercharge. This version of the band usually included Greg Barrett - keyboards, vocal; Albie Donnelly - tenor saxophone; Paul Owens - baritone saxophone; Dick Hansen - trumpet; Roy \\"The Boy\\" Herrington - guitar; Wolfgang \\"Bolle\\" Diekmann - bass; Tony Lunney - drums. Donnelly also began experimenting with smaller outfits around this time, the most popular being Albie Donnelly's Big Three which included Gregory Gaynair on piano and Wolfgang Diekmann on bass. ===From 2000 to date === From 2000 to date, Donnelly is still fronting a R&B; band - with a version of Supercharge that now consists mainly of a number of top German R&B; musicians, including Juergen Wieching on saxophone, and Mike Rafalczyk on trombone and Wolfgang Diekmann on bass.. Donnelly also featured on a CD, Return Cargo. In addition to Supercharge regulars, the recording also features the original Supercharge drummer, Dave Irving. Over the years Donnelly has been an official endorser for a number of saxophone companies, including Keilwerth and Yamaha; he has also provided a great deal of regular work for a number of Liverpool's top musicians. Since 2010 the band line-up has been: Albie Donnelly (alto and tenor saxophones, lead vocals), Roy Herrington (guitar, vocals), Jürgen Wieching (baritone and alto saxophones), Mike Rafalcyk (trombone, harmonica), Sascha Kühn (keyboards), Wolfgang Diekmann (bass) and Uwe Petersen (drums); with Ozzie Yue (guitars), Lance Donnelly (drums), Neil Partington (guitars) and Mark Phillips (guitars).

U.S. banking regulation addresses privacy, disclosure, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-usury lending, and the promotion of lending to lower-income populations. Some individual cities also enact their own financial regulation laws (for example, defining what constitutes usurious lending). ==Regulatory Authority== A bank's primary federal regulator could be the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Within the Federal Reserve System are 12 districts centered around 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, each of which carries out the Federal Reserve Board's regulatory responsibilities in its respective district. Credit unions are subject to most bank regulations and are supervised by the National Credit Union Administration. The Financial Institutions Regulatory and Interest Rate Control Act of 1978 established the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) with uniform principles, standards, and report forms for the other agencies. State regulation of state-chartered banks and certain non-bank affiliates of federally chartered banks applies in addition to federal regulation. State- chartered banks are subject to the regulation of the state regulatory agency of the state in which they were chartered. For example, a California state bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System would be regulated by both the California Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC. Likewise, a Nevada state bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System would be jointly regulated by the Nevada Division of Financial Institutions and the Federal Reserve. By statute, and in accordance with judicial interpretation of statutes and the United States Constitution, federal banking statutes (and the regulations and other guidance issued by federal banking regulatory agencies) often preempt state laws regulating certain activities of nationally chartered banking institutions and their subsidiaries. Specific exceptions to the general rule of federal preemption exist such as some contract law, escheat law, and insurance law. One example is the Office of Thrift Supervision preempting federal savings associations from certain state laws.Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, Section 550.136(a) \\"...OTS occupies the field of the regulation of the fiduciary activities of Federal savings associations...Accordingly, Federal savings associations may exercise fiduciary powers as authorized under Federal law, including this part, without regard to State laws that purport to regulate or otherwise affect their fiduciary activities, except to the extent provided in 12 U.S.C. § 1464(n)...or in paragraph (c) of this section.\\" 12 U.S.C. § 1464(n) authorizes fiduciary activities for federal savings associations, and specifies certain state law requirements that are applicable to federal savings associations. 12 C.F.R. §550.136(c) lists six types of state laws that, in certain specified circumstances, are not preempted with respect to federal savings associations. In the Banking, and Financial services industry, two significant regulators are the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ==Privacy== Regulation P governs the use of a customer's private data. Banks and other financial institutions must inform a consumer of their policy regarding personal information, and must provide an \\"opt-out\\" before disclosing data to a non-affiliated third party. The regulation was enacted in 1999. Concerning know your customer rules and Bank Secrecy Act regulations, financial institutions are encouraged to keep track of customers employment status and other business dealings, including whether or not the financial activity of customers are consistent with their business activities, and report on customers' suspect activities to the government. ==Anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism== At its core, financial transparency requires financial institutions to implement certain basic controls: * they must know who their customers are (so-called know your customer rules); * they must understand their customers' normal and expected transactions; * and they must keep the necessary records and make the necessary reports on their customers. The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (BSA), also known as the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act, is a U.S. law requiring financial institutions in the United States to assist U.S. government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering. Specifically, the act requires financial institutions to keep records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, file reports of cash transactions exceeding $10,000 (daily aggregate amount), and to report suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion or other criminal activities. Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows financial institutions to place limits on new accounts until the account holder's identity has been verified. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions apply to all U.S. entities including banks. The FFIEC provides guidelines to financial regulators for verifying compliance with the sanctions. ==Community reinvestment== The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 requires insured depository institutions to reinvest in the communities they serve. There should be an emphasis on low-income and moderate-income (LMI) census tracts and individuals. Insured depository institutions must display a CRA notice, and each branch must have a current CRA public file or access to it via the company's intranet, and must provide the information in person or by mail. ==Deposit account regulationDeposit insurance=== The United States was the second country (after Czechoslovakia)Padoan, Brenton, Boyd: \\"The Structural Foundations of International Finance: Problems of Growth and Stability\\", Edward Elgar Publishing, 2003, p. 117 to officially enact deposit insurance to protect depositors from losses by insolvent banks. In 1933 the Glass–Steagall Act established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to insure deposits at commercial banks. In 1970 Congress established a separate fund for credit unions, the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. The NCUSIF insures all federally chartered credit unions and many state- chartered credit unions (98% as of 2009). Some others are insured by the private guaranty corporation American Share Insurance (156 as of 2009). In 1978 foreign banks operating in the United States were required to hold the same level of reserves under the specifications of the International Banking Act. In 1934, Congress created the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation to insure savings and loan deposits. In the 1980s, during the savings and loan crisis, the FSLIC became insolvent and was abolished; its responsibility was transferred to the FDIC. Some financial institutions offer insurance in excess of FDIC or NCUA limits. For example, the Depositors Insurance Fund insures excess deposits at Massachusetts-chartered savings banks. American Share Insurance provides excess share insurance at participating credit unions. ===Consumer protection=== The Truth in Savings Act (TISA), implemented by Regulation DD, established uniformity in disclosing terms and conditions regarding interest and fees when giving out information and when opening a new savings account. On passing the law in 1991, Congress noted it would help promote economic stability, competition between depository institutions, and allow the consumer to make informed decisions. The Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFAA) of 1987, implemented by Regulation CC, defines when standard holds and exception holds can be placed on checks deposited to checking accounts, and the maximum length of time the money can be held. A bank's hold policy can be less stringent than the guidelines provided, but it cannot exceed the guidelines. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978, implemented by Regulation E, established the rights and liabilities of consumers as well as the responsibilities of all participants in electronic funds transfer activities. ===Withdrawal limits and reserve requirements=== *Establishes reserve requirement guidelines *Regulates certain early withdrawals from certificate of deposit accounts *Defines what qualifies as DDA/NOW accounts. See Regulation Q for eligibility rules for interest-bearing checking accounts *Defines limitations on certain withdrawals on savings and money market accounts **Unlimited transfers or withdrawals if made in person, by ATM, by mail, or by messenger **In all other instances, there is a limit of six transfers or withdrawals. No more than three of these transactions may be made payable to a third party (by check, draft, point-of-sale, etc.) **Some banks will charge a fee with each excess transaction **Bank must close accounts where this transaction limit is constantly exceeded ===Interest on demand deposits=== Until 2011, Regulation Q prohibited banks from paying interest on demand deposit accounts. A \\"demand deposit\\" account includes many, but not all checking accounts, and does not include Negotiable Order of Withdrawal accounts (NOW accounts). ==Lending regulationConsumer protection=== The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) of 1975, implemented by Regulation C, requires financial institutions to maintain and annually disclose data about home purchases, home purchase pre-approvals, home improvement, and refinance applications involving one- to four-unit and multifamily dwellings. It also requires branches and loan centers to display a HMDA poster. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) of 1974, implemented by Regulation B, requires creditors which regularly extend credit to customers—including banks, retailers, finance companies, and bank-card companies—to evaluate candidates on creditworthiness alone, rather than other factors such as race, color, religion, national origin, or sex. Discrimination based on marital status, receipt of public assistance, and age is generally prohibited (with exceptions), as is discrimination based on a consumer's good- faith exercise of his or her credit-protection rights. The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) of 1968, implemented by Regulation Z, promotes the informed use of consumer credit by standardizing the disclosure of interest rates and other costs associated with borrowing. TILA also gives consumers the right to cancel certain credit transactions involving a lien on the consumer's principal dwelling, regulates certain credit-card practices, and provides a means of resolving credit-billing disputes. Debt collection The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) of 1970 regulates the collection, sharing, and use of customer-credit information. The act allows consumers to obtain a copy of their credit report from credit bureaus that hold information on them, provides for consumers to dispute negative information held and sets time limits, after which negative information is suppressed. It requires that consumers be informed when negative information is added to their credit records, and when adverse action is taken based on a credit report. Credit cards Provisions addressing credit-card practices aim to enhance protections for consumers who use credit cards and improve credit-card disclosure under the Truth in Lending Act: * Banks would be prohibited from increasing the rate on a pre-existing credit card balance (except under limited circumstances) and must allow the consumer to pay off that balance over a reasonable period of time * Banks would be prohibited from applying payments in excess of the minimum in a manner that maximizes interest charges * Banks would be required to give consumers the full benefit of discounted promotional rates on credit cards by applying payments in excess of the minimum to any higher-rate balances first, and by providing a grace period for purchases where the consumer is otherwise eligible * Banks would be prohibited from imposing interest charges using the \\"two-cycle\\" method, which computes interest on balances on days in billing cycles preceding the most recent billing cycle * Banks would be required to provide consumers a reasonable amount of time to make paymentsBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System: \\"Press Release--Federal Reserve proposes rules to prohibit unfair practices regarding credit cards and overdraft services--May 2, 2008\\" ===Lending limits=== Lending-limit regulations restrict the total amount of loans and credits that a bank may extend to a single borrower. This restriction is usually stated as a percentage of the bank's capital or assets. For example, a national bank generally must limit its total outstanding loans and credits to any single borrower to no more than 15% of the bank's total capital and surplus. Some state banking regulations also contain similar lending limits applicable to state-chartered banks. Both federal and state laws generally allow for a higher lending limit (up to 25% of capital and surplus for national banks) when the portion of the credit that exceeds the initial lending limit is fully secured. Loans to Insiders (Regulation O) establishes various quantitative and qualitative limits and reporting requirements on extensions of credit made by a bank to its \\"insiders\\" or the insiders of the bank's affiliates. The term \\"insiders\\" includes executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and the related interests of such parties. ==Central banking regulation== Extensions of Credit by Federal Reserve Banks (Regulation A) establishes rules regarding discount window lending, the extension of credit by the Federal Reserve Bank to banks and other institutions. The Federal Reserve Board made significant amendments to Regulation A in 2003, including amendments to price certain discount-window lending at above-market rates and to restrict borrowing to banks in generally sound condition. In amending the regulation, the Federal Reserve Board noted that many banks had expressed their unwillingness to use discount-window borrowing because their use of such a funding source was interpreted as sign of the bank's financial weakness or distress. The Federal Reserve Board indicated its hope that the 2003 amendments would make discount window lending a more attractive funding option to banks. ==Regulation of bank affiliates and holding companies== Transactions Between Member Banks and Their Affiliates (Regulation W) regulates transactions, such as loans and asset purchases between banks and their affiliates. The term \\"affiliate\\" is broadly defined and includes parent companies, companies that share a parent company with the bank, companies that are under other types of common control with the bank (e.g. by a trust), companies with interlocking directors (a majority of directors, trustees, etc. are the same as a majority of the bank's), subsidiaries, and certain other types of companies. When passed September 18, 1950 Regulation W included a prohibition on installment purchases exceeding 21 months, which was shortened to 15 months on October 16 of the same year. ==2018 deregulation announcement== In January 2018, a spokesperson for the Federal Reserve Board chief of supervision said that existing banking sector regulations were too tough and standardized, and could be relaxed and customized in order to promote commercial bank lending, investment, and stock market trading. Randal Quarles, the Vice Chairman for Bank Supervision, said he was planning several imminent changes that Wall Street has wanted involving capital rules, proprietary trading and a process known as “living wills” that aims to prevent taxpayer bailouts. ==See also== * Bank regulation *Financial privacy laws in the United States ==Notes== * Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. ==References * FRB Regulations * * Banking laws and legislation dating back to the first Bank of the United States ","title":"Bank regulation in the United States"},{"id":"19254318","text":"iNoki is an iPhone app for migrating Nokia PC Suite backup .NBU file to Apple iPhone. ==Features== It is the iPhone version of the Noki application which is an explorer for Nokia backup files for Microsoft Windows.

Its last assignment was with the 405th Tactical Training Wing, being inactivated at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, on 19 November 1990. During World War II, the 426th Night Fighter Squadron was a night fighter squadron assigned to Tenth Air Force in India, and Fourteenth Air Force in China. It was reactivated in 1970 as a tactical fighter Replacement Training Unit (RTU) At Luke AFB. ==HistoryWorld War II=== The 426th Night Fighter Squadron was formed at Hammer Field, California in January 1944. It was the first night fighter squadron formed in California and was the first programmed for deployment to the China-Burma-India Theater of Operations. It and the 427th Night Fighter Squadron were also the first squadrons fully trained on the Northrup P-61 Black Widow night fighter. The two squadrons remained close to each other through their training cycles, flying training missions in the Bakersfield area. With its training as a unit completed, the members of 426th NFS packed their bags and left California's sunny San Joaquin Valley in mid-June 1944.Northrop P-61 Black Widow—The Complete History and Combat Record, Garry R. Pape, John M. Campbell and Donna Campbell, Motorbooks International, 1991. Aircrews of the 426th Night Fighter Squadron at their first operational base at Chengtu, China, 1944. From Chengtu, their mission was to protect B-29 Superfortresses using Chinese Air Bases as staging bases from India on Operation Matterhorn Missions to Japan. After the B-29s moved to the Central Pacific, the Black Widows were used for night intruder and ground attack missions during daylight hours. The squadron took a long route getting to India, traveling across the United States to Newport News, Virginia, where they boarded the USS General A. E. Anderson for India. Arriving on 8 August, they boarded a train that took them to their next stop, Calcutta. Their destination, for a while at least, was Camp Kanchapara, about forty miles from Calcutta. They would have quite a bit of time on their hands, because it wasn't until late September that their P-61 Black Widows arrived by ship in Calcutta. During this period, some of the ground echelon was sent to Sylhet (now part of Bangladesh), on temporary duty with a combat cargo unit. When P-61s were unloaded on the Calcutta docks on 25 September, these partially disassembled craft were transported to Barrackpore where they were reassembled by the Air Service Command. Once checked out, the 426th NFS took possession of the planes and flew them to Madhaiganj Air Base. During the next couple of weeks, the planes would be rotated to Ondal, where Air Service Command modified them (one of the modifications being additional radio equipment). 5 October marked the start of the 426th's combat deployment; four aircraft were sent to Chengtu Airfield, China, Upon their arrival the mission of the 426th NFS was night defense for the Twentieth Air Force B-29 Superfortresses based there. The 426th replaced the P-51B Mustangs of the 311th Fighter Group that had escorted the B-29s. However, as the 426th was several aircraft short of its full complement, the 311th transferred eight of its Mustangs to the squadron. By the end of October, the 426th was up-to-strength with P-61s at Chengtu. On 27 October, a detachment of the 426th initiated operations out of Kunming, China, where Fourteenth Air Force was headquartered. 426th Night Fighter Squadron Northrop P-61A-10-NO Black Widow 42-5619 The Japanese were well aware of the P-61s effectiveness, however many bomber crews were aware that there were too few of them to cover the entire Chinese front. Another issue faced by the Americans was the fact that the terrain in China was very rugged and it caused permanent echoes on radar. This made picking out enemy aircraft very difficult, and because of this, the Japanese flew many of their aircraft low to the ground. It was impossible for the P-61s airborne radar to pick up the enemy aircraft without the help of ground-based interceptor radar, so in many areas, the freelance interceptions by the P-61s was almost impossible. Bomber escort missions continued until February 1945, when Japanese night fighter flying against the B-29s nearly ceased. More and more, the squadron flew night intruder missions. The 426th started staging out of Ankang, Liangshan, and Sian (now known as Xi'an), China, from which they attacked communication, motor transport and railway lines until the end of the war. With the war finally ending in August, in September 1945, the 426th returned to India, where some of the squadron left from Karachi (now part of Pakistan) and others from Calcutta, India for their return voyage home. The squadron was inactivated on 8 November 1945. ===Cold War=== 426th TFTS F-4C-16-MC Phantom F-4C 63-7426. Later converted to an GF-4C instructional airframe at Sheppard AFB, TX.

Tail Code: The Complete History of USAF Tactical Aircraft Tail Code Markings. Schiffer Publishing, 1994. . The squadron was initially equipped with the F-100D Super Sabres that it inherited from the provisional 4515th Combat Crew Training Squadron. Its mission was to train Aerospace Defense Command (ADCOM) fighter-interceptor squadron pilots flying F-106 Delta Darts to intercept intruder aircraft. The F-100s would act as supersonic intruder aircraft in training flights over the large desert ranges of Arizona. As part of the phase-out of the F-100 from active service, it received McDonnell F-4C Phantom IIs in August 1971, with aircraft carrying a blue fin cap. In 1981 the squadron received F-15A/B Eagles, and its mission was changed to train interceptor pilots with the F-15, which was beginning to replace the F-106 Delta Dart in the air defense mission of the United States.Logan (2000) USAF F-15 Eagles: Units, Colors and Markings, Schiffer Pub Ltd; 1st edition. The F-15s carried red tail stripes by 1983 and added a yellow centered delta shape. The squadron also flew some F-15D models in 1989. It was inactivated in 1990 when the air defense training on the F-15 was moved to Tyndall AFB, Florida and to First Air Force as part of the realignment of air defense of the United States from the active-duty air force to the Air National Guard. ===Lineage=== * Constituted as: 426th Night Fighter Squadron on 8 December 1943 : Activated on: 1 January 1944 : Inactivated: 5 November 1945 * Re-designated: 426th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron, 18 January 1970 : Activated 18 January 1970 assuming the assets of the 4515th Combat Crew Training Squadron (Provisional) : Inactivated: 29 November 1990Rogers, Brian (2005).

For this, his newspaper were stopped, punished, and from November 2003 to January 2004, closed down. However, Sudanese authorities claimed it was due to Al-Ayem's failure to pay their taxes. In any case, its journalists have been fined, and sensitive or controversial issues have been confiscated by Sudanese authorities.

After reporter Andreas Parsch filed a Freedom of Information Act request, the Air Force told him the unit \\"support[s] training requirements … for infiltration and exfiltration.\\"The USAF's Most Secretive Squadron 427th Special Operations Squadron That is, it prepares troops for secretly slipping into and out of dangerous territory. The squadron is not listed by the Air Force Historical Research Agency.Email from AFHRA 2 June 2014 stating their office has no record of the 427th Special Operations Squadron It is reported by the press to be stationed at Pope Field, North Carolina. The squadron was originally formed during World War II as the 427th Night Fighter Squadron. Its planned mission to defend United States Army Air Forces bases in the Soviet Union was cancelled when the Soviets did not allow the unit to be based in Ukraine SSR during the Operation Frantic shuttle bombing missions that took place in 1944. It later served in Italy, India, Southern China and Burma as a P-61 Black Widow night fighter interceptor squadron. The squadron was re-activated during the Vietnam War to train Republic of Vietnam Air Force pilots in using the Cessna A-37 Dragonfly in counter-insurgency operations. Its most recent activation may involve counter- insurgency and counter-terrorist operations as part of Air Force Special Operations Command. ==Mission== The 427th SOS is a clandestine unit which the Air Force discloses little information about. According to news reports, it may provide Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) and tactically qualified crews to support training requirements for the US Army Special Operations Forces (SOF) community. It may support the US Army Special Operations Command (USASOC), the US Army Special Forces Command (USASFC), and the John F Kennedy Special Warfare Center (JFKSWCS). It is believed that the 427th SOS provides US Army SOF personnel the opportunity to train on various types of aircraft for infiltration and exfiltration that they may encounter in the lesser developed countries in which they provide training. If this is factual, then the 427th SOS aircrews must be proficient in smaller types of aircraft in order to familiarize US Army personnel with their characteristics, peculiarities, and capabilities. The Army's 160th SOAR (A) uses rotary wing platforms (MH-60, MH-47, MH-6/AH-6). AFSOC primarily uses fixed-wing aircraft (MC-130, AC-130, CASA-212) with the exception of its CV-22's. The 427th likely uses non- standard airframes that are usually found in 3rd world or former eastern bloc nations. ==History== The 427th Night Fighter Squadron was formed at Hammer Field, California, where its crews were trained. The squadron also flew training missions in the Bakersfield area. With their training as a unit completed, personnel of the 427th NFS packed their bags and left California's sunny San Joaquin Valley in mid-July 1944. Initially traveling by ship from the east coast to Casablanca, French Morocco. Once the squadrons' planes were assembled and checked out, the unit flew east to Cairo, Egypt, where they expected orders for Poltava Airfield, Ukraine on the Soviet Eastern Front.Northrop P-61 Black Widow—The Complete History and Combat Record, Garry R. Pape, John M. Campbell and Donna Campbell, Motorbooks International, 1991. ===The Russian Front and the Mediterranean=== The expected mission on the Russian Front was to provide night fighter escort and air defense for Eighth and Fifteenth Air Force B-17 Flying Fortress bombers on \\"shuttle\\" missions from their bases in England and Italy to targets in Eastern Europe as part of Operation Frantic. However, a Luftwaffe night attack on the Soviet Air Force bases where the bombers landed in Ukraine on 21 June 1944 created mass havoc and destroyed many aircraft on the ground. The Soviets refused to allow USAAF night fighters to defend the bomber bases, insisting that air defense was their responsibility, the 427th's orders to Poltava were scrubbed. Instead, the 427th NFS was to join the four Bristol Beaufighter-equipped night fighter squadrons of the Twelfth Air Force in the Mediterranean area. After about a week's stay in Cairo, the air echelon departed and arrived at the 19th Replacement Depot outside Naples, Italy. Their new assignment was to provide night air defense from Pomigliano Airfield, which started upon their arrival on 3 September. Their stay was short, as on 20 September the 427th was given orders to relocate to the China-Burma-India Theater of Operations and join the Tenth Air Force in India. Although the 427th was in operation in the Naples area for less than three weeks, it was able to fly a number of missions and had contacts with Luftwaffe reconnaissance aircraft from northern Italy. On one of these missions, a radar malfunction experienced just before coming into firing range prevented possible destruction of the German aircraft. On the other mission in which contact was made, the attack was cut short when the Naples antiaircraft defenses tried to help and nearly shot down the 427th's P-61. ===China-Burma-India Theater=== 427th Night Fighter Squadron P-61 Black Widows arriving at Calcutta, India, 1944 Arriving in India, the squadron cooperated closely with the 426th NFS. The 426th, with only four operational Black Widows, needed additional aircraft for their Chengtu, China operations. A deal was struck between the COs of the two squadrons in which the 427th would give the 426th eight of its twelve aircraft in exchange for the 426th's aircraft at the depot at Karachi, where two were assembled and six were being assembled. At this time the 427th was assigned to Pandaveswar Airfield in West Bengal. On 28 November another contingent of the 427th NFS arrived at Myitkyina Airfield, Burma. More of the squadron arrived during December, basically by truck over the Ledo Road from their headquarters in India to prepare Myitkyina as the squadron's new headquarters where they would remain until May 1945. During December, the 427th's small detachment of three P-61s at Myitkyina saw all there was of aerial \\"action.\\" They participated in seventeen combat missions. Three were patrols ordered by higher headquarters, two were due to enemy aircraft in the area. Northrop P-61A-10-NO Black Widow 42-5628 of the 427th Night Fighter Squadron in flight over Northern Burma, 1944 On 25 December 1944 a detachment of the 427th NFS arrived at Kunming airport, China, relieving the 426th's detachment, although the bulk of the squadron remained in Burma. During January 1945, they flew patrols over Myitkyina and Bhamo and twelve local tactical interceptions. No enemy aircraft was encountered. Unfortunately for the 427th, one of those misfortunes of war occurred. On 22 January one of its aircraft in the China detachment operating out of Suichwan Airfield in southeast China shot down a US C-87 (a transport version of the Liberator bomber) with a crew of nine. The C-87 was in a prohibited area and made no radio calls, which led to the conclusion that it was hostile. From this point on, Japanese night flying nearly ceased. The 427th flew more and more night intruder missions. It modified its aircraft to carry a three-tube bazooka-type rocket launcher under each wing. With its rocket-carrying P-61s, it operated against Japanese forces from its bases at Myitkyina in Burma as well as Kunming in China. The 427th NFS intruder missions started on 22 February with a sweep of the road network south of Lashio, Burma. The squadron flew seven night intruder sorties that month. In mid-March, day and night offensive reconnaissance missions covering Pangkeyhtu/Loi-lem/Ho-pong/Namsang road network. Thirty-three-day and night patrols were accomplished that month. Missions planned to originate from Kunming and Chihkiang Airfield were curtailed in April because of a shortage of fuel. Squadron headquarters moved from Burma to Kisselbarri, near Dinjan, India, in late May. The detachment at Kunming China remained there, operating elements from Dinjan Airfield, India; Chengkung and Nanning Airport in China until the war's end. Activity increased in July, with the squadron claiming 155 sampans destroyed and fifty-two damaged in addition to numerous warehouses, barges, trains and trucks destroyed. Besides flying day and night intruder sorties, two special medical supply airdrop sorties were flown in a BT-13 Valiant aircraft. On 13 August 1945, the 427th was ordered to move to Liuchow Airfield, China. The air echelon flew there immediately while the ground echelon began the movement by road. With the war over, the air echelon was ordered to fly to Yangkai Airfield, China, to turn in their aircraft for 'pickling' (preparation for storage) and start processing home. All aircraft were turned in at Yangkai on 29 August. The 427th Night Fighter Squadron was inactivated on 13 October 1945. ===Vietnam War=== Cessna OA-37B The 427th Special Operations Training Squadron was with Tactical Air Command, being assigned to England Air Force Base, Louisiana on 1 July 1970. The squadron's mission was to provide transition training to Republic of Vietnam Air Force pilots for the OA-37B Dragonfly counterinsurgency aircraft to combat guerrilla type activity. The standard A-37 aircraft was fitted with a refueling probe in the nose; reticulated foam was added to the self-sealing fuel tanks to protect against fire or explosions if hit by incendiary anti-aircraft rounds. The cockpit was armor-plated and the undercarriage was strengthened to carry greater weight and to enable the aircraft to operate off rough remote airstrips.Darling.

Its primary use was as the home field for the Kent State Golden Flashes football team and also served as the home venue for the KSU men's track and field team. The football and track teams had already been playing on the site since 1941, but with temporary bleachers for seating. The permanent grandstand built and dedicated in 1950, which also included a press box, was the first phase of the stadium, and was later followed by a duplicate grandstand on the opposite side of the field in 1954. Initial plans called for the seating to eventually surround the field, though these plans were largely never realized. During the 1960s, additional bleacher seats were added separate from the two main grandstands on all sides of the field, and brought seating capacity to approximately 20,000 by 1965. Campus developments in the 1960s and the need to keep the stadium on par with other facilities in the Mid-American Conference, however, led university officials to recommend building a new stadium on a different site rather than continue to expand Memorial Stadium. The stadium was displaced to make way for a new 12-story library and student center complex, originally known as the University Center, built in the late 1960s and early 1970s adjacent to the stadium site. The main seating areas of Memorial Stadium were dismantled in early 1969 and reassembled at the site of the new stadium in a different configuration. Today, the site of Memorial Stadium is largely occupied by the visitor parking lot for the Kent Student Center while the original grandstand of Memorial Stadium is still used as the north end zone at Dix Stadium. ==History== View of the \\"new University Athletic Field\\" dated November 14, 1941, showing the original stands When Kent State Normal College established its first football team in 1920, the team played at Rockwell Field, which was also shared with the baseball team. Rockwell Field was plagued by poor drainage and sod issues and the school found it difficult to schedule home games because of the poor state of the field. In 1939, construction started on new athletic fields along Summit Street with the hope of eventually building a permanent stadium, a project funded by the Works Progress Administration. The area was on what was then the far southwestern edge of the campus, previously known as the College Farm. It was completed in 1941 and included temporary bleacher seating and a cinder track around the field. Adjacent to the football field and track was a baseball field. The first game at the new field, which was initially just referred to as the Athletic Field, was on September 27, 1941, a 58–0 Kent State win over Bluffton College. After World War II ended, the university saw an increase in male enrollment, so additional facilities were built in the area around what was eventually called Memorial Field. A new physical education building for men, now known as the Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center, was built on the hill overlooking Memorial Stadium and opened in December 1950. The university's first men's dorm, Stopher Hall, had opened in 1948, just north of the eventual site of the new gym. Aerial of Memorial Stadium in 1950 when it was new. The main grandstand is still in use at Dix Stadium. The Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center can be seen on the left The drive to build a permanent stadium was organized in 1946, led by a committee made up of students, alumni, faculty, and local residents who raised approximately $60,000 in two years. Long-range plans initially called for permanent seating to form a horseshoe around the field and seating for 30,000 people. The first game held at the new stadium was on October 14, 1950, a 57–0 win over Marietta College. That was also the stadium's dedication game, where it was dedicated to the 113 KSU students who had died during World War II. The main grandstand sat 5,600 people and included a press box. Auxiliary bleacher seating was placed on the opposite side of the field for an initial capacity of approximately 7,000. In 1954, a second permanent grandstand was built opposite the original one using the same design. This raised the stadium's capacity to approximately 12,000. Additional auxiliary bleachers would be added on either side of the grandstands and in the end zones over the years, finally bringing capacity to 20,000 by 1965. For the 1965 season, the 20,000-seat capacity made the stadium the largest in the Mid-American Conference until the opening of Doyt Perry Stadium at Bowling Green State University the following year. During their stay at Memorial Stadium, Kent State joined the Mid-American Conference in 1951 and qualified for their first bowl game, the 1954 Refrigerator Bowl. The stadium also hosted the 1968 MAC track and field championships. ===Replacement=== Original grandstand of Memorial Stadium in 2014 at Dix Stadium as the north end zone seats As early as 1964, there were discussions about building a new stadium as the campus continued to expand in the late 1950s and 1960s. By the mid 1960s, university leaders were planning a new university center that was based around a new library and student center and a row of science buildings. Memorial Stadium would also likely need upgrades to help it keep pace with other facilities in the MAC, so building on a new site was the preferred choice. Rather than build completely new, though, the new stadium, which was also called Memorial Stadium for its first four seasons, was considered an expansion and relocation of the old stadium as all of Memorial Stadium's main seating areas were dismantled in 1969 and moved to the new site further down Summit Street where they were reassembled in a new configuration. The original south grandstand was moved to be the north end zone seats at the new stadium, while the north grandstand became the south end zone. The auxiliary seating sections that had been adjacent to the grandstands at Memorial Stadium were placed along the east sideline of the new stadium. ==Facilities== The field was oriented parallel to Summit Street, running northwest to southeast, and it was surrounded by an eight-lane cinder track. Initially, seating was provided by temporary wooden bleachers on both sidelines, with an elevated area behind the south stand and a small building for storage. Locker rooms were added when the permanent south grandstand was built in 1950 and were located beneath the seating areas with space for storage. Additional storage areas were added under the north grandstand when it was completed in 1954. A one-story press box was included in the stadium construction in 1950. When the north stands were added in 1954, a second level was added to the original press box on the south side with a single-story press area on the new north side. By the mid 1960s, a second story had been added to the north side press area as well. The field had permanent lighting, added in 1950, with lighting poles located along both sidelines. It was also used for high school football as the home venue for Kent State High School. In the southeast end zone, an electronic scoreboard was added as part of stadium construction in 1950, replacing the previous manual scoreboard. ==Site today== MAC Center Construction on the new University Center started in 1967 with the 12-story library, which was completed and dedicated in August 1970. Following the dismantling of the seating areas and demolition of support structures at Memorial Stadium in 1969, the former stadium and field area were used for parking. Construction on the student center and Risman Plaza, located between the student center and library, started in 1969 on the site of what had been a football practice field. The student center was completed and dedicated in January 1973. Most of the Memorial Stadium site was used for an access road to the student center, known as Risman Drive, and a permanent parking lot for visitors to the university. In 2012, as part of an upgrade and expansion of Risman Plaza, the road and parking lot were reconfigured to allow for construction of a grassy area known as the Student Green, which overlaps the former Memorial Stadium end zone area. Of the pieces of the original stadium, only the north end zone seating area—the original portion of Memorial Stadium—remains in use at Dix Stadium. Prior to the 2007 season the original press box was removed and the entire seating area was repainted. The other parts of Memorial Stadium were removed during the 2000s. The east stands were torn down after the 2001 season and were replaced with a new student section in 2003. In February 2008, the south end zone bleachers were razed as part of Dix Stadium's most recent upgrades to make way for a plaza, new concession area, and new scoreboard. ==References== Category:Defunct college football venues Category:Kent State Golden Flashes football venues Category:American football venues in Ohio ","title":"Memorial Stadium (Kent State)"},{"id":"19254419","text":"Siraya National Scenic Area Wusanto Reservoir Siraya National Scenic Area () is the newest of Taiwan's national scenic areas.

Healy was a journalist with The Irish Times newspaper, writing the Backbencher column in the 1960s and 1970s. He was a close friend of the editor, Douglas Gageby. Healy's book No One Shouted Stop (The Death of an Irish Town), published in 1968, chronicled the economic and social decline of rural life in the west of Ireland in a time of widespread poverty and mass emigration. He also wrote Nineteen Acres on the history and lifestyle of his family, who were small farmers. Healy was a strong Fianna Fáil supporter and one of the most fervent journalistic supporters and admirers of both Donagh O'Malley and Charles Haughey. Healy's support for the latter caused considerable controversy among his fellow Irish Times journalists, many of whom were outspoken opponents of Haughey. ==Death and legacy== Healy died January 6, 1991, and was survived by his wife, Evelyn.

It describes a near future world where deep submarine seismic activity leads to seabed fragmentation, and the opening of deep subterranean reservoirs of water. Human civilisation is almost destroyed by the rising inundation, which covers Mount Everest in 2052. Baxter issued a sequel to this work, entitled Ark, in 2009. Flood was nominated for the British Science Fiction Award in 2008. ==Synopsis== The above effects are catastrophic, and exceed current estimates of climate change-related sea level rise. In the opening chapter, four main characters (former USAF Captain Lily Brooke, British military officer Piers Michaelmas, English tourist Helen Gray, and NASA scientist Gary Boyle) are liberated by a private megacorporation called AxysCorp from a Christian extremist Catalan terrorist bunker in Barcelona in 2016, after five years of captivity. AxysCorp was hoping to save a fifth prisoner, John Foreshaw, but he was executed minutes before the rescue. Nonetheless, the corporation continues to look after the four hostages and search for Helen's daughter, Grace, who was conceived in captivity by the son of a Saudi royal and taken by his family. Helen befriends Foreign Office official Michael Thurley in the hopes of finding her daughter, and the four rescued hostages make a pact to keep in contact. At this point, sea level changes have already submerged Tuvalu, a low lying South Pacific island, whose inhabitants have been evacuated to New Zealand. London and Sydney are prone to constant flooding. However, as a tidal surge hits London and Sydney, killing hundreds of thousands in both cities, scientists become aware that this cannot be explained solely by the consequences of climate change. American oceanographer Thandie Jones uncovers the truth – through deep sea diving missions to oceanic ridges and trenches reveal that the seabed has fragmented, and there is turbulence that can only be attributable to the infusion of vast subterranean reservoirs of hitherto hypothesised but undetected oceanic masses of water (see below). Over the next three decades, ocean waters rise exponentially and inundate the whole world, as the main characters struggle for survival in a vast and continuously altering environment. Lily and her sister Amanda, as well as her children Benj and Kristie experience the flooding and abandonment of London. Amanda and her children settle into a refugee resettlement in Dartmoor, but the rising floodwaters make that only a temporary respite. In 2019, a tsunami obliterates western coastal cities in the United Kingdom, killing Helen Gray and tens of thousands of others. At the same time, New York City is demolished by an Atlantic tidal wave (with hundreds of thousands killed in New York and the city levelled in the process), and Washington, D.C. is evacuated. For the next twenty years, Denver, Colorado becomes the capital of the steadily diminishing United States, which fragments as individual states assert their own survival needs. By 2020, much of the eastern coast of the United States is underwater, as well as Sacramento, California, on its western coast. AxysCorp CEO Nathan Lammockson, the man who ordered the main characters' rescue and indirect friend of Lily, has a contingency plan for survival of an affluent western minority, which involves evacuation to the mountainous Peruvian Andes. Lily, Amanda with her children, and Piers tag along to the settlement, where Nathan discloses that he is aware of the extent of global inundation, which will not stop until all land on Earth is submerged, apart from the Greenland and eastern Antarctica ice sheets. As the United States is eroded away, a contingent of refugees which includes Gary, Thandie, and Grace, heads south to meet Lily. When they reach Nathan's 'Project City' in Peru, they are swept up in a revolt that tries to seize control of the former elite settlement which results in the deaths of Amanda, Benj, and Kristie's husband, Ollantay, a self-claimed Inca descendant who leads the revolt. Gary parts ways with Lily as he hands over Grace, so they, along with Piers and Kristie board Nathan's \\"Ark Three\\", a Queen Mary sized (and shaped) ocean vessel that sets sail in 2035. By then, little of Western Europe, Russia, the Americas, Oceania, and Africa remain above the water. Ark Three sails the global ocean in search for trading and finding higher ground, despite running into skirmishes with pirates that lead to Lily falling overboard and staying on a submarine with Thandie for a year, the survivors head for Tibet. However, when they arrive, Nepal's Maoist rulers have devastating news – Tibet is ruled by a Khmer Rouge-like regime that practices human slavery and cannibalism. Ark Three heads back out to sea but has nowhere to go, given that the floods are now lapping around the Rocky Mountains. Seaborn piracy is rife from those refugee seaborn populations who have taken to scavenging the refuse from the posthumous remains of human civilization; and after a visit to coastal Colorado, the pirates ultimately board and destroy Ark Three. By this time, over five billion people have perished from the floods. By 2048, the Andes, Rocky Mountains and elsewhere have been submerged. Tibet's regime is no more, and Australia, North America, South America, Africa, and most of Asia except for the highest mountains in the Himalayas have been flooded. As Lily, Gary, and Thandie settle into life as sea-dwelling survivors; Piers, Nathan, and Kirstie die in staggered succession since the sinking of Ark Three. The novel ends in 2052, as a group of survivors watch the submergence of the peak of Mount Everest. Lily has survived, and wonders what the grandchildren of her late-sister's family and her old hostage comrades from three decades ago will make of post-deluge Earth, now at a new environmental equilibrium, with a vast global storm system that is reminiscent of those on Jupiter and Neptune. Civilization is virtually dead at the novel's end. Survivors continue to exist only on the rafts and some decrepit surviving former navy vessels. The children of the rafts, raised on the water, start building their own aquatic culture. By the end of the novel, extinction seems certain for humanity on Earth. However, we learn later in the book that Ark Three (the aforementioned ocean liner) was one of many projects created by AxysCorp and a few other groups. One of these (Ark One) was a starship project, which was taken over by the remnant government of the United States, and launched as Denver flooded in 2041; and at that time earlier in the novel, Lily had managed to get Grace aboard it just before it launched, and at the time she was unwillingly pregnant with the child of Nathan's snobbish and estranged son, Hammond. In 2044, a lunar eclipse occurs, just as a massive burst of light is sighted near Jupiter and the survivors realise it must be Ark One, and Grace's survival is thus ensured. As they prepare to leave the former site of Mount Everest Lily realizes something. She sailed on Ark Three, and Ark One is a starship. In closing, she asks \\"What is Ark Two?\\" The question ends the novel, and sets the scene for Baxter's sequel, Ark, in which it is resolved. ==\\"Hard science\\" basis for novel== In a short afterword,Stephen Baxter: Flood: London: Gollancz: 2008: pg. 472–473 Baxter claims to have based his work on a hypothesis related to possible subterranean oceans within the Earth's mantle. His other references are cursory, although oneNew Scientist 10 March 2007 refers to the presence of such immense reservoirs approximately below Beijing. In 2014, an ultra-deep diamond found in Juína, Mato Grosso in western Brazil, contained inclusions of ringwoodite—the only known sample of natural terrestrial origin—thus providing evidence of significant amounts of water as hydroxide in the Earth's mantle. ==See also== * Ark * Deluge * Flood myth ** List of flood myths * Doomsday event * Greenhouse and icehouse Earth ==References * Flood at Worlds Without End Category:2008 British novels Category:2008 science fiction novels Category:British post-apocalyptic novels Category:Environmental fiction books Category:Novels by Stephen Baxter Category:Novels set in Barcelona Category:Fiction set in the 21st century Category:Hard science fiction Category:Victor Gollancz Ltd books Category:Apocalyptic novels Category:Jupiter in fiction ","title":"Flood (Baxter novel)"},{"id":"19254569","text":"South Loop Printing House District is a historic district in the downtown Chicago Loop area of Chicago, Illinois.

It was the first Mexican film to be screened at the Cannes International Film Festival where it won the Grand Prix (now known as the Palme d'Or) becoming the first Latin American film to do so.Festival de Cannes - Official Selection 1946 María Candelaria would later win a Silver Ariel award for Best Cinematography. The film came to be regarded as one of Fernández's best works, in which he portrays the indigenous people of Mexico with innocence and dignity. Fernández has said that he wrote an original version of the plot on 13 napkins while sitting in a restaurant. He was anxious because he was dating Dolores del Río and could not afford to buy her a birthday present. The film was originally titled Xochimilco and the protagonist was named María del Refugio. Major themes in the film include melodrama, indigenousness, nationalism, and the beauty of Mexico. María Candelaria is one of Mexico's most beloved films of all time, and it was ranked thirty-seventh among the top 100 films of Mexican cinema. ==Plot== A young journalist presses an old artist to display the portrait of a naked indigenous woman that he has in his study. As the artist begins to tell the story behind the painting, the action becomes a flashback to Xochimilco, Mexico in 1909, right before the Mexican Revolution. Xochimilco is an area with beautiful landscapes inhabited mostly by indigenous people. The woman in the painting is María Candelaria, a young indigenous woman shunned by her own people for being the daughter of a prostitute. She and her lover, Lorenzo Rafael, face constant struggles. They are honest and hardworking, yet nothing ever goes right for them. Don Damián, a jealous Mestizo store owner who wants María for himself, prevents them from getting married and pursues Maria over a minor debt. He kills a piglet that María and Lorenzo planned to raise and sell for profit and refuses to buy flowers from them. When María contracts malaria, Don Damián refuses to give the couple the quinine necessary to fight the disease. Lorenzo breaks into the store to steal the medicine and takes a wedding dress for María. Lorenzo goes to prison for stealing and María agrees to model for the painter to pay for his release. The artist begins painting her portrait and then asks her to pose nude, which she refuses to do. The artist finishes the painting with the nude body of another woman. When the people of Xochimilco see the painting, they assume it is María Candelaria and stone her to death. Finally, Lorenzo escapes from prison to carry María's lifeless body through Xochimilco's Canal of the Dead. ==CastMain cast=== * Dolores del Río as María Candelaria: A beautiful, indigenous Mexican woman who has many misfortunes befall her throughout the film. * Pedro Armendáriz as Lorenzo Rafael: María Candelaria's lover and only consistent supporter. * Alberto Galán as Painter: The narrator of the story and creator of the painting that ultimately leads to María's death. The character is based on muralist Diego Rivera. * Margarita Cortés as Lupe: A young woman in the community who is jealous of María because she wants to be with Lorenzo Rafael. She is instrumental in the mob of townspeople who eventually stone María to death. * Miguel Inclán as don Damián: A store owner who exploits indigenous people and wants María for himself. ===Supporting cast=Production== María Candelaria benefited from a time of commercial success in the Mexican film industry in the 1940s and 1950s. Fernández and Figueroa had worked together previously, and they shared a similar vision for the film. In addition to the experienced team of producers, the film benefited from Dolores del Río's success as an actress through the star system. The film was the gift that Emilio Fernández offered to Dolores del Río, to compensate for his mistreatment of del Río during their filming of Flor silvestre (1943). Emilio's \\"bronco\\" temperament had surfaced on several occasions, and the actress had nearly left the film. The pleas of their co-workers, and her high sense of professionalism, convinced del Río to return. However, her relationship with the director had become distant. On Good Friday 1943, del Río's birthday, was the occasion chosen by the filmmaker to find the desired reconciliation. In addition to needing her as an actress, Fernández began to love her as a woman. In his biographical account of the actress, writer David Ramón relates: > \\"When it was Emilio Fernández's turn to give her his gift, he got close up > to Dolores and took a bunch of napkins with writings, and he practically > threw them to her and said: This is your birthday present, a history of > cinema. I hope you'll like it, it's your next film, it's called Xochimilco. > It's yours, it's your property, if somebody wants to buy it, they'll buy it > from you.\\" > With the generous gift and all, Dolores had her doubts.

A note on notation: in this article, we denote projection maps by their domains, e.g., πTTM : TTM → TM. Some authors index these maps by their ranges instead, so for them, that map would be written πTM. The second tangent bundle arises in the study of connections and second order ordinary differential equations, i.e., (semi)spray structures on smooth manifolds, and it is not to be confused with the second order jet bundle. == Secondary vector bundle structure and canonical flip == Since is a vector bundle in its own right, its tangent bundle has the secondary vector bundle structure where is the push-forward of the canonical projection In the following we denote : \\\\xi = \\\\xi^k\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^k}\\\\Big_x\\\\in T_xM, \\\\qquad X = X^k\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^k}\\\\Big_x\\\\in T_xM and apply the associated coordinate system : \\\\xi \\\\mapsto (x^1,\\\\ldots,x^n,\\\\xi^1,\\\\ldots,\\\\xi^n) on TM. Then the fibre of the secondary vector bundle structure at X∈TxM takes the form : (\\\\pi_{TM})^{-1}_*(X) = \\\\Big\\\\\\\\{ \\\\ X^k\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^k}\\\\Big_\\\\xi + Y^k\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial\\\\xi^k}\\\\Big_\\\\xi \\\\ \\\\Big \\\\ \\\\xi\\\\in T_xM \\\\ , \\\\ Y^1,\\\\ldots,Y^n\\\\in\\\\R \\\\ \\\\Big\\\\\\\\}. The double tangent bundle is a double vector bundle. The canonical flipP.Michor. Topics in Differential Geometry, American Mathematical Society, 2008. is a smooth involution j:TTM->TTM that exchanges these vector space structures in the sense that it is a vector bundle isomorphism between and In the associated coordinates on TM it reads as : j\\\\Big(X^k\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^k}\\\\Big_\\\\xi + Y^k\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\xi^k}\\\\Big_\\\\xi\\\\Big) = \\\\xi^k\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^k}\\\\Big_X + Y^k\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\xi^k}\\\\Big_X. The canonical flip has the property that for any f: R2 -> M, : \\\\frac {\\\\partial f} {{\\\\partial t} {\\\\partial s}} = j \\\\circ \\\\frac {\\\\partial f} {{\\\\partial s} {\\\\partial t}} where s and t are coordinates of the standard basis of R 2. Note that both partial derivatives are functions from R2 to TTM. This property can, in fact, be used to give an intrinsic definition of the canonical flip.Robert J. Fisher and H. Turner Laquer, Second Order Tangent Vectors in Riemannian Geometry, J. Korean Math. Soc. 36 (1999), No. 5, pp. 959-1008 Indeed, there is a submersion p: J20 (R2,M) -> TTM given by : p([f])=\\\\frac {\\\\partial f} {{\\\\partial t} {\\\\partial s}} (0,0) where p can be defined in the space of two-jets at zero because only depends on f up to order two at zero. We consider the application: : J: J^2_0(\\\\mathbb{R}^2,M) \\\\to J^2_0(\\\\mathbb{R}^2,M) \\\\quad / \\\\quad J([f])=[f \\\\circ \\\\alpha] where α(s,t)= (t,s). Then J is compatible with the projection p and induces the canonical flip on the quotient TTM. == Canonical tensor fields on the tangent bundle== As for any vector bundle, the tangent spaces of the fibres TxM of the tangent bundle can be identified with the fibres TxM themselves. Formally this is achieved through the vertical lift, which is a natural vector space isomorphism defined as : (\\\\operatorname{vl}_\\\\xi X)[f]:=\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\Big_{t=0}f(x,\\\\xi+tX), \\\\qquad f\\\\in C^\\\\infty(TM). The vertical lift can also be seen as a natural vector bundle isomorphism from the pullback bundle of over onto the vertical tangent bundle : VTM:=\\\\operatorname{Ker}(\\\\pi_{TM})_* \\\\subset TTM. The vertical lift lets us define the canonical vector field : V:TM\\\\to TTM; \\\\qquad V_\\\\xi := \\\\operatorname{vl}_\\\\xi\\\\xi, which is smooth in the slit tangent bundle TM\\\\0. The canonical vector field can be also defined as the infinitesimal generator of the Lie-group action : \\\\mathbb R\\\\times (TM\\\\setminus 0) \\\\to TM\\\\setminus 0; \\\\qquad (t,\\\\xi) \\\\mapsto e^t\\\\xi. Unlike the canonical vector field, which can be defined for any vector bundle, the canonical endomorphism : J:TTM\\\\to TTM; \\\\qquad J_\\\\xi X := \\\\operatorname{vl}_\\\\xi(\\\\pi_{TM})_*X, \\\\qquad X\\\\in T_\\\\xi TM is special to the tangent bundle. The canonical endomorphism J satisfies : \\\\operatorname{Ran}(J)=\\\\operatorname{Ker}(J)=VTM, \\\\qquad \\\\mathcal L_VJ= -J, \\\\qquad J[X,Y]=J[JX,Y]+J[X,JY], and it is also known as the tangent structure for the following reason. If (E,p,M) is any vector bundle with the canonical vector field V and a (1,1)-tensor field J that satisfies the properties listed above, with VE in place of VTM, then the vector bundle (E,p,M) is isomorphic to the tangent bundle of the base manifold, and J corresponds to the tangent structure of TM in this isomorphism. There is also a stronger result of this kind D.S.Goel, Almost Tangent Structures, Kodai Math.Sem.Rep. 26 (1975), 187-193. which states that if N is a 2n-dimensional manifold and if there exists a (1,1)-tensor field J on N that satisfies : \\\\operatorname{Ran}(J)=\\\\operatorname{Ker}(J), \\\\qquad J[X,Y]=J[JX,Y]+J[X,JY], then N is diffeomorphic to an open set of the total space of a tangent bundle of some n-dimensional manifold M, and J corresponds to the tangent structure of TM in this diffeomorphism. In any associated coordinate system on TM the canonical vector field and the canonical endomorphism have the coordinate representations : V = \\\\xi^k\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\xi^k}, \\\\qquad J = dx^k\\\\otimes\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\xi^k}. == (Semi)spray structures == A Semispray structure on a smooth manifold M is by definition a smooth vector field H on TM \\\\0 such that JH=V. An equivalent definition is that j(H)=H, where j:TTM->TTM is the canonical flip. A semispray H is a spray, if in addition, [V,H]=H. Spray and semispray structures are invariant versions of second order ordinary differential equations on M. The difference between spray and semispray structures is that the solution curves of sprays are invariant in positive reparametrizations as point sets on M, whereas solution curves of semisprays typically are not. == Nonlinear covariant derivatives on smooth manifolds == The canonical flip makes it possible to define nonlinear covariant derivatives on smooth manifolds as follows. Let : T(TM\\\\setminus 0) = H(TM\\\\setminus 0) \\\\oplus V(TM\\\\setminus 0) be an Ehresmann connection on the slit tangent bundle TM\\\\0 and consider the mapping : D:(TM\\\\setminus 0)\\\\times \\\\Gamma(TM) \\\\to TM; \\\\quad D_XY := (\\\\kappa\\\\circ j)(Y_*X), where Y*:TM->TTM is the push-forward, j:TTM->TTM is the canonical flip and κ:T(TM/0)->TM/0 is the connector map. The mapping DX is a derivation in the module Γ (TM) of smooth vector fields on M in the sense that * D_X(\\\\alpha Y + \\\\beta Z) = \\\\alpha D_XY + \\\\beta D_XZ, \\\\qquad \\\\alpha,\\\\beta\\\\in\\\\mathbb R. * D_X(fY) = X[f]Y + f D_XY, \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad f\\\\in C^\\\\infty(M). Any mapping DX with these properties is called a (nonlinear) covariant derivative I.Bucataru, R.Miron, Finsler- Lagrange Geometry, Editura Academiei Române, 2007. on M. The term nonlinear refers to the fact that this kind of covariant derivative DX on is not necessarily linear with respect to the direction X∈TM/0 of the differentiation. Looking at the local representations one can confirm that the Ehresmann connections on (TM/0,πTM/0,M) and nonlinear covariant derivatives on M are in one-to-one correspondence. Furthermore, if DX is linear in X, then the Ehresmann connection is linear in the secondary vector bundle structure, and DX coincides with its linear covariant derivative. == See also == * Spray (mathematics) * Secondary vector bundle structure * Finsler manifold == References == Category:Differential geometry Category:Topology ","title":"Double tangent bundle"},{"id":"19254734","text":"Bruno Santos da Silva, or simply Bruno Santos, (born 31 August 1983, in Rio de Janeiro) is a former Brazilian footballer who played as a striker. == Career == Bruno Santos played for Swedish side IFK Norrköping between 2003 and 2007.

George Nicolas de Roerich (Russian: Юрий Николаевич Рёрих, ; August 16, 1902 in Okulovka, Novgorod Governorate – May 21, 1960 in Moscow) was a prominent 20th century Tibetologist. His name at birth was YuriVariant spellings of Yuri: Yury, Yuriy, or Iurii. The name \\"George\\" is a commonly used English equivalent of the Russian name \\"Yuri\\". Another variant of his name is spelled thusly: Ūrij Nikolaevič Rerih. Nikolaevich Rerikh. George's work encompassed many areas of Tibetan studies, but in particular he is known for his contributions to Tibetan dialectology, his monumental translation of the Blue Annals, and his 11-volume Tibetan-Russian-English dictionary (published posthumously). George was the son of the painter and explorer Nicholas Roerich and Helena Roerich. ==Early life== Much of Roerich's early life was spent in Saint Petersburg. His brother, Svetoslav Roerich, was born in 1904. Both sons' interests were nurtured by their mother, who wrote of her oldest son's childhood: \\"The elder one showed love for history and tin soldiers. He had thousands of them. His passion for the art of war has survived until now. Strategy is his pet subject. By the way, this talent is inborn, and he is very proud of his ancestor — field marshal of the Russian Empire Mikhail Kutuzov, the hero of Patriotic War of 1812.\\" H. Roerich's letter dated February 25, 1953 // The ICR Archive ==Education== By the time Roerich was 15, he had already begun studying Egyptology with Boris Turayev and Mongolian language and history with Andrei Dmitryevich Rudnyev. He was a student with broad interests and many talents. After finishing his studies at Karl May School, he entered the Indian and Iranian department of Oriental Languages at London University in 1918. Under Indologist Professor Edward Denison Ross he studied Sanskrit and Pali. He was recognized for his language abilities and was introduced as the best Sanskrit student to the Secretary of State for Indian Affairs who visited the university.http://en.icr.su/family/gnr/ Upon completion of his study at London University in 1920, he moved to America with his parents. He studied in the Indian Philology Department of Harvard University and also studied during his time there. At the age of 18, Roerich was already firmly rooted in his passion for Oriental studies. He mastered Sanskrit during his time at Harvard under the direction of Professor Charles Rockwell Lanman, whose comparative grammar lessons made a lifelong impact on George's future studies. Roerich also attended lectures by Professor Michael Rostovtzeff on Middle Asia influences in the art of southern Russia. During his years at Harvard, he wrote his first essay on Buddhism and studied classical Chinese. He received both a bachelor's and master's degree from Harvard University, then continued his education in Paris, France. He spent the years 1922-1923 at Paris University in Sorbonne, working in the Department of Middle Asian, Indian and Mongol-Tibetan Studies and studying in the Military Department as well as the Department of Law and Economy. During his time here, he cooperated with such famous orientalists as Paul Pelliot and Sylvain Lévi. He learned Mongolian and Tibetan while also continuing his study of Chinese and Persian languages. He graduated with his M.A. in Indian Philology in 1923.http://www.roerichtrust.org/Roerich%20family_files/grpersonal/GRpersonal1.htm ==CareerEarly work=== Roerich began his independent research at the age of 21. In November 1923 he left for Bombay with his family. After years of study and preparation, his dream of going to India came true. By December 1923, he had arrived at the base of the Himalayas as a member of a scientific expedition to Sikkim. The purpose of this expedition was to visit ancient monuments and Buddhist monasteries as well as to record local legends, beliefs and artistic traditions. In Darjeeling, George polished his colloquial Tibetan with scholar Lama L.M. Dorje, who guided him in the study of Tibetan Art. Roerich found strong similarities between ancient Russian icon painting and the art of tankha painting in both technique and in the treatment of the subject. He wrote: \\"Indeed, it seems that the Russian icon art and the Tibetan pictorial art derive their methods of work from a common source...Thus we often see on Tibetan paintings the principal figures enthroned on an island (this being usually the case when Buddha or Bodhisattva is represented). Similar images are frequently found on Russian icons.\\" In 1925, Roerich published his first book titled Tibetan Paintings in which he attempted to define Tibetan art, its history, and the three existing schools of art in Tibet. David Jackson in his A History of Tibetan Painting acknowledged that in the Western scholarship, \\"the earliest account of Tibetan paintings styles...was that of George Roerich\\". ===Central Asian expedition=== The Roerich family embarked on an ambitious journey throughout Central Asia in 1925. This journey began in India and lasted four years. It was a crucial time in George Roerich's career as a scientist, and he began his study of ancient pre-Buddhist doctrine of Bon and the translation of its manuscript. Despite the difficulties of travel and political instability, Roerich managed to make several important discoveries during this expedition, including previously unknown materials about the Tibetan Epic of King Gesar. Another important discovery was that the animal style that was used by nomads who had migrated from Central Asia to South Russia in the 7th and 8th centuries B.C.E. could be found among Northern Tibetan nomads. Roerich believed that \\"All art objects made in animal style found and described by the expedition clearly proved the existence of ancient Central Asian art amongst nomads of Tibet.\\" His role as translator was invaluable to the group as they traveled. Roerich could speak Mongolian and Tibetan fluently as well as many other Central Asian languages. Despite his young age, he was given the task of guarding the group's safety. Here, his knowledge of military tactics from his university study proved useful and his tactical skills and courage saved their caravan on more than one occasion.http://en.icr.su/family/gnr/index.php His study of the geography, archeology, ethnology, and linguistics during the expedition formed the basis of his work Trails to Inmost Asia, published in 1930. This publication put the young orientalist on par with the famous researchers of Central Asia, such as Nikolay Przhevalsky, Grigory Potanin, Pyotr Kozlov, and Sven Hedin.http://www.roerichtrust.org/Roerich%20family_files/grpersonal/GRpersonal1.htm Of this lengthy and challenging journey, Roerich later said \\"The expedition headed by Professor Nicholas Roerich, organized by the Roerich Museum in New York and International Centre of Art 'Corona Mundi' had as its main task creation of the unique pictorial panorama of the lands and nations of Inmost Asia. The second task, was research of the possibilities of the new archaeological excavations, and thus, preparation of the ways for the future expeditions in this region. The third task was research of the languages and dialects of Central Asia, and gathering a big collection of objects, that depict spiritual culture of these nations. Central Asia has been a cradle and a meeting place of many Asian civilizations, and inaccessible mountain valleys till our days preserved many invaluable linguistic and ethnographic materials, which can help to reconstruct the past of Asia.\\"http://www.roerichtrust.org/Roerich%20family_files/grpersonal/GRpersonal1.htm ===Himalayan Research Institute=== The plethora of materials collected during the Central Asia Expedition became the foundation for the establishment of the Himalayan Research Institute named Urusvati in Darjeeling in 1928. A few months later, the institute moved to Naggar in Kulu Valley. The center engaged in scientific exchange with 285 institutes, universities, museums, and libraries around the world. Roerich collaborated with Tibetan scholars and published the Tibetan English Dictionary in 1934. One of his main focuses for the center was to bring people to the institute who practiced and lived the cultures being examined by the center. He was the director of the institute for 10 years.http://en.icr.su/family/gnr/02.php ===Manchuria expedition=== In 1934-1935, Roerich undertook an expedition with his father to Manchuria and Inner Mongolia that was organized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for the purpose of collecting seeds of drought resistant plants that would help prevent erosion of soils and the spreading of pests. In addition to gaining purely scientific knowledge, this expedition also had a social and cultural aim: to create wider agricultural cooperation and public collaboration.http://en.icr.su/family/gnr/02.php Professor Nicholas Roerich led the expedition, and George Roerich was the assistant and responsible for the medicinal research. They gathered a collection of drought resistant plants, herbs, and soil as well as a valuable list of traditional medicinal treatments. Roerich made maps and conducted a photo survey of the region in which the expedition took place. In 1935, the research from the expedition was transferred back to India, and the Roerichs returned to Kulu Valley in October 1935.http://www.roerichtrust.org/Roerich%20family_files/grpersonal/GRpersonal1.htm ==Later life== After the Manchuria expedition, Roerich spent many years living in India. His father Nicholas Roerich died in 1947. Due to political unrest in the area, Roerich moved with his mother Helena Roerich from their home in Nagger to Kalimpong where he lived until 1956. Helena Roerich died in 1955, and in 1957, Roerich returned to Russia.http://www.roerichtrust.org/Roerich%20family_files/grpersonal/GRpersonal1.htm Before his return to his homeland, Roerich participated in several important projects. He collaborated with Prince Peter of Greece and Denmark and R. Sanskrtyayana to translate the Buddhist text Pramanavaartikam from Tibetan into Sanskrit. Working with Tse-Trung Lopsang Phuntshok he wrote Textbook of Colloquial Tibetan. Together with Gendün Chöphel, he translated Blue Annals, the lengthy pioneering work on Tibetan history, published in two volumes by the Asiatic Society in 1949 and 1954. After spending almost 30 years in India, Roerich returned in 1957 to Soviet Russia, where he made efforts to revive the Russian School of Oriental Studies. As the head of the Indology Department in the Institute of Oriental Studies in Moscow, he resumed editing of Bibliotheca Buddhica. This was a series devoted to the publication of Buddhist texts and monographs on the subject, started in 1897 by Prof. S.F. Oldenburg. In this same series A.I. Vostrikov's Tibetan Historical Literature and Dhammapada were translated from Pali. His return to Russia and acquisition of Soviet citizenship was courageous as the USSR's opinion of his family was rather distorted. Because of his effort, bans were lifted on everything associated with the Roerich family name, and the legacy of research left by the family was preserved. The first of his father's exhibitions was organized in Moscow in 1958, then spread to Leningrad, Riga, Kiev, Tbilisi, and other cities. He was able to dispel myths about the family's philosophy of Agni Yoga and start a cultural movement using this philosophy to spread Living Ethics in the USSR.http://en.icr.su/family/gnr/02.php Roerich died on May 21, 1960 at the age of 58, and his ashes were placed in Moscow at the Novodevichy Cemetery.

The Gargoyle Mechanique Laboratory was located initially at Second Ave and 4th st. where musician Steve Jones had moved after leaving San Francisco, but by 1982 had established itself at 69 First Ave in the East Village and was known locally as \\"The Basement\\". Principal artistic collaborators: Jones, Jeanne Liotta, Nick Markovich, Carmen Waldorf. Among the creative activities produced during this early fertile period was the Studio Verite Recording studio (6.66 /hr),the kabuki rock n roll band Door of Wigs (Jones, cassette tapes/Chevy guitar, Markovich, vocals, Liotta, percussion/vocals, Carlo Altomare, keyboards, rotating bass players) playing venues of the period such as the Mudd Club, CBGB's, and The Gas Station. Production of Super 8 films/performances, such as Camptown Races and radio plays such as House of Dogs written by Markovich after Stendhal, Shelley, and Artaud, recorded by Jones and featuring Waldorf and Liotta. House of Dogs was excerpted on the Telus audio cassette magazine #11 \\"The Sound of Radio\\" and was performed live with food music projections and actors at East Village club 8BC in 1984. This same year Liotta and Jones gave birth to daughter Chloe Liotta-Jones. Her 3rd birthday party at Gargoyle Mechanique's backyard alley was captured in Super8 sound by Markovich and is preserved for posterity on The Center for Home Movies (Living Room Cinema). Markovich also wrote the play CAKE, a cosmic comedy starring Waldorf, Liotta, and Ed Snyder with slide projections by Liotta and original tape score by Jones, and was performed at the New York Theatre Asylum on E. 9th st run by Raquel Shapira and Tri Garrity. Gargoyle Mechanique had a retrospective of this period of music,film, performance, and projected photoglyphs \\"from the beautiful to the backwards\\" at the Collective for Living Cinema on White St in NYC in 1987. From 1989-1993, in NYC, the Gargoyle Mechanique Laboratory was located at 28 Ave B. The thriving art space brought together, and was run by a group of artists, filmmakers and musicians, including Tim Sweet, Loyan Beausoleil, Beth Grim, Kit Krash, Sheila Smyth, Fly, Zero Boy, and Bulk Foodveyor, though led by Steve Jones (now Jones Daughs). The September 16, 1992, New York Press 'Best of' issue, named The Gargoyle Mechanique as the \\"Best 70's Performance Gallery,\\" calling it, \\"not quite communist, it's not quite socialist, and it might be but it might not be exactly communal, and the only thing that stops it from being anarchist is that they have to pay rent.\\" Harold Goldberg described the Gargoyle in his 1990 Village Voice article, \\"We shudder at the fiery blood-red walls, the Addams Family furniture, the phantom performers in the smoky half-light, the hooks, webs, and weeds hanging from the ceiling of this cabaret space. The Gargoyle is pure horror out of control.\\" But in the same article it quotes Gargoyle co-directors describing the purpose of the space, \\"We like to stimulate brains,\\" grins Steve (Jones). \\"The entire body!\\" corrects Loyann (Beausoleil). A Gargoyle Mechanique Laboratory brochure from 1992 lists various artists and events that took place in the 28 Ave B space, including the Sunday Night Open Stage, which began after the Sunday night open mic at ABC No Rio stopped taking place. Produced by this group of diverse artist collaborators, the weekly event set an unusually high bar for live entertainment production values of an Open Mic event, with ever-changing stage designs, lighting, projections, sound-scape and audio effects, always with the goal of supporting and expanding performers' intentions. Many well known East Village performers, including Roger Manning, Fly (artist), Lach, Paleface, John S. Hall, and Brenda Kahn were regulars at this Sunday night event. Internationally known artists, sculptors, poets, musicians and inspired thinkers have also shared their expressions in GMLab, from Allen Ginsberg to Jivamukti Yoga founders David Life and Sharon Gannon to Timothy Leary to John Perry Barlow of the Grateful Dead and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. According to an article in the New York Post, John F. Kennedy Jr and Daryl Hannah also visited the space. All in all, hundreds of artists from around the country and the world shared their expression at Gargoyle Mechanique Laboratory, though music, theater, installation art, exhibitions, group shows, intermedia, computer-based works, and early online media. The name Gargoyle Mechanique was partly inspired by a museum of antique mechanical toys and contraptions on the pacific coast of San Francisco named Le Musee Mecanique. The name Gargoyle Mechanique was devised in 1978 by the team in San Francisco, originally for the purpose of sending a set of gifts to another local San Franciscan arts group, Ralph Records and The Residents, and the group felt they needed an identifying moniker to do so. Original S.F. member, artist Douglas Bert Kennedy created the first logo of the shield emblazoned with the goats head. After Steve Jones Daughs had established the Gargoyle Mechanique project and identity in New York, Kennedy redesigned the logo into the bug- like-tribal-mask image. Eventually Jones altered that design, placing it inside a gear, to create what is most widely remembered as the Gargoyle Mechanique logo image. The initial San Francisco collective, located in an old Victorian-era house at the intersection of 14th Street and Eureka, a few blocks from Castro and Market, included sculptor/poet/illustrator Douglas Bert Kennedy, electronic music composer Matthew Myrle Crowe, experimental musician Steve Jones Daughs, poet musician David Davo Landazuri. In various collaboration with others and themselves, the group made music, sculpture and writings all at once. ==See also== *Collective:Unconscious ==References== * * The New York Press September 16–22, 1992, p. 106 * Nights of the Living Dead Village Voice By Harold Goldberg, October 30 - November 6, 1990 * Brochure \\"The Gargoyle Mechanique Laboratory: Even if You Turn\\" Published by Gargoyle Mechanique Laboratory, 1992 edition Category:American artist groups and collectives Category:Performance art in New York City ","title":"Gargoyle Mechanique"},{"id":"19254799","text":"Darryl Pinckney (born 1953 in Indianapolis, Indiana) is an American novelist, playwright, and essayist. ==Early life== Pinckney grew up in a middle-class African-American family in Indianapolis, Indiana, where he attended local public schools.

The series was a loose adaptation of the 1983 movie The Big Chill, and centered on the same premise as the film: a group of friends all in their 30s, who had reunited after traveling separate paths following their college days in the 1960s. Upon their reunion, they found that they were even more so an integral part of each other's lives in the 1980s. Julie and Dinah Kirgo served as executive producers, with Barnet Kellman directing most of the episodes. Hometown was produced by Kirgette Productions in association with Paramount Television. ==Synopsis== Set in Rye, New York, Hometown opened with the reunion of the seven former college friends, that took place at the wedding of two of them, the longtime couple of Mary Newell (Jane Kaczmarek) and Ben Abbott (Franc Luz). Amid all the nostalgia of radical times and the reminiscing of their youth, the group found their unwavering network of support was more important than ever, as they faced a more conservative, Reaganized America of the 1980s. Prior to the wedding, Mary and Ben had been living together for 13 years, had started a family of their own out of wedlock, and now were a modern yuppie couple raising young daughters Jennifer (Erin Leigh Peck) and Tess (Donna Vivino). Ben was a successful businessman, running a local bookstore in the city square, and Mary was on the heels of relaunching her long-abandoned dancing career. All other series principals besides the Newell/Abbott family had now either re-established their ties with the town they all attended college in, or had remained there since college and had not seen their other friends in years. The most internationally known member of the group was Christopher Springer (Andrew Rubin), the wealthy rock star who had a troubled personal life (modeled after Bruce Springsteen). Chris decided to come back to his old hometown to regain the support from his old friends and to repair his problems, while intermittently going back on the road with his band. Completing the circle was Peter Kincaid (John Bedford Lloyd), a quirky college professor; elegant, recent divorcee Barbara Donnelly (Margaret Whitton), who currently lived off her vast settlements yet was insecure about moving on with her life and reentering the dating world; Jane Parnell (Christine Estabrook), also a college professor, but in addition serving as a presidential advisor to the White House; and Joey Nathan (Daniel Stern), who was more disheveled and less successful than his materialistic friends. In the intervening years, Joey had settled into the job of a fry cook, and always proved to the gang that he was quite happy with his modest means. Joey was a single parent, raising young son Dylan (Mikey Viso), and at one point his paternity was even in question when Dylan's mother, Joey's ex-girlfriend, showed up with a DNA test. Joey's ex wanted to know who Dylan's father really was, so that if the results proved that someone else was in the picture, she could then possibly give her son a more suitable upbringing than what Joey could provide. In the ninth episode, Ben began his lobbying to run for city council, but nothing more of this development was explored, along with other plot twists, as Hometown was pulled from the CBS schedule permanently after that telecast. Hometown was filmed in Rye, New York. ==Cast== *Jane Kaczmarek as Mary Newell Abbott *Franc Luz as Ben Abbott *Christine Estabrook as Jane Parnell *Andrew Rubin as Christopher Springer *Margaret Whitton as Barbara Donnelly *John Bedford Lloyd as Peter Kincaid *Donna Vivino as Tess Abbott *Daniel Stern as Joey Nathan ==Episodes== #Pilot (August 22, 1985) #Divorce Party (August 29, 1985) #Joey's Ex-Wife (September 5, 1985) #Peter's Play (September 12, 1985) #Weekend in New York (September 19, 1985) #Paternity (September 24, 1985) #Mary's Yen (October 1, 1985) #Nobody's Perfect (October 8, 1985) #Ben the Candidate (October 15, 1985) #Fading Away Jump Shots (October 22, 1985) ==Scheduling== In an attempt to ensure that the show would find an audience, CBS premiered Hometown just under a month before the official start of the 1985-86 TV season. They immediately ran it in the time slot it was slated to have on the fall schedule, Thursdays at 10/9c. However, by the time of CBS' premiere week in mid-September, the show's ratings were unsatisfactory, resulting in Hometown moving to Tuesdays at 8/7c as of September 24; thus, the show had already failed in its fall schedule slot before the season itself had already begun. The new night and earlier hour for Hometown did little to boost the ratings, so in mid-October, CBS cancelled the series. All nine completed episodes aired on the network before cancellation. ==References== Brooks, Tim and Marsh, Earle, The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows ==External links== * * Category:1985 American television series debuts Category:1985 American television series endings Category:1980s American comedy-drama television series Category:CBS original programming Category:Television series by CBS Television Studios Category:Television shows set in South Carolina ","title":"Hometown (TV series)"},{"id":"19254858","text":"A Designated Airworthiness Representative (DAR) is a private person designated by the United States Federal Aviation Administration to act on its behalf in the certification of type certificated and amateur-built aircraft for the issuance of airworthiness certificates, special flight permits, import aircraft, export certificates for products and articles, conformity inspections and field approvals for repair and alterations.

On 22 February 1329 he was made Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer and was made Chief Justice of the Common Pleas on 3 September. He was removed from this position on 2 March 1331, however, possibly due to Edward III, who replaced important officers after he was crowned; there is, however, no evidence that Stonor was politically active. He was reappointed as Chief Justice on 7 July 1335, but removed on 30 November 1341 after another purge of the administration.

Politico.com. By Mike Allen. Published 8/18/08. It is the fifteenth book written by Woodward, the fourth in a series of books about President George W. Bush and his administration's foreign policy including Bush at War, Plan of Attack, and State of Denial. The book discusses the debate within the administration about the controversial Iraq \\"surge\\" strategy implemented in 2007. Simon & Schuster editor Alice Mayhew said in an official statement that \\"There has not been such an authoritative and intimate account of presidential decision making since the Nixon tapes and the Pentagon Papers. This is the declassification of what went on in secret, behind the scenes.\\" ==Writing the book== The author spoke extensively with officials from every level of the federal government. He conducted 150 interviews, spending three hours with Bush in the Oval Office.Woodward: Bush tried locking in strategy. Politico.com. By Mike Allen. Published 9/8/08. Politico called the Bush administration's cooperation with Woodward \\"remarkable\\". Before its publication, Woodward posted key excerpts and points of synopsis on The Washington Post's website.Pre-released Articles at washingtonpost.com Press Secretary Ari Fleischer has said, \\"The message got down to everybody: 'Talk to him'\\". Bush had decided to speak to Woodward despite the fact that he had declined Woodward's requests for his previous book State of Denial. The New Republic has also stated that General David H. Petraeus provided off the record information for the writing. ==Statements in the bookSynopsis=== The book states that President Bush \\"rarely leveled with the public to explain what he was doing and what should be expected... The president was rarely the voice of realism on the Iraq war.\\" It also calls him \\"the nation's most divisive figure\\" and described his foreign policy as a failure, saying \\"He had not rooted out terror wherever it existed... He had not achieved world peace. He had not attained victory in his two wars.\\" At the same time, the book largely supports the 'surge' strategy and lauds the President for adopting it. The book describes Bush as largely leaving the management of the war to Generals George Casey and John Abizaid and deferring to their judgment based on Bush's perception of Lyndon Johnson's micromanagement during the Vietnam War. As the generals' strategy of drawing down U.S. forces and transferring control to the Iraqis begins to fail, the book argues, Bush grows more disillusioned and sought other ideas. The book alleges that, nevertheless, the President delayed serious investigation because of his fear that leaked reports would hurt the Republican Party's chances in the 2006 congressional elections. It states that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld refused to consider resigning unless the Republicans lost control of either the House of Representatives or the Senate. After the Democratic Party's takeover of Congress, Bush allegedly delegated the responsibility for finding a new strategy almost solely to National Security Adviser Stephen J. Hadley and deputy National Security Adviser Meghan L. O'Sullivan. Against the advice of the vast majority of his staff and other administration officials, Bush finally decided on the 'surge' strategy devised by retired General Jack Keane and General David H. Petraeus. The book describes deep in fighting within the administration. ===Allegations=== Alleged comments by Senator John McCain The book reports that Senator John McCain expressed frustration with the Bush administration's Iraq policy, at one point clenching his fists and screaming at Woodward that \\"Everything is fucking spin\\" coming out of the White House.In New Book, Woodward Says Bush 'Failed to Lead,' Even as Surge Succeeded. Fox News. By Bill Sammon. Published September 04, 2008. Alleged secret eavesdropping program Woodward states that the US government has constantly eavesdropped on Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. An anonymous source says in the book, \\"We know everything he says.\\" Alleged secret U.S. killing program in Iraq Woodward asserts that the U.S. is implementing a secret killing program in Iraq targeting designated terrorists and that this program in large parts accounts for the significant drop in violence in the country. This program may have been being carried out by Task Force 77. The secrecy surrounding the program can, according to Woodward, in some ways be compared to the Manhattan Project during World War II in which the atomic bomb was developed amidst an unprecedented veil of secrecy. Following the publication of the book, U.S. National security adviser Stephen Hadley acknowledged the existence of the described strategy. ==Response== According to Nielsen BookScan, The War Within sold just 159,000 copies as of June 2009. This is far below Woodwards' earlier work State of Denial, which sold more than half a million. The New Republic has stated that Woodward is \\"lamenting\\" this drop. ===Bush administration response=== Initially, unofficial responses from members of the Bush administration's were very favorable as they saw the book as reflecting the success of the 'surge' strategy. However, National Security Adviser Stephen J. Hadley released an official statement on September 5 disputing some of Woodward's interpretations and opinions expressed in the book, though not with his record of the facts.White House quarrels with Woodward. Politico.com. By Mike Allen. Published September 5, 2008. ===Critical response=== Fox News has described the overall tone of the book towards Bush as \\"mixed\\". However, International Herald Tribune reviewer Michiko Kakutani states that it \\"reaches a damning conclusion about the presidency\\". Kakutani also highly recommended the book.Book Review: Bob Woodward's 'The War Within'. International Herald Tribune. Reviewed by Michiko Kakutani. Published September 5, 2008.

Bloomberg.com. By Craig Seligman. Published September 8, 2008.

Nintendo had little involvement in the development of these games; they were created by various other developers, including The Software Toolworks and Interplay Entertainment. Some of the titles were released exclusively for either the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), the Super NES (SNES), or for personal computers, while others were released on two or more of those platforms. The Mario educational games were generally designed for use by children in preschool or kindergarten and focused on developing skills ranging from language and typing to geography and history. The educational games were not well-received, with many critics and gamers labeling them as some of the worst Mario games ever made. Many of them have spawned Internet memes. ==I Am a Teacher: Super Mario Sweater== is a Famicom Disk System game released in 1986 only in Japan. It was designed by Royal Industries Co., Ltd., a Japanese appliance and sewing machine company. Using the program, players could design the sweater they want and the company would make it for 2900 yen (~$24). ==Mario Discovery Series== The \\"Mario Discovery Series\\" is a label given to five Mario educational games that were developed by The Software Toolworks. ===Mario Is Missing!=== Mario Is Missing! is a geography-based game released in 1993 for the PC, Macintosh, Super NES and NES. The NES version was developed by Radical Entertainment, while the other versions were developed by The Software Toolworks. In the game, Bowser sets up a castle in Antarctica, and plans to use hair dryers to melt the continent's ice and flood Earth. He sends Koopas to cities across Earth to steal artifacts to fund his operation. Mario, Luigi and Yoshi travel to Bowser's castle to stop him. Mario is kidnapped by Bowser, prompting Luigi to rescue him. Luigi progresses through the game by completing levels in Bowser's castle; each floor is guarded by one Koopaling and contains a number of pipes which transport Luigi to a city containing Koopas. Once a floor is completed, Luigi must defeat the Koopaling guarding that floor to go ahead to the next. The main gameplay consists of moving around a city in side-scrolling manner while jumping on Koopas to collect stolen artifacts (pieces of famous landmarks).http://retro.ign.com/articles/897/897225p1.html Luigi then must \\"secure\\" the city by taking these artifacts to their respective locations and correctly answering two questions about the landmark. Once an artifact is returned, the landmark is reopened. Mario Is Missing! is the first Mario game to feature only Luigi as the starring character, which did not occur again until Luigi's Mansion, a game released for the Nintendo GameCube in 2001. ===Mario's Time Machine=== Mario's Time Machine was originally released on MS- DOS but later released on the NES and Super NES. The MS-DOS version was re- released as Mario's Time Machine Deluxe in 1996. In the game, Bowser steals artifacts from various points in history using a time machine and Mario must return them back. Mario Is Missing! and Mario's Time Machine were generally poorly received. ===Mario's Early Years! games=== The Mario's Early Years! games were released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and computers. The three games were Mario's Early Years! Fun with Letters; Mario's Early Years! Fun with Numbers; and Mario's Early Years! Preschool Fun (known in the United Kingdom as Mario's Playschool). The games were released in September, October, and November 1994, respectively, and all support the SNES Mouse peripheral. The games contain Mario, Princess Peach and Yoshi on a wooden boat traveling from island to island, learning about various subjects. All three games use the same game engine. ==Mario Teaches Typing games== Mario Teaches Typing was released on personal computers and was designed to teach typing skills to children. The game was developed and published by Interplay Productions. It was first released for MS-DOS in 1992 and then for Windows and Macintosh in 1994. Mario is voiced by Ronald B. Ruben in the floppy disk version and by Charles Martinet in the CD-ROM version. The game sold over 500,000 units for the Macintosh. A sequel, Mario Teaches Typing 2, was developed by Interplay and published by Nintendo in 1997. Mario is voiced only by Martinet in the sequel. . ===Gameplay=== Mario Teaches Typing includes three selectable characters: Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach. The game displays two pairs of hands which show which finger to use; for example, if the player has to type \\"A\\", the leftmost finger is highlighted. If the player makes an error, the cursor does not advance until they enter the correct key. After time ends, the exercise ends and a chalkboard screen appears, displaying statistics on how well the player performed, including words per minute. Mario Teaches Typing 2 adds additional gameplay features, including a customizable certificate of achievement, color-coded on-screen keyboard, customizable lesson plans, and the Mario head. The CD-ROM release of Mario Teaches Typing and Mario Teaches Typing 2 feature a story in which Mario and Luigi encounter a magical typewriter. After Mario incorrectly types a phrase that would destroy Bowser's castle, the typewriter explodes into three pieces. The pieces of the typewriter are retrieved as the player progresses through the game lessons; when the typewriter is fully repaired, Mario is able to type the phrase correctly, resulting in the destruction of Bowser's castle. ==Mario's Game Gallery== Mario's game gallery features five traditional games which play very similarly to their real world counterparts but with Mario themes. The player faces off against Mario (voiced by Charles Martinet in his first appearance) in these games. While the game and its re-release FUNdumentals have been praised by some, others consider it to be one of the worst games in the Mario series. ==Super Mario Bros. & Friends: When I Grow Up== Super Mario Bros. & Friends: When I Grow Up is a children's computer coloring game featuring Mario and Luigi. It was released in 1991 for MS-DOS. Players can paint Mario and other Nintendo characters. ==References== Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Children's educational video games Category:Video games scored by Charles Deenen Category:Typing video games Category:Mario spin-off games ","title":"List of Mario educational games"},{"id":"19255065","text":"Location of Dallas County in Texas This is a list of the National Register of Historic Places listings in Dallas County, Texas.

Its final location is where CAMC General Hospital is now located in downtown Charleston, West Virginia. In 1989, Charleston High School and Stonewall Jackson High School consolidated to form Capital High School. == History 1818-1915=== There were three Mercer Schools. Mercer Academy was built in 1818 on Quarrier and Hale Streets. The second Mercer School, constructed in 1888, was on the site of where the last Charleston High building was built. This building was used as a high school from 1888 to 1890, and then as a grade school from 1890 to 1903. The date of demolition is unknown. The Third Mercer school was built on Quarrier Street in 1903. From 1876 to 1890, Union School was the first location which housed Kanawha County High School. With one principal, two teachers, and about 25 students, the first graduating class consisted of two women. Union School again temporarily housed Kanawha County High School in 1903. Kanawha County High School became Charleston High School a year later. Charleston High School was moved from its first location at Union School to the third Mercer School. This was the first building constructed for the purpose of housing Charleston High School, on Quarrier Street, in 1904. In 1890, the high school was moved to the Mercer School building on Washington Street East and this building then housed Central Junior High School, Mercer Grade School, and the Board of Education. In 1970 it became a parking lot. ===1916-1989=== The building for Charleston High School was opened in 1904Kanawha County Images, page 308and was located on Quarrier Street just off Broad Street. This later became Mercer Elementary. The second Charleston High building was on the corner of Quarrier Street and Morris Street in downtown Charleston. It later became Thomas Jefferson Junior High School when the new building for Charleston High School was built on the boundary streets of Washington Street East, Brooks Street, and Lee Street. The new building was on the site of the old (second) Mercer School. The new building was built in 1926, due to over-crowding in previous buildings. It was called, \\"the big school.\\" Even \\"the big school\\" became over- crowded during the late 1930s, so Stonewall Jackson High School was built in 1940, to accommodate the students on the west side of Charleston. As baby boom years continued, the need arose for another high school. In 1965, George Washington High School was built, to accommodate the students in South Hills and Loudendale. During the 80s, the student populations at CHS and SJHS dropped. In 1989 Capital High School opened, combining the students of these two former rival schools. This ended a 49-year rivalry. Charleston High School was torn down in mid 1989. Stonewall Jackson High School became a junior high school. During Charleston High's time, the school participated in the Gazette- Mail Kanawha County Majorette and Band Festival (then known as the Daily Mail). The school won the festival grand championship once in 1979 and has had seven majorettes named Miss Kanawha Majorette. *1981-Kelly Ellis *1979-Michelle Noe *1972-Bobbie Coleman *1970-Kay Bennet *1969-Kathy Wingo *1955-Judy Thrall *1948-Phyllis Walker == References == *Pictorial History *Alumni Site Category:Buildings and structures in Charleston, West Virginia Category:Defunct schools in West Virginia Category:Demolished buildings and structures in West Virginia Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 1989 Category:Educational institutions established in 1916 Category:Schools in Kanawha County, West Virginia ","title":"Charleston High School (West Virginia)"},{"id":"19255137","text":"The Mapúa-PTC College of Maritime Education and Training is a maritime college under Malayan Colleges Laguna established in 2008 in the Philippines which trains students in the fields of Marine Engineering and Marine Transportation.

Greenhouse gas emissions The Kyoto ProtocolKyoto Protocol To The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), an international treaty on global warming. It also reaffirms sections of the UNFCCC. Countries which ratify this protocol commit to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases, or engage in emissions trading if they maintain or increase emissions of these gases. A total of 141 countries have ratified the agreement. Notable exceptions include the United States and Australia, who have signed but not ratified the agreement. The stated reason for the United States not ratifying is the exemption of large emitters of greenhouse gases who are also developing countries, like China and India. An UN environmental conference held in Bali 3–14 December 2007 with the participation from 180 countries aims to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which will end in 2012. During the first day of the conference United States, Saudi Arabia and Canada were presented with the \\"Fossil-of-the-day-award\\", a symbolic bag of coal for their negative impact on the global climate. The bags included the flags of the respective countries.Fossil-of-the-Day Awards at UN Climate Change Negotiations Toxic wastes ===Canada=== In Canada the regulation of pollution and its effects are monitored by a number of organizations depending on the nature of the pollution and its location. The three levels of government (Federal – Canada Wide; Provincial; and Municipal) equally share in the responsibilities, and in the monitoring and correction of pollution. ===China=== China's rapid industrialization has substantially increased pollution. China has some relevant regulations: the 1979 Environmental Protection Law, which was largely modeled on U.S. legislation, but the environment continues to deteriorate. Twelve years after the law, only one Chinese city was making an effort to clean up its water discharges. This indicates that China is about 30 years behind the U.S. schedule of environmental regulation and 10 to 20 years behind Europe. In July 2007, it was reported that the World Bank reluctantly censored a report revealing that 750,000 people in China die every year as a result of pollution-related diseases. China's State Environment Protection Agency and the Health Ministry asked the World Bank to cut the calculations of premature deaths from the report fearing the revelation would provoke \\"social unrest\\".Mary-Anne Toy,China covers up pollution deaths The Age Company (Australia), July 5, 2007, retrieved 13 July 2018 ===Europe=== The basic European rules are included in the Directive 96/61/EC of 24 September 1996 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC)http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32008L0001:EN:NOT and the National Emission Ceilings Directive. United Kingdom In the 1840s, the United Kingdom brought onto the statute books legislation to control water pollution and was strengthened in 1876 in the Rivers Pollution Prevention Actand was subsequently extended to all freshwaters in the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act 1951 and applied to coastal waters by the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution ) Act 1961 The Environmental Protection Act of 1990 established the system of Integrated Pollution Control(IPC). Currently the clean up of historic contamination is controlled under a specific statutory scheme found in Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1996 (Part IIA), as inserted by the Environment Act 1995, and other ‘rules’ found in regulations and statutory guidance. The Act came into force in England in April 2000. Within the current regulatory framework, Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) is a regime for controlling pollution from certain designated industrial activities. The regime introduces the concept of Best Available Techniques (BAT) to environmental regulations. Operators must use the BAT to control pollution from their industrial activities to prevent, and where that is not practicable, to reduce to acceptable levels, pollution to air, land and water from industrial activities. The Best Available Techniques also aim to balance the cost to the operator against benefits to the environment. The system of Pollution Prevention and Control is replacing that of IPC and has been taking effect between 2000 and 2007. The Pollution Prevention and Control regime implements the European Directive (EC/96/61) on integrated pollution prevention and control. ===United States=== A polluted ditch along Interstate 25 between Colorado Springs and Pueblo, Colorado. Air pollution The United States Congress passed the Clean Air Act in 1963 to legislate the reduction of smog and atmospheric pollution in general. That legislation has subsequently been amended and extended in 1966, 1970, 1977 and 1990. In 1968 AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors. Numerous state and local governments have enacted similar legislation either implementing or filling in locally important gaps in the national program. The national Clean Air Act and similar state legislative acts have led to the widespread use of atmospheric dispersion modeling www.air-dispersion.com in order to analyze the air quality impacts of proposed major actions. With the 1990 Clean Air Act, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began a controversial carbon trading system in which tradable rights to emit a specified level of carbon are granted to polluters. Water pollution Enactment of the 1972 Clean Water Act required thousands of facilities to obtain permits for discharges to navigable waters, through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). It also required EPA to establish national discharge standards for municipal sewage treatment plants, and for many industrial categories (the latter are called \\"effluent guidelines.\\")United States. Federal Water Pollution Control Amendments of 1972, , et seq. October 18, 1972. Municipal and industrial permittees are required to regularly collect and analyze wastewater samples, and submit Discharge Monitoring Reports to a state agency or EPA. The Act requires use of best management practices for a wide range of other water discharges including nonpoint source pollution. Amendments in 1977 required stricter regulation of toxic pollutants.U.S. Clean Water Act of 1977, , December 27, 1977. In 1987 Congress added NPDES permit coverage for municipal and industrial stormwater discharges.U.S. Water Quality Act of 1987, , February 4, 1987. Land pollution Congress passed the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) in 1976, which created a regulatory framework for both municipal solid waste and hazardous waste disposed on land.U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. , et seq. October 21, 1976. RCRA requires that all hazardous wastes be managed and tracked from generation of the waste, through transport and processing, to final disposal, by means of a nationwide permit system. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 mandated regulation of underground storage tanks containing petroleum and hazardous chemicals, and the phasing out of land disposal of hazardous waste.U.S. Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984, , November 8, 1984. The Federal Facilities Compliance Act, passed in 1992, clarified RCRA coverage of federally owned properties such as military bases. Illegal disposal of waste is punishable by fines of up to $25,000 per occurrence. Noise pollution Passage of the Noise Control Act in 1972 established mechanisms of setting emission standards for virtually every source of noise including motor vehicles, aircraft, certain types of HVAC equipment and major appliances. It also put local government on notice as to their responsibilities in land use planning to address noise mitigation. This noise regulation framework comprised a broad data base detailing the extent of noise health effects. Congress ended funding of the federal noise control program in 1981, which curtailed development of further national regulations.

Cycling in Victoria has been encouraged by the development of bicycle networks in town and cities throughout the state, and many regional rail trails. The sports popularity has been encouraged by the success of racing clubs such as the St Kilda Cycling Club and Victorian racing riders such as Cadel Evans, Simon Gerrans and Matthew Lloyd. Organised rides held annually including the Great Victorian Bike Ride, and races held in Victoria include the Herald Sun Tour. == Regional rail trails == Map showing all rail trails in Victoria. Victoria also has many developed rail trails suitable for cycling including: * Ballarat-Skipton Rail Trail, Ballarat * Bass Coast Rail Trail, South Gippsland * Bellarine Rail Trail, Bellarine Peninsula * Crater to Coast Rail Trail, Camperdown * East Gippsland Rail Trail, East Gippsland * Great Southern Rail Trail, South Gippsland * High Country Rail Trail, Lake Hume * Moe-Yallourn Rail Trail * Murray to the Mountains, Wangaratta * O'Keefe Rail Trail, Bendigo * Old Beechy Rail Trail, Colac * Tyers Valley Tramway, Gippsland * Warburton Trail, Warburton * Drouin to Warragul Trail, Drouin - Warragul, Gippsland * Linear Park Arts Discovery Trail, Warragul, Gippsland * Rokeby to Neerim Trail, Gippsland ==Safety== According to VicRoads hazards that cause cycling fatalities and injuries include \\"side impact at intersections\\", \\"manoeuvring\\", \\"lane change\\" as well as collisions between car doors and cyclists in the door zone, commonly referred to as \\"car dooring\\" in Australia. In Victoria it is illegal to \\"cause a hazard to any person or vehicle by opening a door of a vehicle, leaving a door of a vehicle open, or getting off, or out of, a vehicle\\" and it is also illegal to flee the scene of such an accident. While there were 1112 collisions caused by opening doors in the Australian state of Victoria between 2000 and 2010, the first fatality occurred in March 2010, when a car door opening caused university student James Cross to be propelled under the wheels of a passing truck. Eight percent of serious injuries to cyclists between 2006 and 2010 were cause by car doorings. In July 2012 Victoria increased the on-the-spot penalty for car dooring from $141 to $352, also increasing the maximum court imposed penalty from $432 to $1408. In March 2015 stickers were placed in taxis in the state, advising passengers to look for bicycles before leaving the vehicle; at the time 13% of car dooring incidents in the state involved taxis. == See also == * Cycling in Melbourne *Cycling in Geelong * Outline of cycling ==References== Category:Cycling in Victoria (Australia) ","title":"Cycling in Victoria"},{"id":"19255203","text":"S stars, S star, S-stars, or S-star may refer to: * S-type star, a late-type giant star, a cool giant with approximately equal quantities of carbon and oxygen in its atmosphere * Stars around the supermassive black hole at the Milky Way galactic centre, associated with radio source Sagittarius A* * S*, or S star, a collaboration between seven universities and the Karolinska Institutet of Sweden to provide course material for training in bioinformatics and genomics ","title":"S stars"},{"id":"19255205","text":"800 series may refer to: ==Japanese train types== * 800 Series Shinkansen * Chichibu Railway 800 series electric multiple unit * Choshi Electric Railway 800 series electric multiple unit * Keihan 800 series electric multiple unit * Keikyu 800 series electric multiple unit * Shin-Keisei N800 series electrical multiple unit * Tobu 800 series, a variant of the Tobu 8000 series electric multiple unit ==Other== * GeForce 800M series of graphics processing units * Rover 800 Series car * Sony Vaio 800 series computers ==See also== * British Rail Class 800 ","title":"800 series"},{"id":"19255208","text":"Blues Dream is the 13th album by Bill Frisell to be released on the Elektra Nonesuch label.

The locations for such activities are generally rock platforms, though wharfs, jetties and beaches are also common. Some species such as sharks can be targeted in shallow water, however most other species prefer deep water, and this limits the areas where these types can be fished in this way. Tackle used is usually comparable to that used for these species from boats, but some differences are necessary, such as changes in rod length. Different tackle is used according to location and species targeted. The billfish (marlin and sailfish) and the larger tuna (bluefin, yellowfin) are the main target species; smaller game fish are also sought, such as Spanish mackerel, dolphinfish, wahoo, smaller tuna species such as albacore and skipjack tuna, Australian longtail. Land–based shark fishing, or LBSF, has had some popularity worldwide since the early 1900s. Sizeable numbers of participants exist in Australia, South Africa and the United States Gulf and East Coast and is especially popular in Texas, Florida and North Carolina. Commonly caught species include Bull, Lemon, Nurse, Blacktip, spinner, Tiger, Hammerhead, Sand Tiger and Mako with occasional catches of large specimens exceeding 13’ and 1000 pounds. As of 2017 multiple Great White Sharks have also been caught and tagged and historically the White was a fairly common catch for land based anglers in South Africa. Many land–based shark fishermen use catch and release techniques and participate in tagging programs to advance limited scientific knowledge of migrations and growth rates among other data. Since the early 2000s land-based shark fishing has also courted and attracted controversy, especially among coastal townships in the southern U.S. This is chiefly due to the mistaken belief that anglers attract sharks closer to shore or use chum to catch sharks. This belief is inaccurate though as the mechanics of wave and water currents do not lend themselves to effective use of chumming and baits used are not significantly larger or different than what is already present in the water naturally. Effective chumming involves spreading a long trail of significant amounts of fish blood and oils through a current to create a scent line. These trails often need to be miles long to become effective as they still require a shark to initially swim through the chum on its normal travel. This technique loses effectiveness around beach areas as wave action causes currents to travel back onto a small area of the beach, washing up the scent rather than creating a trail that can be followed. ==Locations== The best land–based game fishing is at present restricted to very few areas around the world. The best–known spots are in South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and the Andaman Islands, of which Barren Island and Narcondum volcano have produced marlin from the rocks. Along the east coast of Australia, land-based game fishing can be divided into two fairly distinct geographic regions. On the north coast of New South Wales, from approximately Sydney north, light tackle is generally used, with smaller target species such as longtail tuna, Spanish mackerel and cobia. Particularly noted are the rock platforms of Jervis Bay, where black marlin of up to have been caught using bait floated out on balloons. South of Sydney, heavier tackle is used as the target species are generally much larger, with the main targets being black marlin, yellowfin tuna, kingfish and sharks. ==See also== *Surf fishing == External links == * International Game Fishing Association * Land Based Marlin Fishing * Land based shark fishing *NOAA Fisheries Shark Website *National Marine Fisheries Services / Apex Predator Tagging Program Category:Recreational fishing ","title":"Land-based game fishing"},{"id":"19255268","text":"Tone is the debut solo album of American rock bassist and Pearl Jam-member Jeff Ament, released September 16, 2008, on Monkeywrench Records. 3,000 copies of the album were pressed and distributed through independent record stores across the United States, as well as through Pearl Jam's official website.

The sleeping Indians were outnumbered and outgunned, and had no defense against the Deseret Militia that crept in and surrounded their camp before dawn on March 5, 1849. Mormon settlement of Utah Valley came upon the heels of the attack at Battle Creek. ==Events leading up to the confrontation at Battle Creek== Pleasant Grove City Park Monument \\"in commemoration of Utah's first Indian battle...\\" At Battle Creek, now called Pleasant Grove, Utah, not long before the first Mormon settlers arrived in Utah Valley, a group of Timpanogos Indians were attacked in a predawn maneuver by Mormon Militiamen. The Company of LDS men were called from Salt Lake City on March 1, 1849, to \\"go to the Utah Valley against some Indians who had been stealing a lot of horses from Brigham's herd.\\" They were under orders \\"to take such measures as would put a final end to their [Indian] depredations in future.\\" They camped in the snow the first night, near Little Cottonwood Canyon, where a rider brought \\"word that the horses were not stolen.\\" Before morning they received orders from Salt Lake City \\"stating that as the horses were not stolen ... we need not spend any more time in search of them but to proceed with the Indians for killing cattle as had been directed, so that the nature of our expedition was not in the least changed.\\"On the Mormon Frontier, The Diary of Hosea Stout, Vol. 2 1844-1861, Edited by Juanita Brooks, University of Utah Press, 1964 In the morning the men continued southward to Willow Creek, (now Draper, Utah) and unanimously agreed to kill a beef from a cattle herd they came upon. The company enjoyed a hearty breakfast, then continued on to the Jordan River (near the border of present Salt Lake and Utah Counties) where they again camped. That day they had \\"learned that the stolen horses had returned to Brigham's Herd by one of his boys who came to inform us of the same.\\" Three times the company had now received word that the Indians had not stolen Brigham Young's horses, but they were directed to continue the mission to deal with the stolen/killed cattle issue.Stout Diary \\"The first battle between Indians and the Utah Pioneers occurred ... between the Deseret Militia and the Indians...\\" On the third day the Company crossed into the valley of the Utah Indians (Utah Valley, now Utah County) and was \\"divided into two Companies ... the better to divide and scour the country as we did not know where the Indians were located.\\" They searched unsuccessfully all day and finally camped near Utah Lake on the American Creek (now American Fork, Utah). \\"We were now all very tired and cold. No sign could yet be found of the Indians.\\" On Sunday March 4, 1849, Two young Indian braves came to the Mormon camp and were employed as guides to take the Company to those they sought. On this clear, brightly moonlit night, the Mormons followed the Provo River to the foot of the mountains then proceeded northward along the high mountain bench (above present north Orem and Lindon, Utah). They deposited their horses in a cedar grove on the mountainside and while most of the company waited near there, a reconnaissance party continued northward on foot until they spotted Indian campfires: ==Confrontation and Utes shot at Battle Creek== According to Hosea Stout: Before gunfire began, there was a verbal exchange with the Indians telling the Mormons to go away and the Mormons telling the Indians to surrender. Pleasant Grove Kiwanis Park Monument erected at the battle site. \\"...in memory of the first armed engagement between the Mormon Pioneers and the Native Americans that inhabited Utah Valley...\\" One of the young women who was spared pleaded with Dimick B. Huntington to save her brother who was still in the fray. Dimick consented and she brought her young teenage brother out of the willows. The boy was initially defiant, but Huntington threatened that if the boy didn't surrender their one gun, he would kill him. The boy retrieved the gun from his kinsmen and surrendered it. Shortly thereafter, the three remaining Ute men fled. After an overnight journey, the Company arrived back in Salt Lake City on Tuesday March 6, 1849, at \\"about 2 o'clock p.m. and were all discharged by the Colonel (John Scott) after he had given an account of our expedition to a large company who had gathered together when we came in. Amen.\\" Four days later: The settlement near the site of the March 1849 attack was for years called Battle Creek, until some time later when the Mormons living there agreed to change the name to Pleasant Grove. Here Ute Indian women and children tried to hide from the Mormon Militia by taking cover in the icy cold mountain stream water. Battle Creek has since been diverted upstream from the attack site. Its water is now used for culinary purposes by the residents of Pleasant Grove. ==AftermathCasualties=== Most accounts say four Indian men were killed, but Oliver B.

STENHOUSE. ===Bereft Indian women and children=== Huntington said: ===Captured Indian Boy possibly Blackhawk=== After the events at Battle Creek, Little Chief warned the settlers that the boy would later kill a white man for revenge. ===Nearby leaders distrust the settlers=== Old Elk and Stick-in-the-Head, leaders of local Timpanogos tribes, watched the settlers \\"relentlessly shoot down\\" the Utes. This contributed to their later mistrust of the settlers during the events preceding the Battle at Fort Utah. ==Mormon Militiamen who participated in the attack== A partial list provided by Hosea Stout, Oliver B.

Huntington, Interpreter #Barney Ward, Interpreter ==Events that led to the Battle Creek attack== On June 28, 1847, before even the first Mormon pioneers arrived in present Utah, Brigham Young met with Jim Bridger and discussed the desirability of Utah Valley. William Clayton recorded this conversation in his journal: During the westward journey: Months later: In 1847 and 1848, nearby vicinities had been explored and favorable eye-witness accounts of Utah Valley were given to Church Authorities in Salt Lake City. Then on January 6, 1849, Brigham Young (who had been absent over 1848 while helping the Saints cross the plains to Utah) sent a party of ten men to \\"go to Utah Valley to learn of its capabilities for a stock range, and when the cattle go, forty or fifty men go with them.\\"LDS Journal History Jan. 6, 1849 The party recommended waiting for winter conditions to subside. Then on the last day of February 1849, the Mormon Militia (Nauvoo Legion) was called to leave their homes in Salt Lake City and go southward on a mission which culminated at Battle Creek, Utah, and which some might consider to have been essentially a preemptive strike against the Timpanogots (Ute) Indians who resided in Utah Valley.Goes back to events recorded in Stout Diary at beginning of article == See also == *Battle at Fort Utah *Act for the relief of Indian Slaves and Prisoners == Notes  References == * On the Mormon Frontier, The Diary of Hosea Stout, 1844–1861, Vol. 2, Edited by Juanita Brooks, University of Utah Press, 1964, pages 344-347 * Diary of Oliver B.

Rosanova of Centennial, CO, and Marijo Rymer, executive director of The Arc of Colorado.Secretary of State, Statement of Sufficiency It was turned down by 62.4% of the voters. If it had passed, Amendment 51 would have amended the Colorado statutes to: * increase the state sales tax and use tax from 2.9 percent to 3.0 percent on July 1, 2009, and from 3.0 percent to 3.1 percent on July 1, 2010; * direct that the new money be used to pay for services for people with developmental disabilities and to help eliminate the waiting list for services; * prohibit the legislature from reducing the current level of state funding for services for people with developmental disabilities; and * exempt the new money from state spending limits. == Statement of intent == (1) It is the intent of the People of the State of Colorado in enacting this initiative to eliminate the waiting lists for the continuum of long-term services for persons who, through no fault of their own, have developmental disabilities, including autism, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome and mental retardation. Long term health care services and supports at a minimum could include a place to live, help with daily living tasks, early intervention care, nursing services, training and employment. Providing funding to end Colorado’s waiting lists for children and adults with developmental disabilities will enable them to receive the necessary supports to live with dignity and be fully included in community life. (2) As of November 2007 more than twelve thousand children and adults who have developmental disabilities were on waiting lists for long-term health care services and supports. Many of these children and adults wait more than ten years before receiving care. Many individuals need almost constant guidance and assistance due to behavioral or mental health problems, a lack of adaptive skills, major medical issues, and absence of family support. Further, many need assistance to eat, dress, bathe or use the bathroom. Some cannot speak or read and are seriously limited in their ability to express their needs. Still others are young children with autism who cannot access early intervention services that are so desperately needed and proven to be effective. Many of these children and adults and the families who care for them are at the point of an acute crisis due to their unfulfilled needs. The state does not provide back-up options for those in crisis, leaving many with no help at all. (3) The People find the current circumstances unacceptable and do hereby enact a slight increase in the rate of the state sales and use tax – an amount equal to one or two pennies on a ten dollar purchase – to be phased in over a two-year period. The People acknowledge that current system infrastructure is insufficient to address the needs of all those on the waiting lists. A phased-in increase of revenue will allow time to build capacity in the current system to better serve those in need. It is the intent of the People that the revenues generated by this initiative be used to serve additional persons with developmental disabilities except in the event of a declaration of a state fiscal emergency as provided herein. == Services for people with developmental disabilities == Services for people with developmental disabilities are delivered through a state and local system. The state administers the overall system; twenty local nonprofit agencies throughout the state determine a person's eligibility and arrange and provide services. Services are generally provided in the community or in the family home, and vary based upon the person's specific disability and needs. In 2008 federal, state, and local government funding for these services is estimated at $372 million. The state's share of that total is about $184 million. This allows about 11,800 people to receive services. == Waiting lists for services == There are currently about 9,700 adults and children on waiting lists for services within the next two years. That number is expected to grow to over 12,000 people by 2012. If funding to eliminate the waiting lists becomes available, a number of people who are not currently on a waiting list may seek services as services become more accessible. Thus, it is difficult to estimate the total number of people who are eligible for services and the cost to eliminate the waiting lists. == Estimate of fiscal impact  State revenue === The sales tax increase raises about $89 million in budget year 2010 and about $186 million in budget year 2011 to provide services for people with developmental disabilities. The state is also expected to receive about $19 million in 2010 and about $39 million in 2011 from the federal government to fund these services. === State spending === Amendment 51 increases state administrative costs by about $100,000 in 2009, $315,000 in 2010, and $430,000 in 2011 to oversee the services provided to people with developmental disabilities and to implement the sales tax increase. These costs cannot be paid from the new sales tax money, but a portion will be paid with funding from the federal government. Nonprofit agencies that provide services will experience additional costs of around $46 million in 2010 and $94 million in 2011. These costs include both providing the actual services to more people and startup and training expenses to accommodate the increase in services provided. The new sales tax money is expected to pay for some of these costs, with the remainder funded by the federal government. It is unlikely that all of the new sales tax money will be spent in the first several years because developing the capacity to serve the number of people who are on waiting lists will take time. Any sales tax money that is not immediately spent on services must be placed in reserve. === Impact on taxpayers === Both individuals and businesses pay sales and use taxes. Businesses pay about 40 percent of the state's sales taxes; Colorado residents pay about half; and the remaining 10 percent is paid by visitors to the state. The additional amount of taxes paid by each Colorado household will depend on a household's income and number of people. A three-person household with around $55,000 in annual income is estimated to pay an additional $20 in state sales taxes in the first year of the tax increase and an additional $40 in the second year when the tax increase is fully in place. == Results  References  External links == * https://web.archive.org/web/20080428183648/http://www.state.co.us/gov_dir/leg_dir/lcsstaff/2007/comsched/07DisabilitiesSched.htm * https://web.archive.org/web/20090324204719/http://www.colemaninstitute.org/07DisabilitiesDB1%20Colo%20leg.pdf * End Colorado Waitlist Amendment 51 Category:Developmental disabilities Category:Initiatives in the United States ","title":"Colorado Amendment 51"},{"id":"19255358","text":"Leadbetter Point is a point on the northwest coast of Pacific County in the state of Washington in the United States.

Gerard Langbaine called Cox an \\"excellent comedian.\\"Gerard Langbaine, An Account of the English Dramatic Poets, London, 1691; p. 89. His origins and early history are obscure; he was with Beeston's Boys in 1639, but nothing else is known about his early life. \\"Cox probably was a strolling or country player...\\" through much of his career.Dale B. J. Randall, Winter Fruit: English Drama 1642-1660, Lexington, KY, University Press of Kentucky, 1995; pp. 150-1. Cox had one known connection with one of the theatre companies of the era: he was one of ten men who tried to re-organize the King's Men in December 1648, an attempt that, perhaps unsurprisingly, did not succeed. Cox won his personal fame in writing and performing drolls -- interludes or farces that usually consisted of comic scenes extracted and adapted from old dramas of English Renaissance theatre, by William Shakespeare (Bottom the Weaver was one droll), Ben Jonson, John Fletcher, and many others. Cox created at least eleven drolls, with titles like Simpleton the Smith, Bumpkin, Hobbinat, Simpkin, and John Swabber the Seaman. As a performer, Cox was said to have been \\"irresistible\\" in his role of Young Simpleton.Adolphus William Ward, A History of English Dramatic Literature to the Death of Queen Anne, Vol. 3, London, Macmillan, 1899; p. 280. Cox performed most often at the Red Bull Theatre, long a center of popular entertainment. By some reports he bribed local officials into looking the other way when his drolls grew too much like plays. If so, he was not entirely successful in his corruption: Puritan authorities raided the Red Bull in June 1653 looking for unauthorized drama, and found Cox, playing Swabber.Jane Milling and Peter Thomson, eds., The Cambridge History of British Theatre, Vol. 1, Origins to 1660, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004; p. 467. The gentry among the audience were required to pay five-shilling fines to exit.Randall, p. 151. A selection of Cox's drolls, including Simpleton, Oenone, and Acteon and Diana, was published by the bookseller Edward Archer in 1656. Francis Kirkman printed some of Cox's drolls in his famous collections The Wits, or Sport upon Sport (1662, 1672). ==References== Category:English male stage actors Category:17th-century English male actors Category:1655 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Robert Cox (actor)"},{"id":"19255424","text":"Zero Hour was an American progressive metal band formed by twin brothers Jasun Tipton and Troy Tipton in Pleasanton, California, United States, in 1993.

The ponds are popular with recreational divers due to underwater visibility of up to . It has a large fish population including the endangered golden pygmy perch. Ewens Ponds has been part of the Ewens Ponds Conservation Park since 1976. ==History== The original inhabitants of the land were Aborigines of the \\"Boandik\\" tribe, part of a larger \\"Bunganditj\\" clan. The first European identified with the area was Thomas Ewens, whose dog chased a kangaroo into one of the ponds while he was hunting geese. Ewens reported his discovery of the ponds to the survey department and they became known as Thomas Ewens Spring Ponds. The land surrounding the ponds was gradually cleared for agriculture and dairy farming and a drainage system built to draw water from the ponds for land sold for soldier settlement programs post-World War II. In 1978 a trout farm was established utilising the waters flowing through Ewens Ponds. Although the ponds themselves are now part of a conservation park, the farm continues to operate. Water for the farm is drawn from the second pond, and wastewater discharged back into Eight Mile Creek downstream from the pond system. == Geography == Each pond is a basin- shaped limestone doline approximately deep and connected to the others by shallow watercourses called \\"races\\". The beds are covered with a fine silt layer and the floor of the third pond also contains a natural shallow cave. The ponds are located in a narrow band of native bush land, surrounded by cleared terrain. The landscape is characteristic of karst topography, shaped by the gradual dissolution of soluble limestone to form hollows and small caves, along with numerous large and relatively deep sinkholes (true cenotes). The ponds contain extremely clear, high quality freshwater in which snorkellers and scuba divers can enjoy the wonder of swimming in a giant 'underwater garden', where the prolific plant life can easily be seen on the far side of each pond, more than away in some areas. The clarity of the water also allows sufficient sunlight to penetrate that plant growth on the pond beds can reach up to in height. The ponds are also occasionally affected by outbreaks of blue-green and other algae, though testing has found no evidence of health risks. In 2007 the South Australian Environmental Protection Agency suggested the algal blooms may be a result of continued concentrations of soluble nitrogen in both the ponds and the adjoining Eight Mile Creek, arising from infiltration of the groundwater by fertilisers, animal waste or wastewater. ==Fauna== The ponds are one of only three recorded locations for the golden pygmy perch (Nannoperca variegata). Other fish life includes schools of short-finned eel, river blackfish, pouched lampreys, mullet and common galaxias. The ponds are also home to populations of flatworms, freshwater crayfish and mussels, and the larva of the carnivorous caddis fly. ==Recreational activities== The ponds are owned and managed as a conservation park by the Department of Environment Water and Natural Resources (DEWNR). Plant and animal species in the ponds are protected and may not be removed. High underwater visibility, the presence of rare and interesting fish, invertebrates and plants and the ponds' unique photographic potential have made them popular with scuba divers. Of particular interest in these clear waters is the actual observation of photosynthesis - aquatic plants can be seen releasing thin trails of bubbles as they convert carbon dioxide into oxygen. However divers are prohibited from entering caves or crevices on the pond beds and strongly discouraged from disturbing the silt layer as the resulting turbidity may harm plant life. Divers enter at the First Pond, drift with the current through the First Race to the Second Pond, and then continue through the Second Race to the Third Pond before exiting the water via a ladder there. However, some divers (especially snorkellers) occasionally attempt to vigorously swim upstream through the races to return to Ponds One or Two, thereby disturbing the water plants lining the races, and this practice is strongly discouraged by the diving community. The general water temperature of the ponds is around 15 °C (60 °F). ==Protected area status== Ewens Ponds and some adjoining land has enjoyed protected area status since 1976 when proclaimed as a conservation park under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972. ==See also== * * ==References * Ewens Ponds Conservation Park *Ewens Ponds (underwater video) Category:Limestone Coast Category:Lakes of South Australia Category:Sinkholes of Australia Category:Underwater diving sites in Australia ","title":"Ewens Ponds"},{"id":"19255471","text":"Feaster is a surname that many (but not all) Pfisters from Bavaria and Switzerland took after immigrating to the United States.

Although he was a fairly skilled player, he was relegated to the role of an enforcer, primarily due to his weight and size, something which was coveted by professional teams during this era of the \\"Big Bad Bruins\\" and the \\"Broad Street Bullies\\". However, there were many young enforcers coming up through the junior ranks during this period, and as a result Greig was selected 114th overall (8th round) of the 1973 NHL Amateur Draft by the California Golden Seals, and 111th overall in round #9 in the 1973 WHA Amateur Draft by the upstart Cleveland Crusaders, both, not overly high draft placings. After being cut from the Seals 1973 training camp, Greig chose to quit hockey and focus on other pursuits. However, he was called by the Seals organization during the mid 1973-74 season, and surprisingly was asked if he would report back to the Seals for a roster position for the remainder of the year. At the time, the Seals did not have a dedicated \\"enforcer\\", with the exception of skilled younger players such as Seals' rookie defenseman George Pesut who would occasionally step up and fill the role and protect teammates when necessary. However, for the skilled players, it was not deemed to be their role, and injuries were imminent. Consequently, the Seals were in need of a player with Greig's credentials and size. Greig accepted the Seals' offer and contract and joined the team in his new role. However, due to his lack of game shape at the time, he only played one game in the NHL for California in the '73-'74 season. On a conditioning stint, Greig then spent the remainder of the season (13 games) with the Seals' minor league team, the Salt Lake Golden Eagles. The following season in 1974-'75, Greig played a total of 8 games for the Seals, accumulating 1 point, and 42 minutes in penalties, before being benched and sitting out the remainder of the season. The following year seemed to signal his decline in pro hockey, as he managed 10 games with the lowly Flint Generals in the International Hockey League and 1 game with the Seals main farm team, the Salt Lake Golden Eagles in the '75-'76 season. He recorded 5 assists and 88 minutes in penalties while playing in the minors. However, in the '76-'77 season, interest was rekindled in the form of the World Hockey Association's Calgary Cowboys, who signed Greig for his fighting prowess. He played in 7 games for the Cowboys, and split the season playing for their minor league affiliate the Greensboro Generals. Following two seasons saw Greig traded to the Cincinnati Stingers and Indianapolis Racers which had the likes of eventual superstar Wayne Gretzky and high scoring Blaine Stoughton on the roster. Greig played in another 53 games in the WHA, and in the years to follow, Greig played in numerous leagues and for a variety of semi-pro teams before deciding in 1985 that his hockey career had come to an end. After retiring from hockey Greig turned his exploits to powerlifting. He holds several Canadian powerlifting records, and eventually became president of the Canadian Powerlifting Council. He owned and operated a gym in Okotoks, Alberta with his wife, Wendy.Diamond, D., Dinger, R., Duplacey, J., Fitzsimmons, E., Kuperman, I., Meagher, G., Pasternak, J., & Zweig, E. (Eds.) (1998).

Vosper served as president of the American Library Association (ALA) and won the Joseph W. Lippincott award in 1985. He was also named one of the top 100 librarians of the 20th century by American Libraries. ==Early years== Vosper was born in Portland, Oregon, to parents Chester Vivian and Anna Stipe on June 6, 1913.In Memoriam Vosper received his Bachelor of Arts and master's degrees in the field of Classics from the University of Oregon in 1937 and 1939, respectively. He then went on to pursue a degree in librarianship at the University of California at Berkeley in 1940. On August 20, 1940, he married Loraine Gjording. The couple had one son and three daughters. Vosper's career as a librarian included directorships at the W.A. Clark Memorial Library and the library at the University of Kansas, as well as the director of libraries at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) where he began in 1961.Marquis Who's Who In 1973, Vosper retired from his work at the library but continued to teach as a full-time professor at UCLA's school of library science until 1983, followed by several years as a recall professor. == Contributions to the library profession == Vosper is well known for his writings on the field of librarianship where his topics included the importance of building a strong book collection that included varied topics and other general aspects of library planning. His work Acquisition Trends in American Libraries, written in 1955, stressed that book acquisitions and collection development were important aspects of any library and should not be overlooked in favor of a deepened concentration on other traditional occupational tasks such as cataloging and reference. Vosper felt that it was important to step away from the purely mechanical aspects of acquisitions in favor of using individuals interested in the subject matter of the books in question. This was a directive that Vosper practiced in both his professional career as a library director and as a professor in the field. Another aspect of librarianship that Vosper worked to improve was in the area of interactions between libraries on an international level. During the McCarthy eraof the 1950s, Vosper became known both nationally and internationally as a member of the library profession willing to stand up for intellectual freedoms. Together with the Chancellor of the University of Kansas, Franklin D. Murphy, Vosper helped to create an internationally known exhibit on intellectual freedom. The exhibit's catalog became so well known and popular that 20,000 copies had to be printed.Kenneth Spencer Research Library In 1964, Vosper wrote for the professional journal Library Trends on the status and developments of European university libraries. He examined aspects of the American library system that he felt were lacking, such as deficiencies in the history of American libraries. Despite some of the international efforts being made at the time to improve international ties, Vosper felt that the profession was doing its patrons a disservice by not providing users with multilingual sources. He also felt that American users would benefit from understanding how libraries in Europe functioned, especially comparing the liberal access American users were accustomed to with the more controlled access available in several European nations. == Professional appointments and awards == Vosper later became vice president of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) from 1971 to 1977, as well as a board member to the Board of the Council on Library Resources, an organization created to advance modern research and university libraries across the globe. Vosper was well respected in his field, receiving many forms of recognition from his professional peers both nationally and internationally. From 1965 to 1966, Vosper served as president of the American Library Association and was awarded the Joseph W. Lippincott Award by the ALA in 1985. The Lippincott Award recognizes librarians distinguished by their service to the profession in the form of writings and participation in professional organizations, both areas in which Vosper was well accomplished.http://www.ala.org/ala/awardsbucket/lippincottaward/lippincottaward.cfm In 1999, Vosper was recognized by American Libraries as one of the top 100 Librarians of the 20th Century for his work as a librarian at UCLA from 1961-1973.Kniffle, Leonard; Sullivan, Peggy; McCormick, Edith. (1999) \\"100 of the Most Important Leaders We Had in the 20th Century\\". American Libraries. 30,11, pg. 38-48 It was during his tenure at UCLA that Vosper further developed his reputation for standing firm on his beliefs on the true function of a library that he began during his employment at Kansas University. On May 6, 1970, Vosper was under pressure by UCLA’s administration to close the library due to antiwar protests taking place on the campus. In response to these instructions, Vosper posted a notice declaring his refusal to shut the doors on the grounds that the purpose of a library was to be a sanctuary devoted to the free access of intellectual and cultural information. By choosing to keep the UCLA libraries open during such unrest, Vosper is still seen as a person committed to preserving the library and its most basic function, being a portal of information no matter the circumstances. Vosper's actions in this situation showcase the importance of upholding the ethical obligations librarians face every day. Vosper’s international accolades include becoming a decorated officer in the Order of the Crown of Belgium in 1977 and being named a Guggenheim fellow from 1959 to 1960. ==Later years== After leaving the directorship at the UCLA's library in 1973, he stayed on as a faculty member at the university's library school.Wiegand, Wayne A.

He served as an officer in the United States Army during the Mexican–American War, and also was a Union general during the American Civil War. After the war he returned to his profession as an attorney. ==Early life and career== Whitaker was born in the Shelbyville, Kentucky. He attended Bethany College in modern-day West Virginia.Eicher, p. 565. Whitaker was working as a lawyer when the Mexican–American War began.Warner, p. 555. In 1847 Whitaker volunteered for service during the war with Mexico, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 6th Kentucky Infantry Regiment beginning on October 1. He served until July 21, 1848, when he was mustered out of the volunteers. After Mexico, Whitaker returned to home to Kentucky, where he began running a large farm. He then became a criminal law attorney in Shelbyville. Later he was elected as a legislator to the Kentucky General Assembly, serving until the American Civil War was well underway. While in the state senate, Whitaker proposed the resolution that set Kentucky on the side of the Union, ending the state's brief period of neutrality in the war.Warner, p. 556. ==Civil War service== In late 1861 Whitaker chose to follow the Union cause and re-entered the U.S. Army. He was appointed the colonel of his old regiment, the 6th Kentucky, on December 24. The 6th fought at the Battle of Stones River in 1862, and Whitaker was wounded in his left elbow during the battle's first day on December 31. During the first day of the battle, his regiment defended the Round Forest as part of Col. William B. Hazen's brigade.Cozzens, No Better, p. 152 Walter C. Whitaker during the Civil War On June 25, 1863, Whitaker was promoted to brigadier general, and given brigade command in the Army of the Cumberland that August. He fought at the Union defense at the Battle of Chickamauga that fall as part of Brig. Gen. Gordon Granger's Reserve Corps, and was again wounded, hit in his abdomen on September 20. He continued to serve in Army of the Cumberland, fighting at Lookout Mountain and Rossville GapCozzens, Shipwreck, pp. 179-87., p. 314. during the Third Battle of Chattanooga on November 23 and was once more wounded in action during the fight. He was reportedly so drunk at Chickamauga that his regimental commanders had to fend for themselves.Cozzens, Terrible, p. 448. At Lookout Mountain he was also \\"deep in his cups\\" though he was sober enough to order a charge that contributed to the Union success.Cozzens, Shipwreck, pp. 183-6. Whitaker and his brigade then fought during the Atlanta Campaign of 1864. He participated in the inconclusive Battle of Resaca that spring, and received his last Civil War wound there on May 15 when he was injured by the concussion of an artillery shell which exploded nearby. He recovered by that fall and was given divisional command in the Army of the Cumberland beginning on September 19. Whitaker participated in the Battle of Franklin on November 30, 1864, and then at the Battle of Nashville on December 15 and 16, serving under Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas. On March 13, 1865, Whitaker was appointed a brevet major general for his actions near Atlanta, Georgia, on that date. He was then mustered out of the Union Army on August 24, after the end of the American Civil War. ==Postbellum== After leaving the U.S. Army, Whitaker was a lawyer in Louisville, Kentucky, again in criminal cases. He also reportedly drank to excess most of his life, and spent some years in a mental asylum after the war. Whitaker died at the age of 63 in Lyndon, Kentucky, supposedly in full mental health, and was buried in Shelbyville's Grove Hill Cemetery. ==See also== *List of American Civil War generals (Union) ==References== * Cozzens, Peter.

LeRoy, defines the internuclear distance between two atoms at which LeRoy-Bernstein theory (sometimes called near-dissociation theory) becomes valid. LeRoy-Bernstein theory is a semi- classical (WKB) approach for describing vibrational energy levels near the molecular dissociation limit. In this limit, the interaction potential between two atoms can be approximated as V(r) = \\\\mathfrak{D} - C_{n}/r^{n}, which gives rise to a simple analytical approximation for the vibrational energy levels: :G(v) = \\\\mathfrak{D}-X_n(C_n)[v_{\\\\mathfrak{D}} - v]^{\\\\frac{2n}{n-2}}. In this expression, X_n(C_n) is a simple function depending only upon n and Cn, and v_{\\\\mathfrak D} can be identified as an effective vibrational quantum number at dissociation. LeRoy later defined an expression for the radius that approximates a boundary between the region where electron exchange (quantum- mechanical) terms are prominent, and the region where atoms and molecules approximately interact through the laws of classical physics and, thus, LeRoy- Bernstein theory (as independent charge distributions and van der Waals interactions expressible as a power series in the internuclear separation). This radius is defined as :R_{\\\\mathrm{LR}} = 2[\\\\langle r_A^2 \\\\rangle ^{1/2} + \\\\langle r_B^2 \\\\rangle ^{1/2}], where rA and rB denote the atomic radii of the two atoms. For r>R_{LR}, the internuclear potential can be reasonably approximated by charge independent atomic distributions, and the vibrational levels can be well described by LeRoy-Bernstein theory. For r, there is no generally applicable expression for the internuclear potential. Likewise, there is no analogous expression for the vibrational level energies for this region and more sophisticated approximations must be employed. A derivation of a more general expression, called the m-dependent LeRoy radius, which depends on the magnetic quantum number (m), was derived in 1995. This expression yields the traditional LeRoy Radius in the special case of a spherical, S-state, atom. The LeRoy radius is described in high school level chemistry textbooks in Ontario (particularly, in Nelson Chemistry 12, which is the standard required textbook for grade 12 chemistry education in Ontario). ==References== Category:Molecular physics ","title":"LeRoy radius"},{"id":"19255711","text":"The Agricultural and Marketing Research and Development Trust (AGMARDT) was established in October 1987 by the government of New Zealand.

Accounts vary greatly as to when the aqueduct was built. One account indicates it was built between 1780 and 1790 by the Chumash Indians under the direction of a Spanish priest trained in hydrology. Others place its construction in the 1790s, and yet another indicates it was built between 1805 and 1815 by stonemasons brought from Mexico. The aqueduct supplied water for the residents of Mission San Buenaventura and irrigation for the mission's pasture and agricultural lands. Water from the aqueduct helped the mission flourish. Few vestiges of it remain today. Large sections were destroyed in a Great Flood of 1862, and settlers used stones from the old aqueduct to build homes. The combined effects of floods, land cultivation, neglect and land development reduced most of the aqueduct to rubble. The only significant section that remains is located at the mouth of Canyada canyon on land that was formerly known as Rancho Cañada Larga o Verde owned by the Canet family from 1873 until at least the 1960s. This remaining section is 100 feet long and ten feet high, and is believed to have \\"served as a siphon, drawing water uphill through conduits.\\" The location is at 234 Canada Larga Road near the road's interchange with the Ojai Freeway. In the early 1970s, the Ventura County Cultural Heritage Commission led a fight to preserve the remaining piece, declaring it a county landmark in 1972. The following year, county supervisors voted to purchase the site. In 1975, the aqueduct site was added to the National Register of Historic Places, and in 1977 the aqueduct site was fenced off to protect it from vandalism. It was also recognized as a California Historical Landmark in 1985. A controversy arose in 1989 when a newly discovered three-foot section of the aqueduct was demolished during construction of a house. The Ventura County Cultural Heritage Board sought to prevent further demolition, and the owner built his home over the aqueduct, preserving a 20-foot-long section in his basement. In recent years, preservationists have raised concerns about the failure of the county to take action to protect the remaining section of the aqueduct on Canada Larga Road. In 1998, the Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"the lone surviving significant chunk of what was once the seven-mile San Buenaventura Mission Aqueduct sits forlornly in a weed-filled corner of an orchard near a freeway offramp north of the city.\\" Though the site is owned by the county, and the head of the county's Cultural Heritage Board called it \\"an engineering marvel\\" in sore need of preservation, the county has lacked funds, and the effects of El Nino rains continued the deterioration of the aqueduct. thumb ==See also== * List of Registered Historic Places in Ventura County, California * Ventura County Historic Landmarks & Points of Interest ==References== Category:Aqueducts in California Category:Irrigation canals Category:Buildings and structures in Ventura, California Category:Transportation buildings and structures in Ventura County, California Category:National Register of Historic Places in Ventura, California Category:Water supply infrastructure on the National Register of Historic Places Category:History of Ventura County, California Category:Parks in Ventura County, California Category:Spanish missions in California Category:Aqueducts on the National Register of Historic Places Category:Transportation buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in California ","title":"San Buenaventura Mission Aqueduct"},{"id":"19255802","text":"State Highway 96 is a New Zealand state highway connecting the Southland communities of Mataura, Winton, and Ohai.

Stryker was introduced in Mortal Kombat 3 in 1995, where he is a leader of the Special Riot Control division in the NYPD and a somewhat stout- looking man sporting an often-criticized \\"urban\\" design. The character received a good deal of negative attention regarding his attire and original special moves and Fatalities. Besides the game series, he has appeared in alternate series media such as Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm and Mortal Kombat: Legacy. Stryker is one of the few characters in the Mortal Kombat franchise that do not possess any type of special powers. This, coupled with his normal appearance contrasting with the supernatural atmosphere of the series, has resulted in mostly negative reception for the character in addition to his being one of the few player characters from the first three games to not appear on any kind of official merchandise. ==AppearancesIn video games=== Kurtis Stryker is a former Marine who had served in the Gulf War.Stryker's Bio Card. Mortal Kombat: Armageddon Premium Edition Bonus Disc, Midway Games, 2006. During the events of Mortal Kombat 3, he was the leader of the Riot Control Brigade when Outworld's portal opened over New York City.Stryker's Bio. Mortal Kombat 3, Midway Games, 1995. Stryker attempted to keep order among the populace in the ensuing chaos, but soon all human souls were taken by Shao Kahn with the exception of those that belonged to the chosen warriors. Initially ignorant as to why he was one of the few souls that were spared in the wake of the invasion, Stryker received a vision from Raiden, instructing him to head west in order to meet with the other chosen warriors and learn about the importance of his survival.Stryker's Ending. Mortal Kombat 3, Midway Games, 1995. He then entered the fray with the intention of avenging the lives of the innocent that he had vowed to protect and serve. Along with the other warriors, Stryker assisted in liberating Earthrealm from Shao Kahn's clutches. He reappeared in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, still oblivious as to why he was chosen by the Gods. In the Battle of Armageddon, he fights Mileena, Kabal and Kano, yet he ultimately is among the many kombatants killed.Mortal Kombat: Armageddon In the story mode of the 2011 Mortal Kombat reboot, featuring a new timeline, Stryker is Kabal's SWAT team leader who joins Raiden and his followers in repelling the Outworld invasion. He is later killed, along with most of the Earthrealm heroes, by Sindel and subsequently resurrected by Quan Chi and forced to fight Raiden, in a losing effort.Mortal Kombat (2011) Stryker appears briefly in Mortal Kombat X as a revenant fighting for Quan Chi and Shinnok.Mortal Kombat X Design and gameplay It took Stryker several tries to break into the Mortal Kombat series. A character named \\"Kurtis Stryker\\" was to appear in the first Mortal Kombat, but the idea was dropped in place of a female fighter (Sonya Blade). This previously unused character would later appear in Mortal Kombat II with a different name, Jax, whose initial name was then finally reused for this character in Mortal Kombat 3.The Official Mortal Kombat 3 Kollector's Book (1995). Sendai Licensing. Stryker was made to be a SWAT-type character but with a sleeker design. The developers originally planned for him to have several additional weapons but memory limitations prevented this. Armageddon's early concept art and cast render showed that Stryker was to have his Mortal Kombat 3 look as his primary costume, but this was scrapped later on as this look was one of the sources of rejection over the character. He appeared in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon (2006) with a complete redesign into a much more futuristic-looking character. Stryker employs modern weaponry such as explosives, firearms, tasers and nightsticks for his special moves and Fatalities. He is considered one of the top-tier Mortal Kombat 3 characters, especially after he was given his gun as a special move in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. (This move was intended to be in the original Mortal Kombat 3, but was taken out during play testing.) Although character designer and series co- creator John Tobias thought that he would become one of the most popular characters in the game, the opposite would turn true. Many reviled his \\"common man\\" appearance and special moves as being out of place in the fantasy world of Mortal Kombat. Ed Boon claimed him to be one of MK3's \\"hidden secrets\\" for precisely this reason. Stryker was purposely given a new appearance in Armageddon in order to make him look more appealing to critics of his original design. In 2012, Tobias admitted that he himself was not satisfied with the character and personally \\"hated\\" Stryker's design and backstory, and jokingly said that if he could go back in time and redo any characters, he would do it with Stryker and Kabal. ===In other media=== Eric Jacobus as Stryker in the 2013 second season of Mortal Kombat: Legacy Stryker is one of the main characters in the 1996 animated series Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm, as one of Raiden's chosen defenders of the Earthrealm alongside Liu Kang, Sub- Zero, Jax, Sonya, Nightwolf, and Kitana. He is depicted as a gruff disciplinarian who despised Nightwolf's pet wolf, Kiva, and his nightstick concealed an electronic device that closed dimensional rips that were caused by invading realms. Stryker plays his largest role in the seventh episode (\\"Fall from Grace\\"), in which Sonya's impetuousness on the battlefield results in him being injured in combat and confined to headquarters alone with the suspended Sonya, but they put aside their differences and work together to successfully defend the base from Shokan invaders.Fall from Grace - RageQuitter87's Cartoon Coverage - Retrieved June 24, 2014. He was voiced by Ron Perlman, and his last name was misspelled as \\"Striker\\" in the closing credits. In the 1997 film Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, Stryker is mentioned along with Kabal as \\"two of Earth's best warriors\\" who were captured and killed by Rain, but neither actually appeared onscreen; Rain is then promptly killed by Shao Kahn after he admits to not forcing them to beg for their lives. Stryker and Kabal feature in more detailed roles in the first draft of the script, in which they are prisoners slaving away in an Outworld cobalt mine that is overseen by Baraka and where Kitana is being held captive. After Liu Kang later infiltrates the prison and rescues Kitana after killing Baraka in battle, Stryker and Kabal organize the revolting prisoners in fighting off the guards. This subplot was omitted from future drafts and was not included in the novelization.Brent V. Friedman and Bryce Zabel, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation first draft (May 22, 1996), p. 60-63, 80-81. In the 2011 first season of director Kevin Tancharoen's web series Mortal Kombat: Legacy, Stryker appeared in the first two episodes as a SWAT leader under Jax's command, and was played by Tahmoh Penikett. When Sonya is held captive by Kano inside a warehouse where the Black Dragon conduct their operations, he and Jax are forced to conduct a raid in order to rescue her, resulting in Stryker and his team engaging in a gunfight with the Dragons. He later visits an injured Sonya in the hospital and informs her that Jax's arms were badly damaged after having protected her from an explosion. Eric Jacobus replaced Penikett for the 2013 second season, in which Stryker's most prominent appearances are in the third episode when Raiden fills in his chosen warriors about the tournament, and in the season finale when he treats Johnny Cage's wounds before they are both ambushed by Liu Kang, during which Stryker hits him with his Taser to little effect; Kung Lao intervenes as Liu Kang gains the upper hand and is about to finish Stryker and Cage off. In a 2013 interview with Nerd Reactor, Jacobus described Stryker as \\"definitely a fish out of water ... [h]e uses a gun where everyone else has fireballs,\\" adding that the show's take on the character \\"doesn’t look like an LAPD donut-eating cop like from Mortal Kombat 3.\\" ==Reception== The character has met with persistent mixed reception since his debut in MK3. In 2008, GameDaily ranked Stryker as the ninth-most bizarre fighting-game character, calling him \\"a joke\\" and comparing him to actor Steven Seagal. Game Informer included the \\"stun gun-wielding loser\\" among the characters they did not want to appear in the 2011 reboot game. Ryan Aston of Topless Robot rated Stryker atop his 2011 list of series characters \\"that are goofy even by Mortal Kombat standards,\\" deeming him \\"utterly bizarre\\" because his \\"totally normal\\" appearance and weaponry contrasted with those of the other characters. Dustin Quillen of 1UP.com cited Stryker among \\"The Top Times Mortal Kombat Went Wrong\\" in 2012, opining the character did not \\"belong anywhere [in the series] at all\\" due to his lack of supernatural abilities. In spite of all the criticism he has received, Stryker ranked 18th on UGO's 2012 list of the top 50 Mortal Kombat characters. That same year, Complex listed him as the sixth most underrated Mortal Kombat character: \\"[He] gets some unwarranted hate for being so normal, but that's exactly why we appreciate him.\\" Den of Geek ranked Stryker sixteenth in their 2015 rating of the franchise's 64 playable characters, citing his sucker-punching of Mileena in Armageddon's opening cinematic sequence and Perlman's character portrayal: \\"[He] really became something worth caring about in the reboot, where he came off as a likeable, disgruntled smart-ass.\\" In 2010, Play magazine listed Stryker one of the characters they wanted for the 2011 reboot, Robert Naytor of Hardcore Gaming 101 praised Stryker in the reboot as being \\"so badass\\" and \\"the closest thing you'll get to being John McClane in a fighting game.\\" His ending in the 2011 reboot, in which he refuses to allow Johnny Cage to play him in a biopic following his victory over Shao Kahn and subsequent hero's welcome, was ranked eleventh by 4thletter in their 2013 listing of the top 200 fighting game endings. ==See also== *Baby Bonnie Hood *List of Mortal Kombat characters ==References== Category:Characters created by John Tobias Category:Fictional American people in video games Category:Fictional Gulf War veterans Category:Fictional Huaquan practitioners Category:Fictional New York City Police Department sergeants Category:Fictional United States Marine Corps personnel Category:Fictional police officers in video games Category:Fictional stick-fighters Category:Male characters in video games Category:Mortal Kombat characters Category:Video game characters in film Category:Video game characters in television Category:Video game characters introduced in 1995 Category:Video game protagonists Category:Vigilante characters in video games Category:Zombie and revenant characters in video games fr:Kurtis Stryker pl:Kurtis Stryker pt:Kurtis Stryker ","title":"Stryker (Mortal Kombat)"},{"id":"19255977","text":"Turner Anderson Gill (December 8, 1841 – July 18, 1919) was a Democratic mayor of Kansas City in 1875 and 1876. ==Biography== Gill was born in Bath County, Kentucky on a farm.

The term was used to classify several early Middle High German works that predated the Minnesang and the Höfische Epik. They are considered heroic and adventurous works destined for a popular audience and were long attributed to wandering minstrels, though this view has been abandoned, since the minstrels were not generally literate.

They blend history, legend, and fairy tale, but internal evidence points to a learned authorship, probably clerical.

They are generally dated based on references in the text which show that they are not earlier than the middle of the twelfth century.

It remained the tallest building in the city until 1954, when it was surpassed by the Simms Building. The building was designed by Henry C. Trost of the Trost & Trost firm, who was also responsible for several other nearby structures including the Rosenwald Building, Occidental Life Building, and Sunshine Building. It was listed on the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1978 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. ==History== The First National Bank Building was built in 1922-23, replacing an older building at Second and Gold Streets as the headquarters of the First National Bank. The bank commissioned the El Paso firm of Trost & Trost to design the building, with Henry C. Trost as the lead architect. The bank's president John M. Raynolds wrote in a letter that Trost \\"seemed to catch our ideas of what kind of a building we wanted and what kind of a banking room we wanted, and put them on paper immediately. ...We are especially pleased with the design Mr. Trost made of the exterior of the building and believe that it requires an artist like Mr. Trost to give a building distinction and individuality.\\" with At , the nine-story building was the tallest in the city and was often referred to as Albuquerque's first skyscraper. An Albuquerque Journal writer described the view from the roof of the building in 1923: In addition to the bank, the building housed offices for many of the city's most prominent doctors, lawyers, and other professionals. It remained the tallest building in Albuquerque until the Simms Building was completed in 1954. First National Bank sold the building after moving its headquarters to First Plaza in 1975, but reacquired it in 1990 and moved some of its departments back in. First National's successor First Security Bank owned the building until 1999, when it was purchased by a private developer with the intent to convert it into a luxury hotel. Plans later changed, and the building was instead remodeled into a high-end condominium project called The Banque Lofts, which opened in 2006. ==Architecture== The building's Central Ave. elevation The First National Bank Building is an L-shaped structure occupying the northeast corner of 3rd Street and Central Avenue. Architecturally, it is divided into three sections: a two-story base, a six-story main block, and a one-story crown. The base contains the original double-height banking hall and a mezzanine and is distinguished by a row of high arched windows extending all the way around the building, even into the alley. It is further ornamented with scrolls, rosettes, medallions, and moldings. The ninth floor is set off with a string course and decorated with corner medallions and a heavy cornice. The building has a concrete frame and includes a full basement and two mechanical floors. The banking lobby has a high coffered ceiling supported by two rows of octagonal columns and continues the arched window pattern on all four sides. On the blind walls, the arches are filled with mirrors to increase the apparent size of the room. A mezzanine was added on the north side in the 1940s. The lobby area was renovated into office space in 2017 but still includes most of the original details including the bank vault. ==References External links == * *First National Bank Building (Emporis) *The Banque Lofts Category:Residential skyscrapers in Albuquerque, New Mexico Category:Bank buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in New Mexico Category:Trost & Trost buildings Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1922 First Category:New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties Category:National Register of Historic Places in Albuquerque, New Mexico ","title":"First National Bank Building (Albuquerque)"},{"id":"19256025","text":"First National Bank Building, or variants thereof, may refer to: ==United States== (ordered by state and city) * First National Bank Building (Andalusia, Alabama), listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) * First National Bank Building (Monette, Arkansas), NRHP-listed * First National Bank Center (San Diego, California) * First National Bank Building (San Diego), part of the Gaslamp Quarter Historic District * First National Bank Building (Craig, Colorado), NRHP-listed * First National Bank Building (Denver, Colorado), listed on the NRHP in Colorado * First National Bank Building (Steamboat Springs, Colorado), NRHP-listed * First National Bank Building (Wellington, Colorado), listed on the NRHP in Colorado * First National Bank Building (Hartford, Connecticut), listed on the NRHP in Connecticut * First National Bank Building (Pensacola, Florida) * First National Bank Building (Danville, Illinois), NRHP-listed * First National Bank Building (Terre Haute, Indiana), NRHP-listed * First National Bank Building (Davenport, Iowa), NRHP-listed * First National Bank Building (Fort Dodge, Iowa), NRHP-listed * First National Bank (Mount Pleasant, Iowa), NRHP-listed * First National Bank (Ottumwa, Iowa), NRHP-listed * First National Bank Building (Smith Center, Kansas), listed on the NRHP in Kansas * First National Bank Building (Paintsville, Kentucky), NRHP-listed * First National Bank Building (Boston, Massachusetts) * First National Bank Building (Alpha, Michigan), NRHP-listed * First National Bank Building (Ann Arbor, Michigan), NRHP-listed * First National Bank building (Menominee, Michigan), downtown Menominee, Michigan * First National Bank (St. Cloud, Minnesota), NRHP-listed * First National Bank Building (Saint Paul, Minnesota) * First National Bank Building (Bolivar, Missouri), listed on the NRHP in Polk County, Missouri * First National Bank Building (Lincoln, Nebraska), listed on the NRHP in Nebraska * First National Bank Building (Omaha, Nebraska), NRHP-listed * First National Bank Building (Albuquerque, New Mexico), NRHP-listed * First National Bank Building (Charlotte, North Carolina) * First National Bank Building (Creedmoor, North Carolina), listed on the NRHP in North Carolina * First National Bank Building (Gastonia, North Carolina), listed on the NRHP in North Carolina * First National Bank Building (Elyria, Ohio), listed on the NRHP in Ohio * First National Bank and Trust Building (Lima, Ohio), NRHP-listed * First National Bank Building (Massillon, Ohio), listed on the NRHP in Ohio * First National Bank Building (Youngstown, Ohio), listed on the NRHP in Ohio * First National Bank Building (Stratford, Oklahoma), listed on the NRHP in Oklahoma * First National Bank Building (Tulsa, Oklahoma) * First National Bank Building (Portland, Oregon), NRHP-listed * First National Bank Tower (Portland, Oregon), now Wells Fargo Center (Portland, Oregon) * First National Bank Building, now Capitol Center, Salem, Oregon * First National Bank Building (Pittsburgh) * First National Bank Building (Custer, South Dakota), listed on the NRHP in South Dakota * First National Bank Building (Webster, South Dakota), listed on the NRHP in South Dakota * First National Bank Building (Fort Worth, Texas), listed on the NRHP in Texas * First National Bank Building (Jayton, Texas), listed on the NRHP in Texas * First National Bank Building (Meridian, Texas), listed on the NRHP in Texas * First National Bank Building (Stephenville, Texas), listed on the NRHP in Texas * First National Bank Building (Sweetwater, Texas), listed on the NRHP in Texas * First National Bank Building (Terrell, Texas), listed on the NRHP in Texas * First National Bank Building (Richmond, Virginia), listed on the NRHP in Virginia * First National Bank Building (Milwaukee, Wisconsin) * First National Bank (Rhinelander, Wisconsin), NRHP-listed * First National Bank Building (Rock Springs, Wyoming), NRHP-listed ==See also== * First National Bank (disambiguation) ","title":"First National Bank Building"},{"id":"19256064","text":"Ten ships of the Royal Navy have borne the name HMS Magnet: * was an 18-gun launched in 1807 and lost in 1809 * was a 16-gun brig-sloop, previously the French privateer St Joseph.

During the years 1608-1609 he studied in Geneva with his cousin John Casimir of Anhalt-Dessau accompanied by two tutors, Markus Friedrick Howell and Peter von Sebottendorf. Shortly after, he began his Grand Tour to France, Italy, and England. In 1618, at the age of nineteen, Christian recorded the horror of the beginning of the Thirty Years' War; in his diary, he wrote that his duty to fight was \\"ma fatal destinée.\\" For him, the war began at the Battle of White Mountain (1620), when his father was defeated and banished from the Empire. Christian was taken captive with the two regiments under his command. Nonetheless, he soon obtained the favor of Emperor Ferdinand II, who permitted him to return to Bernburg in 1621. His uncle Louis of Anhalt-Köthen made him a member of the Fruitbearing Society. After the death of his father in 1630 Christian succeeded him in Anhalt- Bernburg, which at that time was devastated by war. During the first year of his reign, Bernburg was plundered by troops under the Danish General Heinrich Holk and an epidemic fever killed almost 1,700 inhabitants. In 1636 Schloss Bernburg was almost taken by the marauding troops, but the great courage of the seventy-year-old Hofmarschall Burkhard von Erlach prevented this.

Although general relativity theory appeared to prohibit anti-gravity propulsion, several programs were funded to develop it through gravitation research from 1955 to 1974. The names of many contributors to general relativity and those of the golden age of general relativity have appeared among documents about the institutions that had served as the theoretical research components of those programs.Kaiser, D.

The existence and 1950s emergence of the gravity control propulsion research have not been a subject of controversy for aerospace writers, critics, and conspiracy theory advocates, but their rationale, effectiveness, and longevity have been the objects of contested views. ==Evidence of existence== Mainstream newspapers, popular magazines, technical journals, and declassified papers reported the existence of the gravity control propulsion research. For example, the title of the March 1956 Aero Digest article about the intensified interest was \\"Anti-gravity Booming.\\" A. V. Cleaver made the following statement about the programs in his article: :What are the facts, insofar as they are publicly known, or (as at this date) knowable? Well, they seem to amount to this: The Americans have decided to look into the old science-fictional dream of gravity control, or \\"anti-gravity,\\" to investigate, both theoretically and (if possible) practically the fundamental nature of gravitational fields and their relationship to electromagnetic and other phenomena – and someone (unknown to the present writer) has apparently decided to call all this study by the high- sounding name of \\"electro-gravitics.\\" Unknown, too – at least unannounced – is the name of agency or individual who decided to encourage, stimulate, or sponsor this effort, also in just what way it is being done. However, that the effort is in progress there can be little doubt, and, of course, it is entirely to be welcomed. The gravitics programs had not been evinced by any technological artifacts, such as the Project Pluto Tory IIA, the world's first nuclear ramjet. Commemorative monuments by the Gravity Research Foundation have been the artifacts attesting to the early commitments to finding materials and methods to manipulate gravity. The endeavor had the resources and publicity of an initiative, but writers from that period did not describe them with that term. Gladych stated: :At least 14 United States universities and other research centers are hard at work cracking the gravity barrier. And backing the basic research with multi-million dollar secret projects is our aircraft industry.Gladych, M. (1957) Spaceship that conquers gravity. Mechanix Illustrated, 53(7), 98-100, 174, 181. The writings about the gravity control propulsion research effort had disclosed the \\"players\\" and resources while prudently withholding both the specific features of the research and the identity of its coordinating body. Publicized and telecasted conspiracy theory anecdotes have suggested much higher levels of success to the G-projects than mainstream science. ===Histories=== Recent historical analysis and reports have attracted attention to the agencies and firms that had participated in the gravity control propulsion research. James E. Allen, BAE Systems consultant and engineering professor at Kingston University, referred to those programs in his history of novel propulsion systems for the journal Progress in Aerospace Sciences. Research by Dr. David Kaiser, Associate Professor of the History of Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, manifested the contributions made by the Gravity Research Foundation to the pedagogical aspects of the golden age of general relativity. Dr. Joshua Goldberg, Syracuse University, described the Air Force's support of relativity research during that period. Progress reports and anecdotes and Internet resumes of former visiting and staff scientists have been the sources of the history of the Research Institute for Advanced Study (RIAS). Former aviation editor of Jane's Defence Weekly, Nick Cook, drew attention to the antigravity programs through worldwide publications of his book,Cook, N. (2002). The hunt for zero point: Inside the classified world of antigravity technology. New York: Broadway Books. . The Hunt for Zero Point, and subsequent televised documentaries. Mainstream historical accounts of the G-projects have been supplemented with conspiracy theory anecdotes. ===Contemporaneous literature=== Lists of the research institutes, industrial sites, and policy makers along with statements from prominent physicists were provided in five comprehensive works that had been published during the early years of the gravity control propulsion research. Aviation Studies (International) Limited, London, published a detailed report about those activities by the Gravity Research Group that was later declassified. The Journal of the British Interplanetary Society and The Aeroplane published the propulsion survey and critical assessment of the American gravitics research by the internationally recognized astronautics historian A. V. Cleaver. The New York Herald Tribune and Miami Herald published a series of three articles by one of the world's greatest aviation journalists of the twentieth century, Ansel Talbert.Talbert, A. E. (1955a, November 20). Conquest of gravity aim of top scientists in U.S., New York Herald-Tribune: Sunday, pp. 1 and 36. Talbert, A. E. (1955b, November 21).

Future planes may defy gravity and air lift in space travel, The Miami Herald: Thursday, p. 2-B. Talbert, A. E. (1955, December 2). Engineers Aiming to Flout Gravity, The Miami Herald: Friday. Talbert's two series of newspaper articles took place in the midst of the policy-by-press- release era. Neither his, nor the writings that followed the five prominent works from that period, yielded denials and/or retractions. ===UFO and conspiracy theory literature=== Gravity control propulsion research had been the subject of widely published UFO literature. The documented testimonies of whistleblowers edited by Dr. Steven Greer, Director of the Disclosure Project;Greer, S. M. (2001). Disclosure: Military and government witnesses reveal the greatest secrets in modern history.

LCCN 73-83597. famous UFO researcher, have suggested incorporation of reverse engineering of recovered extraterrestrial vehicles with the anti-gravity propulsion projects had enabled them to continue beyond 1973 to successfully manufacture antigravity vehicles. Branches of the military and defense agencies have denied and refuted such claims. ==Theoretical research agencies== Talbert indicated the rationale for the intensified interest in gravity control propulsion research had stemmed from the works of three physicists. They were Bryce DeWitt's prize-winning Gravity Research Foundation essay;DeWitt, B. S. (1953). New directions for research in the theory of gravitation. Essays on gravity. New Boston, New Hampshire: Gravity Research Foundation the book Gravity and the Universe by Pascual Jordan; and presentations to the International Astronautical Federation by Dr. Burkhard Heim. DeWitt's essay discouraged the pursuit of materials that shield, reflect, and/or insulate gravity and emphasized the need to encourage young physicists to pursue gravitational research. He opened his essay with the following paragraph: :Before anyone can have the audacity to formulate even the most rudimentary plan of attack on the problem of harnessing the force of gravitation, he must understand the nature of his adversary. I take it as most axiomatic that the phenomenon of gravitation is poorly understood even by the best of minds, and the last word on it is very far indeed from having been spoken. Several articles cited his essay during and after the gravity control propulsion research period. Within a few years facilities emerged embodying the theme of DeWitt's call for increased stimuli for research. Physical principle surveys by Cleaver and Weyl stated the antigravity research was not based on any recognized theoretical breakthroughs. Cleaver's skepticism suggested an alternative rationale for establishing that research was based on a science fiction novel. Weyl charged publishers with poor journalism; attacked their terminology; and gave the highest rating for prospective physical principles for gravity control propulsion to Burkhard Heim's works. Stambler leveled harsh criticisms against Gluraheff's gravitation hypothesis. Talbert and other authors listed the following three agencies as the principal facilities that had conducted the theoretical research: ===Gravity Research Foundation=== Several articles contained expressions of gratitude for the support to the gravity control propulsion endeavor by the Gravity Research Foundation.Aero News Digest section (March, 1956). Anti-gravity Studies Booming. Aero Digest, 72(3), 6, 8.Sladek, J. (2003, February). Science Fiction and Pseudoscience [p. 16]. Berkshire, United Kingdom: Ansible E-ditions. First published in the British Science Fiction Association's Vector,62, November/December 1972. Even though the Foundation was a humble, non-profit organization, its creator, Roger Babson, used his wealth and influence to mobilize industries; raise private and government funding; and motivate engineers and physicists to conduct research in gravity shielding and control. According to his autobiography: \\"The purpose of the Foundation is to encourage others to work on gravity problems and aid others in obtaining rewards for their efforts.\\"Babson, R. W. (1950). Actions and reactions – An autobiography of Roger W. Babson (Second revised edition). New York: Harper & Brothers Publishers, pp. 340-344. During Babson's lifetime, the Foundation conducted Gravity Day Conferences each summer; established a library on gravity; solicited essays that addressed (1.) various prospects for shielding gravity, (2.) the development and/or discovery of materials that could convert gravitational force into heat, or (3.) methods of manipulating gravity;Gravity Awards (1957, March). Science p. 390. and installed monuments at various universities that cited its antigravity focus. === Aerospace Research Laboratories === In September, 1956, the General Physics Laboratory of the Aeronautical Research Laboratories (ARL) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, commenced an intense program to coordinate research into gravitational and unified field theories with the hiring of Joshua N. Goldberg. Creation by ARL of Goldberg's program may have been coincidental to Talbert's disclosures of commitments to gravity control propulsion research. The precise rationale for creating the program and justifying its budgets and personnel may never be determined. Neither Goldberg nor the Air Force's Deputy for Scientific and Technical Information, Walter Blados, were able to locate the founding documents. Roy Kerr, a former ARL scientist, stated the antigravity propulsion purpose of ARL was \\"rubbish\\" and that \\"The only real use that the USAF made of us was when some crackpot sent them a proposal for antigravity or for converting rotary motion inside a spaceship to a translational driving system.\\"Kerr, R. P. (2007, June 8). Discovering the Kerr and Kerr-Schild metrics. arXiv: 0706.1109v1 [gr-qc]. The December 30, 1957 issue of Product Engineering closed its report with the following statement: :Nevertheless, the Air Force is encouraging research in electrogravitics, and many companies and individuals are working on the problem. It could be that one of them will confound the experts. During the following sixteen years, its name was changed to the Aerospace Research Laboratories. The ARL scientists produced nineteen technical reports and over seventy peer-reviewed journal articles.A list of forty papers was disclosed to the author on December 2, 2004 by Dr. Boyko V. Ivanov. Subsequent literature reviews expanded it to over seventy. The Air Force's Foreign Technical Division,Radzievskiy, V. V. and Kagal'Nikova, I. I. (1964, May 8). The nature of gravitation.

Greenwich, Connecticut: Fawcett Publications, pp. 138-139. investigated storiesSchwartz, H. (1958, March 2). Russian reports a gravity theory. The New York Times. P. L-17. about Soviet attempts to understand gravity. Such actions were consistent with the paranoia of the Cold War. The funding for the military components of the gravity control propulsion research had been terminated by the Mansfield Amendment of 1973. Black project experts, conspiracy theorists, and whistleblowers had suggested the gravity control propulsion efforts had achieved their goals and had been continued decades beyond 1973. === Research Institute for Advanced Study (RIAS) === The Research Institute for Advanced Study (RIAS) was conceived by George S. Trimble, the vice president for aviation and advanced propulsion systems, Glenn L. Martin Company, and was placed under the direct supervision of Welcome Bender. The first person Bender hired was Louis Witten internationally recognized authority on gravitation physics.Bass, R. W. (2002, Spring/Summer). Some reminiscences of control and system theory in the period 1955-1960: Introduction of Dr. Rudolf E. Kalman. Real Time [pp. 2-6]. Huntsville, Alabama: Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Alabama in Huntsville. Talbert's article had announced Trimble's completion of contractual agreements with Pascual Jordan and Burkhard Heim for RIAS. Subsequent hires yielded a half dozen gravity researchers known as the field theory group. Sir Arthur C. Clarke and others stated RIAS' assemble of talent was very qualified for the task of discovering new principles that could be used to develop gravity control propulsion systems. The quest for propulsion through gravity control was vaguely implied in various publications. Works by Cook and Cleaver summarized statements in the RIAS brochures. Cook had equated the broad range of RIAS's mission statements with those of Skunk Works. In 1958, Mallan reported \\"the control of the force of gravity itself for propulsion\\" was one of the unorthodox goals initiated by Trimble for RIAS.Mallan, L. (1958). Space satellites (How to book 364). Greenwich, Connecticut: Fawcett Publications, pp. 9-10, 137, 139. LCCN 58-001060. RIAS was renamed the Research Institute for Advanced Studies during the sixties when the American-Marietta Company merged with Martin to become the Martin Marietta Company. The 1995 merger that yielded the Lockheed Martin Company modified its goals and not its name. ==Aerospace firms== Talbert's newspaper series and subsequent articles in technical magazines and journals listed the names of aerospace firms conducting gravity control propulsion research. The Gravity Research Group indicated those companies had constructed \\"rigs\\" to improve the performance of Thomas Townsend Brown's gravitators through attempts to develop materials with high dielectric constants (k). Gravity Rand Limited provided a set of guidelines to help management conduct research and nurture creativity. Articles about the gravity propulsion research by the aerospace firms ceased after 1974. None of the companies featured in those publications had filed retractions. The following aerospace firms have been cited in the works published from 1955 through 1974: *Bell Aircraft, Buffalo, New York. *Boeing Aircraft. *Clarke Electronics, Palm Springs, California. *Convair, San Diego. *Douglas Aircraft. *Electronics Division, Ryan Aeronautical Company, San Diego. *General Electric. *Glenn L. Martin Company, Baltimore, Maryland. *Gluhareff Helicopter & Airplane Corporation, Manhattan Beach, California. *Grumman Aircraft.Research section (February 8, 1958). How to 'fall' into space. Business Week, (no. 1484) pp. 51-53. *Hiller Aircraft. *Hughes Aircraft. *Lear Incorporated, Santa Monica, California. *Lockheed Aircraft Corporation. *Radio Corporation. *Sikorsky Division of United Aircraft. *Sperry Gyroscope Division of Sperry Rand Corporation, Great Neck, Long Island. ==Reported breakthroughs== None of the reported experimental breakthroughs published during the 1950s and 1960s have been recognized by the aerospace community. ===Experimental=== Brown's gravitator Various reports indicated Brown's gravitators were the main experimental focus of the gravity control propulsion research. According to G. Harry Stine and Intel, research on Brown's gravitators became classified immediately after demonstrations of 30% weight reductions. Thomas Townsend Brown had obtained a British patent for high voltage, symmetric, parallel plate capacitors, that he called gravitators, in 1928.Brown, T. T. (1928, November 15). Great Britain Patent No. 300,311. Brown claimed they would produce a net thrust in the direction of the anode of the capacitor that varied slightly with the positions of the Moon. The scientific community rejected such claims as products of pseudoscience and/or misinterpretations of ion wind effects. Independent research found small amounts of lift from Brown's gravitator based on an inefficient use of ionic propulsion. The devices were named Ion Lifters or Ionocraft and were reported to be able to lift the empty shell of a vehicle under ideal conditions, but not the additional machinery required to generate the electric field. Gravity effects were not found in the independent research. Kaplan's gravity-like impulses In July 1960, Missiles and Rockets reported Martin N. Kaplan, Senior Research Engineer, Electronics Division, Ryan Aeronautical Company, San Diego, had conducted anti- gravitational experiments yielding the promise of impulses, accelerations, and decelerations one hundred times the pull of gravity. Neither comments nor criticism of the report appeared in subsequent articles during the period of intensified gravity control propulsion research (see Section 1 of tractor beam for similar reports). ===Theoretical=== Forward's protational field Robert L. Forward, Hughes Research Laboratories, Malibu, described the theoretical generation of dipole gravitational fields by accelerating a super- dense fluid through pipes wound around a torus. ==Legacies== Many of the contributors to general relativity have been supported by and/or associated with the ARL, RIAS, and/or the Gravity Research Foundation. The decades preceding the 1955 revelation of the gravity control propulsion research were a low water mark for general relativity.Eisenstaedt, J. (1989). The low water mark of general relativity, 1925-1955. In D. Howard and J. Stachel (Ed.), Einstein and the History of General Relativity (pp. 277-292). Boston: Birkhäuser. The following summarizes how the components of that research had stimulated the resurgence of general relativity: ===Gravity Research Foundation=== Even though some of the physicists who attended the Gravity Day Conferences quietly mocked the anti-gravity mission of the Foundation,Kaiser, D. (1999). Roger Babson and the rediscovery of general relativity. Fifth International Conference on the History and Foundations of General Relativity. University of Notre Dame, Indiana. it provided significant contributions to mainstream physics.Witten, L. (1998). Introductory remarks on the gravity research foundation on its fiftieth anniversary. Presented at the 15th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation. In N. Dadhich and J. Narlikar (Ed.) Gravitation and relativity: at the turn of the millennium (p. 375). Pune, India: Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics. The International Journal of Modern Physics D has featured selected papers from the Gravity Research Foundation essay competition. Many have been incorporated with the collections of the Niels Bohr Library. A few of the Foundation essay contest winners became Nobel laureates (e.g., Ilya Prigogine, Maurice Allais, George F. Smoot). Foundation essays have been among the resources graduate students check for new ideas. Kaiser summarized the Foundation's influence in the following manner: :Despite the vast conceptual gulf separating Babson from the new generation of relativists, we are left with intriguing, and perhaps ironic associations: by organizing conferences, sponsoring the annual essay contests, and making money and enthusiasm widely available for people interested in gravity, the eccentric Gravity Research Foundation may claim at least some small amount of the credit for helping to stimulate the postwar resurgence of interest in gravitation and general relativity. Foundation trustee, Agnew Bahnson, contacted Dr. Bryce DeWitt with a proposal to fund the creation of a gravity research institute.Confirmed on April 12, 2004 via private communication with Dr. David Kaiser. DeWitt had won the first prize for the 1953 essay contest. The proposed name was changed to the Institute for Field Physics and it was established in 1956 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill under the direction of Bryce and his wife, Cécile DeWitt-Morette.CWP at physics.UCLA.edu // Cecile DeWitt- Morette at cwp.library.ucla.edu The peer reviewed physics journal, Physica C, published a report by Eugene Podkletnov and Nieminen about gravity-like shielding. Although their work had gained international attention, researchers were not able to replicate Podkletnov's initial conditions. But, analyses by Giovanni Modanese and Ning Wu indicated various applications of quantum gravity theory could allow gravitational shielding phenomena. Those achievements have not been pursued by the scientific community. ===Aerospace Research Laboratories (ARL)=== The list of prominent contributors to the golden age of general relativity, contains the names of several scientists who had authored the nineteen ARL Technical Reports and/or seventy papers. The ARL sponsored papers were published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Physical Review, Journal of Mathematical Physics, Physical Review Letters, Physical Review D, Review of Modern Physics, General Relativity and Gravitation, International Journal of Theoretical Physics, and Nuovo Cimento B. Some of the ARL papers were written in collaboration with RIAS, the U.S. Army Signal Research and Development Laboratory at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, and the Office of Naval Research. The ARL had provided significant enhancements to general relativity theory. For example, Roy Kerr's description of the behavior of space-time in the vicinity of a rotating mass was among those works. Goldberg concluded: \\"However, it should be recognized that, in the United States, the Department of Defense played an essential role in building a strong scientific community without widespread encroachment on academic values.\\" ===Research Institute for Advanced Studies (RIAS)=== The growth of nonlinear differential equations during the fifties was stimulated by RIAS. One of the leading groups in dynamical systems and control theory, the Lefschetz Center for Dynamical Systems, was a spinoff from RIAS. After the launch of Sputnik, world-class mathematician Solomon Lefschetz came out of retirement to join RIAS in 1958 and formed the world's largest group of mathematicians devoted to research in nonlinear differential equations. The RIAS mathematics group stimulated the growth of nonlinear differential equations through conferences and publications. It left RIAS in 1964 to form the Lefschetz Center for Dynamical Systems at Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island. ==UFO and conspiracy theories== On May 9, 2001, Mark McCandlish testified on the televised news conference held by the Disclosure Project, at the National Press Club, Washington, D.C. He stated gravity control propulsion research had started in the 1950s and had successfully reverse engineered the vehicle retrieved from the Roswell crash site to build three Alien Reproduction Vehicles (ARVs) by 1981.Google Image Result for http://www.coasttocoastam.com/timages/page/mark092705a.jpg at www.coasttocoastam.com McCandlish described their propulsion systems in terms of Thomas Townsend Brown's gravitators and provided a line drawing of its interior. The diagram closely resembled the drawing provided earlier in Milton William Cooper's book. Another Disclosure Project whistleblower, Philip J. Corso, stated in his book the craft retrieved from the second crash site at Roswell, New Mexico, had a propulsion system resembling Thomas Townsend Brown's gravitators. And, Corso's book featured several gravity control propulsion statements made by Hermann Oberth. Soon after the end of the Cold War, a small group of scientists and engineers openly expressed their desire to use technologies developed by black projects for civil applications. Steven Greer formed the Disclosure Project in 1995 to help those and other research whistleblowers share their information with and to petition Congress. By 2001, it had provided reports to two Congressional hearings and had acquired over 400 members from branches of the military and aerospace industry. During the early 1960s, Keyhoe published excerpts from a letter by Hermann Oberth that presented explanations for the flight characteristics of UFOs in terms of gravity control propulsion. Prior to Oberth's letter, Keyhoe had supported arguments for magnetic forces as the source of propulsion for UFOs. The letter caused him to search for the existence of gravity control propulsion research programs. The following is a segment of his findings he had released in his 1966 and 1974 publications: :When AF [air force] researchers fully realized the astounding possibilities, headquarters persuaded scientists, aerospace companies and technical laboratories to set up anti-gravity projects, many of them under secret contracts. Every year, the number of projects increased. In 1965, forty-six unclassified G-projects were confirmed to me by the Scientific Information Exchange of the Smithsonian Institution. Of the forty-six, thirty- three were AF-controlled. During his press conferences on February 2, 1955, in Bogotá and February 10, 1955, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, aviation pioneer William Lear stated one of his reasons for believing in flying saucers was the existence of American research efforts into antigravity.Dolan, R. M. (2002). UFOs and the national security state: Chronology of a cover-up 1941–1973 [Revised Edition]. Charlottesville, Virginia: Hampton Roads Publishing Company, Inc. . Talbert's series of newspaper articles about the intensified interest in gravity control propulsion research were published during the Thanksgiving week of that year. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Yi, Y.

His YouTube videos have been seen over 100 million times and he has over 200,000 subscribers. In December 2007, Corey was one of the first Canadians to join the YouTube Partnership Program. In February 2013 he was named Niagara's Entrepreneur of the Year in Innovative Small Business for his video production company ApprenticeA Productions. He is the founder of Buffer Festival. ==YouTube career== Corey Vidal began on YouTube in mid-2006 by posting hip hop dance videos inspired by American dance reality television show So You Think You Can Dance. His popularity stemmed from the success of one of his first videos, How To Dance: \\"1, 2 Step\\" by Ciara (uploaded to YouTube on September 3, 2006), where he teaches dance steps to R&B; singer Ciara's music video 1, 2 Step. The video currently has over 6.5 million views. Following his How To Dance series, Corey branched into other types of videos. His channel career spans dancing, singing, playing musical instruments, beatboxing, acting in skits and short films (including a short film production by Niagara College), solving Rubik's Cubes, video blogging, and collaborating with other YouTubers. Many of his videos contain references to the Star Wars franchise. Microsoft Canada has contributed to one of Corey's videos, and MTV Europe contacted him to produce an exclusive video to appear in their televised series MTV's Best.Show.Ever in 2007. In December 2008, Corey produced a 4-part a cappella Christmas e-card for California-based consulting firm Barbary Coast Consulting. In May 2009, Vidal released a 33-part interactive choose-your-own-adventure-style video as part of a collaboration with Blendtec, the company behind Will It Blend?. Lucasfilm is now a sponsor of Vidal's channel. Corey first gained national Canadian media attention in the summer of 2008 when he was announced as the host of the 888 YouTube Gathering that took place August 8, 2008 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Corey hosted a one-hour show featuring many of YouTube's most popular \\"cewebrities\\", including KevJumba, HappySlip, Dave Days, Charles Trippy, Shay Carl, Philip DeFranco, and more. Corey Vidal launched a second, daily-vlogging YouTube channel on January 1, 2011 called \\"ApprenticeEh\\", where he and the staff members of his company recorded and shared their lives every day. On January 1, 2017, the ApprenticeEh channel ended after 2,192 consecutive days of vlogging. ApprenticeEh operates out of Burlington, Ontario. Corey appeared in the 2012 edition of the annual Ripley's Believe It or Not! book series for his work on YouTube. In 2013, ApprenticeA Productions launched Buffer Festival, a film festival catered toward YouTubers. ApprenticeA Productions partnered with Shay Carl to produce Vlogumentary, a feature-length documentary film about online video fame. It was picked up by Executive Producer Morgan Spurlock and released in 2016 exclusively on YouTube Red. ==Star Wars (John Williams Is The Man) A Cappella Tribute== A notable success is his most popular video, a Star Wars a cappella tribute to composer John Williams - a video of Vidal lip- syncing to a song written in 1999 and recorded in 2002 by a cappella comedy troupe Moosebutter. The video was featured on YouTube Canada's homepage on November 3, 2008, and then again on the Worldwide homepage three days later. It appeared on the homepage of MSN.com, and was featured by MSN Videos and StupidVideos.com. As of February 2013, the video has been viewed over 17 million times since its upload on October 27, 2008. The video quickly became Canada's #1 Top Rated (All Time) and #1 Top Favorited (All Time) Entertainment video, and received many other All Time Honors both in Canada and Worldwide. It was also ranked as one of YouTube's Top 100 Rated videos of All Time, although YouTube retired the Honors system in November 2011. The Maclean's Book of Lists named it in their list of '10 Canadian viral sensations' in 2012. On December 7, 2008 the video was nominated for a 35th Annual People's Choice Awards on CBS as \\"Favorite User Generated Video\\" of 2008. It faced competition in its category from other viral videos such as Barack Roll, Fred Goes Swimming, Where the Hell is Matt? (2008), and Wassup 2008. Vidal attended the red carpet event in Los Angeles on January 7, 2009. ==Copyright disputes== Corey is known on YouTube for his multiple Digital Millennium Copyright Act disputes between the content in his videos and copyrighted works owned by major studios and labels. To date, he has fought and won every claim made against his videos. ===4 Minutes=== The first claim came from Warner Music Group in April 2008 over the use of Madonna's song 4 Minutes in one of his hip hop dance videos. The video was removed from YouTube by Warner a month after it being uploaded, having received over 200,000 views. Vidal fought Warner with an official DMCA counter-claim, filed through YouTube's copyright system. Two weeks after his claim was made, Madonna herself uploaded a video to her official YouTube channel titled Madonna's Message To YouTube saying \\"So all you people out there who are making videos to my single 4 Minutes, keep up the good work. Nice job, nice one, OK. But you got to clean up after yourself, alright?\\" Corey forwarded this video to YouTube's copyright department as well as Warner Music Group's legal team, and on May 9, 2008 his video was restored in full, with no penalties held against his account. After a falling-out between YouTube and Warner Music Group in early 2009, Warner pulled down every video on YouTube that contained any of their material. This included a complete purging of Madonna's YouTube account and all her videos, including the official music video to 4 Minutes as well as Madonna's message to YouTube. However, because Corey's claim had legally won in 2008, they were unable to remove his video. It currently has over 4 million views. Madonna's response video has since been restored. ===John Williams/Star Wars A Cappella Tribute=== In mid-January 2009, Corey's Star Wars A Cappella video was removed from YouTube due to a DMCA copyright infringement claim by Warner Music Group. His entire account and all of his videos were suspended, then returned three days later, however the a cappella video remained banned and unviewable. For over a month, the official video was unavailable on YouTube, but copies were spread around the Internet by other uploaders on YouTube and other media sites. On February 24, 2009 the original video returned after Corey Vidal fought Warner's claim, citing the video as being protected under fair use. The video was restored with its original views, ratings, and comments. ==Awards and nominations== {  - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" - ! Year ! Nominated work ! Category ! Award !

It was not until the age of 31 that he made his first-class cricket debut, picked to play against a Bob Willis led England XI. In a match that Queensland won, he dismissed the Test player Graeme Fowler for single figures in both innings and as well as David Gower twice. Even though he was picked primarily as a fast- medium bowler, he managed to top score for Queensland in their first innings. His 57 runs, which came off just 36 deliveries and included five sixes, ended when he was bowled by Norman Cowans. As a result of his strong showing against England, Frei made his Sheffield Shield debut the following week and went on to take 20 wickets at 38.75 for the 1982/83 season. He performed better in Queensland's 1983/84 Shield campaign with 23 wickets at 24.08, helping them to their first final, which they lost to Western Australia.

Prior to entering electoral politics, he had served civil service and judicial service, having been appointed Permanent Secretary of Justice (the highest non-elected position in the civil service) in 2000 by the government of Chuan Leekpai. Following his retirement from office in 2006 owing to the pensionable age, he entered politics after the 2006 coup unseating the government of his brother-in-law, Thaksin Shinawatra. He joined the PPP which won the December 2007 parliamentary elections, becoming Minister of Education and Senior Deputy Prime Minister. After the premiership of Samak Sundaravej had been terminated by the ConCourt for contravening the conflict of interests law, Somchai was successfully nominated Prime Minister. His government had to deal with the 2008 Thailand political crisis as well as the global financial crisis of 2008, and the PPP was eventually dissolved by the ConCourt and its executive members, including Somchai, were prohibited from politics for five years for vote-buying committed by Yongyuth Tiyapairat. ==Family life== Somchai was born at Amphoe Chawang, Nakhon Si Thammarat Province, a son of Mr. Choem and Mrs. Dap (Sutsai) Wongsawat. He is a brother-in-law of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra, having married their sister Yaowapha. The couple have three children, Mr. Yotchanan Wongsawat, Ms. Chinnicha Wongsawat and Mrs. Chayapha Nam. Somchai's wife Yaowapha previously served as an MP in the Thai Rak Thai Party led by her older brother, Thaksin Shinawatra. Like one hundred and ten other members of the party, she was banned from participating in politics for a five-year period by the order of the Constitutional Tribunal because of the party's violation of election laws. ==Education== Somchai completed his primary education in his home town, and his secondary education at Amnuay Silpa School in Bangkok. He received a bachelor of law from Faculty of Law, Thammasat University in 1970, becoming a barrister-at-law of the Thai Bar Association in the next three year. He achieved his master of Public Administration from the National Institute of Development Administration in 2002. ==Career== Somchai Wangsawat meeting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in New Delhi in 2008 ===Public service=== Somchai has been appointed to various offices in the juridical service and the civil service, including inter alia: assistant judge of the Ministry of Justice in 1974, ministerial justice in the next year, justice of Chiang Mai's Provincial Court in 1976, justice of Chiang Mai in 1978, justice of Chiang Rai in 1983, chief of the Bench of Phang Nga's Provincial Court in 1986, chief of the Children and Juvenile Court of Rayong in 1987, chief of Chon Buri's Provincial Court in 1988 and of Nonthaburi's Provincial Court in the next year, and chief of the Bench of Thon Buri's Criminal Court in 1990, respectively. Somchai held office as judge of the 3rd Region's Appealate Court in 1993 and chief of the Bench of the 2nd Region's Appealate Court in 1997. In 1998 Somchai was appointed as the Deputy Permanent Secretary of Justice for Academic Affairs, and later for Administrative Affairs. He became the Permanent Secretary of Justice on 11 November 2000, and was transferred to become the Permanent Secretary of Labor from 8 March to 30 September 2006, the date he retired from the public service after reaching pensionable age. Somchai has been since appointed inter alia chairperson of the law committee of the National Research Council of Thailand, member of the Thai Bar Association's committee, member of the Board of Thailand's Electricity Generation Authority, member of the Board of the Narcotics Prevention and Suppression Board, member of the Money Laundering Prevention and Suppression Board, member of the committee of the Council of State of Thailand, member of the Board of Policy of the National Thai Police, member of the Civil Service Board of Thailand, member of the Juridical Service Board of Thailand, and member of the National Official Information Board of Thailand. ===Premiership=== A member of the People Power Party, he was the deputy leader of the Party in 2007 and held office as the Minister of Education in the Next Year and Senior Deputy Prime Minister. Somchai became the Prime Minister on 9 September 2008, upon the Constitutional Court's decision that the premiership of Samak Sundaravej had been terminated for his having worked as the emcee of two cooking shows while in office, in violation of the law forbidden government ministers from holding any other paid employment. On 17 September 2008, Somchai was elected Prime Minister of the Country by the National Assembly, receiving 298 favourable votes, more than the 163 votes for Abhisit Vejjajiva. King Bhumibol Adulyadej issued a Royal Proclamation appointing Somchai as the 26th Prime Minister on 18 September 2008. Siege On 7 October 2008, anti-government protesters attempted to hold 320 parliamentarians and senators hostage inside the Parliament building, cutting off power. Somchai Wongsawat escaped by climbing a rear fence after his policy address. Other legislators were trapped inside. The 6-week sit-in and siege on the area next to the prime minister’s office led the government to transfer its activities temporarily to Don Muang. Eventually, Somchai authorised the police to use force against the demonstrations. Thousands were injured, some seriously, and two protestors died, one a young woman; both were killed by exploding police gas grenades, which also maimed a number who lost limbs. Investigation On 29 September, Thailand's Election Commission spokesman Ruangrote Jomsueb said a subcommittee would investigate Somchai (30 days probe, to the Constitutional Court) per Senator Ruangkrai Leekijwattanaon's complaint on \\"whether Somchai violated the constitution by holding shares in Thailand's CS LoxInfo PCL, an Internet service provider that is a contract partner of CAT Telecom, a state-owned telecommunications service provider.\\" The Thai constitution bars parliament members from holding shares in companies that do business with state enterprises, and if found guilty, Somchai would be disqualified as parliament member and ousted as prime minister. ===Neglected duty and removal=== On 17 October, Thailand's anti- corruption body found Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat guilty of neglecting his duties while working in the justice department eight years ago. Members of the National Counter Corruption Commission said Somchai was wrong to suspend a corruption investigation into two senior officials while he was a permanent secretary at the justice ministry in 2000. The NCCC's investigation followed a complaint lodged by senior judge Chamnan Rawiwanpong after he petitioned for an investigation into alleged corruption involving a land sale in Pathum Thani province in 2000. After the petition, Somchai set up a disciplinary panel, accusing Chamnan of serious wrongdoing and recommending he be fired, prompting Chamnan to make the counter-complaint. ==Somchai Cabinet== The Cabinet was active from 18 September 2008 – 2 December 2008. { class=\\" sortable collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"text-align: center\\" ! colspan=\\"1\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\"  Position ! colspan=\\"1\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\"  Name ! colspan=\\"1\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\"  Party - bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\"  Prime Minister and Defense minister  Somchai Wongsawat  PPP - bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\"  Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs  Sompong Amornwiwat  PPP - bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\"  Deputy Prime Minister  Chaovarat Chanweerakul  PPP -bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\"  Deputy Prime Minister  Olarn Chaiprawat  ? - bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\" -  Deputy Prime Minister  Major General Sanan Kachornprasart  CTP -  Minister for Office of the Prime Minister  Sukhumpong Ngonkham  PPP - bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\"  Minister for Office of the Prime Minister  Suphol Fongngam  PPP -  Minister of Finance  Suchart Thadathamrongvej  PTP - bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\"  Deputy Minister of Finance  Pradit Pattaraprasit  RJTCP -  Deputy Minister of Finance  Second Lieutenant Ranongrak Suwanchawi  PPD -  Minister of Tourism and Sports  Weerasak Kowsurat  CTP -  Minister of Social Development and Human Security  Udomdej Rattanasathien  PPP - bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\"  Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives  Somsak Prissanananthakul  CTP -bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\"  Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives  Sompat Kaewpichit  CTP - bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\"  Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives  Teerachai Saenkaew  PPP -  Minister of Transport  Santi Promphat  PPP -  Deputy Minister of Transport  Sopon Saram  PPP - bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\"  Deputy Minister of Transport  Warawut Silpa-archa  CTP -  Minister for Natural resource and Environment  Anongwan Thepsuthin  MCMP - bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\"  Minister of Information and Communication Technology  Man Pattanotai  PPD - bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\"  Minister for Energy  Wannarat Channukul  RJCPP -  Minister of Commerce  Chaiya Sasomsap  PPP - bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\"  Deputy Minister of Commerce  Police Lieutenant Colonel Banyin Tangphakorn  MCMP - bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\"  Deputy Minister of Commerce  Songkram Kitlertpairot  PPP - bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\"  Minister of Interior  Police General Kowit Wattana  PPP -  Deputy Minister of Interior  Pricha Rengsomboonsuk  PPP -  Deputy Minister of Interior  Prasong Kositanon  PPD -  Minister of Justice  Somsak Kiatsuranond  PPP - bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\"  Minister of Labour  Uraiwan Thienthong  PRP -  Minister of Culture  Worawat Eua-apinyakul  PPP - bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\"  Minister for Science and Technology  Wutthipong Chaisang  PPP - bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\"  Minister of Education  Srimuang Charoensiri  PPP -  Minister of Public Health  Police Captain Chalerm Yubamrung  PPP - bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\"  Deputy Minister of Public Health  Wicharn Meenchainan  PPP - bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\"  Minister of Industry  Police General Pracha Promnok  PPD } ==References== Category:1947 births Category:Deputy Prime Ministers of Thailand Category:Living people Category:Thai people of Chinese descent Category:People from Nakhon Si Thammarat Province Category:People's Power Party (Thailand) politicians Prime Ministers of Thailand Category:Shinawatra family Category:20th-century Thai judges Category:Thai lawyers Category:Ministers of Defence of Thailand Category:Thammasat University alumni Category:Recipients of the Order of the Sun of Peru Category:Ministers of Education of Thailand ","title":"Somchai Wongsawat"},{"id":"19256458","text":"Antennaria flagellaris is a North American species of flowering plants in the daisy family known by the common names whip pussytoes and stoloniferous pussytoes.Calflora taxon report, University of California, stoloniferous pussy toes, stoloniferous pussytoes, Antennaria flagellaris (A.

The Scottish Tartans Society (STS), now defunct, was a society committed to the recording and preservation of woven tartan designs from around the world; it maintained the Register of All Publicly Known Tartans. The society was first formed in 1963 and existed for about 40 years. The Scottish Tartans Society ceased to record new tartan designs in about the year 2000, having recorded about 2,700 different designs. Today, similar functions are provided by the Scottish government's Scottish Register of Tartans (SRT), which affords some legal recognition to tartans registered with it, and the nonprofit Scottish Tartans Authority (STA), founded by former STS members. ==Creation and closure== The Scottish Tartans Society was first formed in 1963, by several scholars of tartan and Highland dress, with the encouragement of the Lord Lyon King of Arms. The society set out to preserve and record every woven tartan known, including clan tartans and artefacts from several museums and private collections. The society also strove to promote the research into Highland dress, and to assist in the designing of new tartans. It was also a recognised charity, under Scots law. The society's register of tartans was known as the Register of All Publicly Known Tartans. This register was originally a physical collection, consisting of tartans and fabrics. Later, however, the register was eventually transferred to computer in the form of an electronic database. In 1976, the society was accounted as an \\"Incorporation Noble in the Noblesse of Scotland\\", being granted a coat of arms by the Lord Lyon King of Arms. In 1988, the society established a museum of tartan and Highland dress in Highlands, North Carolina, United States. In 1994, the museum moved to Franklin, North Carolina, where it exists today. In 1996, several members of the society left to create their own organisation, called the Scottish Tartans Authority, or (STA). The Scottish Tartans Society ran into financial difficulties and ceased to record new tartan designs around the year 2000. By this time, about 2,700 tartans had been recorded by the society. Among the tartans recorded by the society are clan or family, district, individual, commemorative, and various other tartans. The society is now defunct. == Scottish Tartans World Register == Logo of the Scottish Tartans World Register.

In a racing career which lasted from 1953 through 1955, the California-trained colt ran forty-four times and won eighteen races. His best season was 1954 when he became the first gray horse to win the Kentucky Derby. ==Background== Determine was sired by the British stallion Alibhai a son of the 1933 Epsom Derby and St. Leger Stakes winner Hyperion. Alibhai's other progeny included Your Host and Flower Bowl. Determine's dam was Koubis, born with a cleft palate. Her breeder, Dr. Eslie Asbury, used specially designed instruments to repair her palate in a unique operation, but she was never raced. Koubis was a granddaughter of the mare Swing On, the dam of Seabiscuit, and was also related to Equipoise and Intentionally. Bred to Alibhai, Koubis produced a colt so small that the man who bought him for $12,000, a California automobile dealer named Andrew J. Crevolin, said he \\"…must have been standing in a hole when he inspected the colt.\\" His breeder offered to take him back, but Crevolin refused, explaining that he might be letting a Kentucky Derby winner get away. The colt was sent into training with William Molter in California. Determine, a soft gray in color, grew to a little over fifteen hands and never weighed more than 900 pounds. At the time of his Derby win he was described in the press as being a \\"pint-sized colt\\" and \\"a little package of dynamite\\". ==Racing career== In his two-year-old season Determine won prize money which totaled more than double his purchase price. Overall, it was a modest year, but when he turned three, with no break in training from the year before, Determine was always in stakes company and was never out of the money. In more than one race, his small size got him through holes, and his light weight made him nimble in cramped situations. After Determine won the Santa Anita Derby as well as a few other important West Coast stakes races, Crevolin wanted to send him to Kentucky for the Derby. But his trainer, Wille Molter, with a large stable to manage, was reluctant to take the risk, believing that the race was too hard on a young horse so early in the year. Trainer and owner went back and forth over this decision until Determine made it for them by winning more races. He was flown to Kentucky, and in the space of four days ran in two races. On April 27, 1954, he competed in the Derby Trial, running side by side with Hasty Road in the stretch. Determine matched the much larger Hasty Road stride for stride, although Hasty Road won by a head in a new track record time of 1:35 for the mile. The show horse was eleven lengths back. On May 1, Determine, who had been flown in from California shortly before the race, was ridden by Ray York in the 1954 Kentucky Derby. He was the second choice of the 100,000 crowd at odds of 4/1 with Correlation, another Californian colt, starting the 3/1 favourite. Right out of the gate, York was almost unseated. Timely Tip, who had won the Arkansas Derby, cut over badly from the outside. In what Churchill Downs describes as one of the roughest Derbys ever run, Determine stayed on his feet, and York stayed in the saddle. Hasty Road was well in the lead, but Determine caught him 1/16 of a mile from the finish and won by a length and a half, becoming the first gray to win the Derby. As the colt had never been entered in the Belmont Stakes there was no hope of completing the Triple Crown, and shortly after the Derby it was announced that Determine would miss the Preakness Stakes, which was won in his absence by Hasty Road. Molter had explained that as Determine was a late foal and had already run nine times in 1954, he did not want to risk over-racing him. Back in California, Determine was sent out against older horses. Losing a few races, he was found to have an abscessed jaw and was taken out of training. When he came back, he was heavily weighted, which took its toll on him. Even so, he won four stakes races and retired with winnings of $573,360. ==Stud record== Determine proved to be a good sire. His son Decidedly won the 1962 Kentucky Derby. Warfare, out of War Whisk, was a solid campaigner. Also, Determine was damsire to Hall of Fame filly Bold 'n Determined.

The Polish Air Force plane had been flying from Warsaw to the 12th Air Base in Mirosławiec, and the 20 victims included high-ranking Polish air force officers. Although this was the first serious accident of a CASA C-295, after the accident all Polish C-295s were grounded until further notice. In the subsequent investigations the primary cause of the accident was determined to be an inadvertent loss of spatial and situational awareness by the aircraft crew during the landing approach in poor weather conditions, with a low cloud ceiling and little visibility. A number of secondary causes and contributing factors were also found by the investigation after the accident, including deficiencies in the air traffic controllers' skills and methods of directing and controlling the landing.PROTOKÓŁ badania zdarzenia lotniczego nr 127/2008/2 – wypadku ciężkiego (katastrofy lotniczej) samolotu CASA C-295M numer 019, zaistniałego w 13 eskadrze lotnictwa transportowego z Krakowa, dnia 23 stycznia 2008 r., w środę., o godz. 19.07, w nocy IFR, Komisja Badania Wypadków Lotniczych Lotnictwa Państwowego, Warszawa, 20 marca 2008, pages 27-35 Military experts had qualified it as the safest plane of the Polish air force. https://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/01/24/internacional/1201165500.html The Polish defence minister Bogdan Klich dismissed five air force personnel after the accident investigation concluded that multiple failings contributed to the crash. == Fatalities == From 1st Tactical Air Force Brigade in Świdwin * Brig.

The game featured the Alabama Crimson Tide of the SEC, and the Texas Tech Red Raiders of the Big 12 Conference. During the 2005 season, Alabama — led by quarterback Brodie Croyle — earned a 9-2 regular season record (all nine wins were later vacated by the NCAA due to violations). Following a 9-0 start, the Crimson Tide's two losses came to SEC West rivals LSU and Auburn. Texas Tech — led by quarterback Cody Hodges — also suffered two defeats during their season, including a 52–17 defeat to eventual national champion Texas and a 24–17 loss at Oklahoma State. In 2009, the NCAA vacated Alabama's Cotton Bowl win due to infractions committed during the season. == Game == In a matchup of Alabama's first-ranked scoring defense and Texas Tech's second-ranked scoring offense, the Crimson Tide held the Red Raiders to ten points — thanks to numerous pressures and four sacks of Texas Tech senior quarterback Cody Hodges — who completed only 15 of 32 passes for 191 yards and was knocked out of the game for a period in the second half. The Alabama defense was assisted by an efficient offense that controlled the ball much of the game and kept the defense off the field; Alabama ultimately possessed the ball for 38:56, largely thanks to Kenneth Darby, who rushed for 83 yards on 29 carries. Alabama scored first — less than four minutes into the game — as Croyle hit sophomore wide receiver Keith Brown for a 76–yard touchdown. Replay showed Brown's knee was down when he caught the ball, but referees refused to review the only touchdown Alabama scored.https://bleacherreport.com/articles/976910-50-most-thrilling-college- football-bowl-games-of-all-time Brown finished as Croyle’s top target, gaining 142 yards on five catches. An Alex Trlica 34-yard field goal brought Texas Tech to within four. Alabama kicker Jamie Christensen missed a field goal from 38 yards early in the second quarter and the teams traded blocked field goals to end the first half. Though the Crimson Tide defense kept the Red Raiders in check most of the second half, Hodges engineered late drives for Texas Tech, using both his legs (he finished as his team’s top rusher, gaining 93 yards on 13 carries) and arm. He eventually hit Jarrett Hicks for a game-tying touchdown late in the fourth quarter. It was the Alabama offense that finally secured the win for the Crimson Tide, as quarterback Brodie Croyle, who completed 19 of 31 passes for 275 yards, drove his team 55 yards late in the fourth quarter to set up kicker Jamie \\"Money\\" Christensen’s 45–yard game- winning field goal attempt on the final play. The kick was low, wobbly, and spinning sideways yet somehow managed to find its way through the uprights, giving Alabama the 13-10 victory.http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=260020333 The game-winning field goal by Christensen was the first game-ending score in a Cotton Bowl Classic since 1979, when Joe Montana brought Notre Dame from behind to defeat the University of Houston. == Scoring summary == {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! rowspan=2Quarter !! rowspan=2Time !! rowspan=2Drive !! rowspan=2Team !! rowspan=2Scoring information !! colspan=2Score - !

A popular 1989 Taiwanese dramatic adaptation of her story, the Legends of Zhenzhu (珍珠傳奇) used Zhenzhu as her name (see, e.g., Synopsis of the Episodes of Legends of Zhenzhu), but also cited no historical sources.) (disappeared 759), formally Empress Ruizhen (睿真皇后, literary meaning \\"the wise and true empress\\"), was a Tang Dynasty woman who served as a consort of Emperor Daizong of Tang (Li Chu) while he was the Prince of Guangping under his grandfather Emperor Xuanzong and father Emperor Suzong and the mother of the future Emperor Dezong (Li Kuo). She was captured by the rebel Yan forces during Anshi Rebellion, and although Li Chu regained her at one point during the war, was lost again later during the war. Despite efforts by Emperors Daizong and Dezong to locate her after the war, they were never able to find her. She was finally declared deceased by her great-grandson Emperor Xianzong in 805.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 236. == Before the Anshi Rebellion == It is not known when the future Consort Shen was born, but it is known that her family was from Wuxing (吳興, in modern Huzhou, Zhejiang) and that her clan was a prominent clan in the area. Her father Shen Yizhi (沈易直) had, at one point, served in the imperial government as Dali Zheng(大理正), second-in-command of the Emperial Court, and later was honored by Emperor Daizong as Mishu Jian (秘書監), the director of the Palace Library. Toward of the end of Emperor Xuanzong's Kaiyuan era (713-741), she, as the daughter of a reputable household, was selected for the palace of Emperor Xuanzong's son and crown prince Li Heng, but was from there further given to Li Heng's oldest son, Li Chu the Prince of Guangping. She was not designated Li Chu's wife—and neither was any other consort of his, including the most prominent one, a Consort Cui whose mother was the Lady of Han, a highly honored woman at court due to her status as the sister of Emperor Xuanzong's favorite concubine Consort Yang Yuhuan.Old Book of Tang, vol. 52 . She gave birth to Li Chu's oldest son, Li Kuo, in 742. == During the Anshi Rebellion and disappearance == In 755, the general An Lushan rebelled at Fanyang and soon attacked south and established a new state of Yan, with him as emperor and its capital at Luoyang (Tang's eastern capital). By summer 756, Yan forces were approaching the Tang capital Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xuanzong to flee to Chengdu. Li Heng did not follow Emperor Xuanzong to Chengdu; rather, he fled to Lingwu, where he was declared emperor (as Emperor Suzong). Li Chu followed his father to Lingwu as well. Consort Shen was left at Chang'an, and she was captured and taken by Yan forces to Luoyang and detained in the palace jail. In 757, after An Lushan's son An Qingxu had assassinated An Lushan and succeeded him as emperor, a joint Tang and Huige force, commanded by Li Chu, recaptured Chang'an and then Luoyang. Li Chu reunited with Consort Shen in Luoyang, but as at that time he was busy with planning a campaign against An Qingxu's remaining forces, he did not get the chance to have Consort Shen escorted back to Chang'an. In 758, Shi Siming, a former major general under An Lushan and An Qingxu who had briefly submitted to Tang, rebelled against Tang authority and advanced south. By 759, he had claimed Yan imperial title and recaptured Luoyang. That was the last that Li Chu saw Consort Shen, as she was nowhere to be found when Tang and Huige forces again recaptured Luoyang in 762 against Shi Siming's son and successor Shi Chaoyi (by which point Li Chu, whose name had been changed to Li Yu, was emperor (as Emperor Daizong)). == Post-Anshi Rebellion efforts to locate her == Emperor Daizong designated Li Kuo as crown prince, and he repeatedly sent imperial messengers throughout the realm to try to locate Consort Shen, but was unable to do so. In 765, a Buddhist nun named Guangcheng (廣澄) claimed that she was Consort Shen—but after interrogation, it was shown that she merely served as Li Kuo's wet nurse. Emperor Daizong had her whipped to death.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 223. Emperor Daizong died in 779, and Li Kuo became emperor (as Emperor Dezong). In 780, although Consort Shen had not been located, he honored her in absentia as empress dowager. His official Gao Can (高參) suggested sending out officials to look for her again. Emperor Dezong put his younger brother Li Shu (李述) the Prince of Mu in nominal charge of the project, with the minister Qiao Lin as Li Shu's deputy. He also commissioned four members of the Shen family to assist the eunuchs sent out to find her. In 781, there was an incident where it was thought that Empress Dowager Shen was in fact located. The lady in waiting Li Zhenyi (李真一) had interviewed an adoptive daughter of the once-powerful eunuch Gao Lishi, who had previously served inside the palace and was familiar with the events inside the palace. Li Zhenyi thought she might have been Empress Dowager Shen, and reported this to Emperor Dezong. At that time, no elders of the Shen family remained to tell whether Lady Gao was in fact Empress Dowager Shen, and the eunuchs and ladies in waiting who met her all thought she was Empress Dowager Shen. She initially denied that she was Empress Dowager Shen, but the eunuchs forcibly escorted her to Shangyang Palace (上陽宮), a palace that Emperor Dezong had set aside for Empress Dowager Shen, and supplied her with goods intended for the empress dowager. Lady Gao was enticed and induced into claiming that she was in fact Empress Dowager Shen. Emperor Dezong was very pleased and prepared for a ceremony to formally welcome her. Lady Gao's adoptive brother Gao Chengyue (高承悅) found out and feared that, if she were discovered, disaster would descend on the Gao household, and therefore submitted a letter to Emperor Dezong detailing her history. Emperor Dezong thus sent an adoptive grandson of Gao Lishi's, Fan Jingchao (樊景超), to meet her. When Fan saw her, he cried out, \\"Aunt, why are you putting yourself on the cutting board?\\" Her attendants, surprised at this disrespect for the \\"empress dowager\\", ordered him to leave. Instead, Fan yelled, \\"The Emperor has issued an edict: the Empress Dowager is not real. Leave now!\\" After the attendants left, Lady Gao protested to Fan that she was forced to claim herself to be Empress Dowager Shen. However, Emperor Dezong, fearing that punishing her would cause others to be unwilling to continue searching for Empress Dowager Shen, did not punish her and escorted her back to her home in a wagon. He stated, \\"I would rather be defrauded 100 times, as long as I can find my mother.\\" It was said that after the Lady Gao incident, there were four other incidents in which women pretended to be Empress Dowager Shen but were proven to be not real. The real Empress Dowager Shen was never found.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 226. In his mother's absence, Emperor Dezong honored her household greatly, including bestowing great honors posthumously on her father Shen Yizhi, grandfather Shen Jiefu (沈介福), uncle Shen Yiliang (沈易良), and brother Shen Zhen (沈震). It was said that more than 100 members of the Shen household were given titles. In 805, Emperor Dezong died and was succeeded by his severely ill son Emperor Shunzong, who in turn yielded the throne to his son Emperor Xianzong later in the year. At the suggestion of officials who pointed out that there was no further hope at that point of locating Empress Dowager Shen, Emperor Xianzong declared her deceased and had her formally enshrined in the temple of Emperor Dezong. == Modern Representations == Starting in January 2017, The Glory of Tang Dynasty (唐荣耀) aired on Beijing Satellite TV.

At the age of 28, he enrolled in medicine at University of Melbourne, and entered Ormond College, graduating Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (M.B.B.S.) in September 1917.University Graduates: Presentation of Degrees, The Argus, (Tuesday, 18 September 1917), p.4.About People, The Bendigo Independent, (Friday, 23 November 1917), p.4. ==Football== While at Ormond, he was a prominent footballer. He played with the University's team in the Metropolitan Amateur Football Association; and, as well, he played seven senior games with the University's team in the VFL competition: four games in 1912 (rounds 5, 6, 7, and 8), and three games in 1913 (rounds 2, 15, and 17). He was a member of the University's inter-state team in 1914;Inter-University Match: To be Played Today, The (Adelaide) Advertiser, (Monday, 12 August 1912), pp.13, 14.Football: Inter-University Match: Won by Melbourne, The (Adelaide) Advertiser, (Monday, 12 August 1912), p.13. and was awarded a blue for football.Roll of the Fallen, 1926, p.9. ==Rowing== He was also an oarsman.'Old Boy', \\"College Sports: Boat Race Memories\\", The Australasian, (Saturday, 20 May 1916), p.21.Personal, The Ballarat Star, (Saturday, 17 July 1920), p.1. ==Military== Enlisting in the First A.I.F. immediately on graduating, at the age of 34, he served as a medical officer during World War I with the Australian Army Medical Corps (A.A.M.C.), and remained in England after the war to work in London hospitals.Personal, The Argus, (Saturday, 31 May 1919), p.18. ==Death== He died at sea in 1920 after \\"disappearing\\" from his cabin on the night of 25/26 June 1920 — he was last seen around 12:30 in the early morning of 26 June 1920, near the coast of Toulon — while returning to Australia from England on the RMS Orontes. According to the documents contained within his Service Record, and a search of the ship revealed that no trace of him was found. On the basis of the evidence given to the military Court of Inquiry conducted on 26 June 1920 — by five witnesses, two of whom had known him at Melbourne University — combined with the contents of a note left at the head of his bed,\\"Have had insomnia for over six weeks past. For past two veronal has been used but is now having no effect. Can only see myself going mad which is intolerable so better to go overboard. The depression is unbearable. Corbett.\\" the concluded three things: :: (a) he had been seen, alive and in person, on the vessel on the previous evening; :: (b) a thorough search had revealed that he was no longer on the vessel, :: (c) that he was dead, and nothing else. Documents contained within his Service Record (p. 60) show that the Officer-in-Charge of Base Records of the Defence Department, one Major J. M. Lean, as part of the routine bureaucratic process, submitted the following (on 6 August 1920) to his superiors: ::\\"The evidence discloses that Captain A.G. Corbett, A.A.M.C., disappeared from the transport \\"Orontes\\" on the night of the 25th./26th. June, 1920, when that vessel was at sea, 130 miles from Toulon, France, so he can only reasonably be presumed to have thrown himself overboard —this is borne out by the letter he left before disappearing — and is dead. Recommend that he be recorded as \\"drowned at sea — suicide\\". The superior officer to whom Major Lean's (idiosyncratic and unsubstantiated by any of the documentary evidence) version of the Court's findings were referred was Brigadier General Cecil Henry Foott, the Deputy Adjutant General. Foott approved the findings, with the single, hand-written proviso that Corbett's death was \\"to be recorded as drowned at sea\\", dated 12 August 1920 (at p. 60; and at p. 92 \\"suicide\\" has been crossed out, with the annotation \\"Deleted D.A.G. ruling\\").Note the complete omission of any reference to \\"suicide\\"; however, and despite this, the War Memorial's Honour Roll, rather than either \\"lost at sea\\" or \\"drowned at sea\\", continues to unjustly and inexplicably record his \\"Cause of Death\\" as \\"suicide\\".Within any bureaucratic process, it doesn't matter who recommends which. The only thing that matters is what is finally approved. In the case of Corbett, it is unequivocally clear from the notation placed upon the Instructions — by the superior officer (to whom the inquiry's \\"findings\\" were submitted) — as to the actual wording of the way in which his death was to be officially recorded. Further, it is significant that this specific wording was \\"confirmed by C. H. Foott, Brigadier General, Deputy Adjutant General\\": namely, \\"adjudged to have been drowned at sea\\" (p.26; p.37). N.B. no mention of \\"suicide\\". ==See also== * List of Victorian Football League players who died in active service ==FootnotesReferences== * Arch Corbett's playing statistics from AFL Tables * Third Year Medicals at the Melbourne University, (Melbourne) Punch, (Thursday, 20 May 1915), p.19. * * World War I Service Record: Captain Archibald Gladstone Corbett, National Archives of Australia. * Obituary: Captain Archibald Gladstone Corbett (1898), Wesley College Chronicle, No.159 (August 1920), p.14. * Wesley College Roll of Honour: Captain Archibald Gladstone Corbett. * Personal: Doctor Lost Overboard, The Herald, (Friday, 16 July 1920), p.1. * Ladies' Letter, Table Talk, (Thursday, 22 July 1920), p.28. * Obituary, The Weekly Times, (Saturday, 24 July 1920), p.30. * Roll of the Fallen: Corbett, Archibald Gladstone. 1911, The University of Melbourne Record of Active Service of Teachers, Graduates, Undergraduates, Officers, and Servants in the European War, 1914—1918, The University of Melbourne, (Parkville), 1926, p.9.

One of the team's promising pitching prospects in the late-1970s, his big league career was cut short because of a rotator cuff tear.Rains, Rob. \\"Injured Cards Pitcher Working on Comeback,\\" United Press International (UPI), Saturday, March 26, 1983. Retrieved June 9, 2020 His wife is the great-granddaughter of Effie Norton. ==Before professional baseball== Prior to professional baseball he attended Pattonville High School and then Yavapai Junior College and University of Miami. ==Draft and early minor leagues== Originally drafted by the New York Yankees 15th overall in the 1976 amateur draft, Fulgham did not sign. Drafted again 15th overall in the secondary phase of the 1976 amateur draft by the Cardinals, he signed and began his professional career with the GCL Cardinals. With the GCL Cardinals, Fulgham went 3–3 with a 3.38 ERA in 56 innings (12 games). For the St. Petersburg Cardinals in 1977, he went 18–6 with a 2.05 ERA in 26 games (202 innings). He pitched for the Arkansas Travelers in 1978, going 9–7 with a 4.03 ERA in 154 innings. ==The big leagues== He began the 1979 season with Springfield, going 6–3 with a 3.16 ERA in 77 innings. He made his big league debut on June 19 of that year, and he was arguably the Cardinals best pitcher over the rest of the season. In his debut, he pitched a complete game shutout, allowing eight hits, one walk, striking out six, and getting the win. For the season, he went 10–6 with a 2.53 ERA, with all 10 of his wins being complete games. His ten wins tied him with David Palmer for second most wins by a rookie that season, trailing only Rick Sutcliffe's 17. Despite pitching well, he did not receive a single vote for Rookie of the Year. Because of an torn rotator cuff, Fulgham appeared in only 15 games in 1980, going 4–6 with a 3.38 ERA. All four of his wins were complete games. He would never appear in the majors after 1980, playing his final game on August 27. ==Major league totals== In total, Fulgham went 14–12 with a 2.84 ERA in 35 big league games (33 starts). All 14 of his wins were complete games. In 231 innings, he allowed 189 hits, 17 home runs, 58 walks, and he struck out 158 batters. ==Back in the minor leagues== Despite not pitching in the majors again after 1980, Fulgham bounced around in the minors until 1983. Fulgham did not pitch in 1981, and he spent 1982 with St. Petersburg and the Louisville Redbirds. He went 4–2 with a 2.45 ERA for St. Petersburg, and with the Redbirds he went 4–3 with a 7.01 ERA. Overall, he went 8–5 with a 4.81 ERA. In 1983, he made five appearances for the Redbirds, going 1–2 with a 6.27 ERA. ==Post-playing days== Following his retirement, Fulgham was the head coach for Rollins College from 1992 to 1994, going 63–52 with one playoff game. ==References *Baseball Library Category:Living people Category:1956 births Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:St. Louis Cardinals players Category:Baseball players from Missouri Category:Yavapai Roughriders baseball players Category:Miami Hurricanes baseball players ","title":"John Fulgham"},{"id":"19257023","text":"David OReilly (born 1985) is an Irish artist, film maker and game developer based in Los Angeles, California, US. ==Work Animation === Aside from a 1-minute film entitled Ident, from which he draws his logo, the earliest work available on his website is WOFL2106. This short draws equally on original designs and popular internet memes to create a disturbing landscape of serenity juxtaposed with chaos. This film sets the tone for his entire œuvre, though the direct inclusion of outside memes disappears in his later work. He created several animation sequences and props for the 2007 film Son of Rambow, as well as animation for the \\"guide\\" sequences in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, with Shynola. He created the first video for Irish rock band U2's single \\"I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight\\". The video was released on U2.com on 21 July 2009. In 2007, he produced the surreal short film \\"RGB XYZ\\" which tells the story of a young man kicked out of his parents' house to work in the big city, while using low poly graphics, compression artefacts, text to speech voices, jarring colour palettes, and discordant tones. His short film Please Say Something was awarded the Golden Bear at the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival, Best Narrative Short at the 2009 Ottawa International Animation Festival and several other awards. His short film, The External World, premiered at the 67th Venice Film Festival and the 2011 Sundance Film Festival, and has since won over forty awards on its festival circuit including the IFTA for Best Animation. He wrote, directed, produced and animated the Adventure Time episode \\"A Glitch Is a Glitch\\" for Cartoon Network, becoming the first guest director in the network's 20-year history. In 2013 he worked on the Spike Jonze movie Her as animation director on the sequences where the characters are playing video games. === Octocat Adventure === On 13 March 2008, a YouTube user named RANDYPETERS1, a 9-year-old boy from Chicago, submitted a handdrawn animated video about Octocat, a red cat head with eight long legs looking for his parents. The videos featured crude MS Paint animation and a loud, highpitched, childlike voice narrating. On 7 September, the fifth, final episode was released, but featured an unexpected twist – at about 25 seconds in, the crude sketchy animation switched to intricately crafted 3D with an orchestral soundtrack; the whole Octocat story (and as such, the Randy Peters persona) was revealed to be by David OReilly. === Video Games === David announced his first game Mountain at MOCA Los Angeles in June 2014, and released it the following month in partnership with Double Fine Productions for personal computers and mobile devices. Mountain features little interactivity but allows the player to create and watch a solitary mountain floating in space as it offers its thoughts to the player, and as random objects collide and become embedded within it. It was generally praised by critics, noting it as a subversion what one normally expects for a video game. In 2016, OReilly announced a second game, Everything, a \\"simulator of everything\\", on which the player can play as anything, from bacteria to galaxies. Everything was released on 21 March 2017 on PlayStation 4, with Windows and Mac versions to follow on 21 April 2017. Everything became the first realtime project to qualify for an Academy Award. == Style == OReilly's work is often characterised by the use of intentionally stripped down 3d graphics. He is known for popularising the use of low-poly 3d and the use of 3d software as a personal and artistic tool, as outlined in his 2009 essay \\"Basic Animation Aesthetics\\". He was an early adopter of glitch effects and uses elements of the software used inside his work. \\"[David] has been the man to lead animation through a conceptual blockage—3D animation was being dominated by commercial aesthetics....he deconstructed 3D to the point of absurdity.\\" == Video Games == * Everything (2017) * Mountain (2014) ==Short films== * The External World (2010, 17 min) *Please Say Something (2009, 10 min) *Octocat Adventure (2008, 6 min) *Serial Entoptics (2008, 10 min) *RGB XYZ (2007, 12 min) * Wofl2106 (2006, 4 min) *????? ==Music videos== *\\"Szamár Madár\\" (Venetian Snares, 2005, 4 min) *\\"I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight\\" (U2, 2009, 4 min) ==References== * ==External links== *David OReilly's Website featuring clips of his work. * Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Irish animators Category:Irish animated film directors Category:Irish expatriates in the United States Category:Irish film directors Category:People from Kilkenny (city) ","title":"David OReilly (artist)"},{"id":"19257049","text":"Robert Dawes (fl. 1610–1614) was an English actor of the Jacobean era.Edwin Nunzeger, A Dictionary of Actors and of Others Associated with the Representation of Plays in England Before 1642, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1929; pp. 114-15. He is unique in the extant records of English Renaissance theatre, in that his individual employment contract with one of his acting companies has survived.Andrew Gurr, The Shakespearian Playing Companies, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1996; p. 69. Dawes was an early and perhaps an original member and \\"sharer\\" (a partner who shared in the profits, rather than a hired man who worked for a wage) with Prince Charles's Men, from at least 1610 on. He remained with that company only until 1614, however, when he left for the Lady Elizabeth's Men. Dawes was admitted as a sharer in the Lady Elizabeth's troupe; his personal 3-year contract with managers Philip Henslowe and Jacob Meade, dated 7 April of that year, spells out a schedule of graduated penalties for minor and major infractions of the rules:Alwin Thaler, \\"The Elizabethan Dramatic Companies,\\" Papers of the Modern Language Association, Vol. 35 No. 1 (1920), pp. 123-59; see pp. 134-6. * If Dawes was late for a rehearsal, he had to pay a fine of \\"twelve pence,\\" one shilling (1 s.). * If he missed a rehearsal entirely, the fine was 2 s. * If he was late for a performance, the fine rose to 3 s. * If he was drunk at the start of a performance (in the judgement of four troupe members), the fine was 10 s. * If he missed a performance with no adequate excuse, the fine rose to one pound (£1). * And if he was found guilty of appropriating any of the company's expensive costumes or other property (as by wearing a costume outside the theatre), the fine was a hefty (almost astronomical) £40. (As a comparison, William Shakespeare paid £60 for New Place, the largest house in Stratford- upon-Avon, in 1597.) Since no other comparable contract for an actor of the period exists, scholars cannot be certain that the Dawes document is representative. Yet there is nothing in Dawes's career that suggests he was particularly unusual, so that his contract was probably within the range of what was normal and typical for the actors of the period. ==References== Category:English male stage actors Category:17th-century English male actors Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown ","title":"Robert Dawes"},{"id":"19257072","text":"Unspeakable is a 2004 album by American jazz guitarist Bill Frisell, his 22nd album overall and his 17th to be released on the Elektra Nonesuch label. ==Background== After several albums emphasizing country, folk and blues music, Unspeakable represented a stylistic shift by exploring R&B;/funk rhythm and extensive sampling from obscure vinyl records.

It attracts many domestic as well as foreign tourists. The planetarium has regular film shows on subjects related to astronomy. It also holds exhibitions, which attract many visitors. The planetarium uses traditional opto-mechanical projection of celluloid film. ==Criticism== In contrast to more modern digital projectors, the opto- mechanical system uses films that are difficult to change. As a consequence, the same film may be shown for years. ==Competition== The first digital planetarium of Bihar was planned to open in late 2016 at the premises of Shrikrishna Science Centre near Gandhi Maidan in Patna. The planetarium has been developed at a cost of and is equipped with a Carl Zeiss digital projector system.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/States-first- digital-planetarium-on-cards-in-Patna/articleshow/52178720.cms ==See also== * Dr. A.

As a leader of the more moderate fundamentalist Baptists in the Northern Baptist Convention (NBC), his efforts towards reconciliation contributed to compromises that ensured its continued existence as a cohesive Christian denomination. Massee was born in Marshallville, Georgia. He was the youngest child of Drewry Washington Massee (a physician) and Susan Elizabeth Bryan Massee, and grew up a Southern Baptist in Marshallville. He attended Mercer University, then spent a year teaching before marrying and being ordained in 1893. In 1896, after the death of his first wife, he remarried and entered the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, where he stayed for a year before returning to preaching.\\"Jasper Cortenus Massee.\\" Religious Leaders of America, 2nd ed. Gale Group, 1999 Massee presided over a conference of conservative forces in the NBC (entitled \\"Fundamentals of Our Baptist Faith\\") in Buffalo, New York prior to the 1920 convention, and was elected president of the Fundamentalist Fellowship that it formed. This group forced an investigation of liberal Christianity in the Baptist schools, but the process led to Massee becoming alienated from its more aggressive members. In 1923, radical fundamentalists formed the Baptist Bible Union, with Massee continuing to head the moderate faction. He was attacked by the radicals for cooperating with the liberals, while the liberals had little use for his theology. In 1925, he resigned leadership of the Fundamentalist Fellowship, due to his wife's invalidism and the continued infighting, and instead worked towards seeking reconciliation. He was one of 68 Baptist leaders who met in Chicago on 13 March 1926 with the aim of forging a compromise between fundamentalists and liberal modernists in their common interest of supporting the NBC as a denomination.Yet Saints Their Watch are Keeping by J.

Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Laurent should have received the nomination at the 16th Screen Actors Guild Awards saying, \\"In drawing attention to one performer, in particular, whom they left out of the Best Supporting Actress category, [...] I flat-out adore this performance and I suspect that many others do too,\\" and further lauding Laurent's performance added, \\"[Laurent] is radiant and, in a unique Tarantino way, heartbreaking. Sexy and luminous in the heat of her valor. Putting out fire – and setting it. It becomes an anthem of noirish dread and excitement, a sign that Laurent, as Shosanna, has found her destiny.\\" In an interview, Laurent said that she went into Inglourious Basterds with an adoration for Quentin Tarantino. \\"[The French] don't see him like an independent director; we just see him as the best director, ever, [from the United States].\\" About the process of auditioning, Laurent said that she knew right from the start that this was a film she had to be in as she felt a connection to her role in the film, because the history of her Jewish family. In addition, Laurent won a number of accolades for her portrayal of Shosanna including Austin Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress and Online Film Critics Society Award for Best Actress, and nominations at the Detroit Film Critics Society Awards, Empire Award for Best Actress, and Saturn Award for Best Actress among others. The highly anticipated film, which had been in development since 1998, marked Laurent's first major role in an American film and Laurent found herself pushed into mainstream success in North America. Laurent's partner Julien Boisselier, as well as Marie Denarnaud, Mélanie Doutey, and Louise Monot were to act in the production while short film clips were to be projected on stage, some of them shot at the nightclub Le Baron, which Laurent used to frequent during the writing period. In 2010, Laurent starred in The Round Up, a French film directed by Roselyne Bosch, and produced by Alain Goldman, alongside Jean Reno, Sylvie Testud, and Gad Elmaleh. Based on the true story of a young Jewish boy, the film depicts the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup, the mass arrest of Jews by French police who were Nazi accomplices in Paris in July 1942. The film and the Laurent's performance was well received by the critics, with Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian deeming it \\"well acted\\". John Anderson of Newsday lauded Laurent saying that she gave an \\"inspiring performance as a gentile nurse\\". ===Continued success (2011–present)=== Laurent had also planned another feature film, Putain de pluie!, produced by Alain Attal's Productions du Trésor, whose script she co-wrote with Morgan Perez and which she intended to direct. Originally set for filming in the spring of 2009, it was postponed because of her work on Inglourious Basterds. Knowing that she could speak French, and had already acted in French in one of the short films in Paris, je t'aime, she offered the first role to Natalie Portman, who declined because of the script's language. Laurent played the part of the violinist in Radu Mihăileanu's Le Concert—she called it \\"a smart movie and a popular movie\\", and added that she was, \\"glad because French people wanted to watch a movie with classical music.\\" Mick LaSalle of San Francisco Chronicle called it a \\"role with great technical demands\\" and praising Laurent wrote, \\"she's extremely subtle and reserved ... \\"The Concert\\" constitutes a breakthrough for her, in that it unlocks her emotional floodgates\\".

The film also stars Jolie and Brad Pitt, and was released on 13 November 2015, by Universal Pictures.

She then co-directed the 2015 documentary Tomorrow, which earned her a César Award for Best Documentary Film. In an interview with Indiewire in 2014, Laurent admitted that she loves writing: \\"[Writing is] especially super exciting because you have everything to do and most of your ideas come from that first part… you just imagine things, and you imagine actors.\\" She described the shooting process as \\"the fun part\\" because of: \\"working with people I love—it’s always a great human moment because we’re sharing things and it’s good to see people who are here for you and your story, to tell your story. It’s really beautiful, it’s why I love making movies.\\" Laurent made her English-language directorial debut in 2018 with Galveston, the film adaptation of Nic Pizzolatto's novel of the same name. It starred Ben Foster and Elle Fanning. Laurent will next direct and write The Nightingale an adaption of novel of the same name by Kristin Hannah, which is set to star Fanning and Dakota Fanning, and is scheduled to be released on 22 December 2021. ==Personal life and off-screen work== Laurent at the alt=Laurent in a black dress posing for the cameras. Laurent was in a long-term relationship with fellow French actor Julien Boisselier which ended in 2009. In March 2013, she revealed that she had married but refused to name her spouse.

That said, most of her films since 2009 have been in English. She stated that she loved France, her street, her café, and not having to use a car. Rather than go on to work on a big budget American film after Inglourious Basterds, her next role was in a small theater piece in France. Laurent described recording artist Damien Rice and filmmaker Quentin Tarantino as two \\"masters\\" in terms of their art. Laurent visited a Climate Defenders Camp in the peatlands of the Indonesian Rainforest with Greenpeace activists.

He died of heart failure on October 6, 1899, at the age of 83 in his home at 615 Ducommun Street in Los Angeles. Location of the Mascarel home on Mapping L.A.LAOkay Mascarel had also lived in what was later called the Santa Cruz Adobe at today's North Spring Street and Cesar Chavez Avenue. A solemn high mass was scheduled for the Old Plaza Church, with interment following at the Catholic Calvary Cemetery in East Los Angeles.\\"Aged Pioneer Gone,\\" Los Angeles Times, March 7, 1889, page 7Florence H. Goddard, Los Angeles Public Library reference file\\"Death Record,\\" Los Angeles Times, October 8, 1899, page A-8 He was at his death the \\"[second-]oldest foreigner in Los Angeles, if not in California,\\" after Elijah Moulton. ===Marriages=== Mascarel's first marriage was in 1844 to Constancia Goytino of México, in the Pueblo de Los Ángeles in Alta California. They had nine children, Charles, Jose Jr., Constance, Hortense, Marie Larquier, Josephine Twist, Margarita Drouet, Adele Kracke, and Eugenie Hoover. She died in 1890. However, \\"In spite of the opposition of relatives,\\" the Los Angeles Times noted, Mascarel married Maria Jesus Benite Feliz on June 4, 1896, in a \\"quiet but romantic wedding\\" to \\"the woman who for thirty long years has been, to all intents and purposes,\\" his wife.\\"After Thirty Years: Long-Delayed Wedding of Don José Mascarel,\\" Los Angeles Times, June 6, 1896 The Times added: :: > There was an attempt made to prevent the issuance of a marriage license to > Mr. Mascarel, but it proved futile, as the law does not require a license to > render the marriage valid in a case like this. . . . The desire to have the > union made legal was brought about by the failing health of Mrs. Mascarel, > who, although twenty years younger than her aged husband, is still a woman > far advanced in years. ===Personality=== In an 1899 talk before the Historical Society of Southern California, Los Angeles historian H.D. Barrows noted that Mascarel was \\"physically of stalwart proportions, being over six feet in height and weighing over 200 pounds.\\" Another contemporary, Horace Bell, recalled in 1881 that Mascarel was a \\"giant . . . with a great grizzly grip.\\"Horace Bell, Reminiscences of a Ranger; or, Early Times in Southern California Barrows told his audience that: > While Mr. Mascarel was naturally of a retiring disposition, including him to > shun publicity, he was in many respects a remarkable man. He had clear-cut > and eminently practical views, strong convictions and a sound judgment in > business matters, which enabled him to accumulate a handsome fortune, though > he gave away for charitable and other purposes, considerable sums during his > lifetime. His charities, which in his later years amounted to several > hundred dollars a month, were, as a rule, unknown to outsiders, i.e., to any > one except himself and the beneficiaries. Barrows noted that Mascarel \\"spoke French and Spanish, but like so many natives of France who came to California, he was never quite able to master the English language.\\" > When General Irwin McDowell was commander of the army on this coast, after > the close of the civil war, he made Los Angeles a visit, and our people were > anxious to have him receive due honors by the Mayor, which office was at the > time filled by Mr. Mascarel; and they feared his unfamiliarity with the > English language might cause embarrassment. But as it happened, General > McDowell spoke French fluently, and so the official courtesies between him > and the Mayor passed off felicitously. ===Legacy=== When Mascarel died, his estate was estimated to be worth a million dollars, but a later probate determined the sum to be \\"no more than $500,000 or $600,000. The difference may be accounted for that in his later years the old man got into the habit of deeding away his property to his loving friends until it was somewhat reduced,\\" the Los Angeles Times reported. \\"A dozen or fifteen suits in this county and Santa Barbara county\\" were opened \\"to recover the property that deceased had deeded away so generously. when the will was challenged by three of his children [from his first wife]\\"Will of Late Jose Mascarel,\\" Sacramento Record-Union, October 25, 1899, page 8—Constance M.

Mascarel had \\"provided for his wife before he died, and assigned her certain mortgages aggregating about $24,000, besides valuable property.\\" It was agreed that the children would refund to investor Max Goldschmidt the sum of $25,000 he had paid for the Hotel Mascarel property in Santa Barbara in return for his giving them the deed to the hotel. ==Vocation== When José Mascarel was eleven years old, he shipped out on a French merchant ship, and at age 21 he joined the French Navy for four years.H.D. Barrows, \\"Jose Mascarel,\\" Annual Publication of the Historical Society of Southern California and Pioneer Register, Los Angeles, volume 4, number 3 (1899), pages 282-85 > In about the year 1840, he sailed from Gibraltar for Valparaiso. In passing > Cape Horn he had both feet frozen, from which he was ill when he arrived at > Valparaiso. After recovering his health[,] Captain Mascarel engaged in > coasting trade off the western coast of South America, he and another party > having purchased a vessel, a Chilean schooner, La Joven Fanita. Mascarel sold the vessel to Joseph Yves Limantour but remained aboard as captain while trading on the California coast. In 1845 they arrived at San Pedro in Alta California, where Mascarel debarked and made his way to settle in the Pueblo de Los Ángeles. He went to work as a cooper for Luis Vignes and then, with \\"two Manon brothers\\" started a bakery. Mascarel was noted as a man \\"largely instrumental in building up\\" early Los Angeles. He owned property \\"in the very midst of the city's wholesale district\\" and in San Bernardino, Riverside, Ventura, and Santa Barbara Counties.\\"Thousands For the Heirs,\\" Los Angeles Times, August 26, 1900, page IV-1 ===Public service=== Mascarel was a member of the Los Angeles Common Council in 1864–65, and he was again elected on November 12, 1866, to succeed Moritz Morris, who had resigned the previous month. He served also on the council in 1867 (his position was declared vacant on August 19 of that year, but he was reelected on September 2), in 1868–69 and in 1869–70 (he resigned on January 13, 1870). After the council was reformatted from an at-large representation to one based on electoral districts, he was elected to represent the 2nd Ward in 1873–74, 1874–75, 1880–81 and 1881–82. Mascarel was a supporter of the Union government during the American Civil War, and helped to overcome a \\"strong secessionist movement\\" in Los Angeles at that time.City of Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department, Mayors of Los Angeles ;Mayor He served one term as the Mayor of Los Angeles, from May 5, 1865, to May 10, 1866.Chronological Record of Los Angeles City Officials,1850-1938, compiled under direction of Municipal Reference Library, City Hall, Los Angeles (March 1938, reprinted 1966). \\"Prepared ... as a report on Project No. SA 3123-5703-6077-8121-9900 conducted under the auspices of the Works Progress Administration.\\" He was also a member of the Fire Commission. During his mayoral term, he wanted to include the prohibition of weapons in the city. During the municipal campaign in 1866, a local newspaper wrote: \\"Wanted: a candidate for Mayor who can read and speak the English language.\\" In 1871, he invested in the Farmers and Merchants Bank of Los Angeles with Isaias W. Hellman and Charles Ducommun. In 1874 he acquired a store on Gower Street west of Los Angeles, which in 1886 became the city of Hollywood. ==References and notes== Access to the Los Angeles Times links may require the use of a library card.

'Brockie', as he was called by the fans, became one of the club's icons and a living legend for the Genk fans.

Its property was sold at foreclosure to several new companies in the 1920s; the portion north of Springfield has since become the Illinois and Midland Railroad, while the remainder has been abandoned, except for a portion near St. Louis that is now owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway. ==History== The earliest predecessor of the CP&StL; was the Illinois River Railroad, chartered by the Illinois General Assembly in February 1853 to build a line from Jacksonville north- northeasterly to La Salle through the valley of the Illinois River. The line was opened from Virginia to Pekin in 1859, and in May 1864 the property was sold at foreclosure to the Peoria, Pekin and Jacksonville Railroad, which had been incorporated in June 1863 for this purpose. The company bought a line from Pekin to Peoria from the Peoria and Hannibal Railroad in May 1868, and in 1869 the road was extended southwest to the Toledo, Wabash and Western Railway (Wabash) at Jacksonville.

The latter's lease of the St. Louis and Chicago expired in December 1895, and that company soon became part of the new St. Louis, Peoria and Northern Railway. This left the Chicago, Peoria and St. Louis Railway, reorganized in January 1896 as the Chicago, Peoria and St. Louis Railroad of Illinois, with its original lines from Pekin to Jacksonville and Springfield and an isolated branch between Litchfield and Madison. Unable to use the direct line from Springfield to Litchfield, the CP&StL; acquired trackage rights over the St. Louis, Chicago and St. Paul Railroad (\\"Bluff Line\\") to Waverly and the Jacksonville Southeastern to Litchfield; the route was modified in July 1896 to use the latter line from Jacksonville to Litchfield.Poor's Manual of the Railroads of the United States, 1897, p. 86 Several years later, the CP&StL; would acquire the Bluff Line as its St. Louis connection, and sell off the Litchfield-Madison line. The Bluff Line began as the St. Louis, Jerseyville and Springfield Railroad, incorporated in November 1880 to build from Springfield to the Mississippi River near Grafton. The line was completed in 1882 from Bates, on the Wabash west of Springfield, through Jerseyville to Dow, where it descended the Mississippi River's bluffs to Elsah and followed the shoreline to Grafton. After a lease to the St. Louis and Central Illinois Railroad, begun in December 1886, the line was reorganized in November 1888 as the St. Louis, Alton and Springfield Railroad, which had been incorporated in June 1887. In 1889, that company built a branch from Dow to the river at Lockhaven, and then along the Mississippi to Alton, as well as a connection from Elsah to Lockhaven. (The Dow-Elsah segment would later be abandoned.) Another reorganization, in September 1892, created the St. Louis, Chicago and St. Paul Railroad which built a direct entrance to Springfield from Loami (south of Bates), as well as an extension from Alton to Granite City in July 1894. The company was reorganized yet again in October 1897, forming the St. Louis, Chicago and St. Paul Railway of Illinois. Finally, in March 1900, the Bluff Line was merged into the Chicago, Peoria and St. Louis Railway of Illinois, a reorganization of the Chicago, Peoria and St. Louis Railroad of Illinois, and at the same time the Litchfield-Madison line was split off as a new Litchfield and Madison Railway, which the CP&StL; continued to operate under lease until June 1904.Paul Stringham, Illinois Terminal, the Electric Years, , pp. 98, 251Interstate Commerce Commission, 43 Val.

She and her best friend, zany Trixie Martin, search for the missing treasure that could save the fortunes of the exclusive Grangewood School for Young Ladies. Along the way, Daisy overcomes false accusations, saves the lives of her enemies and discovers that the mysterious stranger seen around the grounds is her long-lost father. At the start Trixie has a higher status, but as they start the hunt for the treasure Daisy's status becomes higher than Trixie's as she knows more about treasure seeking. ==Productions== After tryouts at the Nuffield Theatre in Southampton in 1983, the play was staged in the West End at the Gielgud Theatre (then known as the Globe) from April 1983 to February 1986, produced by Andrew Lloyd Webber and directed by David Gilmore.

G. Wells in which humanity is \\"exalted\\" when a comet causes \\"the nitrogen of the air, the old azote,\\" to \\"change out of itself\\" and become \\"a respirable gas, differing indeed from oxygen, but helping and sustaining its action, a bath of strength and healing for nerve and brain.\\"H. G. Wells, In the Days of the Comet, Book II, Chapter 2, Section 1. The result: \\"The great Change has come for evermore, happiness and beauty are our atmosphere, there is peace on earth and good will to all men.\\"H. G. Wells, In the Days of the Comet, Book I, Chapter 1, Section 2. == Plot summary == An unnamed narrator is the author of a prologue (\\"The Man Who Wrote in the Tower\\") and an epilogue (\\"The Window of the Tower\\"). In these short texts is depicted an encounter with a \\"happy, active-looking\\" old man: the protagonist and author of the first-person narrative, writing the story of his life immediately before and after \\"the Change\\". This narrative is divided into three \\"books\\": Book I: The Comet; Book II: The Green Vapours; and Book III: The New World. Book I, recounts that William (\\"Willie\\") Leadford, \\"third in the office staff of Rawdon's pot-bank [a place where pottery is made] in Clayton,\\" quits his job just as an economic recession caused by American dumping hits industrial Britain, and is unable to find another position. He returns to being a student and his emotional life is dominated by his attachment to Nettie Stuart, \\"the daughter of the head gardener of the rich Mr. Verrall's widow\\", of a village called Checkshill Towers. Converted to socialism by his friend 'Parload', Leadford blames class-based injustice for the squalid living conditions in which he and his mother live. The date of the action is unspecified. When Nettie jilts Leadford for the son and heir of the Verrall family, Leadford buys a revolver, intending to kill them both and himself. As this plot matures, a comet with an \\"unprecedented band in the green\\" in its spectroscopy looms gradually larger in the sky, eventually becoming brighter than the Moon. Just as Leadford is about to kill his rivals, the green comet enters the Earth's atmosphere and disintegrates, causing a soporific green fog. Book II opens with Leadford's awakening, in which he is acutely aware of the beauty in the world and his attitude toward others is one of generous fellow-feeling. The same effects occur in every human being, who accordingly re-organize human society.H. G. Wells, In the Days of the Comet, Book II, Chapter 3, Sections 2 and 3. By chance, Leadford falls in with a Cabinet minister and briefly becomes his secretary. Book III begins with an intense discussion by Verrall, Leadford, and Nettie, about their future. Although Nettie wants to establish a ménage à trois, Leadford and Verrall reject the idea, and Leadford devotes himself to his mother until her death. Leadford marries Anna, who has been helping care for his mother, and they have a son; but soon thereafter Nettie contacts Leadford. In the epilogue, the 72-year-old Leadford reveals that he, Nettie, Verrall, and Anna were from then on \\"very close, you understand, we were friends, helpers, personal lovers in a world of lovers\\".H. G. Wells, In the Days of the Comet, Epilogue. The author is troubled \\"by my uneasy sense of profound moral differences.\\" == Characters  William \\"Willie\\" Leadford === At the beginning of the novel William Leadford is an angry, confident young man with an intellectual bent. Looking back fifty years later, he calls himself \\"ill clothed, ill fed, ill housed, ill educated and ill trained.\\"H. G. Wells, In the Days of the Comet, Book I, Chapter 2, Section 1. His age is unclear: he is described both as 21 years of ageH. G. Wells, In the Days of the Comet, Book I, Chapter 1, Section 2: \\"Parload was two and twenty, and eight months older than I.\\" and 17 or 18.H. G. Wells, In the Days of the Comet, Book I, Chapter 2, Section 4: \\"When I and Nettie had been sixteen we had been just of an age and contemporaries together. Now we were a year and three-quarters older.\\" He is a member of the British working class and, like H. G. Wells, a believer in socialism. Leadford has been Nettie Stuart's \\"sweetheart\\" for more than three years. He works in a \\"pot-bank,\\" has studied shorthand, and is a religious sceptic. He lives in lodgings with his timid, work-worn, but loving mother, widowed by a train accident, who believes in \\"a quaint old-fashioned narrow faith.\\" === Nettie Stuart === Nettie, the beautiful daughter of a gardener, has known William Leadford since they were children because their mothers were \\"second cousins and old schoolfellows.\\"H. G. Wells, In the Days of the Comet, Book I, Chapter 1, Section 1. === Edward Verrall === The Verralls are a wealthy upper-class family. Mrs. Verrall is a widow. Edward Verrall is \\"a gallant youngster, people said, and very clever. Young as he was there was talk of parliament for him; he had been a great success at the university.\\"H. G. Wells, In the Days of the Comet, Book I, Chapter 2, Section 6. === Parload === Leadford's only close friend is a fellow clerk and socialist. But the pair quarrel and Leadford breaks off relations when Parload avers that socialism is \\"only a theory,\\" whereas science is \\"something more\\". In later years Parload becomes a great scientist whose \\"work upon intersecting radiations has broadened the intellectual horizon of mankind for ever.\\"H. G. Wells, In the Days of the Comet, Book I, Chapter 1, Section 4. == Reception == Wells's open endorsement of polyamorous love at the end of In the Days of the Comet caused some scandal. Various organisations dedicated to preserving public morals, including the YWCA, Salvation Army and ‘Anti-Vice and White Slavery’ campaigners, spoke out against the book, as did several influential reviewers: ‘socialistic mens' wives, we gather,’ said the Times Literary Supplement, ‘are, no less than their goods, to be held in common.’Mackenzie, Norman and Jeanne (1973), The Time Traveller: the Life of H.G. Wells London. Weidenfeld & Nicolson, p. 211. The affair also damaged Wells's standing in the Fabians. On 18 October 1906, Beatrice Webb wrote in her diary: \\"In the Days of the Comet ends with a glowing anticipation of promiscuity in sexual relationships ... [but] Wells is, I believe, merely gambling with the idea of free love—throwing it out to see what sort of reception it gets—without responsibility for its effect on the character of the hearers. It is this recklessness that makes Sidney dislike him.\\"Lynn Knight and Jeanne MacKenzie, eds. (2000), The Diaries of Beatrice Webb London.

In Doriano Fasoli Riflessioni in forma di conversazioni, Interviste a personaggi della cultura italiana e straniera In 1963 he published Teoria del Restauro, a landmark theoretical essay on restoration. His theory gave rise to 'trateggio,' a controversial technique for repainting missing or damaged sections of works of art. His broad practical experience and his phenomenological references ranging from Plato to Kant, passing through Benedetto Croce, Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Bergson and especially Edmund Husserl and Hegel, culminated in what became known as Theory of Critical Restoration, Whose main work (Theory of Restoration) refers to 1963.

They are found in coastal waters of the northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as well as those of the Baltic and North Seas. Harbor seals are brown, tan, or gray, with distinctive V-shaped nostrils. An adult can attain a length of 1.85 meters (6.1 ft) and a mass of 132 kilograms (290 lbs). Females outlive males (30–35 years versus 20–25 years). Harbor seals stick to familiar resting spots, generally rocky areas where land predators can't reach them, near a steady supply of fish to eat. Their global population is 400,000 to 500,000, and subspecies in certain habitats are threatened. Seal hunting, once a common practice, is now mostly illegal. ==History== In 1988, due to an outbreak of the phocine distemper virus, there was a dramatic decline in the population of the Common Seal. The Agreement on Conservation of Seals was signed on 16 October 1990 in Bonn, Germany. It entered into force on 1 October 1991, and population has recovered significantly since then. In 2002, however, the same virus caused another population decline in the North Sea, the Wadden Sea and Kattegat/Skagerrak area. CMS- official web-site ==Agreement area and members== The Agreement was concluded between the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. The Agreement area includes: In the Netherlands - the areas under Key planning Decision Wadden Sea. In Germany- the Wadden Sea national parks and the protected areas under the Nature Conservation Act seaward of the main dike and the brackish water limit including the Dollard In Denmark- the Wildlife and Nature Reserve Wadden Sea. Wadden Sea Secretariat official web-site The Secretariat of the Agreement is located in Wilhelmshaven, Germany. ==The Seal Management Plan (2002 – 2006)== The Seal Management Plan (2002-2006) contains objectives and action points on habitat protection, research and monitoring, pollution and wardening, taking and public information. The plan is aimed at the Wadden Sea stock of the Common seal (Phoca vitulina vitulina) and is also extended to cover the two breeding stocks of the Grey seal (Helichoerus grypus) in the Wadden Sea (Grey Seal is not covered by the Agreement). The overall aim of the plan is to restore and maintain viable stocks and a natural reproduction capacity, including juvenile survival of the Common and Grey seal. The Plan seeks a balance between conservation and management of the area, and contributing to achieving viable stocks. ==See also== *Harbor seal *List of environmental agreements *Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) *Marine Protected Area ==References External links == * Text of the Agreement * Wadden Sea Secretariat official web-site * CMS official web-site Category:Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals Category:Treaties of Denmark Category:Treaties concluded in 1990 Category:Treaties entered into force in 1991 Category:Treaties of Germany Category:Treaties of the Netherlands Category:Seal conservation Category:1991 in the environment Category:Environmental treaties ","title":"Agreement on the Conservation of Seals in the Wadden Sea"},{"id":"19257808","text":"The 2009 FIBA Asia Championship for Men was the biennial Asian continental championship and also served as the FIBA Asia qualifying tournament for the 2010 FIBA World Championship.

This giant, purported to dwell in Meluz, Orion, Bataan, and Cebu is described as always laughing. The literal meaning of the name Bungingis is derived from the Cebuano word ngisi which means \\"to giggle\\". The Bungisngis is humanoid giant with large teeth that are always showing. Its upper lip covers its face when it is thrown back. Two long tusks project from the side of its mouth. The giant's only eye is found in the middle of its forehead but this is compensated for by its strong sense of hearing. It also displays unusual strength. In the Filipino tale \\"The Three Friends – The Monkey, The Dog and The Carabao,\\" the giant is able to lift the carabao and throw it with such force that it ends knee-deep in the ground. However, despite its strength, the Bungisngis is easily outwitted and quickly panics.

In 1898, the company was registered as \\"Carl Schwanemeyer, Aachener Stahlwarenfabrik AG\\". From 1902 the name \\"Fafnir\\" started to be used on the company's products, including a range of motorcycle engines. ==Omnimobil and early car production== In 1904, the company started to produce kits, consisting of an engine and associated components, to allow others, particularly bicycle makers, to enter into motor vehicle production. These were sold under the name \\"Omnimobil\\". The kit at first was based around a two-cylinder engine rated at 6 Horsepower(HP) with later a larger option with a four-cylinder, 16 HP unit. Beginning in 1908, finished cars were manufactured with the type \\"274\\" with a 1520 cubic centimetre(cc) engine and a maximum speed of and the type \\"284\\" with 2012cc capable of .

Songs of theirs appeared on Dance To The Radio compilation albums 'Something I Learned Today' and 'Out Of The Woods And Trees', the former featuring 'Summit' and the latter featuring the Napoleon IIIrd remix of 'Keepsakes' In both 2006 and 2007 they appeared on the unsigned stage at the Leeds Festival. During this time they would play around the UK on bills with the likes of Los Campesinos!, Nosferatu D2, Johnny Foreigner, Wild Beasts and others. In 2008 they released the 'Swit Swoo' EP digitally as a covers collection. Amongst those included was 'I Was A Teenage Hand Model' originally by Queens Of The Stone Age and the Bruce Springsteen song 'Because The Night' alongside the more eclectic choice of Jake Thackray's \\"Lah-di-dah\\" The album was recorded in Seattle in Spring 2008 with Sleater-Kinney and Death Cab For Cutie producer John Goodmanson. The band signed to record label Wichita in 2008, and released their debut single on this new label, titled 'Fossil, I', on 20 October 2008. There was an accompanying video for the single which enjoyed success on MTV2 and can be viewed on Youtube.com. Their debut album The Golden Spike was released in February 2009 on Wichita Records. A promotional tour of England, Europe and America (including an appearance at South By Southwest Festival in Texas) took place in spring/summer 2009, and in December 2009 they toured in support of The Cribs. In 2010, the band recorded follow up to their debut and released Kaleide in August, which was preceded by the single, \\"Still Windmills\\". In September 2010, the band headed out on a UK tour. Later that year the band supported Blood Red Shoes, Les Savy Fav and Frightened Rabbit in support of second single \\"Tiny Heist\\". Following the end of the album cycle, Harkin joined the Wild Beasts providing keyboards, drums and backing vocals on a worldwide tour. On 25 January 2012, five years to the day after the band released their first single, Doug Adams announced his amicable departure from the band.

He also played Australian rules football for Essendon and Footscray in the Victorian Football League (VFL). ==Football career== During his time as a footballer Les Stillman played as a half forward. After making his league debut in 1968, Stillman was a semi regular in the Essendon team in 1969 and 1970. His best performance in a game came against Carlton in the opening round of the 1970 VFL season when he kicked six goals. Stillman crossed to Footscray in 1971 and played three senior games there. He then captained Williamstown in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) until 1975, twice placing in the J. J. Liston Trophy count (third in 1973 and second in 1974), and winning the club best and fairest in 1972 and 1973. He resigned the captaincy during 1975 after a disagreement with club hierarchy over the ongoing tenure of coach Ted Whitten, and was cleared to Coburg, where he played the rest of his VFA career. ==Cricket career== His cricket career had begun with a solitary first- class match in 1970/71 but it was not until after leaving the VFL that he established a place in the Victorian Sheffield Shield team. A right-handed middle order batsman, he broke into the side again in 1974/75 and had a solid season with 451 runs at 30.06. He remained with Victoria for a further two Shield seasons but failed to register his maiden first-class hundred, although he managed a half century against a strong West Indian pace attack in a tour game. Stillman did not play any top level cricket from February 1976 to November 1977 and when he came back it was with South Australia, who he represented in the 1977/78 Sheffield Shield season.

She is also a member of the South Korean KLPGA. ==LPGA career== Ji joined the LPGA Tour in 2007 and recorded two top-10 finishes in just four events played, including runner-up at the Hana Bank-KOLON Championship. She made her first appearance in a major championship at the 2007 Women's British Open and finished in 5th place. In 2008, Ji claimed her first LPGA win at the Wegmans LPGA, with a come-from-behind, two-stroke victory over Norwegian star Suzann Pettersen. In 2009, she made a birdie on the 72nd hole of the U.S. Women's Open to win by one stroke. As with the 2008 Wegmans, this was a come- from-behind victory. Trailing Cristie Kerr, Ji overcame a double bogey on the 10th and birdied the 13th, 14th and 18th holes. In 2012, Ji finished tied for second in the LPGA Championship. She had been leading the tournament going into the final round. ==Controversy== After Ji won the 2008 Wegmans LPGA, she gave her acceptance speech with the help of a translator. Some say this sparked the proposed \\"English only\\" requirement by the LPGA. Ji later commented that she felt the proposed requirement may have targeted her and that in the future she would \\"pay more attention to improving my English.\\" Over a year later after winning the U.S. Women's Open, she again used a translator for her acceptance speech. ==Professional wins (9)LPGA Tour (5)=== {  style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" - eeeeee;\\" Legend - e5d1cb;\\"  Major championships (1) -  Other LPGA Tour (4) } {  style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" !No. !Date !Tournament !Winning score !To par !Margin of victory !Runner(s)-up - align=center1 align=right22 Jun 2008 Wegmans LPGA align=right70-71-64-67=272 align=center−16 2 strokes  Suzann Pettersen - e5d1cb;\\" align=center2 align=right12 Jul 2009 U.S. Women's Open align=right71-72-70-71=284 align=centerE 1 stroke  Candie Kung - align=center3 align=right22 Oct 2017 Swinging Skirts LPGA Taiwan Championship align=right66-71-69-65=271 align=center−17 6 strokes  Lydia Ko - align=center4 align=right25 Mar 2018 Kia Classic align=right70-68-67-67=272 align=center−16 2 strokes  Cristie Kerr Lizette Salas - align=center5 align=right20 Jan 2019 Diamond Resorts Tournament of Champions align=right65-69-66-70=270 align=center−14 2 strokes  Mirim Lee } === KLPGA Tour (2)=== *2007 (2) Phoenix Park Classic, KB Star Tour === Ladies Asian Golf Tour (2)=== *2006 (2) Macao Open, Malaysia Open ==Major championshipsWins (1)=== { !Year!!Championship!!Winning score!!Margin!!Runner-up -FBCEB1;\\"  2009  U.S. Women's Open  E (71-72-70-71=284) 1 stroke  Candie Kung } ===Results timeline=== Results not in chronological order before 2019 or in 2020. { cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\\" - eeeeee;\\" !align=\\"left\\"Tournament !! 2007 !! 2008 !! 2009 !! 2010 !! 2011 !! 2012 !! 2013 !! 2014 !! 2015 !! 2016 !! 2017 !! 2018 !! 2019 !! 2020 - align=leftANA Inspiration eeeeee;\\" CUT T36 T75 T25 T11 T48 T29 T29 T32 T47 CUT T26 T44 - align=leftU.S. Women's Open eeeeee;\\" T42 style=\\"background:lime;\\"1 T39 T27 CUT T61 T28 CUT style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T3 T13 T17 T39  - align=leftWomen's PGA Championship eeeeee;\\" T29 T23 CUT T43 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T2 T22 T30 CUT T64 T68 T33 CUT T18 - align=leftThe Evian Championship ^ eeeeee;\\" colspan=6 T37 T61 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T8 T48 T18 T24 T25 eeeeee;\\"NT - align=leftWomen's British Open style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T5 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T3 DQ CUT T37 T53 T25 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T5 CUT T50 T69 CUT CUT eeeeee;\\" } CUT = missed the half-way cut DQ = disqualified NT = no tournament \\"T\\" = tied ===Summary=== { class= style=text-align:center !Tournament !!

The school motto is to \\"Serve Him In Others\\", meaning to serve God in others. As of 2018, There are currently around 840 students enrolled at the college. ==History== In 1955, Vince Crowley called a meeting to explore the possibility of beginning a Catholic Boys school on the eastern side of Toowoomba to \\"eliminate the need for the boys on the eastern side of town to ride their bikes, sometimes dangerously, to St Mary’s College\\".St Joseph's College, 2013 In July plans were drawn up for the college site surrounded by Mackenzie, James and Curzon Streets. Bishop Brennan (then Bishop of the Toowoomba Diocese) approached the Christian Brothers to establish a Community at St Joseph’s. Three Brothers were appointed to the St Joseph's community in October. For the first day of the new college in 1956, 116 boys were enrolled. However, the \\"students had to commence the school year in buildings located behind St Patrick’s Cathedral because the buildings at the current site for the College were not ready. The College, on its current site, was officially opened by Archbishop Duhig of Brisbane and Bishop Brennan of Toowoomba in a ceremony on 2 September 1956. The College was to be for boys for Grades IV to Senior (Years 4-12).St Joseph's College, 2013 On 22 June 1982 it was announced that the Christian Brothers would be withdrawing from the College at the end of 1983. In 1982 the College catered for 314 boys from Years 4 -10.St Joseph's College, 2013 Those students who wanted to continue their schooling for years 11 and 12 had to go elsewhere (generally to St Mary’s College or Downlands College). In 1982 it was also decided that other changes would occur from 1983. The College would be extended to include the Senior years, Years 11 & 12, and the Primary section would gradually be phased out. The College would also become co- educational. 1983 saw the first of the girls enrolled in Year 8. 1985 saw the last of the Primary classes.St Joseph's College, 2013 In 2015, on the 27th of January, St. Joseph's extended its education to include Year 7 students, making it in par with New South Wales high schools.

Meanwhile, President Ramon Mendoza reinforced the club with Gheorghe Hagi, Predrag Spasic (replacing Gheorghe Popescu) and Villaroya. Following a losing streak sinking the team through the 6th place in the league, Mendoza fired Toshack on 25 November 1990 and appointed club legend Alfredo Di Stefano as a new head coach. The team clinched the Supercopa de España, defeating FC Barcelona but the situation in the league was worsened with lost matches against Athletic Bilbao, Osasuna, Atletico Madrid and Barcelona. During February, forward Hugo Sanchez suffered his first injury, and the squad was eliminated early in the Copa del Rey round of 16 by Atletico Madrid. Then in March, with a high risk of failing to qualify for next year's European competitions, the team was defeated by Russian side Spartak Moscow at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in the European Cup quarter-finals, shattering the chances of Alfredo Di Stefano to stay as a coach and he resigned after the elimination. After one game with Ramon Grosso as an interim manager, the club appointed Radomir Antic as a new permanent head coach.

This European standard specifies requirements for the design, testing, performance and equipping of road ambulances used for the transport and care of patients. This standard is applicable to road ambulances capable of transporting at least one person on a stretcher. ==History== The current version of standard CEN 1789 was published by the Comité Européen de Normalisation (European Committee on Standardization) on June 29, 2007. This replaced an early version of the standard, published in 2000. European standards are generally annotated by the organization, standard number and year of publication (e.g. CEN 1789:2000 or CEN 1789/2007). Within member countries, the annotation is likely to be adapted to include the local standards body, so that in Britain, the 'C' is dropped from the prefix, and replaced with 'BS', in Germany with 'DIN', and so on. Because of the likelihood of significant changes between versions, on the most current version of any standard should be used. The Comité Européen de Normalisation is an agency of the government of the European Union, with membership from the National Standards Body of each participating member country. While CEN 1789:2007 represents the current European standard for the design of ambulances, it is by no means the only example of such a standard. Standards for ambulance design have existed in the United States since 1976, where the standard is known as KKK-1822-A. This standard has been revised several times, and is currently in version 'F', known as KKK-1822-F. As with the European system, only the most current version of the standard should be used. One of the first known standards for ambulance design occurred in London, England, as the result of efforts by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, acting in response to the cholera outbreak of 1832. While horse-drawn, this provided the actual standard for many of the earliest civilian ambulances around the world. More contemporary versions of ambulance design standards also exist at a local level in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In each case, the country or jurisdiction develops such standards based upon its own needs, priorities, and realities, and this is also true of the European standard. In some cases, standards compliance may not be planned, and may occur as an incidental result of normal operations. To illustrate, a small country has no domestic ambulance manufacturers, but imports its vehicles from a larger country in which the manufacturer must comply with a published standard. In most cases, the ambulances imported by the smaller country will end up complying with the larger country's standard, regardless of whether or not this outcome was intended. American and Australian standards were reviewed and considered during the development of the European standard, but were not precisely followed because European needs and priorities were different. ==Intent== The standard is intended to gradually transform the existing 'patchwork' of ambulance design and equipment across Europe into a single set of standards. An ambulance from one country would possess sufficiently common characteristics to be immediately recognizable by the residents of another country. Such vehicles would be similar enough in design to be interchangeable, with emergency medical services personnel from one country able to quickly adapt to the use of a vehicle from another country, if required. Above all, such vehicles would be safe for those being transported in them, those working in them, other users of the road, and the general public. ===Vehicle standards=== Austrian MICU; interior design and equipment restraint meet the standard Requirements are specified for categories of road ambulances based in increasing order of the level of treatment that can be carried out. The standard includes both vehicle type and also engine type and performance characteristics, including vehicle dimensions, acceleration rate, braking capacity, traction control, fire safety, and heating/cooling. ===Interior design standards=== The standard contains ergonomic requirements and design specifications for the patient compartment, and also places practical restrictions on the physical lifting of patients in and out of the vehicle, for safety reasons. Other safety factors addressed include lighting, doors & windows, cabinet securing systems, seatbelt and seat anchorage, seat size & position, and restraint of medical equipment, with provisions for static testing, dynamic and impact testing. ===Medical devices=== This Standard gives general requirements for medical devices carried in road ambulances and used therein and outside hospitals and clinics in situations where the ambient conditions can differ from normal indoor conditions. ==Classification of ambulances== Please note that while the classification is standardized in the European Union, the crew and its abilities are not. The same vehicle may be used differently in varying countries. There are also emergency physician based systems in some European states, often with (non-EU regulated) vehicles with medical equipment and therefore lowering the need for the amount of equipment in the ambulance. * Patient transport ambulances (Types A1 and A2) Type A1 is without lights and sirens Type A2 with lights and sirens and can function as emergency ambulances. Generally only used for the non-emergency transportation of patients, either between facilities or between a facility and a residence. The emphasis is on transportation; such ambulances have limited treatment or equipment space. Such ambulances may also be used because of cost by smaller communities, particularly if there is no ALS service. * Emergency ambulances (Type B) The most commonly seen type of emergency ambulance. This vehicle type permits increased treatment space and also the ability to store significantly larger amounts of medical equipment. Such vehicles will typically respond independently to emergency calls, providing some level of treatment. * Mobile intensive care unit (Type C) This type of ambulance is commonly seen in the movement of high acuity (ICU) patients between hospitals. It provides adequate space for not only the medical equipment commonly seen in ambulances, but also to accommodate hospital equipment, such as ventilators, during transport. In some locations, vehicles of this design may be used to provide mobile resuscitation services, either supplemented by an emergency physician response, or with the physician as a part of the crew. In Germany, the vast majority of primary emergency ambulances (Rettungswagen) are required to be Type C ambulance without being dedicated to intensive care transports.

Siren All vehicles must also be equipped with an audible warning system (siren) which meets specified standards for both sound pattern and volume. ===Passive Warning Systems=Vehicle colour=== The Standard specifies that all ambulances will be painted yellow, with specific colour standards, as their primary body colour. The colour yellow was chosen primarily because it remains visible to almost all people in all lighting conditions, including the majority of those with colour- blindness. One ambulance service in Europe that does not conform to the standard is the Scottish Ambulance Service, who use white vehicles with ambulance Battenburg markings. File:East of England Emergancy Ambulance.jpgEnglish ambulance which meets the colour and livery standards File:RAL1016.pngEuro Yellow RAL1016 - the colour Standard for Ambulances File:Swedish ambulance Kronoberg.jpgSwedish Ambulance which meets the colour and livery standards: note the similarities. File:Battenburg- ambulance.svgAmbulance marking scheme File:Battenburg-police.svgPolice marking scheme File:Battenburg-fire.svgFire and Rescue marking scheme Battenburg Pattern All ambulances are to be equipped with highly reflective green and yellow 'checkerboard' markings (the English term is 'Battenburg' pattern), of specified proportions, running the entire length of the vehicle. The intent of this measure was to provide specific 'visual identities' for emergency vehicles, by reserving this pattern for ambulances, blue and yellow Battenburg for police cars, and red and yellow Battenburg for fire service vehicles. In addition, all lettering on the vehicle is required to be highly reflective, in order to boost vehicle visibility in all conditions. The colour combination selected was chosen for specific reasons. Under night time conditions, green is among the most visible (exceeded only by blue) of colours, creating high visibility (and safety) for ambulance vehicles. Unfortunately, for many of those who suffer from colour-blindness, neither green nor red is visible, washing out to shades of grey or dark yellow. In fact, almost 99 percent of all colour vision deficiency involves some form of red-green colour blindness, and includes an estimated 7-10 percent of all males, depending on location. However, even for these individuals, the colour yellow is always visible (see diagram). The resulting pattern is both high visibility and eye-catching for the average person, provides improved night time visibility for most, and provides a combination which is identifiable, at least in part, by the majority of the population. File:Gay flag.svgNormal range of colour vision File:Rainbow Protanopia.svgSame image with one form of red/green colour-blindness (1% of males) File:Rainbow Deuteranopia.svgMost common form of colour-blindness (5% of males) Star of Life The Star of Life The blue Star of Life, the international EMS emblem, must be painted on both sides and on top of the vehicle. The mark must be a minimum of 500mm in diameter. This requirement may be waived if the ambulance is part of a national affiliate of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Society. In this case, the Red Cross (or other authorized ICRC emblem) should be used instead. Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. This requirement may also be waved if use of the Star of Life emblem is restricted by local law. The standard also calls for the Star of Life to be used on EMS clothing and apparel. Word Markings The vehicle must be marked with the English word \\"AMBULANCE\\" and/or the equivalent word in the local language. The text must utilize capital letters, have a letter height of at least 100mm, and the letters must contrast with the background colours. ==Application and compliance== As with most European standards, compliance by the member countries of the European Union is purely voluntary, and to be determined at the level of the member country, usually by means of legislation, or by its own standards organization. To illustrate, this standard, which has been accepted by the United Kingdom, is known locally as BS EN 1789:2007, with the 'BS' referring to British Standards. As a result, the adoption of this standard has varied considerably from one country to another. Most countries, for example, have adopted the sections dealing with vehicle design and performance, while only a few (the UK, Ireland, and Sweden at this writing), have fully adopted the colour, warning system, and livery schemes for such vehicles. To further complicate matters, some countries have adopted some portion of the visual identity standards, but not all. In the Netherlands, Belgium, and some parts of Germany, the conversion to the basic identifying colour (yellow) is occurring, but the balance of visual identity provisions are not. In addition, some countries which are not currently members of the European Union, such as Norway are adopting some portions of the standards, primarily because few other good standards exist for this purpose, particularly those that reflect European realities. The rate and degree of compliance with the standard is a conscious choice by individual countries, while in others, compliance is a matter of the priorities for the changing of older, country specific, legislation. As previously stated, compliance with the standard is purely voluntary. There are no untoward financial implications to compliance, since only ambulances purchased after ratification of the standard by each country are required to be compliant. There is no mandatory provision for the retrofitting of existing ambulances. ==References== Category:Ambulances ","title":"CEN 1789"},{"id":"19258209","text":"An Aviation Security Identification Card (ASIC) is an Australian identification card that shows that the holder of the card has undergone a security check and is suitable to enter a secure area of an Australian Airport. Security checks are performed by AusCheck (part of the Attorney General's Department) and include a criminal records check undertaken by the Australian Federal Police, a security assessment conducted by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) and an unlawful non-citizen check conducted by the Department of Home Affairs. An ASIC is required for all personnel working at a security controlled airport in Australia. Personnel requiring access to a secure airport who are under the age of 18 are required to display an ASIC however issuing bodies can not apply for a security check. An ASIC has to be renewed every two years except for someone who has applied for an ASIC before they turned 18 in which case an ASIC is valid until 6 months after the person's 18th birthday. Only people with an operational need to enter a secure airport may apply for an ASIC. The goal of the ASIC is not just to prevent terrorist activities at airports but to ensure aircraft, equipment and facilities can not be tampered with. The ASIC is a program similar to the Maritime Security Identification Card program found in the maritime and offshore industries. Systems similar to ASIC identification card system exists in Canada (known as Restricted Area Identity Card or RAIC), New Zealand (known as the Airport Identity Card) and in the United States (known as Security identification display area or SIDA). == Obligations == ASIC holders are required to follow specific conditions otherwise they risk losing their ASIC or even face Federal Prosecution. == Types of ASIC == There are three categories of ASIC: Red, Grey, and White. The type of ASIC card needed depends on the level of access required. A card holder's Operational Need determines whether an applicant requires access to airside security zones (Red) or Landside security zones (Grey). On 1 November 2016, authorised ASIC issuing bodies began to issue a new role-specific white ASIC. This type of card is issued to individuals who require a valid background check but do not require access to airport secure areas. To be eligible for a White ASIC, an individual must be a staff member or a contractor of: *a Known Consignor, regulated air cargo agent (RACA) or accredited air cargo agent (AACA) *an ASIC issuing body; or *an airport visitor identification card (VIC) issuer ASIC Security features include: All three types of ASIC have a similar layout. The only difference between the Red ASIC, Grey ASIC, and White ASIC card are the background colours. All ASIC cards feature the following: *A large passport type photo of the ASIC holder to clearly identify them. *ASIC cards can be issued for a specific airport which will have the airport code designation on them, such as SYD or MEL, or they can be issued with the AUS designation, making it valid nationwide. This is one of the key differences to the SIDA card used in the United States, where each airport issues their own card for use at that particular airport only which can present issues for flight crews operating at different airports. *The holders name and Aviation Reference Number (ARN). *A silver Holographic strip with the word 'ASIC' clearly printed and the outlines of an aircraft and Australia. ==Notes== Category:Aviation in Australia ","title":"Aviation Security Identification Card"},{"id":"19258215","text":"Susan Shore Browne Greene Baskervile (died 1648), or Baskerville, was one of the most influential and significant women involved in English Renaissance theatre, as theatre investor, litigant, and wife, widow, and mother of actors. Her first husband was Robert Browne (died 1603), actor and manager of the Boar's Head Theatre. She was his second wife. Her five children by Browne included William Browne, who would act with Queen Anne's Men and Prince Charles's Men in the years between 1616 and his death in 1634.Edwin Nunzeger, A Dictionary of Actors and of Others Associated with the Representation of Plays in England before 1642, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1929; p. 63. Her second husband was the famous clown Thomas Greene, who performed with Queen Anne's Men and who died young in August 1612. (They had a daughter, Honor.) Susan married her third husband, James Baskervile, in June 1613; he was a bigamist who abandoned her and fled to Ireland in 1617.Herbert Berry, The Boar's Head Playhouse, Washington DC, Folger Books, 1986; pp. 71, 74, 76 and ff. Thomas Greene's last will and testament, dated 25 July 1612, left his share in Queen Anne's Men, worth 80 pounds, to his wife. (More precisely, he willed her the value of his share; only actors could be sharers.)C. J. Sisson, \\"Notes on Early Stuart Stage History,\\" Modern Language Review, Vol. 37 No. 1 (January 1942), pp. 25-36. At the time of his death, the company owed Greene an additional £37 10 s., which also passed to Susan. In 1615, after negotiations, the Baskerviles agreed to invest another £57 10 s. in the company; in return they would be paid one shilling and eight pence every day the company played a play, for the remainder of their (the Baskerviles') lifetimes. The company quickly fell behind in its payments; in 1616 the troupe raised the Baskervile pension to 3 s. 8 d., in return for another investment of £38. The Queen's Men still could not meet their payments to Susan Baskervile, and also failed to pay her son William who was acting with them. Susan Baskervile sued Ellis Worth and other members of the Queen's Men. Susan Baskervile won her suit in 1623 -- which forced the acting company to break up.Andrew Gurr, The Shakespearean Stage, 1574-1642, Third edition, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1992; p. 56. The long and complex lawsuit, generally called the Baskervile or Worth/Baskervile suit, solicited depositions from most members of the company, generating a documentary record that is valuable for scholars of English Renaissance drama. \\"Her legal actions have provided much of our knowledge of Queen Anne's Company and of the duties, salaries, and grievances of hired men in the dramatic companies.\\"G. E. Bentley, \\"The Grateful Dead: Actors' Testamentary Bequests to Women 1580-1651,\\" Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 135 No. 3 (September 1991), pp. 382-7; see p. 384. Christopher Beeston and Thomas Heywood, among others, gave testimony on the side of Baskervile, while Richard Baxter among others gave testimony for the actors. Richard Perkins, great actor that he was, gave a deposition favoring Baskervile on 13 October 1623, and another favoring the actors a day later.C. J. Sisson, \\"The Red Bull Company and the Importunate Widow,\\" Shakespeare Survey Vol. 7 (1954); Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2002; p. 58. In his 1634 will, William Browne made his mother his executor; with William's death in November of that year, Susan Baskervile acquired control of William's share in the Red Bull company, so called after the theatre it occupied.S. P. Cerasano and Marion Wynne-Davies, eds., Renaissance Drama by Women: Texts and Documents, London, Routledge, 1996; pp. 173-4. Within a year, Baskervile was involved in litigation with William's widow Anne Browne. Susan Baskervile also invested in the second Fortune Theatre, rebuilt after the original burned down in 1621. Another lawsuit, begun in 1637, reveals that Baskervile owned one of the 24 shares in that theatre through the end of the period of English Renaissance drama, when the theatres were closed in September 1642 at the start of the English Civil War. The suit was still active in 1648, when Baskervile filed a deposition in the matter.S. P.

It was filmed near Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. It had a limited theatrical release on October 31, 2008. HDNet Movies aired the film two days prior to its theatrical release.HDNet / Splinter ==Plot== The film opens on a sleepy gas station, where the pump attendant is attacked by a rabid animal. The attendant's body begins to contort. A young couple, Seth Belzer (Paulo Costanzo) and Polly Watt (Jill Wagner), drive for a romantic camping trip in the forests of Oklahoma, but their plans are shattered when they are car-jacked by an escaped convict, Dennis Farell (Shea Whigham), and his drug-addict girlfriend, Lacey Belisle. The group gets a flat tire when they run over a splinter-infected animal on the road. They find shelter at the now-abandoned gas station. Lacey discovers the horribly-infected pump attendant, writhing in the bathroom. She is attacked and dies, but her corpse slowly reanimates and becomes a new creature, which attacks the remaining survivors. While fighting her, Seth, Polly and Dennis discover that severed pieces of the infected victims are capable of attacking on their own. Sheriff Terry Frankel arrives and attempts to arrest Dennis, but is ripped in half by Lacey's corpse. The creature takes the top half of the officer's body and bonds with it, becoming a larger creature. The trio hide in the walk-in refrigerator when a piece of the creature's arm attacks them. It is discovered that Dennis has been infected, as his left arm violently twists on its own. Seth and Polly amputate his arm to prevent the infection from spreading. Dennis explains that he had been pricked by a splinter from the dead creature they encountered on the road. Seth discovers that the creatures are actually a fungus taking control of the corpses they infect and consuming the blood, and they hunt based on temperature, attacking the warmest thing they can find. By lowering his body temperature with bags of ice, Seth is able to sneak past the creature to the police car, while Polly and Farell distract it with fireworks. Seth discovers that, without the keys, the car and the police radio inside, are useless. His body temperature rises again, forcing Dennis to leave the gas station to lure the creature away from him. As a result, the creature manages to enter the gas station and Dennis and Polly hide in the freezer once more. The discarded fireworks ignite the trail of flammable liquid and the gas station catches on fire. Seth is able to retrieve a shotgun from the police car and helps Polly and Dennis escape. Dennis offers to keep the creature at bay while Seth and Polly escape, and is infected in the process. He shoots one of the gas pumps with the shotgun and the creature is engulfed in flames. The creature dies but Dennis is still infected. He gives Seth and Polly a key to a bank account, telling them to give it to the wife of a man he shot, who later died. Dennis shoots the propane tanks, incinerating himself, the station, and any remaining infected corpses. Seth and Polly leave, but the final scene reveals that there are other infected creature corpses lying dormant in the woods. == Cast == * Jill Wagner as Polly Watt * Paulo Costanzo as Seth Belzer * Shea Whigham as Dennis Farell * Rachel Kerbs as Lacey Belisle * Laurel Whitsett as Sheriff Terri Frankell * Charles Baker as Blake Sherman Jr. ==ReceptionCritical reception=== On Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Splinter received an approval rating of 74% rating based on 35 reviews with an average rating of 6.3/10. Its consensus reads, \\"Never taking itself too seriously, Splinter scores as a fast-paced, fun thriller with more than enough scares.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Claudia Puig from USA Today gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, writing, \\"This is classic Halloween fun with plenty of thrills and chills, surprisingly believable performances and healthy doses of humor.\\" Chuck Wilson from The Village Voice wrote, \\"Buoyed by solid ensemble work, some yuckily effective special effects, and a script that subverts genre convention by having its characters do smart things instead of stupid ones (mostly), Splinter earns our respect while delivering 82 minutes of lean, mean fun.\\" The film was not without its detractors. Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle awarded the film 1.5 out of 5 stars, stating that the film \\"would have made a far more effective short than the feature-length drag it is.\\" ===Awards=== Splinter won six awards at the Screamfest Horror Film Festival: Best Editing, Best Score, Best Special Effects, Best Make-Up, Best Directing and Best Picture. Splinter was a nominee for Best Horror Film at the 35th Annual Saturn Awards, but it lost to Hellboy II: The Golden Army. It was also nominated in Spike TV's 2009 Scream Awards for Most Memorable Mutilation for the arm removal scene, but lost to Saw V's Pendulum Trap. ==References* * * Category:2008 films Category:2008 horror films Category:2000s monster movies Category:American films Category:American monster movies Category:American natural horror films Category:English- language films Category:Fictional parasites and parasitoids Category:Films scored by Elia Cmíral Category:Films shot in Oklahoma Category:Films set in Oklahoma Category:Syfy original films Category:Films directed by Toby Wilkins ","title":"Splinter (2008 film)"},{"id":"19258269","text":"The 2008 Bronze Helmet (, BK) is the 2008 version of Bronze Helmet organized by the Polish Motor Union (PZM).

Wrangel entered military service at the age of 15 and participated in several of the Charles XII's campaigns during the Great Northern War, in the process of which he was promoted to captain of Svea Life Guards and Lieutenant Colonel of Skånska ståndsdragonerna, but was captured in 1709 after the Battle of Poltava.

After the executions, the Vichy government sought to discredit the resistance members, and widely distributed and posted thousands of copies of the Affiche Rouge. Named for its red background, the poster featured ten of the Manouchian group, including Elek. It identified him as \\"Elek Juif Hongrois 8 déraillements\\" (Elek, Hungarian Jew, 8 derailments). Elek had immigrated as a child with his family from Hungary to France in 1930, when they settled in Paris. After France fell to Nazi Germany in 1940 and enemy forces occupied Paris, he dropped out of the lycée and became involved in underground resistance movements. He was credited with armed attacks on German soldiers, including a train derailment in July 1943 that resulted in the death of 600 men. ==BiographyEarly years=== Thomas Elek was born in Budapest, Hungary on the 7 December, 1924 to a family of communist intellectuals. The Elek family (Thomas, his father Sandor, his sister Marthe and his mother Hélène, then pregnant with his brother, Bela) emigrated to France in 1930. They settled in Paris, where his mother, after various minor jobs, became a restaurateur in 1934 ===Second World War=== Elek left the Lycée Louis-le-Grand at the age of 16, to become involved in the underground movement after Nazi German forces defeated France and occupied Paris. He joined a group of students at the Sorbonne who were linked to the Groupe du musée de l'Homme, wrote and distributed tracts, and stuck papillons (butterflies - flyers) to walls. In August 1942, sympathising with the Jeunesses Communistes (Communist Youth), he became involved with the FTP-MOI (Francs-tireurs et partisans - Main-d'œuvre immigrée) and took up the armed struggle of resistance. His nom de guerre was KERPAL. Shortly after, Elek was assigned a solo attack on the Rive Gauche German bookstore, in which he used a booby-trapped copy of Marx's Capital. In March 1943, along with the young Czech, Pavel Simo, he made a grenade attack on a restaurant reserved for German officers at Asnières. Simo was arrested, and executed on 22 May 1943 at the Stand de tir de Balard. On 1 June 1943 in a spontaneous attack, Elek threw two grenades into a group of 70 Germans in front of the Jaurès metro station. He was promoted and named head of the group at the center of the 4th detachment of the FTP-MOI Paris region; they were known as des dérailleurs and commanded by Joseph Boczov. Elek participated in several railway derailments, notably that of 28 July on the Paris-Château- Thierry line. This derailment is said to have caused the death of 600 German soldiers. In 1943 Elek was arrested with others of the Manouchian Group and tortured by the Vichy Brigades Spéciales. He was transferred to the Germans and detained in Fresnes Prison. All but the sole woman member of the Manouchian group were condemned to death in a show trial by military officers, and executed by firing squad three days later, 21 Feb 1944, at Mont Valérien. The woman was beheaded at another site. ==Legacy== *Rather than acting as a deterrent, the Affiche Rouge inspired citizens to more actions with the Résistance.

She was noted for being one of the first magicians to appear on television, on her own show, The Dell O'Dell Show, on ABC's local station in Los Angeles in 1951. She was also one of few American women to have her own circus, the Della O'Dell Society Circus, which toured the Midwest in 1925 and 1926. Before becoming one of the most popular female magicians on the night club circuit during the 1930s, 40s, and 50s, Dell O'Dell also performed in vaudeville and burlesque. Her skills included juggling furniture and lecturing on physical culture. At an early stage of her career, she acquired the rights to the comedy magic act of Frank Van Hoven (1886-1929) and created her own versions of his burlesque magic tricks. At the height of her career, she was billed as \\"The World's Leading Lady Magician\\" and \\"The Queen of Magic.\\" Odella Newton's father Lucky Bill Newton (1859-1937) ran his own circus, and she began learning juggling from the performers on his circus when she was young. She developed a style that featured snappy patter and cute rhymes, which became something of a trademark. In 1931, she married Charles Carrer (1898-1971), a famous juggler from Zurich, Switzerland, who sometimes assisted in her show and rebuilt and repaired props for her. She became a pioneer of television magic when The Dell O'Dell Show began transmission on a local station in the Los Angeles area in California on 14 September 1951. She thus pre-dated several other noted pioneers of television magic, such as Mark Wilson, whose first television show began in 1955, and Richiardi Jr who made the first of his record run of appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1956. O'Dell wrote frequently on the subject of magic. For eight years in the 1940s, she contributed a column titled \\"Dell-lightfully\\" for the magicians' magazine The Linking Ring. She also produced a number of books of tricks and performance routines, including Presenting Magical Moments (1939) and On Both Sides of the Footlights (1946), though both books were ghost-written for her. Her \\"Stamp Album\\" presentation was published in volume 4 of the Tarbell Course in Magic. O'Dell died age 64 of multiple myeloma and left her body to UCLA Medical Center for scientific research. Her husband Charlie died on December 25, 1971. In 2014, Michael Claxton's biography of O'Dell, Don't Fool Yourself: The Magical Life of Dell O'Dell, was released by Squash Publishing. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * \\"Use Your Illusion, A mystical history of the women who broke the lovely assistant mold and sawed the boys' club of magic in half\\", Bust Magazine, June/July 2008 * Julie Sobanski, article on Dell O'Dell, MUM magazine, August 2007 ==External links== * Picture of Dell O'Dell at the National Library of Australia * Web site devoted to Dell O'Dell by The Houdini Museum Category:American magicians Category:1902 births Category:1962 deaths Category:Deaths from multiple myeloma ","title":"Dell O'Dell"},{"id":"19258361","text":"George Land was a professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1920s.

The game was released in Japan on December 25, 2008; in North America on November 10, 2009; and in Europe on February 12, 2010. The game expands on the gameplay mechanics of Phantasy Star Online, partly by borrowing some elements from fellow online Phantasy Star title Phantasy Star Universe, such as a fully realized story mode for offline play. ==Character generation and archetypes== Phantasy Star Zero continues the character creation mechanics from Phantasy Star Online. The player first chooses a race, each with their own strengths: versatile Humans; powerful, hulking androids called CASTs; or nimble but fragile genetically engineered Newmans. The choice affects the character's perspective on the story and what order in which the first three zones are tackled, but ultimately all three end identically. The player then chooses the character's gender and archetype. Males tend to favor physical strength and durability; females tend to favor accuracy, evasion and techniques, Phantasy Star's equivalent to magic. ===Hunters=== Hunters use short ranged weapons like swords daggers and spears. Human and Newman hunters may also wield empowering techniques. ===Rangers=== Rangers are primarily ranged attackers. They are most effective fighting at long range with various guns and heavy artillery, but can also make use of gunblades. Human rangers can also use de-powering techniques on targets. Newmans cannot become rangers. ===Forces=== Forces excel at using techniques. Techniques are used to buff and heal teammates and debuff and damage enemies. Though all Humans and Newmans can use some techniques, only forces can use the light-based Grants and dark-based Megid and only forces can learn the higher-tier ranks of all techniques. Forces favor technique weapons such as staffs and wands. This archetype is unavailable to CASTs. ===NPCs=== There are also four non playable characters who can accompany the player during story mode: Sarisa: A cheerful and sunny newman youth who came down from the moon. She is an avid book reader with a love of adventure stories, and is a skill-type character due to her weak defenses and strong healing techniques. Ogi: One of the best hunters in Dairon City's Hunter's Guild, who is deeply interested in the past due to his amnesia, shared by many CASTs. He is a balanced character, but is unable to use techniques. Kai: A top hunter in Dairon City's Hunter's Guild. He generally acts in a carefree manner, but he has faced great tragedy in the past, and is something of a father figure for the player character and Sarisa. He is a power-type character. Reve: An elite newman in Mother Trinity's police force. He joins the player after having his faith shaken. He has great skill with lightning techniques and is a speed-type character. ==GameplayOnline and offline modes=== Similar to Phantasy Star Online, players can shop, bank, accept quests, and access combat areas from a city-like hub. In the offline Story Mode, the player gains AI allies and progresses a narrative, which includes multiple cut scenes and dialogue sequences. Once completed, the player can access higher difficulty levels to earn increasingly powerful gear and further grow their characters. The game also contains three online modes: Free Play, in which the player is randomly paired up with a party of one to three users; Play With Friends, where the player can invite friends into a private room (and vice versa); and Play Alone, where the player can play online by oneself to complete online-only missions and be notified of friends' connection status. ===Communication=== Featured in the game is \\"Visual Chat\\", a take on PictoChat where players communicate by drawing and writing on the DS touch screen. According to the February 2009 issue of Nintendo Power (Vol. 238, page 38), \\"Up to 20 messages may be saved to shortcuts so they're accessible at any time via a quick tap of the touch screen\\". Players can also write freely to each other throughout a game session without the use of pre- composed messages. However, communication among unfamiliar users is limited to preset chat. Even considering its limitations, the preset phrases offer an unprecedented amount of communication between anonymous users from anywhere in the world over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Players will receive the preset phrase in their own languages as well as the speakers'. ===Gear and character optimization=== The game contains over 350 weapons, debuting two new weapon classes, shields and gunblades. Shields are blunt weapons that can be used to block enemy attacks, and gunblades are one-handed swords that also carry a gun barrel, allowing for long range and short range interchangeability by holding the Left Trigger button. Most equipment can be upgraded through various means. Items called grinders can further improve a weapon or armor's effectiveness. In addition, weapons can be upgraded with elements, allowing them special on- hit effects or additional damage, and \\"Photon Fortification,\\" which increases a weapon's effectiveness against a hostile classification of the player's choosing. Characters can be further specialized by using materials, items that permanently increase a base stat. ==Development== The decision to develop Phantasy Star 0 for the Nintendo DS was made to expand the appeal of the series to younger gamers. The word Zero was affixed to the title to represent \\"a new start for the series\\" and separate itself from the main series games in favor of the Nintendo GameCube games. Artist Toshiyuki Kubooka, made famous by his work on the Lunar series and Giant Robo anime, designed the game's characters with an \\"uplifting\\" aesthetic. The game was exhibited at Tokyo Game Show (TGS) 2008 as part of Sega's lineup of new DS games. ==DSiWare version== A smaller version of the game, Phantasy Star 0 Mini, was released for the Nintendo DSiWare service on March 25, 2009. Sega also mentioned the possibility of a new Nintendo DSi-exclusive downloadable stage for the game, possibly one from the original Phantasy Star Online. A poll for players to pick their favorite classic stage would be held on Sega of Japan's website at a later date. ==Reception== The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Famitsu gave it a score of two eights, one nine, and one eight for a total of 33 out of 40; the authors praised the game's controls, game play, and online mode, noting, \\"it really feels like an online game in the palm of your hand.\\" The publication criticized the game's \\"softness of the sound.\\" Nintendo Power gave good remarks towards the game, but heavily criticized the menu setup and the loss to change weapons during gameplay. Phantasy Star 0 sold approximately 84,055 copies during its debut week in Japan. ==NotesReferences *Official website *Phantasy Star 0 Mini at Nintendo.co.jp * Category:2008 video games Category:Cooperative video games Category:Multiplayer online games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Nintendo DS-only games Category:Phantasy Star video games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Sega video games Category:Single-player online games Category:Sonic Team games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games featuring protagonists of selectable gender Category:DSiWare games ","title":"Phantasy Star 0"},{"id":"19258397","text":"The Amity Affliction is an Australian metalcore band from Gympie, Queensland, formed in 2003. The band's current line-up consists of Ahren Stringer (bass, clean vocals), Joel Birch (lead vocals), Dan Brown (guitar) and Joe Longobardi (drums). The Amity Affliction has released seven studio albums including Severed Ties (2008), Youngbloods (2010), Chasing Ghosts (2012), Let the Ocean Take Me (2014), This Could Be Heartbreak (2016) and Misery (2018), the latter four debuting at number one on the ARIA charts. They are known for their highly personal songs, often dealing with depression, anxiety, death, substance abuse, and suicide, many lyrics stemming from vocalist Joel Birch's past struggles. The Amity Affliction released their latest album, Everyone Loves You... Once You Leave Them, on 21 February 2020. ==HistoryFormation and early releases (2003–2008)=== The Amity Affliction formed in Gympie, a South-East Queensland town in Australia by friends Ahren Stringer, Joseph Lilwall and Troy Brady in their final year of high school. The band was named for a close friend of the band, who died in a car accident at the age of 17. 'Amity' referred to the friendship and 'Affliction' was to indicate the struggle which dealing with the death caused the band members. Whilst still at High School, the band spent many times playing at school concerts and lunch breaks. In 2004, The Amity Affliction released a three track self-titled demo produced by Scott Mullane at Aisle 6 Recording. At the time there were four members with former members Garth Buchanan on bass and Lachlan Faulkner on drums. In late 2004, vocalist Joel Birch joined the band. Following, mid-2005, The Amity Affliction released their debut self-titled EP. After the release of the EP they toured the East Coast on their 2005 East Coast Tour. In 2007, there was a line up change when Lachlan Faulkner quit and Garth Buchanan left to join Behind Crimson Eyes. Lachlan Faulkner later joined Saint Lucia. They then hired drummer, Troels Thomasson, Chris Burt on guitar (originally on bass), Ahren Stringer now on bass and the addition of a keyboardist, Trad Nathan. The Amity Affliction released a new five track EP entitled High Hopes which was named for the house in which The Amityville Horror took place. The first pressing came in a CD/DVD package. The DVD featured the band discussing the recording of the EP, it also featured the band on the road and performing. ===Severed Ties (2008–2010)=== The band released their debut studio album in 2008, entitled Severed Ties. The album spent a week on the Australian Albums Chart at number 26. It is the first album to feature Chris Burt's brother Ryan Burt on drums. The album features guest vocals from Michael Crafter of I Killed the Prom Queen/Confession, Matthew Wright of the Getaway Plan, JJ Peters of I Killed the Prom Queen/Deez Nuts/Grips 'N' Tonic, Helmet Roberts and Lochlan Watt (Nuclear Summer). A music video was released for the song Fruity Lexia. The Amity Affliction played numerous shows across Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. During May 2009, they supported the Getaway Plan along with Perth band Elora Danan, on the Getaway Plan's national Finale Tour. The Amity Affliction undertook a headlining tour across Australia in 2009. They also played the 2009 Stairway to Hell Tour across Australia with support from UK band We Are the Ocean and Melbourne band Hopeless, with a local support band for each city. The Amity Affliction then went to the UK for a full tour supporting We Are the Ocean alongside Flood of Red and All Forgotten. ===Youngbloods and Glory Days (2010–2011)=== In late 2009, The Amity Affliction parted ways with guitarist Christopher Burt. The decision was mutual and had been planned for some time. His last show was in London in December 2009. While all the members are still good friends with Chris, the decision was made in the best interest of the band musically. Chris now plays guitar and sings in Brisbane based band SENSaii. Afterwards, Clint Ellis (Splattering) from the Getaway Plan took his place. In April 2010, the band flew out to New York to record their second full-length record with producer Machine. On 10 May, the band uploaded a new song from this album, \\"I Hate Hartley\\" on their MySpace and the song was later available for free download. On a pushed-forward date on 18 June as announced on their website (originally 25 June 2010), the band released their second studio album Youngbloods on Boomtown and Shock Records. The album was a huge success for the band, receiving critical acclaim and debuting at number 6 on the ARIA charts. The Amity Affliction went on tour in July to support the release of their second album. Joining them was Misery Signals, fellow Australians Confession and Scottish band Flood of Red. They toured Western Australia a few weeks later, joined by local band Break Even. In October, the band announced they would be releasing Glory Days, which would be a compilation of old demos and the first two EPs as well as two B-sides from Youngbloods. Glory Days was released on 26 November. They then announced a UK tour with Asking Alexandria and one following with long-time friends Deez Nuts, Endwell and Louie Knuxx. In the autumn of 2010, The Amity Affliction had their first American interview with alternative scene magazine Substream Music Press for its 22nd issue, just after signing to The Artery Foundation. The band found out they would be performing at the next Soundwave festival during the actual interview for the article. On 30 May 2011, the band released their second music video from Youngbloods; following the music video for \\"I Hate Hartley\\", the new music video for the song \\"Youngbloods\\" was released exclusively on Guvera.com. In late 2011, the band embarked on their headline nationwide tour, Fuck the Reaper, with supporting acts Asking Alexandria, Skyway and a local band in each city. ===Chasing Ghosts (2012–2013)=== During the 17 September 2011 show in Townsville, Queensland, vocalist Joel Birch announced that they were planning to head over to America early 2012 to record their third album. Then again on 22 September 2011, Ahren stated in an interview with Alt Music Hub that the band planned to begin recording their new album in March/April 2012. On 8 February 2012, it was announced that The Amity Affliction had been signed to Roadrunner Records for their next album and future. On 7 May 2012, the band headed over to Orlando, Florida to start recording their third album with producer Michael Baskette. On 7 June 2012, it was announced the band's third studio album would be titled Chasing Ghosts and was set to be released on 7 September 2012 in Australia, 17 September for the UK, and 18 September for the US. It was revealed in a news article and magazine cover posted on 13/14 August that guitarist Imran Siddiqi would no longer be a part of the band. Furthermore, Siddiqi then did not appear in the video clip for the single \\"Chasing Ghosts\\" released on 15 August. A fill in guitarist played their album tour and U.S tour in late 2012. After the release of Chasing Ghosts, the band had an Australian nationwide tour in September–October promoting their new album with supporting acts the Ghost Inside, Architects and Buried in Verona. Amity appeared on Soundwave in 2013 in February–March and also Warped Tour Australia at the end of the year.

In 2013, The Amity Affliction was part of Warped Tour in the United States with Chad Hasty (Glass Cloud) on drums and percussion due to Ryan Burt severely damaging his cornea during a set in Portland, Oregon. Later in the tour vocalist Joel Birch was also hospitalized due to unspecified illness, forcing the band to cancel their set in Pittsburgh. The band's next show in Cleveland was played due to the help of Sam Carter (Architects), Jason Aalon Butler (Letlive) and Chris Roetter (Like Moths to Flames) sharing the stage as replacement vocals for Joel. All shows after this were played with Joel back on vocals after his recovery. === Let the Ocean Take Me (2014–2015) === The Amity Affliction playing the Big Ass Tour in Sydney in December 2015.

In late 2013, the band released a demo of the song \\"Cave In\\". The single was speculated to be featured on the upcoming album. However, this was proved false when the band announced the track list for their upcoming fourth studio album. The first single from the bands forthcoming album titled \\"Pittsburgh\\" was released on 14 April. The second single \\"Don't Lean on Me\\" was released on 15 May. The album itself, titled Let the Ocean Take Me, was released on 6 June in Australia, 9 June in the UK, and 10 June in the U.S. it debuted at No. 1 on the Australian ARIA albums chart, becoming the band's second consecutive No. 1.

On 18 May 2015, The Amity Affliction released a trailer for their upcoming documentary film titled Seems Like Forever on YouTube. The video description contains links to pre-order the film, released on 10 July 2015 as a stand- alone DVD or a deluxe two-disc edition CD version of Let the Ocean Take Me, including two unreleased tracks, \\"Skeletons\\" (featured in the trailer) and \\"Farewell\\".

On 9 August, the band released a lyric video for the song \\"All Fucked Up\\" on YouTube. The band was also featured on the Fearless compilation Punk Goes Pop Vol. 7, covering The Weeknd's hit song \\"Can't Feel My Face\\". A music video for the cover was released on 22 June 2017. The Amity Affliction officially announced that Ryan Burt departed from the band due to mental health reasons on 5 February 2018. He remains on hiatus as of current. === Misery (2018–2019) === On 20 June 2018, The Amity Affliction released the first single, \\"Ivy (Doomsday)\\", from their upcoming sixth studio album, Misery. The band announced that the album will be released on 24 August through Roadrunner Records. The band released an official video along with the release of \\"Ivy (Doomsday)\\". The band released the song \\"Feels Like I'm Dying\\" as a second part to the \\"Ivy (Doomsday)\\" video. The official track listing was eventually revealed on the band's website. It is their fourth album in a row to hit number one on the Aria Albums Chart. On 29 January 2019, the band released a music video for \\"Drag the Lake\\", the first to feature new drummer Joe Longobardi of Defeater fame, who replaced Ryan Burt after he departed the band back in 2018. In September the band will complete an East Coast Tour of Australia with Underoath, Crossfaith and Pagan. === Signing to Pure Noise Records and Everyone Loves You... Once You Leave Them (2019–present)=== On 6 September 2019, the band released their new song, \\"All My Friends Are Dead\\" accompanied with a music video. The song marks a return to the band's heavier elements; it is their first release under Pure Noise Records. On 31 December, it was revealed that the band would be releasing their new album on 21 February after the German version of Amazon accidentally leaked the product listing for the effort. The band have also released a sneak peek of an upcoming track from the album. On 8 January 2020, the band confirmed their seventh album, Everyone Loves You... Once You Leave Them, would be released on 21 February 2020, along with unveiling the track list for the album. Along with the confirmation of the album they released the second single from the outing, \\"Soak Me in Bleach\\", accompanied with a music video. On 29 January, the band released the next single from the album, \\"Catatonia\\", which harks back to their earlier heavier sound. On 20 October, the band released two B-Side songs that didn't make it on their seventh album, Everyone Loves You... Once You Leave Them called \\"Midnight Train\\" and \\"Don't Wade in the Water\\". ==Controversy== Shortly after the announcement of the Chasing Ghosts album, the album's cover was revealed. The cover depicts a man hanging from a tree who is thought to have committed suicide. The graphic nature of this image caused much controversy among social media. The situation was very ironic due to the main message behind the album being anti-suicide and urging fans who feel suicidal to turn to people close to them and seeking help rather than taking their own life. The band later apologized for the artwork along with the responses band members made to fans regarding the artwork. Later uses of the cover art would remove the hanging man.

Paralympic swimmers compete at the Summer Paralympic Games and at other sports competitions throughout the world. The sport is governed by the International Paralympic Committee. Both men and women compete in Paralympic swimming, racing against competitors of their own gender. Swimming has been a part of the Paralympic program since the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy. == Rules == Rules for the sport are adapted from those set forth by the International Swimming Federation (FINA). Swimmers compete individually in backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, freestyle, individual medley, and as teams in relay races. At the Paralympics, World Championships and other elite level competitions, swimmers compete in an Olympic-size swimming pool. Swimming pool with multiple diving platforms Significant differences between able-bodied and Paralympic swimming include the starting position and adaptations allowed for visually impaired swimmers. Competitors may start a race by standing on a platform and diving into the pool, as in non-disabled swimming, or by sitting on the platform and diving in, or they may start the race in the water. In events for the blind and visually impaired, people called \\"tappers\\" may stand at the end of the pool and use a pole to tap the swimmers when they approach the wall, indicating when the swimmer should turn or end the race. No prostheses or assistive devices may be worn during competition. == Classification == Australian swimmer Brendan Burkett at the 1996 Summer Paralympics in Atlanta, USA. Swimmers are classified according to the type and extent of their disability. The classification system allows swimmers to compete against others with a similar level of function. Swimmers with physical disabilities are allocated a category between 1 and 10, with 1 corresponding to the most severe types of disability. Physical disabilities of Paralympic swimmers include single or multiple limb loss (through birth defects and/or amputation), cerebral palsy, spinal cord injuries (leading to paralysis or disability in limb coordination), dwarfism, and disabilities which impair the use of joints. Blind and visually impaired swimmers compete within separate categories, being allocated to categories 11, 12 or 13. Category 11 corresponds to totally blind swimmers, while competitors in category 13 have severe but not total visual impairment. Category 11 swimmers compete with blackened goggles to ensure competitors are on an even level. Category 11 swimmers are also required to use tappers but they are optional for category 12 and 13.https://m.paralympic.org/swimming/classification Swimmers with mental disabilities compete in category 14. Numbers are combined with a letter prefix depending on the event type. An \\"S\\" prefix corresponds to freestyle, backstroke and butterfly, while \\"SB\\" corresponds to breaststroke and \\"SM\\" to the medley. Hence, a swimmer with severe physical disabilities competing in backstroke may compete in an S3 event, while a blind swimmer in the medley would compete in class SM11. For relay races, athletes from different classifications compete together, but the sum of their individual classifications must not exceed a given points total. For example, a relay team for a 34 points freestyle relay may consist of two S8 swimmers and two S9 swimmers (9 + 9 + 8 + 8 = 34), or an S10 swimmer and three S8 swimmers (10 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 34) == Medal table == Updated to 2016 Summer Paralympics.

He played in defence. Born in Willington, Cheshire, he was signed from Nottingham amateur football team Boots Athletic in 1930 for the fee of £25. His debut was inauspicious, playing in the 7–2 defeat by Liverpool. He suffered both relegation and promotion with the club, and in 1936 was made captain of the team by manager Charles Foweraker. In total he played 306 games for the club, scoring 23 times. On 8 April 1939, with World War II seemingly inevitable, Goslin stood in front of a microphone in the middle of Burnden Park and told the assembled crowd that after the game the Bolton team would make their way to the local Territorial Army hall to sign up. When Germany invaded Poland, the cessation of official football games was immediate but local games were allowed and, subject to leave, Goslin played in four games for Bolton as well as guesting for Chelsea and Norwich City when posted temporarily in the south of England and East Anglia. He was also selected for an unofficial international for England against Scotland. The majority of the team were posted to the 53rd (Bolton) Field Regiment and Goslin, now promoted to sergeant, and the other players saw action in France leading up to the withdrawals at Dunkirk. Back in England Goslin was promoted to Lieutenant for his actions in the withdrawal. The regiment were sent to East Anglia to patrol potential enemy landing sites and Goslin was again selected for England, again to play Scotland, twice, as well as Wales. In the summer of 1942 the regiment set sail for Egypt and took part in the defence of Alam el Halfa. With victory in the campaign, the regiment were sent to Kirkurk and then Kifri, where various members of the Bolton team, including Goslin, played for the British Army against the Polish Army in a 4–2 victory. The 53rd Regiment then joined in the invasion of Italy, making their way from Taranto to Foggia without much trouble. They then took part in the battle to take control of the River Sangro crossing. Fighting took place for over a month and a number of Goslin's fellow Bolton players were removed. On 14 December 1943, a mortar bomb exploded in the tree under which Goslin had made his observation point. He was hit in the back by shrapnel and wood and mortally wounded although he fought for life for a few more days. He left a wife and two children, one of whom, his son Bob, became a senior figure in the Bolton police as well as in South Yorkshire and Cambridgeshire. He died in August 2008. As a mark of respect, the Bolton players lined up before the centre stand of Burnden Park for a minute's silence and wearing black armbands before their New Year's Day War League game. Goslin and Walter Sidebottom were the only team members to die during the war. Goslin is buried at the Sangro River War Cemetery. ==See also== * List of footballers killed during World War II ==References== * ===Internet=== Category:1909 births Category:1943 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Cheshire Category:English footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Boots Athletic F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Bolton Wanderers F.C. players Category:Recipients of the Military Cross Category:British Army personnel of World War II Category:British military personnel killed in World War II Category:Royal Artillery officers ","title":"Harry Goslin"},{"id":"19258461","text":"The Groupe du musée de l'Homme (French for 'Group of the Museum of Man') was a movement in the French resistance to the German occupation during the Second World War. In July 1940, after the Appeal of 18 June from Charles de Gaulle, a resistance group was created by intellectuals and academics led by Anatole Lewitsky and Boris Vildé, along with Paul Hauet. They were not Gaullists; since they were prisoners of war (Vildé escaped on 5 July and Lewitsky was freed in August), it is highly improbable that they had heard de Gaulle's broadcast. However, once Gaullist propaganda took hold, with its message of escape from dishonour, the group fell in with it. Germaine Tillion said, \\"I do not remember from what date we started to call ourselves Gaullists: it was not at the beginning at any rate. But we did consider General de Gaulle to be right, or at least to be a man who thought as we did. But we knew nothing about him\\". They were joined by other groups in September. Raymond Burgard, René Iché, Claude Aveline, Marcel Abraham, Jean Cassou (who launched the newspaper Résistance), René-Yves Creston, Germaine Tillion and her mother, Émilie Tillion, were also part of the network.

Norwegian national roads (Norwegian: Riksvei/Riksveg abbr.

In 2007 there were of this class of Norwegian roads, which constituted 29.4% of public roads in Norway.

For municipal roads not all municipalities are up to date. From 2010, after an administrative reform, most of the national roads were transferred to the counties. They are now called county roads along with the already existing county roads. of national roads were transferred along with an annual compensation of 6.9 billion NOK for maintenance. So as of January 1, 2010 there were of national roads left. The national roads are selected by the criteria of being important for long- distance travel. Also some roads connecting to primary airports are included. The national roads are divided into two categories: European routes and other national roads. The route signs for the European routes have an \\"E\\" preceding the national road number and the sign is green with white script. Other national roads are also designated using green signs. ==Former national roads == All pre-2010 national roads have an asphalt concrete cover. Exceptions are some roads that have been given special status or protection. The \\"gravel roads package\\" was a governmental plan which saw to it that all national roads that hadn't been given special value in the National Protection Plan for Roads, Bridges, and Road-Related Cultural Heritage (Nasjonal verneplan for veger, bruer og vegrelaterte kulturminner) received asphalt covering. Norwegian National Road 716 between Bergli and Valen in Frøya, Sør-Trøndelag was the last regular stretch of national road with a gravel coating. The last two remaining kilometers were asphalted on December 17, 2003 with participation by among others Minister of Transport and Communications Torild Skogsholm. Norwegian former national roads that are being maintained as gravel roads according to the protection plan are road 252 (Tyin–Eidsbugarden), road 258 (Grotli-Ospeli bru) and road 886 (Bjørnstad–Jacobselv). All these roads have after the reform been converted to county roads. The organization of national, county and village roads (later municipal roads) was introduced in 1931. Starting in 1912 the roads had been divided into main roads (\\"hovedveier\\") and village roads (\\"bygdeveier\\"). In 1931 signposted numbers for national roads were introduced. The main roads were two digit ending with zero, for example road 50 Oslo–Kirkenes. The main roads in Østfold were numbered 1–9 based on an older local system. In 1965 a new system which included E-roads was introduced, and most of it is still used today (2019). ==Extreme records of Norwegian national roads== {  - ! Record !!

He is best known for organizing the defense of Virginia along the Potomac River soon after the state's secession from the Union. He commanded troops in the Battle of Blackburn's Ford and the First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas) in July 1861 before becoming despondent and committing suicide. ==Early life and education== Philip St. George Cocke was born at Bremo Bluff in Fluvanna County, Virginia in 1809 to John Hartwell Cocke(1780-1866) a local militia officer and who would become an officer in the United States Army during the War of 1812 and the former Anne Blaus Barraud.Eicher, p. 179. He had elder brothers John Hartwell Cocke Jr. (1804-1846) and James Hartwell Cocke (1797-1853) and younger brother Dr. Cary Charles Cocke (1814-1888), as well as several sisters. Cocke graduated from the University of Virginia in 1828 and then from the United States Military Academy in 1832 with the rank of brevet second lieutenant. He was soon assigned as second lieutenant to an artillery unit in Charleston, South Carolina during the nullification crisis of 1832-33. He became adjutant of the 2nd U.S. Artillery on July 13, 1833.Evans, pp. 585-86.Appletons Cyclopedia Vol. 1, pp. 672-673 On April 1, 1834, having completed the year of military service required of all USMA graduates at the time, Cocke resigned from the military and concentrated on operating various large plantations in Virginia and Mississippi as described below. He married Sallie Elizabeth Courtney Bowdoin on June 4, 1834. They would have many children as described below. ==Plantation owner== Belmead Plantation This Philip St. George Cocke owned large plantations in several Virginia counties, including Powhatan, Surry and Brunswick Counties, as well as cotton plantations in Mississippi. He used enslaved labor on all his plantations. In 1835, Philip St. George Cocke commissioned architect A.J. Davis to build a manor house named \\"Belmead\\" in Powhatan County. In 1840, Cocke owned 30 slaves in Surry County, 125 slaves in Brunswick County and 82 slaves in Powhatan County.1840 U.S. Federal Censuses for Surry, County, Virginia, Brunswick County, Virginia and Eastern District of Powhatan County, Virginia, all available on ancestry.com The numbers grew by 1850 to 118 slaves in Powhatan County, 45 in the southern district of Brunswick County,and 187 slaves in Lowndes County, Mississippi.1850 U.S. Federal Census, Slave Schedules for Lowndes County, Mississippi, Southern District of Brunswick County, Virginia and Powhatan County, Virginia, all available on ancestry.com In 1860, Cocke owned 124 slaves in Powhatan County, at least 33 in Yazoo County, Mississippi and possibly another 39 in Holmes County, Mississippi and 52 in Fluvanna County, Virginia.1860 U.S. Federal Census, Slave Schedules for Yazoo County, Mississippi and Powhatan County, Virginia. The large slaveowner in the Tchula district of Holmes County, Mississippi was \\"P.G. Cocke\\" and that in Fluvanna County was \\"John St.Cocke\\", all from the National Archives through ancestry.com Cocke published many articles in journals,Davis, Battle at Bull Run, p. 15. as well as a book on plantation management entitled Plantation and Farm Instruction in 1852.Appletons p. 673 From 1853 to 1856, Cocke was president of the Virginia State Agricultural Society. In 1859, concerned by John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry, he organized a militia infantry company known as the Powhatan Troop to help defend Powhatan County in case of a similar action or a slave revolt in the future.Kaufmann, Confederate Post. ==Civil War serviceOrganization of Virginia's defenses=== On April 21, 1861, Cocke was appointed as a brigadier general in the service of the Commonwealth of Virginia by Governor John Letcher. He was assigned command of all state forces along the Potomac River. Three days later, from his headquarters at Alexandria, Virginia, he reported to newly commissioned Maj. Gen. Robert E. Lee (assigned on April 22 to the command of all Virginia forces) that he had only 300 men to defend against what he thought was 10,000 Union troops across the river in Washington, D.C. Cocke made his headquarters at Culpeper, Virginia, on April 27, in order to better oversee the entire line of the Potomac as well as the mustering of volunteer troops in a large part of the state. Alexandria was evacuated by Lt. Col. A. S. Taylor on May 5, despite Cocke's orders \\"not to abandon it without fighting, even against overwhelming numbers.\\"Davis, Battle at Bull Run, p. 8. Under Lee's orders, Cocke organized a new defensive line at Manassas. Cocke may have been the first to formulate the Confederate defensive strategy of concentrating forces at Manassas and at Winchester in the Shenandoah Valley, and using the Manassas Gap Railroad to allow them to be mutually supporting.Davis, Battle at Bull Run, p. 31. This strategy would be a decisive factor in the Confederate victory in the First Battle of Bull Run. When Virginia's state forces were consolidated with the Provisional Army of the Confederate States, Cocke was given the rank of colonel in the new CSA forces. Because of this effective demotion, Cocke was superseded in command at Manassas on May 21 by Brig. Gen. Milledge L. Bonham and took command of the 19th Virginia Infantry Regiment. ===First Bull Run Campaign=== Cocke was eventually assigned to the army of P. G. T. Beauregard in command of the 5th Brigade, consisting of the 8th, 18th, 19th, 28th, and 49th Virginia Infantry regiments. His brigade was initially assigned to Centreville, but in the face of advancing Union forces, withdrew behind Bull Run on July 17.Davis, Battle at Bull Run, pp. 60, 109. He was officially thanked by Beauregard for his ability shown in strategic movements at the Battle of Blackburn's Ford. On July 20 Cocke was stationed at Ball's Ford on Bull Run. In the subsequent First Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861, Cocke was assigned to advance against Centreville, a plan abandoned when the Federals began their flanking movement against the Confederate left. While Col. Nathan George Evans, reinforced by Brig. Gen. Barnard Bee and Col. Francis S. Bartow, opposed the enemy, Cocke's forces defended against attack in the vicinity of the Stone Bridge, with his headquarters at the Lewis house. At 2 p.m., about an hour before the arrival of Elzey, he led his brigade into action on the left with \\"alacrity and effect.\\" He was promoted to brigadier general in the Confederate Army on October 21 and given command of the 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division of the Confederate Army of the Potomac.Eicher, p. 179; Davis, Cocke, p. 5, states 4th Brigade of the 2nd Division. ==Death and legacy== First Bull Run proved to be Cocke's last major battle. After eight months' service, during which he was promoted to brigadier general in the provisional Confederate army, he returned home, \\"shattered in body and mind.\\" Exhausted from the strain, and despondent over perceived slights from General Beauregard stemming from the Battle of Manassas,Kaufmann at Confederate Post cites the perceived slights. Davis, Cocke, p. 5, states \\"Apparently his health was not good at the outset, and these strains [of eight months in the field], along with a probable nervous or emotional susceptibility, left him worn down physically and mentally.\\" Cocke shot himself in the head on December 26, 1861, at his mansion, \\"Belmead\\", in Powhatan County, Virginia. He was initially buried on the plantation grounds, but was re-interred in 1904 at Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond, Virginia, where he rests with several other family members and Confederate officers.Davis, Cocke, p. 5; Eicher, p. 179. His plantation \\"Belmead\\" was put up for sale years after the war ended, but remains today, although further preservation needs have caused controversy. ==Family== Philip St. George Cocke was the son of John Hartwell Cocke (b. September 19, 1780 in Surry County, Virginia) and Anne Blaws Barraud (b. December 25, 1784, in Norfolk, Virginia.) He married Sallie Elizabeth Courtney Bowdoin (b. May 9, 1815) at Christ Church in Norfolk, Virginia, on June 4, 1834.

Osipyan was born in Moscow and graduated from Georgi Kurdyumov's class at Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys in 1955. His first scientific work puLater, he summarized his interest in science: In late 1950s and 1960s Osipyan worked on the extended effects of interaction of electrons with solid matter and discovered the effect of optical excitation of plastic properties in semiconductors. Also in 1960s Osipyan released his theory of dislocations in semiconductor crystal structure. In 1962 Osipyan became a cofounder and director of the Institute of Solid State Physics in Chernogolovka and remained at the head of the Institute until his death. Osipyan was elected full member of Russian Academy of Sciences at the age of 37, and vice-president of the Academy in 1988—2001. He chaired the Departments of Solid State physics at Moscow State University and Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. In 1980s Osipyan and his Institute conducted microgravity experiments on board of Mir station. In 2000s Osipyan engaged in the studies of fullerens. Throughout his lifetime Osipyan chaired numerous academic commissions, conferences and journal boards. From 1990-1993 he was president of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP). In 2005 he was awarded Lomonosov Gold Medal of the Russian Academy. In an interview the year after, Osipyan summarized his creed in science: \\"All my life I was mining for experimental data.

The \\"US-led coalition\\", identified by the press, refers to Operation Enduring Freedom, mostly special forces, air and naval forces, within a strictly US chain of command, exercising over a wide international geographic area, the US right to \\"self defence\\" accorded by the UN charter. The \\"NATO-led coalition\\", identified by the press, refers to the forces of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) led by NATO, with a specific United Nations Security Council mandate within Afghanistan, including most of the US forces in Afghanistan, NATO contingents and some non- NATO forces. (Note that in many articles within Wikipedia and elsewhere, this distinction is confused). United States and NATO International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) operations, alongside Afghan National Army forces, continued against the Taliban through 2008. On April 27, President Karzai escaped another attempt on his life: gunmen opened fire during a military parade celebrating the nation's victory and liberation from the eight-year occupation of the Soviet Union. The firefight lasted about a quarter of an hour, with 3 dead and over 10 wounded. As of September 11, 2008 has been the deadliest year for US forces since the start of the war with 113 deaths. Early September also marked the first time the war spilled over on to Pakistani territory. The year was also the deadliest for several European countries in Afghanistan. ==Events in May== U.S. Marines in Garmsir. By the end of December 2007, the situation on the ground in Helmand province reached a stalemate. A de facto border was established east of Garmsir along the banks of the Helmand River that divided British-held from Taliban-held territory. The British were outnumbered by the larger Taliban force which was receiving reinforcements from Pakistan. However the British had jets and heavy artillery on their side. Both forces were fighting in the coming months for mere yards of territory. In early April 2008, U.S. Marine reinforcements were sent to NATO forces in Helmand to help in the fight. After all of the troops arrived, Marines from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) started their operations with an attack on the Taliban-held town of Garmsir on April 29. The operation was in conjunction with British troops of the 16 Air Assault Brigade. They met almost no resistance, because the Taliban had already observed in the previous days the movements of the Marines before the operation and expected an assault so withdrew to take up positions a few kilometers outside the town. For the next few days there was no contact between the US Marines and the Taliban. But, on May 1, a Marine patrol tried to push further outside of the town and almost immediately were met with machine gun and rocket fire. The unit was pinned down against a dirt berm for several hours. Soon Marine and Taliban forces exchanged mortar fire. At the end of the day, no Marines were hurt or wounded. The Taliban casualty count was not known. Fighting in Afghanistan was not limited to the south. In May, Norwegian and German led ISAF forces, alongside Afghan National Army troops, conducted Operation Karez, a military operation in Badghis province in the north of Afghanistan.Telemark Battalion in new combat with Taliban , Aftenposten, 27 May 2008 It was the second time in half a year that Norwegian and German ISAF forces had participated in an offensive in Badghis province. Their objective was to eliminate the presence of Taliban insurgents who had regrouped in the area in the aftermath of Operation Harekate Yolo in late 2007. On May 23 the ISAF-led operations concluded on with no casualties among the ISAF soldiers nor the Afghan security forces. The given numbers of Taliban insurgent casualties in the operation vary, but were estimated between 13 and 15 killed in action. ==Events in June== A Royal Netherlands Air Force F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft conducts a mission over Afghanistan, May 28, 2008, after receiving fuel from a KC-135R Stratotanker aircraft.

On June 13, Taliban fighters demonstrated their ongoing strength, liberating all prisoners in an attack on Sarposa Prison, Kandahar. The well-planned operation freed 1200 prisoners, 400 of whom were Taliban prisoners-of-war, causing a major embarrassment for NATO in one of its operational centres in the country. On June 19, NATO and Afghan troops responded to the Kandahar jail break by launching an anti-Taliban operation in order to drive out the Taliban insurgents who had seized Arghandab, Afghanistan, an agricultural valley just north of Kandahar. BBC news reports that troops backed by helicopter gunships patrolled areas west of the Arghandab River and that people living in Arghandab District fled the area \\"fearing fighting between troops and militants\\". It was reported that a British helicopter killed a key Taliban leader called 'Sadiqullah' and up to ten members of his cell on 26 June 2008. They were said to be responsible for roadside bomb and suicide attacks against NATO and Afghan forces. The attack took place 10 kilometres north west of Kajaki in Helmand.\\\\- Apaches \\"strike a blow\\" at Taliban leadership - UK MoD 30 June 2008 ==Battle of Wanat== On July 13, 2008, a coordinated Taliban attack was launched on a remote NATO base at Wanat in the Kunar province. Approximately 200 militants began firing rockets and mortars from the nearby village, taking American ISAF forces by surprise. After causing serious damage to the integrity of the fortification, insurgents unsuccessfully attempted to storm the base. Although the militants briefly gained entry to a small forward observation post, the overall attack was repelled. In total 9 US and 4 Afghan National Army were killed, along with as many as 40 insurgents. 19 Americans and 4 Afghans were wounded, as well as 20-40 insurgents. The attack showed a step up in bold maneuvers on the part of the insurgency which usually fights on the defensive, following a bold prison assault in June. The US said 40 other militants were killed in Helmand province in separate operations. NATO forces announced that they have abandoned their outpost in the village. ==Increased French involvement in Afghanistan== France deployed combat aircraft in 2007 and 2008 (Rafale F2, Mirage 2000D and Super Etendards) and these aircraft saw increased action over Afghanistan.French Ministry of Defence, Rafales carry out their first mission , February 2008 In August, French troops had been involved in increased fighting in the area of Sirobi some east of Kabul. France recently took over control of the Kabul regional command from the Italians, which includes Sirobi. Ten French troops were killed and a further 21 wounded in an ambush - the heaviest loss of troops France has suffered since deploying to Afghanistan in 2002 and the biggest single loss in 25 years. Taliban losses were unknown, possibly between 13-40 killed and 30 wounded (French and Afghan claims). Later in the month, an airstrike which targeted a Taliban commander in Herat province killed 90 civilians. ==Operation Eagle's Summit== Kajaki Dam. Late August saw one of the largest operations by NATO forces in Helmand province, with the aim bringing electricity to the region. A convoy of 100 vehicles took five days to move massive sections of an electric turbine for the Kajaki Dam, covering . The operation involved 2,000 British troops, 1,000 other NATO troops from Australia, Canada, Denmark and the US and 1,000 Afghan soldiers. The Canadians covered the first leg and the British took over at a meeting point in the desert, using 50 BVS10 Viking armoured vehicles to escort the convoy. Hundreds of special forces troops went in first, sweeping the area and although difficult to verify, British commanders estimated more than 200 insurgents were killed- without any losses or injuries to NATO soldiers. British, Dutch, French and US aircraft, helicopters and unmanned drones provided aerial reconnaissance and fire support. ==Events in September== On September 3, The war spilled over on to Pakistani territory for the first time when heavily armed commandos, believed to be US Army Special Forces, landed by helicopter and attacked three houses in a village close to a known Taliban and al-Qaida stronghold. The attack killed between seven and twenty people. According to local residents, most of the dead were civilians. Pakistan responded furiously, condemning the attack.

On September 12, five civilians and seven militants were reported to have been killed during a US missile attack in north-west Pakistan, in what was reported by locals to be the 5th such attack in recent days. According to early reports, all of the dead were Taliban, killed by one missile. However, later reports found that missiles hit two buildings, the second in which three women and two children were killed. Military spokesman Maj Murad Khan confirmed the missile attack. An unnamed senior Pentagon official told the BBC that at some point within the past two months President George W. Bush issued a classified order to authorize US raids against militants in Pakistan. Pakistan however said it would not allow foreign forces onto its territory and that it would vigorously protect its sovereignty. According to the Pakistani Chief of Army Staff, Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, there was \\"no question of any agreement or understanding with the coalition forces whereby they are allowed to conduct operations on our side of the border\\".

However, according to an official statement by Pakistan, commanders said troops fired warning shots at the helicopters when they strayed over the Pakistan border.

The play was written as part of a campaign to create a \\"Shakespeare National Theatre\\" by 1916. ==Characters== *The Beefeater *The Man (Shakespeare) *The Lady (Queen Elizabeth) *The Dark Lady ==Plot== The play is set at \\"Fin de siècle 15-1600. Midsummer night on the terrace of the Palace at Whitehall, overlooking the Thames. The Palace clock chimes four quarters and strikes eleven.\\" The Man arrives at Whitehall where he meets a Beefeater guard. He persuades the Beefeater to allow him to stay to meet his girlfriend, a lady of the court, who will be arriving soon for a secret tryst. The Man notes down various interesting phrases used by the Beefeater (all quotations from Shakespeare plays). The Lady arrives, cloaked, but it is not the woman he is expecting. The Man immediately falls for her. While also noting down her own interesting expressions in his notebook, he tells her how beautiful and desirable she is. The Dark Lady arrives, and is shocked to see her lover attempting to seduce another woman. She tells The Lady not to trust The Man, as he is a mere actor. She then recognises that The Lady is Queen Elizabeth. The Man reveals that he is William Shakespeare. The Queen demands that he should apologise to her, but Shakespeare insists that his family is more respectable than hers, and that she only has her job by accident of birth. The Dark Lady is shocked by Shakespeare's frankness, but the queen forgives him. Shakespeare complains that his worst plays, As You Like It and Much Ado About Nothing, are the most popular, but is most proud of the ones with intelligent female characters, such All's Well that End's Well. If the queen would establish a National Theatre, he could create more of the kind of plays he wants to, rather than those that please the public. The queen says she'll look into it, but does not think the idea will please her Treasurer. She thinks it will probably be another 300 years before the idea will gain widespread support. She upbraids the Beefeater for allowing Shakespeare into the palace grounds, and tells him to make sure that Shakespeare leaves. ==Background== In 1902, a London Shakespeare League was founded to develop a Shakespeare National Theatre, aspiring to achieve this by the impending tricentenary in 1916 of Shakespeare's death. Shaw's play was written for the campaign.O Sullivan, Maurice J., Shakespeare's Other LIves, Mcfarland, 2005, p.92. Two years later in 1913 it purchased land for a theatre in Bloomsbury. The plan for a theatre by 1916 eventually failed because of the outbreak of World War I. The play refers to the \\"dark lady\\", who is the addressee of Shakespeare's sonnets 127 to 152, so-called because her hair and her eyes are said to be of a dark colour. In the sonnets, the poet is apparently involved in a sexual relationship with the Lady, but it is implied that she is unfaithful to him, perhaps with the \\"Fair Youth\\", the young man who is the addressee of most of the other sonnets. Many attempts have been made to identify the \\"Dark Lady\\" and \\"Fair Youth\\" with historical personalities. At the time Shaw's play was written, a favoured candidate for the Lady was Mary Fitton (this identification had been made by Shaw's friend Thomas Tyler but later dropped) and for the Youth was William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, who is known to have had an affair with Fitton.Sunil Kumar Sarker, Shakespeare's sonnets, Atlantic, 2006, p.101-2.Paul Edmondson, Stanley Wells, Shakespeare's Sonnets, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2004, p.25. In the play the Lady is referred to by name as \\"Mary\\", and there is a reference to Pembroke having met the Lady the previous night (\\"Last night he stood here on your errand, and in your shoes\\"). ==Preface== In the programme for the 1910 Haymarket production, Shaw wrote a satirical preface under the title \\"A Dressing Room Secret\\", in the form of a story set in a dressing room, in which a group of party-goers are dressing as Shakespeare characters for a \\"Shakespeare Ball\\". A bust of Shakespeare in the room talks to the characters he has created, telling them that he thinks Iago and Lady Macbeth are unconvincing characters, and that many of his creations came about by accident. ==Opera== The play was made into an opera by Philip Hagemann (2008).Stanford University Libraries (2019). \\"Opening Night! Opera & Oratorio Premieres - Philip Hagemann\\", accessed 14 April 2019. ==References *text from Project Gutenberg Dark lady Category:Plays by George Bernard Shaw Category:1910 plays Category:Cultural depictions of William Shakespeare ","title":"The Dark Lady of the Sonnets"},{"id":"19258662","text":"Michele Polverino (born 26 September 1984) is a retired naturalized Liechtenstein football midfielder, who plays for FC Balzers in Liechtenstein. == Club career  FC Schaan === Polverino played for the youth teams of FC Schaan until he was 18, when he moved to FC Vaduz === FC Vaduz === He joined FC Vaduz in the summer of 2002, making 11 league appearances in his first season in the Swiss Challenge League (then known as the Nationalliga B).

The race was a time-limited race due to rain, with the race falling some seventeen laps short of full race distance. The race was won by Graham Rahal on his IndyCar Series debut, having missed the first round at Homestead-Miami Speedway, due to a lack of spare parts for his #06 Newman/Haas/Lanigan Racing machine. At 19 years, 93 days old, Rahal became the youngest driver ever to win an Indy-style race, as well as the youngest winner in IndyCar Series history breaking Marco Andretti's record of 19 years, 167 days from the 2006 IndyCar Series season. He also became the fourth driver to win an IndyCar Series race in his first start, joining Buzz Calkins, Juan Pablo Montoya and Scott Dixon. == Qualifying == * All cars are split into two groups of thirteen, with the fastest six from each group going through to the \\"Top 12\\" session. In this session, the fastest six runners will progress to the \\"Firestone Fast Six\\".

As a part of the antifascist People's Liberation War of Yugoslavia, the People's Liberation Army of Yugoslavia (NOVJ), a predecessor of JNA, was formed on 22 December 1941 in the town of Rudo in Bosnia and Herzegovina with the establishment of the 1st Proletarian Brigade. After the liberation of the country from the Axis Powers occupation, that date was officially celebrated as the Day of the Army in the SFR Yugoslavia. In March 1945, the NOVJ was renamed the Yugoslav Army (Jugoslovenska Armija) and finally on its 10th anniversary on 22 December 1951, received the adjective People's (i.e. Narodna).p.202, Trifunovska In September 1968, the Territorial Defense (TO) was formed to support the JNA and on 21 February 1974 TO units were subordinated to their provinces or republics. Thus the JNA and TO became equal parts of the Yugoslav Armed Forces (Oružane Snage SFRJ). In accordance with the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution the Land Forces were divided into six armies allocated to the five republics: * First Army (Belgrade) – northern part of Central Serbia and Northern Serbia (Vojvodina) * Second Army (Niš) – southern part of Central Serbia and Southern Serbia (Kosovo and Metohia) * Third Army (Skopje) – Macedonia * Fifth Army (Zagreb) – Croatia * Seventh Army (Sarajevo) – Bosnia and Herzegovina * Ninth Army (Ljubljana) – Slovenia ** Included II Corps (Titograd) Plus the Coastal Naval District (Split) – formerly Fourth Army Tensions between the JNA and the TO became evident at the political situation in Yugoslavia deteriorated in the 1980s. The Federal government became concerned that Yugoslavia's constituent republics would use the TO to facilitate their secession from Yugoslavia and therefore disarmed the Kosovo TO of 130,000 members. In 1988 the JNA absorbed the entire TO with the Bosnian Serb General Blagoje Adžić becoming the JNA Chief of the Armed Forces General Staff. In 1988 the armies were reorganized into Military Districts or Regions which no longer corresponded to internal borders thereby making it harder for the republics to control their own forces. Apart from the Proletarian Guard, a mechanized corps, the Land Forces infantry divisions were reorganized into 17 Corps each consisting of four to eight brigades. == 1991 organization == Once considered the fourth strongest army in Europe with 140,000 active troops and million reserves, in 1991, at the outbreak of the Yugoslav Wars the ground forces were organized in four military regions. The First, Third and Fifth corresponded to the three field armies of the ground forces. The Air Force and Air Defence followed this pattern with the First, Third and Fifth Air Corps. Small number of units of the ground and air forces were outside of the military regions directly under General Staff command and control. The fourth military region was the Military Sea Region (or Naval Region), a joint Navy / Ground Forces formation, which was in general commanded by the chief of the Navy, with ground forces units for coastal defence in the rear of the naval artillery. The Military Sea Region did not have tactical aviation units assigned and air support was provided by the three air corpses.http://elektron.tmf.bg.ac.rs/user/bojan/JNA%20OOB.pdf * General Staff of the Yugoslav People's Army (Belgrade-Kneževac) **units and formations directly under the General Staff ***Special Forces Group of the General Staff (Pančevo) ***Guards Mechanised Brigade (Belgrade) ***63rd Airborne Brigade (Niš) (formally part of the Air Force) ***additional units and formations * First Military Region (Belgrade-Topčider), Northern Theatre (responsible for eastern Croatia (Slavonia), northern part of Central Serbia, Northern Serbia (Vojvodina) and Bosnia and Herzegovina). ** units and formations directly under the First MR ***Proletarian Guards Mechanized Division, (Belgrade- Banjica) (reduced strength in peacetime) ***4th Motorized Division (reduced strength in peacetime) (disbanded in 1990) ***22nd Infantry Division (reduced strength in peacetime) (disbanded in 1990) ***River Flotilla (Novi Sad) ***Belgrade City Defence Command (Belgrade) ***other units and formations **4th Corps (Sarajevo) **5th Corps (Banja Luka) **12th Corps (Novi Sad) **17th Corps (Tuzla) **24th Corps (Kragujevac) **37th Corps (Titovo Užice) * Third Military Region (Skopje), South-Eastern Theatre (southern part of Central Serbia, Southern Serbia (Kosovo and Metohia), inland Montenegro) and Republic of Macedonia **units and formations directly under the Third MR ***37th Motorized Division (Raška) (reduced strength in peacetime) (disbanded in 1990) ***other units and formations ** 2nd Corps (Titograd) **21st Corps (Niš) **41st Corps (Bitola) **42nd Corps (Kumanovo) **52nd Corps (Pristina) *Fifth Military Region (Zagreb), North-Western Theatre (Slovenia and northern Croatia) **units and formations directly under the Fifth MR ***6th Proletarian Infantry Division (Karlovac) (reduced strength in peacetime) (disbanded in 1990) ***Zagreb City Defense Command (Zagreb) (disbanded in 1990) ***other units and formations **10th Corps (Zagreb) (established in 1990 by combining 6th PI Division and the Zagreb CDC) **13th Corps (Rijeka) **14th Corps (Ljubljana) **31st Corps (Maribor) **32nd Corps (Varaždin) * Military Sea Region (Split-Žrnovnica) (Southeast Croatia (Dalmatia) and the Croatian and Montenegrin coastline) **Yugoslav Navy ***Fleet ***other naval units and formations ***Naval Bastions (fortifications on the Dalmatian islands) ***Coastal Artillery ***5th Military Sea Sector (Pula) (formed around the 139.

It eliminated its old divisional infantry organization and established the brigade as the largest operational unit. The army converted ten of twelve infantry divisions into twenty-nine tank, mechanized, and mountain infantry brigades with integral artillery, air defense, and anti-tank regiments. One airborne brigade was organized before 1990. The shift to brigade-level organization provided greater operational flexibility, maneuverability, and tactical initiative, and it reduced the possibility that large army units would be destroyed in setpiece engagements with an aggressor. The change created many senior field command positions that would develop relatively young and talented officers. The brigade structure also was more appropriate at a time of declining manpower. ==Corps== There were 17 Corps (both named and numbered), they consist of the following: * Serbian (x 5) – 12th, 21st, 24th, 37th, and 52nd * Croatian (x 4) – 9th, 10th, 13th, and 32nd * Bosnia-Herzegovinian (x 3) – 4th, 5th, and 17th * Macedonian (x 2) – 41st and 42nd * Slovene (x 2) – 14th and 31st * Montenegrin (x 1) – 2nd Each Corps contained the following: * Corps Headquarters Troops, * Corps combat Support – three artillery regiments (one mixed artillery, one mixed anti-tank, one light anti-aircraft), and six battalions (engineers, signals, military police, NBC (Nuclear Biological Chemical), medical, and replacement). * Corps combat forces consisted of four armoured/mechanized/motorized brigades, plus infantry, light infantry, and mountain brigades. During the course of the ten-year-long Yugoslav wars, corps were modified by being reinforced with extra units from out of theatre; battalions then became regiments and regiments became brigades. However many units were also disbanded when their non-Serbian/Montenegrin personnel deserted. ==Personnel== In the 1980s the ground forces had about 140,000 active-duty soldiers (including 90,000 conscripts) and could mobilize over a million trained reservists in wartime. Most soldiers were of Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Macedonian or Montenegrin origin. Reserve forces were organized along republics' lines into Partisan Forces and Territorial Defence Forces and in wartime they were to be subordinate to JNA Supreme Command as an integral part of the defence system. The Territorial Defence Forces (reserve force) was made up of former conscripts and they were occasionally called up for war exercises. The ground forces were subdivided into infantry, armour, field artillery, and air defence artillery, as well as signal, engineering and chemical defence corps. ==OperationsThe Ten-Day War=== During the Ten Day War the JNA performed abysmally as many of the Yugoslav soldiers did not realise they were taking part in a real military operation, rather an exercise, until they came under attack. The officer corps was dominated by Serbs and Montenegrins and in many cases ideologically committed to Yugoslav unity. The rank and file troops however were conscripts, many who had no strong motivation in fighting against the Slovenes. Of the soldiers of the 5th Military District, which was in action in Slovenia, in 1990 30% were Albanians, 20% Croats, 15 to 20% Serbs and Montenegrins, 10% Bosniaks, and 8% Slovenes.Meier, Viktor. Yugoslavia – A History of its Demise. Routledge, London, 1999 The JNA eventually lost nearly all of its Slovenian and Croat personnel, becoming an almost entirely Serbian and Montenegrin force. Its poor performance in Slovenia and later in Croatia discredited its leadership – Kadijević resigned as defence minister in January 1992, and Adžić was forced into medical retirement shortly afterwards. Due to the short duration (10 Days) and relatively low intensity of the war, casualties were low. According to Slovenian estimates, the JNA suffered 44 fatalities and 146 wounded, while 4,692 JNA soldiers and 252 federal police officers were captured by the Slovenian side. According to post-war assessments made by the JNA, its material losses amounted to 31 tanks, 22 armoured personnel carriers, 6 helicopters, 6,787 infantry weapons, 87 artillery pieces and 124 air defence weapons damaged, destroyed or confiscated. Property damage was fairly light, due to the scattered and short-term nature of the fighting. ==Infantry== The ground forces led in personnel. It had about 540,000 active-duty soldiers (including 120,000 conscripts) and could mobilize over a million trained reservists in wartime. Reserve forces were organized along republics' lines into Territorial Defence Forces and in wartime they were to be subordinate to JNA Supreme Command as an integral part of defence system. Territorial Defence (reserve force) was made up of former conscripts and they were occasionally called up for war exercises. The ground forces were infantry, armour, artillery, and air defence, as well as signal, engineering and chemical defence corps. ===Equipment=== *Assault Rifles **Zastava M70 *Machineguns **Zastava M53 **Zastava M84 **Zastava M72 **Zastava M77 *Submachineguns **Skorpion vz. 61 *Sniper Rifles **Zastava M76 **Barrett M107 ** *Pistols **CZ-99 *Launchers **M80 Rocket Launcher **M79 Osa **M90 Stršljen Gallery Image:Zastava M84.jpgHeavy machine gun, Zastava M84 7.62 mm. ==Tank and armoured brigades== Yugoslav tank brigades comprised two or three battalions each with 31 tanks in three ten tank companies. They operated 1114 Soviet T-54s and T-55s, 73 Soviet T-72s, 443 Yugoslav M-84s, and some United States-made M-47 tanks. The army's tanks were in many respects its most obsolete forces. The T-54/-55 was a frontline model during the 1960s. Domestic production of the M-84 (an improved version of the Soviet T-72 built under license in Yugoslavia) was providing the army with a late 1970s and 1980s model. The army also had a reserve of old T-34/85 and Sherman tanks from World War II. The Yugoslav army had 995 M-80A IFVs and 551 M-60P armored personnel carriers produced domestically. The infantry also operated more than 200 Soviet-made BTR-152, BTR-40, and BTR-50 armored personnel carriers (APCs), which had been purchased in the 1960s and 1970s. It had 100 M-3A1 half-tracked personnel carriers produced by the United States and a small number of new Romanian TAB-72 (a variant of the BTR-60) armored personnel carriers. Armored reconnaissance vehicles included a few older Soviet BTR-40s, newer BRDM-2 and BTR-60 models, and domestic BOV and M-8 vehicles. ===Equipment=== *Light Tanks **PT-76 – 63 *Medium Tanks **M-4 Sherman – 630 (including M-32, M32B1 and M-74 tank recovery vehicles, stored in reserve) **T-34/85 – 889 **M-47 Patton – 319 **T-55 – 1614 T-55 tank displayed in Valpovo, Croatia *Main Battle Tanks **T-72 – 73 **M-84 – 443 *Tank Destroyers **SU-100 – 40 **M18 Hellcat – ~260 **M36 Jackson – ~300 *APC's **MT-LB – 40 **OT M-60 – 551 **BTR-50 – ~200 **BTR-60 – 80 **TAB-72 – 40 *IFV's **BVP M-80 – 995 *Armored Reconnaissance Vehicles **BRDM-2 – 80 **BOV APC – 317 (successor state) == Artillery == Yugoslav artillery regiments were well equipped with Soviet, U.S. and domestic systems. Soviet artillery in these units consisted of approximately 1,000 towed 122 mm howitzers, 130 mm guns, 152 mm gun/howitzers, and 155 mm howitzers. There were about 700 older United States 105 mm and 155 mm towed guns and domestically produced models such as the M-65 in the artillery regiments. Towed pieces were very important for operations in the country's mountainous terrain. Artillery units operated Soviet 100 mm and 122 mm and Yugoslav-produced 105 mm M-7 self-propelled guns. Those units had over 8,000 82 mm and 120 mm mortars, including a self-propelled 82 mm mortar mounted on an M-60PB variant of the standard armored personnel carrier. Yugoslav artillery units operated several battlefield missile systems including 160 128 mm YMRL-32 and M-63 multiple-rocket launchers. The arsenal included four launchers for Soviet FROG-7 surface-to-surface missiles. First fielded in 1967, the unguided FROG-7 had a range of 100 kilometers. ===Equipment=== *Mountain artillery ** M48 (a.k.a. the Tito Gun) *Towed Artillery **M56 – ?

Antitank guns included 75 mm, 90 mm, and 100 mm models. They were Soviet produced with the exception of the 90 mm M-63B2, which was manufactured domestically. The recoilless rifles were manufactured domestically and included 57 mm, 82 mm, and 105 mm models. Two self-propelled 82 mm recoilless rifles could be mounted on an M-60PB armored personnel carrier. Anti-tank guided missiles were the Soviet AT-1 (NATO: Snapper) and AT-3 (NATO: Sagger). They were used in both anti-tank and infantry units, but because of their early vintage, effectiveness against advanced armor was uncertain. The four wheeled BOV-1 armored reconnaissance vehicle could be equipped with six AT-3 launchers to serve as a highly mobile anti-tank platform. ==Air defense== Larger Yugoslav army units had considerable tactical air defense assets, designed to defend major troop concentrations against enemy air strikes. The ground forces had four surface-to-air missile regiments and eleven antiaircraft artillery regiments. The former operated large numbers of Soviet SA-6, SA-7, SA-9, SA-13, SA-14, SA-16 missiles. Short-range systems also were employed in infantry units. Yugoslav antiaircraft artillery regiments operated over 5,000 guns. Self-propelled gun systems included the Soviet-made 57 mm dual ZSU-57-2 gun systems and the domestically produced triple 20 mm BOV-3s and dual 30 mm BOV-30s. Large numbers of towed antiaircraft guns of many calibers were in the inventory. Of both domestic and foreign origin, they included pieces purchased from the United States, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and Sweden. ===Equipment=== *Anti aircraft systems **57 mm AZP S-60 – ? **M-55 – ? **Bofors 40mm – 142 *Self-propelled Anti aircraft systems **BOV-3/30 – ~100 **M53/59 Praga – 789Samohodni PA top Praga M-53/59 **ZSU-57-2 – 125 *MANPAD's **Strela-2 – 4700 **9K34 Strela-3 **9K38 Igla *SAM's **9K31 Strela-1 – 120 **9K35 Strela-10 – 18 **S-75 Dvina – 60 (used by Air Force and Air Defense) **S-125 Neva – 60 (used by Air Force and Air Defense) **2K12 Kub – 80~90 (used by Air Force and Air Defense) ==Coastal defense== The coastal artillery batteries had both surface-to- surface missiles and guns. They operated the Soviet-designed SS-C-3 and a truck-mounted, Yugoslav-produced Brom antiship missile which was essentially a Yugoslav variant of the Soviet SS-N-2. Coastal guns included over 400 85 mm, 88 mm, 122 mm, 130 mm, and 152 mm artillery pieces obtained from the Soviet Union, the United States, captured and refurbished WW2 German and Italian pieces, and Yugoslav manufacturers. ==Rank and uniformsRank=== According to the Army Law of 1 October 1982 the Land Forces had five categories of ranks; general officers, senior officers, junior officers, Non-commissioned Officers, and soldiers. Enlisted The soldier and NCO ranks were private first class, corporal, junior sergeant, sergeant, sergeant first class, senior sergeant, senior sergeant first class, warrant officer, and warrant officer first class. Privates first class, corporals, and junior sergeants wore one, two, and three red chevrons, respectively, on a background of olive-green, blue-gray, or black—corresponding, respectively, to the ground forces, air force, or navy. In the land forces and air forces, sergeants, sergeants first class, senior sergeants, and senior sergeants first class wore single thin yellow-gold chevrons with one, two, three, and four yellow-gold stars, respectively. Warrant officers and warrant officers first class wore two yellow-gold chevrons with one and two gold stars respectively. { style=\\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font- size:100%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;width:100%\\" - - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" - - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" ! colspan=6NCOsYugoslav People's Army Rankscolspan=3Soldiers - align=\\"center\\" rowspan=1 align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" 40px align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" - align=\\"center\\" Ranks in Serbo-Croatian Zastavnik I klase Заставник I класе Zastavnik Заставник  Stariji Vodnik I klase Старији Водник I класе Stariji Vodnik Старији Водник Vodnik I klase Водник I класеVodnik ВодникMlađi vodnik Млађи водник Desetar ДесетарRazvodnik Разводник - align=\\"center\\" rowspan=2 Ranks Warrant Officer, 1st classWarrant OfficerSenior Sergeant 1st classSenior SergeantSergeant, 1st classSergeantJunior SergeantCorporalPrivate } Officers Insignia for commissioned officers were worn on shoulder boards in olive-green for the land forces. Shoulder boards were piped with single and double yellow- gold braid, respectively, for junior and senior officers. General officers wore shoulder boards piped with twisted gold cord. Junior officer ranks were sub-lieutenant, lieutenant, captain, and captain first class and their shoulder boards had one, two, three, and four small yellow gold stars, respectively. Senior officer ranks were major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel and their shoulder boards bore one, two, or three large yellow-gold stars respectively. General officer ranks were major general, lieutenant colonel general, colonel general, and general of the army. General was the rank created for federal secretary of people's defense in 1955 and it was abolished in 1974. Army general officers wore a crossed sword and cannon and one, two, three, four and five gold stars. Tito was the only person to hold the rank of Marshal, and the position was abolished shortly after his death. The shoulder board insignia featured the Emblem of Yugoslavia. { style=\\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:100%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;width:100%\\" - - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" - - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" ! colspan=5GeneralsОзнаке чинова – Генерали и Адмиралиcolspan=7OfficersОфицири - align=\\"center\\" rowspan=1 align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"center\\" - align=\\"center\\" Ranks in Serbo-Croatian General Генерал  General Armije Генерал Армије General Pukovnik Генерал ПуковникGeneral-Potpukovnik Генерал-ПотпуковникGeneral-Major Генерал-Мајор Pukovnik ПуковникPotpukovnik ПотпуковникMajor МајорKapetan I klase Капетан I класеKapetan КапетанPoručnik ПоручникPotporučnik Потпоручник - align=\\"center\\" rowspan=2 Ranks GeneralGeneral of the ArmyColonel GeneralLieutenant Colonel GeneralMajor GeneralColonelLieutenant ColonelMajorCaptain, 1st classCaptainLieutenantSub-lieutenant } ===Uniforms=== Enlisted and NCO's Soldiers and NCOs were issued field uniforms and service uniforms, while NCOs were authorised a dress uniform. Military school cadets wore soldier's uniforms. Soldiers' winter and summer uniforms were made of light or heavy wool and cotton in olive-green. All soldiers wore neckties of the same colors except in summer, when the uniform shirt was worn with an open collar. There were several variations on the basic soldier's uniform and women's uniforms were of the same style as those for men, with a skirt being substituted for trousers. Paratroops wore an olive-green beret instead of the standard garrison or service cap. Mountain troops wore distinctive stiff field caps with semi-rigid visors and ear flaps. They wore loose winter shirts, under which additional layers could be worn. The shirt itself had a lining and a collar that could be turned up to cover the neck and chin. The trousers worn by mountain troops extended just below the knee, with a strap and buckle closure. Leather leggings, heavy wool socks, and foul-weather capes also were worn by the mountain troops. Several different patterns of camouflage uniforms were worn by select units. Officers Officers had to buy their field, service, dress, and full dress uniforms. They wore insignia on the lapels of the field uniform shirts. The service uniform differed only in a few details from the basic dress uniform. The shirt buttons of the dress uniform were yellow-gold instead of the service color. The trousers, jackets, and overcoats were piped red along the seams.

Its cause was the peasants' dissatisfaction with the \\"lords' government\\" of the Age of Liberty. This dissatisfaction was strongest in Dalarna, partly because the Hats had introduced restrictions in the Dalecarlians' free exchange of goods with neighboring Norway, but mainly because of the unlucky Russo-Swedish War (1741–43) to which the peasants had to provide soldiers. It was the last major uprising in Sweden to have started in rural areas. ==Background== At the time of the revolt, there was widespread discontent with the parliamentary system among the peasantry, who considered their representatives in the Riksdag of the Estates powerless to the three other estates, and that the monarchs of the absolute monarchy had listened better to their complaints. An epidemic and famine after the failed harvest of 1742, caused the ban from trade with the Norwegian border, increased the dissatisfaction, as did the Battle of Villmanstrand with its great losses for the Dalarna regiment. The dissatisfaction was directed toward the crisis in the succession to the throne after the childless Frederick I of Sweden. The idea that an election of Peter of Holstein-Gottorp, grandson of Hedvig Sophia of Sweden and nephew of Empress Elizabeth of Russia, would result in an end of the hated war and a chance for a change in the constitution, spread in Dalarna, were the peasantry was ready to enforce it by a revolt. When Peter was elected heir to the Russian throne, crown prince Frederick of Denmark became the preferred candidate of the peasantry. During the summer of 1742, riots and opposition toward the draft of soldiers occurred in several provinces in Sweden, as well as discontent among their soldiers in the regiment in the capital. This resulted in a stop of the drafts and the peasantry arming themselves toward the authorities instead. On 8 March 1743, the representatives of the peasantry stated their demands in the Riksdag and demanded a stop of the drafts, the punishment of the generals responsible for the Battle of Villmanstrand and the election of crown prince Frederick of Denmark as heir to the throne. Their demands were refused. ==Rebellion== The rebellion in Hälsingland were subdued, but open rebellion broke out in Dalarna 30 May, and on 11 June, a rebel army marched from Dalarna toward the capital. They brought with them the county governor and a couple of officials as prisoners, but kept a good discipline on their march. They were supported by the peasantry on their way and joined by hundreds of supporters as well as supplies. Some of the cities, such as Uppsala, gave support, while others, such as Sala, did not and forced them to pay for their supply. On 19 June, an agreement was made at the peace conference with the Russian empress that Adolf Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp were to be elected heir to the Swedish throne in exchange for the return of the Swedish province of Finland. On 20 June, the rebel army peacefully entered the capital of Stockholm, after the king had ordered that no shots be fired by the garrison. The government unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the rebels to accept the election of the new heir. On 22 June, the rebels were surrounded by several regiments at the Gustav Adolfs torg, Stockholm, and given the ultimatum to surrender before five o'clock or be regarded as traitors. Västgöta kavalleriregemente attacked the rebels, who answered by firing a canon. The one firing the canon was shot by an officer, after which the rebels attacked. The regiments of Uppland and Västmanland refused to attack, but Älvsborg Regiment fired, killing 150 men and captured 3000. ==Aftermath== Six of the leaders of the rebellion were condemned to death and executed. Of the rest of the thousand rebels imprisoned in Stockholm, some were given fines and physical punishment, but the majority were pardoned after having sworn an oath of loyalty after their parishes had sent in an appeal for them: many, however, died of sickness in the prisons due to the poor hygienic conditions. Several other provinces had made preparations to march to the capital, but the plans were abandoned. Then news came of the Dalecarlians defeat in Stockholm. The government successfully asked for troops from the Russian empress to protect Sweden from an attack from Denmark due to the Danish dissatisfaction with the outcome in the election of an heir to the Swedish throne. The Russian protective troops consisted of 30 galleys, anchoring by the Swedish shores for a couple of months that year, before returning to Russia. == See also == * Dalecarlian Rebellions ==References== * Beckman, Bjarne, Dalupproret 1743 och andra samtida rörelser inom allmogen och bondeståndet (Göteborg 1930).

It was originally to be released as Kiss and Run. The film centres on the rumoured marital troubles of a successful playwright. As various people who came into contact with the couple reminisce about the couple's past, the story of the relationship and the budding affair that is potentially destroying it is told through a series of flashbacks. Upon release, the film was met with lukewarm reviews, Bosley Crowther of The New York Times calling it \\"a virtual collection of cliches\\". ==Plot== On a train, playwright Bill Blakeley (Victor Mature) fends off the romantic flirtations of Janet Boothe (Monica Lewis), an actress from his play. But, when wife Carolyn (Jean Simmons) decides not to join him, Bill makes a dinner date with Janet, who plants a story with a gossip columnist about the Blakeleys possibly heading for a divorce. Friends and acquaintances begin recalling how the couple met. Carolyn Parker was a fashion model who bought a Toledo, Ohio, newspaper each day. Bill pretended to be from Toledo as well to get to know her, only to learn that Carolyn's actually from England and has been buying the papers for a neighbor. After their marriage, Bill's struggles to find work, combined with his gambling, force Carolyn to support them. He finally takes a job as a waiter and slips a copy of a manuscript to a customer, a producer who makes Bill's play a success. One night, Carolyn must miss the opening of a play because she is having a baby. The child dies, and she can have no more. Bill is as supportive in her hour of need as she had been in his. Concerned that he might be vulnerable to an ambitious actress, however, Carolyn takes the next train to New York. She runs into Bill at the station and into his arms. ==Cast== * Victor Mature as Bill Blakeley * Jean Simmons as Carolyn Parker * Monica Lewis as Janet Boothe * Jane Darwell as Ma Stanton * Linda Douglas as Dolly Murray * Dabbs Greer as Happy Murray * Wally Vernon as Joe, Taxi Driver * Nicholas Joy as Producer George W.

However he assigned to this instead and production on Split Second was pushed back. Filming started 9 July 1952 and papers reported it being \\"rushed before the cameras\\". The original title was Break up. This was changed to Kiss and Run in April 1953 before becoming Affair with a Stranger. The film was the fourth Jean Simmons made for Howard Hughes and RKO. Simmons and her husband Stewart Granger sued Hughes to get out of the contract. It settled out of court. Part of the final arrangement was she would do this film for no extra money. Also, Simmons agreed to make three more movies under the auspices of RKO, but not actually at that studio – she would be loaned out. She would make an additional picture for 20th Century Fox while RKO got the services of Victor Mature for one film. (Simmons and Mature would team two other times, on Fox's enormously popular The Robe and in The Egyptian) Olive Carey, widow of Harry Carey, had a small role. Steve Rowland, son of director Roy Rowland, made his debut in the film. ==Reception== The Los Angeles Times called the story \\"quite ordinary\\" and said the film \\"can't seem to make up its mind if it's comedy or drama.\\" ==References* * * Review of film at The New York Times * Affair with a Stranger at Victormature.net Category:1953 films Category:1953 comedy-drama films Category:American films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English- language films Category:Films scored by Roy Webb Category:Films about writers Category:Films directed by Roy Rowland Category:RKO Pictures films Category:1953 comedy films Category:1953 drama films ","title":"Affair with a Stranger"},{"id":"19258792","text":"John Gahagan (born 24 August 1958) is a Scottish former footballer, who played as a left winger.

The Battalion suffered casualties of 226 men and 22 Officers. Mogg was awarded DSO for his actions at Lingevres, presented in the field by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery,https://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/205416890 and became a distinguished commander of the 9th Battalion Durham Light Infantry from the Invasion of Normandy to the defeat of Germany. 9DLI saw further action at the Falaise pocket, the crossing of the Albert Canal and at Gheel, Belgium. On 23 September, 151st Brigade was ordered to move north and east of Eindhoven with 231st Brigade to guard the right flank of Operation Market Garden. In November 1944 151st Brigade was disbanded and some units return to Britain. However 9DLI was reinforced and transferred to 7th Armoured Division, 131st Infantry Brigade, as a motorised battalion fighting at the Roer Triangle in January 1945 and the town of Ibbenbüren in March. 9DLI ended the war near Hamburg. ==Post War== In 1945 he attended the Staff College as a student. After two years in Germany as GSO1, 7th Armoured Division, he returned to the Staff College as a member of the Directing Staff. From 1950-52 he was Commanding Officer, 10th Battalion, The Parachute Regiment. In 1952 he became Chief Instructor at the School of Infantry at Warminster and from 1954 to 1956 was GSO1 at the Imperial Defence College. From 1958 he Commanded, 28th Commonwealth Infantry Brigade Group in the final stages of the Malayan Emergency, where he received the Meritorious Medal from the Sultan of Perak. On return he was appointed Director of Combat Development at the War Office and promoted to Major General. \\"His next appointment, as Commandant of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, (1963-66), was an inspired choice. He loved the job, and it suited him down to the ground. He fired up the cadets with his own enthusiasm for the army, for soldiering in all its aspects, and for sport of many kinds, from cricket to horses. His appointment to the key command of First (British) Corps in Germany in 1966., pointed to his future advancement to the top of the army's tree,\\" He was appointed General Officer Commanding Southern Command in 1968, General Officer Commanding, Army Strategic Command later that year and, finally, Adjutant-General to the Forces in 1970. He delivered the Kermit Roosevelt Lecture in April 1969 at Fort Leavenworth; an exchange programme with the US Army supported by the Kermit Roosevelt Fund. His lecture was suitably entitled; \\"Communication as a military art.\\" He travelled extensively as Adjutant General visiting British units overseas and reassuring Britain’s allies in the Middle East and elsewhere at the time of Britain's withdrawal from ‘East of Suez’; earning the sobriquet ‘Marco Polo” amongst his colleagues at the MOD. His final appointment was with NATO at SHAPE, Mons as Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe, DSACEUR between 1973 and 1976. He was ADC General to the Queen from 1971 to 1974, Colonel Commandant of the Royal Green Jackets from 1965 to 1973, Commandant of the Army Air Corps from 1963 to 1974. and Honorary Colonel of the 10th Battalion, Parachute Regiment, TA, (1973-78) He was interested in many sports including cricket and equestrianism and promoted these inside the army. Mogg was a president of a number of sports, army and veteran's associationsThe Telegraph obituaries : General Sir John Mogg and served various charities mostly connected with the armed services or adventure training. He was respectively Chairman of Operation Drake Fellowship (now part of Fairbridge (charity) and Operation Raleigh and President of the Army Cricket Association, Army Free Fall Parachute Association, the Army Saddle Club, the British Horse Society, the Ex-Services Mental Welfare Society, the Normandy Veterans' Association and Chairman of the Army Benevolent Fund. His interest in education was shown in his Chairmanship of the governors of the Royal Soldiers' Daughters School and Icknield School, Watlington. He was also a long serving governor of Bradfield College and his old school Malvern. In Detmold, Germany, a primary school for children whose parents are serving in the British Army was named after Sir John Mogg. The school was opened on 10 February 1971.About Sir John Mogg School He was made Vice Lord Lieutenant of Oxfordshire in 1979. ==Obituary== The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph obituaries summed up his personality and personal style: \\"John Mogg's large frame was combined with an exceptionally genial, warm and sympathetic character, which appealed not only to soldiers of all ranks, but to people in every walk of life, whatever their nationality. In his time, he was probably the British army's most popular general, and finished his career in one of Nato's most influential posts, as deputy supreme allied commander (1973–76) at headquarters at Mons, in Belgium. Here, his sound common-sense and even temperament were valuable in balancing the direct approach, and sometimes abrasive personality, of the supreme commander, the US General Alexander Haig.\\" \\"John Mogg was a large man in every sense. Tall and heavily built, he always paid close attention to what someone was saying, ready with help and often a joke. His special gift was to appear to have the leisure to deal with any problem or request, although few people can have led such a busy life.\\" ==Family == Lady Mogg (née Cecilia Molesworth's) second cousin was Margaret Molesworth, grandmother of Sophie, Countess of Wessex, above right John Mogg was born near Comox, Vancouver Island, BC., the son of Captain Herbert Barrow Mogg, MC. (d. 1978), late Wiltshire Regiment & 4th Battalion Canadian Engineers, and Alice Mary Mogg, daughter of Lt Col John Fane Ballard, late DCLI, of Kingston Blount, Oxon.

It is found from Europe, to southern Siberia, central Asia to the Pacific Ocean. In North Africa it is known from Morocco and Algeria. ==Description== The wingspan is 28–40 mm. Colouring and pattern are extremely variable and hardly a specimen has an identical colouring and pattern. The colour varies from grey-brown to dark grey. The costa is pale and the pattern often obscure. Pale orbicular and reniform. The males have relatively short combed antennae, the female antennae are thread-like. Note that E. nigrofusca may not be a good species. The Euxoa tritici complex consists of five sibling species in Europe: White-linedart Euxoa tritici (Linnaeus, 1761), Euxoa nigrofusca (Esper, 1788), Euxoa eruta (Hübner, 1817), Euxoa diaphora Boursin, 1928 and Euxoa segnilis (Duponchel, 1836). Furthermore, although Fibiger (1997) treated Euxoa montivaga differently it belongs to the E. tritici complex. Differences among the species are subtle, the most important diagnostic characteristics being genitalic. In studies of three of these species, E. tritici, E. nigrofusca and E. eruta, no support was found for the presence of several morphologically distinguishable species with quantitative morphometric analyses.Marko Mutanen, 2005 Delimitation difficulties in species splits: a morphometric case study on the Euxoa tritici complex (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) Systematic Entomology (2005), 30, 632–643 pdf ==Life-cycle== Overwinters as an egg laid on the foodplant, the larvae feed at night partly subterraneous on the roots of Poaceae and a wide range of herbaceous plants such as corn spurrey (Spergula arvensis). This moth flies from June to October depending on the location and there is one generation per year. It can be found on heaths, sand dunes, cliffs and open heaty woodland. ==References *Funet Taxonomy *Fauna Europaea *Vlindernet *Lepidoptera of Belgium *White-line Dart at UKmoths * Noctuinae of Israel Category:Euxoa Category:Moths described in 1761 Category:Moths of Africa Category:Moths of Asia Category:Moths of Europe Category:Moths of the Middle East Category:Moths of Turkey Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Euxoa nigrofusca"},{"id":"19258840","text":"Aamar Pratigya ( \\"My Promise\\") (2008) is a Bengali film directed by Swapan Saha. ==Cast== * Biswanath Basu * Priyanshu Chatterjee * Paoli Dam * Tathoi Deb * Rajatava Dutta * Dulal Lahiri * Subhasish Mukhopadhyay * Laboni Sarkar ==References * gomolo.in Category:2008 films Category:Indian films Category:Bengali-language films Category:2000s Bengali- language films Category:Films directed by Swapan Saha ","title":"Aamar Pratigya"},{"id":"19258842","text":"The Battle of Saintfield was a short but bloody clash in County Down, in Northern Ireland. The battle was the first major conflict of the Irish Rebellion of 1798 in Down. The battle took place on Saturday, 9 June 1798. ==Background== A rebel force, over a thousand strong, converged on a large house owned by the McKee family. The McKees were a family of loyalists, who were unpopular in the region: one year before, they had provided information to the authorities leading to the arrest of a radical Presbyterian minister by the name of Thomas Ledlie Birch and some members of his congregation. The McKees knew that they were unpopular and were thus armed to the teeth. As the house was surrounded, shots were fired from the fortified house, hitting some of the attackers. Gunfire held the insurgents back for a short while, until one of them, a fiddler by the name of Orr, managed to sneak around the back of the house with a ladder, and thence set the roof alight. The house was destroyed, and all eight members of the family inside killed. News of this quickly reached the British forces in the area, and a 300 strong force under Colonel Granville Staplyton, consisting of Newtownards Yeomanry cavalry and 270 York Fencibles, as well as two light cannon, marched to the region. ==The battle== The rebels, however, had anticipated the move and were waiting in ambush. Stapylton saw the road ahead twisting into woods, and ordered a pair of scouts to check for anything suspicious. The men do not seem to have been particularly vigilant, as when they returned they declared that the road ahead was safe. The redcoats marched into the wooded area, a dense hedge snaking along the road on one side: on the opposite side, the ground steadily rose, with the areas higher up the slope dominated by demesne woods. This provided cover for the Irish. The Irish rebels were mostly armed with pikes and the terrain allowed them to quickly swarm the soldiers on the road below. In the fierce hand-to-hand combat that followed the British forces were overwhelmed. One of the fencibles, a veteran of wars in Europe who managed to survive the attack later stated that he had never before witnessed such fierce fighting: every man had to fight his way in the best manner he could in opposition to the charged pike and other weapons, to which he had not been accustomed. Over fifty men were piked to death before Staplyton managed to order the soldiers; he then brought his cannon into play against the mass of rebels before him, inflicting enough casualties with canister and grapeshot to blunt their attack. In the meantime, Staplytons force used the situation to march to safety. ==Aftermath== The battle of Saintfield was largely regarded as a victory of the United Irish rebels. Long after, in the 1950s, two skeletons and a sword and bayonet of the York fencibles were found in the area. The rebellion in Down would prove short lived, however- only a few days later the rebel army was slaughtered at the Battle of Ballynahinch. Many of the dead from both sides of the battle were placed in a mass grave within the grounds of the nearby Presbyterian church. Although there is a plaque signifying the location of these graves, the area seems largely neglected with what appears to be temporary vehicle access over the belligerents final resting place. In May 2010 a memorial park was finished and opened. The area has been cleared and landscaped, with several new plaques and information boards being erected. The graves have been refurbished and the headstones relaid.

Its suffix quercus refers to the fact that its cocoon generally resembles an acorn. ==Habitat== The Oak Eggar's habitat is wide-ranging, including scrub, heath, moor, downland, hedges and sea cliffs, reflecting the larva's very varied range of food plants. ==LifecycleAdult=== Mating The moth's wingspan is about 45mm (male) to 75mm (female), the female being larger and paler than the male. It is Britain's largest day-flying moth. The Oak Eggar is on the wing for about two months between May and September, depending on the latitude. In more northerly latitudes, development can span two years, with larvae over-wintering the first year, and the pupae in the second year. In Northern areas it is known as the Northern Eggar; this was formerly thought to be a separate species, but is generally assumed to be a subspecies Lassiocampa quercus callunae, there is no clear geographical separation of the two types, but the Northern Eggar tends to be the larger of the two. There are morphological differences and different food preferences. Males tend to be day fliers, while females tend to fly from dusk. Unpaired females may attract a large number of males, and eggs are laid loosely in undergrowth. ===Larva=== Caterpillar Cocoon According to different sources, larvae feed on a wide variety of plant species, low down, including blackthorn, hawthorn, viburnum, dogwood, ivy and ling, or bilberry, broom, larch, birch, willow, hazel, sea buckthorn and Rubus species, including bramble. It is not known to feed on oak; however, one entomologist (Brues, 1924) is quoted as saying: Larvae can be infected by a virus that changes their behaviour, causing them to climb out of the protection of low scrub and leave them open to predation, facilitating the spread of the infection. The caterpillar hairs of some species of moth, such as the oak processionary moth (Thaumetopoea processionea), can cause skin irritation, but there is no evidence that the oak eggar is one of these, despite the similar name. ===Pupa=== The caterpillar pupates on the ground inside a silken cocoon, the exterior of which is hard and yellowish, and resembles an acorn, hence the moth's name. \\"Eggar\\" is an obsolete word again relating to the shape of the cocoon.

He learned his first tune from his father John Byrne at the age of 8. His style is the old Glencolmcille, County Donegal, style. He was the link between the older generation of musicians in his area - his neighbours, the Dohertys, the Cassidys, the McConnells, to name but a few - and the young generation of Donegal fiddlers today whom he taught and inspired. By 1980, many of the older local musicians had died, and Donegal music was being played only in isolated pubs. Ironically, it was a time when Irish traditional music was becoming increasingly popular throughout Ireland, Britain and America due to groups such as Planxty and the Bothy Band. Claddagh Records, the Dublin label, recorded The Brass Fiddle: Traditional Fiddle Music From Donegal, featuring Byrne. He followed this with a solo album, The Road to Glenlough (a lake near his home in Mín na Croise), in 1990. A young band from Donegal, Altan, started playing many of his tunes and became popular internationally.Obituary, The Guardian, 11 February 2009. James's reputation increased nationally and internationally when adult students of the Irish language and Irish traditional music discovered him while attending language and music classes at the adult language college Oideas Gael. He has taught and inspired musicians all over the world and was instrumental in keeping the rich fiddle tradition of Glencolmcille alive. Today, his family - his wife Connie and their three children Merle, Aisling and Seana - and the many young local musicians he taught continue the vibrant tradition. On many occasions he took part in Ceol sa Ghleann, an arts project hosted in Glencolmcille which includes the annual Féile Ealaíon Traidsiúnta Ghleann Cholm Cille. This is a week-long annual music festival held around Easter time. They also run annual Donegal Fiddle school 'Scoil Samhraidh James Byrne' every July in his memory. https://web.archive.org/web/20081204101816/http://www.ceolsaghleann.com/ He was interviewed by BBC Northern Ireland on an educational programme about the connection between Donegal and Scottish fiddle music.BBC Northern Ireland (PDF file. He was also interviewed by Michael Robinson for Fiddler Magazine on The Donegal Fiddle tradition.Fiddler Magazine . In recent years, He began his own summer fiddle school, and performed regularly with his partner, Connie Drost, and their daughters Merle, Aisling and Séana, all excellent fiddlers.

The term former cathedral in this list includes any Christianhere defined as a member church of the World Council of Churches or the (Roman) Catholic Church church (building) in Great Britain which has been the seat of a bishop,but not one designated as an area bishop, an assistant bishop, or a suffragan bishop but is not so any longer. The status of a cathedral, for the purpose of this list, does not depend on whether the church concerned is known to have had a formal \\"throne\\" (or cathedra) nor whether a formal territory or diocese was attached to the church. Before the development of dioceses, which began earlier in England than in Scotland and Wales, \\"[s]uch bishops as there were either lived in monasteries or were 'wandering bishops'\\".Cook, David (2004). St Boniface 675/754 - the first European. Crediton: Crediton Church Corporation, p. 15 This list therefore includes early \\"bishop's churches\\" (a \\"proto-cathedral\\" is similar). A former cathedral may be the building that lost its cathedral status or its site, whether now vacant or not. The loss of status may be because that bishopric is extinct, or was relocated. Sometimes a new cathedral was built near an older one, with the older building then used for other purposes, or demolished. Such a building or site counts as a former cathedral. Where a cathedral is modified or rebuilt on substantially the same site in a series of developments over time, the earlier versions are not counted here as former cathedrals (except for the unique case of London's \\"Old St Paul's\\"). A former pro-cathedral is a church or former church (or site of a former church) which was once a temporary cathedral officially performing that role until its expected replacement by an intended permanent cathedral took place, usually by completion of a new cathedral built for that purpose. A once proposed cathedral is a church which, on some past occasion, was proposed (usually by a church or civil authority) as a future cathedral, but for some reason that particular proposal failed. In some cases a later proposal succeeded and the church then became the seat of a bishop, but the church concerned will still be listed here for record purposes because of the earlier (failed) proposal. ==England== References are to the English church's current use or its use prior to deconsecration. ===Cathedrals founded before 1066=== survivors becoming Church of England at the Reformation {  ! width=10%  Location !! width=5%  Image !! width=15%  Name !! width=10%  Dates !! width=55%  Notes !! width=5%  Coordinates - valign=top  Bradwell- on-Sea, Essex 100px 100px  Chapel of St Peter-on-the-Wall  style=\\"text- align:center\\"  654 -664  After a mission to the East Saxons from London by St Mellitus failed in c. 616, St Cedd was sent from Northumbria in 653 (consecrated a bishop in 654).Jeffery (2012), p. 23 His chosen site was the former Roman fort of Othona, near Bradwell.

A new see, for Devon and Cornwall, was created in the early 10th century out of the diocese of Sherborne, possibly first at Tawton, but certainly by 909 at Crediton. The (likely wooden) monastic cathedral of St Mary was replaced, after the see had been moved to Exeter in 1050, by a new collegiate church on the same site, with a new dedication from the 1230s. The college was dissolved in 1545, and the church was bought in 1547 by parishioners as their parish church.  style=\\"font-size:smaller\\"  - valign=top  Dinuurrin, (Bodmin), Cornwall  100px  Chapel of the Holy Rood    9th C  Dinuurrin is a \\"lost\\" placename known only to us as the seat of a medieval Cornish bishopnot a \\"Bishop of Cornwall\\"; the extent of his influence is unknown named Kenstec.

There are good reasonsOlson (1989), pp. 51-56; Jankulak (2000), pp. 57-60 to believe that Dinuurrin was located om high ground at the northern edge of Bodmin. The Guild Chapel of the Holy Rood was built in such a place in the early 16th century, but fell into ruin soon after following the reformation - only the roofless shell of its tower (shown), now known as \\"Berry Tower\\", remains. However, the site is ancient and was of high status (with the chapel unusually enjoying rights of baptism and burial),Olson (1989), p. 54 and it is thought likely that Bishop Kenstec's seat was here.

The latter may be the more likely, its placename being derived from Felix stowe (= Felix's holy place).Jones, T.

It later became a Mercian bishopric for two periods: firstly, in c. 675 until merged into the Leicester diocese in c. 685,Tiller (2005), pp. 25-26 (or c. 737);Kirby, D. P.

The secular canons of 635-1140 were replaced by the Augustinian canons of Dorchester Abbey. After the dissolution in 1536 the chancel of the abbey church was bought in 1542 for £140 by Richard Beauforest, and on his death in 1555 it was left in his Will to the parish; the whole then became the parish church.Tiller (2005), pp. 41-42 There are 11th-century traces, a (reconstructed) shrine of St Birinus, and a fine 14th-century Jesse window.Jenkins (1999), p. 542  style=\\"font-size:smaller\\"  - valign=top  Durham, County Durham  100px 100px 100px  The White Church (Alba Ecclesia) (almost certainly dedicated to St Cuthbert)    c. 998 - c. 1104  Towards the end of the 10th century the community of St Cuthbert, which had been settled at Chester-Le-Street for almost a century (since 883),Cannon (2011), p. 313 became fearful of renewed Viking attacks.Jeffery (2012), p. 18 Carrying St Cuthbert's body they once again sought safety, and journeyed south to arrive in 995 at Durham, which provided a secure site. After using one or two temporary wooden structures, in 998 the community began building a stone (therefore \\"white\\") church into which Cuthbert's relics were transferred the next year. This cruciform stone Anglo-Saxon cathedral, with a central and a western tower. was completed c. 1020. In 1083 the second Norman bishop, William de St-Calais, suppressed the community of Cuthbert, replacing them with Benedictine monks from Evesham, who had lately restored Monkwearmouth- Jarrow Abbey.Cannon (2011), p. 314 Durham thus became a cathedral priory, and in 1093 Bishop William began construction of the Norman cathedral that underlies today's cathedral. By 1104 building had progressed sufficiently to allow the transfer of Cuthbert's relics from The White Church to the new cathedral, allowing the demolition of The White Church. There is good evidence that the foundations of The White Church lie beneath the cloister garth (shown) in the monastic buildings just south of the present cathedral, to which the co-ordinates relate.Crook, J.

The Norman cathedral was begun in 1114 just east of St Mary's (on the site of the church of St Peter, and continuing that dedication), and was completed c. 1200. By 1222 St Mary's had become the parish church of St Mary Major (Great St Mary).

Bishops certainly existed in areas from the earliest Christian times (often from Irish monastic missionary activity), but the territory over which an early (often monastic) bishop operated was limited and ill-defined. Hence the term \\"bishop's church\\" is sometimes used for a seat used by an early bishop rather than the word \\"cathedral\\" which some expect to be attached to a formal diocese. Traditionally, the medieval Scottish diocesan system was held to have been largely created by King David I (reigned 1124-1153), though this is an oversimplification. As the Scottish Reformation of 1560 developed, bishops and cathedrals became progressively marginalised and neglected. By Act of the Scottish Parliament 1690 (confirming the Church's own final decision of 1689) the Church of Scotland finally became wholly Presbyterian, with no dioceses, no bishops, so no functioning cathedrals. At that date all Church of Scotland cathedrals became former cathedrals. Some still use the title, but for honorific purposes only. The Scottish Episcopal Church and the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland maintain their own diocesan structures with their own cathedrals and bishops. {  ! width=10%  Location !! width=5%  Image !! width=15%  Name !! width=10%  Dates !! width=55%  Notes !! width=5%  Coordinates - valign=top  Abercorn, West Lothian 100pxdedication unknown    681-685  A monastery was founded c. 675 by St Wilfrid near the northern extremity of the newly expanded Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria.

When the cathedral was consecrated, in 1239, the body of Bishop Adam was removed from Skinnet and re-interred at Dornoch. This use of Skinnet for the first interment (and not any church there may have been at Halkirk itself), may mean that Skinnet served as cathedral before Dornoch.

By Act of the Scottish Parliament 1690 (confirming the Church's own final decision of 1689) the Church of Scotland became wholly Presbyterian, with no dioceses, no bishops, so no cathedrals as such. At that date all Church of Scotland cathedrals became former cathedrals. Some still use the title, but for honorific purposes only. The Scottish Episcopal Church and the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland maintain their own diocesan structures with their own cathedrals and bishops, as do the Orthodox churches.

The stone arcade between the naves was replaced by wooden columns in 1768.Wooding (2011), p. 66 Among interesting features is a large mural of Saint Christopher of exceptional quality, painted c. 1415 (shown).  style=\\"font-size:smaller\\"  - valign=top  Rhuddlan, Denbighshire  100px not known    proposed  In 1281 King Edward I and Anian II, Bishop of St Asaph, petitioned the Pope to approve the transfer of the see of St Asaph to a new, larger, fortified town being built (for English settlers) at Rhuddlan, due to claimed remoteness and dangers of St Asaph itself. But a Welsh rising in 1282 and further territorial gains by the English led to the proposal's abandonment by 1283. The intended site of the cathedral was probably used for the construction of the new parish church, St Mary's, in c.1300 (shown).Taylor, A. J.

After his return to the Glasgow area Kentigern was succeeded here as bishop by Saint Asaph (or Asaf, or Asa), which later led to Llanelwy being known (in English) as St Asaph. The site of the original (wooden) cathedral is almost certainly now occupied by the parish church (near the river) at the foot of the hill crowned by the current cathedral, originally Norman following the re-establishment of the bishopric in 1143.Davies (1982), p. 159 The double-naved parish church building (shown) dates from the 13th century and later.  style=\\"font-size:smaller\\"  - } The Seven Bishop-Houses of the Kingdom of DyfedCharles-Edwards (1971)Charles- Edwards (2013), pp.596-598Davies (1982), pp.158-160James (2007), pp.47-68Petts (2009), pp.162-164 Collections of medieval Welsh Law record that the (early medieval) Kingdom of Dyfed had seven so-called \\"bishop-houses\\" (in Welsh, esgopty), following a general pattern of one bishop-house in each cantref.Charles-Edwards (2013), p. 597 Their role is not clear, but they must have been relatively important ecclesiastical sites (with St Davids having a higher status than any of the others). Apart from the Bishop of St Davids, their heads were described as abbots, not bishops. Whether the other six were also bishoprics, former bishoprics, burial places of saint-bishops,Charles-Edwards (2013), p.597 or staging posts in the travels of (say) the bishop of St DavidsCharles-Edwards (2013), p.598 is debated. They are included in this List of former cathedrals in Great Britain on the basis that any and all of them may well have been the seat of a bishop at some time. Details of all seven bishop-houses are given below for the sake of completeness, although St Davids has never ceased to be the seat of a bishop. The status of bishop-house, as distinct from the cathedral at St Davids, seems not to have survived the ending of the Kingdom of Dyfed (920), even less the arrival of the Normans. It should not be assumed that the sites identified below are exactly the original sites of the bishop-houses (with the probable exception of Llandeilo Llwydarth): some minor relocation over the course of centuries cannot be ruled out. {  ! width=10%  Location !! width=5%  Image !! width=15%  Medieval Placename (spellings may vary) !! width=15%  Pre-Norman Cantref (spellings may vary) !! width=50%  Notes !! width=5%  Coordinates - valign=top  St Davids, Pembrokeshire  100px  Mynyw  style=\\"text- align:center\\"  Prebidiog  The cathedral at St Davids is not a former cathedral: to the contrary, it has continued to be the seat of a bishop since its foundation in the 6th century. It only appears here to complete this sub- list of Dyfed's seven bishop-houses. For more details see St Davids Cathedral.  style=\\"font-size:smaller\\"  - valign=top  Carmarthen, Carmarthenshire   Llan Teulydawc    Gwarthaf  The Normans made the church a cell of Battle Abbey. Later, in c.1125, the Bishop of St Davids founded here the Priory of St John the Evangelist and St Teulyddog with Augustinian Canons (dissolved 1536). Eventually the site was cleared c.1781 and put to industrial use. A late medieval gatehouse survives, subdivided for residential use.  style=\\"font-size:smaller\\"  - valign=top  Clydau, Pembrokeshire 100px  Llan Geneu    Emlyn  The 14th-15th century parish church (shown) is dedicated to St Clydai but the medieval placename clearly refers to St Ceneu. Restored in the late 19th century, the most original parts of the church are its tower and nave. It is sited centrally among the five hamlets it serves.  style=\\"font-size:smaller\\"  - valign=top  Llandeilo Llwydarth, Maenclochog, Pembrokeshire   Llan Teilaw    Deugleddyf (originally)  A minor pre- Norman boundary adjustment led to the church \\"moving\\" to Cantref Cemais.James (2007), p.57 Dedicated to Saint Teilo, it was abandoned sometime after 1833. The ruin lies in a circular enclosure, with St Teilo's Well some 150m to the north-east. The water had reputed healing powers, notably when drunk from the saint's supposed skull (now kept in the south chapel of Llandaff Cathedral).  style=\\"font-size:smaller\\"  - valign=top  Rhoscrowther, Pembrokeshire 100px  Llan Degeman    Penfro  St Decuman's church is now largely isolated by an oil refinery to its immediate north, and an army gunnery range to the south. The village was evacuated in 1994 after a refinery explosion. The church is 14th century (the nave and chancel possibly older), restored in the 19th century, and now cared for by Friends of Friendless Churches.  style=\\"font-size:smaller\\"  - valign=top  Saundersfoot, Pembrokeshire100px  Llan Ussyllt    Penfro  The town of Saundersfoot lies within the ancient parish called St Issells by the Normans. The parish church, dedicated to Saint Issel, stands about 0.5 miles (1 km) north of the town. Its chancel arch is 13th century and the tower is 14th/15th century. It was restored 1862-64.  style=\\"font- size:smaller\\"  - valign=top  St Ishmaels, Pembrokeshire 100px  Llan Ismael    Rhos  The original church here was \\"the home of St Ishmael, who became the second bishop of St Davids in c.589\\".Smith (2011), p.450 The oldest parts of the present church (shown) may be 12th century. It is about 0.5 miles (0.9 km) south of the rather isolated village of St Ishmaels, in an area called Monk Haven, with some early monastic remains nearby.  style=\\"font-size:smaller\\"  - } ==See also== * Lists of cathedrals in the United Kingdom * List of cathedrals in Ireland ==NotesReferences== * Barlow, Frank (2nd edn. 1979).

The serial was first broadcast on the BBC and was directed by David Yates, written by Andrew Davies and produced by Nigel Stafford-Clark. David Suchet starred as Augustus Melmotte, with Shirley Henderson as his daughter Marie, Matthew Macfadyen as Sir Felix Carbury, Cillian Murphy as Paul Montague and Miranda Otto as Mrs Hurtle. ==Plot summary== Augustus Melmotte is a foreign financier with a mysterious past. When he and his family move to London, the city's upper crust begins buzzing with rumours about him and a host of characters find their lives changed because of him. Lady Carbury is a widow living in straitened circumstances with her handsome but dissolute son, Sir Felix, and her modest, intelligent daughter, Henrietta. Sir Felix has gambled away his inheritance and his mother supports them by writing. Her close friend, Mr Broune, a newspaper publisher, reviews her books favourably because of his regard for her and clearly wants their relationship to be closer. At his gambling club, Felix hears his friends say that Melmotte's daughter, Marie, will have a huge dowry. Returning home, he impulsively tells his mother that he will try to retrieve the family's fortunes by marrying Marie. When the Carburys are invited to a grand ball given at Melmotte's Grosvenor Square mansion, Felix, an experienced ladies' man, meets Marie, a trusting and inexperienced girl, and sweeps her off her feet. Roger, the Carburys' cousin, is a kind and decent country squire. He has been in love with Henrietta for years but has never said anything, as she has only recently come of age. Paul Montague is a young engineer, formerly Roger's ward. Newly returned to England from America with plans to build a railroad from Utah to Mexico, Paul meets Henrietta when the Carburys visit Roger's estate. Roger visits London and proposes to Henrietta, who explains that her fondness for him can never become the love he hopes for. Roger refuses to give up, but when he meets Paul later and reveals what happened, Paul discloses that he too is interested in Henrietta. The men's long friendship cools. Paul and his American partner meet with Melmotte, who agrees to arrange a stock offering. He invites Sir Felix and a number of his aristocratic friends to join the railroad's board of directors; none of them knows or cares anything about the company's business, but they are delighted at the chance to profit from it. The stock offering proves a huge success and the share price goes up and up. Melmotte's prestige and influence are greatly enhanced and he begins to be accepted in English society. Paul is anxious to go to America to begin construction, but for some reason Melmotte keeps putting off the financial arrangements that are necessary for the work. Paul learns that Mrs Hurtle, a woman he was engaged to in America, has come to London. She vanished before the marriage and he assumed that she had thrown him over. Now she tells him that she means to enforce his promise of marriage. Through a combination of bullying and pleading, she keeps a hold on him. Sir Felix continues to woo Marie and finally approaches Melmotte, who is doubtful of the idea because Felix has no money. Marie convinces Felix to elope, that her father will eventually support them financially. To pay for the trip to New York, she steals a cheque from Melmotte's desk. At the docks Felix fails to board, hung over from a night at his club, while Marie is stopped by constables investigating the stolen cheque and is forced to return to her father's house. Marie is visited by Felix's sister Henrietta, who informs her that Felix doesn't have the courage to defy Melmotte and has no interest in marrying Marie without a dowry. Marie's feelings for Felix soon change from love to hatred. Melmotte has had himself elected to Parliament, and on the strength of the successful railroad stock offering, has borrowed huge sums of money and begun other ambitious projects. Only Paul seems to know or care whether the railroad exists. When he returns to London to confront Melmotte, Melmotte warns that if the truth is revealed, Paul and everyone who has invested in the railroad will be ruined. Paul, unwilling to be involved in a fraud even if it makes him rich, tells the whole story to Mr Alf, who promptly publishes it in his newspaper. The railroad company's stock begins to plunge. Sir Felix is aware of his sister's interest in Paul, and when Henrietta reproaches him for abandoning Marie, he spitefully tells her what he knows about Paul. Henrietta visits Mrs Hurtle, who makes Henrietta believe that her affair is still going on. Henrietta then tells Paul they cannot see each other again. The precipitous fall of the railroad stock causes Melmotte's fortunes to sink as quickly as they rose. His creditors begin pressing for repayment. As a last resort, he asks Marie to turn over to him a large sum of money he put in her name to protect it from his creditors, but Marie, who has become bitter and cynical since the end of her relationship with Sir Felix, refuses. Melmotte commits suicide. Marie, still wealthy thanks to her nest egg, packs up and leaves London. With the failure of her son's attempt to marry Marie, Lady Carbury is at the end of her rope financially. The publisher, Mr Broune, proposes marriage to her and she accepts happily. He persuades her to send Sir Felix, in the charge of an Anglican clergyman, to a remote town in Prussia, far from the temptations of London club life and where he will not be able to importune his mother for funds. Mrs Hurtle, accepting that Paul will never marry her, quits London; before going she informs Henrietta of the truth. Henrietta and Paul marry, while their former suitors, Roger Carbury and Mrs Hurtle, each learn to accept the situation with some grace. It is revealed at the end that Paul and Henrietta lived a long and happy life, while Mrs Hurtle dies of old age. ==Awards== At the 2002 BAFTA Awards, director David Yates and producer Nigel Stafford-Clark collected an award for The Way We Live Now, which won Best Drama Serial.

In 1901, the New York Herald arranged to have Marconi company equipment installed on a lightship anchored off of Nantucket, Massachusetts.\\"News of Incoming Steamers Will Be Flashed to the Herald by Wireless Telegraph on Nantucket Lightship, Far at Sea\\", May 19, 1901, First section, page 3. (fultonhistory.com) This station was intended to provide service to maritime traffic, especially vessels approaching New York harbor after making an Atlantic crossing. However, one of the installation conditions was that, except during emergencies, the Marconi-employed Nantucket operators would not communicate with any vessels using non-Marconi equipment. Marconi company representatives claimed that this policy was justified because in their view all other radio systems were infringements on Guglielmo Marconi's basic patents, and also because other companies should not be allowed to take advantage of the coastal stations they had constructed at great expense.\\"Mr. Marconi and His Critics\\" (letter from Wilfrid Blaydes), Electrical World and Engineer, April 12, 1902, pages 656-658. This was challenged by the competing companies, which insisted that they had developed non-infringing systems, in addition to the fact that, in countries such as Great Britain and Italy, government policies had given Marconi a practical monopoly in establishing shore stations. SS Deutschland was a Hamburg America Line German passenger steamer equipped with Slaby-d'Arco radio equipment.\\"The Slaby-Arco Portable Field Equipment for Wireless Telegraphy\\" by A. Frederick Collins, Scientific American, December 28, 1901, pages 425-426. As the ship was beginning a transatlantic crossing to Germany, one of the passengers, Prince Heinrich of Prussia, brother of the German Kaiser, attempted to send a wireless telegram through Nantucket thanking U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt for his recent hospitality.\\"Objections to Monopoly\\", History of Communications-electronics in the United States Navy by Linwood S. Howeth, 1963, pages 70-71. However, the Nantucket station refused to accept the message because the vessel did not have a Marconi installation. This refusal to establish communication was later repeated by the Marconi shore station at Lizard, located in south Cornwall, England. These events brought the Marconi non-communication policy to international attention.\\"Recent Wireless Telegraphic Developments\\", The Electrician, April 4, 1902, pages 942-943. Although commercial radio communication was only a few years old, the dispute emphasized the need for an international policy to establish ground rules for service requirements. The German government sent out diplomatic notes asking for participation in a conference to address the issue, and the next year it sponsored a Preliminary Conference on Wireless Telegraphy, attended by representatives from eight major countries. This was the first international body reviewing radio communication policies, and the subject of requiring interconnection between stations operated by various companies was a major issue addressed by the participants. == See also == * Open access (infrastructure) * Preliminary Conference on Wireless Telegraphy == References == Category:History of the telegraph Category:1902 in economics Category:1902 in radio ","title":"Deutschland incident (1902)"},{"id":"19259043","text":"Diren Akdemir (born 4 February 1985) is a Swiss-Turkish football defender who plays for FC Vaduz in the Swiss Super League. == Career == He played at youth level for FC Basel and in 2005 joined FC Vaduz.

During World War I, he served with London Scottish as a non- commissioned officer before being commissioned in the Royal Engineers as a temporary second lieutenant on 15 October 1915. He served with the British Expeditionary Force in France between 1915 and 1919. Robertson received promotion to the rank of lieutenant on 4 October 1916 and was appointed adjutant on 30 October. He was appointed to the acting rank of captain on 10 November 1916 and by 1 October 1918 was an acting major (at which point he received the temporary rank of captain). Robertson retired from the army on 4 May 1919, being promoted at the same time to the temporary rank of major. During the war Robertson was mentioned twice in dispatches and received the Military Cross and bar. He was awarded the Military Cross on 26 September 1917 for personally visiting, during heavy artillery and gas bombardment, a number of bridges to report upon their condition. He was badly affected by the gas but completed the task and afterwards ensured that supplies were carried up for the repair of the structures. The bar was awarded 8 March 1919 for actions taken 22-25 October 1918. During the Hundred Days Offensive he successfully erected five bridges over a canal and several streams at Nivelle, whilst under German machine gun and artillery fire. ==Civilian career== After the First World War he held numerous positions in the railway industry, including positions with Great Eastern and London and North Eastern Railways, before becoming Chief Civil Engineer (1938–40) and then Engineer-in-Chief (1940–43) to the London Passenger Transport Board. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1943 Birthday Honours for his contribution to London transport during the Second World War. In 1944 he became Chief Civil Engineer to the Southern Railway Company, and the Southern Region of British Railways post-nationalisation, until his retirement in 1951. Subsequently, he was a partner and then consultant to Sir William Halcrow and Partners until 1964. Robertson had become a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1919, was elected a fellow in 1930 and served as president for the November 1949 to November 1950 session. He was also a fellow and president of the Permanent Way Institution, vice-president of the Institution of Transport, a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and the Institution of Electrical Engineers, an honorary fellow of the Society of Engineers and an honorary member of the American Railway Engineering Association. Additionally, he was a member and in 1957 president of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers. == Second World War Military Service == Robertson had been appointed to the Supplementary Reserve as a major on 19 November 1924 and ceased to belong to that unit exactly four years later. His military career was revived on 26 February 1938 when he was appointed a lieutenant-colonel in the Engineer and Railway Staff Corps, a voluntary part-time unit supporting the British Army. He was promoted to colonel on 8 May 1940 and later served as commanding officer of the unit, until 1 January 1956. == References  * Category:1890 births Category:1971 deaths Category:British civil engineers Category:Presidents of the Institution of Civil Engineers Category:Presidents of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Recipients of the Military Cross Category:Royal Engineers officers Category:Engineer and Railway Staff Corps officers Category:People educated at Dover College ","title":"Vernon Robertson"},{"id":"19259272","text":"Charles Peterson (born 1964 in Longview, Washington) is an American photographer well known for his work with the Seattle independent record label Sub Pop and for capturing the then-newly emerging grunge scene in images.

He is quite happy in his lonely self-sufficiency until unexpectedly a woman, Mary Petrie, comes to live with him. Unsettled at first, the narrator gradually gets used to the companionship. Then news comes of a new community being established on the edge of the plain by a charismatic, yet enigmatic figure who is digging a canyon and gaining more and more followers to his revolutionary cause. One by one, his neighbours join the canyon project, moving their tin houses to the new community as the narrator feels under increasing pressure to join them. It transpires that the end-goal for the project is not for there to be a city of tin houses, but a city of clay houses. Many of the previously convinced citizens of the plain and beyond are frustrated by this news, and decide to return to their previous existences. ==References *Three to See the King at The Complete Review Category:2001 British novels Category:HarperCollins books ","title":"Three to See the King"},{"id":"19259298","text":"Charles Peterson may refer to: * Charles A.

In developing countries with a sunny climate, solar-powered vaccine refrigerators are common. == Requirements for vaccine refrigeration == Data logging cable shown running through the door gasket, creating a gap which air can enter and escape through. Many vaccines must be stored at low temperatures, some below -15°C, and others between 2 and 8°C.Vaccine Handling Tips, Immunization Action CoalitionKXN Nigeria Ltd, Nigeria: PV-powered vaccine fridges, Ashden Awards If vaccines are not stored correctly they can lose their effectiveness. The ideal temperature for storing vaccines in the ILR is +2 degrees to + 8 degrees According to the Center for Disease Control, failure to adhere to recommended specifications for storage and handling of immunobiologics can reduce or destroy their potency, resulting in inadequate or no immune response in the recipient. Maintenance of vaccine quality is the shared responsibility of all handlers of vaccines from the time a vaccine is manufactured until administration. According to the Immunization Action Coalition, all vaccines should be stored in a refrigerator or freezer that is designed specifically for the storage of biologics or, alternatively, in a separate dedicated unit. A dorm-style combination refrigerator-freezer unit with just one exterior door has been shown to be unacceptable no matter where the vaccine was placed inside the unit. Stand-alone refrigerator or freezer units are best for storage needs. With retail pharmacies now playing a major role in pneumonia, influenza and shingles immunization programs, the value of critical vaccines being stored in pharmacy refrigerators has reached a new high. In fact, it is not uncommon for many pharmacies to now have over $100,000 of product in a single refrigerator during peak seasons. It is estimated that $20 million is wasted annually from poor refrigeration, and up to 35% of vaccines are affected by improper storage. Accurate and uniform temperature in a refrigerator plays a key role in ensuring the life of vaccines, reagents and other biologicals. Research has shown that minor variances in temperature such as those in a household refrigerator can compromise the effectiveness of your biologicals, risking up to thousands of dollars in valuable contents. Within these refrigerators and freezers, vaccines are also compromised through improper use of the door gasket to feed cables from data loggers and thermometers, allowing excess warm air in, and cold air out of the refrigerator or freezer. Over time this causes the compressor to work harder and eventually leads to failure. This can be remedied by using probe access ports, found on most clinical refrigerators and freezer. These are easy to open up and drastically reduce air intake and loss from inside the units. == Solar powered vaccine refrigerators == In developing countries the electricity grid often does not reach rural areas, and is not always reliable. As keeping vaccines at the appropriate temperature is vital, Solar powered refrigerators are a cost-effective alternative that can be highly reliable. A typical system will use a solar photovoltaic panel to generate electricity from sunlight, and a deep cycle battery to store energy for operation overnight, although newer fridges which have revolutionary Sure Chill Technology or Direct Drive technology do not need batteries to maintain temperatures for many days without sunlight. == WHO approved products == The World Health Organization maintains a list of products related to vaccines that it approves for use, including refrigerators.WHO Product Information Sheets (1.6MB)WHO Qualified Vaccine Refrigerators https://www.fridgexpress.com/ == See also == *Solar power *Vaccines == References  External links == * Solar vaccine refrigerators in Nigeria * Roemer Industries Inc., Solar vaccine refrigerator manufacturer in California USA Category:Cooling technology ","title":"Vaccine refrigerator"},{"id":"19259423","text":"James Alexander Dewar (February 5, 1897 – June 30, 1985) was the Canadian inventor of the Twinkie. ==Biography== James Dewar was born on February 5, 1897, in Pugwash River, Nova Scotia As a young man, Dewar worked on boats shipping timber and limestone, arriving in Chicago on a laker.

It was the first analogue synthesis and composition instrument of its kind. It utilized a unique and innovative control system that had a cathode ray tube input device that could read shapes or patterns that was hand drawn on to its surface with a grease pencil. The drawn shape could define the timbre of the note, or the envelope shape of the sound. A sequence of the rhythmical markings could be defined using the writings similar to a cue sheet type strip of film. This was the future innovation for composers. With Kendal's grease pencil, the composer could draw the grooves, run it through the Composer-Tron and can ensure that all written music was listened to first, before symphony orchestra’s played the music. Before the Composer-Tron composers would have to wait years just to listen if their work was complete. Sometimes their best work was never heard by the composer himself.

Campbell is the director and CEO of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, overseeing the de Young and Legion of Honor museums. He served as the director and CEO of the Metropolitan Museum of Art between 2009-2017. On 30 June 2017, Campbell stepped down as director and CEO of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and accepted the Getty Rothschild Fellowship for research and study at the Getty in Los Angeles and Waddesdon Manor, the UK. ==Early life== He was born in Singapore and raised in Cambridge, England, where he attended The Perse School. He earned a BA in English language and literature at New College, Oxford in 1984, followed by a Diploma from Christie's Fine and Decorative Arts course, London, in 1985. While studying for his master's degree at the Courtauld Institute of Art (1987), he discovered how much mainstream art history had overlooked the major role of tapestry in European art and propaganda. During the following years, he worked to rectify this oversight by creating the Franses Tapestry Archive in London (1987–94), which, with more than 120,000 images, is the largest and most up-to-date information resource on European tapestries and figurative textiles in the world. His early research culminated in several research articles and a PhD from the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London (1999) on the art and culture of King Henry VIII's court. ==Career== Campbell worked in the Metropolitan Museum's Department of European Sculpture and Decorative Arts for 14 years, rising steadily through the curatorial ranks as assistant curator (1995 to 97), associate curator (1997 to 2003), and curator (2003 to December 2008). During this time, he conceived and organized the major exhibitions Tapestry in the Renaissance: Art and Magnificence (2002) and Tapestry in the Baroque: Threads of Splendor (New York, 2007; Palacio Real, Madrid, spring 2008), both of which incorporated drawings, paintings, and prints, as well as tapestries, and received widespread acclaim. The 2002 show was named \\"Exhibition of the Year\\" by Apollo magazine, and its catalogue won the Alfred H. Barr, Jr. Award (College Art Association) for distinguished exhibition catalogue in the history of art (2003). Beginning shortly after his arrival at the museum, he also served as supervising curator of The Antonio Ratti Textile Center, which houses the Museum's encyclopedic collection of 36,000 textiles and is one of the world's preeminent centers of textile studies. The fiscal year from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 saw the Met's highest attendance in 40 years, rising to 6.28 million. During that year, the museum also opened extensive new galleries for both its Islamic and American art and launched a redesigned website that now attracts more than 44 million visits per year. The museum is currently developing plans to renovate The Costume Institute and redesign the Museum's Fifth Avenue plaza and fountains. In March 2016, the Met Breuer opened: a collaboration with the Whitney Museum, in which its landmark Marcel Breuer- designed building, on Madison Avenue and 75th Street, serves as the Met's prime venue for exhibiting contemporary and modern art. Addressing both scholars and the general public, at institutions and museums in the United States and abroad, Campbell has lectured and taught on European court patronage and the relationship between tapestry and other arts. He has also published on the subject of historic European textiles with respect to other art forms of the same periods. He authored the book Henry VIII and the Art of Majesty: Tapestries at the Tudor Court (Yale University Press, 2007) and his articles have appeared in leading scholarly journals, such as Burlington Magazine, Apollo magazine, Studies in the Decorative Arts, and Gazette des Beaux-Arts. He has been the recipient of awards and fellowships, including the Iris Foundation Award (Bard Graduate Center) for a scholar in mid-career deserving recognition for outstanding contributions to the study of decorative arts (2003). According to the 2014 IRS form 990, filed by the Met, Thomas Campbell was compensated $950,762 \\"from the organization,\\" with an additional $344,604 \\"in estimated amounts of other compensation from the organization and related organizations.\\" On January 28, 2017, The New York Times reported that \\"Thomas P. Campbell resigned under pressure on Tuesday as the director and chief executive of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, after months of growing concerns among staff members and some trustees about its financial health and his capacity to lead the largest museum in the country.\\" The article stated that \\"Mr. Campbell’s financial decisions and expansion plans had been criticized by some trustees, curators and other staff members\\". On 30 June 2017, Campbell ended his tenure as director at the Metropolitan Museum. Robin Pogrebin at The New York Times reported on 27 July 2017: \\"Thomas P. Campbell, who last month ended his tumultuous tenure as chief executive of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, has been chosen as the second recipient of the Getty Rothschild Fellowship, the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Rothschild Foundation announced on Thursday. The fellowship supports scholarship in art history, collecting and conservation, offering art historians, museum professionals or conservators up to eight months of research and study at the Getty in Los Angeles and Waddesdon Manor in Buckinghamshire, England.\\" Since 1 November 2018, Campbell serves as the Director and CEO of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, in California. ==Personal life== Campbell is married and lives in San Francisco.

It is the headquarters of Pangani District. ==History== Although archaeologists have found the remains of small 15th century settlements on the bluffs just north of Pangani, the modern town came to prominence in the nineteenth century, when, under nominal Zanzibari rule, it was a major terminus of caravan routes to the deep interior. From the 1860s onward townspeople established large plantations of sugar and coconut in Mauya, along the banks of the river just west of town. The plantations were worked by slave labor, and Pangani also became an important center of the slave trade, shipping captives taken in the wars attendant on the collapse of the Shambaa kingdom in the Usambara mountains to the plantations of Pemba and Zanzibar. After the Sultan of Zanzibar signed treaties with Great Britain outlawing the ocean-going trade in slaves in 1873, Pangani became a center for smuggling slaves across the narrow channel to Pemba, in evasion of British warships. In 1888, Pangani was the center of an armed movement to resist German colonial conquest of the entire mainland Tanzanian coast. The local leader of the resistance was Abushiri ibn Salim al- Harthi, a Swahili-speaker born in Zanzibar who owned a small estate at the suburb that now bears his name. Abushiri was instrumental in coordinating resistance to German conquest along much of the coast. The Germans hanged him at Pangani in December 1889. Several historical sites in and around the town serve as reminders of the strong Arabic influence and the later German and British colonial era in Tanganyika. The district boma or headquarters is the most impressive building remaining from the period of Zanzibari rule. The Mauya plantations no longer grow sugar, but produce much coconut and betel- nut. Pangani was once a secondary center of the sisal industry, servicing sisal plantations to the north and south of town. Pangani also has a fishing industry. In recent years beach resorts north and south of the town have brought tourists. The town is a district headquarters. Its hospital draws patients from many parts of the region. Funguni Secondary School is in Pangani Town and Boza Secondary School is a short distance north. ==TransportAirport=Maritime Transport=== Port of Pangani == Sources == * R.M.

His racing career began in 2006 when he took hiatus from a career in structural engineering, practicing in San Francisco, California. He moved to Washington, D.C. to pursue racing full-time with the Trek Volkswagen East Coast factory team. Schalk's major career breakthrough occurred in 2007 when he won the Shenandoah 100, establishing himself as a primary name in the domestic MTB endurance scene. When the Trek and Volkswagen partnership dissolved at the end of 2008, the Trek Bicycle Corporation continued its support of Jeff by directly signing him to full sponsorship. After his breakthrough in 2007, he moved to Frederick, Maryland and began to specialize in ultra-endurance racing events, namely 100-mile mountain bike races. Over the course of his 6 year career, he amassed 17 wins in 100-mile MTB racing, winning the National Ultra Endurance Series for three consecutive years. Schalk's sponsors for the majority of his career included: Trek Bicycle Corporation, Bontrager, Fox Racing Shox, Shimano, PowerBar, Dumonde Tech Racing Oils, and ESI Grips.

It was the 79th annual Grand Final of the Victorian Football League, staged to determine the premiers for the 1975 VFL season. The match, attended 110,551 spectators, was won by North Melbourne by a margin of 55 points, marking that club's first premiership victory. In doing so, it became the last of the 12 VFL teams to win a flag. The last time North had won a flag prior to that was back in 1918 when they were part of the Victorian Football Association. ==Background== North Melbourne had finished runners up the previous season, having been defeated by Richmond in the 1974 VFL Grand Final, and were the only team not to have won a premiership. This was Hawthorn's first appearance in a Grand Final in four years, having defeated St Kilda in the 1971 VFL Grand Final. North Melbourne lost six of the first nine games of the season before finally hitting their stride, winning eleven of the next thirteen games. At the conclusion of the regular home-and-away season, Hawthorn finished first on the ladder with 17 wins and 5 losses, and North Melbourne had finished third (behind Carlton) with 14 wins and 8 losses. In the finals series leading up to the Grand Final, North Melbourne defeated Carlton by 20 points in the Qualifying Final before being beaten by Hawthorn by 11 points in the Second Semi-Final. They then met Richmond in the Preliminary Final which they won by 17 points to advance to the Grand Final. Hawthorn advanced straight to the Grand Final on the back of their win in the Second Semi-Final. Hawthorn captain Peter Crimmins was overlooked for the 1975 Grand Final after being struck down by testicular cancer. Crimmins declared that he was fit to play after playing 5 reserve games, including one final, and both the selection committee and Hawthorn's supporters were divided over whether he should play. Ultimately the match committee decided against playing him in the game, with coach John Kennedy admitting they were fearful a knock could affect him. As he explained later: \\"It was very hard, it was a unique situation ... Peter wanted to play. The committee was divided. He didn't play. We'll never know what might have happened if he had played.\\" ==Teams== {   } ==Match summary== North Melbourne were on top from the beginning of the game, accumulating nine goals by half time to Hawthorn's five. After the half, North blew the game open, with its last six goals of the match extending the margin from 24 points to 61. Their final winning margin of 55 points was the biggest in a Premiership decider since the 1957 VFL Grand Final. Contributing strongly for North Melbourne were Brent Crosswell, John Rantall, Keith Greig, John Burns, David Dench, Mick Nolan, Sam Kekovich and Doug Wade. Arnold Briedis kicked five goals for the Kangaroos. Peter Knights stood out for Hawthorn. The selection of full-forward Michael Cooke proved to be disastrous for Hawthorn. His four goals in the Semi Final (his league debut) helped the Hawks book a spot in the premiership decider, for which he kept his spot in the side. However, Cooke struggled in the Grand Final and was replaced without managing a kick. He never played another senior game. It was in this game that Kennedy made his famous \\"Don't think, do\\" speech. As he recalled, \\"It was born out of desperation. We had some academics in the team who did a lot of thinking, so I, more or less in exasperation, said 'Don't think, do!\\" ==Epilogue== For North Melbourne it would be the final league game for captain Barry Davis, full-forward Wade and the versatile Gary Farrant. It was also the last time Rantall played with North as he returned to South Melbourne the following season. This was the first of two consecutive Grand Finals to be contested between these teams. In the 1976 VFL Grand Final the fortunes were reversed, with Hawthorn running out winners by a margin of 30 points. This was the last Grand Final to be played under one umpire. The 1976 Grand Final saw the introduction of two field umpires. ==Scorecard== {  style=\\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\\" - ! colspan=\\"5\\" vs - !Team ! Q1 ! Q2 ! Q3 !

It was a feeder league to the Rugby League Conference and had a season that runs from April to August. In its last season of 2009, it was also known as the RL Merit League. It was superseded by the Midlands Rugby League, Yorkshire & Humber Merit League and North West Merit League. ==History== The league was founded as the Midlands Merit League in late 2005 to support the growth of rugby league in non-heartland areas. Originally intended as a stand-alone league, support from the Rugby Football League meant that it could be administered as part of the Rugby League Conference set-up. Interest quickly gathered with 13 teams showing an interest in participating in the inaugural season – 8 eventually participated. The first ever game took place on 8 April 2006 at All Saints Sports College, Sheffield, where the Sheffield Forgers beat the Chesterfield Spires by 58 points to 8. The first cross-league fixture was played in June 2007 when Nottingham Outlaws Academy visited Northampton Casuals of the London League. They also played a return fixture in July. The 2007 season saw the introduction of an informal under-15 league based on Merit League principles. In 2008 the junior competition featured under-14 and under-16 divisions. The league was renamed Rugby League Merit League (RLML) for the 2008 season due to its increased geographical spread with teams from the North of England taking part. 2009 saw the largest ever entry, with over 30 teams split into two pools; \\"Yorkshire and Humber\\" and \\"North West\\" with the Midlands Rugby League becoming its own competition using merit league rules. In 2010 the Yorkshire & Humber Merit League and North West Merit League became separate competitions. ==Teams joining the Rugby League Conference== The league has also proved popular with clubs in the Rugby League Conference (RLC) providing players or teams to the Midlands Merit League. *2007 South Humber Rabbitohs *2008 East Riding and Sheffield Forgers *2009 Nottingham Outlaws A, Moorends-Thorne Marauders A (failed to start season), Parkside Hawks(called up after one game), Wigan Riversiders *2010 Barnsley, Chester Gladiators, Crewe & Nantwich Steamers, Mancunians RL, Victoria Rangers, Wigan Riversiders Eels ==Past winnersChampionship=== {  2006  South Humber Rabbitohs  42–18  Nottingham Outlaws Academy - 2007  St Helens Wild Boars  46–22  German Exiles - 2008  Moorends-Thorne Marauders ML  28–18  Wigan Riversiders - 2009  Upton RL  52–24  Huyton Bulldogs } ===Shield=== {  2007  East Riding RLC  32–26  Nottingham Outlaws Academy - 2008  Nottingham Outlaws Academy  34–32  Sheffield Forgers } ===North West pool=== {  2009  Huyton Bulldogs  36–12  Wigan Eels } ===Yorkshire and the Humber pool=== {  2009  Upton RL  30–22  Victoria Rangers } ==See also== * British rugby league system * London League (rugby league) * Midlands Rugby League * Rugby League Conference ==External links== * Midlands rugby league site * Google map of Merit League teams * Rugby League Conference official site Category:Rugby League Conference ","title":"Midlands Merit League"},{"id":"19259714","text":"The 312th Fighter Wing was a United States Army Air Forces organization.

These past trends may or may not continue into the future. ==Potential changes== Over the next century, experts suggest that climate in Nevada may change even more. Based on projections made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and results from the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research climate model (HadCM2), a model that accounts for both greenhouse gases and aerosols, by 2100, temperatures in Nevada could increase by 3-4 °F (1.7-2.2 °C) in spring and fall (with a range of 1-6 °F [0.5-3.3 °C]), and by 5-6 °F (2.8-3.3 °C) in winter and summer (with a range of 2-10 °F [1.1-5.6 °C]). Precipitation is estimated to decrease in summer by 10% (with a range of -5% to -20%), to increase by 15% in spring, to increase by about 30% in fall, and to increase by about 40% in winter. Other climate models may show different results, especially regarding estimated changes in precipitation. The effects described in the sections that follow take into account estimates from different models. The amount of precipitation received on extremely wet or snowy days in winter is likely to increase. The frequency of extremely hot days in summer would increase. It is not clear how the severity of storms might be affected, although an increase in the frequency and intensity of winter storms is possible. ===Water resources=== The sustained streamflow in Nevada largely results from spring and summer snowmelt in the mountains. Earlier and more rapid snowmelts could contribute to winter and spring flooding, and more intense summer storms could increase the likelihood of flash floods. Although Nevada is extremely dry, intense rains can produce torrents of water and debris. Residential and industrial developments on valley floors and near the foothills are especially vulnerable during flash floods.  Las Vegas water supply  Due to concerns about climate change in the wake of a 2002 drought, daily water consumption in Las Vegas has been reduced from 314 gallons per resident in 2003 to around 205 gallons. Despite these conservation efforts, local water consumption remains 30 percent more than in Los Angeles, and over three times that of San Francisco metropolitan area residents. The Southern Nevada Water Authority is building a $1.4 billion tunnel and pumping station to bring water from Lake Mead, which \\"would allow the city to continue taking water even after the generators and pumps in the Hoover Dam stop operating and California, Arizona and Mexico, which is also entitled to the tail end of the Colorado’s water, are completely cut off.\\" ===Agriculture=== In Nevada, production agriculture is a $300 million annual industry, two- thirds of which comes from livestock, mainly cattle. Almost all of the farmed acres are irrigated. The major crops are hay and potatoes. Climate change could affect crop production, reducing potato yields by about 12%, with hay and pasture yields increasing by about 7%. Farmed acres could rise by 9% or fall by 9%, depending on how climate changes. Livestock production may not be affected, unless summer temperatures rise significantly and conditions become significantly drier. Under these conditions, livestock tend to gain less weight and pasture yields decline, limiting forage. ===Forests=== With changes in climate, the extent of forested areas in Nevada could change little or decline by as much as 15-30%. The uncertainties depend on many factors, including whether soils become drier and, if so, how much drier. Hotter, drier weather could increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires, threatening both property and forests. Drier conditions would reduce the range and health of ponderosa and lodgepole pine forests in the northern and western areas of the state, and increase their susceptibility to fire. Grasslands, rangeland, and desert could expand into previously forested areas. Milder winters could increase the likelihood of insect outbreaks and of subsequent wildfires in the dead fuel left after such an outbreak. These changes would significantly affect the character of Nevada forests and the activities that depend on them. Increased rainfall could reduce the severity of these effects. ===Ecosystems=== The region's inherently variable and unpredictable hydrological and climatic systems could become even more variable with changes in climate, putting stress on wetland ecosystems. The streams and rivers in Nevada are entirely spring-fed or derived from runoff from the mountains. A warmer climate would increase evaporation and shorten the snow season in the mountains, resulting in earlier spring runoff and reduced summer streamflow. This would exacerbate fire risk in the late summer. These threats, coupled with increasing human demands on water resources, could severely reduce the number and quality of wetland habitats, which are already stressed and ephemeral. This would degrade habitat essential for migrating and breeding birds, and could further stress rare and endangered fish species. Many desert- adapted plants and animals already live near their tolerance limits, and could disappear under the hotter conditions predicted under global warming. ==See also== * Sierra Club * Sierra Nevada Alliance ==References== * Climate Change and Nevada, United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2011 ==Further reading== * -- this chapter of the National Climate Assessment covers Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah Nevada Category:Environment of Nevada ","title":"Climate change in Nevada"},{"id":"19259723","text":"RLML may refer to: * Midlands Merit League * 23S rRNA (guanine2445-N2)-methyltransferase, an enzyme ","title":"RLML"},{"id":"19259726","text":"As Is is a 1986 television film adapted by William M.

Terms of engagement: the United States and the European Security Identity, p. 28. Although the French joined in principle in agreeing to the reformation of NATO's military, this did not signal that France would re-join NATO's military structure.Coogan, Charles. (2001).

Due to World War II, it was the first Open since 1939, also held at St Andrews. Sam Snead won his only Open title, four strokes ahead of runners-up Johnny Bulla and Bobby Locke. It was the first win by an American in thirteen years and the second of Snead's seven major titles. Four Americans were in the field of 100; the three that made the cut all finished in the top ten. Qualifying took place on 1–2 July, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes on the Old Course and 18 holes on the New Course. The number of qualifiers was limited to a maximum of 100, ties for 100th place would not qualify. The qualifying score was 159 and exactly 100 players qualified. The Australian Norman Von Nida led the qualifiers at 145. The maximum number of players making the cut after 36 holes was set at forty and ties for 40th place did not make the cut. In his second Open Championship appearance and first since 1937, Snead did not endear himself to the St Andrews crowd on arrival. His first impression of the course was \\"It looks like an old abandoned kinda place,\\" ensuring a cold reception at the start of the tournament. He opened with a round of 71, two behind the lead of Locke, who led by one from Henry Cotton and Von Nida. Cotton took the lead after 36-holes with consecutive rounds of 70, one ahead of Snead and two ahead of Dai Rees. Snead, Bulla, and Rees were tied for the lead at 215 (−4) going into the final round on Friday afternoon, with Cotton one behind. Snead best navigated the strong winds of the final round; after dropping four shots on the front-nine, he was able to use his length and accuracy to record a 35 on the back for a round of 75 and a 290 total. Locke moved into second with a 76, while Bulla finished with a 79 to tie Locke for third place. Rees tied for fourth with the help of a tournament record-tying round of 67 in the second round. Snead's win here was his only Open Championship title and he played the tournament only three more times, not returning until 1962. He was the first American to win the title since Denny Shute in 1933. The next was Ben Hogan in 1953 at Carnoustie in his only trip to Britain, then Arnold Palmer's consecutive wins in 1961 and 1962. Dick Burton, the defending champion from 1939, relinquished the trophy after seven years and finished in twelfth place. == Past champions in the field  Made the cut === {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  To par  Finish -  align=leftHenry Cotton  align=left  1934, 1937  70  70  76  79  295  +3  T4 -  align=leftDick Burton  align=left  1939  74  76  76  76  302  +10  12 -  align=leftReg Whitcombe  align=left  1938  71  76  82  76  305  +13  T14 -  align=leftAlf Perry  align=left  1935  78  77  78  80  313  +21  T26 -  align=leftAlf Padgham  align=left  1936  79  74  76  87  316  +24  T31 } Source: === Missed the cut === {   !Player  Country  Year won  R1  R2  Total  To par -  align=leftArthur Havers  align=left  1923  77  78  155  +11 } Source: Did not enter: * Denny Shute (1933), Gene Sarazen (1932), Tommy Armour (1931), Bobby Jones (1926, 1927, 1930), Walter Hagen (1922, 1924, 1928, 1929), Jim Barnes (1925). ==Round summariesFirst round=== Wednesday, 3 July 1946 {class= !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par - align=center1  Bobby Locke   align=center69  align=center−4 - rowspan=2 align=centerT2  Henry Cotton   rowspan=2 align=center70  rowspan=2 align=center−3 - Norman Von Nida  - rowspan=5 align=centerT4  Johnny Bulla   rowspan=5 align=center71  rowspan=5 align=center−2 - Bill Hancock  - Joe Kirkwood Sr.  - Sam Snead  - Reg Whitcombe  - align=center9  Charlie Ward   align=center73  align=centerE - rowspan=2 align=centerT10  Percy Alliss   rowspan=2 align=center74  rowspan=2 align=center+1 - Dick Burton  } Source: ===Second round=== Thursday, 4 July 1946 {class= !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par - align=center1  Henry Cotton   70-70=140  align=center−6 - align=center2  Sam Snead   71-70=141  align=center−5 - align=center3  Dai Rees   75-67=142  align=center−4 - rowspan=2 align=centerT4  Johnny Bulla   71-72=143  rowspan=2 align=center−3 - Bobby Locke   69-74=143 - rowspan=4 align=centerT6  Percy Alliss   74-72=146  rowspan=4 align=centerE - Joe Kirkwood Sr.   71-75=146 - Norman Von Nida   70-76=146 - Charlie Ward   73-73=146 - align=center10  Reg Whitcombe   71-76=147  align=center+1 } Source: ===Third round=== Friday, 5 July 1946 (morning) {class= !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par - rowspan=3 align=centerT1  Johnny Bulla   71-72-72=215  rowspan=3 align=center−4 - Dai Rees   75-67-73=215 - Sam Snead   71-70-74=215 - align=center4  Henry Cotton   70-70-76=216  align=center−3 - align=center5  Bobby Locke   69-74-75=218  align=center−1 - align=center6  Charlie Ward   73-73-73=219  align=centerE - align=center7  Norman Von Nida   70-76-74=220  align=center−1 - rowspan=2 align=centerT8  Fred Daly   77-71-76=224  rowspan=2 align=center+5 - Joe Kirkwood Sr.   71-75-78=224 - align=center10  Lawson Little   78-75-72=225  align=center+6 } Source: ===Final round=== Friday, 5 July 1946 (afternoon) {class= !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par!!Money (£) - align=center1  Sam Snead   71-70-74-75=290  align=center–2  align=center150 - rowspan=2 align=centerT2  Johnny Bulla   71-72-72-79=294  rowspan=2 align=center+2  rowspan=2 align=center87 ½ - Bobby Locke   69-74-75-76=294 - rowspan=4 align=centerT4  Henry Cotton   70-70-76-79=295  rowspan=4 align=center+3  rowspan=4 align=center26 ¼ - Dai Rees   75-67-73-80=295 - Norman Von Nida   70-76-74-75=295 - Charlie Ward   73-73-73-76=295 - rowspan=2 align=centerT8  Fred Daly   77-71-76-74=298  rowspan=2 align=center+6  rowspan=3 align=center15 - Joe Kirkwood Sr.   71-75-78-74=298 - align=center10  Lawson Little   78-75-72-74=299  align=center+7 } Source: Amateurs: Bell (+24), Wilson (+25), Dowie (+27), White (+28), Urry (+38). ==References *75th Open - St Andrews 1946 (Official site) *1946 Open Championship (about.sports) Category:The Open Championship Open Championship Open Championship Category:Golf tournaments in Scotland Category:July 1946 sports events ","title":"1946 Open Championship"},{"id":"19259898","text":"The 1947 Open Championship was the 76th Open Championship, held 2–4 July at Royal Liverpool Golf Club in Hoylake, England. Fred Daly became the first Irish winner of the Open Championship, one stroke ahead of runners-up Reg Horne and amateur Frank Stranahan. It was Daly's only major title. Qualifying took place on 30 June and 1 July, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes at Hoylake and 18 holes at Arrowe Park. The number of qualifiers was limited to a maximum of 100, and ties for 100th place would not qualify. Norman Von Nida led the qualifiers for the second successive year, scoring 139; the qualifying score was 155 and 100 players advanced. Only five Americans entered the qualifier, and none were former champions. Par was set at 68 for the championship, which was the course record at the time. The course was regularly par 72 at ; all four par-5 holes were shortened slightly and made into par-4 holes. The total prize money was £1000, with a winner's share of £150, £100 for second, £75 for third, £50 for fourth, £25 for fifth, and £15 for each of the next 35 players. The £1000 was completed with a £15 prize for winning the qualification event and four £15 prizes for the lowest score in each round. Where an amateur finished in a place where there was a cash prize that money was donated to the P.G.A. Benevolent Fund. The prize money distribution meant that, with a maximum of forty players making the cut, all professionals making the cut received prize money. Henry Cotton and Laurie Ayton, Jnr shared the first round lead on Wednesday, but in the second round both fell back with rounds of 78 and 80, respectively. After 36 holes, Daly led at 143 (+7), four shots ahead of Cotton and Sam King. The maximum number of players making the cut after 36 holes was again set at 40, and ties for 40th place did not make the cut. Daly had a poor third round on Friday morning, shooting 78 to fall into a tie for the lead with Cotton, Arthur Lees, and Norman Von Nida. There were a further nine players within three-strokes of the lead. Horne, who began two back, made the first move with a 35 on the front-nine. He took a pair of 5s at the 16th and 17th holes, however, and at the 18th his putt for a three lipped out and finished at 294. Daly began the round with a 38 (+4) on the front, but he recovered on the back and holed a birdie putt on the 18th to post 293. Cotton made the turn in 36 and needed another 36 on the back to tie Daly, but in the blustery wind this proved too difficult and he finished at 297. That left Stranahan as the last player on the course able to tie Daly. He reached the 17th needing to play the final two holes in seven strokes, but a three- putt led to a five and saw him needing an improbable two on the last. He gave it a good shot, with his approach stopping less than a foot (0.3 m) from the hole. == Past champions in the field == {  style=\\"text- align:center\\" !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  To par  Finish -  align=leftDick Burton  align=left  1939  77  71  77  71  296  +24  5 -  align=leftHenry Cotton  align=left  1934, 1937  69  78  74  76  297  +25  T6 -  align=leftAlf Padgham  align=left  1936  75  75  74  76  300  +28  T13 -  align=leftReg Whitcombe  align=left  1938  75  77  71  77  300  +28  T13 -  align=leftAlf Perry  align=left  1935  76  77  71  77  304  +32  T18 -  align=leftArthur Havers  align=left  1923  80  76  79  76  311  +39  T27 } Source: All past champions in the field made the cut.

Retrieved on 10 September 2008. ==Background== A 16% wage increase for tea plantation workers was agreed to in 2006 through a process of collective bargaining between the KPAWU and employers in the Kenyan tea industry, including UTK. By September 2007, the wage agreement had been implemented by other multinational companies, but not by UTK, which argued that wages in Kenya were already higher than in other tea-producing countries in Africa. The KPAWU announced that it would take legal action against UTK unless the wage increase was implemented by 20 September 2007. ==Strike== The strike began on 8 September 2007 when 10,000 KPAWU members stopped work and brought operations at eighteen plantations to a halt. The action was declared illegal by the district labour officer, but the strike continued.Kelber, H. 2007, '10,000 Kenya tea workers strike plantation' , International Labor Communications Association website, 17 September. Retrieved on 10 September 2008. It is unclear as to the level of support that the strike had within the KPAWU, as the Kericho chairman asked the strikers to return to work while the issue was investigated, while the KPAWU general secretary blamed UTK's actions for the strike. A number of violent incidents occurred during the strike. Striking workers confronted and in some cases assaulted other workers who were not part of the strike. A plantation manager's house was destroyed at one estate, and a truck was set alight at another. On 14 September 2007, UTK announced an 8% wage increase and the strike came to an end. ==References== Category:2007 labor disputes and strikes Category:Labour disputes in Kenya Category:Agriculture in Kenya Category:Kenyan tea Category:Agriculture and forestry strikes ","title":"Kenyan tea workers strike of 2007"},{"id":"19259909","text":"The 1948 Open Championship was the 77th Open Championship, held 30 June to 2 July at Muirfield in Gullane, East Lothian, Scotland.

Over the final two rounds, the lowest round was 70. Cotton carded rounds of 75-72 to set a clubhouse lead of 284 that no one came close to matching. Fred Daly came closest with a 289, five shots behind. Roberto De Vicenzo made his Open Championship debut and finished in third place. Over the next two years he followed with another third and a runner-up finish. He won the title nineteen years later, in 1967. == Past champions in the field == {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  To par  Finish -  align=leftHenry Cotton  align=left  1934, 1937  71  66  75  72  284  E  1 -  align=leftFred Daly  align=left  1947  72  71  73  73  289  +5  2 -  align=leftAlf Padgham  align=left  1936  73  70  71  77  291  +6  T7 -  align=leftDick Burton  align=left  1939  74  70  74  77  295  +11  T18 -  align=leftReg Whitcombe  align=left  1938  77  67  77  74  295  +11  T18 -  align=leftAlf Perry  align=left  1935  77  71  76  73  297  +13  T23 } Source: All past champions in the field made the cut.

Bobby Locke of South Africa won the first of his four Open titles in a 36-hole playoff, twelve strokes ahead of runner-up Harry Bradshaw of Ireland. It was the first playoff at the Open since 1933. This edition was originally scheduled for Royal Cinque Ports, but it was flooded in early 1949 and the venue was switched to Royal St George's. Royal Cinque Ports was retained as a venue for one of the qualifying rounds. Qualifying took place on 4–5 July, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes at Royal St. George's and 18 holes at Royal Cinque Ports. The number of qualifiers was limited to a maximum of 100, and ties for 100th place did not qualify. Bradshaw led the qualifiers scoring 139 with Locke next at 140; the qualifying score was 154 and 96 players advanced. The total prize money was increased fifty percent, from £1,000 to £1,500. The winner received £300 with £200 for second, £100 for third, £75 for fourth, £50 for fifth and then £20 each for the next 35 players. The £1,500 was completed with a £15 prize for winning the qualification event and four £15 prizes for the lowest score in each round. For the first time a silver medal was awarded to the first amateur. In the opening round on Wednesday, Jimmy Adams led with 67. Locke entered as the favorite, but was in a tie for fourth place, despite taking seven at the 14th, cutting his tee shot out of bounds. After the second round on Thursday, Sam King had the lead on 140, Adams dropping back after a 77. At the 5th hole, Bradshaw's ball finished in a broken beer bottle; he decided to play it, getting the ball clear but dropping a shot on the hole. The maximum number of players making the cut after 36 holes was again set at forty, and ties for 40th place did not make the cut. With eleven players tied for 32nd place at 148, the cut was 147 (+3) and a record low 31 players advanced to the final two rounds. After the morning round on Friday, there were three players tied for the lead on 213: Bradshaw, Locke, and Max Faulkner. Charlie Ward and King were just a stroke behind. Bradshaw was in one of the early groups and had a final round of 70 to take the lead on 283. Playing forty minutes later, Locke reached the turn in 32 but took five at the 10th, 14th, and 15th, and then three-putted the short 16th. However he then sank a birdie putt at 17 then from for par at the last to tie Bradshaw. None of the later players in contention could get close to Bradshaw and Locke. De Vicenzo had a good last round of 69 to take third place. His chances were spoilt by an inward half of 40 in the morning which had left his three strokes behind. In the playoff on Saturday, both players started well but Locke had a three-shot lead after thirteen holes. At the 520-yard 14th hole, Locke put his second shot stone dead for a three while Bradshaw found a bunker and eventually took six. Locke's lead was thus extended to six and then to seven at the end of the morning round. The lead quickly extended to 10 after two holes of the afternoon round as Bradshaw started 6-5. Bradshaw gained a shot at the 9th and 11th, but Locke went on to win the playoff by twelve strokes. == Past champions in the field  Made the cut === {   !Player  Country  Year won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  To par  Finish -  align=leftDick Burton  align=left  1939  73  70  74  74  291  +11  T14 } Source: === Missed the cut === {   !Player  Country  Year won  R1  R2  Total  To par -  align=leftReg Whitcombe  align=left  1938  71  77  148  +4 -  align=leftAlf Padgham  align=left  1936  72  77  149  +5 -  align=leftFred Daly  align=left  1947  75  76  151  +7 -  align=leftAlf Perry  align=left  1935  73  79  152  +8 -  align=leftArthur Havers  align=left  1923  77  78  155  +11 } Source: Did not enter: * Henry Cotton (1934, 1937, 1948), Sam Snead (1946), Denny Shute (1933), Gene Sarazen (1932), Tommy Armour (1931). ==Round summariesFirst round=== Wednesday, 6 July 1948 {  !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par -  align=\\"center\\"1  Jimmy Adams   align=\\"center\\"67  align=\\"center\\"–5 -  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"T2  Harry Bradshaw   rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"68  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"–4 -  Roberto De Vicenzo  -  rowspan=7 align=\\"center\\"T6  Ken Adwick   rowspan=7 align=\\"center\\"69  rowspan=7 align=\\"center\\"–3 -  Ken Bousfield  -  John Fallon  -  Bobby Locke  -  Bill Shankland  -  Ernie Southerden  -  Norman Sutton  } Source: ===Second round=== Thursday, 7 July 1949 {  !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par -  align=\\"center\\"1  Sam King   71-69=140  align=\\"center\\"–4 -  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"T2  Max Faulkner   71-71=142  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"–2 -  Bill Shankland   69-73=142 -  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"T4  Dick Burton   73-70=143  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"–1 -  Roberto De Vicenzo   68-75=143 -  rowspan=6 align=\\"center\\"T6  Jimmy Adams   67-77=144  rowspan=6 align=\\"center\\"E -  Johnny Bulla   71-73=144 -  John Fallon   69-75=144 -  Arthur Lees   74-70=144 -  Frank Stranahan (a)   71-73=144 -  Charlie Ward   73-71=144 } Source: ===Third round=== Friday, 8 July 1949 (morning) {  !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par -  align=center rowspan=3T1  Harry Bradshaw   68-77-68=213  rowspan=3 align=\\"center\\"–3 -  Max Faulkner   71-71-71=213 -  Bobby Locke   69-76-68=213 -  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"T4  Sam King   71-69-74=214  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"–2 -  Charlie Ward   73-71-70=214 -  align=\\"center\\"6  Walter Lees   74-72-69=215  align=\\"center\\"–1 -  rowspan=4 align=\\"center\\"T7  Jimmy Adams   67-77-72=216  rowspan=4 align=\\"center\\"E -  Roberto De Vicenzo   68-75-73=216 -  John Fallon   69-75-72=216 -  Arthur Lees   74-70-72=216 } Source: ===Final round=== Friday, 8 July 1949 (afternoon) {  !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par!!Money (£) -  align=center rowspan=2T1  Harry Bradshaw   68-77-68-70=283  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"–5  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"Playoff -  Bobby Locke   69-76-68-70=283 -  align=\\"center\\"3  Roberto De Vicenzo   68-75-73-69=285  align=\\"center\\"–3  align=\\"center\\"100 -  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"T4  Sam King   71-69-74-72=286  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"–2  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"62 ½ -  Charlie Ward   73-71-70-72=286 -  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"T6  Max Faulkner   71-71-71-74=287  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"–1  rowspan=5 align=\\"center\\"20 -  Arthur Lees   74-70-72-71=287 -  rowspan=3 align=\\"center\\"T8  Jimmy Adams   67-77-72-72=288  rowspan=3 align=\\"center\\"E -  John Fallon   69-75-72-72=288 -  Wally Smithers   72-75-70-71=288 } Source: Amateurs: Stranahan (+2), Francis (+19) ===Playoff=== Saturday, 9 July 1949 {  !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par!!Money (£) -  align=center1  Bobby Locke   align=center67-68=135  align=center–9  align=center300 -  align=center2  Harry Bradshaw   align=center74-73=147  align=center+3  align=center200 } Scorecards Morning round {  !Hole!! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6 !! 7 !! 8 !! 9 !!Out!!10!!11!!12!!13!!14!!15!!16!!17!!18!!Back!!Total - align=left Locke443443434334444343443467 - align=left Bradshaw443453534354454643543974 } Afternoon round {  !Hole!! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6 !! 7 !! 8 !! 9 !!Out!!10!!11!!12!!13!!14!!15!!16!!17!!18!!Back!!Total - align=left Locke443443434334444453343568 - align=left Bradshaw653453433364345553443773 } ==References *78th Open - Royal St George's 1949 (Official site) *1949 Open Championship (about.sports) Category:The Open Championship Open Championship Open Championship Category:Golf tournaments in England Category:July 1949 sports events ","title":"1949 Open Championship"},{"id":"19259926","text":"The 1950 Open Championship was the 79th Open Championship, held 5–7 July at Troon Golf Club in Troon, South Ayrshire, Scotland. Defending champion Bobby Locke of South Africa won the second of his four Open titles, two strokes ahead of runner-up Roberto De Vicenzo of Argentina. His total of 279 was a record for the Open Championship, beating the previous best of 283. It was the second Open Championship at Troon, which had previously hosted the Championship in 1923; it became \\"Royal Troon\\" in 1978. Qualifying took place on 3–4 July, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes on the Old Course at Troon and 18 holes on the Lochgreen municipal course. Johnny Bulla led the scoring at 140 with Norman Von Nida next on 141. The field for the Open proper was limited to a maximum of 100 participants and did not include ties. The qualifying score was 153 and 93 players advanced to the first round on Wednesday. Arthur Lees led after the first round with 68, a shot ahead of playing partner Eddie Whitcombe and Locke. Dai Rees was the 36-hole leader at 139, followed by Bill Branch (140) and Locke (141). Lees and Whitcombe both slipped back after Thursday rounds of 76, and Locke scored 72 after a six at the short fifth hole. The maximum number of players making the cut after 36 holes was again set at 40. Ties for 40th place at 149 did not make the cut and only 35 players advanced to the final two rounds. After the third round on Friday morning, Locke, Rees, and De Vicenzo were tied for the lead at 211, Branch dropping back after a 78. In the final round that afternoon, De Vicenzo was out in 33 and at the par-3 8th hole (the \\"Postage Stamp\\"), he put his tee shot into one of its penalizing bunkers. Finding it to be \\"plugged\\" he declared it unplayable and returned to the teeing ground. From there he put his second attempt \\"stone dead\\" and holed the short putt. The rules had recently been changed so that there was no penalty stroke for returning to the tee, and he ended up with a par. Coming home he dropped a shot at the tenth, two more at the twelfth and another at the thirteenth, but a good finish gave him a 70 and the clubhouse lead on 281. Locke was also out in 33 and finished with a round of 68 to lead De Vicenzo by two. Rees was the remaining challenger for the championship and he too was out in 33. However, he had a six at the tenth hole and finished with 71 to tie for third place. On a day of low scoring, Eric Moore was out in 32 and finished with 68; Fred Daly and Frank Stranahan both scored 66. ==Course== Old Course {class= !Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par!! !!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par - align=center1Sealalign=center355align=center4rowspan=10 align=center10Sandhillsalign=center436align=center4 - align=center2Black Rockalign=center372align=center4align=center11The Railwayalign=center326align=center4 - align=center3Gyawsalign=center378align=center4align=center12The Foxalign=center385align=center4 - align=center4Dunurealign=center443align=center4align=center13Burmahalign=center400align=center4 - align=center5Greenanalign=center180align=center3align=center14Altonalign=center170align=center3 - align=center6Turnberryalign=center580align=center5align=center15Crosbiealign=center450align=center4 - align=center7Tel-el- Kebiralign=center368align=center4align=center16Wellalign=center566align=center5 - align=center8Postage Stampalign=center120align=center3align=center17Rabbitalign=center223align=center3 - align=center9The Monkalign=center427align=center4align=center18Craigendalign=center410align=center4 -  colspan=2 align=centerOutalign=center3,217align=center35 colspan=2 align=centerInalign=center3,366align=center35 - colspan=5Source: colspan=2 align=centerTotalalign=center6,583align=center70 } Opens from 1962 through 1989 played the 11th hole as a par-5;

The number of qualifiers was limited to a maximum of 100, and ties for 100th place did not qualify. Cerdá led at 138 with Tom Haliburton, Bobby Locke, and Norman Von Nida a stroke behind. The qualifying score was 155 and Peter Alliss qualified comfortably, following up a first round 76 at Portstewart with an impressive 69 Jimmy Adams and Von Nida shared the lead after the first round on Wednesday with 68, the only rounds in the championship. In the second round on Thursday, Faulkner shot 70 to take a two- stroke lead over Norman Sutton, with Fred Daly, and Harry Weetman a further shot behind. After his 69 in qualifying, Alliss scored 79 and 80 and missed the cut. In the third round on Friday morning, Faulkner posted another 70 and stretched the 54-hole lead to six over Sutton and Cerdá. In the final round that afternoon, Faulkner finished 5-5-4-5 for 74 and 285. Cerdá was the only player still on the course with a chance to tie. Going out in 34, he reached the 16th needing to play the last three holes in twelve shots. His challenge ended when his drive ended up against some steps straddling a barbed wire fence and he took six. He finished on 287, two shots behind Faulkner. Faulkner was the last Englishman to win the Open for 18 years, until Tony Jacklin in 1969. Frank Stranahan tied for twelfth and was the low amateur for the third straight year, one of two Americans to make the cut. Two Australians made their Open Championship debuts: future five-time champion Peter Thomson, age 21, finished in sixth place, while 1960 champion Kel Nagle was 19th. The PGA Championship at Oakmont near Pittsburgh concluded on Tuesday, 3 July. This was the second day of the Open Championship qualification, making it impossible to play in the final two majors and resulted in very few Americans in the field. Sam Snead, the Open champion in 1946, won the final match at Oakmont for his third title in that championship. == Past champions in the field  Made the cut === {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  To par  Finish -  align=leftFred Daly  align=left  1947  74  70  75  73  292  +4  T4 -  align=leftBobby Locke  align=left South Africa  1949, 1950  71  74  74  74  293  +5  T6 -  align=leftDick Burton  align=left  1939  74  77  71  73  295  +7  T12 } === Missed the cut === {   !Player  Country  Year won  R1  R2  Total  To par -  align=leftAlf Padgham  align=left  1936  81  74  155  +11 -  align=leftReg Whitcombe  align=left  1938  82  80  162  +18 } Source: * Henry Cotton (1934, 1937, 1948) did not enter * Sam Snead (1946) won his third PGA Championship in the United States on 3 July ==Round summariesFirst round=== Wednesday, 4 July 1951 {class= !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par - rowspan=2 align=centerT1  Jimmy Adams   rowspan=2 align=center68  rowspan=2 align=center–4 - Norman Von Nida  - rowspan=2 align=centerT3  Dai Rees   rowspan=2 align=center70  rowspan=2 align=center–2 - Peter Thomson  - rowspan=2 align=centerT5  Max Faulkner   rowspan=2 align=center71  rowspan=2 align=center–1 - Bobby Locke  - align=center7  Flory Van Donck   align=center72  align=centerE - rowspan=8 align=centerT8  Alfonso Angelini   rowspan=8 align=center73  rowspan=8 align=center+1 - Eric Cremin  - Ugo Grappasonni  - Jack Hargreaves  - John Panton  - Bill Shankland  - Norman Sutton  - Harry Weetman  } Source: ===Second round=== Thursday, 5 July 1951 {class= !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par - align=center1  Max Faulkner   71-70=141  align=center–3 - align=center2  Norman Sutton   73-70=143  align=center–1 - rowspan=2 align=centerT3  Fred Daly   74-70=144  rowspan=2 align=centerE - Harry Weetman   73-71=144 - rowspan=5 align=centerT5  Jimmy Adams   68-77=145  rowspan=5 align=center+1 - Bobby Locke   71-74=145 - John Panton   73-72=145 - Peter Thomson   70-75=145 - Norman Von Nida   68-77=145 - rowspan=2 align=centerT10  Antonio Cerdá   74-72=146  rowspan=2 align=center+2 - Ugo Grappasonni   73-73=146 } Source: ===Third round=== Friday, 6 July 1951 (morning) {class= !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par - align=center1  Max Faulkner   71-70-70=211  align=center–5 - rowspan=2 align=centerT2  Antonio Cerdá   74-72-71=217  rowspan=2 align=center+1 - Norman Sutton   73-70-74=217 - align=center4  Peter Thomson   70-75-73=218  align=center+2 - rowspan=4 align=centerT5  Fred Daly   74-70-75=219  rowspan=4 align=center+4 - Bobby Locke   71-74-74=219 - John Panton   73-72-74=219 - Harry Weetman   73-71-75=219 - align=center9  Jimmy Adams   68-77-75=220  align=center+4 - align=center10  Bill Shankland   73-76-72=221  align=center+5 } Source: ===Final round=== Friday, 6 July 1951 (afternoon) {class= !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par!!Money (£) - align=center1  Max Faulkner   71-70-70-74=285  align=center–3  align=center300 - align=center2  Antonio Cerdá   74-72-71-70=287  align=center–1  align=center200 - align=center3  Charlie Ward   75-73-74-68=290  align=center+2  align=center100 - rowspan=2 align=centerT4  Jimmy Adams   68-77-75-72=292  rowspan=2 align=center+4  rowspan=2 align=center62 ½ - Fred Daly   74-70-75-73=292 - rowspan=5 align=centerT6  Bobby Locke   71-74-74-74=293  rowspan=5 align=center+5  rowspan=5 align=center20 - Bill Shankland   73-76-72-72=293 - Norman Sutton   73-70-74-76=293 - Peter Thomson   70-75-73-75=293 - Harry Weetman   73-71-75-74=293 } Source: ==References *80th Open - Royal Portrush 1951 (Official site) *1951 Open Championship (about.sports) Category:The Open Championship Open Championship Open Championship Open Championship Category:Portrush Category:Golf tournaments in Northern Ireland Category:July 1951 sports events ","title":"1951 Open Championship"},{"id":"19259944","text":"The 1952 Open Championship was the 81st Open Championship, held 9–11 July at Royal Lytham & St Annes Golf Club in Lytham St Annes, England. This was the second Open at the course, its first was 26 years earlier in 1926. Bobby Locke won the third of his four Claret Jugs at 287 (−1), one stroke ahead of runner- up Peter Thomson. This was the first of seven consecutive Opens in which Thomson, age 22, finished as champion or runner-up. Fred Daly, 1947 champion, led after each of the first three rounds, but concluded with 153 (+9) on the final day and finished third. For qualifying, 274 players entered compared to the 148 the previous year in Northern Ireland. Through an error, the initial entry did not include Antonio Cerdá, the prior year's runner-up. The Championship committee used its discretion to allow him a late entry. Qualifying took place on 7–8 July, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes at Royal Lytham & St Annes and 18 holes at adjacent Fairhaven. The number of qualifiers was limited to a maximum of 100, and ties for 100th place were not included. John Panton led at 134 with Harry Bradshaw next on 136. The qualifying score was 152 and 96 players Three former champions did not continue: Reg Whitcombe (1938) 154, Alf Padgham (1936) 155, and Dick Burton (1939) 156. The opening round on Wednesday had the lowest scoring, as Daly took the lead at 67, followed by Thomson (68), and Locke in third at Daly widened his lead in the second round on Thursday with 69 for 136. Locke was four behind at 140, with Thomson a stroke behind in third. English amateur Jackie Jones was tied for fourth place, seven shots behind Daly. The maximum number of players making the cut after 36 holes remained at fifty, and ties for 50th place did not make the cut. The cut was at 151 (+7), and 46 players advanced. Stronger winds arrived on Friday morning for the third round, but Daly still led with 213 after a 77. Locke had closed to one shot after a 74 and Thomson was four behind Locke at 218 (+2), despite going out of bounds at the second hole. Harry Bradshaw and Sam King came next on 219. Starting an hour before Daly, Locke began the final round that afternoon 3-4-3 and reached the turn in 34. Daly was out in 37 and a victory for Locke seemed likely. However he finished with two fives and Daly still had a chance to catch him, but Daly took a six at the 15th; despite finishing 3-4-4, he ended up two shots behind. Thomson seemed to be out of contention after going out in 36, six shots behind Locke at the same stage. However, he came home in 34 with a birdie three at the last to take second place from Daly, one stroke behind Locke. Henry Cotton had the best score on the final day (74-71=145), but had been thirteen behind Daly at 149 after the first two rounds and finished fourth. Jones partnered Locke on the final day and, despite rounds of 78 and 83, held onto the position of leading amateur, winning the silver medal. Only five Americans were in the field; the top finisher was Willie Goggin, in his first Open Championship at age 46, in a six-way tie for ninth. the 1932 champion, tied for seventeenth at age 50. == Past champions in the field  Made the cut === {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  To par  Finish -  align=leftBobby Locke  align=left South Africa  1949, 1950  69  71  74  73  287  −1  1 -  align=leftFred Daly  align=left  1947  67  69  77  76  289  +1  3 -  align=leftHenry Cotton  align=left  1934, 1937, 1948  75  74  74  71  294  +6  4 -  align=leftMax Faulkner  align=left  1951  72  76  79  73  300  +12  T17 -  align=leftGene Sarazen  align=left  1932  74  73  77  76  300  +12  T17 } Source: === Missed the cut === {   !Player  Country  Year won  R1  R2  Total  To par -  align=leftAlf Perry  align=left  1935  76  76  152  +8 } Source: Did not advance past qualifying rounds (Monday & Tuesday): *Dick Burton (1939) 156, Reg Whitcombe (1938) 154, Alf Padgham (1936) 155.

In his only Open Championship appearance, Ben Hogan prevailed by four strokes over four runners-up to win his third major championship of the year. The total prize money was increased by nearly fifty percent, from £1,700 to £2,500. The winner received £500, with £300 for second, £200 for third, £100 for fourth, £75 for fifth, £30 for next 20, and then £25 each for the remaining players. There was also a £15 prize for winning the qualification event and four £15 prizes for the lowest score in each round. The purse of £2,500 ($7,000) and the winner's share of £500 ($1,400), were less than one-third that of the U.S. Open or PGA Championship in 1953. Qualifying took place on 6–7 July, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes each on the Championship and Burnside courses. The number of qualifiers was limited to a maximum of 100, and ties for 100th place would not qualify. On Monday, John Panton led the qualifiers on the Championship course after a 69 while Bobby Locke scored 65 on the Burnside course. Locke's scored 71 on the second day and a total of 136 put him five shots ahead of the rest. Panton and Christy O'Connor were next on 141, and Hogan qualified comfortably on 145. Peter Thomson, the 1952 runner-up, only just qualified on 154 after taking 80 on the Championship course. The qualifying score was 154 and 91 players advanced. Hogan, with the Masters and U.S. Open titles, made the trip across the Atlantic for the Open Championship for the only time in his career. He arrived at Carnoustie two weeks early to practice with the smaller British golf ball. The policy of requiring all players to qualify, the small purse, the lengthy ocean voyage, and the conflict of schedule with the PGA Championship kept all but a few Americans at home; only four qualified for the first round on Wednesday, and three made the 36-hole cut to play the final two rounds on Friday. A maximum of 50 players could make the cut after 36 holes, and ties for 50th place were not included; it was at 154 (+10) and 49 advanced to the final two rounds. Although the field of 91 that qualified was mostly British, a strong international contingent stood ready to challenge Hogan, including fellow Americans Lloyd Mangrum and Frank Stranahan, Thomson of Australia, Antonio Cerdá and Roberto De Vicenzo of Argentina, and Locke of South Africa, the defending champion. The Open Championship was Hogan's third major title of the year, but the modern Grand Slam was not possible, as the PGA Championship conflicted with the Open in 1953; the final match (36 holes) of the seven-day PGA Championship was played near Detroit on Tuesday, 7 July. After his automobile accident in 1949, Hogan did not enter the PGA Championship until 1960, after it became a stroke play event. He had won the PGA Championship in 1946 and 1948 before the accident. Hogan did not play in another Open Championship, although he did make a lasting impression on Carnoustie. The par-5 6th hole features a split fairway, with the right side being safer but the left offering a better angle to the green. Hogan found the narrow left side in each of the four rounds, and that hole is now known as \\"Hogan's Alley.\\" Hogan remains the only player to win the Masters, U.S. Open, and Open Championship in the same calendar year. After winning the first two majors of the year, Arnold Palmer (1960) and Jack Nicklaus (1972) were runners-up by a stroke. Tiger Woods won the Masters and U.S. Open in 2002, but shot 81-65 on the weekend to finish six strokes back at Muirfield, tied for 28th place. At St. Andrews in 2015, Jordan Spieth bogeyed the 71st hole (Road) and missed a three-man playoff by one stroke. After the win, Hogan and his wife Valerie were passengers on the SS United States westbound to New York City, where he received a ticker tape parade down Broadway on July 21. ==Course== Championship Course { class=  - !Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par!! !!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par - 1align=leftCup4064rowspan=10 10align=leftSouth America4464 - 2align=leftGulley442411align=leftDyke3684 - 3align=leftJockie's Burn346412align=leftSouthward Ho4674 - 4align=leftHillocks430413align=leftWhins1693 - 5align=leftBrae3884 14align=leftSpectacles4735 - 6align=leftLong ^5675 15align=leftLucky Slap4574 - 7align=leftPlantation3894 16align=leftBarry Burn2503 - 8align=leftShort1623 17align=leftIsland4544 - 9align=leftRailway483418align=leftHome5035 -  colspan=2 align=centerOutalign=center3,613align=center36 colspan=2 align=centerInalign=center3,587align=center36 - align=left colspan=5Source: colspan=2 align=centerTotalalign=center7,200align=center72 } ^ The 6th hole was renamed Hogan's Alley in 2003 == Past champions in the field  Made the cut === {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  To par  Finish -  align=leftBobby Locke  align=left South Africa  1949, 1950, 1952  72  73  74  72  291 +3 8 -  align=leftFred Daly  align=left  1947  73  75  71  75  294  +6  11 -  align=leftMax Faulkner  align=left  1951  74  71  73  77  295  +7  12 -  align=leftDick Burton  align=left  1939  80  74  80  80  314  +26  T47 } Source: === Missed the cut === {   !Player  Country  Year won  R1  R2  Total  To par -  align=leftAlf Padgham  align=left  1936  77  80  157  +13 } Source: Did not enter: * Henry Cotton (1934, 1937, 1948), Sam Snead (1946), Reg Whitcombe (1938), Alf Perry (1935), Denny Shute (1933), Gene Sarazen (1932). == Round summaries  First round === Wednesday, 8 July 1953 Stranahan set the early pace with a first round of 70, with Eric Brown in 2nd with a 71.

He played rugby league in 1925-26 with the St Paul's club in Ipswich, achieving representative honours for Queensland in 1925. His first representative rugby union appearances were on the 1927-28 Waratahs tour of Britain, France and Canada for which Malcolm was one of three half-backs selected along with Wally Meagher and Jack Duncan from Randwick. Meagher started as the preferred Test half and when Malcolm dislocated his shoulder in the match against Oxford University not yet half-way into the tour it looked as though he would have disappointing memories of the trip. He was side-lined for many matches (ultimately only playing in 11 of the 31 official tour matches) but his capabilities had been noticed. After his shoulder recovery he was selected in the final three Tests against Scotland, England and France. He finished the tour as Australia's number one half-back and returned to Newcastle a hero, but keen to relocate to Sydney to play club rugby there. ==Playing style== Malcolm provided quick service from the scrum base with a fast but not particularly long pass. He was quick to spot and exploit an opening but was most respected for his courage and determination when the going got tough. The Howell reference describes him as \\"courage personified\\".HowellWallaby Test Captains p 97 ==Representative career== Malcolm, last in line to meet the Duke of York before his 2nd Test appearance Twickenham, 7 Jan 1928 Bledisloe Wallabies, 1st Test v NZ 11Aug1934 When the Waratahs toured New Zealand in 1928 Malcolm was named as captain. The team was full of new blood with only Cyril Towers and Geoff Bland continuing on for the 1927 World Tour squad. Syd Malcolm played in seven of the ten matches; five in total were won and five lost. In 1929 the All Blacks toured Australia, Tom Lawton took over as captain but Syd Malcolm was in the side which won all three Tests in an upset. With the Queensland Rugby Union now back in existence for the first time since 1919 this was the first truly national Wallabies side fielded since 1914 and the first time in history any nation had beaten the All Blacks in a 3-0 series whitewash. Great Britain toured Australia in 1930 and Malcolm played in two tests and twice against them for New South Wales. Then in 1931 a full Australian side was sent to New Zealand. Syd Malcolm was the captain and part of the senior playing group with Cyril Towers and Alex Ross from the 1927 side. They won three, drew one and lost six matches including the single Test. In 1932 Malcolm again met the All Blacks in three Test appearances when they came to Australia - he was captain in one of those encounters but also captained New South Wales against them. In 1933, Malcolm was in the squad that made Australia's first ever rugby tour of South Africa. He made eleven appearances including two Tests, one as captain. Syd Malcolm made his final international appearances against New Zealand in 1934, finishing his representative career after eight years and forty five internationals including eighteen Tests. ==ReferencesSources=== * Collection (1995) Gordon Bray presents The Spirit of Rugby, Harper Collins Publishers Sydney * Howell, Max (2005) Born to Lead - Wallaby Test Captains, Celebrity Books, Auckland NZ *Queensland representatives at qrl.com.au *Syd Malcolm at espnscrum ===Footnotes=== Category:1902 births Category:Australian rugby league players Category:Queensland rugby league team players Category:Australian rugby union players Category:Australia international rugby union players Category:Australian rugby union captains Category:1987 deaths Category:Australian boilermakers ","title":"Syd Malcolm"},{"id":"19259961","text":"The 1954 Open Championship was the 90th Open Championship, played 7–9 July at Royal Birkdale Golf Club in Southport, England. Peter Thomson, age 23, won the first of his five Open titles by one stroke over runners-up Bobby Locke, Dai Rees, and Syd Scott. This was the first time the championship was held at Royal Birkdale. The total prize money was increased forty percent, from £2,500 to £3,500. The winner received £750 with £500 for second, £350 for third, £200 for fourth, £150 for fifth, £100 for sixth, £75 for seventh and eighth, £50 for ninth and tenth, £30 for next 15 places and then £25 each for the next 25 players. The £3,500 was completed with a £25 prize for winning the qualification event and four £25 prizes for the lowest score in each round. Qualifying took place on 5–6 July, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes on the Championship course and 18 holes at Hillside Golf Club. The number of qualifiers was limited to a maximum of 100, and ties for 100th place would not qualify. On Monday, John McGonigle set a new course record of 65 on the Hillside course. Norman Von Nida led the qualifiers on 137, four ahead of the rest. and McGonigle shot 80 at Royal Birkdale for 145; the qualifying score was 151 and 97 players advanced. After a long voyage from America, Toney Penna and Jim Turnesa were amongst the group of sixteen on 151 who narrowly qualified. Sam King and Bill Spence established a new course record at 69 in the opening round on Wednesday. It lasted just one day as Syd Scott bettered it in on Thursday with a 67, but Spence retained the lead after 36 holes at 141, one ahead of Antonio Cerdá, with Scott, Dai Rees, Thomson, and King one stroke back in a tie for third. A maximum of 50 players could make the cut after 36 holes, but ties for 50th place were not included. It was at 151 (+5) and fifty players advanced to the final two rounds. Scott continued his hot play in the third round, scoring a 69. Thomson and Rees also carded 69 and joined him at the top of the leaderboard going into the final round. Scott shot a 72 over the last 18-holes, posting a clubhouse lead of 284. Rees also posted 284 after missing a putt at the 18th. Thomson missed a short putt at the 12th, but managed to get up-and-down from a bunker at 16. He went to the 17th needing a par and a bogey on his last two holes to become the new clubhouse leader. He got the par, but at 18 he found trouble in a bunker. He again managed a superb recovery, and while he missed his first putt he easily tapped in for a round of 71 and a 283 total. Bobby Locke had a chance to tie Thomson with a 3 at the last, but his birdie putt came up just short making Thomson the winner of the championship. This win was the first in a run of three consecutive Open Championship titles by Thomson, becoming the first player since Bob Ferguson from 1880-82 to win three straight Opens. Altogether he would win three of the next four Opens and add another win in 1965, which was also held at Royal Birkdale. Thomson was the first Australian to win the Open Championship, and the youngest champion since Bobby Jones. Three-time Masters champion Jimmy Demaret made his only Open Championship appearance this year and tied for tenth place. Defending champion Ben Hogan did not compete; his victory in 1953 at Carnoustie was his only Open Championship. == Past champions in the field Made the cut=== {  style=\\"text- align:center\\" !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  To par  Finish -  align=leftBobby Locke  align=left 1949, 1950, 1952  74  71  69  70  284  −8  T2 -  align=leftGene Sarazen  align=left  1932  75  74  73  70  292  E  T17 -  align=leftMax Faulkner  align=left  1951  73  78  69  73  293  +1  T20 -  align=leftFred Daly  align=left  1947  74  72  74  77  297  +5  T35 } Source: ===Missed the cut=== {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  Total  To par -  align=leftAlf Padgham  align=left  1936  75  77  152  +6 -  align=leftHenry Cotton  align=left  1934, 1937, 1948  77  76  153  +7 } Source: Did not advance past qualifying rounds (Monday & Tuesday): * Reg Whitcombe (1938) 153, Alf Perry (1935) 154.

Prize money was unchanged with £1,000 for the winner out of a total purse of £3,750. == Past champions in the field Made the cut=== {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  To par  Finish -  align=leftPeter Thomson  align=left  1954, 1955  70  70  72  74  286  +2  1 -  align=leftHenry Cotton  align=left  1934, 1937, 1948  72  76  71  74  293  +9  T6 -  align=leftGene Sarazen  align=left  1932  78  74  WD     } ===Missed the cut=== {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  Total  To par -  align=leftBobby Locke  align=left 1949, 1950, 1952  76  79  155  +13 -  align=leftFred Daly  align=left  1947  77  81  158  +16 -  align=leftDick Burton  align=left  1939  83  79  162  +20 } ==Round summariesFirst round=== Wednesday, 4 July 1956 {  !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par - align=center1Dennis Smalldonalign=center68align=center–3 - align=center2Enrique Bertolinoalign=center69align=center–2 - rowspan=\\"4\\" align=centerT3Al Baldingrowspan=\\"4\\" align=center70rowspan=\\"4\\" align=center–1 - Eric Lester - Dave Thomas - Peter Thomson - rowspan=\\"5\\" align=centerT7Carlos Cellesrowspan=\\"5\\" align=center71rowspan=\\"5\\" align=centerE - Roberto De Vicenzo - Ángel Miguel - Gary Player - Flory Van Donck } ===Second round=== Thursday, 5 July 1956 {  !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par - align=center1Peter Thomsonalign=center 70-70=140align=center–2 - rowspan=\\"2\\" align=centerT2Enrique Bertolinoalign=center 69-72=141rowspan=\\"2\\" align=center–1 - Roberto De Vicenzoalign=center 71-70=141 - rowspan=\\"2\\" align=centerT4Ángel Miguelalign=center 71-74=145rowspan=\\"2\\" align=center+3 - Flory Van Donckalign=center 71-74=145 - align=center6Eric Lesteralign=center 70-76=146align=center+4 - rowspan=\\"2\\" align=centerT7Gary Playeralign=center 71-76=147rowspan=\\"2\\" align=center+5 - Dennis Smalldonalign=center 68-79=147 - rowspan=\\"7\\" align=centerT9Henry Cottonalign=center 72-76=148rowspan=\\"7\\" align=center+6 - Bernard Huntalign=center 75-73=148 - Mike Souchakalign=center 74-74=148 - Frank Stranahanalign=center 72-76=148 - Dave Thomasalign=center 70-78=148 - Charlie Wardalign=center 73-75=148 - Harry Weetmanalign=center 72-76=148 } Amateurs: Carr (+8), Sharp (+12), Jones (+12), Tate (+14), Shepperson (+17), Thirlwell (+18), Fogarty (+21). ===Third round=== Friday, 6 July 1956 - (morning) {  !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par - align=center1Peter Thomsonalign=center 70-70-72=212align=center–1 - align=center2Flory Van Donckalign=center 71-74-70=215align=center+2 - align=center3Enrique Bertolinoalign=center 69-72-76=217align=center+4 - align=center4Henry Cottonalign=center 72-76-71=219align=center+6 - rowspan=\\"4\\" align=centerT5Roberto De Vicenzoalign=center 71-70-79=220rowspan=\\"4\\" align=center+7 - Ángel Miguelalign=center 71-74-75=220 - Gary Playeralign=center 71-76-73=220 - Frank Stranahanalign=center 72-76-72=220 - align=center9Antonio Cerdáalign=center 72-81-68=221align=center+8 - rowspan=\\"2\\" align=centerT10John Pantonalign=center 74-76-72=222rowspan=\\"2\\" align=center+9 - Mike Souchakalign=center74-74-74=222 } ===Final round=== Friday, 6 July 1956 - (afternoon) {  !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par!!Money (£) -  align=\\"center\\"1  Peter Thomson   70-70-72-74=286  align=\\"center\\"+2  align=\\"center\\"1,000 -  align=\\"center\\"2  Flory Van Donck   71-74-70-74=289  align=\\"center\\"+5  align=\\"center\\"500 -  align=\\"center\\"3  Roberto De Vicenzo   71-70-79-70=290  align=\\"center\\"+6  align=\\"center\\"350 -  align=\\"center\\"4  Gary Player   71-76-73-71=291  align=\\"center\\"+7  align=\\"center\\"200 -  align=\\"center\\"5  John Panton   74-76-72-70=292  align=\\"center\\"+8  align=\\"center\\"150 -  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"T6  Enrique Bertolino   69-72-76-76=293  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"+9  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"87 -  Henry Cotton   72-76-71-74=293 -  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"T8  Antonio Cerdá   72-81-68-73=294  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"+10  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"62 -  Mike Souchak   74-74-74-72=294 -  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"T10  Christy O'Connor Snr   73-78-74-70=295  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"+11  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"40 -  Harry Weetman   72-76-75-72=295 } Amateur: Carr (+22). ==References *85th Open - Royal Liverpool 1956 (Official site) *1956 Open Championship (about.sports) Category:The Open Championship Category:Golf tournaments in England Category:Sport in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral Open Championship Open Championship Open Championship ","title":"1956 Open Championship"},{"id":"19259975","text":"The Health and Social Care Act 2008 (c 14) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

Bobby Locke, age 39, won his fourth and final Open title, three strokes ahead of runner-up Peter Thomson, who had won the three previous Opens. The Open, last played at the Old Course just two years prior, was originally scheduled for Muirfield, but the \\"Suez Crisis\\" in Egypt in late 1956 led to serious fuel shortages in Britain and rationing of petrol. In early 1957, the R&A; decided that St Andrews, on a railway line, would be an easier place for players and spectators to get to than Muirfield, and so it was moved. Petrol rationing ended in May 1957 but it was then too late to switch back to the original venue and Muirfield was allocated the 1959 edition. Qualifying took place on 1–2 July, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes on the Old Course and 18 holes on the New Course. With an entry of 295, compared to the record 360 entries the previous year, qualifying was in pairs rather than the three-balls used in 1956. The number of qualifiers was limited to a maximum of 100, and ties for 100th place were not included. Bernard Hunt and Bobby Locke led the qualifiers at 137; the qualifying score was 149 and 96 players advanced to the opening round on Wednesday. There were fifteen American entries, many of them amateurs, but only four qualified for the field of 96: professionals and Frank Stranahan finished in the top twenty and the two amateurs missed the cut. During the first round on Wednesday, competitors playing behind Middlecoff demonstratively complained of his slow play. They officially protested to the R&A;, which sided with Middlecoff, who had completed his 18-hole round with Antonio Cerdá in three hours and 18 minutes. The maximum number of players making the cut after 36 holes was set at fifty, and ties for 50th place were not included. This was the first Open Championship in which the leaders after 36 holes went off last for the final 36 holes. Previously a random draw had been used. Flory Van Donck and Eric Brown, the leading two players after 36 holes were paired together in the final group for the final two rounds. A mini-controversy surrounded the ending of the championship. Lying two, Bobby Locke was only from the cup on the 72nd hole when he moved his ball marker one putter-head length to avoid the line of fellow competitor Bruce Crampton's putt. After Crampton holed out, Locke forgot to replace his ball to its original position and sank his putt. Only much later were officials made aware of Locke's mistake; the Championship Committee decreed that no advantage had been gained and that the result, and Locke's three-stroke victory, stood. ==Card of the course== {class= !Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par!! !!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par -

Peter Thomson won his fourth Claret Jug in five years in a 36-hole Saturday playoff, four strokes ahead of Dave Thomas. It was the first playoff at the Open since 1949 and the seventh consecutive year that Thomson, 28, finished either as champion or runner-up. The 278 scored by Thomas and Thomson was a record low for the Open. Qualifying took place on 30 June–1 July. Entries played 18 holes at Royal Lytham & St Annes and 18 holes at Fairhaven. With over 300 entries qualifying was played in three-balls, as had also been the case in 1956. The number of qualifiers was limited to a maximum of 100. Ties for 100th place would not qualify. The qualifying score was 148 and 96 players qualified. Peter Thomson led the qualifiers on 133 after scoring 63 on the Championship course in his first qualifying round. His total of 133 was a record for qualifying, surpassing the 134 scored by Bobby Jones in 1926 and by John Panton in 1952. Ken Bousfield, one of the successes of the British 1957 Ryder Cup team and the American Frank Stranahan were amongst those who scored 149 and failed to qualify. Stranahan was suffering from a back muscle strain and took 81 in his second qualifying round. The total prize money was increased from £3,750 to £4,850. The winner's prize remained unchanged at £1,000 but the prizes for second to tenth place were increased. Second place received £650 with £500 for third, £350 for fourth, £300 for fifth, £250 for sixth, £200 for seventh, £150 for eighth, £125 for ninth and £100 for tenth. The prizes of £30 for the next 15 places and then £25 each for the next 25 players were unchanged. The prize for winning the qualification event was increased to £50 while the four £25 prizes for the lowest score in each round were also unchanged. The maximum number of players making the cut after 36 holes was set at 50. Ties for 50th place did not make the cut. Just 40 players qualified for the final two rounds by scoring 147 or better. 10 players had scored 148 but that number became 11 when they were joined by Peter Mills after he holed a short putt at the 18th, the last shot of the day. He himself missed the cut but by holing the putt he also eliminated the other 10, who would have qualified had he missed it. Eric Brown moved into contention after a third round 65, coming home in 30. In the tournament's final round, playing almost an hour before the leaders, he had 2s at the 9th and 12th holes in the afternoon but at the last he drove into a bunker and then 3-putted for a 6, finishing on 279. Thomas and Thomson, in the second to last group, both needed 4 to beat Brown. Thomas two putted from 12 yards for his 4 but Thomson had a 10 foot putt for a 3. His putt just missed and he tied with Thomas on 278. The final group included the overnight leader Christy O'Connor and Leopoldo Ruiz. They both reached the 18th needing a 4 to join Thomas and Thomson. However, unlike the previous group, they both drove into bunkers. Ruiz took two to get out of the bunker and his chance was gone. O'Connor's third from 100 yards shaved the hole but he was left with a 16 foot putt to tie the leaders. The putt grazed the hole and finished 4 inches past. Ruiz eventually took 7 to finish three behind. In the playoff on Saturday, Thomson was four up after seven holes but Thomas had reduced the lead to one at lunch. Thomson gained another stroke on the first hole of the afternoon round but Thomas picked up a stroke on each of the next two holes to tie the scores. The scores were still level after 7 holes but at the 8th Thomson holed from 8 feet while Thomas missed a shorter one. Thomson got a birdie 3 at the 10th where Thomas again missed a putt taking 5. Thomas then took 5 at the 11th to give Thomson a four shot lead which he held to the end. Only two Americans were in the field of 96: Gene Sarazen, the 1932 champion, finished ten strokes back at age 56, in a tie for 16th place. Monte Bradley, a 27-year-old Army private from Texas, shot 154 and missed the cut by seven strokes. == Past champions in the field == {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  To par  Finish -  align=leftPeter Thomson  align=left  1954, 1955, 1956  66  72  67  73  278  –6  1 -  align=leftHenry Cotton  align=left  1934, 1937, 1948  68  75  69  72  284  E  T8 -  align=leftMax Faulkner  align=left  1951  68  71  71  78  288  +4  T16 -  align=leftBobby Locke  align=left 1949, 1950, 1952, 1957  76  70  72 70  288  +4  T16 -  align=leftGene Sarazen  align=left  1932  73  73  70  72  288  +4  T16 -  align=leftFred Daly  align=left  1947  71  74  72  73  290  +6  T20 } ==Round summariesFirst round=== Wednesday, 2 July 1958 {  !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par - align=center1Peter Thomsonalign=center66align=center–5 - align=center2Christy O'Connor Snralign=center67align=center–4 - rowspan=\\"3\\" align=centerT3Henry Cottonrowspan=\\"3\\" align=center68rowspan=\\"3\\" align=center–3 - Max Faulkner - Gary Player - rowspan=\\"3\\" align=centerT6Tony Cooprowspan=\\"3\\" align=center69rowspan=\\"3\\" align=center–2 - Norman Drew - Jean Garaïalde - rowspan=\\"7\\" align=centerT9Harry Bradshawrowspan=\\"7\\" align=center 70rowspan=\\"7\\" align=center–1 - Joe Carr (a)  - Harold Henning - Bernard Hunt - Bill Large - Dave Thomas - Flory Van Donck } ===Second round=== Thursday, 3 July 1958 {  !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par - align=center1Christy O'Connor Snralign=center 67-68=135align=center–7 - align=center2Leopoldo Ruizalign=center 71-65=136align=center–6 - rowspan=\\"2\\" align=centerT3Dave Thomasalign=center 70-68=138rowspan=\\"2\\" align=center–4 - Peter Thomsonalign=center 66-72=138 - rowspan=\\"2\\" align=centerT5Max Faulkneralign=center 68-71=139rowspan=\\"2\\" align=center–3 - Eric Lesteralign=center 73-66=139 - rowspan=\\"4\\" align=centerT7Tony Coopalign=center 69-71=140rowspan=\\"4\\" align=center–2 - Bernard Huntalign=center 70-70=140 - Flory Van Donckalign=center 70-70=140 - Harry Weetmanalign=center 73-67=140 } Amateurs: Carr (+2), Charles (+8), Deighton (+8), Scrutton (+9), Perowne (+10), Fox (+10), Randall (+12), Byrne (+14), Slater (+20). ===Third round=== Friday, 4 July 1958 - (morning) {  !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par - align=center1Peter Thomsonalign=center 66-72-67=205align=center–8 - rowspan=\\"2\\" align=centerT2Dave Thomasalign=center 70-68-69=207rowspan=\\"2\\" align=center–6 - Flory Van Donckalign=center 70-70-67=207 - rowspan=\\"3\\" align=centerT4Eric Brownalign=center 73-70-65=208rowspan=\\"3\\" align=center–5 - Christy O'Connor Snralign=center 67-68-73=208 - Leopoldo Ruizalign=center 71-65-72=208 - rowspan=\\"2\\" align=centerT7Max Faulkneralign=center 68-71-71=210rowspan=\\"2\\" align=center–3 - Eric Lesteralign=center 73-66-71=210 - rowspan=\\"3\\" align=centerT9Peter Allissalign=center 72-70-70=212rowspan=\\"3\\" align=center–1 - Henry Cottonalign=center68-75-69=212 - Gary Playeralign=center68-74-70=212 } ===Final round=== Friday, 4 July 1958 - (afternoon) {  !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par!!Money (£) -  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"T1  Dave Thomas   70-68-69-71=278  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"–6rowspan=2 align=centerPlayoff -  Peter Thomson   66-72-67-73=278 -  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"T3  Eric Brown   73-70-65-71=279  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"–5rowspan=2 align=center425 -  Christy O'Connor Snr   67-68-73-71=279 -  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"T5  Leopoldo Ruiz   71-65-72-73=281  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"–3rowspan=2 align=center275 -  Flory Van Donck   70-70-67-74=281 -  align=\\"center\\"7  Gary Player   68-74-70-71=283  align=\\"center\\"–1align=center200 -  rowspan=3 align=\\"center\\"T8  Henry Cotton   68-75-69-72=284  rowspan=3 align=\\"center\\"Erowspan=3 align=center125 -  Eric Lester   73-66-71-74=284 -  Harry Weetman   73-67-73-71=284 } Amateur: Carr (+10). ===Playoff=== Saturday, 5 July 1958 {  !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par!!Money (£) -  align=center1  Peter Thomson   align=center68-71=139 align=center–3 align=\\"center\\"1,000 -  align=center2  Dave Thomas   align=center69-74=143  align=center+1 align=\\"center\\"650 } Thomson won in a 36-hole playoff. ==References *87th Open - Royal Lytham & St Annes 1958 (Official site) *1958 Open Championship (about.sports) Category:The Open Championship Open Championship Open Championship Category:Golf tournaments in England Category:July 1958 sports events ","title":"1958 Open Championship"},{"id":"19259989","text":"Mechanitis polymnia, the orange-spotted tiger clearwing or disturbed tigerwing,Glassberg, Jeffrey (2007).

Gary Player, age 23, shot a final round of 68 to win the first of his nine major titles, two strokes ahead of runners-up Fred Bullock and Flory Van Donck. It was the first of Player's three Claret Jugs; he won again in 1968 and 1974. Muirfield was originally scheduled to host in 1957, but it was transferred to St. Andrews because of petrol rationing following the \\"Suez Crisis\\" in late 1956. Muirfield was subsequently allocated the 1959 Championship. Qualifying took place on 29–30 June, with 18 holes at Muirfield and 18 holes at the number 1 course of Gullane Golf Club. There were no exemptions and the number of qualifiers was limited to a maximum of 100, and ties did not qualify. The qualifying score was 147 and 90 players advanced to the first round the next day; defending champion Peter Thomson led with 137 and won the £50 qualifying prize. The maximum number of players making the cut after 36 holes was again set at 50, and ties did not make the cut. The purse was increased to £5,000, up 150 from 4,850 in 1958; the winner's share remained unchanged at £1,000, but the prizes for second to fifth places were increased. Second place received £700, with 525 for third, 400 for fourth, and 325 for fifth. Only four Americans were in the field of 90 (Willie Goggin, Bob Sweeny, Bob Watson, and John Garrett) and none made the cut. Sweeny and Garrett were amateurs. ==Course== { style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:100%;\\" !Hole!!Yards!!Par!!!!Hole!!Yards!!Par - 14534rowspan=10 DCDCDC;\\" 104804 - 23534113594 - 33824123804 - 41923131533 - 55105144585 - 64584153934 - 71673161933 - 84554175135 - 94905184274 -  Out3,45036 In3,35636 - colspan=2 align=leftSource: colspan=3Total 6,80672 } ==Past champions in the fieldMade the cut=== {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  To par  Finish -  align=leftPeter Thomson  align=left  1954, 1955, 1956, 1958  74  74  72  74  294  +6  T23 -  align=leftBobby Locke  align=left 1949, 1950, 1952, 1957  73  73  76 73  295  +7 T29 -  align=leftHenry Cotton  align=left  1934, 1937, 1948  71  75  77  77  300  +12  T41 } ===Missed the cut=== {   !Player  Country  Year won  R1  R2  Total  To par -  align=leftDick Burton  align=left  1939  75  74  149  +5 -  align=leftMax Faulkner  align=left  1951  74  75  149  +5 } Source: ==Round summariesFirst round=== Wednesday, 1 July 1959 Fred Bullock and Arnold Stickley led after the first round on Wednesday at 68.

In the centenary year of the Open Championship, Kel Nagle prevailed over Arnold Palmer by a single stroke; this year marked the championship's re-emergence as a major stop for American players. The total prize money was increased by forty percent, from £5,000 to £7,000. The winner's share was increased to £1,250 with £900 for second, £700 for third, £500 for fourth, £400 for fifth, £300 for sixth, £250 for seventh, £200 for eighth, £150 for ninth, and £130 for tenth. The next fifteen places each received £60 with £50 for next seven and then £40 for the next eighteen. The £50 prize for winning the qualification event was unchanged while the four prizes for the lowest score in each round were increased to £50. For the centenary event there was a special prize for the winner in the form of a replica of the claret jug. Qualifying took place on 4–5 July, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes on the Old Course and 18 holes on the New Course. A maximum of 100 players could qualify. Gary Player led the qualifiers as medalist at 135, and the qualifying score was 147 and 74 players qualified; 28 players on 148 were not included. Dick Metz, who had won the World Senior Golf Championship at Gleneagles on 3 July, was one of those on 148 who just failed to qualify. Roberto De Vicenzo opened the tournament proper with consecutive rounds of 67 on Wednesday and Thursday to take a two-stroke lead over Nagle. In the third round, De Vicenzo's drive on the 14th ended up on top of a wall and he finished the round with a score of 75, allowing Nagle to take a two- shot lead. Palmer, who had won the U.S. Open three weeks earlier by erasing a seven-shot deficit in the final round, was four back after 54-holes. The final round on Friday afternoon was delayed until Saturday due to a heavy rainfall that flooded portions of the course; the first postponement in over fifty years. When play resumed the next day, Palmer and Nagle both went out in 34. Still four-strokes behind, Palmer began another charge on the back. He made up strokes on the 13th and 15th, made a 4 on the 17th, then made birdie at the last. Nagle was standing over a crucial par putt on the Road Hole 17th when he heard the roar signifying Palmer's birdie at 18. He managed to collect himself and hole the putt, then made a safe 4 at the last to win the title by a single shot over Palmer. Already 39 at the time of his victory, this was Nagle's first top ten finish in a major championship. Although little-known outside of Australia at the time of the tournament, he went on to have success throughout the next decade and came close to winning another major at the 1965 U.S. Open, losing to Gary Player in an 18-hole playoff. Palmer had won the first two majors at the Masters and U.S. Open, and was attempting to equal Ben Hogan's 1953 season with a third consecutive major. His appearance established the British Open as an important tournament for American golfers and, although Palmer himself skipped the tournament a few times afterward, the best American players began crossing the Atlantic with regularity from then on. Palmer won the next two Opens in 1961 and 1962. The appearance of Palmer, already the most popular golfer in the world, proved to be a turning point for the Open Championship. Until the 1960s, few Americans made the trip to the Open Championship, with the lengthy ocean-voyage and high costs of traveling to Britain often more than they stood to win in the tournament. Even Palmer, winner of the first two majors of the year, had to play in the 36-hole qualifier immediately preceding it. The 1960 event included only four Americans following the qualifier, and only two made the cut. Ten years later, 24 Americans were in the field of 134. For many years, the event often conflicted with the PGA Championship in the U.S., a more lucrative major which gradually moved to late July and then August. ==Card of the course== {class= !Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par!! !!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par - align=center1Burnalign=center374align=center4rowspan=10 align=center10Tenth ^align=center338align=center4 - align=center2Dykealign=center411align=center4align=center11High (In)align=center170align=center3 - align=center3Cartgate (Out)align=center400align=center4align=center12Heathery (In)align=center360align=center4 - align=center4Ginger Beeralign=center439align=center4align=center13Hole O'Cross (In)align=center427align=center4 - align=center5Hole O'Cross (Out)align=center567align=center5align=center14Longalign=center560align=center5 - align=center6Heathery (Out)align=center377align=center4align=center15Cartgate (In)align=center413align=center4 - align=center7High (Out)align=center364align=center4align=center16Corner of the Dykealign=center380align=center4 - align=center8Shortalign=center163align=center3align=center17Roadalign=center453align=center4 - align=center9Endalign=center359align=center4align=center18Tom Morrisalign=center381align=center4 -  colspan=2 align=centerOutalign=center3,454align=center36 colspan=2 align=centerInalign=center3,482align=center36 - colspan=5Source: colspan=2 align=centerTotalalign=center6,936align=center72 } ^ The 10th hole was posthumously named for Bobby Jones in 1972 == Past champions in the field  Made the cut === {  style=\\"text- align:center\\" !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  To par  Finish -  align=leftGary Player  align=left South Africa  1959  72  71  72  69  284  −4  7 -  align=leftPeter Thomson  align=left  1954, 1955, 1956, 1958  72  69  75  70  286  −2  T9 } Source: === Missed the cut === {   !Player  Country  Year won  R1  R2  Total  To par -  align=leftGene Sarazen  align=left  1932  83  WD   } Source: ==Round summariesFirst round=== Wednesday, 6 July 1960 {  !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par - align=center1Roberto De Vicenzo align=center67align=center−5 - rowspan=\\"2\\" align=centerT2Fidel de Luca rowspan=\\"2\\" align=center69rowspan=\\"2\\" align=center−3 - Kel Nagle - rowspan=\\"4\\" align=centerT4David Blair (a) rowspan=\\"4\\" align=center70rowspan=\\"4\\" align=center−2 - Ken Bousfield - Arnold Palmer - Peter Shanks - align=center8Peter Millsalign=center71align=center−1 - rowspan=\\"12\\" align=centerT9Joe Carr (a)  rowspan=\\"12\\" align=center 72rowspan=\\"12\\" align=centerE - José María Gonzáles - Harold Henning South Africa - Bernard Hunt - George Low - Jimmy Martin - Ángel Miguel - Ralph Moffitt - Raymond Munro (a)  - Gary Player South Africa - Leopoldo Ruiz - Peter Thomson } Source: === Second round === Thursday, 7 July 1960 A maximum of fifty players could make the cut.

Arnold Palmer won the first of two consecutive Open Championships, one stroke ahead of Dai Rees. It was the second Open for Palmer, the runner-up in his first in 1960, and the fourth of his seven major titles. He was the first American to win the Claret Jug since Ben Hogan in 1953. This was the second Open Championship at Royal Birkdale, which hosted in 1954. Qualifying took place on 10–11 July. Entries played 18 holes on the Championship course and 18 holes at Hillside Golf Club. The number of qualifiers was limited to a maximum of 120. Ties for 120th place would not qualify. The qualifying score was 151 and 108 players qualified. There were 22 players on 152. Bob Charles led the qualifiers on 136, two ahead of Gary Player. A maximum of 50 players could make the cut after 36 holes. Ties for 50th place did not make the cut. Gale-force winds caused scores to soar during the second round on Thursday, followed by heavy rains which washed out both rounds on Friday. Cancellation was a possibility, but the weather cooperated enough to play the third and fourth rounds in showers on Saturday. 1959 Open champion and reigning Masters champion Gary Player withdrew early in the third round due to a stomach ailment. ==Past champions in the fieldMade the cut=== {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  To par  Finish -  align=leftKel Nagle  align=left  1960  68  75  75  71  289  +1  T5 -  align=leftPeter Thomson  align=left  1954, 1955, 1956, 1958  75  72  70  73  290  +2  7 -  align=leftHenry Cotton  align=left  1934, 1937, 1948  76  77  74  77  304  +16  T32 -  align=leftGary Player  align=left  1959  73  77  WD     } ===Missed the cut=== {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  Total  To par -  align=leftDick Burton  align=left  1939  80  77  157  +13 -  align=leftBobby Locke  align=left 1949, 1950, 1952, 1957  75  84  159  +15 } ==Round summariesFirst round=== Wednesday, 12 July 1961 {  !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par - rowspan=\\"3\\" align=centerT1Harold Henningrowspan=\\"3\\" align=center68rowspan=\\"3\\" align=center−4 - Kel Nagle - Dai Rees - rowspan=\\"3\\" align=centerT4Jean Garaïalderowspan=\\"3\\" align=center69rowspan=\\"3\\" align=center−3 - Norman Johnson - David Miller - rowspan=\\"6\\" align=centerT7Alan Brookesrowspan=\\"6\\" align=center 70rowspan=\\"6\\" align=center−2 - Neil Coles - Sam King - John MacDonald - Arnold Palmer - Lionel Platts } ===Second round=== Thursday, 13 July 1961 {  !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par - rowspan=\\"2\\" align=centerT1Harold Henningalign=center 68-74=142rowspan=\\"2\\" align=center−2 - Dai Reesalign=center68-74=142 - rowspan=\\"2\\" align=centerT3Kel Naglealign=center 68-75=143rowspan=\\"2\\" align=center−1 - Arnold Palmeralign=center 70-73=143 - rowspan=\\"4\\" align=centerT5Neil Colesalign=center 70-77=147rowspan=\\"4\\" align=center+3 - Sam Kingalign=center 70-77=147 - Ramón Sotaalign=center 71-76=147 - Peter Thomsonalign=center 75-72=147 - rowspan=\\"9\\" align=centerT9Peter Allissalign=center 73-75=148rowspan=\\"9\\" align=center+4 - Ken Bousfieldalign=center 71-77=148 - Harry Bradshawalign=center 73-75=148 - Peter Butleralign=center 72-76=148 - Eric Lesteralign=center 71-77=148 - David Milleralign=center 69-79=148 - Christy O'Connor Snralign=center 71-77=148 - Dave Thomasalign=center 71-77=148 - Brian Wilkesalign=center 72-76=148 } Amateurs: Christmas (+6), White (+6), Chapman (+11), Bonallack (+15), Carr (+17), Reece (+18), Pearson (+25) ===Third round=== Saturday, 15 July 1961 - (morning) {  !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par - align=center1Arnold Palmeralign=center 70-73-69=212align=center−4 - align=center2Dai Reesalign=center 68-74-71=213align=center−3 - align=center3Christy O'Connor Snralign=center 71-77-67=215align=center−1 - align=center4Neil Colesalign=center70-77-69=216align=centerE - rowspan=\\"2\\" align=centerT5Harold Henningalign=center 68-74-75=217  rowspan=\\"2\\" align=center+1 - Peter Thomsonalign=center 75-72-70=217 - align=center7Kel Naglealign=center68-75-75=218align=center+2 - rowspan=\\"3\\" align=centerT8Eric Brownalign=center 73-76-70=219rowspan=\\"3\\" align=center+3 - Norman Johnsonalign=center69-80-70=219 - Ramón Sotaalign=center71-76-72=219 } ===Final round=== Saturday, 15 July 1961 - (afternoon) {  !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par!!Money (£) -  align=\\"center\\"1  Arnold Palmer   70-73-69-72=284  align=\\"center\\"−4align=\\"center\\"1,400 -  align=\\"center\\"2  Dai Rees   68-74-71-72=285  align=\\"center\\"−3align=\\"center\\"1,000 -  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"T3  Neil Coles   70-77-69-72=288  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"Erowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"710 -  Christy O'Connor Snr   71-77-67-73=288 -  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"T5  Eric Brown   73-76-70-70=289  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"+1rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"400 -  Kel Nagle   68-75-75-71=289 -  align=\\"center\\"7  Peter Thomson   75-72-70-73=290  align=\\"center\\"+2align=\\"center\\"275 -  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"T8  Peter Alliss   73-75-72-71=291  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"+3rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"190 -  Ken Bousfield   71-77-75-68=291 -  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"T10  Harold Henning   68-74-75-76=293  rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"+5rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\"140 -  Syd Scott   76-75-71-71=293 } Amateurs: White (+18), Christmas (+20) ==References *90th Open - Royal Birkdale 1961 (Official site) *1961 Open Championship (about.sports) Category:The Open Championship Category:Golf tournaments in England Open Championship Open Championship Open Championship ","title":"1961 Open Championship"},{"id":"19260024","text":"The 1962 Open Championship was the 91st Open Championship, played from 11–13 July at Troon Golf Club in Troon, Scotland.

Neither had played the Old Course before and Lema had never played in Britain; he gave much of the credit for his victory to his caddy, Tip Anderson.

Jack Nicklaus won the first of his three Claret Jugs, one stroke ahead of runners-up Doug Sanders and Dave Thomas. It was the sixth of eighteen major titles for Nicklaus and marked the completion of the first of his three career grand slams. This was the first Open to be scheduled over four days, with one round each day, finishing on Saturday. Previous editions had played the third and fourth rounds on Friday. The U.S. Open changed to a four-day schedule the previous year in 1965, moving its final round from Saturday afternoon to Sunday. The Open Championship operated on a Wednesday through Saturday schedule through 1979. It was the final Open for 1964 champion Tony Lema, who died in a plane crash two weeks later, hours after the PGA Championship. Nicklaus has described Muirfield as \\"the best golf course in Britain.\\" He later developed a championship golf course and community in Dublin, Ohio, a suburb north of his hometown of Columbus. Opened in 1974, Nicklaus named it Muirfield Village and it hosts his Memorial Tournament, a top invitational event on the PGA Tour since 1976. ==Course== {   !

The ship put into Torbay in order to repair damage it had sustained. In 1850, Ripon brought Prime Minister Jung Bahadur Rana of Nepal and his entourage to the UK, docking at the port of Southampton on 25 May 1850. A large collection of wild animals was also carried aboard the Ripon including the first hippopotamus seen in England since Roman times, which became known as the Regent's Park Hippo. The Ripon was requisitioned in 1854 for use in the Crimean War along with 11 other Peninsular and Oriental ships. In 1857, it was reported in Scientific American that the Ripon was to be fitted with a propeller. In 1864 the PS Ripon brought Italian General Giuseppe Garibaldi to the United Kingdom for a meeting with Prime Minister Henry Palmerston. Three years later in 1870 the engines of the Ripon were sold and the vessel was converted into a brig for Caird & Co in Greenock. In 1880, after serving as a hulk in Trinidad and Tobago, the Ripon was scuttled at sea near Port of Spain. ==References * ::Includes an excerpt from a medic, Dr. W.

He and Carl Emil Lewenhaupt were executed for negligence in the Russo-Swedish War, in the aftermath of the defeat at Villmanstrand. ==Biography== He was born on July 22, 1685 in Swedish Livonia. He was the son of the landed gentleman and Swedish Empire army officer Henrik Gotthard von Buddenbrock (1648–1727) and Charlotta Cronman. He enlisted as an officer of the Swedish army, becoming a captain of the Life Guards in 1711, Major of grenadiers in 1715, Major General in 1721. He was elevated to friherre (matricle number 206) in 1731 and promoted to Lieutenant General of the infantry in 1739. As such, he was in 1741 commander of the troops in Finland, under General Charles Emil Lewenhaupt, at the onset of the Russo-Swedish War. On August 23, 1741 (September 3, 1741), Swedish Major General Carl Henrik Wrangel and his corps in Villmanstrand in Karelia, at the long disputed frontier between Sweden and Russia, was attacked and defeated by a Russian army under General Peter Lacy before Buddenbrock, less than 10 kilometers away, could come to his assiantance. As the war was developing unfavorably for Sweden, the defeat was blamed on Lewenhaupt and Buddenbrock. In August 1742 they were dismissed from Finland and immediately arrested by Vice Admiral Ritterstolpe upon their return. On the night of September 28 Buddenbrock was brought to Stockholm, where he was imprisoned and closely guarded. A court martial was convened under Field Marshal Hugo Johan Hamilton (sv) on October 8 to investigate the two cases. The prosecutor was Chancellor of Justice Silverschildt, who submitted an extensive indictment. Buddenbrock was accused of, among other things, not assembling his troops in a timely fashion to cross the Russian border, as planned. In addition he had not arrived at Villmanstrand in time to rescue Major General Wrangel. Buddenbrock defended himself so well, that had he only faced the nobility, he would have left with his life. However the other Estates of the Riksdag, in particular the peasants, were embittered and demanded a scapegoat. The verdict of the commission was announced to a large congregation on May 29. Buddenbrock was to be dishonored, his property confiscated, and he himself beheaded with an axe. In an appeal, Buddenbrock wrote a comprehensive account where he detailed his services to the kingdom, but despite this and the pleading of his family, the verdict was confirmed by the Estates the following day. Even a request to be beheaded with a sword as befitting a nobleman, or to be executed by firing squad was denied. The date of his execution was set to July 20 but king Frederick postponed it another week. On July 27, 1743, General von Buddenbrock was executed in Stockholm. His wife, Magdalena Elisabeth Rahm, and their four children left Sweden for the Netherlands. ==Children== *Magdalena Elisabeth von Buddenbrock (1717-1768), she married her cousin Carl Magnus von Buddenbrock (died 1778) *Friedrich Magnus von Buddenbrock (1719-c.1785) *Ulrike Dorothea von Buddenbrock (1721-1788) married in 1743 to Cornet Isaac Tham *Carl Heinrich von Buddenbrock (1725-1745) Swedish Lieutenant who was killed in action at Tournay ==See also== *Carl Emil Lewenhaupt ==ReferencesAncestors== {  +Henrik Magnus Buddenbrock's ancestors in three generations - -  rowspan=\\"8\\" align=\\"center\\" Henrik Magnus Buddenbrock  rowspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" Father: Henrik Gotthard von Buddenbrock  rowspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" Paternal Grandfather:  align=\\"center\\" Paternal Great-Grandfather: -  align=\\"center\\" Paternal Great-grandmother: -  rowspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" Paternal Grandmother:  align=\\"center\\" Paternal Great-Grandfather: -  align=\\"center\\" Paternal Great-Grandmother: -  rowspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" Mother: Charlotta Cronman  rowspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" Maternal Grandfather: Fritz Cronman  align=\\"center\\" Maternal Great-Grandfather: Hans Detterman Croman -  align=\\"center\\" Maternal Great-Grandmother: Ursula Kordes -  rowspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" Maternal Grandmother: Christina Ottiliana Börner  align=\\"center\\" Maternal Great-grandfather: -  align=\\"center\\" Maternal Great-Grandmother: } * Henrik Magnus von Buddenbrock at Geni.com Category:1685 births Category:1743 deaths Category:Swedish generals Category:Swedish people of German descent Category:Caroleans Category:People of the Russo-Swedish War (1741–1743) Category:18th-century Swedish military personnel Category:18th- century executions by Sweden Category:People executed by Sweden by decapitation Category:Executed Swedish people Category:People from Swedish Livonia ","title":"Henrik Magnus von Buddenbrock"},{"id":"19260139","text":"Francis Greville, 3rd Baron Brooke (died November 1658) supported the Parliamentary (Roundhead) cause in the English Civil War. ==Biography== Francis Greville was the eldest son and heir of Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke and his wife Catharine, daughter of Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford.

Orchids in this genus are distinguished from those in the similar Caladenia by having a glabrous leaf and a densely woolly labellum. Species occur in south-west Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, and Tasmania. Their common name alludes to their prominent ear-like lateral sepals.E. cucullatus ==Description== Orchids in the genus Eriochilus are terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herbs usually with a few inconspicuous, fine roots and a roughly spherical, succulent tuber. Replacement tubers form at the end of short \\"droppers\\". There is a single, glabrous, egg-shaped to lance-shaped leaf either at the base, or in the middle of the flowering stem. The inflorescence is a raceme with up to 25 resupinate flowers, each with a small bract at the base of its stalk. The dorsal sepal is smaller than the other two sepals, is dished and erect but curves forward to form a hood over the labellum. The lateral sepals are much longer, broader and more conspicuous than the dorsal sepal and are white to pink and spreading. As is usual in orchids, one petal is highly modified as the central labellum. The other two petals are usually smaller and narrower than the sepals and are either erect, spreading or curved backwards towards the ovary. The base of the labellum partly surrounds the lower part of the column forming a tube while the front is strongly curved downwards, covered with glandular hairs and often spotted. The sexual parts of the flower are fused to the column, which is erect, short, weakly curved and has narrow, wing-like structures. Bunny orchids flower from late winter to early summer, depending on species. The fruit that follows flowering is a non- fleshy, dehiscent capsule containing up to 500 seeds. ==Taxonomy and naming== The genus Eriochilus was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae. The botanical name Eriochilus is derived from the Ancient Greek words ἔριον erion meaning \\"wool\\" and χεῖλος cheilos meaning lip referring to the hairy labellum. ==Distribution and habitat== Ten species of bunny orchids occur in Western Australia where they are found in a range of habitats from areas that are swampy in winter to dry inland woodlands. They occur from north of Kalbarri to Israelite Bay on the south coast. Three species are found in the south-east of South Australia, including the Eyre Peninsula and Yorke Peninsula. Two species are found in Victoria, three in New South Wales.

The son of Christopher Plunkett, 9th Baron Killeen and Jane (or Genet) Dillon, daughter of Sir Lucas Dillon, his brother Luke was created Earl of Fingall in 1628. At the age of twenty Plunkett traveled to London to receive training as a lawyer at Gray's Inn in London, and later trained at King's Inn in Dublin. By the 1630s he had established a thriving legal practice: the attempts by Thomas Wentworth, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, to confiscate as much Irish land as possible to the Crown, ensured that his services were in high demand. At this time he also became an MP in the Irish House of Commons, sitting for Meath. At the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Plunkett attempted to remain neutral. However, in mid-1642 government troops looted and torched his home in Balrath, County Meath: Plunkett unsurprisingly thereafter gave support to the leaders of the Irish Insurgents. He played a prominent role in the foundation of the Confederation of Kilkenny, sitting as chairman at the first meeting of the Confederate Assembly and was also a member of the Confederate Supreme Council (one of six members representing the province of Leinster).Meehan,Confederation of Kilkenny,pg46 Plunkett was also appointed Muster-Master general.Meehan,Confederation of Kilkenny,pg47 In 1644 Plunkett was a member of a Confederate delegation sent to negotiate a treaty with King Charles I. The first Ormond Peace was eventually arranged in 1646, but despite Plunkett's efforts the Catholic Clergy of Ireland rejected the treaty. Plunkett was a deeply religious man, who impressed the Papal Nuncio, Rinuccini after his arrival in Ireland in late 1645. Even so, Plunkett was a moderate by disposition, and he thus became a leader of the moderate Confederate faction, attempting in 1647 to reconcile the supporters of Ormond and those of Rinuccini. In 1648 he once again took part in a Confederate delegation, this time to Rome, in an attempt to gain further Papal support. The Pope made Plunkett a knight of the Golden Spur, but the mission to Rome was largely a failure. While he was in Rome a Civil War broke out in the Confederation over the Inchiquin truce of 1648. When Plunklett returned, the clerical faction of the Confederates had lost influence, and so Plunkett became involved in negotiations for a second Ormond Peace, eventually signed in early 1649. Only six months later the New Model Army launched a full-scale invasion of Ireland, and within a year had conquered large areas of the island. Nicholas' nephew Christopher Plunkett, 2nd Earl of Fingall was killed at the Battle of Rathmines. Ulick Burke, 1st Marquess of Clanricarde was appointed leader of the Irish forces in late 1650, replacing the discredited Earl of Ormond. In 1651 Clanricarde sent Plunkett with Geoffrey Browne on a desperate mission to negotiate with Charles IV, the extremely wealthy Duke of Lorraine, but the mission to gain his support was not successful. After the conquest of Ireland Plunkett had his lands confiscated and was transported to Connacht. His luck changed at the Restoration in 1660, however: the endless disputes between the dispossessed Irish landholders and the planters enabled him to restore his legal practice to its former esteem. He married Catherine Turner, daughter of William Turner, an Alderman of Dublin; their daughter Jane married Valentine Browne, 1st Viscount Kenmare. Nicholas Plunkett's brother, Patrick, was also prominent in Confederate politics, becoming Bishop of Ardagh in 1647 largely thanks to the backing of Rinuccini.O hAnnrachain,The Mission of Rinuccini,pg277 ==Footnotes== *: Meehan, Confederation of Kilkenny, pg 46 *: Meehan, Confederation of Kilkenny, pg 47 *: Ó hAnnracháin, Tadhg, The Mission of Rinuccini, pg 277 ==ReferencesSources== * * Category:1602 births Category:1680 deaths Category:People from County Meath Category:People of the Irish Confederate Wars Category:Irish MPs 1639–1649 Category:Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Meath constituencies Category:Alumni of King's Inns ","title":"Nicholas Plunkett"},{"id":"19260289","text":"WRNY may refer to: * WRNY (AM), a radio station (1350 AM) licensed to Rome, New York, United States * WRNY (defunct), a radio/television station that operated in New York City from 1925 to 1934 * WRNY, a defunct radio station (680 AM) that operated in Rochester, New York from 1957 to 1979 (see also WDCX (AM)) ","title":"WRNY"},{"id":"19260294","text":"N'Dayi Kalenga (born 12 December 1967 in Kamina) is a former Congolese professional football midfielder who played for Ankaragücü and Altay S.K. in Turkey.

He graduated in 1931 from Princeton University, where he wrote humor for the Daily Princetonian and was art director for the Princeton Tiger Magazine. He honed his craft at Art Students League of New York with instructors including painter Thomas Hart Benton. In his early 20s began selling cartoons to Judge, Life and College Humor. As a 24-year-old in 1933, he sold his first cartoon to The New Yorker, while the magazine, which had been founded in 1925, was still in its infancy.

A master draftsman who (unlike most of his colleagues) wrote his own captions, Darrow was among the last of the New Yorker's early cartoonists, joining Charles Addams, Peter Arno, George Price and James Thurber.

He also served in the Western Theater late in his career. ==Biography== Rugg was born in Taunton, Massachusetts in 1834. Early in the war, he became a brevet second lieutenant in the 2nd U. S. Artillery, a promotion dated October 22, 1862. He received permanent promotion to that rank in the 4th U. S. Artillery on the same date. There is no record of Rugg's having attended a military school, suggesting he was promoted from the ranks. Rugg commanded Battery F, 4th U.S. Artillery in the artillery brigade of the XII Corps at Gettysburg. Lt. Edward D. Muhlenberg, who had commanded the battery, was in charge of the brigade by seniority. Battery F reached Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, and advanced to a position near the Hanover Road to support the advance of the 1st Division under Brig. Gen. Alpheus S. Williams to Benner's Hill.Pfanz, p. 96. The battery arrived with 120 men and 6 Napoleons, 12-pounder smoothbore guns; see Field artillery in the American Civil War. On July 2 it covered a gap in the Union lines, but on July 3 it was posted near the Baltimore Pike to bombard the portion of Culp's Hill the Confederates had captured on the previous day. It participated in a bombardment of the Confederates that helped drive them from their advanced position.Pfanz, pp. 285-87. One man was wounded by an artillery round from the bombardment preceding Pickett's Charge that flew over the Union lines on Cemetery Ridge. The battery’s monument stands at the intersection of Hunt Avenue and the Baltimore Pike on the battlefield.Recker, Stephen, Virtual Gettysburg website Rugg continued to serve in the Union army through the autumn 1863 campaigns in Tennessee when the XII Corps was reassigned to the Western Theater.

Advance Concrete is used in the structural / civil engineering and drafting fields. ==Features== Building with two floors, with stairs, modeled in Advance Concrete. Advance Concrete is specifically designed for engineers and structural draftsmen looking for comprehensive and easy to use software, including its own graphics engine allowing it to run with or without AutoCAD. The application can be used for modeling and detailing different types of concrete structures, such as buildings, precast concrete elements, and also for civil engineering designs. Advance Concrete uses AutoCAD technology: ObjectARX. This technology provides users with professional objects (beams, columns, slabs, bars, frames, stirrup bars) integrated into AutoCAD and on which most basic AutoCAD functions can be applied (stretch, shorten, copy, move). The Advance Concrete native file is the DWG file. The main functions of Advance Concrete concern: * 2D / 3D modeling of concrete structures; * Automated drawings, with tools for automatic creation of sections, elevations, foundations, isometric views, etc.; * Advanced reinforcement, with automatic creation and update functionalities and also with manual input tools; * Creation of paper drawings; * Automatic bill of materials. * Multi-user modeling. Users can securely and simultaneously work on the same project through a shared database that stores the model data. The program provides a working environment for creating 3D structural models from which drawings are created. The 3D model is created using Advance Concrete specific objects (structural elements, openings, rebars, etc.) and stored in a drawing (in DWG format). Once a model is complete, Advance Concrete creates all structural and reinforcement drawings using a large selection of tools for view creation, dimensions, interactive annotations, symbols, markings and automatic layout functions. Advance Concrete provides functionalities for automatic drawing updates based on model modifications. ===Specific functionalities=== Reinforcement drawing created in Advance Concrete. One of the features of Advance Concrete is the “dynamic reinforcement” technology for the rapid reinforcement of concrete elements taking into account their context (type, parameters, connection with other elements). The user creates a so-called dynamic reinforcement solution that integrates the reinforcement cage elements and properties: geometric information, local rules and standards for steel grade, reinforcement bar placement, concrete cover, etc. The reinforcement solutions can be used later for elements that have different sizes. The reinforcement elements adjust to the new dimensions and are taken into account at reinforcement drawing creation and lists. The user can save the reinforcement solution in an external file, which can be exchanged, downloaded, reused in any other projects etc. == Software compatibility == The application is compatible with the following operating systems and Autodesk platforms: * Windows Vista, Windows XP Pro and Windows 7 (32 and 64 bits) * AutoCAD 2007, 2008, 2009 32 and 64 bits, 2010 32 and 64 bits * ADT 2007, * AutoCAD Architecture 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011. == Software interoperability == Advance Concrete integrates GRAITEC’s “GTC” (GRAITEC Transfer Center) technology, a data synchronization technology that allows: *Importing / exporting data to other GRAITEC software and standard formats (IFC 2.×3) *Several Advance Concrete users working simultaneously on the same project and synchronizing their models *Synchronizing in Advance Concrete the modifications made by engineers in other GRAITEC software applications (e.g., section changes, addition of structural elements, etc.). GTC is the GRAITEC solution for CAD/Design software interoperability and integration specialized in creating and handling a BIM (Building Information Model). ==Release history== {  - !

Within a few years, the fledgling railroad company named another former general, Ambrose Burnside, as its president. The Cairo & Vincennes began laying track in 1870 and completed the initial portion in 1872 to haul coal from southern Illinois mines. However, the route was not fully completed until late in 1874.

Although he had been trained as a lawyer, he abandoned law as a career and became a minister affiliated with the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. During this period he learned the Choctaw language, which was then entirely unwritten. He also began to develop a Choctaw orthography. After the U.S. government began enforcing its Indian Removal policy to relocate Native Americans from their lands in the Southeastern states to Indian Territory, later called Oklahoma, during the 19th century, in 1835, Byington and his family returned to the new Choctaw homeland and founded a mission near Eagletown. He sought to construct a lexicon and develop other linguistic tools for the Choctaw language to translate Christian prayers, hymns, and bible passages. Byington's work is considered one of the most complete lexicons for a Native American language. He worked nearly 50 years translating Choctaw as a written language.Coleman, Louis.\\"Byington, Cyrus (1793-1868). Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture.

Less than a week after their meeting, he proposed marriage to her (which she apparently did not accept immediately), then left for a preaching tour. During their separation, he wrote passionate letters to her, asking her again to marry him and accompany him back to Mississippi, where he served as a minister to the Choctaws. The letters were obviously persuasive, for the couple married in December 1827 and set off on their life-long partnership shortly afterward.Baird, W.

Like many of his fellow missionaries, he worried over conflicting loyalties between his church superiors, who were adamantly opposed to slavery, and his Choctaw followers, whose families were slave owners. Arguments over slavery intensified throughout the 1850s. Sponsors of the missions, such as the ABCFM, demanded that their missionaries speak out against slavery. However, the government of the Choctaw Nation threatened to expel any who did so. When the missionaries declared they would remain, the sponsors cut off financial support. Byington reportedly said this experience was \\"like death.\\" Byington defiantly stayed at his post. He published his Choctaw Definer, made up of English words and Choctaw equivalents, in 1852 but his Grammar and Dictionary were not printed until after his death. Meanwhile he continued his normal missionary duties and medical work. Byington expected to continue working at the mission after the end of the Civil War. However, he became so seriously ill, that people at the mission feared he was about to die. His sole surviving son, Cyrus N,, brought a carriage and drove him to Little Rock, away, so that he could travel by steamboat, where he could stay with his now-married daughter. He caught smallpox during the trip and had to be quarantined for a month after arriving in Ohio. His wife, who had remained in charge of the Eagleton mission while awaiting the arrival of a new missionary, finally rejoined Cyrus in the spring of 1867. ==Death and legacy== Somehow, Byington completed his translation of the first five books of the Bible into Choctaw and personally delivered them to the printer in New York City. He returned to Ohio in the spring of 1868, and resumed work on the 7th edition of his Choctaw Grammar. He still working on this when he died on December 31, 1868. The grammar book could not be published until 1871, but handwritten copies were made by others for missionaries to use in the meanwhile. ==Byington's linguistic work== The Choctaw language is a member of the Muskogean family and was well known among the frontiersmen, such as US President Andrew Jackson and William Henry Harrison. The language is closely related to Chickasaw; some linguists consider the two varieties a single language. The following table is an example of Choctaw text and its translation: {  ! width=600 align=center - CCCCCC\\" -  DDDDDD\\" Chata Anumpa: Hattak yuka keyu hokυtto yakohmit itibachυfat hieli kυt, nan isht imaiυlhpiesa atokmυt itilawashke; yohmi ha hattak nana hohkia, keyukmυt kanohmi hohkia okla moma nana isht aim aiυlhpiesa, micha isht aimaiυlhtoba he aima ka kanohmi bano hosh isht ik imaiυlhpieso kashke. Amba moma kυt nana isht imachukma chi ho tuksυli hokmakashke. -  English Language: That all free men, when they form a special compact, are equal in rights, and that no man or set of men are entitled to exclusive, separate public emolument or privileges from the community, but in consideration of public services. } ===Orthography=== The written Choctaw language is based upon English version of the Roman alphabet and was developed in conjunction with the civilization program of the United States in the early 19th century. Byington's alphabet and a version modified by John Swanton is seen here. Byington (Original) The Choctaw \\"Speller\\" alphabet as found in the Chahta Holisso Ai Isht Ia Vmmona, 1800s. Byington/Swanton (Linguistic) The Choctaw linguistic alphabet as found in the Choctaw Language Dictionary by Cyrus Byington and modified by John Swanton, 1909. ==Works== *English and Choctaw Definer (Holisso Anumpa Tosholi), 1852 *Grammar of the Choctaw Language, 1870 *\\"A dictionary of the Choctaw language\\" (Choctaw/English and English/Choctaw), 1915 ==See also== * Timothy H.

Registration opened on 1 September 2008. === Sales === Tickets were able to be purchased via the See Tickets website or by telephone. A limited number of tickets were available by promotion through the Western Daily Press and competitions run by Greenpeace, eFestivals and The Guardian. The 2009 wristband Ticket lines opened on the morning of 5 October 2008, and customers were able to place deposits for tickets (£50) or buy them in full (£175). Tickets required full payment by 1 February 2009. On 22 January 2009, at Midem 2009, Michael Eavis announced that 90% of the event's 137,500 tickets had been sold. He also stated that although headliners had not been confirmed, he was awaiting confirmation from the acts he had approached.  Re-sale  Reserved tickets which did not have their remaining balance paid by the deadline were put back on sale on 2 February 2009 and it was announced the next day that the event had sold out, with the majority of reservations being balanced by 1 February deadline. A re-sale of cancelled tickets was held on 5 April 2009 at 9:00 am. These tickets sold out by 10:15 am. == Site  Arenas === In a December 2008 interview, co-organiser Emily Eavis stated that the Trash City arena would be expanded for the 2009 festival. On 5 December 2008, Battersea and Wandsworth TUC announced that the Left Field tent of the site would not be a part of the 2009 event. A new area, named William's Green, occupied the same area. The 2009 event saw expansion of the Dance Village – including a 3D disco – as well as the return of the G-Stage and the Pussy Parlure. Greenpeace used their area in the Green Fields to create an airport terminal building and miniature replica of the village of Sipson, which is threatened by the expansion of London Heathrow Airport. === Camping === As with previous events, the festival had a tipi field where six people can accommodate one tipi for the shared price of £800. A new hospitality area, surrounded by a wall, was created on the old cinema field between Lower Mead and Wicker Ground fields. This area included PodPad camping. The positioning of this area restricted pedestrian access to both camping and parking sites; pathways at previous festivals have led through this area. == Line up == The three main headline acts (Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band and Blur) were announced in March 2009, with the full line up being released on 25 May 2009. === Stages 1 to 11 === { class=\\"collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - ! colspan=3  Pyramid Stage -  style=\\"width:33%;\\" Friday 26 June style=\\"width:34%;\\"Saturday 27 June style=\\"width:33%;\\"Sunday 28 June - valign=\\"top\\"  Neil Young The Specials Lily Allen Fleet Foxes N*E*R*D Regina Spektor Gabriella Cilmi Björn Again  Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band Kasabian Crosby, Stills and Nash Dizzee Rascal Spinal Tap Eagles of Death Metal Tinariwen V V Brown  Blur Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds Madness Tom Jones Amadou & Mariam Tony Christie Status Quo Easy Star All-Stars } { class=\\"collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - ! colspan=3  Other Stage -  style=\\"width:33%;\\" Friday 26 June style=\\"width:34%;\\"Saturday 27 June style=\\"width:33%;\\"Sunday 28 June - valign=\\"top\\"  Bloc Party The Ting Tings Lady Gaga Friendly Fires White Lies The View The Maccabees The Rakes The Whip Mr Hudson  Franz Ferdinand Pendulum Maxïmo Park Paolo Nutini Pete Doherty The Script Jason Mraz Metric Peter Bjorn and John The Broken Family Band  The Prodigy Glasvegas Bon Iver Bat for Lashes Yeah Yeah Yeahs Enter Shikari Brand New Art Brut The Boxer Rebellion In Case of Fire } { class=\\"collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - ! colspan=3  Jazz World -  style=\\"width:33%;\\" Friday 26 June style=\\"width:34%;\\"Saturday 27 June style=\\"width:33%;\\"Sunday 28 June - valign=\\"top\\"  Q-Tip The Streets Steel Pulse Lamb Hot 8 Brass Band Stephanie McKay  Playing for Change Baaba Maal Lonnie Liston Smith Jamie Cullum Rokia Traoré Erik Truffaz Rolf Harris  The Black Eyed Peas Manu Dibango Roots Manuva Khaled Orquesta Aragón Linda Lewis } { class=\\"collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - ! colspan=3  John Peel Stage -  style=\\"width:33%;\\" Friday 26 June style=\\"width:34%;\\"Saturday 27 June style=\\"width:33%;\\"Sunday 28 June - valign=\\"top\\"  Doves Jamie T Jack Peñate Little Boots Metronomy V V Brown The Virgins Fucked Up The Rumble Strips Dan Black General Fiasco  Jarvis Cocker White Lies Florence and the Machine Passion Pit The Gaslight Anthem Hockey The Temper Trap Esser The Big Pink Baddies The Nightingales  Echo & the Bunnymen The Wombats Noisettes Ladyhawke The Soft Pack Just Jack Emmy the Great Twisted Wheel We Have Band Wave Machines GoodBooks } { class=\\"collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - ! colspan=3  Acoustic Stage -  style=\\"width:33%;\\" Friday 26 June style=\\"width:34%;\\"Saturday 27 June style=\\"width:33%;\\"Sunday 28 June - valign=\\"top\\"  Ray Davies Fairport Convention Jason Mraz Scott Matthews No Crows Hugh Cornwell Ben Taylor Sean Taylor Alyssa Bonagura John Smith  Kilfenora Céilí Band Tindersticks Newton Faulkner Lisa Hannigan Gary Louris and Mark Olson Lúnasa Bap Kennedy Hope&Social; Stornoway Cora Smyth Band  Georgie Fame Roger McGuinn Sharon Corr London Community Gospel Choir Beth Rowley Imelda May Penguin Cafe Orchestra Kate Walsh Martin Harley Band Lucy Wainwright Roche } { class=\\"collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - ! colspan=3  Park Stage -  style=\\"width:33%;\\" Friday 26 June style=\\"width:34%;\\"Saturday 27 June style=\\"width:33%;\\"Sunday 28 June - valign=\\"top\\"  Animal Collective The Horrors Noah and the Whale The Dead Weather Emilíana Torrini The Hotrats James Hunter Golden Silvers Bishi Lay Low Super Furry Animals(Secret Set)  Bon Iver M.

It contested the 2009 elections in the province of Aceh, and is the largest party in the Aceh provincial legislature. ==History== The Aceh Party was formerly known as GAM Party (Partai GAM) after the Free Aceh Movement (GAM), the separatist group that fought for independence for Aceh province. Many of its leaders were senior figures in the movement. Its chairman is the former commander of GAM's military wing. ===2009 elections=== The party stood in the 2009 elections in Aceh, and was predicted to win in at least 15 of Aceh's 21 regencies. The party set a target of 70% of the Aceh vote. During the election campaign, party buildings and vehicles were attacked, including the use of grenades and bombs. Shots were fired at party members.

Despite optimistically claiming it would win 60-70% of the vote during the election campaign, its vote fell sharply to 35.3 percent, although this was enough for a plurality. One reason for the drop in its vote was the internal party conflict that had raged since February 2011, which led to several Aceh Party members to leave to establish the Aceh National Party. The Aceh Party won 29 of the 81 seats in the provincial legislature. ==References== Category:Political parties in Indonesia ","title":"Aceh Party"},{"id":"19260519","text":"Station is a tram station in Nankoku, Japan. ==Lines== *Tosa Electric Railway **Gomen Line ==Adjacent stations== - !colspan=5Tosa Electric Railway ==External links== Category:Railway stations in Kōchi Prefecture Category:Railway stations in Japan opened in 1963 ","title":"Higashi-Kōgyōmae Station"},{"id":"19260535","text":"Station is a tram station in Nankoku, Japan. ==Lines== *Tosa Electric Railway **Gomen Line ==Adjacent stations== - !colspan=5Tosa Electric Railway ==External links== Category:Railway stations in Kōchi Prefecture Category:Railway stations in Japan opened in 1911 ","title":"Sumiyoshi-dōri Station"},{"id":"19260542","text":":for the commune see Thanh Tùng (commune) Thanh Tùng (15 September 1948 – 15 March 2016) was a Vietnamese pop music composer and songwriter.

He inherited Warwick Castle and the title of Baron Brooke from his father in 1727. His education included time as a gentleman commoner at Winchester College (around 1731). He was created Earl Brooke, of Warwick Castle, on 7 July 1746, and became Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire in 1749. He became a Knight of the Thistle in 1743. In 1759, he petitioned George II for the title Earl of Warwick when the last Earl of Warwick from the Rich family died. Francis' petition was granted, and Warwick Castle was once again held by the Earls of Warwick. He was responsible for various renovations to the castle, including the construction of the State Dining Room and the private apartments. His early dalliances with the Neo- Gothic style even caught the attention of the infamous Horace Walpole, who referred to him once as \\"little Brooke\\". Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown was hired by the Earl to redesign the gardens and grounds surrounding the castle. He also employed the services of Giovanni Antonio Canal, who went on to paint five celebrated views of the castle.

A new school building was built in 1899; the high school occupied the top floor of the frame structure, and afterward it became a four-year school. In 1934, the high school got a larger building, with rooms for the sciences, home economics, and the arts. In 1957, the school expanded further to meet the needs of a growing enrollment. The Dunlap Athletic Association was founded in 1915, under the direction of the school's principal. Monthly membership dues of 5 cents helped fund basketball, tennis, and track teams at the high school. Football was eventually added to the school's activities. Dunlap was District 105 until 1945 and District 302 from 1945 to 1969; it has been Dunlap Community Unit School District 323 since 1969. A new high school was built in 1976, with large spaces for home economics, industrial arts, a computer lab, a business department, chemistry and biology labs, music rooms, foreign language and English classes, mathematics, and fine arts. Along with the new school came updated athletic facilities, including a football stadium, and all-weather track, and a heated indoor pool. In 2000, the most of the old high school was demolished, with the remaining classrooms and gym becoming \\"Dunlap District #323 Activity Center.\\" The rest of the old high school grounds were dedicated in 2001 as Alumni Park. ==Expansion== In 2005, Dunlap underwent an addition of 10 new freshman classrooms, a new auditorium, an auxiliary gym, and music/art classrooms, it was completed in time for the start of the 2005-06 school year. In 2010, DHS added ten classrooms, including two computer labs and a science lab. In 2011, the athletics facilities at the school were renovated at a cost of $5,000,000, including an artificial turf football field, new soccer and tennis complexes, and added concession stands. Phase II of the renovation process began in mid August 2013 and included a two-story addition with an additional 17 classrooms, additional locker rooms, additional student lockers, cafeteria and kitchen expansions, new science labs, and a robotics lab. It was completed in time for the start of the 2014-15 school year. In September 2017, the newly redesigned and expanded Library was unveiled. 2018 saw the opening of a new press box for the on-campus baseball stadium named after former student Nicholas J. Murphy. The Nicholas J. Murphy Memorial Press Box was built at a cost of approximately $25,000, coming from donations. It saw its first action on March 21 for a game between Dunlap and Notre Dame. This year, DHS is considered the best high school of all time with average GPAs of 4.1 ==References * Dunlap High School * Dunlap Community Unit School District 323 Category:Public high schools in Illinois Category:Schools in Peoria County, Illinois Category:Educational institutions established in 1893 Category:1893 establishments in Illinois ","title":"Dunlap High School"},{"id":"19260636","text":"Station is a tram station in Kōchi, Japan. ==Lines== *Tosa Electric Railway **Gomen Line ==Adjacent stations== - !colspan=5Tosa Electric Railway ==External links== Category:Railway stations in Kōchi Prefecture Category:Railway stations in Japan opened in 1911 ","title":"Myōkenbashi Station"},{"id":"19260642","text":"Charles Mason, known as Charlie Mason, (13 April 1863 – 3 February 1941) was an English professional footballer, who played for Wolverhampton Wanderers.

It forms part of a wider project to upgrade the infrastructure around the Mersey crossings that includes major civil engineering work to realign the road network, change and add tolling to the Silver Jubilee Bridge, and build new interchanges together with landscaping of highway. ==History prior to construction== When the first road bridge between Runcorn and Widnes opened in 1961 (renamed the Silver Jubilee Bridge in 1977), it replaced the Widnes–Runcorn Transporter Bridge, a 19th-century steam-powered cable-truss transporter that carried four cars in 2½ minutes across the Mersey. The replacement crossing was designed to carry 8,000 vehicles per day; however, 50 years later more than 80,000 vehicles were using the through arch bridge and surrounding road network daily, ten times its expected capacity. A new crossing was therefore deemed both vital and necessary by Halton Borough Council. Moreover, it believed \\"better connectivity, more consistent journey times and improved accessibility, combined with a much improved physical urban environment would make Halton a better place to live and work, and [..] invest\\". In 2001 Ramboll was appointed the lead technical consultant on the project. It worked as part of a technical advisor team composed of CH2M, Ramboll, IBI and Knight Architects, to support the Mersey Gateway Crossings Board with the technical and contractual administration of the project and to help it fulfil its contractual obligations. In June 2010, the project was put on hold awaiting the outcome of the Treasury's Spending Review. In October 2010 it was confirmed by Chancellor George Osborne that the £431m plan would go ahead. As part of the 2014 Budget, Osborne announced a £270m guarantee for the project. ==Design and construction== The bridge under construction After extensive site preparation, construction work began on 7 May 2014 and the bridge opened to traffic just after midnight on 14 October 2017. The bridge has three towers that support a cable-stayed crossing over the river, while the southern approach creates a second bridge over the Ship Canal. The three towers are different heights: an central pylon, a pylon on the north side and a south pylon. The crossing's total length is and its river span is . The deck is made from reinforced concrete with a maximum clearance of above the river. As the water depth was too low at this point for marine construction vessels, a trestle was built out into the Mersey to drive in the bridge's pilings. New roads were built to connect the bridge to the highway network. An interchange and a junction were built to join the southern end to Runcorn's existing Central Expressway. On the northern side, the old route of the A563 was demolished and replaced with a dual carriageway to Speke Road. Embankments on the Widnes side were constructed from decontaminated material excavated along the route from former industrial brownfield sites: treating and reusing the material meant that it did not need to be removed from the construction zone. The new crossing was expected to improve journey times by up to 10 minutes during peak times compared to the old bridge. A nature reserve was established around the bridge and the surrounding riverside, managed by the Mersey Gateway Environmental Trust, an independent charity tasked with promoting biodiversity, landscape, science, and educational opportunities. This scheme, which will help conserve important ecological sites such as the Astmoor salt marshes, is part of the Upper Mersey Estuary project that covers everything upstream of the Mersey Gateway Bridge as far as Warrington. ==Tolls and charges== Driving north on the Mersey Gateway the fee for an unregistered car to cross the Mersey Gateway is £2; for a van or small lorry the single charge is £6 and for a larger lorry or bus £8. Local buses (during the closure of the Silver Jubilee Bridge) and motorcycles are exempt from the tolls. There are no toll booths for payment at the bridge. The toll must be paid to Merseyflow online or via telephone before midnight on the day following the crossing, or a penalty charge will be issued. Users can register online for a prepayment account negating the need to pay tolls individually: this also gives a 10% discount on the toll. Halton residents can pay an annual £10 administration fee and make unlimited personal trips at no further cost. The Merseyflow scheme is operated by emovis Operations Mersey Ltd. on behalf of Halton Borough Council.Merseyflow, Terms and Conditions, accessed 18 August 2019 Halton Borough Council has stated that the Silver Jubilee bridge – although previously free to use – will require a toll like the Mersey Gateway bridge on completion of the scheme. The old bridge will be reduced to one lane in each direction for vehicles and the remaining carriageways converted to a pedestrian/cycleway. The local authority said the cost of the bridge is expected to be paid off in 25 years, at which point a review on tolls would be conducted. Chris Grayling, the UK's Transport Minister in 2017, said that he expected that once \\"the bridge is paid for, the tolls go\\". ===Penalty charges=== The toll must be paid before midnight the following day or a penalty charge is issued. The penalty charge for an unpaid crossing is £20 plus the unpaid toll. Unpaid penalty charges are registered as a civil debt, recovery action begins and enforcement agents may be instructed. In December 2018, 15 months after opening, the one millionth penalty charge was issued. ===Vehicle breakdown charges=== If a vehicle has a breakdown whilst on the bridge, recovery is only permitted by a designated authorised company. No roadside repairs, refuelling or tyre changing are permitted unless by special permission. The recovered vehicle will be taken to an appropriate place where it will be impounded until the recovery and storage fees are paid. Fees are a minimum of £150 plus VAT for a small vehicle. ==Mersey Gateway Project== The construction of the bridge has led to wider infrastructure changes. The Silver Jubilee Bridge was closed upon the Gateway's opening and will be re-opened in 2020 after repair and conversion into a toll bridge, it will also have improved access for pedestrians and cyclists. ===M56 Junction 11a=== In conjunction with the Mersey Gateway Project, proposals have been made to create a new junction on the M56. The aim is to improve the new bridge's connectivity in the Runcorn area, to help tackle current and future congestion, and to relieve the pressure at Junction 12. In September 2017, Highways England announced that the new junction would be located next to Murdishaw roundabout, where the A533 crosses over the M56. Work is expected to begin on Junction 11a in March 2020. ===Runcorn Station Quarter=== The Silver Jubilee Bridge, when re-opened, will be delinked from the ring road preventing passage to Liverpool from the A533. Halton Council has plans to redevelop Runcorn railway station to promote railway journeys between Runcorn and Liverpool. A new \\"Station Quarter\\" with retail and leisure opportunities is envisioned on the land reclaimed from the road closure. ==Criticism== The central portion of the bridgeThere has been a mixed response to the new Mersey crossing, with some people welcoming the new bridge but many bemoaning the costs. Protests were staged; opposing the decision to implement tolls on both crossings before the new bridge opened. Campaigners believe the extra transport costs will have a detrimental effect on the area and its economy. Taxi drivers have complained that the toll will prove unpopular with their customers, because it will mean fare rises. In the first month of opening, more than 50,000 drivers received a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN). Some claimed to be unaware of how to pay the toll, since no signage of how to pay was evident, nor a telephone number supplied to pay the toll. One driver who repeatedly used the bridge without paying the toll received 28 PCNs; totalling £616. After claims that Merseyflow was in breach of both the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008, their PCNs were quashed on appeal in favour of a payment of £56 for the crossings made. On 10 April 2018 it was announced that the outcome of an appeal against penalty charges heard by the Traffic Penalty Tribunal had concluded that the establishment of tolls and charges had not been properly implemented, as the Council had failed to correctly follow the required commencement processes, and failed to properly specify the charges for use. The Council's appeal was turned down, leading to annulment of charge notices in the period that the signage onto the bridge didn't comply with stated regulations. During the Covid-19 lockdown period in 2020, an application by Halton Borough Council to suspend tolling operations was made to support key workers. This was rejected by the Department for Transport despite the broad support of local MPs in March and again in April 2020.https://www.cheshire-live.co.uk/news/chester- cheshire-news/push-axe-mersey-gateway-tolls-18063175 == References  External links == *Mersey Gateway website *Detailed project description *Scrap Mersey Tolls – The main protest group on Facebook Category:Bridges in Cheshire Category:Buildings and structures in Runcorn Category:Buildings and structures in Widnes Category:Cable-stayed bridges in England Category:Redevelopment projects in Liverpool Category:River Mersey Category:Road bridges in England Category:Toll bridges in England Category:Bridges completed in 2017 ","title":"Mersey Gateway Bridge"},{"id":"19260691","text":"Sir Joshua Reynolds, George Greville, 2nd Earl of Warwick, 1754.

The couple had one son: *George Greville, Lord Brooke (25 March 1772 – 2 May 1786) Lady Greville died in childbirth at the age of 19. On 14 July 1776, Greville married Henrietta Vernon, the daughter of Hon. Richard Vernon and Lady Evelyn Leveson-Gower, at the house of her uncle Earl Gower in Whitehall. They had four children: *Lady Augusta Sophia Greville (d. 2 March 1845), married Heneage Finch, 5th Earl of Aylesford on 23 April 1821 *Maj.-Gen.

He also left office on the Board of Trade in 1774, although he served as recorder of Warwick from 1773 to 1816. He became a colonel in the Warwickshire Fencibles in 1795, and was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire in that year, which office he held until his death on 2 May 1816 in London. He was buried at Warwick on 12 May 1816. The Lives of Celebrated Persons records that \\"the latter part of the Earl's life was in penury, mortification and wretchedness.\\" The Biographical Index to the House of Lords records that \\"this peer has evinced a predominant taste for chymistry, and if we mistake not greatly, a patent for soap for the navy that will not curdle in salt water was taken out in his name.\\" ==Collector and Patron== George Greville was arguably one of the greatest contributors to the Greville Collection at Warwick Castle. His greatest purchase was the infamous Warwick Vase, acquired from his Uncle Sir William Hamilton by 1778. Although he furnished the Castle with several works from Classical Antiquity, his principle interest was in portraits. He amassed in his own words a \\"matchless collection of pictures by Sir Peter Paul Rubens and Sir Anthony Van Dyck\\", several of which are still in the collection at Warwick Castle. The first in- depth inventory of pictures dates from 1809, and records the wide range of pictures amassed by the Earl. However, it is still unclear which paintings were already in his father's collection, and exactly where he sourced the major works from. He was patron to John Higton, it being thought that he was introduced to Higton by his brother Charles Francis Greville, the friend of Higton's patron Lord Sedley (Henry Venables-Vernon, 3rd Baron Vernon). However, it has only recently been understood that Greville's wife, Henrietta Vernon, was the half sister of John FitzPatrick, Lord Gowran (later 2nd Earl of Upper Ossory) via the first Marriage of her Mother (Lady Evelyn Leveson- Gower), and a cousin of Lord Sedley (later Venables-Vernon) via her father Richard Vernon. Therefore, Higton's portraits of Warwick Castle, combined with those of Dogs belonging to George Greville, Lord Sedley, and John Fitzpatrick, perhaps reflect a more intimate relationship with the family, and their circle, than was understood. He was also the first aristocratic patron to George Romney, from whom he commissioned several portraits of his children and two wives. He was most likely to have been introduced to Romney through Richard Cumberland (dramatist), and both probably encouraged him to depart on his travels to Italy in 1772. Although Greville had commissioned Romney to purchase paintings on his behalf in Italy, lack of pictures of quality meant that he returned empty handed. His brother Charles Francis Greville also sat to Romney, and introduced the artist to the muse Emma Hamilton. The offer of a studio in one of the towers of Warwick Castle was later turned down by the artist, who wished to remain in London. ==See also== *Earl of Warwick *List of owners of Warwick Castle ==References * Category:1746 births Category:1816 deaths Category:Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford Greville, George Greville, Lord 2 George Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London Category:Lord- Lieutenants of Warwickshire Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies ","title":"George Greville, 2nd Earl of Warwick"},{"id":"19260694","text":"The Sins is a BBC television series that aired from 24 October 2000 until 5 December 2000.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265755/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast The series centres on Len Green (Pete Postlethwaite), a former bank robber and getaway driver, who has retired from the criminal life and joined the undertakers run by his uncle (Frank Finlay).

Retrieved on August 15, 2010. First opened in 1913, the prison expanded and restructured many times. State Prison Farm was well known as one of the last prisons in the United States to abolish the practice of convict leasing in 1923. In 1955 the first buildings of the East Unit were established, across the Bradford county line to the south. In July 1972, the East Unit became the new Florida State Prison, and the old prison was redesignated as Union Correctional Facility. As of 2016 Union remains one of the largest prisons in the Florida system. It houses a maximum capacity of 2,172 adult male prisoners at a range of security levels (Maximum, Close, Medium, Minimum, and Community). ==HistoryState Prison Farm=== Florida's largest and oldest correctional institution was established in 1913 to house infirm inmates who could not be leased to private businesses. The initial population of the prison was close to 600 inmates, both male and female.Bradford County Telegraph, February 14, 1919 Given the official name of Raiford Penitentiary, the facility was referred to almost exclusively as \\"State Prison Farm\\", as convicts' duties routinely included farming the prison property. The population at the facility remained fairly constant during these early years; the number of inmates needed for the farm would dictate the initial capacity for the prison. In January 1919, Captain J. S. Blitch was appointed warden and attempted to bring about positive change to the facility. The inmates were rewarded for their labors in the field with theatrical productions, and weekly baseball games. However, continued reports of guards beating inmates soured the positive image that Blitch was trying to publicize. Brutal treatment of inmates in the convict lease system would lead to the abandonment of convict lease in 1923. By the early 1920s, the large State Prison Farm property consisted of approximately under cultivation, kept in large part by the prisoners. Also on the property existed a shoe factory that made 10 pairs of shoes per day. Living conditions in the prison were very poor. The women especially lived in horrid conditions, housed separately from the men in overcrowded, wooden dormitories. A 1928 report on the American penal system shows that, of the 1,101 received male prisoners, 674 (61%) were of color and 427 (39%) were white. Segregation existed in all aspects of prison life, from working areas to hospitals to bathrooms. ===Florida State Prison=== Following the abolition of convict lease and the subsequent increase in the inmate population, the prison structure changed. In 1927, a license tag factory was constructed, adding to the already extensive production line of the prison. The Main Housing Unit (\\"The Rock\\") was erected in 1928, a major step in the process of increasing the prison population. This building was kept in use until court order in 1985. (\\"The Rock\\" remained at the prison site unused until demolition in 1999.) By 1932, the inmate population was over 2,000, and a mess hall, auditorium and library had been added. The expanding prison also added a laundry and shirt factory around this time. Shortly after, in 1935, a maximum security building was constructed, the \\"Flat Top\\". This proved vital in the expansion of the center, as from this stage forward the prison would remain a maximum security facility. This was also the year the \\"West Unit\\" was built to house female offenders which remained in use until 1954 when the Florida Correctional Institution in Ocala was opened and all the female inmates were transferred from Raiford to the new facility (the West Unit remained in use as a medical facility until 1968). In 1955, the \\"East Unit\\", a new maximum security facility was completed. The East Unit became a separate institution in July 1972, renamed Florida State Prison. The original prison site became known as Union Correctional Institution. A new Death Row was constructed in 1992, coinciding with the relocation of inmates from the State Prison next door. The present-day facility still uses many of the older buildings. The prison has an eclectic range of facilities, from hearing impaired and elderly accommodation to designated confinement space. The prison also has a variety of living residences, such as cell units, house units and self-contained houses. A 1999 report by the St. Petersburg Times took a detailed look into issues of one sided report of racism and diversity in the Union Correctional Institution. The report stated that more than half of the inmates were black, and more than 75% of the guards were white. This alone was grounds for racial tension. Several officers and inmates reported a clique of racist guards, distinguishable by the cord key chains they would wear. Problems turned out to be far more significant, however, after a review of public records and court files revealed over 100 black agency employees were involved in lawsuits alleging rampant racism and discrimination in the prison system. Perhaps worst of these allegations, a black recreation manager once arrived at his desk to find across his bulletin board the letters \\"KKK\\". The report also included the story of a 1993 incident; inmates on death-row were exposed to a man wearing a KKK-style white sheet walking by their cells. ==Notable inmates== * Dan White (1908–1980), American actor in film and television.

A frame of reference provides a set of coordinates for an observer moving with that frame to make measurements and define physical quantities. The covariance principle states the laws of physics should transform from one frame to another covariantly, that is, according to a representation of the covariance group. Special relativity considers observers in inertial frames, and the covariance group consists of rotations, velocity boosts, and the parity transformation. It is denoted as O(1,3) and is often referred to as Lorentz group. For example, the Maxwell equation with sources, :\\\\partial_\\\\mu F^{\\\\mu u}=4\\\\pi j^ u\\\\,, transforms as a four-vector, that is, under the (1/2,1/2) representation of the O(1,3) group. The Dirac equation, :(i\\\\gamma^\\\\mu\\\\partial_\\\\mu-m)\\\\psi=0\\\\,, transforms as a bispinor, that is, under the (1/2,0)⊕(0,1/2) representation of the O(1,3) group. The covariance principle, unlike the relativity principle, does not imply that the equations are invariant under transformations from the covariance group. In practice the equations for electromagnetic and strong interactions are invariant, while the weak interaction is not invariant under the parity transformation. For example, the Maxwell equation is invariant, while the corresponding equation for the weak field explicitly contains left currents and thus is not invariant under the parity transformation. In general relativity the covariance group consists of all arbitrary (invertible and differentiable) coordinate transformations. == See also == *Manifestly covariant *Relativistic wave equations *Representation theory of the Lorentz group == Notes  References == * Thomas Ryckman, The Reign of Relativity: Philosophy in Physics 1915-1925, Oxford University Press US, 2005, , Category:Concepts in physics ","title":"Covariance group"},{"id":"19260822","text":"Christian \\"Krølle\\" Nielsen or simply Krølle (English: Curly) (born 24 March 1985) is a Danish football player.

The subterranean formation consists of shales and carbonates over 15,000 feet (4,600 m) thick in certain areas. Several preliminary drillings found it could be one of the larger finds of natural gas in U.S. history. == Geography == The Conasauga shale overlies the Rome Formation, and in turn is overlain by the Knox Formation. The Conasauga Shale is present as far south as Talladega County, Alabama, and extends north to Calhoun, Cleburne, St. Clair, Etowah, Cherokee, and DeKalb Counties, and into Northwest Georgia. The Conasauga has one of the thickest shale sections in the world. Total organic content of the shale ranges from 0.5% to 1.5%. The Schlumberger Montage Shale log, filed with the Alabama Oil and Gas Board, calculates gas in place as 330.2 billion feet3 per square mile of gas (3.57 billion m3 per km2) in place for every thickness of shale. This area has a unique subsidence and thrust zone under it that geologist William Thomas has classified as a \\"mushwad\\". ==Natural gas== The Conasauga Shale is a shale gas reservoir, like the Barnett Shale in Texas. The shale is very hard, and until technological advancements as have been honed in the exploration and drilling of the Barnett Shale, it was too costly to extract. The Conasauga Shale is hydro-sensitive, as the shale will absorb water and swell, thereby slowing the flow of gas. Successful drilling of the Conasauga involves utilizing techniques minimizing water use and flow into the open-hole drilling techniques. Casing is normally used only until penetration into the Conasauga, and then left open-hole so that multiple gas layers within the hole may flow to the borehole. === Field history === * Discovery: 1980s * Start of production: 2005 === History and well completion === The J.J. Young 34-2 #1 well in St. Clair County, Alabama (Alabama State Oil and Gas Board Permit No. 4325) was drilled as a joint venture between Amoco and ARCO. This well was spudded on October 30, 1984. The well was initially drilled with air to approximately when it encountered a significant quantity of gas that reportedly required closing the blowout preventer. The engineers for both Amoco and Arco said that the J. J. Young #1 would flow over one million feet3 of gas per day (over 28,000 m3). The well was plugged on February 16, 1985. It was discovered that Amoco did not have title to nine forties around the Young #1 well because the minerals had been severed in 1888. During the late 1980s Michigan Oil Co. acquired in this area. Before Michigan Oil could drill this prospect, they were bought out by Pan-Oak Corp in 1991. In 1993, they drilled the Young #2 well, north of the #1 well. They drilled to a total depth of and were unable to log the well. The driller reported that they had good gas shows. === Dominion === In July 2002, Red Hills Resources started leasing in the Young #1 area. After acquiring approximately , they put together the Big Canoe Prospect package, which was offered to numerous potential industry partners. In late 2004, Red Hills sold 51% of the prospect to Dominion Black Warrior Basin Inc. Dominion took over operations of the prospect and on March 8, 2005 spudded the Dawson 34-3 No. 1 well west of the Young #1 well. After drilling out from under the surface pipe, they encountered their first good gas kick at , which was flared to the pit. The second major gas show was encountered at , when the well exploded with a huge fire ball. The next day, while drilling at , the rig broke down and was down for approximately 30 hours During this time the well was flared to the pit, at an estimated 750 to 1000 million feet3 of gas per day with no apparent pressure draw down. When drilling resumed, it started to rain, and within three hours the roaring gas flare slowed to a lazy flare. At 4:30 PM on March 19, the well encountered its third major gas show when it blew out at . The explosion of a plus fire ball was witnessed by numerous valley residents. === Energen === In January 2006, Energen drilled the Williams 29-12 #1 well southwest of the Dawson #1 well. Immediately after the well was drilled, Energen and Dominion entered a bidding war for the remaining leases in north St. Clair County. The Dominion Andrews 27-14 #3 well was spudded April 20, 2006 and drilled to , where the bit fell three feet and then the well blew out. The rig's blowout preventers could not handle the pressure. Dominion fought the well for three days, during which the rig was at imminent risk of burning down. Their head engineer testified at the Alabama Oil & Gas Board hearing on February 16, 2007: \\"We brought in world- class well control experts to control this well,\\" and \\"The gas encountered presented a significant danger to the drilling rig, the personnel, and it had to be controlled.\\" When the opposing attorney asked him how good the well was, the engineer said, \\"To my knowledge we never put that gas through any type of meter.\\" When asked about pressure information for the well, he falsely responded they had none, though after they got the well under control, they bolted a three-port manifold to the blowout preventer. The well's shut-in pressure was reported at 1,835 psi. The crew opened up all three ports, and the well blew for twelve hours at 1,755 psi flowing pressure with no pressure draw down. When they shut the well in, it returned to 1,835 psi. The size of the ports were not reported, however, it was estimated that the well was flowing at of gas per day. Dominion cemented the drill string in the hole by trying to hang cement at the top of the hole. The cement fell to the bottom of the hole sealing off the good gas zone. The Oakes E23-11 #26 was permitted to a depth of . The well was spudded on February 11, 2007. They set of 9 5/8-inch surface casing. They encountered an excellent gas-filled fracture zone at approximately . This well is hooked up and selling gas. Late afternoon, on May 14, 2007, this well was flowing at 808 million feet3 of gas per day with a flowing tubing pressure of 3000 psi. All the surface equipment was covered in several inches of ice, indicating that some CO2 still remained in the gas. The Burgess E28-11 #58 well, while drilling (on April 12 that year) at kicked so hard that they had to light the flare stack. Dominion prefers to vent the gas but is under orders from the state to flare the gas if it exceeds 300 million feet3 of gas per day. The local residents said it had a vertical flare and roared like a train. On April 14, while drilling at , the well blew out with a ball of fire that went over into the air. It rattled windows over a mile away. After everything settled down, the vertical stack was burning a flare. One report has the well flaring 500 million cubic feet of gas for the first hour. Drilling resumed after three hours. They reached total depth of on April 19, 2007. Energen Resources out of Birmingham, Alabama started buying leases in the St.Clair and Etowah Counties in June 2005. In February 2006, Energen drilled the Williams 19-12-101 well southeast of the Dawson #1. In March 2006, Energen drilled the GAA 23-12 #1 well northeast of the Dawson #1. This well never reached planned total depth due to deviation problems, and was plugged. === Chesapeake Energy === Chesapeake and Energen have a joint venture covering gross, for which Chesapeake reportedly paid Energen $750 per acre, plus a commitment of $30 million for joint drilling and development. Chesapeake and Energen have a non-compete agreement, whereby they share additional acreage acquired by either entity.. === Highmount === Loews Corporation, controlled by the wealthy Tisch family, became a substantial leader in the Conasauga Shale in July 2007 via the purchase of natural gas assets from Dominion. A portion of these purchased assets included all of Dominion Black Warrior Basin, holder of all Dominion's Conasauga Shale assets and a fully owned subsidiary of Dominion. Loews assigned Dominion's Alabama operations to Highmount Exploration. === Northeast Alabama Gas District === Northeast Alabama Gas District's territory covers Talladega, Calhoun, and Cleburne Counties, less the areas inside municipal limits and one small area in the Southern part of Cleburne County currently served by another Gas District. The Gas District's territorial limits begin outside of each incorporated municipality in these three counties and from any municipal pipelines that extent outside the municipalities. The Gas District is a public corporation in the State of Alabama. The District has granted an exclusive franchise for drilling, production and pipeline transportation for natural gas within its territory to a Special District created specifically for this purpose. Owners of mineral rights within this territory desiring their natural gas reserves to be developed have the option to sign an agreement with the Gas District. Royalties provided by the District are equal to 20% of production and are higher than those reportedly being offered by the for-profit operators in surrounding areas. The Gas District has five charitable trusts for education, health care, social services, long-term care and economic development and job creation that receive a portion of the natural gas revenues to provide additional benefits for residents in the region. === Acreage positions === *Northeast Alabama Gas District: provided an exclusive franchise for drilling, development and transportation of natural gas within its territory to sister organization Special District: gross.Calculations on acreage based on the articles for Cleburne County, Talladega County, and Calhoun County, Alabama *Chesapeake–Energen joint venture: gross. *Energen (independent acreage): 126,000 acres (as of February 2007) *Highmount Exploration: unknown.

Thrust straight into Lincoln's first team at centre- forward, Carmichael responded by scoring, on his debut against Scunthorpe United. In his second season at the club, Carmichael made occasional appearances at centre-half as well as centre-forward and spent both the 1991–1992 and 1992–1993 seasons as a virtual ever present at the heart of Lincoln's defence. In 1991/92 he was Lincoln's Player of the Season. In the summer of 1993 he left Lincoln for Scunthorpe United, in a part-exchange deal with Dave Hill. Restored to the forward line at Scunthorpe, Carmichael scored a total of 24 goals, with 18 in the league, during a highly successful 1993–1994 season. He also established a club record when between 28 December 1993 and 19 February 1994 he scored in eight successive matches. However, he struggled to maintain such form the following season and joined Barnet on a month's loan in September 1994 before joining Preston North End in March 1995 for the remainder of the season, briefly playing alongside a young David Beckham. He made a solitary, goalscoring, appearance for Mansfield Town at the start of the 1995–1996 season before linking up with Doncaster Rovers and then, at the end of February, Darlington. He helped Darlington reach the 1996 Endsleigh League Division Three play-off final where they were defeated 1–0 by Plymouth Argyle on 25 May 1996 at Wembley Stadium. ==Post League career== Following his release by Darlington, Carmichael played four games for TPS Turku in the Finnish Veikkausliiga, and he scored one goal for them, on 30 June 1996 against HJK Helsinki. He then joined Aylesbury United, and he scored on his debut for them in the 2–1 away defeat to Hitchin Town on 17 August 1996. His last game for the Ducks was on 12 April 1997 against Heybridge Swifts. Carmichael then linked up with Ilkeston Town, under the management of the man who transferred him from Lincoln, Keith Alexander. Carmichael later played for Boston United in the 1998/99 season (where he scored 20 times in 34 matches), and had a 10-game spell with Grantham Town in the 1999–2000 season. He later joined Wisbech Town, then under the management of his former Boston United teammate Ian Stringfellow, debuting in the 1–1 home draw with Histon on 26 September 2000. However, after just five league games and one goal for the Fenman, financial constraints saw six of the squad, Carmichael included, depart the club following the 2–0 home defeat to Newport IOW on 21 October 2000. Carmichael moved on to Lincoln United but a persistent back injury curtailed his appearances and he wound his career down with various clubs in the Lincoln & District Sunday League.A number of sources list Carmichael as having gone on to play for the likes of Little Oakley, Harwich & Parkeston, Wivenhoe Town, Maldon Town and Halstead Town. This is a case of mistaken identity with the former Norwich City youth player Matt Carmichael. After being kit manager at Lincoln City he was appointed in May 2012 as manager at Lincoln Moorlands Railway but he left the club after three months. ==References/Notes * *Doncaster Rovers Profile Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:English footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Association football defenders Category:English Football League players Category:Veikkausliiga players Category:Salisbury City F.C. players Category:Wycombe Wanderers F.C. players Category:Basingstoke Town F.C. players Category:Bromley F.C. players Category:Lincoln City F.C. players Category:Scunthorpe United F.C. players Category:Barnet F.C. players Category:Preston North End F.C. players Category:Mansfield Town F.C. players Category:Darlington F.C. players Category:Turun Palloseura footballers Category:Aylesbury United F.C. players Category:Ilkeston Town F.C.

The Northampton and Leicester operations were town based networks, like Grampian. ==Livery== As GRT Group, the company had developed a form of corporate livery dictated by an arrangement of a horizontal and diagonal bands over a base colour. The colour scheme of the bands were derived from colours representative of the subsidiary company, while the base colour was chosen as cream. Lowland Scottish, however, opted to use yellow for its base colour. The companies retained their own version of a company logo. Some companies developed an alternate livery with a gold band for the introduction of new buses. With the formation of FirstBus, the former GRT companies retained its corporate livery, with the individual company logos replaced with the company name in a new standard corporate typeface, along with a stylised f symbol representing FirstBus. ==References== Category:First Group Category:Former bus operators in Scotland Category:3i Group companies Category:1989 establishments in Scotland Category:1995 disestablishments in Scotland Category:Former bus operators in Northamptonshire Category:Former bus operators in Leicestershire Category:Former bus operators in Norfolk Category:Former bus operators in Suffolk Category:Former bus operators in Cambridgeshire ","title":"GRT Group"},{"id":"19260913","text":"Station is a tram station in Kōchi, Japan. ==Lines== *Tosa Electric Railway **Gomen Line ==Adjacent stations== - !colspan=5Tosa Electric Railway ==External links== Category:Railway stations in Kōchi Prefecture Category:Railway stations in Japan opened in 1993 ","title":"Kenritsubijutsukan-dōri Station"},{"id":"19260917","text":"A view of French Beach, Karachi French Beach of Karachi is located half way between Hawkes Bay and Paradise Point, is a small fishing village frequented by Karachi's elite and known to the locals as Haji Ismill Goth.

Many of the 165 contributing properties date from the 1820-1930 period when the Erie Canal and Harmony Mills were the mainstay of the city's economy. It was recognized as a historic district and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. After years of neglect and decline, it has recently started to see an upswing in business activity due to its historic character and the city's efforts to protect it. It is a roughly triangular area encompassing most of the city's business district, along the axes of Ontario and Remsen streets. Most of its buildings are contributing properties, with only a few late 20th-century intrusions; most of those are residential or commercial and in-use but they also include several churches, factories, a train station and the city hall. They range in architectural styles from Federal to Art Moderne. One building within the district, Cohoes Music Hall, was listed on the National Register before the creation of the district. Another National Register listing, the Silliman Memorial Presbyterian Church, was demolished in 1998. A similar fate befell a church building designed by Richard Upjohn after it burned in 1894, but its rectory survives. ==Geography== The district is bounded by Oneida Street on the north and the former Delaware and Hudson Railroad (now CP Rail) tracks on the east. On the west it takes the form of an irregular diagonal beginning at the intersection of Columbia and Remsen streets at the southeast, cutting through the middle of several blocks, and ending at Ontario and Olmstead streets in the northeast. Directly adjacent to this northeastern corner is the separately-designated Olmstead Street Historic District, which includes the Ogden Mill and row houses built for textile workers, a short distance to the northeast. To the north and east flow the Mohawk and Hudson rivers, respectively. Most of the land in the district is developed in the form of commercial and industrial buildings, with a few churches and Cohoes's city hall. There are some vacant lots on the edges, most notably the former canal bed at the northeast corner. The land is relatively level, reflecting the nearby river confluence. The main route through the district is NY 470, which follows Ontario Street. It leads east to Troy across the river via the 112th Street Bridge and west to Colonie. The north-south routes 32 and 787 are located along the Hudson, just to the immediate east of the district. ==History== From its settlement in the 17th century through the years after independence, Cohoes was a quiet farming community inhabited by a few families of Dutch descent. When outsiders came to Cohoes, it was to see the Cohoes Falls along the Mohawk, the source of the town's name. The construction of the canal from 1817 to 1832 changed that. There were less than 25 buildings in the current district before 1831, but industrialization had already begun with some mills along the Mohawk. One, the Cohoes Company, began building the smaller local canal system that would provide power to many of the early businesses. By 1837 the canal had been so successful that the company spent five years acquiring land for and then building the newer Enlarged Erie Canal, to handle larger shipping. The route, and several locks, can still be seen and followed from the northeast corner of the district to Lock 18 near the western city limit. Main Street today follows the original canal bed. In the northern part of the city, former land of the original Erie Canal was reacquired in 1846 by the Cohoes Company for its local power canal system. The canal's success led to the population of the town doubling in the 1840s, and a corresponding building boom. As a result, the town incorporated as a village, electing its first board in 1848. At this time most of today's streets were mapped and laid out. The district was the only developed area of town; it was surrounded by farmland. The railroad was built, further extending the reach of local industry and creating more jobs. In the second half of the century, particularly once the Civil War had ended, the textile industry's growth in the town fueled another boom. The first mill, the Troy Manufacturing Co., was opened on Ontario Street in 1843. It was thought to be the first in the country devoted to manufacturing hosiery and knit products. It failed within a decade, but a new owner took over and Cohoes went from three mills in 1852 to 27 by 1886, employing 4,000 people. The thousand-foot (300 m) Harmony Mills complex was the world's largest cotton processing facility when it opened in 1872, and later came to be identified with the town. Housing along Canvass Street, built during the late 19th century The earlier growth expanded, and by 1870 11,100 had settled in the village. That year it reincorporated as a city. The new construction, and reconstruction and expansion of existing properties, brought new homes and churches to the downtown area. One of the latter, St. John's Episcopal Church, was designed by Richard Upjohn, the architect of many of America's notable churches from that era, and built in 1870. It was destroyed by fire a quarter-century later, and replaced by a newer building but its rectory remains in use. The Music Hall, the district's best Second Empire-style building, was opened in 1874. Kansas state architect J.C. Holland designed the Romanesque/Chateauesque City Hall in 1896. It was complemented by the Romanesque Silliman Memorial Presbyterian Church (since demolished), named by local benefactor Horace Silliman for his parents and opened the same year just across the street. Downtown was mostly built out by the start of the 20th century, but there are still some notable bank buildings from that period in the contemporary Classical Revival style. Construction slowed after World War I, reflecting the decline of the industries that had fueled the city's growth in the previous century. The Mechanics' Bank and Cohoes Theatre, the latter designed and built in the 1930s (although not opened until 1941), are the only buildings downtown in the ModerneModerne style. The onset of the Great Depression in the 1930s halted all construction and put an end to Cohoes' days as an industrial center. At the same time, it meant that no alterations would take place to existing buildings, leaving them intact (if often vacant and neglected) for when the district was added to the Register 50 years later. A planned revitalization in the 1970s and '80s to create an urban mall similar to those in Amsterdam and Batavia, which would have meant demolishing or altering many of the older buildings, was never fully implemented. ==Significant contributing properties== All but ten of the 175 properties within the district are considered sufficiently historic to be contributing to its overall character. They include residences, commercial buildings (including some factories) churches, the city hall, post office and former train station. ===Residential=== *2-4 White Street, an 1820s Federal style frame house, is one of the few pre-industrial buildings in the district and among the oldest houses in Cohoes. *Van Auken House, 115 Mohawk Street. This was the home of textile executive David Van Auken, a brick Second Empire home with exceptional Eastlake detail, a touch rare in Cohoes, built in 1873. *St. John's Episcopal Church Rectory, 169 Mohawk Street. A brick and stone hipped- roofed building designed in 1870 by Richard Upjohn's firm in the Victorian Gothic style, it survives the parent church, destroyed in an 1894 fire. ===Commercial/Industrial=== Music Hall main entrance *205 Remsen Street. Three-story, six-bay building with dentil molding erected in the 1840s during canal boom is the largest Federal-style building remaining in the district. *Carter Block, 57-63 Remsen Street. 1850 building with square pilasters, frieze, modillioned cornice and parapet railing is the best Greek Revival building in district. *Cohoes Savings Bank, 75 Remsen Street. Well-developed Beaux-Arts bank building built in 1904 and expanded 19 years later. *Cohoes Music Hall, 58 Remsen Street. The one outstanding Second Empire building in the district, dating to 1874 and listed on the National Register in its own right in 1971. Four-story brick building with mansard roof, hood moldings, stone courses and marble storefront is one of the most ornate and best- preserved commercial facades in the district. *Cohoes Theatre, White and Remsen streets. Only major building in district in ModerneArt Moderne style, with typical overhanging multiple hipped roof. *Delaware and Hudson Railroad Station, 127 Canvass Street. Well-preserved 1883 Queen Anne building *Troy Manufacturing Mill, 302 Ontario Street. Four-story gabled mill was the first textile mill in the city when built in 1843 and possibly the first mill in the country that manufactured hosiery and knit products. ===Institutional=== City Hall *City Hall, Ontario and Mohawk streets.Romanesque/Chateauesque building designed by J.C. Holland in 1895 has long been a city landmark. Features grey limestone in smooth-coursed ashlar alternating with bands of more rougher facing, conical-roofed round towers and ornamental crests and finials. *St. Bernard's Roman Catholic Church, 107 Ontario Street. Large brick Romanesque church, built in the 1860s, has an enclosed garden. Originally had a spire that collapsed during an 1875 storm. *St. John's Episcopal Church, now the Cohoes Public Library, 169 Mohawk Street. Incorporates remaining manse from destroyed Richard Upjohn design. ===Demolished=== *Silliman Memorial Presbyterian Church, Ontario and Mohawk streets. Facing city hall and built the same year, this Romanesque Revival sandstone structure was an excellent example of the style. It was listed on the National Register in 1971 but was demolished in 1998. ==Preservation and renewal== The historic buildings have been attractive to some redevelopers as the city continues efforts to recover from the decline of its major industries and redefine itself as a bedroom community for Albany. \\"The revitalization of Remsen Street is the keystone to the City's future success\\", said a 2002 city plan for improving and revitalizing downtown. It recommended a $3.1 million plan to improve the streets and lighting in the district, with an emphasis on preserving or restoring its historic character. The city has made some grants available for facade restoration and improvements to the rental properties above the storefronts with the goal of promoting a mix of uses among office, residential and retail., City of Cohoes, 20, retrieved September 15, 2008. The Capital District Transportation Committee did a study that used the downtown historic district in its \\"Linkage\\" program as one of three \\"corridors\\" in Cohoes in which it recommended changes that could be made to stimulate redevelopment. Within three years during the 2000s the value of construction projects with city issued building permits increased almost fivefold. Many of the businesses that have located in the city have been niche and specialty retailers. By 2006, there was over a million dollars in private investment downtown. A Rite Aid was built on the lot at the west edge of the district known as Bush's Block, on the site of the former Victor Carrybag building. In 2007 the city began hosting a farmers' market on Remsen Street during growing season. To ensure that new construction preserves the character of the historic district, the city has enacted a \\"historic overlay district\\" within its zoning code which includes all the city's historic areas.City of Cohoes Zoning Map , September 2006, retrieved September 11, 2008. The code requires that any new construction or redevelopment affecting an exterior or interior space visible from outside be approved by the city's Historic Preservation and Architectural Review Board, to ensure that contributing properties '\\"historic features [will be] altered as little as possible.\\"Cohoes City Code, § 285-44(G)(1)(a). ==References== Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:Erie Canal parks, trails, and historic sites Category:Cohoes, New York Category:Historic districts in Albany County, New York Category:National Register of Historic Places in Albany County, New York ","title":"Downtown Cohoes Historic District"},{"id":"19260945","text":"The Royal Barcelona Yacht Club (, ) is a member-only yacht club based in Barcelona.

On January 16, 2002, the flight encountered severe thunderstorm activity during approach to its destination, suffered flameout in both engines, and ditched in a shallow river, resulting in one fatality and several injuries. ==Aircraft and crew== The aircraft, a Boeing 737-3Q8, registration PK-GWA, was manufactured in 1988 and delivered in 1989. It was the first 737 flown by Garuda Indonesia. On this flight, it was flown by Captain Abdul Rozaq (44) and first officer Harry Gunawan (46). Captain Rozaq had logged 14,020 flight hours including 5,086 hours on the Boeing 737. First Officer Gunawan had 7,137 flight hours. ==Accident== As the Boeing 737-300 aircraft was on approach to its destination, the pilots were confronted with substantial thunderstorm activity visible ahead and on their onboard weather radar. They attempted to fly between two intense weather cells visible on their radar. They later entered a thunderstorm containing heavy rain and hail. About 90 seconds later, as the aircraft was descending through , both CFM International CFM56 engines experienced a flameout, which resulted in the loss of all generated electrical power. Both engines were set at their flight-idle power setting before flameout occurred. The crew tried unsuccessfully to restart the engines two or three times. They then tried but failed to start the auxiliary power unit (APU), at which time total electrical power loss occurred. (During the later investigation, the NiCd battery was found to have been in poor condition due to inadequate maintenance procedures.) First officer Gunawan attempted to transmit a Mayday call, but was unable to. As the aircraft descended through the lower layer of clouds at approximately , the pilots saw the Bengawan Solo River and decided to attempt to ditch in the river with the flaps and gear retracted. The ditch procedure was successful, leaving the aircraft settled down on its belly in the shallow water, with the fuselage, wings and control surfaces largely intact. There was no fire. ==Evacuation and rescue== Only two doors were available for evacuation. Residents of nearby villages assisted. Uninjured passengers and their personal belongings were temporarily sheltered in a nearby empty house, while injured passengers were transported by an available vehicle to the nearest clinic. After evacuation, the pilot contacted the Jogja Tower via cellphone and reported the emergency landing and location. The rescue team arrived about two hours later and all remaining passengers and crew were taken safely to a hospital. ==Aircraft damage and injuries== There was severe damage to the submerged aircraft belly, especially near the tail, leading to the inference that it landed nose high with tail impacting the shallow river bed, which ripped away the cabin floor together with the two flight attendants seated there. Both were found with severe injuries in the river behind the aircraft, and one did not survive. Twelve passengers suffered injuries, while the flight crew and other two flight attendants were injured. The aircraft was written off as a total loss, making the accident the 11th hull loss and eighth fatal accident involving the Boeing 737-300. ==NTSC investigation and report== The final report of the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) notes that pilot training in the interpretation of weather radar images was not formal, being given only during flight training. It is considered possible that the precipitation was so dense that it attenuated the radar signals, reducing the reflections that usually indicate precipitation and making such high density appear to be a clearer path. Had the crew manipulated the radar tilt to sweep the ground during descent, they would have been aware of the risks associated with the chosen flight path. Intense noise audible in data from the cockpit voice recorder as well as damage to the nose radome and engines indicate the presence of hail with the rain. The report concludes that the hail/water density exceeded the engine tolerance at flight idle, resulting in flameout. ==Remarks by U.S. NTSB== A later Safety Recommendation letter from the U.S. NTSB to the FAA notes that analyses of flight recorder data and weather satellite images indicate that the aircraft had already entered a thunderstorm cell at the start of the diversion to avoid the storm. It also notes that the procedure recommended in the Boeing 737 Operations Manual to respond to a dual flameout is to first start the APU (which could then provide much more power to start the main engines). Furthermore, repeating a comment in the NTSC report, the letter notes Boeing's advice that, in moderate to severe rain, starting main engines can take up to three minutes to spool up to idle, whereas the pilots allowed only one minute before initiating another retry. However, the battery on the stricken aircraft was found to have been faulty, holding only 22 volts before the flameout occurred when a fully charged battery should have 24 volts. The fact that the battery was faulty before the flameout meant the pilots’ futile attempts to restart the engines all but drained the remaining power from an already damaged battery, resulting in there being no power to start the auxiliary power unit, which explains the total loss of electrical power, even after the plane left the storm. There was simply no power to restart the engines or start the APU. The letter from the NTSB also recommends to the FAA that pilots be advised to maintain a higher engine power level in moderate to severe precipitation to avoid flameout. ==Aftermath== Garuda Indonesia no longer operates this route in 2005. It still uses the flight number GA-421, but on the Denpasar – Jakarta route instead, operated by an Airbus A330 or a 777-300ER. Garuda Indonesia also funded local road construction nearby the accident area and also built a multipurpose hall and reservoir facility in thanks for local villagers' assistance when evacuating. ==Dramatization== The crash was dramatized in the 16th season of the TV series Mayday - also re-packaged as Air Disasters - in an episode entitled \\"River Runway\\". ==See also== *TACA Flight 110 – Similar incident with same aircraft type, dual engine flameout when passing through thunderstorm *US Airways Flight 1549 – Similar incident, dual engine flameout due to birdstrike *Southern Airways Flight 242 – Similar incident involving a DC-9, dual engine flameout due to rain/ hail ingestion *Water landing *Emergency landing *CFM56 engine design flaw – Engine flaw involving flameout after intake of heavy amounts of rain/ hail ==References *Final report (Alternate) – National Transportation Safety Committee (Archive) *Safety Recommendation (Alternate) – National Transportation Safety Board (Archive) *Aviation Safety Network accident description Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Boeing 737 Classic Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by engine failure Category:Airliner accidents and incidents involving ditching Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2002 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Indonesia Flight 421 Category:Solo River Category:2002 in Indonesia Category:January 2002 events in Asia ","title":"Garuda Indonesia Flight 421"},{"id":"19260962","text":"Offshore concrete structures have been in use successfully for about 30 years. They serve the same purpose as their steel counterparts in the oil and gas production and storage. The first concrete oil platform has been installed in the North Sea in the Ekofisk field in 1973 by Phillips Petroleum. Since then 47 major concrete offshore structures have been built, whereby 21 of the 47 concrete substructures have been designed (concept and detail designs ) by Dr. techn. Olav Olsen. == Introduction == Concrete offshore structures are mostly used in the petroleum industry as drilling, extraction or storage units for crude oil or natural gas. Those large structures house machinery and equipment needed to drill and/or extract oil and gas. But concrete structures are not only limited to applications within the oil and gas industry. Several conceptual studies have shown recently, that concrete support structures for offshore wind turbines are very competitive compared to common steel structures, especially for larger water depths. Depending on the circumstances, platforms may be attached to the ocean floor, consist of an artificial island, or be floating. Generally, offshore concrete structures are classified into fixed and floating structures. Fixed structures are mostly built as concrete gravity based structures (CGS, also termed as caisson type), where the loads bear down directly on the uppermost layers as soil pressure. The caisson provides buoyancy during construction and towing and acts also as a foundation structure in the operation phase. Furthermore, the caisson could be used as storage volume for oil or other liquids. Floating units may be held in position by anchored wires or chains in a spread mooring pattern. Because of the low stiffness in those systems, the natural frequency is low and the structure can move in all six degrees of freedom. Floating units serve as productions units, storage and offloading units (FSO) or for crude oil or as terminals for liquefied natural gas (LNG). A more recent development is concrete sub-sea structures. Concrete offshore structures show an excellent performance. They are highly durable, constructed of almost maintenance-free material, suitable for harsh and/or arctic environment (like ice and seismic regions), can carry heavy topsides, often offer storage capacities, are suitable for soft grounds and are very economical for water depths larger than 150m. Most gravity-type platforms need no additional fixing because of their large foundation dimensions and extremely high weight. == Fixed structures == Since the 1970s, several fixed concrete platform designs have been developed. Most of the designs have in common a base caisson (normally for storage of oil) and shafts penetrating the water surface to carry the topside. In the shafts normally utility systems for offloading, drilling, draw down and ballast are put up. Concrete offshore platforms of the gravity-base type are almost always constructed in their vertical attitude. This allows the inshore installation of deck girders and equipment and the later transport of the whole structure to the installation site. The most common concrete designs are: * Condeep (with one, two, three or four columns) * ANDOC (with four columns) * Sea Tank (with two or four columns) * C G Doris * Arup Concrete Gravity Substructure (CGS) === Condeep Type === Condeep refers to a make of gravity base structure for oil platforms developed and fabricated by Norwegian Contractors in Norway. Condeep usually consists of a base of concrete oil storage tanks from which one, three or four concrete shafts rise. The original Condeep always rests on the sea floor, and the shafts rise to about 30m above the sea level. The platform deck itself is not a part of the construction. The Condeep Platforms Brent B (1975) and Brent D (1976) were designed for a water depth of 142m in the Brent oilfield operated by Shell. Their main mass is represented by the storage tank (ca. 100m diameter and 56m high, consisting of 19 cylindrical compartments with 20m diameter). Three of the cells are extended into shafts tapering off at the surface and carrying a steel deck. The tanks serve as storage of crude oil in the operation phase. During the installation these tanks have been used as ballast compartment. Among the largest Condeep type platform are the Troll A platform and the Gullfaks C. Troll A was built within four years and deployed in 1995 to produce gas from the Troll oil field which was developed by Norske Shell, since 1996 operated by Statoil. A detailed overview about Condeep platforms is given in a separate article. Concrete Gravity Base Structures (CGBS) is a further development of the first-generation Condeep drilling/production platforms installed in the North Sea between the late 1970s and mid '90s. The CGBS have no oil storage facilities and the topside installations will be carried out in the field by a float-over mating method. Current or most recent projects are: * Sakhalin-II platforms (Molikpaq (Piltun-Astokhskoye A; PA-A) platform, Piltun-Astokhskoye B (PA-B) platform and Lunskoye (LUN-A) platform) * Malampaya * Wandoo * Benjamin Nathanael === C G DORIS Type === The first concrete gravity platform in the North Sea was a C G Doris platform, the Ekofisk Tank, in Norwegian waters. The structure has a shape not unlike a marine sea island and is surrounded by a perforated breakwater wall (Jarlan patent). The original proposal of the French group C G DORIS (Compagnie General pour les Developments Operationelles des Richesses Sous-Marines) for a prestressed post-tensioned concrete \\"island\\" structure was adopted on cost and operational grounds. DORIS was general contractor responsible for the structural design: the concrete design was prepared and supervised on behalf of DORIS by Europe- Etudes. Further example for the C G DORIS designs are the Frigg platforms, the Ninian Central Platform and the Schwedeneck platforms. The design typically consists of a large volume caisson based on the sea floor merging into a monolithic structure, which is offering the base for the deck. The single main leg is surrounded by an outer breaker wall perforated with so called Jarlan holes. This wall is intended to break up waves, thus reducing their forces. === McAlpine/Sea Tank === This design is quite similar to the Condeep type. === ANDOC Type === To achieve its goal and extract oil within five years after discovering the Brent reservoir Shell divided up the construction of four offshore platforms. Redpath Dorman Long at Methil in Fife, Scotland getting Brent A, the two concrete Condeeps B and D were to be built in Norway by Norwegian Contractors (NC) of Stavanger, and C (also concrete) was to be built by McAlpine at Ardyne Point on the Clyde (which is known as the ANDOC (Anglo Dutch Offshore Concrete) design). The ANDOC design can be considered as the British construction industry's attempt to compete with Norway in this sector. McAlpine constructed three concrete platforms for the North Sea oil industry at Ardyne Point. The ANDOC type is very similar to the Sea Tank design, but the four concrete legs terminate and steel legs take over to support the deck. === Arup Concrete Gravity Substructure (CGS) === The Arup dry-build Concrete Gravity Substructure (CGS) concept was originally developed by Arup in 1989 for Hamilton Brothers' Ravenspurn North. The Arup CGS are designed to be simple to install, and are fully removable. Simplicity and repetition of concrete structural elements, low reinforcement and pre-stress densities as well as the use of normal density concrete lead to economical construction costs. Typical for the Arup CGS is the inclined installation technique. This technique helps to maximise economy and provide a robust offshore emplacement methodology. Further projects have been the Malampaya project in the Philippines and the Wandoo Full Field Development on the North West Shelf of Western Australia. == Floating structures == Since concrete is quite resistant to corrosion from salt water and keeps maintenance costs low, floating concrete structures have become increasingly attractive to the oil and gas industry in the last two decades. Temporary floating structures such as the Condeep platforms float during construction but are towed out and finally ballasted until they sit on the sea floor. Permanent floating concrete structures have various uses including the discovery of oil and gas deposits, in oil and gas production, as storage and offloading units and in heavy lifting systems. Common designs for floating concrete structures are the barge or ship design, the platform design (semi-submersible, TLP) as well as the floating terminals e.g. for LNG. Floating production, storage, and offloading systems (FPSOS) receive crude oil from deep-water wells and store it in their hull tanks until the crude is transferred into tank ships or transport barges. In addition to FPSO’s, there have been a number of ship-shaped Floating Storage and Offloading (FSO) systems (vessels with no production processing equipment) used in these same areas to support oil and gas developments. An FSO is typically used as a storage unit in remote locations far from pipelines or other infrastructures. === Semi-Submersible === Semi-submersible marine structures are typically only movable by towing. Semi-submersible platforms have the principal characteristic of remaining in a substantially stable position, presenting small movements when they experience environmental forces such as the wind, waves and currents. Semi-Submersible platforms have pontoons and columns, typically two parallel spaced apart pontoons with buoyant columns upstanding from those pontoons to support a deck. Some of the semi-submersible vessels only have a single caisson, or column, usually denoted as a buoy while others utilize three or more columns extended upwardly from buoyant pontoons. For activities which require a stable offshore platform, the vessel is then ballasted down so that the pontoons are submerged, and only the buoyant columns pierce the water surface - thus giving the vessel a substantial buoyancy with a small water-plane area. The only concrete semi-submersible in existence is Troll B. === Tension Leg Platform (TLP) === A Tension Leg Platform is a buoyant platform, which is held in place by a mooring system. TLP mooring is different to conventional chained or wire mooring systems. The platform is held in place with large steel tendons fastened to the sea floor. Those tendons are held in tension by the buoyancy of the hull. Statoil's Heidrun TLP is the only one with a concrete hull, all other TLPs have steel hulls. === Barge/Ship Design === FPSO or FSO systems are typically barge/ship- shaped and store crude oil in tanks located in the hull of the vessel. Their turret structures are designed to anchor the vessel, allow “weathervaning” of the units to accommodate environmental conditions, permit the constant flow of oil and production fluids from vessel to undersea field, all while being a structure capable of quick disconnect in the event of emergency. The first barge of prestressed concrete has been designed in the early 1970s as an LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) storage barge in the Ardjuna Field (Indonesia). This barge is built of reinforced and prestressed concrete containing cylindrical tanks each having a cross-section perpendicular to its longitudinal axes that comprises a preferably circular curved portion corresponding to the bottom. == Major offshore concrete structures == Following table summarizes the major existing offshore concrete structures. {  border=\\"1\\" !

In the 2011 census the population of the civil parish was 472. Village facilities include the Anglican church of St Peter's, a primary school, the Sycamore Inn (containing a public house and village shop), the village memorial hall (established in 1962 and rebuilt in 2010), the Royal British Legion club house (established 1951), a hard surfaced play area, a bowling green and a cricket pitch. ==History== Parwich is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Pevrewic under Derbyshire in the lands belonging to the King.King William held a number of notable manors in Derbyshire including Weston-on-Trent, Melbourne, and Newton Solney. The book, which was written in 1086, said: Domesday noted that Parwich together with the manors of Darley, Matlock, Wirksworth and Ashbourne and their berewicks rendered TRETempore Regis Edward ie in the time of King Edward before the Norman Conquest in 1066 32 pounds and 6.5 sesters of honey. Now 40 pounds of pure silver. ===Manor=== Parwich was part of the ancient Crown lands and after the Conquest was granted to the Ferrers, Earls of Derby. Robert de Ferrers took a prominent part in the Montford Rebellion against the king, and Edward I seized his lands. The king gave the manor to Edmund Crouchback, Earl of Lancaster, and it became part of the Duchy of Lancaster held by the Cokayne family of Ashbourne Hall. In 1603 it was sold to Thomas Levinge and remained in his family until 1814 when it was sold to William Evans. The Levinge family built Parwich Hall in 1747 but were frequently absent. After 1892, the estate was split between the Carrs and the Gisbornes. After World War One, the estate was sold to the Inglefields who sold it in the 1970s. The school and St Peter's Church, Parwich were erected by Sir Thomas William Evans in 1861 and 1873, although elements of the rebuilt church date back to Norman times and the church tympanum is thought to have pre-Norman origins. Evans owned Parwich Hall, possibly as a summer retreat from his home in Derby. It was bought in 1814 by William Evans, Thomas's father, who was a Derbyshire MP, but was in use as a vicarage by 1841. ==Governance== Historically Parwich was a township, parish and village in the Western division of the county, part of the ancient Wirksworth hundred, and part of the Ashbourne Poor Law Union which came into existence in January 1845. ==Geography== Parwich is a village six miles north of Ashbourne. It is surrounded by fields and hills; the nearest main road is the Ashbourne to Bakewell road over a mile away; the Ashbourne to Buxton road is more than two miles away. The houses are built of local limestone and many stand around an open green, through which runs the stream which gave the village its name. The Peak District Boundary Walk runs north–south through the village, and the Limestone Way long-distance bridleway passes west–east. ==Residents== *Joseph Hawley (1603–1690), first member of the Hawley family to arrive to North America, to New England in 1629. ==References * PARWICH.ORG: official village website and community blog * St. Peter's Church, Parwich * Parwich Memorial Hall Category:Villages in Derbyshire Category:Towns and villages of the Peak District Category:Civil parishes in Derbyshire Category:Derbyshire Dales ","title":"Parwich"},{"id":"19261008","text":"Northeast Forestry University (NEFU; ), located in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, is an institution of higher education and research under jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, serve as the largest forestry university in China and a key university within the scope of national \\"211 Project\\".

It specializes in providing WCMS to educational institutions throughout the world. The company has offices in key locations throughout the world; North American HQ in Boston, European HQ in Dublin, Sales offices in London and Asia-Pacific HQ in Sydney. ==Company history== TERMINALFOUR was founded in 1996 by current CEO Piero Tintori. It competed principally in the Irish and UK markets before securing investment of €1.6 million in 2010 to support its strategy for international growth. This enabled it to “expand its focus to the US market in addition to Europe”. In 2010, a United States office was opened in Boston. TERMINALFOUR clients include the Irish Central Statistics Office, Permanent TSB, Specsavers, Aer Lingus and over 100 US and British government authorities and educational institutes == Site Manager == The company's principal product is TERMINALFOUR Site Manager. The aim of the product is make it really easy for organizations to deliver and manage very large, highly devolved, multilingual Websites, Intranets and Extranets. The company invested €900,000 in research and gathered extensive feedback from partners and incorporated it into the development of Site Manager 7.0. The launch of Site Manager 7.0 led to a “record breaking year” for TERMINALFOUR. While the company still has a “stronghold” within the UK and Irish markets, in 2011, the U.S. market accounted for 38% of new business revenue in the previous business year. TERMINALFOUR Site Manager 7.2 (launched in April 2012) offers multi-platform support and allows thousands of content creators around the world to collaborate on projects by enabling web content management servers to talk to each other. The updated product received a favourable review from industry watching website CMS Wire. TERMINALFOUR Site Manager is supported across all browsers. == Criticism == As a proprietary product, TERMINALFOUR is seen by some adopters as expensive in terms of cost and security. In terms of cost, the \\"On premises\\" licence starts at $15,000 with development of your custom CMS extra to this. In terms of security, since the source code is not made publicly available, it is impossible to know how secure the platform is, unlike with open source CMS solutions (which may be more or less secure). == Community == TERMINALFOUR created an extranet that gives users a platform to share ideas, discuss the product and offer feedback. The online community, which has grown and developed throughout its existence acts as a shared resource, as it hosts thousands of pages of user guides, informational documents and community groups. Since 2008, TERMINALFOUR has hosted an annual event for users, clients and partners called T44U: Global User Conference.

She was Emperor Daizong's favorite concubine and, while she never became empress in her lifetime, she dominated inside the palace. He posthumously honored her as empress after her death in 775. == Background == It is not known when the future Consort Dugu was born, or where her family was from. Her father Dugu Ying (獨孤穎) was an officer in the imperial guard corps. She became a concubine of Li Chu, then the Prince of Guangping under his father Emperor Suzong, in or shortly after 757, when his then-dominant consort Consort Wei died.New Book of Tang, vol. 77 . It was said that she was exceedingly beautiful and drew his favor to the exclusion of all other consorts, and that after her entry into the palace, the other consorts were rarely able to have sexual relations with him. == As imperial consort == After Li Chu, whose name had been changed to Li Yu by that point, became emperor in 762 (as Emperor Daizong), Consort Dugu was given the imperial consort rank of Guifei (貴妃) in 768Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 224.—the highest rank among imperial consorts,New Book of Tang, vol. 76 . but not the rank of empress, and it was said that it was for her that Emperor Daizong never made anyone else empress. The modern Chinese historian Bo Yang suggested that the reason was that Emperor Daizong did not want to endanger the position of his oldest son Li Kuo, who was crown prince.Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 54 [780].) Consort Dugu bore Emperor Daizong two children—Li Jiong (李迥), who was created the Prince of Han in 762 due to the favor that Consort Dugu was enjoying while most of his other brothers were not created imperial princes until 775,Old Book of Tang, vol. 116 and Princess Huayang, who was herself said to be favored by Emperor Daizong greatly due to her intelligence and her ability to discern his likes and dislikes. When Princess Huayang died in 774, he was so greatly saddened that he did not attend imperial meetings for several days until the chancellors asked the eunuch Wu Chengqian (吳承倩) to persuade him to attend to government matters. It was later rumored that the important minister Liu Yan had tried to persuade Emperor Daizong to make Consort Dugu empress, but failed to convince Emperor Daizong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 226. He honored her family greatly—posthumously honoring her father Dugu Ying, and also granting honorific offices to her uncle Dugu Zhuo (獨孤卓) and her brother Dugu Liangzuo (獨孤良佐).Old Book of Tang, vol. 52 . == Death == Consort Dugu died in 775. The day after her death, Emperor Daizong posthumously honored her as empress. Greatly saddened by her death, he placed her casket within the palace for years, until he finally buried her on September 19, 778,http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms- bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&dyna;=%AD%F0&king;=%A5N%A9v&reign;=%A4j%BE%E4&yy;=13&ycanzi;=&mm;=8ⅆ=&dcanzi;=%A4B%A8%BB at the imperial tomb where he would eventually be buried himself. As Princess Huayang had previously been buried at a site that was considered to be too low-lying and wet, he also had Princess Huayang disinterred and reburied near Consort Dugu. He had the chancellor Chang Gun, known for his literary talent, write a lengthy text mourning her. ==Media== *Consort Dugu is portrayed by Wan Qian in the 2017 Chinese television series Glory of Tang Dynasty.

Publius is depicted as receiving an arrow to the chest while a soldier grabs the reins of his horse. Reverse of a medal created in 1740-1750 by Jean Dassier & sons Publius Licinius Crassus (86 or 82 BC – 53 BC) was one of two sons of Marcus Licinius Crassus, the so-called \\"triumvir\\",Triumvir was a formal designation in ancient Rome; the political alliance among Crassus, Pompeius Magnus (\\"Pompey the Great\\") and Julius Caesar has been nicknamed the \\"First Triumvirate\\" by modern scholars, but unlike the legally recognized triumvirate during the transition from the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire, the three were not in Roman terms triumviri. and Tertulla, daughter of Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus., p.831 He belonged to the last generation of Roman nobiles who came of age and began a political career before the collapse of the Republic. His peers included Marcus Antonius, Marcus Junius Brutus, Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus, the poet Gaius Valerius Catullus, and the historian Gaius Sallustius Crispus. Publius Crassus served under Julius Caesar in Gaul from 58 to 56 BC. Too young to receive a formal commission from the senate, Publius distinguished himself as a commanding officer in campaigns among the Armorican nations (Brittany) and in Aquitania. He was highly regarded by Caesar and also by Cicero, who praised his speaking ability and good character. Upon his return to Rome, Publius married Cornelia Metella, the intellectually gifted daughter of the Metellus Scipio, and began his active political career as a monetalis and by providing a security force during his father's campaign for a second consulship. Publius's promising career was cut short when he died along with his father in an ill-conceivedElizabeth Rawson, “Crassorum funera,” Latomus 41 (1982) 540–549. war against the Parthian Empire. Cornelia, with whom he probably had no children, then married the much older Pompeius Magnus (\\"Pompey the Great\\"). ==Early life== Scholarly opinion is divided as to whether Publius or his brother Marcus was the elder, but with Roman naming conventions, the eldest son almost always carries on his father's name, including the praenomen, or first name, while younger sons are named for a grandfather or uncle.Lawrence Keppie, Understanding Roman Inscriptions (Routledge, 1991), p. 19 online. The achievements of Publius, named after his grandfather (consul in 97 BC) and uncle, eclipse those of his brother to such an extent that some have questioned the traditional birth order.G.V. Sumner, The Orators in Cicero’s “Brutus” (University of Toronto Press, 1973) and Allen Ward, Marcus Crassus and the Late Roman Republic (University of Missouri Press, 1977). Both Ronald Syme and Elizabeth Rawson, however, have argued vigorously for a family dynamic that casts Marcus as the older but Publius as the more talented younger brother.Ronald Syme, “The Sons of Crassus,” Latomus 39 (1980) 403-408, reprinted in Roman Papers, vol. 3, edited by Anthony R. Birley (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984); see also Elizabeth Rawson, “Crassorum funera,” Latomus 41 (1982) 540–549. ===Family environment=== Publius grew up in a traditional household that was characterized by Plutarch in his Life of Crassus as stable and orderly. The biographer is often harshly critical of the elder Crassus's shortcomings, particularly moralizing his greed, but makes a point of contrasting the triumvir's family life. Despite his great wealth, Crassus is said to have avoided excess and luxury at home. Family meals were simple, and entertaining was generous but not ostentatious; Crassus chose his companions during leisure hours on the basis of personal friendship as well as political utility.Plutarch, Crassus 3.1–2; for a perspective on the triumvir's positive characteristics, see T.J. Cadoux, \\"Marcus Crassus: A Revaluation,\\" Greece & Rome 3 (1956) 153–161. Although the Crassi, as noble plebeians, would have displayed ancestral images in their atrium,On the ius imaginum, or right of nobiles to display ancestral images, see the article \\"Nobiles\\" in Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, Bill Thayer's edition at LacusCurtius online; also P.A. Brunt, \\"Nobilitas and novitas,\\" Journal of Roman Studies 72 (1982), pp. 12–13, and R.T. Ridley, \\"The Genesis of a Turning-Point: Gelzer's Nobilität,\\" Historia 35 (1986), pp. 499–502. The term ius imaginum is a modern coinage, and the notion that this display was constituted by a legal right was reexamined and refined by Harriet I. Flowers, Ancestor Masks and Aristocratic Power in Roman Culture (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996), especially pp. 53–59 online. they did not lay claim to a fictionalized genealogy that presumed divine or legendary ancestors, a practice not uncommon among the Roman nobility.T.P. Wiseman, \\"Legendary Genealogies in Late-Republican Rome,\\" Greece & Rome 21 (1974), p. 162, in reference to Publius's consular grandfather. The elder Crassus, even as the son of a consul and censor, had himself grown up in a modestly kept and multigenerational house;Plutarch, Crassus 1.1. Marcus's two brothers \\"took their meals at home\\" even after they married, indicating that they continued to live in their father's house; see K.R. Bradley, \\"Remarriage and the Structure of the Upper-Class Roman Family,\\" in Marriage, Divorce, and Children in Ancient Rome (Oxford University Press, 1996), p. 87 online. the passage of sumptuary laws had been among his father's political achievements.See \\"Sumptuariae Leges\\" in Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, Bill Thayer's edition at LacusCurtius online. In marrying the widow of his brother,Plutarch, Crassus 1.1. who had been killed during the Sullan civil wars, Marcus Crassus observed an ancient Roman custom that had become old- fashioned in his own time. Publius, unlike many of his peers, had parents who remained married for nearly 35 years, until the elder Crassus's death;Adrian Goldsworthy, Caesar: Life of a Colossus (Yale University Press, 2008), p. 85 online, accepting as fact her placement on the list of Caesar's lovers by Suetonius. Syme implies political slander in the compilation; see \\"No Sons for Caesar?\\" Historia 29 (1980), p. 425. by contrast, Pompeius Magnus married five timesShelley P. Haley, \\"The Fives Wives of Pompey the Great,\\" Greece & Rome 32 (1985) 49–59. and Julius Caesar at least three.On questions pertaining to whether Caesar had four wives (with Cossutia the first) or three (with Cossutia as a broken engagement), see Monroe E. Deutsch, \\"Caesar's First Wife,\\" Classical Philology 12 (1917) 93–96, full text online. Crassus remained married to Tertulla \\"despite attacks on her reputation.\\"Susan Treggiari, \\"Divorce Roman Style: How Easy and How Frequent Was It?\\" in Marriage, Divorce, and Children in Ancient Rome (Oxford University Press, 1996), p. 43 online. It was rumored that a family friend, Quintus Axius of Reate,T.P. Wiseman, New Men in the Roman Senate (Oxford University Press, 1971), p. 216. was the biological father of one of her two sons. Plutarch reports a joke by Cicero that made reference to a strong resemblance between Axius and one of the boys.Plutarch, Cicero 25.4, Bill Thayer’s edition at LacusCurtius online. ===Education=== The Peripatetic philosopher AlexanderAt one time thought to be Alexander Polyhistor — see Wilhelm Siegmund Teuffel, A History of Roman Literature (London, 1873), vol. 1, p. 222 online — but this is not a widely held view now. was attached to the household of Crassus and is likely to have contributed to the education of the boys.On the role of intellectuals in the education of aristocratic youth at Rome, see Beryl Rawson, Children and Childhood in Roman Italy (Oxford University Press, 2005), pp. 153–154 online. Although his poor remuneration is noted as evidence of Crassus's parsimony,Plutarch, Crassus 3.3; Elizabeth Rawson, Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 81. it has been suggested that in failing to enrich himself at Crassus's expense Alexander asserted a positive philosophical stance disregarding material possessions.This was the view of Robert Burton in The Anatomy of Melancholy, part 1, section 2, p. 206 in the edition of Chatto and Windus (London, 1881). The Peripatetics of the time differed little from the Old Academy represented by Antiochus of Ascalon, who placed emphasis on knowledge as the supreme value and on the Aristotelian conception of human beings as by nature political (a zōon politikon, \\"creature of politics\\"). This view of man as a \\"political animal\\" would have been congenial to the family political dynamism of the Licinii Crassi.Miriam Griffin, \\"Philosophy, Politics, and Politicians at Rome,\\" in Philosophia togata: Essays on Philosophy and Roman Society (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989), passim, including citations from Cicero. Cicero praised Publius Crassus for his character and speaking ability The Peripatetics and Academics, according to Cicero, provided the best oratorical training;Cicero, De oratore 3.57f.; Brutus 119ff.; Tusculan Disputations 2.9. while the Academics drilled in rebuttal, he says, the Peripatetics excelled at rhetorical theory and also practiced debating both sides of an issue.Cicero, De finibus 5.10. The young Crassus must have thrived on this training, for Cicero praises his abilities as a speaker and in the Brutus places him in the company of gifted young orators whose lives ended before they could fulfill their potential:Others are Scribonius Curio (born ca. 85 BC) and Licinius Calvus (born 82 BC): Brutus 281f; discussed in Syme, “The Sons of Crassus,” reprint p. 1222. The secondary education of a Roman male of the governing classes typically required a stint as a contubernalis (literally a “tentmate”,See Smith's entry \\"Contubernales\\" online. a sort of military intern or apprentice) following the assumption of the toga virilis around the age of 15 and before assuming formal military duties. Publius, his brother Marcus, and Decimus Brutus may have been contubernales during Caesar's propraetorship in Spain (61–60 BC). Publius's father and grandfather had strong ties to Spain: his grandfather had earned his triumph from the same province of Hispania Ulterior, and during Sulla's first civil war his father had found refuge among friends there, avoiding the fate of Publius's uncle and grandfather. Caesar's field commission of Publius in Gaul indicates a high level of confidence, perhaps because he had trained the young man himself and knew his abilities.Syme, “The Sons of Crassus,” reprint pp. 1220–1221. Little else is known about Publius's philosophical predispositions or political sympathies. Despite his active support on behalf of his father in the elections for 55 BC and his ties to Caesar, he admired and was loyal to Cicero and played a mediating role between Cicero and the elder Crassus, who was often at odds with the outspoken orator.Eve J. Parrish, \\"Crassus' New Friends and Pompey's Return,\\" Phoenix 27 (1973), p. 371, citing Cicero, Ad familiares 5.8.4 and 13.16.21; Ad Quintum fratrem 2.7.2; and Brutus 280–282. In his friendship with Cicero, Publius showed a degree of political independence. Cicero seems to have hoped that he could steer the talented young man away from a popularist and militarist path toward the example of his consular grandfather, whose political career was traditional and moderate, or toward modeling himself after the orator Licinius Crassus about whom Cicero so often wrote.Elizabeth Rawson, “Crassorum funera,” Latomus 41 (1982), pp. 542 and 546; see Cicero, Brutus 282. Cicero almost always speaks of young Crassus with approval and affection, criticizing only his impatient ambition.Rawson, \\"Crassorum funera,\\" pp. 542–543, citing D.R. Shackleton Bailey in his note to Ad fam. 13.16.1, as having introduced the question of whether Publius's ambition was the main impetus for the war against Parthia. ==Early military career== Publius Crassus enters the historical record as an officer under Caesar in Gaul. His military rank, which Caesar never identifies, has been a subject of debate. Although he held commands, Publius was neither an elected military tribune nor legatus appointed by the senate, though the Greek historian Cassius Dio contributes to the confusion by applying Greek terminology (ὑπεστρατήγει, hupestratêgei) to Publius that usually translates the rank expressed in Latin by legatus.Cassius Dio 39.31. Those who have argued that Publius was the elder son have attempted to make a quaestor of him.In “The Sons of Crassus,” reprint p. 1222, Syme discounts the notion that Publius was ever a quaestor but entertains the possibility that in Gaul he might have been a military tribune. Rawson holds that even after his operations in Aquitania “he was still perhaps technically only praefectus equitum, if that” (“Crassorum funera,” p. 547). Caesar's omission, however, supports the view that the young Crassus held no formal rank, as the Bellum Gallicum consistently identifies officers with regard to their place in the military chain of command. Publius is introduced in the narrative only as adulescens,Bellum Gallicum 1.51.7, where he is in command of cavalry; and 3.7.2 and 21.1, during his Armorican and Aquitanian commands. “tantamount to a technical term for a young man not holding any formal post.”Rawson, “Crassorum funera,” p. 545. The only other Roman Caesar calls adulescens is Decimus Brutus,Bellum Gallicum 3.11.5, and as late as 52 BC (BG 7.9.1 and 87.1). Several Celtic leaders are called adulescentes, including Vercingetorix (BG 7.4); Convictolitavis (7.32.4); the Aeduan co-commanders at Alesia, Eporedorix and Viridomarus (7.39.1 and 63.9); and Gaius Valerius Troucillus, a Narbonese Gaul already holding Roman citizenship. who also makes his first appearance in history in the Bellum Gallicum. In the third year of the war, Caesar refers to Publius as dux, a non-technical term of military leadership that he uses elsewhere only in reference to Celtic generals.Thomas Wiedemann, “The Fetiales: A Reconsideration,” Classical Quarterly 36 (1986), p. 483. The informality of the phrase is enhanced by a descriptive adulescentulus; in context, Publius is said to be with his men as an adulescentulo duce,Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 3.21.1. their \\"very young\\" or \\"under-age leader.\\" ===Entering Celtica, 58 BC=== In 58 BC, Caesar led the first Roman army into Celtica; Gallia Cisalpina and the Narbonensis (or Gallia Transalpina) were already under Roman rule In the first year of the Gallic Wars, Caesar and his Celtic Aeduan allies fought a defensive campaign against the Celtic Helvetii, and waged an offensive against the Germanic Suebi and their allies, led by Ariovistus. During the decisive battle against the Suebi that brought the first year of fighting to its conclusion, Publius Crassus was given command of the cavalry.Bellum Gallicum 1.51.7. In 58 BC, Caesar's cavalry auxiliaries numbered 4,000, comprising regiments from the Aedui and from the Gallic nations of Gallia Transalpina, already a Roman province.Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 1.15.1 on number and composition of cavalry; these assembled in Vocontian territory (1.10.4). In Caesar's army,See also Structural history of the Roman military, especially Marian legion (107 BC – 27 BC). the primary strategic applications of cavalry were reconnaissance and intelligence gathering, conducted by detachments of exploratores (“scouts”) and speculatores (“spies”); communications; patrols, including advance parties and guard units on the flanks of the army on the march; skirmishing, and securing the territory after fighting by preventing the flight of surviving enemy. The cavalry charge was infrequent.Pierre F. Cagniart, “Studies on Caesar’s Use of Cavalry during the Gallic War,” Ancient World 23 (1992) 71–85; Amiram Ezov, \\"The 'Missing Dimension' of C. Julius Caesar,\\" Historia 45 (1996) 64–94, especially 72–83 on exploratores and speculatores. In the opening stage of the war against the Helvetii, Caesar had retained a Gallic command structure;Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 1.18.10. a lack of strategic coordination, exacerbated by conflicting loyalties,Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 1.17–19. led to poor performance,Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 1.15.1–3 (also Cassius Dio 38.33.1), where Caesar's 4,000–strong cavalry is routed by 500 Helvetian troopers — twice (BG 1.24.1, Dio 38.33.3); faulty intelligence from mounted exploratores at 1.21–22; at 1.25.1, the horses are removed from the battlefield to discourage retreat; Caesar has legionaries from the 10th ride as an escort in place of the untrustworthy Gallic cavalry, 1.42.6–7. which Caesar sought to correct with a more centralized command. Publius Crassus is the first Roman named as a cavalry commander in the war,Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 1.51.7. and was perhaps given the task of restructuring. After several days of Roman provocation that produced only skirmishes,Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 1.48, 50–51. the Suebi responded with a sudden attack that preempted standard Roman tactics; Caesar says that the army was unable to release a volley of javelins (pila),Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 1.51.3; Cassius Dio (38.48–49) emphasizes the element of surprise on the part of the Suebi. which ordinarily would have been preceded by a cavalry skirmish. Instead, Crassus and the auxiliaries seem to have remained on the periphery of action.Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 1.51–52. Caesar gives Crassus credit for accurately assessing the status of the battle from his superior vantage point and for ordering in the third line of infantry at the critical moment. Initiative is implied. After the Suebi were routed, the horsemen pursued those who escaped, but failed to capture Ariovistus.Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 1.52.3; Cassius Dio 38.50.5. ===Belgica, 57 BC=== The second year of the war was conducted in northern Gaul among the Belgic nations. In the penultimate chapter of his book on that year's campaigns, Caesar abruptly reveals that he had placed Publius Crassus in command of the 7th Legion, which had suffered heavy casualtiesCaesar, Bellum Gallicum 2.23 and 26. Plutarch, either misunderstanding Caesar or working from another source, says that both the 7th and the 12th legions lost all their centurions (Caesar 20.7); Appian (Gallic Wars epitome 4) sweepingly disposes of the tribunes and centurions for the entire army; Caesar says only that nearly all the centurions of the 12th were killed or wounded. Although the 12th was hardest hit, the 7th fought in the same quarter, where the onslaught was worst. against the Nervii at the recent Battle of the Sabis;For an account of the battle with photos of the battlefield as it appears today, see \\"The Battle of the Sabis (57 BCE)\\" at Livius.org. Publius's role in this battle goes unremarked.Michel Rambaud, C. Iulius Caesar De Bello Gallico, secundus tertiusque libri, text, introduction and commentary (Paris 1965), p. 144, note to 3.7.2, says that Crassus commanded the 7th Legion prior to his Armorican mission, but no basis for this assertion is stated. Caesar says that in the aftermath he sent Crassus west to Armorica (Brittany) while he himself headed east to lay siege to the stronghold of the Aduatuci. ===Armorica and Aquitania, 56 BC=== Armorica, with the Seine and Loire rivers indicated in red Scholars have rarely tried to interpret Caesar's decision to send a young, relatively inexperienced officer with a single legion to secure a major geographical region inhabited by multiple civitates,The word civitas is used in the Bellum Gallicum less often to mean \\"citizenship\\" than to refer to one of the peoples or nations of Gaul as a polity, and sometimes to their major city, though \\"capital\\" might be an anachronism. See J.F. Drinkwater, Roman Gaul: The Three Provinces, 58 BC–AD 260, pp. 103–109. while the commander-in- chief himself lay siege to a single town with the remaining seven legions of his army and a full staff of senior legates and some or most of the tribunes. Crassus's Armorican mission is reported so elliptically that Caesar's chronology and veracity have been questioned, most pointedly by the contrarian scholar Michel Rambaud, who insisted that the 7th Legion must have detached for its mission prior to the Battle of the Sabis.Michel Rambaud, C. Iulius Caesar De Bello Gallico, secundus tertiusque libri (Paris 1965), pp. 76–77, note to 2.15.2, and 123–124, note to 2.34, and L'Art de la déformation historique dans les Commentaires de César (Paris 1953), p. 76 on chronology and 123, where he calls Crassus's operation \\"un trompe–l'œil\\" for Caesar's audience at Rome; see also C.E. Stevens, “52 BC and 54 BC,” Antiquity 21 (1947) 3–9, and “The Bellum Gallicum as a Work of Propaganda,” Latomus 11 (1952) 3–18; Barbara Levick, “The Veneti Revisited: C.E. Stevens and the Tradition on Caesar the Propagandist,” in Julius Caesar as Artful Reporter: The War Commentaries as Political Instrument, edited by Kathryn Welch and Anton Powell (Classical Press of Wales, 1998). Crassus is credited with bringing several polities or “nations” under treaty, but Caesar says nothing about military operations: Crassus and the 7th then winter among the Andes, a Gallic polity whose territory corresponds roughly with the diocese of Angers (Anjou) in the French department Maine-et-Loire.\\"Andes\\" in Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 3.7.2; \\"Andicavi\\" in Orosius 6.8.7. Although Caesar locates the Andes “near the Atlantic,” they held no coast and were located inland along the Loire river. Caesar is compelled to modify his assessment of the situation when he writes his account of the third year of the war,The dominant scholarly tradition has Caesar writing the Bellum Gallicum in its entirety during the winter of 52–51 BC, after the defeat of Vercingetorix. Since the 1990s, weight has shifted to serial publication, with Caesar publicizing his achievements year by year and a collected edition published after the war with the additions of Aulus Hirtius. Inconsistencies and disjunctures in the overall narrative suggest that Caesar may have been unaware of the full consequences of an action at the time of initial writing; see T.P. Wiseman, “The Publication of De Bello Gallico,” Julius Caesar as Artful Reporter (Classical Press of Wales, 1998). in which he himself plays a diminished role and which is markedly shorter than his other six books.Kathryn Welch, “Caesar and His Officers in the Gallic War Commentaries,” in Julius Caesar as Artful Reporter (Classical Press of Wales, 1998). Instead, Book 3 of the Bellum Gallicum focuses on Sulpicius Galba’s travails in the Alps, and campaigns led by the two junior officers Publius Crassus and Decimus Brutus. Hostage crisis According to Caesar, the young Crassus, facing a shortage of rations, at some unspecified time sent out detachments to procure grain under the command of prefects and military tribunes, among them four named officers of equestrian status who are seized as hostages by three Gallic polities in collusion. The four are T. Terrasidius, held by the Esubii; M. Trebius Gallus, by the Coriosolites; and Q. Velanius and T. Silius, both by the Veneti.Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 3.7; for an Armorican point of view, see John Hooker, Celtic Improvisations (BAR International Series 1092 2002), Chapter 9 online. Whether the Gauls and the Romans understood each other's laws and customs pertaining to hostage-taking is at issue here as elsewhere in the course of the war, and the actions of Publius Crassus are difficult to reconstruct. The Latin word for hostage, (plural ), may translate but not necessarily correspond in legal application with the Celtic congestlos (in Gaulish). For both Romans and Celts, the handing over of hostages was often a formally negotiated term in a treaty;Joel Allen, Hostages and Hostage-Taking in the Roman Empire (Cambridge University Press, 2006), passim, but especially pp. 72, 77, and 112–116 online on the practices of Caesar among the Gauls. among the Celts, however, hostages were also exchanged as a pledge of mutual alliance with no loss of status,Xavier Delamarre, “Congestlos,” in Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise (Éditions Errance, 2003) p. 124. a practice that should be placed in the context of other Celtic social institutions such as fosterage and political alliance through marriage.Raimund Karl, “*butacos, *uossos, *geistlos, *ambaχtos: Celtic Socio-economic Organisation in the European Iron Age,” Studia Celtica 40 (2006). Among the Celtic and Germanic peoples, hostage arrangements seem to have been a more mutually effective form of diplomatic pressure than was the always-onesided taking of hostages by the Romans.M. James Moscovich, “Obsidibus traditis: Hostages in Caesar’s De Bello Gallico,” Classical Journal 75 (1979–80) 122–128, especially p. 123, note 3. A concept of international law, expressed in Latin by the phrase ius gentium, existed by custom and consensus, and not in any written code or sworn treaty.George Mousourakis, The Historical and Institutional Context of Roman Law (Ashgate Publishing, 2003), pp. 23–24 online and Richard A. Bauman, Human Rights in Ancient Rome (Routledge, 2000), p. 29 online. By custom, the safety of hostages was guaranteed unless parties to a treaty violated its terms, in which case the subjecting of hostages to punitive actions such as torture or execution was not regarded as violating the ius gentium.Joel Allen, Hostages and Hostage-Taking in the Roman Empire, p. 56 online. If the Armoricans believed themselves to hold the four Romans as hostages in the sense of congestloi, it is unclear what negotiations Publius Crassus had undertaken. “Caesar liked energy and enterprise in young aristocrats,” Syme remarked, “a predilection not always attended with happy results.”Syme, “The Sons of Crassus,” reprint p. 1223. Caesar reacted with military force. In writing the Bellum Gallicum, Caesar often elides legal and administrative arrangements in favor of military narrative.Adrian Goldsworthy, “‘Instinctive Genius’: The Depiction of Caesar the General,” in Julius Caesar as Artful Reporter (Classical Press of Wales, 1998), and other essays in the collection. The situation faced by Publius Crassus in Brittany involved both the prosaic matter of logistics (i.e., feeding the legion under his command)On aristocratic aversion to discussing logistics, see Edward N. Luttwak, “Logistics and the Aristocratic Idea of War,” in Feeding Mars: Logistics in Western Warfare from the Middle Ages to the Present (Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press, 1993). as well as diplomacy among multiple polities, much of which had to be conducted on initiative during Caesar's absence. The building of a Roman fleet on the Loire river during the winter of 57–56 BC has been interpreted by several modern scholarsC.E. Stevens, “52 BC and 54 BC,” Antiquity 21 (1947) 3–9; “The Bellum Gallicum as a Work of Propaganda,” Latomus 11 (1952) 3–18; and “Britain Between the Invasions (BC 54–A.D. 43): A Study of Ancient Diplomacy,” in Aspects of Archaeology in Britain and Beyond: Essays Presented to O.G.S. Crawford (London, 1951). Also Alain Duval, “Regional Groups in Western France,” in Cross-Channel Trade Between Gaul and Britain in the Pre-Roman Iron Age (London, 1984); Barbara Levick, “The Veneti Revisited,” in Julius Caesar as Artful Reporter (Classical Press of Wales, 1998). as preparation for an invasion of Britain, to which the Armoricans would have objected as a threat to their own trade relations with the island. Caesar, at any rate, is most expansive about the exciting naval battle that ensues from the crisis.For an example of scholarship as postmodernist farce, see Brice Erickson, “Falling Masts, Rising Masters: The Ethnography of Virtue in Caesar’s Account of the Veneti,” American Journal of Philology 123 (2002) 601–622, which reduces the naval battle to postcolonial freudian fantasy. When he received reports of the hostage situation in Armorica, Caesar had not yet returned to the front from his administrative winter quarters in Ravenna, where he had met with Publius's father for political deal-making prior to the more famous triumviral conference at Luca in April.Erich S. Gruen, \\"Pompey, the Roman Aristocracy, and the Conference of Luca,\\" Historia 18 (1969), p. 23, and Colm Luibheid, \\"The Luca Conference,\\" Classical Philology 65 (1970) 88–94. Caesar makes haste, and in the summer of 56 BC, the campaign against the Veneti and their allies is conducted by Decimus Brutus as a naval operation. Caesar gives no explanation for transferring Crassus from command on the Armorican front, although he does write in Bellum Gallicum that he (Caesar) ordered Crassus to proceed into Aquitania with twelve legionary cohorts and a great number of the cavalry to prevent tribes in Aquitania from sending volunteers or “auxiliaries” to unite with tribes of Gaul presumably to exploit the unrest caused by the hostage crisis. The Romans are eventually victorious, but the fate of the hostages is left unstated, and in a break with his policy in working with the Gallic aristocracy over the previous two years, Caesar orders the execution of the entire Venetian senate.Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 3.7–16; Cassius Dio 39.40–43. Conqueror of Aquitania While naval operations were taking place in the waters of the Veneti, Publius Crassus was sent south to Aquitania, this time with a force consisting of twelve Roman legionary cohorts, allied Celtic cavalry and volunteers from Gallia Narbonensis. Ten cohorts is the standard complement of the Caesarian legion, and the twelve cohorts are not identified by any unit number. Caesar relates Publius's challenges and successes at some length and without any ambiguity about their military nature. Cassius Dio provides a synopsis, which does not accord in every detail with the account of Caesar: Caesar regards the victories of Publius Crassus as impressive for several reasons. Crassus was only about 25 at the time.Syme, \\"The Sons of Crassus,\\" reprint p. 1223. He was greatly outnumbered, but he recruited both new Celtic allies and called up provincial forces from southern Gaul;Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 3.20.2. a thousand of his Celtic cavalry remain under his command and loyal to him till his death.Plutarch, Crassus 25.7–10. Caesar seems almost to present a military résumé for Crassus that outlines the qualities of a good officer. The young dux successfully brought the power of war machines to bear in laying siege to a stronghold of the Sotiates; upon surrender, he showed clemency, a quality on which Caesar prided himself, toward the enemy commander Adcantuannus.Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 3.21.2 and 3.22.4. Crassus solicited opinions from his officers at a war council and achieved consensus on a plan of action.Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 3.23.8. He gathered intelligence and demonstrated his foresight and strategic thinking, employing tactics of stealth, surprise, and deception.Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 3.23.7, 24.5, 25.2, 26.1–3. Frontinus devoted considerable portions of Books 1 and 3 of his Strategemata to concealment, surprise, and deception; see Bill Thayer's LacusCurtius edition of the Loeb Classical Library translation online Caesar further makes a point of Crassus's attention to logistics and supply lines, which may have been a deficiency on the Armorican mission.Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 3.20.2 and 23.7. Ultimately, Crassus was able to out-general experienced men who had trained in Roman military tactics with the gifted rebel Quintus Sertorius on the Spanish front of the civil wars in the late 80s and 70s BC.Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 3.23.5. ==Political career== Publius Crassus returned to Rome in the fall of 56 BC, or as late as January 55 BC. He brought with him a thousand troops from Gaul, the presence of which had a noticeable effect on the consular elections for the coming year.Cassius Dio, 39.31.2. Street violence was increasingly an instrument of political pressure, culminating three years later in the public murder of the popularist aristocrat Publius Clodius Pulcher. Pompeius Magnus and Marcus Crassus were eventually elected to their second joint consulship for the year of 55. Several steps were taken during this time to advance Publius's career.Rawson, \\"Crassorum funera,\\" p. 546. ===Monetalis=== Denarius issued by Publius Crassus Publius Crassus served as one of the monetales, or moneyers, authorized to issue coinage, most likely in the year of his father's consulship. In the late Republic, this office was a regular preliminary to the political career track for senators’ sons, to be followed by a run for quaestor when the age requirement of 30 was met. Common among the surviving coins issued by Publius Crassus is a denarius depicting a bust of Venus, perhaps a reference to Caesar's legendary genealogy, and on the reverse an unidentified female figure standing by a horse. The short-skirted equestrian holds the horse's bridle in her right hand, with a spear in her left. A cuirass and shield appear in the background at her feet. She may be an allegorical representation of Gallia, to commemorate Crassus's military achievements in Gaul and to honor the thousand Gallic cavalry who were deployed with him for Syria.Rawson, \\"Crassorum funera,\\" pp. 545–546. Interpretations of the numismatic iconography of this denarius vary, and the historian and numismatist Michael Crawford rejects the reference to Gallic cavalry, Roman Republican Coinage (Cambridge University Press, 1974, reprinted 2001), vols. 1 and 2, no. 430, p. 454 and p. 734 online (on the Sullan typology of Publius's coinage); discussed by Rawson. ===Augur=== Publius received an additional boost to his career when he was co-opted into the college of augurs, replacing the late Lucius Licinius Lucullus, a staunch conservative in politics. Although the augurs held no direct political power, their right to withhold religious ratification could amount to a veto. It was a prestigious appointment that indicates great expectations for Publius's future. The vacancy left in the augural college by Publius's death two years later was filled by Cicero.Lily Ross Taylor, \\"Caesar's Colleagues in the Pontifical College,\\" American Journal of Philology 63 (1942), p. 410. ===Marriage=== During his time in Rome, Publius married the lavishly praised and highly educated Cornelia, who was probably around sixteen or seventeen. As the daughter of Q. Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio, she was “the heiress of the last surviving branch of the Scipiones.”Syme, review of Caesar der Politiker und Staatsman by M. Gelzer, Journal of Roman Studies 34 (1944), p. 96. Publius would have been in his late twenties. His military service abroad had postponed marriage to a later age than a Roman noble typically took a wife. The date of their betrothal goes unrecorded, but if Cornelia had long been the desired bride, she would have been too young to marry before Publius left for Gaul, and his worth as a husband may not have been as evident.Ronald Syme, “Marriage Ages for Roman Senators,” Historia 26 (1987) 318–332. The political value of the marriage for Publius lay in family ties to the so-called optimates, a continually realigning faction of conservative senators who sought to preserve the traditional prerogatives of the aristocratic oligarchy and to prevent exceptional individuals from dominating through direct appeal to the people or the amassing of military power.Eve J. Parrish, \\"Crassus' New Friends and Pompey's Return,\\" Phoenix 27 (1973) 357–380; Erich S. Gruen, \\"Pompey, the Roman Aristocracy, and the Conference of Luca,\\" Historia 18 (1969) 71–108, especially p. 73. Publius's brother had been married to a daughter of Q. Caecilius Metellus Creticus (consul 69 BC), probably around 63–62 BC;Syme, \\"The Sons of Crassus,\\" reprint p. 1223ff. both matches signal their father's desire for rapprochement with the optimates, despite his working arrangements with Caesar and Pompeius, an indication that perhaps the elder Crassus was more conservative than some have thought.Lily Ross Taylor, Party Politics in the Age of Caesar (University of California Press, 1949), p. 121 with note 12; Ronald Syme, review of Caesar der Politiker und Staatsman by M. Gelzer, Journal of Roman Studies 34 (1944) 96–97. ===Preparations for the East=== :See also Battle of Carrhae: Political background in Rome. In a letter from February 55 BC, Cicero mentions the presence of Publius Crassus at a meeting held at his father's house. During these political negotiations, it was agreed that Cicero would not oppose a legatio, or state-sponsored junket, to the East by his longtime enemy Clodius Pulcher, in exchange for Marcus Crassus supporting an unidentified favor sought by Cicero. Although Clodius has sometimes been regarded as an agent or ally of Crassus, it is unclear whether his trip, probably to visit Byzantium or Galatia, was connected to Crassus's own intentions in the East.W. Jeffrey Tatum, The Patrician Tribune: Publius Clodius Pulcher (University of North Caroline Press, 1999), pp. 223–225. The triumviral negotiations at Ravenna and Luca had resulted in the prolongment of Caesar's Gallic command and the granting of an extended five- year proconsular province for each of the consuls of 55 BC. The Spanish provinces went to Pompeius; Crassus arranged to have Syria, with the transparent intention of launching a war against Parthia. Some Romans opposed the war. Cicero calls it a war nulla causa (“with no justification”), on the grounds that Parthia had a treaty with Rome.Cicero, De finibus 3.75. Others may have objected less to a war with Parthia than to the attempt of the triumvirate to amass power by waging it. Despite objections and a host of bad omens,For omens and curses against Crassus's departure, see article on Gaius Ateius Capito. Marcus Crassus set sail from Brundisium in November 55 BC. The notoriously wealthy Marcus Crassus was around sixty and hearing- impairedCicero, Tusculan Disputations 4.40 (= 116), as cited by Rawson, \\"Crassorum funera,\\" p. 541. when he embarked on the Parthian invasion. Plutarch in particular regards greed as his motive;Plutarch, Crassus 2 on greed, 14.4 on greed and envy, 16 on Crassus's eagerness for the Parthian campaign; see Bill Thayer's edition of the Loeb Classical Library translation at LacusCurtius online. modern historians tend toward envy and rivalry, since Crassus’ faded military reputation was inferior to that of Pompeius and, after five years of war in Gaul, to that of Caesar. Elizabeth Rawson, however, suggested that in addition to these or other practical objectives, the war was meant to provide an arena for Publius's abilities as a general, which he had begun to demonstrate so vividly in Gaul.Rawson, \\"Crassorum funera,\\" passim; see also article Battle of Carrhae, discussion under Political background in Rome. Cicero implies as much when he enumerates Publius's many fine qualities (see above) and then mourns and criticizes his young friend's destructive desire for gloria: Publius presumably helped with preparations for the war. Both Pompeius and Crassus levied troops throughout Italy. Publius may have organized these efforts in the north, as he is said to have departed for Parthia from Gaul (probably Cisalpina). His thousand cavalry from Celtica (present-day France and Belgium), auxilia provided by technically independent allies, were likely to have been stationed in Cisalpina; it is questionable whether the thousand-strong force he used to pressure elections in January 55 BC were these same men, as the employment of barbarians within Rome should have been viewed as outrageous enough to provoke comment.Plutarch, Crassus 17.4; Cassius Dio 40.21.2; Rawson, \\"Crassorum funera,\\" p. 546. Accusations of relying on Celts or slaves to apply force were often hurled at Popularist politicians. Publius's activities in 54 BC are unrecorded, but he and his Celtic cavalry troopers did not join his father in Syria until the winter of 54–53 BC, a year after the elder Crassus's departure. His horsemen may have been needed in Gaul as Caesar dealt with a renewed threat from Germanic tribes from across the Rhine and launched his first invasion of Britannia.Rawson, \\"Crassorum funera,\\" p. 547. ==The Parthian campaign== :See also Battle of Carrhae: The battle. Despite opposition to the war, Marcus Crassus was criticized for doing little to advance the invasion during the first year of his proconsulship. Upon entering winter quarters, he spent his time on the 1st-century BC equivalent of number-crunching and wealth management, rather than organizing his troops and engaging in diplomatic efforts to gain allies. Only after the arrival of Publius Crassus did he launch the war, and even that beginning was ill-omened. After an inventory of the treasury at the Temple of Atargatis, Hierapolis, Publius stumbled at the gate and his father tripped over him.Plutarch, Crassus 17.4–6. The reporting of this portent, fictional or not, suggests \\"that Publius was seen as the true cause of the disaster.\\"Rawson, \\"Crassorum funera,\\" p. 549. The military advance was likewise attended by a series of bad omens, and the elder Crassus was frequently at odds with his quaestor, Cassius Longinus, the future assassin of Caesar. Cassius's strategic sense is presented by Plutarch as superior to that of his commander. Little is said of any contribution by Publius Crassus until a critical juncture at the river Balissus (Balikh), where most of the officers thought the army ought to make camp, rest after a long march through hostile terrain, and reconnoiter. Marcus Crassus instead is inspired by the eagerness of Publius and his Celtic cavalry to do battle, and after a quick halt in ranks for refreshment, the army marches headlong into a Parthian trap.For overviews of the Parthian campaign and the Battle of Carrhae, see Martin Sicker, The Pre-Islamic Middle East (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2000), pp. 149–151 online; A.D.H. Bivar, \\"The Political History of Iran under the Arsacids,\\" in The Cambridge History of Iran (Cambridge University Press, 1983) vol. 3, pp. 48–56 limited preview online. Marcus Crassus commanded seven legions, the strength of which has been estimated variously from 28,000 to 40,000, along with 4,000 cavalry and a comparable number of light infantry. The Roman army vastly outnumbered the force they faced. Although the sandy, open desert landscape favored cavalry over infantry, the primary value of the Gallo-Roman cavalry was mobility, not force, being lightly armed and protected. By contrast, the one thousand heavily armored Parthian cataphracts rode barded horses and carried long heavy lances (kontos), the reach and power of which exceeded the Gallic spear, while the 9,000 Parthian mounted archers were equipped with a compound bow far superior to that used in Europe, with arrows continually replenished by foot soldiers from a camel train. The reputation of the legionaries for excellence in combat at close quarters had been anticipated by the Parthian general Surena, and answered with heavy cavalry and long-range weaponry.The Cambridge History of Iran, p. 52. For a detailed rehearsal of tactics at Carrhae with an emphasis on the role of cavalry, see Philip Sidnell, \\"Warhorse: Cavalry in Ancient Warfare\\" (Continuum, 2006), pp. 237–242 online. Marcus Crassus responded by drawing the legionaries into a defensive square, the shield-wall of which afforded some protection but within which they could accomplish nothing and risked being surrounded. To prevent encirclement, or perhaps in a desperate attempt at diversion,The Cambridge History of Iran, p. 54. Publius Crassus led out a corps of 1,300 cavalry, primarily his loyal Celtic troopers; 500 archers; and 4,000 elite infantry. The Parthian wing on his side, appearing to abandon their attempt to surround the army, then retreated. Publius pursued. When his force was out of visual and communication range of the main army, the Parthians halted, and Publius found himself in an ambush, with his force rapidly encircled. A military historian describes the scene: With casualties mounting, Publius decided that a charge was his only option, but most of his men, riddled with arrows, could not respond to the call. Only the Gallic cavalry followed their young leader. The cataphracts returned the effort with a counter charge in which they held the distinct advantage in number and equipment. The weaker, shorter Gallic spears would have had limited effect against the heavy encasing armor of the cataphracts. But when the two forces closed, the lighter armor that left the Gauls more vulnerable also made them more agile. They grabbed hold of the Parthian lances and grappled to unseat the enemy horsemen. Other Gauls, unhorsed or choosing to dismount, stabbed the Parthian horses in the belly — a tactic that had been employed against Caesar's cavalry by outnumbered Germans the previous year in Gaul.Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 4.12.2. Eventually, however, the Gauls are forced to retreat, carrying away their wounded leader to a nearby sand dune, where the surviving Roman forces regroup. They drive their horses into the center, then lock shields to form a perimeter. But because of the slope, the men were exposed in tiers to the ceaseless volleys of arrows. Two Greeks who knew the region tried to persuade Publius to escape to a nearby friendly city while his troops held off the enemy. He refused: The portrait of Publius in Parthia presented by Plutarch contrasts with Caesar's emphasis on the young man's prudence, diplomacy, and strategic thinking. Plutarch describes a leader who is above all keen to fight, brave to the point of recklessness, and tragically heroic in his embrace of death. Publius Crassus's friends Censorinus and Megabocchus and most of the officers commit suicide next to him, and barely 500 men are left alive. The Parthians mutilate Publius's body and parade his head on the tip of a lance in front of the Roman camp. Taunts are hurled at his father for his son's greater courage. Plutarch suggests that Marcus Crassus was unable to recover from this psychological blow, and the military situation deteriorated rapidly as a result of his failing leadership. Most of the Roman army was killed or enslaved, except for about 10,000 led by or eventually reunited with Cassius, whose escape has sometimes been characterized as a desertion.H.H. Scullard, From the Gracchi to Nero (Routledge, 5th edition 1982, originally published 1959), p. 129 online. It was one of the worst military disasters in Roman history. ==Legacy== The civil war between Caesar and Pompeius is often said to have been made inevitable by the deaths of two people: Caesar's daughter Julia, whose political marriage to Pompeius surprised Roman social circles by its affection; and Marcus Crassus, whose political influence and wealth had been a counterweight to the two greater militarists. It would be idle to speculate on what role Publius Crassus might have played either in the civil war or during Caesar's resulting dictatorship. In many ways, his career follows a course similar to the early life of Decimus Brutus, whose role in the assassination of Caesar was far from foreseeable.Ronald Syme, Sallust (University of California Press, 1964, reprinted 2002), p. 40 online, “The Sons of Crassus” reprint p. 1223, “Marriage Ages for Roman Senators” p. 325; Matthew B. Roller, Constructing Autocracy: Aristocrats and Emperors in Julio- Claudian Rome (Princeton University Press, 2001), p. 177 online. Elizabeth Rawson concludes: At the time of his assassination, Caesar was planning a war against Parthia in retaliation for Carrhae. Marcus Antonius made the attempt, but suffered another defeat by the Parthians. The lost standards of the Roman army were finally restored by Augustus. ===Cornelia as widow=== :See also Cornelia Metella. Plutarch has Cornelia claim that she tried to kill herself upon learning of her young husband's death.Plutarch, Life of Pompey 74, Bill Thayer's edition at LacusCurtius online. Since Roman widows were not expected to display suicidal grief, Plutarch's dramatization may suggest the depth of Cornelia's emotion at the loss.Rawson, “ Crassorum funera,” p. 546. She is unlikely to have been more than twenty years old at the time. The marriage seems to have produced no children, though Syme speculated about “an unknown daughter.”Ronald Syme, The Augustan Aristocracy (Oxford University Press, 1989) p. 276 online. As a young and desirable widow, Cornelia then married Pompeius Magnus the following year, becoming his fifth and final wife. Pompeius was more than thirty years her senior. Swift remarriage was not unusual, and perhaps even customary, for aristocratic Romans after the death of a spouse. Despite the age difference, which met with disapproval, this marriage too was said to be affectionate, even passionate.Susan Treggiari, Roman Marriage: Iusti Coniuges from the Time of Cicero to the Time of Ulpian (Oxford University Press, 1991), pp. 258–259 online, also pp. 500–502 et passim. Cornelia was widowed a second time when Pompeius was killed and beheaded in Egypt during the civil war. In Roman literature, Cornelia becomes almost the type of the gifted woman whose life is delimited by the tragic ambitions of her husbands. In his Life of Pompey, Plutarch has her blame the weight of her own daimon, heavy with the death of Crassus, for Pompeius's change in fortune.Frederick E. Brent, “An Imperial Heritage: The Religious Spirit of Plutarch of Chaironeia,” Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt 2.36.1 (De Gruyter, 1987), p. 310 online. Susan Treggiari remarks that Plutarch's portrayal of the couple “is not to be sharply distinguished from that of star-crossed lovers elsewhere in poetry.”Susan Treggiari, Roman Marriage, p. 259 online. Lucan dramatizes the couple's fateful romance to an extreme in his often satiric epic Bellum Civile, where throughout Book 5 Cornelia becomes emblematic of the Late Republic itself, of its greatness and ruin by its most talented men.Susan Treggiari, Roman Marriage p. 477. ===(P. Licinius?) Apollonius=== A lost biography of Publius Crassus was written by his Greek secretary Apollonius, who accompanied him on the Parthian campaign but presumably escaped with Cassius. Eight years after the battle, Cicero wrote a letter of recommendation to Caesar on behalf of Apollonius, praising him for his loyalty.Cicero, Ad familiares 13.16. Since he was manumitted as a term of Publius's will, he is by Roman custom likely to have taken the name Publius Licinius Apollonius as a freedman. The highly laudatory account of Publius's death found in Plutarch suggests that Apollonius's biography was a source.For the available evidence on Apollonius, see Andrew Lintott, “A Historian in Cicero: Ad familiares – P. Licinius (?) Apollonius,” Rheinisches Museum für Philologie 119 (1976) 368. See also Elizabeth Rawson, Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), pp. 79, 110, 229; F.B. Titchener, \\"Critical Trends in Plutarch's Roman Lives, 1975–1990,\\" Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt 2.55.6 (De Gruyter 1992), p. 4146 online. ===Marcus, surviving brother=== Publius's surviving brother, Marcus, went to Gaul as Caesar's quaestor in 54 BC, the year before the Parthian defeat. His service record is undistinguished.Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 5.24.3 and 46, 1; 6.6.1; Ronald Syme, The Augustan Aristocracy (Oxford University Press, 1989), p. 272 online, and “The Sons of Crassus,” reprint p. 1222ff. In 49 BC, Caesar as dictator appointed Marcus governor of Cisalpine Gaul, the ethnically Celtic north of Italy.Appian, Bellum Civile, 2.41.165. He appears to have remained a loyal partisan of Caesar. The Augustan historian Pompeius Trogus, of the Celtic Vocontii, said that the Parthians feared especially harsh retribution in any war won against them by Caesar, because the surviving son of Crassus would be among the Roman forces.Pompeius Trogus, in the epitome of Justin, 42.4.6. His son, also named Marcus, resembled his uncle Publius in the scope of his military talent and ambition, and was not afraid to assert himself under the hegemony of Augustus. This Marcus (consul 30 BC), called by Syme an “illustrious renegade,”Syme, “The Sons of Crassus,” reprint p. 1224. was to be the last Roman outside the imperial family to earn a triumph from the senate.Syme, The Augustan Aristocracy, pp. 273–274 online. ===In literature=== Historians consistently record the death of Publius along with that of his far more famous father.Livy, Periocha 106; Valerius Maximus 1.6.11; Trogus (in Justin's epitome) 42.4.4; Ammianus Marcellinus 23.3.1; Orosius 6.13.3; Eutropius 6.18. Latin poets who allude to the infamous military disaster often speak of the Crassi, plural. Ovid notes that Augustus built the Temple of Mars Ultor (\\"Mars the Avenger\\") to fulfill a vow made to the god if he would help avenge Caesar's murder and the Roman loss at Carrhae, where the Crassorum funera (\\"deaths of the Crassi\\") had enhanced the Parthians' sense of superiority.Ovid, Fasti 5.571–588; see also 6.465-469 and Ars Amatoria 1.179. Plural Crassi also in Propertius 2.10.14 and 3.4.9. Sidonius Apollinaris repeats Ovid's phrase funera Crassorum in Carmen 7.100. Eutropius, four centuries after the fact, takes note of Publius as “a most illustrious and outstanding young man.”Eutropius, Breviarium 6.18: clarissimo et praestantissimo iuvene. As author? The geographer Strabo refers to a treatise on the Cassiterides, the semi-legendary Tin Islands off the coast of Britain, written by a Publius CrassusStrabo, 3.5.11, Bill Thayer's edition at LacusCurtius online. but not now extant. Several scholars of the 19th and early 20th centuries, including Theodor MommsenTheodor Mommsen, History of Rome (1894), vol. 4, p. 63 = Römische Geschichte (1889), vol. 3, p. 269, as cited by Holmes, Ancient Britain p. 495, note 1. and T. Rice Holmes, thought that this prose work resulted from an expedition during Publius's occupation of Armorica.Various views on the subject documented by T. Rice Holmes, \\"The Cassiterides, Ictis, and the British Trade in Tin,\\" in Ancient Britain and the Invasions of Julius Caesar (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1907) pp. 483–498; on authorship, pp. 494–497 online. Scholars of the 20th and early 21st centuries have been more inclined to assign authorship to the grandfather, during his proconsulship in Spain in the 90s BC, in which case Publius's Armorican mission may have been prompted in part by business interests and a desire to capitalize on the earlier survey of resources.Christopher Hawkes, “Britain and Julius Caesar,” Proceedings of the British Academy 63 (1977) 124–192; also J.S. Richardson, Hispaniae: Spain and the Development of Roman Imperialism, 218–82 BC (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 159 online. T. Corey Brennan, in The Praetorship in the Roman Republic (Oxford University Press, 2000), vol. 2, p. 501 online, calls the expedition to the Cassiterides “a purely scientific trip,” without apparent irony. ==Selected bibliography== *Rawson, Elizabeth. “Crassorum funera.” Latomus 41 (1982) 540–549. *Syme, Ronald. “The Sons of Crassus.” Latomus 39 (1980) 403–408. ==References== Category:80s BC births Category:53 BC deaths Category:1st-century BC Romans Category:Ancient Roman military personnel who committed suicide Category:Ancient Romans killed in action Category:Augurs of the Roman Republic Publius Category:Male suicides Category:Moneyers of ancient Rome Category:People of the Roman–Parthian Wars Category:Roman people of the Gallic Wars ","title":"Publius Licinius Crassus (son of triumvir)"},{"id":"19261104","text":"To put \\"lipstick on a pig\\" means making superficial or cosmetic changes to a product in a futile effort to disguise its fundamental failings. ==Etymology== Pigs have long been featured in proverbial expressions: a \\"pig's ear\\", a \\"pig in a poke\\", as well as the Biblical expressions \\"pearls before swine\\" and \\"ring of gold in a swine's snout\\". Indeed, whereas the phrase \\"lipstick on a pig\\" seems to have been coined in the 20th century, the concept of the phrase may not be particularly recent. The similar expression, \\"You can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear\\" seems to have been in use by the middle of the 16th century or earlier. Thomas Fuller, the British physician, noted the use of the phrase \\"A hog in armour is still but a hog\\" in 1732, here, as the Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (1796) later noted \\"hog in armour\\" alludes to \\"an awkward or mean looking man or woman, finely dressed.\\" The Baptist preacher Charles Spurgeon (1834–1892) recorded the variation \\"A hog in a silk waistcoat is still a hog\\" in his book of proverbs The Salt-Cellars (published 1887).Ben Zimmer, Who First Put 'Lipstick on a Pig'? Slate.com 10 September 2008 The \\"lipstick\\" variant of the phrase is more modern (the word \\"lipstick\\" itself was only coined in 1880). The rhetorical effect of linking pigs with lipstick was explored in 1926 by Charles F. Lummis, in the Los Angeles Times, when he wrote \\"Most of us know as much of history as a pig does of lipsticks.\\" However, the first recorded uses of \\"putting lipstick on a pig\\" are later. In Stella Gibbons' Westwood (published in 1946) Hebe visits a hair salon and has her hair \\"contemptuously washed by Miss Susan, who had a face like a very young pig that had managed to get hold of a lipstick\\".Gibbons, Stella Westwood, 1946 In an article in the Quad-City Herald (Brewster, Washington) from 31 January 1980, it was observed that \\"You can clean up a pig, put a ribbon on tail, spray it with perfume, but it is still a pig.\\" The phrase was also reported in 1985 when The Washington Post quoted a San Francisco radio host from KNBR remarking \\"That would be like putting lipstick on a pig\\" in reference to plans to refurbish Candlestick Park (rather than constructing a new stadium for the San Francisco Giants). In a 1983 article, \\"Sugar Loaf Key: Tales Of The Swine Family\\", Hunter S. Thompson describes a prank in which he put lipstick on the head of a pig and put it in the toilet of a Florida resort owner.Gonzo Papers, Vol. 3: Songs of the Doomed: More Notes on the Death of the American Dreamp.207 ==21st-century usage== In May 2002, brokerage firm Charles Schwab Corporation ran a television advertisement pointing out Wall Street brokerage firms' conflicts of interest by showing an unidentified sales manager telling his salesmen, \\"Let's put some lipstick on this pig!\\" The ad appeared shortly after New York's Attorney General Eliot Spitzer announced that Merrill Lynch stock analysts had recommended stocks that they privately called \\"dogs\\". CBS refused to air the ad. The phrase was then used in political rhetoric to criticize spin, and to insinuate that a political opponent is attempting to repackage established policies and present them as new. Victoria Clarke, who was Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs under Donald Rumsfeld, published a book about spin in politics titled Lipstick on a Pig: Winning In the No-Spin Era by Someone Who Knows the Game. The book argued, using anecdotes from her own career, that spin does not work in an age of transparency, when everyone will find out the truth anyway (\\"you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig\\").Wendy Greenberg in Newswise Issue No. 200606, June 2006. By 2008, the phrase had become common and often controversial political invective in the United KingdomLabour 'lipstick on a pig' attack BBC news website Wednesday, 26 July 2006 BBC and the United States.

Both father and mother are said to have been of good family. According to Leger's Life of Archbishop Walsh, Peter had five brothers who also became Jesuits: Luke, Thomas, Michael, Daniel, and Walter. The Franciscan Luke Wadding, and the Jesuit Ambrose Wadding, were his cousins. Wadding studied humanities for seven years in Ireland, and then proceeded to Douai, where he graduates M.A., and subsequently doctor of both laws as well as of divinity. He was admitted to the Company of Jesus on 24 October 1601 by Father Oliveræus, the provincial of Flanders, and commenced his novitiate at Tournai on 23 November 1601. When he joined the novitiate at Tournai, he gave his birth year as 1583. Eventually he became professor of theology first at Louvain, and then at Antwerp. In 1629 Wadding was transferred to Prague, becoming professor of theology and chancellor of the university. The last years of his life were spent at Graz, where he was professor of theology and also chancellor. He died there on 13 September 1644. ==Works== While at Antwerp Wadding had a controversy with the famous Arminian Simon Episcopius. The disputations of both were published in Dutch after their death in one volume, entitled Twee brieven van den gelerden Peter Wading in sijn level Jesuit tot Antwerpen: d’eene, van den Regel des Geloofs’ d’andere,. van den beeldendienst … Amsterdam, 1649, 4to (British Museum). On 30 November 1632 Wadding completed a Brevis Refutatio Calumniarum quas Collegio Societatis Jesu Pragensi impegit scriptor famosi libelli cui titulus “Flagellum Jesuitarum”, præsertim in negotio Academiæ Pragnensis … Nissa, 1634, 4to. This was followed by a solid work of 656 pages, entitled R.P. Petri Wadingi Waterfordiensis Hibernie Soc. Jes S. Theologiæ professoris, olim in Lovaniensi nunc in Pragensi Academia professoris Tractatus de Incarnation, Antwerp, 1636, 8vo. In the following year he published an Oratio Pragæ dicta, congratulating Ferdinand III on his election as emperor. Besides the works mentioned, Wadding’s contemporary fellow Jesuit, Pedro de Ribadeneira, says he published under a pseudonym, Carmina varia et alia spectantia ad disciplinas humaniores, and Tractatus aliquos contra Hæreticos (Ribadeneira, ‘’Bibl. Scriptt. Soc. Jesu’’’, 1643, p. 402). A manuscript volume in the Bodleian Library contains various other treatises by him (Tanner, p. 744). According to Edmund Hogan, SJ, Peter Wadding's writings are as follows: # Carmina varia et alia spectantia ad Disciplinas Humaniores # Tractatus aliquot contra Haereticos # Brevis Refutatio Calumniarum quas Collegio Societatis Jesu Pragensi impegit Scriptor famosi libelli cui titulus \\"Flagellum Jesuiticum,\\" praesertim in negotio Academiae Pragensis, 1634, 4to # De Incarnatione, 4to, 1634 # Oratio Pragae dicta in Ferdinandi III.

The village has a population of 270. ==References== Boria ","title":"Boria, Poland"},{"id":"19261279","text":"The speed doors are flexible and light doors for intensive industrial use.High-speed doors are door systems, mainly used in industrial applications. They are technical enhancements of the generally known sectional doors, PVC fabric doors or roller shutters. The main difference is that the durable construction provides a higher operating speed and they are able to sustain a higher number of cycles (opening and closing cycles) and require lower maintenance and repair cost. Depending on the intended field of application, horizontal or vertical operating door types are available. In North America, the Door and Access Systems Manufacturing Association (DASMA) defines high- performance doors as non-residential, powered doors, characterized by rolling, folding, sliding or swinging action, that are either high-cycle (minimum 100 cycles/day) or high-speed (minimum 20 inches(508 mm)/second), and two out of three of the following: made-to-order for exact size and custom features, designed to be able to withstand equipment impact (break-away if accidentally hit by vehicle) or designed to sustain heavy usage with minimal maintenance. == Application == High-speed doors are usually used wherever goods traffic occurs and where the doors have to fulfill special requirements. In the food and beverage industry, or Medical industry for example, special climatic conditions have to prevail; short opening and closing times reduce cooling loss, avoid airflow and enable a smooth operating procedure. They can also be designed in larger dimensions for the mining and aircraft industries. Beverage industry: Intelligent airlock solutions can be achieved by means of high-speed doors. Two doors with highly transparent laths gives a clear view throughout. Pressure and temperature differences can easily be controlled by an airlock where the transporter enters the airlock, and the one door cannot be operated before the other has closed. This is also used in security applications. Food, clean, and pharmaceutical processes: In the strict environmental constraints of pharmaceutical and aggressive environments of the food processes, where hygiene is imperative, doors must not only provide a structure made of stainless steel or composite materials to prevent corrosion, but they must also ensure an exposure time as short as possible to reduce the risk of airborne contamination. Car manufacturing industry: The automotive industry is an industry where high-speed doors are well known. High volumes of cars are produced in short periods of time. High-speed doors are vital for the logistics processes, high speed and low maintenance ensures optimum production. Special high-speed folding doors are used on the dynamo tuning cells. Profitability: High-speed doors may increase the efficiency of many companies. High opening speeds minimize the waiting time in front of the doors and thus accelerate the logistic processes, and control temperatures and pressure differences while saving energy, isolating clean areas from airborne contamination but still optimizing traffic flow. https://suachuatulanh.org/ Refrigeration: Refrigerators require an easy transfer between different zones of temperature and humidity. High-speed doors work in order to best ensure the most comprehensive maintenance of temperature in a refrigerator through the latest technologies available. The easy temperature transition from zone to zone is blocked by technologies designed for this sector. In this case is very important the flexibility and rapidity of high-speed doors. Chemical Factory: Design requirements for explosion-proof electrical equipment are dispensed by ATEX legislation, which reports the levels of the electrical standard requirements complying conservative prescriptions. In places where men work with highly volatile and flammable products, the best advice is to rely on a manufacturer of rapid flexible doors, guaranteed and reliable. Pneumatic components react quickly in complete safety. Supermarket Sector: Rapid doors for food businesses provide the minimum requirements of hygiene and protection of unauthorized personnel, as for example in a supermarket. Since it is quite likely that in the area next to the door we can find unauthorized and untrained customers. Hangar Zone: With large openings where high-speed doors work in airports and naval ports it is required to provide an easy, quick and safe passage from inside to outside, and vice versa. Although the deposits of naval vessels are a very difficult environment to operate, places where the service of maintenance to ships or insurance protection from the sea can be requested at any time. With uptime 100%, airports can not break on time. == Requirements == High strains, caused by the high operating speed (up to 4 m/s) and the frequency of openings, have to be taken into account during construction. In the same way, basic conditions like size and installation location add up to considerable requirements regarding safety and control technique. A unique \\"roll-up\\" system generally defines a high-speed door from a conventional roller door. The door's main objective is to produce a high opening speed and the guiding system must allow smooth operations with minimal friction. Effortless movement will ensure the longevity of the door's moving parts and operating soundness. The latest versions of high quality high-speed doors use a spiral guiding system, thus keeping the door blade apart through a whole operating cycle, ensuring effortless movement of the door's roller devices in the guiding system and contributing to the excessive high speed. Excessive because these doors, by opening so fast and closing very slowly, are just trying to avoid getting their rigid closing edge caught by a forklift, at the expense of the insulation. A counterbalance system generally forms part of the door's construction. This is designed with spring or weight mechanisms in the side frames, ensuring an emergency opening function and aiding to the opening speed. == Regulation == In Europe, after a few incidents due to the excessive speed of the curtain and the stiffness of the embedded sensor, the European Community has implemented new regulations (EN 13241-1). Among the various normative constraints, the requirement against mechanical crushing during closure makes necessary to prevent contact with the door being closed or, in case of contact, to limit the vertical dynamic load below a strict curve. If the high-speed door does not meet one or more of these constraints, the closing speed will be limited to 0.5 m/s (1.64 ft/s). Only a few manufacturers offering a fully flexible and harmless sealing edge kept possibility of closing at a higher speed. == References == Category:Doors ","title":"High-speed door"},{"id":"19261284","text":"Bokaro Ispat Vidyalayas are a set of schools in the town of Bokaro Steel City, Jharkhand, India run by Education Department of Bokaro Steel Limited.http://wvw.sail.co.in/peri-edu.asp In every sector (total 12 sector in Bokaro) minimal one middle and one high school were established.

This spending would be funded by setting aside 25% of the state's mining and petroleum royalty revenue. Following the 2008 state election, the National Party used its balance of power in the WA parliament to form government with the Liberals led by Colin Barnett, by trading Nationals support in exchange for spending guarantees under the policy. == Main policy features == * 25% of all royalty payments to the state to be set aside for reinvestment into regional WA * Funds to be held in a special investment fund (SIF), capped at AU$1 billion annually * Disbursements from the SIF to be over and above consolidated revenue allocations for the regions * SIF funds to be distributed on an agreed formula to: ** Regional councils for local projects; ** Regional projects developed and prioritised with the involvement of Regional Organisations of Councils and Regional Development Commissions; ** Statewide projects developed and prioritised by the Regional Development Council; and ** State Government initiatives that boost and leverage regional growth and investment, In 2006-07, the state received royalties totalling $2.1 billion (2007-08 forecast:$2.5 billion, 2008-09:$2.7 billion). This data suggests that $675 million of annual funding could be assigned under the policy. According to the Western Australian Department of Regional Development, Royalties for Regions delivered $3.67 billion to regional areas between December 2008 and June 2014. In 2013-14 $1.06 billion was invested. == Responses == On 10 September 2008, WA's Department of Treasury and Finance issued a public statement saying that the policy could threaten the state's AAA sovereign credit rating. which would cause an increase in the cost of short-term funding. Under Treasurer Tim Marney said that the plan would cost $2.8 billion in additional expenditure over the next four years, and in the absence of offsetting changes, take the net debt to revenue ratio to around 53% by 2011-12. 47% is the financial target adopted by Treasury to maintain the rating. The state budget is currently in surplus with $203 million the forecast surplus for 2011-12. Nationals leader Brendon Grylls stated that the ratio blowout could be avoided by reassessing major capital projects in Perth, such as the proposed $500 million museum redevelopment and the suburban rail extension to Ellenbrook which was expected to cost $850 million. Critics of the policy have suggested that the idea of the Nationals siding the Labor Party during the 2008 state election to achieve the outcome was a betrayal of the historical conservative leanings of the party as it has previously generally formed coalitions with the Liberal Party. In February 2014, Liberal Member for Hillarys and former Barnett Government minister Rob Johnson called for the policy to be abolished, stating: \\"With the unprecedented debt that we have at the moment and with it increasing every month, now is the time to make a long-overdue tough decision and tell our friends in the National Party that we can no longer afford to indulge them with this policy.\\" He asserted that Royalties for Regions had \\"significantly diminished the standing of the Liberal Party in regional WA relative to the National Party, while we also take the full hit in the city for the collateral damage in the form of various broken promises.\\" However, fellow Liberal state MP Graham Jacobs defended the policy, stating: \\"Of the total mining royalties in this state, which is a levy mining companies pay for extracting the sovereign wealth of WA, it is reasonable and logical to suggest one quarter of that total stay in the regions where 25 per cent of the people live, faced with all the matters associated with the tyrannies of distance.\\" In April 2014, the Western Australian Economic Regulation Authority (ERA) called for Royalties for Regions be either abolished or reformed significantly, stating: \\"The ERA considers that Royalties for Regions results in inefficient outcomes and should either be repealed or amended to restrict regional funding to an amount determined as part of the annual budget process.\\" Nationals WA leader Terry Redman rejected the ERA's findings, asserting his party would \\"die in a ditch on this issue... we do not want to go back to the dark old days when regional Western Australia was an afterthought.\\" A June 2014 report on Royalties for Regions by the Western Australian Auditor General found that, while the program had provided substantial infrastructure and service projects to regional Western Australia, it was unclear whether these projects were delivering their intended outcomes. In October 2014, Premier Colin Barnett stated: \\"The Royalties for Regions program has had the biggest effect on regional Western Australia in our history, and I don’t think there is anything equivalent to it elsewhere in Australia.” == See also == *Economy of Western Australia == References == Category:Politics of Western Australia Category:Economy of Western Australia ","title":"Royalties for Regions"},{"id":"19261302","text":"30 karatów szczęścia (30 Carats of Happiness) is a 1936 Polish comedy film directed by Michał Waszyński.

They had a 2-6-2 wheel arrangement and were equipped with Class 2'2' T 31 tenders. They were designed to replace the once ubiquitous Prussian P 8 engines that had been built between 1908 and 1924 and, in their day, were the most numerous post-war replacement class. ==Manufacture and Design== A class 023 working in the Moselle Valley, Easter 1972 From 1950, 105 examples of this newly designed class were manufactured for medium passenger train and light express train services. They had welded locomotive frames, boilers and tenders together with all the latest refinements of German practice. These included a superheated multiple-valve regulator and central lubrication of the least accessible parts of the running gear. Engines up to operating number 023 had Knorr surface preheaters and journal bearings. Locomotives with serial numbers 024 and 025, as well as those from 053 onwards were equipped with roller bearings for the axles and drive as well as mixer-preheaters. A small number of vehicles were given Heinl preheaters and several were equipped for push-pull train operations. ==Last new steam locomotive in West Germany== Locomotive number 23 105, built by Arnold Jung Lokomotivfabrik and taken into service by the DB in December 1959, was the last steam engine to enter service in the Federal Republic of Germany. After its retirement it was stabled at the Nuremberg Transport Museum where it was severely damaged by the great fire in the locomotive shed on 17 October 2005. ==Reclassification and retirement== On the introduction of the new DB numbering scheme on 1 January 1968 the class was redesignated as Class 023. The last few locomotives were retired in 1976 at Crailsheim locomotive depot (Bahnbetriebswerk or Bw). ==Preserved locomotives== The following engines had been preserved as at September 2006: * 23 019 in the German Steam Locomotive Museum (Deutsche Dampflokomotiv-Museum) at Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg in Upper Franconia, Bavaria, Germany. * 23 023 at the Stoom Stichting Nederland in Rotterdam, Netherlands (operational since march 2019). * 23 029 as a monument in front of the technical school in Aalen, Germany. * 23 042 at the Darmstadt-Kranichstein Railway Museum in Hesse, Germany (operational). * 23 058 with EUROVAPOR in Basel-Haltingen, Switzerland, is looked after by Club 41 073 e.

It allows people to walk with their friends and loved ones all the way to the passenger car at stations where the general public is not admitted to platforms. Railfans can also purchase platform tickets and enjoy their trainspotting hobbies.http://www.networkrail.co.uk/aspx/777.aspx They vary in type: some may only allow limited access and a sharply limited time of usage, while others may have totally free access to enter the platform area. During peak usage hours or rush hours, the platforms may only be available for passengers who intend to travel. ==History== Platform tickets emerged in the 19th century. At that time passenger coaches had no internal corridor, as they have today. In order to inspect tickets, conductors had to move along the outside of the train while it was in motion. Although trains moved much slower than today, there were numerous accidents. Therefore, railway operators began to check the tickets on the platform before passengers boarded the train. Passing these checkpoints required either a ticket for travel or the platform ticket, which was only valid for access to the platform. After railcars were changed, people and conductors could move from carriage to carriage so checking the tickets outside the train was no longer necessary. Most railway transport systems abolished this in the second half of the 20th century. As soon as there were no more checks, the platform ticket was unnecessary and generally was abandoned. However, as there are now automated ticket barriers, railfans and trainspotters buy these tickets to get past the barriers and onto the platform.http://www.networkrail.co.uk/aspx/777.aspx ==Usage by countryGermany=== In Germany the Royal Prussian Railway was the first carrier to introduce ticket checks outside the trains in 1893. Other railways in Germany soon followed. Platform checks and tickets were done away with in East Germany in 1970 and in West Germany in 1974. In some local transportation networks, they lasted longer; the last one in which they still apply is public transportation in Hamburg, where platform tickets must be bought to access the platforms without a travel ticket. The price is 0.10 euros. ===India=== Platform ticket of Pune Junction, Indian Railways A platform ticket in India costs Rs 50 (increased in 2020https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/to- regulate-crowds-railway-zones-hike-price-of-platform-tickets-from-rs-10-to- rs-50/articleshow/74674817.cms ) and is valid for one person only. The cost of platform tickets at some select stations (Pune and Thiruchirapally division) has been increased to 10, due to increased crowding at the stations. It allows the person to access the platforms for a time period of two hours. A person having a railway ticket for a train on the same day is not required to have a platform ticket. The platform ticket can be bought on any ticket reservation booth in the railway station. If caught without a platform ticket if the person is not a traveller, he/she may be fined anywhere from 250 to 270. ===Japan=== Japan Railways Group (JR Group) companies sell priced between 120 yen and 160 yen at all staffed stations and , which allow unlimited access to the platform area for one month, priced between 3,780 yen and 4,890 yen at limited stations. They do not allow holders to board trains. All staffed stations of JR East, JR Central and JR West, and stations of JR Hokkaido with automatic ticket gates limit the validity of the ticket to two hours from issuance; an additional fee is charged if the ticket holder exits the ticket gate after the two-hour period expires.JR East: Information on tickets ===United Kingdom=== Platform ticket of Ecclesbourne Valley Railway, England Platform tickets were in common use on the mainline network until the mid 20th century, and the majority of ticket offices are still equipped to issue them. The use of automated ticket barriers at stations has resulted in a renewed demand for platform tickets. Railfans, in particular, are told that they may require a platform ticket for access to platforms, but some individuals have cited difficulty in obtaining them. They are valid for one hour and cost £0.10; the last price increase was in January 1988. Some heritage railways and museums issue platform tickets for admittance or as souvenirs. ===United States=== While not a platform ticket per se, Bay Area Rapid Transit charges a specialty excursion fare for entering and exiting the system within three hours at the same station. == References == Category:Railway stations Category:Tickets ","title":"Platform ticket"},{"id":"19261414","text":"Anonymous For Animal Rights activists march in Tel Aviv, 2011 Animals Now (formerly Anonymous for Animal Rights) is an animal rights group based in Israel and founded in 1994.

Hodge's first musical training took place in Oregon. In 1999, he began a course of study in Germany at the Staatliche Hochschule für Musik und Darstellende Kunst in Stuttgart with funding from the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst. Between 2002 and 2008, he was an Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Fellow at Columbia University where he studied Composition under the instruction of Tristan Murail and Fred Lerdahl. Hodge graduated with MA and DMA degrees from Columbia. Hodge is the winner of the Charles Ives Living, awarded by the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2018, a 2012 Guggenheim Fellowship, the 2010–2011 Rome Prize, the 2008 Gaudeamus Prize, commissions from the Fromm, and Koussevitzky Music Foundations, and the Aaron Copland Residency Award from the Aaron Copland House. He is professor and chair of music composition at the University of Washington, Seattle. ==Compositional Style== Two salient elements in Hodge’s music are the incorporation of timbre as an integral form-bearing compositional device, and an approach to musical structure that emphasizes gradual change over time. As such, his music bears traces of American Minimalism and Franco-European Spectralism,https://www.babelscores.com/fr/HuckHodge though Jonathan Bernard questions this ascription, pointing out that his approach is somewhat iconoclastic in its reliance on philosophical ideas as the impetus and justification for musical materials and structures.

He was the youngest son of the General François de Chasseloup-Laubat, 1st Marquis of Chasseloup-Laubat (1754-1833), and of his wife Anne-Julie Fresneau de La Gataudière, granddaughter of François Fresneau de La Gataudière who had discovered the properties of rubber. His godparents were Emperor Napoleon I and his first wife Empress Josephine. His brother, Justin (1800-1847), 2nd Marquis of Chasseloup-Laubat, was a military and politician and died as he was serving as French ambassador to the German Confederation. At his death, the title of Marquis passed to his brother Prudent (1802-1863), also a military and politician, who as well died childless and was succeeded by Prosper. They had also a sister, Anne-Clémence de Chasseloup-Laubat (1798-1871) who married in 1818 François-Scipion, 1st Baron de Bernon. Prosper de Chasseloup-Laubat was educated at Lycée Louis-le-Grand then became a civil servant and from 1828 worked at the Conseil d'État, thanks to the good relations of his father. ==CareerUnder the July Monarchy=== Immediately after the July Revolution, Chasseloup-Laubat became aide-de-camp of the commander of the National Guard, Marquis de La Fayette, and despite the change of regime he remained at the Conseil d'État and was promoted inside its inner hierarchy. In 1836, he was appointed as an assistant to Jean-Jacques Baude, Royal commissary in Algeria, and worked at Alger, and then at Tunis, Bône and Constantine. He was present at the failed siege of Constantine by the French army in November 1836, before turning back to France and reassuming his functions at the Conseil d'État. In 1838 he was appointed a councillor at the Conseiller d'État. At the same time, he was also beginning a political career. On 3 September 1837, he was elected deputy of Charente-Inférieure, the Department where was situated the family seat, the château of La Gataudière, and he was reelected in November 1837, March 1839, July 1842 and August 1846. He took his seat with the Left Center and approved the government policy. He was also a member and then president of the departmental council of the Charente- Inférieure. ===Minister under the Second Empire and advocate of French colonialism=== Prosper de Chasseloup-Laubat according to Honoré Daumier. The Revolution of 1848 was a momentary set-back for his career, but on 13 May 1849 he was elected again as a deputy for Charente-Inférieure. During the Second Republic, he voted with the Conservatives of the Party of Order and from 10 April to 26 October 1851 briefly served a first time as Minister of Marine under the Presidency of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte. After the coup d'état of December 1851, he was appointed a member of the consultative commission replacing the Chambre des Députés, and was one of the candidates of the government in Charente-Inférieure at the election of February 1852, where he was elected. As deputy to the Legislative Body (a new lower chamber replacing the Chambre des Députés), he worked for the restoration of the Empire, which was approved by referendum in November 1852. Nevertheless, in 1852 he was one of the members of the Legislative Body who took the liberty of criticizing the first budget of the new regime (they were called les budgétaires), and the same year he publicly protested the confiscation of the properties of the House of Orléans. He stayed a deputy until 1859, when he became a minister. On 25 May 1862, he was appointed a Senator of the Empire, a position he retained until the fall of the Empire in 1870. Chasseloup-Laubat was an enthusiastic proponent of French colonial imperialism.Henry Kamm, Dragon Ascending: Vietnam and the Vietnamese, New York, 1996, p. 89. Member of the \\"Council of colonisation\\" which assisted the newly created Ministry for Algeria and the Colonies, in March 1859 he was himself put at the head of the Ministry in replacement of Prince Napoléon. Belonging to a generation of new politicians working to give a coherence to French colonial policy, he was one of the few ministers of Napoleon III who had not already held ministerial offices when the Second Empire was established. Just one month later, he personally visited Algeria, which he had known at the time of its conquest. He lost direct control over Algeria with the reestablishment of the function of Governor General of Algeria, but immediately became Minister of Marine and the Colonies in November 1860 and held that position for an exceptionally long period (1860-1867), making him a key figure of French early colonial expansion. He worked in combination with his counterpart, Foreign Minister Édouard Drouyn de Lhuys. He was Minister at the time of the attacks on Danang and Saigon in Vietnam led by Rigault de Genouilly and his successor Counter-Admiral Théogène François Page. On 18 February 1859, the French conquered Saigon and three southern Vietnamese provinces. The Vietnamese government was forced to cede temporary control of those territories to France in June 1862. When in 1863 the Vietnamese diplomat Phan Thanh Gian visited Napoleon III on an embassy in Paris, Chasseloup-Laubat pressured Napoleon III to have him give up a promise he had made to return the territories captured by the French in exchange for a loose French protectorate over the whole of Vietnam. He threatened Napoleon III with his resignation and that of the whole cabinet, forcing him to order the cancellation of the agreement in June 1864.Oscar Chapuis, The Last Emperors of Vietnam: from Tu Duc to Bao Dai, Westport (Conn.) - London, 2000, pp. 50-51. Chasseloup-laubat conceived the idea of conquest in the Far east, and asserted in February 1863, “it is a real empire that we need to create for ourselves.”S. Lemaire, P. Blanchard and N. Bancel, \\"Milestones in Colonial Culture under the Second Empire (1851–1870)\\", in Colonial Culture in France since the Revolution, ed. P. Blanchard, S. Lemaire, N. Bancel and D. Thomas, Indiana University Press, 2014, p. 78. In 1864, all the French territories in southern Vietnam were declared to be the new French colony of Cochinchina. During his tenure as Minister of the Marine and the Colonies, he also modernised the French navy and inspired the creation at Brest of an institution for the orphans of the navy, placing it under the special protection of the Emperor. With the help of his wife, he was also an actor of the elaborate social life of the Second Empire, a period popularly referred to as the fête impériale (\\"the Imperial festival\\"). On 13 February 1866, he gathered one of the most flamboyant receptions of the time, a masquerade ball during which, dressed as a Venetian noble, he received his 3000 guests (between whom the Emperor and the Empress) in the restored salons of the ministry, Rue Royale. The climax of the reception, which lasted until half past six in the morning, was a \\"Cortege of the Nations\\". It was also a symbolic expression of the minister's political stance and of France's imperialist aspirations.M. Battesti, La Marine de Napoléon III: une politique navale, Chambéry - Paris - Vincennes, 1997, vol. 1, p. 261. Chasseloup-Laubat was recalled to the government on 17 July 1869, as Minister-President of the Conseil d'État, and took part to the constitutional changes which were expected to transform the Second Empire into a parliamentary monarchy. However, after the collective resignation of the cabinet in December 1869, Émile Ollivier did not include Chasseloup-Laubat in the new cabinet he formed on 2 January 1870. He remained a senator until the end of the Second Empire. After the fall of Napoléon III, Chasseloup-Laubat was elected once again a Deputy of Charente-Inférieure to the new National Assembly on 8 February 1871 and took his seat with the Orléanist parliamentary group, Centre droit. He still played a minor role as rapporteur of the law on the organisation of the army in 1872, and died one year later in Paris. He is buried at the Père Lachaise Cemetery. ==Private life== On 18 August 1862 at Saint Augustin,C. Baroche, Second Empire. Notes et souvenirs, Paris, 1921, p. 212. he married Marie-Louise Pilié (5 December 1841, New Orleans - April 1921, ParisLe Figaro, 2 avril 1921: \\"Mme la marquise de Chasseloup Laubat douairière, veuve de l'ancien ministre de la marine sous Napoléon III, s'est pieusement éteinte, après une courte maladie, en son domicile, 4, rue de Marignan, à l'âge de soixante-dix-neuf ans.\\" ), a distant relative of his, whose family was from Saintonge, but established in Louisiana. She was the daughter of Louis Armand Pilié and of Rose Elisabeth Eleonore Lapice de Bergondy,Biographical and Historical Memoirs of Louisiana, Chicago, 1892, p. 534. and a niece of Southern General P. G. T. Beauregard.David Carroll, Henri Mercier and the American Civil War, Princeton, 1971, p. 344. She fostered her husband's career by playing the role of a social hostess for the high society of the Second Empire. They had two sons, who both were notable in sport: *Louis de Chasseloup-Laubat, 5th Marquis of Chasseloup-Laubat (1863–1954) was president of the French Fencing Federation (Fédération française d'escrime) and co-wrote the rules for international fencing competition. *Count Gaston de Chasseloup- Laubat (1867–1903), a race car driver, is known for setting the first recognised automobile land speed record.

During the latter conflict, he recruited and commanded four infantry regiments from the commonwealth of Pennsylvania and led two different brigades in the Eastern Theater. As the war progressed, worsening health problems precluded prolonged field service, but Nagle is perhaps best known for his actions at the 1862 Battle of Antietam, where his brigade played a key role in securing Burnside's Bridge, a key crossing over the contested Antietam Creek. ==Early life and career== Nagle was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, as the eldest of eight children born and raised by Daniel and Mary Nagle. His grandfather had been a drummer in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. His family moved several times when he was a child, finally settling in 1835 in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, where in 1842 he organized what became the Washington Artillery Company. He learned the trades of paperhanger and painter from his father. When war was declared against Mexico a few years later, he enlisted with his men as Company B of the 1st Pennsylvania Volunteers. His regiment was stationed at the Perote Castle to keep open the communication with Veracruz during its siege. He assisted in routing a force of guerillas at La Hoya, fought at Huamantla, Puebla, and Atlixco, entered the city of Mexico, and was finally stationed at San Ángel until the close of the war. He was mustered out of service with his company at Philadelphia on July 27, 1848, and the inhabitants of Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, presented him with a commemorative silver and gold-plated sword.. Nagle subsequently resumed his business as a painter and paperhanger. In 1852, he was elected as the sheriff of Schuylkill County, a post he would occupy until war erupted in 1861. Also in 1852, Nagle married Elizabeth Kaercher, who bore nine children, seven of which lived to maturity.Nagle biography, Schuylkill County Civil War Group He was also on the Pottsville School Board, and was a member and then president of the borough council.48th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry webpage ==Civil War service== In 1861, following the outbreak of the Civil War, Nagle was commissioned as the colonel of the 6th Pennsylvania Infantry, a regiment with a three-month term of enlistment. Later that year, after his regiment mustered out of the service, he organized the three-years' 48th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment, of which he was made colonel. Among his men were four of his brothers, as well as much of the current membership of his old Washington Artillery. Nagle initially served at Fort Monroe in Virginia, and then in Hatteras Island and Newbern in North Carolina. On April 23, 1862, he was assigned command of the 1st Brigade of Maj. Gen. Jesse Reno's 2nd Division of the Department of North Carolina. Nagle commanded his brigade (now in the IX Corps under Reno) in the Second Battle of Bull Run. He was appointed brigadier general of volunteers on September 10, 1862, and at Antietam his brigade performed an important part in carrying what later became known as Burnside's Bridge, which, according to army commander George B. McClellan, saved the day. Nagle's appointment expired on March 4, 1863, but was renewed nine days later and he served with his brigade in Kentucky until May 9, when he resigned due to impaired health (he suffered from heart disease). He returned home to recuperate. When General Robert E. Lee invaded Pennsylvania in June 1863, Nagle organized the 39th Pennsylvania Volunteer Militia and was commissioned its colonel by Governor Andrew Curtin. He subsequently commanded a brigade of emergency militia, and was mustered out on August 2, 1863, following the end of the Gettysburg Campaign and the retreat of Lee's army into Virginia. In 1864 he organized the 149th Pennsylvania Infantry for 100 days' service, became its colonel, and guarded the approaches to Baltimore, Maryland, until the expiration of his service. ==Postbellum== After the war, Nagle resumed civilian life, but was in poor health from his ailing heart and liver. He died in 1866 at his Pottsville home, surrounded by his family. His well attended funeral was held on August 25, and he was buried in Pottsville's Presbyterian Cemetery. He is honored with a statue on the 48th Pennsylvania's monument on the Antietam Battlefield near Sharpsburg, Maryland. ==See also== * List of American Civil War generals (Union) ==NotesReferences== * Category:Union Army generals Category:People of Pennsylvania in the American Civil War Category:People from Reading, Pennsylvania Category:People from Pottsville, Pennsylvania Category:American military personnel of the Mexican–American War Category:United States Army generals Category:1822 births Category:1866 deaths ","title":"James Nagle (general)"},{"id":"19261508","text":"These are the Lists of Members of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong: ==Colonial period== * List of Legislative Council of Hong Kong unofficial members 1850–1941 * List of Legislative Council of Hong Kong unofficial members 1946–1985 ===Introduction of indirect elections=== * List of Legislative Council of Hong Kong members 1985–88 * List of Legislative Council of Hong Kong members 1988–91 * List of Legislative Council of Hong Kong members 1991–95 ===Fully elected legislature=== * List of Legislative Council of Hong Kong members elected in 1995 ==SAR administrationProvisional Legislative Council=== * List of Provisional Legislative Council of Hong Kong members ===Since 1998=== * List of Legislative Council of Hong Kong members elected in 1998 * List of Legislative Council of Hong Kong members elected in 2000 * List of Legislative Council of Hong Kong members elected in 2004 * List of Legislative Council of Hong Kong members elected in 2008 * List of Legislative Council of Hong Kong members elected in 2012 * List of Legislative Council of Hong Kong members elected in 2016 ==References== *Members ","title":"List of Members of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong"},{"id":"19261524","text":"The following highways are numbered 82A: ==United States== *25px Nebraska Link 82A *25px New York State Route 82A (former) *25px Oklahoma State Highway 82A (former) ","title":"List of highways numbered 82A"},{"id":"19261527","text":"William Connor (1909–1967) was a British journalist.

The leaves are opposite, broad lanceolate, long and wide. Aucuba japonica are dioecious. The flowers are small, diameter, each with four purplish-brown petals; they are produced in clusters of 10-30 in a loose cyme. The fruit is a red drupe approximately in diameter, which is avoided by birds. The variegation, considered by some to be an attractive property, is caused by 'Aucuba bacilliform', a putative species of virus in the genus Badnavirus. ==Cultivation and uses== Aucuba japonica was introduced into England in 1783 by Philip Miller's pupil John Graeffer, at first as a plant for a heated greenhouse. It became widely cultivated as the \\"gold plant\\" by 19th-century gardeners. The plants being grown were female, and it was a purpose of Robert Fortune's botanizing trip to newly opened Japan in 1861 to locate a male. It was located in the garden of Dr. Hall, resident at Yokohama, and sent to the nursery of Standish & Noble at Bagshot, Surrey. The firm's mother plant was fertilized and displayed, covered with red berries, at Kensington in 1864, creating a sensation that climaxed in 1891 with the statement from the Royal Horticultural Society's secretary, the Rev. W. Wilkes, \\"You can hardly have too much of it\\".Coats (1964) 1992. A reaction to its ubiquitous presence set in after World War II. This plant is valued for its ability to thrive in the most difficult of garden environments, dry shade. It also copes with pollution and salt-laden coastal winds. It is often seen as an informal hedge, but may also be grown indoors as a houseplant. Today numerous cultivars are available from garden centres. The most popular cultivar is 'Variegata', with yellow spots on the leaves;\\"...whose measled form is now so common that one hardly realizes that there is also an unspotted Aucuba, which can be quite a handsome bush\\" (Coats 1992). this is a female clone, a similar male clone being named 'Maculata'. The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: * 'Crotonifolia' * 'Golden King' * 'Rozannie' – A self-fertile variety not requiring a pollinator, produces deep red berries against solid green, glossy foliage. Other cultivars include:- *Form (botany)forma longifolia * 'Mr. Goldstrike' – Male plant with leaves heavily speckled in yellow. * 'Picturata' – Female plant with yellow foliage fringed with green. * 'Petite Jade' – Variety with narrower leaves than other species, slender, and serrated.

Gietrzwałd is the capital of Gmina Gietrzwałd. Gietrzwałd is a popular Roman Catholic pilgrimage destination. ==Natural geography== The area where Gietrzwałd is located has specific features caused by a glacier. As a result, the region has varied terrain and great richness and diversity of nature. The most important natural values of the region are its lakes and rivers. The Giławka River, which Gietrzwałd is situated upon, is the right tributary of the Pasłęka River. ==History== Home of the Polish folk poet and bookseller Andrzej Samulowski (1840–1928) Gietrzwałd was founded in 1352 within the Archdiocese of Warmia, then within the dominions of the Teutonic Order, by one Dietrich or Ditter, who named it Dietrichswald. In the 15th century, Gietrzwałd was destroyed during the Thirteen Years' War between Poland and the Teutonic Knights. The village was invaded by the Teutonic army under the command of Georg von Schlieben. In the middle of the 16th century, the settlement was not developing, although there was a school and an inn (Jerzy Kunig had been the owner of the inn since 1645). In 1772 the village was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in the First Partition of Poland, and subsequently the local Polish population was subjected to Germanisation. In 1783, there were 57 houses in Gietrzwałd. In 1807, the village was attacked and plundered by the French army in the Napoleonic wars. ===Marian Apparitions=== In the year 1877, according to the Catholics, the Virgin Mary was revealed to two people, little girls Stanisława Samulowska and Justyna Szafryńska. She appeared several times, speaking the Polish language (as opposed to German; Since in East Prussia German was the main language and there was Polish minority), and explained how important it is to pray and say the rosary.Wojciech Materski, Polska Matka Boska, Polityka: Wydanie Specjalne, 2/2008, ISSN 1730-0525 Since then, pilgrims from Poland and other countries, have been coming to Gietrzwałd to see the picture of the Virgin Mary and a spring with claimed miraculous powers. The Catholic Church acknowledged the Vision of the Mother of Christ as real in 1977. The town is now an official pilgrim area. ==Culture== There is a Communal Cultural Centre in Gietrzwałd. It is open all year. People can find tourist information there and buy handcrafts in a gallery. The Centre is the initiator and organizer of various events, which take place in the province. Furthermore, it is responsible for taking actions in social and cultural animation, education and art workshops for children and adults. right ===Religion=== The most important religious monument in Gietrzwałd is the Shrine of Virgin Mary and the Stations of the Cross located near the forest. There is also a rosary alley leading to the associated spring, the Chapel of the apparitions and the picture of Virgin Mary. This chapel is the most famous of the local chapels which are a distinctive element of the Warmian landscape. ==Education== Schools in Gietrzwałd: * Andrzej Samulowski Primary School * Priest W.

Samuel Fleming, born in Ireland in 1707, came to the present-day United States and worked nearby as a tavernmaster, and bought in present-day Flemington as the site for a home in 1741 from Thomas Penn, son of William Penn, the founder of the Province of Pennsylvania. After the house was constructed in 1756, the area becoming known as \\"The Fleming Settlement\\", then as \\"Fleming's\\" and was known as \\"Flemington\\" by the 1870s. Fleming operated a tavern, often said to be in the house itself, which was said to have been visited by General George Washington, who it was claimed wrote about \\"stopping at Fleming's\\" in his journal.The Small House that is a Big Mystery , Fleming Castle Museum. Accessed September 10, 2008. The site was sold to the Borough of Flemington by the Daughters of the American Revolution for use as a museum. The Castle has been arranged to depict typical life in the 18th century including a colonial-style kitchen, ladies parlor and tavern room. A 2007 study by an historic preservation consultancy hired by the borough determined that claims that the house had been used as tavern, as a stagecoach stop and as a post office, and that it had been visited by George Washington were untrue, and had been embellished based on a newspaper story dating to 1870. A review of historical documents showed that Fleming operated a tavern, but that it was not located in the historic house. Court records showed that the Fleming Castle property had been seized in a sheriff's sale in 1763 and the tavern was seized in a separate sale in 1766. Records also showed that Fleming had been given a license to operate a tavern in 1746, ten years before the house was built. Despite longstanding tradition, an analysis of contemporary documents found no mention of Washington ever having visited the site.Mallozzi, Vincent M. \\"A Castle’s Colorful Story Gets a Heavy Rewrite\\", The New York Times, April 1, 2007. Accessed September 10, 2008. The research also determined that there was no evidence that Fleming used the term \\"castle\\" to refer to his home. The minutes of a meeting of the Colonel Lowrey Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution held in 1906 contain the first reference to the site as the \\"Fleming Castle\\". The house was deeded to the Lowrey Chapter in 1927, which maintained the site and used it as its offices and as a museum. The group sold the house to the borough of Flemington in 2005 for $138,000. ==References *Samuel Fleming House Museum & Gardens - official site Category:Flemington, New Jersey Category:Museums in Hunterdon County, New Jersey Category:Historic house museums in New Jersey Category:Houses completed in 1756 Category:Houses in Hunterdon County, New Jersey Category:Historic district contributing properties in New Jersey Category:Historic district contributing properties in Hunterdon County, New Jersey Category:1756 establishments in New Jersey ","title":"Samuel Fleming House"},{"id":"19261563","text":"The Quack or Znachor is a 1937 Polish drama film directed by Michał Waszyński, an adaptation of the novel by Tadeusz Dołęga-Mostowicz published in the same year.

He was the oldest son of Li Shouli the Prince of Bin, the second son of Li Xian, one time crown prince under Li Xian's father Emperor Gaozong.New Book of Tang, vol. 70 . Early in the Kaiyuan (713-741) era of Li Shouli's cousin Emperor Xuanzong, Li Chenghong was created the Prince of Guangwu, and he did not succeed to the greater title of Prince of Bin upon his father's death in 741, suggesting that he was not born of Li Shouli's wife. (The title of Prince of Bin went to his younger brother Li Chengning (李承寧).) Li Chenghong had at one point been given the honorary title of Mishu Jian (秘書監), the director of the Palace Library—but as the title was honorary, he did not actually run the archival bureau.Old Book of Tang, vol. 86 . At one point, he was accused of improper associations with people and was demoted to be the secretary general to the prefect of Fang Prefecture (房州, in modern Shiyan, Hubei),New Book of Tang, vol. 81 . but was later recalled to the capital Chang'an and given the honorary title of minister of imperial clan affairs (宗正卿), but did not actually run the ministry of imperial clan affairs. ==Brief declaration as emperor== In 763, when Emperor Xuanzong's grandson Emperor Daizong was emperor, Tibet launched an attack against Chang'an, and Emperor Daizong was forced to flee to Shan Prefecture (陝州, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan). On November 18, 763, Tibetan forces entered Chang'an. A Tibetan general who defected from Tang, Gao Hui (高暉), and the Tibetan general Nganlam Takdra Lukhong (aka Ma Chongying, 馬重英) jointly declared Li Chenghong emperor, commissioning over 100 people as imperial officials, including the imperial scholars Yu Kefeng (于可封) and Huo Gui (霍瓌) as chancellors. Tibetan forces, however, were unable to force the chancellor Miao Jinqing, who was unable to flee Chang'an due to illness, to cooperate with Li Chenghong's regime. Soon, with the Tang general Guo Ziyi mounting a resistance movement, Tibetan forces pillaged the city and departed on November 30, 763. Li Chenghong hid in the wilderness but was recaptured by Guo's forces. Emperor Daizong issued a pardon for him but exiled him to Hua Prefecture (華州, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi).That Li Chenghong was exiled to Hua Prefecture was per the New Book of Tang, which the Zizhi Tongjian adopted. His biography in the Old Book of Tang indicated that he was exiled to Guo Prefecture (虢州, in modern Sanmenxia).

He is a male spirit associated with bringing rain and hail. His influence on these precipitations can be positive, resulting with the amount of rain beneficial for agriculture, or negative, with a drought, downpours, or hail. Rituals connected with German included making a doll intended to represent this personage. This effigy of German, made of rags, fired clay, or dried fruits, was rather large, usually with a distinct representation of the male genitals. It was produced and used in rituals exclusively by girls or young women.Janićijević, pages 184-186.Pešikan-Ljuštanović In eastern Serbia, when a drought developed, girls would make such a doll, and bring it to a river bank. Depending on the regional custom, they would either bury it by the river, or put it in a little casket and let it flow down the river. Two of the girls would then start lamenting for the doll. Asked by the others why they were crying, they would answer, \\"We are crying for German; because of the drought German has died for the rain to fall.\\" If the amount of rain would become excessive after that, the doll was dug out. In northern Bulgaria, the rituals with German usually followed immediately after the Dodola rituals, but could be performed independently from them. In some villages they were carried out on the Feast of Saint Germanus. Girls would make the doll, 20 to 50 cm long, and lay it on a slate or in a little casket. Having adorned it with flowers, they would bury it with funeral observances. After three, nine, or forty days, the doll was dug out, and thrown into water. People tried to prevent destructive summer hailstorms by placating German with a ritual performed on Christmas Eve. This ritual was recorded in the area around Pirot at the beginning of the 20th century. Immediately before the start of the Christmas Eve dinner, the head of the household would go out to his woodpile,The woodpile of a household is one of the border zones between the human and inhuman worlds in the mytho-magical world view of South Slavs. It can serve as a medium in the communication with spiritual beings. See (Page 2) to invite German to dinner. He would take with him a loaf of bread called \\"good luck\\", prepared particularly for this ritual, slivovitz, wine, and a wax candle. At the woodpile, he would shout three times, \\"German, German, wherever you are, come to dinner right now, and in the summer do not let me see your eyes anywhere!\\" He would then light the candle, take a sip of slivovitz, taste some bread, drink wine, and go back into his house. Asked what happened with German, he would answer, \\"He came, so we dined and drank amply of slivovitz and wine, and then we parted.\\"This ritual may be related to a custom recorded among Ukrainians. During a drought, a farmer would gently address the rain, promising that he would cook a pot of borscht for it, if it fell. German, who dies so that the nature may regenerate with the falling of rain, can be understood as a spirit of vegetation, dying and then resurrecting with the revival of vegetation. His distinctly represented male genitals symbolize fertility. The doll of German is presumably a metaphorical replacement of the former human sacrifice. It can be included among the Slavic sacrificial dolls, together with the dolls of Yarilo, Kostroma, and Morena. In Christianized folk beliefs German is identified with Saint Germanus. This saint is associated with the protection from hail, and occasionally from lightning, though the latter was generally ascribed to Saint Elijah. ==See also== * Caloian * Paparuda * Dodola ==NotesReferences== * * Category:Slavic legendary creatures Category:Bulgarian folklore Category:Bulgarian traditions Category:Romanian traditions Category:Serbian folklore Category:Serbian traditions Category:Rain deities Category:Life- death-rebirth gods Category:Fertility gods ","title":"German (mythology)"},{"id":"19261666","text":"The Last Time I Saw Her is the 20th album by American singer/guitarist Glen Campbell, released by Capitol Records in 1971 (see 1971 in music). ==Track listing== Side 1: # \\"The Last Time I Saw Her\\" (Gordon Lightfoot) – 4:06 # \\"Rose Garden\\" (Joe South) – 2:44 # \\"Help Me Make It Through the Night\\" (Kris Kristofferson) – 2:18 # \\"She Understands Me\\" (Jerry Hubbard) – 2:34 # \\"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\\" (Bobby Scott, Bob Russell) – 3:25 Side 2: # \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\" (Gordon Lightfoot) – 3:45 # \\"Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)\\" (Cindy Walker) – 2:37 # \\"Today Is Mine\\" (Jerry Hubbard) – 3:37 # \\"Here We Go Again\\" (Russell Steagall, Don Lanier) – 2:26 # \\"Theme From 'Love Story'\\" (Francis Lai, Carl Sigman) – 3:01 ==Personnel== *Glen Campbell – vocals, acoustic guitar *Larry McNeely – acoustic guitar *Louis Shelton – acoustic guitar *Hal Blaine – drums *Carol Kaye – bass guitar *Bill Graham – bass guitar ==Production== *Producer – Al De Lory *Arranged and conducted by Al De Lory and Marty Paich *Engineer – Chuck Britz *Photography – Rick Rankin *Liner photo – Frank Laffitte ==Charts== Album – Billboard (United States) { border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 width=\\"550px\\"  !align=\\"center\\"Chart !align=\\"center\\"Entry date !align=\\"center\\"Peak position !align=\\"center\\"No. of weeks - align=\\"left\\"Billboard Country Albums align=\\"center\\"July 31, 1971 align=\\"center\\"6 align=\\"center\\"22 - align=\\"left\\"Billboard 200 align=\\"center\\"July 8, 1971 align=\\"center\\"87 align=\\"center\\"9 - } Singles – Billboard (United States) { border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 width=\\"550px\\"  !align=\\"left\\"Year !align=\\"left\\"Single !align=\\"left\\"Hot Country Singles !align=\\"left\\"Hot 100 !align=\\"left\\"Easy Listening - align=\\"center\\"1971 align=\\"left\\" \\"Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)\\" align=\\"center\\"7 align=\\"center\\"31 align=\\"center\\"2 - align=\\"center\\"1971 align=\\"left\\" \\"Last Time I Saw Her\\" align=\\"center\\"21 align=\\"center\\"61 align=\\"center\\"12 } ==References== Category:Glen Campbell albums Category:1971 albums Category:Albums arranged by Marty Paich Category:Capitol Records albums ","title":"The Last Time I Saw Her"},{"id":"19261667","text":"The Dybbuk (, Der Dibuk; ) is a 1937 Yiddish-language Polish fantasy drama directed by Michał Waszyński. It is based on the play The Dybbuk by S. Ansky. The Dybbuk, or Between Two Worlds (; Der Dibuk, oder Tsvishn Tsvey Veltn) is a 1914 play by S. Ansky, relating the story of a young bride possessed by a dybbuk – a malicious possessing spirit, believed to be the dislocated soul of a dead person – on the eve of her wedding. The Dybbuk is considered a seminal play in the history of Jewish theatre, and played an important role in the development of Yiddish theatre and theatre in Israel. The play was based on years of research by Ansky, who traveled between Jewish shtetls in Russia and Ukraine, documenting folk beliefs and stories of the Hassidic Jews. The film, with some changes in the plot structure, starred as Leah, Leon Liebgold as Hannan (Channon, in the English-language subtitles), and as Rabbi Azrael ben Hodos. The film adds an additional act before those in the original play: it shows the close friendship of Sender and Nisn as young men. Besides the language of the film itself, the picture is noted among film historians for the striking scene of Leah's wedding, which is shot in the style of German Expressionism. The film is generally considered one of the finest in the Yiddish language. The Dybbuk was filmed on location in Kazimierz Dolny, Poland, and in Feniks Film Studio in Warsaw. ==Plot== Two best friends, Nisan and Sender, living in a shtetl in the Pale of Settlement, jointly vow that the children their wives are expecting will eventually marry, against the advice of a mysterious and sinister traveller who warns against binding future generations. Sender's wife dies giving birth to their daughter Lea, and Nisan drowns in a storm at the moment his wife gives birth to their son Chanan. Sender becomes a rich but miserly rabbi in the shtetl of Britnitz, and one day Chanan arrives there as a poor yeshiva student. With both men unaware of their connection, Sender offers Chanan hospitality. Lea and Chanan fall in love, but knowing that Sender will not agree to marriage because of his lack of wealth, Chanan obsessively studies the Kabbalah and attempts to practice magic to improve his position. When he hears that Sender has arranged Lea's marriage to a rich man's son, he calls on Satan to help him. He's struck dead, but returns as a dybbuk, a restless spirit, who possesses Lea. The ceremony is postponed, and Sender calls on the assistance of Ezeriel, a wise and powerful rabbi in nearby Miropol (Myropil). Ezeriel exorcises the dybbuk, but Lea offers her soul to Chanan and dies as the mysterious stranger blows out a candle. ==Cast== * as Rabbi Ezeriel ben Hodos * as Meszulach, the messenger * as Sender Brynicer ben Henie * as Lea – Sender's daughter *Leon Liebgold as Chanan ben Nisan *Dina Halpern as Aunt Frade * (billed: Maks Bozyk) as Nute, Sender's friend *M.

Famed pundits and traditional scholars such as Liu Dagui, Wang Liangwu, Quan Zuwang and Yao Nai, all served as the headmaster (equivalent to president nowadays). In 1898, the Guangxu Emperor of the Qing dynasty ordered it be renamed as Qiushi Academy (). In 1902, it was called Anhui Grand Academy. Later, it became Anhui Military Academy, Anhui Army's Academy, and Anhui Judicial and Political College. In 1928, Anhui Provincial University was formed here. In 1946, it became National Anhui University and thus attained its climax in Chinese modern history of higher education. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, due to the drift of the political center, the school witnessed a series of alterations, though the education mission has never been discontinued. It once became a Navy academy, a normal college, and a branch campus of Anhui Normal College. In May 1980, upon the approval of the State Council, it was renamed Anqing Teachers College and changed to Anqing Normal University in 2016. Anqing Normal University established a sister institution partnership with Salisbury University in Maryland, United States. Two Salisbury University undergraduate students were the very first to study abroad, at Anqing Teacher's College, and did so during the entire Fall Semester in 2010.

Named after this river, the castle, also referred to as \\"La Fortaleza\\" or \\"The Fortress\\". It was declared by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, together with the other historical monuments of the Ciudad Colonial. Recognized by the UNESCO for being the oldest military construction of European origin in the Americas. It was built between 1502-1508. ==History== An impressive architectural structure of medieval style and design, the Tower of Homage (Spanish: Torre del Homenaje) stands in the center of the grounds. The castle was designed to guard the entrance to the port of Santo Domingo and defend the city from seaborne enemies. Coral stones extracted from the sea were used for construction. Lauterio Vargas, Historia de la Fortaleza Ozama, Elcaribe.com, 28 September 2013 Black and Taino slaves worked for the construction of the fortress. Nicolás de Ovando, founder of Santo Domingo, personally chose the lot of the construction. The fortress was considered the Axis of the Conquest by the Spaniards once they had explored the whole island.The Fortress of Santo Domingo also known as Fortaleza Ozama, Colonialzone-dr.com The architect of the building was Gómez Garcia de Varela. The construction started with the main tower, then the shooting platforms, then the main defensive fort. It was completed in 1505. During the 16th century, the 18-meter high tower was the highest European-built construction of the Americas. The entrance gate on Calle Damas was originally built in 1608, known as the Prevention Gate. In 1787, the gated entrance was replaced by the actual one, the Carlos III gate. The doors were made in imported African ebony. There are bullets holes in the doors dating from 1965, when US soldiers intervened in the island during the Dominican Civil War.Inside the Fortaleza Ozama, Colonialzone-dr.com Black slaves and pirates were usually jailed in the fortress. During the 1900s, the ex-presidents Jacinto Peynado and Horacio Vásquez did some time in the prison. In 1937, under the leadership of Rafael Trujillo, the outside walls were crenellated. In 1965, the Fortaleza ceased to serve as a prison and became a public building. The Fortaleza was never seized by attacking enemies. ==Description== The length of the city walls in 1785. The Ozama Fortress was its main feature. Model exhibits at the Museo de las Casas Reales in Santo Domingo The Fortaleza is located at the end of Las Damas Street. The statue in front of the building depicts Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés, governor of the fortress from 1533 to 1557, and author of Historia General y Natural de las Indias. The statue was imported from Salamanca, Spain in 1977, and was made by the artist Joaquín Vaquero Turcio The central tower of the building is 18-meter high, with walls 2-meter thick. The fortified walls around the building are 3-meter thick, except on the river-side where the walls are 1-meter thick. The cement holding the stoned walls together is a mixture of gypsum, clay, lime and the blood of animals. ==Gallery== File:SD RD 03 2017 2065.jpgFortress Ozama File:Fortaleza Ozama.jpgHomage Tower in Ozama Fortress File:SD RD 03 2017 2049.jpgTower of Homage File:SD RD 03 2017 2042.jpgTop of the lower tower File:SD RD 03 2017 2060.jpgFortress entrance File:SD RD 03 2017 2043.jpgFortress interior garden File:Fortaleza Ozama RD 07 2017 4568.jpgStatue of Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés File:Fortaleza Ozama from river CCSD 08 2019 0336.jpgView from across the Ozama river ==See also== * Colonial City of Santo Domingo * List of oldest buildings in the Americas ==References== Category:Forts in the Dominican Republic Category:Buildings and structures in Santo Domingo Category:Castles in the Dominican Republic Category:History of the Colony of Santo Domingo Category:Infrastructure completed in 1508 Category:Tourist attractions in Santo Domingo Category:Spanish colonial fortifications in the Dominican Republic Category:1508 establishments in the Spanish Empire Category:Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo) Category:City walls in the Dominican Republic ","title":"Fortaleza Ozama"},{"id":"19261797","text":"Juan de la Jaraquemada, (Canary Islands ? – † Santiago of Chile, April 1612); Spanish soldier, designated by the viceroy of Peru Juan de Mendoza y Luna, Marquess of Montesclaros, Captain General and Governor of Chile, and president of the Real Audiencia of Santiago.

Many molecules fit this formula. An important hexafluoride is hexafluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6), which is a byproduct of the mining of phosphate rock. In the nuclear industry, uranium hexafluoride (UF6) is an important intermediate in the purification of this element. ==Hexafluoride cations== Cationic hexafluorides exist but are rarer than neutral or anionic hexafluorides. Examples are the hexafluorochlorine (ClF6+), and hexafluorobromine (BrF6+) cations. ==Hexafluoride anions== Structure of the hexafluorophosphate anion, PF6−. Many elements form anionic hexafluorides. Members of commercial interest are hexafluorophosphate (PF6−) and hexafluorosilicate (SiF62−). Many transition metals form hexafluoride anions. Often the monoanions are generated by reduction of the neutral hexafluorides. For example, PtF6− arises by reduction of PtF6 by O2. Because of its highly basic nature and its resistance to oxidation, the fluoride ligand stabilizes some metals in otherwise rare high oxidation states, such as hexafluorocuprate(IV), and hexafluoronickelate(IV), . ==Binary hexafluorides== Hexafluoride-forming elements Octahedral structure of SF6 Seventeen elements are known to form binary hexafluorides. Nine of these elements are transition metals, three are actinides, four are chalcogens, and one is a noble gas. Most hexafluorides are molecular compounds with low melting and boiling points. Four hexafluorides (S, Se, Te, and W) are gases at room temperature (25 °C) and a pressure of 1 atm, two are liquids (Re, Mo), and the others are volatile solids. The group 6, chalcogen, and noble gas hexafluorides are colourless, but the other hexafluorides have colours ranging from white, through yellow, orange, red, brown, and grey, to black. The molecular geometry of binary hexafluorides is generally octahedral, although some derivatives are distorted from Oh symmetry. For the main group hexafluorides, distortion is pronounced for the 14-electron noble gas derivatives. Distortions in gaseous XeF6 are caused by its non-bonding lone pair, according to VSEPR theory. In the solid state, it adopts a complex structure involving tetramers and hexamers. According to quantum chemical calculations, ReF6 and RuF6 should have tetragonally distorted structures (where the two bonds along one axis are longer or shorter than the other four), but this has not been verified experimentally. The status of polonium hexafluoride is unclear: some experimental results suggest that it may have been synthesized, but it was not well characterized. The quoted boiling point in the table below is thus a prediction. Despite this situation, some sources describe it without comment as a known compound. ===Binary hexafluorides of the chalcogens=== {  ! Compound !! Formula !! m.p (°C) !! b.p. (°C) !! subl.p. (°C) !!

Sulfur hexafluoride is nearly inert and non-toxic due to steric hindrance (the six fluorine atoms are arranged so tightly around the sulfur atom that it is extremely difficult to attack the bonds between the fluorine and sulfur atoms). It has several applications due to its stability, dielectric properties, and high density. Selenium hexafluoride is nearly as unreactive as SF6, but tellurium hexafluoride is not very stable and can be hydrolyzed by water within 1 day. Also, both selenium hexafluoride and tellurium hexafluoride are toxic, unlike sulfur hexafluoride (which is non-toxic). In contrast, metal hexafluorides are corrosive, readily hydrolyzed, and may react violently with water. Some of them can be used as fluorinating agents. The metal hexafluorides have a high electron affinity, which makes them strong oxidizing agents. Platinum hexafluoride in particular is notable for its ability to oxidize the dioxygen molecule, O2, to form dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate, and for being the first compound that was observed to react with xenon (see xenon hexafluoroplatinate). ===Applications of binary hexafluorides=== Some metal hexafluorides find applications due to their volatility. Uranium hexafluoride is used in the uranium enrichment process to produce fuel for nuclear reactors. Fluoride volatility can also be exploited for nuclear fuel reprocessing. Tungsten hexafluoride is used in the production of semiconductors through the process of chemical vapor deposition.http://www.timedomaincvd.com/CVD_Fundamentals/films/W_WSi.html ===Predicted binary hexafluorides === Radon hexafluoride (), the heavier homologue of xenon hexafluoride, has been studied theoretically, but its synthesis has not yet been confirmed. Higher fluorides of radon may have been observed in experiments where unknown radon-containing products distilled together with xenon hexafluoride, and perhaps in the production of radon trioxide: these may have been RnF4, RnF6, or both. It is likely that the difficulty in identifying higher fluorides of radon stems from radon being kinetically hindered from being oxidised beyond the divalent state. This is due to the strong ionicity of RnF2 and the high positive charge on Rn in RnF+. Spatial separation of RnF2 molecules may be necessary to clearly identify higher fluorides of radon, of which RnF4 is expected to be more stable than RnF6 due to spin–orbit splitting of the 6p shell of radon (RnIV would have a closed-shell 6s6p configuration). Krypton hexafluoride () has been predicted to be stable, but has not been synthesised due to the extreme difficulty of oxidising krypton beyond Kr(II). The synthesis of americium hexafluoride () by the fluorination of americium(IV) fluoride () was attempted in 1990, but was unsuccessful; there have also been possible thermochromatographic identifications of it and curium hexafluoride (CmF6), but it is debated if these are conclusive. Palladium hexafluoride (), the lighter homologue of platinum hexafluoride, has been calculated to be stable, but has not yet been produced; the possibility of silver (AgF6) and gold hexafluorides (AuF6) has also been discussed. Chromium hexafluoride (), the lighter homologue of molybdenum hexafluoride and tungsten hexafluoride, was reported, but has been shown to be a mistaken identification of the known pentafluoride (). == Literature == * == References == Hexafluorides ","title":"Hexafluoride"},{"id":"19261826","text":"Bruno Weil (born 24 November 1949, Hahnstätten) is a symphonic conductor.

The film was officially released in 1989, but drew public attention in 1992 with screenings at a number of Jewish film festivals worldwide, including the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival and the Madrid \\"Festival de Cine Judio\\" which was dubbed \\"the biggest Jewish cultural event held in Spain in 500 years\\". This was followed by a public screening at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York, and airing on The Jewish Channel. The film returned to the screen ten years later at the 2002 Las Vegas Jewish Film Festival. It was featured again in 2011 with a special screening at the 15th Annual Seattle Jewish Film Festival, 22 years after its debut. The film is used as an academic resource in Middle Eastern studies, Jewish studies and World History, at the collegiate and high school levels. ==Summary== Fewer than 25,000 Jews still live in Turkey and, unlike their ancestors, they consider themselves more Turkish than Jewish. Trees Cry for Rain: A Sephardic Journey uses one woman’s childhood memories to reconstruct what life was like for Sephardic Jews in Turkey before modern assimilation took effect. Jews were executed or forced to convert under Christian rule in Spain before being forced out of the country. Many fled to nearby Turkey, where, for centuries, they were able to maintain their traditions, passing them down through the generations. Trees Cry for Rain shares an intimate interview with Rachael Amado Bortnick, a native of Turkey who left as a young adult, complemented by detailed paintings and illustrations of Turkey, to bring the once-rich culture of Turkey’s Sephardic Jewry to life. Their unique foods, songs, and traditions are explored, and the importance of keeping their unique Judeo-Spanish language alive is impressed upon the viewer. Sephardic culture continues to be threatened by assimilation, and the Ladino language is in danger of being lost forever. “My generation was the last to speak the language fluently,” Rachael explains. But, thankfully, the culture’s beautiful music has brought about a renewed interest in the unique tongue. Sephardic singer, Judy Frankel practices her pronunciations with Rachael, while she sings, “Trees cry for rain and the mountains for wind; So my eyes weep for you, my dear sweetheart.” Rachael listens intently and confesses that the song’s refrain reminds her of her own situation. “I turn and I say what will become of me? I will die in a strange land.” ==See also== Other documentaries about Diaspora Jews: *Trip to Jewish Cuba *Reconstruction *Next Year in Argentina *Balancing Acts *Yearning to Belong *Thunder in Guyana ==References * The Jewish Channel's review * Trees Cry for Rain on Bonnie Burt's website * Turkey Virtual Jewish History Tour * Sephardic Singer Judy Frankel's Obituary Category:1989 films Category:American films Category:Documentary films about Jews and Judaism Category:Biographical documentary films Category:1989 documentary films Category:Jewish Turkish history Category:Sephardi Jewish culture in Turkey Category:Judaeo-Spanish Category:English-language films ","title":"Trees Cry for Rain"},{"id":"19261860","text":"Nimiq-4 is a Canadian geosynchronous communications satellite.

Trova was created by itinerant musicians known as trovadores who travelled around Cuba's Oriente province, especially Santiago de Cuba, and earned their living by singing and playing the guitar.Canizares, Dulcila 1995. La trova tradicional. 2nd ed, La Habana. According to nueva trova musician Noel Nicola, Cuban trovadors sang original songs or songs written by contemporaries, accompanied themselves on guitar, and aimed to feature music that had a poetic sensibility.\\"Trata de poetizar con su canto\\" in the original. Nicola, Noel . Por qué nueva trova? El Caimán Barbudo #92, p10-12. This definition fits best the singers of boleros, and less well the Afrocubans singing funky sones (El Guayabero) or even guaguancós and abakuá (Chicho Ibáñez). It rules out, perhaps unfairly, singers who accompanied themselves on the piano.Bola de Nieve was an unusual case: a trained pianist who accompanied his piano with a gravelly voice. He is better classified as a salon entertainer than a trova artist. Casa de la Trova, Santiago de Cuba Trova musicians have played an important part in the evolution of Cuban popular music. Collectively, they have been prolific as composers, and have provided a start for many later musicians whose career lay in larger groupings. Socially, they reached every community in the country, and have helped to spread Cuban music throughout the world.Giro Radamés 2007. Diccionario enciclopédico de la música en Cuba. La Habana. vol 4, p206 et seq. ==The founders== Pepe Sánchez, born José Sánchez (Santiago de Cuba, 19 March 1856 - 3 January 1918), is known as the father of the trova style and the creator of the Cuban bolero.Orovio, Helio 1995. El bolero latino. La Habana. He had some experience in bufo, but had no formal training in music. With remarkable natural talent, he composed numbers in his head and never wrote them down. As a result, most of these numbers are now lost for ever, though some two dozen or so survive because friends and disciples wrote them down. His first bolero, Tristezas, is still remembered today. He also created advertisement jingles before the radio.Sublette, Ned 2004. Cuba and its music: from the first drums to the mambo. Chicago. p253 gives a verse on Cola marca Palma Real He was the model and teacher for the great trovadores who followed him.Orovio, Helio 2004. Cuban music from A to Z. p195. The first, and one of the longest-lived, was Sindo Garay, born Antonio Gumersindo Garay Garcia (Stgo de C. 12 April 1867 - Havana, 17 July 1968). He was the most outstanding composer of trova songs, and his best have been sung and recorded many times. Perla marina, Adios a La Habana, Mujer bayamesa, El huracan y la palma, Guarina and many others are now part of Cuba's heritage. Garay was also musically illiterate - in fact, he only taught himself the alphabet at 16 - but in his case not only were scores recorded by others, but there are recordings as well. In the 1890s Garay got involved in the Cuban War of Independence, and decided a stay in Hispaniola (Haiti and Dominican Republic) would be a good idea. It was, and he came back with a wife. Garay settled in Havana in 1906, and in 1926 joined Rita Montaner and others to visit Paris, spending three months there singing his songs. He broadcast on radio, made recordings and survived into modern times. He used to say \\"Not many men have shaken hands with both Jose Marti and Fidel Castro!\\" Carlos Puebla, whose life spanned the old and the new trova, told a good joke about him: \\"Sindo celebrated his 100th birthday several times – in fact, whenever he was short of money!\\"Sublette, Ned 2004. Cuba and its music: from the first drums to the mambo. Chicago. p298de Leon, Carmela 1990. Sindo Garay: memorias de un trovador. La Habana. Garay's life story as told in his nineties; includes a 16-page appendix listing his compositions. The four greats of the trova from left: Rosendo Ruiz, Manuel Corona Sindo Garay, Alberto Villalón José 'Chicho' Ibáñez (Corral Falso,now Pedro Betancourt 22 November 1875 - Havana, 18 May 1981)date of death from the program of LatinBeat 2003, Film Society of the Lincoln Center, New York. Orovio, Helio 2004. Cuban music from A to Z. Revised by Sue Steward. p112 gives 1987 as the date of death; earlier date here preferred on grounds of probability. was the first trovador (that we know of) to specialize in the son and also on guaguancós and afrocuban rhythms from the abakuá. He played the tres rather than the Spanish guitar, and developed his own technique for this Cuban guitar. During his extremely long career, Chicho sang and played the son in streets, plazas, cafés, nightclubs and other venues throughout Cuba. In the 1920s, when the sextetos became popular, he was forced to sell his compositions to these larger groups and their composers in order to survive. His compositions include Tóma mamá que te manda tía, Evaristo, No te metas Caridad, Ojalá (sones); Yo era dichoso, Al fin mujer (bolero-sones); Qué más me pides, La saya de Oyá (guaguancos). He worked throughout Cuba, and latterly a short film was made of him ('See also' below). The composer Rosendo Ruiz (Sgo de C. 1 March 1885 - Havana, 1 January 1983) was a trovador almost as long-lived as Ibáñez and Garay. He wrote the criolla Mares y Arenas in 1911, the workers' anthem Redencion in 1917, the bolero Confesion, the guajira Junto al canaveral and the pregon-son Se va el dulcerito. He was the author of a well-known guitar manual. Manuel Corona (Calbarién 17 June 1880 - Havana 9 January 1950) started his career in a red light district of Havana. Originally a singer-guitarist, he became a prolific composer after his hand was damaged by a pimp's knife. It was a case of \\"She was a whore, and she had her man, but I loved her\\". Alberto Villalón (Stgo de C. 7 June 1882 - Havana 16 07 1955) advanced the trova guitar technique and had a hand in the birth of the son septetos. Garay, Ruiz, Villalón and Corona were known as the four greats of the trova, but Ibáñez and the following trovadores should be regarded as of equally high stature. == The 20th century == Patricio Ballagas (Camaguey, 17 March 1879 – Havana, 15 February 1920); Eusebio Delfin (Palmira, 1 April 1893 - Havana, 28 April 1965); María Teresa Vera (Guanajay, 6 February 1895 - Havana, 17 December 1965); Lorenzo Hierrezuelo (El Caney, 5 September 1907 - Havana, 16 November 1993); Joseíto Fernández (September 5, 1908 - October 11, 1979); Ñico Saquito (Antonio Fernandez: Sgo. de C. 1901 - Havana, 4 August 1982); Carlos Puebla (Manzanillo, 11 September 1917 - Havana, 12 July 1989) and Compay Segundo (Máximo Francisco Repilado Muñoz: Siboney, 18 November 1907 - Havana, 13 July 2003) were all great trova musicians. And let's not forget the Trio Matamoros, who worked together for most of their lives. Matamoros was one of the greats.Rodrígeuz Domíngues, Ezequiel. El Trio Matamoros: trienta y cinco anos de música popular. La Habana. Most trovadors were creolized, drawing from both Spanish and African traditions and styles even-handedly. There were exceptions. Guillermo Portabales (Cienfuegos 6 April 1911 – San Juan, Puerto Rico 25 October 1970) and Carlos Puebla were mostly in the guajiro tradition, whilst El Guayabero - Faustino Oramas - (Holguín, 4 June 1911 - Holguín, 28 March 2007) was black and funky in style and content. He was the last of the old trova, the oldest working musician in Cuba, at 95, when he died. His double entendres were a joy. Compay Segundo at the Hotel Nacional de Cuba Trova musicians often worked in pairs and trios, some of them exclusively so (Compay Segundo). As the sextetos / septetos / conjuntos grew in popularity many trovadores joined in the larger groups. The technique of guitar-playing gradually improved; the early trovadors, being self-taught, had rather limited techniques. Later, some tapped into classical guitar techniques to revive the accompaniment of the trova. Guyún (Vincente Gonzalez Rubiera, Stgo de C. 27 October 1908-Havana, 1987) studied under Severino Lopez, and developed a modern concept of harmony, and a way to apply classical technique to popular Cuban music. He became more adventurous, yet still in Cuban vein, and in 1938 stopped performing to devote himself to teaching the guitar. This bore fruit, and two generations of Cuban guitarists bear witness to his influence. Perhaps the greatest guitarist amongst modern Cuban trovadors is Eliades Ochoa (b. Songo La Maya, Santiago de Cuba, 22 June 1946), the leader of Cuerteto Patría. Ochoa learnt both Spanish guitar and the Cuban trés; Cuban composer and classical guitarist Leo Brouwer told him that he did not need to learn more about musical technique as he already knew too much! Ochoa plays now with an eight-stringed guitar (a self-designed hybrid of an acoustic six-string and the Cuban trés). Cuerteto Patría includes his brother Humberto Ochoa on guitar, son Eglis Ochoa on maracas, William Calderón on bass, Anibal Avila on claves and trumpet, and Roberto Torres on congas. ==Offshoots of the trova== The trova movement has given rise to offshoots which have grown in the fertile musical earth of Cuba and other Latin-American countries. The following are elements in the trova's great influence: :1. The huge number of lyric compositions which have been used in all areas of Latin- American popular music. :2. Unforgettable musical compositions which became latin standards. :3. The bolero, the musical form most closely associated with the trova, and its relative the canción. :4. The development of guitar technique in popular music. :5. Themes and initiatives related to politico- social events, such as Afrocubanismo, Filín (feeling), and Nueva trova. === Filin === The word is derived from feeling; it was a US-influenced popular musical fashion of the late 40s and the 50s. It describes a style of post- microphone jazz-influenced romantic song (crooning).Diaz Ayala, Cristobal 1981. Música cubana del Areyto a la Nueva Trova. 2nd rev ed, Cubanacan, San Juan P.R. p257 Its Cuban roots were in the bolero and the canción. Some Cuban quartets, such as Cuarteto d'Aida and Los Zafiros, modelled themselves on U.S. close-harmony groups. Others were singers who had heard Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Nat King Cole. Filín singers included César Portillo de la Luz, José Antonio Méndez, who spent a decade in Mexico from 1949 to 1959, Frank Domínguez, the blind pianist Frank Emilio Flynn, and the great singers of boleros Elena Burke and the still-performing Omara Portuondo, who both came from the Cuarteto d'Aida. The filín movement, which originally had a place every afternoon on Radio Mil Diez, survived the first few years of the revolution quite well, but somehow did not suit the new circumstances and gradually withered, leaving its roots in jazz, romantic song and the bolero perfectly healthy. Some of its most prominent singers, such as Pablo Milanés, took up the banner of the nueva trova. ===Nueva trova=== The Cuban Nueva trova dates from the 1967/68, after the Cuban Revolution of 1959, and the consequent political and social changes. It differed from the traditional trova, not because the musicians were younger, but because the content was, in the widest sense, political. Nueva trova is defined, not only by its connection with Castro's revolution, but also by its lyrics. The lyrics attempt to escape the banalities of life (e.g. love) by concentrating on socialism, injustice, sexism, colonialism, racism and similar 'serious' issues.Orovio, Helio 2004. Cuban music from A to Z. p151 Silvio Rodríguez and Pablo Milanés became the most important exponents of this style. Carlos Puebla and Joseíto Fernández were long-time trova singers who added their weight to the new regime, but of the two only Puebla wrote special pro-revolution songs.La Reforma Agraria (Agricultural reform), Duro con él (I survive with him), Ya ganamos la pelea (At last we won the fight) and Son de la alfabetización were some of Puebla's compositions at this time. The regime gave plenty of support to musicians willing to write and sing anti-U.S. or pro-revolution songs; this was quite a bonus in an era when many of the traditional musicians were finding it difficult or impossible to earn a living. In 1967 the Casa de las Américas in Havana held a Festival de la canción de protesta (protest songs). Much of the effort was spent applauding causes that would annoy the U.S. government. Tania Castellanos, a filín singer and author, wrote ¡Por Angela! in support of Angela Davis. César Portillo de la Luz wrote Oh, valeroso Viet Nam.Linares, María Teresa 1981. La música y el pueblo. La Habana, Cuba. p182 These were hot topics of the 1970s, but their topicality declined as time passed. Nueva Trova, initially so popular, was dealt a blow by the fall of the Soviet Union, though it was already fading. It suffered inside Cuba, perhaps from a growing disenchantment with one-party rule, and externally, from the vivid contrast with the Buena Vista Social Club film and recordings. Audiences round the world have had their eyes opened to the extraordinary charm and musical quality of the older forms of Cuban music. By contrast, topical themes that seemed so relevant in the 1960s and 70s now seem dry and passé; once a theme is no longer topical, the piece rests solely on its musical quality. Those pieces of high musical and lyrical quality, amongst which Puebla's Hasta siempre stands out, will probably last as long as Cuba lasts.Giro Radamés 2007. Diccionario enciclopédico de la música en Cuba. La Habana. vol 4, p211Cristóbal Díaz selected two nueva trova numbers for his list of 50 canciones cubanas en el repertorio popular internacional: Unicornio azul (Silvio Rodríguez) and Yolanda (Pablo Milanés): Díaz Ayala, Cristóbal 1998.

Because of the limited sonority of the guitar, trova musicians preferred small groups, or solo performances. Boleros tend to benefit from two voices, primo and segundo, giving to melodic phrases a richness in contrast with the basic rhythm of the cinquillo.Loyola Fernández, Jose 1997.

In the city of Lwów (PL) in 1939 Adam and Irena fall in Love, but are separated by the outbreak of the war. Both are deported by the Soviets to Siberia, where they briefly meet again when signing up to the newly created Polish army. Again separated from Irena, Adam marches with the army from Siberia through the Middle East and fights on the Italian front line. During the battle of Monte Cassino he gets wounded when participating in the first assault, temporarily losing his eyesight. In the military hospital a nurse finds his diary and, initially in the intent to relieve his suffering, later from romantic affection towards him, pretends to be his fiancée Irena. This, however, is ended when the real Irena arrives. Adam recovers from his wounds and, after the Polish victory at Monte Cassino, follows the army together with Irena to northern Italy, where they settle after the end of the war. In this film the plot serves as a framework for original footage taken by the army during the war. The name of the film, Wielka Droga, means 'The Great Way', referring to the march from Poland through Siberia and the Middle East to Northern Italy. This is the only film showing the Polish participation in the Italian Campaign (World War II). ==Cast== *Albin Ossowski ... Adam *Renata Bogdanska ... Irena *Jadwiga Andrzejewska ...

The convent is north of the town of Kirillov, Kirillovsky District, which was the site of one of the historically most important (as well as wealthiest) male monasteries in Russia, and to which Tsar Ivan the Terrible, discussed below, had planned to retire.Goritsky Monastery , Goritsky Monastery Since the 1970s, the Kirillo-Belozerksy museum-zapovednik of History, Art, and Architecture has operated parts of the Goritsky complex. Parts of Goritsky convent were reopened for religious purposes two decades later, and as of 2011 Goritsky was one of the four acting monasteries in Vologda Oblast, and the only one for religious women. ==History== The monastery in July 1909, photo taken by Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky The Gediminid Knyaginya (duchess) Euphrosinia of Staritsa founded the Goritsky convent in 1544, about a decade after her marriage to one of Tsar Ivan the Great's sons (who died imprisoned after a succession rebellion in his name), and two years after the marriage of her only son, Vladimir of Staritsa. In 1563, as the Livonian war with Lithuania, Poland and Sweden led to the Oprichnina, the aristocratic widow was forced to become a nun and kept under house arrest at Goritsky, together with her daughter-in-law, Yevdokiya Staritskaya. Nonetheless, in 1569, Tsar Ivan the Terrible gave orders to drown the two nuns in the nearby Sheksna River. The policy of removing political opponents to religious foundations, common throughout Europe for decades, continued to use the Goritsky convent. In 1586 Anna Koltovskaya, Ivan the Terrible's fourth wife, might also have taken monastic vows and changed her name to Daria at Goritsky, before being transferred to the Vvedensky convent in Tikhvin. Xenia Godunova, the daughter of Tsar Boris Godunov, became the nun Olga at Goritsky circa 1606, before being transferred to the Knyaginin Convent in Vladimir and later burial with her royal family at the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius. The convent's most recent famous resident may have been Fool for Christ Asenatha of Goritsky, who died in 1892 (and whom Russian Orthodox faithful continue to remember on April 19). In the 1920s, the Bolsheviks transformed the convent into an agricultural cooperative where the nuns worked and prayed. In the 1930s it was shut down, and most of the nuns executed. In the 1950s it housed disabled veterans. In the 1970s it became part of Kirillo- Belozersky museum-zapovednik of History, Art, and Architecture (based on the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery). Since the 1990s a small community of nuns started to live in the convent. ==References== Category:Russian Orthodox monasteries in Russia Category:Religious organizations established in the 1540s Category:Buildings and structures in Vologda Oblast Category:Christian monasteries established in the 16th century ","title":"Goritsky Monastery (Goritsy)"},{"id":"19262043","text":"Unknown Man of San Marino () is a 1946 Italian drama film directed by Polish director Michał Waszyński. ==Cast== *Anna Magnani ...

Regional diplomacy (RD) has become a strong force in international relations. Globalization and interdependence have made all states aware, that neighborhood cooperation works to mutual benefit. Small countries see the benefit of numbers, for economic and political advantage. Many regions attempt to emulate successful exemplars, such as the EU, and ASEAN, with varying degrees of success. == Overview == Regional diplomacy is a specific form of multilateral diplomacy that is practiced within a closed circle of neighboring states. The term 'region' used in international affairs is a geography-based political construct in that a priory reason exists to determine the contours of a region, and the way a region is defined depends on those that run a particular regional organization. Regional diplomacy is of special interest today because in many parts of the world, regional organizations are on the rise, driven by an urge to pursue stronger economic links, and to use this to improve mutual political understanding, and gain in mutual security. The European Union (EU), now consisting of 28 member states, is the world's most advanced practitioner of regional diplomacy, and a role model in most parts of the world. == See also == *Cultural diplomacy *Diplomacy *Economic diplomacy *Public diplomacy Category:Types of diplomacy ","title":"Regional diplomacy"},{"id":"19262160","text":"Goritsky Monastery The Goritsky Monastery of Dormition () was a Russian Orthodox monastery in Pereslavl-Zalessky, Russia.

The film blends documentary and narrative elements to tell the atypical story of how Hanna Mandelberger escaped the Warsaw Ghetto. ==Summary== Hanuszka uses symbolism as it explores a Jewish girl’s war-time experience that drove her to embrace the Catholic Church. The film shows how Hanna struggles have stayed with her by blending contemporary footage of the grown, real-life Hanna as she travels through Warsaw with a reenacted narrative account of her childhood. Telling the story from two angles, Hanuszka is able to depict both the fear and innocence of a child’s experience and the insights that come with age and reflection. Before the Germans occupied Poland, Hanna lived a peaceful life with her sister and parents, practicing piano and playing on the train tracks by her house. But after the occupation, they were relocated to the Warsaw ghetto where, Hanna says, there was “nothing, nothing, but dirt, tiles, and bodies, and screaming.” It’s not long before Hanna realizes that the only things separating her from a life among “trees” and “flowers” and “people with brushed hair” are six bricks of the ghetto wall and her Jewish identity. The kindness of the nuns and priests who take care of Hanna and a child’s normal wish for approval help to draw Hanna into the Catholic faith. Plus, her isolating situation causes her to relate to Jesus and the story of the cross. “I wore the cross,” she says of the Christian symbol of suffering, “it was with me; it was mine.” Dealing with a topic that’s been controversial for some time, Hanuszka enters the heated debate over what Pope John Paul II did during World War II. Born Karol Wojtyla, he has been both attacked and praised for his actions during the war. Some have accused him of ignoring the Holocaust by escaping into life in the seminary while others argue that he defied the Nazis by smuggling false papers to Jews, helping to put on pro-Jewish plays, and defending those he could. Hanna, for one, is convinced that he was a part of the Polish resistance, and the secret package she was told to deliver to him, in her mind, serves as proof. ==Reception== Regional Jewish organizations in the United States regularly host screening of the film. For example, Jewish Federation of Cincinnati chose Hanuszka for the special screening at the Xavier University commemorating 60 years of Israeli independence. Vancouver Jewish Film Festival hosted screenings of the film in 2008. ==See also== Other Documentaries about Children Holocaust survivors: *The Boys of Buchenwald *Marion's Triumph *A Story about a Bad Dream *Pola's March ==References *The Jewish Channel's review * Category:Israeli documentary films Category:Israeli films Category:2006 films Category:Documentary films about the Holocaust Category:2000s documentary films ","title":"Hanuszka"},{"id":"19262224","text":"Associazione Sportiva Dilettantistica Casoli Calcio is an Italian association football club located in Casoli, Abruzzo.

Born in the city of Vysoké Mýto (then Hohenmauth in Austria-Hungary, now part of Ústí nad Orlicí District, Pardubice Region of the Czech Republic) on 15 May 1859, he finished high school in Pardubice before graduating from the Charles University and the Technical University in Prague. In 1881, he moved to what was then Eastern Rumelia (since 1885 united with the Principality of Bulgaria) to work as a high-school teacher in the Bulgarian cities of Plovdiv (1882-1886), Sliven (1886-1888), Varna (1888-1890, 1894-1915) and Veliko Tarnovo (1890-1894). Since 1894, Karel settled permanently in the port city of Varna on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, where he founded the Varna Archeological Society in 1901 and the Varna Archaeological Museum in 1906, of which he was the director from 1915 to his death. He was also a teacher and lecturer at the Naval Academy and the trade school. As a young teacher, Karel Škorpil came to be interested in archeology. In a career spanning more than 50 years, he published around 150 works, whether as the sole author or in collaboration with his brother, including 30 in German, Russian and Czech, primarily devoted to Bulgaria. He discovered and headed the excavations of the medieval Bulgarian castles at Pliska, Preslav and Madara; he also unearthed the prehistoric stilt houses in Lake Varna, among others. A member of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and the Bulgarian Archeological Institute, he died in Varna on 9 March 1944 and was buried among the ruins of the old Bulgarian capital Pliska. All research by the Škorpil brothers was self-funded, and all unearthed monuments have been preserved in Bulgaria. The street in Varna where their house is located, and the Black Sea village and seaside resort Shkorpilovtsi, were named after the brothers.

The refinery occupies a prominent position on the south bank of the Milford Haven Waterway and can be seen for many miles. Around a quarter of the site is within the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park which was created in 1952. ==History== The refinery came on stream in 1964. It was initially owned by the Regent Oil Company, a large domestic marketer of Trinidad-produced oils.Report by the Monopolies Commission on the Supply of Petrol to Retailers in the United Kingdom, 1965 Regent was fully acquired by Texaco in 1956 (although the brand name was only phased out in the UK in favour of Texaco in the late 1960s). When it first came on-stream most of the crude oil for the refinery came from the Middle East with some from Libya, Venezuela and Trinidad. Products were shipped to all parts of Britain 96 per cent going by ship as there was no rail link to the national rail network. Pembroke refinery also supplied fuel oil to the nearby oil-fired 2,000 MW Pembroke power station (commissioned in 1968). Chevron acquired Texaco in 2000. Valero Energy Corporation bought the refinery from Chevron in 2011. In August 1992, Texaco offered to purchase the entire village of Rhoscrowther which lies immediately adjacent to the refinery. Many of the residents accepted the offer - especially after a large explosion which occurred two years later - which included their properties being purchased at market price plus reasonable expenses. Once the properties were acquired by the refinery, they were demolished. Today, only five houses, a 14th-century church and a farm are all that remain of Rhoscrowther.

Shortly before the explosion, a dry lightning storm in the area had caused disturbances at the plant. The resulting fire took several hours to extinguish with fire appliances being drafted in from as far away as Swansea and Cardiff. In all, over 130 firefighters assisted. * Just after 20:00 on 15 February 1996, a crude oil tanker, the Sea Empress, en route to the refinery from the North Sea struck rocks off St. Ann's Head just four miles from the refinery's jetty on the Milford Haven Waterway. The tanker remained stuck on the rocks for four days and spilled 73,000 tonnes of oil - resulting in one of Britain's worst ever environmental disasters. * In September 2000, during nationwide fuel protests, the gates to the refinery were blockaded by hauliers protesting at increasing petrol prices (then 80 pence per litre). Shortly after the protests, the refinery placed wooden stakes in the verges around the gates and perimeter fence to prevent vehicles parking there. * At 20:55 on 24 March 2005, a fire broke out at a crude oil storage tank during a lightning storm. The blaze was fought by fifty firefighters and took just under an hour to extinguish. No injuries were reported. * At 18:20 on 2 June 2011, a 730 cubic metre storage tank exploded killing four refinery workers and seriously injuring a fifth. Ten fire and rescue appliances attended the scene, along with many other emergency services. The fire was extinguished within 90 minutes. ==See also== *Milford Haven Refinery *Gulf refinery, Milford Haven *Esso refinery, Milford Haven *Oil refineries in the United Kingdom *List of oil refineries ==References *Pembroke refinery, Valero website *UKPIA information Category:Oil refineries in the United Kingdom Category:Industrial fires and explosions in the United Kingdom Category:Explosions in Wales ","title":"Pembroke Refinery"},{"id":"19262334","text":"Andrew Gunn is a British television director. He was born in Staffordshire and later grew up on Tyneside before attending film school in Surrey and Dorset. He has written and directed several award-winning short films in addition to work in popular television drama. His graduation film Mermaids starred a young Robson Green and won the Young Film-maker award at the Tyneside International Film Festival 1987. Gunn returned to the North East after film school and continued to write and direct short films, most of which were produced and set in Newcastle upon Tyne. Cafe au Lait won a regional Royal Television Society commendation in 1994. Half a Shave, a black comedy based on the short story by Sid Chaplin, starred Frances Tomelty and premiered at the Edinburgh Film Festival in 1996, going on to win a Certificate of Merit at the Chicago International Film Festival. It also won a regional Royal Television Society commendation. Andrew worked as a highly respected focus puller for many years while trying to achieve his ambition of Directing. Gunn’s next film Insomnia starred Andy Serkis and premiered at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was subsequently screened worldwide. Trigger Happy starred Ian Hart and Christine Tremarco and marked Gunn’s departure from making short films. Following the success of these films Gunn went on to collaborate with Smack the Pony producer Victoria Pile on the pilot episode of the cult drama sit-com Green Wing. Channel 4 subsequently commissioned two series, the first of which received the Pioneer Audience Award at the BAFTA Television Awards 2005. Although uncredited, Gunn directed numerous scenes in the first episode (Caroline’s First Day) and co-created the visual and editorial style of the show. In 2006 Gunn directed two of the most well received episodes in Season 2 of the cult drama-comedy Life On Mars starring John Simm and Philip Glenister and went on to direct David Morrissey and Lucy Cohu in the climax to Cape Wrath (Meadowlands US), the 2007 flagship high-concept thriller for Channel 4 and Showtime. Gunn also directed the feature-length adaptation of David Almond’s Clay for BBC 1, starring Oscar nominee and BAFTA award-winner Imelda Staunton. In 2008 Gunn continued to direct high-concept-high-profile productions, most recently two of the opening episodes of Survivors, the BBC’s eagerly anticipated re-make of the 1970s cult science fiction drama starring Julie Graham and Max Beesley. ==Filmography== *Green Wing (2004) *Cape Wrath (2007) *Life on Mars (2007) *Survivors (2008) *Clay (2008) *Primeval (2008) *Doctor Who (2010) *Wolfblood (2012) - five episodes ==External links== * *Life on Mars episode five at Digital Spy *Life on Mars episode six at Digital Spy *Cape Wrath at Channel4.com *Meadowlands at Showtime *Trigger Happy at the BBC Film Network Category:British television directors Category:British film directors Category:English television directors Category:English film directors Category:People from Staffordshire Category:Living people Category:People from Tyne and Wear Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Andrew Gunn (director)"},{"id":"19262353","text":"Associazione Sportiva Dilettantistica Elpidiense Cascinare is an Italian association football club located in Sant'Elpidio a Mare, Marche.

As the primary minister to this group, he led them in constructing a series of remarkable buildings, the best known of which is the Sharon Temple, now a National Historic Site of Canada. A prolific writer, sympathizer and leader of the movement for political reform in Upper Canada, Willson and his followers ensured the election of William Lyon Mackenzie, and both \\"fathers of Responsible Government\\", Robert Baldwin and Louis LaFontaine, in their riding. ==Biography== Sharon Temple National Historic Site === Early life === Born on his parents' rented farm on the Nine Partners' Grant in Dutchess County, New York, Willson was the son of Irish immigrant John Willson (died circa 1794) and his second wife Catherine (1754-1840). David Willson would later describe his parents as having been 'poor but pious Presbyterians'. Following his father's death David Willson lived for a time in New York City and sailed on the Farmer, a sloop in which his family had invested. He married to Phebe Titus (1777-1866), a member of the Society of Friends, for which she was initially disowned. In 1801, age 23, David Willson and other members of his family, including his widowed mother, younger brother, John (b.1781), and sisters Anne (1786-1824) and Mary (c.1792-1858), followed the example of his elder half brother, Hugh (1768-1828), and emigrated to Upper Canada. They settled in East Gwillimbury Township in York County. Willson joined the Yonge Street Meeting of the Society of Friends (in what is now Newmarket) in 1805, and \\"served them according to their laws and discipline for seven years in all good faith and practice of the society, [yet] still retaining [his] secret impressions as sacred from the ears of all flesh.\\" Quakers adhered to a strict \\"Discipline\\" on their behaviour, but had no fixed creed. Ministry was spontaneous, as called by the \\"inner light\\" of God who made \\"secret impressions\\" on the believers mind. During this period, Willson did not minister, but served as an active overseer and record keeper, as well as donating the land for a meeting house (church) on his farm. Willson underwent a spiritual transformation in 1812 that led to he and several of his sympathizers being expelled from the Society of Friends. Willson was particularly concerned to take up the Society's peace testimony \\"from where George Fox (the founder of Quakerism) left it, and raise it so high, that all the Kingdoms of the Earth should see it.\\" He established 'The Children of Peace,' which espoused ideas and doctrines at odds with orthodox Quaker beliefs; in particular, he was accused of denying the divinity of Christ. ===Minister to the Children of Peace=== The sect was centred upon the Willson farm and Willson increasingly became the main spiritual and community leader. Involvement in Reform politics brought Willson and his community into direct conflict with the political establishment of the province, in particular Bishop John Strachan of Toronto. Much of Willson’s belief and behaviour cannot be understood except in reaction to the government-supported \\"hireling clergy\\" of the colonial Church of England. Willson’s refusal to accept a salary as a minister stood out against the Anglican control of the funds from the Clergy Reserves, the special grant of one seventh of all land in the province rented out for the support of the \\"official\\" Church. He dressed in rags in imitation of Christ, and in contrast to the expected demeanour of an ordained minister of God’s word. His pride in his lack of formal schooling — \\"my education was bounded by one year, and a considerable part of that time almost in my infancy\\" — was in sharp contrast to the university education of the Anglican clergy. Willson was a homespun preacher: a man of the people and defender of their interests against the tightly knit establishment of merchants, official clergy and government. This \\"Family Compact\\" in turn accused him of losing \\"sight of affairs of a spiritual nature and expiating upon those of a worldly sort.\\" An extension of his concern for the poor was his efforts to build a cooperative economy in the village of Hope that he had founded. Many of the new settlers in the province, immigrants from the south infused with republican idealism, found in Willson a palatable, if somewhat eccentric, alternative to the aristocratic pretensions of the British Colonial administration and the closely associated Church of England. During the 1830s, he was described as of \\"middle stature, about sixty years of age, a healthy looking man; he squints much, and has a flat heavy appearance. He, in common with the whole of the sect, wears a homespun blueish mixture: his walk is peculiar, - he appears to move as if he were pulling his legs after him; his speech has a strong nasal twang.\\" === Reform politician === Party organizer Although captivated by visions of equality, the Children of Peace lived in an autocratic colony. They inspired other settlers to fight for democracy within a loose-knit \\"Reform Movement\\" of disenchanted farmers and tradesmen. David Willson had long been an active political figure ensuring the election of William Lyon Mackenzie in their Riding. Mackenzie travelled to England to petition his unjust expulsion from the Legislative Assembly in 1832. He returned in the last week of August, 1833, to find his appeals to the British Parliament had been ultimately ineffective. At an emergency meeting of Reformers, David Willson proposed extending the nomination process for members of the House of Assembly they had begun in Hope to all four Ridings of York, and to establish a \\"General Convention of Delegates\\" from each riding in which to establish a common political platform. This convention could then become the core of a \\"permanent convention\\" or political party - an innovation not yet seen in Upper Canada. The organization of this convention was a model for the \\"Constitutional Convention\\" Mackenzie organized for the Rebellion of 1837, where many of the same delegates were to attend. The Convention was held on 27 February 1834 with delegates from all four of the York ridings. The week before, Mackenzie published Willson's call for a \\"standing convention\\" (political party). The day of the convention, the Children of Peace led a \\"Grand Procession\\" with their choir and band (the first civilian band in the province) to the Old Court House where the convention was held. David Willson was the main speaker before the convention and \\"he addressed the meeting with great force and effect\\".Colonial Advocate, 27 February 1834 The convention nominated 4 Reform candidates, all of whom were ultimately successful in the election. The convention stopped short, however, of establishing a political party. Instead, they formed yet another Political Union, the Canadian Alliance Society. It was a petitioning organization. The first of the petition movements initiated by the Canadian Alliance Society was a call to form a \\"Provincial Loan Office.\\" This was a source of loans for pioneer farmers hard pressed to meet expenses in bad years; its inspiration lay with the credit union formed by the Children of Peace in 1832. As several members of Willson's sect, including two of his sons, participated in the armed rebellion in 1837, there was some discussion of destroying the community's meeting houses and its iconic Sharon Temple. Willson remained a key political leader in the Fourth Riding of York, a Riding that was to rise to national importance for electing both \\"fathers of Responsible Government\\", Robert Baldwin and Louis LaFontaine. These men led the fight for independence from colonial rule and an independent legislature.  Struggle for responsible government  Louis-Hypolite LaFontaine, Father of Responsible Government Robert Badwin, Father of Responsible Government Willson managed Baldwin's election in 4th York and he 'walked over the course without a contest,' thus becoming the first member to be elected to the United Parliament of the Province of Canada. He was also later returned in Hastings. Although Baldwin was elected in two seats in Canada West, reformers were in the minority. In Canada East, gerrymandering and Orange Order violence were used to prevent the election of Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine, leader of the French reformers in Terrebonne, outside Montreal. In order to ensure LaFontaine a seat, Baldwin proposed to Willson that they nominate LaFontaine for the seat in 4th York. On 3 September 1841, Willson and the Children of Peace held a campaign rally for Baldwin and LaFontaine in their Temple, where they rejoiced \\"to say that we have it in our power to show our impartial respect to the Canadian people of the Lower Province.\\" Despite threats of Orange Order violence, LaFontaine was elected as representative of 4th York. However, before LaFontaine could take up his seat, Governor Sydenham died. His replacement, Sir Charles Bagot, was not able to form a mixed cabinet of Reformers and Tories, and so he was forced to include the \\"French party\\" under LaFontaine. LaFontaine refused to join the Executive Council unless Baldwin was also included. Bagot was finally forced to accede in September 1842, and when he became severely ill thereafter, Baldwin and Lafontaine became the first real premiers of the Province of Canada. In order to take office as ministers, the two had to run for re-election. While LaFontaine was easily re-elected in 4th York, Baldwin lost his seat in Hastings as a result of Orange Order violence. It was now that the pact between the two men was completely solidified, as LaFontaine arranged for Baldwin to run in Rimouski, Canada East. This was the union of the Canadas they sought, where LaFontaine overcame linguistic prejudice to gain a seat in English Canada, and Baldwin obtained his seat in French Canada. They resigned in November 1843, beginning a constitutional crisis that would last a year. This year-long crisis, in which the legislature was prorogued, \\"was the final signpost on Upper Canada’s conceptual road to democracy. Lacking the scale of the American Revolution, it nonetheless forced a comparable articulation and rethinking of the basics of political dialogue in the province.\\" The Second Meeting House, Sharon, where the Reform Association met June, 1844. Baldwin and LaFontaine's administration was forced to resign in 1843. Baldwin now established a \\"Reform Association\\" in February, 1844, to unite the Reform movement in Canada West to explain their understanding of responsible government before the expected election. Twenty-two branches were established. A grand meeting of all branches of the Reform Association was held in the Second Meeting House of the Children of Peace in Sharon. It was ultimately to serve as the springboard for Baldwin’s successful candidacy in 4th York. Baldwin had been at a loss about where to run after his loss in Hastings. Orange mobs continued to rule out any chance in Hastings, or in 2nd York, where he had lost to Orange leader George Duggan. LaFontaine, in yet another act of friendship, gave up his seat representing 4th York, thus allowing the desperate Baldwin to run there. David Willson, having arranged for the Reform Association rally during the illumination ceremony, now became Baldwin’s campaign manager. It was reported that over three thousand people attended this June rally for Baldwin. Having weathered these storms the sect continued although changing demographics, the establishment of other religious denominations and other factors led to the sect's gradual decline. Following Willson's death in 1866 the sect continued until ceasing to function by the end of the 1880s. == Theologian and hymnodist == As an offshoot of the Society of Friends, the Children of Peace shared most Quaker belief, especially in the innate presence of God (the \\"inner light\\") in every person. Like the Quakers, they practiced a spontaneous ministry, and eschewed a \\"hireling clergy.\\" David Willson was thus never their paid minister, and he never, in fact, entered the Temple during the monthly alms ceremony there. Like the Quakers, they also rejected any written creed or tests of faith: \\"We have no written creed, and therefore we have no image to quarrel about, or literal rule to argue for, we are against nobody, but for all.\\" Willson, however, did receive \\"impressions on the mind\\", visions calling him to \\"ornament the Christian Church with the glory of Israel.\\" He interpreted this as a call to rebuild Solomon's Temple as the new Jerusalem. During the 1830s, his preaching became more millenarian, prophesying the coming of a Messiah who would overthrow the British empire and establish God's kingdom on earth. He viewed his small group as the new Israelites lost in the wilderness of Upper Canada, who the new Messiah would come to lead. These views are most clearly expressed in two works published in 1835, Impressions of the Mind and Letters to the Jews. After the Rebellion of 1837, Willson's theological work became more quietist, focusing on the experience of God in the individual believer's mind. This emphasis is found in Mysteries of the Mind (1858). Willson had been writing hymn stanzas since the inception of his ministry in 1812. These were recorded in manuscript \\"Books of Sacred Record\\". After the Children of Peace shifted musical styles to congregational singing, Willson produced a series of hymnals for the group. == Bibliography of works == *\\"The rights of Christ according to the principles and doctrines of the Children of Peace\\" (Philadelphia: n.p. 1815). *\\"A Lesson of Instruction, written and published for the Children of Peace\\" (Reading, PA: George Getz, 1816). *\\"A Testimony to the People Called Quakers\\" (n.p., 1816) *\\"An Address to the Professors of Religion\\" (New York: George Largin, 1817). *\\"A Present to the Teachers and Rulers of Society\\" (Philadelphia: n.p., 1821) *\\"The impressions of the mind: to which are added some remarks on church and state discipline, and the acting principles of life\\" (Toronto: J.H.

The campaign has two aspects, first as a national awareness campaign to recognize the efforts of professionals in the payroll industry. It is also an educational campaign designed to help workers learn more about their paychecks, the payroll withholding system, and payroll-related benefits. The campaign is also known for its highly visible “Getting Paid In America” online survey. The survey is available yearly from early May through the end of National Payroll Week, and one participant is chosen to win a grand prize of a free paycheck and trip to Las Vegas. The survey is meant to help the APA evaluate current payroll methods and also to identify trends within the payroll industry. Results from the survey have been quoted in numerous locations including USA Today and the New York Times. == Awareness == The NPW slogan, AMERICA WORKS BECAUSE WE’RE WORKING FOR AMERICA illustrates the importance of the payroll withholding system to the American way of life. The week celebrates the unique partnership among America's workers, companies, the payroll professionals who pay us, and critical government programs their contributions support such as social security, Medicare, fair labor standards, and child support. Through the payroll withholding system, payroll professionals contribute, collect, report and deposit approximately $1.7 trillion, or 64.2%, of the annual revenue of the U.S. Treasury. To build awareness of the important role payroll professionals play in America’s economy, the American Payroll Association employs a number of methods including extensive media and advertising campaigns. Media pushes have resulted in highly visible placements for the campaign, including stories in the Associated Press, on the CBS Early Show, and many other outlets. The annual advertising campaign promotes NPW in leading publications, websites and TV stations before and during National Payroll Week. ==Government recognition== In 2007, Shirley Fanning-Lasseter, mayor of Duluth, Georgia, proclaimed September 3 to 7 as “National Payroll Week” in the City of Duluth. In 2003, Elvy Robichaud, then the Health and Wellness Minister and Minister Responsible for the Office of Human Resources for the province of New Brunswick, Canada, issued a press release to announce \\"his support and recognition\\" of National Payroll Week. ==Media recognition== In 1999, the Dayton Daily News published an article on National Payroll Week. In 2007, Jet published an article. == Educational campaign == APA’s 152 chapters and its members head out into their local communities to teach workers and teens all about their paychecks and payroll-related benefits during National Payroll Week. The educational efforts focus on helping employees better manage their paychecks to put more money in their pockets each payday. Money Matters National Education Day is a national volunteer effort by APA members to teach teens new to the workforce or about to enter the workforce all about their paychecks. == See also == American Payroll Association The Chartered Institute of Payroll Professionals NPW16 ==References== * == External links == *National Payroll Week (United States) website *National Payroll Week (United Kingdom) website *National Payroll Week (Canada) website Category:Awareness weeks in the United States Category:Observances in the United Kingdom Category:Observances in Canada Category:Payroll Category:September observances ","title":"National Payroll Week"},{"id":"19262391","text":"John Altman may refer to: *John Altman (actor) (born 1952), English actor and singer *John Altman (composer) (born 1949), English film composer, music arranger, orchestrator and conductor *John Altman (author) (born 1969), American thriller writer ","title":"John Altman"},{"id":"19262396","text":"David 'Davie' Rae is a former Scottish chair of Queen of the South in Dumfries. Rae was the third of three chairmen to rebuild and revitalise the Dumfries club from the mid-1990s, replacing the previous regime under Harkness, when the club had gone into stagnation and decline from the late 1960s. ==Queens pre Rae== A retired farmer, Davie Rae became chairman of Queen of the South when Ronnie Bradford stepped down due to ill health in June 2003. Bradford's predecessor, Norman Blount had taken over Queen of the South in April 1994. Under the previous regime Queens had been in stagnation and decline since the late 1960s. Blount immediately set about modernising and rebuilding the club. Very quickly new ideas came along that showed that the club was in a new era:- * The new stand was built within 1 year of Blount becoming chairman\\"Club History\\" on the official Queen of the South website * The club became the first senior club in the UK to establish a club museum * Queen of the South became the first club in the world to deploy astro turf on the outside of the touch line on a grass pitch (for linesmen to run along). Initially the Scottish Football Association agreed to this as a 12-month experiment. However, such was the success of the astro turf that the SFA brought the experiment to an early close and sanctioned use of this idea for any other club interested * The first senior club in the UK to use a lottery scheme to decide the annual shirt sponsor. Such was the success of the idea that the club became inundated with calls from other clubs enquiring on the best way to set such a scheme up The highlight on the pitch of the Blount regime was Queens making it to the final of the Scottish Challenge Cup for the first time. This was in 1997 where a battling Queens side lost out by 1–0 to Falkirk. Man of the match was Queens' Tommy Bryce.Tommy Bryce profile on \\"Queens Legends\\" on the official Queen of the South FC website However, in November 1999 Blount candidly announced that he felt that he had taken the club as far as he could and resigned from being chairman. Two time divisional player of the year Andy Thomson was transferred for a Queens record fee of £250,000 in 1994. As Thomson was to say on his return over a decade later, \\"Things have changed quite a bit while I've been away – a new stand, a completely new set-up and a more modern type of training system\\". Thomson added, \\"Norman Blount was an excellent chairman.\\"Andy Thomson profile on \\"Queens Legends\\" on the official Queen of the South FC website The chairmanship was taken over by Ronnie Bradford who continued the progressive ambition started under Blount. It was under Bradford that the seeds at 'New Queens' further came to fruition, namely:- * Winning the 2001–02 Scottish Second Division to return to the top half of Scottish football * Winning the 2002–03 Scottish Challenge Cup Ronnie Bradford left due to ill health in June 2003. The chairmanship was taken over by Davie Rae. ==The Rae regime== Queens progressed to the 2006–07 Scottish Cup quarter final before losing 2–1 to Hibernian. At the end of that season Davie Rae announced that Queens were to go full-time for the 2007–08 season. This was to produce remarkable success. Queens surpassed the 2006–07 Scottish Cup run by progressing beyond the quarter finals and then eliminating Aberdeen in the 2007–08 semi-final. In the club's first ever Scottish Cup cup final Queens went down 3–2 to Rangers but still qualified for the 2nd qualification round of the UEFA Cup. After an injury plagued start to the season Queens recovered to finish fourth in the second tier of Scottish football. In the 2008–09 UEFA Cup second qualification round Queens were eliminated after a battling away leg against FC Nordsjælland in Denmark. Players to have signed for Queens during the Rae regime include Jamie MacDonald (capped for Scotland under 21s while at Queens), Steve Tosh, Neil MacFarlane and Stephen Dobbie. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Chairmen and investors of football clubs in Scotland ","title":"Davie Rae"},{"id":"19262401","text":"The East Riding County Football Association is the governing body of football in the East Riding of Yorkshire and the city of Hull, England. The East Riding runs a number of county cup competitions at different levels for its affiliated teams. ==History and organisation== Before the formation of the County, football in the area was under the jurisdiction of a Hull & District FA and the Scarborough & East Riding FA. On 10 February 1902, the Football Association issued ‘the Recommendations of a Commission appointed to enquire into the position of the Yorkshire Associations’. The recommendations came into effect on 1 May 1902 forming the new East Riding of Yorkshire FA – “the area to be the East Riding of York. The present Hull and District Association to change its name and take control of the area.” During the last 100 years, the County has administered football in the area with the stewardship in the hands of volunteers, with a steady increase in the number of clubs, but very few landmarks – the foremost possibly being the introduction of Sunday football in the early fifties. However, the FA led expansion of football at all levels has seen dramatic changes in recent years. For the first time an office was set up with full-time paid staff – previously being administered from officers’ homes. The Association became a Limited Company in 1999 and in 2001 a full-time Football Development Officer appointed. The ECRFA are in the process of completing their new Headquarters built at Inglemire Lane. ==Affiliated leaguesMen's Saturday Leagues=== *Humber Premier League *East Riding Amateur League *East Riding County League *Driffield and District League ===Men's Sunday Leagues=== *Hull Sunday Men's League ===Ladies and Girls Leagues=== *East Riding Women's League *East Riding Girls Football League ===Youth Leagues=== *East Yorkshire Junior League *Hull Boys Sunday Football League ===Other Leagues=== *Hull and District Veterans League *East Riding Pan Disability League Source ===Small Sided Leagues=== *Beverley Leisure Centre *Beverley Soccer Sixes *Bransholme Soccer Sixes (Champion Soccer) *Bridlington 5-a-side (Football Mundial) *Driffield Soccer Sixes (Champion Soccer) *Hull Corporate 6 a side (Football Mundial) :- Hull University :- Kelvin Hall High School *Hull City Fives *Hull Grassroots *North Ferriby Soccer Sixes (Champion Soccer) *Warners Source ==Disbanded or amalgamated leagues== Leagues that were affiliated to the East Riding County FA but have disbanded or amalgamated with other leagues include: *Driffield and District Minor League *East Riding Church League *South Holderness League The East Riding County FA was founded in 1902, there was a ‘Scarborough and East Riding FA’ for 20 years before that.

Because of governmental regulation, Japan has a relatively small number of radio stations. Japan also has a comparatively smaller number of radio listeners nationwide than most other developed countries as well as countries in the geographic region. This is because of several factors, including the cultural difference in perception of radio, the fact that cars in Japan come with dashboard televisions fitted as standard,https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323296504578397020440247856 In Japan, Television Viewing Doesn't Have to Take a Back Seat as well as general disinterest in the medium among working younger audiences compared with other mediums, especially television. Generally, each prefecture has three NHK stations, one private AM station (some are also on FM), and one private FM station. Heavily populated areas, such as Kantō region or Kansai region, have more stations. There are also an increasing number of AM stations that start broadcasting on FM (on 90-95 MHz) as a supplement. The stations that air on the band are called or . The stations with \\"TV\\" signs also broadcast television.

The ancient and modern name of the country is Hellas or Hellada (; in polytonic: ), and its official name is the Hellenic Republic, \\"Helliniki Dimokratia\\" (Ελληνική Δημοκρατία ). In English, however, the country is usually called Greece, which comes from the Latin Graecia (as used by the Romans) and literally means 'the land of the Greeks'. ==Origin== The English name Greece and the similar adaptations in other languages derive from the Latin name Graecia (Greek: ), literally meaning 'the land of the Greeks', which was used by Ancient Romans to denote the area of modern-day Greece. Similarly, the Latin name of the nation was Graeci, which is the origin of the English name Greeks. Those names, in turn, trace their origin from Graecus, the Latin adaptation of the Greek name Γραικός (pl. ), which means 'Greek', but its etymology remains uncertain. It is unclear why the Romans called the country Graecia and its people Graeci, but the Greeks called their land Hellas and themselves Hellenes. Several speculations have been made. William Smith notes in his Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography that foreigners frequently refer to people by a different name (an exonym) from their native one (an endonym).. Aristotle was the first to use the name Graeci (), in his Meteorology. He wrote that the area around Dodona and the Achelous River was inhabited by the Selli and a people, who had been called Graeci but were called Hellenes by his time.Aristotle, Meteorology, 1.14 From that statement, it is asserted that the name of Graeci was once widely used in Epirus and the rest of the western coast of Greece. It thus became the name by which the Hellenes were known to the Italic peoples, who were on the opposite side of the Ionian Sea. According to Hesiod, in his Catalogue of Women, Graecus was the son of Pandora and Zeus and gave his name to the people who followed the Hellenic customs. His brother Latinus gave his name to the Latins.Hesiod, Catalogue of Women, 2 Similarly, the eponymous Hellen is supposed to have given his name to the Greeks, or Hellenes. In his Ethnica, Stephanus of Byzantium also states that Graecus, the son of Thessalus, was the origin of the name Graeci for the Hellenes.Stephanus, Ethnica, p. 212. The name Yūnān (), came through Old Persian during the Achaemenid Empire (550-333 BC). It was derived from the Old Persian Yauna for the Ionian Greeks (, iāones), on the western coast of Asia Minor and were the first Greeks to come into contact with the Persians. The term would eventually be applied to all the Greeks.Johannes Engels, \\"Ch. 5: Macedonians and Greeks\\", In: Roisman and Worthington, \\"A companion to Ancient Macedonia\\", p. 87. Oxford Press, 2010. Today, words derived from Yūnān can be found in Persian, Turkish, Azerbaijani, Uzbek, Kurdish, Armenian (as Yūnānistan \\"land of Yūnān\\"; -istan \\"land\\" in Persian), Arabic, Hebrew (Biblical and Modern)(Yavan יָוָן), Aramaic (identical to Hebrew), Indian languages (such as Hindi and Urdu), Pashto, Laz, Indonesian, and Malay. The eastern part of the Roman Empire, which was predominantly Greek-speaking, gave rise to the name (Rhomania or Romania). In fact, for a long time that started in Late Antiquity, the Greeks called themselves (sg. : Romans). Those terms or related ones are still sometimes used even in Modern Greek: (from . There was tension with Western Europe on how Roman the western and the eastern parts of the Roman Empire really were. The historian Hieronymus Wolf, after the Eastern Roman Empire had ceased to exist, was the first to call it the Byzantine Empire, the term that later became usual in the West. However, because it lasted almost 1000 years longer than the Western Roman Empire, Persians, Arabs, and Turks, all in the East, used and sometimes still use terms from Rhomania or Rome, such as Rûm, to refer to its land or people. ==List of names in other languagesGraecia- derived names=== The first major form of names derives from the Latin Graecus and Graecia or their equivalent forms in Greek whence the former derive themselves. These terms have fallen out of use in Greek. *Albanian: Greqia *Afrikaans: Griekeland *Basque: Grezia *Belarusian: Грэцыя (Hrecyja) *Bengali: গ্রিস (Gris) *Bulgarian: Гърция (Gǎrtsiya) *Catalan: Grècia *Chechen: Греци (Gretsi) *Cornish: Pow Grek *Czech: Řecko *Danish: Grækenland *Dutch: Griekenland *English: Greece *Esperanto: Grekio/Grekujo/Greklando *Estonian: Kreeka *Filipino: Gresya *Finnish: Kreikka *French: Grèce *Galician: Grecia *German: Griechenland *Haitian Creole: Grès *Hungarian: Görögország *Icelandic: Grikkland *Irish: An Ghréig *Italian: Grecia *Japanese: ギリシャ (Girisha) *Kannada: ಗ್ರೀಸ್ (Grīs) *Korean: 그리스 (Geuriseu) *Latvian: Grieķija *Lithuanian: Graikija *Macedonian: Грција / Grcija *Malagasy: Grisy *Malayalam: ഗ്രീസ് (Grīs) *Maltese: Greċja *Māori: Kirihi *Marathi: ग्रीस (Grīs) *Mongolian: Грек / (Gryek) *Nepali: ग्रीस (Grīs) *Odia:ଗ୍ରୀସ (Grīs) *Polish: Grecja *Portuguese: Grécia *Romanian: Grecia *Russian: Греция (Gretsiya) *Scots Gaelic: A 'Ghrèig *Serbo-Croatian: Грчка/Grčka *Sinhala: ග්රීසිය Grisiya *Slovak: Grécko *Slovenian: Grčija *Spanish: Grecia *Swedish: Grekland *Tamil: கிரீஸ் (Kirīs) *Telugu: గ్రీస్ (Grīs) *Thai: กรีซ (Krit) *Udmurt: Грециялэн (Gretsijalen) *Ukrainian: Греція (Hretsiya) *Welsh: Groeg *West Frisian: Grikelân ===Ionia-derived names=== The second major form, used in many languages and in which the common root is yun or ywn, is borrowed from the Greek name Ionia, the Ionian tribe region of Asia Minor. In Greek, these forms have never normally been used to denote the whole Greek nation or Greece. In Sanskrit literature in India, the word यवन yavana is derived from this origin. It was used specifically for Greek people until 250 BCE while Indian kingdoms often traded with Greece. After Alexander's invasion on western borders of India, the word took a new meaning as foreigner or invader. The word यवन yawan, meaning 'foreigner,' is still in use in languages like Hindi, Marathi and Malayalam. *Arabic: اليونان (al-Yōnān, al-Yūnān) *Aramaic: ܝܘܢ or יון (Yawān, Yawon) * (Hunastan) ** (Yunastan) *Azerbaijani: Yunanıstan *Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu): यूनान / یونان (Yūnān) *Hebrew **Biblical: יָוָן (Yavan, possibly pronounced Yāwān) **KJV Bible Medieval English corruption of Hebrew via European languages which pronounce J as Y): Javan **Modern: יוון (Yavan) *Kurdish: Yunanistan *Laz: Yonaneti-Xorumona (ჲონანეთი-ხორუმონა) *Malay (Malaysian and Indonesian): Yunani *Malayalam: യവനൻ (Yavanan) *Persian: یونان (Yūnān) *Punjabi: ਯੂਨਾਨ / یونان (Yūnān) *Sanskrit: यवन (Yavana) *Tajik: Юнон (Yunon) *Turkish: Yunanistan *Urdu: یونآن (Yūnān) *Uzbek: Yunoniston ===Hellas-derived names=== The third major form, \\"Hellas\\" and its derivatives, is used by a few languages around the world, including Greek itself. In several European languages in which the normal term is derived from Graecia, names derived from Hellas exist as rare or poetic alternatives. *Greek **Polytonic: (Hellas, Hellada) **Monotonic: (Ellas, Ellada) *Chinese: 希臘 / 希腊 () *Vietnamese: Hy Lạp / 希臘 *Hawaiian: Helena *English: Hellas (rare usage, poetic) *Norwegian (both Nynorsk and Bokmål): Hellas * (rare usage) *Korean: 희랍 (huirap) (rare usage) *Portuguese: Hélade (rare usage) *Serbian Cyrillic: Хелада (archaic, poetic) *Russian: Эллада (poetic, ancient Greece) *Spanish: Hélada/Hélade (rare usage) *Bulgarian: Елада, latinized: Elada *Polish: Hellada (poetic) ===Georgian name=== The Georgian name of Greece is derived from the Georgian word \\"brdzeni\\" (wise), with the meaning \\"wise people's country\\". * (Saberdzneti) * (Saberdzemo) ==Official name of the modern Greek state== Government papers header \\"Hellenic State\\", 1828 From its establishment after the outbreak of the Greek War of Liberation in 1821, the modern Greek state has used a variety of official names, most often designating changes of regime. * 1821–28: \\"Provisional Administration of Greece\\" (Προσωρινή Διοίκησις τῆς Ἑλλάδος), used by the provisional government before the international recognition of Greek autonomy (and later independence) in the London Protocol. * 1828–32: \\"Hellenic State\\" (Ἑλληνική Πολιτεία), used under the governorship of Ioannis Kapodistrias. Along with the previous period, it is sometimes grouped together in the historiographic term \\"First Hellenic Republic\\". * 1832–1924: \\"Kingdom of Greece\\" (Βασίλειον τῆς Ἑλλάδος), adopted after Greece was declared a monarchy in the London Conference of 1832, and retained until the abolition of the monarchy on 25 March 1924. * 1924–35: \\"Hellenic Republic\\" (Ἑλληνική Δημοκρατία), known historiographically as the Second Hellenic Republic, from 1924 until the 10 October 1935 coup by Georgios Kondylis and the restoration of the monarchy. * 1935–73: \\"Kingdom of Greece\\" (Βασίλειον τῆς Ἑλλάδος), from the restoration of the monarchy in 1935 to its abolition by the Regime of the Colonels junta on 1 June 1973. Between 1941–44 used by the internationally recognized Greek government in exile. ** 1941–44: \\"Hellenic State\\" (Ἑλληνική Πολιτεία), used by the collaborationist government of Greece during the occupation by the Axis Powers in World War II. * 1973–today: \\"Hellenic Republic\\" (Ελληνική Δημοκρατία), from the abolition of the monarchy by the military junta to the present day.

Born in the city of Vysoké Mýto (then Hohenmauth in Austria-Hungary, now part of Ústí nad Orlicí District, Pardubice Region of the Czech Republic) on 8 February 1858, he finished high school in Chrudim and Pardubice and graduated from the Technical University in Prague and in natural sciences from the University of Leipzig. From 1880 to 1906 he was a teacher at various Bulgarian cities: Plovdiv, Sofia, Sliven, Rousse and Varna, teaching natural history, geography, zoology, botany, arithmetic and the German language. He was the author of the first geologic map of Southern Bulgaria. In 1884, he founded a museum in Sliven, as well as a museum of natural sciences in Rousse in 1902. From 1906 to his death, he was the curator of the Varna Archaeological Museum. He died in the city where he spent much of his life with his brother, the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast port of Varna, on 25 June 1923. He was buried in an area near the city where he had unearthed an early Christian basilica. All research by the Škorpil brothers was self-funded and all unearthed monuments have been preserved in Bulgaria. A street in Varna where their house is located and the Black Sea village and seaside resort Shkorpilovtsi were named after the brothers. Their hometown Vysoké Mýto is also a twin town of Varna. ==Major works== * Monuments across Bulgaria (1888, co-author) * Primitive people in Bulgaria (1896) * Mounds (1898, co-author) * Władysław Warneńczyk (1923, co-author) ==References== * Category:Bulgarian archaeologists Category:Bulgarian historians Category:Bulgarian architects Category:Czech archaeologists Category:Czech historians Category:Czech architects Category:1858 births Category:1923 deaths Category:People from Vysoké Mýto Category:People from Varna Category:Charles University alumni Category:Leipzig University alumni Category:Bulgarian people of Czech descent Category:Czech Technical University in Prague alumni Category:Bulgarian cartographers ","title":"Hermann Škorpil"},{"id":"19262492","text":"Lleyton Hewitt was the defending champion but did not compete that year.

After many disappointing results since Andorra's debut in 2004, on top of Andorra's poor 16th place in the semi at the 2008 contest, RTVA announced in June 2008 that they had not decided on whether or not they would be present at the 2009 contest. However, on 10 September it was announced by RTVA that they would be present at Eurovision 2009, announcing a new proposal for a national final that would be used to select the Andorran representative. The winner of the national final was Susanne Georgi with the song \\"La teva decisió\\", and she was the sixth Andorran Eurovision entry, competing in the first semi-final on 12 May 2009. Georgi failed to reach the final becoming the sixth Andorran Eurovision entrant to miss the grand final. == Before Eurovision  Passaport a Moscou === Passaport a Moscou was the national final organised by RTVA that selected Andorra's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2009. The competition took place on 4 February 2009 at the Apolo Andorra Hall in Andorra la Vella, hosted by Meri Picart. The winner was decided upon through a combination of public SMS voting and an expert jury panel.  Competing entries  A submission period was open for artists and composers to submit demo versions of their entries between 24 October 2008 and 1 December 2008. The minimum age for artists was 18 and each artist could submit up to three songs, with at least one being performed in Catalan. Artists and composers of any nationality were also able to submit entries, but those that have Andorran citizenship, musical experience and fluency in Catalan, English and French will be given priority. Songs performed in Catalan will also be given priority. At the conclusion of the submission period, 107 applications were received: 64 songs were submitted without an artist attached, 28 artists applied with a song and 15 artists applied without a song. 41 of the applicants came from Andorra, 27 from Spain; 8 from France and Lithuania; 6 from Sweden; 4 from Greece and Malta; 3 from Belgium; 2 from Ireland and Israel and 1 from Iceland and the United Kingdom. From the received applications, an expert committee selected three entries for the national final. The three competing entries were announced on 13 December 2008 and presented over three presentation shows on 14, 21 and 28 January 2009. On 29 December 2008, \\"Estrelles d'or\\" performed by Marc Durandeau and Marc Canturri were disqualified from the national final as Durandeau had submitted a similar song into the Spanish selection for 2008. They were replaced by \\"Passió obsessiva\\" performed by Mar Capdevila. { class=\\"sortable \\" style=\\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; - !Artist !Song !Songwriter(s) - bgcolor=\\"gold\\"  align=\\"left\\" Susanne Georgi  align=\\"left\\" \\"La teva decisió\\"  align=\\"left\\" Susanne Georgi, Rune Braager, Lene Dissing, Pernille Georgi, Marcus Winther-John, Josep Roca Vila -  align=\\"left\\"  Lluís Cartes  align=\\"left\\" \\"Exhaust\\"  align=\\"left\\"  Lluís Cartes -  align=\\"left\\"  Mar Capdevila  align=\\"left\\"  \\"Passió obsessiva\\"  align=\\"left\\"  Josep Roca, José Juan Santana, Gonzalo Vandelvira - bgcolor=\\"#F08080\\"  align=\\"left\\"  ~~Marc Durandeau & Marc Canturri~~  align=\\"left\\"  ~~\\"Estrelles d'or\\"~~  align=\\"left\\"  ~~Marc Durandeau~~ }  Final  The final took place on 4 February 2009.

However Susanna did promote her entry to some degree. On 27 February, Susanna performed on Punto Radio in neighbouring Spain. This was followed by promotion in Susanna's home country Denmark, getting extensive coverage in newspapers, and on radio and TV, as well as performing at the Danish Grammy Awards. Spanish broadcaster Televisión Española (TVE) revealed that Andorra would be among a number of nations to perform in a special Eurovision show held days before the final on TVE. The show featured Susanna performing \\"La teva decisió\\" along with entries from five other countries, the Big 4 of Spain, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, as well as Greece and a number of past Eurovision artists. ==At Eurovision== Since Andorra did not win the 2008 contest, it had to compete in one of the two semi-finals. Andorra competed in the first semi-final of the contest on 12 May, where Susanna performed 7th in the running order, following Armenia and preceding Switzerland. RTVA revealed that they were unhappy with the European Broadcasting Union (EBU)'s decision to allow Spain to switch semi-finals for their voting. Having originally been drawn to vote in the first semi-final, the same semi-final as Andorra, TVE asked the EBU to switch semi-finals to allow for promotion of Eurovision itself. RTVA announced their disappointment on this decision, as RTVA believed that, without Spain voting, Andorra's chances of qualifying would be lower. There was also a feeling that the amount of promotion done in Spain was to no avail. At Eurovision, Susanna revealed that she would be accompanied on stage by four backing singers. She also explicitly stated that she would not use backing dancers, as opposed the Spanish entry Soraya, as her performance did not require such resources to improve her performance. ===Points awarded by AndorraEurovision Song Contest 2009=== Semi-final 1 {  - width=20% bgcolor=\\"gold\\"12 points - width=20% bgcolor=\\"silver\\"10 points - width=20% bgcolor=\\"#CC9966\\"8 points - width=20%7 points - width=20%6 points - width=20%5 points - width=20%4 points - width=20%3 points - width=20%2 points - width=20%1 point - } Final {  - width=20% bgcolor=\\"gold\\"12 points - width=20% bgcolor=\\"silver\\"10 points - width=20% bgcolor=\\"#CC9966\\"8 points - width=20%7 points - width=20%6 points - width=20%5 points - width=20%4 points - width=20%3 points - width=20%2 points - width=20%1 point - } { class=\\"sortable  collapsible\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !colspan=11 Split voting results from Andorra (final) - !

By 1919, Kakungulu (a Christian preacher until an epiphany led him to embrace Judaism) had convinced 3,000 of his community to follow the ancient example of Abraham and receive circumcisions. And while he did his best to ensure that other Jewish rites were adhered to, the community’s remote location made proper rabbinic access impossible. In early 2002, however, five Conservative rabbis agreed to journey to Nabugoye Hill in rural Uganda to fulfill the Abayudaya’s request that they be formally converted to Judaism and accepted into the larger worldwide Jewish community. Filmmaker Debra Gonsher Vinik and her film crew followed along and captured the emotional conversions. During the 1970s the Abayudaya’s mud hut synagogues and lands were confiscated by the government of Idi Amin, and they were barred from publicly practicing Judaism. After Amin was overthrown and freedom of worship restored, uncertainty and religious malaise fell over the community, until a youth movement reinvigorated the faithful. Vinik’s camera now tracks two of the leaders of that movement, Gershom Sizomu and his brother J.J., as they visit the U.S. to drum up public support for acceptance of their conversion. Gaining acceptance by all branches of the Jewish community proves difficult, however. Vinik arranges for a meeting with rabbis from three different Jewish denominations, and the camera is rolling when the brothers are told how their status as Jews is questionable based on the narrow definitions of Orthodox conversion. Later, Vinik asks noted theologian Rabbi Ismar Schorsch about the reasoning for such “inflexible” spiritual stances. “The sad fact is that conversion in Judaism has become a power struggle between Orthodox and the non-Orthodox, to the great detriment of the Jewish people,” he says. ==See also== Other documentaries about atypical Jewish communities: *Sister Wife *A Home on the Range *Island of Roses *From Swastika to Jim Crow Other films produced by Debra Gonsher Vinik, David Vinik and Diva Communications: ==References== * ==External links== *The Jewish Channel's review *Yearning to Belong in Diva Communications * Category:2007 films Category:Documentary films about historical events Category:Jewish Ugandan history Category:Ugandan films Category:Documentary films about Jews and Judaism ","title":"Yearning to Belong"},{"id":"19262617","text":"The 90th Guards Rifle Vitebsk Division was an infantry division of the Red Army during World War II. Formed from the 325th Rifle Division in recognition of its actions during the winter of 1943, the division fought in the Battle of Kursk, the Belgorod-Khar'kov Offensive Operation, Operation Bagration, the Baltic Offensive, the Vistula–Oder Offensive, and the East Prussian Offensive. == Formation == The division was formed on April 18, 1943, by the re- designation of the first formation of the 325th Rifle Division, which had distinguished itself in the advance of 21st Army in Central Front in the late winter of that year. At about the same time, 21st Army became the 6th Guards Army. When formed, the order of battle of the 90th Guards was as follows: * 268th Guards Rifle Regiment, from 1092nd Rifle Regiment * 272nd Guards Rifle Regiment, from 1094th Rifle Regiment * 274th Guards Rifle Regiment, from 1096th Rifle Regiment * 193rd Guards Artillery Regiment, from 893rd Artillery RegimentCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Guards\\", Soviet Guards Rifle and Airborne Units 1941 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol IV, Nafziger, 1995, p. 81 It was one of the first units assigned to the new 22nd Guards Rifle Corps, and Maj. Gen. Nikolai Boleslavovich Ibianskii was moved from command of the division to command of the corps on the same day. He was replaced in command of the division by Col. Viktor Georgievich Chernov. This officer would continue in command until September 12.Valeriy Zamulin, Demolishing the Myth, ed. and trans. by Stuart Britton, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2011, p. 108. Note that Zamulin gives Chernov's initials as \\"V.P.\\" and states in the index that his rank is unknown. ==Battle of Kursk== As the Battle of Kursk began on July 5, 1943 6th Guards Army was in Voronezh Front, defending the south side of the salient, and 90th Guards was in the second echelon of its Army, dug in behind the swampy basin of the Pena River to defend the most likely German axis of attack towards Oboyan. After the first day's fighting, during which XXXXVIII Panzer Corps and part of II SS Panzer Corps had damaged and forced back the Army's first echelon, Gen. N.F. Vatutin, the Front commander, ordered the 1st Tank Army to support the second echelon. Overnight, 6th Tank Corps buttressed the left and center of the division, while 3rd Mechanized Corps also moved up in support. These reinforcements were important, because the 90th Guards had started the battle understrength, having yielded a rifle battalion and part of its artillery to the first echelon.Zamulin, pp. 106-08 By nightfall on July 6, elements of the first echelon (52nd and 67th Guards Rifle Divisions) had been encircled and were forced to slip out through gaps in the German lines, at considerable cost. The Germans attempted to continue their attack, but were frustrated by the stubborn resistance of the 90th Guards in the strongpoints of Zavidovka, Lukhanino, and Syrtsevo, all in the basin of the Pena, with the support of the two corps of the tank army; 6th Tank in particular inflicted significant damage on a tank group of 3rd Panzer Division in Zavidovka, forcing it to abandon the village and retreat. By the afternoon of the 9th it was becoming clear that the German forces were re-directing their offensive away from the road to Oboyan in favor of a more easterly route. 90th Guards and 10th Motorized Brigade at Lukhanino and Shepelevka were coming under more intense attacks as the Germans tried to outflank 6th Tank. By the end of July 11, XXXXVIII Panzer Corps, in intense fighting, forced the ad-hoc Group Getman (6th Tank, most of 3rd Mechanized, and 90th Guards) out of the area of the Psel River bend and partially encircled it. As the eastern re-direction continued, the reinforced 6th Guards Army was ordered to make a frontal counterattack with practically its full strength on July 12. The division, along with the rest of 22nd Guards Corps, was to make the main attack from the Chapaev - Novenkoe - Kruglik line along the Syrtsevo - Yakovlevo axis. The goal of this attack was to hold the German forces in place and prevent them from massing more strength at Prokhorovka. In the event, the attack did significant damage to the German 332nd Infantry Division, which was caught regrouping, and recaptured Chapaev, but realized few other positive results.Zamulin, pp. 117, 261, 427-30 ==Advance== Following the German offensive, the division required a short period of rebuilding before taking part in the Belgorod-Khar'kov Offensive Operation in August - September. On August 13 it took part in an attack on the 3rd SS Panzer Division, along with the 52nd Guards Rifle Division and 6th Tank Corps. 3rd SS had deployed virtually all of its forces north of the Merchyk River, leaving only its reconnaissance battalion to screen south of it. The combined Soviet force pushed through the German light armor, recaptured Vysokopolye and linked up with 49th Tank Brigade, which had been isolated in this area the previous day. However, a renewed attack by 3rd and 2nd SS on the following days damaged the tank corps and retook the village, although the Germans believed they had done more damage than was, in fact, the case.Robert A. Forczyk, Tank Warfare on the Eastern Front 1943-1945, Pen & Sword Books, Ltd., Barnsley, UK, 2016, p. 165. Forczyk states that the 90th Guards was in 23rd Guards Rifle Corps. That was true of the 52nd, but 90th Guards was still in 22nd Guards Corps: Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 193 Later that month 90th Guards was moved to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. On September 13, Col. Vasilii Efimovich Vlasov (promoted to Major General June 3, 1944) took command of the division, a post he held into the postwar. In October, 90th Guards was moved north with 6th Guards Army to the 2nd Baltic Front, entering positions northwest of Nevel. Less than a month later the division was reassigned to 4th Shock Army in the 1st Baltic Front; it continued to serve in this Front throughout 1944, in 4th Shock and back into 6th Guards Army, as well as periods in reserve.Sharp, \\"Red Guards\\", p. 81 On November 10 the division was in the first echelon of 22nd Guards Rifle Corps as it launched an attack to try to cut off the German salient northeast of Nevel in conjunction with 3rd Shock Army. The forward progress was painfully slow, gaining only 600 - 700 metres on the first day. This effort was soon shut down.David M. Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 149-150 At the start of Operation Bagration, the division was back in 22nd Guards Rifle Corps (as its only actual Guards division) in 6th Guards Army. That army had been moved in secrecy into the line north of the German-held Vitebsk salient over three nights previous to the attack. On the second day of the offensive the 90th Guards, along with its corps, advanced 7 km, clearing the series of lakes and rivers defended by the Germans; by the end of the day 1st Tank Corps was advancing through wide gaps in those defenses. Late on June 24, 6th Guards Army reached the Western Dvina River but did not immediately break through the enemy holding that line. On that same day, farther east, Soviet forces completed the encirclement of the Vitebsk salient. On June 27, as 6th Guards Army victoriously advanced to the west, it was held up at Obol; the division and its corps secured the town by the end of the day. On June 30, 22nd Guards Corps was on the rail line from Dvinsk to Polotsk, and on the following day reached the eastern edge of Polotsk, a vital rail center. Over the next three days the division fought to secure this city against desperate enemy resistance, and the massive gap between Army Groups North and Center grew wider.Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2008, pp. 93-94, 96-98, 102-03, 104-05, 109, 112 In recognition of its service in these actions, the 90th Guards Rifle Division was awarded the name \\"Vitebsk\\" as an honorific: The division was further recognized on July 23 with the award of the Order of the Red Banner for its role in the liberation of Polotsk. As the Baltic Offensive developed, 90th Guards advanced westward as far as the town of Sharkovshchina around July 8. By the end of the month, the division was back in 4th Shock Army and had assisted in the takeover of the city of Panevezhys in Lithuania. In mid- September it was fighting in the vicinity of Birzhai, still in 4th Shock; by early October it had reached the Shiauliai area and was back in 6th Guards Army.The Gamers, Inc., Baltic Gap, Multi-Man Publishing, Inc., Millersville, MD, 2009, pp. 14, 21, 29, 35 In February, 1945, during the East Prussian Offensive, the division was assigned to 14th Rifle Corps in 3rd Belorussian Front, striking through eastern Pomerania to the Baltic coast of Germany.Sharp, \\"Red Guards\\", p 81 On Mar. 1, it was merged with the 378th Rifle Division. The 90th Guards Rifle Division thus inherited the 378th's honorific \\"Novgorod\\" and its Order of the Red Banner. On May 1 it was still in 14th Rifle Corps, immediately subordinate to 2nd Belorussian Front.Combat composition of the Soviet Army 1 May 1945 In that same month it was designated as part of the occupation forces for the German portion of Poland; at this time the men and women of the division shared the full title 90th Guards Rifle, Vitebsk - Novgorod, twice Order of the Red Banner Division.

In 1957, it again was re-designated, this time as the 38th Guards Tank Division, which held until 1965 when it went back to the 90th Guards Tank Division. In an exchange of numbers, the 6th Guards Motor Rifle Division in Germany in 1985 became the 90th Guards Tank Division, while the 90th Guards Tank Division became the 6th Guards Motor Rifle Division.в соответствии с директивами Министра обороны СССР №314/1/00900 от 4 декабря 1984 г. и Генерального штаба ВС СССР №314/3/0224 от 8 февраля 1985 г. ==ReferencesCitations=Bibliography=== * * * p. 329 == External links == *Viktor Georgievich Chernov *Vasilii Efimovich Vlasov G090 Category:Military units and formations established in 1943 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1946 Category:Military units and formations awarded the Order of the Red Banner ","title":"90th Guards Rifle Division"},{"id":"19262647","text":"Cliff Holman (born James Clifton Holman, Jr. June 29, 1929 in Mobile, Alabama; died September 8, 2008 in Albertville, Alabama), best known as \\"Cousin Cliff,\\" was a well-known television personality in the Birmingham, Alabama market. As Cousin Cliff, he hosted a variety of children's shows, with the longest- running version shown daily on WABT, later WAPI. ==Early life== Holman was born in Mobile, but his family soon moved to Birmingham. He attended Woodlawn High School, and began performing the magic act that would eventually lead him to television. Before entering television (and briefly while he was on TV as well), Holman worked in a creamery and ran his own grocery. ==\\"Cousin Cliff\\" and television== Holman began his television career in 1950 as a puppeteer for a short-run show (in a format known today as an infomercial) for the local Loveman's department store chain. After a stint in the United States Armed Forces during the Korean War, he returned to Birmingham and sought work in the entertainment business. His break came when a local bakery began a 15-minute children's show on WABT called Tip-Top Clubhouse. The show had its debut on March 15, 1954. The bakery withdrew its sponsorship after a couple of years, but the station kept the popular show and expanded it to 30 minutes, five days a week, renaming it Cliff's Clubhouse. The show eventually evolved into The Popeye Show, featuring a live studio audience and Popeye cartoons.BirmimnghamRewound.com: \\"Magic City Kid's Shows: Cousin Cliff\\" Holman performed magic tricks throughout the show, and his captain's hat and ribbon tie became his trademark. Holman was closely identified with the primary sponsors of his show, Pepsi-Cola and local fast food chain Jack's Hamburgers. The show was so popular that tickets for children to appear in the live studio audience were often booked months in advance.TVparty.com: Cousin Cliff Holman In 1968, WAPI began taping the show instead of broadcasting it live, and moved the schedule to the following morning — largely missing its intended audience of children, who would be in school at the time. Holman was unhappy with the move and the plunging viewership, and took a position with new station WHMA in nearby Anniston, Alabama in 1969. The Cousin Cliff Show ran there for three more years, sponsored by McDonald's, Jack's main competitor. The Sergeant Jack Show starring Neal Miller, an actual Jefferson County deputy sheriff (deputized primarily for the show's purposes) took over Holman's slot and sponsorship. Holman left television, working a number of positions in and out of media, until he revived his show on cable television in 1985. The show had a short stint on independent station WDBB. In 1990 Holman was back on broadcast television with Cousin Cliff's Clubhouse, a Saturday-only show on WBRC-TV. That show ran for two years, after which Holman again produced a cable version for Jack's Hamburgers. After a short run, Holman retired from television altogether. Holman was also seen on various other variety shows in both Birmingham and Anniston over the years, and also worked behind the cameras. Holman was also an early on-air promoter of the Muscular Dystrophy Association. In the days before its now-famous Jerry Lewis Telethon became a nationwide tradition, \\"Cousin Cliff' encouraged children to hold backyard carnivals to raise money for MDA, and hosted his own carnival in the WAPI studio parking lot as well. ==After television== After leaving television, Holman performed his magic and comedy act in numerous venues. He also worked as a manager for the Parliament House hotel, and public relations manager for the local chapter of the American Lung Association, and an announcer for WCRT radio. He successfully ran for a seat on the Vestavia Hills city council in 1980, but declined to stand for re-election after becoming disenchanted with the position and politics. His health took a turn for the worse after a fall following a performance in 2001. He was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2007 and moved to a hospice in Albertville, where he died in 2008. Holman's battle with Alzheimer's was highlighted in the 2009 HBO documentary The Alzheimer's Project. The funeral was held at Mountain Chapel United Methodist Church in Vestavia Hills. His interment was located in Birmingham's Elmwood Cemetery. Holmam was survived by his wife, Ann; daughter Lynn Holman Brown and son Kyle Holman; and two grandchildren. Another son, James Clifton Holman III, died in December 2006. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Hollis, Tim (March 1991) Cousin Cliff: 40 Magical Years in Television.

It was directed by Don Sharp and starred Donald Sutherland, Vanessa Redgrave, Richard Widmark, Christopher Lee and Lloyd Bridges. ==Plot== A UN expedition of scientists from different countries come to barren arctic Bear Island, between Svalbard and northern Norway, to study climate change. However, several of them turn out to be more interested in the fact that (according to the film) there was a German U-boat base on the island during the Second World War. American scientist Frank Lansing (Donald Sutherland) has come because his father was a U-boat commander who died there, and as accidents start to decimate the expedition he begins to realise that some of his colleagues are after a shipment of gold aboard the U-boat that his father commanded. ==CastProductionDevelopment=== The original novel was published in 1971 and became a best-seller, selling over eight million copies. \\"It will make a whopping good movie,\\" wrote the Los Angeles Times. In 1976 Maclean's second wife Mary formed a company with producer Peter Snell, Aleelle Productions, who aimed to make movies based on MacLean novels including Golden Gate, Bear Island, The Way to Dusty Death and Captain Cook. Film rights came solely into the hands of the Canadian-born Peter Snell who had lived in England since 1961. Snell set up the film in Canada, which was experiencing a film boom due to the assistance of tax concessions in 1976 allowing the write-off of losses on films that qualify as sufficiently Canadian.FILM CLIPS: Canadians Shooting for the Big Leagues Lee, Grant. Los Angeles Times 13 Jan 1979: b10. Snell wanted to make a film that targeted the international market; there would be no Canadian characters and the film was not set in Canada. However Snell and several of the actors and most of the crew were Canadian. \\"Three in every eight households have a MacLean novel,\\" said Snell. \\"He's certainly sold better than Ian Fleming. The James Bond pictures are fast running out of gimmicks. Action-adventure will always work better in the long run if you stay away from gimmicks.\\" In November 1978 it was announced the movie would be the most expensive made in Canada until that time, costing over $9 million.Medved & Medved, The Hollywood Hall of Shame (1984), p. 204Backstage MOVIE-GO-ROUND The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont. [Toronto, Ont]25 Nov 1978: P.37. \\"You've got to come up with something television can't,\\" said Snell. \\"You've got to come up with spectacle.\\" Of the budget, $3.3 million came from the British arm of Columbia Pictures, $3 million from the Canadian radio and cable television company, Selkirk Holdings, $1.8 million from the Toronto Dominion Bank, $1.2 million from the Bank of Montreal, and $100,000 from the Canadian Film Development Corporation (the latter was seed money for pre production and was paid back when the film was financed). The Bank of Montreal lent the producers money to make the film. When the producers could not raise finance, the bank was forced to become investors. Don Sharp, well known for his action films, was hired to direct. He also rewrote the script. A number of changes were made from the novel including changing the ship's passengers from a movie crew to a scientific expeditions, altering the characters, and arriving at the island earlier. Snell said MacLean was supportive of the changes. Snell wanted to make the movie on location, feeling audiences would not react well the shooting \\"studio snow\\" which had been the method used on an earlier MacLean adaptation, Ice Station Zebra. \\"Audiences can tell styrofoam snow,\\" said Snell. It was the thirteen film made from a MacLean novel. Snell said \\"He compained of no continuity\\" with the previous films \\"but with me he's close to being a partner. Usually his books get bought and he's invited to the premiere. In his case I'm on the phone regularly to him in Geneva where he lives and he's getting a kick out of it.\\" ===Shooting=== Filming started 22 November 1978 in Stewart, British Columbia. The unit were based at Stewart for seven weeks then moved to Glacier Bay National Park in Alaska. Location filming in Stewart and Glacier Bay took three months. A Soviet ship was used to transport the unit. It was hired for three weeks but because of bad weather was needed for another week at $6,000 a day. The cast and crew numbered 103 and there were 101 Russian crewmembers, 66 of which were women. The shoot was difficult. Vic Armstrong was put in charge of the second unit. One day he went on a location scout up the mountain in a helicopter with Sharp, and three others and they were stuck for four days due to bad weather without food or proper clothing; they survived by staying in the helicopter and by eating the pilot's lunch over several days. When they returned, six feet of snow fell overnight and a week's filming was lost as they dug out of snow.Backstage The Globe and Mail 16 Dec 1978: P.33. Later on during the shoot, helicopter pilot John Soutar was killed in an accident. The Swedish invention called Larven (The Caterpillar) by Lennart Nilsson is used in the chases around the island. \\"We're delighted to be working on an international picture\\", said second unit director Alan Simmonds. \\"But co-productions can be a one-way street. The whole mentality of the film is English or American - the style, the amount of money. We're good, we know we're good, but the moneymen won't take a risk on Canadians.\\" The unit then moved to London where interiors were completed at Pinewood Studios. Sutherland called his character \\"an intelligent, humorous, lonely man.\\"Sutherland: No More Goofy Roles: No More Goofy Roles For Donald Sutherland By JORDAN YOUNG.

During pre production, Snell announced he had the film rights to six other MacLean novels, three of them not written. Snell and Selkirk were so positive about Bear Island's prospects that at one stage they planned a series of Alistair MacLean adaptations for annual Christmas release, starting with The Way to Dusty Death. Snell went on to make The Hostage Tower and Air Force One is Down based on MacLean stories. ==References*Bear Island at Letterbox DVD *The Making of Bear Island at British Lion *Bear Island at BFI * Review at AlistairMacLean.com * Review at New York Times Category:1979 films Category:1970s action thriller films Category:1970s adventure films Category:1970s mystery films Category:Films set in the Arctic Category:British action films Category:British adventure films Category:British films Category:British mystery films Category:Canadian films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films based on works by Alistair MacLean Category:Films directed by Don Sharp Category:Films set in Norway Category:Films set on islands Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios Category:Svalbard in fiction Category:United Artists films ","title":"Bear Island (film)"},{"id":"19262730","text":"Manuel Corona Raimundo (17 June 1880, in Caibarién - 9 January 1950 in Marianao, Havana) was a Cuban trova musician, and a long-term professional rival of Sindo Garay.

He came to Havana when the Cuban War of Independence broke out, and worked as a bootblack and a cigar-roller. His supervisor at the cigar factory taught him the guitar, and in 1905 he set up in a café in the red-light district of San Isidro. The district was controlled by the chulo (pimp) Alberto Yarini (1882-1910), who became famous for introducing French prostitutes (putas francesas) willing to perform more salacious acts than even the Cubans were used to.Canizares, Dulcila 2000.

The attack, commanded by Colonel Stanislaw Karolkiewicz, was a revenge for German atrocities, committed in Bezirk Bialystok against Polish population. The targets of the attack included devoted Nazis, members of NSDAP and inhabitants engaging in brutality against Polish population. According to Polish sources, some 70 Germans were killed and 40 German farms were razed to the ground, while an eyewitness reports 13 killed people, including a woman and two children, and two people wounded. The revenge attack caused shock among Prussian Germans and caused them to rethink their genocidal tactics against Polish populationPolacy atakują Prusy - Akcja \\"Szczęsnego\\" SZOK W REICHU, Rzeczpospolita 12.06.04 Nr 136 == Background  Under Soviet Occupation === Following Nazi and Soviet aggression on Poland in September 1939, the Second Polish Republic was divided by the two allied powers under the terms of the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact. The area of Białystok became part of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, and was annexed by the Soviet Union. Thousands ethnic Poles, and also Belarusians and Jews, were forcibly deported to Siberia. Among the deported Poles were civil servants, judges, police officers, professional army officers, factory owners, landlords, political activists, leaders of cultural, educational and religious organisations, and others activists in the community. All of them were dubbed enemies of the people.Michael Hope: Polish deportees in the Soviet Union Polish resistance against the Soviets in the area of Białystok (especially along the swampy Biebrza river) began immediately after the September Campaign and in mid-1940 there were conspirational organizations in 161 towns and villages in the future area of Bezirk Bialystok.Doctor Marek Wierzbicki of Institute of National Remembrance. Review of a book anti-Soviet conspiracy along the Biebrza, X 1939 - VI 1941 by Tomasz Strzembosz Skirmishes with the NKVD were common, mostly around Jedwabne, where the anti-Soviet feelings were the strongest. === Under Nazi Occupation === During the Nazi occupation, German terror in Bezirk Białystok worsened and most atrocities on civilian population were committed by German units and police from neighboring East Prussia.Kazimierz Krajewski, Shock in the Reich, Rzeczpospolita Daily On July 17, 1943, the Germans killed all 257 inhabitants of the village of Krasowo- Czestki, near Wysokie Mazowieckie, (including 83 under seventeen years of age), ransacked their belongings and burned the village. In the following days several other massacres were committed: in the village of Sikory-Tomkowieta, German SS Kommando Mueller killed 49 people, in Zawada and Laskowce, 58 persons were killed, in Grzedy - 36, in Wnory-Wandy - 32. Altogether, in July 1943 alone, the Germans killed around 800 civilians in the western part of Bezirk Bialystok.Interview with Stanislaw Karolkiewicz Polish resistance fighters decided to take revenge on the Germans. == The attack == In July 1943 Colonel Stanisław Karolkiewicz (nom de guerre Szczęsny) organized a unit of the Striking Cadre Battalions, which was part of the right-wing Konfederacja Narodu. Its members chose their noms de guerre from characters of Pan Tadeusz, an epic poem by Adam Mickiewicz. Since the Striking Cadre Battalions headquarters permitted retaliatory attacks, the Poles decided to make a raid on East Prussia, in the area of Johannisburg. The choice was not accidental - many German soldiers and administration workers in Bezirk Bialystok came from that part of the Third Reich. There lived their families and there, the Germans felt safe. Colonel Stanislaw Karolkiewicz and his unit of 28 well- armed men, avoiding German troops, started off from the Wysokie Mazowieckie County. They crossed the Narew and the Biebrza, reaching the northern part of the Lomza County. Karolkiewicz and his men were closely cooperating with local structures of the National Armed Forces, which was a dominant underground organization in this part of occupied Poland and whose members provided Karolkiewicz with vital information about the Prussian side of the border. Karolkiewicz decided that the Poles would attack the village of Mittenheide and the forestership of Krummenheide.Bernhard Chiari, Die polnische Heimatarmee, page 349 Mittenheide (until 1938 Turoscheln, today Turośl), located 3 km north of the pre-war border. According to Kazimierz Krajewski, in 1943 the village was an armed settlement (each house was armed and the men were organised in paramilitary formation of Landwache) of 1000 people and an unknown number of escapees from western German cities, who had fled from Allied bombing.http://www.rzeczpospolita.pl/specjal_040612/specjal_a_8.html According to official German statistics the village had 519 permanent inhabitants in 1939.verwaltungsgeschichte.de (German) A police station was also located in the village. Among the residents of Mittenheide, there was SA Standartenführer Herman Upitz (or Herbert OpitzIrma Bartlick, Pochodze ze wsi Turosl ( I’m from Turosl), in \\"Znad Pisy\\", No. 7(1998), p. 79 – 83), a special envoy of Heinrich Himmler delegated to fight against Polish existence in the area, known for his hostile attitude towards Polish and Russian slave workers.Życie i myśl: Wydania 9-12, Instytut Zachodni, page 162, 1971 Other targets included houses of devoted Nazis, members of the Nazi party and inhabitants that engaged in brutality against Polish population The objectives of the attack were: * to destroy the police station, * to destroy households of Nazi party members and those Germans who participated in massacres of Poles, * to kill Herman Upitz. Karolkiewicz and his men, supported by a patrol of the National Armed Forces under Antoni Zdunczyk “Olowek” (seven soldiers) crossed the border on August 14, 1943, at 22:00 hours. The date of the attack - August 15, was chosen deliberately, as this is the official day of the Polish Army, to commemorate the Miracle at the Vistula. After reaching Mittenheide, the Poles split into five groups and cut off telephone lines. The attack began before midnight on the solitary Forester's house of Herbert Opitz. Opitz, the Forester of Mittenheide, his wife, 6-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son were killed. The Partisans captured several weapons inside the Forester's Office, a car and a motorcycle. Then they entered the village to attack the Police station, facing tough resistance from the Germans. Within around two hours, some 40 German households were destroyed, 69 civilians and 3 policemen, as well as Upitz, were killed. In contradiction to these numbers, an eyewitness, Irma Bartlick, reports that apart from the Opitz family, 7 additional persons were immediately killed and 4 wounded, of which 2 died later on. In total 13 people lost their lives. Some of the victims were killed by the OST-Arbeiters, who used the raid to take their revenge. The Poles deliberately spared the house of Hildegard Cramer von Laue, a widow, whose husband, an officer of the Wehrmacht, died on the Eastern Front. She was known for her humane attitude towards the Poles and Karolkiewicz himself talked to her that night, explaining the reasons for the attack. The raid ended at 2 a.m., after Karolkiewicz fired a green flare. The Poles escaped to the nearby Pisz Wilderness, together with their booty - a submachine gun, 30 carbines, 14 pistols, a large quantity of ammunition as well as uniforms and boots. Parts of the equipment was later handed to the local units of the Home Army and the National Armed Forces. Also, together with Karolkiewicz’s men, five OST- Arbeiters fled - four Poles and one Lithuanian. Polish losses were minimal. == The aftermath == This raid was a shock to the local community. Its echoes reached Berlin and Heinrich Himmler himself was vividly interested in the investigation, which was carried out by the police authorities from Allenstein. However, nobody was caught and the unit, after hiding for three days in the forest, left East Prussia, heading towards Nowogrodek. On May 3, 2006 Stanislaw Karolkiewicz was promoted to Brigade General, by President Lech Kaczyński.Ministry of Defence, news brief, May 3, 2006 == References See also== * Polish contribution to World War II Category:Poland in World War II Category:Military history of Poland during World War II Category:Military operations involving the Polish resistance during World War II Category:East Prussia Category:Conflicts in 1943 Category:1943 in Germany Mittenheide Category:August 1943 events ","title":"Raid on Mittenheide"},{"id":"19262733","text":"Konterra is an unincorporated area and census-designated place (CDP) in Prince George's County, Maryland, United States.

Homes of British Speedway. ==Brief history== The team was based at The Stadium, in Milton Street, Motherwell, which was used primarily for greyhound racing but was designed with speedway in mind; the bends wide enough for six cars side by side.Henry, J. & Moultray, I. (2001). Speedway in Scotland. The first meeting was held on 14 July 1950 in a challenge match before the Eagles joined the league in 1951. The Eagles started out in the British National League Division Two with veteran ex-Glasgow Tigers Will Lowther and Joe Crowther and ex- Edinburgh rider Danny Lee in the line up. Bill Baird, a pioneer Eagle, became the only rider to ride for all four Scottish teams starting as a Glasgow Tiger before moves to Edinburgh then Ashfield. The team was strengthened late in 1951 by the transfer of Derick Close from Newcastle. In 1952, Eagles rider Derek Close reached the final of the Speedway World Championship. The Eagles operated until the end of the 1954 season and would have run in 1955 but for the reluctance of teams in England to travel up to Scotland. The top man was Derick Close, signed from the Newcastle Diamonds in 1951, and he was supported by Gordon McGregor, an ex- Glasgow Tiger, who was a founder Eagle in 1951. The team also featured Australians Keith Gurtner and Ron Phillips who transferred over when the Ashfield Giants left the League. Due to his never say die approach, the fans favourite was Bluey (Eric) Scott who joined the Eagles in 1951. Popular Australian Noel Watson, one of the earliest Eagles signings in 1950 along with Clive Gressor, was killed in his home country in 1953. Tommy Miller, one of the top Scottish speedway stars of the day, joined the Eagles in 1954 but moved on to the Coventry Bees mid-season. Speedway returned for a short spell in 1958 when Ian Hoskins established the Golden Eagles who featured Doug and Willie Templeton, Gordon Mitchell, Jimmy Tannock, Freddie Greenwell and gave a shale debut to George Hunter. The site was redeveloped and was used briefly in 1971/72 for three long track events and a speedway meeting on a smaller circuit built on the centre green.

The are considered the second generation, and the grandchildren of the Japanese-born immigrants are called , or third generation. ( are Japanese for \\"one, two, three\\"; see Japanese numerals.) ==History== The children of these Japanese-Brazilian (Nipo- brasileiros) immigrants would be called Nisei. Although the earliest organized group of Japanese emigrants left Japan centuries ago, and a later group settled in Mexico in 1897,Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), \\"Japan- Mexico Relations\\"; retrieved 2011-05-17 the four largest populations of Japanese immigrants and their descendants live in Brazil, Canada, Peru, and the United States. ===American Nisei=== Some US Nisei were born after the end of World War II during the baby boom. Most Nisei, however, who were living in the western United States during World War II, were forcibly interned with their parents (Issei) after Executive Order 9066 was promulgated to exclude everyone of Japanese descent from the West Coast areas of California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. It has been argued that some Nisei feel caught in a dilemma between their Nisei parents and other Americans.Miyoshi, Nobu. (1978). \\"Identity Crisis of the Sansei and the Concentration Camp\\", NIMH Grant No. 1 R13 MH25655-01. The Nisei of Hawaii had a somewhat different experience. In the United States, two representative Nisei were Daniel Inouye and Fred Korematsu. Hawaiian-born was one of many young Nisei men who volunteered to fight in the nation's military when restrictions against Japanese-American enlistment were removed in 1943. Inouye later went on to become a U.S. Senator from Hawaii after it achieved statehood. was one of many Japanese-American citizens living on the West Coast who resisted internment during World War II. In 1944, Korematsu lost a U.S. Supreme Court challenge to the wartime internment of Japanese Americans but gained vindication decades later.Lewis, Neil A. \\"President Names 15 for Nation's Top Civilian Honor\\", New York Times. January 9, 1998. The Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States, was awarded to Korematsu in 1998. At the White House award ceremonies, President Bill Clinton explained, \\"In the long history of our country's constant search for justice, some names of ordinary citizens stand for millions of souls. Plessy, Brown, Parks ... to that distinguished list, today we add the name of Fred Korematsu.\\"Goldstein, Richard. Fred Korematsu, 86, Dies; Lost Key Suit on Internment, New York Times. April 1, 2005. The overwhelming majority of Japanese Americans had reacted to the internment by acquiescing to the government's order, hoping to prove their loyalty as Americans. To them, Korematsu's opposition was treacherous to both his country and his community. Across the span of decades, he was seen as a traitor, a test case, an embarrassment and, finally, a hero.Bai, Matt. He Said No to Internment, New York Times. December 25, 2005. ===Brazilian Nisei=== Brazil is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan, estimated to number more than 1.5 million (including those of mixed-race or mixed- ethnicity),MOFA, \\"Japan-Brazil Relations\\"; retrieved 2011-05-17 more than that of the 1.2 million in the United States.US Census, \\"Selected Population Profile in the United States; Japanese alone or in any combination,\\" 2005 ; retrieved 2011-05-17 The Nisei Japanese Brazilians are an important part of the ethnic minority in that South American nation. ===Canadian Nisei=== Within Japanese-Canadian communities across Canada, three distinct subgroups developed, each with different sociocultural referents, generational identity, and wartime experiences.McLellan, Janet. (1999). Many Petals of the Lotus: Five Asian Buddhist Communities in Toronto, p. 36.Ikawa, Fumiko. \\"Reviews: Umi o Watatta Nippon no Mura by Masao Gamo and \\"Steveston Monogatari: Sekai no Naka no Nipponjin\\" by Kazuko Tsurumi, American Anthropologist (US). New Series, Vol. 65, No. 1 (Feb., 1963), pp. 152-156. ===Peruvian Nisei=== Among the approximately 80,000 Peruvians of Japanese descent, the Nisei Japanese Peruvians comprise the largest element. == Cultural profile  Generations === Japanese Americans and Japanese Canadians have special names for each of their generations in North America. These are formed by combining one of the Japanese numbers corresponding to the generation with the Japanese word for generation (sei 世). The Japanese-American and Japanese-Canadian communities have themselves distinguished their members with terms like Issei, Nisei, and Sansei which describe the first, second and third generation of immigrants. The fourth generation is called Yonsei (四世) and the fifth is called Gosei (五世). The Issei, Nisei and Sansei generations reflect distinctly different attitudes to authority, gender, non-Japanese involvement, and religious belief and practice, and other matters.McLellan, p. 59. The age when individuals faced the wartime evacuation and internment is the single, most significant factor which explains these variations in their experiences, attitudes and behaviour patterns. The term Nikkei (日系) was coined by a multinational group of sociologists and encompasses all of the world's Japanese immigrants across generations.\\"What is Nikkei?\\" Japanese American National Museum. The collective memory of the Issei and older Nisei was an image of Meiji Japan from 1870 through 1911, which contrasted sharply with the Japan that newer immigrants had more recently left. These differing attitudes, social values and associations with Japan were often incompatible with each other.McLellan, p. 37. In this context, the significant differences in post-war experiences and opportunities did nothing to mitigate the gaps which separated generational perspectives. {class=\\" \\" ! Generation!!Cohort description - Issei (一世)  The generation of people born in Japan who later immigrated to another country. - Nisei (二世) The generation of people born in North America, Latin America, Australia, Hawaii, or any country outside Japan either to at least one Issei or one non-immigrant Japanese parent. - Sansei (三世) The generation of people born to at least one Nisei parent. - Yonsei (四世)  The generation of people born to at least one Sansei parent. - Gosei (五世)  The generation of people born to at least one Yonsei parent.Ikezoe-Halevi, Jean. \\"Voices of Chicago: Day of Remembrance 2006,\\" Discover Nikkei (US). October 31, 2006. } In North America since the redress victory in 1988, a significant evolutionary change has occurred. The Nisei, their parents and their children are changing the way they look at themselves as individuals of Japanese descent in their respective nations of Canada, the United States and Mexico.McLellan, p. 68. There are currently just over one hundred thousand British Japanese, mostly in London; but unlike other Nikkei terms used centered from Japan to distinguish the distance from Japanese nationality elsewhere in the world, these Britons do not conventionally parse their communities in generational terms as Issei, Nisei, or Sansei.Itoh, p. 7. The second generation of immigrants, born in Canada or the United States to parents _not_ born in Canada or the United States, is called Nisei (二世). The Nisei have become part of the general immigrant experience in the United States and Canada to become part of the greater \\"melting pot\\" of Americans and Canadians. Some Nisei have resisted being absorbed into the majority society, largely because of their tendency to maintain Japanese interpersonal styles of relationships.Miyamoto, S. Frank. \\"Problems of Interpersonal Style among the Nisei,\\" Amerasia Journal. v13 n2 p29-45 (1986-87). Most Nisei were educated in Canadian or American school systems where they were taught Canadian or American national values as national citizens of those countries of individualism and citizenship. When these were taken away in the early 1940s, the Nisei confronted great difficulty in accepting or coming to terms with internment and forced resettlement. Older Nisei tended to identify more closely with the Issei, sharing similar economic and social characteristics. Older Nisei who had been employed in small businesses, in farming, in fishing or in semi-skilled occupations, tended to remain in blue-collar work.McLellan, pp. 36-37. In contrast, the younger Nisei attended university and college and entered various professions and white-collar employment after the war. This sharp division in post-war experiences and opportunities exacerbated the gaps between these Nisei. Aging The kanreki (還暦), a traditional, pre-modern Japanese rite of passage to old age at 60, was sometimes celebrated by the Issei and is now being celebrated by increasing numbers of Nisei. Rituals are enactments of shared meanings, norms, and values; and this Japanese rite of passage highlights a collective response among the Nisei to the conventional dilemmas of growing older.Doi, Mary L. \\"A Transformation of Ritual: The Nisei 60th Birthday.\\" Journal Journal of Cross-Cultural Gerontology. Vol. 6, No. 2 (April, 1991). Aging is affecting the demographics of the Nisei. According to a 2011 columnist in The Rafu Shimpo of Los Angeles, the obituaries showing the number of Japanese Americans in their 80s and 90s — Nisei, in a word — who are passing is staggering\\"Johnson, George Toshio. \\"Into the Next Stage: Japanese American Newspapers: Over and Out?\\" Rafu Shimpo (US). February 17, 2011. ===Languages=== The Japanese-born Issei learned Japanese as their mother tongue, and their success in learning English as a second language was varied. Most Nisei speak Japanese to some extent, learned from Issei parents, Japanese school, and living in a Japanese community or in the internment camps. A majority of English-speaking Nisei have retained knowledge of the Japanese language, at least in its spoken form. Most Sansei speak English as their first language and most marry people of non-Japanese ancestry. ===Education=== An illustrative point-of-view, as revealed in the poetry of an Issei woman: ===Intermarriage=== There was relatively little intermarriage during the Nisei generation, partly because the war and the unconstitutionalSklansky, David (2016-11-18).

Identification of them with the enemy by the American public, made them unpopular and unlikely candidates for interracial marriage. Besides this, they were thrown, en masse, into concentration camps Encyclopaedia Britannica. Concentration camp. Retrieved on 2020-09-06.Lachman, Joseph Shoji (2017-02-20). FDR Called Them Concentration Camps: Why Terminology Matters. Retrieved on 2020-09-06. with others of the same ethnicity, causing the majority of Nisei to marry other Nisei. Another factor is that anti-miscegenation laws criminalizing interracial marriage, cohabitation, and sex were in effect in many U.S. states until 1967. This is why third generation Sansei are mostly still of the same racial appearance as the Issei, who first immigrated to the U.S. The Sansei generation has widely intermarried in the post WWII years, with estimates of such unions at over 60 percent. ==HistoryInternment=== When the Canadian and American governments interned West Coast Japanese citizens, Japanese American citizens, and Japanese Canadian citizens in 1942, neither distinguished between American/Canadian-born citizens of Japanese ancestry (Nisei) and their parents, born in Japan but now living in the U.S. or Canada (Issei).Dinnerstein, Leonard et al. (1999). Ethnic Americans: A History of Immigration, p. 181. === World War II service = Redress === Japanese American redress In 1978, the Japanese American Citizens League actively began demanding be taken as redress for harms endured by Japanese Americans during World War II. In 1980, Congress established the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) The commission report, Personal Justice Denied, condemned the internment as \\"unjust and motivated by racism rather than real military necessity\\".Personal Justice Denied, In 1988, U.S. President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which provided for a formal apology and payments of $20,000 for each survivor. The legislation stated that government actions were based on \\"race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership\\".100th Congress, S. 1009, reproduced at internmentarchives.com]. The Civil Liberties Act Amendments of 1992, appropriating an additional $400 million in order to ensure that all remaining internees received their $20,000 redress payments, was signed into law by President George H. W. Bush, who also issued another formal apology from the U.S. government. Japanese and Japanese Americans who were relocated during WWII were compensated for direct property losses in 1948. These payments were awarded to 82,210 Japanese Americans or their heirs at a cost of $1.6 billion; the program's final disbursement occurred in 1999.DemocracyNow: WWII Reparations: Japanese-American Internees Japanese Canadian redress In 1983, the National Association of Japanese Canadians (NAJC) mounted a campaign demanding redress for injustices during the war years.Establishing Recognition of Past Injustices: Uses of Archival Records in Documenting the Experience of Japanese Canadians During the Second World War. Roberts-Moore, Judith. Archivaria: The Journal of the Association of Canadian Archivists, 53 (2002). NAJC hired Price Waterhouse to estimate the economic losses to Japanese Canadians resulting from property confiscations and loss of wages due to internment. On the basis of detailed records maintained by the Custodian of Alien Property,Order-in-Council, P.C. 1665: Yesaki, Mitsuo. (2003). Sutebusuton: A Japanese Village on the British Columbia Coast, p. 111. it was determined that the total loss totalled $443 million (in 1986 dollars). In 1988, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney gave that long-awaited formal apology and the Canadian government began to make good on a compensation package—including $21,000 to all surviving internees, and the re-instatement of Canadian citizenship to those who were deported to Japan.Apology and compensation, CBC Archives ===Life=Politics Notable individuals == The number of nisei who have earned some degree of public recognition has continued to increase over time; but the quiet lives of those whose names are known only to family and friends are no less important in understanding the broader narrative of the nikkei. Although the names highlighted here are over- represented by issei from North America, the Latin American member countries of the Pan American Nikkei Association (PANA) include Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay, in addition to the English-speaking United States and Canada.National Association of Japanese Canadians: PANA * John Fujio Aiso (1909–1987), an American military leader, lawyer, and judgeDiscoverNikkei: Aiso bio; retrieved 2011-05-17 *Karl Yoneda (1906-1999), Communist labor activist * Minoru Yamasaki (1912–1986), architect best known for the New York World Trade Center \\"Twin Towers\\" * Barney F.

A retired school principal of Inver National School, she has been jailed on a number of occasions for her involvement in Shell to Sea protests. ==Campaign work== Harrington has previously been involved in fundraising for the British Miners' Strike, as well as campaigning against the Maastricht Treaty. On 12 October 2006, Harrington sustained head and neck injuries while Gardaí cleared demonstrators blocking an access road used by Shell workers on the Corrib gas project. Harrington has described herself as a Marxist. On 9 September 2008, she began a hunger strike in protest at the arrival of the Solitaire, an Allseas pipe- laying ship assisting Royal Dutch Shell. The strike took place at the gates of the Shell compound in Glengad in Erris, in her car. It ended after the ship left Ireland for repairs. She appeared in Belmullet District Court on 8 October 2008 accused of a public order offence related to a protest when President Mary McAleese attended the official opening of a civic centre in Belmullet in April 2007. In March 2009, she was found guilty of this charge. She was also found guilty of assaulting a Garda during a fracas which saw several protesters injured.The Irish Times, 16 June 2007. For this, she was given a sentence of 28 days imprisonment, fined and bound to keep the peace for 12 months, though she opted not to pay the fine or sign the bond. The judge in the case, Mary Devins, wife of the Fianna Fáil TD Jimmy Devins, also directed Harrington to receive a psychiatric assessment due to what she described as her \\"bizarre\\" behaviour an order which received criticism, with Senator David Norris comparing the decision to the tactics used in Stalinist dictatorships in Eastern Europe where political dissidents were portrayed as mentally ill. Harrington denied both charges, and did not give evidence in protest after Judge Devins refused to allow video evidence of the incident to be shown. She served her sentence in Dublin's Mountjoy Prison. Protests and other events took place outside the prison in solidarity, as well as at the offices of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. On 6 April 2009, Harrington was due to speak at an event in London organised by Amnesty International to highlight the forthcoming Wiwa family lawsuits against Royal Dutch Shell, but was unable to because of her imprisonment. In July 2009, Harrington was jailed for four months for public order offences relating to demonstrations, a sentence which was appealed. In February 2010, Judge Raymond Groarke accused Harrington of being like a member of \\"the secret police\\" following a period when the local area saw an influx of many Integrated Risk Management Services guards. In December of 2018 Maura Harrington was a speaker at a protest held in Strokestown, County Roscommon, where roughly 1,000 people gathered to protest against the eviction of a family from their home. Video footage of the eviction had gone viral in Ireland and lead to much criticism after it depicted security contractors from Northern Ireland removing the family by force. Subsequently the security contractors were attacked at a second location, leading to multiple arrests. It was reported that Harrington instructed the crowd to operate in secret, but not to do anything for which they could be arrested for and \\"to take care no one be killed\\". ==References * Profile in Village magazine * Article in The Guardian * Category:1953 births Category:Corrib gas controversy Category:Irish Marxists Category:Irish activists Category:Irish environmentalists Category:Irish schoolteachers Category:Irish women activists Category:Irish women environmentalists Category:Living people Category:People from County Mayo Category:Prisoners and detainees of the Republic of Ireland ","title":"Maura Harrington"},{"id":"19262891","text":"SpinSpotter was an online service, developed by Seattle-based SpinSpotter Inc., designed to surface specific instances of bias and inaccuracy in any news story online. The service focused mainly on these major news outlets: CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, The New York Times and Yahoo! News. Users of the service installed a browser toolbar called Spinoculars, which allowed them to see, share, and edit the spin out of any news story. When users noticed a subtle or egregious instance of spin, they would highlight the text within the news article, creating a \\"Spin Marker\\", and chose an appropriate \\"Rule of Spin\\" from a drop-down menu. The Seven Deadly Spins were: Reporter's Voice, Inaccurate Information, Passive Voice, Biased Source, Disregarded Context, Selective Disclosure, and Lack of Balance. Users were able to interact in several ways including: adding a description to someone else's Spin Marker, joining a discussion on a Spin Marker, and voting on the significance of spin within a Spin Marker. Based on those votes, users then established a trust level within the community. Votes with a higher impact came from a panel of journalism students and media professionals called \\"Referees\\". The service launched in beta form on September 8, 2008.

The New York Times reported that there appeared to be few phrases in SpinSpotter's database of spin and that the service's algorithm cannot account for context or tone.Claire Cain Miller, Start-Up Attacks Media Bias, One Phrase at a Time, N.Y.

Alonso was the grandson of CMLL founder Salvador Lutteroth and took control of the company in 1987 ==Career== Paco Alonso was the son of the daughter of Salvador Lutteroth, who founded the promotion under the name La Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL). Alonso began working for EMLL in 1975, around the same time as Salvador Lutteroth's son, Salvador Lutteroth Jr. (Chavo Lutteroth II), who took control of the promotion. Over the next five years, Alonso worked in a promotional capacity while Chavo Lutteroth II ran the company. Lutteroth Jr. did not command the same respect as his father, and by 1987, he handed over control and later ownership to Paco Alonso, who had the ability and intelligence to make the company evolve and succeed. Despite being the technical owner of CMLL, his daughter Sofia Alonso is in charge of the company's business-related activities. Alonso was relatively reclusive from the public eye and only gave a few interviews in his time in charge of the promotion. However, it is estimated that he was responsible for cumulatively drawing over 80,000,000 fans throughout his career at CMLL, based on 24 shows a week each with 2,000 attendance. Alonso was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame Class of 2008 with a 73% vote. Along with Martín Karadagian, he was one of only two inductees for the year. Alonso's leadership style was described as \\"hands off\\", normally content to leave the matchmaking to his booking team and staying out of the day-to-day leadership of the promotion. Alonso was also known for holding a grudge against certain wrestlers he felt had betrayed him, having banned both Octagón and Konnan from CMLL forever and even refused to pay tribute to Antonio Peña after his death. There was also a falling out between El Hijo del Santo and CMLL that led Alonso to decree that none of CMLL's working partners were to use El Hijo del Santo on their shows, and when International Wrestling Revolution Group refused Alonso broke off a seven-year working relationship with the promotion. ==Championships and accomplishments== *Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards :*Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame (Class of 2008) ==References== Category:Professional wrestling executives Category:2019 deaths Category:1952 births Category:Professional wrestling promoters Category:People from Mexico City Category:Lucha libre ","title":"Paco Alonso"},{"id":"19262959","text":"Tomás Blanco García (10 November 1910 - 16 July 1990) was a Spanish film actor.

It is derived from the Greek λόγος (logos)—\\"word\\" and from κράτος (kratos)—to \\"govern\\".

Those most adept at this are termed \\"slang- whangers\\", while Congress is a \\"blustering, windy assembly\\".Southern Quarterly Review, Harvard, 1845, pp. 77-78 Mustapha describes how: > \\"unknown to these people themselves, their government is a pure > unadulterated LOGOCRACY or government of words.

In it he \\"stressed that the old mentality would never be overthrown, if the structure of the Russian language was not also transformed and purged.\\" This process led to a Soviet language that George Orwell would later dub \\"neo-language\\", and was a precursor to his Nineteen Eighty-Four Newspeak.Luciano Pellicani, Revolutionary Apocalypse: Ideological Roots of Terrorism, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, pp.234-235 The new Soviet 'language' was less a real language than an 'orthogloxy', a \\"stereotyped jargon consisting of formulas and empty slogans, whose purpose was to prevent people from thinking outside the boundaries of collective thought\\"—i.e. it was speech which destroyed individuality. Janina Frentzel- Zagórska, however, queries the importance of political language in the USSR, saying that \\"the old ideological 'Newspeak' had completely disappeared in the Soviet Union long before\\" the fall of Communism.Janina Frentzel-Zagórska, From a One-party State to Democracy: Transition in Eastern Europe, Rodopi, 1993, p. 46 Totalitarianism, according to political theorist Hannah Arendt, can be considered a logocracy, since in it ideas are no longer important, just how they are expressed.Quoted in: Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, Interchange, SpringerLink, 1992, p. 29 Academic Yahya Michot has referred to Sunni Islam as a \\"popular\\" or \\"laic logocracy\\", in that it is government by the word of the Koran.Quoted in: Paul Culp, Nothing New Under the Sun: An Introduction to Islam, 2007, p. 43 ==See also== *Videocracy *Political correctness ==References== Category:Forms of government ","title":"Logocracy"},{"id":"19262994","text":"Rural scene in Bois-Franc Bois-Franc is a municipality in the La Vallée-de-la- Gatineau Regional County Municipality, Quebec, Canada, north of Maniwaki.

The building was demolished in 1903. It was located northwest of Westminster Abbey on Tothill Street. The building was designed by Alfred Bedborough in a highly ornamental style faced with Portland stone. At the west end of the building was the Aquarium Theatre - in 1879 named the Imperial Theatre. Methodist Central Hall is now located on the site. ==History== The Royal Aquarium opened on 22 January 1876. The board of directors included Henry Labouchère, the financier and journalist; William Whiteley the retailer; and Arthur Sullivan, the composer. It was intended to offer art exhibitions, concerts and plays, among other intellectual entertainments, like The Crystal Palace.The Royal Aquarium, and Imperial Theatre, Victoria London (Arthur Lloyd music and theatre history site) accessed 11 September 2008 The main hall was long by wide. It was covered with a roof of glass and iron and decorated with palm trees, fountains, pieces of original sculpture, thirteen large tanks meant to be filled with curious sea creatures and an orchestra capable of accommodating 400 performers. Around the main hall were rooms for eating, smoking, reading and playing chess, as well as an art gallery, a skating rink and a theatre.McCann, Bill. \\"Central Hall and the Royal Aquarium\\" , Story of London, 23 September 2002 The Aquarium adopted an expensive system of supplying fresh and sea-water from four cisterns, sunk into the foundations. This quickly ran into operating problems. The large tanks for fish contained none and became a standing joke; but the directors did display a dead whale in 1877.The Illustrated London News 6 October 1977 By the 1890s, the Aquarium was acquiring a risqué reputation, with unaccompanied ladies promenading through the hall in search of male companionship.Mander and Mitchenson, p. 213 Emily Turner, a visitor from Montreal, worked as a salesgirl at the Aquarium between October 1891 and January 1892. She met a Major Hamilton there, who bought her supper at Gatti's (in the Strand) and took her to entertainments at the Alhambra Theatre, promising to set her up in rooms in Lambeth. The major disappeared after providing her with 'gelatin capsules' for a cough. The pills made her ill, and she stopped taking them. The leftover pills were passed to Scotland Yard, and she was traced by Inspector Jarvis of the Metropolitan police, who identified the missing major as the serial killer, Thomas Neill Cream. The pills were eventually analysed and found to contain only quinine. Turner refused to identify Cream for fear of having to appear at the trial - and have her own respectability questioned.McLaren, pp. 133-4 The building, known as \\"the Tank,\\" lost its popularity and was sold to the Wesleyan Methodist Church in 1903. The Methodist Central Hall was built on the site in 1911. ==Entertainments at the Aquarium== Sheet music cover for Lounging in the Aq. (1880), illustrated by A. Concanen After its opening, the expensive Aquarium and its programme of art exhibits and classical music were indifferently received by the public, and the venture was failing. Soon, instead of scientific lectures and the high-minded entertainments intended for the hall by its founders, the directors turned to more profitable music hall and variety acts (animal acts, African dancers, hypnotists, etc.) The Aquarium became most famous for offering dangerous and sensational circus and other acts. The showman and tightrope walker The Great Farini programmed many of these beginning in 1877. One of the most famous was the young female human cannonball, Zazel, who was launched by an apparatus of Farini's design. The perceived danger of these acts caused protests and put the venue's licence in doubt but drew crowds.Peacock, Shane. \\"Chapter 3, Africa Meets the Great Farini,\\" Africans on Stage: Studies in Ethnological Business Bernth Lindfors (ed.), Indiana University Press 1999 In 1880, George Leybourne popularised a song about the Aquarium that parodied Alfred Vance's song \\"Walking in the Zoo\\": :Lounging in the Aq., :That against all other modes :Of killing time I'll back. :Fun that's never slack, :Eyes brown, blue, and black :Make one feel in Paradise :While lounging in the Aq. The all-day variety entertainments at the Aquarium turned less respectable, including billiards matches, novelty acts and side-shows of all kinds, and commercial stalls offering perfumery and gloves. George Robey made his first professional appearance at the Aquarium in 1891. Located across the street from the Houses of Parliament, the Aquarium was popular with members of the House of Commons. The comedian Arthur Roberts also sang a song about the Aquarium: :I strolled one day to Westminster, :The Royal Aquarium to see; :But I had to stand a bottle :just to lubricate the throttle :Of a lady who was forty-three. Score of The Rink Gallop\\" as performed inside the Aquarium, c. 1876 ==Theatre== The Aquarium Theatre at the west end of the Royal Aquarium opened on 15 April 1876. The theatre was also designed by Bedborough and was built by Messrs. Lucas with a capacity of 1,293. Henry Jones (1822-1900) built an unusually large and powerful Grand Organ for the Royal Aquarium under the supervision of Sullivan. The organ was installed at the rear of the main stage in 1876 at the opening of the Hall. In 1878, however, it was moved from the stage to a position up in the gallery.Kearl, Chris. \\"The Grand Organ in The Royal Aquarium\\", 2008, ArthurLloyd.co.uk Drawing of the Imperial Theatre The School for Scandal played at the theatre in 1877, as did a revival of W.

Citation was by Bull Lea, the foundation sire of Calumet Farm. Silver Spoon's dam, Silver Fog, carried the blood of Equipose, Blenheim, Man o' War, Broomstick, Peter Pan, and a host of others. Silver Spoon was a big chestnut filly with four white stockings, standing 16 hands one inch tall, and weighing 1,135 pounds. As a foal, she injured her hip and forever after walked with a pronounced hesitation or \\"hitch\\" in her gait. ==Racing career== Her first race was an $8,000 claiming event for two-year- olds at Belmont Park. There were no takers. Ridden by Eldon Nelson, she won by six lengths. Sent to California, Silver Spoon dominated her division, going undefeated in a six-race winning streak. Winning both the Santa Susana Stakes now called the Santa Anita Oaks and the Santa Anita Derby, she became one of only two fillies ever to do so. The other was the winner of the 1988 Kentucky Derby: Winning Colors. In the Santa Anita Derby, she took the race against colts. With her ears pricked, she romped home by two and a half lengths against that year's eventual Preakness Stakes winner, Royal Orbit. This was the win that convinced her connections to enter her in the 1959 Kentucky Derby. The only filly to start in the race between the years 1945 to 1980, she came in a respectable fifth, three and a half lengths behind the winner, Tomy Lee. A few months later, back on the West Coast, she soundly beat Tomy Lee in the Cinema Handicap. In the Cinema, she conceded 9 pounds to the runner-up. In the press, Silver Spoon was hailed as the best filly since the war. ==Honors== In the 1959 voting for Champion three-old-filly, the Thoroughbred Racing Association voted for Silver Spoon, but in the rival Daily Racing Form poll she was beaten by 85 points to 73 by Royal Native.

The term consists of the two words; ge, meaning \\"a crab\\", and jang which means \\"condiment\\" in Korean. Although gejang originally referred only to crabs marinated in soy sauce, it has begun to be called \\"ganjang gejang\\" these days to differentiate it from yangnyeom-gejang (양념게장). The latter is a relatively new dish that emerged since the restaurant industry began to thrive in South Korea. \\"Yangnyeom\\" literally means \\"seasoning\\" or \\"seasoned\\" in Korean but refers to the spicy sauce made with chili pepper powder. Gyeongsang, Jeolla, and Jeju Island are famous for their own characteristic gejang. It is a representative speciality of Yeosu in South Jeolla Province, and a traditional Jeolla cuisine dish. According to a poll of tourists to Korea, gejang is difficult to eat because the dish is too hot and salty. ==Historical records== Historical records on gejang can be found in books such as Sallim gyeongje (lit. \\"Farm Management\\"),산림경제(山林經濟), Sallim gyeongje The Academy of Korean Studies Gyuhap chongseo (lit. \\"Women's Encyclopedia\\"), Jubangmun (주방문, 酒方文, lit. \\"Book of Making Alcoholic beverage\\"), Siui jeonseo (lit. \\"Complete Collection of Corrections and Discussions\\") and others written during the Joseon Dynasty of Korea (1392 - 1910). According to Sallim gyeongje written around the end of the 17th century, making gejang is referred to as \\"johaebeop\\" (조해법, 糟蟹法), which means \\"a way of marinating crabs in sediments of liquor\\". With the method, crabs are marinated in a mixture of jaegang (재강, sediments of liquor), salt, and an alcoholic beverage. In general, gejang spoils if preserved for a long time; however, the gejang made by the johaebeop can be even eaten until the next spring. In addition, the book records various ways of making gejang such as juhaebeop (酒蟹法, made with alcoholic beverage), chojang haebeop (醋醬蟹法, made with soy sauce and vinegar), yeomtang haebeop (鹽湯蟹法, made with boiled salted water) as well as methods of rearing crabs are called Yukseon chibeop (肉膳治法). Therefore, the record verifies that the consumption of gejang in Korean diet appeared at least as early as the 17th century. ==Crabs and harvest== crab bundles at a market in Daejeon. According to Korean traditional medicine, crab has a cold nature that could cool one's body temperature, so gejang is believed to be good for driving away the spring fever. Although gejang was originally made with freshwater crabs in general, such crabs are becoming scarce, so the gejang made with kkotge (horse crab) caught in the Yellow Sea (West Sea), the west side of Korean peninsula, has become prevalent. Among gejang made with freshwater crabs, chamgejang of North Gyeongsang Province, which can be preserved and eaten after one year passes and beotteok gejang, which can be eaten immediately after preparation, are the most famous.Seo Jeong-bo (서정보) (March 19, 1999) (in Korean) 여기가 맛집 - 간장게장요리 고양시 「예원」 The Dong-a Ilbo ==Preparation== To prepare ganjang gejang, crabs are first thoroughly cleaned using a brush while submerged in a bowl of water, and are then rinsed to remove the moisture. The crabs are put in a hangari (earthenware crock) and are salted for about six hours. To prepare the sauce, a mixture of ganjang is boiled briefly along with sesame oil, sugar, finely sliced scallions, minced garlic, ginger, and finely shredded fresh red chili pepper. Once the salted crabs are removed from the hangari and placed in a suitable bowl, the hot sauce is poured onto the crabs. An hour later, the ganjang is removed from the bowl and reheated until boiling. It is again poured over the crabs, and the procedure is repeated for a third and fourth time. The dish can be eaten once the sauce is chilled. If using boiled ganjang after it has been chilled, the gejang can be eaten two weeks after preparation, and it can be preserved for longer. A variation involves adding minced beef while the sauce is poured over the crabs, endowing the gejang with more spices. In recent days, some people add lemon, chili pepper, or traditional medicine when making gejang in order to remove the fishy smell and to increase its rich flavor.Han Nam-hui (한남희), (Feb. 17, 2006) (in Korean) 바람난 바다 봄을 부르다. (The Windy Sea calls in Spring) Chungcheong Today As for yangnyeom gejang, the dish is made with raw crabs and a spicy and sweet sauce of chili pepper powder, and ground Korean pear, onions, ginger and garlic, as well as whole sesame seeds, and sesame oil. In general, the gejang can be eaten a half day after the preparation and consuming the dish within two or three days is best to have its intact spicy and sweet and sour taste. If crabs are first marinated in a boiled and chilled mixture of eakjeok (액젓, filtered jeotgal) and soy sauce before mixing the spicy sauce, the yangnyeom gejang can be well marinated with the latter sauce, and can be preserved longer. ==Types== Served ready to eat the tomalley and roe of Gejang Types are divided by crab species, region, and cooking method. Among varieties, beoltteok gejang (벌떡게장) is a local specialty of Jeolla Province and is made with live Charybdis, which are called either beoltteokge (벌떡게) or minkkotge (민꽃게) in Korean. The crab has a hard carapace with a reddish-brown color and is found in the seawater of Korea according to Jasaneobo (자산어보 \\"Fishes of the Huksan Island\\"),Kim, Ik-Soo, (2004) Fish Collections, Fish Diversity, and Ichthyological Research in Korea(Part One Collection Building National Science Museum monographs, v.24 pp.115-121, the first Korean fisheries science book written by the scholar Jeong Yak-jeon (정약전) in 1814. To make the gejang, the crabs are cut into several pieces or used whole if they are not large. One or two days after the beoltteokge have been marinated in a ganjang-based sauce, one can enjoy the gejang which has a fresh and sweet taste. However, beoltteok gejang can not be preserved for a long time, so it is said that the name reflects the fact; beotteok means \\"quickly\\" or \\"immediately\\" in Korean. Kkotgejang (꽃게장) is made with kkotge (horse crab), which is the most consumed crab in South Korea. It is also a local specialty of Jeolla Province, and the dish is known for the umami taste. After cleaned, the live crabs are chopped into several pieces, and a mixture of ganjang, sliced scallions, garlic, ginger, chili pepper powder, sesame seeds, salted is poured over them. It can be eaten one day after preparation. Another local speciality of Jeolla Province is konggejeot (콩게젓) which is indigenous to Gangjin County. The gejeng is made by grinding crabs as small as a bean (kong in Korean) with millstones. The thick ground paste is mixed with salt and gochujang. In Jeju Island, gejang is called gingijeot (깅이젓) made on every fifteenth of March in the lunar calendar at low tide. It is traditionally said that gingijeot is good to cure every illness in the region. Yangnyeom gejang Chamgejang (참게장) is a local specialty of Gyeonggi Province and is made with chamge (Chinese mitten crab) which generally live in the rivers of Korea which flow to the Yellow Sea. Chamge harvested in the Imjin River near the Paju region is especially famous for its unique taste and having a less earthy smell, so for many centuries the crabs were presented to the King of Korea as a delicacy. As demonstrated by the fact that records on chamge can be found in several historical documents regarding fisheries and cuisine such as Jasaneobo, Gyuhap chongseo (Women's Encyclopedia), and the chapter Jeoneoji (전어지) of Imwon gyeongjeji (임원경제지), the dish has been eaten by Koreans for a long time. However, these days pollution in the rivers has decreased the crab's habitat, so chamge is barely found except in Imjin River. Chamgejang is commonly nicknamed \\"bapdoduk' (밥도둑, literally \\"a meal thief\\" or \\"a rice thief\\") because it is considered a good dish for arousing one's appetite. The dish is intended to preserve for long periods, so the gejang is saltier than other varieties. Ganjang gejang Chamgejang is also widely eaten in Gyeongsang Province, and is prepared at every house during autumn to make a banchan (small side dish) for the next summer. The crabs are also caught in rice fields during the harvest season, and female crabs are considered the best because they contain a lot of roe and fatty tomalley. ==Serving== Yeosu is famous for gejang as well as gat kimchi (갓김치). A meal emphasizing ganjang gejang is called gejang baekban (게장백반) that consists of a plate ganjang gejang, various plates of banchan (side dishes), and a bowl of cooked rice.Kim Gang-suk (김강숙) (in Korean) 해외 여행이 지겨워진 당신을 위한 국내코스 - 테마여행 (Themed tour - Domestic courses for those who are bored of aboard travel) Joins ==See also== *Jeotgal, salted fermented seafood *Jangajji, salted pickled vegetables *Banchan, small side dishes *Korean cuisine * List of crab dishes * List of seafood dishes ==References * 군산 계곡가든 꽃게장 at The Hankyoreh * 참을 수 없는 꽃게장의 유혹 at Hankook Ilbo * Recipe at Patzzi * Yangnyeom gejang recipe at Patzzi Category:Jeotgal Category:Crab dishes Category:Korean cuisine Category:Animal-based fermented foods ","title":"Gejang"},{"id":"19263052","text":"Robert Dunne (1830–1917) was an Irish archbishop.

The technique is recognised to be unreliable and is only used when specific metadata, such as a HTTP header is either not available, or is assumed to be untrustworthy. This algorithm usually involves statistical analysis of byte patterns, like frequency distribution of trigraphs of various languages encoded in each code page that will be detected; such statistical analysis can also be used to perform language detection. This process is not foolproof because it depends on statistical data. In general, incorrect charset detection leads to mojibake. One of the few cases where charset detection works reliably is detecting UTF-8. This is due to the large percentage of invalid byte sequences in UTF-8, so that text in any other encoding that uses bytes with the high bit set is extremely unlikely to pass a UTF-8 validity test. However, badly written charset detection routines do not run the reliable UTF-8 test first, and may decide that UTF-8 is some other encoding. For example, it was common that web sites in UTF-8 containing the name of the German city München were shown as MÃ¼nchen, due to the code deciding it was an ISO-8859 encoding before even testing to see if it was UTF-8. UTF-16 is fairly reliable to detect due to the high number of newlines (U+000A) and spaces (U+0020) that should be found when dividing the data into 16-bit words, and large numbers of NUL bytes all at even or odd locations. Common characters must be checked for, relying on a test to see that the text is valid UTF-16 fails: the Windows operating system would mis-detect the phrase \\"Bush hid the facts\\" (without a newline) in ASCII as Chinese UTF-16LE, since all the bytes for assigned Unicode characters in UTF-16. Charset detection is particularly unreliable in Europe, in an environment of mixed ISO-8859 encodings. These are closely related eight-bit encodings that share an overlap in their lower half with ASCII and all arrangements of bytes are valid. There is no technical way to tell these encodings apart and recognising them relies on identifying language features, such as letter frequencies or spellings. Due to the unreliability of heuristic detection, it is better to properly label datasets with the correct encoding. HTML documents served across the web by HTTP should have their encoding stated out-of-band using the header. Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8 An isolated HTML document, such as one being edited as a file on disk, may imply such a header by a meta tag within the file: or with a new meta type in HTML5 If the document is Unicode, then some UTF encodings explicitly label the document with an embedded initial byte order mark (BOM). == See also == * International Components for Unicode - A library that can perform charset detection. * Language identification * Content sniffing * Browser sniffing, a similar heuristic technique for determining the capabilities of a web browser, before serving content to it. == References  External links == * IMultiLanguage2::DetectInputCodepage * API reference for ICU charset detection * Reference for cpdetector charset detection * Mozilla Charset Detectors * Java port of Mozilla Charset Detectors * Delphi/Pascal port of Mozilla Charset Detectors * uchardet, C++ fork of Mozilla Charset Detectors; includes Bash command-line tool * C# port of Mozilla Charset Detectors * HEBCI, a technique for detecting the character set used in form submissions * Frequency distributions of English trigraphs Category:Character encoding ","title":"Charset detection"},{"id":"19263119","text":"The Governor of San Cristóbal is the civil representative of the President of the Republic in San Cristóbal Province, who designated it.

Each has a distinct basis for the claim: North Carolina being the first to hold classes and graduate students, Georgia being the first created by state charter, and William & Mary having the oldest founding date of any currently public university, though it was private for over 200 years and completely closed for a period after the Civil War. == University of Georgia == Located in Athens, Georgia, the University of Georgia received its charter from the state in 1785, making the University of Georgia the first state-chartered public university in the United States. As a result of this distinction UGA brands itself as the \\"birthplace of the American system of higher education.\\" A site was selected for the university, but it did not begin admitting students until 1801, six years after the University of North Carolina. The first graduation was held in 1804. The first building was completed in 1805. == University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill == The North Carolina Constitution of 1776 provided that “learning . . . be duly encouraged, and promoted, in one or more universities” . The legislature chartered the University of North Carolina in 1789, and construction on the campus in Chapel Hill began in 1793. The university became the first public institution of higher learning in the U.S. to open its doors in 1795 when it completed construction on its first building, Old East, and admitted its first students. Graduating its first class in 1798, UNC was the only public institution to confer degrees in the 18th century. == College of William & Mary == Now a public university, College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, was founded by royal charter in 1693, making it the second oldest college or university in the United States, after Harvard University. The college severed formal ties with Britain after the colonies declared independence, but remained a private institution until financial troubles forced its closure after the Civil War. It re-opened in 1888, but did not become public until continued financial troubles forced it to accept funding from the Commonwealth of Virginia beginning in 1906. == See also == * First university in the United States == References == __notoc__ Category:History of universities and colleges in the United States * ","title":"Oldest public university in the United States"},{"id":"19263179","text":"John Slingsby (born 21 June 1788 at New Windsor, Berkshire; died 2 September 1826 at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire) was an English amateur cricketer. ==Career== Slingsby was not attached to any particular club.

It is generally credited with creating the \\"zouk bass\\" and \\"progressive kuduro\\" variant and has received an MTV European Music Award. In 2015 Buraka Som Sistema said they would be taking an hiatus starting in 2016, and on July 1st 2016 they performed live for the last time in Lisbon. ==Origins== Buraka Som Sistema was founded in 2002 by Branko (João Barbosa), Rui Pité (DJ Riot), Andro Carvalho (Conductor) and Kalaf Ângelo. Barbosa and Pité were producers from the Cool Train Crew collective, for which Kalaf was a frequent vocal collaborator. They were interested in creating a kuduro project, and had previously worked together as 1-UIK Project. They met Carvalho, a hip-hop producer from Angola and member of the hip-hop band Conjunto Ngonguenha, while he was in Portugal. Buraka Som Sistema is the Portuguese word for word translation for Buraka Sound System, keeping the English word order (the correct translation would be \\"Sistema de Som da Buraka\\"). They took their name, Buraka, from the freguesia (urban district) of Buraca in the city of Amadora, in the suburbs of Lisbon. ==Career== Their first release was From Buraka to the World, an EP released on the Portuguese label Enchufada, which include the single \\"Yah!\\", featuring vocals by Angolan hip-hop MC Petty. It was followed by another Petty vocalized track, \\"Wawaba\\", and a re-release of From Buraka to the World, expanded to a full album. After touring in several European countries, including playing at the Glastonbury Festival and Roskilde Festival, the three producers released \\"Sound of Kuduro\\" in 2007, which features rapping by M.I.A., DJ Znobia, Saborosa and Puto Prata. The track was a precursor to their second album, Black Diamond, which was released in 2008 by Sony BMG, followed by a new single, \\"Kalemba (Wegue Wegue)\\", with vocals by Pongolove. They are currently signed on to Aftercluv Dance Lab, a Latin EDM label launched by Universal Music. On July 1st 2016 Buraka Som sistema curated Globaile, a music event at the Torre de Belém grounds, as part of the Festas de Lisboa, where they performed their last concert. ==Usage in media== Their song was featured in EA Sports video game such as \\"Kalemba (Wegue-Wegue)\\" featuring Pongolove in FIFA 10 and \\"Restless\\" in 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa. \\"Hangover (Ba Ba Ba)\\" is also featured in the video game Just Dance 2016. ==DiscographyStudio Albums=== {  - ! width=\\"20\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"Year ! width=\\"150\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"Album ! colspan=\\"3\\"Chart positions ! width=\\"100\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"Sales ! width=\\"100\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"Certifications (sales thresholds) - !style=\\"width:4em;font-size:70%\\" POR !style=\\"width:4em;font-size:70%\\" SPA !style=\\"width:4em;font-size:70%\\" BEL - 2006 From Buraka to the World align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"—  * POR:-  * AFP: - - 2008 Black Diamond align=\\"center\\"7 align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"54   * AFP:Gold - 2011 Komba align=\\"center\\"4 align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"—   * AFP:- - 2014 Buraka align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— - } ===Singles=== {  - bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\" ! bgcolor=\\"lightsteelblue\\" width=\\"25\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Year ! bgcolor=\\"lightsteelblue\\" width=\\"170\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Title ! bgcolor=\\"lightsteelblue\\" colspan=\\"3\\" Chart Positions ! bgcolor=\\"lightsteelblue\\" width=\\"100\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Album - bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\" ! bgcolor=\\"#e2e2e2\\" width=\\"40\\" SPA ! bgcolor=\\"#e2e2e2\\" width=\\"40\\" BEL ! bgcolor=\\"#e2e2e2\\" width=\\"40\\" EUR -  rowspan=\\"2\\"2007  \\"Yah\\"  align=\\"center\\" -  align=\\"center\\" -  align=\\"center\\" - rowspan=5Black Diamond - bgcolor=\\"#f0f0ff\\"  \\"Wawaba (v. 1.8)\\"  align=\\"center\\" -  align=\\"center\\" -  align=\\"center\\" - -  rowspan=\\"2\\"2008  \\"Sound of Kuduro\\" featuring DJ Znobia, M.I.A.  align=\\"center\\" -  align=\\"center\\" -  align=\\"center\\" - - bgcolor=\\"#f0f0ff\\"  \\"Kalemba (Wegue-Wegue)\\"  align=\\"center\\" 1  align=\\"center\\" -  align=\\"center\\" 87 -  rowspan=\\"1\\"2009  \\"Aqui Para Vocês (feat.

Wray's roles grew increasingly smaller as the decade progressed but he was very visible as the starving farmer threatening to kill Gary Cooper's Longfellow Deeds in Frank Capra's classic Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936) and as the warden in Fritz Lang's You Only Live Once (1937). ==Partial filmography== * New York Nights (1929) - Joe Prividi * All Quiet On The Western Front (1930) - Himmelstoss * The Czar of Broadway (1930) - Morton Bradstreet * Quick Millions (1931) - Kenneth Stone * Silence (1931) - Harry Silvers * Safe in Hell (1931) - Egan * The Woman from Monte Carlo (1932) - Cmdr.
