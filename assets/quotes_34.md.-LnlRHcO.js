Quartett in B-dur f√ºr Klarinette, Violine, Viola und Violoncello. 1st ed. Vol. 1. Winterthur: Amadeus Verlag, 2005. 3. G√∂pfert composed in several genres, including symphonies, concerti, wind ensembles, sonatas, and songs. Carl Andreas G√∂pfert, in his lifetime salaried Chamber Musician to the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, excellent virtuoso on the clarinet and admirable composer, was born on 16 January 1768 in Rimpar near W√ºrzburg, the son of a surgical officer. Initially taught singing, piano and organ by the local schoolmaster, his preference for the clarinet led him in 1780 to the celebrated W√ºrzburg clarinet virtuoso Philipp Meissner, who may also have taught him the rudiments of composition. G√∂pfert's rapidly acquired phenomenal skill on the clarinet led to his being engaged as first clarinettist of the Meiningen court orchestra at the age of 20. As his gentle character prevented him from insisting, he had less and less opportunity to become known further afield as a virtuoso, which would certainly have brought him as much acclaim as did his very popular compositions. He received a golden medal for dedicating a Fantasia militare for wind band to King Wilhelm III. In 1788 G√∂pfert moved to Vienna.P√§uler, Bernhard, and G√∂pfert, Carl, Andreas. Quartett in B-dur F√ºr Klarinette, Violine, Viola Und Violoncello. 1st ed. Vol. 1. Winterthur: Amadeus Verlag, 2005. 3. While in Vienna, he studied music theory and composition with Mozart for about a year and a half. In 1793 he became first clarinet with the orchestra in the Meiningen Court Orchestra and later took charge of court military music as well. He obtained a leave of absence in 1798 to establish himself as a soloist in Vienna; however this was cancelled and he was forced to return to Meiningen where the post of Kapellmeister failed to materialize. G√∂pfert tried at least twice to acquire a better post. The first involved his sending a large number of works to France; these were dedicated to the French army and Napoleon as First Consul (post mid-1800-1804). This set of pieces describes him as first clarinet in the Kapelle and director of the music for the Graf's Hunting Corps. In 1817 he applied for a post at Oettingen-Wallerstein and it is his letter to them which contains the remarks about studying with Mozart and arranging his works for Harmoniemusik.G√∂pfert, Carl, Andreas, and Glenn, Nessa. Fifteen Dances by Carl Andreas G√∂pfert. London: Sarastro Press, 2004. 3. G√∂pfert writes: \\"As I have been studying with the greatest fervor for some twenty years, and also for a year and a half had instruction from Mozart in the advanced study of music theory. I have always preferred those instruments in the wind ensembles, and therefore my esteemed teacher, Mozart, gave to me all of the scores of his operas, instructing me to arrange them for wind band.\\"Hoeprich, Eric. The Clarinet. New Haven [Conn.: Yale University Press, 2008. 349. Honoured as a lovable, upright person, G√∂pfert died in Meiningen on 11 April 1818. G√∂pfert's compositional output, valued and much played during his lifetime, now mostly slumbers in archives.P√§uler, Bernhard, and G√∂pfert, Carl, Andreas. Quartett in B-dur F√ºr Klarinette, Violine, Viola Und Violoncello. 1st ed. Vol. 1. Winterthur: Amadeus Verlag, 2005. 3. G√∂pfert was an excellent composer and arranger and he may very well have been the house arranger for Simrock in Bonn. This may explain his arrangements of Mozart's vocal works since Simrock published the originals between 1798 and 1800. He also prepared an octet version of Mozart's Gran Partita, and arranged marches, the Paris Symphony (K. 297) and the Rondo alla Turca from the piano sonata K. 331. His arrangement of Haydn's Creation from 1817 remains lost, as do most of his works for clarinet. Unpublished works include three symphonies, an oboe concerto, a trumpet concerto, a double concerto for two bassoons, a Concertante for clarinet, bassoon and orchestra, piano pieces, songs, guitar pieces and a wealth of sonorous wind band pieces.G√∂pfert, Carl, Andreas, and Glenn, Nessa.

(alt= Kourotrophos (, \\"child nurturer\\") is the name that was given in ancient Greece to gods and goddesses whose properties included their ability to protect young people. Numerous gods are referred to by the epithet, including, but not limited to, Athena, Apollo, Hermes, Hecate, Aphrodite, Artemis, and Eileithyia. They were usually depicted holding an infant in their arms.Lampsas Giannis, Dictionary of the Ancient World (Lexiko tou Archaiou Kosmou), Vol. III, Athens, Domi Publications, 1984, p. 247. Deianeria and Ariadne were occasional shown on vases with their children, Hyllus and Staphylos and Oenopion respectively, however, there is not evidence that there was a cult around them as kourotrophic figures. Kourotrophos was a deity of the city of Athens, who was not among the major Olympian deities. She appeared as the protector of children and young people and a sanctuary built on her name in honor of the cult, the so-called Kourotropheion. Kourotrophos was a major figure of cult, appearing in sacrifice groups connected with fertility and child care.Oxford Reference. Kourotrophos is similar to the Dea Gravida, which are figures representing either a goddesses or woman who is visibly pregnant. == Votive figures == A terracotta Cypriot kourotrophos depicting a bird faced deity, circa 1450-1200 B.C.E. (alt= The term kourotrophos (plural kourotrophoi) or the verb kourotrophic is used to describe female figurines depicted with infants, which may depict either mortal women or divinities. These figures have been considered as symbols of fertility. Cyprus was notable for its production of plank figure Kourotrophos during the Early Cypriot III to the Middle Cypriot I periods (approximately 2000-1800 B.C.E.). Most kourotrophoi from this era stand 20 to 30 cm tall and were fashioned in a variety of materials, such as limestone and terracotta. They hold infants, who are typically within cradleboards, to their left shoulder. There have been at least two Cypriot figures from this period that shown the figure nursing an infant, and two figures that are depicted sitting with the infant on their laps. Currently, all kourotrophic figures where the location of artifact was found is known have been found in tombs, however, this does not mean they were exclusively used to represent death/afterlife, as most figures do not have data on where they were found. Additionally, in general, plank figures, not exclusively kourotrophoi, have been associated with less than 10% of all Bronze Age burials and some show indications, such as repairs, that they were used in daily life. There is evidence that cradle-boarding was used on Cyprus during the Bronze Age, with signs of incidental skull shaping occurring in the Early and Middle Bronze Age and deliberate skull shaping during the Late Bronze Age, aligning with the time period for these figures depicting cradle- boarded infants. Maternal figurines waned in popularity on Cyprus during the Late Bronze despite being a uniquely popular subject in comparison to other surrounding cultures since the Neolithic Age, as contact with the foreign cultures led to cultural shifts. It may be argued that the importance of women as life givers decreased during this time period. The creation of kourotrophic figures continued, however, they were given bird faces with notable beaks and were depicted as significantly more voluptuous than previous plank figures, likely being inspired by similar figures that where already produced in the Near East. It has been proposed that these figures do not represent ordinary women but deities. Interest in maternal figures increased again in Cyprus during the Archaic Age. The reason for the creation of kourotrophic figures is debated, as the figures being representations of a great goddess, fertility charms, childbirth charms/aids, or companions to the dead have all been proposed. ==References== Category:Epithets of Aphrodite Category:Epithets of Apollo Category:Epithets of Artemis Category:Epithets of Athena Category:Epithets of Hermes ","title":"Kourotrophos"},{"id":"46289235","text":"Li Jian (born 23 September 1974) is a Chinese singer.

His interest in migratory locusts and other grasshoppers (acridology) saw him visit Socotra (an expedition for Desert Locust Survey Nairobi), Eritrea, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, Iran, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Russia. His base was at the Anti-Locust Research Centre in London, working from there until his retirement in 1984. After retirement he remained active, embarking on programs for the Food and Agriculture Organization and others. Popov's knowledge of the Arabian Peninsula led to his receiving the Lawrence of Arabia Memorial Medal (1995) from the Royal Society for Asian Affairs.http://plants.jstor.org/stable/history/10.5555/al.ap.person.bm000006646http://www.fao.org/ag/locusts/common/ecg/653_en_DL243e.pdf In 1957 Popov undertook a study on the locusts of Socotra.

She is best known for her essay \\"Who Controls the Past\\", which introduced the concept of archival documentation strategy, and her book Varsity Letters: Documenting Modern Colleges and Universities. ==Biography== Helen Samuels was born in Queens, New York City, in 1943. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Queens College in 1964 and a Masters in Library Science from Simmons College in 1965. She began her career in libraries in 1967 as the Music Specialist at the Massachusetts Public Library in Brookline, and worked as the Music Librarian at the Hilles Library at Radcliffe College until 1972. In 1972 she was hired by the University of Cincinnati to run their fledgling archival program, a repository participating of the Ohio Historical Society's regional network. There she collaborated with faculty in the history department in order to create the university's first institutional archive, eventually holding the position as Head of Special Collections. In 1977, she became the first Institute Archivist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she built a collection of institutional records to document the history of the university. Based on her experience in this position and funded by an Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Grant, she wrote Varsity Letters: Documenting Modern Colleges and Universities, which was published in 1992, and which received the Society of American Archivists' Waldo Gifford Leland Award. Her final professional position was at MIT in the role of Special Assistant to the Associate Provost. In that capacity she worked in research and writing for numerous campus policy and information issues. She also worked as an educator, consulted to other institutional repositories, and served in several professional organizations before her retirement in 2006. According to Jelain Chubb and Ben Primer, during her career Samuels established herself as a respected voice in archival theory, particularly for the development of appraisal in an academic setting and her work processing science-related collections. She emphasized a ‚Äúdocumentation strategy‚Äù for appraisal and intake of collections that consists of researching and documenting society and its institutions in an active, systematic, and comprehensive way. == Major contributions ==  Documentation strategy  Samuels introduced the idea of documentation strategy in her American Archivist article \\"Who Controls the Past\\". While repositories had been implementing collection policies for some time, the idea of a documentation strategy was a new intellectual framework to guide archival practice. Samuels defined documentation strategy as \\"a plan formulated to assure the documentation of an ongoing issue, activity, or geographic area (e.g., the operation of the government of the state of New York, labor unions in the United States, the impact of technology on the environment)\\". Whereas collections policies governed the appraisal choices within an individual institutional archive, a documentation strategy would be based on subject, governing that process across several different repositories. Samuels noted the importance of collaboration between complementary institutions, as only a small fraction of archival records can be preserved by each archive.  Institutional functional analysis  Samuels' book Varsity Letters: Documenting Modern Colleges and Universities serves as the introduction to her theory of institutional functional analysis. This theory re-examined the popular archival method of processing a collection based on an institution's administrative structure and instead posited that institutional archivists should process records based on their function. She argued that functions are often spread across departments in universities and other institutions, and so archival records must be processed according to their use. She offered seven institutional functions: confer credentials, convey knowledge, foster socialization, conduct research, sustain the institution, provide public service, and promote culture. Although Samuels wrote this text specifically for colleges and universities, the archival practice of institutional functional analysis has been applied in many other institutional settings. ==Selected publications== *Processing Manual for the Institute Archives and Special Collections, MIT Libraries (Cambridge: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1981) *\\"An Analysis of Processing Procedures: The Adaptable Approach.\\" (with Karen T.

He was an important public figure in 19th-century Springfield, Massachusetts. ==Early life and education== He was born May 10, 1821 in Springfield, MA to William Rice and Jerusha Warriner. William Rice Sr. was a respected businessman and public servant who began a long tradition of Methodism in the Rice family. He was a descendant of Edmund Rice, an early settler in Massachusetts. Jerusha Warriner was the daughter of David Warriner and was descended from William Warriner, a founder of Springfield. William Rice II studied in the Springfield public schools and at Wilbraham Wesleyan Academy, graduating in 1840. He received a Master of Arts from Wesleyan University in 1853, and was elected an honorary member of the Eclectic Society in 1857. He was awarded a Doctor of Divinity degree in 1876. ==Ministry== He was ordained in the New England Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1841, and served churches for the next 16 years. He served as pastor at North Maldon, now First United Methodist Church, Melrose, Massachusetts, Saugus, Massachusetts, Marblehead, Massachusetts, now St. Stevens United Methodist Church, North Russell Street Church in Boston, South Street in Lynn, Massachusetts, Park Street (Walnut street) in Chelsea, Massachusetts, Chicopee, Massachusetts, Bromfield Street in Boston, and Park Street in Chelsea again. He was a vocal abolitionist beginning early in his life. He had organized an Anti-Slavery Society while a student at Wesleyan Academy, and had been disciplined. In 1856, he was a delegate to the General Conference of the church, representing the antislavery sentiment of the New England Conference. He was also a delegate in 1876, and was the editor of the Methodist Hymnal, published in that year. He published two books, mainly for ministers: Moral and Religious Quotations from the Poets (Methodist Book Concern, 1860) and Pastor's Manual (Roderick Burt, Springfield, 1863). The Reverend Rice began to suffer from chronic laryngitis, which made preaching every week very difficult, and he returned to Springfield in 1857. He served as chaplain in the Hampden County House of Correction from 1873-1882. ==City Library Association== In 1861, he became librarian of the Springfield City Library. The library was very small at first, but grew tremendously under Rice's care. In 1871, the library moved to a new building named the William Rice Building. It became a free public library in 1885. Today, the Springfield Museums on the Quadrangle have a \\"Society of William Rice,\\" which honors major gifts. When he died in 1897, the library had more than 99,000 volumes. Rice was a member of the American Historical Association, and he cultivated the museums surrounding the library to educate the public. ==Educational interests== He was very passionate about education. In 1863, he was appointed a member of the Massachusetts Board of Education, which he remained for 18 years. He worked especially hard on the Westfield Normal School. He also served on the Springfield School Committee from 1865-1882. He was a member of the board of Wilbraham Wesleyan Academy starting in 1858, served as secretary from 1860‚Äì82, and president of the board from 1882 to his death. He was also a trustee of Wesleyan University from 1875 to his death. ==Family life== He married Caroline Laura North (1819‚Äì1899), daughter of William North of Lowell on September 13, 1843. She had also studied at the Wilbraham Wesleyan Academy. She was the second president of the Springfield Home for Friendless Women and Children in the 1870s. She authored hymns including \\"I builded Rock, on the Rock of God\\", and \\"Wilt thou hear the voice of praise.\\" William and Caroline Rice's children were William North Rice, Edward Hyde Rice, Charles Francis Rice, and Caroline Laura Rice. All four children attended Wesleyan University and attained post-graduate degrees. William North and Charles Francis became ministers, and both earned doctorates. Edward Hyde earned a doctorate degree, and was a principle of multiple high schools before an early death in 1895. Caroline Laura earned a master's degree from Wesleyan. William North Rice and Charles Francis Rice co-wrote William Rice, A Memorial in 1897. Grandchildren included Edward Loranus Rice, William Chauncey Rice, Horace Jacobs Rice, and Paul North Rice, who also became a librarian. William Rice was first cousins with George Washington Rice, the founder of the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company and the Springfield 5 Cent Savings Bank, for which William Rice served as the president. William Rice died August 17, 1897. His funeral and memorial services were held at Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church in Springfield, where the family had a long association. He is buried in his family plot in the Springfield Cemetery. ==Genealogy== William Rice was a direct descendant of Edmund Rice, an English immigrant to Massachusetts Bay Colony, as follows:Edmund Rice (1638) Association, 2007.

He co-wrote SEAL Team Six: Memoirs of an Elite Navy SEAL Sniper and is the author of Trident's First Gleaming and From Russia Without Love, the first two books in his Special Operations Group Thriller series. Templin is a \\"hybrid\\" author who maintains active book contracts with top publishers such as Simon & Schuster and St. Martin's Press while also publishing independently. == Life == Templin began writing at an early age and in about fourth grade wrote his first short story, an action- adventure about a dog that saved people from a fire. While in elementary school, Templin dreamed of becoming a novelist someday. After high school, he served in the US Navy, and during boot camp, he tried out for Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training but failed the Physical Screen Test (PST). While assigned to the United States Pacific Fleet, he used his free time to write short stories and train for BUD/S and finally passed the PST. He joined BUD/S Class 143 and became friends with Howard E. Wasdin (who later became a SEAL Team Six sniper). During training, Templin was injured and rolled back to Class 144, where he completed Hell Week, became a rifle and pistol expert, conducted demolitions, and practiced small unit tactics. While training at San Clemente Island, he had a feeling that a career in the SEALs was not his destiny, and he withdrew from training. After the Navy, Templin volunteered to become a missionary and served for two years in Japan. Then he attended Brigham Young University-Hawaii, where he graduated magna cum laude. He returned to Japan and became a tenured professor at Meio University, where he lectured for fourteen years and also studied the martial art aikido. In 2011, he received his PhD in education from Trident University International. Templin continued to write but mostly in the academic genre. During a research trip, while in the LA International Airport, Templin picked up the book Blackhawk Down and noticed his friend Wasdin was involved in the Battle of Mogadishu. Because the book told little about the Navy SEALs' involvement, Templin looked forward to someday buying Wasdin's book. Because no book had been published about Wasdin and his involvement in the Battle of Mogadishu, when Templin connected with him on Facebook, they decided to co-author Wasdin's biography, SEAL Team Six: Memoirs of an Elite Navy SEAL Sniper. The book was scheduled for release in 2011. That same year, on May 2, Osama bin Laden was shot and killed by SEAL Team Six operators, resulting in much publicity for Templin, Wasdin, and the book. == Critical reception == SEAL Team Six became a New York Times bestseller, international bestseller, and received favorable reviews from various critics, including Michiko Kakutani, Pulitzer Prize-winning critic for the New York Times, who wrote that the book was \\"visceral and as action packed as a Tom Clancy thriller.\\" It was optioned to be adapted into a movie by Vin Diesel and adapted into a Young Adult novel entitled I am a SEAL Team Six Warrior. Templin's books have been translated into German, French, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese, Czech, Polish, Danish, Japanese, Chinese, Hungarian, Vietnamese, and Thai. == Author == After coauthoring SEAL Team Six and two novels, SEAL Team Six Outcasts and Easy Day for the Dead, Templin wrote Trident's First Gleaming, the first novel in his Special Operations Group Thriller series, about a SEAL Team Six veteran who becomes a pastor but is called back into the world of black ops by CIA friend Hannah Andrade. Joining them is a cantankerous Delta Force operator, Sonny Cohen. When deciding whether or not to publish this new series with a traditional print publisher, Templin looked at the digital landscape, citing examples such as Kodak film, Tower Records, and Blockbuster video, and felt that too many traditional publishers lacked a strong strategy for the future of digital. He was also concerned about permanently signing over e-book rights to a publisher, so he partnered with agent Scott Miller and Trident Media Group literary agency and published the novel independently. This marked the beginning of Templin as a \\"hybrid\\" author, publishing books with both traditional print publishers and independently. == Books ==  Nonfiction  * SEAL Team Six: Memoirs of an Elite Navy SEAL Sniper (2011)  Young adult  * I am a SEAL Team Six Warrior (2012)  SEAL Team Six Outcasts Novels  * SEAL Team Six Outcasts (2012) * Easy Day for the Dead (2013)  Special Operations Group Thrillers  * Trident's First Gleaming (2014) * From Russia Without Love (2015) == References  External links == * http://stephentemplin.com * http://authors.simonandschuster.com/Stephen- Templin * http://us.macmillan.com/author/stephentemplin Category:American male writers Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Brigham Young University‚ÄìHawaii alumni Category:United States Navy personnel ","title":"Stephen Templin"},{"id":"46289396","text":"Sichuan Leaders Football Club () is a China League Two club.

The Insurgency in Manipur is part of the wider Insurgency in Northeast India; it combines elements of a national liberation war as well as an ethnic conflict. ==Background== Manipur's long tradition of independence can be traced to the foundation of the Kangleipak State in 1110. The Kingdom of Manipur was conquered by Great Britain following the brief Anglo-Manipur War of 1891, becoming a British protectorate. Manipur became a part of India on 21 October 1949. However, only after violent protests, it became a separate state in 1972. Manipur's incorporation into the Indian state soon led to the formation of a number of insurgent organisations, seeking the creation of an independent state within the borders of Manipur, and dismissing the merger with India as involuntary. ==History== The first separatist faction known as United National Liberation Front (UNLF), was founded on 24 November 1964. However, they remained as political till 1991. Between 1977 and 1980, the People's Liberation Army of Manipur (PLA), People's Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (PREPAK) and the Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP), were formed, immediately joining the war. On 8 September 1980, Manipur was declared an area of disturbance, when the Indian Government imposed the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 on the region, the act currently remains in force. The parallel rise of Naga nationalism in neighbouring Nagaland led to the emergence of National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) activities in Manipur. Clashes between the Isak-Muivah and Khaplang factions of NSCN further aggravated tensions, as Kuki tribals began creating their own guerrilla groups in order to protect their interests from alleged Naga violations. Other ethnic groups such as Paite, Vaiphei, Pangals and Hmars followed suit establishing militant groups. The rise of tribal militias culminated in ethnic violence that took place during the 1990s. ==Current scenario== In contrast with the other wars forming the Insurgency in Northeast India, Manipuri rebels are characterised by a low level of defections and a well organised intelligence network. The rebels have also avoided targeting local police personnel, thus aiming to secure popular support. Extortion remains the main source of funding for militant groups, temples, educational institutions and businesses are known to have been targeted with illegal taxation. As many as 26 permanent, tax collection checkpoints have been set up on the NH-39 and NH-53 National Highways. Rebels have also resorted to abducting children and later employing them as child soldiers. The illegal taxation is done through posts that can be found alongsides the NH-39 and NH-53 highways. The taxation here is very high as compared to the local police excise duties. The effect of these taxations are largely felt by the drivers transporting oil along these highways from Assam to Manipur. Also, there are some cases where anonymous people disguising themselves as the militant groups's soldiers extort heavy charges from the drivers. ==Timeline== * 4 July 2000, 18 insurgents surrendered to the authorities of Imphal in the presence of Manipur Chief Minister Nipamacha Singh. * 18 September 2001, the Indian military killed 5 PLA members during a shootout in the Khoupum valley, Tamenglong district. * 10 February 2003, a KYKL ambush leads to the death of 5 Border Security Force personnel, in Leingangtabi along the Imphal-Moreh road. * 16 January 2005, security forces uncovered a PLA camp in Theogtang Zoukanou, Churachandpur district.

Thomas Louis Hisgen (November 26, 1858 ‚Äì August 27, 1925) was an American petroleum producer and politician. He refused to sell his firm to the Standard Oil Trust and was chosen by the Massachusetts Independence League as its candidate for Governor of Massachusetts in 1907. After a strong third place performance, Hisgen became the logical choice as presidential nominee of the national Independence Party. Although he toured the country on the campaign trail, Hisgen's poorer-than-expected showing at the polls in November 1908 spelled the end for the Independence Party, many of whose members rejoined the Democrats. Hisgen subsequently remained in the public eye as a periodic commentator on events in the petroleum industry. ==Biography== He was born November 26, 1858, in Petersburg, Indiana to William Hisgen and Margaret Catherine McNally.

He was educated in a small country school and was forced by economic circumstances to go to work at an early age to help provide financial support for his parents and siblings. Most of his education Hisgen obtained on his own through a steady reading of books. In 1875, Hisgen was 16, Thomas and his family returned from Indiana to New York, where he and two brothers worked as clerks in a clothing store. His father, who had some basic knowledge of chemistry, had long worked at creating a new and improved axel grease compound which could be pantented and marketed.

Set in the fictional town of Tecumseh, Ohio, an unnamed Boston-area women's college, and Manhattan, it tells the story of Derrick Thornton, an aspiring female writer and poet, who ends up preferring the \\"herbs and apples\\" of Tecumseh to any sort of literary life. The novel received a minor reception at the time, but otherwise made no impact. It was rediscovered when Santmyer became a literary sensation in 1984, and reissued in hardcover (Harper & Row, 1985) and paperback (St. Martin's Press, 1987), with an introduction and three poems by Santmyer. ==Plot== The story is told in the first person by Sue, who had met the young Derrick once, and then meets her a second time on the train taking them to the same college. At college, the two girls form a clique dedicated to literature and philosophy with four other freshmen, Alice, Edith, Madeleine, and Frances. Derrick is easily the most ambitious and talented of them, writing poetry. She argues forcefully that marriage is an abdication of artistic talent, and vows never to get married. During the summer between their freshman and sophomore years, World War I breaks out, and the United States enters the war a few months before they graduate. Derrick, Sue, and Alice move to Manhattan, where Derrick finds a secretarial job working for a literary magazine. She continues to write poetry, and most of one play. On home visits, she argues with her childhood friend, Jack Devlin, whose support of pacifism angers her. To her shock and fear, he enlists, and she agrees to consider marriage on his return. Jack is killed in action, and Derrick takes it very hard. Shortly afterwards, Derrick's mother becomes deathly ill, and Derrick moves back to Tecumseh, destroying her drafts. As the oldest child of six, she finds herself replacing her mother in her siblings' lives. She accepts a teaching job at an elementary school. Sue later visits, and barely recognizes Derrick, who is serene and happy with her lot. == Reception Notes Further reading == Early book reviews * * * Later book reviews * * Category:1925 American novels Category:Novels by Helen Hooven Santmyer Category:Manhattan in fiction Category:Novels set in New York City Category:Novels set in Ohio Category:Novels about writers Category:American bildungsromans Category:Novels set during World War I Category:English-language novels Category:1925 debut novels ","title":"Herbs and Apples"},{"id":"46289481","text":"Edward Pope may refer to: *Eddie Pope (born 1973), American soccer player *Edward Pope (priest) (died 1671), Archdeacon of Gloucester *Edward Brian Pope (1911‚Äì2011), English rugby player ","title":"Edward Pope"},{"id":"46289492","text":"The Dead and the Damned (also known as Cowboys & Zombies) is a 2010 American Western horror film directed by Rene Perez, written by Perez and Barry Massoni, and starring David Lockhart, Camille Montgomery, Rick Mora, and Robert Amstler.

He was an important representative of the Italianizing movement in Flemish landscape painting. He worked for prominent patrons including the kings of France and Spain. ==Life== Very little is known about the life and training of Pieter Spierincks. He became a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1655.Pieter Spierincks at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He was active in Antwerp in the period 1655‚Äì1660. Later he was in Italy, Lyon and Paris. In Paris he worked for the French king Louis XIV of France for whom he painted landscapes. He was back in Antwerp in 1666. He was married to Jenne Marie de Jode, the daughter of the prominent engraver Gerard de Jode. He likely died in Antwerp although it is possible that he died during a trip to England. He was the teacher of Geeraert Cruys and Jean Carel van de Bruynel. ==Work== Italian landscape Pieter Spierincks is known for his landscape paintings and the designs he made for the tapestry workshops in Brussels and Oudenaarde. The landscapes he painted for the French king are said to show the influence of Salvator Rosa. His landscapes were also influenced by Paul Bril. His Italianising landscapes further show similarity to the works of Claude Lorrain, particularly in the luminosity of his countryside scenes. His Italianising style was very popular in his time and represents the decorative trend that arose in Flemish art in the middle of the 17th century.

The club won the Dutch championship seven times and the Dutch Cup five times. ==History==  Early years (1995‚Äì1997) After it was announced that the Graydons Canadians, a team from Amsterdam would not participate in the Eredivisie of 1995‚Äì96, Ed de Haas, Carlo Brunink and Oscar Kales founded the club. The club immediately started playing in the highest division in the Netherlands, and was named Finish Profiles Amsterdam after the new main sponsor. In the first season Tyrone Marionneaux was the head coach and Finish Profiles ended on a 9th place. In the 1996‚Äì97 Jan Willem Jansen became head coach and new players like Mario Bennes were acquired, which led to the team winning the NBB Cup and reaching the league Finals. The club also played for the first season with the name Amsterdam Astronauts, which referred to the home arena of the club, the Apollohal. First European games and Dutch titles (1997‚Äì2002) Sporthallen Zuid, home arena of Amsterdam In 1997‚Äì98 the club debuted in Europe and started a second team, that would play in the Promotiedivisie. From that point some good years for the club began, as one of the all-time great coaches in Dutch basketball history Ton Boot started coaching the team. In the 1998‚Äì99 season the club won its first Dutch championship and reached the semifinals of the Koraƒá Cup, in which it lost to Racing Basket Paris. In that semifinals the team played against later NBA All-Star Tony Parker. In the 2000‚Äì01 season the 3rd straight Dutch title was one. Before the 2001‚Äì02 season the club moved to Sporthallen Zuid, which had a capacity of 3,000. Another championship was won in the Sporthallen. The club had a tough season the following year, as newly formed EiffelTowers Nijmegen took the trophies. Golden Years (2003‚Äì2009) Arik Shivek coached Amsterdam to three DBL titles In the 2003‚Äì04, season Israeli head coach Arik Shivek became head coach of Amsterdam, and some memorable players were acquired in Joe Spinks, Mario Bennes (who played earlier with the club), Chris McGuthrie and Teddy Gipson. The club also got a new main sponsor in Demon and was renamed Demon Astronauts. In 2004‚Äì05, the fifth national title was won, after Amsterdam beat Landstede Basketbal 4‚Äì0 in the Finals. In 2005‚Äì06 and 2006‚Äì07, Amsterdam played as the Amsterdam Astronauts and ended in the 2nd and 6th places in the Eredivisie. In May 2007, businessman Roel Pieper got the job of chairman of the club. MyGuide became the new main sponsor of the club. In 2008‚Äì09 and 2009‚Äì10, the club won their sixth and seventh titles, both by beating EiffelTowers Den Bosch 4‚Äì3 in the Finals. Also, captain Peter van Paassen won the league MVP award in both seasons. Even though Amsterdam won their 2009 title on May 31, they had to wait till June 15 to officially get their title. Amsterdam player Orien Greene had used cannabis, but because the letter to inform the club never arrived the club got to keep their title. To add to the turmoil, both main sponsors of the club (MyGuide and Eclipse-Jet) went bankrupt, so the team played without a sponsor in the 2009‚Äì10 season. Rebuilding and disappearance (2009‚Äì2011) The team was renamed ABC Amsterdam. The team, led by domestic players as DBL All-Stars Jessey Voorn, Dimeo van der Horst and Ramon Siljade did manage to reach the Playoffs in the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010‚Äì11 seasons. The team was dissolved on August 11, 2011, after it couldn't find a main sponsor that was willing to invest enough money to keep the club in the DBL. For the first time since the foundation of the Eredivisie, no team from Amsterdam played in the league. In the 2012‚Äì13 season, BC Apollo entered as new team from Amsterdam. ==Sponsorships names== *1995-1997: Finish Profiles Amsterdam *1997-2003: Ricoh Astronauts *2003-2006 Demon Ricoh Astronauts *2006-2007 Amsterdam Astronauts *2007-2009 MyGuide Amsterdam *2009-10 EclipseJet-MyGuide Amsterdam *2010-2011 ABC Amsterdam == Honours ==  Domestic competitions Dutch League * Winners (7): 1998‚Äì99, 1999‚Äì00, 2000‚Äì01, 2001‚Äì02, 2004‚Äì05, 2007‚Äì08, 2008‚Äì09 Dutch Cup * Winners (5): 1996‚Äì97, 1997‚Äì98, 1998‚Äì99, 2003‚Äì04, 2005‚Äì06  European competitions FIBA Koraƒá Cup * Semi-finalist (1): 2000-01 ==Season by season== {  style=\\"font-size:85%\\" - bgcolor= !Season !Tier !League ! !Dutch Cup !colspan=2  European competitions - efefef;\\"1995‚Äì96  center;\\"1  Eredivisie  center;\\"  9th   colspan=2 - efefef;\\"1996‚Äì97  center;\\"1  Eredivisie  center;\\" bgcolor=silver  2nd  bgcolor=gold  Winner  3 Koraƒá Cup  - efefef;\\"1997‚Äì98  center;\\"1  Eredivisie  center;\\"  3rd  bgcolor=gold  Winner  3 Koraƒá Cup  - efefef;\\"1998‚Äì99  center;\\"1  Eredivisie  center;\\" bgcolor=gold 1st  bgcolor=gold  Winner  3 Koraƒá Cup  - efefef;\\"1999‚Äì00  center;\\"1  Eredivisie  center;\\" bgcolor=gold 1st   2 Saporta Cup  E8FFD8\\"  - efefef;\\"2000‚Äì01  center;\\"1  Eredivisie  center;\\" bgcolor=gold 1st   3 Koraƒá Cup  bgcolor=#ACE1AF  - efefef;\\"2001‚Äì02  center;\\"1  Eredivisie  center;\\" bgcolor=gold 1st   2 Saporta Cup  - efefef;\\"2002‚Äì03  center;\\"1  Eredivisie  center;\\"  3rd   2 ULEB Cup  - efefef;\\" 2003‚Äì04  center;\\"1  Eredivisie  center;\\" 3rd  bgcolor=gold  Winner  colspan=2 - efefef;\\"2004‚Äì05  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"1  Eredivisie  center;\\" bgcolor=gold  1st  3 FIBA Europe League  E8FFD8\\"  - efefef;\\"2005‚Äì06  center;\\"1  Eredivisie  center;;\\" 3rd  style=\\"background:gold\\"Winner  2 ULEB Cup  - efefef;\\"2006‚Äì07  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"1  Eredivisie  center;\\" 4th   3 FIBA EuroCup  - efefef;\\"2007‚Äì08  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"1  Eredivisie  center; background:gold;\\" 1st  style=\\"background:silver\\"Runner-up  colspan=2  - efefef;\\"2008‚Äì09  center;\\"1  Eredivisie  center; background:gold;\\" 1st  style=\\"background:silver\\"Runner-up  3 EuroChallenge  D0F0C0\\" - efefef;\\"2009‚Äì10  center;\\"1  Eredivisie  center;\\" 7th  style=\\"background:silver\\"Runner-up  3 EuroChallenge  - efefef;\\"2010‚Äì11  center;\\"1  DBL  center;\\"8th   colspan=2  } ==Notable players== To appear in this section a player must have either: played at least one season for the club, set a club record or won an individual award while at the club, played at least one official international match for their national team at any time or performed very successfully during period in the club or at later/previous stages of his career. * Chris McGuthrie (1998‚Äì2003) * Joe Spinks (1998‚Äì2006) * Tony Miller (2001‚Äì02, 2003‚Äì04) * Ramon Siljade (2005‚Äì11) * Avis Wyatt (2007‚Äì09) * Stefan Wessels (2004‚Äì09) * Peter van Paassen (2005‚Äì09) * Orien Greene (2008‚Äì09) * Teddy Gipson (2003‚Äì06, 2007‚Äì09) * Patrick Sanders (2010) * Jessey Voorn (2007‚Äì11) * Dimeo van der Horst (2007‚Äì11) * Sergio de Randamie (2007‚Äì11) ==References== Category:Defunct basketball teams in the Netherlands Category:Former Dutch Basketball League teams Category:Basketball teams established in 1995 Category:Basketball teams disestablished in 2011 Category:Sports clubs in Amsterdam ","title":"Amsterdam Basketball"},{"id":"46289640","text":"Blue Startups is a Hawaiian-based accelerator company co-founded by Henk Rogers, Maya Rogers and Chenoa Farnsworth in 2012.

The cohort program takes place once a year, with programs that focus on developing \\"capital-efficient and scalable-technology companies\\" in the Internet, software, mobile, gaming, and e-commerce industries. Startups are selected from hundreds of applicants receive an initial investment of $25,000, training, and office space in exchange for a 3% to 10% equity stake. Blue Startups is able to invest up to $300,000 in each startup. The company has hosted ten cohorts as of August 2018, and it has 76 companies in its portfolio, which have been awarded $2,000,000 in \\"seed and additional capital\\" by Blue Startups. The company has been met with good recognition for its involvement in assisting with startups and its participation in improving the Hawaiian technological scene. It appeared at number 17 on a list of the \\"top 20 US accelerators\\" and was cited as an example of companies that are \\"mentoring an expanding network of Internet, software, mobile, and e-commerce firms.\\" ==History== Henk, Maya Rogers and Chenoa Farnsworth co-founded Blue Startups on September 1, 2012 to provide tools and assistance to help companies and the Hawaiian business industry. As of 2015, Maya Rogers is in charge of business development. In 2013, Chenoa Farnsworths is the accelerators Managing Partner. Blue Startups has a network of over 120 mentors from Hawaii, the Silicon Valley, and Asia. All participating companies of the cohort program have access to this extended network. The company describes itself as being a \\"stepping stone\\" for entrepreneurs in Asia and the Silicon Valley areas who want to get into each other's markets. As of August 2018, Blue Startups has eight lead mentors. These lead mentors include founding mentor Henk Rogers, Robert Robinson, Steve Markowitz, Donavan Kealoha, Lisa Brett, Bill Spencer, Michael Troy, Joseph Pigato, and Eric Bjorndahl. The company has a network of over 120 mentors from the Hawaii, Silicon Valley, and Asia areas including Don Dodge, Don Kosak, Eric Nakagawa, Faruq Ahmad, Marvin Liao, Peter Kay, Rob Bertholf, Steve Sue, Steven Baker, Tina Fitch and more. Henk Rogers has assisted in the video game industry, particularly with respect to the puzzle video game Tetris. Robinson participated on a panel of judges as part of the Entrepreneurs Foundation of Hawaii on March 24, 2015. In this event, he and other judges are tasked with judging five-minute pitches to them. Blue Startups hosted a \\"digital lifestyle conference\\" from November 6‚Äì7, 2014, which was done to allow investors from Silicon Valley and Asia to \\"meet for deal making, learning and networking.\\" The company took part in the 15th annual holiday tech fair, which was hosted at the Japanese Cultural Center in Honolulu by the High Technology Development Corporation on December 29, 2014. Blue Startups was given $200,000 in Hawaiian taxpayer money at first, and later had taken in an approximate total of $1.7 million. The state of Hawaii requires matching funds, so Blue Startups has received approximately the same amount in private investments. The tax funding was given to Blue Startups as well as two other Hawaii-based startups by the Hawaii Strategic Development Corp.'s Launch Akamai Venture Accelerator program. Cohort program Blue Startups runs an annual cohort program which focuses on developing \\"capital- efficient and scalable-technology companies.\\" These companies vary between Internet, software, mobile, gaming, and e-commerce companies. The majority of the three-month-long program offered by Blue Startups takes place in Hawaii, on the island of Oahu, with a one-week follow-up in Silicon Valley, California. The mentoring cohorts occur twice per year, with up to 10 companies accepted into each session. Each company that participates in a cohort receives a seed investment, office space, a 3-month program consisting of entrepreneurial training, and more. Each participating company receives an initial investment of $25,000. The companies are each assigned personal mentors and meet at least once a week. In return, Blue Startups retains a 3% to 10% equity stake in each company. For a company to apply for a Blue Startups cohort, they must have two to four founders, with most of the team willing to live in Hawaii during the program. All companies must be incorporated as a C corp to be eligible. Teams are expected to work in the Blue Startups' space in downtown Honolulu for a minimum of five hours a day during the length of the cohort. Blue Startups received over 100 applications and selected seven companies to participate in its first cohort. The second session received more than 200 applications and seven were chosen to participate in the 13-week program. On January January 6, 2014, the company announced that it was seeking applicants for its third cohort. Applications were accepted from January 6 to February 1, 2014, and the event took place on from March 17 to June 6, 2014. It was announced on April 2, 2014 that the candidates for the third cohort of startups had been chosen. Another demo even was hosted by Blue Startups in conjunction with Energy Excelerator called \\"Startup Paradise Demo Day.\\" It was scheduled on June 13, 2014, and it was hosted at Iolani School's Seto Hall and Sullivan Center for Innovation and Leadership. By the end of the third cohort in October 2014, the 23 graduating companies raised over $6 million of follow-on investments from private investors. Blue Startups announced its fourth cohort of startups on July 22, 2014. It hosted an informational session for interested parties on July 29, 2014, and set a cut-off date of August 15, 2014. This particular event had Blue Startups seeking companies that have a \\"health care technology focus.\\" Despite the deadline passing, Blue Startups allowed companies to continue submitting applications for the event. The event was a collaboration between the company and Hawaii's online health insurance exchange Hawaii Health Sector. The company held this fourth cohort during the Fall of 2014, where the company chose ten companies to participate. Applications for the company's fifth cohort event in Spring of 2015 began on December 1, 2014. During the company's Spring 2015 cohort event, it selected eight applicants out of a group of 300. The Spring 2015 program was designed with a focus on travel- based technology. The company that is selected by Blue Startups during the Spring event will be given mentorship by Michael Troy, who works in the tourism industry. Blue Startups' portfolio includes 36 investments. A total of five cohort selections have been completed as of March 2015. Below is a list of portfolio companies: { class= \\"\\" - ! Cohort 1 !! Cohort 2 !! Cohort 3 !! Cohort 4 !! Cohort 5 !!

Blue Startups appeared on a list of the top 20 \\"America's top tech accelerators\\" by The Seed Accelerator Rankings Project, and was selected by Yael Hochberg, Susan Cohen, and Dan Fehder. The company ranked at number 17. It was selected among \\"150 accelerators, fixed- term, cohort-based programs.\\" An editor for CNNMoney named Hawaii one of the top 10 most entrepreneurial states. In this article, the author cited companies like Blue Startups as an example of companies who are \\"mentoring an expanding network of Internet, software, mobile, and e-commerce firms.\\" The company's services are valued at more than $500,000. Pacific Business News editor Stephanie Silverstein noted that while two other startup companies were having difficulties with money and management, Blue Startups was \\"off to a strong start.\\" Brandon Bennett, CEO of Happy Hour Pal (one of the companies accepted into Blue Startups through its cohort program), praised Blue Startups for being accommodating to his company and noted that the business atmosphere between him and other startup owners was good. Sagely, one of the companies from Blue Startups' fourth cohort, stated that \\"the opportunities offered by Blue Startups would be impossible to do on your own.\\" Blue Startups' first three cohorts, as of July 22, 2014, have managed to raise more than $6 million in investment capital. Business owner Arben Kryeziu seemed to have an \\"adamant\\" desire to fund companies that came out of Blue Startups' cohort programs, as noted by author Evan Nagle. Kryeziu noted that his business, which is similar to Blue Startups, will exist in the area to add to the Hawaiian startup efforts rather than compete in it. ==See also== * Business incubator * Seed accelerator ==References * Official website for Blue Startups Category:American companies established in 2012 Category:Startup accelerators Category:Companies based in Honolulu ","title":"Blue Startups"},{"id":"46289655","text":"Irving Lavin (14 December 1927 ‚Äì 3 February 2019) was an art historian of Late Antique, Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, and Modern painting, sculpture, and architecture. His wide-ranging contributions centered primarily on the correlation between form and meaning in the visual arts. ==Scholarly life and work== Irving Lavin was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Isadore Lavin and Jenny Shuff. Lavin began his career studying philosophy, first at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, then as a student of Horst W. Janson at Washington University, St. Louis, where he graduated with a B.A. in 1949. At the invitation of Bertrand Russell, Lavin went to Cambridge University to become his tutee. The following year, as he often joked, he turned to a more practical field, namely art history. At the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, he studied with, and was the assistant to, Walter Friedl√§nder, Richard Offner, and Erwin Panofsky. With Horst W. Janson he wrote his master's thesis, \\"The Sources of Donatello's Bronze Pulpits in Lorenzo\\" (1951), and received his M.A. in 1952. At Harvard University he received a second M.A. in 1953, working with Ernst Kitzinger and John Coolidge. Under the latter, he wrote his doctoral thesis on \\"The Bozzetti of Gianlorenzo Bernini,\\" and received his Ph.D. in 1955 from Harvard University. He served in the U.S. Army from 1955 to 1957 as Assistant for the Human Resources Research Office, Continental Army Command at Fort Monroe, Virginia, Specialist Second Class. Between 1957 and 1959, Lavin was a Senior Fellow at the Dumbarton Oaks Research Center in Washington, D.C., where he wrote a major study of \\"The Hunting Mosaics of Antioch and Their Sources: A Study of Compositional Principles in the Development of Early Mediaeval Style\\" (1963). Lavin's success became noteworthy early on: his publications won the College Art Association's prestigious Arthur Kingsley Porter Prize for Scholars under 40 on three occasions (1959, 1962, and 1968), so often, in fact, the paradigm for the prize was changed. After teaching art history at Vassar College for two years (1959‚Äì61), Lavin began a period of over twenty years in which he alternated teaching at New York University‚Äîfirst at Washington Square College, then in 1967 at the Institute of Fine Arts graduate school‚Äîand doing intensive research in Rome, Italy. His work was supported there by various grants, including a Senior Fulbright Scholarship, Italy, 1961‚Äì63; a Senior Fellowship from the American Council of Learned Societies, 1965‚Äì66; and a Guggenheim Fellowship, 1968‚Äì69. Circa 1966, he made a historic discovery of the previously unknown earliest portrait bust (1612, Antonio Coppola) by the young prodigy Gianlorenzo Bernini, thirteen years old at the time, along with another equally remarkable unknown bust of Antonio Cepparelli dated 1622. These revelations were the first of many such Bernini discoveries made throughout Lavin's career, the last of which is a black and white marble sculpture of the famous Roman lawyer Prospero Farinacci, published in spring 2018. Lavin was appointed in 1973 as Professor in the School of Historical Studies at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, to the chair previously held by Erwin Panofsky and Millard Meiss. From that position, Lavin contributed to many aspects of art history‚Äôs position in America. He broadened the emphasis of scholarship from its long-held tightly Eurocentric attention, to include for the first time in the memberships at the Institute, on the board of the Comit√© International d'Histoire de l'Art, and in the programs of meetings of the College Art Association, specialists in the fields of African art, the art of Mexico and South America, India, and the Far East. As a founding committee member, he played a major role in the creation of three new research institutes in North America: the Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles; the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts, the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; and the Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal, Canada. Lavin‚Äôs deep knowledge of Italian art and culture was the result of over fifty years of study, particularly in Rome, where he embraced the city, created enduring academic colleagues and friends, and encouraged Italian art history to expand from its traditional emphasis on national and stylistic concerns into a broader world of intellectual creativity. For this gift, the city offered him many honors, including the Tercentennial Medal, commemorating the death of Bernini (1980), the Premio Daria Borghese (1981), and appointed him Honorary Member of the Corporation of Sculptors and Marble Workers of Rome, as well as Membro Straniero della Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei. He also received the Premio Internazionale ‚ÄúGalileo Galilei‚Äù from the University of Pisa (2005), the Sescentennial Medal, commemorating the birth of Donatello, from L‚ÄôAccademia delle Arti del Disegno, Florence (1986) and Accademico d'Onore by Accademia Clementina, Bologna (1986). In 2019, Lavin was posthumously named Grand'Ufficiale dell'Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana. Lavin‚Äôs publications show his wide-ranging intellectual interests: from late antique architecture (Triclinia) to North African, particularly Tunisian, floor mosaics, the Renaissance (Donatello, Michelangelo, Pontormo, and Giovanna Giambologna), the Baroque (Caravaggio and Gian Lorenzo Bernini), to the twentieth century, with essays on Pablo Picasso and Jackson Pollock. He also communicated easily with practicing artists and was close friends with George Segal, Mel Bochner, and Frank Stella, and traveled with and wrote about Frank O. Gehry. Lavin was a celebrated lecturer: he gave the Franklin Jasper Walls Lecture at the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York (1975); the Slade Lectures at Oxford University in 1985; the Thomas Spencer Jerome Lectures at the University of Michigan and the American Academy in Rome, 1985‚Äì86; the Una‚Äôs Lectures in the Humanities, University of California, Berkeley, 1987; and the Andrew W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 2004. His books include Bernini and the Crossing of St. Peter‚Äôs (1968); Bernini and the Unity of the Visual Arts (1980); Past‚ÄìPresent: Essays on Historicism in Art from Donatello to Picasso (1993); Santa Maria del Fiore: Il Duomo di Firenze e la Vergine Incinta (1999); and Caravaggio e La Tour: La Luce Occulta di Dio (2000). The first two volumes of a projected six- volume edition of his collected works have been published as Visible Spirit: The Art of Gianlorenzo Bernini (2007‚Äì09), while the third volume has appeared as Bernini at St. Peter‚Äôs: The Pilgrimage (2012). A gathering of his essays on modern and contemporary art, The Art of Art History, has also appeared in Italian as L‚ÄôArte della storia dell‚Äôarte (2008). His last publication was an article on \\"The Silence of David by Gianlorenzo Bernini,\\" which will be published posthumously in the periodical Artibus et Historiae in spring 2019. Lavin retired in 2001 and continued to live and work at the Institute for Advanced Study with his wife of sixty-six years, the art historian Marilyn Aronberg Lavin, who edited his Festschrift, Rome Italy Renaissance: Essays Honoring Irving Lavin on His 60th Birthday. Although there is no teaching at the Institute for Advanced Study, Lavin continued to do so at New York University and Princeton University. Some of his many noteworthy students include now close colleagues Jack Freiberg, David Levine, Nicola Courtright, Gail Feigenbaum, and Charles Scribner III. ==Select publications== *Bernini and the Crossing of St. Peter's (1968). *Bernini and the Unity of the Visual Arts (1980). *Gianlorenzo Bernini: New Aspects of his Art and Thought: A Commemorative Volume (1986). *Past-Present: Essays on Historicism in Art from Donatello to Picasso (1993). *Meaning in the Visual Arts: Views from the Outside: A Centennial Commemoration of Erwin Panofsky (1892‚Äì1968) (1995). *Santa Maria del Fiore: Il Duomo di Firenze e la Vergine Incinta (1999). *Caravaggio e La Tour: La Luce Occulta di Dio (2000). *(with Marilyn Aronberg Lavin) Images from the \\"Song of Songs\\" in the Art of Cimabue, Michelangelo, and Rembrandt (2002). *Visible Spirit: The Art of Gianlorenzo Bernini (2007‚Äì09). *L'Arte della storia dell'arte (2008). *\\"The Silence of Bernini's David\\" (2018). ==Bibliography== All of Lavin's writings, including books (except the two larger books), articles, and Occasional Papers are freely available as downloads online in PDF form at http://publications.ias.edu/il. ==References *The Lavin Archive is housed at the Shelby White and Leon Levy Archives Center of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey *Institute for Advanced Study: Irving Lavin *School of Historical Studies, Institute for Advanced Study *Dictionary of Art Historians: Lavin, Irving (caveat: contains many inaccuracies) Category:1927 births Category:2019 deaths Category:American art historians Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Institute for Advanced Study faculty Category:Washington University in St. Louis alumni Category:New York University alumni Category:Vassar College faculty Category:American Jews category:jewish historians ","title":"Irving Lavin"},{"id":"46289712","text":"Aysel Eksi (26 January 1934 ‚Äì 14 May 2015) was a Turkish psychiatrist and professor. == Early life and education == Eksi graduated from the University of Ankara, Medical Faculty in 1960.

Described as a collection of minigames where each game represents a different type of personality found in people, each level in Pillar has different gameplay mechanics to examine various personality traits and themes. Reviewers noted the game's exploration of themes such as love, religion, capitalism, aging and regret. ==Gameplay== Pillar is made up of several levels, each starring a different character with their own set of gameplay mechanics. Examples include introverted characters who can only be around NPCs for so long before their energy drains, resulting in the player using stealth strategies. Extroverted characters are tasked with repairing and turning on lightposts throughout the town, they can only complete these puzzles by interacting with other extroverts, responding to moves they've made. ==Development== Hicks started work on Pillar in August 2012 and worked on the game in various locations, including a church. Artist Gon√ßalo Antunes worked on the art remotely from Portugal. A month before the game's announcement, Hicks wrote an article published in Develop explaining his struggles with burnout while working on the game. Pillar was officially announced in August 2014. Hicks cited the film Magnolia, the Myers-Briggs Personality Test and real life relationships as influences on the game. He also explained his goal to tell a story non-verbally through the gameplay mechanics and cited Jonathan Blow and Jason Rohrer as influences for this idea. The game was originally planned for a 2014 release but was delayed until 2015, releasing February 17. Music Pillars soundtrack was composed by Michael Hicks and inspired by ambient artists Brian Eno, Sigur R√≥s, Nils Frahm, Peter Broderick and experimental musician Tim Hecker. Hicks approached the soundtrack in an unorthodox manner, composing each song as he designed the level it was intended for. He claimed the music influenced game design decisions and vice versa, resulting in a \\"cohesive experience\\". The soundtrack was independently released via Bandcamp a few months before the game's release. ==Reception== Pillar received mixed reviews from critics, with a score on review aggregator Metacritic of 59/100. Critics generally praised the game's art and music, but were divided on the game's execution. Writing for PlayStation LifeStyle, Gary Behan responded well to the game's intuitive storytelling concluding \\"Pillar is a very good game. It‚Äôs pretty, charming, original in its execution and designed with a love for video games and a passion to do something different with them.\\" David Roberts of the Ulster Star echoed these statements, calling the game \\"beautifully constructed, original [and] challenging\\". In a mixed review for Game Informer, Matt Helgeson criticized the gameplay as being \\"more tiresome than enjoyable\\" and expressed confusion at the game's plot, failing to see how the elements came together in any meaningful way. He concluded with a plug for the game's soundtrack, stating it has a chance of being one of his favorites of all time. Bradley Marsh of GameStyle wrote that Pillar \\"clearly isn‚Äôt for everyone. But if you like to use your own imagination whilst being tested, then you will get a good experience here.\\" Matt Whittaker of Hardcore Gamer and TheSixthAxis' Aran Suddi both felt the game was a missed opportunity, criticizing the gameplay. Whittaker felt Pillar would benefit without puzzles in the first place, he concluded that \\"rudimentary puzzle design overshadows every emotional undertone so greatly that boredom is more likely to ensue than introspection.\\" ==References * *Official soundtrack *MichaelArts website Category:2015 video games Category:Indie video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Art games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games ","title":"Pillar (video game)"},{"id":"46289757","text":"Alexander Burgess (October 31, 1819 ‚Äì October 8, 1901) was the first bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Quincy. ==Early Life and Education== Burgess was born on October 31, 1819 in Providence, Rhode Island, the son of Thomas Burgess and Mary Mackie.

Nethercutt in 1971. Its centerpiece is the prestigious automobile collection of the Nethercutt-Richards family, which has led the Los Angeles Times and The New York Times to call the Nethercutt Collection as one of the finest collections in the world. Another unique piece in the collection is the Canadian Pacific Railway's famous Royal Hudson steam locomotive No. 2839 built in 1937. The locomotive is displayed with a 1912 built Pullman private sleeping car. The semi streamlined Royal Hudson steam locomotive is one of four that survive today.http://www.rrpicturearchives.net/archiveThumbs.aspx?id=57857 The collection also houses collections of mechanical musical instruments, including orchestrions, player pianos and music boxes, and antique furniture.The Nethercutt Collection website. Retrieved April 2, 2015. There are also two older-model railroad cars. The collection is free of charge. ==History== In 1956, J.B. Nethercutt (1913‚Äì2004), the cofounder of Merle Norman Cosmetics, purchased two cars: a 1936 Duesenberg Convertible Roadster and a 1930 DuPont Town Car, needing refurbishing. The DuPont restoration, which Nethercutt thought would take a few weeks, instead took 18 months and over $65,000. By 1958, his rebuilt project claimed its first prize ‚Äî the coveted ‚ÄúBest of Show‚Äù award at the prestigious Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in California. In 1971, The Nethercutt Collection building was constructed, a 6-story tower in Sylmar, Los Angeles connected to a Merle Norman manufacturing plant, dubbed the \\"The Tower of Beauty.\\" The first two stories of the tower; the Lower and Grand Salon, feature the main vehicle collection of the Nethercutts. The third story features an awards room and collection of hood ornaments. The fourth story consists of a music room with several large antique music boxes and player pianos, with a Wurlitzer theatre organ in the centerpiece of the room. The fourth floor also features a Louis XV styled dining room. The fifth floor has a theatre and a massive room of pianos. There was a 6th floor penthouse which J.B. used as his secondary residence. In the early 2000s, the Collection expanded and constructed a new display building directly across the street which was separately called the Nethercutt Museum. In comparison with the Nethercutt Collection, which requires guided tours, the newer Nethercutt Museum is self-guided. Outside of the Museum contains a CPR steam locomotive Royal Hudson Nr. 2839 is presented together with a 1912 Pullman Private Car. After J.B. Nethercutt's death in 2004, the collection was handed down to his son Jack Nethercutt II along with his wife, Helen Nethercutt.\\"Founders of the Nethercutt Collection\\" Nethercutt Collection, Retrieved April 9, 2019. From 2008 to 2010 the Nethercutt Collection's vehicles served as the transport of the Grand Marshals of the Rose Parade, including Emeril Lagasse, Cloris Leachman, and Chesley Sullenberger. In 2011, Merle Norman Cosmetics and OPI Products styled its Hussy perfume and lipstick line after the Collection's distinctively red \\"Hussy\\" 1934 Packard LeBaron Sport Phaeton, which is nicknamed after John Hussey. In 2020 the collection was temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. == Vehicles == The Nethercutt Collection has over 250 prestigious, antique, and exotic vehicles, notably including Austin-Healey, Bentley, Bugatti, Duesenberg, Ferrari, Maybach, Rolls-Royce and others. == Events == The Collection hosts silent film screenings in the music room, using the Wurlitzer theatre pipe organ. The Collection also hosts organ concerts and occasional live orchestras in the 5th story theater. Every year until his death, J.B. Nethercutt would take dozens of cars from the Collection with family, friends, and invited guests on a cruise through the hills to a picnic at Frazier Park with catered foods from the professional chefs at the Collection. The event was one of the most exclusive items on any car lovers wish list as Autoweek magazine described it, \\"You can be as rich as Bill Gates or have a collection as big as that of the Sultan of Brunei, but you don't get a personal invitation from J.B. Nethercutt himself.\\" == Concours d'Elegance == The Nethercutt Collection team and family competes in several prestigious concours d'Elegance auto shows nationwide. The collection has won several dozen of awards since its foundation, notably including 5 best of show titles at the pinnacle Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in 1958, 1959, 1969, 1970, and 1990 and at the Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance, winning in 2005, 2007, 2011, 2013, and 2016, both more than any other individual.

During the war, British sea power gave the Allied powers access to these countries, and denied them to the Axis powers. Germany had to seek sources in Europe. Spain and Portugal were the only producers, with Galicia accounting for almost 70% of Spanish reserves.

The series was the first to feature this many separate landscape views. The series was produced between 1856 and 1859, with Hiroshige II finishing the series after the death of Hiroshige in 1858. This print is the 30th in the series, within its spring section, and was published in the eleventh month of 1857. The series was commissioned shortly after the 1855 Edo earthquake and subsequent fires, and featured many of the newly rebuilt or repaired buildings. The prints may have commemorated or helped draw the attention of Edo's citizens to the progress of the rebuilding.Good News from Hiroshige: A New Interpretation of the Series \\"One Hundred Famous Views of Edo\\" The series is in portrait orientation, which was a break from ukiyo-e tradition for landscape prints, and proved popular with his audience.The Independent - Utagawa Hiroshige,The Moon Reflected, Ikon Gallery Birmingham, A thoroughly modern past master ==Description== colour scheme and subject.

The positioning of the undetailed subject 'too close to the lens' is intended to draw the eye to the scene beyond. In addition the use of the unnatural red sky has the effect of flattening the visible space. ==Influence== Hiroshige's most popular prints were produced in the tens of thousands at a low individual cost and due to the opening up of Japan after 1853 were popular both in Japan and Europe where they had a huge influence on the Impressionist artists.Hiroshige: Master printmaker still making waves Hiroshige's original woodblock print and Van Gogh's copy in oil Vincent Van Gogh was a collector of Japanese prints,Van Gogh and Japanese Art, Part 1 - The Bridge in the Rain (after Hiroshige) & Flowering Plum Tree (after Hiroshige) decorating his studio with them.

Appointed to command the Royal Lao Air Force on two separate occasions, he was also entrusted two other times with command of a Military Region. At war's end in 1975, Sourith Don Sasorith was condemned to a communist re-education camp. ==Background== The colonial army in the French Protectorate of Laos was one of Lao recruits and French officers and noncommissioned officers. Those few Lao promoted out of the ranks rose no further than command of a company. After the Kingdom of Laos gained its freedom in 1953, the few Lao with military experience were speedily promoted to much higher command positions than they were accustomed to. Many officers were also commissioned into the upper ranks from civilian life; they tended to gain their posts through family influence rather than training or ability. The few urban elite families who dominated Lao society felt it advantageous to have family members or friends in the military command.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 11‚Äì13. ==Biography== Major General Sourith Don Sasorith was of Vietnamese-Lao heritage. He owed his appointment as a military officer to family connections; Katay Don Sasorith, his cousin, was the former Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos. Sourith commanded Bataillon Parachutistes 1 (Battalion of Parachutists 1) and Bataillon Parachutistes 2 (Battalion of Parachutists 2) of the Royal Lao Army.Conboy, Morrison, p. 23. He also took command of the Lao Army Air Force in January 1958. Despite its name, it consisted of only a single composite squadron of mixed types of aircraft. A French major had been in charge; however, the language barrier between French and Lao had hindered training, as had the low educational level of the Lao airmen. Sourith was appointed because he was strict on discipline. His aviation command was additional to that of the paratroopers. At the time, there was one Lao pilot trained, but 36 more still in training; Sourith was not one of them.Anthony, Sexton, p. 16. Later, Sourith went to France and learned to fly light aircraft, but never progressed any further as a pilot. He flew little, and shunned advice from his American backers in the Programs Evaluation Office concerning the Royal Lao Air Force after his return to Laos. On 23 May 1960, the communist Prince Souphanouvong and his supporters fled imprisonment by the Royal Lao Government; Sourith and two companies of his paratroopers unsuccessfully pursued them. When Captain Kong Le took over the kingdom for General Phoumi Nosavan three months later, Sourith supported Phoumi.Anthony, Sexton, p. 55.Conboy, Morrison, p. 26.Castle, pp. 19‚Äì20. In the wake of the Battle of Vientiane, Kong Le retreated from combat with the Royal Lao Army to the Plain of Jars. Appointed to command of Military Region 2, Sourith commanded forces attempting to contain Kong Le's Forces Armee Neutraliste (Neutral Armed Forces, or FAN) on the Plain. His failure to do so saw him relieved of that command on 13 January 1961.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 43, 47. He would play a similar role following the Battle of Luang Namtha. On 8 May 1962, he joined the routed RLA troops that had just fled Luang Namtha for Ban Houayxay. Google maps Laos. Retrieved: 23 March 2015. Sourith ordered the local ammunition dump blown up to prevent its capture by communist troops. The already demoralized Royalist soldiers panicked; some of them fled further south, into the Kingdom of Thailand. The senior American military adviser from the U.S. Embassy, which was supporting the RLA, concluded that the Royalist army completely lacked the urge for combat.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 72‚Äì73. However, Sourith continued command of Military Region 1 despite the defeat.Conboy, Morrison, p. 95. Sourith was undergoing training at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas when a series of strategy meetings were held in Laos during April and May 1966. On 1 April, General Thao Ma was blamed for using the T-28 Trojans to strike the Ho Chi Minh Trail instead of supporting the RLA. His concentration on T-28 operations was blamed for neglect of airlift operations. These points were hashed over again at a 3 April conference. At a meeting on 21 April, General Ouane announced that Sourith would assume Thao Ma's assignment as soon as Sourith returned to Laos. On 11 May 1966, Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma informed U.S. Ambassador William H. Sullivan of the pending change. The ambassador appreciated Thao Ma as one of the few fighting generals in the RLA, and wanted to retain him. The following day, Sullivan negotiated a compromise that kept Thao Ma in command of the T-28s and moved his headquarters from his home ground of Savannakhet to Vientiane. At some point, Sourith was given command of the newly created Military Airlift section of RLAF C-47 transports. One source insists that happened as early as 4 June,Conboy, Morrison, pp. 157‚Äì158. while another names 27 September.Anthony, Morrison, pp. 201‚Äì203. In any case, when General Thao Ma failed in his 21 October 1966 coup, and fled into exile, Sourith became commander of the entire RLAF. The air force was dispirited by the departure of their charismatic leader. Sourith inherited a splintered organization. The enlisted ground crew was poorly paid and resentful. The transport pilots grew rich off theft and smuggling. The T-28 pilots flew combat missions while the General Staff dithered about the military situation. Sourith brought in older French-trained field grade officers to replace American-trained junior officers; unlike their juniors, the field grade officers were not familiar with American procurement and logistics procedures. At the same time, losses suffered with supporting the ongoing siege at the Battle of Nam Bac ground down the RLAF's T-28 force. By the time Nam Bac fell on 14 January 1968, in what was referred to as \\"the largest military disaster in the history of Laos\\", the American air attach√© had concluded that Sourith was a failure in his command.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 227, 237‚Äì239. By this time, Sourith's RLAF was flying fewer missions than at any time since Thao Ma's departure. The RLAF was broken into composite squadrons to be stationed at the kingdom's main airfields‚ÄîVientiane, Pakxe, Savannakhet, and Luang Prabang. Each squadron was placed at the disposal of its local Military Region commander. Sourith was left with little say over his command.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 258‚Äì260. He could not prevent misuse of the transports for profit.Anthony, Sexton, p. 269. Indeed, on 21 March 1968, Sourith was involved in a smuggled C-47 shipment of opium and gold that was impounded in Saigon by Vietnamese customs officials.Anthony, Sexton, p. 260 During Operation Pigfat in late 1968, Sourith's RLAF gained its first Hmong pilots. The controversial addition of these flying hill tribesmen first took place at Vientiane. It was proposed to make them a separate squadron based in Military Region 2, closer to the fighting. Regardless of their stationing, the Hmong obeyed Vang Pao. Sourith was opposed to the idea of Hmong fighter pilots, but eventually capitulated to the proposal as a way of preventing ethnic tensions among his fliers.Anthony, Sexton, p. 295. Like other officers in the Lao high command, Sourith heard rumors that Thao Ma was going to return to Laos to overthrow the government. When Thao Ma actually returned to Laos on 20 August 1973, Sourith hid in his home, prepared if need be to change his allegiance to support the coup.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 406‚Äì407. He was found huddled under a table, and refused to emerge to deal with the coup because of the danger involved.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 364‚Äì365. After the coup was suppressed without his help via Thao Ma's execution, Sourith was relieved of command of the RLAF and transferred to the post of chief of logistics for the Royal Lao Armed Forces. Major General Sourith was still serving in that capacity at the time the communists took power in Laos. In August 1975, Sourith Don Sasorith was imprisoned in a communist re-education camp in Xam Neua. He perished in the camp.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 419, 423. ==EndnotesReferences== * Anthony, Victor B. and Richard R. Sexton (1993). The War in Northern Laos. Command for Air Force History.

The book was published with the support of Jean Paulhan from Gallimard, who created a collection exclusively dedicated to \\"Tradition\\" in order to publish Gu√©non. == History according to Gu√©non == For Gu√©non, history is only the reflection of a vast cosmic process taking its source in a metaphysical dimension (according to his metaphysical doctrine). From the traditionalist perspective, the temporal, phenomenal world is an outflow and manifestation of an unseen metaphysical reality that forms the origin and basis of the material, historical reality human beings perceive with their five senses. It has been pointed out by several authorsJean-Pierre Laurant, Le sens cach√© dans l'≈ìuvre de Ren√© Gu√©non, Lausanne, Suisse, L'√¢ge d'Homme, 1975, (), p. 181.Georges Vallin, La Perspective metaphysique, Paris, Dervy, 1990, (), p. 40.David Bisson, Ren√© Gu√©non, une politique de l'esprit, Paris, Pierre- Guillaume de Roux, 2013,(ISBN 9-782363-710581), p. 273. that such a conception of History is radically different from that of the philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, who on the contrary locks his in the sphere of time. More precisely, as Georges Vallin explains, in Hegel's thought, the timeless mystery of non-duality, of the \\"coincidence of opposites\\" found in Gu√©non, is replaced by \\"a time-based dialectic of thesis and antithesis.\\" For Vallin, this notion of confinement in time of the human condition, in opposition to the \\"metaphysical perspective\\" of Gu√©non, continued with the conception exposed by the philosopher Martin Heidegger in Being and Time. For Gu√©non, such a confinement of History in Time, cut off from any transcendent reality, takes on a satanic dimension that explains the fall of the modern world.

More recently; Jacob Needleman, in The Sword of Gnosis writes: \\"Many of Gu√©non's books, notably The Reign of Quantity, are such potent and detailed metaphysical attacks on the downward drift of Western civilization as to make all other contemporary critiques seem half-hearted by comparison.\\" Harry Oldmeadow, author of Traditionalism: Religion in the Light of the Perennial Philosophy: \\"The Reign of Quantity is a brilliantly sustained and excoriating attack on modern civilization [...] The book is a controlled and dispassionate but devastating razing of the assumptions and values of modern science. At the same time it is an affirmation of the metaphysical and cosmological principles given expression in traditional culture and religions.\\"Sophia Perennis, books, The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times ==Translations== There are complete translations of Le r√®gne de la quantit√© in a number of languages: English, Italian, Spanish, Persian, and Turkish.

Originally scheduled to be held at the end of October, these elections were brought forward after newly inaugurated President Volodymyr Zelensky dissolved parliament on 21 May 2019, during his inauguration. The election result was the one-party majority, a novelty in Ukraine, for President Zelensky's Servant of the People party with 254 seats. About 80 percent of the elected candidates were new to parliament; 83 deputies managed to get reelected from the previous parliament and 13 deputies from earlier convocations. All deputies from Servant of the People were political newcomers. 61 percent of the new MPs had never before been engaged in politics. Out of 225 constituencies, 26 were suspended due to the March 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia and the ongoing occupation of parts of Donetsk Oblast and Luhansk Oblast by separatist forces of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic (since April 2014). ==Background== Originally scheduled to be held at the end of October 2019, the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary elections were brought forward after newly inaugurated President Volodymyr Zelensky dissolved parliament early on 21 May 2019 (a day after his inauguration), despite claims that he did not have the legal grounds to do this. After Zelensky issued the decree (calling early elections), a lawsuit was filed to the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, which sought to declare the decree unconstitutional and therefore illegal. The court declared the decree to be legal on 20 June 2019. The official reason why Zelensky dissolved parliament was \\"a lack of a government coalition\\". Following the 2014 parliamentary elections, the Petro Poroshenko Bloc (PPB) party became the largest party, after securing 132 seats. On 21 November 2014, the Petro Poroshenko Bloc, People's Front, Self Reliance, Fatherland and the Radical Party all signed a coalition agreement. Arseniy Yatsenyuk became Prime Minister on 2 December 2014. The Radical Party left the coalition on 1 September 2015 in protest over a vote in parliament involving a change to the Ukrainian Constitution that would lead to decentralization and greater powers for areas held by separatists. February 2016 saw the start of the fall of the Yatsenyuk cabinet after the economy minister Aivaras Abromaviƒçius announced his resignation claiming the government did not have real commitment to fight corruption. On 17 and 18 February 2016, the Fatherland and Self Reliance parties left the coalition; meaning that the coalition became 5 deputies short of the 226 needed. On 14 April 2016, Volodymyr Groysman became the new Prime Minister and the Groysman government began with a new cabinet of ministers. Due to the short period of time available to organize the 2019 parliamentary election, current Ukrainian public procurement laws were not followed and to bypass this, local election commissions will work under deferred payment. ==Electoral system== Under current law 225 members of the Verkhovna Rada are elected by nationwide closed party-list proportional representation with 5% electoral election threshold and the other 225 seats elected in constituencies with a first-past- the-post electoral system in one round (candidate with the highest vote total wins). 21 parties take part in the election in the nationwide party-list. For the elections there was established a state financing for all political parties that received 2% support, but on 2 October 2019 that law was canceled.The Rada canceled the state financing of political parties that lost elections (–†–∞–¥–∞ —Å–∫–∞—Å—É–≤–∞–ª–∞ –¥–µ—Ä–∂—Ñ—ñ–Ω–∞–Ω—Å—É–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—è –ø–∞—Ä—Ç—ñ–π, —è–∫—ñ –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–ª–∏ –≤–∏–±–æ—Ä–∏). RBC- Ukraine. 2 October 2019 Out of 225 constituencies, 26 are suspended due to the March 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia and the occupation of parts of Donetsk Oblast and Luhansk Oblast by separatists (since April 2014). Candidates had until 20 June to submit documents to the Central Election Commission of Ukraine to register as candidates for the position of deputy of the Verkhovna Rada. On 25 June 2019, the Central Election Commission ended its registration process. It registered 5,845 candidates for the elections: 3,171 candidates in the single-member constituencies and 2,674 candidates in the single nationwide constituency with 22 parties. Since 2014, various politicians have proposed to reform the electoral system to 100% party-list proportional representation with open lists. President Zelensky is the main proponent. The proposal is opposed by Yulia Tymoshenko. A vote on the proposal (authored by the president) was supposed to take place on 22 May 2019, but members of parliament voted against including it in the agenda. ==Contesting parties== alt=2019 Ukrainian parliamentary electoral list List of registered parties * Opposition Bloc (Evgeny Muraev) * Strength and Honor (Ihor Smeshko) * Fatherland (Yulia Tymoshenko) * Patriot (Mykola Holomsha) * Force of People (Oleksandr Solotai) * Opposition Platform ‚Äî For Life (Yuriy Boyko / Vadim Rabinovich) * Party of Greens of Ukraine (Tetyana Bodun) * Torch (Tetyana Odnoroh) * Self Reliance (Andriy Sadovyi) * European Solidarity (Petro Poroshenko) * Ukrainian Strategy of Groysman (Volodymyr Groysman) * Civil Position (Anatoliy Hrytsenko) * Social Justice (Alla Shlapak) * Servant of the People (Dmytro Razumkov) * Power of the Law (formerly Hope) (Andriy Senchenko) * Radical Party of Oleh Lyashko (Oleh Lyashko) * Party of Shariy (Olha Shariy) * Voice (Svyatoslav Vakarchuk) * Independence (Anatolii Mohyliov) * Agrarian Party of Ukraine (Mykhailo Poplavskyi) * Freedom (Oleh Tyahnybok) * Movement of New Forces (Mikheil Saakashvili) ==Opinion polls== alt=2019 Ukrainian parliamentary elections ratings ==Results== Turnout in electoral districts Turnout in regions lang=en lang=en { class= style=text-align:right !colspan=11350px - ! rowspan=2 colspan=2Party ! colspan=4PLPR ! colspan=3FPTP ! rowspan=2Total ! rowspan=2+/‚Äì - !

The regular band members (Andy Irvine, Kevin Burke, Jackie Daly, Ged Foley) were joined by new member John Carty (fiddle, flute, banjo), and by guest musician Brendan Hearty (harmonium).

In his review for fRoots (Jan/Feb 2008), Colin Irwin stated:Reviews, in Folk Roots No.295/296, Jan/Feb 2008. *\\"It's over two decades since Patrick Street first sauntered among us, liberally dispensing virtuosity, taste and exquisite tunes and it's gratifying to report that they're still at it - and this latest foray into the sunlight finds them as immaculate as ever.\\" *\\"All the vocal tracks slot in neatly around jigs, reels, polkas and hornpipes that blend immaculately together with the help of a relaxed production that creates the impression of a bunch of mates sitting around in the kitchen making sweet, sweet music.\\" In Journal of Music (1 March 2008), Rory McCabe said: *\\"‚ÄòOn the fly‚Äô usually denotes hurriedness, a quick- fix in a situation where time is limited. However, this On the Fly does not betray anything of moves made in-flight or constrained by time. On this, the eighth studio album from Patrick Street, the music is measured out in a space which flows around, above and in-between the 47 minutes it takes to play through the twelve tracks.\\" *\\"Overall, the production creates a live feel. The studio is absent in that you only ever hear four musicians, albeit in an ideally balanced setting: it is a document of things as they are rather than a fiction created in the studio or on stage.\\" *\\"Within Patrick Street is the present place of Irish traditional music as it is in the flesh; this music could happen in your house.\\" In Irish Music Review (5 March 2008), Geoff Wallis added: *\\"There‚Äôs a wide mix of various dance tunes (three sets of reels, (‚Ä¶), plus hornpipes, jigs and slip jigs, as well as a set of polkas with Jackie Daly‚Äôs box to the fore).\\" *\\"Indeed there can have been no more joyous sound on a recent recording than the sheer swing and sway of the twin fiddles on Martin Wynne‚Äôs.\\" *\\"As has become a matter of course, but really needs reiteration, there are few singers in the English-speaking world able to tap so fundamentally into the wellsprings of a song than Andy.\\" *\\"Ever enthralling, On the Fly is an essential purchase.\\" In his review for Allmusic, Chris Nickson concluded: *\\"Patrick Street albums don't come along every day, or even every year. The musicians are certainly the cream of the crop, with a long pedigree between them, as well as great skill and knowledge of the tradition.\\" *\\"The vast majority of the music is from the deep tradition, plus one each by John Carty and Kevin Burke, and the playing, as should be expected, is majestic throughout. The band gives a stately quality to Irish music, rather than the raucous session-type feel injected by so many groups, and with it comes a strong dignity.\\" *\\"As always, this Patrick Street album is worth the wait.\\" ==Track listing== # \\"Na Ceannabh√°in Bh√°na\\" (\\"The Little Fair Canavans\\")/\\"P√°idin O Raifeartaigh\\" (slip jigs) (Trad., Arr.

(\\"Throw the Hypocritical Rascals Out\\") was a 1990/1991 US ad campaign by Jack Gargan advocating voting against incumbents. It started with $45,000 of Gargan's own money, but he eventually raised over $750,000 in donations. ==Background== In 1990, Jack Gargan began to believe that the US economy and political system were failing. Incidents including congressional pay raises, the Keating Five Senate hearings, and the S&L; Crisis drove Gargan to borrow $45,000 from his retirement savings to finance the first of many independent ads entitled \\"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore\\" (a reference to a famous quote from the 1976 political and mass media satire movie, Network) newspaper advertisements denouncing the U.S. Congress for voting for legislative pay raises at a time when average wages nationwide were not increasing. The original article, and subsequent articles sent to newspapers nationwide, drew widespread interest and T.H.R.O. (\\"Throw the Hypocritical Rascals Out\\") was formed. The 1991 congressional election was Gargan's target, and he urged citizens to vote all incumbent congressmen out of office and replace them with new blood. The movement was so widespread that Gargan was even named Time magazine's \\"Hero of the Week\\" on September 10, 1990. The election did not possess the sweeping change that Gargan had hoped. Only 17 incumbents were thrown out. Nevertheless, it was a much higher margin of change since the last election, in which only seven incumbents had lost. Gargan also noted that there was a 12% cross-country differential spread compared to the spread of the previous election. It seemed that while incumbents were still very difficult to remove from office, the potential of this occurring was becoming greater. By January 2, 1991, just 132 days after the first ad was published, Gargan managed to raise $750,000 in donations, many of which were under $10. By this time, he had also purchased 142 newspaper ads in 49 states. Gargan also appeared on 250 radio talk shows, and was interviewed on Donahue, Larry King Live, Good Morning America, and CBS Morning News. == References == Category:Protests in the United States ","title":"Throw the Hypocritical Rascals Out (T.H.R.O.)"},{"id":"46289940","text":"John T.

The Collection is the home of the Voces Oral History Center. which was founded by Maggie Rivas-Rodriguez, a journalism professor at the University of Texas at Austin's Moody College of Communication and co-founder of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists (NAHJ). ==History of the Collection== The fifth floor stacks at the Benson Collection, University of Texas The Latin American holdings at the University of Texas have increased since the early twentieth century. Historian Carlos E. Casta√±eda wrote a history of the collection to 1940, detailing deals for some acquisitions that he observed. Latin American historian Charles W. Hackett, along with three other University of Texas professors went to the 1920 inauguration of revolutionary General √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n as president of Mexico. Hackett learned that the library of historian and bibliophile Genaro Garc√≠a was for sale following his death. Hackett arranged for an appraisal by University of Texas and the deal was negotiated. The collection was enormously rich, 25,000 printed items, newspapers, personal papers of Vicente Guerrero, Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, Valent√≠n G√≥mez Far√≠as, Lucas Alam√°n, Vicente Riva Palacio and others were part of the collection that was transported to Austin by a special train. The expansion of University of Texas's role in Latin American studies dates to this acquisition. The university's Latin American collection was further enriched by a number of acquisitions, including a donation of volumes by the Hispanic Society of America and papers of U.S. historian Justin H. Smith, the collection of Chilean historian Diego Mu√±oz, which included many works by or about Jos√© Toribio Medina. In addition, the library acquired the private collection of Paraguayan historian Manuel Gondra. A huge addition to the library was the acquisition of virtually all the collection of Mexican historian Joaqu√≠n Garc√≠a Icazbalceta that deal with sixteenth-century Mexico. The Garc√≠a Icazbalceta collection included rare and important sixteenth- century printed works, including Bishop Juan de Zum√°rraga's 1544 Doctrina, Fray Pedro de Gante's Doctrina, writings of Francisco Cervantes de Salazar. Manuscripts include an autograph letter by Hern√°n Cort√©s, a memorial by Fray Bartolom√© de las Casas, the residencia of the first viceroy of Mexico, Antonio de Mendoza, and the manuscript of Fray Ger√≥nimo de Mendieta's history of the Franciscans in Mexico.

Today the library serves over thirteen thousand local residents and works in partnership with several other Kansas libraries and agencies. Its motto is \\"creating possibilities, changing lives.\\" ==History== IPL traces its roots back to 1882, when the Ladies Library Association of Independence was tasked with finding and securing books for a small library. That goal came to fruition on December 1 of that year, when the group opened a library in the City Council room in City Hall, and lined the one bookshelf with 94 books purchased for $94.25. Over the next twelve years the Association grew the collection, moving every few years until the Association began talks with the Mayor to open a full-time home for the library. Those discussions resulted in the city agreeing to match the building funds obtained by the Association, which included a $22,500 Carnegie grant. In 1907 the library was finally opened to the public, and was then named the Carnegie Independence Public Library, located at 5th and Maple, where it still stands today. Over the years the facility has been redesigned, redecorated, and re-energized, and now stands at 13,500 square feet. In 2009 the library faced dramatic budget cuts and possible closure. After significant changes instituted by library administrators, the library experienced remarkable recovery, and in 2012 was given the Best Small Library in America Award, cosponsored by the Library Journal and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. ==Library holdings== From fiction, to anime, mystery, history, and large print, IPL's shelves cover a wide range of subject matter and formats. Patrons can also find DVD's, video games, computers, eReaders, puzzles, microfilm readers, printers, scanners, and a nearly complete set of yearbooks from Independence High School dating back to 1911. The library is also a member of SEKnFind, a 41-member consortium of Southeast Kansas Libraries, allowing for a robust inter-library loan program. ==Services== IPL is dedicated to creating and maintaining a solid connection with the public. Toward that end, the library has employed many tools, including an ongoing social media campaign, and several active Facebook pages for different interest groups. Programming is often held in the Library's Kansas Room, and includes workshops in beginning computing, genealogy, knitting, creative writing, book discussions, and more. There is also a Library Book Store, located on the second floor of the Library, an active Children's Library, and a Teens Space. ==References * Independence Public Library Category:Public libraries in Kansas Category:Carnegie libraries in Kansas Category:Independence, Kansas ","title":"Independence Public Library"},{"id":"46290086","text":"Hydrophorus philombrius is a species of brachyceran flies in the family of Dolichopodidae.

Shooting shorts, music videos and one feature-length film ‚Äì Satan, Hold My Hand ‚Äì on little to no money, the studio produced a prolific amount of work in the short time they existed. Common traits ASS Studios became recognized for were their guerrilla style techniques, being set in the Lower East Side of New York City and featuring a wide array of Art Stars and celebrities including Janeane Garofalo. Though merely developing a small cult following by their controversial public screenings at various bars and venues in New York City, the studio's last feature was produced by Jonathan Ames. Eventually, Sell and Miller, who at the time were in a relationship, parted ways due to creative and personal differences, effectively putting an end to the studio. At the time of the studio's collapse, the team was in the middle of their now- abandoned second feature, Werewolf Bitches From Outer Space, starring Janeane Garofalo, Rachel Trachtenburg, and Robert Prichard. Sell's extensive writings on the creation of ASS, the struggles they faced while working on no-budget, extensive alcohol abuse during times of production, and the end of the studio have been published in Filmmaker Magazine. ==Distribution== ASS Studios found distribution with MVD Entertainment who released both a box-set of the studios short films as well as Satan, Hold My Hand. The distribution label is also responsible for releasing work by Sell and Miller prior to their collaboration. ==ASSdance Film Festival== After returning to New York City from the 2012 Sundance Film Festival, Sell and co. developed an idea to start their own independent film festival which would only screen films rejected by other film festivals. The ASSdance Film Festival took place during an entire week in 2012, where films from various no-budget filmmakers were shown at numerous Lower East Side venues and eventually hosting a closing night ceremony at Bowery Poetry Club, where every filmmaker was given an award for their work presented by various celebrities including Janeane Garofalo and Michael Musto. ==Select filmography== * Elf Workout!

Her brother Alaa Abd El-Fattah became an icon during the 2011 uprisings that toppled the Mumbarak regime. Her sister Mona Seif is a genetics researcher and political activist responsible for co-founding an Egyptian movement against military trials of civilians. Sanaa began her activism in 2011 during the height of revolutionary protests in Egypt. Her first experience with protest happened when she became involved in a movement remembering Khaled Said. Her activism only grew from there and at 17 years old Sanaa, after experiencing protests in Tahrir Square, started an independent newspaper \\"al-gornal\\" with a few friends. The independent paper, addressing issues at the heart of the Arab Spring, quickly began popular and production rose to more than 30,000 copies printed per issue. Since her initial involvement in the Arab Spring, Sanaa has also been very active in protest movements and human rights issues. Her image has become a symbol to revolutionaries who respect her political and human rights work and see her as a revolutionary spirit. Sanaa studied language and translation at October 6 University. She worked on the production and editing team in number of films including https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3821280/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr68 , The Square (2013) - Assistant Editor https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2486682/ In the Last Days of the City (2016) - Assistant Editor https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5424898/?ref_=nm_knf_t1 Kiss me not (2017) - Assistant Editor https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4035304/ About Her (2020)- Assistant Editor, Assistant Producer https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10692936/ Daughters of Abdul-Rahman (2020) - Assistant Editor https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11258572/ ==June 2014 protest and jail time== On June 21, 2014, twenty-three men and women, including Sanaa Seif, were arrested outside of the presidential palace in Cairo for protesting the Egyptian protest law. The demonstration was to protest the government's anti- demonstration laws. In a resulting trial, the Cairo Criminal Court sentenced the protestors to \\"two years imprisonment and two further years of surveillance\\". According to an article by the Daily News Egypt, \\"the 22 defendants were appealing their sentencing to three years of imprisonment in October for violating the Protest Law and the use of violence with the aim of terrorising citizens\\". In addition to breaking Egypt's anti-demonstration laws, the protestors were charged with assaulting police officers and destroying public property. Since the time of the verdict, many international organizations including the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, Amnesty International, the Human Rights Watch, and the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights have condemned the verdict. As of February 2015, none of the prominent activists from the movement were pardoned, despite rumors that pardons would be issued on the anniversary of the January 25th movement.http://www.madamasr.com/news/after-100-days-hunger-striking-alaa-abd- el-fattah-agrees-partial-strike ==June 2020 arrest== On June 23, 2020, the Amnesty International reported that Egyptian security forces kidnapped the human rights defender Sanaa Seif from outside the Public Prosecutor‚Äôs office, New Cairo. The rights organization stated that she paid visit to the office to file a complaint against a violent assault, which she and her family suffered outside the Tora Prison Complex, a day earlier. The report stated that Sanaa was taken to the office of the Supreme State Security Prosecution in Cairo, where the prosecutors questioned her over the charges of ‚Äúdisseminating false news‚Äù, ‚Äúinciting terrorist crimes‚Äù and ‚Äúmisuse of social media‚Äù. ==Hunger strike== Beginning on September 4, 2014, Sanaa Seif and her brother, Alaa Abd El-Fattah, who was imprisoned in November 2013 for breaking the anti- demonstration law in addition to other charges, began a hunger strike from their respective prisons, while the rest of the family partook at home. This was in response to the Egyptian authorities refusing to clear Alaa Abd El- Fattah to visit his dying father, prominent humanitarian lawyer Ahmed Seif al- Islam, in addition to the jailing of Sanaa Seif. Both Sanaa and Alaa ended their hunger strike on November 19, 2014, after fears from their family that they were in danger of death. This is not the first time that Sanaa Seif has partaken in a hunger strike. On August 28, 2014, Sanaa underwent a hunger strike with several other women prisoners to protest the Protest and Public Assembly Law.http://www.awid.org/Library/Egypt-Update-Woman-Human-Rights- Defender-Sanaa-Seif-Starts-Hunger-Strike The family has been known to go on frequent partial hunger strikes. ==Image in popular culture== Sanaa Seif has become a symbol of the revolution through her activist work. In the years since 2011, Sanaa's image has become more of a symbol to revolutionaries in Tahrir Square than her connection to her family's activism. She has been highly involved on the ground since attending the protest in response to Khaled Said's beating and death at the hands of the Egyptian police. Self's image is seen by some as the spirit of the revolution prompting artistic representations of her such as the mural in Rome, Italy, by artist Ammar Abo Bakr. Social media presence Since Seif's arrest her supporters have created both a Facebook page and a websitehttp://freesanaa.com providing updates on her jail sentence and calls for her release. The hashtag #FreeSanaa has been used to spread awareness of her situation. According to her pages, hundreds of people have used both #FreeSanaa and #NoProtestLaw to show unity with her fight. The Square (2013) Sanaa Seif was actively involved with the documentary film The Square. She was an editor and shooter on the film. The film details the events of the Egyptian revolution from 2011 to 2013 through the perspective of young activists. The film is particularly critical of the Egyptian Military. The film received much critical acclaim winning awards at the Sundance Film Festival and winning best feature honor at the International Documentary Association. The film was even the first Egyptian film to be nominated for an Academy Award. While it received positive commentary abroad, at home its release was strictly controlled. It was made available on Netflix in January 2014, however the first showing in Egypt did not occur until June 2014 without any promotion. ==References== Category:Political activists Category:People from Cairo Category:Egyptian activists Category:Egyptian women activists Category:1993 births Category:Living people ","title":"Sanaa Seif"},{"id":"46290181","text":"Nove Zaporizhia (; literally, New Zaporizhia) is a village (a selo) in the Zaporizhia Raion (district) of Zaporizhia Oblast in southern Ukraine.

She was last seen alive at a public park in Shanganagh, Dublin, Ireland, on 22 August. The remains of her body were discovered on Killakee Mountain, south of Dublin, in September 2013. The investigation of her disappearance and later of her death was widely reported. The 2015 trial and conviction of Dwyer led to the circulation of evidence concerning O'Hara's and Dwyer's involvement in the BDSM sexual subculture. The evidence of Dwyer's sadistic sexual practices led to the murder being called one of the most shocking crimes in Irish history.\\"Dwyer's depravity shocked the whole nation\\", The Herald, 01 April 2015 ==Background== Elaine O'Hara was born in Dublin on 17 March 1976 and was educated in St. Joseph of Cluny secondary school. She had been bullied at school. She had suffered many mental health issues from her teens, and regularly was hospitalised for psychiatric care. She had been treated by Professor Anthony Clare, who diagnosed depression and borderline personality disorder. She also suffered from asthma, diabetes and was dyslexic. Her mother's death in 2002 was a major setback for her, as was the sudden death of Professor Clare in 2007. In 2005 she moved out of her family home in Killiney to a flat in Blackrock. In 2008 she moved to another flat in Blackrock, before acquiring an affordable housing unit in Belarmine Plaza, Stepaside. O'Hara worked as a childcare assistant in Ballybrack and part-time in a newsagents in Blackrock. She was taking night classes in the town of D√∫n Laoghaire with the hopes of becoming a Montessori teacher. Disappearance O'Hara went missing from her home on 22 August 2012, and it was initially assumed she had disappeared while volunteering at the 2012 Tall Ships' Races. Inside her house, however, she had left her bag, purse, and mobile phone, and security footage showed her leaving her home with a different phone. She was last seen by a jogger in Shanganagh Park in the county of D√∫n Laoghaire‚ÄìRathdown just to the south of Shankill. It was later determined that she had gone to Shanganagh Cemetery, where her mother was buried. A woman was heard crying loudly in the graveyard by a witness. The witness saw the woman, fitting O'Hara's general description, crying beside an old grave, but could not positively identify her as O'Hara.\\"Dwyer trial: defence concludes after three witnesses heard\\", The Irish Times, Apr 28, 2015. Her car was later found nearby, and it was assumed she had, given her psychological history, committed suicide by jumping off the nearby cliffs.  Discovery of evidence  On 10 September 2013, three days before the eventual discovery of O'Hara's body, anglers William Fegan, his brother, and another man spotted a bag lying in the water in Vartry Reservoir, near Roundwood, Co. Wicklow. Normally, the depth of water at the bridge where evidence was found was to , but in 2013, following a long hot period, it was as shallow as to , exposing the items that would have otherwise been beneath the surface. Inside the bag they found handcuffs, clothing, a ball gag, restraints, and leg restraints. The following day, Fegan handed the items he had found in to Roundwood Garda station. Garda James O'Donoghue conducted several further searches at the scene and on 16 September found handcuffs, keys, a leather mask, a knife, an inhaler and a chain with a ring on it. A Dunnes Stores loyalty card found attached to the keyring was identified as belonging to O'Hara. The Garda Water Unit searched the lake on 17 September and 7 October 2013, finding two Nokia mobile phones, two mobile phone batteries, a pair of glasses and sunglasses, and a rucksack. A number on the frame of the glasses and the prescription matched the records for O'Hara held on file at a branch of Specsavers in D√∫n Laoghaire.  Discovery of body  Dog trainer Magali Vergnet regularly walked dogs on wooded land near Kilakee in the foothills of the Dublin Mountains. Starting on 21 August 2013, one of her dogs would regularly disappear and return with some bones during their walk, which Vergnet at first believed were from an animal. On 13 September 2013, the same dog again retrieved more bones, this time accompanied by clothing. Concerned that these might be human, she contacted the landowner, Frank Doyle. They returned to the land with another man and within an isolated clearing, they found scattered and gnawed bones, including the remains of a rib-cage and jawbone. Realising the remains were human, they contacted the Garda√≠. Only 65 percent of her skeleton was recovered. O'Hara's body was later identified through dental records. ==Investigation== Police discovered that in late 2007, O'Hara had visited fetish adult sex website Alt.com under the profile name helpmelearn36/F and viewed the profile of architect72, which was linked to a Gmail address named fetishboy. Police linked these to Graham Dwyer, an architect. Evidence emerged that Dwyer and O'Hara had embarked on a sexual relationship that involved bondage, violence and knives. The relationship was very intense throughout 2008. Violent homemade sex videos and fragments of emails were retrieved from their laptops. Their relationship dwindled, but was rekindled in March 2011 when Dwyer contacted O'Hara through a prepaid mobile phone. Dwyer had a mobile phone number which began with 083, and both he and O'Hara had mobile phones with numbers that began 086. Recovered texts, from the discarded but still operational Nokia phones, sent by Dwyer (under the name \\"Master\\") to O'Hara (as \\"Slave\\") during this period included: Dwyer did not have a history of criminality. His background suggested \\"nothing of note\\". Born on 13 September 1972 in Bandon, County Cork, to Sean and Susan Dwyer, he has three siblings, Mandy, Brendan and James. After completing secondary school, he moved to Dublin in the early 1990s. He studied architecture at Dublin Institute of Technology, Bolton Street, where he began a relationship with Donegal woman Emer McShea. McShea soon became pregnant with a son. However, McShea later testified in court that he once confided to her that he fantasised about stabbing a woman during sex, and he started to bring a kitchen knife in to their bedroom, pretending to stab her. McShea and Dwyer finished their relationship in 1996 and a year later he began dating fellow architecture student Gemma Healy. They wed in Sligo Cathedral in 2002 and five years later they moved to Kerrymount Close, Foxrock. Dwyer's architecture career took off and he started work for A&D; Wejchert & Partners Architects on Lower Baggot Street on 2 July 2001. He was named a director in June 2006 and was involved in a range of major developments at home, including Carlow Institute of Technology, Leopardstown racecourse, and in Poland. His hobbies included flying radio-controlled aircraft and driving luxury cars, while his wife Gemma enjoyed sailing. However, according to information disclosed during Garda interviews, Dwyer's finances were in difficulty at the time of the murder: \\"I was deeply in debt. We had good prospects in 2007. We had a cottage in Rathmines, bought the house in Foxrock to renovate. Then the crash happened. Gemma lost her job and I had huge pay cuts\\", he had said. His trial had heard directors at the firm had suffered a 50% pay cut since 2009, including a 21% cut in the first six months of 2011, cutting his wages to ‚Ç¨70,000. ==Arrest and trial== Evidence from O'Hara's phone and laptop led to warrants to search Dwyer's house, where further evidence was discovered.\\"The grimmest of timelines: From texts and threats to the trapping of a brutal killer Dwyer was arrested\\", The Journal, Mar 27th 2015 He was arrested, and initially denied knowing O'Hara (which was disproven by security footage at O'Hara's home, and the presence of semen in her bed), and later denied murdering O'Hara. The trial opened on 22 January 2015. At the trial, the violent homemade sex videos and retrieved fragments of emails provided evidence of the sexual use of bondage, violence and knives. Numerous messages from O'Hara referred to Dwyer's repeated threats to stab and kill her. Dwyer's defence council Remy Farrell argued that there was no evidence tying Dwyer to O'Hara's death. O'Hara had a history of depression and her cause of death had never been determined by pathologists. She had recently been released from a psychiatric hospital which she had entered after having suicidal thoughts. There was ‚Äúnot a screed of evidence in respect of the cause of death‚Äù, or even evidence that it was murder. According to Farrell, both the police and her own family had first believed that she most probably committed suicide. O'Hara's interest in the BDSM lifestyle had been known to the police since before the discovery of her body, and there were many circumstances that could have led to her death. Farrell said that the violent language used by Dwyer in his texts was proof of nothing more than his sexual fantasies.\\"Graham Dwyer‚Äôs defence says ‚Äògaping chasm‚Äô in prosecution case\\", The Irish Times, 20 March 2015. Se√°n Guerin SC, prosecuting, said that the accumulated evidence pointed to a detailed plan by Dwyer to commit and get away with murder. Dwyer had used O'Hara's low self-esteem to manipulate her. His desire to kill a woman was well-documented in his texts. O'Hara was not a willing participant in sexual violence; she repeatedly expressed her wish ‚Äúnot to be stabbed‚Äù and ‚Äúnot to be beaten‚Äù by him. She only wanted \\"companionship, love and ultimately a child\\". Knowing she had recently been released from psychiatric hospital, Dwyer had lured her to the cemetery intending to take her to the mountains and kill her, expecting that if her body was discovered, her death would be deemed to have been suicide. But the attempt to conceal his relationship to her by hiding the mobile phones and O'Hara's personal effects was clear evidence of intent.\\"Dwyer intended to murder Elaine O‚ÄôHara, prosecution says\\", The Irish Times, 20 March, 2015 On 27 March 2015 Dwyer was convicted in a unanimous verdict. Sentencing him to life imprisonment, the judge Tony Hunt stated that he \\"110% agreed\\" with jury's decision.\\"Graham Dwyer guilty: Sadist architect stabbed Dublin woman Elaine O'Hara to death during sex\\", The Belfast Telegraph, 27 March 2015. The jury was exempted from jury duty for 30 years. ==Appeal== During and after the trial, Dwyer's legal team highlighted that the legislation covering the capture and use of the mobile phone data (relied upon by the prosecution in the trial) was invalid. Specifically, Dwyer's legal team have claimed grounds for appeal on the basis that Ireland's Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011, in turn giving effect to the European Data Retention Directive (2006/24/EC), was invalid - because the underlying European Directive had been struck down by the European Court of Justice in 2014. These claims contributed to a review of how state agencies use the type of data covered by the legislation. And, if upheld, it has been reported that the appeal could impact the admissibility of the mobile phone evidence in the Dwyer case - and other cases which rely upon mobile phone data in Garda investigations. ==See also== *List of solved missing persons cases ==References== Murder of Elaine O'Hara O'Hara, Elaine O'Hara, Elaine Murder of Elaine O'Hara Murder of Elaine O'Hara Murder of Elaine O'Hara Category:Crime in Dublin (city) Category:Incidents of violence against women Category:Missing person cases in Ireland Category:Violence against women in Ireland Category:2010s murders in the Republic of Ireland ","title":"Murder of Elaine O'Hara"},{"id":"46290224","text":"Francisco Esparza Hern√°ndez (born 2 April 1941) is a Mexican politician from the National Action Party.

The Pilgrim peaked at No. 5 on the ARIA Hitseekers Albums chart. == Reception == Richard MacDougall of Blues Rock Review rated it at seven-out-of-ten and explained, \\"If you're familiar with Campbell's brand of folk-infused blues played with a shot-glass slide on an old acoustic guitar, don't attach yourself too much to the image ‚Äì on Sunshine Roads follow-up and Campbell's stateside debut [album], things are a little bit grittier, dirtier, and less acoustic.\\" Workin' Man's Blues Ross Carlson felt, \\"[its] downright nasty electric tones that sound like a sputtering dimed out 50's fender combo. Sure it's a little muddy, but after all this is the blues, and it fits the genera well. While the album touches on a variety of genres, tunes like 'Remember to Breathe', 'Wreckin' Ball', 'Leave It Alone' are big full band mid-tempo blues rockers with huge drums, and screaming organ, and Campbell's nearly shouted vocals.\\" Rob Dickens of Listening Through the Lens observed, \\"[He] combines a moving, gutsy, old-time sound that combines a bluesy drawl with a stomping, soulful slide guitar. His no-frills music reveals influences from The Band, Van Morrison, Townes Van Zandt and the raspy emotion of Ray Lamontagne.\\" == Track listing == MGM Distribution (ROCCD0002) Reckless Grace Music (RGM1-120) ==References External links == * Category:Owen Campbell albums Category:2013 albums ","title":"The Pilgrim (Owen Campbell album)"},{"id":"46290392","text":"John Fullington (born May 30, 1991) is an American football guard who is currently a free agent.

He was most well known as the first mayor of Strasbourg who encouraged Rouget de l'Isle to write various patriotic songs, including the song which became known as La Marseillaise, first performed in his living room; he was also known as a scientist, author of a mine survey and the development blast furnaces in France, distinguished geologist and chemist, and member of the Academy of Sciences. As mayor of Strasbourg, he accelerated revolutionary reforms throughout the region. ==Family and early career== Dietrich by Alfred Marzolff, plaque on Place Broglie Dietrich came from an old Protestant family of bankers and foundry owners in Niederbronn, in the Lower Rhine, and Reichshofen. The family was established in Strasbourg, with the 1549 birth of Dominique Didier, who was also known in this bi-lingual territory as Dominick Dietrich. Louis Spach, Frederic de Dietrich, premier maire de Strasbourg., Strasbourgh, Vve. Berger-Levrault & fils, 1857, p. 3. His father, Jean Dietrich (1719-1795, comte Ban de la Roche), was the son of Johann von Dietrich, a foundry owner in Reichshofen. His mother, Am√©lie Hermanny (Anne-Dorothee Hermanni) (1729-1766), was the daughter of a prominent banker.Spach, p. 6. He had one brother, Jean (1746-1805), who married Louise- Sophie de Glaubitz (1751-1806), and established the family's ironworks in Saint Domingue. His own son, Jean-Albert Dietrich (1773-1806), was counselor of Bas-Rhin; he married Am√©lie de Berckheim (1776-1855). His granddaughter married the nephew of his successor as mayor of Strasbourg, William Turckheim (1785-1831), colonel of cavalry in the French army. Ernst Lehr, L'Alsace noble suivie de le livre d'or du patriciat de Strasbourg..., Berger-Levrault, 1870, Volume 3, pp. 172-173. Dietrich attended the Protestant gymnasium in Strasbourg and from 1772 continued his study through European travel. An encyclopaedist, and a Freemason, he embraced the Enlightenment ideals the development ideas of science and technology, gender differences in men without religion or origin, international understanding and peace among peoples. He married Louise Sybille Ochs, sister of Peter Ochs, who became mayor of Basel and a militant supporter of the French-styled revolution in Switzerland in 1798-99\\\\. He received the position of secretary and charge-de-affaires of Swiss and Grisons, bought by his father in 1771. This charge required him to reside in Paris half his time. In 1775, he demonstrated the volcanic origins of the Kaiserstuhl, near Freiburg im Breisgau, and was admitted to the Academy of Sciences in 1786. In 1777 he participated in experiments conducted by Alessandro Volta in Strasbourg, on marsh gas, and brought him membership into the Academy of Sciences, aided by Antoine Lavoisier. They wrote joint articles on the subject. On 11 January 1785, he was appointed commissioner of the king's factories, foundries and forests of the, a position he shared with Barth√©lemy Faujas de Saint-Fond. The creation of this function was necessitated by the depletion of forests and the need to replace wood with coal and coke. In the course of his duties, he compiled the Description of ore bodies and mouths to fire the kingdom in three volumes: the Pyrenees (1786), Upper and Lower Alsace (1788) and the southern Lorraine (written in 1788 but published in 1799). ==Activities during the Revolution== Dietrich was mayor of Strasbourg from March 1790 to August 1792. At his home during a dinner in honor of the officers of the garrison of Strasbourg he asked the Captain Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle, stationed in his city, to write the Song the Army of the Rhine, future La Marseillaise. Rouget de l'Isle composed the song in the night of 24-25 April 1792. According to sources, Dietrich would have sung the song himself, accompanied on the piano by his wife, for he was very good musician. Baron Dietrich knew the Captain Rouget de l'Isle to be like him, a Freemason and attend the same Masonic lodge of Strasbourg. Summoned before the bar of the Convention, which accused him of supporting the refractory priests and especially to have protested against the insurgency days of 20 June-10 August 1792, Dietrich took refuge first in Basel, in the home of his brother-in-law, Peter Ochs, and was taken prisoner. The Jacobins sent him to the court of Besan√ßon on 7 March 1793. He was then transported to Paris, where Maximilien Robespierre considered a \\"dangerous man\\", \\"one of the greatest conspirators of the Republic.\\" Putting pressure on the court, Robespierre declared to the Jacobins: \\"National justice requires that he [Dietrich] be punished, and the interest of the people demand it to be [done] quickly\\". Consequently, the Revolutionary Court sentenced him to death. He was guillotined on 29 December 1793. On 23 August 1795, the National Convention rehabilitated the reputation of Dietrich as a hero of the Revolution. ==Notes, citations, and sources== Category:Mayors of Strasbourg Category:People executed by guillotine during the French Revolution Category:People from Strasbourg Category:French people of German descent Category:1748 births Category:1793 deaths Category:Alsatian people ","title":"Philippe Friedrich Dietrich"},{"id":"46290422","text":"A by-thirds Hyndburn Borough Council local election took place on 7 May 2015.

The film was slated to release on 15 May 2015 with Bombay Velvet but hit the screens on 29 May 2015 to have a solo release. ==Plot== Ishqedarriyaan is a story about love, sacrifice, family values and relationships. Rishteydarriyaan means relationships and Ishqedarriyaan signifies the relationship when one falls in love. Luvleen (Evelyn Sharma) is a teacher by profession who wants to collect donations for her grandfather's school. Aagam Diwan (Mahaakshay Chakraborty) is a millionaire who loves his profession more than anything else. When Aagam meets Luvleen, his love for her is really intense. But he didn't tell her about his feelings because of the wrong allegations against his father. He overcomes many hurdles to see her happy. He created conditions so that Arjun proposes Luvleen and even his father agrees to it. Mohit Dutta will play Arjun, a passionate singer. But in the end, Aagam realises that his father is not the one who did mischief with Luvleen's family. Later Luvleen also realises her love for Aagam and goes all the way to tell him the same.

The Times of India gave 1.5/5 stars to the film saying, \\"Evelyn Sharma for a change is not seen in skimpy outfits but her acting stays consistently poor, Mahaakshay is convincing but the film is way too tedious for you to sit through it. Music and locations are probably the best part about this film. Unfortunately, everything else is mediocre. Overall it turns out to be inconsequential in return. Despite decent production values, Ishqedarriyaan fails to click as it is way too clich√©d. Conventional is fine as long as it leaves some impact on you as an audience, which doesn't happen here.\\" Paloma Sharma of Rediff.com rote \\"The trouble with Ishqedarriyaan is that it isn't even bad enough to be good. It's just plain old dull. Lost in a world of its own, the film forgets to engage the viewer. The makers of the film might need to offer free tea at the screenings to give the audience an incentive to stay awake. The kindest thing I can say about Ishqedarriyaan is that it is yawn worthy.\\" and gave the film 1.5/5 stars. The Indian Express gave 1/5 stars and wrote \\"Mahakshay returns in a badly-written romance, which makes you wonder why anyone would want to repeat the same mistakes. Ishqedarriyan features the age-old triangle of rich boy- poor girl- and third party, in a leaden plot that never takes off. We know who's going to win fair maiden in the end, but we have to wade through two hours and more of sheer tiresomeness to get there. Who is this film made for?\\" Book my Show stated that \\"The love story is sweet, but clich√©d! An overdose of emotional drama makes this romantic saga a bore. A loose script, below par acting and clich√©d romantic scenes, Ishqedarriyaan is a love saga that will bore you for two long hours!

Lead actors Mahaakshay Chakraborty and Evelyn Sharma along with singer Asees Kaur were present. The film was promoted in cities like Indore, Bhopal, Pune (Central Mall), Nagpur, Raipur, Amritsar, Chandigarh, New Delhi and Jaipur. ==Soundtrack== The songs of Ishqedarriyaan were composed by Jeet Gannguli, Jaidev Kumar and Bilal Saeed, while the lyrics were written by Kumaar, Kausar Munir, Manoj Muntashir and Bilal Saeed.

Number of councillors -  Labour  20 -  Conservative 10 -  Liberal Democrats  3 -  UKIP  9 -  Green  0 -  Independent  0 - } No seats changed hands between parties at these council elections, with the exception of a by-election for an additional seat in East Marsh which otherwise wouldn't have been contested again until 2016 that UKIP gained from Labour. The same seat would be vacated only months later by the winning candidate, and was left vacant until the next set of local elections in the authority because it occurred less than six months before the 2016 local elections. In four wards (Humberston and New Waltham, Scartho, South, and West Marsh) elected new councillors as the incumbents did not stand again.

Labour retained the seat in the resultant by-election. East Marsh Note: A by-election was held for an additional seat in the ward, caused by the resignation of councillor Jon-Paul Howarth, whose seat was last contested in 2012. The results meant that Walker (who last contested his seat in 2011) held his seat and was elected for four years, as he would have done if there was no by-election and assuming he won.

Lindley was previously a Labour councillor for West Marsh from 2010 to 2014, but quit the party over not being re-selected for his seat or the seat in which he lived in (Yarborough) and his disagreement with the all-women's shortlist imposed on the Great Grimsby constituency candidate selection for the 2015 general election. South Notes: Stanland resigned little over a year after being elected. He previously contested Humberston and New Waltham as a Liberal Democrat in 2011. The resultant by-election saw Labour hold the seat with a small swing towards them. Hocknell previously represented Heneage ward from 2003 to 2011.

ER found that the men-only focus of the CCC program left out young women who were willing to work in conservation and forestry and to sign up for the six-month programs living away from family and close support. She lobbied for a sister organization to the CCC that would be for young women. Eleanor Roosevelt proposed that this would consist of camps for jobless women and residential worker schools. The She-She-She camps were funded by presidential order in 1933. Labor Secretary Frances Perkins championed one such camp after ER held a White House Conference for Unemployed Women on April 30, 1934, and subsequently ER's concept of a nationwide jobless women's camp was achieved. While the public largely supported the New Deal programs and the CCC was a huge success, the women's version barely topped 5,000 women annually by 1936 and overall served 8,500 as a result of ER's support. == Forestry and conservation == Civilian Conservation Corps poster (1935) President Franklin Roosevelt valued the CCC because it was fueled both by his passion for rural life and the philosophy of William James. James deemed this sort of program the \\"moral equivalent of war,\\" channeling the passion for combat into productive service. Although administered by US Army officers, the camps were designed not to be militaristic since the Administration did not want any resemblance to the Hitler Youth of Germany.

Eleanor Roosevelt fought resistance from the administration, many of whom objected to sending America's unemployed women on what could be described as a government-sponsored vacation in the middle of a depression. ER was troubled by the plight of so many women, many of whom did not show up in the bread-lines but were relegated to living in subway tunnels and \\"tramping\\", foraging for subsistence outside urban areas. ‚ÄúAs a group women have been neglected in comparison with others,‚Äù the First Lady said, ‚Äúand throughout this depression have had the hardest time of all.‚Äù The number of women seeking jobs grew to two million by 1933.

It took several months but, with promotion and work, the first camp got off the ground at Bear Mountain's Camp TERA (Temporary Emergency Relief Assistance), later called Camp Jane Addams. Marian Tinker was selected as its first director. She had gone to High School in Manchester, Massachusetts, before completing her studies at Arnold College in New Haven, Connecticut and the University of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg. As a social worker, she was experienced at working with young women in various organizations like the YWCA and Girl Scouts, as well as several schools. Camp TERA began on June 10, 1933 with 17 young women from New York. Currently Bear Mountain State Park in New York, the site had 12 camps for CCC enrollees in 1934. FDR visited camp sp-20 that year to review the corps. He spent time at the recreation center, mess hall, barracks and camp library, praising the more than 200 enrollees for their hard work. Before leaving, he visited the signature project, a dam across the outlet of the Pine Meadow Valley that created the first of many swimming lakes for tourists, a direct expression of FDR's regard for conservation and forestry. When ER first visited Camp TERA, she found only 30 girls at the 200-acre camp. Smith had planned for 20 girls to arrive twice a week until the capacity of 200 was met. However, massive red tape and confusion prevailed. ER appreciated the camp, but decided the requirements were too strict. She could not believe there were not enough women willing to accept the job and warned that the numbers had to increase or the idea might be abandoned. This put the State relief administration representative, Walter W. Petit, on the hot seat to explain why only 30 of the 700 women who had applied had been selected. Defending the \\"thorough\\" investigation needed some doing and while the program extended eligibility to age 40, blaming the \\"rigorousness of the qualifications for eligibility\\" did not absolve him of his part in delaying the project. Despite the delays, mail supporting Camp TERA poured in to the White House with offers of more properties for the camps and pleas from individuals to attend. Government officials promised support for more camps if Camp TERA succeeded. There were also questions and media attention about the nature of the camps. Some of the women thought that the camp was intended for them to work at reforestation using manual labor and accordingly expected to be given hard work with little to show for it. With the dollar per day given the male enrollees holding back $22‚Äì25 of the monthly $30 for family back home, the offer of work was enticing to those who did not want to pass up the chance of job and with glowing reports coming back from participants, the proponents of She-She-She renewed efforts in the fall of 1933 to expand the program. But in the 1930s many Americans objected to the use of public resources to support individuals, especially women. Many considered that the role of the woman was in the home. Others considered the idea of putting women out in the woods to learn dubious skills just plain wrong.  Critics  Men laboring in CCC camps were highly amused by the female counterpart. Writing for a CCC newspaper, one noted how little work women at Camp TERA did, adding, ‚ÄúSome of the girls are pretty. All are happy. They say they may never want to go back to New York, from where they came. Life has been tough for most of them.‚Äù Pauli Murray, who would later become a lawyer, writer, black civil rights activist and episcopal priest, arrived at Camp TERA on the advice of her doctor at the end of 1933. Living on the edge of poverty and diagnosed with pleurisy, she found her time there cut short after she clashed with the camp's director, Miss Mills. An ambulance driver during World War I and an authoritarian, Mills attempted to run the camp on semi-military lines. Murray had a copy of Das Kapital in her bags and when director Mills found it, she ejected her from the camp. Murray would later become a close friend of Eleanor Roosevelt. That leftist songs were sung at camp sing-alongs became a focus of detractors. It was not surprising that there were leftists in the camps, given that they were not far removed from the \\"Hoovervilles\\", and the troubadour- style of fellow travellers like singer Woody Guthrie fueled these sing-alongs. It also was not surprising that in 1936 controversies over communist influences enveloped the camp. In July 1936, the American Legion of Rockland County accused Camp TERA officials of using Federal funding for communist purposes. The new Director, Bernice Miller, countered the charges, saying that \\"the campers were permitted the completest freedom to say and discuss what they wanted, and sing any songs they wanted to\\". She also was quick to add that most supported the government. As to complaints of the Internationale and radical satires being sung, and that controversial material was being read, some, Miller admitted were \\"of communist and socialist persuasion\\". Also adding to embarrassment, women from Camp TERA \\"escaped\\" and visited a men's CCC camp nearby. A teacher at Camp TERA, Harry Gersh, commented, \\"It was a most unnatural environment for these women. No one had thought that sexual isolation would be a problem\\". After returning home to New York City from Camp TERA, some of the women joined the radical Workers' Alliance. Spokeswoman for the organization Sarah Rosenberg, a vocal critic of the benefit of the She- She-She camps said, \\"More than one girl says there is nothing left except suicide or tramping on the roads\\". == Indigenous pride == Over 90 camps were created across the U.S. by 1936, and over 8,500 women cycled through before they were closed. Each reflected the different cultures indigenous to their locations and depended heavily upon what was available in terms of local resources and talent. There are audio histories of communities cleaning old facilities and donating beds, clothes, food and other staples for the women. Many North Dakota Indian women left the reservation for the very first time to attend camp programs. Oberlin College welcomed stenographers and clerical workers at its Summer School for Office Workers. Barnard College in New York City hosted classes for unemployed unionized women. Black sharecropper women in the south studied at an agricultural college in Arkansas. The YWCA in Philadelphia provided a space for 40 women to study and live. Unemployed professional women in New Jersey attended a specially created program. In Michigan, rented houses provided unemployed women instruction in housekeeping skills. In the Ozarks, women attended literacy classes. ==Details== The personal allowance for women was the same as that for men, $5 per month for personal needs in exchange for 56‚Äì70 hrs work per month on camp work projects. No remittance was sent back home as was the case for the CCC men's allowance. The camps were located where a facility had heat, lighting and sanitary conveniences‚Äîtypically summer hotels, abandoned CCC camps and vacated schools. They were administered by female camp directors, project supervisors, staff teachers and counselors. The average camp had around 100 women, with a supervisory staff of 10‚Äì20 including cooks and a nurse. Each enrollee was assigned fixed hours of work on camp assignments, including working in forest nurseries at some camps. Other made and repaired toys and playground equipment, while some worked at creating visual training aids for public schools. Those with visual disabilities (there were camps for the blind) would make finished bedding or use natural materials to create woven products. Sewing equipment enabled the women to make their own clothing (one popular class was to make dresses from empty cloth feed bags) and no uniforms were required. WPA programs also supplied clothing, and canneries were used as teaching aids and product generation. Layettes and hospital sundries were made for public institutions and other WPA nursing projects. Maintenance of the barracks, housekeeping and kitchen duties along with instruction in economics and cooking were integral to the residential program, which lasted three to four months and was not subject to re-enrollment. The Native American women were paid an additional allotment to find rental housing and travelled with the men who went off the reservation to work. No camps were established exclusively for Native American men, so many travelled as a family group. Blacks were still segregated at this time but in their camps were given the same educational opportunities. The educational program included English, adult education, domestic science, hygiene, public health, and economics. Games, athletic contests, hikes, music, and drama groups were included in the recreational plans and handicraft activities were encouraged. Some camps at schools had typing and secretarial classes. The cost per enrollee was estimated at $39 each, plus $5 which went to personal expenses. They worked to cover food costs (taken from the $5), lodging and medical care. The camps were operated on a year-round basis and eligibility for NYA (National Youth Administration) employment was a requirement. (The NYA took over from the TERA in 1936 in administering FERA (Federal Emergency Relief Administration)). When the housing and shelter crisis eased in 1937, the NYA decided that the women's program was too costly and shut it down. Most of the women approved had led hard lives in the midst of the Depression and found the duties a relief from the meager sustenance in the cities, many embracing the outdoors with a vigor to match that of the young men working in the CCC camps. The She-She-She camps for women closed October 1, 1937.New York Times Article, Sept 16, 1937 The NYA (National Youth Administration) then in charge of the program, criticized the objectives and necessity of the camps and decided it was too expensive. As the crisis of hunger and shelter eased, the camp program for women could not be justified and it ended. Eleanor Roosevelt was never happy with either the women's or the men's camps. She objected to the military aspect of the CCC from the outset, but the success of the CCC and other New Deal programs left her with other anti-poverty programs and women-centered initiatives to pursue. Her vision was a two-year program for young men and women to be devoted to domestic projects such as conservation, health care, education and settlement houses. At the end of 1933, after Camp TERA was established, she had stated, \\"There is nothing more exciting than building a new social order.\\" == References == * Kahramanidis, Jane. \\"The She-She-She Camps of the Great Depression\\".

It was on the eastern side of the River Severn bordering England, on the west it was bordered by two of the other commotes of Ystlyg - Deuddwr in the north and Ystrad Marchell in the south. Its Welsh name could mean \\"the upper water\\"; gor- \\"upper-\\", d≈µr \\"water\\". After the Norman Conquest, Y Gorddwr was claimed by Roger le Corbet, the Baron of Caus within the Marcher Lordship of Roger de Montgomery. In 1241, Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn regained most of the lands lost by his father, Gwenwynwyn ap Owain in about 1216. Gruffydd immediately claimed the territory of Y Gorddwr by ancient inheritance, bringing him into conflict with the Corbet family. He was related to them through his mother, Margaret, who was a sister of Thomas Corbet, the baron of Caus at the time, this added weight to his claim. He inherited his mother's lands in Y Gorddwr in 1246, and appropriated more in 1252 while King Henry III was in dispute with Simon de Montfort. Thomas Corbet brought a legal action against Gruffydd in 1255, the English lords who heard the case found against Gruffydd. In 1257, before Gruffydd could relinquish the land in Y Gorddwr, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd had taken his territory in Powys and forced him into exile in England. King Henry still insisted that he handed the territory he held in Y Gorddwr over to Corbet, so in 1263 Gruffydd transferred his allegiance to Llywelyn, and his lands were returned to him. He fought as an ally of Llywelyn and Simon de Montfort against the king until the defeat and death of Simon at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. In the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267, Llywelyn and Gruffydd agreed to end hostilities with the king. Henry III died in 1272 and Llywelyn renewed hostilities against England, but Gruffydd now took sides against Llywelyn and lost his territories again. In 1274, with his son, Owain and Dafydd ap Gruffudd he was part of an unsuccessful plot to assassinate Llwelyn. He was forced to flee to Shrewsbury from where he led raids against Llywelyn and supported the campaign of Edward I to disinherit Llywelyn. In 1277, Llywelyn was forced to accept terms. Gruffydd was rewarded for supporting Edward and he received back his lands in Powys. He continued, however, to make claims against Peter Corbet for Y Gorddwr, and after his death his family continued to dispute tithes there.

The convention was necessary because Cassidy resigned after the party's poor showing in the 1981 election. Bob Rae was an overwhelming favourite and this continued into the convention which Rae won on the first ballot. Rae went on to lead his party to their first election win in 1990. ==Background== In the 1981 election, the New Democrats lost 11 seats and the Progressive Conservatives under Premier Bill Davis regained majority status. Michael Cassidy resigned after only three years as leader. At the time of Cassidy's departure, Bob Rae was a federal MP from the Toronto riding of Broadview‚ÄîGreenwood. The son of a diplomat and a Rhodes scholar, he was a popular member of the Federal NDP caucus. As finance critic, he had a high-profile role in Ottawa. He said the path he was on was a good one but a bigger challenge was in the Ontario provincial leadership. He said, \\"We have a chance to form the government here, but it won't fall into our laps. I don't underestimate the Tories, believe me; Davis is a formidable opponent. But if we win the confidence of the people, we'll win their votes.\\" Rae's position was seen as that of a pragmatic socialist who had a chance to attract voter attention. He garnered support from 11 caucus members including former leader Donald C. MacDonald as well as many party insiders and the unions. MacDonald said of Rae's candidacy, \\"I have yet to meet anyone who is not an NDPer who has reacted favorably to the idea of Bob Rae as leader.\\" Arrayed against Rae were Richard Johnston and Jim Foulds. Johnston was viewed as a more left wing candidate. A former social worker, he had a forceful personality and a competitive nature. He said that he would focus on party reform and party growth. He cited the Manitoba New Democrats who won under Howard Pawley with just as many party members but only 1/8 the size of the population. He said, \\"We've got to decentralize, develop local issues, increase membership... there's a lot of work to be done.\\" He was supported by three caucus members, Jim Renwick, Floyd Laughren and Ross McClellan. Jim Foulds, a former teacher from Northern Ontario had been a member of the party for ten years and had the most political experience. He was the party's deputy house leader and had acted as critic for education, resources, and energy. However he was seen as an outsider with small chance of success. His platform focused on northern issues such as establishing a Crown corporation in the forest industry and a public takeover of Inco. ==Convention== The convention was held at the Harbour Castle convention centre on the weekend of February 5‚Äì7, 1982. There were 3,400 people in attendance of which 2,100 voted for the leadership. Delegates were chosen in each provincial riding based on a slate system. Riding members voted so that a majority voted to send delegates who would vote for a single candidate. This caused some friction amongst more left-leaning members who felt they would not be selected as delegates because they voiced a minority opinion. There was little suspense as Rae romped to victory with 64% of the vote on the first ballot. He beat Johnston, who was in second place, by 844 votes. Sylvia Stead of the Globe and Mail said that delegates 'voted for him, not because of his stand on issues or his political experience, but because they believe he can win the elusive prize of government.' In addition to the leadership vote, party delegates adopted a range of new policies, some of them controversial. These included a government takeover of key industries and opposition to further nuclear power development. They also voted to support equal representation for women on riding executives and for convention delegations, auto import restrictions, a more equitable tax system and the acceptance of donations from small businesses. There were some lighthearted moments during the convention. Some enterprising soul sold T-shirts that read, \\"Happiness is never having to say you're Tory.\\" ==Aftermath== Rae's immediate concern was to get a seat in the house. The matter was not resolved until Donald C. MacDonald agreed to retire. Rae won his seat in York South on November 4. In the meantime he sat in the visitor's gallery or toured the province. While Rae achieved only minor success in the 1985 provincial election increasing his party to 25 seats from 21, he was instrumental in bringing down the Tory government in June 1985 when he signed an accord with the Liberals under leader David Peterson to support them in government after defeating the Tories on a motion of no confidence. Five years later, in 1990, he led the New Democrats to their first ever government in Ontario when they won 74 seats. ==Ballot results== { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" + Delegate support by ballot - ! colspan = \\"1\\"  Candidate ! colspan = \\"2\\"  1st ballot - Name  Votes cast  % -  Bob Rae  1,356  64.6 -  Richard Johnston  512  24.4 -  Jim Foulds  232  11.0 - Total  2,100  100.0 - } ==References== Category:1982 elections in Canada Category:1982 in Toronto Category:Ontario New Democratic Party leadership elections ","title":"1982 Ontario New Democratic Party leadership election"},{"id":"46290641","text":"thumb300pxrightMap of the results of the 2015 Reading Borough Council election.

A system exhibits Processor Consistency if the order in which other processors see the writes from any individual processor is the same as the order they were issued. Because of this, Processor Consistency is only applicable to systems with multiple processors. It is weaker than the Causal Consistency model because it does not require writes from all processors to be seen in the same order, but stronger than the PRAM Consistency model because it requires Cache Coherence. Another difference between Causal Consistency and Processor Consistency is that Processor Consistency removes the requirements for loads to wait for stores to complete, and for Write Atomicity. Processor Consistency is also stronger than Cache Consistency because Processor Consistency requires all writes by a processor to be seen in order, not just writes to the same memory location. == Examples of Processor Consistency == { border=\\"1\\" class=\\" floatright\\" + Example 1: Processor Consistent ! P  W(x)1  W(x)3   - ! P    R(x)1  R(x)3 - ! P  W(y)1  W(y)2   - ! P    R(y)1  R(y)2 } { border=\\"1\\" class=\\" floatright\\" + Example 2: Not Processor Consistent ! P  W(x)1  W(x)3   - ! P    R(x)3  R(x)1 - ! P  W(y)1  W(y)2   - ! P    R(y)2  R(y)1 } In Example 1 to the right, the simple system follows Processor Consistency, as all the writes by each processor are seen in the order they occurred in by the other processors, and the transactions are coherent. Example 2 is NOT Processor Consistent, as the writes by P1 and P3 are seen out of order by P2 and P4 respectively. In Example 3 below, the strongest applicable consistency model is Processor Consistency. This is trivial to determine because there is only at most one write per processor. This example is not causally consistent, however, because R(x)1 in P2 can potentially cause W(x)2 in P2, we can establish that W(x)1 in P1 causally precedes W(x)2 in P2. However, P3 and P4 do not agree on the order of the two writes by P1 and P2. The system in Example 4 is not processor consistent, because some writes by the same processor are seen out of order by other processors. More specifically, writes to a single location are seen in order, but W(x)2 by P1 is not seen before W(y)4 by P2. The fact that the only writes seen in order are writes to the same memory location limits this example to Cache Consistency. { border=\\"1\\"  + Example 3: Causal: No; Processor: Yes ! P  W(x)1     - ! P   R(x)1  W(x)2   - ! P     R(x)1  R(x)2 - ! P     R(x)2  R(x)1 } { border=\\"1\\"  + Example 4: Processor: No; Cache: Yes ! P  W(x)2  W(y)4  W(x)3  W(y)1   - ! P    R(y)4  R(x)2  R(y)1  R(x)3 } == Processor Consistency vs. Sequential Consistency == Processor Consistency (PC) relaxes the ordering between older stores and younger loads that is enforced in Sequential consistency (SC). This allows loads to be issued to the cache and potentially complete before older stores, meaning that stores can be queued in a write buffer without the need for load speculation to be implemented (the loads can continue freely). In this regard, PC performs better than SC because recovery techniques for failed speculations aren‚Äôt necessary, which means fewer pipeline flushes. The prefetching optimization that SC systems employ is also applicable to PC systems. Prefetching is the act of fetching data in advance for upcoming loads and stores before it is actually needed, to cut down on load/store latency. Since PC reduces load latency by allowing loads to be re- ordered before corresponding stores, the need for prefetching is somewhat reduced, as the prefetched data will be used more for stores than for loads. == Programmer‚Äôs Intuition == In terms of how well a PC system follows a programmer‚Äôs intuition, it turns out that in properly synchronized systems, the outcomes of PC and SC are the same. Programmer‚Äôs intuition is essentially how the programmer expects the instructions to execute, usually in what is referred to as ‚Äúprogram order.‚Äù Program order in a multiprocessor system is the execution of instructions resulting in the same outcome as a sequential execution. The fact that PC and SC both follow this expectation is a direct consequence of the fact that corresponding loads and stores in PC systems are still ordered with respect to each other. For example, in lock synchronization, the only operation whose behavior is not fully defined by PC is the lock-acquire store, where subsequent loads are in the critical section and their order affects the outcome. This operation, however, is usually implemented with a store conditional or atomic instruction, so that if the operation fails it will be repeated later and all the younger loads will also be repeated. All loads occurring before this store are still ordered with respect to the loads occurring in the critical section, and as such all the older loads have to complete before loads in the critical section can run. == Processor Consistency vs Other Relaxed Consistency Models == Processor consistency, while weaker than sequential consistency, is still in most cases a stronger consistency model than is needed. This is due to the number of synchronization points inherent to programs that run on multiprocessor systems. This means that no data races can occur (a data race being multiple simultaneous accesses to memory location where at least one access is a write). With this in mind, it is clear to see that a model could allow for reorganization of all memory operations, as long as no operation crosses a synchronization point and one does, called Weak Ordering. However, weak ordering does impose some of the same restrictions as processor consistency, namely that the system must remain coherent and thus all writes to the same memory location must be seen by all processors in the same order. Similar to weak ordering, the release consistency model allows reordering of all memory operations, but it gets even more specific and breaks down synchronization operations to allow more relaxation of reorders. Both of these models assume proper synchronization of code and in some cases hardware synchronization support, and so processor consistency is a safer model to adhere to if one is unsure about the reliability of the programs to be run using the model. == Similarity to SPARC V8 TSO, IBM-370, and x86-TSO Memory Models == One of the main components of processor consistency is that if a write followed by a read is allowed to execute out of program order. This essentially results in the hiding of write latency when loads are allowed to go ahead of stores. Since many applications function correctly with this structure, systems that implement this type of relaxed ordering typically appear sequentially consistent. Two other models that conform to this specification are the SPARC V8 TSO (Total Store Ordering) and the IBM-370. The IBM-370 model follows the specification of allowing a write followed by a read to execute out of program order, with a few exceptions. The first is that if the operations are to the same location, they must be in program order. The second is that if either operation is part of a serialization instruction or there is a serialization instruction between the two operations, then the operations must execute in program order. This model is perhaps the strictest of the three models being considered, as the TSO model removes one of the exceptions mentioned. The SPARC V8 TSO model is very similar to the IBM-370 model with the key difference that it allows operations to the same location to complete out of program order. With this, it is possible that a load returns a store that occurred that is ‚Äúout of date‚Äù in terms of program order. These models are similar to processor consistency, but whereas these models only have one copy of memory, processor consistency has no such restriction. This suggests a system in which each processor has its own memory, which emphasizes upon processor consistency the ‚Äúcoherence requirement.\\" The x86-TSO model has a number of different definitions. The total store model, as the name suggests, is very similar to the SPARC V8. The other definition is based on local write buffers. The differences in the x86 and SPARC TSO models is in the omission of some instructions and inclusion of others, but the models themselves are very similar. The write buffer definition utilizes various states and locks to determine whether a particular value can be read/written to. In addition, this particular model for the x86 architecture is not plagued by the issues of previous (weaker consistency) models, and provides a more intuitive base for programmers to build upon. == See also == * Serializability ==References== Category:Consistency models ","title":"Processor consistency"},{"id":"46290733","text":"Elachista metallica is a moth in the family Elachistidae.

It was released on 2 March 2015 through Because Music and Babycat Records. Produced by Ross Robinson, the album features contributions from singer-songwriter Ariel Pink, Revolver guitarist Ambroise Willaume and Warpaint drummer Stella Mozgawa. The album is a stylistic departure from Soko's early folk-oriented work and takes influences from new wave, gothic rock, post-punk and 80's pop music. ==Background== Prior to the recording, Soko tried to contact with The Cure singer and guitarist Robert Smith to ask him to produce her record. She sent a letter to Smith through producer Ross Robinson, who produced The Cure's 2004 self-titled album. Robinson eventually produced the album himself and it was recorded at his Venice Beach studio. Ariel Pink performed on two songs on the album, after Soko guested on two tracks for his 2014 studio album, pom pom. \\"Monster Love\\" was the first track written for the album. It was written after shooting a promo video for the track, \\"I Just Want to Make It New With You\\", from her previous album. Soko wrote the track to fill the video narrative after shooting too much footage she liked. The music video for the track Lovetrap was realised on 23 March 2015. The video futures Soko playing both herself and Ariel Pink. Pink also makes a cameo appearance. ==Critical reception== Los Angeles Times critic Randall Roberts gave a positive review to the album, writing: \\"Hardly an innovation in sound, My Dreams nonetheless sticks because of the artist's way with tone, texture and structure. These are good songs, the kind that linger.\\" Roberts also stated that Soko was \\"mining retro synths, echoed guitar tones suggestive of New Order and the Cure and hitting the mark without sounding (too) derivative,\\" and noted the Waitresses and The B-52's influences. John Murphy of musicOMH also noted the influence of The Cure and '80s alternative rock over the record, stating that \\"so gloomy and claustrophobic does it become at times that you fully expect Robert Smith to hove into view.\\" Murphy also concluded: \\"Although My Dreams Dictate My Reality may not be a perfect return to form, there‚Äôs enough quality gathered on it to make us grateful that she had a re-think.\\" ==Track listingPersonnel== Credits adapted from AllMusic. * Soko ‚Äì vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards, drums, drum machine, layout, photography, production * Leo Abrahams ‚Äì additional production, engineering, guitar, hurdy-gurdy * Daniel Anderson ‚Äì bass * Mike Balboa ‚Äì engineering * Ryan Baxley ‚Äì design, layout * Natalia Bonifaccis ‚Äì photography * Michel Comte ‚Äì cover photo * Jean Cook ‚Äì violin * Gregg Foreman ‚Äì bass * Kenneth Gilmore ‚Äì drums, guitar, mixing * Maxime Le Guil ‚Äì additional production, engineering * Steve Krolikowski ‚Äì synthesizer * Ryan Lallier ‚Äì drums, guitar * Josh Lattanzi ‚Äì guitar * Stephen Marcussen ‚Äì mastering * Ben McConnell ‚Äì drums * Stella Mozgawa ‚Äì additional production, drums, engineering, guitar * Simon Oscroft ‚Äì bass, guitar, backing vocals * Christine Owman ‚Äì cello, musical saw * Ariel Pink ‚Äì vocals, bass, keyboards * Ross Robinson ‚Äì production, engineering * Maxime Sokolinski ‚Äì photography * Ambroise Willaume ‚Äì guitar ==Chart positions== { !Charts (2015) !Peak position - Belgian Albums (Ultratop Wallonia)Soko - My Dreams Dictate My Reality on Ultratop align=\\"center\\"68 - French Albums Chart align=\\"center\\"75 } ==References * Category:2015 albums Category:Because Music albums Category:Albums produced by Ross Robinson Category:Post-punk albums by French artists Category:New wave albums by French artists Category:Gothic rock albums by French artists Category:Soko (singer) albums ","title":"My Dreams Dictate My Reality"},{"id":"46290812","text":"Albino Bernardini (18 October 1917 ‚Äì 31 March 2015) was an Italian writer and pedagogue.

He currently plays lead for the Swedish national team, skipped by Niklas Edin. == Curling career == Career beginnings As a junior curler, Sundgren played for two curling teams before he entered university. At age 16, he played in Sveg, curling in the third position for a team skipped by Johan Eriksson. The following year, he joined the team based in Lit and led by brothers Kristian Lindstr√∂m and Alexander Lindstr√∂m and rounded out by Henrik Leek. In 2008, the team invited Oskar Eriksson to join, who eventually took over the role of skip while playing in the third position. With the newly formed team, Sundgren played lead and competed at the 2009 World Junior Curling Championships, finishing in third place in the standings after the preliminary rounds but in fourth place overall, losing to the US team in the semifinal and the bronze medal game, though they had defeated the US team earlier in the tournament. The team had immediate success on the junior tour and also scored wins in the senior division. Sundgren began his university studies in Karlstad in the autumn of 2009 and played with various teams during this period. In the 2010‚Äì2011 season, he played with three separate teams. For the Elite Series, he skipped the Karlstad team vacated in 2008 by Oskar Eriksson, joining Oskar's brother Markus Eriksson, as well as Marcus Franz√©n and Henric Jonsson in forming Team Sundgren. He also skipped the Swedish team at the 2011 Winter Universiade, leading the team of Alexander Nordgren, Axel Rosander and Johan Spiik, though the team ended the tournament in 8th place.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling_at_the_2011_Winter_Universiade Sundgren skipped his own team, Lag Sundgren, for Karlstad in the Swedish Men's Junior Curling Championships, losing an extremely close final to his former teammates Oskar Eriksson, Kristian Lindstr√∂m, Alexander Lindstr√∂m, and Henrik Leek. He rejoined them for the 2011 World Junior Curling Championships, winning the gold medal. Though Sundgren was formally an alternate and did not play any games in the round-robin, he played the pivotal winning games in the semifinal and the final when Henrik Leek was under the weather and was essential to the gold medal victory.  Seniors (2011‚Äìpresent)  In 2011, Sundgren rejoined his former team in Lit for much of the season while Alexander Lindstr√∂m was recovering from surgery, helping them finish in first place in Sweden's national Elite Series tour (though coming in second in the finals). Sundgren played with the team on much the international seniors' tour for the first half of the year and again the end of the season at the European Masters., For the 2012‚Äì2013 season, Sundgren was the full-time lead for Team Eriksson when the team relocated to Karlstad, joined also by Markus Eriksson as second, as both Alexander Lindstr√∂m and Henrik Leek took a step back from curling. With the newly reorganized team, Sundgren and his teammates won the Swiss Cup Basel (2012) and European Masters (2013), as well as the Winter Universiade (2013). In the 2013-14 season, Team Eriksson reached second place at the Swiss Cup Basel, Mercure Perth Masters, and Sweden's Elite Series and competed in Canada on the World Curling Tour, coming in fifth place in three events and reaching their first Grand Slam Quarterfinal at the National. Winning the Swedish Men's Curling Championships that year as well, the team was selected to represent Sweden in the 2014 World Men's Curling Championship, as Team Edin had represented Sweden in the European Curling Championships. Though the team lost to Team Norway in the final, they defeated Team Canada, skipped by Kevin Koe twice in the event. Beginning in the 2014‚Äì2015 season, Niklas Edin joined forces with Sundgren, Eriksson and Kristian Lindstr√∂m to become Sweden's new national team, after Sebastian Kraupp and Fredrik Lindberg took a break from full-time curling. In May 2014, the team decided that Edin would take the skip's position, with Oskar Eriksson playing third, Kristian Lindstr√∂m playing second and Sundgren holding the lead position.. When Lindstr√∂m underwent surgery in 2016, Rasmus Wran√• took over as second. From the start, however, the new Team Edin team immediately saw their increased potential and aimed to become the number one team in the world. Indeed, Team Edin was ranked first at the end of the 2016‚Äì17 curling season on both lists and finished in first place on the prize money list in the 2017-18 curling season. The team also reached the finals of the European Curling Championships every year since forming a new team, winning gold in all years but one (2014-2017 and 2019) and winning silver once (2018). The team also secured medals in the finals of the World Curling Championships every year except 2016, winning three gold (2015, 2018 and 2019) and one silver (2017). As part of Team Edin, Sundgren and his teammates have been consistently ranked in the top ten teams in the world since they joined forces, due to their performance in Canada and around the world. The team has reached the playoffs in 20 Grand Slam of Curling Events. In the 2016-17 curling season, Team Edin had their most successful year on tour, winning three Slams (the Masters, the Tour Challenge, and the Players‚Äô Championship) and reaching the finals (the Canadian Open) and semifinals (the National and Champions Cup), securing the Pinty‚Äôs Cup. The Team has also won several other World Curling Tour events, including the European Masters (2014), Swiss Cup Basel (2016, 2018), Baden Masters (2015, 2017), Curling Masters Champery (2016, 2017), and Perth Masters (2018). Team Edin has also won the Swedish Men's Curling Championships six times between 2014 and 2020, skipping the 2017 championships to prepare for the World Championships.  Career achievements  As of this writing, Sundgren's achievements with Team Eriksson and Team Niklas Edin have so far earned him a total of three gold medals and two silver medals at the World Curling Championships and five gold medals and one silver at the European Curling Championships.

From 1923 to 1927 he studied at the Fine Arts Academy in Istanbul. Following this he went to Paris and studied sculpture with Henri Bouchard and Charles Despiau. In 1930 he returned to Istanbul and the Fine Arts Academy to become an assistant teacher. He visited Paris between 1949 and 1950, after which he ceased to create figural works and instead turned to creating non- figural sculpture.

At 11:40 p.m., on 14 April 1912 the RMS Titanic hit an iceberg. The collision opened five of her watertight compartments to the sea; the ship gradually filled with water and by 2:20 a.m., she broke apart and foundered, with well over one thousand people still aboard. Two hours after Titanic foundered, the Cunard liner RMS Carpathia arrived and took aboard an estimated 705 survivors. There was worldwide shock at the huge loss of life and the procedural errors that had led to it. Public inquiries in Britain and the United States led to major improvements in maritime safety. One of their most important legacies was the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which still governs maritime safety today. Additionally, several new wireless regulations were passed around the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications‚Äîwhich could have saved many more passengers. Primary to these improved regulations were the installation of radio equipment on ALL ships, fixed Distress frequencies and 24-hour watch on those frequencies. During the forty years that the college was in operation students studied the SOLAS Radio Procedures & Regulations, MRGC (Maritime Radiocommunications General Certificate including Morse Code), SCOTVEC (Maintenance of Radar Equipment), and the maintenance and repair of Maritime Radio and Radar equipment. ==References * International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, Treaty in ECOLEX-the gateway to environmental law (English) * Facebook group for ex-students from Wray Castle College Category:1958 establishments in England Category:1998 disestablishments in England Category:British Merchant Navy Category:Lake District Category:Westmorland ","title":"RMS Wray Castle"},{"id":"46290910","text":"Elachista falaxella is a moth in the family Elachistidae.

He briefly served as acting Minister of Culture of China at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, before being persecuted and imprisoned for nine years. ==Early life and wartime career== Xiao Wangdong was born in August 1910 in Ji'an County, Jiangxi province. His original name was Xiao Huicun (), and he also used the name Xiao Ke (). He joined the Communist Youth League in November 1927. In July 1929, he joined the Communist Party of China and the Red Army. In October 1934, he participated in the Long March, and reached northern Shaanxi a year later. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Xiao served as Director of the Political Department of the Fourth Division of the New Fourth Army, under commander Peng Xuefeng, and then the same position in the Second Division based in the Huai River region, under commander Luo Binghui. During the subsequent Chinese Civil War, he participated in several major battles in East China. ==People's Republic of China== From April 1949 to November 1952, Xiao Wangdong served as Communist Party Secretary of Subei (northern Jiangsu) region, and political commissar of the Subei Military District, under commander Zhang Zhendong. From November 1952 to July 1953, he was deputy Communist Party Chief of Jiangu province. From 1953 to 1965 he served in the East China Military Region, later Nanjing Military Region, as a political commissar. In September 1955, he was among the first group of PLA commanders to be awarded the rank of lieutenant general. In April 1965, Xiao Wangdong was appointed Vice Minister of Culture of China, under minister Lu Dingyi. After Lu Dingyi was purged at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Xiao became the acting minister in May 1966. Although Xiao was a military official, he followed Liu Shaoqi and attempted to limit the disruptions of the radical Red Guards. In February 1967 he was denounced as a counterrevolutionary and capitalist roader. He was purged and subsequently imprisoned for nine years. His superior Tao Zhu, who sought to protect him, was also purged. Xiao was politically rehabilitated at the end of the Cultural Revolution and became Political Commissar of the Jinan Military Region from 1976 to 1982. He was also elected as an alternate member of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (1977‚àí82). He became a member of the Central Advisory Commission in 1982, and was re-elected in 1987.

The watershed of the stream has an area of approximately . A dammed lake known as Mountain Lake is in the watershed. The stream flows through an underground culvert system in its lower reaches, but its upper reaches are forested and relatively unimpacted. ==Course== Mountain Lake Run begins near Mountain Lake in Scranton. It flows downhill to the Mattes Community Center and eventually enters a culvert near river mile 1 and remains in a culvert system for much of the remainder of its length. On the other side of Interstate 81, it turns southwest for several tenths of a mile and crosses a number of streets before turning northwest. A short distance further downstream, it reaches its confluence with Stafford Meadow Brook. ==Geography and geology== The elevation near the mouth of Mountain Lake Run is above sea level. Where Mountain Lake has a natural channel, it is wide. In these reaches, its streambank is shallow, with a depth of approximately . There are also numerous rock ledges and splash pools. A total of 30 percent of the stream is on impervious surfaces. There are stone walls from the time of the Works Progress Administration at one point in the watershed of Mountain Lake Run. It also flows through a culvert system for a substantial part of its length in its lower reaches, beginning below Wintermantle Avenue. The culvert system also crosses Interstate 81 and Moltke Avenue. ==Watershed== The watershed of Mountain Lake Run has an area of approximately . It is a first-order stream. Mountain Lake Run is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Scranton. The watershed of Mountain Lake Run contains low- density residential land, open spaces, and some forested land. Most of the watershed contains native mixed hardwood trees, but there is some impact from coal mining in its upper reaches. The upper reaches of the watershed are undeveloped. However, neighborhoods in the watershed include Mountain Lake Estates, Robinson Park, and Bolus subdivision. A pond known as Mountain Lake is in the upper reaches of the watershed of Mountain Lake Run. It has an area of and is fed by springs. It also received an impoundment berm from the East Mountain Coal Company in the late 19th century. ==History== Mountain Lake Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on January 1, 1990. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1202408. It was added because it appeared on Patton's Philadelphia and Suburbs Street and Road Map, which was published in 1984. The old corridor of the Erie and Wyoming Valley Railroad is in the watershed of Maple Lake Run. Around 1938, the Works Progress Administration created stone walls and culverts on the stream near the Mattes Community Center. The daylighting of Mountain Lake Run was proposed in 2013. A report suggested doing it while widening Interstate 81 but noted that it might not be cost-effective. ==Biology== The riparian area of Mountain Lake Run contains native plants such as red oak, witch hazel, and mountain laurel. There are also small patches of meadow land with native grasses and herbaceous plants such as little bluestem. ==See also== *List of rivers of Pennsylvania *List of tributaries of the Lackawanna River ==NotesReferences== Category:Rivers of Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania Category:Tributaries of the Lackawanna River Category:Rivers of Pennsylvania ","title":"Mountain Lake Run"},{"id":"46291057","text":"Browse Trist (1698?-1777), of Bowden, near Totnes, Devon, was an English politician.

Built around 1912, it was one of the first buildings in Cherry Grove and constructed for Frederick Marquet. It is typical of early buildings on Fire Island. It was acquired by theater director Frank Carrington in 1927, who enlarged the house. Under his ownership, the house was a popular refuge for LGBT artists like Truman Capote; Breakfast at Tiffany's was written there. ==History== Fire Island is a barrier island off the southern shore of Long Island in New York. In 1869, the Long Island Rail Road expanded to Patchogue, across the bay from Fire Island. The first settlement on the island was Cherry Grove. Ferries were built to accommodate visitors, and by the early twentieth century, Fire Island hosted several resorts. Middle-class families built small vacation cottages like the Carrington House. In the 1920s, Fire Island became a popular destination for the gay population of New York City. The isolation of the island made it an ideal retreat to escape the crowds of the city. Frank Carrington was born in 1894 and had been interested in the theater from a young age. He became a theater director and co-founded the Cherry Lane Theatre in New York City. He began his greatest work, the creation of Millburn's Paper Mill Playhouse, in 1934. In 1927, he purchased this cottage on Fire Island from Frederick Marquet, a fellow resident of Millburn, New Jersey. At the time, the cottage was a rectangular, three bay bungalow. Carrington made two wood-frame additions around 1940. In the 1940s, he allegedly purchased two outbuildings from a nearby Lifesaving Station and added them to the property. Carrington was active in the growing arts community of Cherry Grove. He rented the property to his friends in the community, including Truman Capote. In 1957, Capote developed a novella there that would become Breakfast at Tiffany's. Other guests included New York City Ballet co-founder Lincoln Kerstein, fashion designer Bill Blass, actor Henry Fonda, actress Gertrude Lawrence, and actress Katharine Hepburn. Carrington owned the house for almost fifty years, then sold it to the US government as part of Fire Island National Seashore under the condition that he be able to live there for the rest of his life; he died on July 3, 1975. National Park Service Ranger Bob Freda lived there for the next twenty years. The Carrington House is probably the oldest surviving building in Cherry Grove. It was recognized with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places on January 8, 2014. It is one of five sites so recognized due for its role in LBGT history, although almost 400 other candidates have been identified. ==See also== *Cherry Grove Community House and Theatre ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Brookhaven (town), New York Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1912 Category:LGBT historic places in the United States Category:LGBT history in New York (state) Category:1912 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Carrington House"},{"id":"46291084","text":"Olaka Nwogu (born 26 January 1965) is a Nigerian civil servant and politician who was a member of the House of Representatives from 1999 until 2011 for People's Democratic Party.

In a take on the Robert Frost poem of the same name, the game is described as being about life's surprises, both positive and negative. ==Gameplay== Road Not Taken combines roguelike and puzzle game elements with the hopes of exploring surprises in accordance to the game's theme. As players explore, they will come across wild animals, impassable barriers, lost children and other objects. An object's use is not explained upfront, players are encouraged to learn about each object's use as they discover them, in traditional roguelike fashion. ==Development== In development since at least 2013, the game was officially announced for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in August 2013. Developer David Edery cited recent games FTL: Faster Than Light and Don't Starve as inspirations for the game. Writing at the PlayStation.Blog, Edery explained the formulas the team used for creating the gameplay: randomness and hand crafted puzzles were used in conjunction. Spry Fox organized a competition asking fans to submit audio of what they think a \\"spry fox\\" would say, the winner would be used for an in- game spry fox character. Spry Fox showed the game at PAX East in 2014 before launching on August 5. Despite the game's original announcement containing a release on PlayStation Vita, that version of the game has not been released. ==Reception== Road Not Taken received mixed reviews from critics, with a score on review aggregator Metacritic of 70/100. Critics generally praised the art and themes, but were divided on the design choices. Writing for PlayStation LifeStyle, Dyani Wood felt the game \\"proved to be a very unique game for its genre\\" and concluded it's \\"a great game to have in your PS4 library.\\" In a mixed review for Game Informer, Matt Miller enjoyed seeing randomized puzzles with each playthrough, but felt the \\"sense of repetition on similar (even if not identical) puzzles isn‚Äôt worth the trade-off.\\" Others praised the random generation, but felt the game was too short. Some reviewers felt the game was an \\"acquired taste\\" and \\"not for every gamer.\\" Some pointed to the randomized gameplay management as a reason for this. Spry Fox responded to feedback on the game's difficulty, releasing a patch in December 2014 adding various fixes and gameplay additions. ==References * Category:2014 video games Category:Indie video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Art games Category:MacOS games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Cancelled PlayStation Vita games Category:Video games using procedural generation ","title":"Road Not Taken"},{"id":"46291216","text":"Miguel Filipe Nunes Cardoso (born 19 June 1994) is a Portuguese footballer who plays for Belenenses SAD on loan from Russian club FC Dynamo Moscow as a winger. ==Club career== Born in S√£o Sebasti√£o da Pedreira, Lisbon, Cardoso finished his formation with Real S.C. in 2012, after having represented four other clubs including S.L.

Home games were at South Lake Tahoe Ice Arena. The team was founded by Chris Collins in 2012 as the Bay Area Seals and played out of the Cow Palace in Daly City, California. After scheduling issues concerning the continued use of the Cow Palace as a home rink, the franchise was moved to South Lake Tahoe to start the 2013‚Äì14 season with help from Greg Jamison, former President and CEO of the National Hockey League's San Jose Sharks, and Van Oleson, owner of Tahoe Sports Entertainment, which runs South Lake Tahoe Ice Arena. ==History== Bay Area Seals (2012‚Äì2013) After a start to the team's first season that saw them earn only 3 wins in their first 18 games, the Seals would finish strong and earn second place in the Pacific Division and their first Thorne Cup playoff appearance. The Seals would make a strong playoff run but would lose the Thorne Cup Championship game to Idaho Jr. Steelheads by a final score of 2-4. By finishing as runner-up in playoffs, the Seals were invited to be the second of the WSHL's representatives (along with the Jr. Steelheads) at the 2013 United Hockey Union National Championship Tournament. In the three-game round-robin stage of the tournament, the Seals would lose to the Lake George Fighting Spirit of the Northern States Hockey League (NSHL) before beating the Hartland Hounds and Tennyson Chevrolets, both of the Midwest Junior Hockey League (MWJHL), to move on to the tournament's semi-final round. They beat the NSHL's Syracuse Stampede before losing the UHU National Championship game to the Jr. Steelheads by a score of 1-5.

The team would relocate to South Lake Tahoe and call themselves the Lake Tahoe Blue for the 2013‚Äì14 season after owner Chris Collins sold the team to Tahoe Hockey Partners, LLC. Collins continued on as the team's general manager for the remainder of the season. After a sub-par 2013-14 season, Collins would be replaced with Michael Richardson, who had also been hired as head coach, while Spencer Jamison, son of Greg Jamison, would take over the position of President. The 2014‚Äì15 season would also leave the Blue out of playoff position. On April 20, 2015, it was announced that the team had changed its name to the Tahoe Icemen. On May 4, 2015, the Icemen announced the hiring of Tom Maroste as head coach and general manager for the 2015‚Äì16 season. After one season, in which the Icemen won only two games, Maroste was replaced by former professional hockey player Mickey Lang. Prior to the 2018‚Äì19 season, the team announced it would be going dormant with the possibility of return for the 2019‚Äì20 season. It was claimed that the South Lake Tahoe Ice Arena was having maintenance issues and that during the dormancy, the ice plant could be repaired. ==Season-by-season records== {   - ! Season !! GP !!

It is tall, deep, and wide, and was once the gateway to the estate.Gray, Christopher \\"Streetscapes: Seaman-Drake Arch; Encrusted Relic of a Mid-19th-Century Inwood Estate\\" The New York Times (June 5, 1988) Today, the arch, which is said to be modeled on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, is partially obscured from view by low-rise commercial buildings, and has been tagged by graffitists; its soft marble facade is decaying. The south side of the structure is used for storage by the transmission repair shop it is behind. ==History and description== The Seaman family, led by Captain John Seaman, emigrated from the United Kingdom and settled in what is now Hempstead on Long Island in 1647 or 1653. The family eventually acquired there.Renner, James. \\"Seaman-Drake Arch\\" Hudson Heights Owners Coalition website In 1851 John Ferris Seaman\\"John Ferris Seaman\\" and his brother Valentine - the sons of Dr. Valentine Seaman, who in the early 1800s was one of the men who brought Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine to the United States - bought of hilltop property in Upper Manhattan near Kingsbridge Road (now Broadway), between what would become West 214th and 218th Streets.\\"Inwood, Manhattan\\" Forgotten NY (January 31, 2010) The site was about a half-mile north of the Dyckman homestead, and the property ran down to Spuyten Duyvil Creek. At the top of the hill, the Seamans built a marble mansion around 1855, apparently intending it as a country home, as the family had another residence in lower Manhattan. The mansion originally featured a domed tower, but this was later converted into a square one. The arch was built from the same marble as the house, and stood at the beginning of a road which wound up and around the hill to the mansion. It originally had large iron gates, the pivots for which are still extant, and probably quarters inside for a gatekeeper. The arch has two niches intended for statues, which are now empty. The Seaman-Drake mansion and arch in 1903 The mansion house, sometimes referred to as the \\"Seaman Castle\\", - and the estate as \\"Seaman's Folly\\"Thompson, Cole. \\"Seaman-Drake Arch\\" My Inwood - was principally occupied by John Ferris Seaman, a merchant, who married Ann Drake.

The estate originally had a large marble stable, but additional stables and sheds were added for the use of the members' horses. The interior of the mansion was altered for its new role as a clubhouse, with bedrooms becoming private dining rooms, dining halls and parlors becoming a caf√© and reception area, and the house's conservatory becoming a smoking and sun room. The club spent more than $10,000 in the conversion from residence to clubhouse. The club would undoubtedly have found the mansion's location convenient, as it was near the Harlem Speedway, which was built in 1894-98 from West 155th Street to Dyckman Street for the exclusive use of horse-drawn carriages and horseback riders.Robinson, Lauren. \\"How Harlem River Speedway Became Harlem River Drive\\" Museum of the City of New York (February 28, 2012) In 1905, the house was sold to Thomas Dwyer, who lived in the mansion and used the quarters in the arch for his business, which he christened the Marble Arch Company. Dwyer was a contractor, and is known for having built the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument and part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

It played an important part in the development of Cherry Grove as a LGBT town. ==History== Fire Island is a barrier island off the southern shore of Long Island in New York state. In 1869, the Long Island Rail Road expanded to nearby Patchogue, initiating settlement on Fire Island. Ferries were built to accommodate visitors, and by the early nineteenth century, Fire Island hosted several resorts, including Cherry Grove. By the late 1920s, the island was a popular and welcoming destination for the LGBT community. Cherry Grove formed a homeowners' association as a de facto government of the unincorporated community. In 1944, this group met at Duffy's Hotel to become the Cherry Grove Property Owners Association, which featured committees on finance, art, the beach, and fire prevention. At a meeting of this group on September 29, 1945, members agreed to a plan to purchase a carriage house to convert to a community house. Following renovations, a meeting on January 25, 1946 established a board of directors, including association president Earl Blackwell. The community house was used for municipal government, including elections. It also hosted social activities, such as religious functions and fairs. Residents donated goods for use in the building. At a September 1948 board meeting, the Property Owners Association founded an \\"Artistic Activity Group.\\" This group held theatrical performances at the community house; at the time, live theater was otherwise absent from the island. Saturday night shows became regular to meet demand. Veteran theater performers and directors such as Frank Carrington (founder of the Paper Mill Playhouse), Cheryl Crawford (co-founded the Actors Studio), and novelist Carson McCullers provided creative direction. Broadway and Hollywood actors and actresses such as Peggy Fears, Nancy Walker, and Betty Garde performed at the shows. Another fundraiser in 1948 financed a large addition to the theater. The theater provided a creative haven for the homosexual residents of Cherry Grove and their guests, where productions would openly address homosexual community issues. The Cherry Grove Theatre is the oldest continually operating gay summer theater in the United States. It was recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places on June 4, 2013. It is one of only five sites listed because of its association with LGBT history. However, almost 400 other such sites have been identified as candidates. ==See also== *Carrington House ==References== Functional link for article 2: Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1948 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Brookhaven (town), New York Category:LGBT historic places in the United States Category:LGBT history in New York (state) ","title":"Cherry Grove Community House and Theatre"},{"id":"46291330","text":"The 2015 Houston Cougars football team represented the University of Houston in the 2015 NCAA Division I FBS football season.

In 1933, she married Gr√©goire de Perlinghi, a Belgian doctor, after breaking her engagement to her Chinese fianc√©, and they went to live in Herbeumont. In 1939, one source suggests that she travelled to Paris in hopes of studying in Marie Curie's laboratory but (so it is suggested) the whole facility had been moved to the United States because of the war. Qian marrying Gr√©goire de Perlinghi in 1933 In June 1940, her town of Herbeumont was occupied by the German army when a Belgian youth blew up a military train by burying a mine under the railway. The youth was sentenced to death, but Qian realised that she knew the German general who was in charge of Belgium. She had known General Alexander von Falkenhausen when he was working in China as part of the Sino-German cooperation. Falkenhausen had been an advisor to Chiang Kai-shekAlexander von Falkenhausen, spartacus-educational.com, retrieved 1 April 2015 and he worked closely with Qian's elder cousin, Lieutenant General Qian Zhuolun. She wrote a letter and travelled to see Falkenhausen, who decided to use his authority to spare the boy for reasons of humanity. On 7 June 1944, Qian was contacted again when the Germans had taken 97 Belgians prisoner under sentence of death in revenge for three Gestapo officers who had been killed in the nearby town of Ecaussinnes. Despite being pregnant with her first child she again travelled to see Falkenhausen and asked him to intervene. He hesitated but eventually agreed to release the people, although he knew that he was disobeying an order. The general was summoned to Berlin to explain his insubordination. Falkenhausen was spared German trial and punishment by the war's end, but was arrested for war crimes. He was tried in Belgium in 1951. Qian appeared at the trial and pleaded for Falkenhausen's good character.Qian Xiuling: World War II Hero, Frank Zhao, 15 September 2014, Women of China, retrieved 1 April 2015 He was sentenced for twelve years for executing hostages and deporting Jews, and deported to Germany to serve his sentence.

He was also in the New Zealand Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and in the Second World War, he served in the Royal New Zealand Navy. Seconded to the Royal Navy in 1940, he commanded a minesweeper vessel that accompanied coastal convoys along the English Channel. He was later the commander of the minesweeper which, with her sister ship Moa, sunk the Japanese submarine I-1 off Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. ==Early life== Gordon Bridson was born in Wellington in New Zealand on 2 December 1909. His parents were William Bridson, a manager, and Agnes Bridson . The Bridson family later moved to Auckland where he grew up. He was educated at Auckland Grammar School up to six form level. He then started working at a metal merchant. He began his naval career in 1927 by enlisting in the Auckland Division of the New Zealand Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) in Auckland. He quickly progressed to being a commissioned officer. Also an extremely accomplished swimmer, Bridson won nine national men's swimming freestyle titles over the , and distances from the period 1929 to 1932. He participated in the 1930 British Empire Games in Hamilton, Ontario, where, competing for New Zealand, he won silver medals for both the and freestyle. ==Second World War== Bridson was not immediately mobilised for war service following the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. He was called up for duty in April the following year, receiving a promotion to lieutenant commander. The next month a group of RNVR personnel, including Bridson, were dispatched to England to serve in the Royal Navy. Once in England, Bridson was given command of HMT Walnut, a Tree-class minesweeper that belonged to the 25th anti-submarine and minesweeping flotilla. He was one of several New Zealanders commanding ships in the flotilla. For the next several months, Walnut helped protect convoys along the east coast of England and in the English Channel. He received the Distinguished Service Cross for his performance during this time. In late 1941, Bridson was appointed the commander of the newly built , one of three Bird-class minesweeping trawlers which had just been commissioned into the newly formed Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN). After initial working up in Scotland, Kiwi accompanied a convoy that departed on 1 January 1942 to cross the North Atlantic to Newfoundland. While crossing the Atlantic, Kiwi encountered a severe storm which damaged the ship and necessitated repairs in Boston. It then continued onto New Zealand via a transit through the Panama Canal. Solomon Islands Arriving in Auckland on 21 May 1942, the Kiwi, together with Moa and Tui, the two other Bird-class minesweepers, were assigned to the 25th Minesweeping Flotilla. At the time of the arrival of the Bird ships in New Zealand, the flotilla was operating in the waters around Fiji but in August 1942 was dispatched on anti-submarine duties around Noumea. Kiwi was sailing with the flotilla by the end of the following month. In December 1942 the flotilla set sail for deployment in the Solomon Islands in support of the Allied operations there. The flotilla was initially used in anti-submarine patrols around Guadalcanal's Cape Esperance. On 14 January 1943 Kiwi was the subject of a friendly fire incident when in poor light an American PT boat fired two torpedoes at her which only just missed. Bridson subsequently became friends with the commander of the PT boat. Later the same month, in the late evening of 29 January, Kiwi and Moa was carrying out patrols around Guadalcanal with Bridson in overall command. A Japanese submarine, the I-1, was detected by Kiwi, which launched a series of depth charges. The I-1 surfaced so it could use its 5-inch gun on the much smaller minesweepers. The Kiwi repeatedly rammed the submarine while firing point blank with its own 4-inch gun and an unofficial 20-mm Oerlikon that had been installed on its bow while stationed at Noumea. The submarine was badly damaged but broke free. Eventually, chased by Moa, the I-1 was stranded and sank on a reef. During this action, three of the Kiwi's crew were wounded, one fatally. The damage to the Kiwi as a result of the engagement with the I-1 saw it return to New Zealand for repairs to her bow. Once back in Auckland, the crew of the Kiwi paraded down Queen Street to the city's town hall, where a civic reception was held in recognition of their exploits in sinking the I-1. For his role in the destruction of the Japanese submarine, Bridson was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and the United States Navy Cross. The wreck of the Japanese submarine I-1, sunk by Moa and Kiwi Later military service Once repairs were completed, Kiwi returned to the Solomon Islands in May 1943, although not before another friendly fire incident where she was fired upon by an American Liberty Ship. Bridson remained in command of Kiwi until May 1944 when he received a temporary promotion to commander and took over as naval officer-in-charge Dunedin. Six months later he was made commander in charge at Lyttelton. In April 1945, he was appointed as an honorary aide de camp to the Governor-General of New Zealand, Sir Cyril Newall. He remained in these posts until demobilisation from the RNZN in 1946. ==Later life== Returning to civilian life, Bridson moved to Te Aroha, in the North Island and became involved in the hardware trade. Several years later he took up farming on a property near Cambridge, where he died on 6 December 1972. He was survived by his wife Ada , who he had married in March 1940, and three children. ==NotesReferences== * * * ==Further reading== * \\"Epic sea battle\\".

The insurgency began with political assassinations in the early 1990s, and has escalated in the past few years with the use of suicide bombers. ==Background== The organization was originally formed in 1978 by Dursun Karata≈ü as Revolutionary Left (Turkish: Devrimci Sol or Dev Sol), a splinter faction of Devrimci Yol (\\"Revolutionary Way\\"), which splintered from the Turkish People's Liberation Party-Front (THKP-C), which in its turn was a splinter of Revolutionary Youth Federation (commonly known in Turkish as Dev Gen√ß). Its first campaign of violence was during the Turkish political crisis (1976‚Äì80). ==Timeline== First years (1990‚Äì2001) It began a new campaign against foreign interests in 1990, which included attacks against U.S. military and diplomatic personnel and facilities. To protest what it describes as US imperialism during the Gulf war, the DHKP/C assassinated two U.S. military personnel, wounded an Air Force officer and bombed more than 20 U.S. and NATO military, commercial and cultural facilities. It is significant that the only American killed by terrorists during the First Gulf War was a victim of Dev Sol. U.S. Insurance Executive John Gandy was murdered in his Istanbul office in February 1991 by a well-trained Dev Sol hit team that gained access to the office building by wearing Turkish National Police (TNP) uniforms. After tying Gandy to a chair the Dev Sol operatives shot him multiple times in the head. The terrorists then wrote anti-US graffiti on the office walls with the victim's blood. Although Dev Sol was under active investigation by the American, British, French, Austrian and Danish intelligence and security services, it posed a significant challenge for counter-terrorist agents because it was one of the few terrorist organizations (at that time) to employ professional operational and counterintelligence tradecraft. It used sophisticated surveillance and counter-surveillance techniques, it employed multi-layer assassination squads with surveillance, primary and secondary shooters, and it successfully exfiltrated its operatives back and forth between Western Europe and Turkey as needed. It skillfully employed professionally forged documents and disguise, and it has been claimed by opponents that it preyed on innocent Turks living in Europe, extorting money from them in exchange for \\"protection.\\" However, the DHKP/C denies any involvement in extortion and it is not unknown for criminal gangs to use the name of the DHKP/C and other armed political groups as a cover for their activities without any authorization from or actual connection to those organizations. On 13 August 1991, Andrew Blake, the head of British Commercial Union in Istanbul, was killed in a shooting. His killing was claimed by DHKP/C. However, the Turkish wing of Islamic Jihad also claimed the killing as their work. Dev Sol also claimed the assassinations of Hiram Abas (1990), Memduh √únl√ºt√ºrk, ƒ∞smail Selen, Adnan Ers√∂z and Hulusi Sayƒ±n (1991) and Kemal Kayacan (1992)‚Äîall retired figures of Turkish military or intelligence. In its next significant act as DHKP/C on 9 January 1996, it assassinated √ñzdemir Sabancƒ±, a prominent Turkish businessman, and two others: an associate Haluk G√∂rg√ºn and a secretary Nilg√ºn Hasefe. The murders were carried out by hired assassins who had been given access to the Sabanci Towers by a member, the student Fehriye Erdal, working there at that time. DHKP/C later claimed responsibility for the act. Escalation (2001‚Äìpresent) DHKP/C added suicide bombings to its operations in 2001, with attacks against Turkish police in January and September of that year. On 10 September 2001, a suicide bomber killed himself and three other people in Istanbul, being the bloodiest attack perpetrated by the group. Security operations in Turkey and elsewhere have weakened the group, however. DHKP-C did not conduct any major attacks in 2003, although a DHKP/C female suicide bomber Sengul Akkurt's explosive belt detonated by accident on 20 May 2003 in Ankara, in a restroom, while she was preparing for an action.Bomb at the center of Kizilay 100 meters away from the Prime Ministry Hurriyet Daily News. 21 May 2003.

On 1 July 2005, Ey√ºp Beyaz of DHKP-C was killed in Ankara in an attempted suicide bombing attack on the ministry of justice. In late February 2006, female member Fehriye Erdal was convicted in Belgium, while under house arrest. However, shortly before her conviction she escaped and still has not been found. On 29 April 2009, Didem Akman of DHKP-C was wounded in her attempt to assassinate Hikmet Sami T√ºrk at Bilkent University right before a lecture in Constitution Law. Akman and her accomplice S. Onur Yƒ±lmaz were caught. On 11 September 2012, a suicide bomber, a DHKP/C militant, blew himself up at the Sultangazi district in Istanbul killing himself, a Turkish National Police Officer. The Turkish National Police identified the bomber as ƒ∞brahim √áuhadar, a member of DHKP/C. DHKP/C on 11 December 2012 Gaziosmanpasa also killed a policeman. On 1 February 2013, a suicide bomber, a DHKP/C militant, blew himself up at the US embassy in Ankara, killing a Turkish security guard and wounding several other people. Istanbul police identified the bomber as Ecevit ≈ûanlƒ±, a member of DHKP/C. On 19 March 2013, DHKP/C militants conducted a double attack against the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) headquarters and the Justice Ministry. Responsibility for the attacks was claimed by the DHKP/C. In September 2013, two DHKP/C members attacked the headquarters of the General Directorate of Security with rockets. One of them, who was killed in the attack, had been involved in the 19 March attack on the AKP headquarters.Today's Zaman, 22 September 2013, Foreign links investigated in terrorist attack on police headquarters On 29 September 2013 DHKP/C sympathizers and members clash with drug gang in Maltepe where DHKP/C finds support from the local population.

On 6 January 2015, a female suicide bomber blew herself up at a police station in the Sultanahmet district of Istanbul, killing one police officer and injuring another. DHKP-C claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was meant \\"to punish (the) murderers of Berkin Elvan\\" and \\"to call to account the fascist state that protects AKP's corrupt, stealing ministers\\". Berkin Elvan was a 15-year-old boy who was killed by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during the 2013 Istanbul protests. The group also claimed that the suicide bomber was Elif Sultan Kalsen. After being called to a criminal medical center to identify the body, Kalsen's family denied the claims, stating that it was not their daughter. On 8 January 2015, the perpetrator was identified as Diana Ramazova, a Chechen-Russian citizen from Dagestan. Turkish police are investigated Ramazova's possible links to al-Qaeda or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Further investigation revealed that suspect had photos with insurgents from ISIS. The DHKP-C on 8 January removed the statement claiming responsibility from its website without giving any explanation. As of yet, it is not known why they took responsibility for the attack. Istanbul Justice Palace On 31 March 2015 suspected members of DHKP-C took prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz hostage on the sixth floor of the Istanbul √áaƒülayan Justice Palace. They demanded that the police announce the names of four members of the security services who they said were connected to the death of Berkin Elvan. The police negotiated with the gunmen for six hours, but eventually stormed the courthouse \\"because of gunshots heard from inside the prosecutor's office\\". The two gunmen died during the operation, while the prosecutor was badly wounded and later died of his injuries.Bloody end to Turkey prosecutor hostage crisis BBC. On 26 July, in Istanbul, one policeman was shot and killed in the Gazi neighborhood.

Her second novel, it is set around 1900 in an unnamed town in Ohio (later acknowledged by Santmyer to be Xenia). The novel tells of three generations of women, the wealthy, elderly Margaret Baird, her daughter Hilary, and Hilary's daughter Lucy Anne, aged 9, who live reclusively. Hilary had studied in Italy, supported by her financially successful elder brother Will. There she met and married Paolo, a gifted musician and composer, over her mother's objections. Paolo proved to be a philanderer, and Hilary eventually left him. Margaret has allowed Hilary and Lucy Anne to stay, provided that Lucy Anne be kept ignorant of her father and of music, and has even written her will to provide generous support conditional on continued music avoidance. But Lucy Anne has a natural talent, setting up the \\"fierce dispute\\" between mother and grandmother, which is only resolved by Paolo's ghost. Santmyer acknowledged that the house itself, and its reclusive atmosphere, is based on the \\"Roberts Villa\\", in Xenia. The actual occupants had been, when Santmyer was growing up, two elderly spinsters who never went out, and their nephew who sometimes went out the back way. Like Santmyer's first novel, Herbs and Apples, the novel received a minor reception at the time, but otherwise made no impact. It too was rediscovered when Santmyer became a literary sensation in 1984, and reissued in hardcover (St. Martin's Press, 1987) and paperback (St. Martin's Press, 1988) with an introduction by Weldon Kefauver (Santmyer's editor at Ohio State University Press), three poems by Santmyer, and a biographical postscript. A 1999 paperback re-issue (OSU Press) had a foreword by Cecilia Tichi (of Vanderbilt University) and the three poems by Santmyer. ==Plot summary== One summer, Lucy Anne learns to sing from Aaron, the family's Negro servant, who has not been told this is not allowed. Margaret rebukes Lucy Anne, and explains that she is to stay away from music. When she is caught playing the piano, she is sent to bed. Lucy Anne sneaks out, but when she tries to scale the locked gate, falls and sprains her ankle. Her fall is witnessed by Dr. Martin Child, who climbs the gate and brings the child in and treats her. He is invited back for regular medical visits. Hilary herself is somewhat sick, possibly tuberculosis, and Dr. Martin, who was sweet on Hilary from before she left for Italy, proposes to her and asks her to move with him to a warmer, drier climate. She refuses. When Lucy Anne has healed, Margaret takes Lucy Anne with her on her once-a-year all-day visit, by interurban train and trolley, to her son Tom, his wife and their daughter. The lousy time Lucy Anne has there--her cousin and friend call her a \\"wop\\" among other things-- convinces Margaret to revise her will, leaving out the clauses that would force Lucy Anne to live with her Uncle Tom, but otherwise just as controlling. Margaret also catches a terrible cold, a possible pneumonia, and is treated by Dr. Martin. When Margaret improves enough that it is clear she will recover, she dismisses the doctor and the nursing help. Dr. Martin proposes once more to Hilary, she says she will send him her answer by note that evening, which is again a rejection. That night there is a rainy windstorm, and Hilary wakes up to Lucy Anne's cry of terror. She reports that she had been drawn by music, and that there had been a man playing the piano in the drawing room, whistles some of the music for Hilary who recognizes it, and then Grandmother showed up, the man and Margaret discussed things, with Margaret asking Paolo what does he want and he answers \\"Lucy Anne\\", at which point Lucy Anne screamed and ran off. Hilary insists this was just a dream, but finds her mother dead in the drawing room. The will and its codicil are read, containing terms that are very controlling regarding Hilary and Lucy Anne. Afterwards, while cleaning up, a sheet falls out of a chair cover--the cover for the chair Margaret had died in--and it is one more revision to the will, dated for the day she died, leaving everything to her three children equally and without any conditions attached. == Reception Notes Further reading == Early book reviews * * * Later book reviews * Category:1929 American novels Category:Novels by Helen Hooven Santmyer Category:Novels set in Ohio Category:Novels about music Category:English-language novels ","title":"The Fierce Dispute"},{"id":"46291670","text":"Betty Sue Hearnes (n√©e Cooper; born July 24, 1927) is a Democratic American politician from Missouri.

Thirteen episodes were produced in two series of six and seven episodes respectively. The first episode was broadcast on 25 October 1971. ==Synoposis== The domineering Maggie Robinson (Peggy Mount - the 'Lollipop' of the title) and her timid husband Reg aka 'Mr. Mole' (Hugh Lloyd) are a comically-mismatched couple living in Fulham, London (they married late in life, 'Lollipop' having had aged parents to look after and 'Mr. Mole' having waited for 'Miss Right'). Their domestic bliss is interrupted by the arrival from Africa of Reg's brother, the brash, workshy Bruce (Rex Garner) and his hypochrondriac wife Violet (Pat Coombs). The comedy revolves partly around Reg and Maggie's attempts to get Bruce employment. Another feature is Reg's sinus trouble (which prevents him fully appreciating his wife's cooking). Guest stars included Gordon Jackson, Michael Bates, Michael Knowles, John Clegg, Bill Pertwee, Carmel McSharry and Erik Chitty. Producers were David Askey and later Shaun O'Riordan. The second series featured an electronic instrumental theme tune (the first series had Mount and Lloyd singing a love duet). For the second series, the title was changed to Lollipop. A special vignette of the show was produced for a Christmas compilation in 1971. A DVD has been released of the only two surviving episodes (the others having been presumed lost), \\"A Marked Man\\" and \\"Lollipop and the Two Bares\\". Although the two series were produced in colour, the surviving episodes are only available in monochrome. ==Episode Guide== Series One: \\"Home to Roost\\" (first broadcast October 25, 1971) \\"Sweet Hearts\\" (November 1, 1971) \\"Love in Gloom\\" (November 8, 1971) \\"The Man in the Brown Coat\\" (November 15, 1971) \\"Doctor Fruit Cake\\" (November 22, 1971) \\"Somebody at the Door\\" (November 29, 1971) Series Two: \\"A Marked Man\\" (July 17, 1972) \\"On Safari\\" (July 24, 1972) \\"It's Only Natural Gas\\" (July 31, 1972) \\"My Fur Lady\\" (August 7, 1972) \\"Cock-a-Doodle-Don't\\" (August 14, 1972) \\"Lollipop and the Two Bares\\" (August 21, 1972) \\"Inspector Hardcastle Investigates\\" (September 4, 1972) ==External links== * * Category:1970s British sitcoms Category:1971 British television series debuts Category:1972 British television series endings Category:ITV sitcoms Category:English-language television shows Category:Television shows produced by Associated Television (ATV) ","title":"Lollipop Loves Mr Mole"},{"id":"46291731","text":"The Burning Dead (also Volcano Zombies) is a 2015 American horror film directed by Rene Perez, written by Jeff Miller and Jason Ancona, and starring Tom Downey and Moniqa Plante. == Plot == Long-dead cannibals are brought back to life when a volcano erupts. A sheriff and his daughter band together with several other survivors to defeat the lava-based zombies. == Cast == * Tom Downey as Sheriff Denton * Moniqua Plante as Mindy Roberts * Nicole Cummins as Nicole Roberts * Kevin Norman as Ryan Jacobs * Kyle T. Heffner as Dr. Stevens * Julia Lehman as Eve Jones * Tom Nagel as Deputy Tisdale * Adam Gregor as Ranger McGee * Jenny Lin as photographer * Robert F. Lyons as Old Ben * Danny Trejo as Night Wolf == Production == Perez was attracted to the project due to his desire to work with producer Jeff Miller, and he was intrigued by the possibility of directing a campy horror film, which he had never done before. Plante said that she was drawn to the film based on the campy appeal of the script. Trejo was approached after the film had financing. Lehman was cast by co-producer Mike Sikes, who she had previously worked with in Pretty Cool 2. She said that the actors had to take the story seriously despite its silliness in order to make the premise work. Filming began around November 2013 and included Lassen Volcanic National Park among other locations. Post-production ended in September 2014. Perez estimated that it took 1.5 years between when the script was written and the film's release date. == Release == The original title, Volcano Zombies, was changed to The Burning Dead for marketing reasons. Perez endorsed the change. Uncork'd Entertainment released The Burning Dead to video on demand on March 3, 2015. The DVD will be released on April 7, 2015. == Reception == Dominic Cuthbert of Starburst rated it 4/10 stars and wrote that both the script and acting are terrible, but it could have been salvaged if Perez had not taken himself so seriously. Mark L. Miller of Ain't It Cool News called it an attempt to cash in the success of Sharknado, though it is even more nonsensical. Scott Foy of Dread Central rated it 1/5 stars and wrote that although The Asylum might not have made a good film with this premise, they could have done it with more flair. Ben Bussey of Brutal as Hell called it a \\"waste of time\\" that is full of filler. Michael DeFellipo of Horror Society rated it 6.8/10 and wrote, \\"By all means this movie isn't made to be taken seriously, so it does achieve its goal of being fun to watch. If you're a fan of SyFy Network Original Movies, then you'll get a kick out of The Burning Dead.

The first edition of the book was published in 1956 by Abelard-Schuman. Revised editions were brought out in subsequent years. ==Overview== The book describes the internal structure of the atom. The sequence of concepts described in the book follows the sequence that those facts were discovered in. It describes the various sub-atomic structures within the atom, and the functions they fill in the whole structure. Later chapters describe chemical elements and isotopes, the stability and instability of atomic nuclei, and finally atomic energy, the uses it has, and the threat that it poses. A review in the educational journal The Clearing House said that the book was \\"lucid\\", and that its \\"analytical style exemplifies the art of good teaching.\\" The book is aimed at educated lay-readers, and high-school science students. Inside the Atom ends on a cautionary note, stating \\"If only we can learn to use the knowledge we already have...\\" In 1956, the book was used in a pilot program to advance science education sponsored by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The island is surrounded by mudflats that are under water during high tides. The island got its name from the presence of magnetism (believed due to magnetite) identified during a geological survey in 1951. Its shape and geology are heavily influenced by Mount Redoubt and Mount Iliamna, two active volcanoes located less than away. The island is most notable for its archaeological significance, which includes a prehistoric human habitation site which has been dated to c. 1800-1400 BCE. The sites consists of a series of depressions, which when excavated in 2012, yielded several layers of cultural materials, included fire-cracked stones and hearths, and stone tools stylistically associated with the Arctic Small Tool tradition. The site was presumed to be abandoned due to volcanic activity. The archaeological site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. ==See also== *List of islands of Alaska *National Register of Historic Places listings in Kenai Peninsula Borough, Alaska ==References== Category:Islands of Alaska Category:Islands of Kenai Peninsula Borough, Alaska Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Alaska Category:National Register of Historic Places in Kenai Peninsula Borough, Alaska ","title":"Magnetic Island (Alaska)"},{"id":"46291779","text":"Johann von T√ºrckheim () (10 November 1749 ‚Äì 28 January 1824) was a French politician and a German diplomat. ==Family== Jean de Turckheim was the oldest son of Baron Jean de Turckheim (1707‚Äì1793) and a brother of Bernard-Fr√©d√©ric de Turckheim.

The name of the poem is a wordplay on Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace. In the pre-1918 Russian –ºi—Ä meant \\"the world,\\" \\"the Universe,\\" as opposed to –º–∏—Ä, \\"peace\\". In the modern Russian, the words are full homonyms. ==Background== In the early September 1915 Mayakovsky joined the Petrograd military driving automobile driving school. The patriotic enthusiasm he experienced at the outset of the war now waned, he was quite unwilling to go to the frontline. \\"Shaven me up [for the service]. But now I don't want to go to the front anymore. Pose as a draftsman. Take nightly lessons from an engineer who teaches me to draw the autos. With publications it's even worse. Soldiers are forbidden to [get published],\\" he wrote in I, Myself. It was while studying at the school that he started The War and the World which was finished in the course of 1916. While working upon the poem Mayakovsky often visited Gorky, recited new fragments and, apparently, received advice. ==History== In the end of 1915, having finished Part 3 of the poem, Mayakovsky read it in the offices of Letopis magazine, with Gorky present. Approved for the publication by the staff meeting, it was banned by the Russian military censorship committee. In No.9 issue of the magazine it was marked as one of the works which \\"cannot be published for reasons‚Ä¶ the editorial staff has no influence over.\\" Public renditions of the poem were also banned. Mayakovsky started publishing The War and the World in parts, in Letopis (The Prologue, Part 5, 1917, Petrograd), Desert Miracle almanac (Part 4, Odessa, 1917), Novaya Zhyzn newspaper (Part 3, 1917). For the first time the poem was published as a whole in the late 1917 by Parus Publishers, later to be included into Vladimir Mayakovsky's Collected Works, 1909-1919. Gorky was the poem's most ardent champion who admired the anti-war pathos, but also its in-your-face language, totally devoid of subtlety (\\"like telegraph posts playing upon your nerves,\\" as he put it). The Futurists received the poem negatively and accused the author of having torn with all the basic principles of the movement, apparently under Gorky's influence. Later Soviet literary historians eagerly explored this line, finding the two authors' rhetoric at the time in many ways similar.Makarov, V., Zakharov, A., Kosovan, I.

When the event was first organised in 1992, a published map for the area displayed a spot height of 704m at the mountain's summit. In 2004, it was discovered by a participant that the actual spot height is several metres less than the required 700m.

It is her first record released under the name Allie X. The album was initially released on 7 April 2015 in Canada. The worldwide release was pushed back twice, once to 14 April 2015 and then to 21 April 2015. CollXtion I is intended to be the first of at least five CollXtions, each being a unique multimedia experience that will include the spinning GIFs featured in her YouTube videos, a comic detailing an abstract autobiography, and song stems to allow fans to make their own creations. She has stated that the album is influenced by her interest in medicine, psychology, and the macabre. During a question and answer session on social media site Tumblr, Allie stated that the overall theme for CollXtion I is \\"addiction and self destruction\\". ==Promotion== CollXtion I has been promoted by full-length tracks of the singles, released to YouTube and her Soundcloud, and \\"xamples\\", or snippets, of other non-single tracks released exclusively on YouTube, all of which feature her characteristic spinning GIF animations. She undertook an artist's residency at the Phi Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada from April 30 to May 2, 2015. The residency began with a live performance on April 30 and it included interactive media installations, a pop-up shop, and a curated online experience. == Critical reception == Edmonton Journals Julia LeConte gives a positive review of the release, calling it, \\"a smartly written seven-song EP that offers up a smorgasboard of indelible hooks,\\" and goes on to say her song creating ability matches her \\"spectacular\\" voice. The editor of Pressplay says that thematically, CollXtion I, isn't much, but that the whole package is a knockout. The editor goes on to describe the content as, \\"songs that belong in the charts, and it's only a matter of time before the world takes note.\\" Ryan McNutt of Exclaim! says CollXtion I finds its place in its opposites, from its simultaneous \\"clinical coolness,\\" to \\"warm and present immediacy,\\" and her \\"familiar yet foreign,\\" vocals. Overall he says it is a \\"confident, catchy debut,\\" with \\"earwormy flourishes along the way.\\" Jean-Luc Marsh, hailing from Pretty Much Amazing, gave a slightly less than positive review, saying that, \\"X has an occasional knack for pop at its saccharine, venomous best.\\" He says her only misstep is, \\"Good, which hangs inoffensively but unceremoniously.\\" On a more positive note, he added that, \\"she makes up for it with an impassioned performance on closer 'Sanctuary,' packing a platitude-laden vocal wallop.\\" Joshua Bote of The Daily Californian said of her September 2015 live performance at Rickshaw Stop of the songs from CollXtion I, \\"Her nearly flawless performance left a gaping hole where Allie X's identity should have been.\\" Bote also stated, \\"she launched into tune after tune from CollXtion and consistently maintained the awkward rigidity of her semi-dancing, semi- flailing routine. Each number was flawlessly performed, but her set lacked an identifiable persona that set her apart from any of the Top 40 divas.\\" Kevin Ritchie of NOW Toronto gives the EP a rating of \\"Good,\\" saying that \\"[she] is the latest in a long line of acts... to revel in uptempo melancholia,\\" but that \\"it's got solid hooks, massive melodies, multi-tracked emotions and a pile of unhealthy relationship metaphors.\\" Upon the release of Catch, Jamie Milton of DIY Magazine says, of Allie X and her single, \\"Allie X stepped on the scene like a bottle of wine at a wedding - everyone wanted a piece of her.\\" TIME's Jasmine Cox complemented the track, saying it \\"shines with a level of polish and craft that's remarkable,\\" and complemented X's \\"attention to detail.\\" Logan White of Billboard magazine called Catch \\"an expertly crafted, remarkably vulnerable synth-pop showcase.\\" Carl Williot from Idolator said that Catch was \\"everything that's wonderful about under-the-radar pop music right now: immaculate hooks, pristine synth work, vocal versatility, bold atmospherics and a beating, bursting heart,\\" and named it \\"the best song of 2014.\\" Buzzfeed's Matthew Perpetua described Prime as a \\"colorful, stylish synth pop song\\" that is \\"arguably even better than Catch.\\" Melissa Locker of TIME called the song \\"an injection of sparkly synth-pop that's so catchy. it [sic] reminds you of why pop songs are called infectious in the first place.\\" \\"Bitch\\" was described as, \\"brimming with bubbly bleeps and sonic squelches,\\" and as highlighting \\"Ms. X's dream-like vocals,\\" by Robbie Daw of Idolator.

The work was jointly commissioned by the London Symphony Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra, and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. It was completed June 7, 1997, and premiered January 15, 1998 in Cleveland, Ohio with the Cleveland Orchestra under conductor Christoph von Dohn√°nyi. The piece is dedicated to percussionist Evelyn Glennie, who performed the solo during the world premiere. Rouse composed the work as an informal musical sequel to Richard Wagner's four-opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen.Rouse, Christopher. Der gerettete Alberich: Program Note by the Composer. 1997. Retrieved April 1, 2015. ==Composition== Style and inspiration Rouse conceived Der gerettete Alberich as a fantasy on the adventures of villainous dwarf Alberich after the apocalyptic conclusion of Richard Wagner's G√∂tterd√§mmerung, last in the four-opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen. Thus, the work freely quotes passages from Der Ring des Nibelungen, beginning with the ending coda of G√∂tterd√§mmerung, as Alberich's exploits are musically detailed. The piece also contains a rock and roll drum solo that has been compared to the style of Led Zeppelin. In the score program notes, Rouse commented on the inception of the piece, saying: Rouse also described Der gerettete Alberich as being \\"looser architecturally\\" than his other concerti and characterized it as \\"more of a fantasy for solo percussionist and orchestra on themes of Wagner, with the soloist taking on the 'role' of Alberich.\\" Instrumentation Der gerettete Alberich is scored for a solo percussionist and orchestra comprising piccolo, two flutes, three oboes, three clarinets, three bassoons, six French horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, harp, timpani, three percussionists (chimes, antique cymbals, xylophone, castanets, tam-tam, bass drum, suspended cymbal, four tom-toms, anvil, and thunder sheet), and strings (violins I & II, violas, violoncellos, and double basses). The soloist's percussion battery consists of four wood blocks, four log drums, four tom-toms, two bongo drums, two timbales, snare drum, steel drum, marimba, two g√ºiros, pedal-operated bass drum, and a drum kit. ==Reception== Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times praised the concerto, saying, \\"...Rouse has a knack for outlandish gestures, a deep and abiding love of rock 'n' roll, a competitive obsession with getting orchestras to play louder than they ever have in the past, and a sense of humor. 'Alberich,' or whatever one should call the score for short, is a riot, in more ways than one.\\" Allan Kozinn of The New York Times also lauded the work, saying, \\"The notion of writing a sequel to Wagner's G√∂tterd√§mmerung, and casting it as a percussion concerto, may seem odd, but it is vintage Christopher Rouse. In Der Gerettete Alberich, a virtuosic percussion line portrays the title role, supported by a rich orchestral score that quotes Ring motifs and Led Zeppelin.\\" The Philadelphia Inquirer's David Patrick Stearns said of the work, \\"Even if it's not among my favorite Rouse pieces, it displays his ever-engaging personality, with intense, eerie stillness followed by explosions seemingly inspired by Led Zeppelin, whose late drummer John Bonham cast a welcome shadow over the piece.\\" Stearns added, \\"The Wagner quotes are still there - especially the music Alberich sings when he renounces love for gold - but they're twisted around, Alberich-like, firsthand expressions of the character rather than an outside observation of him. It's as if he finally nabbed the ring that will let him rule the world - and is ruling it.\\" Tim Smith of The Baltimore Sun gave lukewarm praise to the work, writing, \\"Some of what ensues in Der gerettete Alberich ('Alberich Saved') is a little obvious, even a little odd ‚Äî a rock music outburst seems more tacked on than organic ‚Äî but the finely structured, prismatically orchestrated piece adds up to a clever, rousing mini-epic.\\" David Gutman of Gramophone, however, was much more critical of the piece. Despite referring to the scoring as \\"blatant but imaginative,\\" he opined: In programming a 2013 concert celebrating the bicentennial of Richard Wagner's birth, conductor Marin Alsop said of Der gerettete Alberich: ==References== Category:Concertos by Christopher Rouse Category:1997 compositions Category:Percussion concertos Category:20th-century classical music Category:Music commissioned by the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra Category:Music commissioned by the Cleveland Orchestra Category:Music commissioned by the Philadelphia Orchestra Category:Music commissioned by the London Symphony Orchestra Category:Der Ring des Nibelungen ","title":"Der gerettete Alberich"},{"id":"46291883","text":"World War II recruiting poster for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers An Engineer Light Ponton Company was a combat engineer company of the United States Army that served with U.S. Army ground forces during World War II.War Department Engineer Field Manual FM-5-5, Engineer Troops 11 October 1943: Engineer Light Ponton Company It was primarily a highly mobile pontoon bridge construction unit, though it also provided both M2 assault boats and a selection of infantry support bridging, ferries, and rafts. == Mission == The combat engineer unit was organized and trained to transport and maintain its stream-crossing equipage, to construct floating bridges and rafts with this equipage, to guard and maintain completed bridges, to regulate traffic thereon, and to dismantle bridges and rafts.

Training  Unit training included care and operation of transportation and heavy equipment assigned to the company, and nomenclature, use, repair, and maintenance of bridge equipage and light stream-crossing equipage. Engineers were trained in use of pontoon equipage including employment of outboard motors and training in repair of equipage is confined to repairs readily accomplished. They engaged in frequent drills and field training in safe and rapid transportation of bridge equipage to crossing sites; in unloading and launching of equipage; in construction of bridges and rafts; in operational maintenance, care, guarding, and dismantling of bridges and rafts; and in loading of component parts on company vehicles. Special effort was made in training to keep the bridge clear of drift and other floating objects, especial attention being given to anchor cables. Training in guarding bridges is of vital importance to insure uninterrupted flow of traffic. Training all personnel in road movements including organization of columns, movements under cover of darkness, secrecy and discipline, security, and other fundamental principles prescribed in Army Field Manual FM 25-10. They were also trained in concealment of vehicles. Combat training included the use of individual and supporting weapons for local security. Proficient gun crews were to be developed for employment of machine guns under defensive combat conditions.  Duties  The light ponton company normally performed the following duties when in bivouac: # Maintained local security against hostile air and ground attacks. # Took camouflage measures for concealment of transport and equipment. # Maintained transport and equipment ready for employment at all times. # Periodically tested equipment to eliminate parts which deteriorated. # Reinforced engineer depot personnel. # Maintained or repaired roads near the ponton park. # Assisted nearby engineer units in performance of their duties. The light ponton company normally performed the following duties when not in bivouac: # Route reconnaissance, and reconnaissance for ponton bridge crossings. # Moved its equipment forward to the site or sites of stream crossings, allowing ample time for moving out of bivouac and for approach march. # Unloaded and concealed vehicles. # Constructed bridges and rafts using M3 pneumatic or M1938 ponton bridge equipage, and infantry support rafts. # Maintained and repaired floating bridges and rafts. # Operated raft ferries. # Guarded completed bridge. # Regulated traffic on bridge. # Dismantled and loaded bridge equipage on trucks and trailers. # Provided for hasty demolition of bridge. == See also == * United States Army Corps of Engineers * 549th Engineer Light Ponton Company * Pontoon Bridge == References == This article incorporates text from the U.S. Army public domain publication FM 5-6 Engineer Field Manual.

Rebels also captured the border guard posts \\"62\\", \\"63\\" and \\"67\\". At least one BMP-1 was captured by the rebels. The military acknowledged losing the border crossing and the three posts, but stated that it was still in control of the \\"Amman brigade\\" 12,5 miles east of Nasib. However, video footage showed that the base was also captured. The Syrian government stated that any use of the rebel-held crossing ‚Äúwill be considered illegitimate‚Äù. The border crossing was closed by Jordan authorities. ==Aftermath== The next day, the Syrian Arab Air Force raided areas around the border crossing, killing eight people, including five rebels. The border crossing was looted by hundreds of rebels and civilians. The FSA accused al-Nusra Front of taking part in the looting and told them to leave. Furthermore, the Southern Front of the Free Syrian Army claimed al-Nusra participated only in the last stages of the fighting for the border crossing, not in the planning or initial attack. It also stated to have opened an investigation into the looting. As of 3 April, the al-Nusra Front was in control of the crossing and deciding who can go through it. The al-Nusra Front held around ten Lebanese truck drivers, after their vehicles were stranded in 'no man's land'. According to the Lebanese Refrigerated Truck Union, between 30 and 35 Lebanese truck drivers were still stuck in the area. The SOHR stated that there were around 300 vehicles held up at the border crossing, while Seer al-Dinnieh Mayor Ahmad Alam confirmed that \\"many tons\\" of items were stolen during the looting. On 4 April, the al-Nusra Front pulled back from the border crossing, leaving it to a civil administration. According to the SOHR, al-Nusra Front abducted at least 35 truck drivers from the border crossing. It was agreed in the 'courthouse of Horan' that all abducted truck drivers will be released within 24 hours that the border crossing must be managed by a civil administration. As of 6 April, two truck drivers were still being held captive. On 11 April, al-Nusra Front pulled back from the duty-free zone between the Syrian and Jordanian crossings at the request of the Southern Front.Jabhat al-Nusra pulls back from the shared area in Nassib crossing. Syrian Observatory For Human Rights. 11 April 2015. A spokesperson for the Southern Front said they would not cooperate militarily with al-Nusra Front. ==Analysis== The Nasib border crossing was the last major government-held border crossing with Jordan, and vital for transporting goods from Lebanon and Syria to Jordan and Gulf countries. The capture would possibly affect Lebanon's, Syria's and Jordan's economies greatly, according to the Lebanon‚Äôs Economy Minister. It was a heavy blow to the government's efforts to rebuild Syria's export trade crippled by the civil war since the post was a conduit for $2 billion of bilateral trade annually. Muhanad al-Asfar, a senior member of the Syrian Exporters' Union, described the loss of the border post as a \\"catastrophe\\" for the Syrian economy. An analysis by the Heinrich B√∂ll Foundation suggested that Jordan gave approval to the Southern Front to take over the crossing, Jordan thereby putting its political interests over its economic interests, as the seizure would have a negative economic impact on Jordan, as well as on the Syrian government, and damaged Jordan's remaining diplomatic relations with the Syrian government. ==References== Nasib Border Crossing Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Free Syrian Army Nasib Border Crossing Category:Daraa Governorate in the Syrian Civil War Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Syrian government Category:Battles of the Syrian Civil War ","title":"Battle of Nasib Border Crossing"},{"id":"46291906","text":"GRADELA is a simple gradient elasticity model involving one internal length in addition to the two Lam√© parameters.

Though a work of fiction, it centers around true historical events and \\"connects the root of much of today's turmoil in the Middle East with the Axis-Allied struggle from control of the Suez Canal, and the early history of the Muslim Brotherhood.\\" The author was born to a Jewish family in Heliopolis, a suburb of Cairo, Egypt. Her family was expelled in 1956 during the Suez Crisis when she was three years old.

The low-budget movie, Yang's directorial debut, was filmed over 29 days in basically one location. The story begins when a jobless man (Xu) and his doofus cousin (Wang) hold hostage the young employees (Li and Qiao) at a 24-hour supermarket, because the mart owner (Yang) had denied his lottery win. Hilarity ensues when a moronic prankster (Zhao), a myriad of shoppers, the mean owner and an at-large gunman (Zhang) enter the mart one after another. ==Plot== Bespectacled nerd Li Junwei (Qiao Renliang) and pretty girl Tang Xiaolian (Li Xiaolu) are manning the night shift at the 24-hour Wang Wang Supermarket when balding lottery addict He Sanshui (Xu Zheng) arrives, demanding to speak to the lady owner Wang Sufen (Yang Qing). Wang, who is not in, made a typo entering the lottery number more than a month ago, which rendered He Sanshui's winning ticket useless. When He Sanshui asked for the ¬•9500 win at an earlier occasion, she attacked him and drove him out of her store. This time, He Sanshui returns with a stun gun flashlight and his dimwitted cousin He Damiao a.k.a. Tire (Wang Dongfang), and is determined to get his ¬•9500 \\"back\\". At this moment, Li's goofy roommate Zhu Liao (Zhao Yingjun) who wants to record a funny prank video also storms in, wearing a pantyhose on his face and wielding a knife, but is quickly tasered down by He Sanshui. He Sanshui proceeds to the cashier counter and realizes there isn't enough cash in the cash register. He and Tire rope up everyone else in the soundproof back room‚Äîwhich has a complete Karaoke system‚Äîand taking their place behind the register begin to run the store, funneling the profits into their own pockets. The hungry Tire is getting preoccupied with bag after bag of junk food (some of which have expired) and Karaoke singing in the back, so Li‚Äîwhom He Sanshui calls \\"Little Steel Teeth\\" because he wears a dental brace‚Äîis brought back out to help with the work. Some time later, Tang's escape attempt, during which she tasers down Tire, is spoiled by Zhu's foolishness and He Sanshui's second stun gun. Wang suddenly returns to the store from her Mahjong games‚Äîobvious having lost all her money‚Äîand immediately begins to attack He Sanshui with a bag of weight before Tire tasers her down. However, holding her (and her French Bulldog Wang Wang) hostage does nothing to the business, which has been slow tonight. In an effort to boost sales He Sanshui decides to give 50% discount to all store items, and business quickly perks up after a taxicab chauffeur (Cao Li) helps spread the news to his colleagues. During this time, Tang discovers voyeuristic photos of hers in Li's phone and realizes that Li likes her. With ¬•3.50 to go before their ¬•9500 goal (taking into account that Tire has eaten ¬•118.10 of food), a Guanzhong dialect-speaking, gun-toting robber (Zhang Jiayi) on the run arrives to retrieve a diamond his partner left in the ice in the store freezer. Unable to find his diamond he takes everyone hostage and is in the middle of having everyone strip, when Yaozi (Ye Qian)‚Äîthe store's delivery man who has fallen asleep in the warehouse‚Äîbarges out from the rear. The group tries to subdue the gunman, but fails because He Sanshui's stun gun has run out of battery. When the diamond is finally discovered during the subsequent search, the dog Wang Wang picks it up and runs outside. This is when the gunman realizes that the police have already surrounded the store: it was Tang who secretly texted a policeman shopper (Li Weijian). The gunman runs back inside, grabs Tang and points his gun to her head. Li saves Tang but is shot by the gunman, who is accidentally electrocuted by a loose wire. Some time later, the policeman returns to the store and learns that Li‚Äîno longer wearing a brace and glasses‚Äîand Tang have been dating, while He Sanshui and Wang are honeymooning in Hainan. They watch on TV that Zhu has become a famous actor, and Tire his agent. ==Reception== The film was well received by domestic critics. Foreign reviews were likewise mainly positive: Derek Elley of Variety called it a \\"slickly-made feature debut\\", and Matthew Lee of Screen Anarchy called it \\"an impressive debut, a sparkling little comedy that warrants a good deal of acclaim\\". Awards The film won 2 awards at the China Movie Channel Media Awards held during the 2009 Shanghai International Film Festival. Yang Qing won Favourite Screenwriter and Xu Zheng won Favourite Actor. At the 2009 Locarno International Film Festival in Locarno, Switzerland, it received special mention for the Network for the Promotion of Asian Cinema (NETPAC) Jury Award. ==Theme song== The ending theme song \\"Tonight\\" was written by Peng Tan and performed by Qiao Renliang. It was included in Qiao's 2009 album Diamond (ÈíªÁü≥). Tire's favourite song is \\"Liang Zhi Hudie\\" (‰∏§Âè™Ëù¥Ëù∂; \\"Two Butterflies\\") by Pang Long. The Jay Chou songs Tire and Zhu Liao sang include \\"Qian Li Zhi Wai\\" (ÂçÉÈáå‰πãÂ§ñ; \\"A Thousand Li Away\\") and \\"Shuang Jie Gun\\" (ÂèåÊà™Ê£ç; \\"Nunchucks\\"). ==ReferencesCategory:Chinese films Category:2000s crime comedy films Category:Chinese crime comedy films Category:2009 directorial debut films Category:Films directed by Yang Qing Category:Mandarin-language films Category:Films shot in Beijing Category:Films set in China Category:China Film Group Corporation films Category:2009 comedy films ","title":"One Night in Supermarket"},{"id":"46292104","text":"Sybra spinipennis is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

The GTR was absorbed by the Canadian National Railway (CNR) in 1923. Via Rail continued to provide passenger train service to the station from 1977 until the mid 1980s. A fire seriously damaged the station in 1984 and it was decided to move the historic structure to a more suitable site. The building collapsed while it was being dismantled and it could not be saved.

Professor William H. Miernyk, a regional economist trained at Harvard, came to West Virginia University and founded RRI and served as the 1st Director. Since its opening in 1965, the Regional Research Institute has helped scholars do research. For numerous individuals, both at West Virginia University and elsewhere, it has provided crucial encouragement, stimulation, and opportunities. Its programs involve faculty members, graduate students, and an extensive network of scholars in the United States and abroad. == About == The Regional Research Institute conducts and promotes interdisciplinary research on the economic and social development of lagging regions. As a center of regional research excellence for more than four decades, the RRI has served as an international recognized center for the advancement of regional science-an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of geography, economics, and planning. The orientation William H. Miernyk established is at the heart of the Institute today: * The Regional Research Institute exists for scholarly research. Scholars define the research projects, and scholars evaluate the proposals and results. The overall objective is to increase knowledge through publication of journal articles and books. * Graduate students are an integral part of the Institute. As their educations progress, so do their roles on research projects. They learn research skills, conduct and publish research, and present papers at conferences in the U.S. and worldwide. * The scope of the Institute extends beyond the economic and social problems of Appalachia to similar regions elsewhere. It incorporates an enduring focus on quantitative methods for studying regions and evaluating policy directions. *The Institute encourages and nurtures international and multidisciplinary research. It organizes conferences and seminars, initiates research activities, creates research opportunities abroad, and hosts visiting scholars. For 50 years, the Regional Research Institute has helped scholars do research. For numerous individuals, both at West Virginia University and elsewhere, it has provided crucial encouragement, stimulation, and opportunities. Its programs involve faculty members, graduate students, and an extensive network of scholars in the United States and abroad. == Directors == * William H.

NKJV *\\"Temptation\\" (Greek: , '):Greek Text Analysis, 1 Timothy 6:9. Biblehub.com in this verse has the 'specific passive sense of being lured into sin' (Matthew 6:13; ; ).

Amen. NKJV * \\"Who alone has immortality\\": The soul of men, the angels and the body of men after resurrection are immortal, but none of these have immortality of themselves, because they have it from God, who alone originally and essentially has it. * \\"Dwelling in unapproachable light\\" (KJV: \\"that light which no man can approach unto\\"): in this current mortal and frail state of men, that even the angels cannot bear, but have to cover their faces with their wings, because God is light itself and fountain of lights to all his creatures. * \\"Whom no man has seen or can see\\": none but in Christ, at least spiritually, and that but very imperfectly in the current state: frailty, sin and mortality of human nature must be removed away, to inherit the kingdom of God, and enjoy the beatific vision of him, which no man now does, or can see. * \\"To whom be honor and everlasting power\\": which may be regarded either as a wish, that such honor, power, and glory might be ascribed to him, or as an assertion that it is given to him, by the angels as well as the saints in heaven and in earth.John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible ‚Äì 1 Timothy 6:16 ==Exhortation for the Wealthy (6:17‚Äì19)== This part can be seen as an interlude in the exhortation to Timothy (6:11‚Äì16; 6:20‚Äì21) or alternatively the previous exhortation (6:11‚Äì16) can be seen as an 'interruption' in Paul's discourse on wealth (6:3‚Äì10; 6:17‚Äì19), but in either case, the topic of wealth here seems to be a continuation of the theme of 6:3‚Äì10. In this short pericope, the 'sound of riches' is repeated (a literary device called paronomasia, \\"repetition of the same sound\\") four times, could be heard by those listening to the reading of the epistle: plousiois ... ploutou ... plousi≈çs ... ploutein (\\"the rich ... riches ... richly [generously] ... to be rich\\"), which are, respectively, a personal noun, an objective noun, an adverb, and a verb. Verse 17 :Command those who are rich in this present age not to be haughty, nor to trust in uncertain riches but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy. NKJV *\\"Command\\" (Greek: ; '): This is the fifth of the five times in this epistle Paul uses the forms of the verb parangell≈ç (\\"I charge you\\"; the others see 1:3; 4:11; 5:7; 6:13) for Timothy to \\"charge, command or instruct\\" the people, in this verse: to 'those who are rich'. ==Epistolary Closing (6:20‚Äì21)== Verses 20‚Äì21 :O Timothy! Guard what was committed to your trust, avoiding the profane and idle babblings and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge‚Äî by professing it some have strayed concerning the faith. :Grace be with you. Amen. NKJV *\\"Idle babblings\\": or \\"empty chatter\\"Notes [a] on 1 Timothy 6:20 in NKJV *\\"Grace\\": as benediction occurs typically in the last words of Pauline epistles (; ; etc.), ordinarily with divine source (for example, \\"the Lord Jesus\\" in Romans 16:20; 1 Thessalonians 5:28) and the intended recipient (\\"you all\\", , ; \\"your spirit\\", ; or \\"you\\" (plural), Romans 16:20; 1 Corinthians 16:23), but in this verse and the identical , the divine source is omitted, 'but may be assumed from the pattern elsewhere'. ==See also== * Bishop * Pontius Pilate * Jesus Christ * Timothy * Related Bible parts: Deuteronomy 24, Romans 8, 1 Timothy 4, 1 Timothy 5, 2 Timothy 1 ==NotesReferencesSources== * * ==External links== * King James Bible - Wikisource *English Translation with Parallel Latin Vulgate *Online Bible at GospelHall.org (ESV, KJV, Darby, American Standard Version, Bible in Basic English) *Multiple bible versions at Bible Gateway (NKJV, NIV, NRSV etc.) 06 ","title":"1 Timothy 6"},{"id":"46292364","text":"A number of different units of measurement were used in Libya to measure length, mass, area, etc. Metric system adopted in Libya in 1927. ==System before the metric system== A number of different units were used.

His father was William Cole (c.1796-1843), and Cole had three sisters. Cole sailed to the colony Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania, Australia) on the barque Vibilia to settle in Hobart. Fellow traveller Mary Best (ca.1798 ‚Äì 16 February 1882) came from a family of cabinet makers and upholsterers and they married in December 1833. They lived for a time in Hobart before moving to Launceston, where they had three children: *Judith Bickerton Cole (24 February 1835 ‚Äì 16 September 1916).

Five years later they travelled overland, in a covered wagon drawn by oxen, to Adelaide, South Australia, arriving in 1846. In 1848 Cole paid ¬£30 to buy 10 acres of land in Enfield where he built a cottage for his family. His youngest son Alfred died in 1849, aged 9. Cole had a protracted illness and died intestate, aged 53, on 23 June 1861. His wife Mary died at \\"Lashbrook\\" near Macclesfield in 1916. ==Career== Cole undertook house carpentry and joinery work in Hobart, before moving with his wife to Launceston. After seven years in Van Diemen's Land they moved to Portland, Victoria, where Cole was employed as Superintendent of Public Works from 1841 to 1846. On 15 December 1846 Cole opened his own office as 'Architect & Surveyor' in Adelaide, where he worked for 15 years from 1846‚Äì1861. He designed a Wesleyan Methodist Mission House. He let and sold property for a commission. After building his own cottage in 1848 he gained work designing houses and shops for other people. After joining the Independent Order of Rechabites and the Total Abstinence Society, he gained opportunities such as trusteeships and surveyorships of building societies and housing developments. In 1852 he spent most of a year prospecting at Amcrovan Gully, Bendigo. He became a paid court witness in building disputes, and accepted publicly-subscribed fees for overseeing the design and construction of small chapels. In the 1850s his work ranged from two-storey terraced houses to warehouses and shops, with a speciality in small churches and schoolrooms. His architectural work included Temperance Hall, 182-184 Tynte Street, North Adelaide, built in 1858. In 1858 he became City Surveyor of the Adelaide Council. In June 1859 he was a founding member of the Association of Architects, Engineers and Surveyors. He was elected to parliament as member for West Torrens (9 March 1857 ‚Äì 12 March 1860).

It was also the sixth and final round of the F.I.A. World Sports Car Championship. The title lay between Ferrari, Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz, with Ferrari leading 19 points to 16 from the other two marques. ==Report== Entry A grand total of 65 racing cars were registered for this event, of which 64 arrived for practice and qualifying. Scuderia Ferrari entered a pair of Ferrari 750 Monzas for Carroll Shelby and Gino Munaron, and Umberto Maglioli and Sergio Sighinolfi, alongside a 860 Monza for the partnership of Eugenio Castellotti and Robert Manzon. One of their closest championship rivals, Jaguar, did not enter not all, leaving it to just one locally entered Jaguar XK120 to take up to the fight. Meanwhile, Officine Alfieri Maserati sent a total of six works cars across the Strait of Messina to keep their very slim championship hopes alive. Amongst their line- up was Luigi Musso, Giorgio Scarlatti and Franco Bordoni. The third marque chasing the title, Daimler-Benz AG entered three of their Mercedes-Benz 300SLRs to tackle the 44.64 mile circuit. They had decided to quit racing at the end of the 1955 season, but one last major attempt was made to wrest the World Sports Car Championship away from Ferrari. The cars were to be driven by Juan Manuel Fangio and Karl Kling, Stirling Moss and Peter Collins, and John Fitch with former Jaguar driver, Desmond Titterington. Race The race was held over 13 laps of the 44.64 miles of the Circuito delle Madonie Piccolo, giving a distance of 581.604 miles. Each team of drivers was expected to navigate approximately 10,000 curves during almost 10 hours of driving combined. The Daimler team manager, Alfred Neubauer was planning on each driver being able to run four lap stints.http://www.teamdan.com/archive/wsc/1995/55tt.html Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR similar to the 1955 winner driven by Stirling Moss and Peter Collins The first car, an Alfa Romeo 1900 TI started off at 07:00, with subsequent cars departing every 30 seconds. The first of the main competitors, the Ferrari 750 Monza driven by Luigi Piotti and Franco Cornacchia would leave at 07:24:30. Very quickly, Moss set a blistering pace and broke the track record by two and a half minutes. Although his Mercedes was one of the last to be flagged off, he had passed everyone by the end of lap one. Castellotti's Ferrari split the Mercedes of Moss and Fangio. At the end of the fourth lap Castellotti was in first place and Moss was in a ditch. Moss had crashed but the Mercedes was still in working order if slightly bruised. After help from some spectators Moss was back on the road but now in fourth place. Collins exchanged places with Moss and took up the chase. Fangio passed the leading Ferrari and handed his car to Kling. Mercedes were now in first, third and fourth. The Mercedes of Moss and Collins would certainly have its fair share of obvious moments, scattered all around the car‚Äôs body. Still, it was going very fast. The area around the headlights were badly damaged, front corners on both sides were stripped away. And the right side panel looked as though they had had a number of encounters with buildings as the two Englishmen pushed the 300SLR hard through the Sicilian countryside. On one occasion, Moss pushed at a bit too hard and would go careening off the side of the track. The car avoided heavy damage, and with the help of some local spectators, Moss would rejoin the race, still leading. Trouble struck again when Collins drove straight up a stone wall, his front wheels spinning in the air. Fortunately he was able to put his car in reverse and rejoined the battle. Collins worked his way up to first before returning the car to Moss. Moss drove the only way that he knew how and won going away or in the words of Peter Collins \\"despite Stirling's efforts and my own to write the machine off!\\" Mercedes won the race and with it the sports car championship only to quit racing for the second time. As a result, car number 104 (Daimler-Benz AG), took an impressive victory, winning in a time of 9hrs 43.14 mins., averaging a speed of 59.832 mph. Second place went to Fangio and Kling, for the second race in a row, 4mins and 41 seconds adrift. The podium was complete by the Ferrari 857 S of Castellotti and Manzon, a further 5mins 25 behind. Meanwhile, the third Mercedes of Titterington and Fitch were fourth. Next home was the first of the Maserati‚Äôs, in hand of Carlos Manzini and Francesco Giardini. ==Official Classification== Class Winners are in Bold text. {  style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" ! Pos ! No !

Draft order was determined by regular season standings from 2014, but subsequent trades and transactions altered the overall draft order. The draft was broadcast live on CBS Sports Network ==The Draft== With the addition of the Dallas Charge, a league expansion team in 2015, the Draft has added a 6th round and four additional bonus selections for Dallas. Dallas was given bonus selections in the fourth and sixth rounds for a total of 10 selections. The additional round and selections will total 34 overall picks in the 2015 Draft. However, Dallas chose to exercise a previous option offered to them, and made a ‚ÄúMarket Choice Selection.‚Äù Exercising their Market Choice Selection allowed Dallas Charge to choose a player either originally from the state of Texas or who played college softball for a Texas school. Exercising the Market Choice Selection reduced the overall number of Draft picks for Dallas to nine instead of the original ten. The 34th was replaced by the Market Choice Selection by Dallas. A trade of draft picks with the USSSA Pride brought Dallas' total back to ten draft selections. Drafting an athlete gives an NPF affiliate team the rights to that athlete for two full seasons.

The original hotel on the site (often called the Nicollet House Hotel) was built in 1858. Named for Joseph Nicollet, the hotel quickly became a landmark and many of the city's early prominent figures such as John S. Pillsbury and William D. Washburn worked out of it. Over the next half-century it was expanded and remodeled several times, but by the 1920s found itself obsolete. In 1922 city inspectors ordered the installation of a fire sprinkler system which the owners deemed too expensive. The old hotel was demolished in 1923. The new Nicollet Hotel opened in June 1924. Costing $3.5 million, it had a total of 637 rooms spread across 12 stories. The building was designed by the Chicago-based firm of Holabird & Roche in a somewhat plain and unadorned style with four wings of rooms arranged around a central core. The building also had space for retail storefronts at street level. While somewhat unremarkable in appearance, the hotel's sheer size and entertainment venues made it a popular option. A young John F. Kennedy had been there as well as Dwight Eisenhower, Harry Truman, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Judy Garland. One of the hotel's lounges, the Minnesota Terrace, hosted musicians such as Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, Tommy Dorsey, Gene Krupa and Lawrence Welk. In the 1930s the Nicollet was managed by the National Hotel Management Company, with hotel industry pioneer Ralph Hitz as the NHM president. Hitz raised the profile of the Nicollet with his unique marketing style and particular attention to his guests and employees. In the 1950s a Polynesian-themed bar called the Waikiki Room was also added. In 1957 the hotel was bought by the Albert Pick Hotels Company and renamed the Pick- Nicollet Hotel. During the 1960s when much of the Gateway District was demolished as part of an urban renewal project the Nicollet was spared, however the hotel's age and the neighborhood's decline left it unable to compete. In 1973 the hotel was bought by Soul's Harbor Church which held services, operated Calvary Bible Institute, and provided housing in the building.\\"His Way\\" magazine The church went into bankruptcy in 1984 and the hotel's fixtures and furnishings were sold off shortly thereafter. Various proposals to renovate the building into a new hotel, apartments or office space were made during the 1980s but none of the plans came to fruition. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 but was eventually demolished in 1991. After the building's demolition the site served as a surface parking lot. In 2014 the city of Minneapolis solicited proposals to redevelop the block and received proposals from four different developers. In February 2015 the city's staff recommended a proposal from United Properties to build a complex on the site including a 36-story residential tower, Hilton hotel, retail/office space and a public plaza. ==References== Category:Former National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:National Register of Historic Places in Minneapolis Category:Hotels established in 1858 Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1924 Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1991 Category:1858 establishments in Minnesota Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1923 Category:Projects by Holabird & Root Category:Demolished hotels in the United States Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Minnesota ","title":"Nicollet Hotel"},{"id":"46292660","text":"Prakaipet Indhusophon (1929-1991) was a Thai philatelist who was added to the Roll of Distinguished Philatelists in 1989.Background notes on The Roll of Distinguished Philatelists September 2011, Roll of Distinguished Philatelists Trust, London, 2011.

Their formation was announced on 9 March 2015, but the two bands had been recording since at least the mid-2000s. The group's eponymous debut studio album was recorded in late 2014 and released through the Domino Recording Company in the UK on 8 June and in the US on 9 June 2015. ==History== Pre- formation (2004) Franz Ferdinand and Sparks originally began working on music together in 2004, shortly after the release of Franz Ferdinand's eponymous debut studio album, when it was discovered that the two bands were fans of each other. They had sent each other a few demos, one of which was \\"Piss Off\\", the twelfth track on FFS, but the two bands were busy with other activities and they were not able to fully record an album together. Sparks' demo recording of \\"Piss Off\\" was released on their greatest hits collection Past Tense: The Best of Sparks in 2019. Formation and FFS (2014‚Äì2015) In 2013, it was announced that the two bands were both performing at the 2013 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. While searching for a dentist in San Francisco, Alex Kapranos, the lead singer of Franz Ferdinand, was found by Ron and Russell Mael of Sparks. The Mael brothers invited the band to watch their set at the festival, and later, the two bands agreed that it was time to record an album together. On 9 March 2015, it was announced that Franz Ferdinand and Sparks had formed a supergroup together by the name of FFS. On 1 April, it was announced that the band would be releasing their eponymous debut studio album on 8 June in the UK and 9 June 2015 in the US FFS was recorded at RAK Studios in London during a 15-day period in late 2014. It was also produced by Grammy Award-winning music producer John Congleton. FFS was released to a positive critical and commercial success. In support of the album, FFS appeared on the BBC television show Later with Jools Holland on May 21, 2015 (season 46, episode 4). Disbandment Franz Ferdinand and Sparks returned to working on their separate projects. Sparks released album Hippopotamus in September 2017, with Franz Ferdinand's Always Ascending following in February 2018. FFS marked the last participation of Nick McCarthy alongside members of Franz Ferdinand, before he left the band due to family commitments. Alex Kapranos has publicly stated in multiple occasions that Franz Ferdinand has no intention to resume the band's activities. ==Discography== Studio albums { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of albums, with selected chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:8em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:18em;\\" Album details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"10\\" Peak chart positions - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\\" UK ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\\" AUS ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\\" AUT ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\\" BEL (VL) ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\\" BEL (WA) ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\\" FRA ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\\" GER ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\\" NLD ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\\" SCO Peaks in Scotland: * FFS: ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\\" SWI - ! scope=\\"row\\"  FFS  * Released: 9 June 2015 * Label: Domino * Formats: CD, 2√óLP, digital download  17  85  36  44  32  27  22  13  8  19 - } Singles { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" + List of singles, with selected chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:14em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\" Peak chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Album - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" BEL (VL) - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Johnny Delusional\\"  rowspan=\\"3\\"  2015  140  rowspan=\\"3\\"  FFS - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Call Girl\\"  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Police Encounters\\"  ‚Äî -  colspan=\\"8\\" style=\\"font-size:90%\\"  \\"‚Äî\\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory. } Promotional singles { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of promotional singles ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:19em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" Album - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Piss Off\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2015  rowspan=\\"2\\"FFS - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Collaborations Don't Work\\" } ==References== Category:Musical groups established in 2014 Category:Domino Recording Company artists Category:Rock music supergroups Category:Scottish rock music groups Category:Art rock musical groups Category:Indie pop groups from Los Angeles Category:Electropop groups Category:Dance-rock musical groups ","title":"FFS (band)"},{"id":"46292687","text":" The Pawnee Warrior was an American helicopter that was designed and produced by Pawnee Aviation of Longmont, Colorado.

England, during 1964. The band released four singles and an extended play record. They gained prominence in the United Kingdom after winning the Ready Steady Win! band contest and included future Fleetwood Mac drummer, Mick Fleetwood and vocalist Mike Patto. ==Early days== The band was formed in 1963 as The Roadrunners, but changed their name to The Bo Street Runners when it was discovered that another British group was already recording with the name. The group's original line-up included Gary Thomas on lead guitar, Bob O' Brien on keyboards, Nigel Hutchinson on drums, Dave Cameron on bass guitar and John Dominic as vocalist. They were heavily influenced by Bo Diddley in both musical style and playing technique, his name also being the inspiration for their name. They built a fanbase by playing on Sundays at the Railway Hotel, Harrow, Middlesex. ==Success in competition== In the spring of 1964, the band entered the Ready Steady Win! competition, a contest designed to find \\"the next Beatles\\", with a grand prize of ¬£1,000 and a recording contract with Decca Records. The band fit the criteria to enter, which was having no recording history and at least one original composition. On September 8, 1964 the band won the contest with their performance of \\"I'm a Bo Street Runner\\". With this success, the band signed to the Decca label for their only single with the company. The single, \\"I'm a Bo Street Runner\\" which had a B-side entitled \\"Tell Me\\", sold over 20,000 copies in the United Kingdom, but did not chart nationally. Along with the single, 99 copies of an EP were produced for the band to sell at their gigs. By now the group were supporting acts such as The Rolling Stones and Tom Jones. ==Singles, change of personnel, and Mick Fleetwood== Following the band's single and EP, Decca sold their contract to Columbia Records in 1965. The band went through many personnel changes as band members did not like the changes in musical direction that the band heading towards. Only Thomas, Dominic and Cameron remained from the original line-up, and they were joined by two London jazzers, Roy Fry on keyboards and Glyn Thomas on drums. This line-up was to record the band's second single, a James Brown track, \\"Tell Me What You Gonna Do\\", which had no success. The third line up, in the summer of 1965 brought in Tim Hinkley on keys and Mick Fleetwood in the drum seat. Fleetwood joined when he responded to an ad in the Melody Maker, and performed almost immediately with the band. ==Further singles and a final tour== Their next single, more jazz than blues, was \\"Baby Never Say Goodbye\\". The song brought favourable reviews from critics and regional acclaim when it reached number 36 on the Radio London Fab Forty. It was expected to reach the UK national charts. However, there was a workers strike at the record plant issuing the band's single so only limited copies were pressed. Fleetwood and John Dominic left the band after that and a final single followed in 1966 with Mike Patto on vocals. The A-side was a soul- orientated cover of The Beatles song \\"Drive My Car\\", the only recording to feature Patto. The band toured one last time, but with a lack of commercial success they decided to disband in October 1966. Fleetwood was the only member to achieve any notable success after the band split, as a member of Fleetwood Mac. ==Retrospective album release== A compilation album devoted solely to the band's material, Never Say Goodbye: The Complete Recordings 1964-1966 was released on November 17, 2014, by Cherry Red Records. The album included all of the band's recordings, including the EP single version of \\"I'm A Bo Street Runner\\", that won \\"Ready Steady Win!\\" competition. ==References * Category:Decca Records artists Category:Musical groups established in 1964 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1966 Category:Columbia Records artists ","title":"The Bo Street Runners"},{"id":"46292708","text":"Paul Gerimon - make up for l'Orfeo as Caronte (RTBF) Paul G√©rimont, known as Paul Gerimon, is a Belgian bassTeonna.

The editorial staff is at present composed of Edgardo Bellini (nickname Edgar), Alessandro Cassani (L'Incas), Rosanna Gastaldi (Pratolina), Maria Maraviglia (Malia) and Giuseppe Sangalli (Pipino il Breve). The magazine employs several illustrators, among them Alfredo Baroni, Roberto Mangosi, Sandro Mosca, Giorgio Noliani, Simona Simone, and Enrico Viceconte. The name is based on the famous Cumaean Sibyl, a legendary woman with prophetic powers, who according to tradition lived in a cave near Cumae. The Sibyl expressed her prophecies in a cryptic way, for which reason she has always been associated with the idea of mystery and enigmas. Monthly from 1975 to 1978, then bimonthly, the magazine has so far published 32 supplements (Quaderni della Sibilla) and is one of the longest established puzzle magazines ever published in Italy. Among many other word puzzles, La Sibilla publishes works in poetic form (either long and with a serious subject, or short and witty called epigrammatici) that are in fact puzzles alluding through hidden double meanings to a different subject, which must be found besides the apparent meaning (see riddle). It also publishes cryptic puzzles, rebuses, technical articles about word puzzles and, more generally, wordplay (in Italian Ludolinguistica). The magazine is widely appreciated thanks to the works of expert word puzzle writers and the occasional contribution of famous personalities like Stefano Bartezzaghi, Umberto Eco, Nicola Piovani, Roberto Vecchioni, Francesco Guccini and Paolo Conte. La Sibilla subscribers, specialists in the field of word puzzles, amateurs and enthusiasts, can participate in a yearly meeting (Festa della Sibilla) which takes place every June at Marina di Massa (Tuscany). ==External links== * Category:1975 establishments in Italy Category:Bi-monthly magazines published in Italy Category:Magazines published in Italy Category:Monthly magazines published in Italy Category:Magazines established in 1975 Category:Puzzle magazines Category:Italian-language magazines Category:Mass media in Naples ","title":"La Sibilla"},{"id":"46292715","text":"Donald A.

In this role, Kauffman is New York State's most senior energy official, responsible for all aspects of energy policy and agency operation, and leads the state's \\"Reforming the Energy Vision\\" initiative. ==Early life and education== Kauffman attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts and earned a bachelor's degree in African History at Stanford University. He earned a master's degree in international relations from Yale University, and a master‚Äôs in public and private management from the Yale School of Management. ==Private sector career== In 1993, Kauffman joined Morgan Stanley where he became vice chairman of the firm‚Äôs Institutional Securities Group, which provides institutions with services such as capital raising and financial advisory services including mergers and acquisitions advisory, restructurings, real estate and project finance, and corporate lending. Kauffman also served co-head of Morgan Stanley's Banking Department, and vice chairman and a member of the European Executive Committee of Morgan Stanley International.https://www.linkedin.com/pub/richard-kauffman/a5/35b/27b In 2004, Kauffman became a partner at Goldman Sachs where he chaired the firm's Global Financing Group, and was a member of the Partnership Committee, Commitments Committee, and Investment Banking Division Operating Committee. In 2006, Kauffman assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer for Good Energies, Inc., one of the largest private equity funds specializing in clean energy.http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/09/good-energies-invests-in- massachusetts-clean-energy-firm/?_r=0 ==Obama administration== In 2011, Kauffman joined the U.S. Department of Energy to serve as Senior Advisor to Secretary Steven Chu, bringing private sector capital markets experience to the Department's efforts to address climate change and drive adoption of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies. He was also responsible for overseeing the DOE Loan Programs Office from the Office of the Secretary at a time when the DOE Loan Program was receiving criticism for several troubled loans that had been made prior to Kauffman's involvement. As he and others predicted at the time, the DOE Loan Program's portfolio is now generating a net profit on funds loaned to clean energy companies. ==Chairman of Energy and Finance for New York== In January 2013, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced the appointment of Kauffman as the Chairman of Energy and Finance for New York, a newly created role with operational oversight for New York State's complete energy portfolio. In this capacity, Kauffman directly manages the New York Department of Public Service, the New York Power Authority, the Long Island Power Authority, and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). In June 2013, he was appointed chair of NYSERDA‚Äôs board. Through coordinated management of these agencies, Kauffman leads the state's efforts to animate clean energy markets and deploy clean energy technology, referred to collectively as \\"Reforming the Energy Vision.\\" Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) Kauffman leads New York State‚Äôs \\"Reforming the Energy Vision\\" (REV) initiative, which has the stated goal of creating \\"a cleaner, more affordable, more modern and more efficient energy system in New York, through the increased development of distributed energy resources, like rooftop solar, energy efficiency, and battery storage.\\" REV refers to a diverse set of policy actions taken by New York State to remake its energy system, both by altering state-level energy regulatory structure, and by simultaneously providing evolving support for clean energy research, finance, and deployment. REV regulatory proceeding In April 2014, under the leadership of Kauffman and New York Public Service Commission Chair Audrey Zibelman, the NYPSC began a regulatory reform process for New York's electric utility business. Kauffman, Zibelman, and Department of Public Service (DPS) Staff have articulated a wide variety of policy objectives for the REV Regulatory Proceeding in an attempt to modernize the electrical grid system, including the promotion of more efficient energy use, deeper penetration of renewable energy resources such as wind power and solar power, and wider deployment of Distributed Energy Resources, such as microgrids, on- site power supplies, and energy storage. The reform also seeks to promote greater use of advanced energy management products to enhance demand elasticity and efficiencies, and monetize operational efficiency for the electrical grid. Also stated is a larger goal of transforming electric utilities into Distributed System Providers (DSPs) that can manage and appropriately value a diverse set of Distributed Energy Resources. Clean Energy Fund (CEF) Another component of the \\"Reforming the Energy Vision\\" initiative is the Clean Energy Fund (CEF) administered by NYSERDA, a $5 billion commitment to support renewable energy and efficiency markets under the new REV Regulatory Proceeding framework. When filing for the funds, NYSERDA requested, \\"greater levels of flexibility to move funds within each of the CEF portfolios\\" to respond to evolving energy market realities. The proposal received positive feedback from clean energy advocates including the Sierra Club. NY Green Bank In 2014, Kauffman and NYSERDA established NY Green Bank, a state-funded specialized financial entity designed to increase private investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects which have had difficulty accessing financing. NY Green Bank has the stated goal of facilitating financing of more reliable and efficient energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It also seeks to address market barriers in clean energy financing markets and increasing overall capital availability through various forms of financial support. These support methods may include credit enhancement, project aggregation, and securitization. The organization has committed to working exclusively in partnership with private sector lenders to leverage its funds with private capital. NY Green Bank is the largest Green Bank in the nation. NY-Sun Governor Cuomo and Kauffman announced the NY-Sun solar program in April 2014, intended to expand deployment of solar capacity throughout the state.http://www.solsystems.com/blog/2014/04/29/new-york-commits- another-1-billion-to-solar-projects-heres-what-you-need-to-know/ The $1 billion program is intended to provides long-term, stable incentive funding over a 10-year period to support photovoltaic (PV) solar projects throughout New York, with the ultimate goal of transitioning New York's solar industry to a sector that can function without subsidy support. NY Prize In February 2015, the Cuomo administration announced NY Prize, a $40 million \\"Community Microgrid\\" competition for New York. Microgrids are local energy networks that are able to separate from the larger electric grid during extreme weather events or emergencies, and provide power to the grid when needed. Microgrid technology can combine solar, wind, hydro or combined heat and power systems for local power generation. ==Board memberships and awards== In 2014, Kauffman was listed as one of Fortune Magazine's World's Top 25 Eco- Innovators alongside notable figures including Elon Musk and Bill McKibben. Kauffman has served as Chairman of the Board of Levi Strauss & Co., as well as on the boards organizations including the Brookings Institution, the Wildlife Conservation Society, The New School, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, and the New York Philharmonic. He has served on the Yale School of Management Board of Advisors, and is currently Co-Chair of the Yale Center for Business and the Environment Advisory Board where he also teaches. He also serves on the board of the Wallace Foundation and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. ==References== Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:State cabinet secretaries of New York (state) Category:United States Department of Energy officials ","title":"Richard Kauffman"},{"id":"46292730","text":"Test of English Proficiency may refer to: * International Test of English Proficiency * TEPS, or Test of English Proficiency developed by Seoul National University ==See also== *Oxford Test of English ","title":"Test of English Proficiency"},{"id":"46292731","text":"The Association fran√ßaise pour l'information scientifique or AFIS (English: French Association for Scientific Information) is an association regulated by the French law of 1901, founded under the leadership of Michel Rouz√© in November 1968. As a skeptical organisation, it has been a member of the European Council of Skeptical Organisations since 2001, and publishes the magazine Science et pseudo-sciences (\\"Science and pseudosciences\\"). == Purpose == Statement of principles: \\"The AFIS strives to promote science against those who deny its cultural value, abuse it for criminal purposes or as a cover for quackery.\\" According to the AFIS, science itself cannot solve humanity's problems, nor can one solve them without using the scientific method. Citizens should be informed about scientific and technical advancements and the problems it helps to solve, in a way that is accessible to everyone, regardless of the pressure from particular interests. They should be warned against false sciences and against those who propagate them in the media for personal or financial gain. Via its magazine, Science et pseudo-sciences, the association states it wants: *to collect a number facts from current affairs in science and technology to consider them from a human perspective first; *to distribute scientific information about all disciplines of research via the news, in a language that everyone can understand; *to unconditionally denounce peddlers of false science or pseudoscience (astrology, flying saucers, sects, the \\"paranormal\\", fake medicine), malevolent charlatans and suppliers of irrationality; *to defend scientific thinking against the threat of a new obscurantism. Independent of all pressure groups, it rejects any concession to sensationalism, disinformation and complacency regarding the irrational. == Publication == The AFIS publishes a quarterly magazine Science et pseudo- sciences (\\"Science and pseudosciences\\"). According to the association, the magazine had 1400‚Äì1500 subscribers and a readership of 1400‚Äì2800 per issue in 2010.

The AFIS took the initiative to critically analyse Teissier's thesis. It turned out to be a plea for astrology, presented as a sociological study, and did not comply with any academic standards for a dissertation. The analysis was conducted by a group of astrophysicists and astronomers (Jean- Claude Pecker, Jean Audouze and Denis Savoie), sociologists (Bernard Lahire and Philippe Cibois), a philosopher (Jacques Bouveresse) and specialists of pseudosciences (Henri Broch and Jean-Paul Krivine). Teissier rejected the criticism of the contents of her sociological dissertation, and branded the AFIS as the \\"Taliban of culture.\\"  GMOs  In 2007, AFIS started a petition against the moratorium of genetically modified maize in France. It published numerous articles on GMOs. It also lobbied in the Senate during the discussion of the law on GMOs in 2008. In March 2008, this position of the association led a member of AFIS' Scientific Council, Marcel-Francis Kahn, emeritus professor in medicine at Paris Diderot University, to resign on the grounds that \\"the AFIS ‚Äì without having consulted our opinion ‚Äì made a 180¬∞ turn to a genuine pro-GMO lobby\\". He also alleged a connection between two members, Marcel Kuntz and Louis-Marie Houdebine, and \\"Monsanto or its affiliates\\". However, Kahn was unable to produce \\"real evidence\\" to back up these accusations.\\"When questioned, Marcel-Francis Kahn willingly confirmed that he is \\"against the campaign of unconditional defence of GMOs that the AFIS has conducted for the past two years\\", and that he opines that \\"there are probably ties between these two researchers and Monsanto and its affiliates\\". But the doctor immediately added that he was not aware of any \\"specific facts\\", and that he had \\"no evidence\\" to support his claims.\\" Meanwhile, the AFIS maintains its \\"total independence from any industrial group\\".  Global warming  After the publication of the report on global warming, including giving a voice to climate change deniers such as Vincent Courtillot and Beno√Æt Rittaud, the association received criticism from climatologists and the Union rationaliste. Sylvestre Huet, science journalist at Lib√©ration, expressed his disappointment with the \\"mediocre\\" coverage of the topic in a critique of the association. == Board and transparency ==  Presidents  Jean Bricmont, president 2001‚Äì2006. * Michel Rouz√© (1969‚Äì1999) * Jean-Claude Pecker (1999‚Äì2001) * Jean Bricmont (2001‚Äì2006) * Michel Naud (2006‚Äì2011) * Louis- Marie Houdebine (2011‚Äì2014) * Anne Perrin (since 2014)  Scientific Council and sponsoring commission  * Jean-Pierre Adam (archaeologist, CNRS, Paris). * Jacques Bouveresse (philosopher, professor at the Coll√®ge de France, chair of Philosophy of Language and Cognition). * Jean Bricmont (professor of theoretical physics, University of Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium). * Henri Broch (professor of physics and zetetics, University of Nice Sophia Antipolis). * G√©rald Bronner (professor of sociology, University of Strasbourg). * Henri Brug√®re (veterinary doctor, professor de therapeutic physiology at the National Veterinary School of Alfort). * Yvette Datt√©e (honorary research director of the INRA, member of the Acad√©mie d‚ÄôAgriculture de France). * Jean- Paul Delahaye (professor at Lille University of Science and Technology, researcher at Laboratoire d'Informatique Fondamentale de Lille). * Marc Fellous (professor of medicine, Institut Cochin de G√©n√©tique Mol√©culaire). * L√©on Gu√©guen (dietician, honorary research director of the INRA, member of the Acad√©mie d'agriculture de France). * Louis-Marie Houdebine (biologist and research director at the centre of the INRA at Jouy-en-Josas). * Bertrand Jordan (molecular biologist, emeritus research director at CNRS, Marseille). * Jean-Pierre Kahane (professor of mathematics, member of the French Academy of Sciences). * Jean de Kervasdou√© (professor at the Conservatoire national des arts et m√©tiers (CNAM), member of the French Academy of Technologies). * Marcel Kuntz (biologist, research director at the CNRS). * Gilbert Lagrue (honorary professor at the h√¥pital Albert Chenevier at Cr√©teil). * H√©l√®ne Langevin-Joliot (nuclear physicist, emeritus research director at the CNRS). * Guillaume Lecointre (professor at the National Museum of Natural History, Paris) * Jean-Marie Lehn (professor at the Coll√®ge de France, member of the French Academy of Sciences, Nobel Prize for Chemistry). * G√©rard Pascal (dietician and toxicologist, honorary research director of the INRA, member of the Acad√©mie d‚ÄôAgriculture and the French Academy of Technologies). * Jean- Claude Pecker (honorary professor of theoretical astrophysics at the Coll√®ge de France, member of the French Academy of Sciences). * Arkan Simaan (professor agr√©g√© of physics, historian of the sciences). * Alan Sokal (professor of physics at New York University and professor of mathematics at the University College London). * Jacques Van Rillaer (professeur de psychologie, Belgique).

It was founded in December 1974 by publisher and editor Ralph C. Lally II and it is published in physical form by Skybird Publishing on a monthly basis. Together with rival publication RePlay (founded 1975) it chronicled the arcade industry from its nascency, through market fluctuations like the video game crashes of 1977 and 1983, and the rebirth and maturation of the medium through the 1980s. It is the earliest example of video game journalism, establishing such practices as individual video game reviews and the ten-point assessment scale for video game reviews. Play Meter served as the parent organization of the first coin-op-oriented spring trade show (forerunner to North America's annual Amusement Expo). It published several bi-monthly and annual special issues throughout its history and it maintains a website where online content is also published monthly. The magazine shut down after publishing the June 2018 issue, coinciding with publisher Carol Lally's retirement. ==History== *December 1974 - Play Meter is founded by publisher, editor, and arcade operator Ralph C. Lally II. *1976 - Play Meter publishes its first Annual State of the Industry Report. *July 1976 - Play Meter introduces its pinball game reviews column, \\"Critic's Corner\\" (currently titled \\"Critic's Corner Too\\"), written by Roger Sharpe. *July 1979 - Play Meter publishes its first Equipment Poll and adds a redemption section to the magazine. *1980s - Play Meter introduces the influential \\"Players' Picks\\" column. Heading a team of seven experienced playtesters, writer Steve Harris provides reviews from the player's perspective. The introduction of the column met with interest from industry-based readers of the magazine, and by 1987 Harris and his team were considered \\"the Siskel and Ebert of the arcade industry\\". *1980 - Play Meter inaugurates its first awards for best-ranked games. *March 1980 - Ralph Lally establishes the industry's first spring trade show: the Amusement Operators Expo (AOE). It runs for 5 years before merging with the American Amusement Machine Association (AAMA)'s Amusement Showcase International (ASI) in 1986 to become the American Coin Machine Exposition (ACME). The exposition would again be retitled the ASI from 1997 to 2009 before merging with the Amusement & Music Operators Association (AMOA)'s show to become the Amusement Expo. *1981 - Expanding sales prompt the magazine to begin publishing twice a month. This schedule continues for 5 years until resuming once monthly publication in 1986. *1981 - Play Meter introduces its industry criticism column, \\"Frank's Cranks\\", written by Frank Seninsky. The column would continue to run until 1996. *December 1984 - Ralph Lally is killed in a car accident. *1989 - Play Meter inaugurates its first award for Operator of the Year. *1990 - Play Meter introduces its \\"Video Game Outlook\\" column to cover legislation related to video games and video lotteries. The column would continue to run until 1994. *1991 - Play Meter circulation peaks at 6500 subscriptions. This figure represents a steady increase from 5400 in 1979. By 1995 the figure would again dip to 6000, and by 2014 the magazine would see 3000 subscriptions. *1994 - Play Meter publishes its first Family Fun Edition (currently headed by Joseph Camarota III) devoted to the FEC market. *April 1999 - Play Meter introduces its \\"Consultant's Corner\\" column written by Jerry Merola. *29 Aug 2005 - In connection with Hurricane Katrina, a New Orleans levee breaks 4 blocks from Play Meter's 3-story Metairie headquarters.

It is the fourth game in Nintendo's Rhythm Heaven series and compiles stages from the series' previous entries; Rhythm Tengoku, Rhythm Heaven, and Rhythm Heaven Fever, as well as adding new ones. The game was released in Japan in June 2015 and in North America, Europe, Oceania and South Korea throughout 2016. ==Gameplay== Like the previous three entries in the series, Rhythm Heaven Megamix is composed of several Rhythm Games, requiring players to play in time with the music in order to clear each one. The game uses the traditional control scheme featured in the original Rhythm Tengoku, which uses the A, B, and directional buttons on the Nintendo 3DS. The game can be optionally played with the stylus, though controls are more simplified compared to Rhythm Heaven. The game features over 100 Rhythm Games, including 70 taken from previous titles (including the GBA release, which was never released in the west) and 30 brand new ones, as well as new Remix stages based on the game's Rainbow Towers which combine the previous rhythm games in the tower (or more rhythm games) into one song. Tower-themed elements are incorporated into the remix while every character in the present rhythm games get to wear special tower-themed alternate costumes (except for the Left-Hand, Right-Hand and Final Remixes). Ratings for the Rhythm Games are now awarded based on a score meter indicating how well the player performed. Each Rhythm Game also features a special Skill Star point, which awards bonuses for hitting a certain part of the game with precise timing. Playing through Rhythm Games earns Medals that can be used to unlock bonuses such as additional rhythm games. Megamix features a Story Mode in which players try to help a character named Tibby reach Heaven World, his home. The mode has players play through stages in a linear format (where they are grouped into Stages of four; one from Rhythm Tengoku, one from Rhythm Heaven, one from Rhythm Heaven Fever, and one new), which is broken up by challenge games, before allowing players to tackle various towers in any order they choose. Some older Rhythm Games that returned in Megamix (such as Karate Man, Glee Club and Air Rally), received a prequel version, An easier version which take the original name and description of each game, and have new graphics and an alternated music (to match the music style of the new rhythm games featured in Megamix), while the actual original Rhythm Games have been labeled as sequels, and are given new names. Some of the returning games from Tengoku and Heaven (DS) have been added new music and redesigned graphics. Outside of the Story Mode, players can attempt Perfect Campaigns, which require players to clear selected stages without making any mistakes, or take on challenges on the Challenge Train, which can be played with up to four players via Download Play. The Challenge Mode in the game also has two WarioWare crossover challenges named as \\"Wario... Where?\\", which replaces some of the rhythm games' main characters with characters from the WarioWare series (This is due to both the WarioWare and Rhythm Heaven franchises being made by the same developers). The game also features bonus rhythm games (all from previous titles) and a Figure Fighter Duel challenge that uses the 3DS' StreetPass functionality. ==Development== Masami Yone, the director of Rhythm Heaven Fever, assumed the same role for Megamix. He was assisted by Takumi Hatakeyama, who previously worked as a programmer and designer for WarioWare D.I.Y. and Rhythm Heaven Fever. Ko Takeuchi returns as the art director, and Yoshio Sakamoto as the general producer. The game's music is done by Tsunku‚ôÇ (who also serves as the game's producer), as well as Shinji Ushiroda, Asuka Ito, Yumi Takahashi, and Megumi Inoue. While some music pieces from the original Rhythm Tengoku and Rhythm Heaven (DS) were re-used, Rhythm Heaven Megamix re-uses several music themes from the previous game, Rhythm Heaven Fever. For the prequel versions of older rhythm games from previous titles and for the new rhythm games and remixes in the game, most of the music that Tsunku‚ôÇ had composed for them was given a techno-themed motif. This is different from the music styles used in the previous three Rhythm Heaven titles, which in Rhythm Tengoku, Rhythm Heaven (DS) and Rhythm Heaven Fever, the music for those titles was a mix of catchy tunes and vocal songs. In a Iwata Asks interview, Satoru Iwata said; \\"Making music for the game was difficult, but that's what it was like\\". Tsunku‚ôÇ said; \\"As with music, to compete with the original work... It's very tricky, but while leaving the theme, the newly created Prequels. In making music for the games (the prequel of Karate Man for example), I'd have a strong feeling for it because it was unexpectedly tough. I am very particular about the game, but no matter how many times I submit a music piece, it doesn't look right... If you make one at Nintendo's request while thinking, some think; \\"The image is a little different, though.\\". The piece for Karate Man submitted for the second time. It was a minor in changes and the guitar was fierce, it's so intense that it's cool! Not the game of the same name that appears in the beginning, though. It is used by those who appear in the final game\\". In addition to using vocal songs from previous entries, newly written songs for the game were being made. Tsunku‚ôÇ commented; \\"We have selected people who are suitable for singing fresh songs in the game\\". The four new vocal songs for Megamix are \\"Tokimeki no Monogatari\\" (used for the Lush Remix), \\"I'm a lady now/Hotzmic\\" (used for the Honeybee Remix), \\"For That One Big Tear\\" (used for the Machine Remix), and \\"Classmate\\" (used for the game's Staff Roll). For \\"Tokimeki no Monogatari\\", Tsunku‚ôÇ commented; \\"There is a feeling of twilight at dusk. The singers who sing this song did a great job\\". He brought in Tokimekist (Chi- chan, Rino Hirayama, Mai-chan, Yurinko) to record the song. For \\"I'm a lady now/Hotzmic\\", Tsunku‚ôÇ asked a person he met in New York to write the lyrics. To provide the vocals, Azuki Moeno participated, and as will be described later, Tsunku's eldest daughter, who was 6 years old at the time of recording the song, participated under the name of Hotzmic. In recording \\"For That One Big Tear\\", Tsunku‚ôÇ really liked the song's melody and lyrics, so he brought in Hikaru Ohashi, a singer from the Ishikawa prefecture, to sing. For \\"Classmate\\", Tsunku‚ôÇ said; \\"It's a song that you can hear if you play this game quite a bit. I had a pretty concrete image from the beginning, when I wondered what kind of game it would be. I'm surprised that this will happen... I was so moved that I almost cried. The song here is somehow sweet and sour. The feeling that I'm not so good is really good, and I think I'm addicted to it\\". He brought in Pajama Musume Club (Karen, Azuki Moeno, Hitomi Yoshida) to record the song. The music video for \\"I'm a lady now/Hotzmic\\" was released (probably to promote Megamix) in Japan, in which the song is extended than the 1-minute version heard in the Honeybee Remix. The video features Hotzmic singing the song while dancing in a room. \\"Tokimeki no Monogatari\\", \\"For That One Big Tear\\" and \\"Classmate\\" were replaced by instrumental versions of the three songs in the American, European, and Korean versions of the game, replacing the singing because there are no lyrics for the respective languages. Megamix was the final game developed by Nintendo SPD1 before it was merged into Nintendo Entertainment Planning and Development. In 2016, Nintendo announced that the game would launch in North America, Europe, Australia and Korea \\"later\\" that year. The game was released as a Nintendo eShop exclusive in North America on June 15, 2016 during Nintendo's Treehouse Livestream presentation at E3 2016. The game received a physical retail release in Europe on October 21, 2016. Like the European release of Beat the Beat: Rhythm Paradise, the English versions of the game feature both English and Japanese audio.http://www.polygon.com/e3/2016/6/15/11950726/rhythm-heaven-megamix- release-date ==Reception== Rhythm Heaven Megamix received favourable reviews from Famitsu reviewers, scoring 34/40 (8/8/8/10) in Famitsu Score, and praised for various aspects including its great variety in gameplay despite the simple controls, and supportive feedback from input timing effects. The game debuted at No. 1 in Japanese charts maintained by Media Create, recording 158,000 copies sold in its first week of release. As of 26 February 2016, total Japanese sales reached 650,000 copies. ==References * Category:2015 video games Category:Nintendo 3DS eShop games Category:Nintendo 3DS games Category:Nintendo 3DS-only games Category:Nintendo games Category:Nintendo Network games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Rhythm Heaven Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Music video games ","title":"Rhythm Heaven Megamix"},{"id":"46292826","text":"P320 may refer to: * Athlon II X2 P320, an eighth-generation CPU targeted at the consumer market * SIG Sauer P320, a semi-automatic pistol ","title":"P320"},{"id":"46292887","text":"Alice Carter Cook (April 8, 1868 ‚Äì June 14, 1943), born Alice Carter, was an American botanist, who in 1888 received from Syracuse University the first PhD in botany granted to a woman by any American university.

Although the current station opened in 1978, a narrow gauge railway line from Martorell, predecessor of the current line, had already been serving the city since 1893.

And the D'Angelico Mel Bay New Yorker model was featured on the cover of the Mel Bay Publications' guitar method books for decades. In 2011, guitars by D'Angelico were included in the 'Guitar Heroes' exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Current range of products manufactured by D'Angelico include electric, acoustic and classical guitars, basses and ukuleles. ==History== Founding Born in New York in 1905 John D'Angelico was apprenticed at the age of nine to his grand uncle Raphael Ciani, an expert violin and mandolin maker. This apprenticeship would become the basis for construction principles he later incorporated into his archtop guitars. After Ciani died D'Angelico took over the management of the business, but he didn't like having to supervise the 15 employees. As a result, he left and founded in 1932 D'Angelico Guitars at 40 Kenmare Street in Manhattan's Little Italy. 1933 arch-top guitar While D'Angelico's craftsmanship was not always exemplary the performance of his guitars established him as the premier marker of archtop guitars. His reputation later brought offers from larger companies, but ultimately he decided to keep his operation under his own name. During the late 1930s, when production was at its peak, D'Angelico only had the assistance of two workers. Despite being handmade the company's guitars were no more expensive than similar mass-produced guitars produced by Epiphone and Gibson. Among D'Angelico's employees were Vincent 'Jimmy' DiSerio, who worked for D'Angelico from 1932-1959, and Jimmy D'Aquisto who joined the company as an apprentice in 1952. D'Angelico had a heart attack in 1959 and also parted ways with DiSerio who left to work at the Favilla guitar company. As a result, he closed the business but soon reopened it after Jimmy D'Aquisto who was unable to find work, convinced him to do so. After several more heart attacks John D'Angelico died in 1964 at the age of 59. D'Aquisto, then bought the business from the D'Angelico family but a poor business decision lost him the right to the D'Angelico name. Relaunch In 1999, Brenden Cohen, John Ferolito Jr., and Steve Pisani purchased the D'Angelico Guitars trademark from John Ferolito Sr., cofounder of Arizona Beverages. In 2010, Cohen and Pisani began constructing a new showroom for the brand. D'Angelico Guitars was officially launched in 2011. That year, original D'Angelico guitars were honored at the Metropolitan Museum of Art as part of an exhibition titled \\"Guitar Heroes: Legendary Craftsmen from Italy to New York.\\" D'Angelico began broadening their product line, first starting with reissues of original John D‚ÄôAngelico designs, and then introducing new semihollow and acoustic models. By 2014, the brand had 125 partnerships in the United States and an additional 200 international dealers. In 2014 D'Angelico Guitars sponsored Mountain Jam, a summer music festival in eastern New York. The brand launched its first line of acoustic guitars in January 2015 when it displayed 150 guitars at the National Association of Music Merchants' annual trade show in Anaheim, California. In 2016, D'Angelico Guitars won the award for Best in Show for Companies to Watch at the NAMM show. In 2020, D'Angelico Guitars acquired Supro USA and Pigtronix. == Instruments ==  Early  D'Angelico Excel (1950) previously owned by Chet Atkins, in the Country Music Hall of Fame, 2007 As John D'Angelico's early experiences with instrument making were studying the construction of violins, his first guitars followed their bracing design. The first D‚ÄôAngelicos also had no pickups. They were built largely to be sturdy and loud enough to be heard in the context of a jazz big band. After years of unreliable bookkeeping and documentation of his early models, D'Angelico introduced the ‚ÄúExcel‚Äù model, a smaller, more streamlined iteration of its predecessors. By 1937, D'Angelico was offering at least four main f-hole archtop guitar designs, heavily influenced by the Gibson L-5:Bonds, Ray (ed.) (2006). p. 104.Achard, Ken (1999). \\"The History and Development of the American Guitar.\\" The Bold Strummer, p. 16. * Style A ‚Äì 17 inch (430 mm) body. Phased out in the 1940s. * Style B ‚Äì 17 inch (430 mm) body. This had a more ornate body compared with the Style A. Phased out in the 1940s. * Excel ‚Äì 17 inch archtop body with a single Venetian cutaway. The back and sides were made of European maple while the top was made of spruce and the neck was made of solid flame maple. The fingerboard was made of ebony. It also featured ‚ÄúX‚Äù bracing and a truss rod. Later, pickups were added to the design, notably the D‚ÄôArmond floating pickup which allowed for lighter body construction, as heft was no longer the only variable affecting volume. The Excel was popular with jazz musicians and was used by Chet Atkins prior to his sponsorship deal with Gretsch in 1936. * New Yorker ‚Äì 18 inch body. The back and sides were made of European maple while the top was made of spruce. The fingerboard was made of ebony. First produced in 1936. All New Yorker models featured pearl inlays in the headstock and fingerboards, as well as quadruple bindings.Achard, Ken (1999). p. 16. Approximately 300 were made.Denyer, Ralph (1998). \\"The guitar handbook.\\" Alfred A. Knopf. p. 47. Through at least the late 1930s, D'Angelico's guitar necks had non-adjustable steel reinforcement. Later models had functional truss rods.Wheeler, Tom (1982). pp. 22-23. By the late 40s, D'Angelico was building only the ‚ÄúExcel‚Äù and ‚ÄúNew Yorker‚Äù models. D'Angelico also built a few round-hole (as opposed to f-hole) archtops, and a few mandolins. All of D'Angelico's instruments were hand-built, with most tailored specifically to the artist/player he was building for, so substantial variation is evident in his output. D'Angelico's shop rarely made more than 30 guitars per year.Bonds, Ray (ed.) (2006). p. 106. By the time of John D'Angelico's death the company had built 1,164 numbered guitars with the last ten finished by D'Aquisto.Wheeler, Tom (1982). pp. 22.  Present days  Bedford model pictured in 2018 Since its resurgence, D'Angelico has offered the DC, a double cutaway semihollow, the single-cutaway semihollow SS, and the archtop EXL-1, the last based on John D'Angelico's Excel model. The SS has been endorsed by artists such as Grateful Dead's Bob Weir and jazz guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel, both of whom have a signature D'Angelico model. The DH and 175 were introduced as archtop options featuring double humbuckers, while the 59 features P-90 pickups. The Premier Series was introduced to offer well- crafted D'Angelico guitars at a more accessible price point, while the Deluxe Series houses feature-heavy versions of Excel Series favorites. The Deluxe Series features all unique matte finishes, and models with double-humbuckers come with a six-way toggle switch for coil-tapping capabilities. In 2016, D'Angelico launched its first electric string since its reformation. In a collaboration with D‚ÄôAddario, Electrozinc strings were developed based on an original design from the two companies‚Äô founders‚ÄîJohn D'Angelico and John D‚ÄôAddario. Electrozinc is a zinc-coated steel string built for loudness and longevity. == Manufacture == The brand's instruments are manufactured in South Korea, Indonesia, China, and New York City. Before beginning manufacturing, original guitar models were put through an MRI machine and an x-ray to replicate the instruments accurately. It takes approximately 18 months to two years to create one of their master-builder guitars from raw wood. D'Angelico Guitars' luthiers produce four to five master-builder guitars a month. == Artists == Among the artists who play, or have played D'Angelico guitars on stage are: Susan Tedeschi playing her D'Angelico EX-SD in concert, 2007 * Chris Arndt (Jocelyn & Chris Arndt) * Chet Atkins * Chester Bennington * Jonathan Butler * Eric Clapton *Dario Chiazzolino *Nels Cline *Bootsy Collins *Doug Deming *Elliot Easton *Michael Franti *Alejandro Rose Garcia (Shakey Graves) * Steve Gibson * Warren Haynes * Kenny Loggins * Oscar Moore * Brandon Niederauer * Luke Pritchard (The Kooks) * David Rawlings * Kurt Rosenwinkel * Cody Simpson * Susan Tedeschi * Bob Weir (Grateful Dead) * Brad Whitford == See also == * John D'Angelico == Notes  References  * Official website Category:Guitar manufacturing companies of the United States Category:Companies based in Manhattan Category:Manufacturing companies based in New York City Category:1932 establishments in New York (state) Category:American companies established in 1932 ","title":"D'Angelico Guitars"},{"id":"46293129","text":"The ARIA Urban Chart is a chart that ranks the best-performing Urban tracks singles of Australia.

Led by Anabel Medina Garrigues, who was WTT Female Co-Most Valuable Player, Neal Skupski, who was WTT Male Rookie of the Year, and Jarmila Gajdo≈°ov√°, who led WTT in winning percentage in women's singles, the Dream had 9 wins and 5 losses and qualified for the franchise's first playoff berth since 2013. The Dream fell to the Austin Aces, 25‚Äì14, in the Western Conference Championship Match. On January 13, 2016, WTT announced that the Dream franchise had been terminated due to noncompliance with the team's obligations to the league. ==Season recap== Relocation to California On February 23, 2015, WTT announced that a new ownership group had taken control of the Texas Wild and moved the team to Citrus Heights, California, renaming it the California Dream. Trade for Bryan brothers and draft At the WTT draft on March 16, 2015, it was announced that 2014 WTT Coach of the Year David Macpherson had become the new head coach of the Dream replacing Brent Haygarth. Macpherson has deep roots in the Sacramento area and wanted to return there with its new WTT team. Upon announcing his move to the Dream, Macpherson said, \\"I‚Äôm very excited to be coaching in the city where I started my WTT career back in 1992.\\" Since Macpherson has long served as the coach for the Bryan brothers, it was inevitable that the twins would want to follow him just as they did when he was hired as the San Diego Aviators' head coach in 2014. Consequently, prior to the draft, the Aviators traded Bob and Mike Bryan to the Dream for financial consideration. The Bryan brothers were the only selection made by the Dream in the marquee portion of the draft. In the roster portion of the draft, the Dream left 2014 WTT Female Rookie of the Year Anabel Medina Garrigues unprotected in the first round and instead chose Jarmila Gajdo≈°ov√°. Medina was still available in the second round, and the Dream selected her but had to risk leaving Aisam Qureshi unprotected to do so. The Dream then left Alex Bogomolov, Jr. unprotected in the third round and selected Tennys Sandgren. In the fourth round of the draft, the Dream could not protect Darija Jurak, because it already had two female full-time players. Instead, the Dream used its final pick to select Qureshi who was still available. Other player transactions On July 9, 2015, the Dream announced it had signed Neal Skupski as a roster player to replace Aisam Qureshi who withdrew from WTT for undisclosed reasons. Under WTT Rule 402C, unless Qureshi demonstrates that his withdrawal was due to an injury, he is ineligible to play in WTT for the 2016 and 2017 seasons. Opening the season The franchise played its first match as the California Dream on the road against the San Diego Aviators on July 12, 2015. Jarmila Gajdo≈°ov√° lost the opening set of women's singles to Chanelle Scheepers in a tiebreaker. Tennys Sandgren earned the first set win in Dream history when he took a men's singles tiebreaker from James Blake in the second set to tie the match at 9. The Aviators won each of the final three sets to secure a 24‚Äì19 victory. The following evening, the Dream played its inaugural match at the new Dream Stadium at Sunrise Mall against the Springfield Lasers. Sandgren won the opening set of men's singles for the Dream in a tiebreaker. Gajdo≈°ov√° and Anabel Medina Garrigues followed with a 5‚Äì2 set win in women's doubles to give the Dream a 10‚Äì6 lead. Medina teamed with Neal Skupski in mixed doubles for another 5‚Äì2 set win, and the Dream was on top, 15‚Äì8. After Gajdo≈°ov√° lost the women's singles set in a tiebreaker, the Lasers took the final set of men's doubles, 5‚Äì3, to cut the Dream's lead to 22‚Äì18 and send the match to extended play. Sandgren and Skupski won the first game of extended play to secure a 23‚Äì18 victory. Five consecutive wins after a slow start At the midway point of the season, the Dream found itself with 3 wins and 4 losses. Two of those losses were matches against the Austin Aces in which the Dream carried leads into the final set. However, the Dream started the second half of its season with a home victory over the Springfield Lasers. It followed this by sweeping a home-and-home series with the San Diego Aviators before heading to the East Coast. A road win over the Boston Lobsters was the Dream's fourth straight victory and put its record at 7 wins and 4 losses. On July 26, the Dream had an opportunity to clinch a playoff berth if the Aces would defeat the Aviators and the Dream could beat the Philadelphia Freedoms. While both matches started at the same time, the Aces raced to a quick 25‚Äì8 victory and spent only an hour and 31 minutes on the court in doing so. In contrast, the second set of the Dream's match with the Freedoms was wrapping up around the time the Austin-San Diego match ended. After two sets against the Freedoms, the Dream found itself trailing, 9‚Äì7, with the knowledge that a win would mean a playoff spot. Bob and Mike Bryan turned things around with a 5‚Äì1 set win in men's doubles that put the Dream on top, 12‚Äì10, after three sets. Jarmila Gajdo≈°ov√° and Anabel Medina Garrigues increased the lead to 17‚Äì14, when they took a tiebreaker in the women's doubles set. Medina and Bob Bryan put the match away with a 5‚Äì2 mixed doubles set win that gave the Dream a 22‚Äì16 victory in the match and the first playoff berth for the franchise since 2013. Playoffs The Dream went on the road to play the Austin Aces in the Western Conference Championship Match on July 30, 2015. The originally- scheduled start time of the match of 7:00 p.m. CDT was pushed back, because weather issues caused the Dream's flight to be delayed. The first ball was finally struck at 9:43 p.m. CDT, and the Aces took charge from the start with Teymuraz Gabashvili and Alla Kudryavtseva opening the match with a 5‚Äì2 set win in mixed doubles over Neal Skupski and Anabel Medina Garrigues. Kudryavtseva and Elina Svitolina followed with a 5‚Äì3 set win in women's doubles over Medina and Jarmila Gajdo≈°ov√° to give the Aces a 10‚Äì5 lead. Gabashvili and Jarmere Jenkins won a tiebreaker in men's doubles over Skupski and Tennys Sandgren to increase the Aces' lead to 15‚Äì9 at halftime. Svitolina broke Jarmila Gajdo≈°ov√°, the top-ranked player in WTT in women's singles during the regular season, in the fourth and sixth games of the set for a 5‚Äì1 win and a 20‚Äì10 Aces lead with one set remaining. With the clock having already struck midnight, Gabashvili served an ace to end the tiebreaker in men's singles against Sandgren and give the Aces a dominant 25‚Äì14 victory and the Western Conference championship. The Aces won all five sets in securing the franchise's first conference title since 2006, when they were the Newport Beach Breakers. Financial troubles and termination of franchise In December 2015, Randy Peters Catering of Citrus Heights, California sued the Dream and its three owners in Sacramento County Superior Court demanding $19,249 for its unpaid bills as the team's food concessionaire. Also in December 2015, one of the Dream's minority owners, Bob Kaliski, told The Sacramento Bee that he had personally lost $175,000 investing in the team and that majority owner Jeff Launius had told him the Dream owed its vendors $192,000 at the end of the season. Kaliski said, \\"I don't know if the team is going to be back or not. I know I'm not going to be back. I don't know about the rest of the team.\\" WTT said that the Dream had until the end of December to meet its financial commitments to the league in order to secure its spot for 2016. On January 13, 2016, WTT announced that the Dream franchise had been terminated due to noncompliance with the team's obligations to the league. ==Event chronology== * March 16, 2015: The Dream acquired Bob and Mike Bryan in a trade with the San Diego Aviators for financial consideration. * March 16, 2015: The Dream protected Bob and Mike Bryan, chose Jarmila Gajdo≈°ov√° and Tennys Sandgren as new additions to the team and selected returning team members Anabel Medina Garrigues and Aisam Qureshi both of whom it had left unprotected at the WTT draft. * March 16, 2015: The Dream hired David Macpherson as their head coach replacing Brent Haygarth. * July 9, 2015: The Dream signed Neal Skupski as a roster player to replace Aisam Qureshi who withdrew from WTT for undisclosed reasons. * July 26, 2015: With a record of 8 wins and 4 losses, the Dream clinched a playoff berth with a 22‚Äì16 win over the Philadelphia Freedoms. * July 30, 2015: The Dream lost the Western Conference Championship Match, 25‚Äì14, to the Austin Aces. * January 13, 2016: WTT announced that the Dream franchise had been terminated due to noncompliance with the team's obligations to the league. ==Draft picks== Since the Wild had the second-worst record among nonplayoff teams in 2014, the Dream selected second in each round of the draft.

For example, someone who manages an iOS or Android app could automate push notifications or in-app messages. They could also segment their existing app users to send messages only to the people they want to target. Mobile marketing automation is different from traditional marketing automation because mobile users often behave differently than web users. For example, the constraint of a smaller screen size causes differences in user behavior. However, the number of users who have adapted to mobiles has grown drastically over the years. With Google penalizing websites that are not mobile friendly, marketing platforms have also made the shift to mobile. Increasing demand for mobile marketing automation is seen, with 71% marketers believing that mobile marketing is core to their business. The mobile industry continues to be one of the fastest growing industries in the world. The number of apps being created has increased substantially across Apple iOS, Android, and Amazon. It has been reported that Apps account for 89% of mobile media time, while websites take up the other 11% Another important aspect of mobile marketing automation is the use of A/B testing. This is the concept of testing two different marketing platforms on consumers and see which one performs better. After implementing marketing campaigns the A/B testing begins and automatically finds the optimal campaign and continues showing only the winning option. ==References== Category:Marketing software ","title":"Mobile marketing automation"},{"id":"46293294","text":"This is a list of by-elections in Hong Kong, with the names of the incumbent and victor and their respective parties. ==Legislative Council by-elections== SAR Legislative Council (1998 to present) {  - !width=150px By-election !!

He was the son of sculptor Johannes Pfuhl (1846-1914) and a son-in-law to art dealer Athanasios Rhousopoulos (1823-1898). == Biography == He studied under Reinhard Kekul√© von Stradonitz and Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff at the University of Berlin, and later on, performed excavatory work at the necropolis at Thera as an assistant to Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen.Dictionary of Art Historians (biography) In 1905 he received his habilitation at the University of G√∂ttingen, and in 1911, became a \\"full professor\\" at the University of Basel. At Basel he founded the Arch√§ologische Seminar in 1912. Menghin - P√∂tel, Volume 7 edited by Rudolf Vierhaus He remained at Basel until his death in 1940, his successor being Karl Schefold. In 1941 his personal art collection was auctioned in Lucerne. == Works == In 1923 he published his main work, titled Malerei und Zeichnung der Griechen; and during the following year, a shortened version was issued (\\"Meisterwerke griechischer Zeichnung und Malerei\\"), which was later translated into English by John Beazley and published as \\"Masterpieces of Greek Drawing and Painting\\" (1926). In 1946 Hans M√∂bius took charge of compiling Pfuhl's corpus of Greek grave reliefs -- these eventually being published in 1977 as Die ostgriechischen Grabreliefs.

Situated on the northwestern portion of Seward Peninsula, it is the eastern and larger fork of the Agiapuk River. It joins the Agiapuk River in a broad, gravel-filled basin, and for up, is characterized by a wide flood plain and a meandering course. It receives a number of large tributaries from the east, which also have wide floodplains developed in their lower parts. The important tributaries are Portage Creek, Budd Creek, and Igloo Creek, while smaller tributaries are Burke, Gold Run, Dome, and Camp creeks. All of these tributaries received some attention from gold prospectors. The river is easily navigable for small boats for several miles above the mouth of Portage Creek, and the region can also be reached from Teller. Gold had been discovered in the region in September 1901, and a number of the streams were known to be gold-bearing to some extent. ==Tributaries== Above Portage Creek, the American River has an east‚Äìwest course for about . The bed rock at the head of the river consists of the limestones of the Port Clarence formation. These limestones are little altered and are not mineralized to any extent. At the month of Portage Creek, the bed rock consists of calcareous mica-schists and limestones. Portage Creek heads about southwest of Shishmaref Inlet, and flows eastward for several miles in a canyon cut in the plateau which slopes down to that inlet. It then turns southward and flows in a comparatively deep valley for , to its junction with the American River. Through the last before entering the American River, a broad flood plain is developed, within which the creek has a very sinuous course. Along Portage Creek, limestones and calcareous mica-schiste, with occasional beds of graphitic schist, constitute the bed rock. Budd Creek enters the American River from the east, about below Portage Creek. It is in length. About from its mouth, it receives a large tributary, Windy Creek, from the south side. About above its mouth, it forks, the two parts coming from the north and south, their direction being determined by the strike of the bed rocks. The bed rock on Budd Creek is composed of crystalline limestones, calcareous mica-schists, and graphitic schists, usually striking in a north‚Äìsouth direction, and having dips varying from 0¬∞ to 70¬∞. Kugruk Mountain, a few miles east of the forks of Budd Creek, is made up of quartz- mica-schist, which has been thrown up into an anticline. Below the forks, the creek sinks, leaving its bed dry except in times of high water. After flowing underground for about , the creek rises again in a number of springs. This sink occurs where a massive bed of limestone, dipping downstream at a small angle, cuts across the creek. Windy Creek is tributary to Budd Creek from the south about from its mouth. This creek is about long and flows nearly north, parallel to the strike of the bed rock, which consists of more or less flaggy beds of limestone, between which there is a strata of graphitic schist that outcrops along nearly the whole length of the creek. Near the head of the creek, its bed contains many boulders of greenstone, which are derived from sills intruded in the limestone near its head. The valley of Windy Creek is broad and gravel filled. Along the sides of the valley, back from the creek bed, the gravel extends up the slopes, forming some well-marked gravel benches. A cut bank of the creek shows of muck overlying of gravel. Igloo Creek, also called on some maps Lewis Creek, enters the American River a few miles above its junction with the Agiapuk. This creek, like Budd Creek, flows west across the strike of the bed rock, which, as on Budd Creek, consists of limestones, calcareous and graphitic schists, with some intruded sills of greenstone, which are highly altered. Like Budd Creek, Igloo Creek sinks for about a mile of its course, probably in crossing the same bed of limestone that causes the sink on Budd Creek. In its lower course, Igloo Creek meanders over a broad flood plain, from which the hills rise by very gentle slopes to the flat-topped upland. Igloo Creek, except where it sinks in passing over limestone beds, carries a large amount of water. ==References== Category:Rivers of the Seward Peninsula Category:Rivers of Alaska Category:Rivers of Nome Census Area, Alaska Category:Rivers of Unorganized Borough, Alaska ","title":"American River (Agiapuk River tributary)"},{"id":"46293645","text":"Vanity Fair was a 1956‚Äì57 six-part miniseries aired on BBC television.

It was released by Megaforce Records on March 31, 2015. ==Background== American Nights was originally scheduled for a 2014 release by Hollywood Records. During production however, the band had creative disagreements with the label's executives, which led Hollywood to delay the album's release. Lead vocalist Tom Higgenson said of the conflict, \\"They were pushing for songs that the band wasn't 100 percent on. It was kind of like, 'You don't want us to record this song that everybody loves, but you want us to do this one that one of the five guys don't like at all?' It was a really annoying process.\\" After the album was completed, the band decided to leave Hollywood Records altogether and recut the album according to their vision. ==Critical reception== AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted how the band took stabs at replicating Vampire Weekend (\\"Heavy Rotation\\") and Mumford & Sons (\\"Dance Off Time\\") throughout the album while also \\"alternating between giddy, gilded AAA pop (\\"American Nights,\\" \\"Never Working\\") and fleet-footed acoustic ditties (\\"Time to Move On\\"). He concluded that, \\"As befitting their plain-Jane name, there's nothing particularly flashy about the pop of Plain White T's, but on American Nights they construct it and execute it as well as they ever have.\\" Andja Curcic of Renowned for Sound felt the record was at odds with itself over its track listing, praising the title track, \\"Pause\\" and \\"Never Working\\" for their pop-rock/pop-punk elements but found the folk aesthetics of \\"Dance Off Time\\" and \\"Here Comes That Sunrise\\" oft-putting, saying that \\"In the end, the tracks don‚Äôt fit together and you wonder what the Plain White T‚Äôs are trying to achieve.\\" She concluded that, \\"Though there are decent tracks on the album, I felt quite disappointed because nothing felt as honest and emotional as \\"Hey There Delilah\\".

Situated on the northwestern portion of Seward Peninsula, it was included in the Agiapuk River mining district. The Mary River has a length of about and flows into the upper end of Imuruk Basin. About from its mouth, the river forks, the two branches being of about equal size. The lower part of the course of the Mary River is within the flats which border Imuruk Basin. Above these flats, the valleys of the two branches of the Mary River are wide, and within them, the rivers meander over broad flood plains. Between the forks of the river there is a broad, flat-topped ridge, with an elevation of , which is partly covered with washed gravel. At the edge of the Imuruk lowlands, where the Mary River enters them, there are gravel bluffs and isolated gravel buttes. These bluffs and buttes are remnants of a higher gravel plain. On the ridge between the forks of the Mary River, there are two low, rocky buttes, which, on account of the general low relief of the region, stand out as landmarks. These buttes are composed of white crystalline limestone, whose bedding is obscured by jointing and cleavage. Except for these buttes, the bed rock, as indicated by fragments found on the surface, consists of calcareous mica schists. The Kuzitrin slates form a broad belt of dark schistose quartzites between the Mary River and the Kuzitrin at Mary's Igloo. About the heads of the two branches of the Mary River, the bed rock consists of calcareous and graphitic schists similar to those on Igloo and Budd creeks, tributaries of the American River. Little bed rock is exposed on the Mary River.

The Lasers had 3 wins and 11 losses, the worst record in WTT in 2015, and failed to qualify for the playoffs. ==Season recap== Trade for Isner and draft At the WTT Draft on March 16, 2015, it was announced that the Lasers had acquired the top-ranked American player John Isner in a trade with the Boston Lobsters for undisclosed consideration which was presumably financial, since no other players or draft choices were moved in connection with the deal. As the trade was announced, Isner said, \\"I‚Äôm really looking forward to joining the Springfield Lasers. I know Springfield has first-class tennis fans and the Lasers have been extremely close to bringing home the King Trophy the past couple of seasons. I‚Äôm very hopeful to help put them over the top in 2015.\\" In the roster portion of the draft, the Lasers protected Anna-Lena Gr√∂nefeld and Michael Russell and selected Andre Begemann and roster-exempt player Alison Riske. Other player transactions On May 12, 2015, the Lasers signed Shelby Rogers as a substitute player. Rogers was a member of the 2014 WTT Champion Washington Kastles. On July 10, 2015, the Lasers announced that Rogers would miss the 2015 season due to an injury. In her place, the Lasers signed Varvara Lepchenko and Sachia Vickery as substitute players. A season of struggles Things didn't go well for the Lasers from the start of the season. They lost their first four matches with three of those losses coming at home. They finally broke through with a win in front of the home fans on July 17, against the San Diego Aviators. Anna-Lena Gr√∂nefeld and Sachia Vickery earned a key 5‚Äì1 set win in women's doubles to help the cause. Gr√∂nefeld teamed with Andre Begemann in mixed doubles to win the final set in a tiebreaker and close out the victory. On the evening following their first victory, the Lasers visited the Austin Aces, who entered the match with 4 wins and 0 losses. Gr√∂nefeld and Vickery continued their solid play by taking the opening set of women's doubles, 5‚Äì2. Vickery followed with a 5‚Äì1 set win in women's singles, and the Lasers had a 10‚Äì3 lead after two sets. But the Aces turns things around from there. They won the next two sets to cut the Lasers' lead to 16‚Äì13 heading to the final set. Teymuraz Gabashvili overpowered Michael Russell in the final set of men's singles, 5‚Äì2, to tie the match at 18 and send it to a super tiebreaker. Gabashvili dominated the super tiebreaker, 7‚Äì1, as the Aces dealt the Lasers a heartbreaking 19‚Äì18 defeat. After the loss, the Lasers visited the Philadelphia Freedoms the next evening. The Freedoms won the first two sets to take a 10‚Äì6 lead. Russell and Begemann won the men's doubles set, 5‚Äì3, to cut the lead to 13‚Äì11. The Freedoms won the women's doubles set in a tiebreaker and took an 18‚Äì15 lead to the final set. In the men's singles, Russell redeemed himself after letting the previous match get away. He earned a 5‚Äì1 set win over Robby Ginepri that won the match for the Lasers in stunning fashion, 20‚Äì19. After losing their next two matches, the Lasers hosted the Freedoms on July 24. It was marquee player John Isner who made the difference for the Lasers. He teamed with Begemann for a 5‚Äì2 set win in men's doubles that gave the Lasers a 14‚Äì11 lead after three sets. The Freedoms took the fourth set of women's doubles, 5‚Äì2, to tie the match at 16. In the final set, Isner beat Ginepri, 5‚Äì2, to give the Lasers a 21‚Äì18 victory that improved their record to 3 wins and 7 losses. The following evening, the Lasers were eliminated from WTT playoff contention when the California Dream defeated the Boston Lobsters, 21‚Äì19, in extended play, a match which ended during the Lasers' 25‚Äì17 home loss to the Aviators. The loss to the Aviators was the first of four consecutive losses by the Lasers to close the season. ==Event chronology== * March 16, 2015: The Lasers acquired John Isner in a trade with the Boston Lobsters for undisclosed consideration. * March 16, 2015: The Lasers protected Anna-Lena Gr√∂nefeld and Michael Russell and selected Andre Begemann and roster-exempt player Alison Riske in the WTT Draft. * May 12, 2015: The Lasers signed Shelby Rogers as a substitute player. * July 10, 2015: The Lasers signed Varvara Lepchenko and Sachia Vickery as substitute players. * July 25, 2015: With a record of 3 wins and 7 losses, the Lasers were eliminated from WTT playoff contention when the California Dream defeated the Boston Lobsters, 21‚Äì19, in extended play. ==Draft picks== Since the Lasers were the Western Conference champions in 2014, they selected next to last (sixth) in each round of the draft. Unlike previous seasons in which WTT conducted its Marquee Player Draft and its Roster Player Draft on different dates about one month apart, the league conducted a single draft at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden in Indian Wells, California on March 16, 2015. The selections made by the Lasers are shown in the table below. {  style=\\"text-align:left\\" - !3d1e56; color:#25d0ff\\" width=\\"100px\\" Draft type !3d1e56; color:#25d0ff\\" width=\\"50px\\" Round !3d1e56; color:#25d0ff\\" width=\\"50px\\" !3d1e56; color:#25d0ff\\" width=\\"50px\\" !3d1e56; color:#25d0ff\\" width=\\"200px\\" Player chosen !3d1e56; color:#25d0ff\\" width=\\"25px\\" !3d1e56; color:#25d0ff\\" width=\\"100px\\" Notes -

Oxford University Press, 2013. The vessel operated in the Canary Islands until 2014, when she was purchased by the Russian company Magellan LLC. At the time of the accident, the vessel was sailing out of Nevelsk, on the island of Sakhalin. The ship was fishing off the western coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula, in the Sea of Okhotsk in the Russian Far East. \\"At least 56 killed as Russian trawler sinks in icy seas Lidia Kelly, Reuters, Retrieved 2 April 2015 There were 132 crew on board, from Russia, Burma, Ukraine, Latvia and Vanuatu.

Sakhalin governor Oleg Kozhemyako stated that the vessel was overloaded, and that the ship's ballast tanks were not being properly monitored and maintained at the time of the accident. Vladimir Markin, official press agent for the Russian Investigative Committee said the most likely cause was a collision with ice, while Sergey Khabarov, emergencies commission chairman for the Kamchatka region blamed the 80-ton weight of the catch being hauled on board.\\"54 dead after trawler sinks off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula\\", CNN, Ed Payne, Retrieved 2 April 2015 The ship sank so swiftly that the veteran captain, Aleksandr Pritotskiy, did not have time to send a distress signal.

Over two dozen fishing boats aided in the rescue, and the Russian Emergencies Ministry dispatched an Mi-8 helicopter with a medical team and rescue crew. Russian officials said over 1,300 people aided in the rescue effort. ==Aftermath== The Sakhalin branch of the Far East transportation department has launched a criminal investigation for safety violations resulting in the death of two or more persons. Those found guilty could face up to a seven-year sentence. A full crew manifest has been published in the tabloid daily, Komsomolskaya Pravda. The daily reported several irregularities: that the boat was already \\"loaded to the eyeballs\\" with an unmanageable 1150 tons of pollock; that the ship had an insufficient number of lifeboats for the crew; that the ship had been certified as seaworthy, although the captain described it as a worn-out old wreck in constant need of urgent repair; and that the abnormally high number of foreign crew indicated they were underpaid illegal workers. Reuters described the accident as \\"one of Russia's worst maritime disasters in decades\\", part of a \\"poor safety history\\" that included the death of 122 people in 2011 when the tourist boat sank on the Volga River, and the death of over 50 people on board when a drilling rig sank off Sakhalin in the same year. President Putin had faced widespread criticism for his slow reaction to the sinking of the submarine Kursk in 2000, which killed the entire crew of 118. Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted expert sources as saying unanimously that while the crew will inevitably be blamed, the real problem is the system. Magellan LLC has announced it is conducting an internal audit. The government announced that the families of the dead will receive one million rubles from state agencies. ==Reactions== After the sinking, many governments expressed shock and sympathy, and conveyed their nations condolences over the large number of lives lost.

Vaughan was born in Michigan and stayed in Michigan for most of his life contributing to the development and innovation of medical and health services in Michigan. == Early years and education == Henry Frieze Vaughan was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan on October 12, 1880, the 4th of five children of Dora Catherine Taylor Vaughan and Victor C. Vaughan, M.D. Vaughan's parents were both from Missouri. His father was a doctor who held the position of the dean of the University of Michigan Medical School for thirty years. In Ann Arbor, he attended Ann Arbor High School and graduated in 1908.The University of Michigan News and Information Service Faculty and Staff, August 1958, Box 132, Vaughan, Henry F., Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan. At a young age, he was influenced by his father's interest in public health and sanitation issues.BHL: Henry F. Vaughan Papers Unlike his brothers who followed his father's footsteps, he took an alternative route and chose to become an epidemiologist. From then on, he attended the University of Michigan to earn his bachelor's degree in Engineering in 1912, a master's degree in Engineering in 1913, and lastly a doctoral degree in Public Health in 1916 in which he wrote his dissertation on the ‚ÄúObservations on Typhoid Fever in Detroit‚Äù. He was the first person at the University of Michigan to earn the Doctor of Public Health degree.Darling, George B., Robert Brown, and Richard D.

He soon was transferred to the Department of Health in Detroit in 1914 and eventually became an epidemiologist in 1915.The University of Michigan News Service, March 1956, Vaughan, Henry Frieze, Box 1, Biographical Material, Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan. After attaining his Doctoral degree in Public Health, he was appointed as Deputy Commissioner. During World War I, he was assigned by the Surgeon General William C. Gorgas to serve as the Captain of the Sanitary Corps to control the spread of pneumonia in the U.S. military camps from 1917 to 1918. He returned to Detroit in 1919 and was appointed to be the Health Commissioner for the city of Detroit till 1941. == Health Commissioner == At the age of 29, Vaughan was not only the youngest but also one of the few Health Commissioners in the country who did not have a degree in medicine. As health commissioner for the city of Detroit, he saw the need for qualified physician to not only practice curative medicine, but also, preventative medicine.Detroit Health Department Newsletter, Vaughan, Henry Frieze, 1889-1979, Paper, APril 7, Box 1, Biographical Material, Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan. During his time as health commissioner, there were significant cases of smallpox, typhoid fever, and diphtheria; however, many physicians were unaware of the new treatment for these communicable diseases. He initiated a ‚Äúmedical participation‚Äù campaign where physicians were to practice preventative medicine by administering immunization, attend conferences to become up to date on current treatment for these diseases and future health issues, and lastly having the public participate in preventative medicine by allowing public health nurses to come to their houses to periodically check up and educate them.Medical Participation in Public Health Work, Henry F. Vaughan Papers, Box 1, Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan. Vaughan hoped that this campaign will protect a higher percent of children between the ages of six month and ten years against diphtheria, increase the vaccination for small pox, increase periodic health examination, and periodic dental examination. With this in mind, Vaughan emphasized health education because he believed that ‚Äúno community can be more healthful than its citizens‚Äù. It was important to reach every citizen concerning health education but he believed that it was more important to do less and do a more effective work on limited scale. He encouraged the health department to use radio, magazines, and billboards to convey the messages regarding health education and ways to safely prevent one from a disease. He had fought a smallpox epidemic in which he gave the citizens of Detroit the choice of being vaccinated or going home and remaining under police guard for three weeks and a full incubation period.Shoenfield, Allen. U-M Dean of Health School Recalls lifetime of Battles, University of Michigan News and Information Services Faculty and Staff Files, June 7, 1959, Box 132, Vaughan, Henry F., Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan. Furthermore, as commissioner, he had to deal with the problems with garbage disposal because Detroit at that time was growing larger and larger. With the increase in garbage and inadequate method of removing it, Vaughan had decided to incinerate the garbage because it was very economical and very sanitary.Modern Practice in Garbage Disposal, Henry F. Vaughan Papers, Box 1, Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan. Lastly, he was committed to Detroit in bringing up young talented professionals. Vaughan was the Health Commissioner during the Great Depression and without his help, Joseph Molner, John Hanlon, and George Badger would not have had a successful career. Vaughan went to MIT and Harvard to scout for these talented professionals and offered them a job at the Detroit Health Department while they finished their completed their degree in medical education at Wayne State or University of Michigan. == Dean of the University of Michigan School of Public Health == Since 1921, Vaughan was a guest lecturer at the University of Michigan.University of Michigan News and Information Services Faculty and Staff files, June 4, 1959, Box 132, Vaughan, Henry F., Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan. In 1939, Rockefeller Foundation committee concluded that the nation had a shortage of well trained health personnel and should establish schools to train these professions. The University of Michigan responded quickly and agreed to create a school dedicated for that purpose. With the great depression, the University of Michigan Public Health School was made possible by the contribution of a half a million dollar each from the Rockefeller Foundation and the W.K. Kellog Foundation in 1941. The University of Michigan asked Vaughan to come back permanently on July 18, 1941 to be appointed as the first Dean of the Public Health School at the University of Michigan and create the public school from the Division of Hygiene and Public Health. With lack of resources and instructors, the opening of The School of Public Health offered only three departments: Public Health Practice, Epidemiology, and Environmental Health which included public health engineering and industrial health. With Vaughan's expertise in environmental health, the School of Public Health was able to create an enriching curriculum that included 20 courses and a well established environmental health program. Tropical Disease was later added as the fourth department in 1943 because of the US involvement in World War II. By the end of 1949, there were a total of 15 departments. Vaughn emphasized public health research and developed virology and parasitic diseases, tropical disease, industrial health, and public health engineering laboratories. These laboratories were supported by the Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, Inc., the United States Public Health Service and other organizations. Among the breakthroughs in disease control during his deanship, the public health school contributed through the development of the first influenza vaccine by Dr. Thomas Francis Jr. and the polio vaccine by Dr. Jonas Salk in 1954.Bush, Larry. U-M‚Äôs first health dean, Henry Vaughan, dies at 89, March 16, 1979, The University of Michigan News and Information Services Faculty and Staff files, Box 132, Vaughan, Henry F., Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan. Vaughan was heavily involved with the construction of the Public Health Building. He was also able to attain Nathan Sinai, Thomas Francis, and Kenneth Easlick as faculties who are highly regarded in the field of public health to establish a real competence in health services organization and epidemiology. By the end of retirement in 1960, Vaughan created a school that is the largest program in environmental and industrial health in any academic institution in the country and whose graduates were highly sought out for positions in public health leadership worldwide. == National Sanitation Foundation == In 1944, Vaughan, Walter F. Snyder, the Director of the Environment Sanitation Program for the health department of Toledo, and Nathan Sinai, one of the School of Public Health faculty were discussing the problems concerning sanitation. At the time, there was no basic research in sanitary science, no accepted uniform sanitation standards, and many sanitation regulations conflicted with each other. They believed that the nation would be better if there was a ‚Äúnationwide environmental health regulation from the collaboration of health officials and all levels of government, manufacturers producing health related equipment, users of such equipment, and institutional consultants with expert knowledge of equipment design of health protection‚Äù. With this method, they believed they will arrive with better results than through the use of ordinances, inspections, and law enforcement. From this motivation, the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF), currently named NSF International, was created in October 1944. Vaughan acted as the President, Sinai as vice president, and Snyder as Treasurer and Executive Director. With the approval of the board of regents, the University of Michigan allowed the National Sanitation Foundation and the laboratory to be operating in the basement of the Public Health Building. The NSF standardized sanitation and developed food safety requirements.

Online content analysis is a form of content analysis for analysis of Internet-based communication. ==History and definition== Content analysis as a systematic examination and interpretation of communication dates back to at least the 17th century. However, it was not until the rise of the newspaper in the early 20th century that the mass production of printed material created a demand for quantitative analysis of printed words. Berelson‚Äôs (1952) definition provides an underlying basis for textual analysis as a \\"research technique for the objective, systematic and quantitative description of the manifest content of communication.\\" Content analysis consists of categorizing units of texts (i.e. sentences, quasi-sentences, paragraphs, documents, web pages, etc.) according to their substantive characteristics in order to construct a dataset that allows the analyst to interpret texts and draw inferences. While content analysis is often quantitative, researchers conceptualize the technique as inherently mixed methods because textual coding requires a high degree of qualitative interpretation. Social scientists have used this technique to investigate research questions concerning mass media, media effects and agenda setting. With the rise of online communication, content analysis techniques have been adapted and applied to internet research. As with the rise of newspapers, the proliferation of online content provides an expanded opportunity for researchers interested in content analysis. While the use of online sources presents new research problems and opportunities, the basic research procedure of online content analysis outlined by McMillan (2000) is virtually indistinguishable from content analysis using offline sources: # Formulate a research question with a focus on identifying testable hypotheses that may lead to theoretical advancements. # Define a sampling frame that a sample will be drawn from, and construct a sample (often called a ‚Äòcorpus‚Äô) of content to be analyzed. # Develop and implement a coding scheme that can be used to categorize content in order to answer the question identified in step 1. This necessitates specifying a time period, a context unit in which content is embedded, and a coding unit which categorizes the content. # Train coders to consistently implement the coding scheme and verify reliability among coders. This is a key step in ensuring replicability of the analysis. # Analyze and interpret the data. Test hypotheses advanced in step 1 and draw conclusions about the content represented in the dataset. ==Content analysis in internet research== Since the rise of online communication, scholars have discussed how to adapt textual analysis techniques to study web-based content. The nature of online sources necessitates particular care in many of the steps of a content analysis compared to offline sources. While offline content such as printed text remains static once produced, online content can frequently change. The dynamic nature of online material combined with the large and increasing volume of online content can make it challenging to construct a sampling frame from which to draw a random sample. The content of a site may also differ across users, requiring careful specification of the sampling frame. Some researchers have used search engines to construct sampling frames. This technique has disadvantages because search engine results are unsystematic and non-random making them unreliable for obtaining an unbiased sample. The sampling frame issue can be circumvented by using an entire population of interest, such as tweets by particular Twitter users or online archived content of certain newspapers as the sampling frame. Changes to online material can make categorizing content (step 3) more challenging. Because online content can change frequently it is particularly important to note the time period over which the sample is collected. A useful step is to archive the sample content in order to prevent changes from being made. Online content is also non-linear. Printed text has clearly delineated boundaries that can be used to identify context units (e.g., a newspaper article). The bounds of online content to be used in a sample are less easily defined. Early online content analysts often specified a ‚ÄòWeb site‚Äô as a context unit, without a clear definition of what they meant. Researchers recommend clearly and consistently defining what a ‚Äòweb page‚Äô consists of, or reducing the size of the context unit to a feature on a website. Researchers have also made use of more discrete units of online communication such as web comments or tweets. King (2008) used an ontology of terms trained from many thousands of pre- classified documents to analyse the subject matter of a number of search engines. ==Automatic content analysis== The rise of online content has dramatically increased the amount of digital text that can be used in research. The quantity of text available has motivated methodological innovations in order to make sense of textual datasets that are too large to be practically hand-coded as had been the conventional methodological practice. Advances in methodology together with the increasing capacity and decreasing expense of computation has allowed researchers to use techniques that were previously unavailable to analyze large sets of textual content. Automatic content analysis represents a slight departure from McMillan's online content analysis procedure in that human coders are being supplemented by a computational method, and some of these methods do not require categories to be defined in advanced. Quantitative textual analysis models often employ 'bag of words' methods that remove word ordering, delete words that are very common and very uncommon, and simplify words through lemmatisation or stemming that reduces the dimensionality of the text by reducing complex words to their root word. While these methods are fundamentally reductionist in the way they interpret text, they can be very useful if they are correctly applied and validated. Grimmer and Stewart (2013) identify two main categories of automatic textual analysis: supervised and unsupervised methods. Supervised methods involve creating a coding scheme and manually coding a sub-sample of the documents that the researcher wants to analyze. Ideally, the sub-sample, called a 'training set' is representative of the sample as a whole. The coded training set is then used to 'teach' an algorithm the how the words in the documents correspond to each coding category. The algorithm can be applied to automatically analyze the remained of the documents in the corpus. * Dictionary Methods: the researcher pre-selects a set of keywords (n-gram) for each category. The machine then uses these keywords to classify each text unit into a category. * Individual Methods: the researcher pre-labels a sample of texts and trains a machine learning algorithm (i.e. SVM algorithm) using those labels. The machine labels the remainder of the observations by extrapolating information from the training set. * Ensemble Methods: instead of using only one machine-learning algorithm, the researcher trains a set of them and uses the resulting multiple labels to label the rest of the observations (see Collingwood and Wiklerson 2011 for more details).Collingwood, Loren and John Wilkerson. (2011). Tradeoffs in Accuracy and Efficiency in supervised Learning Methods, in The Journal of Information Technology and Politics, Paper 4. * Supervised Ideological Scaling (i.e. wordscores) is used to place different text units along an ideological continuum. The researcher selects two sets of texts that represent each ideological extreme, which the algorithm can use to identify words that belong to each extreme point. The remainder of the texts in the corpus are scaled depending on how many words of each extreme reference they contain. Unsupervised methods can be used when a set of categories for coding cannot be well-defined prior to analysis. Unlike supervised methods, human coders are not required to train the algorithm. One key choice for researchers when applying unsupervised methods is selecting the number of categories to sort documents into rather than defining what the categories are in advance. * Single membership models: these models automatically cluster texts into different categories that are mutually exclusive, and documents are coded into one and only one category. As pointed out by Grimmer and Stewart (16), \\"each algorithm has three components: (1) a definition of document similarity or distance; (2) an objective function that operationalizes and ideal clustering; and (3) an optimization algorithm.\\" * Mixed membership models: According also to Grimmer and Stewart (17), mixed membership models \\"improve the output of single-membership models by including additional and problem-specific structure.\\" Mixed membership FAC models classifies individual words within each document into categories, allowing the document as a whole to be a part of multiple categories simultaneously. Topic models represent one example of mixed membership FAC that can be used to analyze changes in focus of political actors or newspaper articles. One of the most used topic modeling technique is LDA. *Unsupervised Ideological Scaling (i.e. wordsfish): algorithms that allocate text units into an ideological continuum depending on shared grammatical content. Contrary to supervised scaling methods such as wordscores, methods such as wordfishSlapin, Jonathan, and Sven-Oliver Proksch. 2008. A scaling model for estimating time-series party positions from texts. American Journal of Political Science 52(3):705‚Äì22. do not require that the researcher provides samples of extreme ideological texts.  Validation  Results of supervised methods can be validated by drawing a distinct sub- sample of the corpus, called a 'validation set'. Documents in the validation set can be hand-coded and compared to the automatic coding output to evaluate how well the algorithm replicated human coding. This comparison can take the form of inter-coder reliability scores like those used to validate the consistency of human coders in traditional textual analysis. Validation of unsupervised methods can be carried out in several ways. * Semantic (or internal) validity represents how well documents in each identified cluster represent a distinct, categorical unit. In a topic model, this would be the extent to which the documents in each cluster represent the same topic. This can be tested by creating a validation set that human coders use to manually validate topic choice or the relatedness of within-cluster documents compared to documents from different clusters. * Predictive (or external) validity is the extent to which shifts in the frequency of each cluster can be explained by external events. If clusters of topics are valid, the topics that are most prominent should respond across time in a predictable way as a result of outside events that occur. == Challenges in online textual analysis == Despite the continuous evolution of text-analysis in the social science, there are still some unsolved methodological concerns. This is a (non-exclusive) list with some of this concerns: * When should researchers define their categories? Ex-ante, back-and-forth, or ad-hoc? Some social scientists argue that researchers should build their theory, expectations and methods (in this case specific categories they will use to classify different text units) before they start collecting and studying the dataKing, Gary, Robert O. Keohane, & Sidney Verba. (1994). Designing Social Inquiry: Scientific Inference in Qualitative Research. Princeton: Prince University Press. whereas some others support that defining a set of categories is a back-and-forth process.Saldana Johnny. (2009). The Coding Manual for Qualitative Research. London: SAGE Publication Ltd. * Validation. Although most researchers report validation measurements for their methods (i.e. inter-coder reliability, precision and recall estimates, confusion matrices, etc.), some others do not. In particular, a larger number of academics are concerned about how some topic modeling techniques can hardly be validated.Chuang, Jason, John D. Wilkerson, Rebecca Weiss, Dustin Tingley, Brandon M. Stewart, Margaret E. Roberts, Forough Poursabzi-Sangdeh, Justin Grimmer, Leah Findlater, Jordan Boyd-Graber, and Jeffrey Heer. (2014). Computer-Assisted Content Analysis: Topic Models for Exploring Multiple Subjective Interpretations. Paper presented at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS). Workshop on HumanPropelled Machine Learning. Montreal, Canada. * Random Samples. On the one hand, it is extremely hard to know how many units of one type of texts (for example blogposts) are in a certain time in the Internet. Thus, since most of the time the universe is unknown, how can researcher select a random sample? If in some cases is almost impossible to get a random sample, should researchers work with samples or should they try to collect all the text units that they observer? And on the other hand, sometimes researchers have to work with samples that are given to them by some search engines (i.e. Google) and online companies (i.e. Twitter) but the research do not have access to how these samples have been generated and whether they are random or not. Should researches use such samples? == See also == * Content analysis * Text mining == References == ","title":"Online content analysis"},{"id":"46294006","text":"Reginald \\"Reg\\" Schumann was an Australian rules footballer and a captain of the Port Adelaide Football Club in 1949.

He became the first superintendent of the United Pentecostal Church International, after it was formed from the merger of two Oneness Pentecostal organizations. Previously, he had been an original member of the Assemblies of God, until he left it after it strongly affirmed the Trinitarian position. == Early life and Conversion == Goss was born in Steelville, Missouri in 1883. In 1898 his father moved his family to Galena, Kansas. Goss converted to Christianity in high school in 1902, when Evangelist Charles Parham arrived in Galena and began preaching the new Apostolic Faith, known now was the Pentecostal message. Goss claims to owe his conversion to listening to people speak in tongues. After his conversion, he dedicated his life to serving God. Upon graduating high school, Goss went to Houston to attend Parham's Bible School. When the term ended, Goss received his first leadership position for the revival in Angleton, which was deemed as a success. Although at this time he was able to understand tongues, he was unable to speak it himself. While in Houston working at Brunner Tabernacle when Lucy Farrow, an African-American preacher, who had just returned from the Azusa Street revival, prayed for him and he spoke in tongues again. From that time forward he was \\"able to speak in tongues at any time I yielded to the Spirit of God.\\" == Career == By 1907, Goss and the majority of the Apostolic Faith Movement broke with Parham. Shortly after, Goss and his first wife Millicent preached revivals around Texas and eventually Arkansas. It was in Arkansas that Goss did his prime ministry, this state became the center of the movement populated by the remnants of the Apostolic Faith group. Arkansas was also the place they began to refer to themselves as \\"Pentecostals\\" instead of \\"Apostolic Faith Group\\" in order to disaffiliate with controversial scandals associated with Parham. In the fall of 1909 Goss and his wife settled in Malvern Arkansas which became his focal point during this time and they experiences great success in their revivals. After the death of Millicent, Goss resided in Malvern where he hosted a camp meeting. Soon after Goss accepted the message of William Durham regarding the finished work, a controversial topic at the Malvern camp. Goss traveled and did many tent revivals including an inter-state camp meeting in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, where he met his second wife Ethel Wright. The newlyweds entered itinerant evangelistic work and would go on to have six children. The attempted measures for cooperation between ministers and churches that had developed after the collapse of Parham's Apostolic Faith movement in 1907 were deemed insufficient. Goss and the remnants of the Apostolic Faith group brokered a \\"gentleman's agreement\\" with this group to become the Churches of God in Christ. December 20, 1913 issue of Word and Witness contained a call for an exploratory meeting for a new organization to be held in April 1914 in Hot Springs, Arkansas. The call listed five purposes for the new organization. This meeting was the birthplace of the Assemblies of God, which would go on to become the largest Pentecostal organization in the world. R.E. McAlister gave his message held at the camp meeting, stating that the apostles baptized their converts once in the name of Jesus, this became known as \\"The New Issue.\\" It was from this message that the Oneness Movement was launched. The heated debate over the New Issue raged within the Assemblies of God; however, opponents of the message quickly brought it to a head and an eventual parting of the ways. Goss fully embraced the Oneness position at a time when the leadership of the new organization was determined to deal decisively on the New Issue. Over the strong objections of the Oneness adherents, the council accepted the Statement of Fundamental Truths, which strongly affirmed the Trinitarian position and rejected the Oneness view. As a result, the Oneness proponents were forced out of the fellowship. Goss being one of the people kicked out, got involved with the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada (PAOC). Goss resigned his Toronto congregation in 1937. Goss became involved with what may have been his most challenging organizational work, the merger of the Pentecostal Church Incorporated (PCI) and the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ (PA of JC). September 25, 1945, the two organizations officially became one. Howard Goss was the almost- unanimous choice for general superintendent. ==References== Category:1898 births Category:1964 deaths Category:American Pentecostal pastors ","title":"Howard A.

After studying law at the University of Adelaide, Spencer left South Australia at the age of 18. He lived and worked in the USA, India and Europe for 35 years before returning to Adelaide in 2009. He worked in the not-for-profit sector before starting an IT business in 1989. That business was acquired by Capgemini twenty years later. While abroad, Spencer was inducted to the Chicago Area Entrepreneur Hall of Fame in 2003 and was named Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of The Year for the Illinois Region in 2005. Raymond is a Laureate of the Computerworld Honors Program, which recognises use of information technology to produce and promotes positive social change. Following his return to South Australia, he was appointed Chairman of South Australia's Economic Development Board on 1 January 2011. In 2013 he received an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Arizona. Spencer has consistently expressed pride in his South Australian heritage and has described what he calls the \\"South Australian DNA\\" as containing \\"innovation, creativity and industriousness.\\" He has encouraged South Australian businesses to think globally and aggressively add value to existing products and services. He urged for investment in ports in 2013, and was buoyant about agricultural, mining and manufacturing sectors. He has encouraged the state to take on debt to build critical infrastructure and said that if he were able to, he would take state debt to 20% of Gross State Product and invest in infrastructure immediately. He also advocated for planning system reform in order \\"to force economic growth and improve our quality of living\\" and said \\"we need to sell South Australia.\\" Spencer believes that \\"value adding\\" to support growth in the resources sector presents economic opportunities for South Australia. He said in 2013: \\"Building businesses in the value chain that is going to support the resources industry. That's where the really big bang from the resources industry really comes.\\" In 2013, Spencer also stated that he believed there was no future for the automotive industry in South Australia without subsidy, and that subsidies should be extended for a period of years while the state builds its advanced manufacturing capacity. He suggested that South Australia should \\"work like hell to create more and more advanced manufacturing, expand the defense industry [and] get the services businesses to the resources industry in place that will attract a lot of those skills.\\" In 2014, Spencer was an investor in, board chairman or director of: a winery, a mining company, an energy company and a number of technology start-ups. As of 2015, Spencer remains an investor in and director of private companies, is a member of the investment committee of three US-based venture capital funds and is a director of Rubicon Technology. Spencer is also Chairman of Capgemini's Financial Services Global Business Unit and Signostics Limited and has acted as an advisor to corporations and not-for-profit groups. Spencer is optimistic about economic opportunities of South Australia's Mining industry, renewable energy resources, its agricultural products and emerging knowledge economy. He also believes that South Australia should consider major tax reform to make the region more attractive to investment and that the State's public sector needs to become more \\"customer\\" and \\"outcome\\" focused. He has advocated for tax reform since his appointment to the Economic Development Board and has been involved in an investigation undertaken by ICAC following the Gillman land sale controversy. == Gillman land sale == In 2013, Spencer received a proposal from former Santos chairman Stephen Gerlach of Adelaide Capital Partners for the purchase and use of a 407 hectare site of public land at Gillman in South Australia. The land was sold for $122 million without being put to tender, and has since become the subject of an investigation by South Australia's Independent Commissioner Against Corruption (ICAC). Premier Jay Weatherill alleged that Spencer brought him the proposal and asked for it to be \\"entertained\\". Spencer later attended a meeting between ACP and the Premier, and was subsequently contacted by ACP to discuss the possibility of fast- tracking the process. == Personal life == Spencer was born in Clarendon, South Australia.

He is the author of numerous refereed articles and books which focus on cultural interface and conflict. His work on political violence and terrorism has been particularly important for government, community and media debate. Lewis is also a documentary-maker and musician. Lewis's academic work has sought to re- politicise the concept of 'culture', re-building poststructural and psychoanalytic theory into a more distinctive zone of political critique.J. Yakeley and J, Meloy (2012) 'Understanding violence: does psychoanalytic thinking matter?' Aggression and Violent Behavior. doi:10.1016/j.avb.2012.02.006 He argues, for example, that militant organisations like al-Qa'eda and ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) represent the failure of Enlightenment liberalism and the ideals of freedom. According to Lewis, it is simply inadequate to define these militant organisations as the ideological opposite to western democratic states. Consequently, it is too simplistic to explain the war against ISIS in terms of familiar dichotomies‚ÄîIslam/the West, tradition/modernity, theocracy/democracy, repression/freedom. Nor is it appropriate to explain the Islmaist militant attacks on the French satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo, (2015) as an over- assertion of western freedom of speech rights, which showed little respect for Islam and western Muslims. While progressive journalists at the New York Times believed that western states need to reconcile speech freedom with respect for pluralism, Lewis (2015b) argues that speech freedom actually doesn't exist in the west. Speech and other freedoms are not equally distributed in western states, but are subject to the violent hierarchies around which these states are organised. Until we have equality of speech, Lewis contends, there can never be 'freedom of speech' or anything else. Lewis has also famously argued that humans of the advanced world are the most violent beings of all times. Challenging people like Steven Pinker, Lewis claims that war epidemiology, mass species extinction and the amplified violence of social hierarchies are clear evidence of modern humans' violence. Citizens of the advanced world both consciously and subliminally transfer their displeasures to other human groups and species across the planet.John Gray, \\"Steven Pinker is wrong\\", The Guardian, 11 March 2015. https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/13/john- gray-steven-pinker-wrong-violence-war-declining Lewis has made a major contribution to the field of Cultural Studies, particularly through the conceptualisation on 'transculturalism'. Lewis argues that culture represents an 'uneven' dispersion of stability and perpetual change. Whether by ecological necessity, conflict, revolution or slow integration and adaptation, social groups exist within the perpetual volition of change and hybridisation.A. Hepp, (2015) Transcultural Communication, Wiley Blackwell, London. Culture is always in a state of becoming. Other Cultural Studies scholars have drawn similar conclusions, promoting a 'poststructural' conception of culture which surrenders political critique. However, Lewis (2005, 2008, 2012) insists that political critique is essential for Cultural Studies and the humanities more generally. Accordingly, while agreeing with Alain Badiou and other critics of the utopian fantasy of 'human rights',Lewis has focused on the movable but insistent problem of social hierarchies and political violence.A. Badiou, Ethics: An Essay on the Understanding of Evil, Verso, London. Lewis has deployed this 'cultural politics' critique for his various studies on political violence, disasters and development studies in Indonesia and other parts of the non-western world. == References  Bibliography == *Jeff Lewis, Extremity of the Skies, Flinders Publishing, Melbourne 2000 (reprint) *Jeff Lewis, Language Wars: The Role of Media and Culture in Global Terror and Political Violence Pluto Books, London, 2005.

Gray started creating stone balancing sculptures in 2002. Gray's work is predominantly sculpture and photography based on balancing natural elements. He creates sculptures using naturally weathered stone, usually on location by the coast. As the sculptures are transitory, he films them as evidence of their existence. To show live examples of his work he performs demonstrations where he creates new sculptures on site. In 2010 his work began to evolve to include new ideas and themes, but the predominant feature remains the beauty and seemingly impossible nature of balance. His sculptures for the garden and indoors are previously balanced compositions fixed permanently in position. The owners of the sculptures have a film of their creation to remind them of their once precarious state. == Exhibitions == * In 2016, Gray completed a commission for a stone balancing sculpture at an eco-tourism development on Sri Lanka's Yala coast. In spring 2017 he completed a similar piece for a private client in Ibiza. * Gray exhibited at his own trade stand at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show 2015 and 2016. * In 2015 Gray completed his largest-ever stonebalancing sculpture, \\"Trust in Nature\\". Nearly five metres tall and made of two Bodmin granite boulders, it was first assembled on Bodmin Moor, where it remained for a week. Gray then moved it to the RHS garden at Rosemoor in Devon for their winter sculpture exhibition (the two parts of the sculpture are fixed together for safety), and also took the piece to London for the RHS Chelsea Flower Show 2016. The balancing process on Bodmin was filmed for BBC1's The One Show and broadcast on 25 November. * Gray worked with photographer Mikael Buck to create a series of images for the Isle of Man Tourism Division. The photos show Gray's stone balancing sculptures in natural locations on the island, and were released on 14 July 2015. * Domaine de Chaumont international Garden Festival 2014 exhibiting with Hay Young Hwang * Chelsea Flower Show 2014 Exhibiting in Patrick Collins's show garden, \\"A Garden for First Touch at St George's\\".

It depicts Eurydice and was installed in 1972‚Äì1973 as part of the South Park Blocks Urban Renewal Development Project. The fountain is one of four maintained by PSU, along with Walk of Heroines at Hoffman Hall, another in front of the Student Health and Counseling Building, and one at Urban Plaza. The sculpture has always been surrounded by water but the fountain, which continually recycles 227 gallons of water, was not added until the 1990s. In 2009, PSU partnered with the City of Portland and the sculpture's owners to repair the fountain, which had not worked for nearly a decade. Repairs cost $6,000 and were funded in part by rentals on the South Park Blocks. Work included installation of new fountain heads, lights, and wiring, and re-sealing underwater surfaces. The repairs were completed by three PSU employees. Farewell to Orpheus has been described as a \\"seating refuge\\" for students and included in published walking tours of the city. ==See also== * 1968 in art * 1973 in art * Fountains in Portland, Oregon * Greek mythology in western art and literature * Orpheus and Eurydice ==References * Farewell to Orpheus, 1973 at cultureNOW Category:1973 establishments in Oregon Category:1973 sculptures Category:Bronze sculptures in Oregon Category:Fountains in Portland, Oregon Category:Greek Antiquity in art and culture Category:Nude sculptures in Oregon Category:Orpheus Category:Outdoor sculptures in Portland, Oregon Category:Portland State University campus Category:Sculptures of Greco-Roman mythology Category:Sculptures of women Category:South Park Blocks Category:Statues in Portland, Oregon ","title":"Farewell to Orpheus"},{"id":"46294165","text":"Sector 56 (commonly known as Phase 6) is residential and entry level sector located in Chandigarh .

It is notable as the species in which palytoxin was discovered and from which it was first isolated.Clayden, J., Greeves, N. (2000), pages 19‚Äì21 ==Description== P. toxica is an encrusting species with a firm, tough cuticle. The polyps are partially embedded in a cushiony mat of coenenchyme which grows across the rock surface, and which incorporates sand grains and fragments of debris. The oral disc of each polyp is broad and has a fringe of tentacles. The polyps can close up and be retracted into the coenenchyme, which then displays a pitted surface. The colour of this species is variable but is usually some shade of cream, grey or pale brown. ==History== A Hawaiian legend relates how in a rock pool in the Hana district on the island of Maui there was to be found an alga known to the locals as \\"limu-make-o-Hana\\" ('seaweed of death from Hana'). The exact location of the pool was known to only a few individuals and visiting it was taboo. In 1961, intrigued by this, researchers searched for the location and discovered the zoanthid. Although advised by local people not to do so, they took some specimens away with them. On that very day, the laboratories of the Hawaiian Institute of Marine Biology on Coconut Island, Oahu were destroyed by fire. The toxic effects of this species were known to the early inhabitants of Hawaii, and the zoanthids were applied by them to the tips of their weapons, or according to one account, under severe threat, the warriors could overcome the taboo and dip their spear tips into the pool for them to become lethal. ==Distribution and habitat== P. toxica was first discovered in the small district of Muolea on the island of Maui in Hawaii. Its habitat was a shallow pool about deep which was subject to inflows of fresh water during periods of heavy rainfall, so it would appear to be a euryhaline species. The zoanthid has since been discovered in a few other locations in the Hawaiian islands. ==Palytoxin== P. toxica contains palytoxin, one of the most poisonous substances known. This zoanthid is not the only member of its genus to contain the toxin; that distinction is shared by P. tuberculosa. The latter species has a seasonal cycle, varying in toxicity at different times of year, whereas P. toxica is equally toxic all year round. Other species of Palythoa have also been shown to contain the substance in varying amounts at different times and in different places, and some algae and certain crabs and fish have been found to contain it. It has been suggested that the toxin is actually produced by a dinoflagellate, Ostreopsis spp., and incorporated into the zoanthid tissues, possibly through a symbiotic relationship similar to that of zooxanthellae in coral. ==In aquaria== Fishkeepers keep P. toxica and other species of the genus in reef aquariums. This practice has led to poisonings of hobbyists who have carelessly handled the organisms.Botana (2014), p. 1079 ==References== Category:Palythoa Category:Animals described in 1971 ","title":"Palythoa toxica"},{"id":"46294169","text":"Under Fire (stylized as Tom Clancy Under Fire, Tom Clancy: Under Fire, or Tom Clancy's Under Fire in the United Kingdom) is a political thriller novel, written by Grant Blackwood and released on June 16, 2015. It is the first book in the Jack Ryan Jr. series, which is part of the overall Tom Clancy universe, as well as Blackwood's first solo contribution to the franchise. In the novel, Ryan must choose between his country and his mysterious friend Seth Gregory, who is involved in Dagestan's struggle for independence from the Russian Federation. The book debuted at number four on the New York Times bestseller list. ==Plot summary== While on a routine intelligence gathering trip for The Campus in Tehran, Iran, Jack Ryan, Jr. visits his old college friend Seth Gregory for lunch. After their conversation, Gregory leaves with a cryptic comment that ‚Äúthere are steaks in the freezer.‚Äù The next day, Ryan is met by Raymond Wellesley of British intelligence and Matthew Spellman, his American counterpart, who tell him that Gregory, who works with them on an intelligence operation, had gone rogue; they warn him to stay away from his old friend. This piques Ryan's interest. Ryan later goes to Gregory's apartment, but is later abducted by an unknown group of men. He manages to escape just as a mysterious woman pulls up in a car to fetch him away from his abductors. The woman introduces herself as Ysabel Kashani, an Iranian national who is also Gregory's college friend. They return to his apartment and retrieve an old document from a safe, which combination was found with ‚Äústeaks in the freezer‚Äù. Ryan and Kashani later go to Azerbaijan, where they are met by Gregory and Spellman. Ryan discovers that his old friend is an agent for the Central Intelligence Agency, and that his father, Paul, was a legend in the CIA until he was branded as a traitor and committed suicide. He further finds out that Gregory is taking part in an intelligence operation with Wellesley and Spellman, which is to facilitate a coup in Dagestan, and that the document he and Kashani retrieved has coordinates for internet hubs to be used during the coup (Gregory's father had originally written the document). However, Dagestani interior minister Rebaz Medzhid, who is being lined up to be Dagestan's president, refuses to participate unless his daughter Aminat, who has been kidnapped, is rescued. Ryan agrees to extract her from her captors in Scotland, and later helps discredit a smear story planted by the Russians against Medzhid about his involvement in atrocities against Dagestanis years ago by rescuing the ‚Äúwitness‚Äù, who is being coerced by the Russians. Ryan's boss, Gerry Hendley, sends his cousin Dominic ‚ÄúDom‚Äù Caruso to help him. They later discover that Wellesley plans to sabotage the coup by using armored trucks named Krasukhas that have the ability to jam electronic signals coming from the internet hubs that are to be used in the coup. In addition, he had also arranged for the kidnappings of Aminat and the ‚Äúwitness‚Äù to the Russian smear story. He and Caruso later destroy the Krasukhas. Later, Russian President Valeri Volodin deploys border troops to Makhachkala in an effort to stop the coup. Ryan sniffs out a mole in Medzhid's security detail; Gregory is killed in the resulting altercation with the mole, who is one of Medzhid's bodyguards. Meanwhile, Medzhid makes a last-ditch effort to stop the Russian troops by appealing to their leader, suggesting that he is being manipulated by Volodin and telling him to go back and report no disturbance in Makhachkala. The colonel agrees and the standoff is averted. Ryan, Caruso and Kashani later find out that Wellesley had misused government funds and was acting on behalf of the Russians. After being reported by the trio to the British, Wellesley is arrested by British agents as he tries to escape Azerbaijan. ==Characters== * Jack Ryan, Jr.: Operations officer, The Campus * Seth Gregory: Operations officer, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) * Raymond Wellesley: Operations officer, Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) * Matthew Spellman: Operations officer, CIA * Ysabel Kashani: Iranian national, later Jack's love interest * Rebaz Medzhid: Dagestan minister of internal affairs * Dominic ‚ÄúDom‚Äù Caruso: Operations officer, The Campus * Gavin Biery: Director of information technology, The Campus * Oleg Pechkin: Operations officer, Foreign Intelligence Service.

The town's main club Warragul Seagulls had over one hundred players wanting to play. While some resorted to finding clubs out of town the demand for a second town side was still there. A committee of enthusiastic people looked at establishing a working man football club from the workers at the local factories.

He was the first clerk of the court of the Nome judicial division of Alaska. ==Background== Borchsenius was born in Madison, Wisconsin. His father, Hans Borchsenius, was a Danish-born newspaperman and politician. His mother, Martha M. Bakke, was born in Norway, a daughter of Hans E. Bakke, of Copenhagen. He had a brother William Carl and a sister Dora H. When Borchsenius was 12 years old, he moved with his parents to Baldwin, Wisconsin. He attended the public schools of Wisconsin and subsequently was graduated from the law department of University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. ==Career== While a resident of Baldwin he learned the printers trade. At a later period, he engaged in the hardware and general mercantile business, and subsequently, with his father and brother, conducted a real estate and loan agency under the firm name of H. Borchsenius & Sons. In 1885, he returned to Madison and assisted in the compilation of the state census. Following the completion of this work, he was employed in the executive office by Governor Jeremiah McLain Rusk, and at a later date was connected with the land office. In 1891, he returned to Baldwin, and for a period of four years was in the real estate and loan business. In 1895, he went back to Madison as assistant to the state treasurer. He was in Madison in 1899 when the reports of the Eldorado at Nome reached the states, and he determined to try his fortune in the newly discovered gold fields. In the spring of 1900, he received the appointment of Clerk of the U. S. District Court, and arrived in Nome and entered upon the discharge of his duties July 9. In July 1901, he was retired by Arthur H. Noyes, (1854-1915) who had been appointed United States Federal Judge for the District of Alaska. In a fraudulent scheme to seize rich mining claims, Alexander McKenzie, Republican National Committeeman for North Dakota, had secured the appointment of his hand-picked candidates for the government positions, including that of federal judge. One year later, Borchsenius was re-appointed to the office by Judge Albert S. Moore of San Francisco. By 1904, was the only one of the first federal appointees in Nome who filled the office to which he was first appointed. Borchsenius later acquired by purchase, considerable mining property in the vicinity of Nome, and expended near $25,000 in its development. He was the owner of No. 12 Anvil Creek and three benches adjoining and near the very rich Mattie claim. He owned or had a controlling interest in Specimen Gulch property from Anvil Creek to Summit Bench. Pay was not struck until 1904. Besides these properties Borchsenius owned some quartz claims between Rock and Lindblom Creeks. ==Personal life== September 14, 1887, Borchsenius and Lula M. Bockus were married in Baldwin. Harold, their only child, was born December 4, 1891.

It serves as the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site declaration for the Historic Town of Vigan in 1999. ==History== When Juan de Salcedo came to Vigan, he renamed the town to Villa Fernandina in honor of the young son of King Philip II. Upon the orders of Salcedo in 1574, the first temporary church of Vigan was built out of wood and thatch. With Salcedo is Augustinian priest Alonso de Alvarado who first attempted to Christianize the Ilocos region. The need to construct a permanent church and convent in Vigan was decided by the Augustinian Chapter on April 30, 1575. It became the first parish in Northern Luzon. The plans to construct the church failed since in 1577, the Augustinians vacated Ilocos. The Franciscans then came to Ilocos with Father Sebastian de Baesa as priest of Vigan. In 1591, the supervision was transferred to the secular clergy. Father Gabriel dela Cruz became the first secular priest of Vigan until 1598. When the Augustinians returned to Ilocos in 1586, they also handled Vigan alternately with the secular clergy. On February 14, 1622, Vigan was officially transferred from the Augustinians to the secular. The first church was built in 1641 and was damaged by earthquake in 1619 and 1627. A third church was burned in 1739. Upon the request of then Bishop Juan de la Fuente Yepes, the seat of the Diocese of Nueva Segovia was transferred from Lal-lo, Cagayan to Ciudad Fernandina de Vigan (present-day Vigan) through a ceremonial procession on September 7, 1758. With the transfer of the seat of the Diocese, the church of Vigan became a cathedral on that same year. Governor General Jose de Basco ordered the establishment of a new church in 1786. The fourth and present-day church was built from 1790 to 1800 under the Augustinians. It was occupied by the revolutionists under Colonel Juan Villamor in 1896 and by the American forces under Lieutenant Colonel James Parker in 1899. ==Features== The church is predominantly in Earthquake Baroque style with large buttresses on its side. It also has Neo-Gothic, Romanesque and Chinese inspired embellishments. In its interior are silver-paneled main altar, three naves, 12 minor altars and brass communion handrails. South of the cathedral is a separate bell tower with a weather rooster on top, which symbolizes Saint Peter. The only remaining Archbishop's Palace in the Philippines built during the Spanish colonization is located in Vigan, beside the cathedral. The church also contains remains of former bishops of the Diocese of Nueva Segovia, as well as the remains of Ilocano poet Leona Florentino (her and her husband Elias de los Reyes' grave marker can be seen on a column near the side door facing Plaza Burgos). ==Notes Bibliography == * * == External links == Category:Roman Catholic churches in Ilocos Sur Category:Marked Historical Structures of the Philippines Category:Spanish Colonial architecture in the Philippines Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in the Philippines Category:Buildings and structures in Vigan ","title":"Vigan Cathedral"},{"id":"46294264","text":"Before This World is the nineteenth studio album by American singer-songwriter James Taylor. It was released on June 15, 2015. After a 45-year wait, James earned his first No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 chart with Before This World. The album, which was released on June 16 through Concord Records, arrived on top the chart of July 4, 2015, more than 45 years after Taylor arrived on the list with Sweet Baby James (on the March 14, 1970 list). The album launched atop the Billboard 200 with 97,000 equivalent album units earned in the week ending June 21, 2015 according to Nielsen Music. Of its start, pure album sales were 96,000 copies sold, Taylor's best debut week for an album since 2002's October Road.[83] It is Taylor's first new studio album of original material since October Road (2002) and first studio album of any kind since Covers in 2008. He recorded the album in a barn on his property in western Massachusetts with Steve Gadd on drums and Jimmy Johnson on bass. In April 2015, he announced a short U.S. tour running from July 2 to August 6 to promote the album, which then continued into 2016 and 2017. ==Background== James Taylor released his most recent original album, October Road, in 2002. Following this, Taylor did not prioritize writing new material for many years. He grew concerned he might never create another original album, and convinced his close family, friends, and manager it would be best to cut off communication from everything. He subsequently lived alone to write the album in a waterfront apartment in Newport, Rhode Island. ==Recording== Recording began with 10 days in January 2014 at The Barn in Massachusetts recording basic tracks. This was followed by some dubbing on the backup vocalists in March 2014 at Ocean Way in Los Angeles. ==Live performance== Before the album's releasing, James Taylor started to perform several new tracks from the upcoming album on his 2014 All Star Band tour. \\"Today Today Today\\", \\"You And I Again\\" and \\"Stretch of the Highway\\" were debuted at the May 30, 2014 show and played throughout the tour; the traditional song \\"Wild Mountain Thyme\\" also earned a regular place in the shows (it had been previously performed by James Taylor occasionally in concert). At Toronto's show on July 24, 2014, James Taylor performed \\"SnowTime\\" specially and explained that the song was written about Toronto. \\"Angels of Fenway\\", \\"Montana\\" and \\"Before This World / Jolly Springtime\\" were all performed during his shows in his spring and summer tour of 2015, to coincide with the album's release. ==Commercial performance== Before This World debuted at number one with 97,000 units moved on the week ending June 21, becoming Taylor's first number-one album on the US Billboard 200 chart. This made Taylor surpass Black Sabbath to become the second-longest waiting artist for a number-one album ‚Äì 47 years since James Taylor (1968) ‚Äî behind a 54-year wait by Tony Bennett. Also, he had scored 11 Top 10 albums before achieving his first No. 1, just behind Neil Diamond. The following week, the album came in at No. 5, selling 50,000 copies in its second week. On the UK Albums Chart, the album started at number 4 with 13,801 copies on sales, became Taylor's fourth top 10 albums.

During withdrawal Kljajiƒá died of an accidental gunshot on a hill on the outskirts of Zvornik. His body was brought to Liplje and buried. Kljajiƒá's body was taken in the 1960s from that spot by his family and reburied in a family plot elsewhere. A memorial was erected on the spot where his corpse was originally buried. Following the ethnic cleansing of Liplje in 1992 during the Bosnian War, the memorial suffered and became overgrown with shrubbery. Bosnian War Liplje concentration camp At the start of the Bosnian War, armed Serb peasants from the nearby village of Snagovo overran Liplje on 1 May 1992 and, by 25 May, turned it into a concentration camp (see: Liplje camp) with the Bosniak (Muslim) residents becoming prisoners. Between 420 and 460 people were imprisoned; men, women and children were beaten, raped repeatedly and killed by Serbs. A total of 27 prisoners lost their lives. Escapees organized resistance groups in the towns of Cerska and Kamenica. On 1 June 1992, about 300 Bosniaks armed with 27 rifles liberated the Liplje concentration camp. It became the only camp with Bosniak prisoners to be liberated in the entirety of the 1992‚Äì95 war. None of the Serb rapists from the camp have been brought to justice. Mass graves In August 1998, a mass grave believed to be of victims killed in 1995, was discovered and exhumed, revealing at least 191 individuals, most of whom died of gunshot. Several mass graves were found in Liplje, with exhumations still ongoing as of 2012. It was reported by Reuters on 8 July 2001 that a mass grave of approximately 200 victims of the 1995 Srebrenica Genocide was discovered in Liplje. Post-war Bosniak returnees experience discrimination from the authorities of the Zvornik municipality, which fell into the hands of Republika Srpska after the war. The elementary school in Liplje, which taught around 400 children before the war, currently has only 20 students. Liplje is one of the stops during the annual Mar≈° mira (March of Peace). Flooding Heavy rainfall in June 2010 set off several landslides and rock slides in Liplje. Due to the blockage of the flow of water, a local creek overflowed and swept away the main access road to the village. The flood also destroyed the crops of the Bosniak returnees.

The attackers claimed to be from the Al-Shabaab terrorist group and indicated that they were retaliating over non-Muslims occupying Muslim territory. The terrorists took several Christian students hostage, but freed most Muslims. The following day, national and county leaders agreed to suspend courses at the college indefinitely, to allow security services to investigate the attack. Buses were also hired to return students to their homes, and several students insisted they would not return to the university. Approximately 650 surviving students of the University College were absorbed into courses at the main Moi University campus at Eldoret. Jacob Kaimenyi, Kenya's Education cabinet secretary, urged students from the teacher training college to return to the Garissa campus which was re-opened on 5 May 2015 with improved security. Many students, however, have refused to return. The governor of Homa Bay County, Cyprian Awiti, decided to award 30,000 Kenyan shillings to each of the 16 surviving students from that county, in order to help students overcome their trauma and to make arrangements to attend school in Eldoret. ==See also== *Garissa Airport ==References *Garissa University College Website *Website of the former Garissa Teachers Training College Category:Universities and colleges in Kenya Category:Garissa Category:Moi University Category:Educational institutions established in 2011 ","title":"Garissa University College"},{"id":"46294497","text":"This is a list of cultural properties in Lingayen, a municipality in the province of Pangasinan on the island of Luzon in the Philippines. } ==References== Lingayen Category:Buildings and structures in Pangasinan ","title":"List of Cultural Properties of the Philippines in Lingayen, Pangasinan"},{"id":"46294521","text":"Colegio Japon√©s Auxiliar de Quito („Ç≠„ÉàË£úÁøíÊéàÊ•≠Ê†° Kito Hosh≈´ Jugy≈ç K≈ç) is a supplementary Japanese school located in the Pusuqu√≠ area of Quito, Ecuador.\\"‰∏≠ÂçóÁ±≥„ÅÆË£úÁøíÊéàÊ•≠Ê†°‰∏ÄË¶ßÔºàÂπ≥Êàê25Âπ¥4Êúà15Êó•ÁèæÂú®Ôºâ\\" ().

After the introduction of the State-Owned Enterprises Bill into the House of Representatives on 30 September 1986, an interim report of the Waitangi Tribunal had been given to the Minister of MƒÅori Affairs. The Tribunal report feared that land transferred to SOEs such as the Forestry Corporation or Land Corporation would then be out of the power of the Crown to return to iwi in accordance with Tribunal recommendations because the SOE would have sold the land to a private buyer or be unwilling to sell the land back to the Crown. These land transfers would equate to a large proportion of New Zealand's land surface area.New Zealand Maori Council v Attorney-General [1987] 1 NZLR 641 at 653. Included in the State-Owned Enterprises Act were two key sections, section 9 and section 27. Section 9 read, \\"9. Treaty of Waitangi ‚Äî Nothing in this Act shall permit the Crown to act in a manner that is inconsistent with the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.\\"New Zealand Maori Council v Attorney-General [1987] 1 NZLR 641 at 656. Section 27 concerned land transferred under the Act which was subject to a Waitangi Tribunal claim prior to the Governor-General's assent of the Act, 18 December 1986.New Zealand Maori Council v Attorney-General [1987] 1 NZLR 641 at 657. The main concern for the New Zealand MƒÅori Council was that only where claims had been lodged before 18 December 1987 could the alienation of MƒÅori lands be halted. The MƒÅori Council filed for a judicial review in March 1987 alleging in their statement of claim, \\"Unless restrained by this Honourable Court it is likely that the Crown will take action consequential on the exercise of statutory powers pursuant to the Act by way of the transfer of the assets the subject of existing and likely future claims before the Waitangi Tribunal in breach of the provisions of section 9 of the Act\\". ==Judgments== The MƒÅori Council succeeded in their appeal. The Court issued, In addition the Court directed the Crown and the Maori Council to collaborate on a, In their judgments the Court recognised a number of principles of the Treaty of Waitangi, including, * Kawanatanga and tino rangatiratanga ‚Äì the right of the Crown to govern and the right of MƒÅori to continue to exercise self-determination,New Zealand Maori Council v Attorney-General [1987] 1 NZLR 641 at 663. * On-going partnership with obligations to act reasonably and in good faith,New Zealand Maori Council v Attorney-General [1987] 1 NZLR 641 at 702. * Duty to remedy past breaches, * Active protection.New Zealand Maori Council v Attorney- General [1987] 1 NZLR 641 at 703. The Court also noted that the use of the phrase \\"Treaty principles\\" rather than terms of the Treaty, \\"calls for an assessment of the relationship the parties hoped to create by and reflect in that document, and an inquiry into the benefits and obligations involved in applying its language in today's changed conditions and expectation in the light of that relationship.\\" ==Significance== In December 1987 the Minister of Justice Geoffrey Palmer introduced the Treaty of Waitangi (State Enterprises) Bill into the House of Representatives to give effect to the scheme agreed between Crown and MƒÅori Council as a result of the judgment. In December 1987, Cooke P delivered a Minute of the Court, In New Zealand MƒÅori Council v Attorney-General [2013] NZSC 6, the Supreme Court, \\"gave weight to the SOE case jurisprudence that vests the section 9 Treaty principles section as a paramount provision that contains a broad constitutional principle. The SOE case is ‚Äúof great authority and importance to the law concerning the relationship between the Crown and Maori‚Äù (at [52]).\\" Shortly after the decision, Eddie Durie, Chief Judge of the Maori Land Court said, \\"Until the Court of Appeal decision two years ago which halted the transfer of assets to state-owned enterprises, Maori people had not won a case since 1847. You had a sort of judicial scoreboard - Settlers: 60, Maori: 1.\\" Glazebrook J has described the case thus, ==References== Category:1987 in New Zealand law Category:Court of Appeal of New Zealand cases Category:1987 in case law Category:Treaty of Waitangi ","title":"New Zealand Maori Council v Attorney-General"},{"id":"46294546","text":"Klaus Wiegand (born 16 August 1941) was a Major general in the East German People's Army.

His father worked in a shoe factory. Following his school final exams he started an apprenticeship as a machinist. By this time his home region had become the German Democratic Republic, formally founded in October 1949 from what had previously been the Soviet occupation zone established following May 1945, which had marked Germany's defeat in the war. Wiegand cut short his apprenticeship and on 8 April 1959 joined the young country's recently established army. He joined a tank regiment and received basic training as a gunner before being transferred to the Land Forces Officer Academy where he studied from 1959 till 1961. After this, till 1966, he commanded a unit in the Fourth Tank Regiment. Meanwhile in 1962 he joined East Germany's ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands). Between 1966 and 1971 he served as a Staff Officer for information with the Fourth Motorised Protection Division based in Erfurt.

In 2012, the company launched in Singapore with fibre broadband Internet plans offering speeds of up to 150 Mbit/s, as well as the country‚Äôs first no-contract term Internet plans. In February 2012, MyRepublic rolled out its GAMER fibre broadband packages, becoming the first Internet service provider in Singapore to offer fibre broadband plans specifically catered towards gamers. MyRepublic is most well-known for its GAMER fibre broadband package, which features lower latency to popular games. In May 2015, MyRepublic launched the first ever 1Gbps no-contract fibre broadband plan in Singapore, targeted at users who want greater flexibility and are unwilling to commit to a 12- or 24-month contract.  Enterprise Connectivity  The company also offers fibre broadband, voice and managed Wi-Fi services to business customers in the country. In 2016, it launched MySDN, its first enterprise connectivity service, available to customers across the region, including Singapore, Indonesia, and New Zealand.  Bid to be Singapore‚Äôs Fourth Telco  In 2014, MyRepublic announced its interest to be Singapore‚Äôs 4th telco, after Singtel, StarHub and M1, promising to introduce unlimited mobile data plans as a telco. In April 2015, MyRepublic announced plans to hold a mobility trial in Jurong Lake District in the second half of 2015, as part of the Government's trial of HetNet, or heterogeneous network. HetNet is a new wireless system that leveraged NBN as part of a mobile network, allowing mobile phone users to automatically hop across networks to minimise surfing slowdowns or disruptions. As part of the trial, MyRepublic gave out 1,000 free SIM cards with unlimited 4G data to trial participants in the coverage area. In September 2015, the company submitted its bid for the New Entrant Spectrum Auction (NESA) along with two other companies - Australian telco TPG Telecom and Singapore start-up airYotta. Of the three, only MyRepublic and TPG were pre-qualified to participate in the NESA. MyRepublic participated in the NESA in December 2016, but ultimately exited the auction at S$102.5 million and ceded the license to TPG, citing concerns that bidding higher would not make sense for its business case. In May 2017, reports emerged that MyRepublic was looking for private equity backing to bid for Singaporean telecommunications company M1, which would allow it to get back into the Singapore Telco market despite losing the 4th telco license. In a press conference later that year, MyRepublic confirmed the report but added that it was no longer interested in buying M1 and that it would seek to offer mobile services as a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) instead.  Mobile Services Offering  In May 2018, MyRepublic announced that it had formed an Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) agreement with local telco StarHub, enabling it to offer mobile services using StarHub‚Äôs mobile infrastructure. In June 2018, MyRepublic rolled out three new mobile price plans, starting from S$35/month. Offering a \\"boundless\\" data offering, the plans allowed customers to continue to consume data at reduced speeds once they hit the data limit of their plans without additional charges. In October 2020, MyRepublic and M1 Limited (M1) signed an agreement for MyRepublic to deliver an enhanced suite of mobile services as a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) using M1‚Äôs mobile network infrastructure.  Australia   Launch and rollout of NBN plans  MyRepublic entered the Australian market in November 2016 with a primary goal to become the People‚Äôs Champions when it comes to speed and lobbying for access to high speed internet at affordable prices. MyRepublic launched with one plan - Unlimited NBN with up to 100Mbps download and up to 40Mbps upload speeds for A$59.99 per month. In the same year, MyRepublic launched the first nbn‚Ñ¢ plan for Gamers \\\\- Unlimited NBN optimised for gaming with up to 100Mbps download and up to 40Mbps upload speeds for A$69.99 per month.  Gigatown Competition  In 2017, MyRepublic launched the ‚ÄúGigatown‚Äù Competition to connect Australia‚Äôs first town to consumer grade 1Gbps gigabit service. MyRepublic wanted to demonstrate the benefits of ultra- fast next generation fibre and the benefits it could deliver to consumers and small businesses. MyRepublic ran the Gigatown petition and gathered over 6,000 responses from individuals who expressed their feelings towards how they felt about their current internet speeds.[7] MyRepublic began offering their 1Gbit/s speed tier packages to Wollongong at A$129/month with unlimited data as part of their Gigatown Competition. At the end of 2017, MyRepublic expanded and launched NBN Small Business products to market.  Indonesia  In July 2015, MyRepublic launched in Indonesia, marking MyRepublic‚Äôs second overseas expansion after New Zealand. MyRepublic began offering broadband services in nine areas in Indonesia.  New Zealand   Entry to New Zealand‚Äôs ISP market  MyRepublic entered New Zealand‚Äôs ISP market in October 2014, offering fibre broadband services to homes and businesses on the country‚Äôs Ultrafast Fibre Broadband (UFB) initiative. It was the country‚Äôs first Internet Service Provider (ISP) to launch 100/20Mbps unlimited-only broadband plans. == Products and Services ==  Consumer broadband services  MyRepublic offers several fibre broadband products and services for residential consumers across the Asia-Pacific region, including: * Fibre broadband services in Singapore, New Zealand, Indonesia and Australia. * GAMER broadband services in Singapore, New Zealand, Indonesia and Australia, which offers lower latency Internet connections for popular games. * VDSL in New Zealand.  Gaming   GAMER Arena  In November 2018, MyRepublic launched the MyRepublic GAMER Arena, an esports initiative for aspiring esports gamers aiming to support and encourage the next generation of professional gamers in Singapore, at GameStart Asia, Southeast Asia‚Äôs premier game convention. The first season of GAMER Arena kicked off in January 2019. MyRepublic GAMER Arena is a ‚Äúrookie league‚Äù that provides competitive gamers with accessible, free-to-participate, regularly-scheduled tournaments to hone their skills and win prizes. MyRepublic GAMER Arena also provides participants the opportunity to meet with other like-minded gamers as well as showcase their skills to teams or brands who might be recruiting. In December 2019, MyRepublic announced the expansion of the scale of GAMER Arena into the first ever regional tournament series in partnership with PlayStation, which kickstarted in 2020 across Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. GAMER Arena has received sponsorship support from various partners such as ASUS Republic of Gamers (ROG), PlayStation, Secretlab, Sony Electronics Singapore, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, and Armageddon.  Achievement Unlocked  In May 2020, MyRepublic announced the launch of a new gamer engagement programme, Achievement Unlocked, which will see gamers being rewarded for unlocking various weekly or season in-game achievements. The first-of-its-kind engagement programme brings together passionate gamers in Singapore, spotlighting their achievements, skillset and dedication to their gameplay.  Mobile services  MyRepublic launched mobile services as an MVNO in Singapore in 2018 by utilising StarHub‚Äôs mobile network infrastructure. It also intends to launch as an MVNO in its other markets, though it has not announced any partnerships or tie-ups in other countries.

Moskowitz describes the bliss point as \\"that sensory profile where you like food the most.\\" The bliss point for salt, sugar, or fat is a range within which perception is that there is neither too much nor too little, but the \\"just right\\" amount of saltiness, sweetness, or richness. The human body has evolved to favor foods delivering these tastes: the brain responds with a \\"reward\\" in the form of a jolt of endorphins, remembers what we did to get that reward, and makes us want to do it again, an effect run by dopamine, a neurotransmitter. Combinations of sugar, fat, and salt act synergistically, and are more rewarding than any one alone. In food product optimization, the goal is to include two or three of these nutrients at their bliss point.

One is an old accomplice called Serge, fatally shot, while the other is a young psychotic called Mickey. When Serge dies, No√´l buries him. Mickey goes into Paris and on his return finds two police detectives, Bonnardot and Sarlat, at No√´l's house. After threatening them, he escapes and holes up with Dany, a friend in Paris. Thinking that No√´l had betrayed him to the police, he turns up one evening as a dinner party is in progress and terrorises everybody. Realising that Mickey must be stopped, No√´l sends Nicole to a hotel for safety and calls on two old accomplices to help him find the madman. But, learning that a prize mare is sick, Nicole breaks cover and slips back home one night. Mickey is waiting there and takes her captive. However, the police have been trailing her and Sarlat challenges Mickey. In an exchange of fire, Sarlat kills Nicole while Mickey gets away. Eventually, No√´l and his friends locate Mickey's hide and it is No√´l on watch one morning when Mickey and Dany sortie out to rob the local bank. The bank guard shoots Mickey and, picking up the wounded man, No√´l takes him to a safe house to die. However, the police have located the safe house and, in an exchange of fire, Sarlat kills Mickey. Then, considering No√´l equally culpable, he empties the rest of his magazine without managing to hit him. After the last shot, No√´l takes him captive and drives away. On a lonely road, he empties the rest of his magazine at Sarlat, deliberately not hitting him, and leaves him there in shock. In a postscript, we see No√´l adopt the little daughter of Mickey, whose mother had committed suicide. ==Cast== * Yves Montand as Noel Durieux * G√©rard Depardieu as Mickey * Catherine Deneuve as Nicole Durieux * Michel Galabru as Bonnardot * Jean- Claude Dauphin as Ricky * G√©rard Lanvin as Sarlat * Christian Marquand as Jean * √âtienne Chicot as Roland Davout * Richard Anconina as Dany ==External links== * * Category:French films Category:1981 films Category:1980s crime films Category:French crime films Category:Films scored by Philippe Sarde ","title":"Choice of Arms"},{"id":"46294710","text":"Blake Brockington (May 14, 1996 ‚Äì March 23, 2015) was an American trans man whose suicide attracted international attention. He had previously received attention as the first openly transgender high school homecoming king in North Carolina, and had since been advocating for LGBT youth, the transgender community, and against police brutality. == Life == Brockington was born on May 14, 1996 in Charleston, South Carolina. He moved from Charleston to Charlotte, North Carolina, when he was 12. Brockington was assigned female at birth and identified as such until he came out publicly as transgender while attending East Mecklenburg High School as a tenth grade student. His family was not supportive of his decision to transition, wondering why a black youth would want to draw more attention to himself. Because of this, Brockington chose to live with a foster family during his transition. He chose the name Blake after it came to him in a dream and because he liked how masculine it sounded. He was taking testosterone, which was covered by Medicaid, and had planned to get a mastectomy once he was able to afford it. He spent two years as a drum major for East Mecklenburg High School's band. In 2014, Brockington received national attention for being the first openly transgender high school homecoming king in North Carolina after collecting the most money for East Mecklenburg High School's chosen charity, Mothering Across Continents. He later indicated the process had been tough on him, saying, \\"That was single- handedly the hardest part of my trans journey. Really hateful things were said on the Internet. It was hard. I saw how narrow-minded the world really is.\\" After his election as homecoming king, he began publicly advocating for transgender and LGBT youth issues. He spoke at the 2014 Transgender Day of Remembrance service in Charlotte. In December 2014 at Charlotte's Independence Square, he organized a protest against police brutality against black people. He was involved with setting up an exhibit, \\"Publicly Identified: Coming Out Activist in the Queen City\\" , at the Levine Museum of the New South in July 2014. Brockington was also mentoring transgender youth. He spoke in an 8-minute documentary made in 2014 by three Elon University students, \\"BrocKINGton\\", about his experience being bullied because he was transgender, and being hospitalized for self-harming. He was active in the faith community, and participated in the Trans Faith and Action Network Conference held in Charlotte in August 2014. Brockington was enrolled at University of North Carolina at Charlotte, majoring in music education. At the time of his death, he was on medical leave and not attending classes. He stated that his plans were to become a band director and composer. == Death == Prior to his death, Brockington had indicated that he had experienced years of depression and destructive behavior, such as self-harming. He also indicated that he had previously had suicidal thoughts. Two months prior to his death, he posted on his Tumblr page \\"Even if I got better in my head, I would never want to continue on in a world like this.\\" A month prior, he posted \\"I‚Äôm waiting on the moment when me and my darkness split from my body.\\" One week before his death, he posted \\"being in my head is like being a quarterback playing against an entire defensive line.\\" Finally, on the day of his death, he posted \\"I am so exhausted.\\" Brockington died on March 23, 2015 after being struck by several vehicles on the outer loop of Interstate 485 near Pavilion Boulevard in Charlotte. The incident was considered a suicide and was similar in nature to the suicides of Ash Haffner and Leelah Alcorn. Brockington was laid to rest in Ravenel, South Carolina by his family on March 28, 2015. == Reaction == In his obituary, Brockington's family, still unaccepting of his identity as a transgender male, used she/her pronouns and referred to him by his birth name. Shortly before his death, he had told the media that he was not in contact with a lot of his family. On March 24, 2015, the day after Brockington's death, about 100 people came to the North Davidson Street headquarters of Time Out Youth, where Brockington had been a client, to share stories and comfort each other. Southerners On New Ground held a memorial service for Brockington in Durham, North Carolina on March 28, 2015. Three dozen members of the Charlotte community attended a memorial service for Brockington held on March 29, 2015 at Sacred Souls Community Church. Rodney McKenzie, the National LGBTQ Task Force's director of faith work, travelled from New York City to attend the service and remarked, \\"This is a loss for you all and a loss for our movement and our world. ... All of us were incredibly touched and incredibly sad. ... This is something touching all us, everywhere.\\" Campus Pride's executive director, Shane Windmeyer, remarked at the service, \\"Days like today, the weeks recently, it hurts more and more. ... It is a tragic reminder of our duty as individuals to do more, to try better in changing lives and saving lives.\\" Brockington's partner, Flo Ethier, read what was Brockington's favorite biblical passage, 1 Corinthians 13. Many have noted that what happened to Brockington fits a dangerous pattern of harmful behavior by transgender youth ‚Äì who often face disproportionate amounts of bullying, harassment, discrimination, and violence. Josh Burford, assistant director for sexual and gender diversity at UNC Charlotte, who had worked with Brockington on the exhibit at the Levine Museum, told the press \\"What happened to Blake is part of a systemic problem, especially for trans students of color. He didn‚Äôt quit. He didn‚Äôt give up. ... He‚Äôs a victim of what happens every single day to these kids.\\" Other memorial services were held in cities such as Minneapolis, Washington, D.C., and an additional service in Charlotte. In 2018 the LGBTQ community archive project was officially named the \\"King-Henry-Brockington Community archive\\" to carry on the legacy of Blake's impact on the local Charlotte Community. Josh Burford, who had worked with Blake, decided to include Blake's name as a permanent reminder of the work of this young activist. == See also == * Suicide among LGBT youth * List of LGBT-related suicides * List of transgender people == References == Category:1996 births Category:2015 deaths Category:2015 in LGBT history Category:2015 in North Carolina Category:Deaths by person in the United States Category:Male suicides Category:Suicides in North Carolina Category:March 2015 events in the United States Category:LGBT-related suicides ","title":"Suicide of Blake Brockington"},{"id":"46294711","text":"Kevin Luarca (born December10, 1993) is a Venezuela soccer player. ==Career== Luarca played with the Montreal Impact Academy in the Canadian Soccer League from 2011 to 2013.

Originally a visita of Dingras, it was raised into an independent parish in 1770. In September 2014, the 200-year-old church of Saint Anne Parish in Piddig, Ilocos Norte was closed for public worship after it was deemed unsafe. ==History== Piddig was originally a visita or mission station of Dingras in 1598. It became an independent parish under the patronage of Saint Anne, Mother of the Blessed Virgin Mary in 1770. Father Isidro Campaner became its first parish priest. The church of Piddig was built also on that same year. During the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, the church was occupied by five-man team of Filipino guerrillas who repulsed early American attacks. It was also razed during the Japanese Occupation. On March 19, 1932, the tower was crippled by an earthquake. The damage was repaired by Monsignor Arsenio Pacis in the same year. The 21st Infantry of the American forces later occupied the church complex during World War II. Piddig became the military capital of Ilocos Norte. All church records, the convent, sacristy, furniture went up to flames when the Japanese Imperial Forces raided and burned the town. In 1965, restoration work was done in the facade and the interior of the church. The convent now houses the parochial school, Saint Anne Academy, during the term of Father Manuel Aspiras. Closure The church was closed for public worship after it was deemed ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù after liturgical rite presided over by Laoag Bishop Renato P. Mayugba on September 14, 2014. According to Father Ericson Josue, the Commission Head of the Church Heritage of the diocese, the foundation of the church has been discovered to be weak to carry the massive walls of the edifice. The local government of Piddig is planning to sought the church to be declared a heritage structure after the National Commission for Culture and the Arts and National Historical Commission of the Philippines. The church was reopened in 2019 after 5 years of renovation. ==Features== The church of Piddig is located on top of a hill with a big central stairway, and stone and brick fence. The facade is inspired by the Jesuit Church of Il Gesu in Rome built in 1568. It has huge buttresses that serves as columns and volutes on the pediment. It still has the original wooden pulpit and a central retablo with the image of the patron saint, Saint Anne holding Mary on her lap. Its bell tower is now largely in ruins.

A sketched portrait from the Zingari newspaper William Arthur Hume (June 1837 - 2 Mar 1916) was a prominent politician of the Cape Colony and the Member for Port Elizabeth in the Cape Parliament. ==Early life== Born in Grahamstown in 1837, Hume became a citrus farmer in the Sundays river valley and moved to Port Elizabeth, where he settled. He married Louisa Mary Carlisle in 1871. ==Politics (1874-75)== A merchant who was successful in business, he entered politics and was elected as the MLA for Port Elizabeth from 1874 until only the next year. Separatism Hume was a member of the \\"Eastern Cape Separatist League\\", that strove for a separate Colony for the white settlers of the Eastern Cape. This movement later split between those who supported Grahamstown as a future political centre, and those who supported Port Elizabeth. Both factions were defeated by a strong liberal coalition based in Cape Town in the western half of the Cape Colony, which strongly opposed any racial or regional divisions. Confederation When Lord Carnarvon of the London Colonial Office attempted to strengthen imperial control over southern Africa, by drawing all of the region's states into a British \\"Confederation\\", the remnants of the separatist league saw in this policy a means of reviving the movement for a separate British Eastern Colony. Hume was unique, among these leaders, in that he rejected the Confederation plan, foreseeing that it would lead to war and instability. He was also notable for remaining unmoved by the speeches and arguments of the imperial agent James Anthony Froude, unlike the majority of his colleagues. In addition, he joined the majority of the Cape's elected representatives in defending the Cape's democratic independence, under the current system of \\"responsible government\\", and rejecting outside interference from London. The end result was that he sided with the locally elected Cape government, in opposing the imperial moves to enforce confederation, and was widely reviled by separatist leaders like Jock Paterson as having betrayed his political allies.Political papers on South African topics. Port Elizabeth. 1877. pp.1-28 ==Later life and family== He was the first president of the Port Elizabeth Club, Chair of the city's Chamber of Commerce, and Chair of the Harbour Board.

Of the part used for growing crops, the actual area of cultivated land is only about 50%. According to the World Bank statistics, as of 2012, the agricultural area was which was 31% of the total land area of the country. The land used for arable cropping was , just 1.6% of the country. The Niari Valley in the south is a notable agricultural area. ==Crops== Agriculture is mainly in the peri-urban and remote areas of Congo where the main crops grown are manioc (Cassava), plantains, bananas, peanuts, palm oil, fruits, vegetables, yams, beans, peas and maize. Rice is cultivated in the Niari Valley and in the Djambala District. Exports are limited to sugar, forest based products, coffee, tobacco and rubber, with sugar and timber being profitable items of export. Despite 30% of the population being involved in agriculture, productivity is low, and agriculture accounts for under 10% of GDP. In 2010, the country imported about $300 million of food including wheat, rice, poultry meat, palm oil and milk products. ==Livestock== Livestock husbandry has traditionally been performed on a limited scale in the country, with cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and poultry being reared. In an effort to increase the availability of meat in rural areas, the government instituted a lend-lease system. Farmers would be lent animals by the state with the requirement to pay back the same number of animals at a later date. By 1980, around 22,000 animals were on loan and by 1990, the number of cattle and poultry in the country had quadrupled in the thirty years since independence, though the number of sheep and goats had risen by a more modest amount. In 2000, annual production of meat was 27,000 metric tonnes, but this was still far less than the country's needs. ==Development== The timber industry of the country was exploited by the French from the 1940s. Before independence some 80% of the population were involved in agriculture. In the late 1960s forest products were responsible for over 60 percent of total exports from the country, but by the 1980s petroleum accounted for 90 percent of exports. The country is a leading nation in the production of limba and okoum√© woods. Tuna, bass, sole, and sardines are caught off Pointe-Noire for commercial purposes, although the fishing industry is relatively small. Soci√©t√© du Sucre du Niari (SOSUNIARI; Sugar Society of Niarai) developed cane plantations and in 1964, it established a sugar refinery. Soci√©t√© Industrielle et Agricole du Congo (SIACONGO; Industrial and Agricultural Society of Congo) was founded in 1970, about the same time that the government nationalized La soci√©t√© industrielle et agricole du Niari (SIAN). In 1978, Sucrerie du Congo took over management of the sugar sector. Societ√© Industrielle et Agricole du Tabac (SIAT; Industrial and Agricultural Tobacco Company) was established in 1942, privatized in the 1990s, and was acquired by Imperial Tobacco in 2001. Agriculture accounted for less than 10% of GDP during the 1990s and 2000s, which further declined to 5% in 2008, even though 30% of the work force is engaged in farming and allied fields. A drawback in agriculture operations is that young men often prefer to move to urban areas to obtain work, leaving the task of farming to women and old people. This is one reason for the stagnation in agricultural growth in the country. In recent years, to boost agricultural production the Government of Congo has invited farmers from South Africa to carry out commercial farming in the country on a lease basis. Congo Agriculture, an affiliate of South African farmers union \\"Agri SA\\" have ventured into this operation and have established many farms, associating with the local farmers. Initial operation was started in 2011 on a farm of around 80,000 hectares. Although 2000 farmers showed an interest, only 30 farmers participated in the scheme, and as of 2012 less than 20 were reportedly active. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * Category:Economy of the Republic of the Congo ","title":"Agriculture in the Republic of the Congo"},{"id":"46295049","text":"Alice Carter may refer to: ==People== * Alice Carter Cook (n√©e Carter), (1865‚Äì1945), American botanist * Alice Leslie Carter, American classic female blues singer of the 1920s * Alice Carter (actress), cast in Exile (1990 film) and other films == Fictional characters == * Alice Carter, a character from the Torchwood television series * Alice Carter, n√©e Aldridge, character in UK radio soap The Archers ","title":"Alice Carter"},{"id":"46295054","text":"StartupBus is an annual technological startup competition and entrepreneurship boot camp, described as a Hackathon, created by Elias Bizannes in February 2010. The competition is held across a 3-day bus ride where contestants or \\"buspreneurs\\" compete to conceive the best technology startup. The competition seeks to attract young top talents to compete, to search for the most innovative startup conceived by the groups, where the winners are determined by a panel of judges. Starting from February 2011, it has gone through many iterations in various continents from 2011 to the present day, with the first in Austin, Texas and subsequently in North America, Europe and Africa. StartupBus receives an extensive online media coverage through platforms such as BBC News, CNN and technology blogs and news sites such as The Next Web, VentureBeat, WIRED and TechCrunch. Live coverage of the competition was also broadcast through StartupBus.TV via Livestream. StartupBus held its 9th annual North American competition in New Orleans, Louisiana on April 27, 2018. ==History== Inside of the StartupBus StartupBus started off as a joke by Elias Bizannes and Bart Jellema on 1 July 2009 to start a hackathon on bus trip from San Francisco to Austin for the SXSW Conference. Eventually, the first bus launched on 1 February 2010, which consisted of 25 strangers on the way to Austin for the SXSW Conference. During which a total of 6 startups were conceived from the time in the bus. Soon after, starting from February 2011, StartupBus was officially an annual technological startup competition. ==Concept== Prior to competition StartupBus' start off location is determined through voting via Facebook and Twitter since 2012, after its evident success. Buspreneurs are selected based on an invite-only basis after indicating their interest through submission of an application and proposal with an interview there after, if shortlisted. Application are only open to those who specializes in the field of coding, designing and business. Pre- events are organised before the competition to bond buspreneurs with the objective to create a network of like-minded people. Competition Format The competition starts off with a 72-hour bus ride from the determined start- off location to its destination, voted through Facebook and Twitter. Each bus consists of 24 buspreneurs, which comes equipped with Wi-fi, charging points and tables among the seats with no other luxuries. Through the 72-hour bus ride, buspreneurs are to form teams of 3-4 members of their choosing and work on their final product which comes in the form of viable web applications to be presented to a panel of judges for submission on the end of the competition day. Winners will get funding to kick-start their idea with prior winners of StartupBus being able to expand their creations and creating new ones. Power on board the StartupBus is however short in supply and with Wi-fi that is unstable at times, making the competition even tougher for the buspreneurs. On-board are experienced mentors from prior StartupBus competitions, available to help the teams out. Pit stops are made where buspreneurs gather feedback on their products, learn about business environments and to rest for the night. Sponsors Activities on board the StartupBus competition and application fee upon acceptance are subjected to the amount of funding they receive each year. As much as possible, StartupBus tries to minimise application fees to allow college students to have the ability to participate in the competition. If sponsorship is low, busprenuers may also have to pay for their own night lodging. ==Bus Routes== StartupBus competitions cover 4 continents - North America, Europe, Africa and Australasia - and 26 countries. 15 major events had been held since its debut in 2010.

The Homeric cities of Pylos, Kyparisieis and Dorion enjoyed great growth and prosperity. Triphylia and its residents had the benefit of independence and self-government until the second Messenian war, in 628 BC, when they fell into the authority of the Spartans, who later handed Triphylia over to the Eleans. Triphylians remained enslaved under the sovereignty of Eleans throughout the Peloponnesian war, excluding a short period during which they managed to recover their autonomy.

At the peak of his career, he was 73rd among the richest in China. Guo was accused of corruption and other misdeeds by Chinese authorities and fled to the United States in late 2014, after learning he was going to be arrested under allegations including bribing, kidnapping, money laundering, fraud and rape. Guo is a colleague of Steve Bannon and a member of U.S. President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Despite Guo's claims of being a whistle- blower, his statements were unable to be verified by newspapers such as The New York Times. ==Biography== Guo was born in Shen County, Shandong, China. He is the seventh of eight children in the family. He began his business career in Zhengzhou, before moving to Beijing to secure various construction deals during the 2008 Beijing Olympics. His most famous asset was the Pangu Plaza, an Olympic torch-shaped condominium residence built prior to the Beijing games. Guo, long prominent in real estate development and investment circles, came to fame in 2015 after a lengthy investigative report by Caixin media, controlled by Hu Shuli, was released, detailing Guo's political connections, business dealings, and hardball tactics against former rivals. Guo responded by claiming Hu defamed him and responded with a set of personal accusations against Hu, claiming Hu had a romantic entanglement with his business rival. Guo was believed to have left China sometime in 2015; he is believed to have been shuttling between Europe and the United States. He opened a Twitter account in early 2017, frequently criticizing individuals within the Chinese establishment. He has reserved particular scorn for (not to be confused with former Paramount Leader Hu Jintao), the son of former Central Commission for Discipline Inspection secretary He Guoqiang. Many officials with whom he was said to have ties have fallen under the dragnet of the anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping, including Ma Jian, the former deputy director of Chinese National Security Bureau, and Zhang Yue, the former Political and Legal Affairs Secretary of Hebei. While generally supportive of General Secretary Xi Jinping, Guo has characterized parts of the corruption campaign as a political witch hunt. From the beginning of 2017, Guo is in self-imposed exile in New York City, where he owns an US$82 million apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, overlooking Central Park. He has continued to conduct a political agenda to bring attention to alleged corruption in the Chinese political system from his New York home. In November 2018, Guo put the apartment up for sale for US$67 million. Guo is a member of U.S. President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and Mark's Club in Mayfair, London. Since 23 January 2017, Guo accepted multiple interviews with media such as Mingjing, Voice of America (VOA) and BBC. Guo also started a campaign of exposing corruptions of some of the highest officials of China on his YouTube and Twitter channel through live monologues. On 20 April, Guo's supposedly 3-hour live interview with VOA was abruptly terminated by VOA during the interview. Newspapers such as The New York Times, Financial Times, and Forbes also reported about Guo and his campaign. In June 2017, one of Guo's targets of being \\"exposed\\", HNA Group, sued Guo for defamation. In August 2018, several Hong Kong media, such as Ming Pao and South China Morning Post reported that Hong Kong Police had frozen the assets of the Guo family, accused of money laundering under the name of Guo's daughter Guo Mei. In March 2019, his mother died in China. On 3 June 2020, Guo and Steve Bannon participated in declaring a \\"New Federal State of China\\" that \\"would overthrow the Chinese government\\". In New York City, planes were seen carrying banners which said \\"Congratulations to Federal State of New China!\\". In August 2020, Bannon was arrested by federal authorities during an early morning raid on Guo's $35 million luxury yacht, docked in Connecticut, under charges of stealing millions of dollars from the We Build The Wall non-profit organization. ==Beijing Zenith Holdings== Beijing Zenith Holdings () was a company owned in 2013 by Li Lin and Jiang Yuehua via two corporate entities ( and ). The company acquired a minority stake in PKU Healthcare from state- owned Founder Group's PKU Healthcare Group. However, Beijing Zenith Holdings allegedly failed to pay PKU Healthcare Group after the shares were already transferred. To finalize the payment, Beijing Zenith Holdings allegedly borrowed the money from PKU Resources Group Holdings, a sister company of PKU Healthcare Group. All three companies were fined by the China Securities Regulatory Commission in 2016. In 2015, Chinese media reported that Zenith Holdings was actually owned by Guo Wengui, and Li Lin and Jiang Yuehua were his proxies. Zenith Holdings also acquired a minority stake in Founder Securities by underwriting the new shares. In October 2018, Zenith Holdings was fined CNY 60 billion for irregularity in acquiring the securities company. In its ruling, the court in Dalian found that Beijing Zenith had made RMB 11.9 billion in illegal profits. ==Credibility of documents== On 5 October 2017, Guo made public in Washington a so-called \\"confidential document of the Chinese government\\" with the self-proclaimed verification of the U.S. government, featuring China's \\"working plan of secretly dispatching 27 police officers\\" to the United States on field duty in 2017. On 2 January 2018, The Washington Free Beacon published another such document, featuring China's \\"decision on conducting communication and coordination work\\" between China and the North Korea to further a solution to the nuclear issue. Both documents received media attention, with even the U.S. Department of State claiming their own close attention. On 23 April 2018, The Chongqing Municipal Public Security Bureau held a press conference on the forgery of national-level documents by Guo. They reported that Guo had incited and instigated twin brothers Chen Zhiyu and Chen Zhiheng to forge over 30 national-level official documents as the main content of his so-called \\"revelation\\" online, which were documents faked to be issued by the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and its relevant ministries and commissions. The proceedings state that in May 2017, Guo Wengui publicly offered rewards for so-called \\"confidential documents\\" of the Chinese Government, which was deemed a profitable opportunity by Chen Zhiyu and Chen Zhiheng. The former reached out to Guo under the pseudonym \\"Zhou Guoming\\". Guo started working with Chen Zhiyu in August, 2017. They agreed that a 4,000 US dollars monthly salary would be paid to hire Chen Zhiyu, who would work full-time to provide needed materials for Guo's \\"revelation.\\" Guo also promised to cover Chen's travel expenses and fees to purchase mobile phones, and contribute 50 million dollars to set up a fund at Chen's disposal. At the invitation by Guo Wengui, Chen Zhiyu met with Guo and his assistants in the U.S. four times. Chongqing police found that since August 2017, Guo has been in league with the Chen brothers, instigating them to forge more than 30 official documents in the name of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and related ministries and commissions, before spreading the documents overseas. Guo and the Chen brothers have also fabricated information claiming that a number of central and provincial government officials had illegitimate children, houses, mistresses and large bank deposits abroad, according to the investigation. On 18 February 2018, Chongqing police arrested Chen Zhiyu and Chen Zhiheng in the provinces of Guangdong and Hunan respectively, and confiscated related items. Both suspects confessed their crimes of forging official documents to the police. Police also discovered a large number of allegedly forged official documents of state organs in the suspects' computers and hard drives, involving areas such as China's national defense, diplomacy and financial policies. They also found allegedly fabricated files of the CPC's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. ==Criminal charges== In April 2017, an Interpol notice was issued for Guo's arrest, requested by the Chinese government. In June 2017, staff of one of Guo's other investment vehicles, Pangu Investment, were charged for scamming banks on loans. The staff members accused all alleged that they were under the orders of Guo. ==Civil lawsuits== Several companies sued Guo's Pangu Investment and Zenith Holdings in the civil court of the United States, in order to reclaim the non-performing loan the companies allegedly lent to Guo. In April 2017, Pacific Alliance Asia Opportunity Fund brought suit against Guo in the Commercial Division of New York County, where Guo resided and was seeking asylum from the United States government. In 2008, Pacific Alliance loaned $30 million to Guo's Hong Kong company in connection with the development of Pangu Plaza, site of a \\"7 Star Hotel\\" in Beijing near the Olympic arenas. In connection with the loan, Guo signed a personal guarantee. All of the documents and transactions were executed in Hong Kong or China. According to Pacific Alliance, Guo owes approximately $88 million in principal and accrued interest on the loan. In August 2017, the Chinese conglomerate HNA Group filed a defamation lawsuit in New York against Guo, said Guo made \\"repeatedly false and defamatory statements\\", including a claim that Yao Qing, a nephew of Secretary Wang Qishan, the Communist Party's top anti-corruption official and close supporter of Party general secretary Xi Jinping, is one of HNA's shareholders. HNA said the comments caused the company to lose business and suffer a drop in share prices, but Guo said he welcomes a legal spat with giant Chinese conglomerate in the United States. In March 2019, however, HNA claimed that Guo's statements had no longer caught public attention and planned to drop this suit. Almost at the same time, Guo posted tweets on his own social media \\"Guo Media\\" declaring that he refused to withdraw from the HNA case and would continue. On 20 November 2018, Guo held a conference with his close friend Steve Bannon in New York about the death of Wang Jian in France, who was the former chairman of HNA Group. During the conference, he announced the establishment of \\"Rule of Law foundation\\" for investigations about Chinese government financial activities as well as those of its supporters and offering financial support for businessmen, officials and others who are persecuted by Communist Party of China and forced to flee overseas like Guo himself. This foundation consists of two parts which are different types of nonprofit organization. One part called \\"Rule of Law Foundation\\" is type 501(c)(3) while the other part called \\"Rule of Law Society\\" is type 501(c)(4). Kyle Bass serves as the chairman of part 501(c)(3) and Steve Bannon serves as the chairman of part 501(c)(4). The first donation was 100 million dollars from Guo. In December 2018, Roger Stone agreed to a settlement with Guo in which Stone would retract a false claim, published , that Guo had donated to Hillary Clinton. In July 2019, Guo won a lawsuit in a defamation case with former university professor Xia Yeliang, which is considered as a \\"rare case of successful action by public figure\\" by some analysts. On 23 July 2019, Strategic Vision US LLC, a US commercial research firm which has a commercial dispute with Guo, sued Guo in the US federal court, said Guo was a spy for the Chinese Communist Party. However, this lawsuit was dismissed, and after that Guo filed a US$50 million defamation lawsuit in New York state against several companies and individuals including Strategic Vision US and CNN host Erin Burnett, who called him a spy during the Outfront television program. In August 2019, it was revealed that the Hong Kong Police Force froze bank accounts of Guo and other family members in 2017; in court documents requesting funds be released filed by Anton Development Limited, a company held by Guo's daughter Guo Mei. The freezing is part of a judicial review against the freezing of various assets linked to Guo and in relation to a HK$32.9 billion (S$5.8 billion) money laundering investigation, where court filings focus on Guo and other family members using their personal bank accounts and the bank accounts of Anton Development Limited and Hong Kong International Funds Investments Limited; the frozen accounts are said to total at least HK$1.56 billion. A writ provided by Anton Development Limited to police reportedly stated that HK$730 million in the frozen accounts were investment funds from a sovereign fund in Abu Dhabi. ==GNews== Guo's site, gnews.org (\\"GNews\\"), is part of Guo Media. Guo and GNews have been linked closely with Steve Bannon, who previously worked for Breitbart. On the February 21 edition of War Room: Pandemic (removed from YouTube for violation of Community Guidelines),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnTbOC4eESA&feature;=youtu.be the news site claimed that the Chinese government was going to admit that the coronavirus disease 2019 came from a nearby virus lab, or alternately admit that it was spread by the Chinese military, however, both of these claims have been widely disputed. Bannon asked Guo on February 21 about the sources of coronavirus; he said \\"there is no doubt this is man-made\\". The theory, voiced by Guo in February 2020 during the early days of the pandemic, has been characterized as misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==See also== * GTV Media Group, a company formed in 2020 by Guo and Bannon. * Hao Haidong ==References * Personal website: (1) GUO MEDIA (2) GNews (3) G-TV * Rule of Law foundation official sites: (1) Rule of Law Foundation, 501(c)(3) (2) Rule of Law Society, 501(c)(4) Category:Businesspeople from Shandong Category:Living people Category:People from Liaocheng Category:Chinese billionaires Category:Chinese emigrants to the United States Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Guo Wengui"},{"id":"46295190","text":"The plaque of Tsinghua Garden Entrance to \\"Â∑• Shape Hall\\" Overview of the place The corridor of the \\"Â∑•\\"-Shaped Hall \\"Shui Mu Qing Hua\\" (Ê∞¥Êú®Ê∏ÖËèØ), one of the attractions in Tsinghua Garden An arched bridge Tsinghua Garden () is a garden in Haidian District, Beijing, China. Constructed during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661‚Äì1722) in the Qing dynasty, it was originally named \\"Xichun Garden\\" (). Later, it was divided into two gardens: Chunze Garden () and Hande Garden (). Chunze Garden and Hande Garden were later respectively renamed to \\"Jinchun Garden\\" () and \\"Xichun Garden\\" (its former name). In 1852, during the reign of the Xianfeng Emperor, the garden was renamed again to \\"Qinghua Garden\\" (or \\"Tsinghua Garden\\"). In the present-day, \\"Tsinghua Garden\\" generally refers to the locations of the Tsinghua University, such as Tsinghua Garden, Jinchun Garden, and other Qing dynasty gardens in the university. ==History== Tsinghua Garden, originally the Xichun Garden, was granted as a gift by the Kangxi Emperor to his third son, Yinzhi (Prince Cheng). It was part of the Old Summer Palace and was called the \\"East Garden\\" (Êù±Âúí) because it was located to the east of the Old Summer Palace. The Kangxi Emperor visited the garden ten times when the garden was owned by Yinzhi, and celebrated eight of his birthdays at the garden, including his 60th birthday in 1713. He also wrote calligraphy for five plaques displayed all over the garden, one of which was the garden's name (Xichun Garden). In 1821, the Daoguang Emperor divided the Xichun Garden into Chunze Garden (later renamed to Jinchun Garden) and Hande Garden (later renamed back to Xichun Garden), and granted them respectively to his brothers Mianxin (Prince Ruihuai ÁëûÊá∑Ë¶™Áéã) and Miankai (Prince Dunke ÊÉáÊÅ™Ë¶™Áéã). After Miankai's death, Xichun Garden was inherited by his adopted son, Yicong (Prince Dun). As Yicong was actually the fifth son of the Daoguang Emperor, Xichun Garden was loosely referred to as the \\"Fifth Prince's Garden\\" (Â∞è‰∫îÁà∫Âúí). In 1852, after the Xianfeng Emperor came to the throne, he renamed Xichun Garden to \\"Qinghua Garden\\" (or \\"Tsinghua Garden\\"). In 1860, during the Second Opium War, the Anglo-French forces destroyed Jinchun Garden while burning down the Old Summer Palace. Qinghua Garden sustained little or no damage. After Yicong's death, Qinghua Garden was inherited by his eldest son, Zailian. In the aftermath of the 1900 Boxer Rebellion, Qinghua Garden was confiscated by the Qing imperial government because it had been used by Zailian's younger brother, Zaiyi (Prince Duan), as a meeting location with the Boxer rebels. The garden fell into disrepair for some years before the imperial government approved a request by the foreign affairs ministry to build a school on the land. The school, named \\"Qinghua School\\" (Ê∏ÖËèØÂ≠∏Â†Ç), started operating in 1911. In 1913, Qinghua School acquired the former Jinchun Garden and the surrounding areas, and gradually expanded over time to become the present-day Tsinghua University. == References == * Category:Chinese gardens Category:Tourist attractions in Beijing Category:Tsinghua University buildings ","title":"Tsinghua Garden"},{"id":"46295249","text":"Q'asa Pata (Quechua q'asa mountain pass, pata step, bank of a river, \\"mountain pass step\\" or \\"mountain pass bank\\", also spelled Ccasapata, Qasa Pata) is an archaeological site in Peru.

He was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1785. He entered Jesus College, Cambridge as a fellow-commoner in 1786, graduating B.A. in 1790 and M.A. in 1794. Vaughan was in France and Geneva in 1790‚Äì1. He corresponded from the continent with John Richter and William Frend. ==Opponent of the Pitt clampdown== Back in England, Vaughan was part of the London radical milieu including James Losh; also one of the group dining with John Horne Tooke. He was called to the bar in 1792. In spring of that year he was involved in drafting the constitution of the London Corresponding Society (LCS). and consulted about with the Society for Constitutional Information. He became a dedicated LCS member, much involved in legal matters. From early in 1793, judicial measures, some questionable procedurally and some seen to be over-severe, were used to repress reforming views. In July Vaughan successfully defended a Knutsford bookseller who had stocked works of Tom Paine. Advising James Watt junior, then abroad, Vaughan took the view that he was safe from prosecution. He was counsel, with John Gurney, for Thomas Briellat, convicted in December 1793 for using seditious language. In making the defence case, Vaughan emphasised the ubiquity of the Association for Preserving Liberty and Property. In 1794 Vaughan visited Thomas Muir in his prison hulk, with Joseph Priestley. In February, with Gurney, he successfully defended Daniel Isaac Eaton on a sedition charge, for publishing an allegory by John Thelwall. The defence rested largely on freedom of the press, and the jury refused to find that Eaton had criminal intention.H. T, Dickinson, Thomas Paine and his British Critics (PDF), pp.51‚Äì2, Enlightenment and Dissent No. 27, 2011 Vaughan took part as junior counsel in the defence of the reformer Thomas Walker on trial in Lancaster for seditious conspiracy, with Thomas Erskine. The trial began in April 1794, and Walker was acquitted, with the main prosecution witness discredited. Vaughan in May 1794 defended George Harley Vaughan, a schoolmaster who had circulated a handbill about the war and its effect on the poor, on a seditious libel charge in Leicester.The City of Leicester: Parliamentary history, 1660-1835, in A History of the County of Leicester: Volume 4, the City of Leicester, ed. R A McKinley (London, 1958), pp. 110-152 http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/leics/vol4/pp110-152 [accessed 2 April 2015]. He was present with John Frost when John Horne Tooke's house was searched after his arrest in May, and visited him in the Tower of London. Subsequently, however, he was examined by the Privy Council, where he fended off implications of misprison of treason. As a consequence he was denied access to Horne Tooke, for a period from June. He has been considered the author of the pamphlet Cursory Strictures of 2 October 1794 on the handling of the treason trials by Sir James Eyre LCJ, as has William Godwin. He was junior counsel also that month in the trial of Thomas Hardy, and for the trial of Horne Tooke in November. Pages were removed from the LCS minute book, and Vaughan has been considered likely to be the person who did that. Of the group of defendants charged with Hardy and Tooke, Jeremiah Joyce chose Vaughan as counsel, rather than the team of Erskine and Vicary Gibbs. In January 1795 Vaughan was unsuccessful in the defence of James Montgomery at Doncaster Assizes. In 1797 he and Samuel Romilly defended John Gale Jones at Warwick Assizes; Jones was convicted but not sentenced. Thomas Banks made a series of plaster busts of the radicals around Horne Tooke, and Vaughan was included. ==Death== Vaughan died at his chambers in Lincoln's Inn, aged 32 or 33. He left a legacy to Horne Tooke, and property to Thomas Walker. Samuel Parr composed a Latin inscription for him. ==Notes== Category:1799 deaths Category:English barristers Category:1766 births Category:People educated at Harrow School Category:Alumni of Jesus College, Cambridge ","title":"Felix Vaughan"},{"id":"46295302","text":"Argentine Federal Police at a train station in the Buenos Aires Underground.

Corruption remains a serious problem in the public and private sector even though the legal and institutional framework combating corruption is strong in Argentina. A 1996 New York Times article noted that \\"payoffs, kickbacks and government corruption are considered part of everyday life\\" in Argentina. Bribery and fraud are also found common among the private sector, and the lack of transparency in government regulations and laws has triggered an increased uncertainty among investors. The Financial Times noted in 2013 that in Argentina corruption is widely considered to be \\"engrained,\\" and \\"there is the sense that public officials are untouchable.\\" In May 2013, sociologist Atilio Bor√≥n lamented that \\"the Argentinian is very accustomed to the idea that governments are corrupt, and does not seem shocked at acts of corruption,\\" and that the corruption of politicians therefore does not prevent their reelection. \\"This is an economy that for the past 20 years has tolerated a legal drain of over 160 billion dollars,\\" he added, \\"and this it now coming to take its revenge.\\" A CIPCE (Center for the Investigation and Prevention of Economic Crimes) study concluded that public sector corruption alone cost the national treasury around US$10 billion from 1980 to 2006. A major Argentine newspaper, La Naci√≥n, editorialized in October 2013 that although corruption has been a major problem in Argentina since the 1890s, it has been \\"on the increase\\" since the 1990s. WikiLeaks cables released in 2011 revealed that diplomats from the United States and several other Western countries had expressed deep concern about the current levels of corruption in Argentina. \\"Under President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner,\\" reported the Heritage Foundation in 2013, \\"respect for markets and the rule of law has deteriorated and corruption has boomed.\\" According to Transparency International, Argentina has sufficient legislation and institutions dedicated to the prosecution of corruption in the public sector, but enforcement is highly inadequate, with the result that \\"impunity continues to trump integrity.\\"  Domestic violence  Public and private institutions offer prevention programs and provide support and treatment for abused women. In general, complaints of domestic violence are addressed in civil courts, which can secure protection measures, including banning a perpetrator from a victim‚Äôs home or workplace.United States Department of State In 2012, the Congress passed an anti femicide law imposing stricter penalties on perpetrators who kill their spouses, partners, or children as a consequence of gender based violence.United States Department of State == References == ","title":"Crime in Argentina"},{"id":"46295350","text":"Jordan Markus Haynes (born January 17, 1996) is a Canadian professional soccer player who plays as a full-back for Pacific FC. ==Club career== Vancouver Whitecaps Haynes was a member of the Vancouver Whitecaps FC Residency program from 2011 to 2014.

The comet was independently discovered by Robert L. J. Ellery in Melbourne and observers in South Africa, Chile and Brazil. In addition to Abbott and Ellery, John Tebbutt in Windsor, New South Wales, Carl Wilhelm Moesta (1825‚Äì1884) in Santiago, C. C. Copsey in S√£o Jo√£o del Rei, and William Mann (1817‚Äì1873) at the Cape of Good Hope made telescope observations of this comet. At the first observations, the comet‚Äôs tail had a length of from 10¬∞ to 12¬∞. Before its discovery, the comet reached its perihelion and its closest approach to planet Earth. From its discovery and through the end of January the comet was visible, in the Southern Hemisphere, to the naked eye. Ellery in Melbourne described the comet as ‚Äúnot nearly so bright‚Äù as Donati‚Äôs Comet. The maximum length reported for the tail was 25¬∞ on January 21. At the end of January the tail's length was about 17¬∞. In the Southern Hemisphere, the comet was visible to the naked eye for the entire month of February. At the beginning of March, the tail was barely ¬Ω¬∞ and soon the comet could be observed only by telescope. William Mann at the Cape of Good Hope successfully observed the comet through April and until May 2. On 24 January, the comet reached its maximum brightness of magnitude 1. ==Orbit== Using observations of the comet over 102 days, Felix K√∂rber was able to calculate only a parabolic orbit, inclined to the ecliptic by about 92¬∞. The comet reached its perihelion of approximately 0.026 AU on January 14 and then on January 15 its closest approach to planet Earth of approximately 0.94 AU. On January 16 the comet passed by Venus at a distance of approximately 0.67 AU. ==Tebbutt's summary== In the section of his Astronomical Memoirs entitled 1865, Tebbutt wrote: (Note that 2.5 million miles = .02689 AU; compare this perihelion value with the perihelion of Halley's comet at .586 AU.) ==References== Category:Non-periodic comets 18650117 ","title":"C/1865 B1"},{"id":"46295387","text":"Crazy Monkey Studios is an independent video game development studio.

Part of the Sydney Ferries network, it is operated by Transdev Sydney Ferries and services the Lavender Bay and Darling Harbour areas. It began operation on 25 October 2020, and replaced the western half of the F4 Cross Habour. Emerald-class ferries and SuperCat ferries operate the service. The F4 Pyrmont Bay follows the same stopping pattern as the ceased Darling Harbour ferry service, officially known as F4 Darling Harbour. The Darling Harbour service was operated by the State Transit Authority from its commencement in the 1980s, the Sydney Ferries Corporation from 2004, and Harbour City Ferries from 2013 until the service was replaced by the F4 Cross Harbour service on 26 November 2017. It was originally created to promote tourist and traveller pilgrimage to the Darling Harbour precinct after its redevelopment in the 1980s. First Fleet and HarbourCat ferries usually operated the service. King Street Wharf served as the route's terminus during the majority of its later lifespan before it was replaced by Barangaroo. ==History== Animation depicting Darling Harbour ferry services from the 1992 Sydney Ferries timetable onwards. (Click to enlarge) After the redevelopment of the Darling Harbour precinct in the 1980s until the late 1990s, the area was serviced by public transport with only one wharf, the Aquarium ferry wharf; adjacent to the Sydney Aquarium. The wharf was opened as part of an initiative to promote pilgrimage to the new Darling Harbour precinct and its new attractions, such as the Aquarium. It also coincided with the opening of the Sydney Monorail loop from Town Hall to Darling Harbour. Routes from Circular Quay to Aquarium and vice versa usually included stops at Darling Street Balmain / Balmain East and McMahons Point. Following the opening of the Milsons Point and Pyrmont Bay wharves in the late 90s, Darling Harbour ferries also included these stops, with Pyrmont Bay being the terminus of the route. Balmain was also included on the route after timetable changes in April 2002, as a stop between Balmain East and Aquarium. After July 2008 timetable changes, the route was briefly split into two terminuses, with Balmain East serving as a junction between a route to Balmain and a Route to Pyrmont Bay. Darling Harbour wharf, the former terminus of the F4 Darling Harbour service from 2010 to June 2017. After a publicised fatal collision of the Sydney Ferries HarbourCat Pam Burridge and the private vessel Merinda in March 2007, resulting in the death of four people and injury of two others, a report on the Sydney Ferries Corporation, the previous operator of the Sydney Ferries system, conducted and written by Bret Walker, was commissioned by then-Premier of New South Wales Morris Iemma and released in November 2007. One of the many recommendations of the \\"Walker Report\\" was to create a new ferry terminal at Darling Harbour, to ease congestion on the network, especially at Circular Quay. The plan for the Darling Harbour service was to decommission the Aquarium wharf, leaving it for use by commercial vessels, and rerouting services from Aquarium to Darling Harbour wharf, which was already in use as a stop on the Parramatta River service. This would create a new interchange between Parramatta River and Darling Harbour services; a terminal in which was created with the December 2011 timetable change, though, Pyrmont Bay still served as the terminus of the service until the October 2013 timetable change. In May 2013, it was announced by Transport for NSW that a new terminal servicing the redeveloped Barangaroo precinct will be built to replace the King Street Wharf terminal. The new wharf at Barangaroo was to be located a few meters north of the King Street Wharf; construction commenced in 2015/16 and opened in June 2017. Darling Harbour wharf was then decommissioned by Sydney Ferries for use for tourist and commercial purposes after the new wharf's opening. Both Darling Harbour and Parramatta River services were rerouted from the Darling Harbour to Barangaroo. The Darling Harbour service was replaced by the F4 Cross Harbour ferry services on 26 November 2017. Following community consultation jointly held by the ferry operator Transdev Sydney Ferries and Transport for NSW in 2019‚Äì2020, the F4 Cross Harbour route was divided into F4 Pyrmont Bay and F9 Watsons Bay services on 25 October 2020. During the consultation, the new F4 was originally planned to be known as the F4 City Connector. The F4 Pyrmont Bay service follows the same stopping pattern as the Darling Harbour service. ==Service== Present {  style=\\"font-size:95%; text-align:center;\\" !Name !Distance from Circular Quay !Waterway !Serving suburbs !Other lines - ! colspan=\\"7\\" \\" Pyrmont Bay ‚Äì Circular Quay - Pyrmont Bay 4.5 km  rowspan=\\"3\\" Darling Harbour Pyrmont  - Barangaroo 3.9 km Barangaroo, Sydney CBD  - Balmain East 3.0 km Balmain East  - McMahons Point 1.7 km  rowspan=\\"2\\" Lavender Bay McMahons Point  - Milsons Point 1.3 km Milsons Point  - Circular Quay 0.0 km Sydney Cove Sydney CBD, The Rocks  } 2013‚Äì2017 The Darling Harbour service was officially known as the F4 Darling Harbour service, under current Transport for NSW design and operation architecture. It was one of seven distinct routes on the current Sydney Ferries network between 2013 and 2017. When created in the 1980s, the route first consisted of stops at McMahons Point, Balmain East and Sydney Aquarium. Additional stops at Milsons Point, Balmain and Pyrmont were included on the route in the early 2000s, however, Balmain was later removed from the route and an inquiry into Sydney Ferries in 2007 advised the creation of a new terminal at Darling Harbour be built, which would become Barangaroo. Ferries travelling towards Barangaroo from Circular Quay departed from Wharf 5. It typically took 23 minutes to travel from Circular Quay to Darling Harbour, where the service terminated. There was a short interval between arrival and departure of ferries from Barangaroo travelling towards Circular Quay, lasting 3 minutes off-peak and 7 minutes on-peak. The Pyrmont Bay wharf could only be accessed on the Darling Harbour to Circular Quay service. Ferries travelling towards Darling Harbour did not stop at Pyrmont Bay. A trip from Darling Harbour towards Circular Quay usually lasted 27 minutes. In 2015, both Balmain East and Pyrmont Bay were closed for reconstruction and upgrades. Balmain East was officially closed for upgrade on 14 January 2015, with the upgrade completed by May 2015. Pyrmont Bay was closed in April 2015 . The Casino wharf nearby was used to temporarily replace Pyrmont Bay during the upgrade. ==Fleet== Scarborough pulling into Pyrmont Bay in August 2014 First Fleet class ferries, such as the Golden Grove The fleet of ferries that ran the Darling Harbour service were of the First Fleet class; ferries commissioned and entered into service in 1984 to 86. The First Fleet ferries are a series of compact, catamaran double decker vessels, which include a third deck for crew, designed to carry up to 396 passengers. At the cessation of F4 Darling Harbour in 2017, there were nine First Fleet class ferries that operate on the Sydney Ferries network, however only four were used for the Darling Harbour service. First Fleet ferries were typically swapped out for use on other Inner Harbour services, though, the Golden Grove and Scarbrough were the most common of the ferries to operate on the route. HarbourCat class ferries Anne Sargeant and Pam Burridge also operated the route as backup vessels. ==Patronage== The following table shows the patronage of Sydney Ferries network for the year ending 30 June 2020. ==References== ;Notes ;Citations ==External links== * Category:Ferry transport in Sydney Category:Darling Harbour ","title":"Darling Harbour ferry services"},{"id":"46295424","text":"Kanichi (from Ayacucho Quechua, see: khamuchiy Hispanicized spelling Caniche) is an archaeological site in Peru.

He took up classical music as a career full-time after graduating from the Utrecht and Tilburg Conservatory. He became influenced by the theremin after hearing the work of Clara Rockmore and began researching the instrument's history and teaching himself how to play one. As well as watching old videos of Rockmore, he consulted a friend who played the cello for musical advice. He learned Rachmaninoff's \\"Vocalise,\\" which has become one of his favourite pieces. He has subsequently played over 100 concerts using the theremin, including in Saint Petersburg and a tour of the United States. In 2014, J√∏rgensen performed at the Music and Beyond festival in Ottawa, performing Daniel Mehdizadeh's \\"The Awakening of Baron Samedi\\". Together with Dutch harp player Renske de Leuw, Thorwald premiered \\"Sirenum scopuli\\" by Canadian composer Victor Herbiet at the X Rio Harp Festival in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2015. J√∏rgensen has been described as \\"one of the most important exponents of classical music on the theremin\\". In interviews, he has said he considers the theremin capable of being a serious instrument, rather than the novelty it is normally perceived as. He believes he can reproduce all the sounds in a typical classical string section from double bass to violin. In concert, usually after a performance of \\"Vocalise\\", he likes to explain the operation of the instrument to the audience, saying the performance \\"should be about the music and not about me playing in the air\\". He has assembled a library of theremin music from stock libraries in both the Netherlands and worldwide, and has lectured on composition at the Conservatory of Amsterdam and Rotterdam Conservatory.

It is a commensal species with its host organism but has the ability to colonize and create infection. In the presence of virulence factors (H2O2, antigen proteins, etc.) is when these species start to over colonize . They have relatively small genomes, utilizing their host organisms natural processes to further their growth and survival. Nutrient required by the Ureaplasma species to continue metabolism are taken directly from the host. They proliferate in environments with a pH of 6.0-6.5 and a temperature of 35-37¬∞ C. These characteristics are common to most biological environments which is why Ureaplasma species regularly cause infection. These infections can be found in the genital and respiratory tracks of avian species (chickens and turkey). Ureaplasma gallorale infections cannot always be managed by the host due to the mechanisms the bacteria have adapted. A host will release immune signals of IgA molecules to the bacterial cells to signify infection but the Ureaplasmas can secrete an enzyme known as IgAse that destroys IgA, rendering the signal inactive and leaving the host susceptible to health concerns.These infections, known as the condition Ureaplasmosis, have further ramifications for the barnyard fowl such as low egg production, weight loss, reduced feed conversion efficiency and even death. These health issues are a serious concern in maintaining adequate production for the agricultural industry. == Classification == All species of Ureaplasma appear as gram-negative bacteria that utilize the hydrolysis or urea to produce energy for growth. Products of urea hydrolysis include carbon dioxide and ammonia. This reaction is coordinated by the enzyme urease, which Ureaplasma species potently secrete. Unlike most microorganisms, species of Ureaplasma lack a cell wall. Ureaplasma gallorale is further characterized as appearing only in avian species. In an experimental study, they found the 16s rDNA sequence for Ureaplasma galllorale was not able to be amplified by the same PCR primers used to amplify mammalian Ureaplasma species, suggesting a genetic differentiation in these sequences. The genome size is indicative of the organisms complete reliance on the compounds produced from the host. The Ureaplasma gallorale species, along with the other Ureaplasma species, are missing key biological pathways due to their small genomes but survive through absorption of the compounds found in their microenvironment. == References == Category:Ureaplasma Category:Pathogenic bacteria ","title":"Ureaplasma gallorale"},{"id":"46295508","text":"Evelyn Turrentine-Agee (born February 4, 1946 as Ruth Evelyn Tyler), is an American gospel musician and artist.

He held the WBO lightweight title from 2015 to 2017, becoming the first Englishman to win a world title in that weight class. He won the Prizefighter lightweight tournament in 2012, held the British lightweight title in 2014, and has challenged once for the WBO light-welterweight title in 2018. As of August 2020, he is ranked as the world's ninth best active light-welterweight by BoxRec. ==Professional career==  Super-featherweight  From Ancoats in Manchester, Terry Flanagan had his first professional fight in 2009, beating Danny McDermid on points. After winning his first 12 fights between 2009 and 2012, he beat Dougie Curran in May 2012 to take the vacant English super featherweight title. This was the second time the two had fought, previously meeting in 2010. Curran entered with a record of 0-6-1 in his previous seven bouts. Flanagan had one point deducted for holding in the 5th round. The judges, after 10 rounds scored the bout (99-90, 99-91 twice). He successfully defended the title four months later against Troy James on points (99-92, 99-93, 98-94). Lightweight Prizefighter tournament Flanagan took part in the Prizefighter Series: The Lightweights II at the Olympia in Liverpool on 6 October 2012. In the quarter finals, Flanagan defeated Patrick Walsh (10-1, 3 KOs) via unanimous decision 29-28 on all three judges cards. In the semi finals, Flanagan knocked down Derry Mathews (30-7-1, 16 KOs) in round 2, winning the fight via decision 29-27 on all scorecards. Flanagan went on to win the prizefighter tournament in the final defeating Gary Sykes (20-2, 5 KOs) via split decision (29-28, 29-28, 28-29). In April 2013, on the undercard of Khan-Diaz at Sheffield Arena in Sheffield, Flanagan fought and defeated former unified World Lightweight champion Nate Campbell (36-10-1, 26 KOs). Campbell retired on his stool at the end of round 4 with an injured right hand. On 26 July 2014, Flanagan claimed the vacant BBBofC British lightweight title by defeating British boxer Martin Gethin (24-5-1, 11 KOs). Gethin did not come out for round 8 after his right ear was badly swollen. Flanagan challenged WBO European lightweight champion Stephen Ormond (17-1, 8 KOs) on 14 February 2015 at the Civic Hall in Wolverhampton, United Kingdom. In round 9, Ormond was deducted a point for use of the head, and ultimately disqualified in round 10 for persistent use of the head, thus losing his belt in the process. At the time of disqualification, Flanagan was heading towards a unanimous decision win (88-82, 88-82, 88-82). The win ensured Flanagan would next fight for the WBO world title next. Possible opponents were Juan Diaz or Takahiro Ao. Flanagan vs. Zepeda After claiming the WBO European title, Flanagan stepped up to challenge unbeaten American Jose Zepeda (23-0, 20 KOs) for the vacant WBO lightweight title. The title was left vacant by Terrence Crawford, after he moved up weight class. The fight took place at the Velodrome in Manchester on 11 July 2015. Flanagan registered an early win on a technical decision. Zepeda sustained what looked like a bad dislocation to his shoulder due to clash of arms and was unable to continue, retiring on his stool after round 2. Despite the fight ending early, Flanagan admitted he was upset with the fight finishing after just six minutes of action and talked about a rematch to prove he is the better boxer. He told Boxnation, \\"I want to prove that I'm the better boxer. Now I'm world champion I can start believing in myself. Lifting a world title is unreal.\\" Early defences Flanagan successfully retained his world title on 10 October at the Manchester Arena in Manchester against number 1 ranked WBO 28-year-old Diego Magdaleno (28-1, 12 KOs). The fight was halted after Flanagan unloaded a flurry of shots against Magdaleno when he was trapped against the ropes. The official time of the stoppage was 2:38 of round 2. Flanagan dropped Magdaleno down three times in total. Referee Terry O‚ÄôConnor decided to halt it rather than let Magdaleno continue to fight. Flanagan met Liverpudlian Derry Mathews (38-9-2, 20 KOs) in a rematch, the first being the Prizefighter semi final, which Flanagan won, at the Echo Arena in Liverpool on 12 March 2016. The fight was originally scheduled to take place on 13 February, but was postponed after Flanagan suffered a severe tendonitis on his left foot. Although Flanagan was penalized one point in round eight for throwing and landing an illegal forearm to the chin of Mathews, Flanagan won the fight convincingly via unanimous decision (115-112, 117-110, 117-110). Flanagan overcame a slow start before taking control of the fight in the second half. Both boxers were knocked down once in round 2. Flanagan was set to make a third defence of his WBO lightweight title against former IBF super-featherweight champion Mzonke Fana (38-9, 16 KOs) on the undercard of Tyson Fury's cancelled July 9 rematch with Wladimir Klitschko. Due to that fight being postponed, the fight was moved to take place at the Ice Arena in Cardiff on 16 July. Flanagan successfully defended his title with a battling win that went the full 12 rounds. Fana rallied after a fourth-round knockdown from a huge left hook but Flanagan's class ensured a third successive title defence. Flanagan troubled Fana with another powerful left in the eighth before dropping him again in the final round. All three judges agreed a 120-106 points success to ensure Flanagan earned a 31st successive win. Flanagan vs. Cruz It was announced on 27 October 2016 that Flanagan would defend his WBO title against 35-year-old former world title challenger Orlando Cruz (25-4-1, 13 KOs) at the Motorpoint Arena in Cardiff on 26 November. A card promoted by Frank Warren which would also feature Billy Joe Saunders first title defence against Artur Akavov. Cruz failed to become boxing's first openly gay world champion after suffering a knockout loss to Orlando Salido for the vacant WBO featherweight title in 2013. This was Flanagan's fourth title defence. With a successful defence, Flanagan would be on course for a future unification fight against the winner of the rematch between Anthony Crolla and Jorge Linares. Flanagan spoke of the fight claiming Cruz is a dangerous fighter but he would be looking to retain his title via stoppage. Flanagan knocked Cruz down twice in the 8th round, the second of which came after a right hand to the temple, which prompted referee Steve Gray to stop the fight 43 seconds into the round. Flanagan had dominated throughout the fight until the finish. Flanagan vs. Petrov At a press conference on 23 January 2017, Frank Warren announced that Flanagan would be making his fifth defence of his WBO world title against former super lightweight world title challenger Petr Petrov (38-4-2, 19 KO's) on 8 April 2017 at the Manchester Arena in Manchester. This would be the first time since October 2015 that Flanagan would be fighting in his home city. The fight went the distance and Flanagan won via unanimous decision. One judge scored the fight a close 116-112 whilst the other two had wide margins of 118-110 and 120-108. Many media outlets including ESPN believed the wider scores were unfair and disrespectful to Petrov even though he may not have done enough to win the fight, he made a lot of rounds close and hard to score. Flanagan said he and his team would target the big names including Jorge Linares and Vasyl Lomachenko.  Cancelled defences  On 12 June 2017 the WBO president Francisco Valcarcel received word that promoters Bob Arum and Frank Warren were working closely together to come to an agreement for a fight to take place between Flanagan and undefeated mandatory challenger F√©lix Verdejo (23-0, 15 KOs). Some sources claimed the fight would take place on 9 September in Manchester. There was a hold up in the negotiations due to Verdejo being offered $175,000, however his representatives were looking for him to earn in the region of $450,000 having to travel to Flanagan's home country to challenge for the title. A deal was finally reached for the fight to take place on 16 September 2017 at the Copper Box Arena in London. WBO middleweight champion Billy Joe Saunders was confirmed to take part on the same card. The fight would also mark the fight title Flanagan would fight in London. On 17 July, Warren emailed Top Rank to make them aware that Flanagan had suffered a leg injury, thus postponing the fight. The WBO requested that medical evidence had to be sent to them. Flanagan's team confirmed the evidence would be sent the next day. On 29 September, WBO dropped Verdejo from their mandatory spot, revealing former world title challenger Raymundo Beltr√°n as their new mandatory. Promoter Warren stated he was looking scout big names and unifications for Flanagan. Another name mentioned was WBA champion Jorge Linares, however at the time, the WBC ordered him to fight their champion at lightweight, Mikey Garcia. Flanagan, frustratingly said, \\"I'm struggling to get a big fight. No-one wants to fight me and then I end up getting a voluntary, and everyone slags the opponent. I think they've [WBO] made [Ray] Beltran mandatory. I want unification's. When I beat Beltran everyone will say he's old and past it. I can't win. I'm getting worked up over it because I am the best, and I want to prove I am the best but I can't until them fights getting made. He claimed he did not want a fight with Anthony Crolla.\\" On 23 October, Flanaged stated a deal to fight Linares was 'all but done'.  Light-welterweight   Flanagan vs. Hooker  On 26 October 2017, the WBO confirmed that Flanagan had vacated their lightweight title in order to move up the light-welterweight division. At the same time, Crawford, the then WBO light-welterweight champion, had vacated to move up to welterweight. Flanagan entered the WBO rankings at number 1, making his first in line for the vacant title. Flanagan would likely challenge NABO titleholder Maurice Hooker (23-0-3, 16 KOs) for the vacant world title. On 4 January 2018, Dino Duva of Roc Nation Sports stated the fight between Flanagan and Hooker would take place on 14 April in the UK. Several sources stated the fight would take place at The O2 Arena in London, with WBO middleweight champion Billy Joe Saunders headlining the card. On 20 March, Saunders suffered a hand injury in training forcing the card to be cancelled, however that fight was quickly rescheduled for 23 June 2018 at the same arena. In regards to Flanagan vs. Hooker, Warren stated he was discussing a new date with Dino Duva, Hooker's representatives. On 12 April, Tyson Fury announced he had signed with Flanagan's promoter, Warren and was due to fight on 9 June at the Manchester Arena. With the announcement, it was likely that Flanagan, a Manchester local, would also fight on the same card. Warren officially confirmed the fight the following day. Flanagan failed to become a two-weight world champion, suffering his first loss as a professional via a split decision to Hooker, who came into the contest as the underdog. Two judge's scored it 115-113, 117-111 for Hooker, and the third judged had it 117-111 for Flanagan. Hooker used his size and reach advantage and landed his right hand many times accurately. Flanagan approached the fight going forward into Hooker, but had little success due to the disadvantage. Flanagan was warned by referee Terry O‚ÄôConnor for using his forearm a number of times. After the bout, Hooker announced he would enter the light-welterweight World Boxing Super Series tourney, which would commence in the fall. Flanagan's longtime manager Steve Wood admitted it was a tough night however stated his intention to get Flanagan another world title opportunity. According to Wood, Flanagan suffered a concussion in the bout due to the numerous head clashes. Flanagan was open to travelling to Texas for a potential rematch. Another likely scenario was for Flanagan to also enter the WBSS.  World Boxing Super Series  On 18 July 2018, Flanagan entered into the World Boxing Super Series:Light-welterweight tournament. The draw was scheduled to take place on 20 July at the Rossiya Theatre in Moscow. The other top light-welterweights to enter the tournament were Kiryl Relikh, Anthony Yigit, Ivan Baranchyk, Ryan Martin and Josh Taylor.  Flanagan vs. Prograis  At the draft gala, the number 1 seed, Interim WBC champion Regis Prograis (22-0, 19 KO), selected to fight Flanagan in the quarter-final. According to ESPN the fight was likely to take place on 27 October at the Lakefront Arena in New Orleans, Louisiana, marking it the first time Flanagan would fight outside of the UK. On fight night, Flanagan lost his second consecutive fight as Prograis beat him via a one-sided 12 round unanimous decision. The judges scored the fight 119-108, 118-109 and 117-110, all for Prograis. Prograis was doing enough in each of the rounds to win them as Flanagan was struggling to let his hands go, only managing to lad his jab. In round 8, Flanagan was dropped following a hook from Prograis. Flanagan beat the count but spent the rest of the round trying to survive. Flanagan was being out-worked in the following rounds. Prograis began to land one punch at a time. This allowed Flanagan to have a good round 11, which saw him land some punches clean. In the last round, Prograis was again able to stun Flanagan with some hard shots. With the win, Prograis advanced to the semi-finals to fight WBA champion Kiryl Relikh.

Antinous was a young Greek of extraordinary beauty from Bithynia, who became the beloved companion or lover of the Roman emperor Hadrian but later died in Nile under mysterious circumstances. Discovery in 1894 Stricken by the death of Antinous, Hadrian, who happened to be an admirer and a passionate supporter of classical Greek Antiquity, as well as a benefactor of the Oracle of Delphi, ordered that statues of the beautiful young man, whom he had loved so passionately, be erected in all sanctuaries and cities of his vast empire. Furthermore, he ordered the institution and establishment of Games in honor of Antinous, who since then was honored and worshiped as a god. Thus, a statue of Antinous was erected within the sanctuary of Delphi, after his death, in 130 A.D. and it was one of the most beautiful and impressive cult statues. During the excavations, the statue was discovered upright on its pedestal, next to the wall of a brick chamber, alongside the holy Temple. From the Roman coins minted to honor Œëntinous, we are informed that the representation of the statue was accompanied by the epithet \\"Propylaeus\\". So, it is legitimate to assume that it was originally placed at the entrance of the sanctuary. Later on, it suffered damages and broke at the height of the knee, so it had to be moved closer to the temple of Apollo, in a sort of chapel, where it was found during excavations, in relatively good condition. Its idealized characteristics as well as the intense polishing of its marble surface with a special oil (which helped it survive gleaming and in excellent condition), is indicative of the time of radical Hadrian. Taking a closer look at the statue, the head of young Antinous is tilted to the side like he is in a state of reflection. Around its thick and masterfully carved hair, which surround its face and fall on its forehead and cheeks, thus adding a mournful quality to its beautiful, full of vain youthful figure, several holes can be observed that were used to attach a bronze laurel wreath. His body is carved in a way that gives it the beautiful nudity which characterized the statues of gods and heroes of classical antiquity. However, the nostalgic Hadrian classicism is not enough for the statue to stand worthy of the art of its genuine classic models.Permanent exhibition of the Archaeological Museum of Delphi - Statue of Antinoos.Rosina Colonia, The Archaeological Museum of Delphi, Athens, Ministry of Culture -Archaeological Receipts Fund, 2009, 29-35.Panos Valavanis, Sanctuaries and Games in ancient Greece.

Famous for her oil paintings, sketches and ink and wash works, she was an accomplished artist, as well as a calligrapher and writer. One of her pieces has sold at auction for more than $100,000. She was taught by the well-known artist Xu Beihong, who regarded her as a \\"painter of genius\\" and had an affair with him. ==Life== Sun was born in Shou County, Anhui province in 1912 to educated and middle-class parents. Her original name was Sun Yunjun (). Her grandfather Sun Nai was a key minister in the late Qing dynasty. He was the first minister of education and founded the Beijing Normal University (the predecessor of Peking University). Her father, Sun Chuan-yuan, was an outstanding scholar in the democratic revolution of the late qing dynasty. He served successively as the secretary of Sun Chuanfang and the standing committee member of the Kuomintang in Anhui province. Her mother ran a girls' school. Sun had originally intended to study literature after completed her schooling at Anqing Girls School but she was unsuccessful at entering National Central University. In 1930, Sun Duoci audited classes in the fine arts department of Nanjing Central University during which time she was introduced to another famous painter, Zong Baihua. who was impressed by her talent. She took lessons from Xu Beihong. The art professor with a partner and family regarded Sun as a \\"painter of genius\\". He admired her work and invited her to pose for paintings.Sun Duoci, Tracy Zhu, 9 September 2014, Women of China, retrieved 2 April 2014 Xu shared the news of his new love with his partner Jiang Biwei in 1930 who decided to not make this an issue (Jiang was betrothed to someone else before she eloped with Xu). Xu was now a Professor of Art at National Central University. A Portrait of Sun Duoci by Xu Beihong Sun became a full- time student with Xu Beihong in 1931 and their established affair was well known. There were complaints about the extra attention that she got from her teacher and of how they both ignored the rules concerning male visitors to the university's female dormitory. Sun was obliged to stay with her aunt in Anqing and not live at the university. However, she continued to attend lectures whilst Xu Beihong travelled abroad in January 1933. After Xu returned, he and Sun both participated in trips to sketch at Huangshan, but their behaviour created gossip. Jiang Biwei, mother to Xu's two children, was so annoyed that she destroyed all of her husband's work that featured Sun. The controversy resulted in Sun leaving the university, but Xu Beihong did not leave his family. The status of their affair has been questioned in later accounts, as Xu's second wife, Liao Jingwen, wrote in her biography that was never any improper relationship between Sun and her husband. Instead, Liao stated that the gossip was mainly spread by Zhang Daofan, who wanted to separate Jiang Biwei from her husband. Sun returned to her old school and began teaching but without her degree. Xu and his partner finally agreed privately to separate in 1935. Sun published her first book Sun Duoci Sketches in 1936. Portrait of Sun Duoci by Xu Beihong The outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War necessitated in 1938 that Sun and her family should move to Changsha and here she again met Xu. Xu arranged for her whole family to move to Guilin where she worked as a civil servant. Xu, who was now a nationally well known painter, announced publicly in the newspaper Central Daily News that he would no longer live with his wife although it appears that they were never formally married. Xu sent a go-between to ask her father for permission to marry. Her father refused and much to Sun's later regret she decided to accede to her father's wishes. Sun and her family moved again to Lishui, Zhejiang province, where the 26-year-old Sun married provincial education minister Xu Shaodi. Xu Shaodi hired her as a lecturer at the University of British Arts and an associate professor at the National Hangzhou Art College. He helped her launch exhibitions in Shanghai in 1947 and moved her to Taiwan in 1949. Sun went on to study at Columbia University in the United States and then went to the National Academy of Fine Arts in France. She continued to correspond with her former lover Xu Beihong. Xu was said to have memorized poems that he sent her. In 1948 Sun and her husband moved to Taiwan where she taught at the art department of National Taiwan Normal University . She won the \\"Taiwan Ministry of Education\\" Fine Arts Award in 1957. She later moved to the United States and lived with a physicist and art lover Wu Jianxiong. She was also in close contact to the oil painter Wang Shaoling who lived in New York and was a friend to both Sun and Xu. It was at an art workshop in New York that she heard of Xu Beihongs sudden death in 1953. She wore mourning for three years, an unusually long period. In March 1975, she died at the age of 64 in Los Angeles of breast cancer. == Works == ‚ÄúSpring Dawn on Xuanwu Lake\\" \\"Self-Portrait of Sun Duoci\\" 1930, Sketch \\"The Swab Bottle\\" \\"Shi Xiao Gong\\" 1934, \\"The lion\\" 1961, Oil Painting \\"Thai Princess\\" \\"Tian Wen\\" \\"The Contemplator\\" \\"Farming\\" \\"Sister\\" ==Legacy== Her work \\"'Landscape; Lady\\" sold at auction for over $110,000 in 2014.Sun Duoci, Mutual Art, accessed 2 April 2014 ==References== Category:1912 births Category:1975 deaths Category:People from Lu'an Category:Chinese women painters Category:Chinese emigrants to the United States Category:Painters from Anhui Category:National Taiwan Normal University faculty Category:Nanjing University alumni Category:Republic of China painters Category:Educators from Anhui Category:20th-century women artists ","title":"Sun Duoci"},{"id":"46295736","text":"This is a list of defunct glassmaking companies, which are no longer in business. ==Defunct glassmaking companies== Belmont Glass Works A New England Glass Company ewer, 1840‚Äì1860 A Novelty Glass Company advertisement in 1891 An electrical insulator made by Whitall Tatum Company, circa 1922 * Alexander Gibbs * Bakewell Glass * Belmont Glass Company * Boston and Sandwich Glass Company * Cambridge Glass * Carr Lowrey Glass Company * Chance Brothers * Chandos Glass Cone * Cheshire Crown Glass Company * Clayton and Bell * Crystal City, Missouri * Dugan Glass Company * Dunbar Glass * Duncan & Miller Glass Company * Earley and Company * Fenton Glass Company * Fostoria Glass Company * General Glass Industries * Gr√∂nvik glasbruk * Hartford City Glass Company * Hazel-Atlas Glass Company * Heisey Glass Company * Helio (Cambridge Glass) * Hemingray Glass Company * Indiana Glass Company * J.

It is the fourth game in the Pok√©mon Rumble subseries, and features toy versions of at least 719 creatures from the first six generations. The game was first released worldwide as a free-to-start download title on the Nintendo eShop on April 8, 2015, with physical retail versions available in Japan the following November, Europe in January 2016, and North America in April 2016. ==Gameplay== Gameplay of Pokemon Rumble World Pok√©mon Rumble World is an action game with a top-down perspective that has players assume the role of their Mii character in the Kingdom of Toys, a land populated by toy versions of 719 distinct Pok√©mon species. At the behest of the King, the player must travel to various lands battling and collecting new Pok√©mon to increase their Adventure Rank, granting them access to new items and areas. By taking direct control of their Pok√©mon, they can engage other creatures in real-time combat. The game uses a form of currency called Pok√© Diamonds, which can be obtained either through normal gameplay, purchased directly with real money through the Nintendo eShop, or exchanged through StreetPass. A limit on real-world currency use in-game does exist, however, and players are allowed to purchase a maximum of 3,000 Pok√© Diamonds through this method. After buying 3,000 of these, a mine will appear, granting 40 of them once per day. Pok√© Diamonds can be used to unlock features such as increasing the chance to find certain Pok√©mon, in-game travel, continuing to play a stage after a Pok√©mon's health has run out, or additional Pok√©mon storage. Challenges, which are missions with a specific set of goals, may also grant Pok√© Diamonds, in addition to cosmetic items such as clothing. ==Development== The first mention of Pok√©mon Rumble World appeared in the game's entry on the Australian Classification Board content rating website in March 2015. It was officially announced two weeks later by Nintendo on an April 1, 2015 edition of their Nintendo Direct broadcast, along with a worldwide release date set for the following week on the Nintendo eShop. On October 2, 2015, Nintendo revealed that the title would receive a physical retail release in Japan the following month, with Nintendo of Europe later issuing a press release stating that an English retail version would also be arriving in Europe in January 2016. Retail versions of Rumble World remove support for in-game purchases, and instead grant the player access to all content from the start. ==Reception== Pok√©mon Rumble World earned a 32 out of 40 total score from Japanese Famitsu magazine, based on individual reviews of 8, 8, 8, and 8. The game received mixed scores from critics, earning a 58 out of 100 from Metacritic. Destructoid felt that the game's freemium pay model was a step up from Pok√©mon Shuffle, calling it \\"Not bad, actually\\", and that it would allow players to earn in-game currency through normal gameplay without being hindered by timers or required payments.

A year later it was decided to extend the line 10 mile south along the river as Bari-Juko was judged to provide better facilities than Wushishi.

It was the 24th year of ice hockey played by the Guildford Flames and the ninth season under Paul Dixon as head coach. The club would secure the 2015‚Äì2016 'Double' with the capture of the Cup and Playoff title. After a disappointing 2014‚Äì15 season, the Flames were quick to make changes, with the club releasing Neil Liddiard, David Longstaff, and David Savage just days after the season had ended. Further announcements were made during the off-season with the departure of Branislav Kvetan and fellow imports ‚Äì Jozef Kohut, Roman Tvrdon and Vladimir Kutny. It was announced towards the end of April 2015, that after indicating his intention to remain at the Spectrum for the forthcoming season, netminder James Hadfield, opted instead to sign with Milton Keynes Lightning. Talking about the decision Head Coach Paul Dixon said: \\"I spoke with James after the season, and as far as those conversations went he was returning to the club so we had plans for him in the roster, and were in the process of getting formal items in place for that to happen. Somewhere along the way he went a different route, and he informed us once something else was in place. It is a disappointing turn of events, but we will immediately move on and begin the replacement search.\\" Joining the club roster for the 2015‚Äì16 season was Slovenian forward Matic Kralj from Kazakhstan outfit Beibarys Atyrau. He was joined at the club by the Swedish forward Jens Eriksson. The two had played together previously in their career when they were both at the French club Ours de Villard-de-Lans. Other new additions to the team were defenceman Kevin Phillips, veteran goaltender Stephen Wall, Slovak centre iceman Erik Piatak, Callum Best and Rupert Quiney. The 2015‚Äì16 season was the first time in more than a decade that the Flames would wear a 3rd jersey. The alternate uniform debuted in the home victory over the Hull Pirates on Sunday, 13 September 2015 and made its final appearance against the Basingstoke Bison on Sunday, 8 November 2015. Prior to the first exhibition home game of the season the supporters club held their annual pre season meet the team afternoon at Burchatts Farm Barn on Sunday, 6 September 2015 from 12 am ‚Äì 2:00 pm. It was announced in October that the Flames had added forward Andrew Melachrino to the roster. The Guildford-born skater spent his entire junior career at the club and iced 49 times with the senior side between 2009 and 2011 when he split time at Jr. and Snr. level. He spent most of his senior career at the Basingstoke Bison. On Friday 27 November 2015 the club announced the signing of forward Lee Esders to the roster from Braehead Clan. Wednesday 15 December 2015 saw the club announce the arrival of Latvian forward Janis Ozolins from HK Mogo. Moments after a 2‚Äì1 road win at Bracknell on 10 January, the club announced on their website, that they had made a goaltending change with the release of Stephen Wall and the signing of Richard Ullberg. On 12 January the Flames announced that they had released Slovakian centre iceman Erik Piatak. The 29-year-old had 14 goals and 14 assists in 28 games with the club. } ==Roster== {  + !#!!Player!!Position!!Height!!Weight!!Date of Birth!!Nationality!!Previous Team - 7Kevin PhillipsD5'11\\"align=\\"center\\"180 lbs5 January 1986BritishBelfast Giants - 12Matic KraljF6'1\\"align=\\"center\\"200 lbs15 January 1983SlovenianBeibarys Atyrau - 16Andrew HemmingsF5'10\\"align=\\"center\\"185 lbs15 August 1988BritishBasingstoke Bison - 18Danny MeyersD6'3\\"align=\\"center\\"205 lbs2 March 1983BritishSheffield Steelers - 19Tom DugganF5'10\\"align=\\"center\\"185 lbs17 May 1990BritishManchester Phoenix - 22Paul DixonD5'10\\"align=\\"center\\"185 lbs4 August 1973BritishNewcastle Riverkings - 28Marcus KristofferssonF6'2\\"align=\\"center\\"205 lbs22 January 1979SwedishMulhouse - 37Roman TvrdonF5'11\\"align=\\"center\\"200 lbs29 January 1981SlovakianUnia Oswiecim - 44Rupert QuineyD6'4\\"align=\\"center\\"225 lbs30 May 1990BritishTelford Tigers - 45Gregg RockmanG5'10\\"align=\\"center\\"170 lbs24 May 1982BritishSlough Jets - 48Ben CampbellF5'10\\"align=\\"center\\"170 lbs16 May 1987BritishNewcastle Vipers - 51Erik PiatakF6'1\\"align=\\"center\\"205 lbs6 March 1986SlovakianGornyak Rudny - 61Sam GodfreyD6'0\\"align=\\"center\\"190 lbs2 February 1994BritishSwindon Wildcats - 74Matt ToweF5'10\\"align=\\"center\\"180 lbs7 January 1988BritishBraehead Clan - 82Jez LundinD6'1\\"align=\\"center\\"200 lbs9 February 1988USA- BritishNewcastle Vipers - 88Callum BestF5'10\\"align=\\"center\\"180 lbs16 January 1992BritishStreatham Redskins - 90Jens ErikssonF5'10\\"align=\\"center\\"194 lbs22 August 1984SwedishLHC Les Lions - 91Andy McKinneyF6'0\\"align=\\"center\\"190 lbs13 April 1991Canadian-BritishManchester Phoenix - 93Stephen WallG6'2\\"align=\\"center\\"205 lbs2 December 1981BritishMilton Keynes Lightning - } ==Standings== English Premier League {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !

seasons ","title":"2015‚Äì16 Guildford Flames season"},{"id":"46295999","text":"Little Blue Run Lake or Little Blue Run is the largest coal ash impound in the United States. FirstEnergy owns the site, located in Western Pennsylvania and parts of the Northern \\"Panhandle\\" of West Virginia, and has disposed of billions of gallons of coal waste into the body of water. Several court cases have been brought against the company as a result of the damage caused by the company's practices at the site. ==Description== The artificial lake was completed in 1975 and is located in both Beaver County, Pennsylvania and Hancock County, West Virginia and is owned by FirstEnergy, a publicly traded company with assets worth $48 billion in 2010. Before Little Blue Run Lake was created, the power company told local residents that the project would create a local recreational and boating area. The lake covers 1,900 acres and the waste in the lake is prevented from escaping thanks to a 400-foot tall, 2,200-foot wide rock-and-earth dam. The dam containing Little Blue Run Lake has been given a designation of \\"high hazard\\", meaning, there would be harm or loss of life if the structure were to fail. Some of the natural valleys in the area were filled with a coal ash slurry and held in place by one of the nation's largest high hazard dams. Coal slurry from Bruce Mansfield Power Plant in Shippingport was piped into the lake. This same coal slurry is piped into the lake via a seven-mile long pipeline. Toxic waste and risks The lake contains 20 billion gallons of coal ash and smokestack scrubber waste. The northern coast of the lake is only a few hundred meters from the Ohio River, which is the drinking water source for more than three million people. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) estimates that if the dam failed it would affect 50,000 people and has mandated that coal ash cannot be added to the lake after 2016. In 2015, Vice News reported that dangerous pollutants were leaking from the body of water into the local community. The Little Blue Run Coal Ash Impoundment is unlined and has over time leaked pollution into the local ground and surface water, which local families rely on for consumption, cooking, and bathing. Some local residents worry for their health because of this pollution. In addition to the water concerns, families living near the site worry about toxic dust and complain of a strong rotten egg smell from hydrogen sulfide (). ==Lawsuits against FirstEnergy== Numerous lawsuits regarding Little Blue Run Lake have been filed against FirstEnergy. In one action, a notice of intent to sue letter was filed by The Environmental Integrity Project and Public Justice on May 30, 2012. The notice of Intent alleged that toxic pollution and leaks from the Little Blue Run Impoundment violated State and Federal environmental laws. The leaks from the Impoundment allowed boron, manganese, sulfates, arsenic, and other pollutants to discharge into local water sources. On day 59 of a 60 day notice of intent to sue waiting period, the PADEP filed the first ever state lawsuit for a coal ash disposal site. This state action was taken against FirstEnergy because the Little Blue Run Impoundment caused a potential \\"imminent and substantial endangerment\\" to human health and the environment. Simultaneously the PADEP filed its lawsuit and a consent decree in federal court seeking the closure of the Little Blue Run Coal Ash Impoundment. The consent decree \\"The consent decree requires First Energy to submit a plan to close the plant by the end of 2016. The company will also have to pay a fine of $800,000, supply 21 households with hook-ups to municipal water systems, and conduct an environmental impact study on the area.\\" FirstEnergy is required to clean up the site by 2031, but in April 2014, FirstEnergy agreed to have the site cleaned by 2028. FirstEnergy is required to cover the ash with two layers of impermeable \\"geotextile\\" sheeting to keep unhealthy chemicals from entering the local groundwater, it must monitor noise, odors and particulate emissions, conduct quarterly reconnaissance of contaminated water seepage from the lake and take corrective actions when necessary. According to the PADEP, FirstEnergy is also required to monitor the site \\"for as long as environmental problems remain at the site.\\" As a result of settling the lawsuit, FirstEnergy began disposing the byproduct (through the process of dewatering) in a lined impoundment at Murray Energy's mine in Marshall County, West Virginia. Another lawsuit was filed in Federal Court by 15 Beaver County, Pennsylvania residents and 36 West Virginia residents who accused FirstEnergy of contaminating groundwater and leaking hazardous waste, including arsenic, sulfates, sodium, calcium, magnesium and chloride into local waterways and groundwater systems. The dispute with the Pennsylvania residents, a minority of the parties who claim to have been affected, was settled out of court in February 2015. The terms of the settlement were undisclosed. ==References== Category:FirstEnergy Category:Lakes of West Virginia Category:Lakes of Pennsylvania Category:Bodies of water of Beaver County, Pennsylvania Category:Artificial lakes of the United States Category:Bodies of water of Hancock County, West Virginia ","title":"Little Blue Run Lake"},{"id":"46296011","text":" The RV Bilim-2 is a Turkish research vessel owned by the Middle East Technical University in Ankara and operated in deep waters by its Institute of Marine Sciences based in Erdemli, Mersin, Turkey. She was built by Istanbul Naval Shipyard in Pendik, Istanbul and launched in 1983 as RV Bilim (Turkish for \\"Science\\"). In 2006, she was renamed Bilim-2. She is the institute's main ship beside its two other smaller wooden-hull research boats, the 1979-built RV Erdemli and the 1981-built RV Lamas-1. Bilim-2 is equipped with a hydraulic trawl winch of 7.5 tonnes and 2 x wire capacity and a hydraulic net winch of 6-tonne capacity for fisheries and marine biological investigations. Marine geological studies are conducted using a shallow seismic system of type EG&G; Uniboom, side-scan sonars, and various corers. A remotely operated underwater camera (Mini Rover Benthos MK II) is also utilized in seafloor surveys. ==Characteristics== Vessel Bilim-2 is long, with a beam of and a max. draft of .

For this study, she operated in Black Sea coast from ƒ∞ƒüneada in the west to Hopa in the east during the fishing seasons beginning in 2011. Anchovy makes out about 60% of all fish caught in Turkey. In the 2011 fishing season, 200,000 tonnes of anchovy were caught while around 70,000 tonnes remained left in the sea. The fishing season for anchovy diminished in the last years to about one month in contrast to the same in the 1970s and 1980s when it lasted from November to May. Before the 2000s, the anchovy stock amounted to one-and-half million tonnes, according to experts. ==See also== *List of research vessels of Turkey ==References== Category:Active research vessels of Turkey Category:Ships built in Istanbul Category:1983 ships Category:Middle East Technical University Category:Erdemli District ","title":"RV Bilim-2"},{"id":"46296013","text":"Janhavi Acharekar (born 1973) is an Indian writer of fiction and travel.

It was founded by Varun Shrivastava, an IIT Kharagpur-graduate and NTPC Ltd Engineer, with the help of his colleagues on 20 May 2010 to make quality education available at the remote villages of India. It was registered as an NGO on 19 October 2011. ==History== UPAY (Underprivileged Advancement by Youth), was founded on 20 May 2010 by a group of young engineers from IITs and NITs working at NTPC Ltd in a small village called Kumbhari in the outskirts of Nagpur. It has been registered as an NGO under the Society Registration Act, 1860 and Mumbai Public Trust Act, 1950 (Reg No. Maharashtra/268/2011/Bhandara). Its main aim is to provide opportunities to underprivileged children. Since its inception, a large number of educated youth has joined this movement and has been spreading it across the country. Its members include teachers, doctors, engineers, lawyers, students, housewives, retired persons and other working professionals. == Projects == Reach & Teach UPAY was established to provide a SOLUTION to the everlasting problem of rural education. It is working on developing a sustainable process of imparting knowledge to these underprivileged children. We teach as well as imbibe our children with the spirit of UPAY. These children are further carrying this responsibility of upliftment of society. So these children are not just the students of UPAY but they are also the harbingers and volunteers of UPAY who are spreading its cause across the country. Right now, it has 17 centers having 1300 children. Footpath Shala In cities like Nagpur, Pune, Gurgaon and Mumbai people living on the footpath are doing some unskilled labor or literally begging for their bread & butter are some of them. There are people in the society who don‚Äôt have any planning for their future, who are struggling against poverty, malnutrition, unhealthiness, family planning. UPAY has taken initiative to replace begging bowls with books for street children in 9 centers with 350 street children enrolled at footpathshala. 20% street children are enrolled in schools. It is an open pathshala, similar to Rabindranath Tagore\`s concept of open schools. Classes are being taken by UPAY volunteers at Footpath only. Apnasaamaan.com Apart from educating the children, UPAY is also working on how to make these underprivileged areas economically independent. UPAY is targeting to tap the local skills and plans to develop small scale industries. Besides seasonal agricultural income, villagers should have perineal source of income and development. For this, a small development is introduction of an online portal,‚Äùapnasaamaan.com‚Äù. On this the local products developed by the villagers are available for sale. So that apart from the weekly village markets and limited customer base now their produce are getting exposure to a wide network. Granth on Rath We believe that if children can't reach to school, school must reach to them. with that concept UPAY has started an initiative\\" Footpathshala\\" for street children of Nagpur city by starting an open school at footpath . our volunteers go to footpaths of city where street children beg and live. we have started teaching them there only. This initiative has been very successful and at present we are operating at 5 locations with more than 100 street children coming to our open school. but developing a school infra structure at footpath was very much challenging so we have started a mobile school with mobile library, which is having all the necessary thing for running the Footpathshala . as there is no power supply at footpaths, we keep a battery run lights, projectors, TV for showing videos etc. GRANTH ON RATH is a mobile library for recycling the old books to the Under-privileged students from affluent students and bridge the rural urban divide. Books are provided to the under privileged students at a very nominal rent. We work as a medium providing the flow of books from rich students to needy & poor student . Every student has some set of books that are no more useful for them, those books can be used by some other student depending on the requirement. We will collect all those useless books from students and in return we will give books of their use on nominal rent of 20% of actual cost. At the same time we can Improve Incomes of villagers by providing employment opportunities to rural women for recycling and maintenance of books because to handle such quantum of books we need few workers who can collect, segregate and distribute the books. A small maintenance of the books will increase their life and same book can be useful for 2-3 students. Along with the books we will also collect the used notebooks; in the end of every note book we can find some unused pages which can be used for making a new notebook which could be sold on nominal price to generate some revenue. Waste and unused papers/books can be used for making paper. == Awards and Recognition == 1\\\\. Vidarbha CSR Award of Best NGO in the Field of Education. 2\\\\.

Ruins of Athcarne Castle The name Athcarne is thought to be derived from either Ath Cairn meaning the Bridge, or Fording Point at the Cairn, or burial mound, or alternatively from Ard Cairn, meaning High Cairn. There is a burial mound to the south east of the castle, across the Hurley River. Dr. Beryl Moore, the Meath historian, wrote that the castle may actually be built on top of a cairn. These cairns were built around 4,000 years ago. In 861, the Vikings raided Newgrange and Dr. Moore wrote that the Cairn(s) at Athcarne were also raided at that time. A location called Cerne, Cernae or Cerna in early historic times, including the townlands of CarnesEugene O'Curry, Cath Mhuige Lena or 'The battle of Magh Leana', (Dublin, 1855), p. 66 to the east of the ford at Athcarne, was noted as the principal burial site for the men of east Midhe and Brega (Cernoi nominatur, al.

The Cerna associated with a broken geas of Conaire M√≥r concerning the hunting of the cloen-m√≠la Cernai (the crooked beasts of Cerne), a place located near the Sl√≠ghe Chualann in the Togail Bruidne D√° Derga, was probably located along the Boyne at Kilcarn, near Navan. In 1172, the lands at Athcarne were granted to the Anglo-Norman knight Hugo De Bathe, who came from Bath in England. He arrived in Ireland, either with Richard, Earl of Pembroke (\\"Strongbow\\") in 1170 or with Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath in 1171. It is likely that he built a defensive structure on the site which evolved into a tower house over the next few hundred years. It was significantly extended in 1590 by the senior judge Sir William Bathe and his wife Janet Dowdall. On Sir William's death in 1597 it passed to his brother James Bathe, and then to James's heirs: James Bathe, who owned Athcarne in the 1640s, was probably the earlier James's grandson. On 31 August 1649, Oliver Cromwell marched north from Dublin with 12,000 men to take Drogheda from the 'Royalists'. He captured Ballygarth Castle on the River Nanny at Julianstown, where it enters the sea. This was a strategically important point to control. On 1 September, the Earl of Ormonde issued an instruction to the Royalist troops in Drogheda to capture three other castles near the crucial crossing points on the river Nanny, and hence strategically important: they were Athcarne, Bellewstown and Dardistown Castles. However, Cromwell's troops got there before them and captured all 3 castles on 1 and 2 September. Cromwell now controlled the river Nanny, running parallel to and south of the Boyne, where Drogheda was located. Following its capture, Athcarne was granted to a Colonel Grace, one of Cromwell's officers. James Bathe and his family then moved to Ashbourne. James Bathe died sometime before 1660. His son, Luke Bathe, continued lobbying the Crown for return of their estates. Despite petitioning to get his lands back, under the Second Act of Settlement 1662, Athcarne, as well as many of the estates originally taken by Cromwell were transferred into the name of the Duke of York, the future King James II of England. The Bathe family never regained legal ownership of Athcarne, although they were allowed to live there: in 1668, the Duke of York allowed Sir Luke Bathe to rent Athcarne and 1,200 acres from him on a 99-year lease from 1668 for ¬£430 in total, which was considered a \\"peppercorn\\" or nominal amount at the time. This lease expired in 1767. However, the future King kept all the other Bathe estates, Drumcondra, Glasnevin, Ballybough, Balgriffin, Clontarf, and Baldoyle, all in County Dublin, and Laudenstown in County Kildare, besides valuable other property in Dublin city and Drogheda. Of many legends about the Castle, which is said to be haunted, the most plausible is that King James II slept here on his way to the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, the Castle being only six miles from the battlefield. In fact, James II actually owned Athcarne at the time and the Bathe family were simply renting it from him on a long lease (see paragraph above). The Bathe family eventually left the castle about 1700 and it was owned by the Garnett family for the next 100 years or so. Around 1830, it was bought by the Gernon family who significantly remodelled it, demolishing the Elizabethan mansion house built by William Bathe in 1590 and building a more modern extension. The Gernon family experienced a downturn in fortunes and eventually the Castle was sold at auction in 1939. The Castle was gutted and the parts sold off for architectural salvage. A plan to demolish the castle and use the rubble to extend roads in the area came to nothing, and eventually what remained of the Castle passed into the care of the Irish State.

Up until recently, T. noae was mistaken as being part of the giant clam species Tridacna maxima, but is now known to be its own independent species. It has a broad distribution, but is mainly found in the Indo-Pacific. As with all giant clams, populations of T. noae, are declining due to human exploitation of flesh for consumption, shells, and as aquarium pets. T. noae and all members of Tridacninae are considered endangered, and have been since 1985. == Taxonomy == T. noae are marine bivalve molluscs in the subfamily Tridacninae, also known as giant clams. T. noae was originally described and named by R√∂ding (1798) based on figures in Chemnitz (1784). == Description == T. noae have a physical appearance typical to that of most bivalves, especially those in the Tridacninae, or giant clam, subfamily. T. noae typically have a shell length between 6-20 cm, and shells usually have 5-7 radial ribs. Mantle colors may vary and include brown, yellow, blue, and green. Black hyaline organs, or eyes, are arranged along the border of the mantle, along with a thin, white margin and ocellate spots. == Confusion with T. maxima == T. noae was first recognized as a cryptic species from T. maxima in Taiwan and Japan by Tang (2005) and Kubo and Iwai (2007) respectively. DNA sequencing characterizes the two as distinct species. T. noae is even closer related to other members of Tridacninae than T. maxima according to rRNA evidence. While T. noae is very similar in appearance to T. maxima, there are key differences that distinguish between the two, such as shell morphology, mantle pattern, and mantle coloration. The mantles of T. noae have ocellate spots with a thin, white border around the edge, along with hyaline organs‚Äîalso known as eyes‚Äîthat have an arrangement distinctive of the species. Although proven to be an unreliable distinguishing factor, T. noae usually have a higher number, between 5 and 7, of radial ribs on their shell, compared with between 4 and 6 in T. maxima. Confusion between the two species has led to overestimated population densities of T. maxima and potentially misleading conclusions in studies of T. maxima populations. == Distribution == T. noae have a broad distribution, mainly Indo-West Pacific, that overlaps with that of T. maxima. T. noae live in shallow waters, up to 20 meters in depth, and are typically found on the edges and crests of coral reefs, attached by byssal threads. T. noae populations were first recognized in Taiwan and Japan , but have been observed as far west as Christmas Island. Mitochondrial DNA markers break up the distribution of T. noae into three groups: east Indo-Malay archipelago to Western Australia, Melanesia to Micronesia, and Central Polynesia. == Threats and Conservation == All giant clams, including T. noae, have been listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species since 1985 and on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List since 1986 . Populations of T. noae have been on a decline due to human exploitation of the species. Known colloquially as the ‚Äúteardrop‚Äù clam, T. noae are exploited for their flesh for consumption, their shells for jewelry and collections, and as aquarium pets . Conservation efforts have been made to replenish the wild populations of T. noae through breeding in captivity, with the additional goal of culture for commercial markets . ==References== noae Category:Bivalves described in 1798 ","title":"Tridacna noae"},{"id":"46296109","text":"Guido Paci (December 27, 1949 - April 10, 1983) was an Italian professional Grand Prix motorcycle road racer.

Geiers were also making its league debut and advanced all the way to the Finals but lost to the eventual champion Kharaagiin Khartsaguud. Although was disappointed in his playing time, Sanchir began practicing harder than everyone during that summer and erased his own doubt in himself. His effort paid off as coach Tseverbal made Sanchir a starter for the Geiers in 2008‚Äì09 season. It was a break-out year for Sanchir as he led the league in scoring and rebounding. Although his team didn't win a championship, Sanchir was named the Most Improved Player of the season. In 2010, Sanchir accepted the offer to play for the Bayanzurkh Bulls, a newly established team of the MNBA. In the 2011 MBA All-Star Game, Sanchir led all in scoring and his team to a win, and was named the game's MVP. His popularity was growing fast. In 2011‚Äì2012 season, Sanchir began playing for the fan-favorite SBL Khasiin Khuleguud, which won the National Title three times before. Khuleguud advanced all the way to the Finals with Sanchir's scoring dominance and faced the Bulls, Sanchir's former team in the Finals. Unfortunately, they lost to the Bulls 4‚Äì2. In 2013‚Äì14 season, SBL Khasiin Khuleguud again advanced to the Finals against Alliance Tech Hawks. But this time, Sanchir wasn't going to accept the second place. Khuleguud swept the Hawks in four games and Sanchir won his first championship in the top league. Not surprisingly, Sanchir led everyone in scoring and was named the Finals Most Valuable Player. In 2014‚Äì15 season, Sanchir signed a two-year deal to play for the Mon-Altius Madimos Falcons and alongside American import Smush Parker, former Lakers point guard. The duo played well together, but struggled due to poor coaching and management. The Falcons finished the season in 4th place and advanced to the playoffs. But in the first round, they lost to the #5 seed Tanan Garid. Sanchir averaged 30.1 points, 8.3 rebounds, 3.9 assists during the season but shot only 39.7% from the field. On April 1, 2015, it was announced that Sanchir will be Barangay Ginebra's Asian reinforcement for the 2015 Governors' Cup. In Barangay Ginebra's game against Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters, Sanchir was controversially benched and did not play throughout the game, but earned sympathy and respect from fans. At the end of May, it was announced that Sanchir will be part ways with Barangay Ginebra and will be replaced by South Korean Jiwan Kim. Sanchir averaged 4.5 points, 1 rebound, and 1.8 turnovers in just 4 games wearing the Ginebra uniform. ==PBA career statistics== Correct as of May 31, 2015Player Profile at PBA-Online!

Eventually he made the team and began his international career by playing in the 2009 East Asian Championship Hong Kong representing Mongolia. Since then, he has represented Mongolia in many international tournaments such as East Asian and Asian Games, Asian Beach Games, Universiade and other competitions. Sanchir represented Mongolia in 2013 World Universiade, in which he averaged 20.8 points and 5.6 rebounds under 28 minute playing time. But he still led the tournament in scoring. He also made the winning 3-pointer against Japan. The victory helped Mongolia to finish in 16th place. 2014 Asian Games At the 2014 Asian Games, Sanchir again led the Mongolian team in scoring. But this time, history was made. The Blue Wolves began the competition from the bottom stage - qualifying round. They were with Hong Kong, Maldives and Kuwait in Group A. In the first game against Hong Kong, Sanchir scored 31 points and grabbed 13 rebounds and Mongolia beat Hong Kong 86‚Äì77. Then Mongolia had an easy win over Maldives 112‚Äì54, in which Sanchir played only 11 minutes and still finished with 10 points. Its final and most crucial game against Kuwait was important. Down by 1, Sanchir drove against Kuwait defenders and drew a foul. He made both shots and Mongolia was up by 1 with a few seconds remaining. On the last play of the game, Kuwait player shot the ball as time expired. The ball didn't go in, but a foul was called. Unfortunately, after a review, it was determined that there was no foul. Mongolia would lose a heart-breaking defeat but Sanchir led again with 23 points and 9 rebounds. In the preliminary round, Mongolia first played against Jordan. No one thought Mongolia would even give a fight. But after trailing the first quarter 18‚Äì14, Mongolia outscored their opponent 69‚Äì53 in the last three quarters and had a historic win. It guaranteed Mongolia to advance to the quarter-finals for the first time ever. Sanchir had 19 points, 7 rebounds and teammate Bilguun Battuvshin led the team with 26 points and 10 rebounds. Against host country South Korea, Mongolia gave a good fight in the first half, trailing by only a point. But the big opponents were too strong at the end, Mongolia lost 90‚Äì67. Sanchir led all players with 24 points. After the game, South Korea's coach gave a lot of credit to Mongolia, especially to Sanchir and respect was earned. In the quarter-final, Mongolia was pitted with China, Iran and Japan. Playing their 6th game in 5 days, the tired and under-manned Blue Wolves had no chance against China, losing by 41 points. Sanchir did his best with 15 points and 4 rebounds. Against Iran, coach Bayartsogt Odonbaatar rested Sanchir and Bilguun. Against Japan, Mongolia again lacked energy and lost by 26 points. Sanchir had 26 of the team's 70 points and grabbed 6 rebounds. In the Classification round, Mongolia first faced against Qatar and lost by only 9 points. Unfortunately, exhausted Sanchir had his worst game of the tournament, finishing with just 3 points. For the 7th place and final game of the tournament, Mongolia played against World Cup quality opponent Philippines. Besides leading the first quarter 21‚Äì18, Mongolia again couldn't close out the game and lost. Sanchir had 15 points and Bilguun led the team with 18 points. Although Mongolia didn't win a medal, it was a historic run for the underdog nation. Mongolia was the 8th best team in Asia, finishing on top of Chinese Taipei, Kuwait, Jordan, and India. ==References== Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:Barangay Ginebra San Miguel players Category:Mongolian men's basketball players Category:Philippine Basketball Association imports Category:Basketball players at the 2010 Asian Games Category:Basketball players at the 2014 Asian Games Category:Basketball players at the 2018 Asian Games Category:Sportspeople from Ulaanbaatar Category:Shooting guards Category:Small forwards Category:Asian Games competitors for Mongolia Category:Expatriate basketball people in the Philippines ","title":"Tungalagiin Sanchir"},{"id":"46296167","text":"Octopon is the second extended play by British rock band Dark Stares.

The rugby tour was sponsored by Land Rover and meant to raise charity funds for Max Brito, an Ivorian rugby national team player who got paralysed during a 1995 rugby union World Cup game in South Africa between Ivory Coast and Tonga. The tour was dubbed 'The last amateur tour'. the idea of the tour was originated in 1995 during the rugby World Cup by an England rugby union footballer Harvey Thorneycroft who led a group of amateur English rugby union footballers growing to become professionals and they collaborated with the South African Rugby team, for this tour to west Africa to play in Ghana and Ivory Coast and teach little kids in those countries the basics of the rugby game whiles raising funds to support Max Brito. Though the idea was brilliant, the tour team needed a man on the ground in West Africa who had the wherewithal to fix the practical difficulties in organising such a tour in West Africa. When he was contacted, Herbert Mensah facilitated travel arrangements for all the players from England and South Africa. Mensah also got Ghanaian international footballers playing in the English league at the time such as Tony Yeboah and others involved to raise massive local interest in the charity games. He also got local sponsorship including from the 5-star Labardi beach hotel involved in hosting the Max Brito tour. Other sponsors included airline companies operating in Ghana. Mensah, a former rugby union footballer himself guaranteed payment in case of damage or financial loss and accepted the risk for liability arising from such guarantee to the tour team, according to Harvey Thorneycroft. With strong connection to President Jerry John Rawlings of Ghana in 1996, Mensah gained official recognition and participation for the 1996 rugby discovery tour in Ghana with President Rawlings attending and ordering military aircraft displays over the Accra stadium during the charity games which also involved soccer games with the national team the black stars. Whiles in Ghana, Herbert Mensah got the touring rugby union footballers into the get into Ghanaian hospitality tour where the players applied themselves to teaching little Ghanaian kids how to play rugby football.

MAY 9 2019: Championing Charity Efforts 18 Years After Accra Stadium Disaster  In 2019, Ghana marked 18 years since the Accra stadium disaster claimed the lives of 127 Ghanaian soccer fans. This year also reached 18 years of efforts by some Ghanaian sports administrators to keep the memories of the victims alive through charity efforts like donations to the needy and the creation of public awareness about the need to avoid a repeat of the 2001 tragic incident. To create public awareness, Herbert Mensah, President of the May 9 foundation led masses of people including the physically disabled people as well as students from the Kwame Nkrumah University of science and technology and the media to walk through the principal streets of Kumasi, Ghana's second largest city and the home of his former football club, Asante Kotoko FC. Through a combination of personal resources, support from the King of Ashanti and corporate sponsorship from different organizations doing business in Ghana, 2019 saw an upscale in donations to the needy by the May 9 Foundation led by Herbert Mensah to mark the 18th annual anniversary. Again, the charity work of the May 9 foundation in 2019 extended beyond families of victims of the Accra stadium disaster. It also included victims of floods in Accra, victims of accidental gas explosions and the people living with physical disabilities. Mensah has attributed the choice of Kumasi, the capital of the Ashanti kingdom for the yearly remembrance and charity projects of the May 9 foundation to the unflinching material and open support by Otumfuo Osei Tutu II who is also the life patron of Kumasi Asante Kotoko football club. == Radio and TV Interviews== Mensah is frequently interviewed by the Ghanaian media due to his frank and open opinions.

Retrieved on 11 October 2015. == Philanthropy == Excelling in business and sports administration Mensah also engages in philanthropy. In Ghana, he has been involved over the years with helping flood and fire victims, poor and sick children at different times. His primary use of donations of food, household items, cash, medical bills and other donations go straight to impact the poor and victims of disaster in Ghana. In 2018, Mensah initiated the Save a Sick Child project in collaboration with paediatric medical doctors at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana where he made cash donations to cover the cost of surgeries on sick children who suffer a destruction of their food pipes in the throat as a result of accidental ingestion of caustic soda, a cheap raw material used for manufacturing soap in rural communities in Ghana. Doctors at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital have raised alarm over the increasing numbers of children of poor parents mostly from remote communities who have to feed through a tube connected through the stomach, until they are able to afford the cost of undergoing a medical surgery to repair the damaged food pipe. The expensive cost of the surgery has prevented many children from going to school as their lives are a daily struggle with difficulty in swallowing even saliva. Through the Save a sick child project, Mensah sponsored the treatment of an 11-year boy from Asankragwa in the western region of Ghana and an 8-year old boy from Wa in the Upper West region of Ghana. In 2017, After the Atomic Junction Gas Explosion in Accra, Ghana, Herbert Mensah led a charge to support victims and survivors through donations at the 37-military hospital in Accra. He also led some foreign companies operating in Ghana such as Conserveria Africana and Sunda International to make donations to victims of fire and flood disasters. In collaboration with the member of parliament for Ayawaso West Wuagon Hon. Emmanuel Kyeremanteng Agyarko, Mensah donated household consumable products to students of the university of Ghana whose hostels were caught in a gas explosion. In addition to supporting them, Herbert Mensah uses outdoor events such as mass keep-fit walks with survivors of disasters such as flood victims and gas explosion victims to raise awareness and remind Ghanaians of the need to avert future reoccurrence of such disasters. Mensah also has established a tradition of donations and support for Zongo communities especially in his home region of Ashanti where he often does occasional donations of food and other consumable items for poor muslim residents of Kumasi through the chief imam of the Kumasi central mosque. Herbert Mensah and others present a cheque to COVID-19 trust fund in Accra As part of the fight against the COVID-19 global health pandemic in Ghana, Mr. Mensah created an advocacy campaign to encourage several private business people and companies in Ghana to contribute money and personal protective equipment to complement the government effort to support poor people and health workers during lockdown. == References == http://ugbs.ug.edu.gh/news/msc-clinical-leadership-and-governance-class-hosts- mr-herbert-mensah# == External links == * Ghana Rugby Official Website * Ghana Rugby Facebook Group Category:Rugby union in Ghana Category:Rugby union officials Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Alumni of Achimota School ","title":"Herbert Mensah"},{"id":"46296311","text":"Susanne is a 1961 Swedish film directed by Elsa Colfach.Cinema of the World - Susanne 1961Bonniers litter√§ra magasin - Volume 29 - Page 531 Georg Vilhelm Svensson - 1960 \\"I fallet \\"Susanne\\" f√•r man antagligen veta vad doktor Colfach redan i ett bandat f√∂retal till filmen s√§ger, n√§mligen att den √§r en ...\\" ==References * Category:1961 films Category:Swedish films ","title":"Susanne (1961 film)"},{"id":"46296318","text":"WDY was an AM radio station located in Roselle Park, New Jersey, that was licensed to the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) from September 19, 1921 to February 20, 1923, although its broadcasting career only spanned the period from December 15, 1921 through February 17, 1922. Despite being short-lived, WDY was the first broadcasting station licensed in the state of New Jersey, and one of the first in the United States.\\"Statement of Orestes H. Caldwell- Resumed\\" (January 18, 1929), Hearings Before the Committee on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries on H. R. 15430, page 450. It also marked RCA's entrance into the broadcasting field, which the company would dominate in the U.S. for the next half century. ==History== Broadcasting development During World War I, civilian radio stations had been banned in the United States. After the end of the war, radio broadcasting, which had previously been done on a limited, mostly experimental basis, began to become better organized, and saw the entrance of major established corporations. In the New York City area, beginning in late 1919 the De Forest Radio Telephone Company transmitted a nightly news and entertainment broadcast over its experimental station, 2XG, located in the Highbridge section of the Bronx, in New York City. However, in early 1920 the local government Radio Inspector shut down 2XG's operation on technical grounds, and Lee de Forest responded by transferring his broadcasting efforts to station 6XC in San Francisco.Father of Radio by Lee de Forest, 1950, pages 350-351, 354-355. In early November 1920, the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company began operation of its first broadcasting station, KDKA, in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in order to promote the sale of radio receivers. Following that station's success, Westinghouse made plans to establish additional stations in major population centers. Establishment of WDY WDY's hexagonal studio, located at General Electric's Aldene plant in Roselle Park, New Jersey, 1922.\\"Radiophone Broadcasting Station WDY\\", Wireless Age, February 1922, pages 18-19. RCA, spurred by its then-General Manager David Sarnoff, was also keenly interested in the possibilities of radio broadcasting. On July 2, 1921 it operated a temporary station, WJY, located at Hoboken, New Jersey, to broadcast round-by-round the heavyweight prizefight between Jack Dempsey and Georges Carpentier. The company next worked to establish a more permanent presence, and on September 19, 1921 RCA was issued a license for WDY, with studio and transmitter located at General Electric's (GE) Aldene plant in Roselle Park, New Jersey, and transmitting on a wavelength of 360 meters (833 kHz).New Stations: Commercial Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, October 1, 1921, page 2. Limited Commercial license, serial #225, issued September 19, 1921 for three months. (At this time RCA was a GE subsidiary. The station call letters were randomly assigned and did not stand for anything.) Although it was announced that WDY would begin operations \\"around October 15\\",\\"Radiophone Broadcasting by Radio Corporation\\", Wireless Age, October 1921, page 20. the station's first broadcast wasn't aired until December 15, 1921. In the meantime, on September 29, 1921 Westinghouse was issued a license for its own broadcasting station, WJZ (now WABC), located at the company's manufacturing plant in Newark, New Jersey, which began regular operations in early October. WDY's primary staff consisted of manager J. Andrew White, who was also the editor of RCA's Wireless Age magazine, and engineer J. O. Smith, who acted as the station's main announcer. (White and Smith had also been the principal participants in the WJY broadcast). White took responsibility for procuring talent, which was largely drawn from New York City's Manhattan theater district. Two hurdles were the fact that performers were not paid in anything more tangible than a meal and publicity (sometimes including an effusive review in Wireless Age magazine), and they also had to be convinced to travel 16 miles (26 kilometers) from New York to perform in an industrial area with limited train service. The station facility, located in a converted machine room, was well-financed, and included a 500-watt transmitter constructed by GE engineers. WDY's hexagonal \\"artistically appointed studio\\" housed both the performers and the transmitting equipment, and was \\"furnished in blue and gold draperies; the carpets and rugs carry out the same color scheme. The color scheme is also carried further in the lighting arrangements, a large chandelier in the center of the studio giving a soft, mellow light to the whole place\\". Although WDY's license was issued first, it started broadcasting two months after WJZ commenced operations. Because both stations were assigned the same wavelength of 360 meters, they made an arrangement that WDY would broadcast on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday nights, with WJZ operating on the other four days of the week. WDY's divided its schedule into \\"vocal and instrumental selections by well known artists\\" on Mondays, \\"interpretive performances of the popular operas\\" on Wednesdays, and informal \\"party nights\\" on Fridays. Somewhat casual for the time, the station adopted the slogan \\"The Cute Castle of Cordiality\\".History of Radio to 1926 by Gleason L. Archer, 1938, page 220, quoting George H. Clark manuscript. The most famous performer to appear over WDY was showman Eddie Cantor, who made his radio debut at the station in early February 1922. Cantor was somewhat suspicious whether his performance, addressed toward a mute microphone, was actually being heard by anybody, so he asked listeners to send in dimes to be donated to charity. The response was enough to convince him about the effectiveness of the new medium.Archer (1938), page 220, quoting the March 3, 1934 New York Sun. Other prominent performers making their radio premiers included singer Aileen Stanley and actress Norma Shearer. Station shutdown  Although RCA had made a significant financial investment in establishing WDY, and its debut and ongoing operations were made with great fanfare, changes in the radio industry soon made the station redundant. RCA, formed in 1919, was originally a wholly owned GE subsidiary. However, on July 1, 1921 GE made an agreement with Westinghouse to cross-license radio patents, which gave Westinghouse 40% ownership of RCA, and also made RCA the sales agent for Westinghouse radio receivers.Big Business and Radio by Gleason L. Archer, 1939, page 7. Because these companies were now working together, there was no longer a need for both WDY and WJZ, moreover, WJZ was located closer to New York City and had been providing a greater variety of programs. The decision was made to shut down WDY, with RCA now contributing 50% toward WJZ's expenses. WDY made its final broadcast on February 17, 1922,\\"WDY to Discontinue Broadcasting\\" by Capt. Robert Scofield Wood, New York Evening World, February 16, 1922, page 19 (fultonhistory.com) as RCA announced it was combining its broadcasting activities with Westinghouse. A statement in the March 1922 issue of Wireless Age said that WDY's suspension was only temporary, with RCA preparing to reactivate the station \\"in the heart of New York City\\", moreover, \\"When WDY relocates to New York, WJZ will be silenced.\\"\\"WDY to Locate in New York\\", Wireless Age, March 1922, pages 35-36. However, WDY's license was quietly deleted on February 20, 1923,\\"Strike out all particulars\\", Radio Service Bulletin, March 1, 1923, page 6. and when RCA's New York City facility began operations on May 15, 1923, the station actually inherited the WJZ call sign. In retrospect, WDY was described as a \\"transition station, almost the equivalent of a tryout of a Broadway play in the provinces\\", which provided RCA with valuable experience as it developed its broadcasting services.Archer (1938), page 245, quoting George H. Clark manuscript. ==References== Category:1921 establishments in New Jersey Category:1923 disestablishments in New Jersey Category: Defunct radio stations in the United States Category:Roselle Park, New Jersey Category:Radio stations established in 1921 Category:Radio stations disestablished in 1923 Category:Radio stations in New Jersey DY ","title":"WDY"},{"id":"46296328","text":"The 1925 Paris‚ÄìRoubaix was the 26th edition of the Paris‚ÄìRoubaix, a classic one-day cycle race in France.

As with a number of Avercamp's works, the picture is part of the Flemish tradition of painting \\"the harmony of human activity and the cycle of nature\\". He was influenced in his subject by the Little Ice Age, particularly the cold winter of 1607‚Äì08, and was the first of the Dutch painters to specialise in snow scenes. The painting was acquired by the National Gallery in London in 1891 and remains in its collection, as at 2020. On acquisition it was square in shape, but during cleaning in 1983 it was established that Avercamp's original was circular, and the surrounding pieces were made by another artist. The gallery removed the additions. ==ReferencesSources== * * * Category:1600s paintings Category:Paintings by Hendrick Avercamp ","title":"A Winter Scene with Skaters near a Castle"},{"id":"46296350","text":"A Boy, a Girl and a Bike is a 1949 British romantic comedy film directed by Ralph Smart and starring John McCallum, Honor Blackman and Patrick Holt.Spicer p.214 The film's art direction was by George Provis.

It has been released through retail and on Steam on April 24, 2015. It is the sequel to Dungeons. == Gameplay == Dungeons 2 is a more direct homage to Dungeon Keeper than its predecessor. The player still takes on the role of the Ultimate Evil, but now as a disembodied spirit after his defeat by heroes of the Overworld. The player must rely on controlling minions with the Hand of Terror. Named minions are hired, and can be leveled up and trained to be more powerful. The player must meet the needs of the minions in order to keep them happy, or they may disobey commands. The player has to build the dungeon by selecting blocks for the minions to excavate. Rooms can be built onto empty spaces, but blocks can be filled back in as well to wall off an area. Some of the resources like gold and mana are hidden inside stone blocks while some walls cannot be excavated. A major change from Dungeons is that the Overworld can now be entered through the same cave exits used by heroes who raid the dungeon. Once on the Overworld, the game switches to a real-time strategy mode, allowing the player to command minions as they attack player holdings. The ultimate goal is usually the destruction of a castle, but there are other separate dungeons holding quests too. A sarcastic omnipresent narrator narrates the Ultimate Evil's acts of vengeance or inaction, in which case it pushes the player to the right path. Humorous references to games like Dungeon Keeper, Warcraft, and fantasy series like Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones are commonplace. == Plot == The story line evolves around the Absolute Evil, fed up with the heroes of the Overworld constantly abusing his minions for experience points and stealing his gold, heads to the surface. Easily conquering the castle, the Evil is ambushed by the assembled heroes of the land and divided into three aspects(the Ultimate Evil, the Chaotic Evil, the Corrupting Evil). Decades later, one of the Absolute Evil's aspects, the Ultimate Evil awakens as a ghostly incorporeal version of himself, and with the aid of loyal minions, starts to rebuild his empire. On the way to punish the individual heroes and gain the alliance of other races, the Ultimate Evil learns of another faction fighting both the heroes and his own empire, the Demons led by the Chaotic Evil. Also appearing and sometimes hindering or helping the Evil are the undead and their enigmatic leader, the Corrupting Evil. The Corrupting Evil is also awakened by absorbing life of Barthas Snow, and leads undead army. The evil prophet leads three Evils to the Stones of Destiny and says that three Evils must be reunited as the Absolute Evil. The Corrupting Evil uses Barthas Snow as sacrifice for ritual of reunifying three Evils and the Absolute Evil is revived. The army of three evils is allied under the control of the Absolute Evil and they totally erase remnants of the Alliance. == Chaotic Evil == The Chaotic Evil is the Ultimate Evil's archenemy and one of the Absolute Evil's aspects. The player must rely on controlling minions with the Hand of Chaos. Named minions can be hired, levelled up and trained to be more powerful. The player must meet the needs of the minions in order to keep them happy, or they may disobey commands. Unlike the Ultimate Evil, Demons rely on magic (the horde relies on strength.) In campaign there are a few levels where the player can control the Demons, though in multiplayer there is always the option of using Demons (The Hand of Chaos controls the demons, as the Hand of Terror controls the Horde). ==Reception== Dungeons 2 received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic. == Sequel == Dungeons 3 is the sequel to Dungeons 2.

The main route has now been replaced by part of the South Eastern Freeway, but most of it remains in some form. The remaining sections of Mount Barker Road are still classified as state roads. ==Route== Mount Barker Road starts from the \\"Old Toll Gate\\" at Glen Osmond. It has been completely replaced by the South Eastern Freeway as far as the Devil's Elbow. Mount Barker Road turns a sharp hairpin and has a winding uphill through Eagle On The Hill and rejoins the South Eastern Freeway near Measday's Hill. Mount Barker Road resumes from the south side of the Stirling exit from the freeway. It passes through the main shopping strips of Stirling and Aldgate as State Route B33. From Aldgate, Route B33 continues on Strathalbyn Road, while Mount Barker Road follows the railway line as Tourist Route 57 to Bridgewater and under the freeway at Verdun where it joins State Route B34 (from Onkaparinga Valley Road) for a little over through Hahndorf. At the south end of Hahndorf Route B34 turns under the freeway towards Echunga and Mount Barker Road continues on the north side to end at the Mount Barker Interchange. ==History== Mount Barker Road in 1900 The last part of the South Eastern Freeway to be built reconstructed the Adelaide end of Mount Barker Road including a grade-separated intersection at Mount Osmond Road. It replaced the infamous Devil's Elbow hairpin with a partial interchange. The new freeway passes through the Heysen Tunnels and rejoins the former alignment the other side of a steep ridge. Mount Barker Road itself climbs over and around the ridge. Since the four-lane dual carriageway is no longer required, part of the uphill side has been replaced with a bike path used as part of a popular cycling route to Mount Lofty and all motor traffic uses the former downhill carriageway. The section between the Measdays interchange and Crafers was also completely replaced by the freeway being built on the same alignment at a lower level in a deep cutting. Mount Barker Road between Crafers and Stirling was replaced by the first stage of the Freeway to be built, in the late 1960s. Mount Barker Road remains as the main street of Stirling, continuing to Aldgate, Bridgewater, under the freeway at Verdun, then through Hahndorf to end near the Mount Barker interchange of the freeway. The road on the other end of the bridge over the interchange is \\"Adelaide Road\\", reflecting the reverse journey. The Toll House In 1841 a special Act \\"... for the making, and maintaining the Great Eastern Road\\" was passed, and construction of the first section from Glen Osmond to Crafers begun at public expense. It was soon realised that this undertaking would be hugely expensive, so a novel (for the day) plan was hatched to relieve the Government of all expense by vesting the management of the road in a private company. The successful tenderer would have the responsibility of completing and maintaining the road, and have the right to levy tolls on users of the road. As this was the only route to and from the burgeoning agricultural districts around Mount Barker, not to mention all road traffic to the eastern colonies, this had all the hallmarks of a great money- maker. The author of The History and Topology of Glen Osmond, Under-Treasurer Tom Gill, no stranger to public finances, described this a 'curiosity in road legislation'. A toll gate and accommodation for the gate-keeper were erected and one Samuel Selby appointed keeper of the toll-bar, which was to be staffed 24 hours, seven days a week. The tolls levied were: ‚Äî :For every coach, chariot, chaise, gig, hearse, caravan, or other carriage, and every cart, wagon, dray, or other vehicle, if drawn by one horse or two bullocks, 1/. :'For 'such carriage or vehicle' drawn by two horses or four bullocks, 1/6; by four horses or six bullocks, 2/; by six or more horses, or eight or more' bullocks, 3/; :by one pony, mule, or ass not exceeding 13 hands high, 6d.; by two or more such ponies,' mules, or asses, 1/; for every saddle or led horse, mule, or ass, 6d.; for horses, mules, asses, oxen, cows, or other neat cattle driven, per head 1d.; and for sheep, lambs, calves, dogs, swine, or goats driven, each ¬Ωd. :Only one full toll in any one day might be demanded for any animal or vehicle, except stage coaches or carriages plying for hire. :Exempt from payment were: the Governor, survey, and police, also agricultural produce not bought or sold, but going to be sold or disposed of, also persons travelling to and from Divine Service on Sundays. The tolls were vexatious and led to a great deal of ill-feeling and were abolished in 1847 by the Legislative Council on the motion of Samuel Davenport. The company failed to reap the rewards anticipated, partly on account of the increased cost of labour as a result of the exodus of able-bodied men to the Victorian goldfields. facsimile pub.

The militant group and Al-Qaeda offshoot, Al-Shabaab, which the gunmen claimed to be from, took responsibility for the attack. The gunmen took over 700 students hostage, freeing Muslims and killing those who identified as Christians. The siege ended the same day, when all four of the attackers were killed. Five men were later arrested in connection with the attack, and a bounty was placed for the arrest of a suspected organizer. The attack was the deadliest in Kenya since the 1998 United States embassy bombings, and is the second deadliest overall, with more casualties than the 2002 Mombasa attacks, the 2013 Westgate shopping mall attack, the 2014 Nairobi bus bombings, the 2014 Gikomba bombings, the 2014 Mpeketoni attacks and the 2014 Lamu attacks. == Background == Garissa, in the North Eastern Province around 200 km from the border with Somalia, was considered as \\"one of the safest spots in the region.\\" It housed both military barracks and police headquarters. Al-Shabaab, a multi-ethnic militant group based in Somalia with links to Al-Qaeda, had killed over 200 people in Kenya in the two years prior to the event, in attacks like the 2013 Westgate shopping mall shooting. These attacks significantly affected Kenya's tourism industry, although prior to Al-Shabaab's existence, the 2002 Mombasa attacks also targeted tourists. Previously, many of the militant group's attacks were outside major urban population centers. Diplomats and analysts had also criticized the Kenyan security forces' policing strategy, which they described as heavy-handed and which involved indiscriminate mass arrests of resident Somalis. They further warned that such sweeping tactics would only result in creating resentment among Muslims, thereby providing Al-Shabaab with an opportunity to capitalize on the situation. It was reported that there had been \\"high-profile warnings about a threat to a major university\\" prior to the attack. Grace Kai, a student at a nearby college, said that \\"strangers had been spotted in Garissa town and were suspected to be terrorists\\", and then \\"on Monday [30 March 2015] our college principal told us‚Ä¶ that strangers had been spotted in our college\\"; on Tuesday, while the college closed and sent its students home, the university which remained open was attacked. The attack came a day after the Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta had chastised the United Kingdom and Australia for renewing their travel warnings over security threats in Kenya, and accused them of perpetuating colonialism. == Attack and hostage- taking == The attack started at around 05:30 am local time. Two unarmed guards were killed at the entrance. 20 students were rescued by soldiers, including Collins Wetangula, who described the presence of at least five masked, armed gunmen, as well as Christians being \\"shot on the spot\\". Other survivors indicated that the shooters had summoned the pupils to get out of their bedrooms in the dormitory and to position themselves face-down on the ground, but then executed the students. The Kenya Defence Forces and other security agencies were deployed. They surrounded and sealed off the university to flush out the gunmen, with the Interior Ministry and Kenya National Disaster Operation Centre reporting that three out of four dormitories had been evacuated. Michael Bwana, another student who fled, said that \\"most of the people still inside there are girls\\", in reference to the remaining student dormitory where the gunmen were believed to be hiding. The siege ended after nearly 15 hours, with four gunmen killed just after dusk. The masked attackers wielded AK-47s and were strapped with explosives. Four of the terrorists were shot by the Recce Squad Commandos of the Kenyan GSU. The fifth terrorist was able to detonate his suicide vest causing injuries to some of the commandos. Of the 148 dead, 142 were students, 3 were soldiers and 3 were police officers. Around 587 students escaped, but 79 were injured. Authorities said all students have since been accounted for. == Perpetrators and motive == A student survivor said that the gunmen spoke in Swahili, and asserted that they were associated with the Al-Shabaab group. The group later claimed responsibility for the attack. A spokesman for the group, Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage, said regarding the situation that \\"when our men arrived, they released the Muslims\\", but were holding Christians hostage. Rage also stated that his men's \\"mission is to kill those who are against the Shabab\\", and that \\"Kenya is at war with Somalia\\" in reference to the deployment of Kenyan troops in the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM). Another spokesman asserted that Al- Shabaab attacked the institution because it was \\"on Muslim land colonized by non-Muslims\\". One suspected attacker was arrested while fleeing the area during the siege. After the siege ended, two more suspected attackers were found on the campus and arrested, one of whom was Tanzanian and had no connections to the university. British born Jihadist Samantha Lewthwaite was, at one point, believed by some to have masterminded the attack.\\"White Widow Samantha Lewthwaite 'has killed 400 people in reign of terror against the west\\", Daily Mirror, 17 May 2015 The Kenyan government named a citizen of Somali origin Mohamed Kuno (alias Sheikh Mohamed Dulayadayn, Gamadhere, or Mohamed Mohamud) as the mastermind behind the attack, and offered a 20 million Kenyan shillings ($215,000) reward for his arrest. From 1993 to 1995, Mohamud had worked at the Al-Haramain Foundation, and later taught and became the principal of the Madrasa Najah school in Garissa until 2007 He later crossed into Somalia to join the Union of Islamic Courts and then Hizbul Islam, which merged with Al-Shabaab in 2010. The local media had associated Mohamud with two separate Al-Shabaab attacks in 2014 in the Mandera area. On 4 April, Al- Shabaab issued a statement in English aimed at the Kenyan public. The emailed message denounced what it described as \\"unspeakable atrocities against the Muslims of East Africa\\" by Kenyan security forces, both in the predominantly ethnic Somali-inhabited North Eastern Province and in southern Somalia, where Kenyan forces had been deployed as part of AMISOM. The militant group indicated that the Garissa shooters wanted to \\"avenge the deaths of thousands of Muslims killed at the hands of the Kenyan security forces.\\" In further retaliation, Al-Shabaab declared that \\"Kenyan cities will run red with blood\\" and vowed that it would \\"stop at nothing to avenge the deaths of our Muslim brothers until your government ceases its oppression and until all Muslim lands are liberated from Kenyan occupation.\\" The group also warned the Kenyan public that it would target them in their workplaces, residences, schools and universities for \\"condoning your government's oppressive policies by failing to speak out against them\\" and for \\"reinforcing their policies by electing them.\\" On 4 April, the Interior Ministry of Kenya announced that five men suspected of involvement in the attack had been apprehended. Three of the individuals, Kenyan citizens of Somali origin, were believed to have been the organizers. They were intercepted as they were attempting to enter Somalia. One of the men, Mohammed Abdirahim Abdullahi (aged 24), was reportedly the son of Bulla Jamhuri chief Abdullahi Daqare in Mandera County. The other individual was a security guard at the university; also a Kenyan citizen of Somali origin, he was thought to have facilitated entry into the institution. The last suspect, a Tanzanian named Rashid Charles Mberesero, was suspected of having been among the gunmen. He was reportedly found hiding in the ceiling and was carrying ammunition. Kenyan police were also searching for a close associate of Abdullahi's, who had received training with him in Somalia and later left for Yemen to reach Syria. In June 2016, Mohamed Kuno, who led the attack was killed by regional forces in Somalia during a raid on a convoy in Kismayo, Somalia. Mberesero, Mohamed Ali Abikar and Hassan Edin Hassan were charged with conspiracy to commit the attack and of belonging to Al-Shabaab. In June 2019, four years after the attack, they were found guilty, while Sahal Diriye Hussein, also charged, was acquitted. ==Reactions== The United Nations Security Council strongly condemned the attack in Garissa, stressing the need to bring to justice perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of what they termed as \\"reprehensible acts of terrorism\\", urging all states to cooperate with Kenyan authorities in the aftermath of the attack. The United States, through its embassy in Nairobi, issued a statement strongly condemning the attack and extending condolences to all who were affected. President Barack Obama, who visited Kenya in July 2015, expressed horror and sadness at the reports that students were killed in the attack, adding that \\"the Kenyan people should know they have an unwavering friend and ally in the United States of America\\". The British High Commission, which had issued an extended travel advisory covering Kenya at large, advised against all but essential travel to within of the Coast Region. In the aftermath of the attack, the UK's Minister for Africa James Duddridge strongly condemned the attack, offering condolences to the families and loved ones of those who died. Abdullahi Halakhe, a researcher with the Kenyan Amnesty International, suggested that the attack was not so much a reflection of Al-Shabaab's strength, but instead of the Kenyan government's incompetence. He also noted that the militant group was probably at its weakest point since 2006.Higgins, Abigail and Starkey. Jerome (6 April 2015) Kenya bombs Somalia to avenge campus massacre The Times, (may require a subscription), Retrieved 6 April 2015 A Kenyan social media campaign on Twitter encouraged the use of the hashtag #147notjustanumber to humanize the victims, along with photos and names of those who had died in the attack. In an effort to make sure each student was honoured, a public Google document was also created. ==Aftermath== Nightly curfews from 18:30 to 6:30 were imposed until 16 April in Garissa and three other counties (Wajir, Mandera and Tana River) near the North Eastern Province's border with Somalia. The chairman of the Garissa Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims, Abdullahi Saalat, suggested that the Kenyan police were using the curfew as a pretext to harass residents, especially Muslims. He asserted that most Muslims had consequently chosen to remain in their houses. The coordinator for the Northern Forum for Democracy, Khalif Farah, likewise argued that the curfew would ultimately not help strengthen security because similar curfews that had been imposed in the past were ineffectual. He also suggested that the Kenya Police itself was the source of much of the insecurity, and indicated that rogue police officers had begun rounding up youth and were seeking bribes of 50 Ksh and upwards for their release. Defence Cabinet Secretary Raychelle Omamo announced that the government would cover the funeral expenses, and that the families of the victims would be distributed 100,000 Ksh. Education CS Jacob Kaimenyi also indicated that the university had been closed indefinitely, and that the students who had survived the shooting did not wish to return. The Kenyan authorities published a gazette notice listing Al- Shabaab and the Mombasa Republican Council separatist group as two of several terrorist organizations with operations in Kenya. The Central Bank of Kenya also reportedly suspended the licenses of 13 Somali-owned money transfer companies. An owner of one of these firms indicated that the companies were not suspended, but instead had had their licenses revoked without explanation. Additionally, the Kenyan government froze the bank accounts of 86 individuals and entities it alleged were associated with Al-Shabaab. The Kenyan government also called for the closure of the nearby Dadaab refugee camps, for fear that Al-Shabaab was using it as recruiting grounds for new members. Their initial three month ultimatum was later relaxed, and the repatriation of refugees is currently voluntary, not enforced. Former Prime Minister of Kenya Raila Odinga, former Kenyan Minister of Trade Moses Wetangula, and other members of the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) called for an immediate withdrawal of Kenyan troops from Somalia. Wetangula also recommended that the Kenyan government cut its military budget in half, and reallocate the slashed funds toward strengthening internal security. Additionally, Odinga accused Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta of conceitedness for having dismissed intelligence alerts of potential attacks issued by foreign nations. Ten days after the shootings, an explosion of a power transformer outside the student hostel at the University of Nairobi sent pupils panicking in fear of another attack. Some students jumped out of windows, and the ensuing stampede left one person dead. Around 150 pupils sustained minor injuries, and 20 individuals received treatment at the hospital. It was later established that the blast had been caused by an ordinary electrical fault. Over the following weeks, 96 of the 150 primary and secondary schools in Garissa County closed over security fears, as many teachers have refused to return to work. Primary schools have been particularly badly affected by these closures. In 2019, three Islamist militants, Kenyan citizens Mohammed Ali Abikar and Hassan Edin Hassan and Tanzanian citizen Rashid Charles Mberesero, were convicted for their role in the attack. Abikar and Hassan received 41-year prison sentences while Mberesero was sentenced to life in prison.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48859937 ==See also== *Terrorism in Kenya *List of hostage crises *List of Islamist terrorist attacks *Garissa Massacre ==References== Category:2015 crimes in Kenya Category:Al-Shabaab (militant group) attacks Category:Attacks in 2015 Category:Attacks on schools in Africa Category:Deaths by firearm in Kenya Category:Education in Kenya Category:Garissa Category:Garissa University College Category:Islamic terrorism in Kenya Category:Mass murder in 2015 Category:Mass shootings in Africa Category:Massacres in Kenya Category:School bombings Category:School massacres Category:Terrorist incidents in Africa in 2015 Category:Terrorist incidents in Kenya Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in 2015 Category:April 2015 events in Africa Category:April 2015 crimes Category:2010s murders in Kenya Category:Terrorist incidents in Kenya in the 2010s ","title":"Garissa University College attack"},{"id":"46296528","text":"This is a list of pizza restaurant franchises.

Known for its distinctive English Queen Anne terracotta facade, the building was originally developed as an apartment building by brothers James J. Goodwin and Rev. Francis Goodwin and opened in 1881. It was designed by Francis Kimball and was modeled on buildings Rev. Goodwin had seen being constructed at the time in England. Kimball, of the firm of Kimball & Wisedell, was the architect for the Day House in Hartford, which also has an English Queen Anne design. The Goodwin Building was expanded in 1891 to Ann Street and in 1900 to Pearl Street. It was a very prestigious address at the time, with even J.P. Morgan living there during his visits to the city of his birth. In 1985-1986, the building's Arts and Crafts style interior was gutted to prepare for the structure's incorporation into a new office tower, Goodwin Square, completed in 1989. The facade was preserved, incorporated into the 1980s Goodwin Square office tower built within the original building's footprint. It is the anchor structure within a National Register of Historic Places historic district that includes three adjoining buildings from the same time period.\\"Goodwin Building\\", NRHP Listing No. 76001990 That same year, the Goodwin Hotel opened in the former apartment building.

The building's owners hoped to lease it to another operator for as little as $1 a year to keep the historical inn open, but no deal could be reached. The doors initially had to be chained shut, as they had never needed to be locked for the previous 19 years.

Only the bell tower, adorned by a double row of mullioned windows, remains of the original medieval structure; the body of the church was rebuilt in the 16th century.

In this case the card is inscribed with a location, date, and signature; but is un-numbered. The Committee of American Students of the School of Beaux-Arts, Paris (Comit√© des √âtudiants Am√©ricains de l'√âcole des Beaux-Arts Paris [C.E.A. √† l'E.D.B.A.]) was an organization of American art students at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. American alumni of the school were also involved. It was active as a war and war-relief charity supporting the French cause during World War I, operating from at least 1916 through the end of the war. Among other activities, they raised funds through the production and sale of art-postcards. ==Overview== The Comit√© des √âtudiants Am√©ricains de l'√âcole des Beaux-Arts Paris, an organization of American art students at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, was set up as a war and war- relief charity in support of the French cause in the First World War; operating from at least 1916 to early 1919. American alumni of the school were also involved. The group was strongly Francophile. A primary focus of their charitable activities was providing help to fellow art students who were serving in the armed forces, and to those students' families. They also supported other efforts, including more directly military causes. The committee raised funds by organizing the production, exhibition, and sale of art-postcards. These were created variously, by an array of professional French artists as well as by art students. Later, they also published a periodical; the Gazette de l'Ecole des Beaux-Arts. The group had other sources of funding as well. In addition to their charitable activities, and fund- raising for those activities, the group's efforts and products helped to express and promote sympathy for France (and occupied Belgium) during the war; particularly among Americans. This was one of many efforts by Francophile Americans in France and the United States in support of the French and Allied cause; both before and after their own country entered the war. Notable American architect and √âcole des Beaux-Arts alumnus Whitney Warren was one of the organization's founders. Another key organizer was (Frank) Ronald Simmons (1885-1918), the son of a wealthy Rhode Island industrialist, who became a very close friend of Edith Wharton. After his sudden death from influenza, he became the basis for the character of \\"Boylston\\" in her War novel \\"A Son at the Front\\" (written in 1919, published in 1923). War charity work, and the involvement of Americans in it, are mentioned; but the Comit√© is not described specifically, by name. The American journalist Richard Harding Davis (1864-1916) included the following piece about the group in his wartime book With The French In France And Salonika (1916), as part of chapter XI. Hints for Those Who Want To Help. \\"There are some other very good bargains. Are you a lover of art, and would you become a patron of art? If that is your wish, you can buy an original water-color for fifty cents, and so help an art student who is fighting at the front, and assist in keeping alive his family in Paris. Is not that a good bargain? As everybody knows, the √âcole des Beaux- Arts in Paris is free to students from all the world. It is the alma mater of some of the best-known American artists and architects. On its rolls are the names of Sargent, St. Gaudens, Stanford White, Whitney Warren, Beckwith, Coffin, MacMonnies. Certain schools and colleges are so fortunate as to inspire great devotion on the part of their students, as, in the story told of every college, of the student being led from the football field, who struggles in front of the grand stand and shouts: \\"Let me go back. I'd die for dear old ‚Äî‚Äî\\" But the affection of the students of the Beaux-Arts for their masters, their fellow students and the institution is very genuine. They do not speak of the distinguished artists, architects, engravers, and sculptors who instruct them as \\"Doc,\\" or \\"Prof.\\" Instead they call him \\"master,\\" and no matter how often they say it, they say it each time as though they meant it. The American students, even when they return to Paris rich and famous, go at once to call upon the former master of their atelier, who, it may be, is not at all famous or rich, and pay their respects. And, no matter if his school of art has passed, and the torch he carried is in the hands of younger Frenchmen, his former pupils still salute him as master, and with much the same awe as the village cur√© shows for the cardinal. When the war came 3,000 of the French students of the Beaux-Arts, past and present, were sent to the front, and there was no one to look after their parents, families, or themselves, it seemed a chance for Americans to try to pay back some of the debt so many generations of American artists, architects, and sculptors owed to the art of France. Whitney Warren, the American architect, is one of the few Americans who, in spite of the extreme unpopularity of our people, is still regarded by the French with genuine affection. And in every way possible he tries to show the French that it is not the American people who are neutral, but the American Government. One of the ways he offers to Americans to prove their friendship for France is in helping the students of the Beaux-Arts. He has organized a committee of French and American students which works twelve hours a day in the palace of the Beaux-Arts itself, on the left bank of the Seine. It is hard to understand how in such surroundings they work, not all day, but at all. The rooms were decorated in the time of the first Napoleon; the ceilings and walls are white and gold, and in them are inserted paintings and panels. The windows look into formal gardens and courts filled with marble statues and busts, bronze medallions and copies of frescoes brought from Athens and Rome. In this atmosphere the students bang typewriters, fold blankets, nail boxes, sort out woollen (sic) gloves, cigarettes, loaves of bread, and masks against asphyxiating gas. The mask they send to the front was invented by Francis Jacques, of Harvard, one of the committee, and has been approved by the French Government. There is a department which sends out packages to the soldiers in the trenches, to those who are prisoners, and to the soldiers in the hospitals. There is a system of demand cards on which is a list of what the committee is able to supply. In the trenches the men mark the particular thing they want and return the card. The things most in demand seem to be corn-cob pipes and tobacco from America, sketch-books, and small boxes of water-colors. The committee also edits and prints a monthly magazine. It is sent to those at the front, and gives them news of their fellow students, and is illustrated, it is not necessary to add, with remarkable talent and humor. It is printed by hand. The committee also supplies the students with post- cards on which the students paint pictures in water-colors and sign them. Every student and ex-student, even the masters paint these pictures. Some of them are very valuable. At two francs fifty centimes the autograph alone is a bargain. In many cases your fifty cents will not only make you a patron of art, but it may feed a very hungry family.

There were very likely associations of American students at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, both before and after the war, who may have used the same, or similar, names. There were certainly other associations of American students at various schools throughout France, many of whom participated in efforts to help the French cause in various ways, during the war. Also, there were myriad other \\"Comit√©s\\". Additionally, student organizations frequently published periodicals, and the term \\"gazette\\" was not uncommon in the titles of these publications. That said, the Comit√© des √âtudiants Am√©ricains de l'√âcole des Beaux-Arts Paris which was active during World War I was a specific organization run by a specific group of people, that engaged in particular activities in charity and the arts during the war; and it has left behind an artistic \\"body of work(s)\\" relevant to the period. ==Postcards== A Comit√© des √âtudiants Am√©ricains de l'√âcole des Beaux-Arts Paris exhibition. Probably at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, Paris, circa 1918.thumb300pxThe committee of students raised funds by organizing the production, exhibition, and sale of art-postcards; created by professional French artists, as well as by students. Production of the cards began in 1916, and continued through the end of the war. Their postcards covered a range of subjects; from war scenes and war ruins, to typical tourist views, and sometimes other types of artistic images, in a variety of styles. The levels of effort, detail, technical skill, and artistic merit shown in the cards varies widely. Some of them are highly finished, others are more like rough \\"sketches\\"; although the tendency is for the post cards to be \\"ready and presentable for sale\\", as suits their intended purpose. The works include original drawings and paintings, as well as low-volume printed-works such as engravings, etchings, etc. For the most part, it's clear that they have been created by professionally trained artists, of the French school, and of the period. The Comit√© post cards are typically signed by the artist, often with a date, and usually included some description of the subject. The backs of the postcards are marked with a printed inscription \\"The Comit√© des √âtudiants Am√©ricains de l'√âcole des Beaux-Arts Paris guarantee the authenticity of this post card\\". Most of the cards have a specific and fairly elabourate printed design on the reverse side, which includes graphical elements as well as the inscription. These card-backs are monochrome-printed in coloured ink; ink colours ranging from rusty-brown to yellow-orange were used. The design is signed at the bottom-centre, to the left of the canon, but the name tends to be illegible; possibly it is Rene Jaudon, who entered the Beaux-Arts at Paris in 1910. The pattern was, however, unsuitable for postal use in that it did not conform to international standards for postcard formats. Sometimes the word \\"picture\\" is used instead of \\"post card\\" on these card-backs, possibly as a late variant. Many, but not all, of the cards were hand-numbered on the back in what appears to be a straightforward numerical count. Based on the numbers and dates of known examples, and assuming the numbering is by a simple-count system, the total number of postcards created was probably around 40,000. After the war, at least 1 book was published showing a selection of the best postcards produced by the Comit√©, as determined by the book's editors (bibliographical information is pending). The New Mexico State University Library Archives and Special Collections has an album of 398 of the group's postcards in their collection; this material is not presently available online (as of 2020), however a guide to the collection can be found online . A few of the postcards are also listed in the archive collections of other public institutions.

It was offered for sale by subscription, and may have been provided free of charge to serving students/alumni. The Gazette served as a means to inform students who had been mobilised, of school activities and relevant news; as well as providing another source of fund-raising for the group. The Comit√© also helped and inspired student groups at other French arts-schools to produce similar wartime publications. From the limited information available, the start-date, end-date, and number of editions produced are unknown; as are the quantities printed. The one example found online is the edition of October‚ÄìNovember-December 1918, produced in January 1919. The Gazette was published in French, book-style, in a 2-column format; with professional newspaper-quality printing in black ink, on what looks like unfinished (i.e.: no coating, glossy or satin) paper of a fairly heavy grade of slightly rough newsprint. This volume has about 41 printed pages, with some blanks at the end. Aside from the cover illustration (drawing) and some minor decorations around the text on a few pages, and 1 page (single-side, on glossy paper) of black & white photographs, the rest of the material is entirely in text-form. It includes a notice-page of deaths, promotions, etc. of students/alumni serving in the military; articles about the war; news of the school; news & information of interest to art-professionals; and some pieces relating to student-politics. The general tone is patriotic, and generally uncritical of the war as conducted by the French government. There is no inclusion of pacifist material, and only limited representation of leftist views; nothing \\"revolutionary\\", pro-communist, or otherwise hard-core \\"Red\\". As the single example of the gazette presently available, when preparing this article, and as an edition produced after the French & Allied victory in the War, it is difficult to judge how representative of the rest of the series this particular volume is. ==See also== *American Committee for Devastated France *World War I in art and literature ==References== Unannotated references *Europeana1914-1918.eu **http://www.worldcat.org/title/bulletin/oclc/50131076&referer;=brief_results *Albright, Alan. \\"Notable American Volunteers of the Great War.\\" WWI WWW. n.p., n.d.

It is located at 33 Lawrence Avenue, in an architecturally distinguished Romanesque Revival building designed by William R. Miller and completed in 1901. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. ==Architecture and history== The library is set on the south side of Lawrence Street, in a residential area a short way west of Fairfield's central business district. It is a roughly rectangular structure, two stories in height, with a slate hip roof and walls of slate and granite. Its main facade, facing north, is divided into four sections. The outer two sections each consist of three round-arch openings, the arches prominently formed out of light granite, with windows set in them. The center-left bay houses the main entrance, which is set in a large round arch, and is topped by large, slightly projecting, gabled dormer section which houses three smaller round-arch windows, a granite crest bearing the construction date (1900), and a panel naming the building. The bay to the right has a projecting polygonal tower capped by a turreted roof. The first level of the tower has single round-arch windows, while the second has smaller paired round-arch windows. Belt courses of light granite extend across the facade at several levels, contrasting the verticality of the windows. Fairfield's library was established in 1895 by the local Ladies Book Club, with 48 volumes placed in a local shop. The library grew rapidly, highlighting the need for a permanent home. Edward J. Lawrence, owner of a local sawmill, donated $15,000 for the construction of the building, which was designed by Lewiston architect William R. Miller, and built in 1900-01 on land donated by Mrs. L. E. Newhall; both Lawrence and Newhall also donated funds to further increase the collection. Miller was a well-known architect with a practice that extended across central Maine; his design, while clearly based on the innovations of architect H. H. Richardson in the style and function of libraries, also exhibits some Beaux Arts features then coming into vogue. The building has been remarkably unaltered since its construction, retaining the original uses of the three-part layout of the first floor (reading room, circulation area, stacks) with storage on the second level. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Somerset County, Maine ==References *Lawrence Library web site Category:Romanesque Revival architecture in Maine Category:Library buildings completed in 1901 Category:Public libraries in Maine Category:Libraries on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Libraries in Somerset County, Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in Somerset County, Maine ","title":"Lawrence Library"},{"id":"46296602","text":"Catherine Redgwell is Chichele Professor of Public International Law and fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, and Co-Director of the Oxford Geoengineering Programme of the Oxford Martin School.

The film is a remake of the 2013 Malayalam-language film of the same name. The film was jointly produced by Kumar Mangat Pathak, Ajit Andhare and Abhishek Pathak. It stars Ajay Devgn, Tabu and Shriya Saran, and also features Ishita Dutta and Mrunal Jadhav. The film was theatrically released in India on 31 July 2015. It grossed in India and a worldwide total of worldwide. The cost of production plus print and advertising costs totalled . == Plot== The movie starts with a new policeman in town asking joining the police force in the newly built police station in town. While walking through the station with a constable, he notices a man named Vijay Salgaonkar sitting at one far end. The newly joined policeman asks whether that is Vijay Salgaonkar to which the constable replies yes. The film then goes into a flashback. Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn) is an orphan who dropped out of school after his 4th grade. Now he is a content businessman running a cable TV service in Goa. He is married to Nandini (Shriya Saran), and have Anju, his adopted daughter (Ishita Dutta), a class twelve student, and Anu (Mrunal Jadhav), a class six student. His only interest is watching films. He has gained fame in his area for helping people out with the help of methods he learns from films. During a nature camp which Anju (Vijay's daughter) attends, a hidden cell phone camera records Anju removing her clothes and showering in the bathroom. The culprit, Sameer \\"Sam\\" Deshmukh (Rishab Chaddha), is the son of Inspector General of Goa Police, Meera Deshmukh (Tabu). Sam comes to blackmail Anju for sexual favors. Nandini pleads with Sam to leave their family alone, but Sam refuses to delete the video clip unless his sexual demand is fulfilled. Nandini begs him to leave Anju alone, and Sam says that he would do it on one condition: Nandini should have sex with him instead. In an attempt to break the offending cell phone, Anju takes a swing at Sam with a lead pipe, but she strikes him in the head instead, killing him immediately. They bury his body in a compost pit in the backyard, which is witnessed by Anu. In the morning, when Vijay returns from work, Nandini tells Vijay about the incident and he devises a way to save his family from the police. He removes the broken cell phone and disposes of Sam's car, which is seen by the corrupt Sub-inspector Laxmikant Gaitonde (Kamlesh Sawant), who has a grudge against Vijay. The next day, Vijay takes his family out on a trip to Panjim, where they visit an Ashram, watch a movie, and eat at a restaurant. Meera, realizing that her son has gone missing, starts an investigation. After a preliminary investigation, Meera calls Vijay and family for questioning. Having predicted that the police would come calling eventually, Vijay coaches his family on how to face the interrogations without raising suspicion. When questioned individually, the family sticks to their individual stories and the police are unable to find a crack in their alibis. Vijay produces bus tickets, movie tickets, lodging and restaurant bills as proof for the family's visit to Panjim. Meera questions the owners of the establishments they have been to and their statements prove Vijay's alibi. Meera realizes that on the day of the incident, Vijay had taken the tickets and the bill, made acquaintance with the owners and had gone for the trip with his family the next day, thus proving his alibi and making the owners unwittingly tell the lie. Meera has the Salgaonkar family arrested, and Gaitonde uses brute force to beat the truth out of them though Vijay, Nandini and Anju resist. Meanwhile, Meera finds out about Sam and his video of Anju from Sam's friend, Alex. Eventually, Anu gives in and reveals that she has seen a body being buried in the compost pit. After digging the compost pit, the authorities find the carcass of a dog. Vijay reports to the media that Gaitonde physically abused both his daughters, causing an angry Gaitonde to attempt an attack on Vijay, but Vijay's in-laws retaliate, and a mob rises up to beat up Gaitonde. The Sub-inspector is suspended, Meera resigns from her post, and the entire investigating team of the Police Station is transferred out, with the case now requiring authorization from the court. When Nandini asks Vijay about what he did to the body, he refuses to tell her, saying that the information is safe with him and that it will go with him when he dies. Meera and her husband Mahesh (Rajat Kapoor) meet Vijay at a seaside to ask forgiveness for the video clip and their son's rude and pervert behavior, and to get a confirmation whether their son is alive or not. They also reveal that they would be leaving for London to live with Meera's brother. Finally, Vijay cryptically confesses to killing Sam. He also asks for forgiveness, and explains to them that he would go to any lengths to protect his family. At the end, which was the starting of the movie, Vijay signs the register in the newly constructed police station. While signing, the new inspector tells him that he can't fool them, at which point Vijay says that the police are only meant to protect the citizens. A small flashback reveals that Vijay hid the body in the newly constructed police station while it was under construction, as no one would think of looking there. == Cast == * Ajay Devgn as Vijay Salgaonkar, Owner of Mirage Cable Network * Tabu as Inspector General Meera Deshmukh * Shriya Saran as Nandini Salgaonkar, Vijay's wife * Ishita Dutta as Anju Salgaonkar, Vijay and Nandini's adopted and elder daughter * Mrinal Jadhav as Anu Salgaonkar, Vijay and Nandini's younger daughter * Kamlesh Sawant as Sub-inspector Laxmikant Gaitonde * Rajat Kapoor as Mahesh Deshmukh (Meera's Husband) * Prathamesh Parab as Jos√©, Vijay's Assistant at Mirage Cable Network * Rishab Chadha as Sameer Deshmukh (Mahesh And Meera's Son) aka Sam * Vikas Kumar as Alex, Sam's Friend * Jubin as Jubin * Sharad Bhutadiya as Martin Uncle * Ramesh Pardeshi as Contractor Rane * Yogesh Soman as Assistant Inspector (AI) * Prasanna Ketkar as Sr. PI Shrikant Prabhu == Production ==  Casting  In October 2014, it was announced that Saif Ali Khan would take the lead role and reprise the role played by Mohanlal in the 2013 Malayalam predecessor, but in November 2014, it was announced that Ajay Devgn would star in the Hindi remake of the 2013 film Drishyam, which will be produced by Viacom 18 Motion Pictures in association with Panorama Studios and directed by Nishikant Kamat. Plans then were to have Devgn reprise the role played by Mohanlal in the 2013 film. Later it was announced that Tabu will be playing the role of Meera Deshmukh a cop and Shriya Saran will play the wife of Ajay Devgn's character.  Filming  Principal photography for the film was slated to begin in February 2015. Ajit Andhare, the Chief operating officer of Viacom 18 Motion Pictures stated \\"Drishyam is an iconic film that leaves you spellbound and intrigued long after you have watched it. Its box office record in Malayalam & Telugu speaks for itself.\\" Actor Ajay Devgn had been in Canada to shoot snow scenes for his upcoming film Shivaay, but light snow conditions had him reschedule that film and return to India to instead begin Drishyam. The First 20 Day Shooting schedule of the film began on 13 March 2015 in Goa and ended on 1 April 2015. The second schedule of the film began on 2nd week of April. The first look of the film was unveiled on 29 May 2015.  Legal issues  On the announcement of the Hindi remake, film producer Ekta Kapoor sent a legal notice to the Malayalam filmmakers. Ekta Kapoor acquired the movie rights of Japanese author Keigo Higashino's book, The Devotion of Suspect X, and her legal team claimed that Drishyam is a film adaptation of the novel, for which they purchased rights. However, the original Drishyam director and screenwriter Jeethu Joseph, denied that his film is an adaptation or copy of the Japanese novel and film. Commentator Nandini Ramnath noted how the denial of even slight inspiration by the Japanese novel is parallel to the inside movie storyline as \\"Jeethu Joseph's achievement lies in lifting an intelligent concept and localising it so effectively that the links (to the Japanese novel) appear tenuous unless closely investigated. Drishyam is the perfect crime about a perfect crime, and its director's alibi is almost as airtight as the one Ishigami creates for Yasuko and Misato.\\" Drishyam was declared tax free in Uttar Pradesh. == Soundtrack == The music for Drishyam is composed by Vishal Bhardwaj with lyrics written by Gulzar. A song titled \\"Carbon Copy\\", which was sung by Ash King, was released on 7 July 2015. The music rights for Drishyam are acquired by Zee Music Company. == Release == Drishyam was released on 31 July 2015 on 2,365 screens in India. ==Reception== Critical reception Meena Iyer of The Times of India gave the film four out of five stars, describing it as \\"A suspense drama with a nail-biting finish.\\" Iyer criticized the casting choices for some of the Salgaonkar family, but praised Devgn and Tabu's performances, \\"Ajay, who is the prey here, shines in his role of the protective father ... Tabu [is] outstanding as his predator.\\" The Indian Express, however, gave the remake two and a half out of five stars and found fault with the chemistry between Devgn and Shriya Saran, who plays his character's wife. Indian Express described Devgan's performance as \\"stilted\\" and Tabu's performance as \\"off-and-on\\", commenting that she comes off as stiff at times.Drishyam review: This Ajay Devgn film could have been better if it had been tighter. The Indian Express (1 August 2015). Retrieved on 4 January 2016. Rohit Vats of Hindustan Times rated the film three and half out of five stars, describing it as \\"Stunning, gripping, edge-of-the-seat, shocking, engrossing\\".

You know what happened but even then you are taken for a ride and you start believing in it.\\" Martin D'Souza of Glamsham gave it four out of five stars and stated \\"Drishyam is a spot-on crime thriller that has some 'heart-in-your-mouth' moments. It's set up in a made-up village called Pondolim in North Goa. What's satisfying about the entire screenplay is that what Vijay is doing on screen is what you will do for your family. Nothing less; after all, family is all that we have!\\" Subhash K. Jha of gave it four and half out of five stars and stated \\"Nishikant Kamat's Drishyam is an outright winner . It is not just a remarkably resonant remake but also a unique stand-alone experience.\\" Suchitra Bajpai Chaudhary of Gulf News gave it four and half out of five stars and stated \\"There are no loose ends in the plot; every character, every situation is well planned and visualised to perfection. The background score is evocative though a song that served to highlight the trauma of the characters seemed eminently forgettable.\\" The Free Press Journal (FPJ Bureau) Said, \\"The climax is just awesome and worth watching and waiting for. Performance-wise, Ajay is very good, as is Tabu. Shriya and the daughters have also acted brilliantly and do justice to their characters. The film's direction and screenplay is very good, while the music is okay.

Carlos Bonavides, Laura Le√≥n, Sergio Goyri and Sasha Sokol star as the main protagonists, while Claudio B√°ez, Lorena Herrera, Martha Julia and Rodrigo Vidal as the main antagonists. == Plot == Huicho Dom√≠nguez (Carlos Bonavides), an uneducated, womanizing family man with two children in working-class Mexico, wins the grand prize jackpot (\\"el premio mayor\\") in the national lottery. He and his family subsequently move into a large mansion and attempt to adjust to the newfound fame and customs associated with the upper class. Huicho begins to fill his mansion with flamboyant items of bad taste, and wastes his money shamelessly. The arc of the storyline revolves around him finding a way to balance the seductive aura of his recent wealth - and the beautiful gold- diggers that appear in his life - with not losing the love of his life, his wife Rebeca (Laura Leon). Alongside them is Rosario (Sasha Sokol), a good and noble girl who was adopted by Rebeca and Huicho. She is humiliated and mistreated by Huicho and his two children; however, Rebecca is good and sweet towards her and considers her as her own daughter. Rosario has a boyfriend, (Rodrigo Vidal) Diego, who seems to be the ideal man who loves her too; however, he ends up becoming a villain when his boss, Jorge (Sergio Goyri), an unlucky journalist, falls for Rosario too. The new, rich Huicho begins using his money to attract women and have numerous affairs with the support of his oldest son, Luis Gerardo (Sergio Sendel), who has always been interested in Rosario and becomes another obstacle between her and Jorge, who has two siblings, Lorenzo (Marcelo Buquet) and Sergio (Claudio B√°ez). Lorenzo is noble and supports the relationship between Rosario and his brother, while Sergio is evil and jealous of Lorenzo. Together with his sister-in-law and mistress Antonia (Lorena Herrera), who is Lorenzo's wife, and Sergio's daughter Deborah (Sussan Taunton), they are responsible for countless misdeeds, including making Jorge lose his family. When Huicho's affairs come to light, mainly due to the sensual and interested Consuelo (Martha Julia), Lorenzo admits his own feelings for Rebeca, leading to devastating family conflicts that will shake the protagonists' faith in money as the solution to their problems. == Cast == * Laura Le√≥n as Rebeca Molina de Dom√≠nguez * Carlos Bonavides as Luis \\"Huicho\\" Dom√≠nguez * Sergio Goyri as Jorge Domensain * Sasha Sokol as Rosario 'Charo' Dom√≠nguez * Lorena Herrera as Antonia Fern√°ndez de Domensain / Amelia de Bausate / Florencia de Robledo / Roberta de Reyes Retana / Isabel Villagr√°n * Claudio B√°ez as Sergio Domensain * Luz Mar√≠a Jerez as Cristina Molina * Sergio Sendel as Luis Gerardo Dom√≠nguez * Rodrigo Vidal as Diego Rodr√≠guez * Martha Julia as Consuelo Flores * Jos√© √Ångel Garc√≠a as Esteban Mir√©lez * Marcelo Buquet as Lorenzo Domensain * Sussan Taunton as D√©borah Domensain * Leonor Llaus√°s as Do√±a Anita L√≥pez de Dom√≠nguez * Yaxkin Santaluc√≠a as Pepe Dom√≠nguez * Diego Luna as Quique Dom√≠nguez * Elsa Navarrete as Concepci√≥n 'Conchita' Dom√≠nguez * Irina Areu as Tracy Smith * Gabriela Araujo as Patricia Molina * Magdalena Cabrera as Fulgencia P√©rez * M√≥nica Dossetti as Karla Greta Reyes Retana y de las Altas Torres * H√©ctor Su√°rez Gomis as Gabriel Robledo * Yolanda Ciani as Gladis * Roberto Tello as El Carnicero/ √Ångel G√≥mez * Sergio DeFassio as Cosme Guti√©rrez / Demetrio Iregaray de Fuentes y Mares * Ricardo Silva as Agust√≠n Villagr√°n * Carlos Dur√°n as Don Federico Estrada * Antonio Escobar as Rodrigo * Lorena Tassinari as Reyna S√°nchez (#1) * Gabriela Arroyo as Reyna S√°nchez (#2) * Patricia √Ålvarez as Mim√≠ * Jos√© Luis Rojas as Hip√≥lito 'Cachito' * Anghel as Etelvina * Alfonso Mier y Ter√°n as Tobi Reyes Retana * Alejandro Villeli as Arist√≥teles * Marita de Lara as Pocahontas * Jos√© Antonio Iturriaga as Nemesio * Anthony √Ålvarez as El Tibur√≥n * Perla Encinas as Elizabeth Dominguez Molina * Laura Forastieri as Irene * Luis Couturier as Anthony Wilson * Marina Mar√≠n as Bety * Rodrigo Ruiz as Carlos Fern√°ndez * Rodrigo Abed as Gustavo * Galilea Montijo as Lil√≠ * Ram√≥n Vald√©s Urtiz as Jorgito Domensain * Marco Antonio Regil as To√±o * Francisco Mendoza as Alex * Salvador Garcini as Juan * Vanessa Angers as Gema * Dinorah Cavazos as Iris * Annette Cuburu as Tracy * Jorge Becerril as Jos√© Ospina * Oyuki Manjarrez as Lolita * Fernando Manzano as El Hidr√°ulico * Osvaldo Benavides as Chicles * Zayda Castell√≥n as Pascuala * Ranferi Negrete as Dami√°n * Juan Romanca as Comandante Hugo Ortega * Rodolfo de Alejandre as Pollo * Sylvia Vald√©s as Ruperta * Iv√°n Perea as El Perico / Omar S√°nchez * M√≥nica Prado as Mam√° de Mim√≠ * Alejandro Avila as Hugo * Octavio Menduet as Comandante Torres * Mariana Huerdo as Andrea * Jonathan as Jonathan * Archie Lafranco as Daniel == References  External links == * Category:1995 telenovelas Category:Televisa telenovelas Category:1995 Mexican television series debuts Category:1996 Mexican television series endings Category:Mexican telenovelas Category:Spanish-language telenovelas ","title":"El premio mayor"},{"id":"46296695","text":"Reniere & Depla is a Belgian artist duo, consisting of Paul Reniere (Poperinge, Belgium,¬∞1956) and Martine Depla (Ostend, Belgium,¬∞1954). http://www.reniere-depla.be Together they paint primarily with acrylic paint on canvas and wood panel. They have curated exhibitions in Belgium and France, showing the works of [Berlinde De Bruyckere], [Hans op de Beeck], and other celebrated Belgian artists.

Like a growing group of contemporary artists they use photography as source material for their work. Martine Depla Paul Reniere == Biography == Paul Reniere was born in Poperinge on November 23, 1956. He studied printmaking at the Saint-Lucas Academy for fine arts in Ghent where he graduated in 1980. In 1982 he becomes laureate for the ‚ÄúGaverprijs‚Äù for painting and in 1982 he wins the Europa prize for painting. In 1981 he is appointed teacher of free graphics and painting at the Poperinge Academy of Art, a position he held until 2014 . Martine Depla was born in Ostend on December 29, 1954. She studied biology at Ghent University, but did not finish her studies. In 1991 she enrolls at the Poperinge Academy of Art where Paul Reniere becomes her teacher. In 1995 Martine Depla becomes laureate of the Louise Dehem prize for painting and in 1996 she wins the prize for painting in Harelbeke, Belgium. During the initial years of their relationship the artistic work of Paul Reniere and Martine Depla remains separate. They exhibit in their own name.http://www.reniere- depla.be/index.php?/cv/ In 1995 they present their work together for the first time under the name ‚ÄòReniere&Depla;‚Äô. Since then they make no distinction as to whom painted which work. == Positioning == Their oeuvre consists of paintings (on wood panel and on canvas), drawings (on paper and carton) and sculpture in various materials (fabric, leather, wax and plaster). They paint with acrylic paint and build up their work with glaze layers. The white parts of their work (e.g. light) are being overpainted several times which gives them depth and makes them ‚Äúshine‚Äù.Theys, H. (2009) ‚ÄòLichtindrukken verrijkt, doorkruist en omzwachteld. Enkele woorden over een reeks schilderijen van Reniere&Depla;‚Äô In: ‚ÄòOver Vorm‚Äô, Tornado Editions, Brussel, p. 29 Professor and art philosopher Willem Elias described their work as exemplary of the neo- symbolic style, a term he created, whereby the photographic source material of the painter plays an important role.Elias,W.(2009) ‚ÄôReniere&Depla;: Ik is een andere. In: ‚ÄôReniere&Depla;, 2005-2009‚Äô, Asp-Editions, Brussel, p4 Art Critic Hans Theys wrote about the unique role light plays in most of their work: ‚ÄúOne of the most striking characteristics of these paintings is the way in which the light seems to appear from the depths and seems to be woven into the whole construction. The objects represented have a certain mistiness or instability to them, in spite of their being in the way. Indeed, our view of the reality invoked is often immediately blocked by walls; yet these are not real walls, not only as they have been painted, but also as they pose as a yielding, porous surface slowly corroded by thousands of incidents.‚Äù Their style bears resemblance to several artists. Erik Rinckhout, journalist for the Belgian daily newspaper De Morgen compared their work to that of L√©on Spilliaert, Xavier Mellery, Maurice Gilliams and Edgar D√©gas.Rinckhout, Eric.

He held a hurling tournament between clubs from Cork and Tipperary in 1886, which led to the introduction of intercounty competition.125 Most Influential People In GAA History (76-100) During his time as chairman of the Cork county board, a dispute arose over the 1894 All-Ireland senior football final. In the replay of the final between Cork and Dublin, Cork were leading 1-2 to 0-5 (a goal was worth 5 points at the time) when several Dublin players were attacked by Cork supporters. Dublin refused to play on; Cork refused a second replay, and the GAA Central Council awarded the championship to Dublin. Deering resigned from the Central Council, and a schism developed in the GAA, with Cork running its own All-Ireland. Cork reconciled with the GAA, and Deering returned to the Central Council, becoming president in 1898.

June 13, 1515) was a bey of Beylik of Dulkadir, a Turkish beylik (principality) in Anatolia ==Background== Dulkadir was a semi independent beylik under the sovereignty of the Mamluk Egypt. The beylik was located around Kahramanmara≈ü and Elbistan, which made the beylik a buffer territory of the Mamluks against the Ottoman Empire. After the former bey ≈ûahsuvar was executed in Cairo by the Mamluks, Shah Budak was appointed as the bey. But his brother Bozkurt was waiting for his chance.Y√ºcel Sevim, Vol 1, p.315 ==Early years as a bey== Bozkurt took control of the beylik in 1480 by the support of Ottoman Sultan Mehmet II. Being cautious not to antagonise the Mamluks, he followed a balanced policy between the two great powers. One of his daughters, Ay≈üe Hatun I, married to Beyazit II, the future sultan of the Ottomans. Bozkurt captured the city Diyarbakƒ±r from the Akkoyunlu Turkmen dynasty. But he was not successful against Ismail I of the Safavids in Iran. When ƒ∞smail stormed his capital Elbistan, he had to move the capital to Mara≈ü, today Kahramanmara≈ü. ==War during the reign of Bayazƒ±t II== In 1481, Bayazƒ±t II rose to the throne of the Ottoman Empire. During the civil war between Bayazƒ±t II and his brother Cem, Mamluks supported Cem and the uneasy peace between the two powers ended. Ottomans tried to control √áukurova, Cilicia of the antiquity, a region to the southwest of Dulkadir territory and under the control of Ramadanids, another buffer principality. But they were defeated by the Mamluks. Influenced by the Mamluk victory, Bozkurt gave up his balanced policy and began hostilities against the Ottomans. In 1486, he defeated an Ottoman force under the commandship of Skender Pasha. However, Mamluks were not able to defeat Ottomans to the north of the Toros Mountains and following a stalemate, the war ended in 1491.Jorga, Vol II, pp.213-215 ==War during the reign of Selim I== In 1512, Selim I, nicknamed \\"the Inflexible\\" or \\"the Grim\\", became the Ottoman Sultan. In 1514, during his campaign to Iran, Bozkurt's reluctance to allow safe pass for the Ottoman forces caused a problem. In 1515, before starting a war against the Mamluks, he decided to end the Dulkadir Beylik as well. He sent Hadim Sinan Pasha, his future grand vizier, to Dulkadir territory. In a battle called the Battle of Turnadaƒü, Sinan Pasha defeated Dulkadir army. Bozkurt as well as his sons were killed.Y√ºcel Sevim Vol 2, p.242 ==Trivia== The origin of Selim's mother G√ºlbahar Hatun is debatable. She might be Bozkurt's daughter. If that were the case, than Bozkurt was Selim's maternal grandfather. ==CitationSources== * * * Category:15th-century births Category:1515 deaths Category:Turkic rulers Category:Dulkadirids Category:16th-century monarchs in Asia Category:15th-century monarchs in Asia ","title":"Bozkurt of Dulkadir"},{"id":"46296981","text":"Events in the year 1988 in Brazil. ==Incumbents== Federal government * President: Jos√© Sarney * Vice President: vacant  Governors  * Acre: * Alagoas: * Amazonas: * Bahia: * Cear√°: * Esp√≠rito Santo: * Goi√°s: * Maranh√£o: * Mato Grosso: * Mato Grosso do Sul * Minas Gerais: * Par√°: * Para√≠ba: * Paran√°: * Pernambuco: * Piau√≠: * Rio Grande do Norte: * Rio Grande do Sul: * Rond√¥nia: * Roraima: * Santa Catarina: * S√£o Paulo: * Sergipe: * Tocantins:  Vice governors  * Acre: * Alagoas: * Amazonas: * Bahia: * Cear√°: * Esp√≠rito Santo: * Goi√°s: * Mato Grosso: * Mato Grosso do Sul: * Minas Gerais: * Par√°: * Para√≠ba: * Paran√°: * Pernambuco: * Piaui: * Rio Grande do Norte: * Rio Grande do Sul: * Rond√¥nia: * Santa Catarina: * S√£o Paulo: == Events ==  October  * October 5: The country's current constitution is created.

It was released by Blue Star Music, in conjunction with XIII BIS Records, on 21 October 2003. ==Background== An article by the BBC describes how Almond \\"went to St Petersburg to interpret traditional Russian romance songs\\" to make what \\"may have become his most ambitious album so far\\". Almond mostly sang cover versions of traditional Russian songs, including a number from the Russian romance canon, and collaborated with a number of Russian artists on the album, such as Alla Bayanova and Lyudmila Zykina. The album was released as a standard jewel case CD and a limited edition CD book in a slipcase containing a 44-page book with extensive background notes to all of the songs. The single \\"Gone But Not Forgotten\\" was released from the album in September 2003 with two tracks (\\"Gosudaryunia\\" and \\"Just One Chance\\") and the video for the title track. ==Critical reception== Reviews for Heart on Snow were mixed. Dorian Lynskey in The Guardian describes Heart on Snow as \\"a labour of love for which it's hard to feel much affection\\" and as lacking \\"the sly humour of Soft Cell and his best solo work\\" yet admires the \\"boldness and integrity in making an album that only uses Russian musicians\\". The review in Uncut states that Almond keeps his versions of the material \\"respectful which, despite the lack of Russian wildness, makes it (Heart on Snow) all the more moving\\". Paul Taylor in the Manchester Evening News describes the album as \\"a cunning mixture of smooth, westernised productions and balalaika-plucking, raw Russky folk stylings\\" and states that \\"anyone remotely broad-minded about their music would find this a joy\\". ==Track listing== Note ‚Äì there is a discrepancy with the titles of tracks 13 and 19 between the liner notes, \\"Glance From Your Dark Eyes\\"; and the track listing, \\"The Glance of Your Dark Eyes\\". ==Personnel== In addition to artists credited in the track listing: *Marc Almond ‚Äì vocals, translation adaptation *Martin Watkins ‚Äì piano, original keyboards, arrangements *Andrei Samsonov ‚Äì keyboards *Oleg Belov ‚Äì keyboards, grand piano *Mikhail Aptekman ‚Äì grand piano *Sergey Erdenko ‚Äì violin *Georgij Osmolovskij ‚Äì violin *Aliosha Bezlepkin ‚Äì guitar *Vladimir Kudryavtsev ‚Äì double bass *Grigory Voskoboynikov ‚Äì double bass *Albert Potapkin ‚Äì drums *Garij Bagdasaryan ‚Äì drums *Oleg Sakmarov ‚Äì flute *Andrej Vikharev ‚Äì percussion *Sergej Shurakov ‚Äì accordion *Kirill Kravtsov ‚Äì cello *Alexandre Kiahidi ‚Äì trumpet *Dmitrij Kuzmin ‚Äì tuba *Karin Brown ‚Äì French horn *Viktor Bastrakov ‚Äì guitar *Maria Shurakova ‚Äì mandolin *Vladimir Miller ‚Äì bass vocal *Anatoli Sobolev ‚Äì conductor *The St Petersburg Higher Naval Engineering Choir ‚Äì choir *Gardemarin Youth Choir ‚Äì choir *Julia Khutoretskaya ‚Äì choir leader ==References== Category:2003 albums Category:Marc Almond albums ","title":"Heart on Snow"},{"id":"46297075","text":"Peterson Hill is an Indian drama television series, which aired on Sab TV and premiered on 26 January 2015.

She has written for the tabloid newspaper The Daily Mail since 2013. She was previously arts editor at The Times. ==Early life== Sarah Rosemary Vine was born in Swansea, Wales in April 1967. She has a younger brother who lives in Madrid, Spain. When she was five, the family moved to Italy, initially staying in Rome, before moving to Frascati. She reports that she returned to the United Kingdom, at the age of 16 and that she attended the comprehensive schools Hammersmith and West London, Holland Park School, and Lewes Technical College near Brighton. Vine studied modern languages at University College London. ==Career== After graduation, Vine worked in customer services for the retailer Hobbs Ltd. She then did a series of jobs within journalism including as a TV listings sub at Daily Mirror, features editor for the magazine Tatler, before joining The Times newspaper. She was promoted to arts editor at the newspaper. Along with Rosemary Davidson, in 2007 she co-wrote the book The Great Big Glorious Book for Girls. She was a columnist for The Times newspaper for 15 years before joining the tabloid newspaper, The Daily Mail in 2013. In 2019, she received the Columnist of the Year ‚Äì Popular (2018) award at the Society of Editors' Press Awards. In March 2014, she and her husband's decision to send their daughter to Grey Coat Hospital comprehensive school in Westminster made Gove the first Conservative Party education secretary to have chosen the state over the private sector for their child's secondary schooling. In her column for the Daily Mail, Vine celebrated the \\"miracle\\" of state education and criticised private education, saying \\"Its agenda is a fundamentally selective one, based not only on ability to pay, but also on pupil potential. And it is also, let's face it, about snobbery\\". Vine added that her decision to send her daughter to a state secondary school was motivated by a desire for her child to receive a broad education: \\"that you shouldn't judge people by their clothes, or where they live, but by who they really are. That, in my view, is the miracle of our state education system. Like the NHS, it welcomes all-comers. The state doesn't care where its pupils come from; all that matters is where they're heading.\\" In November 2014, she wrote a column criticising food writer and activist Jack Monroe for mentioning the death of David Cameron's son in 2009 in one of a series of tweets criticising Cameron. Vine went on to question Monroe's decision to have a child herself insinuating that her choice led to her own poverty. Monroe condemned the article as 'homophobic, transphobic, deadnaming, ignorant, and generally ghastly lies'. During the 2015 United Kingdom general election, Vine used her column to criticise Labour Party leader Ed Miliband, his wife and their 'forlorn little kitchen'. In the same column, she reported that her own kitchen was '10 years old' and that the 'hob has many knobs missing'. Private Eye magazine questioned this as it commented that ¬£7,000 had been spent on the kitchen as part of her husband Michael Gove's MP expenses. Vine suggested that this was a 'twisted interpretation'. In the 2016 UK referendum on EU membership, she voted for the UK to leave the EU. On 28 June, she accidentally sent a private email meant to be read by Gove and his close advisors to a member of the public, who leaked it to the press. In the email, Vine had advised her husband not to back Boris Johnson's bid to become leader of the Conservative Party unless 'specific assurances' were given to him. Two days later, Johnson unexpectedly dropped out of the 2016 Conservative Party leadership election, after Gove made a surprise bid to become leader. ==Personal life== She has been married to Conservative MP and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove since 2001. They met when she was the arts editor and he was the comments editor at The Times newspaper. They have one son and one daughter. Vine is the godmother to one of former Prime Minister David Cameron's daughters. In May 2020, Gove was criticised after Vine shared a bookcase picture \\"as a very special treat for my trolls\\" which featured a book by the Holocaust denier David Irving, and a copy of The Bell Curve, which controversially claims that intelligence is highly heritable and that median IQ varies among races. Another book in the photograph was The Strange Death of Europe by Douglas Murray, which, according to The Guardian, cites Enoch Powell and argues for protecting white Christian Europe from \\"outsiders\\". Beyond Human Rights: Defending Freedom by Alain de Benoist, leader of ethno- nationalist think tank GRECE, and Why We Fight: Manifesto of the European Resistance and Archeofuturism - European Visions of the Post-Catastrophic Age by Guillaume Faye were also featured, both published by European New Right Arktos Media, known for translating far-right material into English. One other book was Leo Strauss and the American Conservative Movement by paleoconservative Paul Gottfried, who coined the term 'Alternative Right' (often shortened to 'Alt-Right') whilst working alongside Richard B. Spencer. ==References== Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of University College London Category:Daily Mail journalists Category:People from Swansea Category:The Times people ","title":"Sarah Vine"},{"id":"46297126","text":"Shankill GAA is a Gaelic Athletic Association club in based in the Shankill area in the south of County Dublin. The club was reformed in 2013. To date the club has an adult mens and ladies team football along with boys and girls teams at underage at various levels. ==Origins of the club== Shankill Shilmaliers The earliest known existence of a Shankill team was on November 5, 1911, a Sunday. Very little is known before this date. The club was known as Shankill Shilmaliers. The name Shilmalier taken from the barony of Shilmalier Co.Wexford, a place associated with the 1798 rebellion. In July 1910 a newly formed newspaper called the Saturday Dublin Post published Dublin‚Äôs first match reports and minutes of County Board Meetings. Dublin GAA and Ireland at the time were in hectic circles. The Post did reporting on behalf of all organisations during a political atmosphere hostile to the fostering of Irish culture. Here are extracts of the Post involving Shankill Shilmaliers. Sunday November 5, 1911 at the Phoenix ParkFoxrock Geraldines and Shankill Shilmaliers teams lined out to play their match, and from the start the ball was more often out of play than in. The players kept at it, however, for 40 minutes, but a very heavy shower coming on, their ardour cooled a little, and they sought the shelter of the trees. The Referee deemed it unwise to continue the game. Shilmaliers were leading by 1 goal 1 point to 1 point. About 1 minute before half time a player of the Shankill team named Jas McGarry was seriously injured as a result of accidentally colliding with an opponent. It was decided in full view of the circumstances to refix the match to be played for the full time at Shankill on Sunday. Mr J J Clare to Referee. The Replay Played On Sunday November 12, 1911 at People‚Äôs Park, Bray At the weekly meeting of the football league Mr J J Clare(Referee) reported that junior tie between Shankill Shilmaliers and Foxrock Gerarldines was fixed at the last meeting to be played in Shankill, but as the ground there was not available, both teams travelled on to the People‚Äôs Park Bray to play the match. After 40 minutes play the match was abandoned for want of a ball, 2 balls having been burst. The scores at the time: Foxrock 1-1 Shankill 1 point. Mr Clare further reported that a Foxrock player named Joseph Seville retired seriously injured through accidentally colliding with an opponent. 2nd Replay On Sunday November 26, 1911 at Kill-O-The -Grange The much played game between Foxrock Gers and Shankill Shilmaliers was finally decided on Sunday at Kill-O-the-Grange. It will be recollected that the teams met twice before in the Phoenix Park and the People‚Äôs Park Bray, when after forty minutes play on each occasion the game had to be abandoned, owing to the storm on the first occasion and in consequence of the ball bursting on the second occasion. Last Sundays match, however, settled the matter, as the Foxrock men won by 2 goals to 1 goal 1 point. During the progress of the game which was a fairly good one C O‚ÄôNeill (Shankill) retired injured, Rogers taking his place. Mr J J Clare refereed. The Teams were: Foxrock:- M. O‚ÄôFarrell, Simon Quigley , Thos Kirwan , Thos Mc Gee , M. Powderly , Thos Kelly , Pat Mc Evoy , John Shannon , R. Sheridan , Wm Murphy , M. Devlin , J. Salter , Stephen Foley , Patrick Baker , John Seville. Shankill:- Simon Doyle , Frank Crawley , Chris O‚ÄôNeill , Pat Mc Donnell , J. Kearns , Wm Hanlon , T. Mahony , T. Mc Garry , W. Collins , E. Murphy , Jas Murphy , Patrick Mc Hugh , M. Nolan , M. Reilly. Football League Meeting December 11, 1911 - Shankill Objection To Foxrock The First objection taken up was the Shankill Shilmaliers objection to Foxrock Gers (B) team, which played them in a league tie at Kill-O-The-Grange, the grounds of the objection being, the Foxrock team played six players who played against Clan Lir in October. After the objection had been read, Mr J J Clare said he was not going to defend it, as the players were illegal. The Committee could give the points to Shankill. The Chairman ruled accordingly and points were awarded to Shankill. ==AchievementsNotable playersReferences== Category:Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in D√∫n Laoghaire‚ÄìRathdown Category:Gaelic football clubs in D√∫n Laoghaire‚ÄìRathdown ","title":"Shankill GAA"},{"id":"46297147","text":"Vintage Life is a British glossy fashion and lifestyle magazine, published by Dragoon Publishing, focusing on the 1920s‚Äì1970s.

It was partially written between 1915 and the end of the poet's life in 1951. It was published in 1955. The main plot takes place in late antiquity Greece which is under the apparent influence of Rome, as well as during the first years of Christianity, in the 4th century AD, and follows the struggle of sick athlete Igesias to get well ‚Äì by putting his hopes on Asclepius and his sanctuary in Epidaurus. The scenery (the Asklepieion of Epidaurus and the cults relating to the treatment of illnesses and human health at a time when new -Christian- ideas are emerging) clearly reflects the intention of Sikelianos to talk about a time of conflict between two major traditions (the Greek and the Christian spirit) and their final reconciliation and synthesis ‚Äìin the work. The character of Igesias (leadership) (a symbol -with a proper name for the political events occurring during the last editing of the work; both as a concept for the people and also the poet) is carrying within the purity of the ancient ideals, but also embraces the Christian beliefs, proceeding to a blending of the two worldviews. In this way, the improvement of the health of Igesias (meaning that of the people) will be made possible through those changes that the people will willingly accept and implement (in everyday life) aiming at their spiritual progress, rebirth and its treatment of the disease. At the same time, the soul of the poet Igesias - is cured from all personal passions and problems and he finds Health (healing as a principle is apparent throughout text that has been salvaged to date), a meeting that is affecting the situation (and the desire for treatment) of the poet in the final period of writing of the play: Sikelianos is ill and is gradually unable to leave his sickbed (the end is not far away). Therefore, the redemption of the soul of Igesias which will be the salvation for the poet, is the salvation of his own soul. The connection with ancient Greek tragedy is once again present. It has been suggested that Igesias ‚Äì who comes from Argos ‚Äì be identified with the \\"sick\\" Orestis of the ancient drama, who also comes from Argos (many schemes and elements of the tragedy of Sikelianos, especially those relevant to Igesias, - the illness that he has which is a result of a mental illness - the therapy through sleep and dreams that are directly suggestive of what we would in ancient drama call \\"correspondences\\" and \\"ideals\\"). ==ReferencesSources== *Œ£ŒπŒ∫ŒµŒªŒπŒ±ŒΩœåœÇ.

The first issue came out in the winter of 1959. Linick and Factor were particularly drawn to the poetry and writing of the Beat Generation, who wrote of their own, frequently chaotic, lives. Nomad published work by such later famous authors and poets as: *John Ashbery *Michael Benedikt *Charles Bukowski *William Burroughs *Gregory Corso *Robert Creeley *Allen Ginsberg *LeRoi Jones *Robert Kelly *Kenneth Koch *Denise Levertov *Michael McClure *Frank O‚ÄôHara *John Perreault *Paul Raboff *Gilbert Sorrentino *Gary Snyder *Diane Wakoski *Lew Welch *Philip Whalen *Louis Zukofsky In the literary realm, Nomad played a singular role in having published Charles Bukowski at an early date. Nomads inaugural issue in 1959 featured two of Bukowski's poems, with Nomad publishing Bukowski before his first book, Flower Fist and Bestial Wail, appeared in 1960.Birmingham 2007). Nomad used Bukowski's poem So Much for the Knifers, So Much for the Bellowing Dawns as a prologue to its \\"Manifesto\\" issue, because the poem epitomized the anti-academic tone Linick and Factor wanted to feature. The \\"Manifesto\\" issue provided a format for statements of literary philosophy. The issue included one of Bukowski's best known essays, Manifesto: A Call for Our Own Critics.Debritto (2013), p.90. It also featured, among others, a contribution by William Burroughs, who contributed a selection from Minutes to Go. In the magazine's last issue, Nomad/New York, a special double issue (10/11, Autumn 1962), Factor wrote one of the first essays on what would become known as pop art, though he did not use term. The essay, \\"Four Artists\\", focused on Roy Lichtenstein, James Rosenquist, Jim Dine, and Claes Oldenburg. At the time Factor was a collector of the work of these artists and their contemporaries. Also, the same issue saw John Bernard Myers, co-owner of the Tibor de Nagy Gallery, whom Factor knew from his collecting, introduce the phrase \\"New York School of Poetry\\" (as distinct from simply \\"New York Poets\\").Diggory (2013). He used the term in his introduction to a selection of poems in the issue. He categorized the common traits of Ashbery, Kenward Elmslie, Barbara Guest, Koch, O'Hara, James Schuyler, and others, as constituting a \\"New York School\\". Linick and Factor had equal responsibility when it came to deciding what to include in the magazine. Factor paid for publication, and the London printers were Villiers Publications, the same firm that printed Lawrence Ferlinghetti's famous City Lights Pocket Poets Series, including Ginsberg's Howl. Linick was responsible for all correspondence, solicited manuscripts from poets that he and Factor liked, managed the subscriptions, did the proofreading, and wrote all of the editorials within the magazine and the section on contributors. Among the authors Nomad published, one stands out for his work in law, not poetry. Charles Black, who had earned a master's degree in Old and Middle English literature at Yale and wrote a thesis on Percy Bysshe Shelley as a translator of verse, became a teacher of law at Yale. He is best known for his role in the historic case Brown v. Board of Education. Linick and Factor published eleven issues, and prepared a twelfth issue, which never appeared. The editors' lives outside Nomad had started to demand more time and commitment. Linick was completing his doctoral dissertation at UCLA, and married in 1964. In the fall of 1964 UCLA gave him a one-year appointment as an instructor in the History Department, which required that he devote extensive time to course preparation. He then moved to Michigan State University where he eventually became a tenured professor. Factor increased his involvement in the art scene, and then moved into motion pictures. The two editors lost touch with each other, before reconnecting and establishing a personal friendship many years later in London, where fortuitously both had moved.

She was the Republican nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma in 1990, and was a candidate for Oklahoma's 5th congressional district in the 2020 election. ==Early life and education== Terry Neese was born in Walters, Oklahoma to Clifford and Vida Mae Farleyhttps://obits.oklahoman.com/obituaries/oklahoman/obituary.aspx?n=vida- bowles&pid;=189058043, and raised in Cookietown, Oklahoma. She has two sisters. She graduated from Burkburnett High School in Burkburnett, Texas. According to Neese, she briefly attended the University of Oklahoma, studying secretarial science with the intention of being an administrative assistant. ==Career== Neese worked for several companies in Norman, Oklahoma as a secretary and later office manager. Neese describes founding her own business with $600, turning it into a ‚Äúmultimillion-dollar business‚Äù, Terry Neese Personnel Service in 1975. In 2000, she passed on the company to her daughter, Kim Neese-Brown. She has said that her company has helped find employment for more than 24,000 people in Oklahoma. Neese also describes creating and leading multiple organizations with worldwide outreach. For example, she describes co- founding GrassRoots Impact, Inc. with Democratic National Committee member Barbara Kasoff. GrassRoots Impact provides a communications strategy for corporations and government agencies to effectively reach out to women and minorities in business. In 1986, she founded a charity called Oklahomans Helping Oklahomans. The next year, she was named a co-chair for Business Partners Inc. in Oklahoma. She is the co-founder of WIPP (Women Impacting Public Policy) which was created in 2001. According to Neese, WIPP has over 600,000 members and works to advocate for women in business. Neese also describes herself as founder and CEO of the Institute for Educating and Empowering Women All Around the World., which apparently strives to educate women in business. Neese also describes a leadership role in a group called Peace Through Business , which is apparently a business training and mentorship program for women in Afghanistan and Rwanda. In 2001, she apparently created the Terry Neese Center for Entrepreneurial Excellence, and SBA Women's Business Center, in which she serves as the Chairwoman of the Board. Politics In 1990, Neese became the first woman nominated by a major political party for Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma. Neese was then defeated by Democratic candidate Jack Mildren. In 1994 she ran for Lieutenant Governor again, losing in a runoff election. https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=681924 https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=376781 During the 2016 United States Presidential Election, Neese served as the National Finance Chair for the Carly Fiorina 2016 presidential campaign. http://www.p2016.org/fiorina/fiorina080115pr.html In April 2019, Neese announced her candidacy for Oklahoma's 5th congressional district in the 2020 election. Just prior to announcing her candidacy, she moved into that district from Oklahoma's 3rd congressional district. In the June 30, 2020 Republican primary, Neese placed first among a field of nine candidates. As no candidate amassed 50 percent of votes cast, the top two vote-getters advanced to a runoff election. Neese was then defeated in the runoff election by state senator Stephanie Bice. ==Controversies== Neese had claimed \\"Native American (Cherokee) Heritage,\\" presumably membership in the Cherokee Nation, a claim which she used to garner a series of political appointments. In the early 1990s, for example, she was appointed by President George H. W. Bush to be a Commissioner to the National Advisory Council on Indian Education. All 15 of its members must be Native American. She was reappointed to this Council in 1993 by President Bill Clinton. Similarly, President George W. Bush nominated Neese to lead the U.S. Mint in 2005 at least partly because of her roots in the Cherokee Indian Community. In an article published at the time, Neese claims ‚Äúher roots to the Cherokee Indian Community run deep‚Äù. A 2020 investigation found Neese to have no membership in the Cherokee tribe. In the second scandal, Neese was requested to decline a 2005 government appointment from President Bush after training tapes were uncovered in which she instructed her employees to lie and use unethical behavior. At the time, Neese‚Äîwho had been a large Bush fundraiser‚Äîclaimed she was declining her appointment as Director of the U.S Mint for family reasons; the allegation of impropriety was not made until 2019. Neese said the tapes were doctored. and ==Awards== Neese was inducted into the Enterprising Women Hall of Fame, sponsored by Enterprising Women, in 2004. In 2013, she earned their Enterprising Women Legacy Award. Neese was inducted into the Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame in 2007. ==Personal life== Neese was listed as a resident of Yukon, Oklahoma in 2019, but subsequently rented an apartment in Oklahoma City, within Oklahoma's 5th congressional district, ahead of her congressional campaign. ==References *Oklahoma Women‚Äôs Hall of Fame Oral History Project ‚Äì OSU Library Category:1940s births Category:20th-century American businesswomen Category:21st-century American businesswomen Category:American feminists Category:American women's rights activists Category:Living people Category:People from Walters, Oklahoma Category:Oklahoma Republicans Category:University of Oklahoma alumni Category:Women in Oklahoma politics Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Terry Neese"},{"id":"46297254","text":"At Home With the Groovebox is a 2000 compilation album released on Grand Royal records.

There he met, in the same year group, his future wife and working partner Fenella Dixon (n√©e Clemens). In 1973, they won together the competition for the Northamptonshire County Offices (assisted by Edward Jones) and were responsible for a number of London projects, mostly housing, including the terrace of dwellings at 105‚Äì123 St Mark's Road. In partnership with Bill Jack of BDP, they won the Royal Opera House competition in 1984. The Jeremy/Fenella working association lasted until 1989 when Dixon was joined by Edward Jones, initially to complete the Royal Opera House. The new practice went on to complete a series of cultural and university projects including the National Portrait Gallery, The National Gallery, Said Business School and Exhibition Road together with projects that combine commercial and cultural functions such as Kings Place and Quadrant 3. More recently the practice has been involved with residential developments including the masterplan for Chelsea Barracks. Most of the work is located in London and both Dixon and Jones have a particular interest in the history and evolution of cities and in particular London. The work generally speaking takes account of the historical context as an approach to creating buildings on sensitive urban sites. He was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours.

The Chief was first flown in December 2005 and was the subject of a protracted development process. The company explained the long development time, \\"we were determined not to put a product on the market before its time. We have seen other kits sold that did not complete their development and testing. Their customers paid for completion of the development and in reality did much of their testing. By delaying our availability project until it was truly completed, we will avoid placing unnecessary a lot of \\"Airworthiness Directives\\" and flight restrictions on our aircraft.\\" The company intended to put the Chief into production in January 2006 at a rate of eight to ten kits per month and increase staff above the five employees already working. On 28 September 2006 a Chief crashed while hovering and burned, with only minor injuries to the pilot and passenger.

She published her memoirs and she is portrayed in Chinese historical dramas. ==Life== Early life Jiang was born as Jiang Tangzhen () in Yixing, Jiangsu province on 9 April 1899. Her father Jiang Meisheng was a scholar and poet who wrote a book on the Zhuangzi, and her mother Dai Qingbo was a poet. She attended the Young Girls Normal School in Changzhou.Jiang Biwei, Chinese Bio Database, retrieved 3 April 2015 In 1911, her parents betrothed her to Zha Zihan, who came from an influential family of Haining, Zhejiang. Relationship with Xu Beihong Jiang Biwei in Cheongsam dress by Xu Beihong In 1916 her family moved to avoid conflict in Yixing and so that her father could be a professor at Fudan University in Shanghai. One of the student friends of her father was the ambitious and talented artist Xu Beihong. He would come to visit her family and he and Jiang became close. Xu was set to go to Japan to study and Jiang was upset that she would shortly be married to the Zha family. Breaking the marriage agreement was virtually impossible, so they left a note behind and eloped to Japan. Xu gave her the name Jiang Biwei as a disguise, which later became better known than her real name. The embarrassment for her family was so great that her parents declared that she had died from an illness. Their anger subsided after Jiang wrote a letter of apology from Japan. After six months the couple, whose funds had run out, moved back to Shanghai. Xu was then offered a bursary to study in France by Cai Yuanpei of Peking University. In 1918 they both left and while Xu studied art in France she learned French so that she could run the household. Xu's bursary was not always regular and although he enrolled at top art schools they had to briefly move to Berlin where their francs would stretch further. At another point Jiang had to embroider at five francs a piece to make ends meet. In 1925 Xu returned to China alone to gather more funds leaving Jiang in Paris. However, Jiang was pregnant and she returned to China where she had a son, Xu Boyang, in 1927 and a daughter, Xu Lili, two years later. Xu Beihong and Jiang Biwei Xu rose to be a Professor of Art at Nanjing University. In 1930 Xu revealed that he had fallen in love with Sun Duoci, one of his part-time students. Jiang agreed to ignore this unfortunate turn of events. In 1933 Professor Xu was asked to go on a European tour with his exhibition and Jiang asked to go with him. This was an opportunity for them to be free of Sun Duoci who was left at the university where she was now enrolled as a full-time student. Xu was still in love with her and he saw her as a genius of painting and he had frequently used her as a model for his own work. Xu was also still using Jiang as a model and the only work of Xu that was sold in Europe was a painting of the sitting figure of Jiang.CHINESE OR WESTERN: A FEW OBSERVATIONS ON THE WORKS OF SOME TWENTIETH CENTURY CHINESE PAINTERS HOUSED IN EUROPEAN COLLECTIONS, MICHAELA PEJÔøΩOCHOV√Å, (Note: The painting referred to is now in Kyoto), retrieved 3 April 2015 After they returned from their tour of Europe via Russia, her husband and Sun Duoci would go on sketching trips with other students. The gossip was too much for Jiang to bear and in her anger she destroyed artworks at Xu's studio which featured Sun. At the time Xu was unwilling to divorce Jiang and Sun left the university - without a degree. In 1938, Xu made a public announcement in a newspaper that he would sever his relationship with Jiang, but Sun still rejected him and married someone else.Sun Duoci , Cultural China.com, retrieved 2 April 2015 The reality of Xu's affair with Sun has been questioned in later accounts. In her biography of Xu, Liao Jingwen states that there was never any improper relationship between him and Sun Duoci. Instead, the rumours about Xu's affair were spread by Zhang Daofan, who was attempting to separate Jiang from her husband. Relationship with Chang Tao-fan Jiang Biwei Jiang and Xu agreed to separate in 1935. The following year Jiang renewed her friendship with Chang Tao-fan (Zhang Daofan) who she had known in Paris in the 1920s. Chang had married but he had always admired Jiang and now the two of them exchanged love letters. It was said that the Japanese were to bomb the city so Chang Tao-fan arranged for her to leave the city and join him in Chongqing. Here they were able to correspond more freely but Jiang could never meet formally except at official functions. Chang still had a French wife and a child. Chang was vice-minister of education and Jiang was able to re-use the skills she learnt in Paris by teaching French at the local university. In 1938 Xu published in the local newspaper that Jiang and his relationship had now ended, the relationship did not end formally. In 1943 Jiang staged an exhibition in Chongqing of her art collection, which included nearly three dozen of Xu's paintings. This exhibition damaged her husband's reputation with his peers. In 1944 Xu again published in the newspaper that his relationship with Jiang had ended. He followed it three days later with an engagement announcement. Jiang's parents had both died and that year her son decided to leave and join the army. Jiang blamed this on his broken home. Jiang saw that this was time to formally end her marriage and she requested a substantial settlement. Xu agreed to her terms but devaluation of the currency meant that the terms were not as attractive as Jiang had expected. Chang's French wife was a difficulty in Chinese society and Chang sent her abroad for some years. Chinese students who had brought back foreign wives were considered foolish. Jiang Biwei moved to Taiwan when the Kuomintang government lost the Chinese Civil War and retreated to the island. Chang Tao-fan later became President of the Legislative Yuan (equivalent to Premier) of the Republic of China on Taiwan. They lived together for ten years, but never appeared together in public. In 1958, Chang's wife returned to Taiwan, and Jiang left his life. When Chang Tao-fan published his memoirs, he did not mention Jiang Biwei at all. He died in 1968. Jiang published the memoir Reminiscences of Jiang Biwei in 1964. Composed of two volumes, Beihong and I and Daofan and I, the book revealed details of her relationships with both Xu Beihong and Chang Tao-fan, and was thought to be detrimental to Chang's reputation. On 16 December 1978, Jiang died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Taipei. ==Legacy== Xu Beihong painted several portraits of Jiang Biwei, including a 1933 painting which is now in Kyoto. Their son, Xu Boyang, signed an affidavit that another portrait that had been found was of his mother. The painting of the nude Jiang was then sold for approximately $11m in 2010 at Beijing Jiuge Auctions. After the sale it was claimed that the painting was not by Xu Beihong, but rather was a piece created in 1983 by a student at the Central Academy of Fine Arts. ==References== Category:1899 births Category:1978 deaths Category:People from Yixing Category:Writers from Wuxi Category:Chinese women writers Category:Chinese Civil War refugees Category:Taiwanese people from Jiangsu Category:Republic of China people born during Qing ","title":"Jiang Biwei"},{"id":"46297308","text":"Jean-Paul Schroeder is a French philatelist who was added to the Roll of Distinguished Philatelists in 1990.Background notes on The Roll of Distinguished Philatelists September 2011, Roll of Distinguished Philatelists Trust, London, 2011.

It is funded by its members. It is a grassroots legislative advocacy group dedicated to making communities safer and upholding constitutional rights of those labelled sex offenders by advocating for fact-based, common-sense laws. ATAT is part of the growing movement to reform sex offender laws in the United States. The mission of this organization is to develop a cooperative sense of community rather than take an adversarial approach between people on the sex offender registry, victim's advocacy groups and the authorities in the state. Arkansas Time After Time is state affiliate of National RSOL, and one of the more than 50 organizations seeking to reform sex offender registration-related laws in US. Their name is reference to time those labelled as sex offenders have to serve under public registries and constantly changing requirements after serving their court imposed sentences. ==Purpose== Arkansas Time After Time aims to educate law-makers and public that sex offenders are diverse group of individuals; that contrary to popular belief, general recidivism rate of 5% over 5 years is the second lowest of all offender groups; and that residency restrictions and public notification have no demonstrable effect on recidivism and might actually undermine public safety, thus making onerous restrictions and stigmatizing effect of public sex offender lists unfair and unfounded when applied broadly to all offenders without considering the individual risk and underlying facts of individual cases. Arkansas Time After Time's goal is to help make communities safer and to protect children. In order to do this, it aims to educate the public and legislators to differentiate between those truly dangerous repeat violent sexual predators and those who at some time in their past committed a sex-related offense, served their sentence, completed or are currently undergoing treatment, and are working to re-integrate into society. ATAT holds that public registries have gone far beyond their original intent of protecting children and tracking violent sexual predators. It lobbies for fact based sex offender registry and policies to take account these differences instead of emotion based policies that may do more harm than good, and seeks to educate law-makers and the public of the stigma and other adverse effects some registrants and their families are unnecessarily experiencing due to current blanket policies. ATAT holds that current public registries are not effective and put registrants and their families in danger of vigilante attacks. ==Advocacy== Arkansas Time After Time hosts a weekly radio show called \\"It Could Be You\\" on KABF 88.3fm. In 2013, the group testified against Senate Bill 12 aimed to restrict where some sex offenders are allowed to go, saying it would punish the children and other family members of the registrants. In February 2015, ATAT demanded local authorities to stop disclosing full addresses of registrants, when Arkansas law allows disclosing only block numbers. As a result of this campaign 17 of 24 local sheriff offices removed the full addresses from their web sites. ==See also== *Alliance for Constitutional Sex Offense Laws *Reform Sex Offender Laws, Inc. *Florida Action Committee *Advocates For Change *California Reform Sex Offender Laws *USA FAIR, Inc. *Illinois Voices for Reform *Michigan Citizens for Justice *Women Against Registry - W.A.R ==References *arkansastimeaftertime.org *Reform Sex Offender Laws, Inc. *Registrants and Families Support Line Category:Sex offender registration Category:Non-profit organizations based in Arkansas Category:Civil liberties advocacy groups in the United States ","title":"Arkansas Time After Time"},{"id":"46297372","text":"Some online news media have created Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to enable computer applications to request stories and information about their stories (metadata) from them. == List of 1st-party news APIs == {  - !

Kennedy and produced by Atit Shah. The film stars Russ Russo, Natasha Alam, Doug E. Doug, Joseph R. Gannascoli, Robert Miano and Kiowa Gordon. The story follows a recently returned veteran who tries to put his life back together, but is drawn to deeds that may be more dangerous than his tour of duty. February, 2014, Indiewire and Collider reported that the project was the first film to ever release on Kickstarter prior to a theatrical and Video on Demand run.

Locklear ==Production== Development Ryan M. Kennedy directed the film from a script he spent two years developing while working full-time as a waiter at a Midtown Manhattan restaurant. He showed the finished draft to a French cinematographer Nicolas Canton living in New York City and the two began planning to produce the film with a small sum of their own money. After receiving a copy of the script in January 2011, a local producer, Atit Shah offered to partner with Kennedy and the two began to work on expanding the scope of the project. Casting Shortly after securing the rights to the script, Shah sent the screenplay over to actor Russ Russo, whom Shah had met several years prior at the Cannes Film Festival. The production signed Russo in February 2011. Casting Director Rita Powers round out the remaining cast with Natasha Alam, Doug E. Doug, Joseph R. Gannascoli, Robert Miano, and Kiowa Gordon. Filming Principal photography took place in March 2011, in New York City, predominately in Brooklyn's Vinegar Hill and East Williamsburg neighborhoods. Kennedy had rented a production space in Brooklyn prior to meeting Shah, an expense Shah felt was unnecessary. Unable to break the lease, production designer Robert Dancy converted the raw space into two different key locations within the movie and the space proved to be a big win for production. The film was shot on the Arri Alexa over a period of 32 days. Additional filming took place in various locations around Manhattan, and in upstate NY near Red Hook. ==Release and reception== The film was released on Video on Demand and DVD March 31, 2015 and on Netflix July 15, 2015.

The battle resulted in the near-complete destruction of the Virginia State Navy as well as a large stockpile of Virginian tobacco (in use as a currency at the time). ==Action== With American troops having been driven from Petersburg at the Battle of Blandford, and the tobacco stored the having been destroyed, on April 27, the British Army left in search of fresh supplies. British General William Phillips, with the light- infantry, and part of the j√§gers, and of the cavalry of the Queen's Rangers, marched to Chesterfield Court House, where he destroyed a range of barracks which could accommodate two thousand men, three hundred barrels of flour, and other stores. At the same time, General Benedict Arnold moved to Osborne's, a small village on the south side of the James River, about south of Richmond, with the Seventy-sixth and Eightieth regiments, part of the Yagers and of the Queen's Rangers, and the American Legion. Osborne's was the rendezvous of the small force of the Virginia State Navy which had been collected with the intention of co-operating with the French fleet in a projected attempt against Portsmouth. It appears somewhat singular that it should have been allowed to remain in so exposed a situation while the enemy remained within striking distance. The British conducted their movements in secret, taking care that no information of their should reach the Americans. Consequently, the British forces came into their immediate vicinity of the Americans before their presence was known. Arnold summoned the American commander to surrender, \\"offering one half the contents of their cargoes in case they did not destroy any part.\\" The nameless American commander sent word, in answer, \\"We are determined and ready to defend our ships, and will sink them rather than surrender.\\" On the receipt of this reply, General Arnold ordered two three- pounders, under Lieutenant Rogers, to open a fire on the stern of Tempest a state ship mounting twenty guns. Captain Page, with two six-pounders, \\"opened from an unexpected quarter, with great effect.\\" At the same time Lieutenant Spencer led a party of Yagers, \\"by a route partly covered with ditches, within thirty yards of her stern,\\" in order that all who showed themselves on deck might be picked off. Tempest, Renown of twenty-six guns, Jefferson of fourteen guns, and some smaller vessels, as well as by a body of Virginia militia, who occupied the northern bank of the river, all opened a brisk fire. When the greatly superior force of the British forces is considered, the contest was too unequal to be either long-continued or successful to the Americans. A shot from one of the British pieces cut Tempests cable; she sheered around, and exposed herself to a raking fire from Lieutenant Rogers' three-pounders; the crew, taking to the boats, attempted to escape. As the British had no boats, and the wind was blowing quite hard, Arnold could not take advantage of the panic into which the entire squadron appears to have fallen. The British captured two ships, three brigs, two schooners, and five sloops, all laden with tobacco, flour, cordage, etc.,. They burned or sank four ships, five brigs, and several smaller vessels, similarly laden. Upwards of two thousand hogsheads of tobacco, besides other stores, were destroyed, without any loss to the British, and if any loss, except that of the property, was sustained by the Virginians, it has not been recorded. The result of these predatory expeditions was a terrible blow to Virginia, ‚Äî her tobacco being her circulating medium, ‚Äî and, indirectly, to the cause of America. In the ensuing days, Philips and Arnold marched northward until stopping in Manchester, Virginia (a port town across the James River from Richmond).The life of Frederick William von Steuben p. 427, https://archive.org/details/lifeoffrederickw00kappuoft ==Citation and references== Citations References *Henry B.

The Chief was the subject of a protracted development time line. The company explained the long development, \\"we were determined not to put a product on the market before its time. We have seen other kits sold that did not complete their development and testing. Their customers paid for completion of the development and in reality did much of their testing.. By delaying our availability project until it was truly completed, we will avoid placing unnecessary a lot of \\"Airworthiness Directives\\" and flight restrictions on our aircraft.\\" In December 2005 first kit delivery was forecast for as early as January 2006, with a production rate of eight to ten per month and a first- year production of 50 to 60 kits expected for 2006.

The company seems to have gone out of business in late 2008. ==Operational history== By April 2015 two examples were registered in the United States with the Federal Aviation Administration, although both registrations had expired. A total of three Chiefs had been registered at one time. On 28 September 2006 a Chief crashed while hovering, with minor injuries to the pilot and passenger. The National Transportation Safety Board report stated, \\"The amateur built helicopter impacted the ground during a test flight following the failure of a welded joint at a cyclic control cable bracket resulting in a loss of control authority. A post impact fire ensued, destroying the helicopter. The pilot reported he was in a low hover when the tail came up and the helicopter tilted. One of the skids subsequently caught the ground causing the helicopter to roll over.

Rowling reads from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone at the Easter Egg Roll at the White House. The British author J. K. Rowling, known for writing Harry Potter and other Wizarding World works, has a variety of political views. Rowling stated in 2000 that she is left-wing and said \\"there is a certain amount of political stuff in [Harry Potter]. But I also feel that every reader will bring his own agenda to the book. People who send their children to boarding schools seem to feel that I'm on their side. I'm not. Practicing Wiccans think I'm also a witch. I'm not.\\" Jensen, Jeff. \\"'Fire' Storm\\", Entertainment Weekly, 7 September 2000 In 2002, she said her biggest literary influence was muckraker Jessica Mitford, whom she described as a \\"self-taught socialist\\". Rowling has garnered attention for her support of the Labour Party under Gordon Brown and criticism under Jeremy Corbyn, as well as her opposition to the Conservative Party and the Republican Party under Donald Trump. She opposed Scottish independence in a 2014 referendum, and opposed Brexit during the 2016 referendum to leave the European Union. On the topic of transgender people, Rowling has opposed terms such as \\"people who menstruate\\". She said that she was a survivor of domestic abuse and sexual assault, and stated that \\"When you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms to any man who believes or feels he‚Äôs a woman ... then you open the door to any and all men who wish to come inside\\", while stating that most trans people were vulnerable and deserved protection. These views have been praised by some feminists and criticised by organisations including GLAAD and Mermaids. ==UK politics== J. K. Rowling has been a long-time friend of former Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his wife Sarah Brown. In September 2008, Rowling donated ¬£1 million to the Labour Party, saying: > I believe that poor and vulnerable families will fare much better under the > Labour Party than they would under a Cameron-led Conservative Party. Gordon > Brown has consistently prioritised and introduced measures that will save as > many children as possible from a life lacking in opportunity or choice. The > Labour government has reversed the long-term trend in child poverty, and is > one of the leading EU countries in combating child poverty. David Cameron's > promise of tax perks for the married, on the other hand, is reminiscent of > the Conservative government I experienced as a lone parent. It sends the > message that the Conservatives still believe a childless, dual-income, but > married couple is more deserving of a financial pat on the head than those > struggling, as I once was, to keep their families afloat in difficult times. Rowling praised Brown in a 2009 Time magazine essay saying she \\"still wanted him in charge\\". Rowling wrote about what it meant to be British saying, \\"It means a welfare state of which we should be fiercely proud and a tradition of tolerance and free speech we should defend to our last collective breath.\\" Rowling also praised the National Health Service (NHS).What does it mean to be British? Rowling was critical of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party. Scottish politics Scottish independence campaign As a resident of Scotland, Rowling was eligible to vote in the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, and intended to vote \\"No\\". She donated ¬£1 million (US$1,694,000) to the Better Together anti-independence campaign, led by former neighbour and friend Alistair Darling, and used the \\"Death Eaters\\" characters from her Harry Potter series‚Äîwho reject wizards unless they have pure blood‚Äîas a reference in her blog-post explanation of her donation; Rowling's words are: \\"However, when people try to make this debate about the purity of your lineage, things start getting a little Death Eaterish for my taste.\\" In Rowling's post-donation blog post in mid-June 2014, she explained that she is \\"friendly\\" with members of both campaigns and stated a belief that \\"there are intelligent, thoughtful people on both sides of this question\\". While Rowling concluded that \\"If the majority of people in Scotland want independence I truly hope that it is a resounding success\\" and that her \\"love\\" for Scotland is why she wants it to \\"thrive\\", she explains in the body of her piece that she is concerned about \\"serious risks\\", with Scottish medical research of particular interest to her‚ÄîRowling has donated a large sum of money to multiple sclerosis research after her mother's death from the disease. Rowling's fear was triggered by an open letter co-signed by all five of Scotland's medical schools, in which \\"grave concerns\\" are expressed about the impact of independence upon Scotland's highly regarded medical work. The letter, which says that First Minister Alex Salmond's plans for a common research funding area are \\"fraught with difficulty\\" and \\"unlikely to come to fruition\\", is supported by 14 professors, who all agree that \\"it is highly unlikely that the remaining UK would tolerate a situation in which an independent 'competitor' country won more money than it contributed.\\" The Edinburgh-based National Collective organisation of artists and writers who support independence‚Äî\\"non-party movement for artists and creatives who support Scottish independence\\"‚Äîpublished an open letter in response to Rowling's explanation on 11 June 2014, signed by Teaching Research Assistant and freelancer Mairi McFadyen. McFadyen states that she is \\"saddened\\" by Rowling's position, but asserts that \\"It is not my intention here to rebut your arguments, but rather to offer a response.\\" McFadyen writes that the referendum is \\"the most wonderful gift\\", as citizens of their own country are asked for their opinion about their nation's future, and the \\"referendum question has sparked the imagination of the nation\\". McFadyen concludes with several quotes taken from a speech delivered by Rowling, as well as a poem from Maurice Lindsay, and concludes: \\"We would be delighted to extend an invitation to yourself to attend one of the many Yestival events taking place across Scotland this July.\\" Scottish nationalism In 2018, Rowling tweeted that she was tired of \\"blood and soil ethno-nationalists marching with\\" civic campaigners. She also said that Scottish nationalism \\"contains traces of bigotry\\". Brexit In June 2016, Rowling opposed Brexit and campaigned for the United Kingdom to stay in the European Union, in the run up to the referendum to leave the European Union, stating on her website that, \\"I'm the mongrel product of this European continent and I'm an internationalist. I was raised by a Francophile mother whose family was proud of their part-French heritage ... My values are not contained or proscribed by borders. The absence of a visa when I cross the channel has symbolic value to me. I might not be in my house, but I'm still in my hometown.\\" Rowling expressed concern that \\"racists and bigots\\" were directing parts of the Leave campaign. In a blog post, she added: \\"How can a retreat into selfish and insecure individualism be the right response when Europe faces genuine threats, when the bonds that tie us are so powerful, when we have come so far together? How can we hope to conquer the enormous challenges of terrorism and climate change without cooperation and collaboration?\\" ==US politics== Rowling told a Spanish newspaper in February 2008 that \\"the international political stance of the United States has been wrong in previous years, for its own and for my country... I want a Democrat in the White House. It's sad Obama and Clinton are rivals because they are both great.\\" In 2009, Obama returned the compliment when he met Rowling at a G20 dinner telling her that he had read all her books himself and to his children Sasha and Malia. Rowling advised the 2008 graduating class of Harvard, \\"the great majority of you belong to the world's only remaining superpower. The way you vote, the way you live, the way you protest, the pressure you bring to bear on your government, has an impact way beyond your borders. That is your privilege, and your burden.\\" The Presidential Medal of Freedom was allegedly refused to be awarded to Rowling under George W. Bush, because her writing \\"encouraged witchcraft\\". This was claimed by Matt Latimer, a former speechwriter for Bush, who went on to write a memoir about his time in the administration, although then First Lady Laura Bush had declared a fondness for the books. Rowling made analogies between Donald Trump and Voldemort after the Republican presidential candidate called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States on 7 December 2015. ==Amnesty International== Rowling's employment at Amnesty International made her realise that \\"imagination is what allows us to empathise with people who have suffered horribly and to act on their behalf.\\" The danger of inaction, Rowling said, comes from people who \\"prefer not to exercise their imaginations at all.\\" ==Green values== Rowling was recognised with the Order of the Forest for demanding that 16 publishers around the world print her books using \\"eco- friendly\\" papers. The last book in the Potter series is considered within the industry to be the most environmentally friendly in publishing history.JK Rowling wins the 'Order of the Forest' Financial Post In 2008, Rowling blocked the Finnish publication of her latest Harry Potter novel on paper from Finland because it lacked the ecologically friendly certification she favours. ==Eating disorders== In 2006, Rowling criticised models on her website, describing that their \\"only function in the world appears to be supporting the trade in overpriced handbags and rat-sized dogs.\\" In response to criticism over the connotations of weight within Harry Potter, Rowling responded that Harry Potter characters who are \\"on the plumper side\\" include \\"several of my most important, admirable and loveable characters\\". She linked to a fan website ‚Äì MuggleNet ‚Äì that lists seven characters who are \\"fat and good\\", three who are \\"fat and bad\\" and claims there are none who are \\"fat and evil\\". However, there were skinny and evil characters in the series. ==Age branding of children's books== Rowling has publicly opposed the labelling of children's books as \\"age appropriate\\". ==Israel== On 22 October 2015, a letter was published in The Guardian signed by Rowling (along with over 150 other figures from arts and politics) opposing the cultural boycott of Israel, and announcing the creation of a network for dialogue, called Culture for Coexistence. Rowling later explained her position in more detail, saying that although she opposed most of Benjamin Netanyahu's actions she did not think the cultural boycott would bring about the removal of Israel's leader or help improve the situation in Israel and Palestine. ==European migrant crisis== In 2015, Rowling expressed support for refugees. By 2017, a petition asking her to shelter immigrants on her property acquired over 60,000 signatures. ==Abortion== Rowling expressed her opposition to Mexico City Policy, when it was reinstated by Donald Trump, and said that she supported abortion rights, especially in Third World countries. ==Transgender people== On 19 December 2019, Rowling tweeted her support for Maya Forstater, who lost her employment tribunal against her former employer, the Center for Global Development. Forstater's contract was not renewed after she tweeted \\"men cannot change into women\\", and at the tribunal she asserted that her \\"gender critical\\" beliefs should be protected under the Equality Act 2010. However, the tribunal judge ruled against her, describing her views as \\"absolutist\\". On 6 June 2020, Rowling criticised a Devex article's use of the phrase \\"people who menstruate\\" instead of the word \\"women\\". She went on to tweet, \\"If sex isn't real, there's no same-sex attraction. If sex isn't real, the lived reality of women globally is erased\\", while also saying she was \\"empathetic to trans people\\". The term \\"people who menstruate\\" is used to include some trans men and non-binary people who also menstruate. The media advocacy group GLAAD called the tweets \\"anti-trans\\" and \\"cruel\\", and wrote: \\"JK Rowling continues to align herself with an ideology which willfully distorts facts about gender identity and people who are trans. In 2020, there is no excuse for targeting trans people.\\" Several actors known for portraying Rowling's characters criticised her views or spoke in support of trans rights, including Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Eddie Redmayne, Evanna Lynch, Bonnie Wright and Katie Leung, as did the fansites MuggleNet and The Leaky Cauldron. Actress Noma Dumezweni initially expressed support for Rowling but rescinded her stance following backlash. Radcliffe responded on behalf of The Trevor Project, writing: \\"Transgender women are women. Any statement to the contrary erases the identity and dignity of transgender people and goes against all advice given by professional health care associations who have far more expertise on this subject matter than either Jo or I.\\" Rowling later published an essay on her website in response to the criticism. She said that she was a survivor of domestic abuse and sexual assault, and stated that \\"When you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms to any man who believes or feels he‚Äôs a woman ... then you open the door to any and all men who wish to come inside\\", while stating that most trans people were vulnerable and deserved protection. She also wrote that many women consider terms like \\"people who menstruate\\" to be demeaning. Among those who disputed the claims in Rowling's essay were Mermaids, a charity organisation for gender non-conforming children, who refuted the notion that trans people are predatory, and CEO of GLAAD Sarah Kate Ellis who said it could create a dangerous environment for the trans community. However, she has received support from actors Robbie Coltrane and Brian Cox, and some feminists such as Ayaan Hirsi Ali. The radical feminist Julie Bindel stated that Rowling has always been a feminist and has inspired people \\"to look into issues of sex-based discrimination\\". On 19 June 2020, the Equality Act was blocked in the US Senate after Republican senator James Lankford opposed it, citing Rowling's essay as part of his reasoning. Also in June 2020, four authors, including Owl Fisher, resigned in protest from the Blair Partnership, Rowling's literary agency, after the company refused to issue a public statement of support for transgender rights, saying that \\"freedom of speech can only be upheld if the structural inequalities that hinder equal opportunities for underrepresented groups are challenged and changed.\\" Following the threat of legal action, British children's news website The Day publicly apologised to Rowling after publishing an article that suggested her comments caused harm to and attacked trans people, made comparisons between Rowling's views and those of Wagner on race and Picasso on women, and called for her work to be boycotted. The publication also agreed to pay an unsubstantiated sum to a charity of Rowling's choice. In August 2020, Rowling returned her Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights (RFKHR) Award, after RFKHR president Kerry Kennedy called her statements \\"deeply troubling\\" and \\"transphobic\\". She further argued that Rowling's words \\"had the effect of degrading trans people‚Äôs lived experiences\\". Rowling stated that she was \\"deeply saddened\\" to be returning the award, reiterating her admiration for Robert Kennedy, but said that no award \\"means so much to me that I would forfeit the right to follow the dictates of my own conscience.\\" On 15 September 2020, her novel Troubled Blood was released, and received criticism for its portrayal of a murderous cisgender man who dresses as a woman. A spokesperson for the charity Mermaids condemned the novel for \\"tired tropes\\" that demonize trans people by presenting them as a threat. A review in The Guardian stated that that character \\"is just one of many suspects\\" and that he isn't \\"portrayed as trans or even called a 'transvestite' by Rowling.\\" On 22 September 2020, Rowling encouraged her Twitter followers to purchase from the Wild Womyn Workshop, an online store run by a co-founder of the lesbian separatist group Get the L Out. A section of the store sells anti-trans merchandise. On 27 September 2020, a letter in support of Rowling, signed by 58 \\"entertainers and authors\\", including the author Ian McEwan, actress Frances Barber, playwright Tom Stoppard and actor and writer Griff Rhys Jones, was published in The Sunday Times. The letter condemned the \\"onslaught of abuse\\" directed at Rowling on social media, describing such behaviour as an \\"insidious, authoritarian and misogynistic trend\\". Actor Eddie Redmayne similarly condemned the abuse targeted at Rowling, whilst also condemning the \\"hideous torrent of abuse towards trans people online and out in the world\\". In an interview with New Statesman, philosopher and gender theorist Judith Butler agreed that Rowling should not be subject to online abuse, but urged people to also oppose abuse, online and in person, against trans people. ==Open letter on justice and open debate== In July 2020, Rowling signed an open letter published in Harper's Magazine titled \\"A Letter on Justice and Open Debate,\\" with 150 other public figures, largely writers and academics. The letter states in part, \\"The free exchange of information and ideas, the lifeblood of a liberal society, is daily becoming more constricted\\", criticises \\"a vogue for public shaming and ostracism\\" and \\"a blinding moral certainty\\", warns of fear spreading in the arts and media, and denounces President Donald Trump as \\"a real threat to democracy\\". The letter sparked much debate about cancel culture (public criticism calling for censure of prominent people over their controversial actions or opinions). Rowling stated she was proud to sign the letter to defend \\"open debate and freedom of thought and speech\\". Objections to the letter included accusations that Rowling and the other signatories had powerful means to publish their opinions, and that it was disingenuous to attempt to silence others who might offer criticism of their views. Some thought that Rowling was trying to specifically suppress criticism about her statements concerning transgender topics. After learning who also signed the letter, Jennifer Finney Boylan expressed regret over her support, and stated she would not have signed had she known who the other signatories were. Rowling then sarcastically tweeted that Boylan should incur public penance for her association with her. Stanford Law professor Richard Thompson Ford, a signatory to the letter, stated it should not matter who has signed because it did not mean they all endorsed the entire gamut of viewpoints and deeds of their co-signatories. Writer Bari Weiss said she was proud to stand with Rowling and the other signatories. Several of the signers also defended their letter, saying there is a very diverse group of people supporting their stand against excessive retribution by what they called the \\"forces of illiberalism\\". ==References== Category:J.

This community increased in the post-war period as Japanese persons wished to re-establish themselves in a new city. ==History== In 1942 the Canadian government forced ethnic Japanese to move from areas on the West Coast of Canada, so many moved to Montreal. The authors of \\"The Chameleon Character of Multilingual Literacy Portraits: Researching in \\"Heritage\\" Language Places and Spaces\\" stated that in the immediate post-World War II period, the Japanese in Montreal had a \\"long invisible presence\\".Maguire, et al, p. 161. Reiko Yoshida, the author of the PhD thesis \\"Political economy, transnationalism, and identity : students at the Montreal Hoshuko,\\" interviewed a Japanese Canadian at the Montreal Japanese Canadian Cultural Centre; according to the interview many Japanese arrived in Montreal since they could get a fresh start and not stand out.Maguire, p. 1440 (PDF p. 18/24). Due to requests from Japanese national parents, the Montreal Hokusho School opened in 1972. The Japanese population increased in the 1970s. The opening of two Japanese schools, including Montreal Hokusho, and economic expansion in both Japan and Montreal contributed to the expansion of the Japanese population.Maguire, et al, p. 161-162. ==Geographic distribution== As of 2003 there was no particular place where ethnic Japanese were concentrated.Maguire, p. 1439 (PDF p. 17/24). E. Bourgault wrote in Perspectives on the Japanese Canadian Experience in Quebec (Repartir a Zero; Perspectives sur/ L‚ÄôExperience des Canadiens d‚ÄôOrigine Japonaise au Quebec) that Japanese in Montreal historically \\"lived relatively anonymously\\" and that they \\"have avoided visible concentration as a collective, hoping to blend in, unnoticed into the larger population.\\"Maguire, p. 1438 (PDF p. 16/24). ==Demographics== Tomoko Makebe stated in The Canadian Sansei that the 1991 Canadian Census indicated that 2,360 Japanese Canadians resided in Montreal. This figure remained constant, around 2,000, as of the 2011 Census.Crump, p. 118. As of 2003 the Japanese community of Montreal was smaller than that of the city's Armenian and Chinese communities, and as of 2014 the ethnic Japanese make up less than 1% of the city's population. According to the 2011 Census, 510 of the Japanese people in Montreal spoke Japanese at home and a total of 1,280 indicated that Japanese was their native language, meaning that more than 50% of the total number of ethnic Japanese in Montreal do not speak Japanese at home. Dr. Alison Crump, author of the PhD thesis \\"'But your face, it looks like you‚Äôre English': LangCrit and the experiences of multilingual Japanese-Canadian children in Montr√©al,\\" noted that these Census figures should be interpreted as estimates since the data do not indicate whether racially mixed children with one Japanese parent are counted in the figures. She noted that many Japanese in the city are in relationships with non- Japanese, which could contribute to the low percentage of individuals who reported speaking Japanese at home. As of 2014 Japanese nationals who study and/or work in Montreal and recent immigrants to Canada make up large portions of ethnic Japanese in the city. Many of the recent immigrants have married Canadian persons.Crump, p. 119. ==Institutions== The various Japanese organizations in Montreal provide cohesion for the Japanese community.Maguire, p. 1438-1439 (PDF p. 16-17/24). \\"Although Japanese Canadians have lived relatively anonymously in Montreal since they arrived in the early forties, they have always maintained contact with each other through various community organizations and groups.

Wilderman Medical Clinic is a multidisciplinary medical clinic located in Thornhill, Ontario, Canada. The clinic focuses on pain management care to patients in Thornhill and throughout the Greater Toronto Area. Treatment provided by this clinic is funded by the province of Ontario. ==History== Wilderman Medical Clinic was founded by Dr. Igor Wilderman and his wife Victoria Heifets. It opened in Richmond Hill in January 2005, and is currently located on 8054 Yonge Street in old Thornhill. The clinic was initially operated as a family practice with a focus on allergy and comprehensive pain management services, including optimization of medications, epidural injections, nerve blocks, intraarticular injections, chiropractic therapy, acupuncture, and massage therapy. This clinic still focuses on services in interventional pain management. It also provides services in other areas of medicine, including family medicine, diagnostic imaging, medical/legal services, psychotherapy, allergy testing, chiropractic, naturopathy, medical cosmetics, massage, and acupuncture. ==Clinical Trials== Contributions to independent medical research are also made at this facility. The Canadian Centre for Clinical Trials is affiliated with Wilderman Medical Clinic. It was the first clinical trials recruitment centre in Canada. The Canadian Centre for Clinical Trials is responsible for Canada-wide patient recruitment for clinical trials and operates as a site for Phase Ib, II, III and IV clinical trials. Original research of clinic physicians leading to new pain management treatments is also conducted by the Canadian Centre for Clinical Trials. ==Education Initiatives== As part of an educational initiative for the general public, Wilderman Medical Clinic and Canadian Centre for Clinical Trials publish an online magazine called Medical News Bulletin. The magazine disseminates medical news and discusses the findings of worldwide clinical trials research worldwide. It also informs readers about ongoing clinical trial developments, including new medications and new medical devices for patients and physicians. Wilderman Medical Clinic also offers complementary Diabetes and Fibromyalgia education programs for all government funded and private patients. ==Incorporating Recent Evidence== The clinic has introduced personalized DNA based diets, which is backed by an international research program conducted by the University of Toronto. This research demonstrates that individualized diets are more effective than following general diet guidelines. The clinic is also performing DNA based drug prescriptions, developed by Geneyouin, for its pain management treatments. ==References * Wilderman Medical Clinic Category:Buildings and structures in Vaughan Category:Medical and health organizations based in Ontario ","title":"Wilderman Medical Clinic"},{"id":"46297820","text":"Isaac Heeney (born 5 May 1996) is a professional Australian rules footballer playing with the Sydney Swans in the Australian Football League. ==Early life== Heeney grew up in the Hunter Region of New South Wales and received primary level education at Black Hill Public School. He then attended All Saints College before completing his education at Waverley College in Sydney while playing for the Swans Academy. He began playing soccer at the age of 7 and managed to kick 68 goals in 12 games. Shortly after he picked up a cricket bat and played an age level above his own. He had a batting average of 216. He also travelled with his school to compete in a Sydney rugby league tournament and scored 5 tries in his team's grand final victory.Backyard bruises gave hard edge to HeeneyIsaac Heeney 'just wants to play footy' as draft debate rages Heeney played his junior football for the Cardiff Hawks in the Black Diamond Australian Football League. A highly rated junior player, he joined the Sydney Swans' academy at the age of 12 years and was selected by the Swans in the 2014 AFL draft. His selection was controversial in that the Melbourne Football Club bid their first selection, number 2 overall, for Heeney but under drafting rules at the time, the Swans were able to match with their first selection, which was 18th overall. As a result of this, and the similar round based bidding process used for father‚Äìson rule selections, the draft criteria was changed to a points based system to provide for a more equitable outcome. Heeney later revealed he was the only student throughout his entire schooling that played Australian rules football and would have quit in favour of rugby league had the Swans' academy not existed. He grew up supporting the Swans and idolised Ryan O'Keefe as a child. ==AFL career== Heeney made his debut for Sydney at ANZ Stadium against Essendon in Round 1 of the 2015 season. He kicked his first AFL goal, which was also the match-winning goal and last in the match, late in the final quarter as the Swans came from 41 points down in the third quarter to win by 12 points. Following a 4-goal performance at the Sydney Cricket Ground in round 3, Heeney picked up an AFL Rising Star nomination as the Swans got off to an unbeaten start in the 2015 season. ==Statistics== : Statistics are correct to the end of the 2016 season - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2015   5  14  16  10  120  57  177  67  44  1.1  0.7  8.6  4.1  12.6  4.8  3.1 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2016   5  24  28  15  218  180  398  113  92  1.2  0.6  9.1  7.5  16.6  4.7  3.8 - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3 Career ! 38 ! 44 ! 25 ! 338 ! 237 ! 575 ! 180 ! 136 ! 1.2 ! 0.7 ! 8.9 ! 6.2 ! 15.1 ! 4.7 ! 3.6 } ==ReferencesCategory:1996 births Category:Sydney Swans players Category:Australian rules footballers from New South Wales Category:NSW/ACT Rams players Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Newcastle, New South Wales ","title":"Isaac Heeney"},{"id":"46297825","text":"The multi-fractional order estimator (MFOE)Bell, J.

The MFOE offers two major advances: (1) minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) with fractions of estimated coefficients (useful in target tracking) and (2) describing the effect of deterministic OLS processing of statistical inputs (of value in econometrics) ==Description== Consider equally time spaced noisy measurement samples of a target trajectory described by y_n = \\\\sum_{j=1} ^J c_j n^{j-1} + \\\\eta_n= x_n + \\\\eta_n where n represents both the time samples and the index; the polynomial describing the trajectory is of degree J-1; and \\\\eta_n is zero mean, stationary, white noise (not necessarily Gaussian) with variance \\\\sigma_n ^2. Estimating x(t) at time \\\\tau with the MFOE is described by \\\\hat x (\\\\tau) = \\\\sum_{n=1}^{N} y_n w_n (\\\\tau) where the hat (^) denotes an estimate, N is the number of samples in the data window, \\\\tau is the time of the desired estimate, and the data weights are w_n (\\\\tau) = \\\\sum _m U_{mn} T_m (\\\\tau) f_m The U_{mn} are orthogonal polynomial coefficient estimators. T_{m}(\\\\tau) (a function detailed in) projects the estimate of the polynomial coefficient c_m to the desired estimation time \\\\tau. The MFOE parameter 0‚â§f_m‚â§1 can apply a fraction of the projected coefficient estimate. The combined terms U_{mn}T_m effectively constitute a novel set of expansion functions with coefficients f_m. The MFOE can be optimized at time \\\\tau as a function of the f_ms for given measurement noise, target dynamics, and non-recursive sliding data window size, N. However, for all f_m=1, the MFOE reduces and is equivalent to the KF in the absence of process noise, and to the standard polynomial LSM. As in the case of coefficients in conventional series expansions, the f_ms typically decrease monotonically as higher order terms are included to match complex target trajectories. For example, in the f_ms monotonically decreased in the MFOE from f_1=1 to f_5 \\\\gtrsim 0 , where f_m = 0 for m ‚âß 6. The MFOE in consisted of five point, 5th order processing of composite real (but altered for declassification) cruise missile data. A window of only 5 data points provided excellent maneuver following; whereas, 5th order processing included fractions of higher order terms to better approximate the complex maneuvering target trajectory. The MFOE overcomes the long-ago rejection of terms higher than 3rd order because, taken at full value (i.e., f_{m}s=1), estimator variances increase exponentially with linear order increases. (This is elucidated below in the section \\"Application of the FOE\\".) ==Fractional order estimator== As described in, the MFOE can be written more efficiently as \\\\hat x = <\\\\psi,\\\\omega_m> where the estimator weights w_n(\\\\tau) of order m are components of the estimating vector \\\\omega_m (\\\\tau). By definition \\\\hat x \\\\doteq \\\\hat x(\\\\tau) and \\\\omega_m\\\\doteq \\\\omega_m(\\\\tau). The angle brackets and comma <,> denote the inner product, and the data vector \\\\psi comprises noisy measurement samples y_n. Perhaps the most useful MFOE tracking estimator is the simple fractional order estimator (FOE) where f_1=f_2=1 and f_m=0 for all m > 3, leaving only 0\\\\le f_3 \\\\le 1 . This is effectively an FOE of fractional order 2+f_3, which linear interpolates between the 2nd and 3rd order estimators described in) as w_{2+f_{3}}=(1-f_3) \\\\omega_2 +f_3 \\\\omega_3 = \\\\omega_2 + f_3 (\\\\omega_3-\\\\omega_2)=\\\\omega_2+f_3 u_3 where the scalar fraction f_3 is the linear interpolation factor, the vector u_3=\\\\omega_3-\\\\omega_2= \\\\upsilon_3T_3, and \\\\upsilon_3 (which comprises the components U_{3n}) is the vector estimator of the 3rd polynomial coefficient c_3\\\\equiv\\\\tfrac{a\\\\Delta^2}{2} (a is acceleration and Œî is the sample period). The vector u_3 is the acceleration estimator from \\\\omega_3. The mean-square error (MSE) from the FOE applied to an accelerating target is MSE=\\\\sigma_\\\\eta ^2(\\\\omega_2^2+f_3^2 u_3^2)+[c_3T_3(1-f_3)]^2, where for any vector \\\\theta,  \\\\theta ^2 \\\\doteq<\\\\theta,\\\\theta> . The first term on the right of the equal sign is the FOE target location estimator variance \\\\sigma_\\\\eta ^2(\\\\omega_2^2+f_3^2 u_3^2) composed of the 2nd order location estimator variance and part of the variance from the 3rd order acceleration estimator as determined by the interpolation factor squared f_3^2. The second term is the bias squared [c_3T_3(1-f_3)]^2 from the 2nd order target location estimator as a function of acceleration in c_3. Setting the derivative of the MSE with respect to f_3 equal to zero and solving yields the optimal f_3: f_{3,opt} \\\\doteq f_{3,opt}(\\\\tau)= \\\\frac {(c_3 T_3)^2} {(c_3 T_3)^2 + \\\\sigma_\\\\eta ^2  u_3^2} = \\\\frac {c_3^2} {c_3^2 + \\\\sigma_\\\\eta^2\\\\upsilon_3^2}= \\\\frac {\\\\rho_3^2} {\\\\rho_3^2+\\\\upsilon_3^2} where \\\\rho_3\\\\equiv \\\\frac {c_3}{\\\\sigma_\\\\eta}=\\\\frac {a\\\\Delta^2} {2\\\\sigma_\\\\eta} , as defined in. The optimal FOE is then very simply w_{2+f_{3,opt}}=\\\\omega_2+f_{3,opt} u_3=\\\\omega_2+\\\\upsilon_3 T_3f_{3,opt}= \\\\omega_2+\\\\upsilon_3T_3\\\\frac {\\\\rho_3^2} {\\\\rho_3^2+\\\\upsilon_3^2} Substituting the optimal FOE into the MSE yields the minimum MSE: MSE_{min}=\\\\sigma_\\\\eta ^2(\\\\omega_2^2+f_{3,opt} u_3^2) Although not obvious, the MSE_{min} includes the bias squared. The variance in the FOE MSE is the quadratic interpolation between the 2nd and the 3rd order location estimator variances as a function of f_{3,opt}^2. Whereas, the MSE_{min} is the linear interpolation between the same 2nd and the 3rd order location estimator variances as a function of f_{3,opt}. The bias squared accounts for the difference. ==Application of the FOE== Since a target's future location is generally of more interest than where it is or has been, consider one-step prediction. Normalized with respect to measurement noise variance, the MSE for equally spaced samples reduces for the predicted position to MSE = \\\\frac {1} {N}+\\\\frac {3(N+1)} {N(N-1)}+ f_3^2\\\\frac {5(N+1)(N+2)}{N ((N-1)(N-2)}+\\\\rho_3^2 \\\\left [\\\\frac {(N+1)(N+2)}{6}\\\\right ] ^2 (1-f_3)^2 where N is the number of samples in the non-recursive sliding data window. Note that the first term on the right of the equal sign is the variance from estimating the first coefficient (position); the second term is the variance from estimating the 2nd coefficient (velocity); and the 3rd term with f_3 = 1 is the variance from estimating the 3rd coefficient (which includes acceleration). This pattern continues for higher order terms. Furthermore, the sum of the variances from estimating the first two coefficients is \\\\frac {4N+2}{N(N-1)}). Adding the variance from estimating the 3rd coefficient yields \\\\frac {9N^2+9N+6}{N(N-1)(N-2)}. Estimator variances obviously increase exponentially with unit order increases. In the absence of process noise, the KF yields variances equivalent to these.Brookner, E., Tracking and Kalman Filtering Made Easy, Wiley, New York, 1998.Kingsley, S. and Quegan, S., Understanding Radar Systems, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1992. (A derivation of the variance from a 1st degree polynomial corresponding to f_3=\\\\rho_3=0 for the generalized case of arbitrary estimation time and sample times is given in reference. In addition, establishing a multi-dimensional tracking gate at the predicted position can easily be aided with the simple approximation of the error function in.) Kalman filter tuning Tuning the KF consists of a trade-off between measurement noise and process noise to minimize the estimation error.Lau, Tak Kit and Lin, Kai-wun, Evolutionary Tuning of Sigma-Point Kalman Filters, Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2011 IEEE International Conference onBernt M. et al., A Tool for Kalman Filter Tuning, http://www.netegrate.com/index_files/Research%20Library/Catalogue/Quantitative%20Analysis/Kalman%20Filter/A%20Tool%20for%20Kalman%20Filter%20Tuning(Akesson,%20Jorgensen%20and%20Poulsen).pdf The KF process noise serves two roles: First, its covariance is sized to account for the maximum expected target acceleration. Second, process noise covariance establishes an effective recursive data window (analogous to the non-recursive sliding data window), described by Brookner as the Kalman filter memory. Contrary to process noise covariance as a single independent parameter in the KF serving two roles, the FOE has the advantage of two separate independent parameters: one for acceleration and the other for sizing the sliding data window. Therefore, as opposed to being limited to just two tuning parameters (process and measurement noises) as is the KF, the FOE includes three independent tuning parameters: measurement noise variance, the assumed maximum deterministic target acceleration (for simplicity both target acceleration and measurement noise are included in the ratio of the single parameter \\\\rho_3), and the number of samples in the data window. Consider tuning a 2nd order predictor applied to the simple and practical tracking example inBlair, W. D., Bar-Shalom, Y., Tracking Maneuvering Targets With Multiple Sensors: Does More Data Always Mean Better Estimates? IEEE T-AES Vol. 32, No.1, Jan. 1996. to minimize the MSE when the target acceleration is 20 m/s^2; the zero mean, stationary, and white measurement noise is described as \\\\sigma_\\\\eta = 25m; and \\\\Delta = 1 second. Thus, \\\\rho_3=\\\\frac {a\\\\Delta^2} {2\\\\sigma_\\\\eta}=20/2/25=0.4 Setting f_3=0 in the normalized prediction MSE yields for the 2nd order predictor applied to an accelerating target, MSE = \\\\frac {4N+2} {N(N-1)}+ \\\\rho_3^2 \\\\left [\\\\frac {(N+1)(N+2)}{6}\\\\right ]^2 where the first term on the right of the equal sign is the normalized 2nd order one- step prediction variance and the second term is the normalized bias squared from acceleration. This MSE is plotted as a function of N in Figure 1 along with both the variance and bias squared. Figure 1 Clearly, only integer order steps are possible in a non-recursive estimator. However, for use in approximating the tuned 2nd order KF, this MSE plot is stepped in tenths of a unit to show more precisely where the minimum occurs. The minimum MSE of 4.09 occurs at N = 2.9. The tuned KF can be approximated by sizing the process noise covariance in the KF such that the effective recursive data window‚Äîi.e., the Kalman filter memory‚Äîmatches N = 2.9 in Figure 1 (i.e., \\\\alpha \\\\approx 0.85 and \\\\beta \\\\approx 0.53), where \\\\alpha = \\\\frac {4N-2} {N(N+1)}and \\\\beta = \\\\frac {6} {N(N+1)}. This hints at the fallacy of using a 2nd order estimator on accelerating targets as described in. Comparing this with the filtered position in demonstrates that the minimum MSE is a function of the time \\\\tau of the desired estimate. FOE as a multiple-model estimator The FOE can be viewed as a non-recursive multiple-model (MM) estimator composed of 2nd and 3rd order estimator models with the fraction 0\\\\le f_3 \\\\le 1 as the interpolation factor. Since the filtered position is generally used for comparisons in the literature, consider now the normalized MSE for the position estimate: MSE = \\\\frac {1} {N}+\\\\frac {3(N-1)} {N(N+1)}+ f_3^2\\\\frac {5(N-1)(N-2)}{N ((N+1)(N+2)}+\\\\rho_3^2 \\\\left [\\\\frac {(N-1)(N-2)}{6}\\\\right ] ^2 (1-f_3)^2 Note that this differs from the one-step prediction MSE in that the signs within the parentheses containing N are reversed. The higher order pattern continues here also. Normalized with respect to the measurement noise variance, the minimum position MSE reduces for equally spaced samples to MSE_{min} = \\\\frac {4N-2} {N(N+1)}+ f_{3,opt}\\\\frac {5(N-1)(N-2)}{N ((N+1)(N+2)} where \\\\upsilon_3^2=\\\\frac {180}{N(N^2-1)(N^2-4)} in f_{3,opt}= \\\\frac {\\\\rho_3^2} {\\\\rho_3^2+\\\\upsilon_3^2} Figure 2 A plot of the position MSE_{min} as a function of N for various values of \\\\rho_3 is shown in Figure 2, where there are several points of interest: First, the 2nd and 3rd order MSEs track each other very closely and bound all the MSE_{min} (interpolated) curves. Second, the curves drop rapidly to a knee. Third, the MSE_{min} curves flatten out beyond the knee yielding virtually no increase in accuracy until they begin to approach the 3rd order MSE (variance). This suggests that choosing a window at the knee of the curve is advantageous‚Äîto be demonstrated below. Figure 3 Consider again the scenario of, in this case as the target maneuvers. After traveling at a constant velocity, the target accelerates at 20 m/s^2 for 20 seconds and then continues again at a constant velocity. At worst case acceleration, \\\\rho_3= 0.4. The MSE_{min} is plotted in Figure 3 of as a function of N. Also shown are the 2nd order MSE as well as the 2nd and 3rd order MSEs (variances only since the bias is zero in each case) similar to those in Figure 2. There is a fifth curve not previously addressed: the variance portion of the optimal MSE. The variance also levels off for several increments of N like the MSE_{min}. Both the variance and MSE_{min} approach the 3rd order variance as N \\\\to \\\\infty. As the acceleration varies from zero to maximum, the MSE is automatically adjusted (no external tinkering or adaptivity) between the variance at \\\\rho_3 = 0 and maximum MSE_{min} at \\\\rho_3 = 0.4. In other words, the MSE rides up and down the quadratic curve of the variance plus bias squared as a function of changes in acceleration \\\\rho_3 for any given value of N in the position estimate: MSE = \\\\frac {4N-2} {N(N+1)}+ \\\\rho_3^2 \\\\left [\\\\frac {(N-1)(N-2)}{6}\\\\right ]^2 Figure 4 Choosing N = 4 at the knee of the MSE_{min} curve in Figure 3 yields the RMSE (square root of the MSE, which is more often used for comparison in the literature) shown in Figure 4. On the other hand, choosing N = 8 yields the second curve in Figure 4. As shown in Figure 3, the optimal 8‚Äìpoint FOE is essentially a 3rd order non-recursive estimator which yields less than 4% RMSE improvement over the optimal 4-point FOE in the case of no acceleration. However, in the case of maximum acceleration the optimal 8-point MSE is markedly volatile and has large error spikes that can confuse a tracker, one spike exceeding the optimal 4-point MSE for worst case acceleration by more than the optimal 4-point MSE exceeds the optimal 8-point MSE in the absence of acceleration. Obviously, higher values of N produce larger error spikes. Since trackers encounter greatest difficulties and often lose track during target maneuvers at maximum acceleration, the much smoother MSE_{min}transition of the optimal 4-point FOE has a major advantage over larger data windows. IMM compared with the optimal FOE The 4-point FOE in Figure 4 yields much smoother MSE transitions than the IMM (as well as the KF) in the parallel 1 Hz case of. It produces no error spikes or volatility as do the 8-point FOE and the IMM. In this example only 4 multiplies, 3 adds, and a window shift are required to implement the 4-point FOE, significantly few operations than required by the IMM or KF. Similar comparisons of several additional MMs from the literature with the optimal FOE are made in Of the KF based MMs, the interacting MM (IMM) is generally considered the state-of-the-art tracking model and usually the method of choice.Yang, Chun, Blasch, Erik, Characteristic Errors of the IMM Algorithm under Three Maneuver Models for an Accelerating Target, Information Fusion, 2008 11th International Conference onGomes, J., An Overview on Target Tracking Using Multiple Model Methods, Masters Thesis, https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/downloadFile/395137804053/thesis.pdf Since two model IMMs are most often used,http://isif.org/fusion/proceedings/fusion02CD/pdffiles/papers/T1D03.pdf consider the following two models: 2nd and 3rd order KFs. The estimated IMM state equation is the sum of the 2nd order KF times the model probability \\\\mu_1(k) plus the 3rd order KF times the model probability \\\\mu_2(k): \\\\hat X(kk) = \\\\hat X_1(kk)\\\\mu_1(k)+\\\\hat X_2 (kk)\\\\mu_2(k) where \\\\hat X_1(kk) represents the 2nd order KF, \\\\hat X_2 (kk) represents the 3rd order KF, and k represents the time increment.Watson, G. A., and Blair, W. D., Interacting Acceleration Compensation Algorithm for Tracking Maneuvering Targets. IEEE T-AES. Vol. 31, No. 3 July 1995.Pitre, Ryan, A Comparison of Multiple-Model Target Tracking Algorithms: University of New Orleans Theses and Dissertation,. December, 2004. Since the model probabilities sum to one, i.e., \\\\mu_1(k)+\\\\mu_2(k)=1; this is actually linear interpolation, where \\\\mu_1(k) is analogous to (1 - f_3) in the FOE and \\\\mu_2(k) is analogous to f_3. Therefore, this two model IMM is analogous to the optimal FOE in that it also interpolates between 2nd and 3rd order estimators. Two model IMM interpolation is formed during each recursive cycle involving the interactively produced model probabilities. As in the case of the FOE, this suggests a more descriptive estimate equal to the sum of the 2nd order KF plus the difference between the 3rd and 2nd order KFs times \\\\mu_2(k) : \\\\hat X(kk) = \\\\hat X_1(kk)+[\\\\hat X_2 (kk)-\\\\hat X_1(kk]\\\\mu_2(k) In this formulation the difference between the 3rd and 2nd order KFs effectively augments the 2nd order KF with a fraction of the estimated target acceleration as a function of \\\\mu_2(k)‚Äîas does f_3 in the FOE. One major difference between the IMM and optimal FOE is that the IMM is not optimum. The IMM model probabilities and interpolation are based on likelihoods and ad hoc transition probabilities with no mechanism for minimizing the MSE. Of course, not being optimum at any time increment k, the IMM cannot achieve the optimal FOE accuracy shown in Figure 2. Moveover, the IMM \\\\mu_2(k) fails to meet the boundary condition of zero to implement the 2nd order estimator in the absence of acceleration, which the FOE f_{3,opt} does. This results from the fact that the likelihoods do not sum to unity even though the model probabilities do. This causes an IMM bias toward a non-existent acceleration and unnecessarily increases the MSE above the 2nd order variance. Another major difference between the IMM and FOE is that the IMM is adaptive whereas the FOE is not. In order to make a reasonable comparison of the IMM with the FOE, reference constructs a non- recursive IMM analogy (IMMA). It includes \\\\mu_2(k) which does go to zero allowing the 2nd order estimator to be implemented. Since the FOE is based on the actual acceleration not a noisy estimate, the acceleration estimate for the IMMA is assumed to be the expected value of the estimate, i.e., the actual acceleration. This is described here as the ideal for the purpose of illustration. These two modifications make the IMMA compatible for comparison with the FOE. Figure 5 The \\\\mu_2(k) based on the expected value or actual acceleration (described here as the ideal \\\\mu_2 where the k is dropped) then varies between zero and one in an S shaped curve as a function of \\\\rho_3, as does f_{3,opt}. This is shown in Figure 5, where a 4-point data window is assumed. Figure 6 Two significant points of interest stand out as shown by the vertical lines. First, the largest deviation of the ideal \\\\mu_2 from f_{3,opt} occurs near \\\\rho_3 = 0.7. Second, the two curves cross near \\\\rho_3 = 1.4. A comparison of the one-step predictor IMMA MSE as a function of ideal \\\\mu_2 with the FOE MSE_{min} is given in Figure 6. For the IMMA, the linear interpolation factor f_3 is replaced in the normalized FOE MSE by the ideal \\\\mu_2 as the interpolation factor for ideal IMMA MSE plotting. Included in Figure 6 for reference are a curve of the 3rd order variance, 2nd order variance, and the 2nd order MSE. The large deviation of \\\\mu_2 from f_{3,opt} in Figure 5 has a profound effect on the ideal IMMA MSE as shown in Figure 6. The ideal IMMA MSE exceeds the FOE MSE most near \\\\rho_3 = 0.7, about where the \\\\mu_2 differs most from f_{3,opt} in Figure 5. In addition, the ideal IMMA MSE exceeds the 3rd order variance most near \\\\rho_3 = 0.85, even though the specific purpose of interpolation in the IMM is to produce an MSE smaller than the 3rd order variance. Nevertheless, as expected, the two MSE curves do osculate near \\\\rho_3 = 1.4, where \\\\mu_2 and f_{3,opt} cross in Figure 5. Figure 7 Furthermore, the MSE is exacerbated in the non-ideal IMMA by adaptivity, as shown in Figure 7 where the IMMA from noisy \\\\mu_2 is superimposed on the curves in Figure 6 (although there is a slight change in scale to accommodate the larger noisy IMMA MSE). Reference describes this in great detail. Clearly, since Figure 6 includes the ideal \\\\mu_2 based on the expected value of acceleration, i.e., the actual acceleration; an estimate which includes measurement noise can only degrade the accuracy‚Äîas shown in Figure 7. Indeed, not only is the noisy IMMA MSE larger than the 3rd order variance (by nearly a factor of two at the worst point), once the noisy IMMA MSE exceeds the 3rd order variance, it does not drop below as does the ideal IMMA. In contrast, the optimal FOE MSE (i.e., MSE_{min}) always remains less than the 3rd order variance. This analysis compellingly suggests that adaptivity significantly degrades IMM accuracy rather than improving it. Of course, this should not come as a surprise since for \\\\rho_3<0.5 , the acceleration is buried in the noise; i.e., (a\\\\Delta^2)/\\\\sigma_\\\\eta <1 (a signal-to-noise ratio likeness of less than 0 dB). These analyses reveal the incredible and disconcerting lack of tracking literature that addresses fundamentals (e.g., optimal IMM interpolation, \\\\mu_2 boundary conditions, and acceleration-to-noise ratio) and comparisons with standard benchmarks (e.g.; 2nd order, 3rd order, or other optimal estimators). ==Deficiencies and oversights in the Kalman filter== Comparisons of the KF with the derivation, analysis, design, and implementation of MFOE have uncovered a number of deficiencies and oversights in the KF that are overcome by the MFOE. They are reported and discussed in. ==References== Category:Signal estimation Category:Estimator ","title":"Multi-fractional order estimator"},{"id":"46297841","text":"Star Rangers, also known as The Last Planet, is a science fiction novel by the American author Andre Norton. The novel was published on August 20, 1953, by Harcourt, Brace & Company.Harrison, Irene R., and Roger C. Schlobin, Andre Norton: a primary and secondary bibliography, NESFA Press (Framingham, MA), 1994, Pg 3 This is one of Norton's Central Control books, which lay out the history of a galactic empire through events suggested by Norton's understanding of Terran history (see also Star Guard). ==Background== The First Galactic Empire is disintegrating, and petty tyrants are creating their own fiefdoms. Near the Empire's edge, a Central Control agent seeks to rid himself of the Stellar Patrol, the last protector of law and order in the empire, by sending it out to locate lost stellar systems. Ships are sent to retrieve and align these systems under the benign rule of Central Control. The ship at the heart of the story is the Scout ship Starfire. Living among the humans are several kinds of aliens. For example, there are the \\"Bemmies\\", whose name comes from BEM (short for Bug-Eyed Monster). All the aliens possess, to some degree, telepathy: the ability to read and to project mental imagery. The types of aliens in the story include the Zacathan, a reptilian people from the planet Zacan; the Trystian, a bird people, clad in feathers and very light and nimble; the Faltharian, who come from dusky Falthar and are sensitive to light; and the Ageratan, humanoids from Agerat who are the Romans of the First Galactic Empire. (The term \\"Ageratan\\" must be from a recently revised text; in editions published through the 1970s these people were Arcturians, humans from Arcturus Three.) ==Synopsis== In the year AD 8054, the Stellar Patrol Scoutship Starfire has crashed in a desert on an Earth-like planet. The planet's atmosphere, gravity, and solar radiation are almost ideal for the Rangers and Patrolmen. On initial examination, there are no signs of civilization. After burying their dead, the survivors set up a camp in a forest beside a river. One night, one of the men notices the bright beam of a beacon sweeping across the sky. Ranger Sergeant Kartr and Ranger Rolth take the aerial sled to investigate. They find an abandoned city lit up as if it were inhabited. There they meet Joyd Cummi, an Ageratan Vice-Sector Lord who has come to the city with almost two hundred people from a starliner that has made an emergency landing nearby. Against Kartr's advice, the Patrol's ranking officer decides that the Patrolmen and Rangers will move to the city and join the other refugees. Not trusting Cummi, the Rangers take up residence in a tower isolated from the buildings occupied by the starliner's passengers and crew. Soon Kartr and the others discover that all is not well in the Cummi dictatorship. Inspired by the arrival of the Patrol, the rebels begin their revolt, and the Rangers are drawn into the battle. With their expertise, the Patrolmen and Rangers help the rebels win the fight. Cummi flees the city, taking telepathic control of Kartr's body and uses him to fly the Rangers' aerial sled. Kartr wakes up on the ground in a rainstorm. The surviving Patrolmen and Rangers soon find him and take him to their new camp. Several days later, Katr and his Zacathan friend search for Cummi, beginning at the wreckage of the sled. In the wilderness, they rescue an injured boy and take him to his clan's camp, where Kartr must confront Cummi. In a mind-to-mind battle, Cummi succumbs to the hideous disease that he has spread to the natives. Kartr and the other refugees decide to avoid the natives, lest they spread even more disease. With nothing else to do and faint hope of finding an intact spaceship, they set out to find the Meeting Place of the Gods that the native boy mentioned to Kartr. When they come to that sacred place, they see a building that looks exactly like the Place of Free Planets in the Imperial capital, but much older. Inside the building, they find the legendary, almost mythical Hall of Leave-Taking and realize that the planet on which they stand is Terra of Sol, old Earth, the original home of humanity. As they marvel at the discovery, a band of refugees from a Stellar Patrol base which was destroyed by pirates joins them. As ranking officer, Kartr asks for a vote on whether to return to the city or try to live in the wilderness. The people vote unanimously for a new start, and Kartr leads them into their future. ==Reviews== The editors at The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction (November 1953),Star Rangers at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database Retrieved April 30, 2014 wrote: The reviewer of Kirkus Reviews August 1, 1953 Issue wrote: In the Saturday Review for November 14, 1953, the reviewer wrote:Review from Saturday Review for November 14, 1953 ==ReferencesSources== * Clute, John. \\"Norton, Andre.\\" The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction.

It was first detected and structurally defined by P. Wlodawer, Bengt I. Samuelsson, and M. Hamberg as a product of arachidonic acid metabolism made by microsomes (i.e. endoplasmic reticulum) isolated from sheep seminal vesicle glands and by intact human platelets. 12-HHT is less ambiguously termed 12-(S)-hydroxy-5Z,8E,10E-heptadecatrienoic acid to indicate the S stereoisomerism of its 12-hydroxyl residue and the Z, E, and E cis-trans isomerism of its three double bonds. The metabolite was for many years thought to be merely a biologically inactive byproduct of prostaglandin synthesis. More recent studies, however, have attached potentially important activity to it. == Production ==  Primary source  Cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 metabolize arachidonic acid to the 15-hydroperoxy, 20 carbon prostaglandin (PG) intermediate, PGG2, and then to the 15-hydroxy, 20 carbon intermediate, prostaglandin H2 (PGH2). Thromboxane synthase further metabolizes PGH2 to the 20 carbon product, Thromboxane A2, the 17 carbon product, 12-HHT, and the 3 carbon product Malonyldialdehyde. Platelets express cycloxygenase and thromboxane synthase enzymes, producing PGG2, PGH2, and TXA2 in response to platelet aggregating agents such as thrombin; these metabolites act as autocrines by feeding back to promote further aggregation of their cells of origin and as paracrines by recruiting nearby platlets into the response as well as exerting effects on other nearby tissues such as contracting blood vessels. These effects combine to trigger blood clotting and limiting blood loss. 12-HHT is a particularly abundant product of these pro- clotting responses, accounting for about one third of the total amount of arachidonic acid metabolites formed by physiologically stimulated human platelets. Its abundant production during blood clotting, the presence of cyclooxygenases and to a lesser extent thromboxane synthase in a wide range of cell types and tissue, and its production by other pathways imply that 12-HHT has one or more important bioactivities relevant to clotting and, perhaps, other responses.  Other sources  Various cytochrome P450 enzymes (e.g. CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, CYP2E1, CYP2S1, and CYP3A4) metabolize PGG2 and PGH2 to 12-HHT and MDA. While the latter studies were conducted using recombinant cytochrome enzymes or sub-fractions of disrupted cells, the human monocyte, a form of blood circulating leukocyte, increases its expression of CYP2S1 when forced to differentiate into a macrophage phenotype by interferon gamma or lipopolysaccharide (i.e. endotoxin); associated with these changes, the differentiated macrophage metabolized arachidonic acid to 12-HHT by a CYP2S1-dependent mechanism. Future studies, therefore may show that cytochromes are responsible for 12-HHT and MDA production in vivo. PGH2, particularly in the presence of ferrous iron (FeII), ferric iron (FeIII), or hemin, rearranges non-enzymatically to a mixture of 12-HHT and 12-HHT's 8-cis isomer, i.e., 12-(S)-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,10E-heptadecatrienoic acid. This non- enzymatic pathway may explain findings that cells can make 12-HHT in excess of TXA2 and also in the absence of active cycloxygenase and/or thromboxane synthase enzymes. == Further metabolism == 12-HHT is further metabolized by 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (NAD+) in a wide variety of human and other vertebrate cells to its 12-oxo (also termed 12-keto) derivative, 12-oxo-5Z,8E,10E-heptadecatrienoic acid (12-oxo-HHT or 12-keto-HHT). Pig kidney tissue also converted 12-HHT to 12-keto-5Z,8E-heptadecadienoic acid (12-oxo-5Z,8E-heptadecadienoic acid) and 12-hydroxy-heptadecadienoic acid. Acidic conditions (pH~1.1-1.5) cause 12-HHT to rearrange in a time- and temperature-dependent process to its 5-cis isomer, 12-hydroxy-5E,8E,10E-heptadecatrienoic acid. == Activities and clinical significance ==  Early studies  Fourteen years after the first publication on its detection in 1973, 12-HHT was reported to stimulate fetal bovine aortic and human umbilical vein endothelial cells to metabolize arachidonic acid to Prostacyclin I2 (PGI2), a powerful inhibitor of platelet activation and stimulator of Vasodilation (see Prostacyclin synthase); it did not, however, alter arachidonic acid metabolism in human platelets. Shortly thereafter, 12-HHT was reported to inhibit the chemotaxis-blocking effect of a human monocyte-derived factor on human moncytes while the immediate metabolite of 12-HHT, 12-oxo-HT, was reported to stimulate the chemotasis of human neutrophils. and to inhibit platelet aggregation responses to various agents by stimulating platelets to raise their levels of Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), an intracellular signal that serves broadly to inhibit platelet activation. These studies were largely overlooked; in 1998 and 2007 publications, for example, 12-HHT was regarded as either inactive or without significant biological activity. Nonetheless, this early work suggested that 12-HHT may serve as a contributor to monocyte- and neutrophil-based inflammatory responses and 12-oxo-HT may serve as a counterpoise to platelet aggregation responses elicited or promoted by TXA2. Relevant to the latter activity, a later study showed that this inhibitory effect was due to the ability of 12-oxo-HT to act as a partial antagonist of the Thromboxane receptor: it blocks TXA2 binding to its receptor and thereby the responses of platelets and possibly other tissues to TXA2 as well as agents that depend on stimulating TXA2 production for their activity. Thus, 12-HHT forms simultaneously with, and by stimulating PGI2 production, inhibits TXA2-mediated platelet activation responses while 12-oxo-HT blocks TXA2 receptor binding to reduce not only TXA2-induced thrombosis and blood clotting but possibly also vasospasm and other actions of TXA2. In this view, thromboxane synthase leads to the production of a broadly active arachidonic acid metabolite, TXA2, plus two other arachidonic acid metabolites, 12-HHT and 12-oxo-HT, that serve indirectly to stimulate PGI2 production or directly as a receptor antagonist to moderate TXA2's action, respectively. This strategy may be essential for limiting the deleterious thrombotic and vasospastic activities of TXA2.  12-HHT is a BLT2 receptor agonist  Leukotriene B4 (i.e. LTB4) is an arachidonic acid metabolite made by the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme pathway. It activates cells through both its high affinity (Dissociation constant [Kd] of 0.5-1.5 nM) Leukotriene B4 receptor 1 (BLT1 receptor) and its low affinity BLT2 receptor (Kd=23 nM); both receptors are G protein coupled receptors that, when ligand-bound, activate cells by releasing the Gq alpha subunit and pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi alpha subunit from Heterotrimeric G proteins. BLT1 receptor has a high degree of ligand-binding specificity: among a series of hydroxylated eicosanoid metabolites of arachidonic acid, it binds only LTB4, 20-hydroxy-LTB4, and 12-epi-LTB4; among this same series, BLT2 receptor has far less specificity in that it binds not only LTB4, 20-hydroxy-LTB4, and 12-epi-LTB4 but also 12(R)-HETE and 12(S)-HETE (i.e. the two stereoisomers of 12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid) and 15(S)-HpETE and 15(S)-HETE (i.e. the two stereoisomers of 15-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid). The BLT2 receptor's relative affinities for finding LTB4, 12(S)-HETE, 12(S)-HpETE, 12(R)-HETE, 15(S)-HETE, and 20-hydroxy- LTB4 are ~100, 10, 10, 3, 3, and 1, respectively. All of these binding affinities are considered to be low and therefore indicating that some unknown ligand(s) might bind BLT2 with high affinity. In 2009, 12-HHT was found to bind to the BLT2 receptor with ~10-fold higher affinity than LTB4; 12-HHT did not bind to the BLT1 receptor. Thus, the BLT1 receptor exhibits exquisite specificity, binding 5(S),12(R)-dihydroxy-6Z,8E,10E,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (i.e. LTB4) but not LTB4's 12(S) or 6Z isomers while the BLT2 receptor exhibits a promiscuous finding pattern. Formyl peptide receptor 2 is a relevant and well-studied example of promiscuous receptors. Initially thought to be a second and low affinity receptor for the neutrophil tripeptide chemotactic factor, N-formyl-met-leu-phe, subsequent studies showed that it was a high affinity receptor for the arachidonic acid metabolite, lipoxin A4, but also bound and was activated by a wide range of peptides, proteins, and other agents. BLT2 may ultimately prove to have binding specificity for a similarly broad range of agents. The production of LTB4 and expression of BLT1 by human tissues are largely limited to bone marrow-derived cells such as the neutrophil, eosinophil, mast cell, and various types of lymphocytes and accordingly are regarded primarily as contributing to the many human defensive and pathological (ulcerative colitis, arthritis, asthma, etc.) inflammatory responses which are mediated by these cell types. Drugs that inhibit LTB4 production or binding to BLT1 are in use or development for the latter diseases. In contrast, the production of 12-HH2 and expression of BLT2 receptors by human tissues is far wider and more robust than that of the LTB4/BLT2 receptor axis. Recent studies indicate that the role(s) of the 12-HHT/BLT2 receptor axis in human physiology and pathology may be very different than those of the LTB4/BLT1 axis.  Recent studies on 12-HHT/BLT2 receptor activities   Inflammation and allergy 12-HHT stimulates chemotactic responses in mouse bone marrow mast cells, which naturally express BLT2 receptors, as well as in Chinese hamster ovary cells made to express these receptors by transfection. These findings suggest that the 12-HHT/BLT2 receptor pathway may support the pro-inflammatory (i.e. chemotactic) actions of the LTB4/BLT1 pathway. On the other hand, the immortalized human skin cell line HaCaT expresses BLT2 receptors and responds to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation by generating toxic reactive oxygen species which in turn cause the HaCaT cells to die by activating apoptotic pathways in a BLT2 receptor- dependent reaction. Topical treatment of mouse skin with a BLT2 receptor antagonist, LY255283, protects against UVB radiation-induced apoptosis and BLT2-overexpressing transgenic mice exhibited significantly more extensive skin apoptosis in response to UVB irradiation. Furthermore, 12-HHT inhibits HaCaT cells from synthesizing interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine associated with cutaneous inflammation, in response to UVB radiation. These results suggest that the 12-HHT/BLT2 axis can act to suppress inflammation by promoting the orderly death of damaged cells and blocking IL-6 production. Opposition between the pro-inflammatory LTB4/BLT1 and anti- inflammatory actions of the 12-HHT/BLT2 axes occurs in another setting. In a mice model of ovalbumin-induced allergic airway disease, 12-HHT and its companion cyclooxygenase metabolites, Prostaglandin E2 and Prostaglandin D2, but not 12 other lipoxygenase or cycloxygenase metabolites, showed a statistically significantly increase in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels after intratracheal ovalbumin challenge; after this challenge, only 12-HHT, among the monitored BLT2 receptor-activating ligands (LTB4, the 12(S) stereoisomer of 12-HETE, and 15(S)-HETE) attained levels capable of activating BLT2 receptors. Also, BLT2 knockout mice exhibited a greatly enhanced response to ovalabumin challenge. Finally, BLT2 receptor expression was significantly reduced in allergy-regulating CD4+ T cells from patients with asthma compared to healthy control subjects. Unlike LTB4 and its BLT1 receptor, which are implicated in contributing to allergen-based airway disease in mice and humans, 12-HHT and its BLT2 receptor appear to suppress this disease in mice and may do so in humans. While further studies to probe the role of the 12-HHT/BLT2 axis in human inflammatory and allergic diseases, the current studies indicate that 12-HHT, acting through BLT2, may serve to promote or limit, inflammatory and to promote allergic responses.  Wound healing  High dose aspirin treatment (aspirin, at these doses, inhibits cyclooxygenases-1 and -2 to block their production of 12-HHT), thromboxane synthase knockout, and BLT2 receptor knockout but not TXA2 receptor knockout impair keratinocyte-based re-epithelialization and thereby closure of experimentally induced wounds in mice while a synthetic BLT2 receptor agonist accelerats wound closure not only in this mouse model but also in the db/db mouse model of obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia due to leptin receptor deficiency. 12-HHT accumulated in the wounds of the former mouse model. Companion studies using an in vitro scratch test assay indicated that 12-HHT stimulated human and mouse keratinocyte migration by a BLT2 receptor-dependent mechanism that involved the production of tumor necrosis factor Œ± and metalloproteinases. These results indicate that the 12-HHT/BLT2 receptor axis is a critical contributor to wound healing in mice and possibly humans. The axis operates by recruiting the movement of keratinocytes to close the wound. This mechanism may underlie the suppression of wound healing that accompanies the high dose intake of aspirin and, based on mouse studies, other non- steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAID) in humans. Synthetic BLT2 agonists may be useful for speeding the healing of chronic ulcerative wounds, particularly in patients with, for example diabetics, that have impaired wound healing.  Cancer  A large number of studies have associated BLT2 and, directly or by assumption, 12-HHT in the survival, growth, and/or spread of various human cancers. See 'Leukotriene B4 receptor 2 for the associations of BLT2 and/or 12-HHT with stimulating the malignant behavior of prostate cancer, urinary bladder cancer, breast cancer, thyroid gland follicular carcinoma, kidney renal cell carcinoma, bladder transitional cell carcinoma, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colon cancer. == See also == * Leukotriene B4 receptor 2 * Leukotriene B4 receptor 1 * Leukotriene B4 * 12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid * 15-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid ==References== Category:Fatty acids ","title":"12-Hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid"},{"id":"46297893","text":"Spidia inangulata is a moth in the family Drepanidae.

The Government of India honoured him in 1956, with the award of Padma Shri, the fourth highest Indian civilian award for his services to the nation. ==Biography== Isaac Santra was born on 3 November 1892 in Sambalpur in the western part of the Indian state of Odisha to a pastor and his wife in a family with meagre financial resources. Going against the wishes of his father who wanted the young Isaac to be pastor, he did his schooling in Sambalpur and joined Shri Ramachandra Bhanj Medical College, Cuttack in 1919 to secure a medical degree. His experience during his medical education and the social stigma associated with the disease of leprosy impacted the young man and he decided to pursue his career treating the disease. Santra started his medical career by joining the Central Government service and headed the Leprosy Survey of India during 1927 to 1931. In 1932, he was selected as a member of the Leprosy Prevention Society of Great Britain and retained the position till his retirement in 1947. He also served on deputation to countries such as Japan and Nigeria during various occasions as Leprosy Expert of the International Leprosy Association. Notes on Leprosy in Japan is a publication he has brought out in 1953, post his service in Japan. After retirement from government service, Santra tried to gather resources and, by obtaining government assistance, he founded Hatibari Kushtashram, in 1951, later to be known as Hatibari Health Home, in Hatibari, a village near the Jujomura Block[Odisha] states. At a time when Dapsone, a drug for the treatment of leprosy was yet to be formulated, he turned to ancient Indian scriptures such as Sushruta Samhita and came out with a medicine made of chaulmoogra (Hydnocarpus wightianus) and started treating leprosy patients with this drug. The place soon developed into a treatment and rehabilitation centre from where patients cured of the disease will be assisted in reintegration into the mainstream society. He served the Health Home till his death after which the centre was taken over by Hind Kustha Nibarini Sangha (HKNS), and was brought under the jurisdiction of the Government of Odisha. Isaac Santra was married to Rajkumari Das and one of his sons, Dilip Kumar Santra is also a medical doctor.

He earned his role as the Bachelor by becoming a fan favorite during his time on the tenth season of The Bachelorette with Andi Dorfman, where he placed third. He has also appeared in Dancing with the Stars. ==Early life== Soules was born in Arlington, Iowa, and is the youngest child and only son of Gary and Linda Soules. He has three older sisters. Soules is a fourth-generation farmer. He learned how to drive a tractor before driving a car at a young age. At Starmont High School, Soules was involved in football, track, and the National FFA Organization. When he was a senior, the Starmont High football team was runner-up in the state championship. He graduated in 2000. Soules went on to graduate from Iowa State University with a major in Agricultural Studies. ==Television shows== The Bachelorette Soules first appeared on Andi Dorfman's season of The Bachelorette. He finished in third place after he had confessed his love to Andi. Soules started slowly but soon became a major contender for Andi's heart when he received her first kiss of the season. The smooch happened in episode 2 during their one-on-one date at the Santa Anita Race Track. While enjoying the afternoon, Soules opened up to Andi about his history, admitting that he was previously engaged. He made it all the way to the hometown date in episode 8, introducing Andi to his life on the farm in Iowa. The couple rode his tractor and enjoyed a picnic in the fields while a plane flew over with a banner that read: \\"Chris Loves Andi\\". But despite their chemistry, Andi broke things off with Soules during the fantasy suite episode. During her final one-on-one with him before the finale, Andi admitted to him that she was struggling with the idea of living in Iowa and did not want him to have to make sacrifices for her. Soules told her he was falling in love with her, but Andi ended things, telling him the foundation in their relationship just wasn't there. He left after telling Andi that he appreciated and respected her. The Bachelor Soules became a fan favorite on The Bachelorette and he ended up as the Bachelor for season 19. In the first episode, it was revealed that he would have a total of 30 women to choose from, instead of the usual 25. Soules proposed to Whitney Bischoff in The Bachelor finale at his family's barn in near Lamont, Iowa. On May 28, 2015, the couple announced that they had called off their engagement. Dancing with the Stars Following The Bachelor, Soules became a contestant on the ABC reality show Dancing with the Stars; his partner was season 19 champion Witney Carson. Soules became the 12th and final celebrity to fill in the cast. At the midway of the competition, Soules suffered a calf injury during rehearsal on Disney week. Soules was eliminated on May 5, 2015 (week 8) and finished in 5th place. Worst Cooks in America: Celebrity Edition In September, 2015, Soules appeared on Food Network's Worst Cooks in America: Celebrity Edition, where he was the third person eliminated from an original group of seven. ==Personal life== Soules resides in his hometown of Arlington where he spends his time farming his own land as well as helping his father. Prior to his reality television appearance, he dated his college sweetheart Sheena Schreck and went on to become engaged to her. However, they ended their relationship before walking down the aisle. Following his appearance on The Bachelor, he was engaged to 29-year-old Chicago, Illinois resident, Whitney Bischoff. The couple broke off their engagement shortly after their six-month anniversary. In April 2017, Soules was arrested and charged with leaving the scene of a fatal traffic accident in Aurora, Iowa. He was charged with a class D felony for leaving the scene of an accident causing death. He was not charged with driving under the influence, although court documents obtained by People magazine reveal that he was allegedly in possession of alcoholic beverages and containers at the time of the crash, which occurred around 8 p.m. on Monday, April 24, 2017. His attorneys are also hoping to avoid a trial completely since Soules is a \\"public figure\\" and an \\"unnecessary trial\\" could be \\"damaging\\". \\"If Mr. Soules is forced to proceed to trial and then appeal, there would be no way to undo the publicity and restore Mr. Soules to his original position,\\" his lawyers stated, according to documents obtained by the Des Moines Register. \\"Addressing this questionable and fundamentally unfair charge, given these facts, prior to trial, better serves the interests of justice.\\" On August 23, 2019 he was convicted after his guilty plea to leaving the scene of an accident. His penalty was two years' probation. ==References * Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Farmers from Iowa Category:Iowa State University alumni Category:Participants in American reality television series Category:People from Fayette County, Iowa Category:Bachelor Nation contestants ","title":"Chris Soules"},{"id":"46298080","text":"De la Motte Fouqu√© Louisa Starr, later Louisa Canziani (1845‚Äì25 May 1909), was a British painter. ==Biography== Starr was born in London and lived on Russell Square when she became a copyist at the British Museum.Louisa Starr in English Female Artists by Ellen Creathorne Clayton, 1876 Studying at the Royal Academy, she showed her first work there in 1866 and by 1876 had showed 17 paintings.

Around this time, he got in an altercation with a drag queen, who pierced Spacely's eye with a high heeled shoe.

The electoral system was introduced for the first time in 1847, and 4 of the 7 board members were elected by the rate payers. In 1852 the board was replaced by a new one and in 1863 a new body was formed. As per old records, in 1872 there were 25 wards in Kolkata (spellings as in use at that time) ‚Äì 1. Shyampukur, 2.

A new municipal corporation was created in 1876, wherein 48 commissioners were elected and 24 were appointed by the government. With the implementation of the Municipal Consolidation Act of 1888 the area under the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation was enlarged. Certain areas were already there but more parts of them were added (current spellings) - Entally, Manicktala, Beliaghata, Ultadanga, Chitpur, Cossipore, Beniapukur, Ballygunge, Watganj and Ekbalpur, and Garden Reach and Tollygunj. The Act of 1923 brought about important changes. It liberalised the constitution along democratic lines.Bagchi, Amiya Kumar, Wealth and Work in Calcutta, 1860-1921, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol. I, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, p. 213-215, Oxford University Press, . The state government superseded the Corporation in 1948 and the Calcutta Municipal Act of 1951 came into force. Adult franchise was introduced in municipal elections in 1962. With the addition of certain areas in the southern parts of the city, the number of wards increased from 75 to 144. ==Geography== Ward No. 20 is bordered on the north by B.K.Pal Avenue, Ahiritola Street and its continuation up to the Hooghly River bank; on the east by Rabindra Sarani; on the south by Nimtala Ghat Street and the Port Trust Road leading to Nimtala Ghat; and on the west by the Hooghly River.Kolkata: Detail Maps of 141 Wards with Street Directory.

Led by the strong mixed doubles play of Taylor Townsend and Marcelo Melo, the Freedoms had only 5 wins against 9 losses but qualified for the playoffs for the second consecutive season. The Freedoms lost the Eastern Conference Championship Match, 25‚Äì9, to the Washington Kastles. ==Season recap== Draft At the WTT draft on March 16, 2015, the Freedoms passed on making any selections in the marquee portion of the draft. In the roster portion of the draft, the Freedoms protected Taylor Townsend and 2014 WTT Male Most Valuable Player Marcelo Melo. They left Victoria Duval and Liezel Huber unprotected in the second round and instead chose Robby Ginepri. The Freedoms could not protect Frank Dancevic in the fourth round, because they already had two full-time male players. Huber was still available, and the Freedoms selected her to complete their roster. Other player transactions On June 29, 2015, the Freedoms announced that Liezel Huber would miss the 2015 season due to health concerns, and she was removed from the active roster. The Freedoms also announced that they had signed Coco Vandeweghe, Asia Muhammad and Abigail Spears as substitute players. Vandeweghe was scheduled to play in the team's first three matches (all on the road), followed by Muhammad playing in the next four and Spears playing in the final seven. Second-half turnaround After winning their opening match on the road, the Freedoms lost their next six consecutive matches and found themselves with 1 win and 6 losses at the midway point of the season with the four-time defending WTT champion Washington Kastles coming to town. The July 20 home match against the Kastles got off to a difficult start when the Freedoms dropped the opening set of men's singles, 5‚Äì2. But Taylor Townsend responded by taking a 5‚Äì1 set win over Madison Brengle in women's singles to give the Freedoms a 7‚Äì6 lead. Robby Ginepri and Marcelo Melo won a tiebreaker over Sam Querrey and Leander Paes in men's doubles to increase the lead to 12‚Äì10. But the Kastles won the next set of women's doubles and took a 15‚Äì13 lead to the final set. Melo and Townsend dominated Paes and Anastasia Rodionova in the final set of mixed doubles, 5‚Äì1, to give the Freedoms an 18‚Äì16 victory. After a night off, the Freedoms went on the road to face the Boston Lobsters looking to avenge an early-season home loss. The Lobsters took the opening set of mixed doubles in a tiebreaker. But the Freedoms responded by winning the final four sets on their way to a 24‚Äì14 victory. Townsend gave the Freedoms a 9‚Äì5 lead in the match when she took the women's singles set from Irina Falconi, 5‚Äì0. Townsend won 20 of the 26 points played in the set. Following two sets won by the Freedoms in tiebreakers, Melo and Ginepri closed out the match with a 5‚Äì1 men's doubles set win. The Freedoms returned home the following evening to face the Austin Aces, who entered the match with 8 wins and 0 losses. The Freedoms stunned the Aces by winning the first four sets to take a 20‚Äì9 lead. Ginepri opened with a 5‚Äì2 set win in men's singles, and Townsend followed by taking the women's singles set, 5‚Äì3. Ginepri and Melo won the men's doubles, 5‚Äì3, and Townsend teamed with Abigail Spears for a 5‚Äì1 set win in women's doubles. The Aces salvaged the final set of mixed doubles, 5‚Äì1, to cut the Freedoms' lead to 21‚Äì14 and send the match to extended play. But Townsend and Melo won the first game of extra time to give the Freedoms their third consecutive victory by a score of 22‚Äì14. The Freedoms followed their three-match winning streak with two straight losses. Yet, with 4 wins and 8 losses and two matches remaining, the Freedoms controlled their own playoff destiny. The Lobsters were in second place in the Eastern Conference with 4 wins and 7 losses, and the Freedoms had a home-and- home series scheduled with them to close the season. Following the home-and- home, the Lobsters were scheduled to close their season on the road against the Kastles. Therefore, if the Freedoms could sweep the home-and-home series, they would clinch a playoff berth. The Lobsters hosted the first match, and Ginepri put the Freedoms in front early with a 5‚Äì2 set win in men's singles. The Lobsters took the women's singles by the same score to tie the match at 7. Ginepri and Melo followed by winning the men's doubles set, 5‚Äì3, to give the Freedoms a 12‚Äì10 lead. But the Lobsters won the women's doubles set by the same score to tie the match at 15, heading to the final set. Melo and Townsend converted two of three break point opportunities while thwarting all five break point opportunities they gave the Lobsters and won the set, 5‚Äì2, for a 20‚Äì17 victory. Returning home with a chance to clinch a playoff berth in their final regular-season match, the Freedoms got off to a quick start when Ginepri won the opening set of men's singles, 5‚Äì0. But the Lobsters charged back, winning the next three sets to take a 15‚Äì12 lead to the final set. Melo and Townsend controlled the early portion of the fifth set of mixed doubles with two breaks of serve on two opportunities, and it looked as though the Freedoms might win the match outright with a lopsided final set win. But the Lobsters broke back late, and the Freedoms won the set by a score of 5‚Äì3 to cut the Lobsters' lead in the match to 18‚Äì17 and set up extended play. Melo served the first game of extended play, and the Freedoms quickly fell behind in the game, 3‚Äì1. The Freedoms successfully defended the first two break points, but the Lobsters ultimately broke at 3 all to win the match, 19‚Äì17. The Freedoms would have to wait for the result of the Lobsters' final match to learn their fate. With an opportunity to grab a playoff spot, the Lobsters fell to the Kastles, 22‚Äì14, in their final regular-season match, clinching a playoff berth for the Freedoms. Since the Freedoms and Lobsters finished the regular season with identical 5‚Äì9 records, the WTT standings tiebreaker system was used to break the tie. The teams split their four regular-season meetings. So, the tie was broken by comparing games won in head-to-head matches, which favored the Freedoms, 78‚Äì71. The biggest contribution to this margin was made by the Freedoms' 24‚Äì14 road victory over the Lobsters on July 22. Playoffs The Freedoms visited the Washington Kastles to play the Eastern Conference Championship Match on July 30, 2015. It was a dominant performance for Washington, as the Kastles took all five sets en route to a 25‚Äì9 victory for their fifth consecutive Eastern Conference title. Martina Hingis teamed with Leander Paes in the opening set of mixed doubles for a 5‚Äì1 set win over Taylor Townsend and Marcelo Melo. Townsend and Coco Vandeweghe were able to push Hingis and Anastasia Rodionova to a tiebreaker in the fourth set of women's doubles before dropping the set. Madison Brengle saved three break points and won both 3-all points for a 5‚Äì2 set win in women's singles over Vandeweghe. Paes and Sam Querrey took the men's doubles set, 5‚Äì2, over Melo and Robby Ginepri. Querrey closed out the match with a 5‚Äì0 whitewash of Ginepri in men's singles. ==Event chronology== * March 16, 2015: The Freedoms protected Taylor Townsend and Marcelo Melo, chose Robby Ginepri as a new addition to the team and selected returning team member Liezel Huber whom they had left unprotected at the WTT draft. * June 29, 2015: The Freedoms announced Liezel Huber would miss the 2015 season due to health concerns and removed her from the active roster. The Freedoms signed Coco Vandeweghe, Asia Muhammad and Abigail Spears as substitute players. * July 29, 2015: With a record of 5 wins and 9 losses, the Freedoms clinched a playoff berth when the Washington Kastles defeated the Boston Lobsters, 22‚Äì14. * July 30, 2015: The Freedoms lost the Eastern Conference Championship Match, 25‚Äì9, to the Washington Kastles. ==Draft picks== Since the Freedoms had the worse record of the two conference championship losers in 2014, they selected fourth from the bottom (fourth) in each round of the draft. Unlike previous seasons in which WTT conducted its Marquee Player Draft and its Roster Player Draft on different dates about one month apart, the league conducted a single draft at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden in Indian Wells, California on March 16, 2015. The selections made by the Freedoms are shown in the table below. {  style=\\"text- align:left\\" - !0025BD; color:white\\" width=\\"100px\\" Draft type !0025BD; color:white\\" width=\\"50px\\" Round !0025BD; color:white\\" width=\\"50px\\" !0025BD; color:white\\" width=\\"50px\\" !0025BD; color:white\\" width=\\"250px\\" Player chosen !0025BD; color:white\\" width=\\"25px\\" -  rowspan=\\"3\\"   Marquee   1   4   4  Pass   ‚Äì -   2  style=\\"text- align:center\\" 4   11  Pass  style=\\"text- align:center\\" ‚Äì -   3  style=\\"text- align:center\\" 4   18  Pass  style=\\"text- align:center\\" ‚Äì -  rowspan=\\"4\\"   Roster   1   4  style=\\"text- align:center\\" 4  Taylor Townsend   Y -   2   4  style=\\"text- align:center\\" 11  Robby Ginepri   N -   3   4  style=\\"text- align:center\\" 18  Marcelo Melo   Y -   4   4  style=\\"text- align:center\\" 25  Liezel Huber   N } ==Match log== Regular season :{ align=\\"center\\" border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"1\\" style=\\"border:1px solid #aaa\\" - ! colspan=\\"2\\" 0025BD; color:white\\"  Legend - ! bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\"  Freedoms Win ! bgcolor=\\"ffbbbb\\"  Freedoms Loss - ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Home team in CAPS } {  style=\\"text-align:left\\" - !0025BD; color:white\\" width=\\"25px\\" Match !0025BD; color:white\\" width=\\"60px\\" Date !0025BD; color:white\\" width=\\"175px\\" Venue and location !0025BD; color:white\\" width=\\"600px\\" Result and details !0025BD; color:white\\" width=\\"25px\\" Record - bgcolor=\\"ccffcc\\"   1  July 12  Mediacom Stadium at Cooper Tennis Complex Springfield, Missouri  Philadelphia Freedoms 22, SPRINGFIELD LASERS 15 * XD: Andre Begemann/Anna-Lena Gr√∂nefeld (Lasers) 5, Marcelo Melo/Coco Vandeweghe (Freedoms) 2 * WD: Coco Vandeweghe/Taylor Townsend (Freedoms) 5, Anna-Lena Gr√∂nefeld/Varvara Lepchenko (Lasers) 4 * MD: Robby Ginepri/Marcelo Melo (Freedoms) 5, Andre Begemann/Michael Russell (Lasers) 4 * WS: Coco Vandeweghe (Freedoms) 5, Varvara Lepchenko (Lasers) 1 * MS: Robby Ginepri (Freedoms) 5, Michael Russell (Lasers) 1   1‚Äì0 - bgcolor=\\"ffbbbb\\"   2  July 13  Omni La Costa Resort and Spa Carlsbad, California  SAN DIEGO AVIATORS 22, Philadelphia Freedoms 21, (super tiebreaker, 7‚Äì5) * MD: Taylor Fritz/Raven Klaasen (Aviators) 5, Marcelo Melo/Robby Ginepri (Freedoms) 2 * WS: Coco Vandeweghe (Freedoms) 5, Chanelle Scheepers (Aviators) 4 * MS: Robby Ginepri (Freedoms) 5, Taylor Fritz (Aviators) 4 * WD: Coco Vandeweghe/Taylor Townsend (Freedoms) 5, Darija Jurak/Chanelle Scheepers (Aviators) 3 * XD: Raven Klaasen/Darija Jurak (Aviators) 5, Marcelo Melo/Coco Vandeweghe (Freedoms) 4 * STB - XD: Raven Klaasen/Darija Jurak (Aviators) 7, Marcelo Melo/Coco Vandeweghe (Freedoms) 5   1‚Äì1 - bgcolor=\\"ffbbbb\\"   3  July 14  Dream Stadium at Sunrise Mall Citrus Heights, California  CALIFORNIA DREAM 22, Philadelphia Freedoms 20 * MD: Marcelo Melo/Robby Ginepri (Freedoms) 5, Tennys Sandgren/Neal Skupski (Dream) 4 * WD: Jarmila Gajdo≈°ov√°/Anabel Medina Garrigues (Dream) 5, Coco Vandeweghe/Taylor Townsend (Freedoms) 4 * XD: Neal Skupski/Anabel Medina Garrigues (Dream) 5, Marcelo Melo/Coco Vandeweghe (Freedoms) 3 * WS: Coco Vandeweghe (Freedoms) 5, Jarmila Gajdo≈°ov√° (Dream) 3 * MS: Tennys Sandgren (Dream) 5, Robby Ginepri (Freedoms) 3   1‚Äì2 - bgcolor=\\"ffbbbb\\"   4  July 16  The Pavilion Radnor Township, Pennsylvania  Boston Lobsters 21, PHILADELPHIA FREEDOMS 17 * MS: Robby Ginepri (Freedoms) 5, Alex Kuznetsov (Lobsters) 2 * WD: Arantxa Parra Santonja/Irina Falconi (Lobsters) 5, Asia Muhammad/Taylor Townsend (Freedoms) 2 * XD: Marcelo Melo/Taylor Townsend (Freedoms) 5, Scott Lipsky/Irina Falconi (Lobsters) 4 *** Irina Falconi substituted for Arantxa Parra Santonja at 3‚Äì2 * WS: Irina Falconi (Lobsters) 5, Taylor Townsend (Freedoms) 2 * MD: Scott Lipsky/Alex Kuznetsov (Lobsters) 5, Marcelo Melo/Robby Ginepri (Freedoms) 3   1‚Äì3 - bgcolor=\\"ffbbbb\\"   5  July 17  The Pavilion Radnor Township, Pennsylvania  Washington Kastles 21, PHILADELPHIA FREEDOMS 20 * XD: Taylor Townsend/Marcelo Melo (Freedoms) 5, Anastasia Rodionova/Leander Paes (Kastles) 2 * WS: Madison Brengle (Kastles) 5, Taylor Townsend (Freedoms) 3 * MD: Denis Kudla/Leander Paes (Kastles) 5, Robby Ginepri/Marcelo Melo (Freedoms) 3 * WD: Asia Muhammad/Taylor Townsend (Freedoms) 5, Madison Brengle/Anastasia Rodionova (Kastles) 4 * MS: Denis Kudla (Kastles) 5, Robby Ginepri (Freedoms) 4   1‚Äì4 - bgcolor=\\"ffbbbb\\"   6  July 18  Kastles Stadium at the Charles E.

It is approximately 6 mi northeast of Warren. It is fed by Mosquito Creek and Walnut Creek. Construction was completed in 1944. ==Description== Mosquito Creek Lake is a man-made reservoir. It is the second-largest inland lake in Ohio.Mosquito Creek Lake, US Army Corps of Engineers, retrieved 8 April 2015 Depth averages 8 to 15 feet (depending on season), but the southern end, towards the dam, averages . The northern end is considerably more shallow, with depths averaging only 4 to 10 feet. Completely surrounding the lake is Mosquito Lake State Park. The lake is bisected by the Ohio State Route 88 causeway. The drainage area for lake is . ==History== Initial plans for Mosquito Creek Reservoir were developed in the 1930s. The reservoir was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1938 and it was constructed as a means for flood control and the regulation of streamflow. Construction of the dam that created the lake was completed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in April, 1944. The reservoir provides flood protection for the upper Ohio River, Beaver river and the Mahoning River valley. Additional benefits contemplated were reduction in pollution from local steel processing, and the provision of water supply to the city of Warren. In 1971 the Board on Geographic Names Decisions officially changed the name from Mosquito Creek Reservoir to Mosquito Creek Lake. ==Recreation== The lake is surrounded by Mosquito Lake State Park, operated by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. There are picnicking and camping, as well as designated hiking trails. Opportunities for water recreation are provided, including dock rentals, boat ramps, and various watercraft rentals. Fishing for flathead catfish is highly recommended at the location. Other species recreationally fished in the lake are bluegill, channel catfish, crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, ring perch, and walleye. ==Ecological issues== The north part of the lake is a designated refuge for waterfowl. Boating and fishing are prohibited in these areas. There has been concern that the Asian carp will reach Lake Erie via Mosquito Creek Reservoir, but the probability of this occurrence has been deemed low. Invasive Zebra mussels have proliferated in the lake. This causes the lake's water to be more transpicuous than normal, and subsequently water-plants thrive in the ecosystem. Soon after construction the lake's water was considered among the best in the area, but man-made pollution from nearby residential areas has been a concern. ==References *Mosquito Creek State Park Category:Bodies of water of Trumbull County, Ohio Category:Reservoirs in Ohio ","title":"Mosquito Creek Lake"},{"id":"46298194","text":"Constructionline is a register for pre-qualified contractors and consultants used by the construction industry of the United Kingdom.

Originally established by the UK government in 1998, it was later acquired and operated by Capita before being bought by Warburg Pincus in June 2018. ==History== The 1994 Latham Report recommended the establishment of a national database of pre-qualification information which all public sector procurers could use. Constructionline was established in 1998 by the UK government to provide a single point of reference for all pre-qualification data for the construction industry. It was originally operated under a concession agreement by Capita. In July 2014 the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills announced it was looking to sell the database and in January 2015 it was subsequently acquired outright by Capita for ¬£35m. Constructionline provides procurement and supply chain management services, helping buyers source suppliers. As well as its database, Constructionline hosted Meet the Buyer and supplier engagement events across the UK. In 31 January 2018, Capita announced it planned to sell Constructionline as part of a transformation programme including disposal of non-core assets and cost cutting. In June 2018, it was reported that Constructionline had been sold to private equity investor Warburg Pincus for ¬£160m. ==Criticisms== Constructionline has faced criticisms from construction bodies. Many public sector clients continued to use their own bespoke pre-qualification procedures, because Constructionline relied on self-certification and did not command clients' confidence. In 2008, the House of Commons Business and Enterprise Select Committee said Constructionline had \\"proved unsatisfactory for the industry. The Government should either make it work, or abandon it.\\" Constructionline was also criticised for increasing specialist contractors' costs by insisting on accreditation to the Contractors Health and Safety Assessment Scheme (CHAS) rather than compliance. ==References * Constructionline website Category:Department for Business, Innovation and Skills Category:Construction industry of the United Kingdom ","title":"Constructionline"},{"id":"46298204","text":"Peter Albert Raftery, CVO, MBE (8 June 1929 ‚Äì 10 June 1996)Peter Raftery.

The court pointed out that the lower court's ruling had been an \\"abrupt departure\\" from the intent of the feticide law as shown by prior usage, which consisted of cases in which a pregnant woman and her unborn child were the victims of violence. The court also said that it was not possible to claim that lawmakers had intended the feticide law to be used to prosecute women trying to abort because the state abortion laws had already since the 1800s explicitly protected pregnant women from prosecution. \\"The state's about-face in this proceeding is unsettling, as well as untenable\\" under prior court precedent, Judge Terry Crone wrote in the ruling. The court said that Patel endangered the child by not seeking medical care but that prosecutors failed to prove that her failure to do so resulted in the child's death. Patel's case had caused international controversy because the overturned conviction had opened the door for any woman who expresses doubt about her pregnancy to be charged if she miscarries or has a stillbirth. If her conviction had not been overturned, she would have been the first woman in the United States to be charged, convicted, and sentenced on a feticide charge. Her case has also been compared to the prosecution of Bei Bei Shuai under similar circumstances. == The events on July 13, 2013 == On July 13, 2013, Patel \\"delivered a baby boy measuring thirty-one centimeters (approximately one foot) long and weighing 660 grams (slightly less than one and a half pounds)\\" at home in her bathroom. After sending a text to a friend stating \\"Just lost the baby\\", Patel \\"placed the baby in a plastic shopping bag containing bathroom trash and an airline boarding pass with Patel's name.\\" On her way to a medical facility to get help for her uninterrupted bleeding, Patel \\"put the bag containing the baby into a dumpster\\". At St. Joseph Regional Medical Center in Mishawaka, Indiana, \\"[b]ased on the size of the umbilical cord...[examining physicians] Ob/gyn Dr. Tracy Byrne and OB/GYN Dr. Kelly McGuire...determined that 'there had to have been a baby'\\". After questioning by both doctors, Patel \\"finally acknowledged that she had given birth to a baby and stated that she had put it in a paper bag and placed it in a dumpster behind a Target store\\". \\"Because '[i]t was a warm night and based on the size of the umbilical cord[,]' Dr. McGuire 'thought that [they] could find a baby that was far enough along that could still be alive' and left the hospital to search for it\\". \\"Officers searched dumpsters in that area and finally found the plastic bag containing Patel's baby at 12:06 a.m.\\" == Criminal proceedings == The prosecution alleged that the miscarriage had been caused by an abortifacient per her documented text messages exchanged with her friend, even though doctors found no trace of the drugs in her body. Prosecutors charged Patel with feticide for allegedly inducing an abortion, as the pills in question had been purchased online overseas, which is illegal in the United States. The prosecutor claimed that Indiana's law allows for women to be convicted of feticide for attempting to end a pregnancy even if the fetus survives. They also charged her with child neglect after claiming that the fetus had been alive when born.  Lung float test  The defense pathologist testified that the 23- or 24-week fetus was stillborn, with lungs insufficiently developed to breathe, while the prosecution pathologist testified that the fetus was at 25 to 30 weeks and was born alive. The prosecutors used a widely discredited lung float test to determine whether the fetus took a breath after birth. The procedure tests the buoyancy of the lungs in the belief that lungs that float suggest that the fetus took a breath, and the lungs in this case did float. Forensic experts discredit the use of such a test in criminal proceedings because of the number of false positives on record. The jury in Patel's case determined the fetus had been alive and found Patel guilty of child neglect.  Appeal  On April 22, 2015, Patel filed an appeal to the ruling. Her lawyers aimed to challenge the feticide charge and the lung float test evidence. On January 28, 2016, the Indiana Court of Appeals agreed to hear oral arguments in the appeal. A three-member panel of judges heard arguments from both sides on May 23. On July 22, 2016, the court ruled in her favor and specified that the legislature had not intended for the feticide statute to be applied to illegal self-induced abortion, and so it vacated the feticide charge. The court also ruled that while the state had proven that the child was born alive, it did not prove that the child would not have died if she had sought immediate medical attention. It therefore vacated the Class A neglect charge and remanded her to the trial court with instructions to enter judgment of conviction for class D felony neglect of a dependent and resentence her accordingly. == See also == *Bei Bei Shuai == References == Category:1980s births Category:Living people Category:American Hindus Category:Prisoners and detainees of Indiana Category:Legal history of Indiana ","title":"Purvi Patel"},{"id":"46298311","text":"Bad Night is an American adventure film starring YouTube personalities Jenn McAllister and Lauren Luthringshausen. The screenplay was written by Daniel Kinno and directed by Chris and Nick Riedell. The film was released on July 21, 2015 exclusively through Vimeo on Demand. ==Plot== Kate (Lauren Elizabeth Luthringshausen) and Abby (Jenn McAllister) are heading to school for a field trip for their art history class that will award them extra credit if they attend. Right before Kate joins her classmates to wait for the school bus, she is informed by her parents that they are no longer able to pay for her college education due to another one of her father's failed investments, much to Kate's disappointment. After a morning spent at an art museum, the class stops at a restaurant for lunch. Although Kate and Abby find the food served repulsive and sickening, their classmates willingly consume it. Kate and Abby decide to eat granola bars Abby brought instead of the served food. While the class is on its way to its next stop after leaving the restaurant, everyone on the bus except for Kate and Abby become nauseous due to the lunch they ate and start vomiting. The teacher, having also eaten the food, brings the class to a motel to spend the night and recover. As Kate and Abby are in the motel asking for rooms, Abby notices an envelope on the counter with the names Viceroy and Monarch written on them. Meanwhile, Ari (Matt Walsh), gang leader and the owner of a nearby roller skating rink, meets with a driver known as Wheels (Owen Smith) and negotiates a deal. Wheels must drive the two art thieves Ari has hired, who go by the code names Viceroy and Monarch, to help them steal a painting that Ari plans to sell. In return, Wheels will receive a sum of money from the exchange. Wheels agrees to the deal, but on the condition that he will cut off all connections with Ari after this final job. Ari informs Wheels of the motel where the art thieves are to be picked up, which is revealed to be the same motel where Kate and Abby are staying. Kate and Abby, bored with staying in their room, decide to sneak out of the motel to entertain themselves. To avoid identification, Kate names herself and Abby Viceroy and Monarch when ordering a ride. At the same time, the real Viceroy (Julianna Guill) and Monarch (Judy Marte) are preparing to leave the motel for their job to steal the painting Ari hired them to steal. Kate and Abby exit their rooms and find Wheels waiting in his car in the parking lot. With Wheels thinking that Kate and Abby are Viceroy and Monarch and Kate and Abby thinking that Wheels is their driver, Wheels lets them in and drives off while, unbeknownst to them, two of Ari's henchmen follow. Immediately after they leave, Brian, the driver Kate ordered, shows up and picks up the real Viceroy and Monarch. Kate and Abby get Wheels to take them to a thrift store as their first stop, while Brian drops Viceroy and Monarch off at the painting's location. Viceroy and Monarch manage to obtain the painting and continue their operation as Kate and Abby continue their fun night out. They almost get caught by the police, but Monarch manages to take them down while Brian watches in surprise and tries to drive away. Viceroy and Monarch hold Brian at gunpoint and demand that he start talking. When Brian tells them that he is just a driver for a ride-share company, Viceroy and Monarch realize that they got into the wrong car and reveal to Brian that they are in fact undercover FBI agents. Meanwhile, as Kate and Abby are getting tattoos, Wheels realizes that they are not actually Viceroy and Monarch and tells them that they have to leave immediately, just as Ari calls his henchmen (who have been following Kate and Abby, thinking they are Viceroy and Monarch) and tells them to bring Viceroy and Monarch to him right away. Wheels tries to help Kate and Abby escape, but the three encounter Ari's henchmen. Wheels tells Kate and Abby to run while he attempts to fight off the henchmen. However, despite their efforts to escape, Kate and Abby are captured and brought to Ari, who believes they are Viceroy and Monarch. While Abby attempts to explain that they are students, Kate lies and tells Ari that they are Viceroy and Monarch and they have what he wants. Ari holds Abby hostage and demands that Kate get the painting, threatening to kill Abby should she fail. Despite Abby's pleas for Kate to stay with her, Kate runs back to the motel to get help, where she meets the real Viceroy and Monarch, who have been going through the motel's security footage to find who took the ride meant for them. With no other choice, Viceroy and Monarch get Kate to pose as Monarch (and gets Kate to pose Abby as Viceroy) and deliver the painting to Ari. As Ari waits for his buyer to arrive and authenticate the painting, Wheels (whose name he has already revealed as Andy) comes in and attempts to convince Ari that Kate and Abby are not Viceroy and Monarch. In response, Ari shows Wheels the painting Kate delivered to him, completely torpedoing Wheels' credibility. Ari's buyer comes and authenticates the painting, but just as she finishes, a clown under Ari's extortion arrives and initiates a shootout. In the ensuing gunfire, Viceroy and Monarch and take down Ari's henchmen and buyer. Ari prepares to shoot Kate and Abby for snitching, but Wheels tackles Ari before he does so. As the buyer tries to escape, Brian, who has been waiting outside, runs over her with his car. Viceroy and Monarch come in and meet Abby and Wheels for the first time, and reveal that they were working for an undercover unit specializing in recovering lost and stolen artwork. The group destroys Brian's car to remove any stray links and Viceroy tells Kate and Abby to keep all events of the night confidential. Wheels takes Kate and Abby back to their motel and, to Kate's pleasant surprise, gives Kate a stack of cash to help with her college fund. Kate and Abby reunite with their class and continue their art history field trip. ==Cast== *Jenn McAllister as Abby *Lauren Elizabeth Luthringshausen as Kate *Matt Walsh as Ari *Julianna Guill as Viceroy *Judy Marte as Monarch *Owen Smith as Wheels *Molly Ringwald as The Collector *June Diane Raphael as Ms. Goldstein *Casey Wilson as Billy The Tattoo Artist *Adam Pally as The Painter *Eric Edelstein as Skull *Jim O'Heir as Bob *Eddie Pepitone as The Clown *Marc Evan Jackson as John *Carrie Clifford as Liz *John Mark Loudermilk as Chad *Dan Levy as Meatball *JTG as Knuckles ==Release== The film was released on July 21, 2015 exclusively through Vimeo on Demand.

Senate and Assembly districts consisted of approximately the same number of inhabitants, the area being apportioned contiguously without restrictions regarding county boundaries. At this time there were two major political parties: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. The Conservative Party, the Right to Life Party, the Liberal Party, the New Alliance Party and the Socialist Workers Party also nominated tickets. ==Elections== The New York state election, 1986, was held on November 4. Governor Mario Cuomo was re-elected, and Congressman Stan Lundine was elected Lieutenant Governor, both Democrats. The elections to the other three statewide elective offices resulted in the re-election of the three incumbent officeholders: a Republican Comptroller, a Democratic Attorney General and a Republican U.S. Senator. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for Governor, was: Democrats 2,655,000; Republicans 1,212,000; Conservatives 152,000; Right to Life 131,000; Liberals 120,000; New Alliance 24,000. The Socialist Workers' candidate for U.S. Senator polled about 7,300 votes. 21 of the 24 women members of the previous legislature‚ÄîState Senators Mary B.

Barbara M. Clark (Dem.), of Queens, was also elected to the Assembly. On April 28, 1987, Audrey Pheffer (Dem.), of Queens, was elected to fill the vacancy in the Assembly caused by the resignation of Gerdi E. Lipschutz. On June 16, 1987, Patricia McGee (Rep.), of Franklinville, was elected to fill a vacancy in the Assembly. The New York state election, 1987, was held on November 3. Assemblywoman Toni Rettaliata (Rep.) was elected as Supervisor of the Town of Huntington. On March 15, 1988, Earlene Hill Hooper (Dem.), of Hempstead, was elected to fill the vacancy in the Assembly caused by the appointment of Barbara Patton to the NYS Workers' Compensation Board.

The station will be located in a trench on the east side of Interstate 5, on the north side of Northeast 185th Street. It will include an adjacent bus station and a parking garage on the west side of the freeway. The station is scheduled to open in 2024, with the rest of the line. ==History== The Shoreline area developed as a suburban bedroom community in the early 20th century, centering around the Seattle‚ÄìEverett Interurban Railway and later State Highway 99 on Aurora Avenue. The area east of Aurora Avenue had one major commercial center, North City, which developed in the 1940s along 15th Avenue Northeast. Interstate 5 was constructed through the area between Aurora and North City in the early 1960s, roughly along 5th Avenue Northeast. In 1957, the Seattle Transit Commission proposed using the freeway's right of way for a rapid rail transit system, including a stop at \\"Richmond\\" near NE 185th Street. The proposal was rejected by the state government over financing concerns, as federal and state highway funds could not be used for the necessary property acquisition. Planning for a modern light rail system was delegated to the Transit Commission's successor, Metro Transit, in the 1970s. Although the Interstate 5 corridor was left out of the Forward Thrust proposals, put to two votes in 1968 and 1970 that ultimately failed, it was reconsidered in a 1986 proposal by Metro and the Puget Sound Council of Governments, which placed a station serving North City at NE 185th Street. The proposal was never formally adopted, but was the basis for later proposals by the Regional Transit Agency, which later became Sound Transit. In 1995, the RTA proposed the construction of a regional light rail system, including a line from Seattle to Lynnwood that stopped at 175th Street NE in Shoreline. The plan was rejected by voters and re-sized into a successful 1996 ballot measure, which only constructed light rail from the University of Washington campus in Seattle to Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport. Public involvement in planning A community group recognized by Shoreline, called 185th Station-Area Citizens Committee (185SCC) was formed in 2012. The formal planning process in Shoreline started in May 2013. Public involvement in the planning surrounding light rail in Shoreline is said to be greater than it was for the Central Link in central Seattle. The Central Link planning has been characterized as \\"ST went into their neighborhood, telling people what they were going to do and providing little avenue for community input or influence.\\" Public involvement has not always been orderly. At a March 2015 public forum in Shoreline on rezoning, the city's mayor threatened to have rowdy, shouting participants ejected by police. ==Station layout== {table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" width=50 valign=top style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border- top:solid 1px gray;\\" width=100 valign=topStreet level style=\\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;border-top:solid 1px gray\\" width=550 valign=topTo Exits/Entrances, ticket vending machines - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" width=50 rowspan=6 valign=topPlatform level  width=100 rowspan=2Northbound  width=390‚Üê Line 1 (Planned) toward Lynnwood City Center (Mountlake Terrace) -  width=390‚Üê Line 2 (Planned) toward Lynnwood City Center (Mountlake Terrace) - style=\\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border- bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\\" colspan=2 - style=\\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" rowspan=2Southbound style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"‚Üí Line 1 (Planned) toward Angle Lake (Shoreline South/145th) ‚Üí - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"‚Üí Line 2 (Planned) toward Redmond Technology Center (Shoreline South/145th) ‚Üí } Shoreline North/185th station will consist of a single island platform situated below street level in a trench.

Baer (April 14, 1903 ‚Äì July 24, 1994) was a German/Swiss/American bookbinder. He specialized in fine leather bindings, including inlays and gold tooling. Much of Baer's work involved the restoration of old and rare books for both private customers and numerous rare book libraries around the world. His well-established reputation in this field led to an invitation to help restore books in the Florence, Italy libraries that were water-damaged in the devastating 1966 Flood of the Arno River. Mostly working from his private studios, books bound by him were sold to patrons including Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, the President of France, and Pope Pius XII. ==Early life and training== George Adolf Baer was born in Hoboken NJ of German parents, who had immigrated to the US in September, 1902, but returned to Germany shortly after George‚Äôs birth. George grew up in Wiesbaden, a German city along the Main River, near Frankfurt. He served a three-year apprenticeship at a book binding company in Wiesbaden from 1919 to 1922. As he recounted in a taped interview,‚Äù this was not a fine binding establishment‚Äù. It involved strictly binding books with cloth covers. After a year working at a paper making factory and teaching bookbinding in an art school, he decided to pursue fine bookbinding. In 1924 at the age of 21, he was accepted at the Berlin School of Applied Arts under the tutelage of Paul Kersten, one of the foremost bookbinders in Germany. ==Teaching career== In addition to learning the art of leather binding and gold tooling, Kersten engaged Baer to assist in teaching at the Applied Arts school. In October of 1925 Baer was offered his first independent position at the Staatliche Kunstgewerbeschule in Kassel to teach bookbinding. In March of 1927, Baer had an offer to set up a bookbinding school and to teach bookbinding in Lixouri on the Ionian island of Cephalonia in Greece. He spent 3 ¬Ω years there before returning to Germany in 1931. ==Life in Switzerland== However, by 1931 the Nazi movement in Germany made it difficult for Baer, whose father was Jewish, to find employment. So, he decided to move to Z√ºrich in Switzerland. Within a few years he set up his own shop and married Martha Lena (Maly) Guyer, a Swiss artist at that time specializing in fabric design, primarily curtains for upscale restaurants. During the next 15 years a number of George Baer‚Äôs book covers were designed or greatly influenced by Maly. In 1941 the Baers with their sons bought a farmhouse in Bassersdorf, a small village just outside of Z√ºrich, where they practiced their respective crafts, tended a large garden, and managed a small menagerie of sheep, chickens, and eventually even a cow. After the war several weekly magazines featured this bookbinder/artist/ farming family that by all appearances seemed to have found ‚Äúthe happy life‚Äù. Among the problems not mentioned in these articles was the fact that Maly, whose Swiss roots go back to Jakob Gujer (also written as Guyer) in the early 1700‚Äôs, lost her Swiss citizenship because she married a foreigner, and their three Swiss born children also were stateless. As a result, early in the war, the US-born George Baer contacted the US consulate in Z√ºrich to establish his right to US citizenship. In 1949, being unable to resolve the citizenship issue with the Swiss authorities, George Baer decided to move to the US where the rest of the family joined him in 1951. ==Career in the United States== Through Baer‚Äôs earlier work in restoring ancient Aramaic letters for Ludwig Borchardt, an Egyptologist in Cairo, he made contact with Prof. Keith Seele at the Chicago Oriental Institute who helped him find a position in the fine binding department of the Cuneo Press. Fine binding was a flourishing art at the time in Chicago with such binders as Leonard Mounteney, Alfred de Sauty, Harold Trobolet, Elisabeth Knerr, George Baer and later William Anthony all active. Among these George Baer was particularly noted for his ‚Äúbold and imaginative covers, with sensitive use of color‚Äù. Baer worked at the Cuneo Press fine binding department from 1950 to 1971, as well as in his own workshop binding books for private clients and restoring books for libraries, especially the University of Minnesota Rare Book room. In 1972 George Baer moved to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where he continued working from his home, binding and/or restoring books for the University of North Carolina Rare Book room as well as for private clients in the region. In addition, he taught bookbinding for several years through the UNC evening college. When George Baer finally retired a second time at the age of 81, he donated his collection of fine bindings and other documents to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Library. The books are now housed in the Rare Book Room as part of the George Baer Collection of Bookbinding (see link in the External Link Section). ==George Baer as an Artist== When Baer first studied fine bookbinding in the early 1920s with Paul Kersten in Berlin, the decorative designs on books were traditional and often very ornate. But, just at this time German art and applied art were being transformed by the Bauhaus movement initiated by the architect, Walter Gropius. This group of artists stressed the merger of function and art as well as simplicity of design. It became Baer‚Äôs guiding principle in binding and decorating books. As he pointed out in a taped interview in 1986, Baer said that a book, first of all, has to be well constructed and should be bound so that it can be read ‚Äì ‚Äúa well-bound book should last 100 to 200 years‚Äù. For this reason Baer did not like the ‚ÄúFrench method of book binding because they shaved the leather too thin‚Äù to make them elegant but at the expense of a considerably shorter life span for the binding. In addition, Baer adopted simple and clean modern designs that were inspired by the book‚Äôs content. ‚ÄúWhen I was a student I was told a bookbinder should never read books, otherwise he would not make a living.‚Äú But early on he began his work ‚Äúby reading the book and getting a feeling for the design, type and colors‚Äù and then he reflected, ‚Äúsometimes for months‚Äù, until he got the idea for the book cover design. ==Exhibitions== *Exposition Internationale des Arts et des Techniques, Paris (1937) *Swiss Landesaustellung, Zurich (1939) *Traveling Exhibitions in Germany and Sweden (1959) *Chicago Public Library (1961) *Kalamazoo Institute of Arts (1962) *John Crerar Library, then at the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago (1965) *Milwaukee Public Library (1967) ==Selected Books Bound by George Baer== Sockman1962.jpg Christmas.Book.jpg Collections de quelques vues.1782.jpg ==References * Books and Documents in the George Baer Collection of Bookbinding Category:1903 births Category:1994 deaths Category:Bookbinders ","title":"George A.

The road continues through Kyetume and Kisoga; one branch continues south to Katosi on the northern shores of Lake Victoria, and another branch runs east, through Nkokonjeru and Buikwe, to end at Nyenga in Buikwe District. The total length of the road is approximately . The coordinates of the road near Nkokonjeru are 0¬∞14'40.0\\"N, 32¬∞54'43.0\\"E (Latitude:0.2444; Longitude:32.9119). ==Overview== This road, which was gravel-surfaced until 2014, had been a concern of the Ugandan government since the National Resistance Movement came to power in 1986. In 1996, the Ugandan president promised to find resources within government to tarmac the road. For many years, during the reading of the national budget, this road has been earmarked for widening and upgrading to a tarmac surface. In 2011 after an international bidding process, Eutaw Construction Limited, allegedly a subsidiary of Eutaw Construction Inc., a Mississippi-based entity, presented the winning bid of USh165 billion (approx.:US$66 million in 2011 money). The work would be supervised by Arab Consulting Engineers from Egypt. On 7 July 2014, President Yoweri Museveni officially commissioned the beginning of construction of the road, with work projected to last three years. ==Controversy== The first sign of trouble was when it was discovered that the company carrying out the road work was not Eutaw Construction Limited (EUTAW), which had won the bid, but Chongqing International Construction Corporation (CICO), which has Chinese roots. Although CICO is a well-known company in Uganda, where it has built a number of roads, it had been knocked out of the bidding for this road. The work itself was progressing well, but subcontracting without the consent of UNRA was expressly forbidden by the contract agreement between EUTAW and UNRA. Also, if subcontracting is approved, it cannot exceed 30 percent of the work load. In this case, the entire contract had been subcontracted. Then it came to light that EUTAW did not exist; it was a \\"briefcase\\" company. Uganda's Inspector General of Government (IGG) intervened and halted CICO from proceeding with the work. Uganda's attorney general at the time, Peter Nyombi, opined that the IGG did not know what she was doing, recommending that CICO be allowed to continue with the work. Accusations and finger-pointing among government bureaucrats ensued. Investigations by the Uganda Police Force and the IGG are continuing. During the process, the following have taken place as of April 2015: # Litigation has been initiated against Eutaw Construction Limited in Uganda. # CICO has been stopped from working further on the road. # The managing director, the chief legal officer, the chief planning officer, and the chief finance officer at the UNRA have been suspended while the investigations continue. # During the cabinet reshuffle of 1 March 2015, Attorney General Nyombi was dropped from the cabinet and was replaced by his former deputy Fred Ruhindi. # While kept in the cabinet in the 1 March 2015 reshuffle, former Minister of Works and Transport Abraham Byandala was removed from the ministry and replaced by his former deputy, John Byabagambi. Byandala was named the new Minister without Portfolio. The road contract has been re-tendered, with CICO excluded from the process. A new consortium, composed of Solel Boneh International and Reynolds Construction Company emerged as the best bidder. Work has resumed, starting where CICO left off in September 2014. The new contract price is UGX:179 billion to complete the work and cover additional roads not originally included in the cancelled EUTAW contract. New roads include the tarmacking of the Nyenga-Njeru road, measuring approximately to connect with the New Jinja Bridge and relieve the main Kampala-Jinja Highway. Other roads include access roads to the Katosi landing site and an access road to the Buikwe District offices at Buikwe. ==See also== * List of roads in Uganda ==References * Website of Uganda National Roads Authority Category:Roads in Uganda Category:Buikwe District Category:Mukono District ","title":"Mukono‚ÄìKyetume‚ÄìKatosi‚ÄìNyenga Road"},{"id":"46298696","text":"The 2015 Austin Aces season was the 13th season of the franchise in World TeamTennis (WTT) and its second and final season in Greater Austin, Texas. The Aces had the best regular-season record in WTT and defeated the California Dream in the Western Conference Championship Match. It was the first conference title for the franchise since 2006 (as the Newport Beach Breakers). The Aces fell in the WTT Final to the Washington Kastles who won their fifth consecutive King Trophy as WTT champions. The Aces were led by Teymuraz Gabashvili who was named WTT Male Most Valuable Player and Alla Kudryavtseva who was named WTT Female Rookie of the Year. Coach Rick Leach was named WTT Coach of the Year. On December 14, 2015, the Aces' owner Lorne Abony announced that the team had been unable to find a suitable permanent venue and would move back to Orange County, California for the 2016 season and be renamed the Orange County Breakers. The Aces officially reported their average home attendance in 2014, as 2,155. However, general manager Allen Hardison said that the real figure may have been closer to 1,300. In 2015, the average attendance was approximately 950, even though the first 1,000 fans at the gates for the Western Conference Championship Match who had an online code were admitted for free. Hardison was complimentary of the staffs at both Cedar Park Center and Gregory Gymnasium, and he also noted that the fans who supported the Aces were \\"some of the best in the league.\\" Hardison said that in order for a WTT franchise to survive, it has to have a venue that meets established criteria for location, venue type and availability, and that ideally offers an outdoor setting. Although the team's new home court was not immediately announced, officials with a desirable venue in Orange County had reportedly reached out to the Aces to lure them back. ==Season recap== Draft At the WTT draft on March 16, 2015, the Aces protected Andy Roddick in the marquee portion of the draft. In the roster portion of the draft, the Aces didn't protect any players from their 2014 roster. They selected Nicole Gibbs, Alla Kudryavtseva, Jarmere Jenkins and Teymuraz Gabashvili. Move to Downtown Austin On March 30, 2015, the Aces announced the team would play its 2015 home matches at the Gregory Gymnasium in Downtown Austin. The team expects that the venue, currently primarily used for women's college volleyball, will seat more than 3,500 fans when configured for tennis. Aces owner Lorne Abony said, \\"As soon as the 2014 season ended, we began evaluating all aspects of this team, from the record on the court to the sponsorships sold to the number of fans in the stands. From feedback we received and the analysis that was done by our front office, we felt that a relocation to a venue located closer to the city center would be in our team's best interest. We are thrilled to have been able to find a downtown home in Gregory Gym on the UT campus as the Aces work to become Austin‚Äôs premier professional sports brand and the must-attend sporting event each summer.\\" Roddick out for the season On July 13, 2015, the Aces announced that their marquee player, Andy Roddick, would miss the entire 2015 season with an ankle injury. Roddick was injured in London working as a television commentator for the BBC's coverage of the 2015 Wimbledon Championships. The Aces offered all fans with paid tickets to their July 16 home opener at which Roddick was scheduled to play complementary vouchers redeemable for a tickets to a future Aces home match. Opening day Just hours after receiving the news that Andy Roddick would miss the season, the Aces opened up on the road against the Boston Lobsters. Teymuraz Gabashvili won the opening set of men's singles, 5‚Äì2, and Alla Kudryavtseva and Nicole Gibbs followed with a 5‚Äì4 women's doubles set win to give the Aces a 10‚Äì6 lead. After the Aces dropped the mixed doubles set, Gibbs took the fourth set in women's singles, 5‚Äì2, to give the Aces a 17‚Äì13 lead heading to the final set. Gabashvili and Jarmere Jenkins dropped the men's doubles set, 5‚Äì4, but won the first game of extended play to secure a 22‚Äì18 victory. First match in Downtown Austin After a successful season-opening road trip that included an upset victory over the four-time defending WTT champion Washington Kastles, the Aces returned to their new home in Downtown Austin as the only undefeated team in WTT with 2 wins and 0 losses. After the Aces lost the opening set of women's doubles, 5‚Äì2, they found themselves trailing the California Dream in the mixed doubles set, 4‚Äì2, and in the match, 9‚Äì4. But after the Dream substituted Jarmila Gajdo≈°ov√° for Anabel Medina Garrigues, the Aces turned the set around and took it, 5‚Äì4. It was a powerful backhand down the line by Alla Kudryavtseva to convert a break point that seemed to turn around the set and the match and get the home crowd behind the Aces. Jarmere Jenkins and Teymuraz Gabashvili took the third set of men's doubles, 5‚Äì2, and the Aces had a 12‚Äì11 halftime lead. Gajdo≈°ov√° took the fourth set of women's singles from Nicole Gibbs to put the Dream back in front, 16‚Äì15. But Gabashvili secured a 20‚Äì19 victory for the Aces by taking the final set of men's singles, 5‚Äì3. Another comeback win In their fifth match of the season, the Aces hosted the Springfield Lasers on July 18, at Gregory Gymnasium. The Lasers won the first two sets to take a 10‚Äì3 lead in the match. Alla Kudryavtseva and Teymuraz Gabashvili got the comeback started by taking the third set of mixed doubles, 5‚Äì2, to cut the Lasers' lead to 12‚Äì8. Jarmere Jenkins and Gabashvili took a tiebreaker in men's doubles for a 5‚Äì4 set win that cut the deficit to 16‚Äì13 heading to the final set. Gabashvili's powerful serve was too much for Michael Russell to handle, and a 5‚Äì2 set win in men's singles for the Aces tied the score of the match at 18. Gabashvili overwhelmed Russell in the super tiebreaker, 7‚Äì1, to earn a dramatic 19‚Äì18 victory for the Aces. Eight-match winning streak The Aces season-opening winning streak reached eight matches on July 22, with a 23‚Äì16 road win over the Springfield Lasers. The Aces won four of the five sets led by Nicole Gibbs who closed the match with a 5‚Äì1 set win in women's singles after earlier teaming with Alla Kudryavtseva for a 5‚Äì3 set win in women's doubles. Kudryavtseva and Teymuraz Gabashvili won the mixed doubles set, and Gabashvili opened the match by winning the men's singles set. The Aces suffered their first loss of the season the following evening against the Philadelphia Freedoms. Clinching a playoff berth The Aces stumbled into their July 26 home match against the defending Western Conference champion San Diego Aviators having lost their previous two matches. With an opportunity to clinch a playoff berth in front of the home fans, the Aces responded with a dominant performance winning all five sets for a 25‚Äì8 victory. In registering their biggest margin of victory of the season, the Aces earned the franchise's first playoff berth since 2012. The Aces won two sets by 5‚Äì0 scores: Nicole Gibbs in women's singles and Gibbs and Alla Kudryavtseva in women's doubles. Kudryavtseva and Teymuraz Gabashvili opened the match with a 5‚Äì3 set win in mixed doubles. Gabashvili and Jarmere Jenkins took the men's doubles, 5‚Äì2. With the Aces leading 20‚Äì5 after four sets, Jenkins made his Aces singles debut and responded with a 5‚Äì3 set win, breaking serve in the eighth game to secure the victory. Aces sign Svitolina On July 27, 2015, the Aces announced they had signed Elina Svitolina, the 20th ranked female player in the world at the time, as a wildcard player. With three matches remaining in the regular season, Svitolina would be eligible to play for the Aces in the playoffs if she appeared in all three of those matches. That same day, Svitolina made her Aces debut on the road against the San Diego Aviators. A first-place finish The Aces clinched the top seed in the Western Conference and home-court advantage for the Western Conference Championship Match on July 27, when the Washington Kastles defeated the California Dream, 19‚Äì17. Later that evening, the Aces earned a road victory against the San Diego Aviators, 25‚Äì13, in extended play to improve their record to 10 wins and 2 losses. Best record in WTT On July 28, 2015, the Aces welcomed the four-time defending WTT champion Washington Kastles to Gregory Gymnasium with a chance to clinch the best overall regular-season record in WTT for 2015. Trailing 10‚Äì7 after two sets, Teymuraz Gabashvili gave the Aces a 12‚Äì10 lead with a 5‚Äì0 set win over Sam Querrey in men's singles. After dropping the fourth set of mixed doubles, the Aces found themselves trailing, 15‚Äì14, heading into the final set of women's singles. Elina Svitolina, making her Aces home debut, topped Madison Brengle, 5‚Äì1, to give the Aces a 19‚Äì16 victory and the best overall regular-season record in WTT for 2015. Western Conference championship The Aces hosted the California Dream in the Western Conference Championship Match on July 30, 2015. The originally-scheduled start time of the match of 7:00 p.m. CDT was pushed back, because weather issues caused the Dream's flight to be delayed. The first ball was finally struck at 9:43 p.m. CDT, and the Aces took charge from the start with Teymuraz Gabashvili and Alla Kudryavtseva opening the match with a 5‚Äì2 set win in mixed doubles. Kudryavtseva and Elina Svitolina followed with a 5‚Äì3 set win in women's doubles to give the Aces a 10‚Äì5 lead. Gabashvili and Jarmere Jenkins won a tiebreaker in men's doubles to increase the Aces' lead to 15‚Äì9 at halftime. Svitolina broke Jarmila Gajdo≈°ov√°, the top-ranked player in WTT in women's singles during the regular season, in the fourth and sixth games of the set for a 5‚Äì1 win and a 20‚Äì10 Aces lead with one set remaining. With the clock having already struck midnight, Gabashvili served an ace to end the tiebreaker in men's singles and give the Aces a dominant 25‚Äì14 victory and the Western Conference championship. The Aces won all five sets in securing the franchise's first conference title since 2006, when they were the Newport Beach Breakers. After the match, Gabashvili said, \\"It was amazing. I didn‚Äôt have a lot of pressure because my team did fantastic. We found our energy and showed our best. I am feeling great on the court.\\" WTT Final The Aces fell in the WTT Final on August 2, 2015, to the Washington Kastles who won their fifth consecutive King Trophy as WTT champions. The Kastles were led by WTT Final Most Valuable Player Leander Paes who teamed with Martina Hingis to take the opening set of mixed doubles from Teymuraz Gabashvili and Alla Kudryavtseva, 5‚Äì2, and then with Sam Querrey to win the men's doubles set, 5‚Äì3, over Gabashvili and Jarmere Jenkins. With the Kastles having won the first four sets and leading 20‚Äì13, Elina Svitolina faced Madison Brengle in the final set of women's singles. Svitolina fell behind a break early in the set but broke back twice for a 5‚Äì3 set win that sent the match to extended play with the Kastles leading, 23‚Äì18. Brengle hit a backhand winner in the first game of extended play to end the match and secure the title for the Kastles. ==Event chronology== * March 16, 2015: The Aces protected Andy Roddick and chose Nicole Gibbs, Alla Kudryavtseva, Jarmere Jenkins and Teymuraz Gabashvili at the WTT draft. * July 16, 2015: The Aces won their first home match at Gregory Gymnasium, 20‚Äì19, against the California Dream. * July 26, 2015: With a record of 9 wins and 2 losses, the Aces clinched a playoff berth with a 25‚Äì8 win over the San Diego Aviators. * July 27, 2015: The Aces signed Elina Svitolina as a wildcard player. * July 27, 2015: With a record of 9 wins and 2 losses, the Aces clinched first place in the Western Conference and home-court advantage for the Western Conference Championship Match when the Washington Kastles defeated the California Dream, 19‚Äì17. * July 28, 2015: With a record of 11 wins and 2 losses, the Aces clinched the best overall regular-season record in WTT with a 19‚Äì16 win over the Washington Kastles. * July 30, 2015: The Aces won the Western Conference championship with a 25‚Äì14 home victory over the California Dream. * August 2, 2015: The Aces lost the WTT Final to the Washington Kastles, 24‚Äì18, in extended play. * December 14, 2015: The Aces announced that the team would move back to Orange County, California for the 2016 season and be renamed the Orange County Breakers. ==Draft picks== Since the Aces had the best record among the three nonplayoff teams in 2014, they selected third in each round of the draft.

The film was shot in black-and-white. The film was a sequel to Voitheia! O Vengos faneros praktor 000 (1967). ==Title== The film title means Thou-Vou the Bald Agent and Operation Destruction of the Land\\"'. The title character is codenamed Thou-Vou (. \\"Thou\\" stands for Theta, \\"Vou\\" stands for Beta. They form the Greek initials of protagonist Thanasis Vengos (ŒòŒ±ŒΩŒ¨œÉŒ∑œÇ ŒíŒ≠Œ≥Œ≥ŒøœÇ, pronounced: Than√°ssis V√©gos). \\"Yis Mathiam\\" derives from the terms ŒìŒ∑œÇ (Yis or Gis) for \\"Land\\" and ŒúŒ±Œ¥ŒπŒ¨Œº (Mathiam or Madiam) for Midian, a Biblical area. The term is a byword of destruction in modern Greek. ==Plot== The inept secret agent Thou-Vou (Thanasis Vengos) has finally graduated. He and his fellow agent MAP 31 (Antonis Papadopoulos) partner up to open their own agency. Their first customers are drama film director Tzimis Paloukas (Vasilis Andreopoulos) and his associates from the film company \\"Ah Vah\\" (Greek: Œëœá ŒíŒ±œá, the term means woe). They task them with three missions but their true intention is to secretly film the agents in action. They are fully aware of their ineptness and intend to use the footage for Ah Vah's first comedy film. The missions are an excuse for a series of gags. One of their missions involves searching for a hippie by the name of Roza Alimonou (Sofi Zanninou). Thou-Vou is convinced that this is the true identity of a Romani woman who happens to go by the name Roza (Sassa Kazeli). The misunderstanding causes fights in a Romani camp. Another has them take part in a catch wrestling match against wrestler Spazokefalos (Dimitri Karystinos), whose professional name means \\"Headbreaker\\". The third has them interrupt the filming process of one of Ah Vah's rival firms. The final mission proves fatal for Thou-Vou. The film ends with the deceased agent in the afterlife, preparing to enter Heaven. == Cast == * Thanasis Veggos ..... Thou-Vou * Antonis Papadopoulos ..... Map 31 * Vasilis Andreopoulos .....

The film stars Ansel Elgort, Chlo√´ Grace Moretz, Catherine Keener, and David Strathairn. The film was released through video on demand on November 7, 2017, and opened in a limited release on December 8, 2017, by Stage 6 Films and Vertical Entertainment. == Plot == The film opens with old footage of a young Addison Schacht and his mother playing at the beach. A voice over reveals that Addison's mother died of an aneurysm six months prior to the events of the movie. In the present, teenaged Addison Schacht is delivering his application to the University of Chicago, along with his friend Phoebe Zeleny. After dropping off the envelope, the pair go to a local bakery for some coffee. There, they meet Kevin Broadus, who is a mutual friend of both Addison and Phoebe and an employee at the bakery. Once Addison and Phoebe get into their car, Phoebe admits that she is still a virgin, and would like them to lose their virginity together before they leave for college. Addison agrees and the two head to Phoebe's house to have sex. Shortly after they leave, an armed motorcyclist pulls up to the bakery and rushes inside with his gun drawn. Phoebe's mother calls to inform her that there was a shooting at the bakery, and that Kevin was killed. Addison heads home, but stops at the bakery, which is now an active crime scene. Addison asks a news cameraman about the shooting, and the cameraman admits that it was most likely due to gang violence. Addison is confused because he believed Kevin was not the kind of person to be involved with a street gang. Fed up with the authorities' dismissive claims about the shooting and his school's eagerness to forget about it, Addison starts his own investigation into Kevin's murder. He starts putting up posters around the school, asking anyone to call if they have more information about the shooting. Addison also steals Kevin's file from the school records, where he and Phoebe learn that Kevin was seeing the counselor because he seemed emotionally detached and distant. While at lunch one day, a student who was at the bakery the day Kevin was killed reveals that the shooter was white, and not black like the original police report said. The student also mentions that Kevin had been hanging out with a former student named Noel. Meanwhile, Addison is suspended for a week after administrators check his locker and find Kevin's stolen file. Phoebe tells Addison about the information she received, and the two decide to visit Noel in his shady Washington D.C. neighborhood. The two meet Noel and his accomplice D Cash, who tells Addison that they will be in touch. Addison decides to visit Kevin's parents to see if they have any information about why Kevin was murdered. An angered Mr. Broadus assaults Addison, and reveals that Kevin became much more secretive in the last year, as well as having a severe drug problem. Addison is later contacted by Noel and D Cash again, and he is told to meet them at a bar. Addison attempts to get Phoebe to leave her mother's house party, but she declines. Addison admits his feelings for her and leaves to meet Noel and D Cash. Noel and D Cash reveal that Kevin disrespected a powerful drug dealer at a nightclub several days before he was killed, and they agree to give Addison the name of a guy who was at the nightclub that night, as long as he makes a drug delivery to Chevy Chase (an affluent neighborhood they cannot get into). Addison delivers the drugs to a large mansion that belongs to Phoebe's friend Alex. After delivering the drugs, Addison receives the name of the man who was present at the nightclub, Mike Lorinner. Addison calls Phoebe and tells her about Mike, and she implores Addison to call the police and let them handle the situation. Addison ignores her and arrives at Lorinner's house. Addison sets up a video camera to record the confrontation. When Lorinner opens the door, Addison questions him about the night at the club. He tells Addison to leave, but further presses him about how he found him. At the same time that Lorinner notices the red \\"record\\" light coming from the camera, Addison notices the same motorcycle that the shooter was reportedly riding. Lorinner holds Addison at gunpoint, and reveals that the drug dealer that Kevin disrespected was in fact D Cash. As the police arrive (presumably called by Phoebe), Addison rushes a momentarily distracted Lorinner, but Lorinner shoots him in the shoulder and runs off. In the hospital, Addison recovers from his wound and reconciles with Phoebe, and Addison learns that Lorinner, D Cash, and Noel were all arrested by police. Later, Addison and Phoebe attend Kevin's funeral. Addison is accepted into the University of Chicago, but he will be away from Phoebe, who is attending Yale. In their final meeting before leaving for college, Phoebe hands Addison a letter, which is revealed to be a list of train times between Chicago and New Haven. Addison returns home, where he joins his dad in watching old videos of Mrs. Schacht. == Cast == * Ansel Elgort as Addison Schacht, Phoebe's friend and love interest and Theo's son * Chlo√´ Grace Moretz as Phoebe \\"Digger\\" Zeleny, Addison's friend and love interest and Fiona's daughter * David Strathairn as Theo Schacht, Addison's father * Catherine Keener as Fiona Zeleny, Phoebe's mother * Terry Kinney as Principal Karlstadt * Cory Hardrict as D Cash * Philip Ettinger as Mike Lorriner * Danny Flaherty as Noel * Victor Williams as Mr. Broadus, Kevin's father * Opal Alladin as Mrs. Broadus, Kevin's mother * Tessa Albertson as Alex Faustner * Adrian Mompoint as Bo * Jared Kemp as Kevin Broadus * Georgia Lyman as Nurse == Production == Casting In November 2014, it was reported Chlo√´ Grace Moretz and Catherine Keener had been cast in the film.

Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"The starry chemistry of leads Ansel Elgort and Chlo√´ Grace Moretz injects a modicum of energy into the coming-of-age drama, whose elements of romance, crime and smart-kid angst never coalesce.\\" Variety's Owen Gleiberman called it \\"a low-budget generic shrug of a movie, one that recycles clich√©s both ancient (testy drug dealers) and slightly less ancient (the hero films his life with a camcorder).\\" ==Notes== Vertical Entertainment theatrically distributed the film, though did not receive marquee credit. == References  External links == * Category:2017 crime drama films Category:2017 films Category:American crime drama films Category:American films Category:Films shot in Rhode Island Category:Films shot in Washington, D.C.

The program was a variety show which aired as a special presentation on June 25, 1951, on a five-city network hook-up of Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) television stations. Its airing was an initial step in CBS's brief and unsuccessful campaign to gain public acceptance of its field-sequential method of color broadcasting, which had recently been approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) as the first color television broadcasting standard for the United States. ==Competition for a U.S. color broadcasting standard== CBS's field-sequential color broadcasting system was an electro-mechanical system. It transmitted monochrome images electronically, and color was then added mechanically by placing a rapidly spinning (1440 r.p.m.) transparent tricolor disk in front of the television screen. This spinning Red-Green-Blue disk, when synchronized with a corresponding spinning disk in a color television camera, created the impression of full color. A major downside to the CBS system was that the video images being transmitted were not \\"compatible\\" with current black-and- white television sets, meaning that unless these sets were modified they would render these video transmissions as meaningless lines and squiggles (with the very rare exception of some sets which would produce four small black-and- white images, one in each corner of the screen.) During the past decade an often contentious competition had taken place to obtain official approval from the FCC for a U.S. color broadcasting method which would meet the FCC's criteria for cost, quality, and convenience. The primary challenger to CBS's system was an all-electronic color system employing a dot-sequential method which was being developed by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), the parent company of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). The RCA system had a distinct advantage in that it was compatible, meaning that current black- and-white televisions could receive a monochrome picture without any adjustments or modifications. However the color image produced on RCA's tricolor picture tubes had repeatedly been found unsatisfactory by the FCC. On October 11, 1950 the FCC gave its official approval of CBS's field-sequential color system and stated that commercial color broadcasting could begin as of November 20, 1950. Legal objections were immediately raised by RCA and others and the resulting court case worked its way through the courts up to the U.S. Supreme Court. On May 28, 1951 on an 8-1 vote the Supreme Court sided with the FCC, stating that commercial color programming could begin in twenty-five days. CBS announced that it would commence commercial broadcasting with Premiere on Monday, June 25, 1951. This would be the beginning of CBS's initial plan to broadcast twenty hours of color a week by autumn. RCA and others were still free to continue working on a competing compatible color system. ==Preparations for the color broadcast== CBS announced that it would colorcast Premiere live on a five-city network hook-up of East Coast CBS stations. New York City, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Boston made up the colorcast network. CBS planned to go forward even though few people would actually be able to view the event because there were very few color receivers available to the public. Due to nearly total manufacturer resistance there were currently no color sets being sold on the market. In response, CBS had recently acquired the television manufacturer Air King in order to manufacture a CBS-Columbia Model 12CC2 dual color/b&w; television set. On the day that Premiere aired CBS placed a full-page advertisement for the set on page nine of the New York Times, although orders for the $499.95 set would not actually be taken until late September. CBS lined up several of its best known stars to participate in its opening commercial colorcast, including Arthur Godfrey and Ed Sullivan. It signed up sixteen advertisers who spent close to an estimated $10,000 to sponsor the one-hour show. Seven advertisers reportedly spent $1000 each for a sixty-second announcement, and nine others spent $275 for a simple display of their products. Rehearsals began on Thursday, June 21 and continued up to the broadcast. Directing duties were split between CBS Executive Producer Fred Rickey, who directed the entertainment, and CBS Director Frances Buss, who handled the commercials. A great amount of effort was made to get the display of colors right, with lighting angles being adjusted and props being changed and moved around. For the woman performers \\"regular TV color makeup\\" was used, including a special pink lipstick. The faces of some of the participants kept proving problematic and Ed Sullivan was asked to wear a cap when golfing that week because of the unflattering contrast of his deeply tanned face with the paler faces of the others. The intense lighting needed for the color broadcast made conditions very hot, with temperatures in the studio rising to around 120 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius.) Fans had to be turned off because they were too noisy. During the rehearsals part of the studio floor buckled and food items meant for display melted and ran. The performers and crew were just as stressed. CBS Vice President Adrian Murphy quipped, \\"Now I know how it feels to be pregnant.\\" ==Synopsis of the June 25, 1951, broadcast== A five-minute test pattern led off the color broadcast at 4:30 p.m., EDT. Premiere began at 4:35 p.m., EDT. It was opened by \\"Patty Painter\\" (Patricia Stinnette) a professional model and West Virginia native who for many years had been employed by CBS to pose for on-camera tests of its color television system. By the time of this broadcast she had done more than one thousand color presentations and demonstrations, thus earning such nicknames as \\"Miss CBS Color\\" and \\"Miss Color Television.\\" During this program she would perform some of her usual video tasks, such as pouring the contents of a bottle of beer into a glass. She introduced Arthur Godfrey, the host of the first half-hour, who greeted the viewers with the self-deprecating quip about how \\"awful\\" it must be to see his face. During the first half-hour he would present several commercial products as well as strum on a guitar and sing \\"On Top of Old Smoky\\". Three individuals then made brief congratulatory remarks: William S. Paley, CBS Board Chairman; Frank Stanton, CBS President; and Wayne Coy, FCC Chairman. Chairman Coy addressed the timing of the FCC's decision, stating that the FCC \\"sincerely believed that color in television now is more important than a promise of color in the future. Such promises in the past have had a way of going unfulfilled.\\" Next to appear was Faye Emerson, dressed in a blue gown. During her appearance she presented several colorful paintings which had been provided by the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art and by the New York Museum of Modern Art. The paintings on display ranged from Picasso's Girl before a Mirror to a Hopper and a Renoir. She also did a presentation for sponsor Pepsi-Cola and bantered a bit with humorist Sam Levenson who stated how glad he was to be alive in these times. In the second half-hour Ed Sullivan showed up for hosting duties, announcing that \\"CBS is putting blood into the coaxial cable.\\" During his segment he promoted Mercury and Lincoln automobiles. Robert Alda and Isabel Bigley, current performers in the Broadway musical Guys and Dolls, sang a duet of \\"You're Just in Love\\" by Irving Berlin from the stage musical Call Me Madam. Ed Sullivan also joked around with the Bil and Cora Baird Marionettes, who serenaded him with E. Y. Harburg's \\"You, Too, Can Be a Puppet\\" from the musical Flahooley. Garry Moore was the next to appear, declaring \\"when Dr. Stanton sees me in color he'll say to himself, 'For this I went to the Supreme Court?'\\" During his appearance Moore showcased several commercial products, including Tenderleaf tea, Aunt Jemima, Duz powdered soap, Ivory soap and Chase and Sanborn coffee. He was also joined by Durward Kirby in a well-received comedy skit in which Moore played a pitchman who attempted to demonstrate a hopelessly useless vegetable slicer. The New York City Ballet company then staged a ballet performance of Maurice Ravel's La Valse, with staging by Sol Hurok and choreography by George Balanchine. The show wrapped up with some additional banter between Sullivan and the Baird Marionettes. Archie Bleyer and his orchestra had provided the music for the hour. Other commercial products promoted during the program included Wrigley's gum, Toni Home Permanent and Revlon lipstick. ==Five participating CBS cities== According to the CBS press release issued for the day the program aired, Premiere originated from CBS-TV's Studio 57 in New York City and was then transmitted from the studio by coaxial cable to CBS Master Control, which then sent it by telephone circuit to the local CBS transmitter for its New York City broadcast. The four other participating CBS affiliates received the show by coaxial cable. All five participating stations used their regular transmitters to send the broadcast signal out on the station's usual TV channel. Local newspaper television listings warned TV owners that they would be able to hear but not see the telecast. During the day of the broadcast CBS had a very limited number of color receivers on hand. Some of these were needed in-house to produce the show, so only approximately twenty receivers were made available through CBS to the various public and private viewing sites which had been set up for the event. In New York City and Washington, DC this small number was augmented by many homemade units which hobbyists and others had constructed earlier in order to view the experimental CBS color broadcasts which had been going on locally in those two cities. New York City, NY (WCBS-TV, Channel 2): Eight color receivers were placed by CBS in their studio at 49 East 52nd Street. Four hundred guests, including members of the press and advertising people, were invited to watch. Although CBS provided no sets for viewing by the general public that day, it estimated that there were 1000 homemade units available around the city. Washington, DC (WTOP-TV, Channel 9): There were four CBS color receivers in the city, none of which were made available to the general public that day. One color set was placed at the Carlton Hotel (two blocks from the White House) to provide private viewing for government officials and members of the press and such. The other three receivers were located at: WTOP-TV Studio One in the Warner Building; the office of John Hayes, WTOP-TV President; and the Channel 9 transmitter at 40th and Brandywine, NW. An estimated 125 homemade receivers had already been constructed by hobbyists and such to view the earlier experimental DC color broadcasts. Unfortunately, many of these hobbyists had always been able to take advantage of the fact that their receivers were using the same local source of electricity that was being used by the WTOP-TV cameras, so there was no need to include an adjustment mechanism that would detect the transmitted electric pulse designed to synchronize the spin of their unit's color disks with that of the color camera's. However the New York cameras were using a different source of electricity and the difference put the spin of many of the amateur DC color disks out of sync with New York. Baltimore, MD (WMAR-TV Channel 2): WMAR-TV had two CBS 10-inch color receivers set up for public viewing. One was located in the lobby of the Baltimore Sun's new Sunpapers' Building on and had an estimated crowd of 200. The other was placed in the lobby of the old Sunpapers' Building and had an estimated crowd of 400. (Both the Baltimore Sun and WMAR-TV were owned by the A. S. Abell Company.) The receiver in the old Sunpapers' Building suffered \\"mechanical difficulties.\\" Philadelphia, PA (WCAU-TV, Channel 10): Two receivers were supplied by CBS. One was set up for private viewing in WCAU-TV's auditorium. The other allowed for public viewing in the station's lobby. Five people called in to the station to report that they were one of the few who had black-and-white TVs which were picking up four small monochrome pictures, one in each corner of the screen. Boston, MA (WNAC-TV, Channel 7): CBS provided three color receivers. One went into the Princess Ballroom of the Hotel Somerset for private viewing by the members of the press and others. The two other sets were placed for public viewing on the fifth floor of the Jordan Marsh Company department store, one in the Exhibition Hall, and one in the Fashion Center. ==Reaction to the color broadcast== In spite of the challenges faced in the studio the show went off as planned and reactions to the broadcast were generally positive, but with some reservations. The colorful appearance of many of the objects displayed on the program proved to be quite eye-catching, with several write-ups stating that the color was better than movie color. Especially appealing were the brightly labeled commercial products being showcased. A number of reviews mentioned that color TV proved it could be a very compelling advertising medium. But a nearly universal observation was that the human performers did not fare nearly as well as the products. When the performers moved their heads, the coloring of their faces varied, even washing out. Other reports mentioned the sometimes curious look of peoples' hair and clothes. Improvements in lighting techniques would hopefully solve this problem. Several people who were interviewed expressed the desire to buy a color set, and this again pointed up the problem of the near-total absence of color receivers. Indeed, many reports mentioned that this had been a historic television event with very few witnesses. CBS estimated the total number of viewers from all sources to be 40,000. If most of the public wanted to watch CBS color broadcasts in any form over the next few months they would have to rely on their current black-and-white televisions and then install one of three devices which were just coming onto the market. If they just wanted to watch the color broadcast in black-and-white they would have to buy and install an external \\"adapter\\" which produced a monochrome, but smaller, picture (using only 405 lines of a standard set's 525). If they wished to watch a color broadcast in color they would have to buy and install a \\"converter\\", which paired the adapter with a spinning tricolor disk that slid in front of the screen (a magnifying lens was usually included.) However a converter was limited to television screens of up to around 12 inches (30 centimeters). So those who wanted to keep their existing large-screen black- and-white TVs would have to buy a \\"companion set\\" (also called a \\"slave- unit\\"), which was a separate unit containing an enclosed picture tube with color disk, and which came with a cord that plugged into the circuitry of the adjacent black-and-white TV. For many of the ten to twelve million owners of existing sets these options seemed too complicated or expensive, especially if compatible color ended up making the CBS color system redundant or even obsolete. And the FCC was allowing work to continue on compatible color. On the Friday before Premiere's airing, Allen B. DuMont, founder of DuMont Laboratories and the DuMont Television Network, contacted the FCC requesting that it postpone CBS's commercial color programming in light of recent improvements to RCA's compatible tricolor picture tube. His request was turned down, so while Premiere was airing Dr. DuMont invited members of the press to his Passaic, New Jersey laboratories to view a demonstration of color on this improved RCA tube. Closed-circuit color still images were displayed which to the viewing press seemed similar in quality to the CBS color broadcast which could be viewed in a separate room. NBC had already announced that starting July 9 it would begin authorized experimental broadcasts in New York City of RCA compatible color, with public demonstrations of the WNBT-TV broadcasts on RCA color receivers In addition, the National Television System Committee (NTSC), which had helped craft the original U.S. monochrome television broadcasting standards in 1941, had already reorganized in order to implement an all-industry plan which would pool together the knowledge and resources of the NTSC, RCA, General Electric and others to create a new \\"composite\\" compatible color system which it hoped would prove acceptable to the FCC. ==Aftermath and exit== After the Monday airing of Premiere many of the color receivers which CBS had used to exhibit the broadcast were moved to various public locations such as downtown department stores, part of CBS's strategy to give its color broadcasts as much public exposure as possible. That week saw the debuts of two half-hour Monday-to-Friday color series. On Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. The World is Yours started its run. On Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. Modern Homemakers began. In the following weeks CBS extended its color broadcasting into the Midwest and began adding more color programs, including a series of Saturday college football games. On September 28, 1951, a New York Times ad announced that orders would now be taken for the CBS-Columbia combination color/b&w; TV set which it had first advertised the day when Premiere aired three months earlier. Color viewership during these months had remained small and advertisers had mostly stayed away. Then on October 19, 1951 U.S. defense mobilizer Charles E. Wilson, head of the Office of Defense Mobilization (ODM), sent a letter to CBS president Frank Stanton requesting the suspension of the manufacture of color sets, stating that the increased requirements for the Korean emergency were more important than developing a new but nonessential product. CBS immediately complied and went further by ending all color broadcasting the next day after airing the North Carolina-Maryland college football game. This abrupt halt led Dr. DuMont and others to claim that CBS had found a face-saving way to exit from a doomed undertaking. NPA Order M-90, the regulation issued in 1951 by the National Production Authority (NPA) which had officially suspended color television set manufacturing, was rescinded in March 1953. However at that time CBS stated that it was no longer interested in continuing with its field-sequential color system. On December 17, 1953 the new \\"composite\\" dot-sequential color broadcasting method which had been developed through the Second NTSC was officially approved by the FCC as the replacement U.S. color television system standard. == References == Category:1951 in American television Category:CBS television specials ","title":"Premiere (TV program)"},{"id":"46298931","text":"Breakwater Chicago is a proposed vessel being designed as a part island, part yacht resort that includes sun-decks, restaurants, large swimming pool, and shops. It would be situated on Lake Michigan, floating about 1.1 miles off Chicago's shore line. It is proposed that the Breakwater Chicago vessel will be about the size of an American football field (approximately 300 feet x 100 feet). The concept for Breakwater Chicago was developed by a local entrepreneur named Beau D'Arcy. The architect of record for the design of the vessel is Chicago-based firm Space Architects + Planners. The entire project is estimated to cost about $23 million. Water taxis would take people to the resort, and people would also be able to dock boats at 30 slips. The vessel could hold 2,850 people at one time. The resort would be moored on the lake with an anchoring system, called \\"spuds,\\" that would rest on top of the lake- bed. The spuds could be pulled up in case of a weather emergency so the vessel could be moved to another location. The Breakwater Chicago project is currently in its design phase with construction planned for the summer of 2015. The project was publicly announced on June 9, 2014 alongside a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter, which raised more than $60,000 in donations from local supporters over one month. ==See also== *MV Protector used as a marina breakwater on Lake Washington ==References== Category:Boats Category:Resorts in the United States Category:Restaurants in Chicago Category:Nightclubs in Chicago Category:Lake Michigan ","title":"Breakwater Chicago"},{"id":"46298935","text":"Lajos Moln√°r (13 October 1946 ‚Äì 23 March 2015) was a Hungarian politician who was the Minister for Health from 2006 to 2007.Elhunyt a volt eg√©szs√©g√ºgyi miniszter ==References== Category:1946 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Government ministers of Hungary Category:Members of the National Assembly of Hungary (2006‚Äì2010) ","title":"Lajos Moln√°r"},{"id":"46298936","text":"Armen Margarian (Armenian ‘±÷Ä’¥’•’∂ ’Ñ’°÷Ä’£’°÷Ä’µ’°’∂) is an American entrepreneur, strategist and the CEO/co-founder/CEO at AppearMe, Inc. a Berkeley Skydeck accelerator company which provides litigation support to attorneys and law firms.

He served as the deputy director of the Political Work Department. He was a principal aide to Jiang Zemin, former General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (paramount leader). ==Career== Jia was born in Ye County, Henan province. He graduated in 1973 from the Chengdu Telecommunications Engineering College (), where he studied microwaves. In 1982 he joined the staff of Jiang Zemin, who was serving as Minister of Electrical Industry at the time. Later Jiang became Mayor of Shanghai, then Party Secretary. In 1989 after the Tiananmen Square protests, Jiang was promoted to General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and Jia joined him on his staff, serving in the Office of the General Secretary and Office of the Central Military Commission Chairman. In 1994 he became deputy head of the General Office serving the Central Military Commission (CMC). He was promoted to Major General in the same year. In 2003, he became head of the General Office of the CMC. In 2005, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general. In December 2007 Jia was named deputy director of the Political Work Department . In June 2011, he was promoted to general, the highest non-wartime rank in the PLA. On January 14, 2015, Mingjing News reported that Jia may have been taken in for investigation in a corruption case, but this could not be independently verified nor were there official announcements made. Duowei News reported that Jia, who had no military background, rose so high in the ranks of the People's Liberation Army solely due to his patronage relationship with Jiang Zemin. An opinion piece on the website said that Jia is a 'loyal foot soldier' of Jiang who was not promoted by merit. The Chinese journal Yanhuang Chunqiu implied that Jia might be linked to the disgraced vice admiral Wang Shouye, who was sentenced to life in prison during the term of Hu Jintao for corruption. Jia was an alternate member of the 17th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (he was ranked last, because out of the elected members he received the lowest number of confirmation votes), and a full member of the 18th Central Committee. ==See also== * Shanghai clique == References == Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:People's Liberation Army generals from Henan Category:People from Pingdingshan Category:Members of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Category:Alternate members of the 17th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China ","title":"Jia Ting'an"},{"id":"46298969","text":"Mar√≠a del Socorro Bustamante (17 February 1955 ‚Äì 20 March 2015) was a Colombian politician who was a Senator from 1994 to 2002.Falleci√≥ en Medell√≠n, Mar√≠a del Socorro Bustamante ==References== Category:1955 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Colombian politicians Category:Colombian women in politics ","title":"Mar√≠a del Socorro Bustamante"},{"id":"46298982","text":"{ style=\\"width:100%, align:top\\" Goodluck Jonathan Muma Gee Rita Dominic Clem Ohameze Miraboi } This is a list of notable alumni and faculty from the University of Port Harcourt. ==Alumni== Arts and entertainment *Andre Blaze - rapper, reality talent show host *Monalisa Chinda ‚Äì actress *Diminas Dagogo ‚Äì film director *Agbani Darego ‚Äì model *Rita Dominic ‚Äì actress *Linda Ejiofor ‚Äì actress, model *Tamara Eteimo - actress, singer *Muma Gee ‚Äì singer, actress *M Trill ‚Äì rapper *Bimbo Manuel ‚Äì actor *Clem Ohameze - actor Authors and journalists *Uchechukwu Peter Umezurike ‚Äì author Business and industry *Emmanuel Agwoje ‚Äì banker, Chief Executive Officer of Equator Capital Ltd. *Alex Otti ‚Äì former Group Managing Director of Diamond Bank *Prince Tonye Princewill ‚Äì Chairman of Riverdrill Group of Companies (Nigeria) *Solomon Awajigbana Obongo -- Chairman of Nigeoil (Nigeria) Management and marketing * Miraboi ‚Äî businessman and singer Diplomacy, government, law, and politics *Rotimi Amaechi ‚Äì Governor of Rivers State *Innocent Barikor ‚Äì Member of the Rivers State House of Assembly *Osinakachukwu Ideozu ‚Äì Estate Surveyor; Senator *Goodluck Jonathan ‚Äì President of Nigeria *Patience Jonathan ‚Äì First Lady of Nigeria *Olaka Nwogu ‚Äì Member of the House of Representatives *Silva Opuala-Charles ‚Äì Commissioner of Finance and Budget *Emmanuel Paulker ‚Äì Senator for the Bayelsa Central *Timipre Sylva ‚Äì Governor of Bayelsa State *Godknows Igali - Diplomat, Federal Permanent Secretary and Technocrat Science *Franklin Erepamo Osaisai ‚Äì nuclear engineer, energy scientist ==Faculty== Current and former *I.

It is approximately long and flows through Newton Township, Ransom Township, Scranton, and Taylor. The watershed of the creek has an area of . It is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. The creek has two named tributaries: Lucky Run and Lindy Creek. The watershed of Keyser Creek was historically affected by coal mining and has been channelized. It has no flow in dry conditions, although it does have some during and after storms. As of 1991, the watershed is mostly forested. The first white settlers in Lackawanna County settled near the creek in 1769. Keyser Creek is a major second-order tributary of the Lackawanna River. Since 2013, a trailhead of the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail has been situated near the creek. A number of bridges have also been built across the creek. ==Course== Satellite map of Keyser Creek Keyser Creek begins in a deep valley on West Mountain in Newton Township. It flows south-southeast for more than a mile, exiting Newton Township, passing through Ransom Township, and entering Scranton. The creek then turns southeast for about a mile, crossing Interstate 476. It then turns southwest for several tenths of a mile and receives Lindy Creek, its first named tributary, from the right. The creek then turns south- southwest for several tenths of a mile and receives Lucky Run, its last named tributary, from the right before turning southwest. After a few tenths of a mile, it turns south-southwest again and eventually turns southeast for a few tenths of a mile before turning south. Several tenths of a mile further downstream, it southeast and then south-southwest. After several tenths of a mile, it reaches its confluence with the Lackawanna River. Keyser Creek joins the Lackawanna River upriver of its mouth. Tributaries Keyser Creek has two named tributaries: Lucky Run and Lindy Creek. Lucky Run joins Keyser Creek upstream of its mouth. Its watershed has an area of . Lindy Creek joins Keyser Creek upstream of its mouth. Its watershed has an area of . ==Hydrology== Some reaches of Keyser Creek experience total flow loss and there is no regular flow in the watershed's lower reaches. There are also extensive piles of culm and silts piled up in the creek's floodplain, left over from the coal mining era. There is at least one sanitary sewer overflow in the watershed. As of 2013, there are an estimated four stormwater detention facilities in the watershed. The creek has no perennial flow, since it loses flow to mine pools during dry weather. For this reason, it is unlikely to attain its designated uses. However, it still has flow during storms. During storm flows, the creek carries large amounts of sediment containing coal waste. Additionally, there are some discharges of rusty water into the creek, in addition to a combined sewer overflow. The peak annual discharge of Keyser Creek at its mouth has a 10 percent chance of reaching per second. It has a 2 percent chance of reaching per second and a 1 percent chance of reaching 3100 cubic feet per second. The peak annual discharge has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching per second. The peak annual discharge of Keyser Creek upstream of Lucky Run has a 10 percent chance of reaching per second. It has a 2 percent chance of reaching per second and a 1 percent chance of reaching per second. The peak annual discharge has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching per second. The peak annual discharge of Keyser Creek upstream of Lindy Creek has a 10 percent chance of reaching per second. It has a 2 percent chance of reaching per second and a 1 percent chance of reaching per second. The peak annual discharge has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching per second. In the early 1900s, Keyser Creek was a clear stream until it reached the repair shops of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. At this point, it received some oil and refuse. At the Capouse Shaft, the creek washed an ash bank and a culm bank and was contaminated with some sulfur. More dirty waste materials drained into the creek at the Archbald Colliery and a fertilizer plant also discharged waste into it. ==Geography and geology== The elevation near the mouth of Keyser Creek is above sea level. The elevation near the creek's source is between above sea level. In its upper reaches, the creek has a gradient on the order of . However, in its lower reaches, once it flows off Bald Mountain and into Keyser Valley, its gradient is only on the order of . A waterfall known as Fawnwood Falls is in the watershed of Keyser Creek. The Moffat Breaker is in the creek's watershed, as are the ruins of other Moffat Colliery buildings and the remains of some water works. The watershed drains part of West Mountain or Bald Mountain. The creek's headwaters are in springs and wetlands on Bald Mountain/West Mountain. The creek passes through stone and concrete culverts when flowing under Main Avenue. Numerous stream segments have braided flows or channel loss. The creek flows through 21 pipes, whose diameters range from . Keyser Creek is topographically very similar to the nearby Saint Johns Creek. In its headwaters, its gradient is steep and it passes through several small cataracts. In its lower reaches, it is in a shallow floodplain. The creek begins in springs and wetlands on a mountain known as Bald Mountain, which has an elevation of above sea level. At some locations, Keyser Creek has experienced significant erosion, causing sediment and red ash (burned culm) to enter the creek. Keyser Creek has unstable banks due to abandoned mine impacts. Its banks are shallow and natural cobblestone banks in its lower reaches. However, the creek is channeled and has a steep bank further upstream. A delta fan made of eroded red ash sediment occurs at the mouth of Keyser Creek. The creek flows through rock formations such as the Llewellyn Formation and the Pocono Formation. conglomerate and limestone have been observed in the creek's vicinity. There are coal measures in the vicinity of the creek. There are pyroclastic materials in foundry slag and coal mining waste in the watershed. Large deposits of drift have been observed near the creek. Substantial till deposits are also present in its valley. There is a historic flume structure along Keyser Creek. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection carried out channelization work on of Keyser Creek and its tributary Lindy Creek in 1999 and 2000. Approximately of the creek is in a rectangular concrete channel. In 2001, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Project proposed a substantial stream channel restoration project on Keyser Creek. ==Watershed== The watershed of Keyser Creek has an area of . The watershed is in the western or southwestern section of the Lackawanna River watershed. It occupies parts of Taylor, Scranton, and Ransom Township, as well as a small area in Newton Township. The stream is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Scranton. Upstream of the tributary Lucky Run, its watershed has an area of . Upstream of the tributary Lindy Creek, it has an area of . As of 1991, nearly 80 percent of the watershed of Keyser Creek is forested land. Approximately 20 percent is residential land. There are also a few small areas of commercial and industrial land. Keyser Creek is an \\"important\\" second-order stream. It is one of the larger tributaries of the Lackawanna River. It is a second-order stream. Major roads in the watershed include Keyser Avenue, Luzerne Street, North South Road, Simplex Drive, Washburn Street, and Sherman Avenue. Keyser Creek is one source of flooding in the borough of Taylor. It is also the only recent flooding source in the borough. In 1971, the creek overflowed after a rainstorm, damaging several yards and lots near Oak Street and First Street. The flooding was caused by a faulty culvert, which was later replaced by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. ==History, etymology, and recreation== Keyser Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1198972. The first white settlers in Lackawanna County settled near Keyser Creek. Timothy Keys, Solomon Hocksey, and Andrew Hickman constructed homes at this location in 1769. The creek is named after Timothy Keys. The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission added a Pennsylvania State Historical Marker near the creek in 1948 to commemorate the settlers. Another early settler in the area was Cornelius Atherton, who arrived at a hill overlooking the creek in 1782. In maps from the 1700s, the creek is referred to as Beaver Run or Beaver Creek. Since the 19th century, Keyser Creek has been heavily impacted by coal mining and railroads. Three steel girder bridges that historically carried the Central New Jersey Railroad across Keyser Creek near its mouth. The bridges now carry the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail. The creek also flows under a stone arch culvert with a length of near the Canadian Pacific rail yard in Taylor. A steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge was constructed across the creek in 1996. It is long and carries Washburn Avenue. In the early 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan recommended that Ransom Township, Newton Township, and the city of Scranton include protection of Keyser Creek in their comprehensive plans, as well as their ordinances for land use, zoning, and subdivision. The creek is on the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation's priority list and the Lackawanna River Corridor Association's priority list for the Lackawanna River watershed. ==Biology== The entire drainage basin of Keyser Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. In the late 1800s, there was a laurel swamp along the creek. The area in the vicinity of Keyser Creek has experienced habitat loss due to abandoned mine impacts. What remains of the creek's riparian buffer in some reaches is overrun with invasive plants. The understory in the creek's riparian area is covered in knotweed. However, some reaches have riparian buffers containing red maple, silver maple, and river birch. ==Recreation== The Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Project suggested creating a trailhead for the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail at the mouth of Keyser Creek. The section of the trail running from Keyser Creek to Taylor is long and is known as the CNJ Extension. Groundbreaking began on May 14, 2012 and the trail opened in 2013. ==See also== *Spring Brook (Lackawanna River), next tributary of the Lackawanna River going downriver *Stafford Meadow Brook, next tributary of the Lackawanna River going upriver *List of rivers of Pennsylvania *List of tributaries of the Lackawanna River ==References *Google Street View image of Keyser Creek Category:Rivers of Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania Category:Tributaries of the Lackawanna River Category:Rivers of Pennsylvania ","title":"Keyser Creek"},{"id":"46299021","text":"The Adrian Fletcher Residence is a historic house at 6725 Washington (East Huntsville) Road in Fayetteville, Arkansas.

The NDUFA4L2 protein is a subunit of NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), which is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is the largest of the five complexes of the electron transport chain. ==Structure== The NDUFA4L2 gene is located on the long q arm of chromosome 12 at position 13.3 and it spans 5,860 base pairs. NDUFA4L2 is a subunit of the enzyme NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), the largest of the respiratory complexes. The structure is L-shaped with a long, hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a hydrophilic domain for the peripheral arm that includes all the known redox centers and the NADH binding site. It has been noted that the N-terminal hydrophobic domain has the potential to be folded into an alpha helix spanning the inner mitochondrial membrane with a C-terminal hydrophilic domain interacting with globular subunits of Complex I. The highly conserved two-domain structure suggests that this feature is critical for the protein function and that the hydrophobic domain acts as an anchor for the NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) complex at the inner mitochondrial membrane. ==Function== The human NDUFA4L2 gene codes for a subunit of Complex I of the respiratory chain, which transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone. Initially, NADH binds to Complex I and transfers two electrons to the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) prosthetic arm to form FMNH2. The electrons are transferred through a series of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters in the prosthetic arm and finally to coenzyme Q10 (CoQ), which is reduced to ubiquinol (CoQH2). The flow of electrons changes the redox state of the protein, resulting in a conformational change and pK shift of the ionizable side chain, which pumps four hydrogen ions out of the mitochondrial matrix. == References == Category:Proteins ","title":"NDUFA4L2"},{"id":"46299057","text":"Indium lung is a rare occupational lung disease caused by exposure to respirable indium in the form of indium tin oxide. It is classified as an interstitial lung disease (diffuse parenchymal lung disease). == Signs and symptoms == The major signs of indium lung are pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and pulmonary fibrosis. Symptoms include dyspnea (shortness of breath), cough, and increased sputum production. Hemoptysis has also been seen in people with indium lung. Other symptoms seen in some but not all cases include digital clubbing, low DLCO (capacity to move oxygen from the alveoli into the blood), and lowered forced expiratory volume. Emphysema has been associated with indium lung, but may not be part of the syndrome. Complications Lung cancer may be related to indium lung disease, though indium is not a known carcinogen. == Causes == Indium lung is caused by exposure to indium tin oxide in a variety of occupational contexts, including reclamation and production. Exposure to indium tin oxide as it reacts can lead to exposure to indium metal, indium hydroxide, and indium oxide. ==Mechanism== The exact mechanism of pathogenesis is unknown, but it is hypothesized that indium may exacerbate existing autoimmune disorders or that phagocytosis of indium by alveolar macrophages may cause dysfunction in the macrophages. == Diagnosis == CT scanning and radiography can be used to aid in the diagnosis of indium lung. CT abnormalities include ground-glass opacities, interlobular septal thickening, honeycombing, and bronchiectasis.  Laboratory findings  Multiple abnormal laboratory findings have been noted in indium lung. High levels of serum indium have been found in all cases of indium lung. Other abnormal laboratory values that have been found include elevated alanine aminotransferase, elevated aspartate aminotransferase, elevated C-reactive protein, elevated interstitial lung disease markers, and elevated GM-CSF autoantibodies. ==Prevention== The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, Japan (JNIOSH) set limits for acceptable exposure at 0.0003 mg/m3 after the discovery of indium lung. Methods for reducing indium exposure are thought to be the best mode of protection. Medical surveillance of indium workers is also a method of prevention. == Treatment == There is no standardized treatment for indium lung disease. Treatment options include pulmonary lavage and corticosteroid therapy. ==Prognosis== Prognostic factors were a matter of research as of 2012, but preliminary evidence suggests that duration of employment and reported use of respiratory protection are not prognostic factors, but the serum level of indium may be a prognostic factor - higher levels of serum indium have been associated with worse prognoses. Indium lung disease has been fatal in several cases. ==History== It was first described by a group of Japanese researchers in 2003. == Epidemiology == Cases have been reported in Japan, the United States, and China. The indium industry is mainly based in Japan, where the bulk of cases have occurred; indium industry is also present in the US, China, Taiwan, and South Korea. As of 2010, 10 cases had been described, though more than 100 indium workers had documented respiratory abnormalities. ==References Further reading == * Category:Lung diseases due to external agents Category:Occupational diseases Category:Lung disorders Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Indium lung"},{"id":"46299085","text":"Annasif D√∏hlen (born 23 June 1930) is a Norwegian sculptor.

He was a younger son of the dynasty's founder, Muhammad ibn Tughj al-Ikhshid, and reigned from the death of his elder brother Unujur in 961. Actual power throughout his reign was held by the capable black eunuch Abu'l-Misk Kafur. The main events of his reign were a Nubian invasion in 963, as well as a resurgence of Bedouin unrest and raids both in the Western Desert and in the Syrian Desert, in the latter case accompanied by the reappearance of the Qarmatians. Anti-Christian riots were provoked by a defeat of the Ikhshidid fleet against the Byzantine navy in 960/963, as well as the Byzantine offensives under Nikephoros Phokas in Cilicia and northern Syria. After Ali's death in January 966, Kafur sidelined Ali's underage son Ahmad and became ruler in his own right. Kafur ruled until his death in 968, when Ahmad succeeded him. The Ikhshidid state was weakened by internal turmoil and a succession of bad harvests, however, leading to its fall to the Fatimids in 969. ==ReferencesSources== * * Category:10th-century births Category:966 deaths Category:10th-century monarchs in Asia Category:10th-century rulers in Africa Category:Ikhshidid emirs Category:Ikhshidids ","title":"Abu'l-Hasan Ali ibn al-Ikhshid"},{"id":"46299244","text":"Christopher Cerrone (born March 5, 1984) is an American composer based in New York City.

Its present title is a translation of the one given by Jean de la Fontaine after he retold it in his fables. Since then it has been treated frequently by artists. It has also acquired idiomatic force and as such has been used as the title of several literary works. ==The fable and its interpretation== A lion falls in love with a peasant's daughter and asks the father's permission to marry her. Unwilling to refuse outright, the man sets the condition that the animal should first have its claws clipped and its teeth filed. When the lion complies, the man clubs it to death, or in milder accounts simply drives it away, since it now can no longer defend itself. Though the story was included in early collections of Aesop's fables, including those of Babrius and Aphthonius of Antioch, its earliest relation is as part of a war leader's speech in the 1st century BCE Bibliotheca historica of Diodorus Siculus, where it is described without ascription as an \\"old story\\".G. J. Van Dijk, Ainoi, Logoi, Mythoi, Brill 1997 p.280-3 Significantly, the fable is interpreted there as a warning against ever letting down one's guard where an enemy is concerned and Aphthonius too comments that \\"If you follow the advice of your enemies, you will run into danger\\". By the time the fable reappeared in Europe after the Renaissance it was being reinterpreted as a caution against being led astray by passion. The Neo-Latin poem Leo procus of Hieronymus Osius ends with the reflection \\"By love the cleverest , sometimes, / are led astray, the strongest tamed\\".Phryx Aesopus, fable 216 A century later, Francis Barlow's illustration of what he titles Leo Amatorius is summed up in the couplet \\"Love asailes with powerfull charmes, / and both our Prudence and our strength disarmes\\". La Fontaine titled his poem Le lion amoureux and ended with the sentiment \\"O love, O love, mastered by you, / prudence we well may bid adieu\\" (IV.1). One of the factors influencing this interpretation was the development of the Renaissance emblem associated with the Latin sentiment Amor vincit omnia (Love conquers all). In a medal struck in 1444, Pisanello pictures a lion fawning on winged Cupid. This was reprised in the Emblemata amatoria (1607/8) of Dani√´l Heinsius as a Cupid astride a rampant lion, accompanied in one edition by a poem in French in which Love boasts that \\"the lion is conquered by my taming arrow\\".Wikimedia The interpretation is that even the fiercest nature can be tamed by love, but the reference to a lion inevitably brings to mind the well known instance of his fatal subjection to love in the fable. In illustrations during the following centuries, the lion fawns on his lady love in the same attitude as in Pisanello's medal, as for instance on the plate from the La Fontaine series of Keller & Guerin at the Luneville potteries. ==The fable in the arts== Illustrations of the fable were rare before the 19th century. In the 18th, it was the subject of an Aubusson tapestry to a design of Jean-Baptiste Oudry,Wikimedia and in England it was painted during the 1790s by James Northcote. Camille Roqueplan's dark interpretation of the fable in the Wallace Collection It was not until the 19th century that artists confronted the questionable morality of the human actors in the fable and treated the woman as more than a passive bystander. The change in attitude is evident in Camille Roqueplan's painting of 1836 which makes the lion's love-object the one who clips its claws (see left), a detail absent from the text. Its iconography is reminiscent of the story of Delilah's betrayal of Samson and especially those paintings in which Samson's head rests on her lap while she crops his hair and attackers lurk in the background. Another treatment of the theme is the 1851 statue by Guillaume Geefs in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, although in this case the lady is sitting on the lion's back as she works with her scissors.World Visit Guide The subject also lends itself to satirical interpretation and was chosen for this purpose by the Japanese caricaturist Kawanabe Ky≈çsai for his Isoho Monogotari series (1870‚Äì80). More recently Diane Victor has used it in her lithograph \\"The lion who loved the lady\\" (2011) to comment on the relationship between China and Africa. In other depictions too, as in paintings by Gustave Moreau, Adolphe Weisz (1838 ‚Äì after 1900)Mutual Art and Henri Courcelles-Dumont (1856‚Äì1918), the woman flaunts her naked body in a show of power over the beast. In 2011 this theme was notoriously adapted to a scent advert by Bulgari.Promotional video on YouTube There were other sculptural treatments of the fable, including the statue by Hippolyte Maindron in the Parc de Blossac, Poitiers, erected in 1883, although the original plaster model was shown at the 1869 Salon.Detailed photos are at Vdujardin Smaller replicas of Geefs' statue were made for sale after it appeared at The Great Exhibition and the Exposition Universelle (1855),An example is in the Royal Collection and in 1885 Mintons issued a similar Parian ware figure of its own. Spode had already used an illustration of the fable on its Aesop series of table china, dating from 1830, and from 1900 the Zanesville Tile Company reproduced the Walter Crane illustration from Baby's Own Aesop (1887) on its product. In the world of music, the fable was twice made the subject of a ballet under its French title. Karol Rathaus' version (Op.42b) was first performed by the Ballet Russe in 1937 and in 1942 Francis Poulenc made it an episode in his ballet suite Les Animaux mod√®les (Op.111).The music from the orchestral suite is on You Tube It is also one of the 'short operas' in Ned Rorem's Fables (1971). ==Idioms== The title of the fable, both in English and French, was eventually to have an almost idiomatic force in reference to the pacification by love of the dominant male nature. As such it was given to two paintings which showed a soldier helping a young woman with her needlework. Abraham Solomon's, exhibited at the Royal Academy summer exhibition of 1858, depicted a grey-haired warrior in uniform trying to thread the needle of a lady seated beside him on a sofa, while the one by Emile Pierre Metzmacher (1815‚Äì1905), exhibited at the Exposition Universelle (1889), was a period piece in which a younger soldier tries his hand at tapestry.Pixel-pinxit In literature the title was used for depiction of the emotional relationships of social lions. The novella by Fr√©d√©ric Souli√© (1839) is a comedy of manners that depicts the unequal love of a well-born dandy and its tragic outcome.Walter Scott et la roman fr√©n√©tique, Paris 1928, pp.237-8 Eug√®ne Scribe's contemporary light-hearted comedy of 1840 is set in England, where a lord falls in love with his servant and, after attempting seduction and force, agrees to marry her.Revue de Paris vol.24, pp.206-7 The verse drama by Fran√ßois Ponsard, first staged in 1866, was set in 1796, in the period following the Reign of Terror in France. A hero of the armies of the Revolution falls in love with a Royalist aristocrat whose father is plotting against the Republic and there is a struggle between duty and love on both sides. Its subtle dynamics encompass far more than 'trimming the hero's claws and filing his teeth', as a contemporary reviewer noted.Review by Saint-Ren√© Taillandier in the Revue des Deux Mondes, 1866, vol.61 pp.791-803 Later examples of the title's use in English include the play by Shelagh Delaney (1960), about the marriage between a frustrated man and an aggressive woman, and a romance by Elizabeth Lapthorne (2004). The method for pacifying the lion also gave rise in the 19th century to the allied English idioms of 'to draw someone's teeth'E. Cobham Brewer 1810‚Äì1897. Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, 1898, His teeth are drawn and 'to cut, clip or pare someone's claws'. Their association with the fable is demonstrated by both being used together in a news report of 1831.London & Paris Observer, #575, 24 April, 1836 Both have the meaning of rendering someone harmless. ==References * Illustrations from books from the 17th - 19th centuries * Gustave Dor√© prints Category:Aesop's Fables Category:La Fontaine's Fables Category:Fictional lions ","title":"The Lion in Love (fable)"},{"id":"46299338","text":"Argemiro Boh√≥rquez (born 28 January 1960) is a Colombian former professional racing cyclist.

The Lobsters rebounded somewhat from their dismal 2014 season with 5 wins and 9 losses and narrowly missed qualifying for the WTT playoffs. The Lobsters were eliminated on the final day of the regular season when they lost to the Washington Kastles, 22‚Äì14. On February 17, 2016, WTT announced that it had been unable to find a new owner for the Lobsters, and the franchise had folded. ==Season recap== Takeover of team by WTT In early 2015, WTT took over operations of the Lobsters from former owner Bahar Uttam who retired from the sports business and walked away from the team. WTT began seeking a new local owner or ownership group for the Lobsters. By the end of the 2015 season, WTT commissioner Ilana Kloss said the league had had conversations with several interested buyers in New England. WTT's asking price for the Lobsters was US$1 million. Kloss said, \\"I think that‚Äôs probably the price we believe a team should be valued at.\\" Trade of Isner and draft Prior to the WTT Draft on March 16, 2015, the Lobsters traded the top-ranked American player John Isner to the Springfield Lasers for undisclosed consideration which was presumably financial, since no other players or draft choices were moved in connection with the deal. The Lobsters used the first overall pick in the marquee portion of the draft to select Eugenie Bouchard. In the roster portion of the draft, the Lobsters didn't protect any players from their 2014 roster. They selected Irina Falconi, Scott Lipsky, Chase Buchanan and Arantxa Parra Santonja. Lipsky played with the team in 2014, as a substitute player but only appeared in two matches and could not be protected by the Lobsters in the draft. Other player transactions On July 9, 2015, the Lobsters announced that they had signed Alex Kuznetsov as a substitute player to replace Chase Buchanan who was injured and expected to miss the first six matches of the season. On July 20, 2015, the Lobsters signed Tim Smyczek as a substitute player. On July 21, 2015, the Lobsters signed Maria Sanchez as a substitute player. On July 25, 2015, the Lobsters signed Jason Jung as a substitute player. On July 28, 2015, the Lobsters signed Christian Harrison as a substitute player. A strong first half After losing their first two matches of the season, both at home, the Lobsters turned things around by winning the next three straight and four of the next five to give themselves 4 wins and 3 losses at the midway point. Three of those four wins came on the road. The Lobsters' first win of the season came on July 14, when they visited the Springfield Lasers. The Lobsters won the first four sets. Alex Kuznetsov got things started by taking the men's singles and later teamed with Scott Lipsky to win a tiebreaker in the men's doubles set. Irina Falconi won a tiebreaker in the women's singles set and them paired with Arantxa Parra Santonja for a 5‚Äì0 set win in women's doubles that gave the Lobsters a 20‚Äì11 lead heading to the final set. In the mixed doubles set, Lipsky and Parra lost a tiebreaker that sent the match to extended play with the Lobsters leading 24‚Äì16. After getting broken in the opening game of extended play, Lipsky and Parra held serve in the third game to give the Lobsters a 25‚Äì18 victory. The following evening, the Lobsters returned home to play the San Diego Aviators and put on their most dominating performance of the season. They won all five sets and cruised to a 25‚Äì13 victory. Kuznetsov opened the match with a 5‚Äì2 set win in men's singles and later joined Lipsky to take a tiebreaker in men's doubles. Falconi wn the women's singles, 5‚Äì3, and teamed with Parra for a 5‚Äì2 set win in women's doubles. Parra and Lipsky closed out the match with a 5‚Äì2 mixed doubles set win. The Lobsters' third straight win came on the road against the Philadelphia Freedoms on July 16. Trailing 12‚Äì11 after three sets, Falconi won the women's singles set, 5‚Äì2, to put the Lobsters in front 16‚Äì14. Lipsky and Kuznetsov closed out the match with a 5‚Äì3 set win in men's doubles that gave the Lobsters a 21‚Äì17 victory. Coming off a season in which they won only one of 14 matches, the Lobsters now found themselves with 3 wins and 2 losses and in first place in the Eastern Conference. The Lobsters took their three-match winning streak on a West Coast trip. Leading 16‚Äì15 after four sets, the Lobsters could not hold on against the California Dream and fell, 20‚Äì17. Their scheduled match with the Aviators the following day was rained out, and the match was made up with a 10:00 a.m. PDT start time on July 20, because the Aviators already had a match scheduled for that evening. With Kuznetsov's contract having expired and the Lobsters unable to find a substitute, coach Jan-Michael Gambill stepped in to play in the morning tilt. He paired with Lipsky to win a tiebreaker in the opening set of men's doubles. After Falconi lost the women's singles set, Gambill fell to amateur Taylor Fritz in men's singles, 5‚Äì2, to give the Aviators a 14‚Äì10 lead after three sets. But the final two sets belonged to the Lobsters. Parra teamed with Falconi to win the women's doubles, 5‚Äì2, and then with Lipsky to win the mixed doubles, 5‚Äì3, and give the Lobsters a 20‚Äì19 victory. Bouchard injured and second half struggles The Lobsters continued their road trip when they visited the four-time defending WTT champion Washington Kastles on July 21. With both teams sporting records of 4 wins and 3 losses, this match was a battle for first place in the Eastern Conference. Earlier in the day, the Lobsters had learned that their top draft choice Eugenie Bouchard would miss the entire season with an injury. The news did not get any better. The Kastles dominated the match, winning all five sets. The loss for the Lobsters was the first of five consecutive setbacks. Montoya coaches a match With Lobsters coach Jan-Michael Gambill playing in his second match of the season on July 27, the team announced that Francisco Montoya, director of the Manchester Athletic Club Tennis Academy, would coach the team for that match. Entering the match with a four-match losing streak, the Lobsters were still in a position to make the playoffs on the strength of their solid play early in the season. In a crucial match against the Philadelphia Freedoms, the Lobsters erased a 12‚Äì10 deficit by winning the fourth set of women's doubles, 5‚Äì3, and tying the match at 15. However, the Freedoms took the final set of mixed doubles and dropped the Lobsters' record to 4 wins and 8 losses. Final playoff push Despite a five-match losing streak, the Lobsters still had control of their own playoff destiny. Wins in their final two matches, both on the road, against the Philadelphia Freedoms and the Washington Kastles would earn them a playoff berth. After dropping the opening set of men's singles, 5‚Äì0, against the Freedoms, the Lobsters roared back to win the next three sets to take a 15‚Äì12 lead. Irina Falconi and Arantxa Parra Santonja started the comeback with a 5‚Äì2 set win in women's doubles. Christian Harrison and Scott Lipsky followed by winning a tiebreaker in men's doubles. Falconi put the Lobsters in front with a 5‚Äì1 women's singles set win. Parra and Lipsky dropped the final set of mixed doubles, 5‚Äì3, to send the match to extended play with the Lobsters leading, 18‚Äì17. In the first game of extended play, Parra and Lipsky jumped in front, 1‚Äì3, with Marcelo Melo serving for the Freedoms. Melo and Taylor Townsend were able to turn back the first two break points. But Parra and Lipsky broke at 3 all to seal a 19‚Äì17 victory for the Lobsters that kept their playoff hopes alive. The Lobsters' playoff fate was decided in their final match of the season against the Kastles. Washington won the first two sets to take a 10‚Äì4 lead. The Lobsters battled back with a 5‚Äì3 mixed doubles set win by Lipsky and Parra over the reigning Wimbledon mixed doubles champions Leander Paes and Martina Hingis. Parra and Falconi followed by taking the women's doubles set in a tiebreaker to cut the Kastles' lead to 17‚Äì14. But Sam Querrey dominated Harrison in the final set of men's singles, 5‚Äì0, to seal the match for the Kastles and seal the Lobsters' fate. Since the Freedoms and Lobsters finished the regular season with identical 5‚Äì9 records, the WTT standings tiebreaker system was used to break the tie. The teams split their four regular-season meetings. So, the tie was broken by comparing games won in head-to-head matches, which favored the Freedoms, 78‚Äì71. The biggest contribution to this margin was made by the Freedoms' 24‚Äì14 road victory over the Lobsters on July 22. Franchise folded On February 17, 2016, WTT announced that it had been unable to find a new owner for the Lobsters, and the franchise had folded. In a press release, WTT commissioner Ilana Kloss said, \\"We spent more than a year seeking a local owner or ownership group, but unfortunately we were not able to find the right fit.\\" She went on to say that WTT was leaving the door open for a return to Boston if the right ownership could be found. Keith Callahan, general manager of the Manchester Athletic Club said that the club had been approached by WTT to take over ownership of the team but had turned it down. \\"We just made a decision not to do that,\\" he said. \\"It would have taken an enormous amount of resources to take on an operation like that, and we made a decision to commit those resources to improving the business and to making improvements for our members to make the operation better for them and for the community.\\" ==Event chronology== * March 16, 2015: The Lobsters traded John Isner to the Springfield Lasers for undisclosed consideration. * March 16, 2015: The Lobsters selected Eugenie Bouchard, Irina Falconi, Scott Lipsky, Chase Buchanan and Arantxa Parra Santonja at the WTT draft. * July 9, 2015: The Lobsters signed Alex Kuznetsov as a substitute player. * July 20, 2015: The Lobsters signed Tim Smyczek as a substitute player. * July 21, 2015: The Lobsters signed Maria Sanchez as a substitute player. * July 25, 2015: The Lobsters signed Jason Jung as a substitute player. * July 28, 2015: The Lobsters signed Christian Harrison as a substitute player. * July 29, 2015: With a record of 5 wins and 9 losses, the Lobsters were eliminated from playoff contention when they lost to the Washington Kastles, 22‚Äì14. * February 17, 2016: WTT announced that the Lobsters franchise had folded. ==Draft picks== Since the Lobsters had the worst record in WTT in 2014, they had the first choice in each round of the draft. Unlike previous seasons in which WTT conducted its Marquee Player Draft and its Roster Player Draft on different dates about one month apart, the league conducted a single draft at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden in Indian Wells, California on March 16, 2015.

Malmgren was a student in Helsinki in 1854, Master primus 1860, PhD 1864, Acting Commissioner of the fisheries in 1865, extraordinary professor of zoology at the University of Helsinki in 1869, Fishery Commissioner in 1877 and governor of the province of Oulu in 1889. Malmgren undertook several scientific expeditions, especially in the northern latitudes, to the White Sea (1856) and to Spitsbergen and Finnmark as a participant in the first three Swedish expeditions (1861, 1864 and 1868). His most important scientific work involving the boreal region's fauna and flora; These include Kritisk √∂fversigt af Finlands fiskfauna (1863), Anteckningar om Spetsbergens f√•gelfauna (1863‚Äì64), Iakttagelser och anteckningar till Finnmarkens och Spetsbergens d√§ggdjursfauna (1865) and Bidrag till Finnmarkens fiskfauna (1867). His most important works - the fruit of his Nordic research trips - is his work on Nordiska hafsannulaterna (1865) and Om Spetsbergens, Gr√∂nlands, Islands och Skandinaviska half√∂ns hittills k√§nda Annulata polychaeta (1867). As fishery commissioner Malmgren undertook many significant operations. The years 1869-70 he published \\"Handlingar och f√∂rordningar ang√•ende Finlands fiskerier\\" (\\"Collection of Documents and regulations concerning Finnish fisheries\\") as five booklets, and later, a sixth, and in 1869 he began to publish \\"Tidskrift f√∂r fiskerin√§ring och agrikultur\\" (\\"Journal of the fishing industry and agriculture\\"), but soon ceased due to lack of interest. Moreover, he worked eagerly for the enhancement of fisheries and fish, especially for Salmonidae, protection and stocking of valuable fish types in Finnish waters and for basic fishery associations. He was hired by the government often for special committees (including the school committee in 1879).

It charted at number 7 on the UK Singles Chart. ==Background== The Changingman was co-written by Brendan Lynch, and performed, written and produced by Paul Weller, who sings and plays guitar, piano and shakers on the record. Carleen Anderson provides back-up vocals, as does Steve Cradock and Dr. Robert, who also play the guitar and bass guitar respectively. In addition, Steve White plays drums and Lynch played the Cyremin. . Weller claimed that the song's title came from the name his daughter Leah gave to one of her dolls, although at the time his friend Terry Rawlings managed a band called that. The song expresses Weller's mantra of breaking things up if they are getting too comfortable; the previous year, he had divorced his wife, Dee C. Lee, breaking up what appeared to the public to be a happy marriage. In an interview with Mojo in 2010, he expressed that this was because there were senses \\"that things were going too well, we were too happy, too comfortable, everything seemed too nice [and] that for me as a writer and an artist I might lose my edge. I had to break the shape up, re- arrange things\\", noting that said turmoil supplanted the lyrics of the entire parent album and stated that the lyric 'numbed by the effect, aware of the muse, too in touch with myself, I light the fuse' \\"was about the process of causing chaos around you\\". ==Music video== A music video was produced for the song. It alternates between clips of Weller singing and playing guitar, shots of model Anjela Lauren Smith dancing, and assorted symbols. ==Chart performance== The song peaked at number 7 on the UK Singles Chart, spending four weeks on the chart and becoming his first solo top ten hit. ==References== Category:1995 singles Category:1995 songs Category:Songs written by Paul Weller ","title":"The Changingman"},{"id":"46299507","text":"The Springfield Fire Department provides fire protection and emergency medical services to the city of Springfield, Massachusetts. The department is one of the oldest established fire departments in the United States. ==History== In the 1670s, Springfield was burned to the ground during the King Philip's War. As a result, the settlers started to focus on the need for fire protection. Technology of the time limited this protection to a simple bucket brigade. On January 17, 1794 citizens formed a volunteer fire club that agreed to \\"preserve the lives and property of each other from destruction by fire\\". This was the start of what would become the Springfield Fire department and makes it one of the oldest established fire departments in the country. This volunteer department was supplemented by aid from the Springfield Armory until the late 1800s. In 1852 the town was incorporated into a city and this called for a new fire organization. Years later in 1872, the department transitioned to an all paid department. This transition brought about the establishment of a central telegraph alarm system and the creation of a gravity-fed, reservoir water system which is still in use. In 1913, the Department became one of the first municipal department in the country to be completely motorized, using Knox fire engines manufactured in Springfield. ==Stations and apparatus== The Springfield Fire Department operates out of 8 fire stations. { class= - valign=bottom !

A British and French co-production, the film was released theatrically, except for the United States where it debuted on television. ==Plot== Soon after the death of his father, Prince Taj of Sakkar is persuaded to compete for the hand of Princess Yasmine of Baghdad. He is ambushed by agents of his own Wazir, Jaudur. His royal seal is stolen and an innocent man is murdered in his place. Arriving in Baghdad, dressed in rags and hungry, he befriends Hassan, magician and thief. Stealing suitable robes, Taj and Hassan present themselves to the Caliph, where Taj makes an immediate impression on Yasmine. Wazir Jaudur arrives on a flying carpet to join the suitors. Jaudur, bearing Taj's royal seal, claims to be king following the alleged murder of Prince Taj; he accuses Taj of being an impostor. Taj challenges Jaudur to a duel, but he loses. Jaudur is protected from injury because his soul is hidden at a secret location, making him immortal. The Caliph, wanting to believe Taj but bound by custom, is forced to accept Jaudur's claim. Perizidah reminds him of a prophecy given at Yasmine's birth that her wedding would bring great wealth. Using this as an excuse to stall for time, the Caliph sends all the suitors on a quest \\"to find that object in all the world that has the most value\\", and return in three moons. Hassan, convinced of Taj's sincerity because of Jaudur's repeated murder attempts, joins him on the quest. Perizidah, acting on Yasmine's behalf (and attracted to Hassan) guides them to a place where they can overhear Jaudur force information from traveling holy man Abu Bakare. They learn of the existence of an all-seeing eye that will help Taj defeat Jaudur. They steal Jaudur's flying carpet, but when Taj commands, \\"Take me to where my heart would go,\\" the carpet doesn't leave Yasmine's side. Hassan commands, \\"Carpet, take us where I would go.\\" The carpet takes them to the temple of the all- seeing eye. At the temple, the gatekeeper warns that Taj must not allow anything to lure him from the path or he will be turned to stone. Taj sustains insults about his parentage, and resists rescuing a man being devoured by a serpent. He nearly succumbs to a fire trap, but sees a statue of someone who failed before. Within sight of the temple, Taj is lured away by an image of Yasmine and is turned to stone. Hassan reluctantly follows Taj with the gatekeeper's blessing: \\"May your knowledge of deception lead you straight as an arrow to the truth.\\" Hassan resists the insulting chants with more humour than Taj, and his fear prevents him from intervening with the serpent illusion. He is nearly turned aside by chests of treasure, but the sight of the statue of Taj refocuses him. At the temple, he finds the eye is out of reach. The inscription at his feet, \\"The truth lies within thy reach,\\" causes him to realize that the eye only appears out of reach and is actually in his grasp. Taj is restored. He uses the eye to learn Yasmine's desire. They attempt to return to Baghdad by flying carpet, but are attacked by Jaudur's men on flying horses. The carpet is slashed to pieces. Taj and Hassan fall in different directions. Jaudur returns with the eye to Baghdad. Other suitors return with other fabulous gifts, but Jaudur exposes the other gifts as fakes. When presented with the eye, Yasmine uses it to locate Taj and learns that he is lost in the desert. Taj discovers a bottle in the sand. Opening it releases a giant genie who tries to kill him. Taj tricks the genie back into the bottle. The genie offers Taj three wishes if released. Taj asks to be reunited with Hassan, who is resting in an oasis with beautiful harem girls. Next he asks the genie to take them to the place where the soul of Jaudur lies. It is in an egg in a bird's nest on the side of a mountain. After Taj collects the soul, the genie takes them back to Baghdad. Jaudur has hypnotized Yasmine and the Caliph into agreeing to the wedding, but Taj arrives in time to prevent it. ==Cast== * Roddy McDowall ... Hassan * Kabir Bedi ... Prince Taj * Frank Finlay ...

It was the 20th running of the Dubai World Cup. It was the first running of the race since the synthetic Tapeta surface was replaced by a dirt track. The winner was Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum's Prince Bishop, an eight-year-old bay gelding trained in Dubai by Saeed bin Suroor and ridden by William Buick. Prince Bishop's victory was the first in the race for his jockey, the seventh for his trainer and the first for his owner. ==The contenders== The return to dirt saw a strong North American challenge, headed by the American Horse of the Year California Chrome, winner of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. The other runners from the United States were Lea, the six-year-old winner of the 2014 Donn Handicap and the four-year-old Candy Boy (Robert B. Lewis Stakes), who had recently been transferred to race for a UAE-based stable. The two-horse Saeed bin Suroor/ Godolphin entry comprised African Story (winner of the race in 2014) and Prince Bishop, who was contesting the race for the fourth time, having finished tenth in 2011, seventh in 2013 and ninth in 2014. Japan sent two representatives; Hokku Tarumae, a dirt specialist who had won the Champions Cup and been named Champion Dirt Horse at the JRA Awards, and the Japan Cup winner Epiphaneia, rated the second-best racehorse in the world in the 2014 World's Best Racehorse Rankings. The sole European runner was the much-travelled British eight-year-old Side Glance (whose biggest win had come in the 2013 Mackinnon Stakes) and the nine-runner field was completed by the locally trained American import Long River. Betting is illegal in Dubai, but British bookmakers made California Chrome the 5/4 favourite ahead of Lea (4/1) and Epiphaneia (13/2). African Story and Hokku Tarumae were next in the market on 8/1 ahead of the 14/1 shot Prince Bishop. ==The race== Hokko Tarumae broke quickly and set the pace in the early stages from African Story, California Chrome (racing four wide) and Long River with Prince Bishop detached from the rest of the field in last place. The Japanese horse maintained his advantage on the back straight and approached the final turn with the lead from California Chrome, African Story and Lea as Prince Bishop made rapid progress on the outside. By this point Long River, Side Glance and Epiphaneia were beaten, whilst Candy Boy was staying on but well behind the leading five. Entering the straight, California Chrome moved up to challenge Hokko Tarumae, but both horses were overtaken by Prince Bishop who quickly went into a clear lead. In the final stages Hokko Tarumae and African Story faded whilst Lea and Candy Boy made steady progress. Prince Bishop extended his advantage to win by two and three quarter lengths from California Chrome, with Lea one and quarter lengths back in third. There was a five length gap back to Candy Boy, who took fourth by a short head from Hokko Tarumae, with another four lengths back to African Story. Long River, Side Glance and Epiphaneia finished seventh, eighth and ninth at long intervals. ==Race details== * Sponsor: Emirates Airline * Purse: ¬£6,410,256; First prize: ¬£3,846,153. * Surface: Dirt * Going: Fast * Distance: 10 furlongs * Number of runners: 9 * Winner's time: 2:03.24 ==Full result== { class = \\"sortable\\"  border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" style=\\"border- collapse: collapse;\\" - 7d7; text-align:center;\\" ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" Pos. ! style=\\"width:45px;\\" Marg. ! style=\\"width:160px;\\" Horse (bred) ! style=\\"width:30px;\\" Age ! style=\\"width:160px;\\" Jockey ! style=\\"width:210px;\\" Trainer (Country) ! style=\\"width:50px;\\" Odds -  1   Prince Bishop (IRE)  8  William Buick  Saeed bin Suroor (GB/UAE)  14/1 -  2  2¬æ  California Chrome (USA)  4  Victor Espinoza  Art Sherman (USA)  5/4 fav -  3  1¬º  Lea (USA)  6  Joel Rosario  Bill Mott (USA)  4/1 -  4  5¬º  Candy Boy (USA)  4  Pat Dobbs  Doug Watson (UAE)  25/1 -  5  shd  Hokko Tarumae (JPN)  6  Hideaki Miyuki  Katsuichi Nishiura (JPN)  8/1 -  6  4  African Story (GB)  8  James Doyle  Saeed bin Suroor (GB/UAE)  8/1 -  7  14¬Ω  Long River (USA)  5  Mickael Barzalona  S bin Ghadayer (UAE)  66/1 -  8  8¬Ω  Side Glance (GB)  8  Andrea Atzeni  Andrew Balding (GB)  33/1 -  9  7  Epiphaneia (JPN)  5  Christophe Soumillon  Katsuhiko Sumii (JPN)  13/2 - } * Abbreviations: nse = nose; nk = neck; shd = head; hd = head ==Winner's details== Further details of the winner, Prince Bishop * Sex: Gelding * Foaled: 10 February 2007 * Country: Ireland * Sire: Dubawi; Dam: North East Bay (Prospect Bay) * Owner: Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum * Breeder: Thurso Ltd ==References== Category:Dubai World Cup Dubai World Cup Dubai World Cup Dubai World Cup ","title":"2015 Dubai World Cup"},{"id":"46299597","text":"Magnus III of Mecklenburg (July 4, 1509 in Stargard ‚Äì January 28, 1550 in B√ºtzow) was a member of the House of Mecklenburg who was the first Lutheran administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Schwerin, nevertheless referred to as Prince-Bishop.

Though he lost the 12 round bout, Palitz was an exceptional boxer in his own right. He fought Jeff Doherty, Bunny Ford, Terry Mitchell, and Jack Britton. Doherty and Ford were regional lightweight champions while Mitchell was a boxer of such caliber that he once defeated 1906 World Welterweight Champion William \\"Honey\\" Melody. Britton held the World Welterweight championship for over four years during Palitz's career. ==Early life== Palitz grew up in the Heights section of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, and worked in his youth as a newsie delivering newspapers. He served in the U. S. Army for three years, where he learned the boxing trade, and fought his earliest professional bout with a Soldier Ferguson. During his early professional boxing career he moved to New London, Connecticut.\\"Local Newsie Becomes Star in Boxing Game\\", Wilkes-Barre The Evening News, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, pg. 13, 3 September 1914 Palitz was of Jewish ancestry according to the Hank Kaplan archives. ==Boxing career== Palitz began his more competitive boxing career by early 1911 fighting Young Ferguson twice in New London, defeating him in a fourth round knockout in their first meeting in New London in January 1911. Bunny Ford, who Palitz defeated three times in ten round matches between 1913‚Äì14 in Connecticut, was a noted regional lightweight. Ford competed for the New England Lightweight Title in 1909 against Jack Doherty, and officially for the Connecticut State Lightweight Title against Battling Kunz on November 27, 1916, losing in an eight round TKO in New Haven. In November and December 1912, he fought two ten round bouts with Brooklyn welterweight Terry Mitchell, at Lawrence Hall in New London, Connecticut, where at least one source considered him to have the edge in both close no decision bouts. Mitchell was a welterweight of the caliber to have boxed Jack Britton, Welterweight champion William \\"Honey\\" Mellody, and Bunny Ford. \\"Local Newsie Becomes Star in Boxing Game\\", Wilkes-Barre The Evening News, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, pg. 13, 3 September 1914 In March 1915, Palitz received a rare knockout from Dave Powers of Malden, Massachusetts. This defeat did not affect the long term boxing aspirations of Palitz, who may have learned from it, as he faced far more skilled opponents in the coming years.\\"Palitz takes the Count\\", The Day, pg. 14, New London, CT., 11 March 1915. On September 6, 1915, Palitz fought Abe Hollandersky in Aborn Hall in New London, in a dominating twenty round victory. New London's The Day gave only one round to Hollandersky in their newspaper decision.\\"Palitz Punishes Newsboy Harshly\\", The Day, pg. 12, New London, CT., 7 September 1915. Palitz fought New London welterweight Hollandersky four times in paid bouts, and several more times in exhibitions. In 1916 Palitz worked for a period at the Marlin Fire Arms Company in New London along with frequent opponent and lightweight champion Bunny Ford.\\"Dave Palitz Goes to Work for a Living\\", The Day, pg. 12, New London, CT., 7 October 1916. Jack Britton, Welterweight World Champion Lou Bogash, State Welterweight Champion Easily one of the greatest fighters Palitz met was welterweight champion Jack Britton to whom he lost on March 8, 1920 in a ten round newspaper decision in Hartford, Connecticut. Britton held the World Welterweight title three times in 1915, 1916, and from 1919-1922 and held it at the time of his bout with Palitz. Palitz's bout with Britton came as a warm up for his attempt at the Connecticut State Welterweight title. One of Palitz's most publicized fights was his losing bout with World Boxing Hall of Fame inductee Lou Bogash for the Connecticut Welterweight State Title in April 1920. It is worth noting that Bogash was at the top of his career during the bout, at a youthful 19 years of age, while Palitz was nearly 30, old for a boxer, and nearing the end of his more competitive career. ==Later boxing career== On November 16, 1922, Palitz lost to Mike Morley in a close twelve round bout. Morley was a competent regional welterweight who had lost the New England Welterweight Title in ten rounds to Eddie Shevlin on November 15, 1921, in Boston Massachusetts. One year later in Hartford, in December 1922, Palitz won a ten round bout with Young Marcel, a relative unknown. A local newspaper that covered the bout noted that Palitz's career had begun to wain since his loss to Lou Bogash for the Connecticut Welterweight championship in April 1920.\\"Down the Ring a Ladder\\", Norwich Bulletin, pg. 3, New London, CT., 13 December 1922.

Warner worked in industry for nearly a decade as a researcher at Polaroid Corporation, before moving to academia where he worked in various positions at University of Massachusetts Boston and Lowell. Warner is Co- founder, President, and Chief Technology Officer at the Warner-Babcock Institute for Green Chemistry, as well as Co-Founder and President of Beyond Benign. He is the recipient of the 2014 Perkin Medal, widely acknowledged as the highest honor in American industrial chemistry. == Education == Warner was born in Quincy, Massachusetts, to John A. and Natalie Warner as part of a huge family, including 47 first cousins within a one-mile radius. During his childhood, Warner first met his long-time friend and colleague Paul Anastas at age eleven, with whom he later co-authored the defining work in the developing field, Green Chemistry: Theory and Practice. Anastas and Warner both attended Quincy High School, where Warner was most well-known, not as a chemist, but as a musician. There, he played in the marching band and the jazz band, and was voted class musician. No one in Warner's family at the time had attended university, and most of them worked as tradespeople, but Warner ultimately decided to attend University of Massachusetts Boston, where Anastas also matriculated, as a music major. Warner worked in construction full-time to pay his own tuition throughout college. He played in a successful band called the Elements until the death of drummer James \\"Opie\\" Neil, at which point Warner became more much involved in his then-elective chemistry classes. He began doing research in the laboratory of Jean-Pierre Anselme, where Anastas also worked, and this ultimately inspired him to switch majors. He published five papers as an undergraduate by the time he was twenty years old. Warner graduated alongside Anastas, receiving his B.S. in Chemistry in 1984. After college, Warner pursued graduate studies at Princeton University, where he received a Ph.D. in chemistry after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled \\"Synthesis of pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines (5-deazapteridines)\\", under the supervision of Edward C. Taylor. His group helped synthesize pemetrexed (brand name Alimta), one of the most powerful anti-cancer drugs for solid tumors. == Career == Warner was offered a job immediately after graduate school in research and development at Polaroid Corporation, where he worked for almost a decade. During this time, Warner first conceived a theory called Non-Covalent Derivatization, a unique approach to chemical synthesis that involves changing the properties of a target material by exploiting its innate intermolecular forces. It was also while working for Polaroid that Warner was reunited with childhood and undergraduate friend Paul Anastas, then employed at the Environmental Protection Agency, at a meeting that inspired Warner to co- author his most influential work Green Chemistry: Theory and Practice with Anastas. In 1996, Warner returned to academia to work at University of Massachusetts Boston, where he served as tenured full professor as well as chair of the department of chemistry from 2001 to 2003. It was also there that he established the world's first Ph.D. program in Green Chemistry. Amy Cannon, whom he later married, was the program's first graduate and the first person ever to receive a Ph.D. in the field of Green Chemistry. He then moved to University of Massachusetts Lowell, where he established and directed the Center for Green Chemistry from 2004 to 2007. Warner left Lowell in 2007 to co-found, with investment firm executive Jim Babcock, the Warner-Babcock Institute for Green Chemistry, and, with his wife Amy Cannon, Beyond Benign, a nonprofit organization for green chemistry education. Committed to educating the public on green chemistry, Warner has spoken as keynote and plenary speaker for numerous green chemistry and sustainability conferences. Aside from awards for his work in the field, he was selected (with Anastas) as a \\"Top 40 Power Player\\" by ICIS in 2008, and as an Utne Reader \\"visionary\\" in 2011. == Non-Covalent Derivatization == Warner first articulated the concept of Non-Covalent Derivatization (NCD) at a conference in 1997, but he employed this concept in practice as early as 1988. He initially devised this method as a solution to a common engineering problem that hydroquinone (HQ), an essential developer in Polaroid instant photography, is not readily soluble in water. HQ is desired in more modern applications for its potency as a reducing agent, and until Warner, this problem was typically addressed by traditional chemical synthesis, or modifying a target material by attaching various functional groups via covalent bonds, also referred to as \\"covalent derivatization.\\" Inspired by phenomena he observed in nature, Warner proposed NCD as an alternative means of modifying a target material, not via covalent bonds, but innate intermolecular forces. In the model example of hydroquinone, Warner devised a novel process of co-crystallization between HQ and a terephthalamide molecule, which yielded a product complex that was much more soluble in water than HQ alone. The applications of this process ranged from film development to more recently cosmetic dermatology. NCD is now most often employed as an effective means of reducing the environmental impact of a process, by the minimizing the materials and energy required and waste produced, and is successfully applied in the production of pharmaceuticals as well as fragrances, agrochemicals, pigments, and food additives. Warner holds patents based on NCD in many of these areas, most notably drugs to treat nervous system disorders, additives to increase recyclability of asphalt, and processes to reverse depigmentation in hair. NCD was also the impetus for a consequential meeting between Warner and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), after the agency rejected a manufacturing model proposed by Polaroid based on the method. It was there that Warner was reunited with his long-time friend Paul Anastas, and the two began to formulate the Twelve Principles of Green Chemistry. Warner became so infatuated with Non-Covalent Derivatization that his Massachusetts license plate bears the initials NCD. == Green Chemistry: Theory and Practice == The seminal work Green Chemistry: Theory and Practice was first conceived in a meeting at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) about Non-Covalent Derivatization (NCD). When a new manufacturing model for instant photography based on NCD of hydroquinone was rejected by the EPA, Polaroid sent Warner to give a seminar on this new method. It was there that he met the branch chief at the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, none other than his childhood and undergraduate friend Paul Anastas. The introduction of the book highlights that many environmental crises in the twentieth century, from those depicted in Rachel Carson's influential Silent Spring to the more recent events at Times Beach and Love Canal, stemmed from the poor practice of traditional industrial chemistry. As the environmental movement grew, the chemical industry was portrayed as the clear antagonist. Anastas and Warner argue that in the past, the role of the chemist in the environment was limited to site monitoring and remediation after an accident, but in a present where so many new chemicals are constantly introduced, it is now imperative that the chemist assure that anything he or she creates is non- toxic, before it is even synthesized. One of the most influential sections of the book outlines the Twelve Principles of Green Chemistry, which have served as the foundation for green chemistry curricula and the blueprint for chemical industry practice throughout the world. The remainder of the book details how to design environmentally benign chemicals, from evaluating starting materials to examining concrete toxicological mechanisms and giving examples of green processes. Green Chemistry: Theory and Practice did not invent the term green chemistry, which was coined in the early 1990s, but it was notable because it helped to define the motives and a common mission in the developing field.

It was the first time in which United Nations treated a nation as an aggressor. ==Background== Poster of 1951 (produced by the American government) allusive to the resolution. The text is in thai. The text in the arrow translates \\"44 nations condemn red China\\". The names of the countries that approved the resolution appeared. In late 1950, hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops crossed into North Korea to help the troops of North Korea to fight the coalition led by United States and South Korea. The General Assembly vote followed unsuccessful attempts by the U.S. delegation to the United Nations to have the Security Council take action against the Chinese. Exercising his nation's veto power, the Soviet representative on the Security Council consistently blocked the U.S. effort. Turning to the General Assembly, the U.S. delegation called for the United Nations to condemn communist China as an aggressor in Korea. ==The resolution in few words== The resolution had 3 main points: * The aggression of the People's Republic of China is condemned * The Chinese troops are exhorted to leave Korea * The United Nations member states are exhorted to continue supporting the U.N. troops in Korea ==The voting in detail== For Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ethiopia, France, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Iceland, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, Liberia, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Venezuela. Against Burma, Byelorrusian SSR, Czechoslovakia, India, Poland, Ukrainian SSR, USSR. Abstentions Afghanistan, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Syria, Yemen, Yugoslavia. ==Aftermath== Poster of the time (produced by the American government) allusive to the resolution. In this poster, the number of countries that condemned red China is 53, when the right number is 44. The action was largely symbolic, because many nations were reluctant to take more forceful action against the People's Republic of China for fear that the conflict in Korea would escalate. While economic and political sanctions could have been brought against China, the United Nations decided to take no further action. The Korean War continued for 2 more years, finally ending in a stalemate and an armistice in 1953. ==See also== *United Nations General Assembly resolution *United Nations Security Council resolution ==References== Category:United Nations General Assembly resolutions Category:Korean War Category:1951 in the United Nations Category:February 1951 events Category:Korea and the United Nations Category:China and the United Nations ","title":"United Nations General Assembly Resolution 498"},{"id":"46299772","text":"Lucas Simon Pierre Tousart (born 29 April 1997) is a French footballer who plays for Hertha BSC in the Bundesliga.

The Kastles won their WTT-record fifth consecutive King Trophy when they defeated the Austin Aces in the WTT Championship Match. The Kastles were led by Leander Paes, who was named WTT Final Most Valuable Player, and Anastasia Rodionova, who was named WTT Female Co-Most Valuable Player. ==Season recap== Draft At the WTT Draft on March 16, 2015, it was announced that the world's number 1 female player Serena Williams had been assigned by the league to the Kastles as a designated player. The Kastles also protected Martina Hingis, Venus Williams, Leander Paes and Anastasia Rodionova. They used their first-round selection in the roster portion of the draft to pick roster-exempt player Sam Querrey. The league's designation of Serena Williams made it impossible for her to be drafted by any other team and relieved the Kastles of having to draft her along with her sister Venus as a marquee doubles team in the second round of the marquee portion of the draft. This will allow the Kastles to protect only one of Serena and Venus in the following season's draft should the other decide not to participate in the league in 2016. Other player transactions On May 6, 2015, the Kastles signed Madison Brengle as a substitute player. On June 26, 2015, the Kastles signed Denis Kudla, a resident of nearby Arlington County, Virginia, as a substitute player. On July 10, 2015, the Kastles announced the signing of Rajeev Ram as a substitute for Leander Paes, who was scheduled to play in the mixed doubles final at Wimbledon on the same day as the Kastles' season opener. Serena Williams injured On July 20, 2015, the Kastles announced that Serena Williams would be unable to play for the team in 2016, due to an injury. Fans attending the Kastles' July 21 match in which Williams was scheduled to play were given choices of either a $10 voucher redeemable at food concession stands, a 50% discount on purchases of Kastles gear up to $50 or a free ticket to a future home match. Winning streak and a playoff berth after a mediocre start After the team announced the injury to Serena Williams, the Kastles lost a road match in which she was originally scheduled to play that same evening against the Philadelphia Freedoms, 18‚Äì16, and saw their record drop to 4 wins and 3 losses at the midway point of the season. Despite the slow start, one of the Kastles' wins came on July 18, by a score of 23‚Äì6 over the Freedoms. The 17-game margin of victory matched the largest in franchise history. The previous 17-game margins came on July 22, 2012, against the Kansas City Explorers and July 9, 2014, against the Boston Lobsters. Both of those matches ended with 25‚Äì8 final scores. In this match, the Kastles actually lost the opening set and trailed the match, 5‚Äì3. From there, they won 20 of the next 21 games, including all of the final 16. As the Kastles embarked on the second half of their season, the team regrouped and dominated the Lobsters at home, 25‚Äì13, earning the first of what would be five straight wins. The Kastles set a new home attendance record in the match with 4,255 fans passing through the gates. After a night off, the Kastles faced the Lobsters again and repeated the feat of sweeping all five sets in a 25‚Äì14 victory. The Kastles' big test came on July 24, when they went on the road to face the Austin Aces, who entered the match with 8 wins and only 1 loss. The Kastles had already suffered a home loss at the hands of the Aces early in the season. The Kastles won four of the five sets for a convincing 22‚Äì14 victory that improved their record to 7‚Äì3 and clinched the team's fifth consecutive playoff berth. Martina Hingis led the way, teaming with Leander Paes in the first set of mixed doubles and Anastasia Rodionova in the second set of women's doubles to give the Kastles an early 10‚Äì4 lead. Paes and Sam Querrey took the fourth set of men's doubles to extend the lead to 17‚Äì11, before Querrey took the final set of men's singles, 5‚Äì3, over Teymuraz Gabashvili to close out the match. The following night, the Kastles clinched the top seed in the Eastern Conference and home-court advantage for the Eastern Conference Championship Match when the California Dream defeated the Lobsters, 21‚Äì19, in extended play. Late-season showdown On July 28, 2015, the four-time defending WTT champion Kastles visited he Austin Aces, who entered the match with 10 wins and 2 losses and a chance to clinch the best overall regular- season record in WTT for 2015. A win by the Kastles would have given them control of their own destiny in the race for the WTT's top overall seed, and they would need only a home victory the following night against the Boston Lobsters. The Kastles got off to a quick start, taking the first two sets and building a 10‚Äì7 lead. Leander Paes and Sam Querrey won a tiebreaker in the opening set of men's doubles, and Anastasia Rodionova and Madison Brengle took a 5‚Äì3 set win in women's doubles. But Teymuraz Gabashvili put the Aces ahead, 12‚Äì10, with a 5‚Äì0 set win over Querrey in men's singles. Rodionova and Paes bounced back with a 5‚Äì2 set win in mixed doubles to put the Kastles back in front, 15‚Äì14, heading into the final set of women's singles. Elina Svitolina topped Madison Brengle, 5‚Äì1, to give the Aces a 19‚Äì16 victory and the best overall regular-season record in WTT for 2015. Eastern Conference championship The Kastles hosted the Philadelphia Freedoms in the Eastern Conference Championship Match on July 30, 2015. It was a dominant performance for Washington, as the Kastles took all five sets en route to a 25‚Äì9 victory for their fifth consecutive Eastern Conference title. Martina Hingis teamed with Leander Paes in the opening set of mixed doubles for a 5‚Äì1 set win and later with Anastasia Rodionova to take a tiebreaker in the fourth set of women's doubles. Madison Brengle chipped in by saving three break points and winning both 3-all points for a 5‚Äì2 set win in women's singles. Paes and Sam Querrey took the men's doubles set, 5‚Äì2. Querrey closed out the match with a 5‚Äì0 whitewash of Robby Ginepri in men's singles. A fifth consecutive King Trophy The Kastles won their fifth consecutive King Trophy as WTT champions when they defeated the Austin Aces in the WTT Final on August 2, 2015. The Kastles were led by their captain, WTT Final Most Valuable Player Leander Paes, who teamed with Martina Hingis to take the opening set of mixed doubles from Teymuraz Gabashvili and Alla Kudryavtseva, 5‚Äì2, and then with Sam Querrey to win the men's doubles set, 5‚Äì3, over Gabashvili and Jarmere Jenkins. Hingis and Anastasia Rodionova took the second set of women's doubles in a tiebreaker after each team broke the other's serve three times. With the Kastles leading, 15‚Äì9, Querrey faced Gabashvili, who led WTT in winning percentage in men's singles during the regular season. Querrey served six aces and won 14 of his 16 first-serve points to hold in all four of his service games without facing a break point or a 3-all point. Gabashvili matched Querrey's performance with four holds of his own that also featured no break point or 3-all point opportunities. Querrey was able to prevail in the tiebreaker game to give the Kastles a 20‚Äì13 lead heading to the final set. Madison Brengle faced Elina Svitolina in the final set of women's singles. Svitolina fell behind a break early in the set but broke back twice for a 5‚Äì3 set win that sent the match to extended play with the Kastles leading the match, 23‚Äì18. Brengle hit a backhand winner in the first game of extended play to end the match and secure the title for the Kastles. After the match, Paes said, \\"It's just a beautiful moment to share. I've had a really long career and done some really special things, and this is way up there with the best of them. I'd like to dedicate this MVP award to every single Kastles member, not only on the court, but behind the scenes, and every single Kastles fan.\\" Kastles coach Murphy Jensen said, \\"It's a dream come true. It's so different. You'd think this'd get old hat, but it doesn't. It was a bigger challenge, because players were coming and going during the season. But to get them all to perform the way they did against an extremely tough team says a lot about our organization.\\" ==Event chronology== * March 16, 2015: The Kastles protected Martina Hingis, Venus Williams, Leander Paes and Anastasia Rodionova and drafted Serena Williams and Sam Querrey at the WTT draft. * May 6, 2015: The Kastles signed Madison Brengle as a substitute player. * June 26, 2015: The Kastles signed Denis Kudla as a substitute player. * July 10, 2015: The Kastles signed Rajeev Ram as a substitute player. * July 24, 2015: With a record of 7 wins and 3 losses, the Kastles clinched a playoff berth with a 22‚Äì14 win over the Austin Aces. * July 25, 2015: With a record of 7 wins and 3 losses, the Kastles clinched first place in the Eastern Conference and home-court advantage for the Eastern Conference Championship Match when the California Dream defeated the Boston Lobsters, 21‚Äì19, in extended play. * July 30, 2015: The Kastles won the Eastern Conference championship with a 25‚Äì9 home victory against the Philadelphia Freedoms. * August 2, 2015: The Kastles defeated the Austin Aces, 24‚Äì18, in extended play to win their fifth consecutive King Trophy as World TeamTennis Champions.

After arriving with a landfall only 26 miles in error, he learned that there were contemporary sailors in the Santa Cruz and Caroline Islands who still sailed large distances by the traditional methods and obtained support from the Australian National University to visit and sail with them. He did this in a 39-foot gaff ketch, Isbjorn, which he placed under the direction of the navigators Tevake and Hipour. These navigators spoke very little English, were illiterate and did not understand maps but were able to take him eventually on a 450-mile trip from Puluwat to Saipan and to return and teach him many of their techniques. The book is largely based on these voyages, but there are extensive references to the literature. Part 1 - The Puzzle \\"Captain Cook in 1775 was uniquely fortunate in encountering Tupaia, a dispossessed high chief and navigator-priest of Raiatea who was the only highly qualified Polynesian navigator who was ever interviewed at length by Europeans.\\" But generally the very idea that people without instruments, charts or writing, could have developed an elaborate and effective art (or \\"pre-science\\") of navigation was so utterly foreign as not even to enter the minds of most Europeans. Since then there have been the traditionalists such as Percy Smith who have uncritically accepted the migration legends of the Polynesians as literal history and those, such as Thor Heyerdahl, who dismissed these and emphasised drifting and one-way voyages. Although the distances involved are thousands of miles, it's possible to traverse the whole ocean with voyages of not more than 310 miles with a few exceptions. The islands of the Pacific can further be grouped into \\"contact zones\\" in which the maximum distances are usually 50‚Äì200 miles. However, computer simulations have shown that pure drifting cannot explain the distribution of humans across the whole area. Part 2 - Direction \\"The most accurate direction indicators for Pacific Islanders, still used in many parts of Oceania, are stars low in the sky that have either just risen or are about to set, that is horizon or guiding stars ... Although stars rise four minutes earlier each night ... the points on the horizon where they rise and set remain the same throughout the year.\\" Thirty- two such stars were used to form a \\"sidereal compass\\" by which directions are given (first described by Jos√© And√≠a y Varela in 1774). Those in the east‚Äìwest direction which rise in a nearly vertical direction are the easiest to use. Other stars with the same declination must be memorised in order to continue throughout the night. In practice it is rare to require more than ten guide stars for a night's sailing‚Äîroughly twelve hours in the tropics‚Äîand less for an east‚Äìwest course. On a cloudy night an experienced navigator can orient himself using only a few stars. It is harder to use the sun during the day because of the changes in its position during the seasons, and it is necessary to use the swell of the ocean as an aid (not waves, which are local and variable). e.g. in the Santa Cruz group, three swells are considered to be present all round the year: the 'long swell' from the south east, the 'sea swell' from east-north-east and the 'hoahuadelahu' from the north-west. The helmsman detects the most reliable using balance. Part 3 - Compensation and orientation For accurate navigation it is essential to compensate for the effect of currents and leeway. Although there are usually swift currents around islands, the major currents take over more than 5‚Äì6 miles from land. The major currents are east to west in most parts of Polynesia and Micronesia, but there is a narrow band of the equatorial counter current going west to east. These can make a difference of 40 miles per day. The prime method of coping with currents is by taking backsights on the land when leaving so as to be able to estimate the current and also the leeway (the angle the boat is drifting off the wind). On many islands, leading marks are set up to aid in this. The course is then adjusted to suit the conditions. There can be daily fluctuations in current but these are generally random and do not accumulate. Expert navigators can also detect currents from the shape of the waves, if the current is confined to the top layers of the water. Their estimates of distance made good seems to be largely intuitive, based on long experience, and their sense of position derives from keeping in mind where 'home' and other islands are, which can be maintained even when blown far in a gale. They also use the stellar bearings of intermediate islands to judge their progress, even when these are out of sight (a technique known as etak). The memory of the relative position of islands is passed down the generations using the star compass so that a grandson might use a course that hasn't been followed since his grandfather used it. Part 4 - Expanded target landfall and position The navigation accuracy required to find an island in the Pacific by sight may be better than 1¬∞ and other methods are necessary to make the approach to an island. The basic technique is to \\"enlarge\\" the island by identifying signs of approaching land. Observing the behaviour of seabirds which fly out to their feeding grounds in the morning and return in the evening is one of the most well-known of the techniques. For example, boobies regularly fly 30 miles from an island to forage and some varieties go to 50 miles. In the Gilbert Islands, characteristic cloud patterns are the preferred means of locating islands. The swell of the sea can be both reflected by an island and refracted round it, giving clues to the experienced navigator in excess of 30 miles. With large land masses such as New Zealand the effect is more pronounced. Another sign which works best on dark rainy nights is deep phosphorescence causing flashes in the sea originating from the island and observable up to 80‚Äì100 miles away. Navigators on several archipelagos were able to home in on an island by observing which stars were overhead, using it as a fix on latitude. Part 5 - The Lonely Seaways A Tongan tongiaki with bonito fishing canoe in foreground seen by Tasman, 1643. The canoes with which the Polynesians explored the oceans were double canoes which tacked like a European sailing ship whereas the Micronesians used canoes with outriggers on one side which were tacked by reversing the direction of travel, so that the outrigger stayed to windward. The preferred size for long distances throughout Oceania was 50‚Äì75 feet, which were least likely to succumb in storms and could carry up to 50 people. The hulls were generally V-shaped made of planks held together by coconut fibre, which would be replaced after a long voyage. They were primarily sailing vessels with auxiliary power provided by paddles. Cook recorded a mean speed of 7 knots close-hauled, which was rather faster than his own vessels. Provisioning allowed for trips up to a month which could be extended by another two weeks without undue hardship. At the present day, the voyaging canoes in the Carolines are smaller, typically 26 feet with a crew of five or six. The reasons for voyaging vary from recreation to one way trips for colonization. Some of these were accidental and achieved by drifting rather than sailing. Many canoes which storm-drifted to the Philippines from the Yap region made successful returns home. But because of prevailing winds, westerly drifts are far more common than easterly. Tahiti to Hawaii, 2000 miles across the prevailing winds is impossible to drift but fine for sailing. Arriving at Easter Island must have been fortuitous. Raiding and conquest were a traditional motive. ==Reception== The Starpath School of Navigation in Seattle says \\"This is the classic study of Polynesian navigation by one of the world's greatest sailors and adventurers.\\" In the American Anthropologist, Philip Devita said \\"Lewis' work is indeed a pioneering effort, a work that should provide Oceanic scholars with a clearly needed understanding of the indigenous navigational practices which remain transmitted in the oral tradition ... The volume is essentially a report of Lewis‚Äô experiments in testing the accuracy of Oceanic landfinding.\\". ==Notes== Category:1972 non- fiction books Category:Polynesian navigation Category:Polynesian navigators ","title":"We, the Navigators"},{"id":"46300218","text":"Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher pictured in 1983 The 1983 Dissolution Honours List was gazetted on 21 July 1983 following the advice of the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.

Though he lost the fight, he went toe to toe with a world class competitor for eighteen rounds and would meet four more boxing champions, easily placing him among the World's top ten featherweight boxers for his era. Though just missing a world title against Young Corbett II and George Dixon, Rice fought contenders Joe Bernstein, and Benny Yanger, as well as champions Harry Harris, Dave Sullivan, and Terry McGovern. ==Early life== Rice was born in Waterford, Connecticut, a suburb of New London, on December 25, 1872. He may have shared Tony Nelson as a boxing coach in his youth with fellow New London boxers Mosey King, an early New England Lightweight Champion and Abe Hollandersky, a welterweight, and 1913 Panamanian Heavyweight champion.Donahue, Thomas E., \\"Ins and Outs of Sport's World\\", The Day, pg. 23, New London, CT., 17 September 1935.\\"Austin Rice, Dean of Connecticut Fighters\\", Bridgeport Herald, pg. 2, Bridgeport, CT., 29 November 1903. Rice got his start in boxing while drilling as a Waterford militiaman. He did some amateur bouts in New London while stationed there. One of his early boxing friends and sparring partners, Jim Gaffney, of New London, later became an important figure in the New London Police Department as well as a boxing manager. Another early opponent was Eddie Gallagher of New York. Martin and Joe Flaherty of New London worked as early managers for Rice. ==Boxing career and life in Connecticut== Rice fought Boston featherweight Dave Sullivan a total of four times, with the first bout coming on September 15, 1896, in a ten round draw in Queens, New York. They would fight a twelve round draw in November 1896 in New York at the New York Athletic Club, as well as meeting in 1902 and 1903. Sullivan would briefly hold the Featherweight Championship of the world for forty-six days from September to November 1898. George Dixon, ex-Bantamweight, and Featherweight Champion On December 19, 1901, Rice fought and defeated former World Bantamweight and Featherweight Champion George Dixon in a classic twenty round match at the Grand Opera House in his hometown of New London, Connecticut. Connecticut's Meriden Weekly Republican, wrote \\"Mr. Pollack (referee) announced Rice the victor and the crowd cheered itself hoarse although a few crawled through the ropes to sympathize with Dixon. The decision was popular and just.\\" Dixon held the featherweight championship of the World from 1891 until losing it only a month earlier to Abe Attell on October 28, 1901. Although Canadian born, Dixon became the first Black American World champion of the twentieth century.\\"Hard Fought Mill, Austin Rice Wins from George Dixon\\",Meriden Weekly Republican, pg. 2, New London, CT., 26 December 1901. Harry Harris, ex-Bantamweight Champion 1901-2 Two months later, on February 27, 1902, Rice fought Jewish ex-Bantamweight World Champion Harry Harris to a six round draw at Chicago's Pyramid Athletic Club. That spring, Rice fought Benny Yanger, one of his most gifted opponents. Yanger, though never confirmed as a featherweight champion, beat boxing Hall of Famer Abe Attell by TKO in a close and historic nineteen round match on April 24, 1902 in St. Louis. Attell held the World Featherweight Title for an historic ten years between 1902-1912. Only one month after Yanger's remarkable win over featherweight champion Attell, Rice was selected to face Yanger in a six round match in Chicago, Illinois on May 26, 1902, though he lost. The Topeka State Journal wrote that \\"George Siler gave the decision to Yanger, but not without protest from the majority of the sporting writers of the Chicago dailies.\\" Another source noted that Rice may have won the battle with Yanger if there had been a few additional rounds.\\"Featherweight Rice\\", The Topeka State journal, p. 2, Topeka, Kansas, 4 September 1903\\"Austin Rice Wins\\", Bridgeport Herald, pg. 6, Bridgeport, CT., 26 November 1899.\\"Kid Brennan\\",The Day, pg. 36, New London, CT., 11 May 1902.Blady, Ken (1988).

Twice, Rice fought Billy Barrett, a competent New York featherweight in Stafford Springs and Middletown, Connecticut on October 2, and May 1, 1901. Both bouts garnered considerable local press. They had met previously on November 26, 1899 in a close match in New York at catchweights of 128 pounds. Rice won the bout by a narrow margin. He was well respected in New London for supporting a variety of civic causes. On June 2, 1904, Rice fought a sparring match for the benefit of the Pastime club of New London.\\"New London, 50 Years Ago\\", The Day, pg. 6, New London, CT., 2 June 1904. In August 1904, Rice consented to box a three round exhibition match at the opening of the New London Opera House with fellow New London boxer and long time Yale boxing coach Mosey King.\\"New London, 25 Years Ago\\", The Day, pg. 58, New London, CT., 14 August 1929. Young Corbett II, Featherweight Champion Rice was first scheduled for a 20 round exhibition with Young Corbett II, featherweight champion, in Waterford, Connecticut, on November 6, 1902. The match did not take place until January 14, 1903 in Arkansas, and the originally scheduled bout never took place. According to one article, police officers arrested Rice in Waterbury to prevent his fighting on November 6. Corbett II was apparently arrested in Hartford as well, on the grounds that boxing was illegal in Connecticut at the time.\\"Boxer Rice Kidnapped\\", Bridgeport Herald, pg. 12, Bridgeport, CT., 2 November 1902.\\"Rice Means to be Fit\\", The Day, pg. 75, New London, CT., 8 October 1902.

Rice Made a Good Record in Ring\\", Norwich Bulletin Norwich, Connecticut, pg. 3, 18 January 1921 The Featherweight Title Bout with Young Corbett II in Arkansas on January 14, which Rice lost in a 17 round TKO, was one of the most difficult of Rice's life, and he was in considerable distress by the end of the bout, More significantly, however, the Norwich Bulletin felt Rice unexpectedly dominated the first three rounds of the historic bout, and may have performed better if not for exhaustion from the long train ride he took to get to Hot Springs.\\"Rice Gave Corbett a Hard Battle\\", Bridgeport Herald, pg. 2, Bridgeport, CT., 15 January 1903. This fight became the only sanctioned chance at the World Featherweight Title Rice would receive. Rice operated a small farm in Waterford, Connecticut with the proceeds of his boxing wins. He was depicted by the press as a frugal person, and adept as a carpenter. ==Later boxing years and retirement== At the end of his more competitive years as a boxer, he fought a few exhibition bouts in New London to benefit local organizations, including the Local Fraternity of Owls in January 1911.\\"New London 25 Years Ago\\",The Day, pg. 4, New London, CT., 18 January 1936. When not gaining income as a boxer, Rice worked at an iron mill near the end of his career. At times, he made extra income as a wrestler, as did many boxers of his era. Rice died as a result of injuries from being run over by a wagon he was driving on January 17, 1921. He had been married and left one son, George.\\"Iron Man Austin Rice Died Saturday Evening\\", Meriden Morning Record, pg. 2, Meriden, CT., 17 January 1921. ==References * Category:Boxers from Connecticut Category:1872 births Category:American male boxers Category:1921 deaths Category:Featherweight boxers Category:Sportspeople from New London, Connecticut ","title":"Austin Rice"},{"id":"46300295","text":"Joseph D‚ÄôLacey is a British author, known for his science fiction, fantasy and horror stories, many of which have environmental themes.

While intestinal failure can oftentimes be treated with alternative therapies such as parenteral nutrition (PN), complications such as PN-associated liver disease and short bowel syndrome may make transplantation the only viable option. One of the rarest type of organ transplantation performed, intestine transplantation is becoming increasingly prevalent as a therapeutic option due to improvements in immunosuppressive regimens, surgical technique, PN, and the clinical management of pre and post-transplant patients. ==History== Intestine transplantation dates back to 1959, when a team of surgeons at the University of Minnesota led by Richard C. Lillehei reported successful transplantation of the small intestine in dogs. Five years later in 1964, Ralph Deterling in Boston attempted the first human intestinal transplant, albeit unsuccessfully. For the next two decades, attempts at transplanting the small intestine in humans were met with universal failure, and patients died of technical complications, sepsis, or graft rejection. However, the discovery of the immunosuppressant ciclosporin in 1972 triggered a revolution in the field of transplant medicine. Due to this discovery, in 1988, the first successful intestinal transplant was performed in Germany by E. Deltz, followed shortly by teams in France and Canada. Intestinal transplantation was no longer an experimental procedure, but rather a life-saving therapy. In 1990, a newer immunosuppressant drug, tacrolimus, appeared on the market as a superior alternative to ciclosporin. In the two decades since, intestine transplant efforts have improved tremendously in both number and outcomes. ==Pre- transplant diagnoses and short bowel syndrome== Failure of the small intestine would be life-threatening due to the inability to absorb nutrients, fluids, and electrolytes from food. Without these essential substances and the ability to maintain energy balances, homeostasis cannot be maintained and one's prognosis will be dismal. Causes of intestinal failure may be clinically complex, and may result from a combination of nutritional, infectious, traumatic, and metabolic complications that affect ordinary anatomy and physiology. Many underlying conditions that serve as precursors to failure are genetic or congenital in nature. For example, severe inflammation, ulceration, bowel obstruction, fistulation, perforation, or other pathologies of Crohn's disease may severely compromise intestinal function. Despite the danger these conditions may pose in themselves, they may lead to even further, more serious complications that necessitate replacement of the diseased intestine. The single leading cause for an intestinal transplant is affliction with short bowel syndrome, oftentimes a secondary condition of some other form of intestinal disease. Short-bowel syndrome was the cause for 73% of American intestinal transplantations in 2008, followed by functional bowel problems for 15% and other causes representing 12% of cases. Natural SBS is mercifully rare, estimated to be 3 per 100,000 births. Surgical removal is the most common cause, performed as a treatment for various gastroenterological and congenital conditions such as Crohn's disease, necrotizing enterocolitis, mesenteric ischemia, motility disorder, omphalocele/gastroschisis, tumors, and volvulus. ==Alternative treatments== Prescription parenteral nutrition formulation. Regardless of the underlying condition, the loss of intestinal function does not necessarily necessitate a transplant. Several conditions, such as necrotizing enterocolitis or volvulus, may be adequately resolved by other surgical and nonsurgical treatments, especially if SBS never develops. An individual can obtain nutrients intravenously through PN, bypassing food consumption entirely and its subsequent digestion. Long-term survival with SBS and without PN is possible with enteral nutrition, but this is inadequate for many patients as it depends on the remaining intestine's ability to adapt and increase its absorptive capacity. Although more complicated and expensive to perform, any person may receive PN. Although PN can meet all energy, fluid, and nutrient needs and can be performed at home, quality of life can be significantly decreased. On average, PN takes 10 to 16 hours to administer but can take up to 24. Over this time frame, daily life can be significantly hindered as a consequence of attachment to the IV pump. Over long periods of time, PN can lead to numerous health conditions, including severe dehydration, catheter-related infections, and liver disease. PN-associated liver disease strikes up to 50% of patients within 5‚Äì7 years, correlated with a mortality rate of 2‚Äì50%. Another alternative treatment to transplant for patients with SBS is surgical bowel lengthening via either serial transverse enteroplasty (STEP) or the older longitudinal intestinal lengthening and tailoring (LILT) technique. Although both procedures contribute to an approximate 70% increase in length, STEP appears somewhat more favorable in terms of lower mortality and progression to transplant. Nevertheless, a positive reception to either procedure may reduce the level of PN required, if not negate its required use altogether. ==Indications== There are four Medicare and Medicaid-approved indications for intestine transplantation: a loss of two of the six major routes of venous access, multiple episodes of catheter-associated life- threatening sepsis, fluid and electrolyte abnormalities in the face of maximal medical therapy, and PN-associated liver disease. Transplants may also be performed if the growth and development of a pediatric patient fails to ensue, or in extreme circumstances for patients with an exceptionally low quality of life on PN. A multidisciplinary team consisting of transplant surgeons, gastroenterologists, dieticians, anesthesiologists, psychiatrists, financial representatives, and other specialists should be consulted to evaluate the treatment plan and ensure transplantation is the patient's best option. Psychological preparations should be made for the transplant team and patient as well. Early referral requires trust between all parties involved in the operation to ensure that a rush to judgment does not lead to a premature transplant. Other absolute contraindications to receiving an intestinal transplant include the presence of systemic and untreated local infections, malignant cancer, severe neurological impairment, and severe cardiac and/or pulmonary disease. These criteria are similar to established guidelines for transplants of other organ types. HIV infection is a relative contraindication for intestine transplantation; desperate terminal patients may accept a transplant from a HIV-positive donor if they are willing to expose themselves to HIV. ==Transplant types== There are three major types of intestine transplants: an isolated intestinal graft, a combined intestinal-liver graft, and a multivisceral graft in which other abdominal organs may be transplanted as well. In the most basic and common graft, an isolated intestinal graft, only sections of the jejunum and ileum are transplanted. These are performed in the absence of liver failure. In the event of severe liver dysfunction due to PN, enzyme deficiencies, or other underlying factors, the liver may be transplanted along with the intestine. In a multivisceral graft, the stomach, duodenum, pancreas, and/or colon may be included in the graft. Multivisceral grafts are considered when the underlying condition significantly compromises other sections of the digestive system, such as intra-abdominal tumors that have not yet metastasized, extensive venous thrombosis or arterial ischemia of the mesentery, and motility syndromes. ==Pre-operative period== Donated intestines, like all organs, should be matched to a recipient prior to recovery, as to prepare him or her and minimize the time the organ spends outside the body. Potential recipients are placed on the International Intestinal Transplant Registry (ITR), where they contribute to the world's growing understanding of intestine transplantation. Before a transplant may be performed, an organ must first be located. In the United States, the matching of all organs is coordinated by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). The standard intestinal donor is deceased with a diagnosis of brain death. In terms of transplant outcomes, brain-dead donors are highly preferable to donors who have suffered cardiopulmonary death. If respiration can be assisted by a ventilator, brain-dead donors may exhibit maintainable cardiac, endocrine, and excretory function. If appropriately managed, the continuation of blood flow and bodily metabolism allows for healthier organs for procurement and additional time to prepare recipients for transplant. Furthermore, terminal ileum recovery from living donors is possible., and a laparoscopic technique is being developed to harvest limited sections of small bowel from living donors. When determining potential donor-recipient matches, important characteristics include donor size, age, tissue quality, and ABO and histo-compatibility. If the intestine is too large, it may be not transplantable into young or small patients. Ideally, intestines should be selected from donors of lighter weight than the proposed recipients to ensure simple closure of the abdominal wound. If a patient is too young or too old, they may not be hardy enough to survive the operation and recovery period. If the donor and recipient organs do not meet compatibility requirements, the threat of organ rejection by the body is all but certain. Organ rejection is the unfortunate circumstance of the host immune system recognizing the transplanted organ as foreign. This is the most notable complication facing transplant recipients. Through T-cell receptors, T-lymphocytes are able to distinguish between self and non-self by recognizing human leukocyte antigens (HLA) bound to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein located on the surface of organ cells. Once identified as foreign, the immune system proceeds to destroy the transplanted tissue. The panel reactive antibody (PRA) test measures the proportion of the population to which a recipient will react via pre-existing antibodies to various HLA antigens; in other words, how likely a patient is to acutely reject their new transplant. Therefore, it is essential that HLA and PRA statuses are tested for and demonstrate low immunoreactivity of the patient to the graft. In some cases, a recipient may suffer from graft-versus-host disease, in which cells of the transplanted organ attack the recipient's cells. To ensure proper histocompatibility, tissue quality, and safety from infection, blood work should be collected and tested in the laboratory. In addition to HLA and PRA typing, the complete blood count (CBC), coagulation profile, complete metabolic panel, and ABO blood group determination tests should be performed for both the donor and recipient. ABO-incompatible grafts can sometimes be performed on very young pediatric patients, as their immune systems have not fully developed and for whom waiting list mortality remains high. Additionally, blood serum should be tested for the presence of viruses, including HIV, hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibodies to prevent infection. Particularly in the immunocompromised system necessitated by the transplant, these viruses can wreak havoc on the body and become extremely dangerous, even fatal. Even with healthy physiological levels, ABO and HLA compatibilities, and no signs of bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, organ transplantation is not without extrasurgical risk. ==Waitlist and donation outcomes== A major challenge facing the intestinal transplant enterprise is meeting the need for transplantable intestines, particularly in the United States where the majority of intestinal transplants take place. There exists a narrow timeslot between procurement and transplantation that any organ remains viable, and logistical challenges are faced regarding bringing organ and recipient together. During procurement, organs that are being recovered are cooled and perfused with preservation solution. This slows organ activity and increases the time they remain viable for transplant. Although chilling and perfusion may extend intestinal lifespans by several hours, failure is still imminent unless transplanted. This duration between the cooling of the organ during procurement and the restoration of physiological temperature during implantation is the cold ischemic time. Due to the sensitivity of the intestine to ischemic injury, many potential donor intestines are lost to the events following brain death and trauma. Furthermore, irreversible intestinal damage is seen after approximately only 5 hours of cold ischemia in the form of mucosal damage and bacterial translocation outside the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, ensuring cardiac survival and nearby donor-recipient proximity before procurement are essential so organs do not wait too long outside the body and without blood flow. Not only is there a lack of transplantable intestines, but a deficiency in the number of centers possessing the capability to carry out the complicated transplant procedure as well. , there were only 61 medical centers in the world capable of executing an intestinal transplant. Furthermore, many young, small children, particularly those weighing less than 5 kg, cannot find a transplant due to the lack of size-matched donors. Despite these challenges, obtaining an intestine for transplant is rather probable in the United States. In 2008, there were 212 people on the U.S. intestinal transplant waitlist, 94% of whom were U.S. citizens. Regardless of transplant type, over half of new registrants are 5 years of age or younger. Adults compromise the next largest cohort, followed by pediatric patients aged 6 and older. In 2008, the ethnic composition of the intestinal transplant waitlist was 65% White, 18% Black, 16% Hispanic, 1% Asian, and 0.5% other or mixed race, resembling the demographics of the American general population at the time aside from a below-average Asian cohort. ABO blood types also matched the general population, with 31% A, 14% B, 5% AB, and 50% O. In 2004, the average waiting period to receive a transplant was 220 days, with a median of 142 days in 2008. The rate of waitlist additions has shifted from year to year; gains increased until 2006 (with 317 added), but then decreased in 2012 (to 124 added). In 2007, only 9% of patients on the U.S. waitlist died while waiting for a transplant. Waitlist mortality peaked around 2002 and was highest for liver-intestine (pediatric) patients. Deaths among all pediatric groups awaiting intestine-liver transplants have decreased in the years leading up to 2014 whereas adult intestine-liver deaths have dropped less dramatically. The decrease in recent years is likely due to improved care of infants with intestinal failure and subsequently a decrease in referrals for transplant. Although many improvements have been made in the States, outcomes everywhere still demonstrate much room for improvement. Worldwide, 25% of pediatric patients on the waitlist for an intestinal transplant die before they can receive one. ==Procurement protocol== Following matching of the organ, the complicated procurement of the small bowel can be performed by a team of abdominal transplant surgeons. Once a donor has been selected and approved for donation, several pretreatments may be initiated to destroy microorganisms and immune cells. The donor intestine must be decontaminated with several antibiotics, including neomycin, erythromycin, amphotericin B, and cephalosporin. They may also be treated with anti-lymphocyte antibodies (anti- thymocyte globulin, alemtuzumab), irradiation directed against excessive mesenteric lymphatic tissue, and have their bowel irrigated. Once donor preparation is accomplished, procurement can begin by utilizing the same standard techniques for all abdominal organ procurements. The team exposes the abdominal cavity and inserts two cannulae for the infusion of University of Wisconsin organ preservation solution into the aorta and inferior mesenteric vein. As the abdominal organs are cooled in situ, the surrounding tissue is dissected so that they may be quickly extracted. In the next step, the aorta is cross-clamped, cutting off blood supply to the organs. Once blood and oxygen supply to an organ is cut off, organ death will approach swiftly unless steps are taken to preserve them until transplant. Organs are therefore fully drained of blood, flushed with cool preservation solution, and removed from the body. In an isolated intestinal transplant, the colon will be detached from the small intestine. The cecum and ascending colon are devascularized, while care is taken to preserve major vasculature in the ileum. The jejunum will be separated from the duodenum while preserving the vasculature of the jejunum, ileum, mesentery, and the pancreas. If healthy, the pancreas can oftentimes be retrieved as an additional isolated procurement. The intestinal allograft, when ready to be extracted, is attached by the mesenteric pedicle, where the vessels converge out of the intestinal system. This pedicle will be stapled closed, and can be separated from the body via a transverse cut to create a vascular cuff. The complete intestinal allograft can then be removed and wrapped in a surgical towel. The protocols for combined liver and multivisceral procurements are far more complicated and meticulous than isolated intestine alone. ==Transplantation protocol== Isolated intestine transplant diagram. First, any abdominal scar tissue from previous surgeries must be removed. The aorta and vena cava are dissected in preparation for vascular anastomosis, followed by dissection of the proximal and distal ends of the digestive tract. Anastomosis is then performed to revascularize the graft. Arterial vessels are connected to the abdominal aorta, below the kidneys. However, venous drainage, or the reattachment of the transplanted organ to the venous system, may be performed differently depending on the unique intra-abdominal vasculature of the recipient. The graft is usually drained systemically into the infrarenal vena cava, but may also be drained portally into the hepatic portal or superior mesenteric vein. The graft is then reperfused with blood and any bleeding is stopped before the proximal and distal ends of the transplant bowel are connected to the original digestive tract. A loop ileostomy is then created as to provide easy access for future endoscopic observation and biopsies. A gastronomy or jejunostomy feeding tube may be placed before the abdominal wall is closed. When a liver is being transplanted in conjunction with the intestine, the recipient must first have their own liver removed. Following this, the aorta, cava, and portal veins of the donor and recipient are anastomosed. The graft is then flushed before the caval clamps are removed. The intestine is then reconstructed as in an isolated intestinal transplant, before being connected to the bile duct servicing the new liver. Multivisceral transplants are especially difficult and susceptible to complications because all organs must survive a conjoined procurement, transport, and transplantation. All three of these measures are tailored to the individual needs of the recipient. Preservation of the native spleen, pancreas, and duodenum during a multivisceral transplant can reduce the risk of additional complications related to these structures. ==Post- operative period== Following the procedure, the patient is actively monitored in an intensive care unit (ICU). Broad-spectrum antibiotics are administered, bleeding monitored, and serum pH and lactate levels measured for evidence of intestinal ischemia. The patient's immune system is strongly modulated immediately post-operation. The initial phase of treatment consists of the administration of tacrolimus with corticosteroids to suppress T-lymphocyte activation. Next, various assortments of interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor antagonists (daclizumab, basiliximab), anti-proliferation agents (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil), and the drugs cyclophosphamide and sirolimus are administered on an individual patient basis to further suppress the immune system. The bioavailability of these drugs is dependent on intestinal surface area and transit time, and therefore the length of the allograft determines the immunosuppression regimen. Intravenous administration of prostaglandin E1 is occasionally performed for the first 5 to 10 days following transplant to improve intestinal circulation and a potential dispensing of immunosuppressive effects. The gut is selectively decontaminated against high-risk flora and preventative care is taken against CMV and fungal infections. It is ideal to commence enteral nutrition as early as possible following transplantation. Therefore, a feeding tube connecting to the stomach or jejunum is quickly placed to facilitate rehabilitation. If gastrointestinal function is restored, a diet can be reestablished and cautiously advanced as tolerated. Most patients are weaned from PN within 4 weeks of transplantation, and nearly all are free from additional enteral supplementation by one year. Evidence for the restoration of function includes decreasing gastrostomy tube returns and increasing gas and enteric contents in the ileostomy. Routine surveillance endoscopy and biopsies via the ileostomy should be performed with decreasing frequency over several months to observe signs of rejection, ideally before clinical symptoms present themselves. Should the patient continue to perform well through the first post-transplant year, the ileostomy would generally be closed. Should rejection be suspected in the future, endoscopies would be performed and an appropriate antirejection therapy will be tailored. The median time for hospital discharge varies between procedures. The median times for isolated intestine, intestine-liver, and multivisceral transplants are 30, 60, and 40 days post-operation respectively. Within the first several months, carbohydrate and amino acid absorptive capacity should normalize, followed by the absorptive capacity for fats. Once enteral nutrition is capable of providing all nutritional needs, PN can be discontinued. Nearly all patients with a successful transplant are free of PN within one year. ==Biological complications== Intestinal transplantation is the least performed type of transplant due to a number of unique obstacles. The most major of these is the profound immunosuppression required due to the ability of the intestine to elicit strong immune responses. Because of exposure to a wide range of gut flora and material consumed by the body, the intestinal epithelium possesses a highly developed innate immune system and antigen-presenting abilities. Immunosuppression is the primary determinant of outcome in small bowel transplantation; the risk for graft rejection is increased by under-immunosuppression and for local and systemic infection with over-immunosuppression. Ensuring an appropriate dose of immunosuppressant can therefore be difficult, especially as both ciclosporin (14‚Äì36%) and tacrolimus (8.5‚Äì22%) have generally low bioavailabilities. A major problem due to immunosuppression in intestinal transplant patients is post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, in which B-lymphocytes excessively proliferate due to infection by EBV and result in infectious mononucleosis-like lesions. Intestinal transplant recipients are also at risk for chronic renal failure because calcineurin inhibitors are toxic to the kidneys. A transplant recipient must remain on immunosuppressants for the rest of his or her life. Intestinal transplants are highly susceptible to infection even more so than the standard immunocompromised recipient of other organs due to the great composition and variety of the gut flora. A complex assortment of microorganisms inhabits the human digestive tract, with concentrations of up to 104‚Äì107 CFU/mL in the jejunoileum and 1011‚Äì1012 CFU/mL in the colon. While suppression of the immune system may prevent immune attack on the new allograft, it may also prevent the immune system's ability to keep certain gut microbial populations in line. Despite pre and post-decontamination of the transplant, recipients are at risk of local and systemic infection by both natural and external flora. The common symptom of graft dysfunction, whether due to infection, rejection, or some other condition, is diarrhea. ==Transplant outcomes and impact== Intestinal transplant outcomes have improved significantly in recent years. Despite mild incongruities in survival rate percentages between centers in North America, Europe, Australia, and elsewhere, intestinal transplantations mostly approach survivorship rates of lung transplantation. At one-year, graft survival rates for isolated intestine currently waver around 80%, and 70% for intestine-liver and multivisceral. Over the same time period, patient survival for isolated intestine patients may even exceed 90%, while the more complicated multiorgan transplants do not show any increase in patient survival when compared to patients surviving with the intestinal graft alone. The five-year survival rate for patients and transplants ranges from 50 to 80% (overall mean 60%), depending on underlying disease and presurgical morbidity. Very young (<1 year) and very old (>60 years) patients receiving a transplant have pronounced rates of mortality. After 4 years, pediatric survival significantly worsens compared to adults. Several factors relating to superior patient and graft prognosis have proven to be statistically significant. Patients who have been admitted for transplant directly from home rather than the hospital, younger patients over one year of age, those receiving their first transplant, those receiving transplants at experienced transplant centers, and who receive antibody or sirolimus-based induction therapies have increased rates of survival. Furthermore, underlying etiology, the presence of comorbidity, the frequency of previous surgery, nutritional status, and the level of liver function have been found to affect patient-graft survival . Patients with a pre-transplant diagnosis of volvulus were found to possess a lower risk of mortality. As of 2008, the longest recorded surviving transplant survived for 18 years. Between 1999 and 2008, 131 retransplant procedures were performed in the United States. The improvement to quality of life following an intestinal transplantation is significant. Of living patients 6 months after transplant, 70% are considered to have regained full intestinal function, 15% are at partial function, and 15% have had their grafts removed. For those with full function, enteral nutritional autonomy is high. The ability to resume regular activities such as the ability to consume food and exert control over digestive function is certainly a welcome return for patients. The low quality of life induced by intestinal failure is oftentimes further supplemented by significant psychosocial disability and narcotic dependence. Following transplantation, these have been found to generally decrease. According to surveys comparing patients who have undergone transplants and those that have not, there seems to be a remarkable improvement for transplant recipients in such areas as anxiety, depression, appearance, stress, parenting, impulsiveness, optimism, medical compliance, and the quality of relationships. ==Financial considerations== Receiving an organ transplant of any kind is a highly significant investment financially, but a successful, well-functioning transplant can be very cost-efficient relative to alternate therapies. Total charges to maintain PN at home can reach upwards of $150,000 a year, even though the actual cost of nutrition is typically only $18 to $22 a day. This excludes the cost for additional home support, equipment, and the care of PN- related complications. The cost involved in undergoing intestinal transplantation, including the initial hospitalization for the transplant, can range from $150,000 to $400,000, and reoccurring hospitalizations are common up through the second year. Two to three years post-transplant, the financial cost of transplantation reaches parity with PN and is more cost-effective thereafter. ==References * Transplant Living * Partnering With Your Transplant Team by UNOS * * Intestinal Transplant for Crohn's Disease, WebMD Category:Digestive system surgery Category:Gastroenterology Category:Organ transplantation ","title":"Intestine transplantation"},{"id":"46300459","text":"Nicolaos Andreas Nicandrou is the chief executive officer of Prudential Corporation Asia, a subsidiary of Prudential plc.

It was used by the activists of Alliance \\"Maidan\\" as \\"Remember the gasdo not buy Russian goods!\\" In that form phrase was most particularly through the media. But also phrase \\"Remember the gas do not buy Russian goods\\" (without the exclamation mark) was widely used. In 2009, the option \\"Remember the gas! Do not buy Russian goods!\\" It was also used as well as other derivative forms. == Successors == In August 2013, public campaign with similar name and concept was emerged in response to export blockade of Ukraine by Russia. It also got wide publicity and distribution in Ukraine, called \\"Do not buy Russian goods!\\" Later one more campaign appeared \\"Boycott Russian Films\\". == See also == * Black Pora! * Russia‚ÄìUkraine relations == References  Sources == * –ê–∫—Ü—ñ—è ¬´–ù–µ –∫—É–ø—É–π —Ä–æ—Å—ñ–π—Å—å–∫–∏—Ö —Ç–æ–≤–∞—Ä—ñ–≤!¬ª .

AGP provides both graphic and quantitative characterizations of daily glucose patterns. First developed by Drs. Roger Mazze and David Rodbard,Mazze R, Lucido D, Langer O, Hartmann K, Rodbard, D. The Ambulatory Glucose Profile: A Representation of Verified Self-Monitored Blood Glucose Data. Diabetes Care, 1987;10(1):111-117. with colleagues at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1987, AGP was initially used for representation of episodic self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG). The first version included a glucose median and inter-quartile ranges graphed as a 24-hour day. Dr. Mazze brought the original AGP to the International Diabetes Center (IDC) in the late 1980s and since that time, IDC has built the AGP into the internationally recognized standard for glucose pattern reporting.Danne, T., Nimri, R., Battelino, T., Bergenstal, R. M., Close, K. L., DeVries, J. H., ... & Beck, R. (2017). International consensus on use of continuous glucose monitoring. Diabetes Care, 40(12), 1631-1640. Capt·ø°rAGP is a registered trademark of the International Diabetes Center. The AGP, as it is known in the diabetes community, now includes several additional sections: glucose statistics, glucose profile graph, and either daily glucose pattern calendar images or insulin dosage graphs. == Early developments == Near the end of the 1970s two revolutions were taking place that were destined to change the course of diabetes care: the move from urine testing to self- monitored blood glucose (SMBG); and a new measurement for glycosylation of hemoglobin. The former led to the widespread use of reflectance meters and accompanying glucose oxidase strips to accurately and instantly measure current glucose levels and the latter to an integrated measure of overall glycemic control. The Albert Einstein College of Medicine proved pivotal in both instances. The AGP was first proposed at the Diabetes Research and Training Center (DRTC) and developed by Mazze and associates in the first laboratory to extensively utilize computer technologies in diabetes care. In the 1970s US Congress was convinced to establish diabetes as a major health concern and to fund research through the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The DRTC program was designed to lead this effort by promoting innovate, multi-disciplinary, translational research focusing on improving diabetes care while still seeking to cure type 1 diabetes and prevent type 2 diabetes. Consequently, the DRTC was very excited about the use of SMBG in clinical decision-making. However, almost right from its introduction a potential problem was identified. Patients were expected to self-test by placing a sample of capillary blood on a strip and inserting the strip into a reflectance meter. The results of the tests (glucose values) were to be recorded in a logbook and brought to the physician. At Einstein, an NIH funded project was undertaken to use SMBG data to devise an algorithm that would determine how much insulin was required to alter blood glucose levels in type 1 diabetes. It quickly became clear that 96 patients testing 4 times a day would produce an enormous amount of data and that these data would somehow have to be copied and recorded by hand on spreadsheets. By happenstance, working with systems analysts, a memory chip was added to the reflectance meter and software was developed to capture the patient data. Using these modified meters in the study patients it was discovered that the data recorded in their logbooks were subject to three errors: over-reporting, under- reporting and imprecision. This resulted in 75% of the research patients providing erroneous glucose data thus thwarting efforts to find an algorithm.Mazze R, Shamoon H, Pasmentier R, Lucido D, Murphy J. Reliability of Blood Glucose Monitoring by Patients with Diabetes Mellitus. American Journal of Medicine, 1984;77:211-217. Following publication of these results, other investigators confirmed the findings suggesting that patient self-reported data were subject to fabrication and unless independently verified might prove dangerous in terms of clinical decision-making. Based on this mounting evidence, reflectance meter manufacturers quickly converted to memory-based meters with computer printouts. However, despite this revolution, the use of SMBG and electronic reports, although fully supported by the American Diabetes Association, never reached its potential due in part to the popularization of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as the primary basis for clinical decision- making. Nevertheless, using this rudimentary technology the first ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) was created. All data, regardless of date, was plotted by time and subjected to a smoothing algorithm to represent glucose exposure (median) and variability (inter-quartile range). Later the 10th and 90th percentile curves were added to represent outliers. The earliest AGPs characterized daytime glucose patterns as overnight SMBG was sparse. CGM of FGM data are plotted by time ignoring date and subjected to smoothing using five percentile curves: 10th, 25th, 50th (median), 75th and 90th. The top panel is a person with normal glucose metabolism. The center (50th percentile curve) dark line represents overall glucose exposure (mean 89mg/dL). The bottom panel is a person with type 1 diabetes (mean 134mg/dL). The AGP shows significant variability indicated by the darkened area on either side of the median (25th-75th percentile curves--known as inter-quartile range or IQR) is very wide when compared with the normal pattern in the top panel. The IQR represents the area in which 50% of the glucose values will fall. The lighter area on either side of the IQR represents the inter-decile range within which 80% of all values will fall (the area between 10th to 90th percentile curves). The target range, set between 70-180mg/dL, in the bottom panel shows that overnight and mid-afternoon there is a risk of hypoglycemia, while mid-day there is a risk of hyperglycemia. Additionally, while the median curve in the top panel is almost flat, in the bottom panel it oscillates, indicating unstable glucose levels. == A transition to continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) == In 1988 the technology laboratory moved to the International Diabetes Center at Park Nicollet (IDC) in Minnesota. Memory-based reflectance meters with AGP analysis were used in all clinical research projects. AGP was extensively used to characterize abnormalities in pregnancy, type 1 and type 2 diabetes.,Mazze R. Langer O. Innovative Technologies in Research and Care in Diabetes and Pregnancy. Israel J of Medical Science, 1993.Langer O, Mazze R. The Relationship Between Large-for-Gestational-Age Infants and Glycemic Control in Women With Gestational Diabetes. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 1988;159(6):1478-83.Mazze R, Langer O. Assessing Metabolic Control and Improving Patient Management: The Application of Computer Technology. Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice, October 1990. This led to a re- designation of the laboratory as: WHO Collaborating Center for Diabetes Education, Translation and Computer Technologies (a joint program of IDC and Mayo Clinic). In 2004 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was introduced. A small sensor placed under the skin for three days (by 2013 up to 14 days) would measure glucose continuously and transmit the results to a receiver, which would periodically be connected to a PC to produce reports for the health care provider. Because CGM would overcome the episodic nature of SMBG, overnight glucose values, postprandial values and glucose levels during and after activity would be instantly available to the patient and later to the physician for analysis. For most systems, the patient had to calibrate the sensor by SMBG 2-4 times per day and the physician had to off load the data into proprietary non-standardized reports. Nevertheless, with the advent of CGM it was now possible to use AGP analysis to characterize diurnal patterns.Mazze R, Strock E, Wesley D, Borgman S, Morgan B, Bergenstal R, Cuddihy R. Characterizing glucose exposure for individuals with normal glucose tolerance using continuous glucose monitoring and ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) analysis. Diabetes Technology and Therapeutics, 2008; 10(3).

Continuous Glucose Monitoring in the Subcutaneous Tissue over a 14-Day Sensor Wear Period Diabetes. Sci Technol. Sep 2013; 7(5): 1210‚Äì1219. Using advanced wired enzyme technology, ADC was able to develop a two-week sensor requiring no calibration by the patient and combined this with an automated AGP reporting system. Shown here (figure to the right) are two AGPs produced by this system: normal glucose metabolism (top panel) and type 1 diabetes (bottom panel). Produced within seconds of uploading the Libre reader, the reports are meant to provide a basis for rapid clinical decisions that are diagnostic, interventional and evaluative. The AGP collapses the two weeks of glucose data and plots only by time allowing for underlying patterns to be identified. It uses five smoothed frequency curves to represent glucose exposure, variability and stability while simultaneously identifying periods of significant hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.Bergenstal R, Ahman AJ, Recommendations for standardizing glucose reporting and analysis to optimize clinical decision making in diabetes: the Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP). Diabetes Technology and Therapeutics,2013;15(3): 198-211 == Building consensus == In February 2017, the Advanced Technology and Treatment for Diabetes Congress, an international body of scientists and clinicians interested in the application of technologies to diabetes care, convened experts from academic centers in research, clinical care and patient advocacy to form a consensus on utilization of continuous glucose monitoring in diabetes care and research. The results of the meeting were published in December 2017.Danne T, Nimri R, Battelino T et.al. International Consensus on Use of Continuous Glucose Monitoring. Diabetes Care 2017;40:1631-1640 The group, after reviewing various reports used to represent CGM data, concluded that, ‚Äú ... the AGP approach ...is recommended by this consensus group as a standard for visualization of CGM data.‚Äù In a joint statement of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes and the American Diabetes Association Petrie J, Peters A, Bergenstal R, Holl R, Fleming AG and Lutz H. Improving the Clinical Value and Utility of CGM Systems: Issues and Recommendations.

It was renumbered 1994 in the LNER's 1946 renumbering scheme, and then renumbered 61994 by British railways after the 1948 nationalisation of Britain's railways. ==Overview== The North British Railway (NBR) West Highland line to Mallaig via Fort William presented many operating problems due to its steep gradients and severe curves, combined with very restrictive axle loading limits. At grouping in 1923, passenger services were being hauled by D34 'Glen' 4-4-0s due to the axle loading restrictions. Heavier stock had already entered service, and was already resulting in some double-heading of the D34s. An early proposal was to use the new K3s to provide extra power, but they would have been restricted from the Mallaig section of the line, and was vetoed completely by the Civil Engineer after K3 bridge tests were made. Construction of the K4s began in 1937, and only 6 members of the class were built; 3442 was the second member of the class to be built. Named The Great Marquess in August 1938, after James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, 3442 was mainly used on the Glasgow to Fort William stretch of the West Highland line. The K4s handled the gradients and continuous curves with ease, but they were not designed for the 20 miles of level track near Glasgow, and the 8.5 miles stretch alongside Loch Eil. Vibration at speed was a problem on these stretches, and the middle big-end would require regular nut tightening. After nationalisation more powerful engines found their way to Fort William and 61994 was moved down to Eastfield where it was to spend most of its BR Career. In 1959, 61994 and the other four members of the K4 class were transferred to Thornton Shed for use on goods trains until October 1961 when withdrawals began. 61994 Was the last member of the class to be withdrawn in December 1961. ==Preservation== 61994 was bought from British Railways by Viscount Garnock and so began its long career in preservation. 61994 has had many mainline careers in preservation and has also been allocated to a number of heritage railways including the Severn Valley Railway, East Lancashire Railway, North Yorkshire Moors Railway and even at one point the Keighley & Worth Valley Railway, but it has also even travelled on routes she would never have gone in steam days including \\"The Settle and Carlisle line\\", Conwy Valley Line, North Wales Coast Line and even the West Coast and East Coast Main Lines. During its many mainline careers as well as returning to old haunts in Scotland on the West Highland Line it has also visited a number of places in preservation that the class would never have visited in steam days including Carlisle, Worcester, Barrow Hill, Blaenau Ffestiniog and many others. Currently owned by John Cameron who also owns LNER A4 Pacific no 60009 Union of South Africa, both engines are usually based at Thornton, but recently both have seen major action around the North West of England allocated to Crewe hauling charter trains. 61994 was stored at the North Yorkshire Moors Railway after the expiry of its boiler certificate, but departed for Bo'ness on 21 September 2017, where from December it was displayed in the Museum of Scottish Railways. It will eventually be placed in a museum in Fife, Scotland, built by and dedicated to its current owner, John Cameron, along with his other engine, LNER A4 Pacific no 60009 Union of South Africa. == Gallery == File:The Great Marquess arriving in Blaenau.jpg61994 Arriving into Blaenau Ffestiniog with \\"The Welsh Mountaineer\\" in Jul 2014 File:LNER Class K4 No 61994 The Great Marquess (8063199467).jpg61994 At Bridgnorth on the Severn Valley Railway File:Hugh llewelyn 61994 (5367689793).jpgThe K4 hauling a passenger train down the demonstration line at Barrow Hill Roundhouse ==References== * Category:Individual locomotives of Great Britain Category:Preserved London and North Eastern Railway steam locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1937 ","title":"LNER Gresley K4 61994 The Great Marquess"},{"id":"46300721","text":"David Russell Key (born March 27, 1968) is a former American football player.

Henry Miller entered the army at an early age, being gazetted as an ensign in the 40th Regiment of Foot in 1799, when only 14. He married some ten years later, and his eldest son, Henry Miller, was born on 30 December 1809 in Derry. His brother, Joseph Miller, was Mayor of Derry on five occasions. His nephew, Sir William Miller, was also mayor. ==War service== Miller was in the 40th Regiment which served under the Duke of Wellington on the Peninsula. When Wellington commenced his campaign of 1812 by taking Ciudad Rodrigo, Miller took part in the assault, in which 90 officers and 1200 men were killed. Miller then crossed the Atlantic Ocean with the 40th. He was at the unsuccessful attack on New Orleans on 8 January 1815 when the commanding officer, Sir Edward Pakenham, was killed. Miller was back again in Europe in time to be present at the Battle of Waterloo which was his final war service. He was given the Peninsular medal, with clasps for Busaco, Badajos, and Ciudad Rodrigo, and the Waterloo Medal. After Waterloo the 40th regiment formed part of the army of occupation, and Lieutenant Miller was joined by his wife and family in Paris. ==Moreton Bay penal colony== The Battle of Waterloo sealed the fate of Napoleon. As a result, Great Britain was able devote more attention to its growing colonial empire. In March 1823 the regiment was ordered to go to New South Wales. Lieutenant Miller and his family came out with one of the detachments. Sir Thomas Brisbane had decided that only married officers with families were to be sent as commandants of the out-settlements, and he formally appointed Lieutenant Henry Miller to establish the Moreton Bay penal colony on 12 September 1824. However, by that date Lieutenant Miller was already in charge at Moreton Bay, having arrived there from Sydney in the brig Amity a couple of months earlier. The Moreton Bay penal colony was initially very primitive. There were no buildings, except huts. The only link to civilisation was the occasional arrival of a ship from Sydney into Moreton Bay (for no ship in that time had ever entered the Brisbane River). It was in these surroundings that Miller's wife gave birth to a son, who was afterwards christened Charles Moreton Miller, the first European child born at Moreton Bay and the first Queenslander. Henry Miller was at Moreton Bay for about 18 months. He was then succeeded by Captain Peter Bishop, also of the 40th. ==Van Diemen's Land== Henry Miller returned to Sydney. From there he went to Van Diemen's Land. In 1828,the regiment went to India, but Captain Miller remained in Hobart in an appointment with the commissariat. He lived at Hobart in a house facing the Glebe. His oldest son, Henry, who was 15 years old when his father was at Moreton Bay, entered the Audit Office in Hobart, but left to go to the new settlement at Port Phillip where he would become a prominent citizen of the city of Melbourne. ==Later life== On 30 December 1840 his wife died at Hobart, aged 53, and on 23 August 1842 Captain Miller married again to Miss McQueen, of New Norfolk. Henry Miller died at Hobart on 10 January 1866. The second wife died in 1891 and is buried at Hobart with her son, Ernest George Miller, who died in 1887, aged 37 years. Captain Miller's grave at Hobart in course of time fell into disrepair. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ‚Äî available online Category:1785 births Category:1866 deaths Category:History of Brisbane Category:40th Regiment of Foot officers Category:Irish emigrants to Australia Category:19th-century Irish people Category:Pre-Separation Queensland Category:Moreton Bay penal settlement ","title":"Henry Miller (British Army officer)"},{"id":"46300948","text":"The voiceless retroflex approximant is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages.

It is the third-largest red diamond in the world, and the only one on public display. Sydney DeYoung (for whom the diamond is named) obtained the diamond, which was mistaken for a garnet, at a flea market. The diamond was given to the Smithsonian Institution after DeYoung's death in 1986. ==Description== The DeYoung Red Diamond is a 5.03-carat unmounted diamond. It is a deep red color, with a slight tint of brown. Red diamonds are the rarest type of colored diamonds. The diamond is a modified round brilliant cut. The facets on the diamond's crown, which resemble kites, are split in two horizontally. This feature makes the DeYoung diamond more brilliant than other diamonds with an ordinary round brilliant cut. The DeYoung Red Diamond is the third-largest red diamond, behind only the 5.05-carat Kazanjian Red Diamond (second-largest) and the 5.11-carat Moussaieff Red Diamond (largest). Its clarity grade is VS-2 (Very Slightly Included). The diamond is a Type IIa diamond, meaning that it does not have any chemical impurities. Type IIa diamonds comprise only 1‚Äì2% of all naturally occurring diamonds. ==Ownership== The DeYoung Red Diamond on display The diamond was purchased at a flea market by Sydney DeYoung (1897‚Äì1986), a Boston jewelry seller. The diamond, which was mistaken for a garnet, was on a hatpin being sold as part of an estate jewelry collection. Upon later examining the stone, however, DeYoung noted that it was of unusually high quality for its age and did not have the appearance of a garnet. He had it tested at a gem-testing laboratory, and it was discovered that the stone was actually a red diamond. After DeYoung's death in 1986, the diamond was given to the Smithsonian Institution's National Gem and Mineral Collection, a part of the National Museum of Natural History, in accordance with DeYoung's wishes. The Smithsonian received the diamond in 1987; it was mailed to the Smithsonian uninsured in an ordinary box. The diamond, which is protected by bulletproof glass in the Hall of Gems, is the only red diamond on public display; all the others are privately owned. Another diamond given by DeYoung in 1962, a 2.90-carat pear-shaped pink diamond obtained from Williamson mine in Tanzania, is displayed alongside the red diamond. ==References== Category:Red diamonds Category:Collection of the Smithsonian Institution Category:Individual diamonds ","title":"DeYoung Red Diamond"},{"id":"46300959","text":"Cheick Diallo (born September 13, 1996) is a Malian professional basketball player for the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Diallo was a five-star recruit and the MVP (Most Valuable Player) of the 2015 McDonald's All-American Boys Game. He played one season of college basketball for Kansas before declaring for the 2016 NBA draft, where he was selected with the 33rd overall pick by the Los Angeles Clippers. ==Early life== Diallo was born and raised in Kayes, Mali. It took approximately 15 hours to drive from his hometown to Bamako, the country's capital city. He was the youngest in his family and had five brothers. He often played basketball with his older friends and family which brought out his skills. Diallo moved to the United States in February 2012 in pursuit of a basketball career. He was not fluent in the English language at the time. He recalled the time, \\"It was so tough. I left my parents, my friends, my brothers, everything, just to come here.'\\" Diallo began playing basketball in 2010. ==High school career== 2015 McDonald's All-American Game Through its international program, Diallo began attending Our Savior New American School in Centereach, New York. He played with Chris Obekpa in his freshman season and, at first, was dominated by the fellow African big man. Diallo said, \\"I didn't know what I was doing. I couldn't make a point. [Obekpa] blocked me every time.\\" In later seasons, he became more effective for his team and attracted attention through his shot- blocking, rebounding, and versatility. Diallo was invited to the NBPA Top 100 camp in 2013 and went on to become its first MVP from Africa.

In his lone season at Kansas, Diallo averaged 3.0 points and 2.5 rebounds in 7.5 minutes per game. In April 2016, Diallo declared for the NBA draft, forgoing his final three years of college eligibility.

She attended Volksschule (elementary school) and Handelsschule (trade school) there. She joined the Young Communist League of Germany (KJD) in 1922, and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1925. She went to work as an assistant to Ernst Th√§lmann, the General Secretary of the KPD. In 1927 she married the graphic artist and journalist Max Keilson, who accompanied her as part of the 1928 delegation of the Central Committee of the Communist Party to the 6th World Congress of the Communist International (Comintern) in Moscow in 1928. The following year she became assistant to Georgi Dimitrov, the manager of Western European offices of Comintern, who was living in Berlin under the pseudonym of Rudolf Hediger, having fled his native Bulgaria and been sentenced to death in 1924. Working under the codename of Marianne, she helped prepare and assemble forged visas and travel documents that were produced by a counterfeiting group in the Berlin suburb of Wilmersdorf. The grave of Margarete Fuchs-Keilson in Berlin After Dimitrov was arrested on 9 March 1933 for alleged complicity in starting the Reichstag fire, for which he was later acquitted, Keilson used forged documents herself to flee to Copenhagen. She then relocated to Paris, where she worked for the Congress against Fascism and War under the codename Agnes. While there, she met the physicist Klaus Fuchs, whom she helped to escape to Britain. She then worked for the Central Committee of the KPD, coordinating KPD cells operating outside Germany under the code names Agnes, first in Prague in 1935 and 1936, and then back in Paris. She travelled to the Soviet Union under the name of Anni Grob, her Russian visa endorsed by Wilhelm Pieck and Walter Ulbricht. The German occupation of Czechoslovakia ended the mission there, and in 1939 Grete and Max sought asylum in the Soviet Union. The Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact made this a dangerous time for German communists in the Soviet Union; thousands were deported to Germany. Grete worked at the Comintern office in Moscow as an assistant to Pieck. In 1943 she became involved with the National Committee for a Free Germany (NKFD) and the League of German Officers (BDO), and visited prisoner of war camps to find recruits. Keilson returned to Germany in June 1945, where she was Head of Personnel Policy of the Central Committee of the KPD, and then, after the 1946 merger of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) with the KPD, of the new Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). From 1948 to 1953, she was the director of the Department of International Relations of the Central Committee of the SED. She was superseded by Peter Florin, and became one of his deputies. In this role, she was a member of the Foreign Affairs Commission at the SED Politburo under the direction of Ulbricht and then Heinrich Rau. In this role she was a member of the Central Committee Commission for travelling abroad, led by Secretary of State William Zaisser that approved any travel abroad by SED officials. After Klaus Fuchs was released from prison in Britain where he had been convicted on espionage charges and deported to East Germany in 1959, Keilson greeted him on arrival at Berlin Sch√∂nefeld Airport. They were married later that year. From 1959 until her retirement in 1970, she worked in the press department of the East German Ministry for Foreign Affairs. For her achievements in East Germany and her support for the SED she received numerous awards including the Patriotic Order of Merit in silver in 1955, the Banner of Labour in 1960, the Patriotic Order of Merit in gold in 1970 and the Star of People's Friendship in 1985. She died in Dresden on 4 January 1999. She was cremated and her ashes interred with those of Fuchs in the \\"Pergolenweg\\", the memorial to the socialists in the Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde in Berlin. == Notes == Category:1905 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Communist Party of Germany politicians Category:Socialist Unity Party of Germany politicians Category:East German women in politics Category:Refugees from Nazi Germany in the Soviet Union ","title":"Grete Keilson"},{"id":"46300988","text":"Coat of arms of Kursk Governorate right Kursk Governorate () was an administrative division (a guberniya) of the Russian Empire, located in European Russia.

The team's name, Barys, is derived from the national symbol of Kazakhstan, translated as snow leopard. The team's inaugural season was 1999‚Äì2000, where they played in the Kazakhstan Hockey Championship. Barys would stay there until 2009. In 2004‚Äì05, Barys was admitted into the Russian hockey system. They made their debut in the Pervaya Liga; in parallel, Barys kept a second team in the Kazakhstan Hockey Championship. Barys' debut in Russia was interesting, with the team doing fairly well. They played three seasons in the Pervaya Liga, where they finished respectively 3rd, 2nd and 1st of the Ural - Western Siberia zone where they played. With this first place in 2007, Barys was allowed into the Vysshaya Liga. Barys played a single season in the Vysshaya Liga, a good one, where they finished second out of 14 in the Eastern conference. They reached the playoffs, where they began by sweeping HC Belgorod in three straight games in the first round, before falling to Khimik Voskresensk in four games. Barys however won the Kazakhstan Hockey Championship that year. Barys' main team did not participate in the regular season of the league (however, its affiliate, Barys-2, did), but the league's format was so that the three best team of the league after the regular season would play the three best Kazakh teams (Barys' main team, Kazzinc-Torpedo and Kazakhmys Satpaev, all three were playing in the Vysshaya Liga) in the final round. Barys won the tournament, dethroning defending champions Kazzinc- Torpedo, en route to their first Kazakhstan Hockey Championship title. == 2008‚Äìpresent: Kontinental Hockey League ==  2008‚Äì2011: First round loses to Ak Bars  In 2008, Barys applied to join the newly formed Kontinental Hockey League. The league's authorities allowed Barys in, making it the first Kazakhstani team into the new league. The team won its first game in the KHL on September 3, 2008, abroad, defeating Neftekhimik Nizhnekamsk 2‚Äì1 in the shootouts. They registered their first home game eleven days later by beating defending Russian champions Salavat Yulaev Ufa 3‚Äì2, this time again in shootout. The team finished its first season with a 15th place overall in the league. Barys secured a spot in the playoffs on February 26, 2009, defeating 6-4 Vityaz Chekhov in the last day of the regular season. In the first round of Gagarin Cup playoffs, Barys faced Ak Bars Kazan. Kazan swept Astana three games to nothing to advance to the second round. Kevin Dallman finished the season as the league's fifth best scorer with 28 goals and 30 assists (58 points) record; he also finished as the league's leader for shots on goal with 217. Konstantin Glazachev finished 9th overall in the league in scoring with 52 points. Meanwhile, the team secured a second straight Kazakhstan Hockey Championship title.

Veteran Jozef St√ºmpel finished top scorer of the team, with 52 points, two better than Maxim Spiridonov, who was the best goal scorer of the team with 24. Fan favourite Kevin Dallman also was a major contributor, with 14 goals and 27 assists. Newcomer Jeff Glass did a fine job between the pipes, with 19 wins and a 2.87 goals against average, helping the team finish fourteenth overall of the KHL, a one place improvement from 2008‚Äì09. Barys was however once again swept in three games by Ak Bars Kazan in the first round of the playoffs. Barys opened 2010‚Äì11 season with Andrei Khomutov as the new head coach. However, the team's previous manager Andrei Shayanov remained in the team as an assistant coach. In September 2011, league's authorities considered Kazakhstan Sports Palace the worst in the league. The main reason was the regrettably little capacity. Later, the team's owner Kazakhstan Temir Zholy decided to build the new Barys Arena for 12,000 seats, whose opening planned to 2015‚Äì16 season. The team compiled a 20‚Äì21‚Äì4‚Äì9 regular season record with 77 points. As the 7th seed of the Eastern Conference, Barys faced Ak Bars Kazan in the first round of playoffs, again. Ak Bars won series without losing a game 4‚Äì0.  2011‚Äìpresent: BBD era  Vladimir Krikunov coached Barys during the 2012‚Äì13 season.

Barys fell in the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals to the 3rd seeded Metallurg Magnitogorsk in seven games.

Barys finished the season with a 23‚Äì18‚Äì5‚Äì6 record for 85 points. In the first round of the 2013 Gagarin Cup playoffs, Barys defeated by Traktor Chelyabinsk 3‚Äì4 in series. After the season, Krikunov decided to leave the team, because he refused to coach the Kazakhstan national ice hockey team in parallel with Barys. In the 2013 off-season, Barys appointed Ari-Pekka Selin as a new head coach. On July 4, 2013, Barys officially joined to newly created Astana Presidential Sports Club, the organization supported by Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna to combine the main sports teams in Astana. Having resigned most of their free agents, the club wouldn't much change in the 2013 off-season, with the exception of losing UFAs Vadim Krasnoslobodtsev, Vitali Novopashin and Mikhail Grigoriev. On June 19, 2013, the team signed goalie Ari Ahonen for one year. Barys strengthened defense, signing Mike Lundin, Maxim Semyonov and Evgeni Blokhin.

In the revised European NUTS nomenclature, the regions of Epirus and Western Macedonia together with the two regions of the Decentralized Administration of Macedonia and Thrace form the first level NUTS region EL5 (Voreia Ellada). ==Secretary-General== The Decentralized Administration is led by a Secretary- General () who is appointed or dismissed by a Cabinet decision upon request of the Greek Minister of Interior, and is therefore considered the senior representative of the national government in the regions. Following the electoral victory of Syriza in January 2015, the new Minister for the Interior, Nikos Voutsis, declared that the decentralized administrations would be abolished, and their powers transferred to the regions. Until this reform is formalized, and as the Secretaries-General appointed by the previous administration resigned on 2 February, the decentralized administrations are run by their senior civil servants as Acting Secretaries-General. Current Acting Secretary-General is Vasileios Michelakis.

It is an uncommon species with relatively large heads of white flowers in spring, the styles of which are significantly longer than the stamens. ==Description== Melaleuca groveana is a large shrub or tree with fibrous or papery bark which grows to a height of . Its leaves are arranged alternately on the stems, narrow elliptical in shape, long, wide tapering to a point, with a stalk long. The leaves have a distinct midvein and several lateral veins. The white flowers are grouped in spikes up to long at the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering, and sometimes in the upper leaf axils. Each spike contains 3 to 16 flowers loosely arranged and up to in diameter. The petals are and fall off as the flower matures. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower and there are 11 to 26 stamens in each bundle. Flowering occurs in early spring but the flowers are relatively short-lived. The fruit are woody, cup or barrel-shaped capsules long, in diameter and spaced along the branches.M. groveana in the Australian National Botanic GardensM. groveana Inflorescence detail ==Taxonomy and naming== Melaleuca groveana was first formally described in 1925 by Edwin Cheel and Cyril Tenison White in Proceedings of the Royal Society of Queensland. The specific epithet (groveana) honours C.H. Grove, a Queensland clergyman and the collector of the type specimen. ==Distribution and habitat== Melaleuca groveana has a fragmented distribution from the Port Stephens district in New South Wales to the Bluff district in Queensland. It grows in heath and woodland with a heathy understorey, usually in higher areas, often in exposed sites on rocky ridges and outcrops and sometimes on low hills near the coast. ==Ecology== Some coastal populations of Grove's paperbark are under threat from competition with the introduced weed bitou bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera). ==Conservation status== This species is classified as \\"vulnerable\\" in New South Wales and \\"near threatened\\" in Queensland. It is listed as \\"rare\\" in the 1997 IUCN red book of threatened plants. ==Uses== Horticulture Melaleuca groveana is a hardy species, easily propagated from seed and suitable as a screening plant. Unlike most melaleucas, after initial establishment it is relatively drought resistant plant. ==References== groveana Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Plants described in 1925 Category:Taxa named by Edwin Cheel Category:Taxa named by Cyril Tenison White ","title":"Melaleuca groveana"},{"id":"46301241","text":"TiE Silicon Valley (TiE SV) is the largest and founding chapter of the TiE brand, a non-profit organization dedicated to fostering entrepreneurship. The chapter provides technology entrepreneurs with mentoring services, networking opportunities, startup-related education, funding, and incubating. ==History== TiE SV was founded in 1992 by a group of entrepreneurs, corporate executives, and senior professionals with roots in the South Asian or Indus region and was named TiE for \\"The Indus Entrepreneurs.\\" It has since moved away from that focus and is open and inclusive. TiE SV received the 2014 Innovation Catalyst Award by VC Taskforce, which recognizes venture community leaders for being catalysts of innovation and entrepreneurship. ==Organization== TiE SV is a network of general members, Charter Members, and sponsors. Charter members are veteran entrepreneurs who assist younger entrepreneurs by offering their time, knowledge, and resources. This membership level is by invitation only. ==Programs== TiEcon TiEcon is TiE SV's flagship annual conference. Since 2008, more than 4,000 people attend the conference from over 40 countries.

He was Secretary of the Department of Health between 1984 and 1987. ==Life and career== McKay was born in 1939 or 1940. From 1972 to 1974, McKay was Assistant Director of ACT Health Services. McKay was Secretary of the New South Wales Department of Health between December 1982 and September 1984, before the Prime Minister Bob Hawke appointed him to head the Australian Government Department of Health. His Department of Health appointment lasted until July 1987, when the Department was merged with the Department of Community Services to become the Department of Community Services and Health. When the merger took place, McKay was offered an Associate Secretary position at the new Department, but McKay refused the offer. His refusal was based on a dispute over the way the new Department was to be structured. In October 1987, McKay was appointed to review Worksafe Australia, an Australian government agency tasked with improving health and safety standards in workplaces. The review was completed in 1988. It was highly critical of the organisation, stating that lack of direction, communications problems and inadequate coordination had led to an overall lack of progress in the organization's first years of operation. In 1994, McKay was involved in an independent review of transport regulation in the ACT, commissioned by the ACT Government Department of Urban Services. In 2005, McKay led a review into the operation of ambulance services in the Northern Territory. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Secretaries of the Australian Government Health Department ","title":"Bernard McKay"},{"id":"46301273","text":"Peralta in Cavalleria rusticana, 1920 Frances Peralta (19 March 1883 - 22 December 1933) was an American opera singer. ==Biography== She was born in Manchester, England, as Phyllis Partington; her father was John Herbert Evelyn Partington, a well-known painter, and her mother was Sarah Ann Partington (n√©e Mottershead). Several of her siblings were in the arts, including her sisters Blanche, a writer, and Gertrude, an artist. The family emigrated to California when she was a child. In 1911 she was appearing in a comic opera in New York's Globe Theatre when the star, Marguerite Sylva, fell ill, and Peralta (who was still using her birth name at this time) was given the opportunity to sing the lead. She apparently did well enough for the manager to alternate the two sopranos in the lead role for the remainder of the run. In 1913 she returned to Europe and studied with Salvatore Cottone and . By now she was using the name Phyllis Peralta. Arthur Nevin and Francesca Peralta in 1917 After some appearances in touring performances in the United States, Peralta (now using the name Francesca Peralta) sang Aida and Nedda in St. Louis in productions of Aida and Pagliacci. She sang briefly with the Chicago Opera Association, and in 1920 made her first appearance at the New York Metropolitan Opera as Elena in Arrigo Boito's Mefistofele, on Christmas Day, the day after Enrico Caruso's last performance there. She sang regularly at the Met until 1926, portraying such roles as Alice Ford in Falstaff, Dorabella in Cos√¨ fan tutte, Elizabeth in Don Carlo, Ginevra in 'La cena delle beffe and Mona Lisa, Giulietta in The Tales of Hoffmann, Leonora in Il trovatore and La Forza del Destino, Maddalena in Andrea Ch√©nier, Mathilde in William Tell, Santuzza in Cavalleria Rusticana, S√©lika in L'Africaine, Venus in Tannh√§user, and the title roles in Aida, La Gioconda, Franco Leoni's L'Oracolo, and Tosca among others. Peralta was diagnosed with cancer in early 1927, and only occasionally appeared at the Met thereafter. Her last stage appearance appears to have been at Bryant Park in Manhattan on 13 September 1931.

In addition, there is one airworthy Museum example; Tinker Belle (N78774) which frequently takes part in Spring through Autumn airshows and museum events. One of Everts Air Fuel (N1822M) was withdrawn from use in July 2018 after an accident, however it is currently undergoing repair. There are several stored examples in Bolivia, however none of them are currently active. One of them (CP-1655) owned by Eco Express Cargo Services, was being brought back to serviceable condition prior to 2012, and one more (CP-973) is set up for passenger configuration, however it is reportedly now up for sale. The future use of these Bolivian examples is uncertain as the C46 has not seen any use since the crash of CP-1319 (Skyteam Flight Training) in 2012. There is one additional stored example (C-GIBX) which is stored serviceable, but with the Certificate of Registration cancelled, at Gimli, Manitoba, Canada. This aircraft was tied up in receivership, however according to First Nations Transport, as of Jan 2016, the aircraft is claimed to be airworthy with two new engines and available for sale with the fire bottles and props needing updates. One last example; China Doll (N53594) was airworthy and flown by the Commemorative Air Force Museum, however it is currently grounded due to Federal Aviation Administration regulations regarding propeller time as well as having corrosion issues. She was originally scheduled to be restored back to airworthy status by 2019, however the severity of the corrosion was more extensive than first thought and the funds to bring her back to serviceable condition are not currently available.

Meisner was born in Maryfield, Saskatchewan in 1938, the youngest of the four children of William Meisner and Anna Wolowska. In the early 1950s he moved to Winnipeg, where he worked as an office boy for the United Grain Growers. He began his career in broadcasting at radio station CKDM in the 1950s in Dauphin, Manitoba. Eventually, he settled in Prince George, British Columbia, and became known as the \\"Voice of the North\\". Meisner hosted the Meisner Program on radio station CKPG for more than twenty years. He was known for his sign-off \\"and that's one man's opinion\\". After leaving radio in the fall of 2004, he launched an independent online news site, www.250News.com. In the 1990s, Meisner became a prominent opponent of the Kemano Completion Project, which he argued would damage salmon stocks in the Nechako River. In 2003, he was one of the principal organizers of a huge rally in Prince George for improvement of health care in northern British Columbia which led to the creation of the Northern Medical Program at the University of Northern British Columbia. Meisner's honours included a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Radio and TV News Directors' Association of Canada, the Queen's Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002, and Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012. In 2010, the Province of British Columbia appointed him as a non-lawyer Bencher to the Law Society of British Columbia, to represent the public's interest on the BC Law Society's Board of Governors. The Law Society of British Columbia honoured him with the distinction of the title of Lifetime Bencher status in late March 2015. While on an ice fishing trip to Manitoba in the spring of 2015, Meisner fell ill and was transferred to the Health Sciences Centre in Winnipeg. He was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, which claimed his life in the early morning of April 2, 2015. ==External links== *250 News ==References== Category:1938 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Canadian radio personalities Category:People from Prince George, British Columbia ","title":"Ben Meisner"},{"id":"46301369","text":"The 2015 Australian Swimming Championships were held from 3 to 10 April 2015 at the Sydney Olympic Park Aquatic Centre in Sydney, New South Wales.

His father was a native of St. Helena. After a good education he emigrated with Allan MacFarlane's family to South Australia on the Superb, arriving in October 1839, coincidentally with the Palmira, in which the Spence family were passengers. In 1844 Harvey went to Gawler, staying at the Old Spot inn. He drove the mail for some time, then bought land on the plains where Bassett Town later stood; he was the only landholder between Dry Creek and Gawler. He took up a run from Port Gawler to Mount Torrens, which he made available to overlanders for agistment of their cattle and acted as stock agent for some. He next started growing wheat, which proved quite lucrative until farms in Mount Barker, Lyndoch and Aldinga stepped up production and the price dropped from 9/- to 2/6d. per bushel in 1846. He built houses for settlers and the first stone building in Gawler. He opened a butcher's shop in Gawler. He purchased land and subdivided it as blocks, then in 1856 laid out a township, named for Salisbury in England, near his wife's home town. Neales was his auctioneer. He built churches and a graveyard. He also laid out the coastal village of St Kilda. He was appointed Justice of the Peace and was often called upon to act as magistrate. Although not a gambling man, he was, with his friend Seth Ferry, one of the colony's best judges of horseflesh. He was the owner of Oediputes, The Ghost and Beda, winner in 1855 of the first Adelaide St. Leger, and the dam of several champions. He was on the committee of the Gawler Jockey Club, and occasionally acted as starter and judge. He was actively involved in the various Agricultural Show societies, and regularly acted as judge of horses. He was member for Yatala in the South Australian House of Assembly from 1857 to 1860. He was involved with Robert Torrens in formulating the Real Property Act (later \\"Torrens Title\\") and active in promoting it in parliament.

He studied at the University of Edinburgh. ==Medical career in Sydney== He immigrated to Sydney in 1834. On 21 October 1837 in Sydney, he married Catherine Campbell, the youngest daughter of Captain D. McArthur, of the 2nd Royal Veteran Battalion. In December 1837, Dr Ballow was appointed Assistant Colonial Surgeon in Sydney. ==Medical career in Brisbane== Drawings of the hospital and Ballow's quarters, 1838 In March 1838, he was placed in charge of the Government Hospital in Brisbane. Ballow and his wife arrived in Brisbane as it transitioned from being a penal colony to a free settlement. He later become the Resident Surgeon of the Moreton Bay General Hospital. He was also the coroner for the Brisbane district and the visiting surgeon of the gaol. On 8 August 1850 the immigrant ship Emigrant arrived in Moreton Bay with typhus on board. The ship was quarantined at Dunwich on Stradbroke Island away from Brisbane. Forty people on the ship died, including the ship's surgeon Dr George Mitchell. Initially Dr Mallon came from Brisbane to care for the quarantined patients at Dunwich but he too contracted the infection. Dr Ballow took his place and also contracted the disease. Dr Kearsey Cannan took charge after Dr Ballow's death. He put his tent on Bird Island, visiting his patients as required from there and managed to avoid catching the disease. While Dr Mallon recovered, Dr Ballow died at Dunwich on 29 September 1850. ==Memorials== Dr Ballow was buried in the Dunwich Cemetery; the cemetery has a memorial stone for Dr Ballow and the other victims of typhus. Ballow Road at Dunwich is believed to be named after him. A white marble memorial tablet was also placed in St John's Cathedral in Brisbane.

The episode, written and storyboarded by Joe Johnston and Jeff Liu, is a non-canon crossover with Uncle Grandpa, another Cartoon Network series. While The A.V. Club described its announcement in February 2015 as \\"confusing\\", the episode aired on April 2, 2015, to high critical praise. The episode was watched by 1.926 million viewers. In the episode, Uncle Grandpa tries to help Steven master his shield ability, causing many nonsensical events along the way and making Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl see him as a threat. ==Plot== When Steven (Zach Callison) is frustrated that he is unable to summon his shield, Uncle Grandpa (Pete Browngardt) comes out from an ocean portal to help. Steven, initially confused, is assured of Uncle Grandpa's goodwill after he offers help and reminds Steven that \\"None of this is canon\\". Uncle Grandpa initially guesses that Steven has \\"belly blues\\" and tries a variety of weapons on Steven to no avail. When Garnet (Estelle), Amethyst (Michaela Dietz), and Pearl (Deedee Magno Hall) see what is going on, they come to attack Uncle Grandpa, but Steven stops them. Belly Bag (Eric Bauza) introduces Uncle Grandpa and his role as \\"everyone in the world's uncle and grandpa\\". Despite this, the Gems see him as a threat and prepare to attack. As he and Steven run from them, Uncle Grandpa summons a plot hole from Belly Bag, transporting them to Uncle Grandpa's world. In his RV, Uncle Grandpa introduces Steven to his friends Pizza Steve (Adam DeVine), Mr. Gus (Kevin Michael Richardson) and Giant Realistic Flying Tiger. Mr. Gus almost reveals the secret to Steven's shield before Pizza Steve enrages him by defacing a drawing he has made, and Steven and Uncle Grandpa are sucked into a giant Belly Bag. The Gems, meanwhile, escape from the plot hole after Garnet literally breaks the fourth wall. They arrive to see Uncle Grandpa, Steven, Lion, and Giant Realistic Flying Tiger having a tea party. Before they can attack Uncle Grandpa, Steven tries to stop them, and finally summons his shield because he cares about Uncle Grandpa, to all their amazement. Steven finds the moral in all this to not attack strangers for what they have to say or their opinions. The Gems all apologize, and Uncle Grandpa leaves on Giant Realistic Flying Tiger, reminding the viewer to \\"stay weird\\" and checking Steven off a list of other CN protagonists: Dexter and Dee Dee (Dexter's Lab), Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup (The Powerpuff Girls), Ed, Edd n Eddy, Billy and Mandy (The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy), Mac (Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends), Juniper Lee (The Life and Times of Juniper Lee), Flapjack (The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack) and Finn (Adventure Time), as well as the Hanna-Barbera-created SWAT Kats, leaving Clarence as the last one on the list. The screen at the end of the episode says \\"In loving memory of Pizza Steve\\", because Amethyst had eaten him while in the plot hole. ==Production== Cartoon Network announced \\"Say Uncle\\" in February 2015 during their upfront for that year. A crossover of Steven Universe and Uncle Grandpa, two of their programs, it is an episode of the former show. Kevin Johnson of The A.V. Club described this announcement as \\"inexplicable\\" and connecting of \\"two wildly, tonally-different shows whose only tangible connection is that they're both animated in color\\". He wrote, in conclusion, that \\"someone should check into the Cartoon Network Studios and make sure there isn't a gas leak\\". \\"Say Uncle\\" was produced as the fourth episode of the second season of the series, and was the third episode of the season to air. Chronologically, however, according to producer Ian Jones-Quartey, its events occur late in the show's first season, between the episodes \\"Shirt Club\\" and \\"Story for Steven\\"; consequently, following an \\"intended story order\\" list for the season written by Jones- Quartey, Wikipedia lists it as the 48th episode of Season 1. Joe Johnston and Jeff Liu wrote the episode, which guest stars Pete Browngardt, Eric Bauza, Adam DeVine and Kevin Michael Richardson as their respective Uncle Grandpa characters. Show writer Matt Burnett wrote on Twitter that it was 100 percent canon, but later admitted this to be an April Fools' Day joke. According to him, the episode was the idea of creator Rebecca Sugar. The special was also partially conceived as a deterrent against the often verbally abusive comments that Uncle Grandpa received after its premiere, which negatively impacted on the confidence of many of the show's crewmembers. ==Broadcast and reception== The episode aired on April 2, 2015 and was watched by 1.926 million viewers. Cartoon Network promoted it with the launch of Attack the Light!, a Steven Universe mobile game. The episode received critical acclaim. Sharing a clip of the show on The A.V. Club, Eric Thurm wrote that its announcement caused confusion among fans, \\"not least because the deeply surreal and ridiculously over-the-top Uncle Grandpa is much weirder than Steven Universe\\". In spite of this, he graded the episode an A, describing the simple plot as all it needs to introduce Uncle Grandpa to the show. He wrote that this introduction allows the show to break the fourth wall and play around with different styles of animation. ==References * Category:2015 American television episodes Category:Crossover animation Category:Crossover television Category:Steven Universe episodes Category:Uncle Grandpa ","title":"Say Uncle (Steven Universe)"},{"id":"46301671","text":"W/ Bob & David is a comedy sketch show created by and starring Bob Odenkirk and David Cross that premiered on Netflix on November 13, 2015.

In 1983, professor of Chicano/Latino Studies Dr. Alejandro Morales reviewed and analyzed the literature of three of Trevi√±o's major 1970s works, stating about Ra√≠ces de sangre that it is \\"an antidote to Hollywood productions such as Boulevard Nights and Walk Proud, which focus on stereotypical images of Chicano gangs\\". He criticizes the film noting that, \\"[T]he film projects...a confusing vision of life on the Mexican- United States border.\\" Morales further notes the symbolism of the fence dividing the border, and the Chicanos and the Mexicans, at the end of the film and observes that \\"...the criminals go unpunished and not even an educated Harvard lawyer will change the exploitative conditions that exist on the border.\\" In 1991, Ra√≠ces de sangre was included in an anthology of the 25 Most Significant Films of Latin American Cinema at the 36th Annual International Film Festival in Valladolid, Spain.

Over a career spanning more than six decades, Joralemon was involved in the discovery and development of numerous major copper and gold deposits, many of which went on to become operational mines. In addition to his professional career within the minerals industry, he was also a popular science author and historian of the mining industry. ==Biography== Ira B. Joralemon graduated from Harvard University with an A.B. (magna cum laude) in Mining and Metallurgy in 1905, and received an A.M. degree in the same subject from the same institution in 1907. After graduation he took a job as a mining engineer with the Calumet & Arizona Mining Company, working on their copper mining properties near Bisbee, Arizona. Following the appointment of new C&A; Company General Manager John C. Greenway in 1911, it was Joralemon's assessment of copper mineralization found near Ajo, Arizona, that persuaded Greenway the C&A; Company should purchase a controlling interest in the fledgeling New Cornelia Copper Company who were developing the property, which would eventually become the New Cornelia mine. Joralemon played a key part in the development of the New Cornelia mine, the first large open-pit copper mine in the state, and was instrumental in adopting a high-risk exploration strategy which successfully located what became the United Verde Extension mine near Jerome, Arizona. He rose through the ranks of the C&A; Company to become first Chief Geologist and then Assistant General Manager in 1917 and 1919, respectively. His work with the C&A; Company was interrupted by World War I, during which Joralemon served with the United States Army Air Service between 1917 and 1919. For part of this time Major Joralemon was a member of General Billy Mitchell's staff, and was commended by Mitchell for his \\"wonderful work\\" during preparations for the Battle of Saint-Mihiel. For his service to France the French government awarded him the distinction of Chevalier of the Legion d'Honneur in 1918. After his return from Europe, Joralemon continued in his work with the C&A; Company in Arizona, as well as acting on behalf of the Anaconda Copper Mining Company, assessing properties for them in Siberia and South America. However, in 1922 Joralemon resigned from the C&A; Company to set up his own consultancy, although he did maintain close links to the C&A; and to Phelps Dodge, who merged with C&A; in 1931, for the rest of his career. Basing himself in San Francisco, Joralemon's consulting work involved him in numerous ore deposit discoveries and development work over the following 50 years, many of which went on to become profitable mines, including: Potrerillos copper mine, Chile; Ahumada lead mine, Mexico; Central Eureka gold mine, California; Consolidated Copper mine, Nevada; Yellow Pine tungsten mine, Idaho; and Bralorne gold mine, British Columbia. He also acted as an executive board member for many mining companies and published numerous technical reports and scientific manuscripts during this period. During World War II, Joralemon served on the War Production Board as a strategic minerals specialist, ensuring adequate supplies of raw materials for the USA and her allies during the conflict. In civilian life, he served as Vice President (1950) and President (1951) of the Society of Economic Geologists, as well as acting as director of both The American Institute of Mining Engineers and the Mining and Metallurgical Society of America. Away from his active involvement in the mining industry, in 1934 Joralemon published the book Romantic Copper: Its Lure and Lore, a popular science study of the history of copper mining and its use by humans. This work has been described as \\"definitive\\" by the National Mining Hall of Fame & Museum. Following his retirement, Joralemon updated the text and expanded it to include many aspects of more modern mining operations, and this was published as Copper: The Encompassing Story of Mankind's First Metal in 1973. Ira Joralemon's autobiography, Adventure Beacons (edited by his son, Peter Joralemon), was published posthumously in 1976. ==Selected bibliography== *Joralemon, Ira B.

Ashford George M. Ashford (January 2, 1868‚Äì?) was a US civil engineer and surveyor. He was one of the pioneers of Northern Alaska. He was the first man of his profession to arrive in Nome. ==Early years== Ashford was born near Lisbon, Ohio, January 2, 1868. When he was eight years old, his family moved to Iowa, and he was educated in the public schools of that state, and was subsequently graduated from the Iowa State College in the class of 1892 with the degree of Bachelors in Civil Engineering. ==Career== His first work as an engineer was with the Carnegie Steel Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. For a period of three or four years, he was an engineer for the Pittsburgh Bridge Company, engaged in the drafting and construction department. He was sent to North Carolina as an engineer in connection with the construction of George W. Vanderbilt's mansion at Biltmore. Ashford was one of the unfortunate stampeders to the Kotzebue Sound area in 1898. At the time of the excitement caused by the report of the discovery of gold in this region, he and 27 others bought a schooner, in which they made the trip to the Arctic country. Ashford spent the winter of 1898 and 1899 on the Kobuk River, a short distance below Squirrel River. In the spring of 1899, the news of the Anvil strike having previously reached the Arctic slope, he started over the ice with two companions for Nome. They hauled their sleds and accomplished the long and arduous journey in a month's time. They left the Kobuk and started across Kotzebue Sound on May 1. This season was unusually late, and while crossing the ice of Kotzebue Sound they encountered extremely severe weather. On the third day out Dr. De France, one of their traveling companions, became exhausted and froze to death. They were ten days on the ice before they reached Cape Espenberg. After reaching the coast of the Bering Sea and crossing Port Clarence Bay, the season was pretty well advanced, it being the latter part of May, and the ice over the sea in many places was rotten and unsafe. At a place above Sinuk River two men, who were traveling with a dog team and following Ashford's party, narrowly escaped being drowned. The dog team, sledge and all of their supplies were lost by the breaking of the ice. Ashford said that when he arrived within 40 miles of Nome, he saw evidence of the \\"pencil and hatchet\\" miners. At this early date, the beach for this distance west of Nome was staked. He arrived at Nome May 31 and found a bustling, thriving mining camp. His most serious regret was that he did not have his surveying transit with him, as there was a pressing demand for the services of a surveyor and much work that he could have done if he had had his instruments. During the early part of this season, Ashford became associated with J. M. Davidson, and they did the first work of surveying and engineering that was ever done on Seward Peninsula. Ashford was one of the engineers of the Miocene Ditch Company, and was later connected with most of the important ditch enterprises of this region. ==References== * Category:1868 births Category:American civil engineers Category:American surveyors Category:People of pre-statehood Alaska Category:People from Lisbon, Ohio Category:People from Nome, Alaska Category:Year of death missing Category:Engineers from Ohio ","title":"George M.

Brown was elected to her third legislative term in the general election held on November 6, 2018. With 6,337 votes (53.9 percent), she defeated Democrat Jonathan Crossley, who polled 5,418 votes (46.1 percent). ==Background== Brown is a native of Cape Girardeau in southeastern Missouri. At the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, she majored in technical writing and received both Bachelor and Master of Arts degrees. She is a member of the Lutheran Church. She is married to Lawrence Brown and has a son, William C. Peterson (born c. 1974), from a previous marriage. One of her avocations is gardening. ==Political life== A former justice of the peace for District 12 in Pulaski County, Brown in 2014 won the District 41 House seat vacated by the term-limited Democrat Jim Nickels, an attorney from Sherwood. Brown vowed if elected to take her \\"conservative approach to the state capitol.\\" In the May 20 Republican primary, Brown defeated her intra-party rival, Alan Lewis Pogue (born c. 1957), also of Sherwood, 1,285 votes (58 percent) to 931 (42 percent). In 2012, Pogue had narrowly lost, with 6,192 votes (48 percent), the general election as the Republican nominee against Jim Nickels, who polled 6,700 votes (52 percent).

Brown is assigned to these House committees: (1) Public Transportation, (2) Aging, Children & Youth, Legislative and Military Affairs, and (3) Insurance and Commerce. In February 2015, Brown joined dozens of her fellow Republicans and two Democrats in co-sponsoring legislation submitted by Representative Lane Jean of Magnolia, to reduce unemployment compensation benefits. The measure was promptly signed into law by Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson. That same month, Brown was co-sponsor of House Bill 1228, authored by Republican Bob Ballinger of Carroll County in northwestern Arkansas. The measure sought to prohibit government from imposing a burden on the free exercise of religion. Brown's colleague, Representative Camille Bennett, a Democrat from Lonoke, called for a reworking of the legislation on the theory that the bill would establish a \\"type of religious litmus test\\" which could impact nearly any law under consideration by the legislature. The legislation was subsequently passed by a large margin in the House and signed into law in revised form, SB 975, by Governor Hutchinson. ==References== Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:People from Cape Girardeau, Missouri Category:People from Sherwood, Arkansas Category:University of Arkansas at Little Rock alumni Category:Members of the Arkansas House of Representatives Category:Women state legislators in Arkansas Category:American justices of the peace Category:Technical writers Category:Arkansas Republicans Category:American Lutherans Category:Writers from Arkansas Category:21st- century American politicians Category:21st-century American women politicians ","title":"Karilyn Brown"},{"id":"46302031","text":"Dr Frank \\"Doc\\" McCallum (26 May 189025 September 1946) was a senior Australian public servant and medical practitioner, best known for his time as Director- General of the Department of Health. ==Life and career== McCallum was born in Ararat, Victoria on 26 May 1890.

The show is based on an idea by Stephen Merchant and John Krasinski, in which celebrities battle each other with lip sync performances. The idea was first a recurring segment on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon before being developed into a separate show. The premiere episode was the highest-rated premiere in Spike's history. Lip Sync Battle has been a hit show for the network. The series' success has led to the creation of various international adaptations. In August 2018, the show was renewed for a fifth season, which premiered on January 17, 2019. On September 22, 2020, it was announced that the series would move to another ViacomCBS network, as part of the Paramount Network's upcoming shift to movies. == Overview == Lip Sync Battle debuted on the American cable network Spike, on Thursday April 2, 2015. It is produced by John Krasinski and Stephen Merchant and hosted by rapper and actor LL Cool J. Model Chrissy Teigen serves as color commentator. The show is a spin-off of a bit first introduced on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. Merchant, Krasinski and Krasinski's wife, Emily Blunt, were brainstorming ideas for Krasinski's upcoming appearance on Late Night when the idea took shape. Jimmy Fallon then developed it into a recurring segment on his show, the game pits two celebrities against each other in a lip syncing battle for two rounds with the crowd determining the winner of the battle after both rounds have been completed. The winner is presented with a Lip Sync Battle belt reminiscent of the WCW Television Championship title belt. In 2014, Merchant, Krasinski and Fallon pitched the show to NBC. The network passed on the show because NBC felt that the pitch lacked sufficient development to merit a separate show. NBC's cable channels USA Network and Bravo also passed. The competition series was eventually picked up by Spike cable channel, which was in the process of rebranding. \\"Part of what I wanted to do with Lip Sync Battle is increase co- viewing, but also add diversity to the network,\\" said Kevin Kay, the president of the network. Lip Sync Battle has been a major success for Spike. With 2.2 million viewers, its series premiere was the highest-rated non-scripted premiere in Spike's history. Kay described the show as \\"a television and viral rock star for Spike.\\" The show was renewed for a second season on April 22, 2015, with the network ordering 20 new episodes. The show continued to deliver high ratings. In January 2016, the network renewed the series for a third season consisting of another 20 episodes. \\"Lip Sync Battle is a multiplatform pop-culture phenomenon that has played an integral role in delivering a new and broader audience to Spike,\\" said Kevin Kay, the president of the network. In July 2016, the show received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination in the Outstanding Structured Reality Program category. In 2017, it was announced that the show would air a live hour-long special (Lip Sync Battle Live: A Michael Jackson Celebration) on January 18, 2018, in honor of the relaunch of Spike as Paramount Network. Neil Patrick Harris, Taraji P. Henson and Hailee Steinfeld were announced as the first set of performers in January 2018 for the Michael Jackson-themed special, which originated from the Dolby Theatre and also included a presentation from Cirque du Soleil's Las Vegas residency Michael Jackson: One. On August 22, 2018, the show was renewed for a fifth season consisting of 12 episodes that premiered on January 17, 2019. == Episodes  Reception==  Critical response  Josef Adalian writing for Vulture noted the show's success by saying that Lip Sync Battle is \\"looking like a legitimate hit, both on TV and online.\\" He also added that the show's creators \\"opted not to impose artificial demographic targets. They also went out of their way not to futz up the very simple premise that worked so well on Fallon‚Äôs late-night shows.\\" Amy Amatangelo of The Hollywood Reporter said that the debut of the show \\"had moments of great fun,\\" although she added that the series \\"still seems like it is better suited as an interlude on The Tonight Show,\\" and that \\"some things are better in small doses.\\" Adelle Platon of Vibe wrote that the show \\"is a welcome break from other singing shows crowding primetime,\\" also adding that \\"with the in-house crowd serving as judges, the spirit of competition between both parties make it a fun-for-all\\". Emily Yahr from The Washington Post was more negative towards the show by saying that \\"taking out all the spontaneity and replacing it with the cheesy-slick production values of an American Idol group medley, Lip Sync Battle will probably wear out its welcome soon.\\"  Ratings  The series premiere of Lip Sync Battle delivered 2.2 million total viewers via Nielsen ratings, including a 1.3 rating in the 18-49 demographic which is the most important to advertisers. The episode notched the largest viewership for an unscripted series debut in the network's history and the largest average audience in the slot in more than eight years. The total audience for the first several episodes of the show, including DVR replays and multiple reruns, has climbed past 15 million television viewers. Spike has also stated that various performance clips from the first three half-hour episodes of the show had already generated nearly 100 million online streams, as of April 2015. In Australia, the series premiere scored 1.124 million viewers in preliminary overnight viewers, making it the fourth most-watched program on free-to-air television for the evening. The second episode the following week scored 1.087 million preliminary overnight viewers and ranked the fifth-highest-rated program on free-to-air television of the night. This success has led to suggestions by commentators that a local adaption could be imminent. ==International versions== {  - ! Country !! Title !! Network !! Host !!

He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly and a Member of the Queensland Legislative Council. ==Early life== Alfred John Stephenson was born on 15 November 1845 at Pimlico, London, England, the son of John Stephenson and his wife Martha. He attended a Birkbeck school and then a private academy. At age 15, he left England and came to Ipswich, Queensland. ==Career== Stephenson was apprenticed as printer on the North Australian newspaper published in Ipswich. In 1877 he became one of the proprietors of the Queensland Times. He served on various boards, trusts and committees including: * Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company * Ipswich and West Moreton Building Society * Ipswich General Hospital * Ipswich Girls Grammar School * Ipswich Technical College ==Politics== On 7 March 1894, John MacFarlane, one of the two Ministerialist members for Ipswich, died. Alfred Stephenson contested the resulting by-election on 31 March 1894 as a Ministerialist, but Australian Labour Party candidate James Wilkinson won. Alfred John Stephenson was elected in the electoral district of Ipswich on 21 March 1896 (the 1896 election) and served until 11 March 1902 when he was defeated in the 1902 election by lawyer James Blair.

It has the only harbor and safe anchorage for large vessels in Seward Peninsula. The bay is located 25 miles southeast of York. It is a large body of comparatively deep water, nearly circular in outline, and cut off from the sea by a long, low sand spit, which terminates in Point Spencer at the entrance to the bay. Along the north side of Port Clarence Bay, there is a shallow lagoon, separated from the bay by a narrow sand spit. This lagoon extends several miles west of the entrance to Port Clarence. The hamlet of Port Clarence, Alaska is situated on the bay. ==Geography== The harbor at Port Clarence Bay, close to the strait, is free from ocean swell, and was the rendezvous for the Arctic whaling fleet. The bay itself is clear of ice about June 25 to 30. There were three native settlements on the northeast side of the bay, and the dwellers assembled on Point Spencer in the early part of July for trade with the whaling vessels. The bay is formed by a sand spit which extends from the mainland west and then north, terminating in Point Spencer. The end of the point is quite bold-to and can be approached as close as 1 mile, with depth of 7 fathoms. The channel between Point Spencer and Point Jackson, on the north shore, is about 4 miles wide, clear of danger, and carries from 7 to 9 fathoms. One and one-half miles south of Point Spencer a shoal makes into the bay from the sand spit, having depths of 2.5 fathoms 1 mile off. The northern half of the bay has a general depth of 7 fathoms as close as 1 mile from the shore; the southern half of the bay shoals gradually from this depth toward the shore, and the extreme southern part is very shoal. The north shore is clear of danger, and can be approached as close as i mile, the soundings decreasing regularly to the beach. Port Clarence connects at its northeast end with Grantley Harbor, which is 3 to 4 miles wide, about 12 miles long, and connects at its eastern end by a narrow, difficult channel with a large lake farther inland. The mouth of the harbor is formed by two sand spits which slightly overlap. The water westward of the sand spits is shoal, but there is a channel close to the north one which can be used by vessels drawing 12 feet or less, but which should be sounded out before attempting to enter. Inside the harbor, the depths range from 2¬£ to 3 fathoms, and it is probable that a draft of 12 feet can be taken through the channel to the lake. Vessels have gone into Grantley Harbor to heave down and repair on the north sand spit. Fresh water can be obtained in several places in Port Clarence, the best being from a stream on the east side south of Cape Riley and bearing east-southeast from Point Spencer. The anchorage used by the whaling fleet is in 5 fathoms, just inside Point Spencer. In this vicinity, fog is quite prevalent and very dense in summer. Southwesterly winds increase and northeasterly winds decrease the height of tide. Outside of Point Spencer the current sets northwestward with a velocity of 1 to 2 knots. A shoal having a least reported depth of 1.5 fathoms lies nearly 5 miles offshore and about halfway between Cape Douglass and Point Spencer, and vessels should keep well outside of it. Extending about west- northwest from this shoal toward Cape York is a ridge having hard bottom and depths ranging from 4 fathoms near its southeastern end to 5 fathoms in about the latitude of Point Spencer. This ridge extends nearly to the north shore. ==References== * * Category:Bodies of water of Nome Census Area, Alaska Category:Bays of Alaska Category:Bodies of water of the Seward Peninsula ","title":"Port Clarence Bay"},{"id":"46302246","text":"John Howard Lidgett Cumpston (19 June 18909 October 1954) was a senior Australian public servant, and first Director-General of the Department of Health. ==Life and career== John Cumpston was born in South Yarra, Melbourne on 19 June 1880, to parents Elizabeth Cumpston (n√©e Newman) and George William Cumpston.

It is classified as a basidiomycete because of its beak-shaped processes (Clamp connections). It does not form basidia and only forms sclerotia (hyphal masses) when cultured. In these respects, BDM-X is distinguished from other basidiomycetes. BDM-X is cultured and consumed as an edible mushroom. The mushroom, Basidiomycetes-X (BDM-X), echigoshirayukidake was identified as Ceraceomyces tessulatus, a member of the family Amylocorticiaceae based on the molecular analysis of ITS region and D1/D2 regions of rDNA. Sequence similarity between the mushroom and Ceraceomyces tessulatus voucher KHL16429, Herb. O (ACCESSION KU518951) was 99% in ITS1 region and 99% in 26 or 28S rDNA D1/D2 regions respectively. ==Description== Basidiomycetes-X can be cultured by an ordinary method. A cultured strain or the seed of BDM-X can be aseptically inoculated into agar, liquid, or sawdust media with suitable nutrients, and is cultured under appropriate temperature conditions. The optimum growth conditions are at pH 5.0 to 6.0 and at 22 to 26‚ÑÉ. BDM-X forms hyphal masses in light pink colonies crowded with hyphae on the media. These sometimes grow concentrically from the site of inoculation. If a group of hyphal masses is formed within the medium, they are interconnected by mycelial strands to form a large hyphal mass. As the shape of BDM-X depends on the environment in which it is cultured, the large hyphal masses of BDM-X for industry use can be formed, for example, on a sawdust medium (10 cm√ó10 cm√ó20 cm) after one year cultivation. ==Gallery== File:Basidiomycetesx-4.jpgHyphae of Basidiomycetes-X on an agar medium (upper, screw cap bottle; lower, test tube) File:Basidiomycetesx-2.jpgA large hyphal mass of BDM-X on a sawdust medium (10cm√ó10cm√ó20cm) ==References== * Category:Amylocorticiales Category:Edible fungi Category:Medicinal fungi Category:Fungi of Japan ","title":"Echigoshirayukidake (Basidiomycetes-X)"},{"id":"46302278","text":"Cricket Coaching School was a Bangladeshi cricket team that played List A cricket in the Dhaka Premier League in 2013-14 and 2015-16.

The fish exhibits sexual dimorphism, and its appearance varies depending on gender. The male sucker has a narrow red lateral band on it and a long dorsal and ventral fin. The female sucker has a narrow brown lateral band on it, and a shorter dorsal and ventral fin. ==Habitat== The habitat of the sucker extends from Northern Virginia to Eastern West Virginia. It is generally found in the James River and its discharges, although populations also exist in the Potomac River and its discharges. The fish is generally found in creeks and small rivers. It prefers clear waters with a rocky gradient and can live in waters with temperatures ranging from warm to cold. Younger Thoburnia rhothoeca can generally be found in smaller pools. ==Behavior== Thoburnia rhothoeca reach sexual maturity after one to two years of life. The sucker reproduces through spawning, which generally occurs from February to May. Female suckers lay an average of approximately 780 oocytes during spawning season with an average diameter of approximately two millimeters. The sucker is primarily a carnivore. Most of its diet consists of Chironomidae, although it will consume many other of species of insects when they are available. The sucker will also consume detritus. ==Conservation status== The sucker is ranked as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

The term semiotics derives from the Greek root seme, as in semeiotikos (an 'interpreter of signs').Berger, Arthur Asa. 2012. Media Analysis Techniques. Beverly Hills: Sage Publications. It was not until the early part of the 20th century, however, that Saussure and American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce brought the term into more common use. While both Saussure and Peirce contributed greatly to the concept of signs, it is important to note that each differed in their approach to the study. It was Saussure who created the terms signifier and signified in order to break down what a sign was. He diverged from the previous studies on language as he focused on the present in relation the act of communication, rather than the history and development of words and language over time. Succeeding these founders were numerous philosophers and linguists who defined themselves as semioticians. These semioticians have each brought their own concerns to the study of signs. Umberto Eco (1976), a distinguished Italian semiotician, came to the conclusion that \\"if signs can be used to tell the truth, they can also be used to lie.\\" Postmodernist social theorist Jean Baudrillard spoke of hyperreality, referring to a copy becoming more real than reality. In other words, how the signified becomes more important than the signifier. French semiotician Roland Barthes used signs to explain the concept of connotation‚Äîcultural meanings attached to words‚Äîand denotation‚Äîliteral or explicit meanings of words. Without Saussure's breakdown of signs into signified and signifier, however, these semioticians would not have had anything to base their concepts on. ==Relation between signifier and signified== Saussure, in his 1916 Course in General Linguistics, divides the sign into two distinct components: the signifier ('sound-image') and the signified ('concept'). For Saussure, the signified and signifier are purely psychological: they are form rather than substance.Berger, Arthur Asa. 2013. \\"Semiotics and Society.\\" Soc 51(1):22‚Äì26. Today, following Louis Hjelmslev, the signifier is interpreted as the material form, i.e. something which can be seen, heard, touched, smelled or tasted; and the signified as the mental concept.Chandler, Daniel. 2017. Semiotics: The Basics. New York: Routledge. In other words, \\"contemporary commentators tend to describe the signifier as the form that the sign takes and the signified as the concept to which it refers.\\"Chandler, 2002, p.18. The relationship between the signifier and signified is an arbitrary relationship: \\"there is no logical connection\\" between them. This differs from a symbol, which is \\"never wholly arbitrary.\\" The idea that both the signifier and the signified are inseparable is explained by Saussure's diagram, which shows how both components coincide to create the sign. In order to understand how the signifier and signified relate to each other, one must be able to interpret signs. \\"The only reason that the signifier does entail the signified is because there is a conventional relationship at play.\\" That is, a sign can only be understood when the relationship between the two components that make up the sign are agreed upon. Saussure argued that the meaning of a sign \\"depends on its relation to other words within the system;\\" for example, to understand an individual word such as \\"tree,\\" one must also understand the word \\"bush\\" and how the two relate to each other.Chandler, 2002, p.18. It is this difference from other signs that allows the possibility of a speech community.Cobley, Paul, and Litza Jansz. 1997. Introducing Semiotics, Maryland: National Bookworm Inc. However, we need to remember that signifiers and their significance change all the time, becoming \\"dated.\\" It is in this way that we are all \\"practicing semioticians who pay a great deal of attention to signs ‚Ä¶ even though we may never have heard them before.\\" Moreover, while words are the most familiar form signs take, they stand for many things within life, such as advertisement, objects, body language, music, and so on. Therefore, the use of signs, and the two components that make up a sign, can be and are‚Äîwhether consciously or not‚Äîapplied to everyday life. ==References== Sources *Ferdinand de Saussure (1959).

The earthquake had a moment magnitude of 7.1, a local magnitude of 6.7, a surface wave magnitude of 7.4 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of X (Very Destructive). It occurred at a depth of , being extremely shallow for an earthquake of its size. It resulted in the deaths of three people, with a further 14 people injured, making it the fifth deadliest earthquake in New Zealand's recorded history (tied with the 1848 Marlborough earthquake). Numerous aftershocks followed the quake, including 15 that were magnitude 5 or greater and occurred within a month. ==Tectonic setting== New Zealand lies along the boundary between the Indo-Australian and Pacific Plates. In the South Island most of the relative displacement between these plates is taken up along a single dextral (right lateral) strike-slip fault with a major reverse component, the Alpine Fault. The 1968 Inangahua earthquake occurred along the Northern section of the Alpine Fault, and was considered quite average for what the fault can produce. ==Damage== Inangahua Junction bridge after the 1968 earthquake. Damage inside Inangahua house after the earthquake. The earthquake ruined many years of expensive work improving in the Inangahua and Buller Gorge areas. In a section of , the road through Buller Gorge was blocked in more than 50 places, either buried under landslides or where the road itself had collapsed into the gorge. The earthquake also damaged or destroyed more than 50 bridges. It also derailed two goods trains, and over of damaged railway track had to be replaced. All roads in and out of Inangahua were blocked by landslides. The electricity and phone networks were out, and many water pipes in Inangahua were damaged beyond repair. Other West Coast towns were heavily shaken; more than two-thirds of the chimneys in Greymouth, Westport, and Reefton were damaged. Casualties At Whitecliffs, a limestone bluff collapsed onto a farmhouse and pushed it downhill, killing one woman instantly and fatally injuring her visiting mother. Shortly after the earthquake, one man died near Greymouth when his car hit a subsided section of road on the run-up to a bridge. An additional three men were killed later when a rescue helicopter they were piloting crashed. Landslides The earthquake and its many aftershocks triggered numerous landslides in the surrounding mountains. A huge landslide dammed the Buller River upstream of Inangahua. The rising water backed up for , raising the river to 30 metres above its normal level. If the landslide dam had burst, the river would have flooded not only Inangahua, but the much larger town of Westport, located downstream at the river mouth. As a precaution, about 10,000 people were evacuated. The dammed river eventually overflowed the landslide debris and gradually eroded it down, without causing serious flooding. ==Response== Shortly after the earthquake, a relief centre was set up in the Ministry of Works yard in Inangahua. People gathering there were concerned to hear that radio broadcasts only mentioned minor earthquake activity‚Äîthe rest of New Zealand seemed unaware of what had happened to their town. The people of Inangahua remained alone in the disaster for several hours, until a driver managed to contact Gisborne on his truck radio. By noon, commercial and air force helicopters were coming into the area with aid and to survey damage. Help was also needed in isolated areas. Four people, including a constable and a doctor carrying a pack of medical supplies, walked to Inangahua Junction. There the doctor treated most patients outdoors because aftershocks were still jolting the area. Meanwhile, one group of about 50 people started walking from Inangahua towards Reefton, a walk of roughly 7 hours. The group of 50 made it safely to Reefton. RNZAF UH-1 helicopters and commercial helicopters began flying people to Rotokohu, where they could board buses to Reefton, and RNZAF UH-1 helicopters checked all outlying farmhouses. In all, 235 people were airlifted out of Inangahua. ==Aftermath== Inangahua never fully recovered. Many of the town's residents never went back to their homes, either staying in nearby towns such as Reefton, or deciding to move out of the area entirely. Damaged and collapsed buildings took months‚Äîin some cases, years‚Äîto be fully restored. The railway line was, however, fully restored, as it forms a key part of the Stillwater‚ÄìWestport Line. After the earthquake, the area declined. People moved because they feared aftershocks. Employment decreased and school rolls dropped. Shops had fewer customers and more and more ‚ÄòHelp Wanted' signs were seen in windows. The area later experienced an economic downfall. The quake had a strong effect on the local people. Children were upset and unsettled by the dramatic change in their lives. Many had to move to Reefton School for a period after the quake as the Inangahua School was damaged beyond repair. One school teacher reportedly got her students to draw pictures of their experience. One boy drew a broken house with rain falling on it. A caption read ‚ÄòAfter the earthquake it rained'. Rainfall made the recovery and rescue efforts of the town much more complicated. Many families in the area were left with nothing. They were given supplies by social services such as Red Cross, and in some cases came out of it much better off than when they went in. ==See also== *List of earthquakes in 1968 *List of earthquakes in New Zealand ==References * *Experiencing the 1968 Inangahua Earthquake ‚Äì GNS Science * Inangahua Category:Earthquakes in New Zealand Inangahua Category:History of the West Coast, New Zealand Category:History of the Tasman District ","title":"1968 Inangahua earthquake"},{"id":"46302681","text":"Scuola Italiana di Montevideo (SIM) is an Italian international school in Carrasco, Montevideo, Uruguay.\\"Acerca de.\\" Scuola Italiana di Montevideo.

The mill-pond is situated northeast of Echo Bay, between the Premium Point peninsula and the mainland. It is fed by the Premium River and is separated from Echo Bay by a dam that creates a waterfall into the harbor. ==Premium Mill== This mill was located on the border of New Rochelle and the Town of Mamaroneck on the Premium Point peninsula. It was the successor of a much older mill that had been located farther up the creek in the Town of Mamaroneck at Pryer's Bridge. The old mill on this creek originated, it would seem, with the Palmer family, probably Sylvanus Palmer, who died in 1742. His son, John Palmer, was the next owner, and he was followed by Gilbert Willett and then by Samuel Underhill. The latter sold it in 1776 to his brother-in-law, James Mott. The Palmers, Underhills, and Motts were Quakers. James Mott continued to reside at and operate the old mill for over forty years, his home being the Pryer house, which he built, an older house having been burned. The Premium Mill was erected in 1801 by James Mott and his sons, who managed the mill business, and it was brought about by the need of greater facilities for handling the increasing business due to large exportation of flour to Europe following the French Revolution. The new mill was placed half a mile lower down near the mouth of the bay, whose tide provided the water power and gave much larger storage of water than the dam above at the old mill. The Premium Mill was very large with ten run of stones which was later increased to twelve and every known improvement was introduced. It was said to have been the largest flour-mill in the country at that period.The New York Times: Westchester Guide; 1986 The wars between Napoleon and England in 1806 and 1807, and the embargoes and blockades placed on the ports, were disastrous to the Mott family business, and, following this, came The War of 1812 with even more disastrous results. After the close of the latter war, the property passed from the Motts to Isaac W. Coles and William F. Coles. Although the mill itself was at the Mamaroneck end of the mill-dam, the dam itself connected with the New Rochelle shore and the miller's house was at the New Rochelle end. However, access to and from the mill was over the old mill-dam at Pryer's to a land bridge connection present only at low tide, and then down the beach to its location at the peninsulas end. In 1829 a new road was built from the New Rochelle end of the dam to the Boston Post Road, creating a much-needed and more direct connection from the main road. The road still exists as the only access route to Premium Point. The business of the mill never recovered from the effects of the wars, and, eventually, dwindled to insignificance, due largely to the construction of the Erie Canal and the development of western New York as the great center of the milling industry. Henry P. Kellogg became its owner in 1843 and held it for nearly forty years. The last use of the mill was for grinding barite minerals, after which it was abandoned to decay and was torn down January 1883. == External links == * NY HomeTownLocator: Premium Mill-Pond * (GNIS)Premium Millpond ==References== * Category:Geography of New Rochelle, New York Category:Mamaroneck, New York Category:Long Island Sound ","title":"Premium Mill-Pond"},{"id":"46302709","text":"Donald MacLeary and Elizabeth Anderton in 1964 Elizabeth Anderton (born 28 May 1938 in London) is a retired British ballet dancer and director.

It is among the few films of the character to be directed by Bill Nolan who earlier worked on Felix the Cat films. The title is a play on the phrase \\"bouquets and brickbats\\" which is used as a section in some newspapers. ==Plot== Krazy wants to take a shower. However, he is being disturbed by a pesky rat. When Krazy chases the rat to the outside of the house, the rodent manages to tie a string around his tail. The rat hangs Krazy on a tree branch by his tail. After Krazy cries so much, the rat shows mock sympathy by cutting the string, causing the cat to drop. Krazy retaliates as he pounds and throws the rat onto a wall. The rat speaks and vows retribution. The rat enters a hole in the wall he was thrown on. Inside, there's a pack of other rats whom he negotiates with. Shortly, the other rats agreed as they march out of the hole and towards Krazy's house. Krazy is still in the bathroom of his house, trying to work on the piping system. The rats gather outside the house, armed with pistols. When one of the rats lands a shot, Krazy, who is also armed with pistols, leaps out a window and goes into a chase. After gunning down a few during the run, Krazy chases the rats to a mountain. The rats, who are on top, begin rolling down boulders. Krazy, however, is able to dodge the rocks, and even manages to throw one back. Krazy then finds a skunk around which he momentarily hurls towards the rats. The rats are quite afraid of the skunk as they jump into a lake. Krazy is back at home, resuming to shower. As he turns on a valve, regular water come out at first. But a few a seconds later, rats also rain down, much to his surprise. ==See also== * Krazy Kat filmography ==References *Bokays and Brickbatz at the Big Cartoon Database Category:1925 films Category:1925 animated films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American films Category:American silent short films Category:American animated short films Category:Krazy Kat shorts Category:Films about rats ","title":"Bokays and Brickbatz"},{"id":"46302759","text":"Events in the year 1854 in Brazil. ==Incumbents== *Monarch ‚Äì Emperor Pedro II. *Prime Minister ‚Äì Marquis of Paran√°. ==EventsBirthsDeathsReferences== Category:1850s in Brazil Category:Years of the 19th century in Brazil Brazil Brazil ","title":"1854 in Brazil"},{"id":"46302763","text":"Events in the year 1858 in Brazil. ==Incumbents== *Monarch ‚Äì Emperor Pedro II. *Prime Minister ‚Äì Marquis of Olinda (until 12 December), Viscount of Abaet√© (starting 12 December). ==EventsBirthsDeathsReferences== Category:1850s in Brazil Category:Years of the 19th century in Brazil Brazil Brazil ","title":"1858 in Brazil"},{"id":"46302764","text":"Events in the year 1878 in Brazil. ==Incumbents== *Monarch ‚Äì Emperor Pedro II *Prime Minister ‚Äì Duke of Caxias (until 5 January), Viscount of Sinimbu (starting 5 January) ==EventsBirthsDeathsReferences== Category:1870s in Brazil Category:Years of the 19th century in Brazil Brazil Brazil ","title":"1878 in Brazil"},{"id":"46302766","text":"Events in the year 1868 in Brazil. ==Incumbents== *Monarch ‚Äì Emperor Pedro II. *Prime Minister ‚Äì Zacarias de G√≥is e Vasconcelos (until 16 July), Viscount of Itabora√≠ (starting 16 July). ==EventsBirthsDeathsReferences== Category:1860s in Brazil Category:Years of the 19th century in Brazil Brazil Brazil ","title":"1868 in Brazil"},{"id":"46302767","text":"Events in the year 1851 in Brazil. ==Incumbents== *Monarch ‚Äì Emperor Pedro II. *Prime Minister ‚Äì Marquis of Monte Alegre. ==EventsBirthsDeathsReferences== Category:1850s in Brazil Category:Years of the 19th century in Brazil Brazil Brazil ","title":"1851 in Brazil"},{"id":"46302771","text":"All That I've Got may refer to: *\\"All That I've Got\\" (The Used song) *\\"All That I've Got\\" (Rebecca Ferguson song) *\\"All That I've Got (I'm Gonna Give It to You)\\", a song by Billy Preston ","title":"All That I've Got"},{"id":"46302773","text":"Marcelo H. del Pilar Street, also known as M.H. del Pilar Street or simply Del Pilar Street, is a north‚Äìsouth road running for connecting Ermita and Malate districts in Manila, Philippines.

His first documentary film was √âconomie de la d√©brouille √† Nouakchott (1988), a 26-minute film on Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania. ==Arab Jazz== The novel's main character, Ahmed Taroudant, lives in a suburb north-east of Paris, and is \\"a typical French Arab‚Äìreligiously non-observant, confused about his identity, haunted by the past. An avid reader of crime fiction and a neurotic, he finds himself taking the blame for a murder: his upstairs neighbor Laura, who was in love with him though he never noticed it, is murdered, and her blood drips down his wall. Two investigators (also readers of crime fiction) are already on the case, and Taroudant himself also tries to uncover what happened.The novel was translated into English by Sam Gordon. The reviewer for The Guardian, Robin Yassin-Kassab, noted that the novel is full of references to other works of fiction, including James Ellroy's White Jazz. Yassin-Kassab criticized the \\"somewhat clumsy\\" dialogue and some \\"too obviously functional\\" characters, but praised the settings and the portrayal of French second-generation immigrants from Northern Africa, and Misk√©'s scope: \\"Everyone‚Äôs been damaged by their heritage; everyone‚Äôs vulnerable to inner darkness and the explanatory narcotic of grand narrative\\". The author himself noted how similar his settings are to those of the perpetrators of the Charlie Hebdo shooting; he wrote the book between 2005 and 2010, and set it in Paris's 19th arrondissement, where much of the lives of the two killers took place: > When I heard about the attack on Charlie Hebdo, I was deeply disturbed like > most people....Then I heard how the killers crashed their car at Place du > Colonel Fabien and that they had hijacked another car and driven down the > Rue Petit--all places which appear in Arab Jazz--I thought what is > happening?

IsanaxÃÇ (variously spelled Issannakh, Isanak etc.) is the Aleut name for present day Isanotski Strait, and means gap, hole, rent, or tear in the Aleut language which was rendered as Isanotski (or Issanakskie, Isanotskoi, Isanakh etc.) in transliterated Russian. The strait appears as –ò—Å–∞–Ω–∞–∫—ä in 1802 and –ò—Å–∞–Ω–æ—Ü–∫—ã–π in 1844 on Russian maps.Vilbrekht, A.: Karta morskikh otkrytƒ´i Rosƒ´iskimi moreplavateliami na Tikhom i Ledovitom moriakh, 1802, Norris Peter Co., Washington, D.C., 1898, L.C.Karta Ledovitago moria i Vostochnago okeana, Hydrographic Department, St. Petersburg?, 1844, L.C.Baker, Marcus: Geographic Dictionary of Alaska, United States Geological Survey, Bulletin No. 299, Series F, Geography 52, Second Edition, USGPO, Washington, 1906 The strait is used by most vessels that are less than in length, when traveling between northern Alaska and points in southwestern and southeastern Alaska and the \\"lower 48\\" states. The city of False Pass, Alaska is situated on Isanotski Strait. Ikatan Bay in foreground, with entrance to Isanotski Strait in background. ==Geography== Isanotski Strait and Ikatan Bay separate the Alaska Peninsula from Unimak Island, the easternmost of the Aleutian Islands. Isanotski Strait has its southerly entrance at the northwest end of Ikatan Bay. Traders Cove, on the eastern side of Isanotski Strait about 7 miles above its entrance from Ikatan Bay, is a good anchorage. Morzhovoi, a mission and native village, is on the south side. The northern entrance has strong tidal currents, which are affected by strong northerly or southerly winds. There is an extensive shoal, or flat, in the northern and widest portion of the strait, lying to the east of the channel way and south of the outlet to the Bering Sea. Just outside this outlet, at a distance of between , is a line of shoals, with breakers, that extend from the northeast point of Unimak Island in a northeasterly direction for parallel with the coast. The mean rise and fall of tides in Ikatan Bay is 4.5 feet. In the narrow southern part of Isanotski Strait, the tidal currents have a velocity of 7 to 9 miles or more, and it is said that there is practically no slack and the current turns about three hours after high or low water in Ikatan Bay. ==History== This strait was used for safe passage for millennia by Aleuts and later by the Russians during their colonization of the area in Russian America. In the 1900s it was used by light-draft craft built in Puget Sound ports for service on the Yukon River, in making the passage from Puget Sound ports to St. Michael. It was the practice for these vessels to go through the inland passages of Southeast Alaska, out through Cross Sound, and coast around, watching the weather, going behind the islands off the Alaska Peninsula and through Isanotski Strait or Unimak Pass. Isanotski Strait was preferable to Unimak Pass for light-draft river vessels because it was nearer and had many sheltered anchorages and places where fresh water could be obtained. ==References== * * ==External links== * Category:Straits of Alaska Category:Straits of the Pacific Ocean Category:Bodies of water of Aleutians East Borough, Alaska Category:Unimak Island ","title":"Isanotski Strait"},{"id":"46302846","text":"Sublimotion is a restaurant located in Sant Josep de sa Talaia, Ibiza, Spain run by Michelin 2-star chef Paco Roncero who utilizes molecular gastronomy in cooking.

The field and laboratory methods for study ants are also listed in well documented fashion with an easily understandable way. The foreword of the Book was written by Prof. Seiki Yamane, who is a leading scientist about ants. During his forward, he stated that: \\"It can be said that now Sri Lanka has an active ant researcher who is expected to clarify the entire ant fauna of the country. For this goal to be achieved, the networking of Sri Lankan entomologists interested in ant study, and corporation with myrmecologists outside the country, particularly of India, may be indispensable. I (Yamane) hope this book will inspire native scientists to start studying these fascinating creatures.\\" After this book, Prof. Dias completed much advanced, scientific record for ants of Sri Lanka, first published by Biodiversity Secretariat of Sri Lanka in 2014 with 273 pages.

The film was released in a limited release and through video on demand on February 5, 2016, by Lionsgate Premiere. ==Plot== Arthur Denning (Hopkins) is the owner of a major pharmaceutical firm. He is very controlling of his girlfriend Emily Hynes (√Ökerman), and she is physically intimidated by his security guards. She is abducted, and Denning is sent photos of her bruised face. He is ordered to go to an art gallery with the ransom. When a man approaches him, Denning attacks him, only to find out later that he was the gallery owner. Before her abduction, Hynes reaches out to her ex-boyfriend Ben Cahill (Duhamel). Over drinks, she hints at Denning's abuse and some dirt she has on him. Back at her apartment, she shows Cahill files that she has stolen from Denning's laptop that reveal his criminal behavior during drug trials. She attempts to seduce Cahill. Later, she convinces a stranger to beat her up for the photo that she sends to Denning. Cahill uses the information from Hynes to pitch a class action lawsuit to his boss Charles Abrams (Pacino) which he then files as a class action suit against Denning. Later that evening, Cahill is stunned to find Hynes dead in her apartment. With a bottle of pills in her hand, and a lethal cocktail of drugs in her system, her death is suspicious but possibly just a suicide. Cahill decides to leave the scene without reporting it to the police and tries to cover his tracks secretly telling only his wife about it. At a preliminary deposition to the lawsuit, Denning suddenly settles the suit for $400 million, provided that the stolen documents are returned to him. A short time later, Hynes body turns up in Cahill's home. Convinced he is being framed, he then confronts Denning who is amused at Cahill's passion, but assures him that he had nothing to do with it. A hitman kidnaps Cahill and his wife Charlotte (Eve). Cahill manages to overpower and kill him. When he inspects the hitman's files he realizes that the villain of the piece is actually Abrams, who has been Denning's attorney for years. The settlement was all just an elaborate way of protecting Denning from criminal liability. Cahill submits the hitman's files to the police who arrest Abrams. Before he can be taken into custody, Abrams grabs an officer's gun and commits suicide. As Cahill packs for a move to a new house, he notices that some of his wife's clothing smells like Hynes' perfume. He asks her what happened between the two of them. Charlotte confesses that she confronted Hynes about her involvement with her husband. They had an argument in which Charlotte hit Hynes, causing her to fall and hit her head. Though Charlotte is a nurse, she did not help her and staged the scene for the police. ==Cast== * Josh Duhamel as Ben Cahill * Alice Eve as Charlotte Cahill * Malin √Ökerman as Emily Hynes * Al Pacino as Charles Abrams * Anthony Hopkins as Arthur Denning * Julia Stiles as Jane Clemente * Byung-hun Lee as The Accountant * Glen Powell as Doug Fields * Skye P.

On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 24 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Joe Leydon of Variety gave the film a negative review, writing: \\"Misconduct, a flagrantly derivative but modestly diverting drama of the sort that once claimed acres of shelf space at Blockbuster outlets. Anthony Hopkins and Al Pacino saunter through the proceedings while picking up easy paychecks and providing marquee allure, but it‚Äôs up to the top-billed Josh Duhamel to do most of the heavy lifting in this neo-noir scenario about an ambitious lawyer who bends the rules during litigation against a corrupt pharmaceutical tycoon, only to become entangled in at least two conspiracies. Limited theatrical play will be a mere formality, as is usually the case for such VOD-ready fare.\\" Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter also gave the film a negative review, writing: \\"Although one of its central characters is a ruthless, unscrupulous pharmaceutical company executive, Misconduct, sadly, is not a biopic about Martin Shkreli. Rather, it's the sort of by-the-numbers, forgettable thriller, starring actors whose marquee days are behind them, that is routinely dumped in theaters and on VOD. Showcased here are Anthony Hopkins and Al Pacino, reminding us that the 1970s and 1980s were a long time ago.\\" The film was also awarded The Barry L.

In 1992, he was appointed senior political advisor to Prime Minister Rafic Hariri. He served in this position until 1998, when he was forced into exile by the Syrian intelligence apparatus for his efforts to reduce Syrian tutelage of the country. Upon the withdrawal of Syrian troops in 2005, he resumed his journalistic career as a weekly columnist for Lebanese daily Assafir, before running for parliament in 2009. In 2014, he was named Minister of Interior and Municipalities in Tammam Salam‚Äôs national unity government. As minister, he devised and implemented a comprehensive security strategy to gradually impose state sovereignty on all the Lebanese territory. This put an end to the rounds of sectarian infighting that had taken place in North Lebanon for a decade and helped dismantle the criminal networks that served as support infrastructures for terrorist groups operating in the northeast of the country. In December 2016, Nohad El Machnouk was appointed Minister of Interior and Municipalities.

However, upon his return he defended officers involved in controlling the protests and rejected calls for his resignation, describing the aftermath of the protests as vandalism by rioters who had taken advantage of the chaos.

The Pakistani Parliament voted to adopt a policy of neutrality toward the conflict in Yemen, rebuffing a direct request from Saudi Arabia to commit troops and aircraft to the operation. However, on 17 April 2‚Äì15, Sharif said Pakistan would dispatch warships to enforce the arms embargo against the Houthis in support of the Saudi-led coalition. **Pakistan's left-wing opposition and the Pakistan Peoples Party has warned against participating in the conflict, advising the ruling conservative party, the PML(N), \\"to restore peace and not to participate in war.\\" Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, another major political party, has condemned the military intervention in Yemen. **In a press release by Foreign Office's spokeswoman, Tasnim Aslam, Pakistan has refused to be a part of any military campaign that divides the Muslim Ummah, hence adopting a strict neutrality in the conflict. A senior official in the Sharif ministry confirmed the \\"policy of neutrality\\" in the conflict, quoting: \\"Pakistan will not be involved in any action in Yemen itself but will provide support to the Saudis on their own soil if they are threatened.\\" **Many in Pakistan protested against the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen and popular public opinion is opposed to any support of the military intervention. **News media in Pakistan is speculating that Pakistan will not take part in the Sunni-led campaign against the Shiite Houthis in Yemen, as Pakistan has a sizable Shia following and enjoys cordial relations with Iran and China who strongly opposed the military intervention. In addition, Pakistan has stronger ties and historical relations with both Iran and Saudi Arabia, maintaining a balance with both states. In a session with Parliament, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif remarked: \\"We are not and will not fan any conflict that will divide the Muslim world on sectarian lines.\\" **Although the Pakistan government repeatedly rejected the claims, numerous foreign news media reported that Pakistan was a participant in the coalition force and quoted an unnamed senior government official.

Foreign Minister of Somalia, Abdisalam Omer, reiterated his administration's support for the legitimacy of Yemen's incumbent government. He officially confirmed that the Somali federal government had permitted the coalition to use Somalia's airspace, territorial waters and land. It offered to share its stabilization-related experience with the Saudi- led forces. The approval came after Somalia had leased its airspace to the Gulf states with Bosaso (in the northeast) and Berbera (in the northwest) scheduled to be used by the coalition forces due to their proximity to Yemen. ** ‚Äì The separatist administration of the Somaliland autonomous region in northwestern Somalia objected to the Somali federal government's decision, arguing that it was an \\"independent\\" administration and that the waters fell under its jurisdiction. * ‚Äì The Syrian Foreign Ministry expressed \\"deep\\" concern over the situation in Yemen. While Syria stressed the need to respect the sovereignty of Yemen and its independence, it called on all Yemeni parties to embark on a dialogue to reach a political solution that meets the aspirations and will of the Yemeni people. ** Syrian National Coalition ‚Äì The Syrian opposition group called the intervention in Yemen \\"a sound and deterrent step\\", suggesting it opened the door to a broader intervention against Iranian influence elsewhere in the Arab world. In addition to supporting the Houthis, Iran is a major backer of the Syrian government. * ‚Äì the Foreign Minister, in a press statement, said that they are concerned about the serious developments in Yemen and urged for dialogues. * ‚Äì President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan said that Turkey supported the Saudi-led military operation in Yemen.

However the UK said it would not be providing military support, though it later emerged that the UK had sent military advisers to help direct coalition attacks. * ‚Äì A National Security Council spokeswoman said the US would work jointly with Saudi Arabia to provide military and intelligence support while not participating in \\"direct military action\\". President Barack Obama declared that he had authorized US forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the operation against Houthis as a \\"Joint Planning Cell' with Saudi Arabia. US support has included UAV video feeds to aid Saudi airstrike targeting, refueling of Saudi fighter aircraft, and search-and-rescue support in the Gulf of Aden. Marie Harf, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said in April 2015, that the parties to the conflict should \\"end the fighting\\" and restart a political dialogue.

Pakistan dispatched two special PIA flights to evacuate some 500 stranded Pakistanis on 29 March 2015. Several UN staff members and Arab diplomats were also evacuated following the airstrikes. The Indian government responded by deploying ships and planes to Yemen to evacuate stranded Indians. Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj stated that since all the airports in Yemen were closed, they planned to bring people to the neighbouring country of Djibouti by ship, and from there to India by aircraft. India began evacuating hundreds of its citizens on 2 April 2015, via a commercial liner docked in Aden port. An air evacuation of Indian nationals from Sana'a to Djibouti was carried out on 3 April 2015, after the Indian government obtained permission to land two Airbus A320s at the airport. The Indian Armed Forces, in a rescue operation codenamed Operation Raahat, evacuated more than 4640 Indian nationals along with 960 foreign nationals from 41 countries. The operation ended on 11 April 2015. A Chinese missile frigate docked in Aden on 29 March 2015 to evacuate Chinese nationals from Yemen. The ship reportedly deployed soldiers ashore on 2 April 2015 to guard the evacuation of civilians from the city. The Chinese frigate evacuated 225 foreign citizens from 10 different countries in what Reuters described as \\"the first time that China's military has helped other countries evacuate their people during an international crisis\\". China also evacuated 571 of its own nationals and eight foreigners who worked for Chinese companies in Yemen. The Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said it would airlift its citizens out of Yemen if they requested to be evacuated. There were reportedly more than 50,000 Ethiopian nationals living and working in Yemen at the outbreak of hostilities. Malaysia also planned to evacuate its 879 citizens from Yemen, according to its Foreign Minister, Anifah Aman, but it was unclear whether they would be moved out by air or land. ==Timeline of events== On 4 April 2015, the ICRC called for a 24-hour humanitarian ceasefire after the coalition blocked three aid shipments to Yemen. Russia also called for \\"humanitarian pauses\\" in the coalition bombing campaign, bringing the idea before the United Nations Security Council in a 4 April emergency meeting. However, Saudi Arabia's UN ambassador raised questions over whether humanitarian pauses are the best way of delivering humanitarian assistance. On 7 April, China renewed calls for an immediate ceasefire. On 10 April, Julien Harneis (UNICEF Yemen representative) said to CNN, \\"The humanitarian situation is worsening all the time, with increasingly limited access to water, basic sanitation and critical health services,\\". As a result, UNICEF sent antibiotics, bandages, syringes, IV sets and other medical supplies. On 10 April, the Pakistani Parliament declined a Saudi Arabian request to join the coalition. The Parliament clarified the wish to maintain a neutral diplomatic stance. On 14 April, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution placing an arms embargo on three top Houthi leaders, including Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, as well as Saleh and his son, Ahmed Ali Saleh. The embargo also covered their supporters and called on the Houthis to retreat and lay down arms. Other provisions in the resolution include appointing UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, to \\"facilitate\\" the provision of aid, including humanitarian pauses. It also called on all involved parties to participate in peace talks in Riyadh. The resolution was sponsored by the Gulf States and Jordan, which held a rotating Security Council seat. On 16 April, the UN Special Envoy to Yemen, Jamal Benomar, resigned, citing his failure to negotiate an end to the conflicts. Benomar brokered the post-Arab Spring transition in which Hadi replaced Saleh. Following the resignation, Secretary General Ban called for an immediate ceasefire to facilitate the delivery of aid. On 16 April, a group of US- and UK-based Yemen scholars wrote an open letter, stating that the operation was illegal under international law and calling for the UN to enforce an immediate ceasefire. On 17 April, Iran submitted to the United Nations a four-point peace proposal aimed at ending the conflict. The proposal called for an immediate ceasefire and end of all foreign military attacks, humanitarian assistance, a resumption of broad national dialogue and \\"establishment of an inclusive national unity government\\". Exiled Yemeni officials later rejected the deal, calling it a political manoeuvre. Russia confirmed its backing of the proposal and said that it would use its full capacity to further the plan. The UN on 17 April called for 274 million US dollars in humanitarian aid to meet the needs of 7.5 million people over three months. The same day, Saudi Arabia pledged to fund the entire appeal. However, the UN agency responsible opted to keep the appeal open, stating that it \\"urged other donors to provide more support to meet increasing needs across the country.\\" On 18 April, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that Chinese president, Xi Jinping, had called King Salman and urged him to increase efforts to find a political solution to end the crisis. On 19 April, Oxfam condemned Saudi Arabia over airstrikes it said hit one of its warehouses containing humanitarian supplies in Saada. On 21 April, the Iranian Foreign Minister announced that he was hopeful that a ceasefire would be under effect later in the day. Mauritanian diplomat, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, was nominated by Secretary General Ban to replace Jamal Benomar, who resigned on 16 April. His nomination was confirmed on 25 April. On 24 April, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation announced it would hold an extraordinary meeting to discuss the situation. Aid groups came out against the air campaign: Amnesty International said some of the coalition's airstrikes \\"appear to have failed to take necessary precautions to minimize harm to civilians and damage to civilian objects\\". Reporters without Borders condemned a strike in Sanaa on 20 April that caused the deaths of four employees of Al-Yemen Al-Youm TV and injured ten others; it also condemned attacks on journalists by pro-Houthi forces. On 24 April, thousands of Nigerians demonstrated in Kano following Friday prayers to denounce the Saudi attacks. On 25 April, professor Sami Ramadani of London Metropolitan University claimed Hadi was violating Yemen's Constitution. According to the constitution, any leader, president or commander that requested military foreign intervention was to be tried for treason. However, under article 35, \\"No organization, individual, group, political party or organization may establish forces or paramilitary groups for whatever purpose or under any name\\". Additionally, under article 68, \\"no other [non-state-established] armed force may enter the House premises or take positions near its entrances except at the request of the Speaker.\\" On 27 April, Benomar stated in a press conference that Yemeni political parties had been close to agreeing on a final peace deal before the airstrikes started. On 29 April, peace activist group \\"Women's Power to Stop War\\" demanded an end to the conflict and sent letters to over 10 embassies and representatives, denouncing the conflict following a plea by Yemeni activist, Amal Basha. By the end of April, the US government was pressuring Saudi Arabia to end the airstrikes, with National Security Advisor, Susan E. Rice, saying, \\"There is no military solution to the crisis in Yemen, and the humanitarian situation will only worsen if the conflict continues.\\" Also on 29 April, US State Department spokesperson, Marie Harf, said the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, and EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Federica Mogherini, had discussed the situation, with particular emphasis on pushing forward political negotiations. On 30 April, the ICRC (Red Cross) and the World Food Program (WFP) said aid delivery had become difficult-to-impossible, with WFP suspending operations, due to ongoing fighting, air transport restrictions, and the destruction of Sanaa airport. On 1 May, the UNSC held an emergency meeting, called by Russia, to discuss the crisis. The council did not agree on a Russian-drafted statement demanding an immediate ceasefire in what the Russian delegate called \\"amazing indecision.\\" Diplomats said they rejected the Russian statement as they \\"needed time to consider the wording.\\" A US official said the US was working directly with the Saudi government to facilitate aid delivery, and condemned Houthi and pro- Saleh fighters for failing to abide by an earlier UN resolution calling on them to end fighting. An unnamed diplomat told AFP that diplomats had agreed in principle with the Russian resolution, but failed to agree on the exact wording. On 2 May, Kerry stated that the US, the UN, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were working on peace negotiations between the government and the rebels. On 4 May, the UN called on the coalition to stop attacking Sanaa Airport to allow delivery of humanitarian aid. ICRC head in Yemen, Cedric Schweizer, said \\"The harsh restrictions on importations imposed by the Coalition for the past six weeks, added to the extreme fuel shortages, have made the daily lives of Yemenis unbearable, and their suffering immense\\". WFP stated that its monthly fuel needs had increased from 40,000 to 1 million litres. On 6 May, Kerry pledged to discuss the implementation of a humanitarian pause with Saudi officials. Kerry, on a visit to Djibouti, urged all sides \\"to comply with humanitarian law to take every precaution to keep civilians out of the line of fire.\\" On 7 May, after Saudi/US discussions, Saudi Arabia proposed a five-day ceasefire. Two Houthi leaders told CNN that they would meet soon to discuss the proposal. Hours later, coalition spokesman said that forces would continue \\"a harsh response\\" to Houthis' attacks on the areas along the Kingdom's southern border. On 8 May, the Russian UN envoy said that he expected UN-brokered peace talks to resume quickly and warned that sending ground troops into Yemen would be \\"a reckless escalation\\". A UN official commented on the recently announced ceasefire saying that it would not be enough to accommodate Yemen's humanitarian needs stating that a UN- chartered fuel vessel was still waiting off the coast. On 10 May, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen stated that the attacks on Saada province were in breach of international law. On 29 June, Secretary General Ban denounced a coalition airstrike that had hit a UN compound in Aden the previous day and requested a full investigation. On 20 January 2016, Angus Robertson, the SNP's Parliamentary Group Leader, said the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, should admit to British involvement in Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen: \\"Isn't it time for the Prime Minister to admit that Britain is effectively taking part in a war in Yemen that is costing thousands of civilians lives and he has not sought parliamentary approval to do this?\\"\\"David Cameron accused of silently taking Britain into Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen\\".

It is situated on the old route of the Lake Z√ºrich right bank railway (Rechtsufrige Z√ºrichseebahn) from Zurich Hbf station to Rapperswil station. Radical changes to the local railway geography led to the tunnel being superseded in 1990, and closed and sealed by 2002. As built in 1894, the right bank railway was a single track line that departed from Z√ºrich Hbf in a westerly direction, before performing a clockwise 270 degrees turn via a viaduct over the Limmat, the principal river flowing through the city of Z√ºrich. It then passed through Letten station and the Letten Tunnel in order to reach Stadelhofen station. By rail the distance between Zurich Hbf and Stadelhofen was some , despite the fact that they are only apart in a straight line. In 1990 the Letten Tunnel was replaced by the Hirschengraben Tunnel, which took a direct route from new through low-level platforms at Zurich Hbf under the Limmat to Stadelhofen. After the new route opened, the original railway line and tunnel fell into disuse. The railway line was closed in 1998, and by 2002 it had been removed, and the tunnel was filled in and sealed off. The northern portal of the tunnel can still be observed from a location close to the former Letten railway station and the Letten power station on the banks of the Limmat. The northern approaches to the tunnel, including the bridge over the Limmat, are now used as a cycle and pedestrian path. == References  * Category:Transport in Z√ºrich Category:Railway tunnels in Switzerland Category:Tunnels completed in 1894 ","title":"Letten Tunnel"},{"id":"46303648","text":"Days N' Daze is an American band formed in Houston, Texas performing a type of folk punk they have called 'H-Town Thrashgrass'. Promoting a strong DIY ethic, Days N' Daze independently records, produces, and promotes all their own music. Song themes range from anarchism and environmental issues to anxiety, alcoholism, and parties. They are known for their energetic live shows. Days N' Daze have toured extensively in the US, Canada and Europe, playing anything from house shows to festivals, playing alongside the likes of Left√∂ver Crack and Weezer. ==History== Days N' Daze was founded in 2008 by Whitney Flynn and Jesse Sendejas who both grew up in Rosenberg, Texas, one of Houston's suburbs. They knew each other since high school and had been sweethearts before the founding of the band. In the beginning they were the band's only members: Whitney Flynn, with a musical background of classical piano lessons at a young age, followed by several years as a trumpeter in her junior high school's marching band. And Jesse Sendejas, a self-taught guitar player, who was introduced to music at an early age by his father, a Houston Press music writer. Yet in the band's early days the now characteristic trumpet sound was still absent, as Sendejas felt it wouldn't fit the musical style they were playing. However, he changed his mind after about two years of Flynn's persuasive efforts to give it a try. Flynn graduated a year early from high school and enrolled at Texas State University in San Marcos. Sendejas, still attending high school, soon afterwards abandoned education altogether and joined Flynn in San Marcos, a college town both started to loathe early on. In the following years, still being a couple, they started touring extensively and recorded their first four albums. These recordings took place in a closet in the house of Sendejas' father in Richmond, Texas, the same place the band is still recording their albums today. It was during this time that the band grew by two more members: Marissa Sendejas, Jesse's sister playing washboard, and Freddie Boatright, playing the gutbucket. According to Sendejas this initial choice of instruments was purely a matter of cost. He and Flynn wanted to play punk music from the start but did not have the funds to buy expensive equipment like drums. Eventually Flynn dropped out of university without a degree, a decision that has been attributed by some to the immense touring schedule of DnD at the time. However, according to Flynn herself, it was a series of circumstances that led her to leave university education. Among those were the death of her grandfather and the nearly contemporaneous separation from Sendejas as her partner. In the course of these events she left the university city of San Marcos in 2012 to live for a couple of months without a fixed address. Today Flynn manages Days N' Daze pretty much on her own and not only takes care of their finances but also handles tour booking. As Days N' Daze's popularity has grown over the last couple of years and management has become more challenging, Flynn mentioned ideas to continue her education in the area of \\"music business\\". Instead of quitting the band after their breakup, Sendejas and Flynn channelled this emotional turmoil into writing and recording their sixth album Rogue Taxidermy. As of today (08/2018) Rogue Taxidermy is their most regarded and top selling album on Bandcamp. The video of the album's song Misanthropic Drunken Loner has gathered over 5 million views on YouTube. The album was released the same year as Oogle Deathmachine. In March 2017 they released Crustfall, which features amongst others Left√∂ver Crack's Scott Sturgeon. The album title is a wordplay between Crust-Punk and a group exercise called Trust fall. The dynamic between Flynn and Sendejas has changed considerably over time. While both still consider each other BFF's and are still both equally responsible for writing the music of Days N' Daze, a process Sendejas described graphically as two Maelstroms rotating against each other, it has become difficult for the both of them to travel in the same vehicle on tour without starting to hurt each other emotionally. Days N' Daze have been playing in their current lineup since 2014. As a replacement for Freddie Boatright, who left the band after having a child, Geoff Bell was recruited in 2013 as their gutbucket player at an open gutbucket night, five days before the start of an upcoming DnD tour. Meagan Michelle joined the band in 2014 when their then washboard player was prohibited from crossing state borders due to legal reasons. Days N' Daze have an extensive history of touring with several known bands and artists including: Left√∂ver Crack, We the Heathens, The Infamous Stringdusters, M.D.C., Morning Glory, Night Gaunts (NZ), Cancerslug or Black Flag founder Chuck Dukowski's Sextet. On December 20th, 2019 Days N' Daze announced that they are working on a new album. On May 1st, 2020 the album Show Me The Blueprints was released. == Side projects == Both Jesse Sendejas and Whitney Flynn are and have been involved in several side projects over the last couple of years. They play together in Decathect, a band that rather resembles a \\"normal\\" punk band with its layout consisting of vocals (Flynn/Sendejas), guitar, bass and drums (Sendejas). Flynn plays trumpet in this band as well. The name \\"Decathect\\" describes the act of withdrawing one's feelings of attachment from a person or idea in the anticipation of future loss. Decathect has only released one demo EP to date. Together with his sister Marissa, Sendejas is active in a band called Chad hates George since 2012 which has put out two releases thus far. In addition, he is mostly active with his band Escape from the Zoo with whom he has released two EPs and the album KILLACOPTER in 2017. Whitney Flynn was an integral part of the My Pizza My World collective, which she released four EPs and albums with, before breaking up in 2016. Today Flynn occasionally plays solo shows as a solo artist under her own name or under her pseudonym \\"Death By Skwerl\\". Next to acoustic versions of Days N' Daze or My Pizza My World songs she also plays new songs of hers on guitar or ukulele. She toured as a solo act through New Zealand and Australia in November 2017. Both Flynn and Sendejas appeared on various songs of Dirty Harry's 2018 release Get Busy Living Or Get Busy Crying. == Trivia == Whitney Flynn taught herself how to play DnD's songs on guitar in a single night, when Jesse Sendejas couldn't play one of their shows: In a 2017 interview, Flynn cited their biggest influences as Left√∂ver Crack and Neutral Milk Hotel. Sendejas described Days N' Daze as a \\"glorified acoustic emo band with some ska influences\\". In 2018 some DnD members started to put out videos of them playing Dungeons & Dragons. As a pun to the shared abbreviation of both their bandname and the game they called this DnDnDnD. ==Band members== Current members * Jesse Sendejas ‚Äì lead vocals, acoustic guitar, accordion, banjo (2008‚Äìpresent) * Whitney Flynn ‚Äì lead vocals, trumpet, ukulele (2008‚Äìpresent) * Geoff Bell ‚Äì washtub bass, backing vocals (2013‚Äìpresent) * Meagan Michelle ‚Äì washboard, backing vocals (2014‚Äìpresent) Former members * Marissa Sendejas - backing vocals, washboard, piano (2011‚Äì2013) * Freddie Boatright - backing vocals, washtub bass(2011‚Äì2012) == Discography == Studio albums *We Never Said It Was Good (2008) *Perfectly Dysfunctional (2009) *Here Goes Nothin' (2010) *Ward Off The Vultures (2011) *The Oogle Deathmachine (2013) *Rogue Taxidermy (2013) *Crustfall (2017) *Songs We Recorded For Splits (2019) *Show Me the Blueprints (2020) Splits *Days N' Daze // Arroyo Deathmatch Split (2012) *Days N' Daze // Rail Yard Ghosts Split (2014) *Days N' Daze // Broken Bow Split (2014) *Thanks Mom!

Robert Edward McAlister (1880 ‚Äì 25 September 1953) was a Canadian pastor and evangelist who was one of the founding members of The Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada. His sermon concerning baptism in the name of Jesus at the Apostolic Faith World-Wide Camp-Meeting played a significant role in spreading the belief that God is not a trinity of persons, as well as baptism in the name of Jesus Christ (Acts 2:38) contradicting the historical position of the church that baptism is in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. (Matt 28:19) Oneness Pentecostalism.\\"World-Wide Apostolic Faith Camp Meeting\\", Word and Witness, 20 March 1913, 1; Blumhofer, The Assemblies of God, 222; Blumhofer, Restoring, 20 == Early Life and Conversion == R.E. McAlister was born in 1880 in Township of Ross, in Renfrew County, Ontario. His parents, James and Margaret McAlister, were Presbyterians at the time of his birth. In 1891, the McAlister family moved to Cobden, Ontario where McAlister became a Christian in the Holiness Movement church were his father was an elder. After his conversion, McAlister left Cobden to attend Bible College in Cincinnati, Ohio, but left in his second year when he became ill. Later, in Autumn of 1906, McAlister was traveling as an evangelist and decided to travel to Los Angeles, California after hearing about the Azusa Street Revival. At Azusa Street, it is believed McAlister became the first Canadian to receive the Holy Spirit. After the revival, McAlister returned to Ottawa to hold Pentecostal meetings in areas he was connected to with the Holiness Movement Church. ==\\"The New Issue\\"== In 1913, R.J. Scott organized the World-Wide Apostolic Faith Camp Meeting as an effort to unite other Pentecostals. During the event, tents were set up and several speakers were scheduled to give guest sermons to the event attendees. Scott asked McAlister to attend the event and give a sermon on baptism. McAlister felt that it was the perfect opportunity to preach about his new understanding of the baptismal formula that was presented in Matthew 28:19. During his sermon, McAlister claimed that pastors should stop baptizing in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and only baptize in Jesus‚Äô name because that was what the primitive church did. Other pastors at the event criticized McAlister for his remarks, yet he continued baptizing others only in the name of Jesus. One of the congregants at the camp meeting, John G. Scheppe, ran through the camp meeting shouting his revelation of the formula of the name of Jesus used in baptism in agreement with McAlister.Clayton, R., \\"United We Stand,\\" p. 15 As a result, three other audience members, Frank J. Ewart, G.T. Haywood and Harry Morse, would also become staunch advocates for baptism in the name of Jesus and would later become the impetus in the spread of the teaching of Rev. McAlister's teaching and the formation of religious organizations such as the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World and other Oneness Pentecostal and Apostolic religious organizations.\\"Apostolic Herald,\\" December 1943, p. 9 In response of McAlister‚Äôs sermon, Frank Ewart wrote, ‚Äúthe shot has been fired, and its sound was destined to be heard around the world, as Christendom would soon be shaken by this new doctrine.\\" In 1914, a year after McAlister gave his sermon over baptism, Frank Ewart and Glenn Cook baptized each other in the name of Jesus, starting the Oneness movement. McAlister's message also influenced many other pastors such as Howard A. Goss. However, in 1919, Aimee Semple McPherson preached a series in Ontario rejecting the Oneness movement and asking smaller organizations to join the Assemblies of God. As a result, McAlister left the Oneness movement and joined a Trinitarian group, yet he was still sympathetic to the Oneness movement. ==The Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada== On May 17, 1917, after backlash from other Pentecostal members concerning the creation of a Pentecostal denomination, McAlister, along with other Pentecostal leaders met in Montreal to discuss the creation of a church. It wasn't until after a second meeting in autumn of 1917 they decided to call their new church The Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada. Later in 1919, McAlister was named the Secretary-Treasurer of the new church. Because McAlister was the key business leader of the church, the national offices were wherever McAlister was pastoring at the time until 1937. In 1937 McAlister was succeeded by A.G. Ward as the new Secretary-Treasurer and editor of The Pentecostal Testimony. ==References== Category:1880 births Category:1953 deaths Category:Canadian Pentecostals ","title":"R.E.

She is known for adopting realism as her primary writing style. Two of her major works, and , both exemplify her utilization of realism. According to The Japan Foundation's Performing Arts Network,Pulvers 2006 Nagai is currently regarded as one of the most sought-after playwrights in Japan because of her \\"well-made plays,\\" in which social issues are treated from a critical perspective.Yoshie Inoue's \\"Japanese Women Playwrights: From Meiji to the Present\\" states that Ai Nagai's and Rio Kishida's plays are the most highly regarded by future generations. This is because their plays, in Inoue's opinion, are superior to the plays written by male playwrights of the same generation. She also adds that because of the deep-rooted influence of patriarchy, the male playwrights are still prioritized (Rimer 2014, 174) ==Life and work== Early life Ai Nagai was born on October 16, 1951, in Tokyo, as the daughter of a painter and a member of the Communist Party, Kiyoshi Nagai.Boyd 1999, 175-176 Since her parents divorced when she was still young, she was raised by her father and her paternal grandmother, Shizu Nagai. Her father's connections with the theater world when she was young influenced her to take on a path to a theatrical career. In , the character Grandmother Nobu is modeled on Nagai's own grandmother. Also, in , Nagai writes about her grandmother's experiences at a teachers college. After graduating high school, she became a member of the Friends of the Haiyu-za theater company,Haiyuza Theater which enabled her to watch all the company's productions. In 1970, Nagai studied at the theater department of T≈çh≈ç Gakuen College for four years, including two years in the postgraduate drama program. The theater department used to be an acting school that was affiliated with the Haiyu-za, where many professional actors had been trained. She chose this college because she became a fan of the actress Etsuko Ichihara and aspired to become a member of the Haiyu-za company. As the popularity of the \\"Angura\\" (underground) theater movement grew, she attended performances at small underground theaters. Examples include J≈´r≈ç Kara's J≈çky≈ç Gekijo, Kuro Tento and Ren Sait≈ç's Jiy≈´ Gekij≈ç. Seeing these types of performances made her lose her aspirations of joining a theater company of the Shingeki genre. After graduating in 1974, Nagai was invited to join the theater company, Spring and Autumn Group (Shunj≈´dan), where she met Shizuka ≈åishi. Since the company disbanded after two years, Nagai and ≈åishi decided to write and produce their own plays. Nitosha Theatre Company In 1981, Nitosha (The Two Rabbits) Company was established as a theater company. Nagai and ≈åishi named their theater company \\"Nitosha\\" because they were both born in the Year of the Rabbit. They also acted in original Nitosha productions as they alternate as playwrights. Their quick-changing two women shows such as helped them gain popularity. In 1991, ≈åishi left the company to have a career in TV scenario writing. This left Nagai to direct her own plays herself for Nitosha's productions.Clayton 2013, 264 This company is still active and it is located in Nerima, Tokyo. Nitosha has consistently provided plays that do not only entertain the audience but also make them feel actually involved and committed to the issues presented on stage. ==Theatrical career== Nitosha continues to put works on stage as Nagai writes and directs them. Other organizations like the New National Theatre, Tokyo benefits from her works because she writes for them too. Nagai also used to be the president of the Japan Playwrights Association. Nagai is active in other countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and South Korea.Japanese Artist Database: Nagai Ai, Performing Arts Network Japan Her plays are also presented as staged readings. For example, on February 22, 2010, Japan Society in New York read the English translation of in an English translation developed in late 2007.Japan Society Time's Storeroom Nagai's portrayed tough times faced by ordinary Japanese people as they evolve as a response to the turning points of Japanese history. Examples include the immediate aftermath of Japan's defeat in World War II, the high-growth period of Japanese economy, and the final period of campus riots in 1970 against the renewal of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty The trilogy consists of these three plays: , in which she depicts the first half of the 1960s; , in which she depicts the period immediately after World War II; and , in which she depicts life in the early 1970s. The characters in these works are not interrelated, but Nagai's approach is consistent because the postwar social issues and the plays' significance are portrayed by a particular family or by the events in an apartment building, their living conditions, and what they lost as Japan prioritizes the economic growth in the postwar period. Nagai also connects to another social change, the abolition of legal prostitution in 1958. The play illustrates ordinary people at the verge of the changes in life style and people's consciousness because of the rapid economic growth. She also illustrates the anti-Ampo movement that emerged among students at the 1970 renewal of the treaty ten years later. The Three Hagi Sisters Adapted from Anton Chekhov's Three Sisters, Nagai wrote in 2000. The three main characters in Chekhov's play are reflected in Nagai's adaptation. Nagai transforms Chekhov's drama into a comedy. This adaptation confronts current feminist issues and brings to light the disparity between traditional expectations of men and of women. She also depicts the liberation from the socially constructed gender roles in a society that is deeply influenced by a division of labor, attitudes, and behavior by gender.Edelson 2004, 2 Nagai's adaptation does not commend the old androcentric idea and the patriarchal perspective of families. Instead, it regards feminism with humor. While Japanese modern family dramas around the 1970s portray family breakdowns, Nagai's adaptation comically depicts the breakdown of the internal world of the sisters. The play has 14 scenes and is first staged in 1994 by the Nitosha Theatre Company. This play is also available in the English, Chinese, and Russian languages. Men Who Try to Make Them Sing One of Nagai's most popular plays, is a one-act play written in 2005. It is a social comedy depicting the Tokyo Board of Education's decision in 2003, in which teachers are punished if they fail to abide by the ruling to raise the flag and sing the national anthem at graduation ceremonies. This play is first staged in 2005 by the Nitosha Theatre Company. The casts included Keiko Toda, Ryosuke Otani, Moeko Koyama, Masami Nakagami, and Yoshimasa Kondo. This play is available in the English language from the Nitosha Theatre Company. Women in a Holy Mess Nagai's play is \\"a hilarious portrayal of post-menopausal life\\" that portrays three women's lives and friendship. The play's English translation was developed by Kyoko Yoshida and Andy Bragen in late 2007 at The Playwrights' Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This is one of her plays that was read in front of an audience and featured American actors led by Cynthia Croot, a New York City theater director. ==Style== Nagai's works focus on using realism. She depicts familiar places, subconscious problems, and issues about language, gender, family, and community. She presents ordinary Japanese people who have experienced some social changes in a comical way in contemporary Japan. Three of her highly evaluated works, , , and , portray contemporary Japanese lives satirically. She also incorporates some word play into her plays like in , although not as much as Noda Hideki, another contemporary playwright. Nagai and another playwright, Hisashi Inoue, have similarities in their approaches because they both aim to write about ordinary people going through extraordinary situations. Both playwrights also write differently compared to other playwrights in their own generation ‚Äî such as Toshiki Okada and Oriza Hirata. The clear and logical structure of Nagai's plays makes it naturalistic The characters are caught in some predicament and the motor for the play's theatricality is how the characters are liberated from the predicament. Nagai's plays are easily accessible to Western audiences because her works are both traditionally Japanese while also being very universal at the same time. Another playwright, Y≈çji Sakate, also resembles Nagai because the motivation behind his dramas is his social conscience. Sakate and Nagai both combine elements of Shingeki and Angura. ==Awards== Awards and nominations *1997: 1st Tsuruya Nanboku Drama Award for *1999: 44th Kishida Drama Award for *2000: 52nd Yomiuri Literature Prize for Scenario and Drama for *2001: Akimoto Matsuyo Award of the 1st Asahi Performing Arts Award for and *2003: Nagai was nominated for the 8th Yomiuri Theatre Award for Best Direction of *2005: Nagai was nominated for the 13th Yomiuri Theatre Prize for Best Direction of *2015: Minister of Education Award for Fine Arts for Awards and nominations for Nitosha Productions *2001: **Nitosha won the 1st Backer's Prize *2003: **Nitosha won the 27th Kinokuniya Theatre Prize for Group Achievement **Nitosha was nominated for Best Production of the 8th Yomiuri Theatre Award *2005: **Keiko Toda starred and won both the Akimoto Matsuyo Award of the 5th Asahi Performing Arts Award and the 13th Yomiuri Theatre Prize for Best Actress **Nitosha won both the Grand Prix of the 5th Asahi Performing Arts Award and the 13th Yomiuri Theatre Prize for Best Production *2006: **Shinobu Terajima starred and won both the 6th Asahi Performing Arts Award and the 14th Yomiuri Theatre Award for Best Actress for her performance *2015: **Nitosha won the Hayakawa \\"Higeki Kigeki\\" (\\"Comedy and Tragedy\\") Award ==Major works== Plays and adaptations *1983: *1984: *1984: A collaboration between Nagai and ≈åishi * **1994: **1995: **1996: *1997: *1999: *2000: *2001: *2001: *2002: *2004: *2005: *2006: *2010: *2010: *2011: *2014: ==NotesReferences== *Boyd, Mari (trans). 1999.

The game always pits one player playing against another (or against a computer). Your objective is to darken and dull out your opponent's colors and end the game with the brighter overall colors. Each player begins the game with a number of hexagonal pieces each with a different color and random number of outward-pointing arrows. Each turn, a colored piece is placed on the board. If a piece is placed on a space with one of the piece's arrows pointing at a previously placed piece, then the piece being pointed at will change color (and already placed pieces with arrows facing in the correct position will \\"retaliate\\" against the piece just played). When \\"attacked,\\" a piece will darken. The greater the color difference between the interacting pieces, the more attacked pieces will darken. A slider at the bottom of the screen indicates which player has the overall brightest colors and is thus winning. There is also a color wheel players can consult at any point during gameplay when strategizing.  Special Pieces  * Grayscale ‚Äì The grayscale piece does not have a hue, but will always mix as if it had a hue on the opposite side of the wheel. It still weakens as it gets darker. * Bomb ‚Äì The bomb piece counts down every turn until it explodes, blackening any piece its arrows face. The bomb piece is unaffected by other pieces. * Healing ‚Äì The healing piece will brighten the pieces that its arrows point at. The healing piece is unaffected by other pieces. * Split ‚Äì The split piece is divided into two halves with different colors. While the piece has two separate hues, they share the same brightness. * Wall ‚Äì The wall piece will function exactly as any of the other walls that were generated at the start of the match. == Reception == Soon after release, Sature was listed as one of The Best New iOS Games on MacLife and was on CNET's list of Best Mobile Games of March 2015. Within a couple weeks of release, Sature was a feature in Apple's App Store's Best New Games list in the United States. It has generated a series of reviews and has been described as a chess-like game. Others have likened it to Final Fantasy VIII's Triple Triad. A soundtrack of the game's music entitled Sature Original Soundtrack is also available for download. == References == Category:Android (operating system) games Category:IOS games Category:Windows games Category:MacOS games Category:Linux games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Board games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Sature"},{"id":"46303907","text":"Bruno Wojtinek (born 6 March 1963) is a French former professional racing cyclist.

It has established as a statutory body by the Act of parliament in 2016 by the Parliament of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, aiming to facilitate research relating to science and technology in order to build a vibrant scientific and technological community in the country, to promote and facilitate research relating to science and technology in higher educational institutions and public sector research institutes and other governmental institutes so as to develop a research base that will contribute to national needs and to solicit the co-operation of the private sector in the enhancement of research relating to science and technology. The National Research Council of Sri Lanka is an institute under the purview of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Research. ==History== The National Research Council of Sri Lanka (NRC) was founded by the President Chandrika Kumaratunga on 20th April 1999 and Prof. Aries Kovoor was appointed as the founder Chairman. In July 2007, the President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, issued a warrant formalizing the establishment of the National Research Council as a Special Agency, exercising the powers vested in him by Article 33 of the Constitution, and Prof. Eric Karunanayake was appointed as the Chairman. Prof. Janaka de Silva represented National Research Council since its inception and he was appointed as the Chairman to the National Research Council by the President Mahinda Rajapakse by the presidential directive dated 09th September 2013. Under the leadership of Prof. Janaka de Silva, the NRC established as a statutory body by the Act of parliament in 2016. ==Leadership== The Chairman of the National Research Council, currently Prof. Hemantha Dodampahala, is responsible for chairing the meetings of the Council (Boards of Directors) and for overall management of the Council. He is Consultant Obstetrician & Gynecologist at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo. Before January 2020 the institution was chaired by Prof. Janaka de Silva. ==List of Council Members== The Council (Boards of Directors) consists of the Chairman, 9 Council Members, Ministry Representative and Treasury Representative. *Prof. Hemantha Dodampahala - Chairman (Since 2020 ‚Äì Present) *Prof. Veranja Karunaratne (Since 2016 ‚Äì Present) *Prof. Chandana Jayarathna (Since 2020 ‚Äì Present) *Dr. Dinesh Arunathilake (Since 2020‚ÄìPresent) *Dr. B.

A multidisciplinary approach involves drawing appropriately from multiple disciplines to redefine problems outside of normal boundaries and reach solutions based on a new understanding of difficult issues. This programme was started in 2013, aligned with the Ministry of Technology & Research, and proposed the Ten Thrust Areas on which R & D intervention are immediately needed. Pre-proposals were invited from groups of researchers in public scientific research and development organizations and universities. The Target-Oriented Multi-Disciplinary research projects were aimed at solving nationally relevant issues targeting economic development, social welfare, and environmental sustainability of the country. These projects will aim to address major gaps in knowledge for policy/strategy or product development, or solving problems, which impede, or present a challenge to the nation. The path for translating research outcomes into policy, strategy, product/process development, and its uptake should be clearly identified. Proposals were invited from several priority areas associated with the National Research and Development Policy Report (Ten Thrust Areas) of the Ministry of Science Technology & Research. The value of a grant would be up to Rs. 50 million, over a 5-year period. As the NRC would invest a substantial sum of public money on these projects, funding would be on a highly competitive basis. NRC will select most appropriate and capable researchers with the ability to work together as a team on projects that the NRC consider likely to have a tangible outcome in five years. These multi- centered projects will have the advantage of its team members working concurrently on different aspects of the research. Operation aspects of the grant will be identical to the Investigator Driven Grant. However, in addition to the Principal Investigator, a deputy leader will be appointed. Once the grant is provided, these projects will be regularly and rigorously scrutinized, monitored, and evaluated to ensure the achievement of stated outcomes. Investigator Driven Research Grants The R&D; activities in Sri Lanka are mainly conducted by public institutes and universities, and are funded from various sources such as government institutional funds, competitive grants and research contracts. The NRC Research Grants programme was initiated for scientists to conduct research with minimum bureaucracy. NRC Research Grants programme provides competitive grants to public institutes for R & D activities. This programme has been streamlined over years of its implementation and now is more or less perfected. The grants are advertised annually, evaluations are based on scientific aspects, relevance to national development, and the findings are published in international journals. The applications undergo a strict evaluation process. For the proposals selected, the Council will decide on an appropriate allocation of funds that will be channeled from the Treasury, directly to the Principal Investigator, who will be solely responsible for project implementation. Funds are considered for equipment, consumables, etc. A bank account is opened for each project and the NRC monitors all transactions. This allows a considerable flexibility to scientists to utilize the funds with minimum red tape. The Council and the NRC Secretariat monitor and evaluate the process. It should be mentioned here that the present grants are diversified in nature. Other than funding research on pure science and on food, water, environment, and energy, the NRC has lately been funding research on national surveillance, irrigation systems, wildlife and ecotourism, speech translations, construction and architecture, railway traffic, sports and many other areas. A simple but comprehensive single set of applications are available for all programs. The number of applications NRC receives has increased over the years, which is a positive sign. Challenges for this programme are to assure the momentum that NRC has already achieved. The Council introduced many new regulations and guidelines to monitor and evaluate the progress of these grants, in order to derive the best outputs from them. Public Private Partnership Programme Advances in R&D; in Science and Technology (S&T;) will pave the way to development of value-added products and services that are competitive in the global market, and which will form an essential pillar of Sri Lanka‚Äôs envisaged economic development. To accomplish this goal, research performed in Sri Lanka needs to be demand-driven by addressing the needs of key industries of the country, which are expected to drive the economy forward. The Public R&D; Private Industry-Partnership (PPP) programme is to build on local strength by networking key players in R&D; activities and industries to contribute towards the economic development of the country. Promoting R&D; in S&T; should lead to economic development by way of increasing exports, diversifying exports, and promoting import substitutes. All innovative research leading to the development of new or better products, processes, services, value addition and solving technical problems with commercial potential will be considered for this programme. Meaningful partnerships between the different sectors will enable us to share our research expertise, cost, services and facilities more effectively to develop solutions for industry R&D; needs. The partnerships will also improve efficiency of public R&D; activities and reduce the time horizon. The Private sector participation is encouraged by providing tax concessions in relation to R&D; expenditure undertaken by an enterprise with public sector partnership. The NRC will interface between government - local institute - ministries - University - R&D; Institutes - corporate sector - SME sector, in providing research-based solutions to national needs. == President‚Äôs Award for Scientific Research == The National Research Council is empowered to develop a system to recognize and grant awards for national research and innovation relating to science and technology. As awards are given only to the highest achieving scientists, the NRC is required to regularly review and revise the selection criteria with a view of retaining their relevance and prestigious nature. Each award will be given for a published work rather than to an individual scientist, and all Sri Lankan co-authors with a Sri Lankan institutional affiliation of the publication will be recognized as recipients of the award. The journal ranking system (on the basis of which the best published scientific work will be selected) will be source normalized based on weighted citations to avoid bias towards any scientific disciplines, and will be available in the public domain. To encourage research that is conceptualized and performed mainly in Sri Lanka, recognition will be given to research with a significant contribution by Sri Lankan scientists working in Sri Lanka. Awards will be also given for patents based on innovations in Science. To allow sufficient time for completeness of indexing and documentation (including retraction), the awards will be given two years after the year of publication of a paper or obtaining a patent (e.g., achievements in 2017 will be given awards in 2019). Each year, an award will be given to each of the top 100 papers published in journals with the highest SCImago Journal Ranking (SJR), in which 20% or more of the authors of the publication are Sri Lankan scientists with a Sri Lankan institutional affiliation or to each International Patent (published/granted) based on an innovation in science awarded in a given year, to a Sri Lankan Scientist(s) with a Sri Lankan affiliation. ==See also== * Janaka de Silva * Ministry of Science, Technology and Research ==References * Official website Category:Research institutes in Sri Lanka Category:Science and technology in Sri Lanka Category:Research councils ","title":"National Research Council of Sri Lanka"},{"id":"46303957","text":"Elachista planicara is a moth in the family Elachistidae.

It occupied the former engine shed that was located east of Ashford railway station. The shed, with its turntable, coaling stage and water tower had been built by the Southern Railway in 1931. It ceased to be used for the servicing of steam locomotives in June 1962, following which it was used to service diesel locomotives. The steam centre was established in 1968. On 11 April 1971, the Southern Electric Group organised the Man of Kent 71 railtour, which visited the steam centre. Class 71 locomotive E5005 and 4TC set 427 were used. In 1974, the centre was open once a month, on the second Sunday of the month. At the time, there were around a dozen locomotives on site. Due to mounting debts, the steam centre was closed May 1976 and its rolling stock was dispersed. The engine shed and surrounding area were cleared in 1989, with the area being used for the storage of motor vehicles. Since 2005 most of the site has been sold for housing development. ==Rolling stock== The following items of rolling stock were based at Ashford Steam Centre. Locomotives {  - ! Origin !

The film's music was composed by Meet Bros Anjjan and Amaal Mallik. The film released on 25 September 2015. According to Bhandarkar, the story of Calendar Girls is 75% reality and 25% fiction. ==Plot== The plot begins with photographer Timmy Anand (Rohit Roy) who is in the process of calling the 5 girls whom he has chosen from different parts of India and Pakistan ‚Äì Mayuri Chauhan (Ruhi Singh) from Rohtak, Paroma Ghosh (Satarupa Pyne) from Kolkata, Nandita Menon (Akanksha Puri) from Hyderabad, Nazneen Malik (Avani Modi) from Lahore and Sharon Pinto (Kyra Dutt) from Goa to come to Mumbai for shooting for the country's most prestigious annual calendar which is a joint effort of a business tycoon, Kumar Kukreja (Suhel Seth) and him. The story now shifts to give a brief introduction about the personal life of the five girls. Mayuri, who is from Rohtak lives with her parents who are very supportive and encouraging of her becoming a calendar girl and are sure that she will make it big in life. Paroma, who is from Kolkata, has her parents and an elder brother who are not happy about her entering the modelling business. Her father tells her to go if she wants but not come back. Paroma decides to leave and saying that she won't come back, instead she'd call them to Mumbai one day and they will feel proud of her. Nandita, who is from Hyderabad, has her parents and an elder sister. Her family consists of all achievers with her mom and dad being CEOs of a company and her sister Sharda (Samiksha Bhatnagar) who has recently become the youngest Vice President of a company. Nandita has decided to make it big by becoming a calendar girl. Nazneen, who is from Lahore stays with her boyfriend Inzamam (Deepak Wadhwa) in London and feels that she has still not achieved anything big in life yet and calendar girl will be a platform for her to get into Bollywood. However Inzamam is not supportive of this, but she slaps him and decides to leave. Sharon who is from Goa is jogging on the beach with her friend who tells her about how bad the glamour world is and she shouldn't be going for this but she does not believe much about the rumours of the glamour world and decides to go ahead. The five girls are all geared up and have high dreams about the calendar. They go to Mauritius for shooting with Timmy and are out with the wonderful pictures which will be shown in the annual calendar which will be used at different places. They are in the calendar launch party where they are meeting different people from the glamour industry for film offers, modelling assignments, advertisement contracts, etc. and are very happy and feel that their life is going to change from now on. The story then moves to three months later. Paroma is a chief guest in a Bengali pooja organized by some pandal and there she meets Pinaki Chatterjee (Keith Sequeira) who is her old boyfriend from Kolkata. Pinaki persuades Paroma to revive their relationship and she agrees. Sharon is doing an ad and is very happy that she has selected Aniruddh Shroff (Rushad Rana) to take care of her work to get her assignments. Nazneen has got an offer for a Bollywood film from a very noted producer and the producer has kept a strict schedule for completing the film and also offers her a check for the signing amount and she is very happy. Mayuri is at her first day of shooting for the film and is advised by her secretary Tiwariji (Atul Parchure) to make a good impression with the crew members from the very first day. Mayuri gets very friendly with the director and the crew members and she uses her social networking skills tweeting about the movie several times to get a good publicity for it. The director feels that she will do very well in life. Nandita is attending a ceremony in Jodhpur where she is chatting with Naina (Suchitra Pillai) who is a socialite. She declares that Nandita is one of her favourite calendar girls. Naina then introduces Nandita to Harsh Narang (Vikram Sakhalkar) who is a very big business tycoon and the heir of the royal Narang family of Jodhpur. Harsh asks Nandita about her future plans and she tells that she is returning to Mumbai by flight the following morning. Harsh advises her to cancel her flight offering her a marriage proposal. Nandita doesn't answer initially but her sister advises that she should go ahead with this marriage stating that she will be living a very comfortable life like a queen. Nandita is reluctant to give up on the condition kept by Harsh to quit modelling, but her sister says that next year when the new calendar comes, offers will go down and slowly she may have to end her association with the modelling world. Nandita meets Harsh's parents, the Narangs (Kiran Kumar) and tells them that she has decided to quit modelling and the family gives her a warm welcome resulting in them getting married. Nazneen is travelling in a taxi and sees that there are some public protests on the road against Pakistani stars to quit the country. She is very tensed about her life being harmed and the city being unsafe for her. She is not in a position to go back to London since Inzamam is very angry on her. The producer who offered her the film has decided to withdraw the offer because of this issue and is unable to delay the film. She loses the film and is without any work. Few days later, she meets Ananya Raichand (Mita Vashisht) who runs a high class escort service for Politicians, Industrialists and Diplomats. Nazneen ends up becoming an escort girl. Sharon goes to a party at a friends place and there she meets Rehaan who is a friend of Aniruddh and gets to know about the rumours that Aniruddh spread about her that she slept with him. She gets very angry and slaps Aniruddh in front of his entire office staff. She ends up banned by the ad world and is unable to get any assignments on account of spoiling her relationship with Aniruddh. Paroma is attending a party where she has been invited by Pinaki and he introduces her to the different cricketers and people from the SPL cricket league. Pinaki tells her later about some issues that he is facing on the gambling with which they were to earn millions of rupees, where he wants Paroma to spend time with one of the cricketers as per his conditions. Paroma does so and they earn a lot with the daily matches of SPL. Vignesh Pranjpe (Sharad Ponkshe) who is a CBI officer has a doubt on them and keeps a close eye. Sharon meets Shashank Datta (Indraneil Sengupta) who is working in a leading news channel offers her a job as a host for one of their new entertainment show and Sharon becomes a very successful anchor later being promoted by the channel to a nationwide news reader. Mayuri has decided to sign a film with a builder's son for millions of rupees just to buy a flat through him and later meets Madhur Bhandarkar who also offers her a film. Nandita finds that Harsh is cheating on her and has married her just to keep her as a trophy wife and sleeps around with escort girls. She tells her in-laws and cries but they explain that Harsh loves her and she is the daughter-in-law of the big Narang family and these things are very common amongst the riches. Paroma gets arrested by CBI on the betting and match fixing case and Pinaki goes absconding leaving her in a lurch. Her brother and father come to give her a bail and tell her how shameful the family is feeling in the society because of her and disown her. She attempts suicide but stops as she gets an offer to work in a reality show because of her controversial image. Nazneen is feeling shameful about the job she is doing as an escort girl and wants to quit and go back to London. She decides to do it one last time with a foreign diplomat. But she finds that Inzamam has already dumped her and moved with someone else. Nazneen meets with an accident after escaping from the hotel and dies. After these incidents that happened with the calendar girls especially Paroma and Nazneen, this issue comes in the news on whether calendar girls is a platform for people to make a career in the glamour industry or is it a misuse. The other 4 calendar girls meet at Nazneen's funeral and are very sad that her body was in the morgue for 10 days and nobody claimed it. They realize how the glamor world is and how you need to live with it. Days pass by, months pass by and it is shown where are the calendar girls now ‚Äì Paroma is making her entry to the reality show, Sharon will happily marry Shashank, Mayuri receives the best debutant award in Filmfare and Nandita is pregnant with a child with Harsh.
