He worked for The Texas Company at Beacon, New York during the wartime, followed by a position in the Clinton Laboratory (Oak Ridge National Laboratory), and finally joined MIT in 1955, and retired in 1986. ==Research== Clifford G. Shull was awarded the 1994 Nobel Prize in Physics with Canadian Bertram Brockhouse. The two won the prize for the development of the neutron scattering technique. He also conducted research on condensed matter. Professor Shull's prize was awarded for his pioneering work in neutron scattering, a technique that reveals where atoms are within a material like ricocheting bullets reveal where obstacles are in the dark. When a beam of neutrons is directed at a given material, the neutrons bounce off, or are scattered by, atoms in the sample being investigated. The neutrons' directions change, depending on the location of the atoms they hit, and a diffraction pattern of the atoms' positions can then be obtained. Understanding where atoms are in a material and how they interact with one another is the key to understanding a material's properties. \\"Then we can think of how we can make better window glass, better semiconductors, better microphones. All of these things go back to understanding the basic science behind their operation,\\" Professor Shull, then 79, said on the day of the Nobel announcement. ... He started [his pioneering work] in 1946 at what is now Oak Ridge National Laboratory. At that time, he said, \\"Scientists at Oak Ridge were very anxious to find real honest-to-goodness scientific uses for the information and technology that had been developed during the war at Oak Ridge and at other places associated with the wartime Manhattan Project.\\" Professor Shull teamed up with Ernest Wollan, and for the next nine years they explored ways of using the neutrons produced by nuclear reactors to probe the atomic structure of materials. In Professor Shull's opinion the most important problem he worked on at the time dealt with determining the positions of hydrogen atoms in materials. \\"Hydrogen atoms are ubiquitous in all biological materials and in many other inorganic materials,\\" he once said, \\"but you couldn't see them with other techniques. With neutrons it turned out that that was completely different, and we were very pleased and happy to find that we could learn things about hydrogen-containing structures.\\" As he refined the scattering technique, Professor Shull studied the fundamental properties of the neutron itself. He also initiated the first neutron diffraction investigations of magnetic materials. ... \\"If there is a ... 'Father of Neutron Scattering' in the United States, it is Professor Shull,\\" wrote Anthony Nunes ..., professor of physics at the University of Rhode Island. ... Professor Shull came to MIT as a full professor in 1955 and retired in 1986, though he continued to visit and to \\"look over the shoulders\\" of students doing experiments in the \\"remnants of my old research laboratory.\\" Professor Shull's awards include the Buckley Prize, which he received from the American Physical Society in 1956, and election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1956) and to the National Academy of Sciences (1975). In 1993 he received the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences' Gregori Aminoff prize for his \\"development and application of neutron diffraction methods for studies of atomic and magnetic structures of solids.\\"' [1] ==HonorsShull's Personal Awards, Honors and Prizes=== *Awarded the Oliver E.

Heavily influenced by classic rock bands of the 1970s and 1980s (particularly Queen, Aerosmith, Def Leppard and AC/DC), Hawkins is noted for his falsetto singing voice and on-stage persona. He was also the lead singer and guitarist for the band Hot Leg, formed in 2008, and now on hiatus. ==Music careerThe Darkness=== Hawkins began playing clubs and pubs with the Darkness until they were signed by record label Atlantic Records. Their debut album, Permission to Land, went straight to number two in the UK charts upon its release on 7 July 2003, before going to number one and staying there for four weeks, eventually going on to sell 1.5 million copies in the UK. 3.5m copies over all. The Darkness took inspiration for some of their work from the local north Suffolk area, including \\"Black Shuck\\" which mentions the nearby village of Blythburgh. The success of this album led to heavy touring for the band, including European portions of Metallica's Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003. They then went on to headline the Carling Festival in 2004. The band won three BRIT Awards in 2004 in response to the album, Best Group, Best Rock Group and Best Album. They also won two Kerrang! awards in 2004 for Best Live Act and Best British Band. The third single from the album, \\"I Believe in a Thing Called Love\\", was a substantial hit in the UK as was their tilt at the Christmas 2003 number 1, \\"Christmas Time (Don't Let the Bells End)\\", which only just fell short, both singles reaching No.2 in 2003. The band also appeared in the video \\"Band Aid 20\\" with Justin singing a number of lines. Justin Hawkins performs live with the Darkness By late 2004 the band's constant media coverage had started to lead to a general public backlash, and Hawkins and the band themselves seemed to show signs that they were disillusioned with their constant media appearances, infamously walking off of an episode of the U.S.-nationally syndicated radio talk show Loveline on 19 April 2004. In October 2005, a month before the album One Way Ticket to Hell... And Back was to be officially released, Hawkins won an eBay auction for a copy of One Way Ticket to Hell... and Back for ¬£350 under the username 'turbogunhawk'. He claimed he did this so that he could track down whoever sold the digitally-marked advance copy of the album and try to prevent it from happening again. \\"One Way Ticket\\", the first single from their second album, was released on 14 November 2005, debuting and peaking at number 8 on the UK Singles chart. The album itself was released on 28 November 2005, to somewhat mixed reviews. The album was produced by rock producer Roy Thomas Baker, best known for his work with Queen. Early sales figures in the UK showed the album had not sold as well its predecessor, Permission to Land. The album debuted at no. 11, and fell to number 34 in the second week of its release. Although it went on to achieve platinum status, this was in stark contrast with their debut's five times platinum status. The Darkness live in Glasgow, February 2006 The second single taken from their second album was \\"Is It Just Me?\\", released on 20 February 2006. The single gained a preliminary position of No. 6 all that week, but finally charted at number 8. Hawkins announced when on stage that their third single to be released from the album was \\"Girlfriend\\". Released 22 May, \\"Girlfriend\\" charted at number 39. The band followed up their second album with a tour of the UK and Ireland, consisting of 12 dates in the major cities. The tour opened in Dublin's Point Depot on 4 February and closed in the Nottingham Arena on 20 February. Few of the venues sold out, their appeal seemingly having become more selective. Their world tour, which followed, arrived in Australia and Japan after touring Scandinavia and Continental Europe in March. In October 2006, Hawkins left the Darkness. Although drug and alcohol problems were initially cited as the main reason, later on national television, Hawkins would claim that he had grown tired of the constant routine of the band, recording and promoting an album, going on tours for months, back in the studio, etc. which he considered \\"monotonous and boring\\" and \\"could not understand how bands like the Rolling Stones could sustain it\\".This Morning, ITV, 2007 For his time with the Darkness, Hawkins placed at number 35 on Spin list of the greatest frontmen of all time. In 2011 the band reunited and toured Europe, Asia and North America throughout 2011 and 2012 in support of their new album Hot Cakes. They then released Last Of Our Kind in 2015. The band returned in 2017 with Pinewood Smile, their first album to come through Cooking Vinyl. Ahead of the album's announcement, The Darkness toured Europe in support of Guns N' Roses and played a number of festivals in the UK and Europe during the summer. In 2018, they released their Live At Hammersmith album. 2019 saw The Darkness release their latest album Easter Is Cancelled on October 4th. Easter Is Cancelled became the band's fourth Top 10 album and topped the Official Charts Top 40 Rock And Metal Chart and the iTunes Rock Chart, while the record has achieved over 3 million streams on Spotify alone. The album was released to critical praise while the previous singles ‚ÄòHeart Explodes‚Äô and ‚ÄòRock And Roll Deserves To Die‚Äô proved a radio hit on the playlists of Radio 2, Absolute, Kerrang and more. The video for ‚ÄòRock And Roll Deserves To Die‚Äô has also individually surpassed 1 million views. In January 2020, The Darkness released a new video for \\"In Another Life\\", which featured model Abbey Clancy. The track then made the BBC Radio 2 B-List. ===Other projects=== In 2005, Hawkins set up a solo project, called British Whale. His debut single, \\"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\\", a cover of the 1974 hit by Sparks, was released on 15 August, reached No. 6 on the UK Singles Chart and featured multiple World Darts Champion Phil Taylor in the video. In 2006 Hawkins released a second single, available only to download, an unofficial World Cup anthem called \\"England\\". Hawkins sang backing vocals on Sweet's song \\"Hell Raiser\\" for Def Leppard's 2006 covers album Yeah!. In early 2007, he became half of one of six acts competing to represent the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest competition in Helsinki in a duet with singer Beverlei Brown. He entered Making Your Mind Up with Beverlei Brown singing a song entitled \\"They Don‚Äôt Make 'Em Like They Used To\\" but did not win the competition. On 16 March 2007, he appeared on the Comic Relief evening during the half-hour Top Gear of the Pops programme. This saw him performing Billy Ocean's \\"Red Light Spells Danger\\" with the three Top Gear presenters. Later that month, on 29 March, Hawkins created a new MySpace profile featuring songs that were planned to be included on his upcoming solo album entitled Panther. The songs are titled \\"You Can't Hurt Me Anymore\\", \\"I've Met Jesus\\" and \\"Whichever\\". On 12 May, Hawkins added a further song to his profile, \\"Gay in the 80's\\", to appear on the same album. Later, on 13 July, he removed all the songs, and mentioned \\"You'll just have to wait\\". He later announced a new band line-up and name: Hot Leg. The aforementioned songs featured on the Hot Leg album Red Light Fever. Hawkins with new band Hot Leg, October 2008 Hawkins also announced that he had been participating in the recording of two Magnet Watch albums entitled Nude Horizon and Party Party Time Time. On 8 November 2007, at 3:00 am, Hawkins posted a MySpace blog containing directions to Do the Green Thing, an organisation for which he has composed a new song, \\"Do It in the Dark\\", to accompany a short film that encourages people to switch off and save energy. The song has not been released as a single but is available as a free download. There is a wax model of Hawkins at Madame Tussaud's in London. Hawkins supplied the singing and guitar playing for Kurtz, the lead singer of the \\"bad guy band\\" Mantyz in the BBC's animated series Freefonix, which debuted on 4 January 2008. In the film Telstar, a film about Joe Meek's life and career that was released on 19 June 2009, he played the role of Screaming Lord Sutch. With Hot Leg in November 2008, he toured the UK supporting Alter Bridge ( 4‚Äì13 November) and Extreme ( 14‚Äì24 November). Hawkins has also worked with British pop-rock band Saving Aimee, having recently completed producing their debut album. He also lent his \\"truth larynx\\" to the track \\"Party All Day (Fuck All Night)\\" guesting on the 2009 Steel Panther release, Feel the Steel. Hawkins recently worked with Adam Lambert on the track \\"Music Again\\" off his debut album. Justin played the role of Josh, a burned out rockstar in the 2010 movie Psychosis. The movie also featured three Hot Leg songs. Hawkins also appeared on the Meat Loaf album Hang Cool Teddy Bear, where he co-wrote two songs (\\"Love Is Not Real\\" and \\"California Isn't Big Enough\\"). He also provided guitar on \\"California Isn't Big Enough\\" and backing vocals on \\"Love Is Not Real\\" and \\"Los Angeloser\\". In 2012, Hawkins appeared in a Samsung commercial for their Galaxy Note smartphone during Super Bowl XLVI. In 2016, Hawkins appeared on the De La Soul album and the Anonymous Nobody... providing vocals on the track \\"Lord Intended\\". In 2020, Hawkins participated in the UK version of The Masked Singer, appearing as Chameleon. His identity was revealed in the third episode when he was voted out. During his time on the show he performed renditions of \\"Creep\\" by Radiohead, \\"Feel It Still\\" by Portugal. The Man, and \\"True Colors\\" by Cyndi Lauper. == Personal life == Justin Hawkins is vegan. He resides in Switzerland with his wife and daughter. ==Equipment== Justin Hawkins in 2020 Hawkins is seen playing Gibson Les Paul Customs almost exclusively. He is most commonly seen playing an alpine white model which he used with the Darkness (as seen in the \\"I Believe in a Thing Called Love\\" & \\"Love is Only a Feeling\\" music videos), and with Hot Leg. It is rare to see him use another guitar, although he can be seen playing a custom Ibanez Jem for the song \\"Bald\\". He has also been seen using an ebony Gibson Les Paul Custom, a one-off Gibson \\"Less Paul\\" custom sculpted to resemble a shell, and a custom finished blue Les Paul standard airbrushed with the mythical dog Black Shuck and Blythburgh church. In 2004 Gibson issued a limited run of Justin Hawkins signature Les Paul Customs based on the '68 RI with abalone and mother of pearl \\"flame\\" inlays on the fretboard, a sparkle finish in either Silverburst or Pinkburst (a Blueburst and Redburst have also been pictured, as well as a one-off Gold Mirror finish produced by SimS Custom Guitars). These have become highly valuable because of their scarcity and unique features. Hawkins used Mesa Boogie dual and triple rectifier amplifiers rather than Marshall Amplification when performing with the Darkness. The stacks he was using had custom-made speaker cabs coated in red leather. During his time in Hot Leg he was exclusively seen using Cornford MK50H II's in white vinyl with two Cornford, 16-ohm, 4x12 cabinets loaded with Celestion \\"Vintage 30s\\". Since the Darkness reformation he has been seen using multiple modified Marshall 1959 MKII Plexi Reissue guitar amps with a boosted gain stage run through Marshall 1960B cabinets. Since 2016, Hawkins uses EVH and Wizard amplifiers. In a 2012 edition of Guitarist Magazine's video series \\"On the Road with...\\" Hawkins's pedal setup consisted of a Boss Analog Delay, a Pro Co RAT, a Diamond Pedals Compressor, a Boss TU-3 Tuner, and a Dunlop Cry Baby DCR-2SR rack module which allows him to have three separate wah-wah pedals strategically placed around the stage. As of 2016, Hawkins does not use any pedals. On the song \\"Girlfriend\\", Hawkins uses a Moog Keytar for the solo. ==References== ==External links== * Official Website of British Whale * They Don‚Äôt Make 'Em Like They Used To MP3 ‚Äì Justin Hawkins and Beverlei Brown's entry into Making Your Mind Up * JustinHawkinsRocks.co.uk, UK-based fan site for Justin Hawkins and his projects Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:English male singers Category:English rock singers Category:English songwriters Category:People from Lowestoft Category:English rock guitarists Category:Lead guitarists Category:People from Chertsey Category:The Darkness (band) members Category:People educated at East Point Academy Category:Ivor Novello Award winners Category:English male guitarists Category:Participants in British reality television series ","title":"Justin Hawkins"},{"id":"522007","text":"The Digger Papers was a free collective publication of the Diggers, one of the 1960s improvisational theatre groups in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district.

Food Not Bombs' ideology is that myriad corporate and government priorities are skewed to allow hunger to persist in the midst of abundance. To demonstrate this (and to reduce costs), a large amount of the food served by the group is surplus food from grocery stores, bakeries and markets that would otherwise go to waste (or, occasionally, has already been thrown away). This group exhibits a form of franchise activism. == Principles == The group serves free meals Food Not Bombs is an all- volunteer global movement that shares free vegan meals as a protest to war and poverty. Each chapter collects surplus food that would otherwise go to waste from grocery stores, bakeries and markets (and occasionally from garbage dumpsters when stores are uncooperative), as well as donations from local farmers, then prepares community meals which are served for free to anyone who is hungry. According to Food Not Bombs the central beliefs of the group are: * Always vegan or vegetarian and free to everyone. * Each chapter is independent and autonomous and makes decisions using the consensus process. * Food Not Bombs is dedicated to nonviolence and sees \\"food as a right not a privilege.\\" According to Food Not Bombs the main goals is to combat poverty and homelessness in society by sharing food in public, at physically accessible places and facilitating community gatherings of hungry people. A main purpose of Food Not Bombs is allowing anyone to help cook, and eat. == History  1980s === Food Not Bombs was founded in 1980 in Cambridge, Massachusetts by anti-nuclear activists Keith McHenry, Jo Swanson, Mira Brown, Susan Eaton, Brian Feigenbaum, C.T. Lawrence Butler, Jessie Constable and Amy Rothstien. Co-founder, Keith McHenry has volunteered for 35 years and can be found sharing food almost every week in various cities including Santa Cruz, California and Taos, New Mexico. The members' activities included providing food, marching, and protesting. Their protests were against such things as nuclear power, United States' involvement in the Salvadoran Civil War, and discrimination against the homeless. The first arrests for sharing free food were on August 15, 1988 at the entrance to Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, California. Nine people were arrested that day, including McHenry. The city went on to make over 1,000 arrests, and Amnesty International declared these volunteers 'prisoners of conscience'. === 1990s: further development === Food Not Bombs grew throughout the 1990s, and held four international gatherings: in San Francisco in 1992 and in 1995, in Atlanta in 1996, and in Philadelphia in 2005. The 1995 International Food Not Bombs Gathering took place in and around United Nations Plaza in San Francisco at the same time the world was celebrating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations (at a historic conference in San Francisco). Chapters of Food Not Bombs were involved in the rise of the Anti-Globalization Movement in the late 1990s, leading to the APEC resistance in Vancouver in 1997; the June 18, 1999, International Carnival Against Capitalism; and the so-called \\"Battle of Seattle\\" later that year, which shut down the World Trade Organization meetings. Food Not Bombs helped start the Low Watt FM Free Radio, the October 22nd No Police Brutality Day, and Homes Not Jails during the San Francisco days. \\"Free Soup for the Revolution\\" illustration === 2000s: anti-war activism === Food Not Bombs supported the actions against the Iraq War by providing meals at protests all over the world. During a presentation to the University of Texas at Austin in 2006, an FBI counter-terrorism official labeled Food Not Bombs and Indymedia as having possible terrorist connections. In the summer of 2007, the Fort Lauderdale Food Not Bombs chapter began to receive systematic harassment by local law enforcement until an ultimatum made by the Fort Lauderdale Police for the arrest of those conducting the feedings was met with hundreds of supporters the next week and subsequent relenting by local law enforcement until the 2010s. Orlando enacted an ordinance prohibiting serving food to more than a certain number of people without a permit. In the fall of 2007, Eric Montanez of Orlando's Food Not Bombs was charged with violating a city ordinance by feeding more people in a public park at one time than the law allows without a permit. On October 10, 2007, Montanez was acquitted by a jury. Food Not Bombs and a church for the homeless called First Vagabonds Church of God sued the city on the grounds that serving food is first amendment-protected political speech and religious activity. The groups won and the city ordinance was overturned; Orlando appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and won. On August 31, 2010, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the decision, barring Orlando from enforcing the ordinance until another hearing before a 10-judge panel takes place. In May 2008, local business owners attempted to stop the Kitchener, Ontario, Food Not Bombs from serving in a highly visible downtown location, describing the group as supporting meat-free diets, anti-capitalism, and an end to Canada's military intervention in Afghanistan. In April 2009, the city of Middletown, Connecticut, issued a cease-and-desist order to the local chapter of Food Not Bombs. Prior to the order, the City Health Inspector had cited the organization for distributing food without a license. In August 2009 the chapter began operating out of a licensed kitchen provided by the Middletown First Church of Christ Congregational as state hearings into the matter were held. === 2010s === A Food Not Bombs chapter serves a meal in a public park As of October 2011, there were more than 400 chapters of Food Not Bombs listed on the organization's website,FNB All Contacts with about half the chapters located outside the United States. Food Not Bombs has a loose structure: every chapter of Food Not Bombs embraces a few basic principles, and carries out the same sort of action, but every chapter is free to make its own decisions, based on the needs of its community. Likewise, every chapter of Food Not Bombs operates on consensus. Besides collecting and distributing food for free, many chapters of Food Not Bombs are involved in community anti-poverty, anti-war, and pro-immigrant organizing, as well as other political causes related to social justice. == Causes  Resistance to restrictions on food sharing === The most widely publicized restrictions on food sharing involving Food Not Bombs were the 2011 feeding bans in Florida. Similar laws have been enacted in other jurisdictions, including Philadelphia and Houston.  2011 Florida feeding bans  On April 20, 2011, an en banc panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Orlando ordinance as a valid \\"time, place and manner\\" regulation, reversing the initial ruling of First Vagabonds Church of God, An Unincorporated Association, Brian Nichols v. City of Orlando, Florida and removing the permanent injunction against the Orlando ordinance that was first attempted in 2007. On May 18 the 30-day stay ended and the ordinance would soon be enforced on June 1 resulting in the arrest of co-founder Keith McHenry and Orlando FNB volunteer Ben Markeson. Each successive sharing saw arrests, with four arrests on June 6, five on June 8, three on June 13, and six on June 21. That same week the lawyer for Orlando FNB issued a cease and desist to the city, saying that violating the ordinance was not an arrestable offense, and hackers claiming to be affiliated with Anonymous began issuing threats to the city of Orlando. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer has also received heavy criticism for referring to Food Not Bombs activists as \\"food terrorists.\\" On Monday, June 20, no arrests were made at Food Not Bombs' breakfast in Lake Eola Park, however Ben Markeson was cited for holding a sign without a permit, with much confusion among city officials about procedure and the violations of civil rights. The city later issued a statement reversing their interpretation of the sign regulations. On the same day hackers carried through with their threats and took down the Orlando Chamber of Commerce site and a Universal Studios website in \\"Operation Orlando,\\" issuing a video statement later declaring a 48-hour cease fire on the condition that the city arrest no one for feeding the homeless, presumably on June 22. On June 22 more arrests took place including a second arrest of McHenry, resulting in a 17-day stay in jail. \\"Operation Orlando\\" soon went into full attack resulting in many websites going down in subsequent days. Orlando and Dyer were soon inundated with national and international attention and outcry. On July 1, OFNB took the Mayor up on his offer to move sharings to City Hall, which stopped arrests and resulted in a new, stable arrangement for OFNB. Homeless hacktivist Christopher Doyon, also known as \\"Commander X\\", was eventually arrested for \\"Operation Orlando\\" and other activity. Soon after his arraignment he held a press statement where he admitted to all charges, but argued that the distributed denial of service attacks constituted acts of cyber-civil disobedience. Fort Lauderdale has been pondering a feeding ban for some time. In 2011 FNB activists complained about unjust surveillance and arrest and claimed to be victims of an unwarranted police raid due to their home having their electricity cut off; they were harassed by police asking if they were \\"terrorists.\\" Activists have also been arrested while playing a game of capture the flag. Pinellas County is not only trying to ban feeding but is also banning sleeping in public. This means that homeless people in the St Pete area must either move into the \\"Safe Harbor\\" homeless facility or get out of the town. An ordinance in Sarasota currently requires gatherings of 75 or more people to obtain a special event permit. Local residents are currently petitioning to lower that number to 12, as well as to require feeders to obtain the same permit necessary for people who sell goods in public places (a $150 fee). There have been numerous other ordinances in recent months targeting the homeless, including the banning of smoking and removing park benches. Since 2009, homeless shelters in Gainesville could feed only 130 people at a time, leading to the formation of the Coalition To End The Meal Limit. Two years later, the meal limit and other rules were significantly changed, resulting in a victory for the Coalition to End The Meal Limit. On August 19, 2011, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer held a press conference to announce that charges against food sharers arrested in Lake Eola Park, Orlando, were dropped, resulting in a new state of compromise between Buddy Dyer's administration and Orlando Food Not Bombs.  2014 Fort Lauderdale sharing ban  In November 2014, Fort Lauderdale finally enacted a sharing ban, drawing a similar flurry of media attention as in Orlando. Several Food Not Bombs activists were arrested sharing food and other acts of civil disobedience, for which they received \\"Civil Liberties Arrest\\" medals from the Broward County ACLU. Other FNB activists went on hunger strike against enforcement of the law. A court injunction stopped enforcement of the sharing ban in early December 2014 pending several court cases. In late December the injunction was extended until February. On January 29, 2015, Food Not Bombs filed a 29-page federal lawsuit against the City of Fort Lauderdale to strike down the sharing ban ordinances as unconstitutional. On August 22, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ruled that outdoor food sharing by Food Not Bombs was protected under the First Amendment. The case was sent back to the lower court to determine whether the 2014 sharing ban was unconstitutionally vague. === FNB's involvement in the Occupy Wall Street movement === Food Not Bombs groups have been heavily involved in supporting occupation camps across the US during the Occupy Wall Street movement. The use of consensus, supporting urban homeless communities, and mass feedings through donations are all specialties of Food Not Bombs that has now seen an unheralded demand. In a case of history repeating itself, a Food Not Bombs kitchen was removed in a late night police confrontation with Occupy San Francisco in mid-October. Co-founder C.T. Lawrence Butler came back to the Boston activism scene to join Occupy Boston. Co-founder Keith McHenry, who spent much of the year encouraging the advent of American occupation camps during his touring, has been an enthusiastic participant in many camps even as he has released a new Food Not Bombs handbook. A Food Not Bombs World Gathering took place August 20‚Äì26, 2012, in Tampa, Florida - the week before the Republican National Convention. In conjunction with Occupy Tampa and many other organizations, Food Not Bombs activists collected and prepared food for hundreds of RNC protesters and offered workshops, cultural events, and protest activities from August 20‚Äì30. === Occupy Sandy === Near the end of 2012, Food Not Bombs activists, in particular, Long Island Food Not Bombs, fed countless thousands of people in the wake of Superstorm Sandy alongside \\"Occupy Sandy.\\" The outpouring of food going to waste and support for disaster-stricken, impoverished communities culminated in the \\"Largest Food Not Bombs Ever\\" at the \\"Hempstead Food Share Bonanza\\" on Nov. 18th. === The Food Not Bombs Free school === Keith McHenry and other long-time Food Not Bombs activists announced in 2012 the opening of the FNB Free Skool in Taos, New Mexico. The first year of classes started in summer of 2013. Topics covered by the course are an analysis of current social issues, community organizing, nonviolent social change, cultural events which support social change, and sustainable future for communities. == See also == * Anarchism * Anti-capitalism * Anti- consumerism * Basic income * Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Act of 1996 * Curry Without Worry * DIY ethic * Freeganism * Gini coefficient * Harmandir Sahib * Homeless ministry * Human rights * Hunger * Homelessness * Income inequality * Keith McHenry * Langar, a centuries-old tradition where vegetarian meals are supplied free of charge to the hungry at Sikh temples worldwide. * Langar (Sufism), an Islamic tradition where free food is provided. * Masbia, a humanitarian organization in Brooklyn. * Mole People * National Welfare Rights Organization * Really Really Free Market * One World Cafe * Pathways out of Poverty (POP) * Rumford's Soup * SAME Cafe * Social programs * Tent city * Thrift store * The Susso, welfare in Australia originating in the Great Depression. * Vegetarianism * Veganism * Volxkuche, a type of food kitchen with a secular / alternative culture character. == References == == Further reading == * * \\"Food Fight,\\" New Times Broward-Palm Beach * \\"Free Lunch,\\" Houston Press * \\"Diving for Dinner,\\" Washington Post == External links == * * Account of Food Not Bombs in Be‚Äôer Sheva, Israel * A Critical History of Harrisonburg Food Not Bombs by Peter Gelderloos * Across From City Hall 1989 video * Fugazi Free Concert Celebrating 20 Years of Food Not Bombs / San Francisco * Richmond Virginia Food Not Bombs Chapter Official Site Category:Peace organizations based in the United States Category:Anti‚ÄìIraq War groups Category:Hunger relief organizations Category:Anti-nuclear movement Category:International anarchist organizations Category:Anarcho-punk Category:Green anarchism Category:Veganism Category:DIY culture Category:Food waste ","title":"Food Not Bombs"},{"id":"522037","text":"frameless Mr. Yuk is a trademarked graphic image, created by UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, and widely employed in the United States in labeling of substances that are poisonous if ingested. ==Overview== The 1970s Mr. Yuk Public Service Announcement To help children learn to avoid ingesting poisons, Mr. Yuk was conceived by Dr. Richard Moriarty, a pediatrician and clinical professor of pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine who founded the Pittsburgh Poison Center and the National Poison Center Network. Moriarty felt that the traditional skull and crossbones representing poison was no longer appropriate for children; Congressman Bill Coyne later said that by the 1970s the symbol was \\"associated with swashbuckling pirates and buccaneers rather than with harmful substances.\\" The Jolly Roger flag was used on breakfast cereals and chewing gum, and it was the insignia for Moriarty's local major league baseball team, the Pittsburgh Pirates. The design and color were chosen when Moriarty used focus groups of young children to determine which combination was the most unappealing. Possible expressions were \\"mad\\" (crossed eyes and intense expression), \\"dead\\" (a sunken mouth and Xs for eyes), and \\"sick\\" (a sour expression with the tongue sticking out). Children were asked to rank the faces according to which they liked the best, along with the skull and crossbones, and the \\"sick\\" face was least popular. The shade of fluorescent green that was chosen was christened \\"Yucky!\\" by a young child and gave the design its name. Mr. Yuk was first introduced in Pittsburgh in 1971, and over the next few years, Mr. Yuk stickers gained nationwide The stickers usually contain phone numbers of poison control centers that may give guidance if poisoning has occurred or is suspected. Usually, stickers may carry a national toll-free number (1-800-222-1222 in the United States). In some areas, local poison control centers and children's hospitals issue stickers with local numbers, under license. Such an example is in Pittsburgh, where the telephone number for the Poison Control Center is 681‚Äì6669. A public service announcement was also produced in the 1970s featuring a theme song. ==Effectiveness== At least two peer-reviewed medical studies (Fergusson 1982, Vernberg 1984) have suggested that Mr. Yuk stickers do not effectively keep children away from potential poisons and may even attract children.Vernberg K, Culver-Dickinson P, Spyker DA. (1984). \\"The deterrent effect of poison-warning stickers\\". American Journal of Diseases of Children 138, 1018-1020\\\\. Specifically, Vernberg and colleagues note concerns for using the stickers to protect young children. Fergusson and colleagues state that \\"the method may be effective with older children or as an adjunct to an integrated poisoning prevention campaign\\".Fergusson DM, Horwood LJ, Beautrais AL, Shannon FT. (1982). \\"A controlled field trial of a poisoning prevention method\\". Pediatrics 69, 515-520\\\\. To evaluate the effectiveness of six projected symbols (skull-and-crossbones, red stop sign, and four others), tests were conducted at day care centers. Children in the program rated Mr. Yuk as the most unappealing image. By contrast, children rated the skull-and-crossbones to be the most appealing.Washington Poison Center The Mr. Ouch symbol, developed by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) to warn children about electrical hazards, has a similar design and strategy. ==Use restrictions== Mr. Yuk and his graphic rendering are registered trademarks and service marks of the UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, and the rendering itself is additionally protected by copyright. This means that the name and graphic image cannot be used without a license from the owner--unlike the skull and crossbones symbol, which is in the public domain. The Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC gives out free sheets of Mr. Yuk stickers if contacted by mail. Mr. Yuk materials can also be ordered online from the University of Pittsburgh. ==In popular culture == * Mr. Yuk has taken on a cult status throughout the city of Pittsburgh among older residents; the best example is the Ultimate Frisbee team at Carnegie Mellon University, which affectionately goes by \\"Mr. Yuk\\" and uses a variety of discs adorned with the classic logo.

Kettle's Yard galleries, shop and cafe are open Tuesday - Sunday, 11am - 5pm. The House is open Tuesday - Sunday, 12 - 5pm. Free, timed entry tickets to the House are available from the information desk. Online booking is coming soon. == History and overview == Castle Street Kettle's Yard House and Gallery lies on the west side of Castle Street, between Northampton Street and St Peter's Church. It was originally the Cambridge home of Jim Ede and his wife Helen. Moving to Cambridge in 1956, they converted four small cottages into one idiosyncratic house and a place to display Ede's collection of early 20th-century art. Ede maintained an 'open house' each afternoon, giving any visitors, particularly students, a personal tour of his collection. In 1966, Ede gave the house and collection to the University of Cambridge, but continued living there before he and his wife moved to Edinburgh in 1973. The house is preserved as the Edes left it, making a very informal space to enjoy the permanent collection and live music. In 1970, the house was extended, adding an exhibition gallery in a contrasting modernist style by Leslie Martin. The house and gallery temporarily closed in June 2015 during a major building project to create a four-floor education wing, improved exhibition galleries, a new entrance area and a caf√©. A series of gentle additions by Jamie Fobert Architects offers greatly improved support services for visitors, including a new courtyard and welcome area and a new shop. The project cost ¬£11,000,000 including ¬£2,320,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund and ¬£3,700,000 from Arts Council England. The interior of the house has been left untouched. During the closure, there were displays of the collection at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge and the Jerwood Gallery in Hastings. Kettle's Yard is part of the University of Cambridge Museums consortium. == Permanent collection == An exhibition of Diet Sayler in the gallery in 2000 Christopher Wood Self- portrait (1927) The permanent collection is composed of paintings, sculptures and objects collected by Ede. It is largely based on associations and friendships formed when Ede was a curator at Tate Gallery, and as such it is biased towards works from the British avant-garde of the first half of the 20th century.

This is just one example for linear tolerances for a 100 mm value. This is just one of the 8 defined ranges (30‚Äì120mm). Engineering tolerance is the permissible limit or limits of variation in: # a physical dimension; # a measured value or physical property of a material, manufactured object, system, or service; # other measured values (such as temperature, humidity, etc.); # in engineering and safety, a physical distance or space (tolerance), as in a truck (lorry), train or boat under a bridge as well as a train in a tunnel (see structure gauge and loading gauge); # in mechanical engineering the space between a bolt and a nut or a hole, etc. Dimensions, properties, or conditions may have some variation without significantly affecting functioning of systems, machines, structures, etc. A variation beyond the tolerance (for example, a temperature that is too hot or too cold) is said to be noncompliant, rejected, or exceeding the tolerance. ==Considerations when setting tolerances== A primary concern is to determine how wide the tolerances may be without affecting other factors or the outcome of a process. This can be by the use of scientific principles, engineering knowledge, and professional experience. Experimental investigation is very useful to investigate the effects of tolerances: Design of experiments, formal engineering evaluations, etc. A good set of engineering tolerances in a specification, by itself, does not imply that compliance with those tolerances will be achieved. Actual production of any product (or operation of any system) involves some inherent variation of input and output. Measurement error and statistical uncertainty are also present in all measurements. With a normal distribution, the tails of measured values may extend well beyond plus and minus three standard deviations from the process average. Appreciable portions of one (or both) tails might extend beyond the specified tolerance. The process capability of systems, materials, and products needs to be compatible with the specified engineering tolerances. Process controls must be in place and an effective Quality management system, such as Total Quality Management, needs to keep actual production within the desired tolerances. A process capability index is used to indicate the relationship between tolerances and actual measured production. The choice of tolerances is also affected by the intended statistical sampling plan and its characteristics such as the Acceptable Quality Level. This relates to the question of whether tolerances must be extremely rigid (high confidence in 100% conformance) or whether some small percentage of being out-of-tolerance may sometimes be acceptable. ==An alternative view of tolerances== Genichi Taguchi and others have suggested that traditional two-sided tolerancing is analogous to \\"goal posts\\" in a football game: It implies that all data within those tolerances are equally acceptable. The alternative is that the best product has a measurement which is precisely on target. There is an increasing loss which is a function of the deviation or variability from the target value of any design parameter. The greater the deviation from target, the greater is the loss. This is described as the Taguchi loss function or quality loss function, and it is the key principle of an alternative system called inertial tolerancing. Research and development work conducted by M. Pillet and colleaguesPillet M., Adragna P-A., Germain F., Inertial Tolerancing: \\"The Sorting Problem\\", Journal of Machine Engineering : Manufacturing Accuracy Increasing Problems, optimization, Vol. 6, No. 1, 2006, pp. 95-102. at the Savoy University has resulted in industry-specific adoption. Recently the publishing of the French standard NFX 04-008 has allowed further consideration by the manufacturing community. == Mechanical component tolerance == Summary of basic size, fundamental deviation and IT grades compared to minimum and maximum sizes of the shaft and hole. Dimensional tolerance is related to, but different from fit in mechanical engineering, which is a designed-in clearance or interference between two parts. Tolerances are assigned to parts for manufacturing purposes, as boundaries for acceptable build. No machine can hold dimensions precisely to the nominal value, so there must be acceptable degrees of variation. If a part is manufactured, but has dimensions that are out of tolerance, it is not a usable part according to the design intent. Tolerances can be applied to any dimension. The commonly used terms are: ; Basic size: The nominal diameter of the shaft (or bolt) and the hole. This is, in general, the same for both components. ; Lower deviation: The difference between the minimum possible component size and the basic size. ; Upper deviation: The difference between the maximum possible component size and the basic size. ; Fundamental deviation: The minimum difference in size between a component and the basic size. This is identical to the upper deviation for shafts and the lower deviation for holes. If the fundamental deviation is greater than zero, the bolt will always be smaller than the basic size and the hole will always be wider. Fundamental deviation is a form of allowance, rather than tolerance. ; International Tolerance grade: This is a standardised measure of the maximum difference in size between the component and the basic size (see below). For example, if a shaft with a nominal diameter of 10mm is to have a sliding fit within a hole, the shaft might be specified with a tolerance range from 9.964 to 10 mm (i.e., a zero fundamental deviation, but a lower deviation of 0.036 mm) and the hole might be specified with a tolerance range from 10.04 mm to 10.076 mm (0.04 mm fundamental deviation and 0.076 mm upper deviation). This would provide a clearance fit of somewhere between 0.04 mm (largest shaft paired with the smallest hole, called the Maximum Material Condition - MMC) and 0.112 mm (smallest shaft paired with the largest hole, Least Material Condition - LMC). In this case the size of the tolerance range for both the shaft and hole is chosen to be the same (0.036 mm), meaning that both components have the same International Tolerance grade but this need not be the case in general. When no other tolerances are provided, the machining industry uses the following standard tolerances:2, 3 and 4 decimal places quoted from page 29 of \\"Machine Tool Practices\\", 6th edition, by R.R.; Kibbe, J.E.; Neely, R.O.; Meyer & W.T.; White, , 2nd printing, copyright 1999, 1995, 1991, 1987, 1982 and 1979 by Prentice Hall. (All four places, including the single decimal place, are common knowledge in the field, although a reference for the single place could not be found.)According to Chris McCauley, Editor-In-Chief of Industrial Press' Machinery's Handbook: Standard Tolerance \\"‚Ä¶does not appear to originate with any of the recent editions (24-28) of Machinery's Handbook, although those tolerances may have been mentioned somewhere in one of the many old editions of the Handbook.\\" (4/24/2009 8:47 AM) { border=\\"0\\" -  style=\\"padding- left:2em;\\"  1 decimal place  (.x):  ¬±0.2\\" -  style=\\"padding-left:2em;\\"  2 decimal places  (.0x):  ¬±0.01\\" -  style=\\"padding-left:2em;\\"  3 decimal places  (.00x):  ¬±0.005\\" -  style=\\"padding-left:2em;\\"  4 decimal places  (.000x):  ¬±0.0005\\" } Limits and fits establish in 1980, not corresponding to the current ISO tolerances ===International Tolerance grades=== When designing mechanical components, a system of standardized tolerances called International Tolerance grades are often used. The standard (size) tolerances are divided into two categories: hole and shaft. They are labelled with a letter (capitals for holes and lowercase for shafts) and a number. For example: H7 (hole, tapped hole, or nut) and h7 (shaft or bolt). H7/h6 is a very common standard tolerance which gives a tight fit. The tolerances work in such a way that for a hole H7 means that the hole should be made slightly larger than the base dimension (in this case for an ISO fit 10+0.015‚àí0, meaning that it may be up to 0.015 mm larger than the base dimension, and 0 mm smaller). The actual amount bigger/smaller depends on the base dimension. For a shaft of the same size, h6 would mean 10+0‚àí0.009, which means the shaft may be as small as 0.009 mm smaller than the base dimension and 0 mm larger. This method of standard tolerances is also known as Limits and Fits and can be found in ISO 286-1:2010 (Link to ISO catalog). The table below summarises the International Tolerance (IT) grades and the general applications of these grades: An analysis of fit by statistical interference is also extremely useful: It indicates the frequency (or probability) of parts properly fitting together. == Electrical component tolerance == An electrical specification might call for a resistor with a nominal value of 100 Œ© (ohms), but will also state a tolerance such as \\"¬±1%\\". This means that any resistor with a value in the range 99‚Äì101Œ© is acceptable. For critical components, one might specify that the actual resistance must remain within tolerance within a specified temperature range, over a specified lifetime, and so on. Many commercially available resistors and capacitors of standard types, and some small inductors, are often marked with coloured bands to indicate their value and the tolerance. High-precision components of non-standard values may have numerical information printed on them. ==Difference between allowance and tolerance== The terms are often confused but sometimes a difference is maintained. See Allowance (engineering)#Confounding of the engineering concepts of allowance and tolerance. ==Clearance (civil engineering)== In civil engineering, clearance refers to the difference between the loading gauge and the structure gauge in the case of railroad cars or trams, or the difference between the size of any vehicle and the width/height doors, the width/height of an overpass or the diameter of a tunnel as well as the air draft under a bridge, the width of a lock or diameter of a tunnel in the case of watercraft. In addition there is the difference between the deep draft and the stream bed or sea bed of a waterway. ==See also== *Backlash (engineering) *Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing *Engineering fit *Key relevance * Loading gauge *Margin of error *Precision engineering *Probabilistic design *Process capability * Slack action *Specification (technical standard) *Statistical process control *Statistical tolerance * Structure gauge *Taguchi methods *Tolerance coning *Tolerance interval *Tolerance stacks *Verification and validation ==Notes== ==Further reading== * Pyzdek, T, \\"Quality Engineering Handbook\\", 2003, * Godfrey, A.

He worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Ostro led radar observations of numerous asteroids, as well as the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, Saturn's rings, and Mars and its satellites. As of May 2008, Ostro and his collaborators had detected 222 near-Earth asteroids (including 130 potentially hazardous objects and 24 binaries) and 118 main belt objects with radar. He died December 15, 2008, due to complications related to cancer. He has been remembered fondly by his colleagues for both his personal and professional contributions. ==Education and employment== Ostro received an A.B. in liberal arts and a B.S. in ceramic science from Rutgers University in 1969, a Master's in engineering physics from Cornell University in 1974, and his Ph.D in planetary science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1978. At MIT, Ostro was advised by Gordon Pettengill and Irwin I. Shapiro and studied the radar scattering properties of Saturn's rings and the Galilean satellites using the Arecibo Observatory. After completing his graduate work and a year in postdoctoral research at MIT, Ostro served as an assistant professor of astronomy at Cornell before moving to JPL in 1984. Ostro headed JPL's Asteroid Radar group, and was a member of the Cassini‚ÄìHuygens RADAR team, studying the moons of Saturn. In 2008, Ostro was elected a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union, awarded for acknowledged eminence in the Earth and Space sciences. ==Asteroid radar astronomy== Animation of 66391 Moshup, also known as 1999 KW4, a binary near- Earth asteroid observed by Ostro and his collaborators. This shape model was obtained by inversion of radar images. Much of Ostro's career focused on the development of asteroid radar astronomy. In early experiments, such as the first radar detection of Ceres, radar observations of asteroids were restricted to measurements of Doppler shifts and radar cross-sections. Beginning in the early 1980s, Ostro led the development of radar imaging and shape-reconstruction techniques, first determining only outer limits of targets' shapes, then deriving three-dimensional shape models. From August 19 to 22 of 1989, Ostro and Scott Hudson observed the contact binary 4769 Castalia from the Arecibo Observatory, producing the first resolved radar images of an asteroid, which they later used to construct a model of the object. Following the further development of imaging and shape reconstruction techniques by Ostro, Hudson, and Christopher Magri, and the upgrade of Arecibo in the mid-1990s, the number of radar observations increased dramatically. ==Asteroid impact hazard== Ostro was an early participant in discussion of the asteroid impact hazard, placing particular emphasis on the need to characterize asteroids before any deflection attempt. In a paper with Carl Sagan, Ostro noted that while the asteroid impact hazard is a long-term risk to any civilization, the risk associated with maintaining an active deflection program is higher, because it is just as easy to deflect an asteroid to impact Earth as to prevent it from doing so. Ostro advocated for continued funding of the Arecibo Planetary Radar, on both hazard and scientific grounds. ==Notable asteroids observed by Ostro include== *216 Kleopatra ‚Äì a large main-belt asteroid, the first asteroid confirmed to have a surface composition of nickel-iron. *1986 DA ‚Äì the first near-Earth asteroid confirmed to be metallic. The estimated amount of platinum-group metals in 1986 DA is comparable to that in the Bushveld Igneous Complex, the largest source on Earth's surface. *4769 Castalia ‚Äì the first near-Earth asteroid imaged well enough to determine its shape, which is two distinct 0.9 km lobes in contact (a contact binary). *4179 Toutatis ‚Äì a contact binary asteroid that is in a non-principal axis rotation state. * ‚Äì a large near-Earth asteroid that rotates exceptionally slowly. * ‚Äì a very small (30 m wide) asteroid that spins so quickly that it has negative effective gravity. *66391 Moshup ‚Äì one of the first binary near-Earth asteroids known. The shape of the primary (alpha) has been determined by inversion of radar images. This enabled studies of the orbital evolution of the secondary (beta), which is in turn coupled to the system's orbit around the Sun by radiation forces. *6489 Golevka ‚Äì the first asteroid for which the Yarkovsky effect (radiation force changing the orbit) was measured. *1950 DA ‚Äì an approximately 1 km wide asteroid with a possible Earth impact in 2880. *99942 Apophis ‚Äì a near-Earth asteroid that will pass within geosynchronous orbit in 2029. Radar astrometry from observations by Ostro's group have been essential to predicting Apophis' trajectory. To explore the dynamical implications of these observations in detail, Ostro collaborated with Steven Chesley, Jon D. Giorgini, Scott Hudson, Jean-Luc Margot, and Daniel J. Scheeres. Radar provides extremely accurate measurement of the positions and velocities of target objects, and such astrometry of near-Earth objects has been recognized as crucial to dealing with the impact hazard. In many cases, radar astrometry has excluded possible Earth impacts from trajectory predictions years before optical astrometry would have been able to do so. ==Work on other objects== Ostro worked on radar observations of the icy satellites of Jupiter and Saturn, particularly with the Cassini- Huygens RADAR instrument. Radar observations of Mars' moons, Phobos and Deimos, have refined knowledge of their orbits and show that their surfaces are coated with very low density (~1 g/cm3) material, most likely fine-grain dust, to a depth of several meters. ==HonorsAwards=== * Gerard P.

A sulfonate is a salt or ester of a sulfonic acid. It contains the functional group R-SO3‚àí, where R is an organic group. Sulfonates are the conjugate base of sulfonic acids. Sulfonates are generally stable in water, non-oxidizing, and colorless. Many useful compounds and even some biochemicals feature sulfonates. ==Sulfonate salts== Alkylbenzene sulfonates are detergents found in shampoos, toothpaste laundry detergent, dishwashing liquid, etc. Anions with the general formula RSO3‚àí are called sulfonates. They are the conjugate bases of sulfonic acids with formula RSO2OH. As sulfonic acids tend to be strong acids, the corresponding sulfonates are weak bases. Due to the stability of sulfonate anions, the cations of sulfonate salts such as scandium triflate have application as Lewis acids. A classic organic reaction for the preparation of sulfonates is that of alkyl halides with sulfites such as sodium sulfite, first described by Adolph Strecker in 1868 (Strecker sulfite alkylation).Ueber eine neue Bildungsweise und die Constitution der Sulfos√§uren Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie Volume 148, Issue 1, Pages 90 - 96 (p 90-96) 1868 The general reaction is: ::RX + M2SO3 ‚Üí RSO3M + MX Iodide is used as a catalyst. Water-softening usually involves removal of calcium ions in water using a sulfonated ion-exchange resin. ==Sulfonic esters== Esters with the general formula R1SO2OR2 are called sulfonic esters. Individual members of the category are named analogously to how ordinary carboxyl esters are named. For example, if the R2 group is a methyl group and the R1 group is a trifluoromethyl group, the resulting compound is methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate. Sulfonic esters are used as reagents in organic synthesis, chiefly because the RSO3‚àí group is a good leaving group, especially when R is electron-withdrawing. Methyl triflate, for example, is a strong methylating reagent. Sulfonates are commonly used to confer water solubility to protein crosslinkers such as N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (Sulfo-NHS), BS3, Sulfo-SMCC, etc. ===Sultones=== Propane-1,3-sultone Cyclic sulfonic esters are called sultones.R. J. Cremlyn ‚ÄúAn Introduction to Organosulfur Chemistry‚Äù John Wiley and Sons: Chichester (1996) One example is propane-1,3-sultone. Some sultones are short-lived intermediates, used as strong alkylating agents to introduce a negatively charged sulfonate group. In the presence of water, they slowly hydrolyze to the hydroxy sulfonic acids. Sultone oximes are key intermediates in the synthesis of the anti-convulsant drug zonisamide. Tisocromide is an example of a sultone. ==Examples== *Mesylate (methanesulfonate), CH3SO3‚àí *Triflate (trifluoromethanesulfonate), CF3SO3‚àí *Ethanesulfonate (esilate, esylate), C2H5SO3‚àí *Tosylate (p-toluenesulfonate), CH3C6H4SO3‚àí *Benzenesulfonic acid (besylate), C6H5SO3‚àí *Closilate (closylate, chlorobenzenesulfonate), ClC6H4SO3‚àí *Camphorsulfonate (camsilate, camsylate), (C10H15O)SO3‚àí *Pipsylate (p-iodobenzenesulfonate derivative). *Nosylate ==See also== *Sulfate *Sulfoxide *Sulfonyl ==References== Category:Functional groups Category:Leaving groups ","title":"Sulfonate"},{"id":"522076","text":"Raymond Scott Hudson (born 1959) is a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at Washington State University.

This pathway is responsible for the deamination of most amino acids. This is one of the major degradation pathways which convert essential amino acids to non-essential amino acids (amino acids that can be synthesized de novo by the organism). Transamination in biochemistry is accomplished by enzymes called transaminases or aminotransferases. Œ±-ketoglutarate acts as the predominant amino-group acceptor and produces glutamate as the new amino acid. :Aminoacid + Œ±-ketoglutarate ‚Üî Œ±-keto acid + Glutamate Glutamate's amino group, in turn, is transferred to oxaloacetate in a second transamination reaction yielding aspartate. :Glutamate + oxaloacetate ‚Üî Œ±-ketoglutarate + aspartate ==Mechanism of Action== Transamination catalyzed by aminotransferase occurs in two stages. In the first step, the Œ± amino group of an amino acid is transferred to the enzyme, producing the corresponding Œ±-keto acid and the aminated enzyme. During the second stage, the amino group is transferred to the keto acid acceptor, forming the amino acid product while regenerating the enzyme. The chirality of an amino acid is determined during transamination. For the reaction to complete, aminotransferases require participation of aldehyde containing coenzyme, pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP), a derivative of Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6). The amino group is accommodated by conversion of this coenzyme to pyridoxamine-5'-phosphate (PMP). PLP is covalently attached to the enzyme via a Schiff Base linkage formed by the condensation of its aldehyde group with the Œµ-amino group of an enzymatic Lys residue. The Schiff base, which is conjugated to the enzymes pyridinium ring is the focus of the coenzyme activity. :Ping Pong Bi Bi mechanism of PLP dependent enzyme catalyzed transamination. Aminotransferase reaction occurs in two stages consisting of three steps: Transimination, Tautomerisation and Hydolysis. In the first stage, alpha amino group of the aminoacid is transferred to PLP yielding an alpha ketoacid and PMP. In the second stage of the reaction, in which the amino group of PMP is transferred to a different alpha Ketoacid to yield a new alpha amino acid and PLP.The product of transamination reactions depend on the availability of Œ±-keto acids. The products usually are either alanine, aspartate or glutamate, since their corresponding alpha-keto acids are produced through metabolism of fuels. Being a major degradative aminoacid pathway, lysine, proline and threonine are the only three amino acids that do not always undergo transamination and rather use respective dehydrogenase. :Alternative Mechanism :A second type of transamination reaction can be described as a nucleophilic substitution of one amine or amide anion on an amine or ammonium salt. For example, the attack of a primary amine by a primary amide anion can be used to prepare secondary amines: :RNH2 \\\\+ R'NH‚àí ‚Üí RR'NH + NH2‚àí :Symmetric secondary amines can be prepared using Raney nickel (2RNH2 ‚Üí R2NH + NH3). And finally, quaternary ammonium salts can be dealkylated using ethanolamine: :R4N+ \\\\+ NH2CH2CH2OH ‚Üí R3N + RN+H2CH2CH2OH :Aminonaphthalenes also undergo transaminations.[2] ==Types of aminotransferase== Transamination is mediated by several different aminotransferase enzymes. These may be specific for individual amino acids, or they may be able to process a group of chemically similar ones. The latter applies to the group of the branched-chain amino acids, which comprises leucine, isoleucine, and valine. The two common types of aminotransferases are Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST). ==References== ‚Ä¢ Smith, M. B. and March, J.

They live in small family groups containing at least one adult male and female, with one or two immature birds, though they sometimes gather in larger flocks to exploit a major food supply such as an ant or termite nest. The birds are occasionally preyed upon by crowned hawk-eagles, and they respond to the presence of an eagle (sometimes indicated by its characteristic shriek) by mobbing ‚Äì approaching it and emitting calls. Since the eagles depend on surprise to make a catch, this frequently causes them to leave the area.

Although officially titled the City Business Stadium in the early 1990s, it remained known almost exclusively by its address, like many English football stadiums. == History  Early years === Leicester City was formed in 1884. The club was then named Leicester Fosse, as its founders mostly lived in the west end of the city, through which the Fosse Way ran. In 1884-85 it played at a ground known as the Racecourse, before sharing Victoria Park with the Leicester Tigers rugby club for two years. Leicester Fosse played at the Belgrave Road Cycle Track for a year, but returned to Victoria Park after the rugby club offered a higher rent to the owners of the Cycle Track. Leicester Fosse became a professional club in 1889 and laid out its own ground at Mill Lane, just north of Filbert Street. The club was soon forced to move, however, as the local Corporation requested the land for development. The site of what was to become Filbert Street was prepared during the summer of 1891, while Leicester Fosse temporarily played at the Aylestone Road Cricket Ground. Local legend suggests that the new ground was identified by a Miss Westland, the niece of one of the club's founders, Joseph Johnson. The stadium initially consisted of simple earth banks and a small main stand on the west side, until 1921, when a new and much larger main stand was built. In 1927, a new stand was built at the south end (known as the Spion Kop), and became known as the \\"Double Decker\\". The roof which had previously covered the Kop was rebuilt at the north, or Filbert Street end of the ground. It was in this form that Filbert Street saw its record attendance of 47,298 for the Fifth Round FA Cup tie, against Tottenham Hotspur, on 18 February 1928. This game also saw many more spectators watch the match from the roof of the Filbert Street end. The first phase of ground development concluded with the covering of the East or Popular side in 1939. === Second World War and after === The middle section of the Main Stand suffered bomb damage in 1940, and was later further damaged by a serious fire. By 1949, the stand had been rebuilt, with much of the labour, ironically, being supplied by German POWs at a nearby camp. The ground's maximum capacity was now around 42,000. Floodlights were installed and first used for a match against German club Borussia Dortmund in October 1957. After just surviving a council vote to terminate their lease in the late 1940s, City purchased the freehold of the ground in 1962, for the sum of ¬£30,500. In 1971, the first moves towards an all-seater stadium were taken, as the North and East sides were converted to seating. Four years later, 20 basic executive boxes were added to the North Stand. A pioneering polythene cover was introduced to protect the pitch in 1971. The Air Dome covered an area of 90,000 square feet, weighed 24 cwt and took 15 men two hours to lay out and inflate using four electric fans. The Air Dome was removed in 1982. === All- seater stadium === At the beginning of the 1990s, after considering moving to a new stadium, and a total redevelopment of Filbert Street which would have seen the pitch rotated by 90 degrees, onto the car park behind the Main Stand, City opted to build a new Main Stand, demolishing the existing structure in the summer of 1992. It was anticipated that further modernisation work would take place in the future. Completed in December 1993, the Carling Stand held 9,500 seated spectators and expanded corporate facilities, costing ¬£6 million. In 1994, the final terraced area ‚Äì the Kop ‚Äì was converted to seating giving Filbert Street an all-seated capacity of 21,500, and bringing it into compliance with the Taylor Report which required all Premier League and Division One teams to have all-seater capacity. === Move and demolition === Following the success of the club under Martin O'Neill during the later part of the 1990s, an expanded stadium was required for higher attendances and to provide better facilities. Expansion of Filbert Street would have been very difficult, as the North and East Stands backed onto housing which would have been expensive to place under a compulsory purchase order. Although expansion was considered, by 1998 the decision had been taken to move to a completely new stadium. After a failed attempt to build a 40,000 all-seater stadium at Bede Island South (on the other bank of the nearby River Soar), the club purchased Freeman's Wharf, a former power station site 200 yards south of Filbert Street. Work began on a 32,500 seater stadium during 2001 and it was opened in July 2002. Filbert Street was sold to a development company for ¬£3.75 million in March 2002, two months before the last game was played there. The last game to be played at Filbert Street was the last game of the 2001-02 season, a 2‚Äì1 victory against Tottenham Hotspur - one of just five league games that Leicester won during that season, culminating in relegation to Division One. Matt Piper scored the last goal scored at the ground, bringing to an end 111 years of football there. In the autumn of 2002, Rotherham United expressed interest in purchasing the Carling Stand and moving it to their Millmoor stadium, but these plans were soon abandoned and the decade-old stand would soon be demolished along with the rest of Filbert Street. Demolition of Filbert Street was begun in March 2003. Part of the site is now home to the 'Filbert Village' development, built as accommodation for students for the nearby De Montfort University and University of Leicester. The road running through the development is called Lineker Road, named after one of Leicester City's most famous players. The rest of the site was meant to be developed for housing, but this work was cancelled due to the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. It was then leased to a car parking company, but this arrangement was terminated by Leicester City Council in March 2012. ==References== ;Sources * == External links == * Filbert Street history * Filbert Street Gallery and Information @worldstadia.com * Demolition of Filbert Street *Football Grounds Guide Article Category:Defunct football venues in England Category:Leicester City F.C.

Kennedy in Dallas, Texas. On August 27, 1978, The Dallas Morning News published an article by Earl Golz alleging that several \\"counterfeit\\" agents of the United States Secret Service were in Dealey Plaza shortly before and after the assassination. The following day, the story was reported by the Associated Press and United Press International. According to the report, Arnold and at least four other individuals said they met men who identified themselves as Secret Service agents. Arnold stated that he was attempting to move to the railroad bridge above the triple underpass to film the presidential limousine and motorcade when a man with a badge who said he was with the Secret Service told him that he could not be there (although in a video interview in the 1988 documentary film The Men Who Killed Kennedy, Gordon stated the man identified himself as being with the CIA). According to Arnold in that interview, he moved to a dirt mound in front of the picket fence on the \\"grassy knoll\\" where he filmed the motorcade as it moved down Elm Street. He described at least one shot as being fired past his left ear from behind, stating that he \\"hit the dirt\\" after feeling the first just over his left shoulder, and that while lying down his impression was that at least one more shot came from that location, although he said he heard the echoes of gunfire through the Plaza which made it difficult to determine the source of the other shot(s) with certainty. Arnold indicated that he remained lying down for the duration of the shooting until he was confronted by two policemen who confiscated his film and ordered him to leave the area. However, in The Men Who Killed Kennedy, Arnold mentioned that the film was confiscated by a man wearing a policeman's uniform, except with no hat. He suggested that he had been afraid to report the incident due to claims of \\"peculiar\\" deaths of witnesses to the assassination. According to the report, at the time of the assassination Arnold was a soldier who had just completed basic training and was reporting for duty in Fort Wainwright, Alaska two days later. In 1978, he was an investigator with the Dallas Department of Consumer Affairs. Arnold was later interviewed for The Men Who Killed Kennedy. According to a 2013 article published in the Dallas News, in 1982, Gary Mack, the former curator of the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, initially believed Arnold to be the Badge Man figure in Mary Moorman's polaroid photograph. == External links == * Nowhere Man: The Strange Story of Gordon Arnold. ==References== Category:1941 births Category:1997 deaths Category:Military personnel from Dallas Category:United States Army personnel Category:Witnesses to the assassination of John F.

Some ions and molecules can undergo more than one protonation and are labeled polybasic, which is true of many biological macromolecules. Protonation and deprotonation (removal of a proton) occur in most acid‚Äìbase reactions; they are the core of most acid‚Äìbase reaction theories. A Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry acid is defined as a chemical substance that protonates another substance. Upon protonating a substrate, the mass and the charge of the species each increase by one unit, making it an essential step in certain analytical procedures such as electrospray mass spectrometry. Protonating or deprotonating a molecule or ion can change many other chemical properties, not just the charge and mass, for example hydrophilicity, reduction potential, and optical properties can change. ==Rates of protonation and deprotonation== Protonations are often rapid, partly because of the high mobility of protons in many solvents. The rate of protonation is related to the acidity of the protonating species: protonation by weak acids is slower than protonation of the same base by strong acids. The rates of protonation and deprotonation can be especially slow when protonation induces significant structural changes. ==Reversibility and catalysis== Protonation is usually reversible, and the structure and bonding of the conjugate base are normally unchanged on protonation. In some cases, however, protonation induces isomerization, for example cis-alkenes can be converted to trans-alkenes using a catalytic amount of protonating agent. Many enzymes, such as the serine hydrolases, operate by mechanisms that involve reversible protonation of substrates. ==See also== *Acid dissociation constant *Deprotonation (or dehydronation) *Molecular autoionization ==References== Category:Chemical reactions Category:Reaction mechanisms ","title":"Protonation"},{"id":"522141","text":"Josaphat can refer to: == People == * Jehoshaphat, in the Bible, fourth king of the Kingdom of Judah * Josaphat, a Christian saint of India, appearing in the legend of Barlaam and Josaphat * Giosafat Barbaro (1413‚Äì94), Venetian explorer and diplomat * Josephat T.

Euler's formula, with n taking the values 1,... 40 is equivalent to :n^2 + n + 41, \\\\, with n taking the values 0,... 39, and RabinowitzRabinovitch, Georg \\"Eindeutigkeit der Zerlegung in Primzahlfaktoren in quadratischen Zahlk√∂rpern.\\" Proc.

(Note that p-1 yields p^2, so p-2 is maximal.) 1, 2, and 3 are not of the required form, so the Heegner numbers that work are 7, 11, 19, 43, 67, 163, yielding prime generating functions of Euler's form for 2,3,5,11,17,41; these latter numbers are called lucky numbers of Euler by F.

This number was discovered in 1859 by the mathematician Charles Hermite. In a 1975 April Fool article in Scientific American magazine, \\"Mathematical Games\\" columnist Martin Gardner made the hoax claim that the number was in fact an integer, and that the Indian mathematical genius Srinivasa Ramanujan had predicted it‚Äîhence its name. This coincidence is explained by complex multiplication and the q-expansion of the j-invariant. ===Detail=== Briefly, j((1+\\\\sqrt{-d})/2) is an integer for d a Heegner number, and e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{d}} \\\\approx -j((1+\\\\sqrt{-d})/2) + 744 via the q-expansion. If \\\\tau is a quadratic irrational, then the j-invariant is an algebraic integer of degree \\\\mbox{Cl}(\\\\mathbf{Q}(\\\\tau)), the class number of \\\\mathbf{Q}(\\\\tau) and the minimal (monic integral) polynomial it satisfies is called the 'Hilbert class polynomial'. Thus if the imaginary quadratic extension \\\\mathbf{Q}(\\\\tau) has class number 1 (so d is a Heegner number), the j-invariant is an integer. The q-expansion of j, with its Fourier series expansion written as a Laurent series in terms of q=\\\\exp(2 \\\\pi i \\\\tau), begins as: :j(\\\\tau) = \\\\frac{1}{q} + 744 + 196\\\\,884 q + \\\\cdots. The coefficients c_n asymptotically grow as \\\\ln(c_n) \\\\sim 4\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{n} + O(\\\\ln(n)), and the low order coefficients grow more slowly than 200\\\\,000^n, so for q \\\\ll 1/200\\\\,000, j is very well approximated by its first two terms. Setting \\\\tau = (1+\\\\sqrt{-163})/2 yields q=-\\\\exp(-\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{163}) or equivalently, \\\\frac{1}{q}=-\\\\exp(\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{163}). Now j((1+\\\\sqrt{-163})/2)=(-640\\\\,320)^3, so, :(-640\\\\,320)^3=-e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{163}}+744+O\\\\left(e^{-\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{163}}\\\\right). Or, :e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{163}}=640\\\\,320^3+744+O\\\\left(e^{-\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{163}}\\\\right) where the linear term of the error is, :-196\\\\,884/e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{163}} \\\\approx -196\\\\,884/(640\\\\,320^3+744) \\\\approx -0.000\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,75 explaining why e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{163}} is within approximately the above of being an integer. ==Pi formulas== The Chudnovsky brothers found in 1987 that :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi} = \\\\frac{12}{640\\\\,320^{3/2}} \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(6k)! (163 \\\\cdot 3\\\\,344\\\\,418k + 13\\\\,591\\\\,409)}{(3k)!(k!)^3 (-640\\\\,320)^{3k}} which uses the fact that j\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{1+\\\\sqrt{-163}}{2}\\\\right) = -640\\\\,320^3. For similar formulas, see the Ramanujan‚ÄìSato series. ==Other Heegner numbers== For the four largest Heegner numbers, the approximations one obtainsThese can be checked by computing \\\\sqrt[3]{e^{\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{d}}-744} on a calculator, and 196\\\\,884/e^{\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{d}} for the linear term of the error. are as follows. :\\\\begin{align} e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{19}} &\\\\approx 96^3+744-0.22\\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{43}} &\\\\approx 960^3+744-0.000\\\\,22\\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{67}} &\\\\approx 5\\\\,280^3+744-0.000\\\\,0013\\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{163}} &\\\\approx 640\\\\,320^3+744-0.000\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,75 \\\\end{align} Alternatively,http://groups.google.com.ph/group/sci.math.research/browse_thread/thread/3d24137c9a860893?hl=en# :\\\\begin{align} e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{19}} &\\\\approx 12^3(3^2-1)^3+744-0.22\\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{43}} &\\\\approx 12^3(9^2-1)^3+744-0.000\\\\,22\\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{67}} &\\\\approx 12^3(21^2-1)^3+744-0.000\\\\,0013\\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{163}} &\\\\approx 12^3(231^2-1)^3+744-0.000\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,75 \\\\end{align} where the reason for the squares is due to certain Eisenstein series. For Heegner numbers d < 19, one does not obtain an almost integer; even d = 19 is not noteworthy.The absolute deviation of a random real number (picked uniformly from , say) is a uniformly distributed variable on , so it has absolute average deviation and median absolute deviation of 0.25, and a deviation of 0.22 is not exceptional. The integer j-invariants are highly factorisable, which follows from the 12^3(n^2-1)^3=(2^2\\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot (n-1) \\\\cdot (n+1))^3 form, and factor as, :\\\\begin{align} j((1+\\\\sqrt{-19})/2) &= 96^3 =(2^5 \\\\cdot 3)^3\\\\\\\\\\\\ j((1+\\\\sqrt{-43})/2) &= 960^3=(2^6 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 5)^3\\\\\\\\\\\\ j((1+\\\\sqrt{-67})/2) & =5\\\\,280^3=(2^5 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 5 \\\\cdot 11)^3\\\\\\\\\\\\ j((1+\\\\sqrt{-163})/2) &=640\\\\,320^3=(2^6 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 5 \\\\cdot 23 \\\\cdot 29)^3. \\\\end{align} These transcendental numbers, in addition to being closely approximated by integers (which are simply algebraic numbers of degree 1), can be closely approximated by algebraic numbers of degree 3, :\\\\begin{align} e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{19}} &\\\\approx x^{24}-24.000\\\\,31 ;\\\\ \\\\ \\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad x^3-2x-2=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{43}} &\\\\approx x^{24}-24.000\\\\,000\\\\,31 ;\\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\quad x^3-2x^2-2=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{67}} &\\\\approx x^{24}-24.000\\\\,000\\\\,001\\\\,9 ;\\\\qquad\\\\qquad x^3-2x^2-2x-2=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{163}} &\\\\approx x^{24}-24.000\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,0011 ;\\\\quad x^3-6x^2+4x-2=0 \\\\end{align} The roots of the cubics can be exactly given by quotients of the Dedekind eta function Œ∑(œÑ), a modular function involving a 24th root, and which explains the 24 in the approximation. They can also be closely approximated by algebraic numbers of degree 4, :\\\\begin{align} e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{19}} &\\\\approx 3^5 \\\\left(3-\\\\sqrt{2(1- 96/24+1\\\\sqrt{3\\\\cdot19})} \\\\right)^{-2}-12.000\\\\,06\\\\dots\\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{43}} &\\\\approx 3^5 \\\\left(9-\\\\sqrt{2(1- 960/24+7\\\\sqrt{3\\\\cdot43})} \\\\right)^{-2}-12.000\\\\,000\\\\,061\\\\dots\\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{67}} &\\\\approx 3^5 \\\\left(21-\\\\sqrt{2(1- 5\\\\,280/24 +31\\\\sqrt{3\\\\cdot67})} \\\\right)^{-2}-12.000\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,36\\\\dots\\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{163}} &\\\\approx 3^5 \\\\left(231-\\\\sqrt{2(1- 640\\\\,320/24+2\\\\,413\\\\sqrt{3\\\\cdot163})} \\\\right)^{-2}-12.000\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,21\\\\dots \\\\end{align} If x denotes the expression in the parenthesis (e.g. x=3-\\\\sqrt{2(1- 96/24+1\\\\sqrt{3\\\\cdot19})}), it satisfies respectively the quartic equations :\\\\begin{align} &x;^4 - 4\\\\cdot 3 x^3 + \\\\tfrac23( 96 +3) x^2 \\\\qquad\\\\quad- \\\\tfrac23\\\\cdot3(96-6)x - 3=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ &x;^4 - 4\\\\cdot 9x^3 + \\\\tfrac23( 960 +3) x^2\\\\ \\\\ \\\\quad\\\\quad- \\\\tfrac23\\\\cdot9(960-6)x - 3=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ &x;^4 - 4\\\\cdot 21x^3 + \\\\tfrac23( 5\\\\,280 +3) x^2\\\\quad\\\\ \\\\;- \\\\tfrac23\\\\cdot21(5\\\\,280-6)x - 3=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ &x;^4 - 4\\\\cdot 231x^3 + \\\\tfrac23( 640\\\\,320 +3) x^2 - \\\\tfrac23\\\\cdot231(640\\\\,320-6)x - 3=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} Note the reappearance of the integers n = 3, 9, 21, 231 as well as the fact that :\\\\begin{align} &2^6 \\\\cdot 3(-(1- 96/24)^2+ 1^2 \\\\cdot3\\\\cdot 19 ) = 96^2\\\\\\\\\\\\ &2^6 \\\\cdot 3(-(1- 960/24)^2+ 7^2\\\\cdot3 \\\\cdot 43 ) = 960^2\\\\\\\\\\\\ &2^6 \\\\cdot 3(-(1- 5\\\\,280/24 )^2+ 31^2 \\\\cdot 3\\\\cdot67 ) = 5\\\\,280^2\\\\\\\\\\\\ &2^6 \\\\cdot 3(-(1- 640\\\\,320/24)^2+ 2413^2\\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot163 ) = 640\\\\,320^2 \\\\end{align} which, with the appropriate fractional power, are precisely the j-invariants. Similarly for algebraic numbers of degree 6, :\\\\begin{align} e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{19}} &\\\\approx (5x)^3-6.000\\\\,010\\\\dots\\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{43}} &\\\\approx (5x)^3-6.000\\\\,000\\\\,010\\\\dots\\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{67}} &\\\\approx (5x)^3-6.000\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,061\\\\dots\\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{163}} &\\\\approx (5x)^3-6.000\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,034\\\\dots \\\\end{align} where the xs are given respectively by the appropriate root of the sextic equations, :\\\\begin{align} &5x^6-96x^5-10x^3+1=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ &5x^6-960x^5-10x^3+1=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ &5x^6-5\\\\,280x^5-10x^3+1=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ &5x^6-640\\\\,320x^5-10x^3+1=0 \\\\end{align} with the j-invariants appearing again. These sextics are not only algebraic, they are also solvable in radicals as they factor into two cubics over the extension \\\\mathbb{Q}\\\\sqrt{5} (with the first factoring further into two quadratics). These algebraic approximations can be exactly expressed in terms of Dedekind eta quotients. As an example, let \\\\tau = (1+\\\\sqrt{-163})/2, then, :\\\\begin{align} e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{163}} &= \\\\left( \\\\frac{e^{\\\\pi i/24} \\\\eta(\\\\tau)}{\\\\eta(2\\\\tau)} \\\\right)^{24}-24.000\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,001\\\\,05\\\\dots\\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{163}} &= \\\\left( \\\\frac{e^{\\\\pi i/12} \\\\eta(\\\\tau)}{\\\\eta(3\\\\tau)} \\\\right)^{12}-12.000\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,21\\\\dots\\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{163}} &= \\\\left( \\\\frac{e^{\\\\pi i/6} \\\\eta(\\\\tau)}{\\\\eta(5\\\\tau)} \\\\right)^{6}-6.000\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,034\\\\dots \\\\end{align} where the eta quotients are the algebraic numbers given above. ==Class 2 numbers== The three numbers 88, 148, 232, for which the imaginary quadratic field \\\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt{-d}] has class number 2, are not considered as Heegner numbers but have certain similar properties in terms of almost integers. For instance, we have :\\\\begin{align} e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{88}} +8\\\\,744 \\\\approx\\\\quad\\\\quad 2\\\\,508\\\\,952^2&-.077\\\\dots\\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{148}} +8\\\\,744 \\\\approx\\\\quad 199\\\\,148\\\\,648^2&-.000\\\\,97\\\\dots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{232}} +8\\\\,744 \\\\approx 24\\\\,591\\\\,257\\\\,752^2&-.000\\\\,0078\\\\dots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} and :\\\\begin{align} e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{22}} -24 &\\\\approx (6+4\\\\sqrt{2})^{6}\\\\quad +.000\\\\,11\\\\dots\\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{37}} {\\\\color{red}+}\\\\,24 &\\\\approx (12+ 2 \\\\sqrt{37})^6 -.000\\\\,0014\\\\dots\\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{58}} -24 &\\\\approx (27 + 5 \\\\sqrt{29})^6 -.000\\\\,000\\\\,0011\\\\dots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} ==Consecutive primes== Given an odd prime p, if one computes k^2 \\\\pmod{p} for k=0,1,\\\\dots,(p-1)/2 (this is sufficient because (p-k)^2\\\\equiv k^2 \\\\pmod{p}), one gets consecutive composites, followed by consecutive primes, if and only if p is a Heegner number.http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath263.htm For details, see \\"Quadratic Polynomials Producing Consecutive Distinct Primes and Class Groups of Complex Quadratic Fields\\" by Richard Mollin. ==Notes and references* Gauss' Class Number Problem for Imaginary Quadratic Fields, by Dorian Goldfeld: Detailed history of problem. * Category:Algebraic number theory ","title":"Heegner number"},{"id":"522152","text":"Ignatius is a male given name of presumed Latin or Etruscan origin, believed to mean \\"fiery one\\" (compare the word \\"ignite\\").

Due to a farm-machinery accident in his youth (April 17, 1888), Brown lost parts of two fingers on his right hand, and in the process gained a colorful nickname. He turned this handicap into an advantage by learning how to grip a baseball in a way that resulted in an exceptional curveball (or knuckle curve), which broke radically before reaching the plate. With this technique he became one of the elite pitchers of his era. Brown was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1949. ==Early life== Brown was born in Nyesville, Indiana. He was also known as \\"Miner\\", having worked in western Indiana coal mines for a while before beginning his professional baseball career. Nicknames like \\"Miner\\" (or misspelled as \\"Minor\\") and \\"Three Finger\\" (or sometimes \\"Three-Fingered\\") were headline writers' inventions. To fans and friends he was probably best known as \\"Brownie\\". To his relatives and close friends, he was also known as \\"Mort\\". His three-part given name came from the names of his uncle, his father, and the United States Centennial year of his birth, respectively. Brown's pitching (or \\"twirling\\") hand According to his biography, he suffered two separate injuries to his right hand. The first and more famous trauma came when he was feeding material into the farm's feed chopper. He slipped and his hand was mangled by the knives, severing much of his index finger and damaging the others. A doctor repaired the rest of his hand as best he could. While it was still healing, the injury was further aggravated by a fall he took, which broke several finger bones. They were not reset properly, especially the middle finger (see photo). He learned to pitch, as many children did, by aiming rocks at knot-holes on the barn wall and other wooden surfaces. Over time, with constant practice, he developed great control. As a \\"bonus\\", the manner in which he had to grip the ball (see photo) resulted in an unusual amount of spin. This allowed him to throw an effective curve ball (or knuckle curve), and a deceptive fast ball and change-up. The extra topspin made it difficult for batters to connect solidly. In short, he \\"threw ground balls\\" and was exceptionally effective. ==Career== Brown with the Chicago Cubs in 1909 (left) and 1916 (right) Brown in 1911 Brown was a third baseman in semipro baseball in 1898 when his team's pitcher failed to appear for a game and Brown was put in to pitch. Players in the league quickly noticed the spin and movement created by Brown's unusual grip. Fred Massey, Brown's great-nephew, said, \\"It didn't only curve, it curved and dropped at the same time\\", Massey said. \\"It made it extremely hard to hit and if you did hit it, you hit it into the ground [because you] couldn't get under it.\\" After a spectacular minor league career commencing in Terre Haute of the Three-I League in 1901, Brown came to the majors rather late, at age 26, in 1903, and lasted until 1916 when he was close to 40. Brown's most productive period was when he played for the Chicago Cubs from 1904 through 1912. During this stretch, he won 20 or more games six times and was part of two World Series championships. New York Giants manager John McGraw regarded his own Christy Mathewson and Brown as the two best pitchers in the National League. In fact, Brown defeated Mathewson in competition as often as not, most significantly in the final regular season game of the 1908 season. Brown had a career 13‚Äì11 edge on Mathewson, with one no-decision in their 25 pitching matchups. Brown's most important single game effort was the pennant-deciding contest between the Cubs and the New York Giants on October 8, 1908, at New York. With Mathewson starting for the Giants, Cubs starter Jack Pfiester got off to a weak start and was quickly relieved by Brown, who held the Giants in check the rest of the way as the Cubs prevailed 4‚Äì2, to win the pennant. The Cubs then went on to win their second consecutive World Series championship, their last until 2016, a span of 108 years. In late 1909, Brown was on a team that played some games in Cuba. He planned to spend the winter there, but returned home when he caught a mysterious sickness. Brown saw limited action in 1912 and was released by the Cubs in October, a week before he turned 36. Soon after, he consulted a physician about a minor illness. Examining Brown's knee, the physician advised Brown to retire from baseball because he risked losing the use of his leg. However, Brown continued to play, signing with the Louisville Colonels, who traded him to the Cincinnati Reds for the 1913 season. After the 1913 season, Brown jumped to the Federal League, signing his contract on the same day as Joe Tinker. While Tinker went to the Chicago Whales, Brown was the player-manager for the St. Louis Terriers in 1914. Brown was dismissed as manager in August, then finished the season with the Brooklyn Tip-Tops, and was rumored to retire again in October 1914. He stayed in the league and played for the Chicago Whales in 1915. He returned to the Cubs for his final season in 1916. Brown and Mathewson wrapped their respective careers by squaring off on September 4, 1916, in the second game of a Labor Day doubleheader. The game was billed as the final meeting between the two old baseball warriors, and would turn out to be the final game in each of their careers. The game was a high-scoring one, the two teams combining for 33 hits. But with both teams well back in the pennant race, the two men pitched the entire game. Mathewson's Reds prevailed 10-8 over Brown's Cubs, as the Cubs' ninth-inning rally fell short. Brown finished his major league career with a 239‚Äì130 record, 1375 strikeouts, and a 2.06 ERA, the third best ERA in Major League Baseball history amongst players inducted into the Hall of Fame, after Ed Walsh and Addie Joss. His 2.06 ERA is the best in MLB history for any pitcher with more than 200 wins. Brown was a switch-hitter, which was and is unusual for a pitcher. He took some pride in his hitting, and had a fair batting average for a pitcher, compiling a career .206 batting average (235-for-1143) with 93 runs, 2 home runs and 73 RBI. ==Later life and legacy== Following his retirement from the majors, he returned to his home in Terre Haute, where he continued to pitch in the minor leagues and in exhibition games for more than a decade, as well as coaching and managing. According to his biography, in an exhibition game against the famous House of David touring team in 1928, at the age of 51, he pitched three innings as a favor to the local team, and struck out all nine batters he faced. From 1920 to 1945, Brown ran a filling station in Terre Haute that also served as a town gathering place and an unofficial museum. He was also a frequent guest at Old-Timers' games in Chicago. In his later years, Brown was plagued by diabetes and then by the effects of a stroke. He died in 1948 of diabetic complications. He was posthumously elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame the following year. F. Scott Fitzgerald refers to \\"Three-finger Brown\\" in his first novel, This Side of Paradise (1920). The television series The Simpsons made reference to Brown in the episodes \\"The Last Traction Hero\\" and \\"Homer at the Bat\\". Mr. Burns lists three ringers he wants for his company's softball team: Honus Wagner, Cap Anson, and Mordecai \\"Three Finger\\" Brown. Smithers has to point out that they are not only retired, but long-dead. He was referenced again in the episode The Last Traction Hero by Mr. Burns once more. In 1999, he was named as a finalist to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Between Brown and Antonio Alfonseca, the Cubs have featured both a \\"three-fingered\\" pitcher and a six-fingered pitcher on their all-time roster (Brown technically had four, including the thumb). ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball career wins leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual ERA leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual saves leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual wins leaders * List of Major League Baseball player-managers * Major League Baseball titles leaders ==References== ==Further reading== * * ==External links== *Mordecai Brown at The Deadball Era * *Mordecai Brown Official Website Category:1876 births Category:1948 deaths Category:American disabled sportspeople Category:American amputees Category:Amputee sportspeople Category:Baseball players from Indiana Category:Brooklyn Tip-Tops players Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Chicago Whales players Category:Columbus Senators players Category:Disabled baseball players Category:Indianapolis Indians players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Major League Baseball player-managers Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:National Baseball Hall of Fame inductees Category:National League ERA champions Category:National League wins champions Category:Omaha Indians players Category:People from Parke County, Indiana Category:Sportspeople from Terre Haute, Indiana Category:Sportspeople from Chicago Category:Sportspeople from St. Louis Category:St. Louis Cardinals players Category:St. Louis Terriers managers Category:St. Louis Terriers players Category:Terre Haute Browns players Category:Terre Haute Tots players ","title":"Mordecai Brown"},{"id":"522187","text":"The Barcelona chair is a chair designed by Mies van der Rohe and Lilly Reich, for the German Pavilion at the International Exposition of 1929, hosted by Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. The chair was first used in Villa Tugendhat, a private residence, designed by Mies in Brno (Czech Republic). ==Materials and manufacture== The frame was initially designed to be bolted together, but was redesigned in 1950 using stainless steel, which allowed the frame to be formed by a seamless piece of metal, giving it a smoother appearance. Bovine leather replaced the ivory-colored pigskin which was used for the original pieces. ==Philosophy and ergonomics== Although many architects and furniture designers of the Bauhaus era were intent on providing well-designed homes and impeccably manufactured furnishings for the \\"common man,\\" the Barcelona chair was an exception. It was designed for the Spanish Royalty to oversee the opening ceremonies of the exhibition and described by Time magazine as inhabiting \\"his sumptuous German pavilion.\\" The form is thought to be extrapolated from Roman folding chairs known as the Curule chair upholstered stools used by Roman aristocracy. According to Knoll Inc., despite its industrial appearance the Barcelona chair requires much hand craftsmanship. ==Current production== Since 1953 Knoll Inc has manufactured the Barcelona chair in both chrome and stainless steel. The chairs are almost completely hand-crafted, and each carries a facsimile of van der Rohe's signature, stamped into its frame. Barcelona chairs are made by other manufacturers worldwide and are sold under different marketing names. ==In popular culture== In his 1981 book about modern architecture, From Bauhaus to Our House, Tom Wolfe called the Barcelona chair as \\"the Platonic ideal of chair\\", and wrote that, despite its high price, owning one had become a necessity for young architects: \\"When you saw the holy object on the sisal rug, you knew you were in a household where a fledgeling architect and his young wife had sacrificed everything to bring the symbol of the godly mission into their home.\\" ==See also== * Barcelona Pavilion * Bauhaus * List of chairs * List of furniture designers * Ludwig Mies van der Rohe * X-chair ==References== * Sourcebook of Modern Furniture, Third Edition, Jerryll Habegger and Joseph H Osman * Miles van der Rohe, Aurora Cuito and Cristina Montes * Bauhaus, Hans Engels and Ulf Meyer * Modernism - designing a new world, Christopher Wilk, V&A; p. 155 * Oxford Dictionary of Modern Design, Jonathan Woodham ==External links== Category:Chairs Category:Products introduced in 1921 Category:Individual models of furniture ","title":"Barcelona chair"},{"id":"522190","text":"Vox humana pipes The Vox humana (Latin for \\"human voice;\\" also \\"voz humana\\" in Spanish and Portuguese, \\"voix humaine\\" in French and \\"voce umana\\" in Italian, although \\"voce umana\\" is also a term for a celeste stop, q.v.) is a short- resonator reed stop on the pipe organ, so named because of its supposed resemblance to the human voice. As a rule, the stop is used with a tremulant, which undulates the wind supply, causing a vibrato effect. The vox humana is intended to evoke the impression of a singing choir or soloist, though the success of this intent depends as much upon the acoustics of the room in which the organ speaks as it does the voicing of the pipes. It is almost invariably at 8‚Ä≤ pitch, though on theater organs it is not uncommon to encounter a chorus of vox humana stops at 8‚Ä≤ and 4‚Ä≤ pitch, with the addition of a 16‚Ä≤ acting as a pedal stop. The vox humana is one of the oldest reeds in organ building, based on its appearance in very early instruments. It is common on French classical organs in the 17th and 18th centuries, where it was used as a solo voice. The vox humana also appears on German and Dutch organs of the period, though not as frequently as in France. French organs in the 19th and 20th centuries almost invariably featured a voix humaine in the R√©cit (the most commonly enclosed division of the French romantic organ), though by this time the literature had evolved and it was used to play rich, harmonic chordal progressions. Many American organs built in the romantic style include a vox humana in order to facilitate the playing of this literature. Vox humana stops in very old organs had a fairly wide variety of designs and tonal qualities. It was during the nineteenth century that the design became fairly standardized. Today, most builders construct vox humana pipes in approximately the same way, though the scaling will vary between builders and according to the tonal style in which the organ is designed. The actual sound of the pipe is dependent upon the voicer, with an open \\"O\\" or a long \\"E\\" sound probably being the most common result. ==See also== * Voix c√©leste * Pump organ ==References== Category:Reed type organ stops ","title":"Vox humana"},{"id":"522191","text":"The Canadian Automobile Machine Gun Brigade, also known as Brutinel's Brigade or the Brutinel Brigade, was the first fully motorized unit of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. It was established on August 24, 1914 in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, as Automobile Machine Gun Brigade No. 1 by Canadian Brigadier-General Raymond Brutinel, who initiated the program and was the unit's first commander. The unit played a significant part in halting the major German Spring Offensive of March 1918. The Brigade was originally equipped with eight Armoured Autocars mounting two Colt Model 1914 machine guns (later replaced with the standard British Vickers MG) manufactured by Autocar in Ardmore, Pennsylvania. Autocar also supplied six unarmoured support vehicles, four \\"roadsters\\" for the Brigade's officers, and an ambulance. Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig wrote that the \\"work of the 1st CMMG Brigade in recent operations has proved the value that can be obtained from such units, and recommends the formation of a 2nd Brigade be undertaken forthwith.\\" So in May 1918 the 2nd Canadian Motor MG Brigade was added.

Schiff bases are imines in which R3 is an alkyl or aryl group (not a hydrogen). R1 and R2 may be hydrogens General structure of an azomethine compound A Schiff base (named after Hugo Schiff) is a compound with the general structure R1R2C=NR' (R' ‚â† H). They can be considered a sub-class of imines, being either secondary ketimines or secondary aldimines depending on their structure. The term is often synonymous with azomethine which refers specifically to secondary aldimines (i.e. R-CH=NR' where R' ‚â† H). A number of special naming systems exist for these compounds. For instance a Schiff base derived from an aniline, where R3 is a phenyl or a substituted phenyl, can be called an anil, while bis-compounds are often referred to as salen-type compounds. The term Schiff base is normally applied to these compounds when they are being used as ligands to form coordination complexes with metal ions. Such complexes occur naturally, for instance in corrin, but the majority of Schiff bases are artificial and are used to form many important catalysts, such as Jacobsen's catalyst. == Synthesis == Schiff bases can be synthesized from an aliphatic or aromatic amine and a carbonyl compound by nucleophilic addition forming a hemiaminal, followed by a dehydration to generate an imine. In a typical reaction, 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl ether reacts with o-vanillin: A mixture of 4,4'-oxydianiline 1 (1.00 g, 5.00 mmol) and o-vanillin 2 (1.52 g, 10.0 mmol) in methanol (40.0 ml) is stirred at room temperature for one hour to give an orange precipitate and after filtration and washing with methanol to give the pure Schiff base 3 (2.27 g, 97%) == Biochemistry == Schiff bases have been investigated in relation to a wide range of contexts, including antimicrobial, antiviral and anticancer activity. They have also been considered for the inhibition of amyloid-Œ≤ aggregation. Schiff bases are common enzymatic intermediates where an amine, such as the terminal group of a lysine residue, reversibly reacts with an aldehyde or ketone of a cofactor or substrate. The common enzyme cofactor PLP forms a Schiff base with a lysine residue and is transaldiminated to the substrate(s). Similarly, the cofactor retinal forms a Schiff base in rhodopsins, including human rhodopsin (via Lysine 296), which is key in the photoreception mechanism. ==Coordination chemistry== Schiff bases are common ligands in coordination chemistry. The imine nitrogen is basic and exhibits pi-acceptor properties. The ligands are typically derived from alkyl diamines and aromatic aldehydes. Chiral Schiff bases were one of the first ligands used for asymmetric catalysis. In 1968 Ry≈çji Noyori developed a copper-Schiff base complex for the metal-carbenoid cyclopropanation of styrene. For this work he was later awarded a share of the 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Schiff bases have also been incorporated into MOFs. center ==Conjugated Schiff bases== Conjugated Schiff bases absorb strongly in the UV-visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. This absorption is the basis of the anisidine value, which is a measure of oxidative spoilage for fats and oils. ==Nanotechnology== Formation of metal clusters in halloysite nanotubes via a Schiff base reaction on example of ruthenium. Schiff bases can be used to mass-produce nanoclusters of transition metals inside halloysite. This abundant mineral naturally has a structure of rolled nanosheets (nanotubes), which can support both the synthesis and the metal nanocluster products. These nanoclusters can be made of Ag, Ru, Rh, Pt or Co metals and can catalyze various chemical reactions. == References == ==Further reading== * * organic field-effect transistor (OFET) * Category:Functional groups Category:Imines ","title":"Schiff base"},{"id":"522215","text":"Cindy & The Saffrons was a UK vocal group, comprising Joanne Whalley as \\"Cindy\\" and Lindsay Neil and Sally Stairs as The Saffrons.

It is an ecoregion of the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome, and part of the Nearctic realm. ==SettingThree sub-ecoregions=== The California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion is subdivided into three smaller ecoregions. *California coastal sage and chaparral ecoregion: In southern coastal California and northwestern coastal Baja California, as well as all the Channel Islands of California and Guadalupe Island. *California montane chaparral and woodlands: In southern and central coast adjacent and inland California, covering some of the mountains of: the Coast Ranges; the Transverse Ranges; and the western slopes of the northern Peninsular Ranges. *California interior chaparral and woodlands: In central interior California surrounding the California Central Valley cover the foothills and the Transverse Ranges and Sierra Nevada. ===Locations=== Montane chaparral and woodlands in the Santa Ynez Mountains, near Santa Barbara, California Most of the population of California and Baja California lives in these ecoregions, which includes the San Francisco Bay Area, Ventura County, the Greater Los Angeles Area, San Diego County, and Tijuana. The California Central Valley grasslands ecoregion, as well as the coniferous Sierra Nevada forests, Northern California coastal forests, and Klamath-Siskiyou forests of northern California and southwestern Oregon, share many plant and animal affinities with the California chaparral and woodlands. Many botanists consider the California chaparral and woodlands, Sierra Nevada forests, Klamath-Siskiyou forests, and Northern California coastal forests as a single California Floristic Province, excluding the deserts of eastern California, which belong to other floristic provinces. Many Bioregionalists, including poet Gary Snyder, identify the central and northern Coast Ranges, Klamath-Siskiyou, the Central Valley, and Sierra Nevada as the Shasta Bioregion or the Alta California Bioregion. coastal sage and chaparral in the Santa Monica Mountains, near Malibu. ==Flora== The ecoregion includes a great variety of plant communities, including grasslands, oak savannas and woodlands, chaparral, and coniferous forests, including southern stands of the tall coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens). The flora of this ecoregion also includes tree species such as Gray or foothill pine (Pinus sabiniana), Scrub oak (Quercus dumosa), California buckeye (Aesculus californica), the rare Gowen cypress (Cupressus goveniana), the rare Monterey cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa), and a wealth of endemic plant species, including the extremely rare San Gabriel Mountain liveforever (Dudlea densiflora), Catalina mahogany (Cercocarpus traskiae), and the threatened most beautiful jewel-flower (Streptanthus albidus ssp. Peramoenus). (material included verbatim under the CC BY-SA 3.0 license Hesperoyucca whipplei, colloquially known as Chaparral Yucca, is commonplace throughout the lower elevations of the climate zone. There are two types of chaparral: soft and hard chaparral. Hard chaparral is usually evergreen, located at higher elevation and is harder to walk through. Soft chaparral tends to be drought deciduous, live at lower elevations and tends to be easier to walk through. ==Fauna== Species include the California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica), Costa's hummingbird (Calypte costae), coast horned lizard (Phrynosoma coronatum), and rosy boa (Lichanura trivirgata). Other animals found here are the Heermann kangaroo rat (Dipodomys heermanni), Santa Cruz kangaroo rat (Dipodomys venustus), and the endangered white-eared pocket mouse (Perognathus alticolus). Another notable insect resident of this ecoregion is the rain beetle (Pleocoma sp.) It spends up to several years living underground in a larval stage and emerges only during wet-season rains to mate. ==Fire== Chaparral, like most Mediterranean shrublands, is highly fire resilient and historically burned with high- severity, stand replacing events every 30 to 100 years. Historically, Native Americans burned chaparral to promote grasslands for textiles and food. Though adapted to infrequent fires, chaparral plant communities can be exterminated by frequent fires especially with climate change induced drought. Today, frequent accidental ignitions can convert chaparral from a native shrubland to nonnative annual grassland and drastically reduce species diversity, especially under global-change-type drought. The historical fire return interval for chaparral communities used to be 30‚Äì50 years, but has now decreased to 5‚Äì10 years due to human interference. ==Human influence== California oak woodlands, in Gaviota State Park, near Santa Barbara, California The region has been heavily affected by grazing, logging, dams and water diversions, and intensive agriculture and urbanization, as well as competition by numerous introduced or exotic plant and animal species. Some unique plant communities, like southern California's Coastal Sage Scrub, have been nearly eradicated by agriculture and urbanization. As a result, the region now has many rare and endangered species, including the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus). ==See also== * California Chaparral Institute * California coastal prairie * California montane chaparral * Chaparral * Closed-cone pine forest * Coast Redwood forest * Coastal sage scrub * Mixed evergreen forest * Northern coastal scrub * Oak woodland * Sierra Nevada lower montane forest ==References== * Bakker, Elna (1971) An Island Called California.

People living in this time period are referred to by archeologists as Late Palaeoindian *8,000 - 800 BCE During the Archaic Period, the climate warmed further. People living in the deciduous forests of Southwestern Ontario, hunted a wide variety of woodland animals. Deer and fish were important to their survival. The caribou had moved north. Larger trade networks were established, extending as far as the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic seaboard. Tools now included: nets, weirs, bows, arrows, and implements made of copper. People also fashioned copper into beads and bracelets.

He occupied Cataraqui (Kingston, Ont.), reinforced Niagara and Detroit, and strengthened other military outposts against the American threat *1779‚ÄîHaldimand sends Captain Dietrich Brehm to strengthen the line of communication between Montreal and Detroit; over 5,000 Indians forced out of New York come to Ft. Niagara for food and shelter; he increases the goods distributed as gifts through the Indian Department from about ¬£10,000 in 1778 to ¬£63,861 in 1782. *1783 ‚Äì The Treaty of Paris ends the war; U.S. boundary along the St.Lawrence and Great Lakes * 1784 ‚Äì Haldimand purchases lands for exiled Loyalists from the Mississaugas for or ¬£1,180 * 1784 Haldimand sets up 8 new townships for settlement along the upper St Lawrence from the westernmost seigneury to modern Brockville, Ontario, and five more around Cataraqui. *1784 ‚Äì About 9,000 United Empire Loyalists are settled in what is now southern Ontario, chiefly in Niagara, around the Bay of Quinte, and along the St. Lawrence River between Lake Ontario and Montreal. They are soon followed by many more Americans, some of them not so much ardent loyalists but attracted nonetheless by the availability of cheap, arable land. :At the same time large numbers of Iroquois loyal to Britain arrive from the United States and are settled on reserves west of Lake Ontario. :Kingston and Hamilton became important settlements as a result of the influx of Loyalists. *1786 ‚Äì Haldimand replaced by Carleton, now Lord Dorchester. *1788 ‚Äì On July 24, 1788, Governor General Lord Dorchester proclaims the land area to be divided up into \\"Lower Canada\\" with a French legal system and \\"Upper Canada\\" with a British legal System, whereby the land districts had been named Lunenburg, Mecklenburg, Nassau and Hesse in honour of the Royal family and the present large Germanic population. *1788 ‚Äì The British purchase 250,000 acres (1,000 km2) on which they begin the settlement of York, now Toronto * Thousands of Pennsylvania Dutch (German) farmers move from Pennsylvania to Upper Canada between the 1780s and the 1830s; they claimed a share of the United Empire Loyalists' foundational myth, drawing on its themes of loyalty and sacrifice.Ross Fair, \\"'Theirs was a deeper purpose': The Pennsylvania Germans of Ontario and the Craft of the Homemaking Myth\\", Canadian Historical Review, December 2006, Vol. 87 Issue 4, pp 653‚Äì684 == Upper Canada, 1791 to 1840 == Tecumseh's death at the hands of Richard M. Johnson *1791 ‚Äì The Constitutional Act of 1791 followed the Dorchester Proclamation of 1788 and thereby creates the first land registry for Quebec Upper Canada and the part of present-day Ontario south of Lake Nipissing plus the current Ontario shoreline of Georgian Bay and Lake Superior, and Lower Canada (the southern part of present-day Quebec). Upper Canada's first capital is Newark (present-day Niagara-on-the- Lake); in 1797http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/earth-sciences/geography/place- names/origins-geographical-names/9188#TORONTO it is moved to York, now Toronto. :The population of Upper Canada grows from 6,000 in 1785 to 14,000 in 1790 to 46,000 in 1806. (Lower Canada's is about 165,000). The population is rural, and based on subsistence agriculture, with few exports; government spending is a major source of revenue.Douglas McCalla, \\"The 'Loyalist' Economy of Upper Canada, 1784‚Äì1806\\", Histoire Sociale: Social History, November 1983, Vol. 16 Issue 32, pp 279-304 *1790s‚Äì1840s ‚Äì Dueling is common among the elite, government officials, lawyers, and to military officers; they used dueling as a form of extralegal justice to assert their superior claims to honour. However, a new ethic was emerging that opposed dueling and rejected the hyper- masculinity embodied by the code of the duelist. This opposition was part of growing opposition to hierarchic dominance by the elite; opponents valued the bourgeois husband and father and separated male honour from physical violence.Cecilia Morgan, \\"'In search of the phantom misnamed honour': Duelling in Upper Canada\\", Canadian Historical Review, December 1995, Vol. 76 Issue 4, pp 529‚Äì82 *1793 ‚Äì John Graves Simcoe is appointed as the first governor of Upper Canada. He encourages immigration from the United States, builds roads. Slavery was gradually abolished starting in 1793 by the Act Against Slavery. *1795 ‚Äì The Jay Treaty is ratified by which Britain agreed to vacate its Great Lakes forts on U.S. territory. Britain continues to supply the First Nations operating in the United States with arms and ammunition. *1800 ‚Äì First European settlement on the site of present-day Ottawa *1803 ‚Äì The North West Company moves its mid-continent headquarters from Grand Portage, Minnesota to Fort William, now part of Thunder Bay to be in Upper Canada. *1803 ‚Äì Thomas Talbot retires to his land grant in Western Ontario centred around present day St. Thomas and begins settling it. He eventually becomes responsible for settling 65,000 acres (260 km2). His insistence on the provision and maintenance of good roads, and on reserving land along main roads to productive uses rather than to clergy reserves leads to this region becoming the most prosperous in the province. *1804 ‚Äì First European settlement on the site of present-day Waterloo *1807 ‚Äì First settlement, Ebytown, on the site of present-day Kitchener *1812‚Äì1814 ‚Äì The War of 1812 with the United States. Upper Canada is the chief target of the Americans, since it is weakly defended and populated largely by American immigrants. However, division in the United States over the war, the incompetence of American military commanders, and swift and decisive action by the British commander, Sir Isaac Brock, keep Upper Canada part of British North America.Dennis Carter-Edwards, \\"The War of 1812 Along the Detroit Frontier: A Canadian Perspective\\", The Michigan Historical Review, 13:2 (Fall 1987), pp. 25‚Äì50 *1812‚Äì1813 ‚Äì Detroit is captured by the British on August 6, 1812. The Michigan Territory is held under British control until it was abandoned in 1813. *1813 ‚Äì The Americans send an army of 10,000 men under General William Henry Harrison to recapture Detroit. British and Tecumseh's forces win the first battle at Frenchtown, January 22, 1813, killing 400 Americans and taking 500 prisoners, many of whom are then killed. * 1813 May ‚Äì British and Indian forces fail in their siege of Fort Meigs, at the mouth of Maumee river; in August, they are repulsed at Fort Stephenson *1813 September 10 ‚Äì At the Battle of Lake Erie, the American Navy, decisively destroys British naval power on Lake Erie. British and Tecumseh forces, with their logistics destroyed, retreat back toward Niagara *1813 October 5 ‚Äì At the Battle of the Thames (also called \\"Battle of Moraviantown\\"), General Harrison, with 4500 infantry intercepts the retreating British and Indian forces and win a decisive victory. British power in western Ontario is ended, Tecumseh is killed, and his Indian coalition collapses. Americans take control of western Ontario for the remainder of the war, and permanently end the threat of Indian raids into Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan.John Sugden, Tecumseh's Last Stand (1985) *1814 ‚Äì Population 95,000. *1815 ‚Äì War ends and prewar boundaries are reestablished. One of the legacies of the war in Upper Canada is strong feelings of anti-Americanism which persist to this day and form an important component of Canadian nationalism. *1816 ‚Äì Waterloo adopts its current name to honour the battle of Waterloo. *1817 ‚Äì By the Rush‚ÄìBagot Treaty, Britain and the United States agree to keep large war vessels out of the Great Lakes. *1818 ‚Äì The Treaty of 1818 reduces boundary and fishing disputes between British North America and the United States. *1820s‚Äì1840 ‚Äì The Family Compact is a closed oligarchy of landowners, royal officials, lawyers, and businessmen who virtually monopolized public office and controlled the economy of the province in the 1820s and 1830s.David Gagan, \\"Property and 'Interest'; Some Preliminary Evidence of Land Speculation by the 'Family Compact' in Upper Canada 1820‚Äì1840\\", Ontario History, March 1978, Vol. 70 Issue 1, pp 63‚Äì70 *1820 ‚Äì The Talbot Settlement is now completely settled, having resumed following interruption during the war years. *1821 ‚Äì The North West Company merges with the Hudson's Bay Company *1823 ‚Äì Peter Robinson settles the Bathurst District near Ottawa with immigrants from Cork County, Ireland. *1824 ‚Äì The Church of Scotland is granted a share of the revenues from clergy reserves. Presbyterians by the 1830s were a major force for social conservatism. Ministers sent from Scotland in the 1820s and 1830s were surprised by the ethnic diversity, and horrified at the frontier way of life, which they saw as a devil's compound of illiteracy, drunkenness, ignorance of religion, and lack of schools. They promoted conservatism as a means of implanting Scottish moral values.Peter A. Russell, \\"Church of Scotland Clergy in Upper Canada: Culture Shock and Conservatism on the Frontier\\", Ontario History, June 1981, Vol. 73#2, pp 88‚Äì111 *1825 ‚Äì Peter Robinson settles Scott's Plains (later renamed Peterborough in his honour). *1826 ‚Äì first settlement of London *1826 ‚Äì With the creation of the Canada Company, free land is no longer available to immigrants willing to set up homesteads and farms. *1829 ‚Äì as a result of the Fugitive slave laws in the United States, the first colony of Black pioneers arrives from Ohio to uncleared land north of London, Ontario. The routes they travelled to Upper Canada become known as the Underground Railroad. *1831 ‚Äì Population 236,000. *1832 ‚Äì completion of the Rideau Canal from Kingston to Ottawa after six years of construction. *1832 ‚Äì a serious cholera outbreak spreads quickly from Lower Canada killing thousands. *1833 ‚Äì Building of the first Welland Canal by William Hamilton Merritt *1837 ‚Äì Rebellions of 1837 - Upper Canada Rebellion in favour of responsible government; a similar rebellion (the Lower Canada Rebellion) occurred in Quebec. In the world context of Atlantic revolutions, the Canadian reformers took their inspiration from the republicanism of the American Revolution. They demanded right to participate in the political process through the election of representatives; they sought to make the legislative council elective rather than appointed. The British military crushed both rebellions, ending any possibility the two Canadas would become republics.Michel Ducharme, \\"Closing the Last Chapter of the Atlantic Revolution: The 1837‚Äì38 Rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada\\" Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society, October 2006, Vol. 116 Issue 2, pp 413‚Äì430 *1839 ‚Äì Lord Durham publishes his report on the causes of the rebellions in 1837. *1840 ‚Äì The assembly passes a law providing for the sale of the clergy reserves, but it is disallowed by the British government. *1840 ‚Äì Upper Canada is now heavily in debt as a result of its heavy investments in canals. == The United Province of Canada (Canada West), 1841 to 1867 == *1841 ‚Äì Upper and Lower Canada are united by the Act of Union 1840 to form the Province of Canada, as recommended by Durham. Upper Canada becomes known as Canada West and Lower Canada as Canada East. *1841 ‚Äì Population 455,000. *1841 ‚Äì Sydenham dies in a riding accident and is replaced by Sir Charles Bagot. The movement for responsible government which had been growing under Sydenham is now so strong that Bagot realizes that to govern effectively he must admit French leaders to his executive council. Once admitted, Canada East Reformer Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine insists that Canada West Reformer Robert Baldwin also be admitted. Bagot admits Baldwin as well, creating a Reform bloc. *1843 ‚Äì Bagot retires because of illness and is replaced by Sir Charles Metcalfe, who is determined to make no further concessions to the colonists. Metcalfe refuses a demand by Baldwin and Francis Hincks that the assembly approve official appointments. The ministry in the assembly resigns, and in the ensuing election a slim majority supporting Metcalfe is returned. *1846 ‚Äì The Colonial Secretary, Lord Grey, rules that the British North American lieutenant governors must rule with the consent of the governed. Executive councils are to be selected from the majority in the assembly, and change when the confidence of the assembly changes. Britain is abandoning the mercantilist principles which have guided its imperial policy, and since colonial trade will no longer be restricted, local colonial politics need no longer be restricted. *1846 ‚Äì Britain begins the repeal of preferential tariffs to the colonies, starting with the Corn Laws. These actions essentially spur on the beginning of later negotiated trade agreements with the United States. *1847 ‚Äì Canada is overwhelmed with 104,000 immigrants, many suffering from typhus who arrive that year alone escaping the Irish Potato Famine. 1700 typhus deaths, including doctors, nurses, priests and others who aide the sick. They land at Grosse √éle, Canada East and Partridge Island, New Brunswick. Large numbers go on to settle in Canada West. Bytown (Ottawa), Kingston and Toronto receive more than other places, putting a strain on local resources while at the same drastically increasing and changing the composition of the population in the province. *1848 ‚Äì Lord Elgin, who had replaced Metcalfe in 1847, asks Baldwin and Lafontaine to form a government following their success in elections for the assembly. This is the Province of Canada's first responsible government. *1849 ‚Äì Elgin signs the Rebellion Losses Bill, which provided compensation for losses suffered during the Lower Canada Rebellion, over the opposition of English conservatives (Tories) in Canada East, who were accustomed to having the governor support them. In reaction, a Tory mob burns down the parliament building in Montreal but Elgin, supported by majorities in both Canada East and Canada West (which had already passed a similar bill), does not back down, and responsible government is established in fact. *1849 ‚Äì The Canada East Tories then sponsor an Annexation Manifesto calling for the province of Canada to join the United States. They were motivated by the loss of trade threatened by the repeal of the British Corn Laws. However, the rest of the Canadian population opposes the manifesto, including the Tories of Canada West, who favour provincial union. Union with the United States ceases to be an important political issue. *1850 ‚Äì The Robinson Treaties are negotiated by William Benjamin Robinson with the Ojibwe nation transferring to the Crown the eastern and northern shores of Lake Huron and the northern shore of Lake Superior. *1851 ‚Äì The population of Canada West is now 952,000 having more than doubled in 10 years, by then numerically superior to that of Canada East. Politicians of Canada West begin to argue for representation by population ('rep by pop'). *1854 ‚Äì An agreement for reciprocal lowering of trade barriers is reached between British North America and the United States. The British North American provinces can now send their natural products (principally grain, timber, and fish) to the United States without tariff, while American fishermen are allowed into British North American fisheries. Lake Michigan and the St. Lawrence River are opened to ships of all signatories. *1854 ‚Äì A law secularizing the clergy reserves is passed; the Anglican and Presbyterian churches retain their endowments. *1855 ‚Äì The American canal at Sault Ste. Marie on the St. Marys River (Michigan‚ÄìOntario) opened in May which opened Lake Superior to American and Canadian navigation, and made access to the Red River colony in Manitoba easier. *1855 ‚Äì The Great Western Railway links Windsor with Hamilton and Toronto. *1856 ‚Äì The Grand Trunk Railway opens between Sarnia and Montreal greatly enhancing the flow of goods and people across Southern Ontario and trade links with the American Midwest. Towns along its route swell in importance and population. *1858 ‚Äì Canada has become increasingly sectional, with Canada West electing Clear Grit Liberals and Canada East electing Conservatives. A coalition government led by John A. Macdonald and Antoine-Aim√© Dorion falls in two days. In the assembly Alexander Galt proposes a federal union of the British North American colonies as a solution to the problem. *1858 ‚Äì The temporary judicial districts of Algoma and Nipissing are created, the first in Northern Ontario. *1859 ‚Äì The Clear Grit Liberals under George Brown propose specific arrangements for a federal union of the two Canadas. *1861 ‚Äì Population is 1,396,000. *1864 ‚Äì A committee proposed by George Brown to inquire into solutions to the parliamentary deadlock between the Canadas recommends a federal union of the British North American colonies, a solution which is welcomed by all sides. A government of Liberals and Conservatives, the Great Coalition, is formed to pursue this goal. Representatives of the coalition attend the Charlottetown Conference called to discuss union of the maritime colonies and persuade the representatives to endorse the Canadian plan for a broader federal union. A conference in Quebec City draws up the Quebec Resolutions, a plan for this union. *1866 ‚Äì The Westminster Conference endorses the Quebec Resolutions with minor changes. *1866 ‚Äì After a minor skirmish on the Niagara Peninsulia at Ridgeway, the Fenians withdraw back the United States. This incident only hastens the publics desire for full-fledged nationhood (see Fenian raids). == 1867 to 1985 == Canada 1867 and after. The Province of Ontario 1867 and after *1867 ‚Äì The parliament of the United Kingdom passes the British North America Act, by which the provinces of United Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia join to form Canada. United Canada was split into Canada East/Est and Canada West/Ouest, the latter of which eventually changed its name to Ontario. The capital of Canada West was the city of York, which later changed its name to Toronto. *1870 ‚Äì There is large public support amongst Protestants for the trying of Louis Riel for treason for executing Thomas Scott during the so- called Red River Rebellion in Manitoba, while many Quebecers support Riel. Although Riel's government was finally recognized by Canada, its actions are destined to be described as a rebellion ever after. Tensions rise between Quebec and English Canada. *1870 ‚Äì the head of construction for the Dawson Road to Manitoba is named Prince Arthur's Landing by Colonel Garnet Wolseley during the Red River Rebellion. *1870s ‚Äì The growth of industry in Ontario and Quebec leads to a movement for protective tariffs. *1871 ‚Äì The first census following Confederation puts Ontario's population at 1,620,851. *1871 ‚Äì Thunder Bay District, Ontario, is created out of the western portion of Algoma District, Ontario. *1872 ‚Äì contracts are let by the federal government to survey the route through Northwestern Ontario of the Canadian Pacific Railway, to stimulate settlement of Western Canada, to bring Western agricultural and other products to Ontario and Quebec, and to link British Columbia to the rest of the country. The railway is part of Sir John A. Macdonald's National Policy. *1872‚Äì1896 ‚Äì The provincial government of Oliver Mowat vigorously defends provincial rights and expands the scope of provincial power. *1874 ‚Äì First issue of The Nation, founded by members of the Canada First movement to help in creating a Canadian nationality. Although the journal only lasted until 1876, other publications continued the effort after it stopped publishing. *1875 ‚Äì Construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway begins in June at Fort William, Ontario. *1879 ‚Äì The federal government of Sir John A. Macdonald, as part of its national Policy, institutes protective tariffs on manufactures and on farm products; the tariffs help Ontario industry but hurt farmers. *1882 ‚Äì The Canadian Pacific Railway Thunder Bay to Winnipeg is completed in June by the federal government. *1883 ‚Äì Important mineral deposits are found near Sudbury; this and similar discoveries, especially near Cobalt, triggered a mining boom in Northern Ontario. The region acquires a large French-speaking population as Quebeckers move there to work in the boom. *1885 ‚Äì The split between the Orange in Ontario and Roman Catholic Quebec is aggravated further by Protestant public support in Ontario for the hanging of Louis Riel, convicted of treason for his role in the North-West Rebellion that year. *1885‚ÄìRainy River District, Ontario is created after Toronto its boundaries case before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. *1889 ‚Äì The Imperial Parliament confirms Ontario's right to Northwestern Ontario west to Lake of the Woods and north of the Albany River by incorporation of sections of the District of Keewatin. *1890‚Äì1896 ‚Äì Tension between English and French is further aggravated by the disagreement between Ontario and Quebec over the Manitoba Schools Question. Ontario objects to a federal remedial bill to restore French schools in Manitoba in part because of its support for provincial rights, and in part because of the influence of a Protestant Equal rights movement begun in response to pro-Roman Catholic policies instituted in Quebec. *1893 ‚Äì A severe economic recession hits dropping the province's industrial output. Many in Ontario seek new opportunities further west following the recently completed transcontinental railroad. *1896 ‚Äì The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council rules that the federal government may exercise its reserve power only in time of war. This results in an increase in provincial power as areas of provincial responsibility are interpreted more broadly to accommodate new types of government initiative (social welfare, for example). *1896 ‚Äì Sir Oliver Mowat resigns after 24 years as premier. *1906 ‚Äì Establishment of the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario by the government of Sir James P. Whitney at the urging of Sir Adam Beck. *1912 ‚Äì Ontario acquires its current territory by incorporation of further sections of the North-West territories *1912 ‚Äì Regulation 17 bans teaching in French after the first year of school and the teaching of French after the fourth; this infuriates Francophones across Canada and further divides the country. *1914‚Äì1918 ‚Äì First World War *1916 ‚Äì The city of Berlin, under pressure to demonstrate the loyalty of its many citizens of German origin to the war effort changes its name to Kitchener *1916‚Äì1927 ‚Äì Ontario prohibits the domestic consumption of beer and spirits. Beer and spirits continue to be produced for export, however, largely for illegal sale in the United States. To make repeal acceptable, drinking in Ontario is encumbered by extensive regulations which lasted till the 1970s. *1937‚ÄìPremier Mitchell Hepburn uses the Ontario Provincial Police to suppress an CIO strike at General Motors in Oshawa after the federal government refuses to suppress it. Hepburn is unsuccessful in keeping the CIO out of Ontario. *1943 ‚Äì George Drew and the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario are elected, beginning 42 years of Conservative government. *1951 ‚Äì In response to a civil rights movement which originated in opposition to racial discrimination in Dresden, Ontario, the government of Leslie Frost passes Canada's first Fair Employment Practices Act, which forbids discrimination on the basis of race, creed, colour, nationality, ancestry or place of origin. However, the act is enforced administratively, with prosecution only a last resort. *1951 ‚Äì The Frost government passes Ontario's first equal pay legislation, the Female Employees Fair Remuneration Act. *1954 ‚Äì The Frost government introduces Canada's first Fair Accommodation Practices Act. Like the Fair Employment Practices Act it is enforced administratively, with prosecution only a last resort. *1955 ‚Äì The first conviction under the Fair Accommodation Practices Act, of Kay's Cafe in Dresden, the site of the original complaint of racial discrimination in Dresden, is overturned on appeal. *1956 ‚Äì First successful prosecution under the Fair Accommodation Practices Act, again of Kay's Cafe in Dresden *1962 ‚Äì Passage of the Ontario Human Rights Code, which amalgamates and extends previous laws about civil rights. *1966 ‚Äì The government of John Robarts introduces universal health insurance within the province. *1967 ‚Äì The Ontario Pavilion is opened at Expo 67 in Montreal, and Ontario gets its unofficial theme song: \\"A Place to Stand, A Place to Grow\\". *1967 ‚Äì GO Transit commuter rail network begins operation in the Toronto region. *1970 ‚Äì The provincially funded TVOntario goes on the air. *1971 ‚Äì Ontario Place theme park opens in Toronto created by the Government of Ontario *1976 ‚Äì The CN Tower in Toronto is completed and opens to the public. *1979 ‚Äì A train derailment in Mississauga causes the largest evacuation of a city in North American history. == Since 1985== *1985 ‚Äì The Progressive Conservative government of Frank Miller falls, ending 42 years of the \\"Big Blue Machine\\".

Many companies began to massively downsize and threaten to leave Canada all together. New advancements in manufacturing such as automation and globalization further destabalize the Province, and lead to a decade of instability *1993 ‚Äì Due to major budget shortfalls, the government of Bob Rae introduces its so-called social contract (nicknamed Rae Days) which re-opens public-sector collective agreements with the intent of rolling back wages; his New Democratic Party's traditional labour support is greatly weakened. *1994 ‚Äì The North American Free Trade Agreement comes into effect. *1994 ‚Äì The Ontario budget deficit reaches $17 billion (CAD) *1995 ‚Äì The Progressive Conservative Party wins a large majority running on the concept of the Common Sense Revolution *1995 ‚Äì Native protester Dudley George killed by Ontario Provincial Police officers at Ipperwash. *1997 ‚Äì The province passes the Bill 103 (the 'Mega City' bill) that calls for the dissolution of Metro Toronto and merging of 6 cities within it to create the new City of Toronto. *1998 ‚Äì The government of Mike Harris begins privatizing the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario. *1999 ‚Äì Highway 407 is sold to a private company (built in 1997) *2000 ‚Äì Seven people die after contamination of Walkerton's water supply. *2001 ‚Äì The former City of Ottawa merges with the Regional Municipality of Ottawa‚ÄìCarleton to form the new city Ottawa. *2003 ‚Äì Outbreak of SARS in Toronto; 44 die and tourist revenue drops by half.

Solovetsky Islands at the map of the White Sea. The Solovki special camp (later the Solovki special prison), was set up in 1923 on the Solovetsky Islands in the White Sea as a remote and inaccessible place of detention, primarily intended for socialist opponents of Soviet Russia's new Bolshevik regime. The first book on Gulag, namely, In the Claws of the GPU (1934) by Franci≈°ak Aljachnoviƒç, described the Solovki prison camp. At first, the Anarchists, Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries enjoyed a special status there and were not made to work. Gradually, prisoners from the old regime (priests, gentry, and White Army officers) joined them and the guards and the ordinary criminals worked together to keep the \\"politicals\\" in order. This was the nucleus from which the entire Gulag grew, thanks to its proximity to the first great construction project of the Five-Year Plans, the White Sea‚ÄìBaltic Canal. In one way, Solovki and the White Sea Canal broke a basic rule of the Gulag: they were both far too close to the border.Dmitriev comment This facilitated a number of daring escapes in the 1920s; as war loomed in the late 1930s it led to the closure of the Solovki special prison. Its several thousand inmates were transferred elsewhere, or shot on the mainland and on Solovki. ==The \\"mother of the Gulag\\"== Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn called Solovki the \\"mother of the GULAG\\". === From monastery to concentration camp=== Historically, the Solovetsky Islands were the location of the famous Russian Orthodox Solovetsky Monastery complex. It was a centre of economic activity with over three hundred monks, and also a forepost of Russian naval power in the North, repelling foreign attacks during the Time of Troubles, the Crimean War, and the Russian Civil War. In the autumn of 1922 the process of transitioning from a monastery to concentration camp began. All wooden buildings were burnt and many of the monks were murdered, including the Igumen. The remaining monks were sent to forced labour camps in central Russia. The unpublished decree of 3 November 1923 led to the conversion of the monastery buildings into the Solovki \\"special\\" camp: the Solovetsky Lager Osobogo Naznachenia or SLON in Russian–°–æ–ª–æ–≤–µ—Ü–∫–∏–π –õ–∞–≥–µ—Ä—å –û—Å–æ–±–æ–≥–æ –ù–∞–∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏—è (–°–õ–û–ù). (the acronym is a play on the Russian word for elephant). One of the first \\"forced labor camps\\", Solovki served as a prototype for the Gulag as a whole.Gulag by Anne Applebaum.

The treatment of the prisoners in the Soviet-era camp attracted much criticism in Western Europe and the USA. After a thorough clean-up, the Soviet government sent the proletarian writer Maxim Gorky there in an attempt to counter this negative publicity. He wrote a very favourable essay, which praised the beauty of nature on the islands, but some authors believe he understood the real conditions he was witnessing. See pp. 242‚Äì243. See p.188. === The Baltic-White Sea Canal === The exact number of prisoners sent to Solovki from 1923 to the closure of its penitentiary facilities in 1939 is unknown. Estimates range between tens and hundreds of thousands.\\"Forced Labor Camps\\" , on-line exhibition at the Open Society Archives. In 1923, Soloviki contained \\"no more than 3,000\\" prisoners; by 1930, the number had jumped to \\"about 50,000\\", with another 30,000 held on the mainland at the nearest railhead of Kem. In the early 1930s, many of the prisoners from the camp worked on the notorious White Sea ‚Äì Baltic Canal, one of a succession of grandiose schemes devised by Stalin. ===A Special Prison, 1936-1939=== In 1936, the Solovki camp was renamed a \\"special\\" prison (STON, an acronym that reads \\"Groan\\" in Russian) and from then until its closure in 1939 it served as a holding area for many prisoners subsequently executed, there or on the mainland, during the Great Terror of 1937‚Äì1938.\\"The Victims at Sandarmokh\\", The Dmitriev Affair website . Until documents confirming their execution were found in 1996, it was long thought that a transport of over one thousand prisoners, a quota for \\"1st category arrests\\" (executions), died from drowning after the barges on which they were travelling were deliberately sunk in the White Sea.\\"Sandarmokh\\" It is now known that they were shot on the mainland in late October and early November 1937; subsequent quotas for execution came too late in the year to sail across the White Sea and were shot on the islands, near Sekirnaya Hill.A 12 October 2017 news item by Meduza, includes footage of Yury Dmitriev supervising work to clear the burial pits at Sekirnaya gora. All but five of the 1,116 prisoners sent from Solovki across the White Sea on 27 October 1937 were executed by NKVD Captain and senior executioner Mikhail Matveyev at Sandarmokh between that date and 10 November 1937, when he reported his task complete. Among those killed were 289 members of the Ukrainian intelligentsia, the Executed Renaissance. A further transport was prepared to sail to the mainland for execution, but it was too late in the year to cross the frozen sea. Instead, between 200 and 300 prisoners were shot on Solovki itself, near the Sekirnaya Hill.A. Razumov (n.d.), Skorbny put, pp. 13-14 One of the many victims was Yelizaveta Katz, an engineer, who was 8 months pregnant. She was due to be shot with the others on 17 February 1938, but was allowed to give birth, then shot three months later on 16 May, aged 28.A. Razumov (n.d.), Skorbny put, pp. 14-16 In 1939, the prison was closed. It was situated too close to the border with Finland, and the Second World War was imminent. The buildings were transformed into a naval base and a cadet corps was deployed there. (One of its students was the future author Valentin Pikul.) === World Heritage and a disputed legacy === In 1989, a permanent exhibition, \\"The Solovki special camp\\", was added to the museum on the islands, the first anywhere in the USSR to be devoted to the Gulag. In June of that year, the first Days of Remembrance for Victims of Political Repression were held on the islands; in subsequent years this event would take place in August.The history of the Solovki Museum, 1975-1998 The Orthodox Church reestablished the monastery in 1992, and that year the ensemble was added to UNESCO's World Heritage List. In 2015, human rights activists expressed disquiet that the authorities were \\"gradually removing all traces of the labor camp\\". In January 2016 the Gulag section in the Solovki Museum was closed by its new director, Vladimir Shutov who, as Archimandrite Porfiry, was head of the monastery.\\"Head of Museum's disbanded Gulag section is threatened with eviction\\", Dmitriev Affair website, 18 February 2018.

He served as the head of the United States Committee on Public Information, a propaganda organization created by President Woodrow Wilson during World War I. ==Early life and education== Creel was born on December 1, 1876 in Lafayette County, Missouri, to Henry Clay Creel and Virginia Fackler Creel, who had three sons, Wylie, George, and Richard Henry (Hal). His father came to Missouri from Parkersburg, Virginia and bought land in Osage County, Missouri; he was college educated, and served in Virginia legislature. A captain of the Confederate States Army during the Civil War, he did not succeed in the Missouri post-war economy as a farmer and rancher. Even though he developed alcohol dependence, his wife did not abandon him until his death in 1906. She provided for her family by keeping a boarding house in Kansas City and by sewing and keeping a large garden in Odessa, Missouri. All her children became productive members of society: Wylie Creel, a businessman; George, a journalist and writer; and Richard, a doctor, who served as Assistant Surgeon General of the United States Public Health Service.Waal, C., and Korner, B. O. Hardship and hope: Missouri women writing about their lives, 1820‚Äì1920. Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1997, p. 81-82. His alcoholic father did not leave as deep an impression on Creel as did his mother, who inspired his passion for women's suffrage.Ashley, Perry J. American Newspaper Journalists, 1901‚Äì1925. Detroit, Mich.: Gale Research Co, 1984. The family moved frequently around west-central Missouri in Creel's early years, living for a time in Wheatland, Hickory County, Missouri then Kansas City before finally settling in Odessa, Missouri in 1888.Epperson, Ivan H. Missourians Abroad. No. 3‚ÄîGeorge Creel. The Missouri Historical Review, vol. 12, No. 2 (January 1918), pp. 100‚Äì110. He often said that, \\"I knew my mother had more character, brains, and competence than any man that ever lived.\\"Historic Missourians: George Creel (1876‚Äì1953), The State Historical Society of Missouri. His mother also encouraged his love for literature. Although Creel did not receive much formal education, as his mother pulled him out of school system, and was mainly home-schooled, he credited his mother for his fair knowledge of history and literature including classics, such as the Iliad. In 1891, the then fifteen-year-old Creel ran away from home for a year, supporting himself by working at a succession of county fairs across Missouri and at odd jobs when available. Despite his resistance and rebellion, Creel did manage to receive some formal schooling, while attending Kansas City Central High School, Odessa High School, and Odessa College for one year in Odessa, Missouri. He said of himself that \\"an open mind is not part of my inheritance. I took in prejudices with mother's milk and was weaned on partisanship.\\"Chris Hedges. Death of the Liberal Class. New York: Nation Books, 2010, p. 74. ==CareerEarly career=== In 1896, he began his first formal job at the Kansas City World. He was hired for $4 a week, starting as a reporter, but eventually moved up to write feature articles. He also wrote a book review column and covered social happenings. He was eventually fired because he felt it was wrong to discuss a wealthy man's daughter eloping with her coachman in the paper and apparently his editors didn't agree. After his termination, he was given a free train pass to Chicago by a well-wisher, and then hopped a cattle train to New York earning his fare by tending stock. He found an opportunity to work as a free-lance joke writer for William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer's comic supplements. As a 1913 Collier's profile put it, he was \\"shutting himself in his cheap room in a mechanics' hotel; he ground out jokes by the dozens, by the hundreds, jokes in bales and jokes in bundles.\\" But he didn't sell any his first month and survived by shoveling snow. Soon, he sold four jokes to Hearst's Evening Journal and became a regular with many periodicals. On March 11, 1899, he went back to Kansas City with his friend, Arthur Grissom, a poet, who married into rich Kansas family, to start a newspaper, The Independent. After only ten months, however, Grissom withdrew from the partnership. At age 23, Creel became the sole owner, editor, and publisher of The Independent. In the paper he dealt with many social issues including women's suffrage, single tax system, and public ownership of utilities. He was also a strong supporter of the Democratic Party and aggressively fought the policies and practices of Thomas Pendergast. Creel was not afraid to put politics or party affiliation aside for the greater public good, however. He backed Democrat Joseph W. Folk in a successful run for Missouri Governor in 1904. Then, in 1908, Creel came out in support of Republican Herbert S. Hadley and his gubernatorial campaign. Hadley, an ardent reformer like Folk before him, was the first Republican elected Governor of Missouri in nearly forty years. Said Creel in one of his newspaper editorials regarding party affiliations, \\"When a man becomes so besotted with partisan prejudice as to exalt party above the interest of the community, state or county, that moment he ceases to be a good citizen.\\" In late 1909, Creel left Kansas City and the Independent behind for a new political battlefield in Colorado. Reformer John F. Shafroth, a native of Fayette, Missouri and an acquaintance of Creel's, had been elected Colorado's governor in 1908. Despite the Independent being profitable, he chose to give the newspaper away to a pair of young women who aspired to be newspaper publishers. Leaving Kansas City with just fifty dollars to his name, Creel soon found employment as an editorial writer for the Denver Post. He gained national publicity by calling for the lynching of 11 senators who opposed the public ownership of Denver's water company. He resigned promptly after and had a brief stint working at William Randolph Hearst's Cosmopolitan. He moved on to write editorials for The Rocky Mountain News (1911‚Äì1912) where he was a strong supporter of Woodrow Wilson. In June 1912, Creel was appointed Police Commissioner of Denver by the recently elected reform mayor, Henry J. Arnold. Creel immediately used the office to launch several ambitious reform campaigns, such as ordering police officers to give up their clubs and nightsticks,Ousts Creel, Reformer; Denver Mayor Removes Police Commissioner, Blanche Bates's Husband, The New York Times, February 3, 1913, p. 1. as well as a campaign to destroy the red-light district in downtown Denver,George Creel Looms Up: Mayor Mitchel May Appoint Man Who Cleaned Denver, The New York Times, January 25, 1914, p. 2. while providing a tax-funded rehabilitation farm for women leaving prostitution.Lower Downtown Walking Tour: Red Light District, Market Street, Denver, Colorado His time as police commissioner ended after he began pushing the Mayor Henry Arnold to live up to campaign promises. Although he was dismissed by the mayor for the creation of dissension, he was lauded nationally for his watchdog efforts. Then in 1916, he became heavily involved in President Wilson's re-election campaign. Working under Bob Wooley, the Publicity Head for the Democratic National Committee, Creel wrote newspaper features and interviewed various people. In March 1917, Creel discovered that many of the military leaders wanted strong censorship of any criticism of the war. Creel sent President Wilson a brief in which he argued for \\"expression, not suppression\\" of the press. Wilson approved Creel's proposal and appointed him as chairman of the Committee on Public Information. ===Committee on Public Information=== George Creel with General William Wright Harts and Admiral Cary Grayson in front of the presidential train in January 1919. Seven days after the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Woodrow Wilson created the Committee on Public Information, a propaganda agency acting to release government news, to sustain morale in the US, to administer voluntary press censorship, and to develop propaganda abroad.Steven Vaughn. Holding Fast the Inner Lines George Creel was named the head of the committee, and he created 37 distinct divisions, most notably the Division of Pictorial Publicity, the Four Minute Men Division, the News Division, and the Censorship Board. The Division of Pictorial Publicity was staffed by hundreds of the nation's most talented artists, and they created over 1000 designs for paintings, posters, cartoons, and sculptures that instilled patriotism, fear, and interest in the war efforts.Eric Van Schaack. The Division of Pictorial Publicity in World War I. Design Issues, 22, 1, 2006, p. 34. Creel himself said that the images were \\"something that caught even the most indifferent eye.\\" Through the Four Minute Men division, roughly 75,000 civilian volunteers spoke to 314 million people over the span of 18 months on topics assigned by the CPI, like the draft, rationing, bond drives, and victory gardens.Lisa Mastrangelo. World War I, Public Intellectuals, and the Four Minute Men: Convergent Ideals of Public Speaking and Civic Participation. Rhetoric and Public Affairs, 12, 4, 2009. These civilian volunteers spoke at social events in places like movie theaters and fellowship halls for four minutes, which was the time it took to change a movie reel and the time believed to be a human's attention span. The guidelines set forth by Creel directed the volunteers to fill their speeches with facts and appeals to emotions to bolster public support for the war efforts. Between the News Division and Censorship Committee, Creel and the CPI were able to control the flow of official war information. Creel sought to portray facts without bias, though most pieces of news were \\"colored by nationalistic assumptions.\\" Creel's committee may have produced biased news, but it was his hope that the US could avoid rigid censorship during the war, as Creel's views on censorship were \\"expression, not repression.\\" Under Creel's direction, the CPI sought only to repress material that contained \\"dangerous\\" or \\"unfavorable\\" ideas to avoid demoralizing the population. All activities of the CPI ceased on November 11, 1919, upon the signing of the Armistice with Germany. The efforts of the CPI were regarded as the greatest public relations effort in history, up to its time. Such a massive, offensive, and multifaceted campaign had never been undertaken before, and the CPI brought to light the power of mass persuasion and social influence at a national level ‚Äì realizations that had a profound effect on the field of public relations.Wilcox, Cameron, and Reber, Shinn. Think: Public Relations. New Jersey: Pearson Education, 2013, p. 49. Many of the 20th century's most influential public relations practitioners were trained under Creel on the committee, including Edward Bernays and Carl R. Byoir. According to historian David F. Trask, all of Creel's strengths proved useful at CPI, especially \\"his predilection for Wilsonian reform abroad as well as at home, his personal magnetism, his taste for controversy, his tendency to attribute evil rather than misjudgment to those who criticized him.\\"David F. Trask, \\"Creel, George\\" in John A. Garraty, ed., Encyclopedia of American Biography (1975) p. 239-40. Trask continues: :As an administrator Creel was extraordinarily energetic, quick to make decisions, often impulsive. He was capable of inspiring strong devotion....Wilson seems to have held Creel in high regard, probably because of his unbending personal loyalty to the president as well as his effective methods of purveying administrative dogma.Trask, \\"Creel, George,\\" p. 240. ===Post-war career=== After his prolific career as the chairman of the CPI, Creel joined Collier's magazine as a feature writer, until he retired in the late 1940s. In 1926, he moved to San Francisco and eventually chaired the Regional Labor Board (1933) for California, Utah, and Nevada. He was an active member of the Democratic Party and ran against the left-wing novelist Upton Sinclair in the 1934 California gubernatorial election. Sinclair defeated Creel in the Democratic primary, but lost in the general election. ==Writing and books== Creel was the author of an extensive collection of writings.

He was most notably a member of the band Free. He was ranked 51st in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. ==Early years== Kossoff was born on 14 September 1950 in Hampstead, London, the son of Margaret (n√©e Jenkins) and the actor David Kossoff.Dimery, Robert; and Macdonald, Bruno. Rock Connections: The Complete Family Tree of Rock 'n' Roll, p. 94. HarperCollins, 2010. .

Accessed 1 September 2011. His uncle was the broadcaster Alan Keith and he was a cousin of the judge Brian Keith and the model Linda Keith. Aged nine Kossoff started classical guitar lessons with Blanche Monroe. His classical guitar training continued until he was fifteen. In December 1965 he saw Eric Clapton with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers at The Refectory, Golders Green, North West London. This encounter inspired him to purchase a Gibson Les Paul Custom guitar. During 1966 Kossoff worked as a junior salesman at Selmer's Music Shop in Charing Cross Road. He received lessons from session guitarist Colin Falconer who worked in the guitar department at Selmer's. In 1966 Kossoff joined the Chicago-style blues band Black Cat Bones. The band played with touring blues piano player Champion Jack Dupree, often supporting Fleetwood Mac and other gigs with Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green. Kossoff's bandmate in Black Cat Bones was drummer Simon Kirke, and the two went on to play on Champion Jack Dupree's April 1968 album When You Feel the Feeling You Was Feeling. ==Free period== Free (Amsterdam, 1970). Paul Kossoff, Andy Fraser, Simon Kirke, Paul Rodgers & Steve Winwood In April 1968, Kossoff and Kirke teamed up with Paul Rodgers (vocals) and Andy Fraser (bass) to form Free. They toured for two years, during which they recorded two albums: Tons of Sobs (1968) and Free (1969). Both albums showcased the band's blues- and soul-influenced sound, a style that was in contrast to some of their progressive and heavier counterparts at the time. Success came in 1970 when their third album, Fire and Water (1970), spawned the hit \\"All Right Now\\". The band played the Isle of Wight festival to both audience and critical acclaim, and sellout tours in the United Kingdom, Europe, and Japan followed. However, after the release of the next album, Highway (1970) and its relatively poor sales, band pressures led to a split. The live album Free Live! was recorded in 1970, and released in 1971 as a farewell record. Kossoff and Kirke teamed up with Texan keyboard player John \\"Rabbit\\" Bundrick and Japanese bass player Tetsu Yamauchi to release the 1971 album Kossoff, Kirke, Tetsu and Rabbit. Rodgers and Fraser pursued unsuccessful solo projects. Free reformed and released the album Free at Last (1972). Following its release, Fraser decided he had had enough, and quit to form Sharks. Free drafted Tetsu and Rabbit for the album Heartbreaker (1973) after which the group disbanded. ===Kossoff song-writing=== Kossoff co-wrote several Free songs, including 'Oh I Wept' and 'Mr Big' on the Fire and Water album. ==After Free== Rodgers and Kirke went on to form the successful Bad Company. Kossoff released a solo album, Back Street Crawler (1973). He then accompanied John Martyn on a 1975 tour. Kossoff then assembled a group called Back Street Crawler, which released two albums: The Band Plays On in 1975 and 2nd Street in 1976. Recordings from one of the band's UK concerts in 1975 were first released in 1983 on the album Live at Croydon Fairfield Halls 15 June 1975. Kossoff's guitar playing was also much in demand for session work and he contributed solos on several albums including: Jim Capaldi's Oh How We Danced (1972) and Short Cut Draw Blood (1975); Martha Vel√©z's Fiends and Angels (1969); The Amazing Blondel's Mulgrave Street (1974); Uncle Dog's Old Hat (1972), Michael Gately's Gately's Cafe (1971) and Mike Vernon's 1971 album Bring It Back Home. He also played on four demos by Ken Hensley (eventually released on the 1994 album titled From Time to Time) and three tracks that appear on the CD-only issue of John Martyn's Live at Leeds album from 1975. ===Posthumous releases=== In 1977 career retrospective Koss was released, and in 1986 Blue Soul. The late 1990s saw a renewed interest in Kossoff, and Blue Soul was re-released, as well as the five-disc Free box set Songs of Yesterday. In 2006, an unreleased guitar solo surfaced on the title track to the album All One by David Elliot, who recorded with Kossoff in the 1970s. In 2011 a selection of early recordings Kossoff made with Black Cat Bones was released on the album \\"Paul's Blues\\". ===Books=== In 2000 a Free biography entitled Heavy Load: The Story of Free was published. 2017 saw publication of the Paul Kossoff biography entitled Paul Kossoff: All Right Now - The Guitars, The Gear, The Music. ==Personal lifeDrug use=== Kossoff used drugs from age 15. Simon Kirke has said \\"He clearly had a predisposition.\\" He used Mandrax among other drugs. Paul Rodgers has said Kossoff was healthy and playing well in 1973 although this is disputed, but that he wonders about the company that Kossoff kept, and felt that \\"Koss was just too sensitive for this world.\\" Kossoff's drug use made him unreliable in the last stages of Free. ===Death=== Kossoff's unhappiness following the break up of Free and his drug addictions contributed to a drastic decline in his health. Kossoff died on a flight from Los Angeles to New York on 19 March 1976 from a pulmonary embolism after a blood clot in his leg moved to his lung, while touring America with Back Street Crawler. His body was returned to England and cremated at Golders Green Crematorium in North West London. His epitaph in the Summerhouse there reads: \\"All right now\\". ==Legacy== One of Kossoff's guitars, a 1957 Fender Stratocaster, was bought after his death by Dave Murray of the band Iron Maiden; he used it from 1978 to 1990. In 2012, one of his most famous and iconic guitars, a 1959 Gibson Les Paul, was recreated and made into a limited edition reissue by Gibson and named the 'Paul Kossoff 1959 Les Paul Standard'. In December 2015 Bonhams listed for auction a Gibson Les Paul Standard owned by Kossoff from 1970‚Äì1976. In April 2017 Guitar Magazine featured the 'stripped' Gibson Les Paul that Kossoff played at the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970. Kossoff sold the guitar to Mike Gooch and in May 1994 it was sold for ¬£12,000 at Christie's. ==Selective discographyFree=== * Tons of Sobs (1968) * Free (1969) * Fire and Water (1970) * Highway (1971) * Free Live!

The species formed is the conjugate base of that acid. The complementary process, when a proton is added (transferred) to a Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry base, is protonation (or hydronation). The species formed is the conjugate acid of that base. A species that can either accept or donate a proton is referred to as amphiprotic. An example is the H2O (water) molecule, which can gain a proton to form the hydronium ion, H3O+, or lose a proton, leaving the hydroxide ion, OH‚àí. The relative ability of a molecule to give up a proton is measured by its pKa value. A low pKa value indicates that the compound is acidic and will easily give up its proton to a base. The pKa of a compound is determined by many aspects, but the most significant is the stability of the conjugate base. This is primarily determined by the ability (or inability) of the conjugated base to stabilize negative charge. One of the most important ways of assessing a conjugate base's ability to distribute negative charge is using resonance. Electron withdrawing groups (which can stabilize the molecule by increasing charge distribution) or electron donating groups (which destabilize by decreasing charge distribution) present on a molecule also determine its pKa. The solvent used can also assist in the stabilization of the negative charge on a conjugated base. Bases used to deprotonate depend on the pKa of the compound. When the compound is not particularly acidic, and, as such, the molecule does not give up its proton easily, a base stronger than the commonly known hydroxides is required. Hydrides are one of the many types of powerful deprotonating agents. Common hydrides used are sodium hydride and potassium hydride. The hydride forms hydrogen gas with the liberated proton from the other molecule. The hydrogen is dangerous and could ignite with the oxygen in the air, so the chemical procedure should be done in an inert atmosphere (e.g., nitrogen). Deprotonation can be an important step in a chemical reaction. Acid‚Äìbase reactions typically occur faster than any other step which may determine the product of a reaction. The conjugate base is more electron- rich than the molecule which can alter the reactivity of the molecule. For example, deprotonation of an alcohol forms the negatively charged alkoxide, which is a much stronger nucleophile. To determine whether or not a given base will be sufficient to deprotonate a specific acid, compare the conjugate base with the original base. A conjugate base is formed when the acid is deprotonated by the base. In the image above, hydroxide acts as a base to deprotonate the carboxylic acid. The conjugate base is the carboxylate salt. In this case, hydroxide is a strong enough base to deprotonate the carboxylic acid because the conjugate base is more stable than the base because the negative charge is delocalized over two electronegative atoms compared to one. Using pKa values, the carboxylic acid is approximately 4 and the conjugate acid, water, is 15.7. Because acids with higher pKa values are less likely to donate their protons, the equilibrium will favor their formation. Therefore, the side of the equation with water will be formed preferentially. If, for example, water, instead of hydroxide, was used to deprotonate the carboxylic acid, the equilibrium would not favor the formation of the carboxylate salt. This is because the conjugate acid, hydronium, has a pKa of -1.74, which is lower than the carboxylic acid. In this case, equilibrium would favor the carboxylic acid.

It includes two parishes, North Knapdale and South Knapdale. The area is bounded by sea to the east and west (Loch Fyne and the Sound of Jura respectively), whilst the sea loch of West Loch Tarbert almost completely cuts off the area from Kintyre to the south.Ordnance Survey. Landranger 1:50000 Map Sheet 55 (Lochgilphead & Loch Awe)Ordnance Survey. Landranger 1:50000 Map Sheet 62 (North Kintyre & Tarbert) The name is derived from two Gaelic elements: Cnap meaning hill and Dall meaning field. Knapdale gives its name to the Knapdale National Scenic Area, one of the forty national scenic areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development. The designated area covers 32,832 ha in total, of which 20,821 ha is on land, with a further 12,011 ha being marine (i.e. below low tide level). ==Geography== The A83 runs up the eastern coastline of the area between Tarbert and Lochgilphead; the B8024 also links these two places (which lie outwith Knapdale), but does so via a much longer route along the north shore of West Loch Tarbert and the western coast of South Knapdale. Most of the western coastline of North Knapdale is accessible by two unclassified roads, although there is a gap between Kilmory and Ellary where the route is not public road. The B8024 through Knapdale forms part of Route 78 of the National Cycle Network, which runs between Inverness and Campbeltown. The western coast of Knapdale is deeply indented by two sea lochs, Loch Sween and Loch Caolisport. The highest point within Knapdale is Stob Odhar, at 562 m above sea level. Alongside Stob Odhar two other summits within Knapdale are categorised as Marilyns: Cruach Lusach (467 m) and Cnoc Reamhar (265 m), however there are no summits above 600 m in the area. Places in Knapdale include: *Achahoish *Achnamara *Ardrishaig *Crinan *Kilberry *Kilmory *Tayvallich ==Demographics== The United Kingdom Census 2001 reported a population of 2345 people in South Knapdale and 491 in North Knapdale, a total of 2836 for the district.Scotland's Census, Output Areas North Knapdale and South Knapdale Civil Parishes This represents a slight increase over the 1991 figure of 2704, when there were 439 people living in North Knapdale, and 2265 in South Knapdale. Census figures for the 19th and 20th centuries show a continuing and steady decline of population in North Knapdale, from a peak of around 2700 in 1825 to under 500 in 1950. Possible boundary changes make historic comparisons for South Knapdale less certain, but this part of the region appears not to have suffered the same depopulation as the north, and even modest growth, a rise from around 1750 in 1801 to around 2700 in 1901.Census data (1801-1951) after A vision of Britain ==HistoryGaels and Norwegians=== Dunadd, the capital of D√°l Riata In the early first millennium, following an Irish invasion, Gaelic peoples colonised the surrounding area, establishing the kingdom of D√°l Riata. The latter was divided into a handful of regions, controlled by particular kin groups, of which the most powerful, the Cen√©l nGabr√°in, ruled over Knapdale, along with Kintyre, the region between Loch Awe and Loch Fyne (Craignish, Ardscotnish, Glassary, and Glenary), Arran, and Moyle (in Ulster). Dunadd, the capital of D√°l Riata, was located in this region, slightly to the north of the modern day limit of Knapdale, in what was then marshland. This Gaelic kingdom thrived for a few centuries, but was ultimately was destroyed when Norse Vikings invaded, and established their own domain, spreading more extensively over the islands north and west of the mainland. Following the unification of Norway, they had become the Norwegian Kingdom of the Isles, locally controlled by Godred Crovan, and known by Norway as Su√∞reyjar (Old Norse, traditionally anglicised as Sodor), meaning southern isles. The former territory of Dal Riata acquired the geographic description Argyle (now Argyll): the Gaelic coast. Magnus dragging his boat across the isthmus, as depicted in an 1899 book In 1093, Magnus, the Norwegian king, launched a military campaign to assert his authority over the isles. Malcolm, the king of Scotland, responded with a written agreement, accepting that Magnus' had sovereign authority of over all the western lands that Magnus could encircle by boat. The unspecific wording led Magnus to have his boat dragged across the narrow isthmus at Tarbert, while he rode within it, so that he would thereby acquire Kintyre, in addition to the more natural islands of Arran and Bute. Supposedly, Magnus's campaign had been part of a conspiracy against Malcolm, by Donalbain, Malcolm's younger brother. When Malcolm was killed in battle a short time later, Donalbain invaded, seized the Scottish kingdom, and displaced Malcolm's sons from the throne; on becoming king, Donalbain confirmed Magnus' gains. Donalbain's apparent keenness to do this, however, weakened his support among the nobility, and Malcolm's son, Duncan, was able to depose him. A few years later, following a rebellion against Magnus' authority in the Isles, he launched another, fiercer, expedition to re-assert his authority. Many of the rebels, and their forces, sought refuge; they chose to flee to Kintyre and Knapdale. In 1098, being aware of Magnus' ferocity, the new Scottish king, Edgar (another son of Malcolm), quitclaimed to Magnus all sovereign authority over the isles, and the whole Kintyre peninsula - including Knapdale. ===In the Isles=== Castle Sween, one of the oldest stone castles now in Scotland In the mid 12th century, Somerled, the husband of Godred Crovan's granddaughter, led a successful coup, and seized the kingship of the Isles. During the later part of this century, Knapdale was evidently possessed by Suibhne, eponym of both Castle Sween and the MacSweens. In 1262, following increasing hostility between Norway and Scotland, the Scots forced Suibhne's heir, Dubhghall, to give up his lands - including Knapdale - to Walter Stewart, Earl of Menteith. In 1263, H√°kon H√°konarson, King of Norway launched an invasion of Scotland to reassert Norwegian sovereignty. One of his supporters was Murchadh Mac Suibhne, who was rewarded with the Isle of Arran for his services. Nevertheless, following H√°kon's death later that year, Magn√∫s H√°konarson, King of Norway ceded the Su√∞reyjar to Alexander III, King of Scotland, by way of the Treaty of Perth, in return for a very large sum of money. ===Early Scottish Knapdale=== Ormaig (adjacent to at the northern tip of Eilean R√¨gh) and Anagra By the 13th century, Somerled's descendants had formed into three main families: the MacDougalls, MacRorys and the MacDonalds. At the end of the century, a dispute arose over the Scottish kingship between John Balliol and Robert de Bruys; the MacSweens backed John, hoping to recover Knapdale, the MacDougalls also took John's side, while the MacDonalds and MacRory backed de Bruys. When de Bruys defeated John, he declared the MacDougall lands forfeit, and gave them to the MacDonalds; the MacSweens largely became gallowglass mercenaries in Ireland. De Bruys awarded landlordship of the MacSween's former Knapdale lands to Walter's descendants. The head of the MacDonald family married the heir of the MacRory family, thereby acquiring the remaining share Somerled's realm, and transforming it into the Lordship of the Isles, which lasted for over a century. After 4 years and 3 children, he divorced Amy, and married Margaret, the daughter of Robert II, the Scottish king, who gave him Knapdale as a dowry. In 1462, however, John, the then Lord of the Isles, plotted with the English king to conquer Scotland; civil war in England delayed the discovery of this for a decade. Upon the discovery, in 1475, there was a call for forfeiture, but a year John calmed the matter, by quitclaiming Ross (Easter, Wester, and Skye), Kintyre, and Knapdale, to Scotland. As a comital province (medieval Latin:provincia), Knapdale was extended to include the adjacent lands between Loch Awe and Loch Fyne, which had been under MacSween lordship. In shrieval terms, Knapdale was initially served by the Sheriff of Perth; 5 years later, however, it was transferred to Tarbertshire. Gradually, when the Campbells to the east and north grew more powerful, the centre of power shifted towards them, and the sheriff court moved to Inveraray at the extreme northeast of the then Knapdale. Somewhat inevitably, in 1633, shrieval authority was annexed by the sheriff of Argyll. When the comital powers were abolished by the Heritable Jurisdictions Act, provincial Knapdale ceased to exist, and the term came to exclusively refer to the present district, south of Lochgilphead. In 1899, counties were formally created, on shrieval boundaries, by a Scottish Local Government Act; the district of Knapdale - together with the rest of the former province - therefore became part of the County of Argyll. ===Modern times=== Knapdale Forest, planted in the 1930s, covers much of the region. During the 1930s, the Ministry of Labour supplied the men from among the unemployed, many coming from the crisis-hit mining and heavy industry communities of the Central Belt. They were housed in one of a number of Instructional Centres created by the Ministry, most of them on Forestry Commission property; by 1938, the Ministry had 38 Instructional Centres across Britain. The camp was used to hold enemy prisoners during the Second World War. The hutted camp in Knapdale was located at Cairnbaan, just south of the Crinan Canal, and a surviving building remains in use as a Forestry and Land Scotland workshop. Following late 20th century reforms, Knapdale is now within the wider region of Argyll and Bute. ==Ownership== Much of Knapdale is in the ownership of Forestry and Land Scotland. The two largest private estates are located to either side of Loch Caolisport: the Ellary & Lochead Estate covers acres on the north side of the loch, whilst the Ormsary covers acres on the southern side. Ormsay Estate belongs to Sir William Lithgow, 2nd Baronet of Ormsay and vice-chairman of Scottish shipbuilding company Lithgows. A 173-acre estate in the area belongs to former chief executive of Network Rail, Iain Coucher. Nick-named \\"Iainland\\", the property was purchased by Coucher in 2010 following his controversial departure from the company, and includes two islands in the Sound of Jura. ==Historic sites== Local attractions include the Chapel of Keills, which is dedicated to St Cormac and was built in the 1100s. The chapel is home to almost 40 carved stones from the early Christian and Medieval periods, of which the most significant is the eighth century Keills Cross, a free-standing cross similar to those found on Iona. A grave-slab in the chapel has a carving of a clarsach similar to the Queen Mary Harp currently at the Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh, one of only three surviving medieval Gaelic harps. West Highland grave slabs from the Argyll area suggest that Knapdale is where this harp originated. Further early Christian and Medieval carved stones can also be found at Kilberry, and at the thirteenth century Kilmory Knap Chapel. Castle Sween, on the shores of Loch Sween, was built in the twelfth century and is one of the oldest castle on the Scottish mainland that can be dated with any certainty. ==Environment== Four lochs within Knapdale (Loch nan Torran, Loch Fuar-Bheinne, Dubh Loch and Loch Clachaig) are collectively designated as a Special Protection Area due to their importance for breeding black-throated divers. The sea loch of Loch Sween has been designated as a Nature Conservation Marine Protected Area (NCMPA). The inner loch contains maerl beds and burrowed mud, and supports a colony of volcano worm, whilst the sea bed in the more strongly tidal areas at the mouth of Loch Sween is composed of coarser sediments. The loch is also home to one of Scotland‚Äôs most important populations of native oyster. Taynish National Nature Reserve is situated within North Knapdale, lying southwest of the village of Tayvallich on the west side of Loch Sween. The reserve encompasses almost all of the Taynish peninsula, which is around 5 km long and 1 km wide. The woodlands at Taynish are often described as a 'temperate rainforest', benefiting from the mild and moist climate brought about by the Gulf Stream. Taynish is owned and managed by NatureScot, and was declared a National Nature Reserve in 1977. In 2005, the Scottish Government turned down a licence application for unfenced reintroduction of the Eurasian beaver in Knapdale. However, in late 2007 a successful application was made for a release project. The trial was to be run over five years by the Scottish Wildlife Trust and the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, with Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) monitoring the project. The first beavers were released in May 2009, although the initial release into the wild of 11 animals received a setback during the first year with the disappearance of two animals and the unproven allegation of the illegal shooting of a third. The remaining population was increased in 2010 by further releases, and in November 2016, the Scottish Government announced that beavers could remain permanently, and would be given protected status as a native species within Scotland. Beavers will be allowed to extend their range naturally from Knapdale (and, separately, along the River Tay); however to aid this process and improve the health and resilience of the population a further 28 beavers will be released in Knapdale between 2017 and 2020. ==Gallery== File:Knapdale View.jpgView from Knapdale towards Jura File:Coalisport.jpgLoch Caolisport File:Knapdale forest track.jpgForest track in Knapdale File:Iainland - towards Rubha nah Airde - geograph.org.uk - 1102840.jpg\\"Iainland\\" ==References== *Field, J.

Ede studied painting under Stanhope Forbes at Newlyn Art School between 1912 and 1914. He was commissioned in September 1914 during the First World War, serving with the South Wales Borderers and the Indian Army. He relinquished his commission in consequence of ill health, and was granted the rank of captain, 29 July 1919. After the war, he continued his studies at the Slade School of Art. In 1921, Ede became assistant curator at the National Gallery of British Art (later the Tate Gallery) in London whilst continuing to study part-time at the Slade. Shortly after, he married Helen Schlapp whom he had met in Edinburgh. Whilst working at the Tate, he tried to promote the work of contemporary artists, including Picasso and Mondrian. However, he was often thwarted by the more conservative attitudes of the gallery directors. During his time at the Tate, Ede formed numerous friendships with avant-garde artists of the day. In the process, he acquired many works of art that were largely under-appreciated at the time. In particular, he secured much of the work of Henri Gaudier-Brzeska from the estate of Sophie Brzeska. The collection included numerous letters sent between Henri and Sophie, and Ede used these as the basis for his book Savage Messiah on the life and work of Gaudier-Brzeska, which in turn became the basis of Ken Russell's film of the same name. ==Middle years== In 1936, Ede tired of fighting the establishment at the Tate and left to live in Morocco, building a house outside Tangiers. Somewhat ahead of his time, he adopted a minimalist style of interior design advocating plain white-washed walls and the minimum of furniture required to complete a room. For the next twenty years, he led an itinerant life, writing, broadcasting and lecturing in Europe and America, whilst keeping the house in Morocco as a base. ==Artistic legacy== Ede's memorial stone in St Peter's Church, Cambridge Returning to England in 1956, Ede converted four cottages in Cambridge as a place to live and display his art collection. It was part of his philosophy that art should be shared in a relaxed environment; to this end he would hold 'open house', giving personal tours of the collection to students from the University of Cambridge over afternoon tea. Students could also borrow paintings from his collection to hang in their rooms during term-time. In 1966, Ede gave the house and collection to the University, establishing Kettle's Yard art gallery. Ede continued to live at Kettle's Yard until 1973, and then moved to Edinburgh where he lived out his retirement. == Publications == * Savage Messiah, H.S.

The book is written in rhyming text and includes five pages of pumpkin-related games and puzzles. It has been used in elementary classrooms as both a class reading and supplementary resource. Schools have also used the book as a part of interdisciplinary units on pumpkins which may incorporate the planting and growing of pumpkin plants, arts and crafts activities related to pumpkins, or basic mathematics activities that use pumpkins as units for counting or grouping. The book was released in the fall of 2003, coinciding with the celebration of Halloween. It was published by Scholastic, Incorporated. Reviewers have suggested that the book may be used by parents or teachers as an introduction to discussion about pumpkins or Halloween. ==Synopsis== The main character of the book is a little girl who loves pumpkins. She describes the many uses of pumpkins that she appreciates, including plastic pumpkins, pumpkins used to hold candy, jack-o-lanterns, pumpkin seeds, and her favorite, pumpkin pie. The illustrations show her and her mother traveling by car to a pumpkin patch, picking out a pumpkin, and then returning home. Along the way, they see a number of strange sights, including Frankenstein and his pet purple alligator who are returning home with their own respective pumpkins. One image shows a fantasy version of the girl's bedroom which is decorated with a pumpkin theme, including a pumpkin-themed headboard for her bed and an alarm clock in the shape of a pumpkin. The book ends with a series of pumpkin-themed puzzles that ask readers to identify a pumpkin that is different from the others, count which of a set of farmers has the most pumpkins, locate hidden pumpkins in a parade scene, and identify a pumpkin that looks like the little obese monkey in the book. ==References== Category:American picture books Category:2003 children's books Category:Halloween children's books ","title":"I Like Pumpkins"},{"id":"522283","text":"Malea may refer to: ==Genera== * Malea (plant), a genus of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae * Malea (gastropod), a genus of large sea snails, containing two species ==Places== * Malea, a village in Zau de C√¢mpie Commune, Mure≈ü County, Romania * Mal√©a, a town in northeastern Guinea * Malea (Arcadia), a town in ancient Acardia, Greece * Malea (Lesbos), a town in ancient Lesbos, Greece * Cape Malea, one of the peninsulas in the southeast of the Peloponnese in Greece * Malea, ancient name of Cape Agrilia, a peninsula in the southeast of Lesbos, Greece ==See also== * Maleia, a river in Romania * Malia (disambiguation) ","title":"Malea"},{"id":"522287","text":"Food line at the Yonge Street Mission in Toronto in the 1930s (during the Great Depression) The worldwide Great Depression of the early 1930s was a social and economic shock that left millions of Canadians unemployed, hungry and often homeless. Few countries were affected as severely as Canada during what became known as the \\"Dirty Thirties,\\" due to Canada's heavy dependence on raw material and farm exports, combined with a crippling Prairies drought known as the Dust Bowl. Widespread losses of jobs and savings ultimately transformed the country by triggering the birth of social welfare, a variety of populist political movements, and a more activist role for government in the economy. == Economic results == By 1930, 30% of the labour force was out of work, and one fifth of the population became dependent on government assistance. Wages fell, as did prices. Gross National Expenditure had declined 42% from the 1929 levels. In some areas, the decline was far worse. In the rural areas of the prairies, two thirds of the population were on relief. Further damage was the reduction of investment: both large companies and individuals were unwilling and unable to invest in new ventures. In 1932, industrial production was only at 58% of the 1929 level, the second lowest level in the world after the United States, and well behind nations such as Britain, which only saw it fall to 83% of the 1929 level. Total national income fell to 55% of the 1929 level, again worse than any nation other than the U.S. ===Impact=== Relief Work repairing a highway Canada's economy at the time was just starting to shift from primary industry (farming, fishing, mining and logging) to manufacturing. Exports of raw materials plunged, and employment, prices and profits fell in every sector. Canada was the worst-hit because of its economic position. It was further affected as its main trading partners were Britain and the U.S., both of which were badly affected by the worldwide depression. One of the areas not affected was bush flying, which, thanks to a mining and exploration boom, continued to thrive throughout this period.Payne, Stephen, ed. Canadian Wings (Vancouver: Douglas & McIntyre, Ltd, 2006), p.55. Even so, most bush flying companies lost money, impacted by the government's cancellation of airmail contracts in 1931-2.Payne, p.55. ===Unemployment=== Urban unemployment nationwide was 19%; Toronto's rate was 17%, according to the census of 1931. Farmers who stayed on their farms were not considered unemployed.Canada, Bureau of the Census, Unemployment Vol. VI (Ottawa 1931), 1,267 By 1933, 30% of the labour force was out of work, and one-fifth of the population became dependent on government assistance. Wages fell as did prices. In some areas, such as mining and lumbering areas, the decline was far worse. === Prairie Provinces === The Prairie Provinces and Western Canada were the hardest-hit. In the rural areas of the prairies, two thirds of the population were on relief. The region fully recovered after 1939. The fall of wheat prices drove many farmers to the towns and cities, such as Calgary, Alberta; Regina, Saskatchewan; and Brandon, Manitoba. Population in the prairie provinces fell below natural replacement level. There was also migration from the southern prairies affected by Dust Bowl conditions such as the Palliser's Triangle to aspen parkland in the north. The On-To-Ottawa Trek During the depression, there was a rise of working class militancy organized by the Communist Party. The labour unions largely retreated in response to the ravages of the depression at the same time that significant portions of the working class, including the unemployed, clamoured for collective action. Numerous strikes and protests were led by the Communists, many of which culminated in violent clashes with the police. Some notable ones include a coal miners strike that resulted in the Estevan Riot in Estevan, Saskatchewan that left three strikers dead by RCMP bullets in 1931, a waterfront strike in Vancouver that culminated with the \\"Battle of Ballantyne Pier\\" in 1935, and numerous unemployed demonstrations up to and including the On-to-Ottawa Trek that left one Regina police constable and one protester dead in the \\"Regina Riot.\\" Although the actual number of Communist Party militants remained small, their impact was far disproportionate to their numbers, in large part because of the anticommunist reaction of the government, especially the policies of Prime Minister R. B. Bennett who vowed to crush Communism in Canada with an \\"iron heel of ruthlessness.\\" These conflicts diminished after 1935, when the Communist Party shifted strategies and Bennett's Conservatives were defeated. Agitation and unrest nonetheless persisted throughout the depression, marked by periodic clashes, such as a sit-down strike in Vancouver that ended with \\"Bloody Sunday.\\" These developments had far-reaching consequences in shaping the postwar environment, including the domestic cold war climate, the rise of the welfare state, and the implementation of an institutional framework for industrial relations. ===Women=== Women's primary role were as housewives; without a steady flow of family income, their work became much harder in dealing with food and clothing and medical care. The birthrates fell everywhere, as children were postponed until families could financially support them. The average birthrate for 14 major countries fell 12% from 19.3 births per thousand population in 1930, to 17.0 in 1935.W.S. Woytinsky and E.S. World population and production: trends and outlook (1953) p 148 In Canada, half of Roman Catholic women defied Church teachings and used contraception to postpone births.Denyse Baillargeon, Making Do: Women, Family and Home in Montreal during the Great Depression (Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1999), p. 159. Among the few women in the labor force, layoffs were less common in the white-collar jobs and they were typically found in light manufacturing work. However, there was a widespread demand to limit families to one paid job, so that wives might lose employment if their husband was employed. Housewives updated strategies their mothers used when they were growing up in poor families. Cheap foods were used, such as soups, beans and noodles. They purchased the cheapest cuts of meat‚Äîsometimes even horse meat‚Äîand recycled the Sunday roast into sandwiches and soups. They sewed and patched clothing, traded with their neighbors for outgrown items, and made do with colder homes. New furniture and appliances were postponed until better days. These strategies show that women's domestic labor‚Äîcooking, cleaning, budgeting, shopping, childcare‚Äîwas essential to the economic maintenance of the family and offered room for economies. Many women also worked outside the home, or took boarders, did laundry for trade or cash, and did sewing for neighbors in exchange for something they could offer. Extended families used mutual aid‚Äîextra food, spare rooms, repair-work, cash loans‚Äîto help cousins and in-laws.Baillargeon, Making Do: Women, Family and Home in Montreal during the Great Depression (1999), pp. 70, 108, 136-38, 159.Denyse Baillargeon, Making Do: Women, Family and Home in Montreal during the Great Depression (Wilfrid Laurier U. Press, 1999) pp 70, 108, 136-38, 159. Women held 25-30% of the jobs in the cities.In Toronto women held 28%; in Winnipeg 26%; in Montreal 25%. Canada, Bureau of the Census, Occupations and Industries Vol. VII (Ottawa 1931), pp 226, 250, 190. Few women were employed in heavy industry, railways or construction. Many were household workers or were employed in restaurants and family-owned shops. Women factory workers typically handled clothing and food. Educated women had a narrow range of jobs, such as clerical work and teaching. It was expected that a woman give up a good job when she married.Margaret Hobbs and Alice Kessler-Harris, \\"Rethinking Antifeminism in the 1930s: Gender Crisis or Workplace Justice? A Response to Alice Kessler- Harris,\\" Gender and History, (April 1993) 5#1 pp 4-15 Srigley emphasizes the wide range of background factors and family circumstances, arguing that gender itself was typically less important than race, ethnicity, or class.Katrina Srigley, \\"'In Case You Hadn't Noticed!' Race, Ethnicity, and Women's Wage- earning in a Depression-era City.\\" Labour 2005 (55): 69-105. ===Teachers=== School budgets were cut a lot across the country, although enrollments went up and up because dropouts could not find jobs. To save money the districts consolidated nearby schools, dropped staff lines, postponed new construction, and increased class size. Middle-class well-educated teachers were squeezed by the financial crisis facing their employers. In Ontario, new teachers were not hired so the average age and experience increased. However, their salaries fell and men who otherwise would have taken higher status business jobs increasingly competed against women. Married women were not hired on the grounds it was unfair for one family to have two scarce jobs that breadwinners needed. Women teachers, who had made major gains in the 1910-20 era, saw themselves discriminated against.Cecilia Reynolds and Harry Smaller, \\"Ontario School Teachers: a Gendered View of the 1930s.\\" Historical Studies in Education 1994 6(3): 151-169 The teacher's unions were practically helpless in the crisis, even in Ontario where they were strongest.Harry Smaller and Andrew Spaull, \\"The Responses of Canadian Teachers' Unions to the Effects of the 1930s Depression with Emphasis On Ontario,\\" History of Education Review (1994) 23#2 pp 55-72 After prosperity returned in the 1940s, however, money was available again, there was a shortage of teachers, and the unions proved more effective. For example, in Quebec, the Corporation G√©n√©ral des Instituteurs et des Institutrices Catholics (CIC) was founded in 1946 (it became the Centrale de l'Enseignement du Qu√©bec (CEQ) in 1967). It sought higher pensions and salaries and better working conditions, while insisting the teachers were full-fledged professionals.P.A. C√¥t√© and M L'Hostie, \\"Le Discours syndical sur la formation et le role des enseignants au Quebec, 1930-1990,\\" Historical Studies in Education, (March 1993) 5#1 pp 3-31 In remote rural areas professionalization was uncommon; local school boards tightly controlled the one-room schools, typically hiring local women with a high school education or a year at university as teachers, so their meagre salaries would remain in the community.Dianne M. Hallmann, \\"'A Thing of the Past': Teaching in One-Room Schools in Rural Nova Scotia, 1936-1941,\\" Historical Studies in Education, (Spring 1992) 4#1 pp 113-132 ===Labour policy=== Case studies of four Canadian textile firms‚Äîtwo cotton and two hosiery and knitting‚Äîdemonstrate the range business response to the economic crisis. Each faced a different array of conditions, and each devised the appropriate restructuring strategies. The large corporations responded by investing in more expensive machinery and automation, hiring less skilled workers to tend the automated equipment, and tweaking their product lines to changing consumer tastes. However the smaller hosiery and knitting firms lacked the capital to invest or the research needed to monitor consumer tastes. They used time-tested \\"Taylorized\\" scientific management or made piecemeal changes. Power shifted upward to management, as strikes were too risky in the early 1930s and the opportunity to find a better job had drastically narrowed.Robert Lewis, \\"The Workplace and Economic Crisis: Canadian Textile Firms, 1929-1935,\\" Enterprise and Society (Sept. 2009) 10#3 pp 498-528 By 1935, however, the influence of militant American unions spilled over the border and Canadian unions became more forceful and harmonious. The activity was most notable in Ontario's automobile factories, beginning in Windsor in late 1936, where the new Automobile Workers of America (UAW) chartered its first Canadian local at the Kelsey-Hayes factory.John Manley, \\"Communists and Auto Workers: The Struggle for Industrial Unionism in the Canadian Automobile Industry, 1925-36,\\" Labour / Le Travail Vol. 17, pp 105-133 ==World trade== The Stock Market crash in New York led people to hoard their money; as consumption fell, the American economy steadily contracted, 1929-32. Given the close economic links between the two countries, the collapse quickly affected Canada. Added to the woes of the prairies were those of Ontario and Quebec, whose manufacturing industries were now victims of overproduction. Massive lay-offs occurred and other companies collapsed into bankruptcy. This collapse was not as sharp as that in the United States, but was the second sharpest collapse in the world. Canada did have some advantages over other countries, especially its extremely stable banking system that had no failures during the entire depression, compared to over 9,000 small banks that collapsed in the United States. Canada was hurt badly because of its reliance on base commodities, whose prices fell by over 50%, and because of the importance of international trade. In the 1920s about 25% of the Canadian Gross National Product was derived from exports. The first reaction of the U.S. was to raise tariffs via the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, passed into law June 17, 1930. This hurt the Canadian economy more than most other countries in the world, and Canada retaliated by raising its own rates on American exports and by switching business to the Empire.Richard N. Kottman, \\"Herbert Hoover and the Smoot-Hawley Tariff: Canada, A Case Study,\\" Journal of American History, Vol. 62, No. 3 (Dec., 1975), pp. 609-635 In an angry response to Smoot‚ÄìHawley, Canada welcomed the British introduction of trade protectionism and a system of Commonwealth preference during the winter of 1931-32. It helped Canada avoid external default on their public debt during the Great Depression. Canada had a high degree of exposure to the international economy, which left Canada susceptible to any international economic downturn. The onset of the depression created critical balance of payment deficits, and it was largely the extension of imperial protection by Britain that gave Canada the opportunity to increase their exports to the British market. By 1938 Britain was importing more than twice the 1929 volume of products from Australia, while the value of products shipped from Canada more than doubled, despite the dramatic drop in prices. Thus, the British market played a vital role in helping Canada and Australia stabilize their balance of payments in the immensely difficult economic conditions of the 1930s.Tim Rooth and Rebecca Taylor, \\"Exports and External Adjustment during the Slump: The British Market, Australia and Canada During the 1930s,\\" Journal of European Economic History 2001 30(3): 569-595 ==Government reaction== At the Depression, the provincial and municipal governments were already in debt after an expansion of infrastructure and education during the 1920s. It thus fell to the federal government to try to improve the economy. When the Depression began Mackenzie King was Prime Minister. He believed that the crisis would pass, refused to provide federal aid to the provinces, and only introduced moderate relief efforts. The government's reaction to The Great Depression is the focus of the 2013 documentary Catch The Westbound Train from Prairie Coast Films. ===New Deal=== The Bennett Government, which defeated Mackenzie King in the 1930 election, initially refused to offer large-scale aid or relief to the provinces, much to the anger of provincial premiers, but it eventually gave in and started a Canadian \\"New Deal\\" type of relief by 1935. By 1937, the worst of the Depression had passed, but it left its mark on the country's economic landscape. Atlantic Canada was especially hard hit. Newfoundland (an independent dominion at the time) was bankrupt economically and politically and gave up responsible government by reverting to direct British control. World War I veterans built on a history of postwar political activism to play an important role in the expansion of state-sponsored social welfare in Canada. Arguing that their wartime sacrifices had not been properly rewarded, veterans claimed that they were entitled to state protection from poverty and unemployment on the home front. The rhetoric of patriotism, courage, sacrifice, and duty created powerful demands for jobs, relief, and adequate pensions that should, veterans argued, be administered as a right of social citizenship and not a form of charity. At the local, provincial, and national political levels, veterans fought for compensation and recognition for their war service, and made their demands for jobs and social security a central part of emerging social policy.Campbell (2000) Blaming it on Bennett: A 1931 political cartoon suggests that Liberals had failed to take responsibility for their own errors. The Liberal Party lost the 1930 election to the Conservative Party, led by R.B. Bennett. Bennett, a successful western businessman, campaigned on high tariffs and large-scale spending. Make-work programs were begun, and welfare and other assistance programs became vastly larger. This led to a large federal deficit, however. Bennett became wary of the budget shortfalls by 1932, and cut back severely on federal spending. This only deepened the depression as government employees were put out of work and public works projects were cancelled. One of the greatest burdens on the government was the Canadian National Railway (CNR). The federal government had taken over a number of defunct and bankrupt railways during World War I and the 1920s. The debt the government assumed was over $2 billion, a massive sum at the time, but during the boom years it seemed payable. The Depression turned this debt into a crushing burden. Due to the decrease in trade, the CNR also began to lose substantial amounts of money during the Depression, and had to be further bailed out by the government. With falling support and the depression only getting worse, Bennett attempted to introduce policies based on the New Deal of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the United States. Bennett thus called for a minimum wage, unemployment insurance, and other such programs. This effort was largely unsuccessful; the provinces challenged the rights of the federal government to manage these programs. Some of the federal efforts were successful: the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act and Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, which provided alternatives to bankruptcy for distressed businesses, were held to be constitutional by the Reference Re Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act. The judicial and political failure of Bennett's New Deal legislation shifted the struggle to reconstitute capitalism to the provincial and municipal levels of the state. Attempts to deal with the dislocations of the Great Depression in Ontario focused on the \\"sweatshop crisis\\" that came to dominate political and social discourse after 1934. Ontario's 1935 Industrial Standards Act (ISA) was designed to bring workers and employers together under the auspices of the state to establish minimum wages and work standards. The establishment of New Deal style industrial codes was premised on the mobilization of organized capital and organized labour to combat unfair competition, stop the spread of relief-subsidized labour, and halt the predations of sweatshop capitalism. Although the ISA did not bring about extensive economic regulation, it excited considerable interest in the possibility of government intervention. Workers in a diverse range of occupations, from asbestos workers to waitresses, attempted to organize around the possibility of the ISA. The importance of the ISA lies in what it reveals about the nature of welfare, wage labour, the union movement, competitive capitalism, business attitudes toward industrial regulation, and the role of the state in managing the collective affairs of capitalism. The history of the ISA also suggests that \\"regulatory unionism,\\" as described by Colin Gordon in his work on the American New Deal, may have animated key developments in Canadian social, economic, and labour history.Klee (2000); Colin Gordon, New Deals: Business, Labor, and Politics in America, 1920-1935 (1994) The failure to help the economy led to the federal Conservatives' defeat in the 1935 election when the Liberals, still led by Mackenzie King, returned to power. The public at large lost faith in both the Liberal Party of Canada and the Conservative Party of Canada. This caused the rise of a third party: the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (a socialist party that achieved some success before joining the Canadian Labour Congress in 1961, becoming the New Democratic Party). With the worst of the Depression over, the government implemented some relief programs such as the National Housing Act and National Employment Commission, and it established Trans-Canada Airlines (1937, the predecessor to Air Canada). However, it took until 1939 and the outbreak of war for the Canadian economy to return to 1929 levels. ===Liberals return=== After 1936 the prime minister lost patience when westerners preferred radical alternatives such as the CCF (Co-operative Commonwealth Federation) and Social Credit to his middle-of-the-road liberalism. Indeed, he came close to writing off the region with his comment that the prairie dust bowl was \\"part of the U.S. desert area. I doubt if it will be of any real use again.\\"Robert A. Wardhaugh, Mackenzie King and the Prairie West (2000) Instead he paid more attention to the industrial regions and the needs of Ontario and Quebec regarding the proposed St. Lawrence Seaway project with the United States. As for the unemployed, he was hostile to federal relief and reluctantly accepted a Keynesian solution that involved federal deficit spending, tax cuts and subsidies to the housing market.H. Blair Neatby, The Politics of Chaos: Canada in the Thirties (1972) p. 84-6. Mackenzie King returned as prime minister, serving until his retirement in 1948. During all but the last two years he was also secretary of state for external affairs, taking personal charge of foreign policy. ===Social Credit=== Social Credit (often called SoCred) was a populist political movement strongest in Alberta and neighbouring British Columbia, 1930s-1970s. Social Credit was based on the economic theories of an Englishman, C. H. Douglas. His theories became very popular across the nation in the early 1930s. A central proposal was the free distribution of dividends (or social credit), called \\"funny money\\" by the opposition.Bob Hesketh, Major Douglas and Alberta Social Credit. (1997) During the Great Depression in Canada the demand for radical action peaked around 1934, after the worst period was over and the economy was recovering. Mortgage debt was significant because farmers could not meet their interest payments. The insecurity of farmers, whose debts were increasing and who had no legal protection against foreclosure, was a potent factor in creating a mood of political desperation. The radical farmers party, UFA was baffled by the depression and Albertans demanded new leadership. Prairie farmers had always believed that they were being exploited by Toronto and Montreal. What they lacked was a prophet who would lead them to the promised land. The Social Credit movement began in Alberta in 1932; it became a political movement in 1935 and suddenly burned like a prairie fire. The prophet and new premier was radio evangelist William Aberhart (1878‚Äì1943). The message was biblical prophecy. Aberhart was a fundamentalist, preaching the revealed word of God and quoting the Bible to find a solution for the evils of the modern, materialistic world: the evils of sophisticated academics and their biblical criticism, the cold formality of middle-class congregations, the vices of dancing and movies and drink. \\"Bible Bill\\" preached that the capitalist economy was rotten because of its immorality; specifically it produced goods and services but did not provide people with sufficient purchasing power to enjoy them. This could be remedied by the giving out money in the form of \\"social credit\\", or $25 a month for every man and woman. This pump priming was guaranteed to restore prosperity, he prophesied to the 1600 Social Credit clubs he formed in the province. Alberta's businessmen, professionals, newspaper editors and the traditional middle-class leaders vehemently protested Aberhart's crack-pot ideas, but they had not solved any problems and spoke not of the promised land ahead. Aberhart's new party in 1935 elected 56 members to the Alberta Assembly, compared to 7 for all the other parties.The economic theorist for Aberhart was Major Douglas, an English engineer with an unbounded confidence in technology. * H. Blair Neatby, The Politics of Chaos: Canada in the Thirties (1972) pp 143-61; John A. Irving, The Social Credit Movement in Alberta (1959) Alberta's Social Credit Party remained in power for 36 years until 1971. It was re- elected by popular vote no less than 9 times, achieving success by moving from left to the right.Thomas Flanagan and Martha F. Lee, \\"From Social Credit to Social Conservatism: The Evolution of an Ideology,\\" Prairie Forum 16 (1991): 205-223; C. B. Macpherson, Democracy in Alberta: Social Credit and the Party System. 2d ed. 1962. Social Credit in office Once in office in Alberta Aberhart gave a high priority to balancing the provincial budget. He reduced expenditures and increased the sales tax and the income tax. The poor and unemployed got nothing.Alvin Finkel, \\"Social Credit and the Unemployed.\\" Alberta History 1983 31(2): 24-32. The $25 monthly social dividend never arrived, as Aberhart decided nothing could be done until the province's financial system was changed, and 1936 Alberta defaulted on its bonds. He did pass a Debt Adjustment Act that cancelled all the interest on mortgages since 1932 and limited all interest rates on mortgages to 5%, in line with similar laws passed by other provinces. In 1937 backbenchers passed a radical banking law that was disallowed by the national government (banking was a federal responsibility). Efforts to control the press were also disallowed. The party was authoritarian and tried to exert detailed control over its officeholders; those who rebelled were purged or removed from office by the new device of recall elections. Although Aberhart was hostile to banks and newspapers, he was basically in favour of capitalism and did not support socialist policies as did the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in Saskatchewan.In Alberta the CCF and Social Credit were bitter enemies, which made it impossible for them to merge in Saskatchewan. See S. M. Lipset, Agrarian Socialism: The Cooperative Commonwealth Federation in Saskatchewan a Study in Political Sociology. (1950, 1971 ed.) p. 143-4. By 1938 the Social Credit government abandoned its notions about the $25 payouts, but its inability to break with UFA policies led to disillusionment and heavy defections from the party. Aberhart's government was re-elected in the 1940 election, carrying 43% of the vote. The prosperity of the Second World War relieved the economic fears and hatreds that had fuelled farmer unrest. Aberhart died in 1943, and was succeeded as Premier by his student at the Prophetic Bible Institute and lifelong close disciple, Ernest C. Manning (1908‚Äì1996). The Social Credit party, now firmly on the right, governed Alberta until 1968 under Manning. ==Recovery== The Canadian recovery from the Great Depression proceeded slowly. Economists Pedro Amaral and James MacGee find that the Canadian recovery has important differences with the United States.Amaral, Pedro and James C. MacGee \\"The Great Depression in Canada and the United States: A Neoclassical Perspective\\" in Kehoe, Prescott (2007) In the U.S. productivity recovered quickly while the labour force remained depressed throughout the decade. In Canada employment quickly recovered but productivity remained well below trend. Amaral and MacGee suggest that this decline is due to the sustained reduction in international trade during the 1930s. In the midst of the Great Depression, the Crown-in-Council attempted to uplift the people, and created two national corporations: the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission (CRBC), and the Bank of Canada. The former, established in 1932, was seen as a means to keep the country unified and uplifted in these harsh economic times. Many poor citizens found radio as an escape and used it to restore their own faiths in a brighter future. Broadcasting coast to coast mainly in English, with some French, primarily in Quebec, the CRBC played a vital role in keeping the morale up for Canadians everywhere. The latter was used to regulate currency and credit which had been horribly managed amongst Canadian citizens in the prior years. It was also set up to serve as a private banker‚Äôs bank and to assist and advise the Canadian government on its own debts and financial matters. The bank played an important role to help steer government spending in the right direction. The bank's effort took place through the tough years of the depression and on to the prosperity that followed into and after the Second World War. Both of these corporations were seen as positive moves by the Canadian government to help get the economy back on track. 1937 was an important year in the recovery from the Great Depression. The Bank of Canada was nationalized in that year, and the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission (CRBC) became the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in that same year. Both corporations were successful aids in the cultural and financial recovery of the Canadian economy during the Great depression. It took the outbreak of World War II to pull Canada out of the depression. From 1939, an increased demand in Europe for materials, and increased spending by the Canadian government created a strong boost for the economy. Unemployed men enlisted in the military. By 1939, Canada was in the first prosperity period in the business cycle in a decade. This coincided with the recovery in the American economy, which created a better market for exports and a new inflow of much needed capital. ==See also== *Canada in the World Wars and Interwar Years *Cities in the Great Depression#Canada * List of riots and civil unrest in Calgary ==References== ==Further reading== * Robert L.

She established her reputation as an academic with her contributions to the philosophy of mind in two major works and many articles in professional journals. As a conscientious college tutor, she won the respect and affection of her students and academic colleagues. Her most notable contribution lay in her clandestine activities behind the Iron Curtain, which led to the establishment of underground universities and academic networks in Soviet-controlled Eastern Europe. For her work in support of this network President V√°clav Havel awarded her the Commemorative Medal of the President of the Czech Republic in October 1998.Day, Barbara. The Velvet Philosophers. The Claridge Press, 1999, pp. 281‚Äì282. ==Early life and academic career== Wilkes, who was known as Kathy, was the daughter of Rev. J C Vaughan Wilkes who had been a master at Eton and Warden of Radley College before entering holy orders, and was for many years vicar of Marlow. Her paternal grandparents had founded and run St Cyprian's School, Eastbourne, while her grandfather on her mother's side (the Very Rev Cyril Alington) had been Headmaster of Eton, Dean of Durham and author of many famous hymns. She was educated at Wycombe Abbey and St Hugh's College, Oxford, where she achieved a double First. Her achievement was all the greater in light of the excruciating pain she was suffering from as a result of a teenage riding accident. She spent a period at Princeton University, where she studied with Thomas Nagel, Richard Rorty and others, and received her Ph.D. She then lived the life of an Oxbridge don. After a time at King's College, Cambridge, she became a fellow of St Hilda's College, Oxford, in 1973, and was a lecturer in philosophy in the University of Oxford for the rest of her career.Newton- Smith, Bill. \\"Kathy Wilkes\\", obituary, The Guardian, 19 September 2003. ==Work in Soviet-controlled Eastern Europe: Czechoslovakia== During her time at Oxford, she worked, often in secret, for the education systems of eastern Europe. In 1979 she was the first of Oxford university's philosophers to respond to an invitation from the dissident philosophical community in Prague to conduct secret seminars there. She showed extraordinary courage in conducting secret meetings in crowded flats with groups of philosophers. Despite her large frame and ungainly walk, she would lead the secret policemen who followed her on wild goose chases through Slavic cities, unconcerned by their harassment. She made the difficult and risky trip many times, smuggling in banned books and taking out samizdat manuscripts. With her western friends, she created the Jan Hus Foundation, which was to become a major source of support for the dissident community. She encouraged and financially supported dissident intellectuals, finally bringing the Czech philosopher Julius Tomin and family to England. Having lost her Czech visa, she achieved this by returning to Prague with a new passport in her full name \\"Vaughan-Wilkes\\" to confuse the authorities. Having never driven there before, she drove the family precariously in a heavily overladen Zhiguli to the West knowing that the slightest traffic infringement would bring down the law. Back in England she arranged housing and paid for the children's education.Day, Barbara. The Velvet philosophers. The Claridge Press, 1999. ==Work in the former Yugoslavia== Pile, Dubrovnik Wilkes became Chairman of the executive committee of the Inter-University Centre in Dubrovnik in 1986. Concerned at the lack of voice for philosophers in the east who were interested in the analytic approach, with Bill Newton-Smith as her co-editor, she created a journal known initially as the Dubrovnik Papers, and now flourishing as International Studies in the Philosophy of Science. She paid for a young Croatian psychologist's education at Oxford, maintaining throughout that the fees were being met by a fictitious 'Alington trust'. During the siege of Dubrovnik by the JNA in 1991‚Äì1992 during the Croatian war of independence, she refused to leave, seeing it her duty to give comfort and support to the sufferers and to inform the world of the City's distress. Following the collapse of their political regimes, especially that of the former Yugoslavia, she worked to try to restore their academic standards, spending time in Croatia, where she was honoured with a doctorate from the University of Zagreb. Kathy Wilkes was specifically referenced by her colleague Roger Scruton who took her as his model of the English gentleman, arguing that \\"her virtues were revealed in nothing so much, as her habit of concealing them\\". Roger Scruton England: an Elegy (2001) She appeared in the Channel 4 documentary series College Girls, broadcast in 2002 about some St Hilda's students. ==Works== *Physicalism (1978) *Real People (1988), Oxford University Press, *Modelling the Mind (1990) editor with W.

Nelson was the head writer of the series for most of the show's original eleven-year run, and spent half of that time as the on-air host, also named Mike Nelson. In addition to writing books, Nelson is currently part of the online movie riffing site RiffTrax, and was previously part of the straight-to-DVD Film Crew with fellow MST3K alumni, Bill Corbett and Kevin Murphy. ==Early life== Michael Nelson was born in St. Charles, Illinois. His ancestry is Danish, German, and Irish. He lived in Geneva, Illinois, until the age of twelve, when his family moved to north-western Wisconsin. He studied theatre and music at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìRiver Falls, but he left before graduating and moved to the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul area. ==CareerMystery Science Theater 3000=== Nelson was working as a waiter at T.G.I. Friday's and doing occasional stand-up comedy when he was offered a job on Mystery Science Theater 3000, typing the suggestions in the writing room. The writers told him to feel free to make some comments on the movies they were watching, and Nelson impressed them so much with his wit and comedic timing that they made him a staff writer, and, later, head writer. Nelson also appeared frequently in the show's host segments, often playing characters from the movies being mocked such as Torgo from the infamous Manos - The Hands of Fate. When series creator and host Joel Hodgson decided to leave the show half-way through the fifth season, he chose Nelson as his replacement, reportedly because he thought Nelson was a natural leader, a gifted comedian, and a gifted muse, and also because Nelson simply looked good standing next to the show's puppets. Nelson remained in the host role for another five and a half seasons (surviving the show's switching networks from Comedy Central to the Sci-Fi Channel) until the original show's final Sci-Fi Channel episode aired in 1999. ===Post-MST3K=== Writing Since the series ended, Nelson has worked steadily as a writer, publishing several books (as of March 2006): Mike Nelson's Movie Megacheese, Mike Nelson's Mind Over Matters and Mike Nelson's Death Rat!, the last being his first novel. His other works include a series of pop-culture humor books, Happy Kitty Bunny Pony, Goth- Icky, and Love Sick, as well as a monthly column for Home Theater Magazine. He also wrote for the short-lived game show Let's Bowl, which gained a cult following of its own. He has commentary tracks for DVD releases of several films, including Reefer Madness, The Little Shop of Horrors, House on Haunted Hill, Plan 9 from Outer Space, Carnival of Souls, and Night of the Living Dead. With his MST3K co-stars Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett, he was part of a comedy team called \\"The Film Crew\\", which has created comedy segments for National Public Radio. The first Film Crew DVD, Hollywood After Dark, was released July 10, 2007, and three more followed in the months after. Nelson (left) and Mystery Science Theater 3000 co-star Kevin Murphy at a convention panel in Metairie, Louisiana, November 1998. Legend Films  RiffTrax In 2006, Nelson was appointed Chief Content Producer for Legend Films. He is responsible for building and leading the company's creative content, providing continuous commentaries, and developing other premium web-based programming. \\"I'm very excited. Legend Films is such a great fit for me‚Äîtalented people who consistently put out a great product. Plus, there are Flaming Hot Cheetos in the lunch room vending machine. That made it an easy choice to join the team,\\" enthused Nelson. One of the projects put together by Nelson and Legend Films was RiffTrax, a website offering the purchase of downloadable audio commentaries once again costarring two former MST3K cast members Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett. The first commentary made available through the service was for Road House. In a September 2006 interview, Nelson said he felt that Rifftrax may be the closest thing to a reunion of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 team. In 2016, additional MST3K alumni, Joel Hodgson, Trace Beaulieu, and Frank Conniff, all appeared for a live reunion at the State Theatre in Minneapolis with Nelson, Murphy and Corbett. They were also joined by the newest host, Jonah Ray.http://www.rifftrax.com/rifftrax-live-mst3k-reunion Voice work In 2013, Nelson agreed to do voiceover work for Armikrog. Nelson voices the lead character, Tommynaut. Podcasts In 2016 Nelson and David Berge started the podcast Like Trees Walking. They look at life and faith from a Christian perspective, with a lightly humorous, offbeat approach. Since 2017 he has created, with Conor Lastowka, the podcast 372 Pages We'll Never Get Back, which analyses books of dubious quality.http://372pages.com/ ==Personal life== Nelson is married to fellow MST3K writer Bridget Jones, and the pair have two sons.

The Wind River Range (or \\"Winds\\" for short), is a mountain range of the Rocky Mountains in western Wyoming in the United States. The range runs roughly NW‚ÄìSE for approximately . The Continental Divide follows the crest of the range and includes Gannett Peak, which at , is the highest peak in Wyoming; and also Fremont Peak at , the third highest peak in Wyoming. There are more than 40 other named peaks in excess of . With the exception of the Grand Teton in the Teton Range, the next 19 highest peaks in Wyoming after Gannett are also in the Winds. Two large national forests including three wilderness areas encompass most of the mountain range. Shoshone National Forest is on the eastern side of the continental divide while Bridger-Teton National Forest is on the west. Both national forests and the entire mountain range are an integral part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Portions of the east side of the range are inside the Wind River Indian Reservation. ==History== Indigenous peoples of the Great Basin, such as the Shoshones and Absarokas (Crow) Native Americans, lived in the range beginning 7000 and 9000 years ago. Villages as high as in elevation, dating from 700 to 2000 BC, have recently been studied by archaeologists. These villages were established by the Sheepeater band of Shoshone during pine nut harvesting season. One, dubbed \\"High Rise\\", has 60 lodges over a space of 26 acres and was recently added to the National Register of Historic Places.Watson, Traci. \\"Wyoming site reveals more prehistoric mountain villages.\\" USA Today. 20 Oct 2013. Retrieved 20 Oct 2013. One of the men from the Lewis and Clark expedition, John Colter, is thought to be the first European American person to view the range when he visited the area around 1807, though little is known about his travels through the area. In 1812, a party led by Wilson Price Hunt were the first to cross South Pass, at the southern end of the range, the pass which marked the continental divide and crest of the Rocky Mountains and became an important portion of the Oregon Trail. Climbing was pursued in the mid to late 1800s by men such as John C. Fremont, typically for the purpose of surveying the region. Early climbers to come purely for recreation began arriving in the 1920s. Gannett Peak, the range and Wyoming's tallest, was first climbed by Arthur Tate and Floyd Stahlnaker in 1922. Most of the early climbing in the region focused around the Titcomb Basin, slowly radiating outwards. Today, the Titcomb Basin remains one of the area's busiest recreation attractions along with the Cirque of the Towers to the south. Much of the Wind River Range received federal protection as National Forest primitive areas during 1931‚Äì32. The Wind River Range is now largely protected by three federal wilderness areas. These include the Bridger Wilderness on the western slope, designated in 1964, and the Fitzpatrick Wilderness and Popo Agie Wilderness on the eastern slope, designated in 1976 and 1984 respectively. Together these wilderness areas protect , making the Wind River Range one of the largest road-free areas in the continental United States. Part of the eastern slope of the Wind River Range is also under the protection of the Wind River Indian Reservation. ==Geology== The Winds are composed primarily of a granitic batholith which is granite rock formed deep under the surface of the Earth, over one billion years ago. Over hundreds of millions of years, rocks that were once covering this batholith eroded away. As the land continued to rise during the Laramide orogeny, further erosion occurred until all that remained were the granitic rocks. The ice ages beginning 500,000 years ago began carving the rocks into their present shapes. Within the Winds, numerous lakes were formed by the glaciers and numerous cirques, or circular valleys, were carved out of the rocks, the most well known being the Cirque of the Towers, in the southern section of the range. Shoshone National Forest claims that there are 16 named and 140 unnamed glaciers just on the east side of the range for a total of 156, with another 27 reported by Bridger-Teton National Forest for the western slopes of the range. Several of these are the largest glaciers in the U.S. Rocky Mountains. Gannett Glacier which flows down the north slope of Gannett Peak, is the largest single glacier in the Rocky Mountains of the U.S., and is located in the Fitzpatrick Wilderness in Shoshone National Forest. ==Hydrology== Several major rivers have headwaters on either side of the range. The Green and Big Sandy rivers drain southward from the west side of the range, while the Wind River drains eastward through the Shoshone Basin. The Green is the largest fork of the Colorado River while the Wind River, after changing its name to the Bighorn River, is the largest fork of the Yellowstone River. The range includes several canyons on either side, including Silas Canyon and Sinks Canyon both on the eastern side. The canyons are carved by rivers such as the Middle Fork of the Popo Agie which feeds the Wind River. The Bridger Wilderness contains over 1,300 lakes. These lakes range in size from less than to over , with an average size of about . Historically, the lakes and streams of the Bridger Wilderness were devoid of fish, as were most alpine lakes throughout the Rocky Mountains. The first known transplant of fish into the area took place in 1907 when Colorado River cutthroat trout were introduced into North Fork Lake. Considerable fish stocking by individuals, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Wyoming Game & Fish Department, occurred between 1924 and 1935.A Guide to Bridger Wilderness Fishing Lakes. 1979, U.S. Department of Agriculture. ==Ecology== Lake d'Amalia, late 19th century Wind River Range - looking south from atop Fremont Peak - during a backpacking trip. The Winds are known to have a small grizzly bear population, primarily in the northernmost areas. Other mammals include the black bear, elk, moose, mule deer, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, mountain lion and wolverine. Bald eagles, falcons and hawks are just a few of the 300 species of birds known to inhabit the region. The streams and lakes are home to Yellowstone cutthroat, rainbow, brook, brown, lake, and golden trout‚Äîabout 2.5 million of which were stocked by a local explorer named Finis Mitchell and his wife during the Great Depression. The forests are dominated by lodgepole pine, whitebark pine, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce. The range sits alongside many of the animal migration routes in the United States and contains several important passes, notably South Pass, , at the south end of the range, which was one of the more important passes on the Oregon Trail as it passed through the Rockies. Aside from South Pass, which is at the southernmost tip of the range, no roads cross the mountains until Union Pass, at the northern terminus of the range. There are many passes between tall peaks across the continental divide, which runs through the entire range. ==Recreation== The Winds are a popular recreation destination and the vast wilderness areas attract hikers, climbers and skiers. The Winds have many back country areas that see heavy use despite the relative remoteness of many of the trail-heads and the long approaches from those trail-heads to reach routes. Two of the more popular backpacking destinations are the Titcomb Basin (commonly accessed via the Elkhart Park Trailhead)https://backpackers-review.com/trip-reports/titcomb-basin-wind- river-range/ and the Cirque of the Towers (commonly accessed via the Big Sandy Trailhead).https://backpackers-review.com/trip-reports/cirque-of-the-towers- wind-river/ The exposed granite in the higher elevations of the range is particularly attractive to climbers and areas such as Cirque of the Towers in the southern portion of the range are facing overuse issues as a result. According to the White Pine Ski Resort website, the Winds are home to one ski area, White Pine, the only lift-accessible skiing and snowboarding in the range. Located near Pinedale, it is the oldest ski area in Wyoming. ==Trails== The Wind River Range has a number of trailheads for backpackers to explore, including: * Big Sandy (elevation ) * Boulder Lake (elevation ) * Burnt Lake (elevation ) * Elkhart Park (elevation ) * Green River Lake (elevation ) * Half Moon Lake (elevation ) * Meadow Lake (elevation ) * New Fork (elevation ) * Scab Creek (elevation ) * Spring Creek Park (elevation ) A longtime popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts, the Wind River Range has also played host to a number of wilderness and outdoor education programs. The number of trailheads and terrain variety have made it an ideal stage for learning and exploration. ==Hazards== Encountering bears is a concern in the Wind River Range. There are other concerns as well, including bugs, wildfires, adverse snow conditions and nighttime cold temperatures. Importantly, there have been notable incidents, including accidental deaths, due to falls from steep cliffs (a misstep could be fatal in this class 4/5 terrain) and due to falling rocks, over the years, including 1993, 2007 (involving an experienced NOLS leader), 2015 and 2018. Other incidents include a seriously injured backpacker being airlifted near SquareTop Mountain in 2005, and a fatal hiker incident (from an apparent accidental fall) in 2006 that involved state search and rescue. The U.S. Forest Service does not offer updated aggregated records on the official number of fatalities in the Wind River Range. ==See also== * List of mountain peaks of the United States * List of mountain ranges in Wyoming * List of Ultras of the United States ==Notes== ==External links== * General Information on the Wind River Range * Climbing the Wind River Range (more) * Glaciers in the Wind River Range * Shoshone National Forest Federal website * Continental Divide Trail information Category:Bridger‚ÄìTeton National Forest Category:Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem Category:Green River (Colorado River tributary) Category:Landforms of Fremont County, Wyoming Category:Mountain ranges of Wyoming Category:Mountains of Fremont County, Wyoming Category:Mountains of Wyoming Category:Ranges of the Rocky Mountains Category:Shoshone National Forest ","title":"Wind River Range"},{"id":"522324","text":"Henri Alexandre Deslandres (24 July 1853 - 15 January 1948) was a French astronomer, director of the Meudon and Paris Observatories, who carried out intensive studies on the behaviour of the atmosphere of the Sun. ==Biography== Deslandres' undergraduate years at the √âcole Polytechnique were played out against the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War and the chaos of the Paris Commune so, on graduation in 1874, he responded to the continuing military tension with the emerging Germany by embarking on a military career. Rising to the rank of captain in the engineers, he became increasingly interested in physics and, in 1881, resigned his commission to join Alfred Cornu's laboratory at the √âcole Polytechnique, working on spectroscopy. He continued his spectroscopic work at the Sorbonne, earning his doctorate in 1888 and finding numerical patterns in spectral lines that paralleled the work of Johann Balmer and were to catalyse the development of quantum mechanics in the 20th century. In 1868, Pierre Janssen's solar observations had led him to report to the Acad√©mie des Sciences that It is no longer geometry and mechanics which dominate [in astronomy] but physics and chemistry. Such advice was sternly rejected by director of the Paris Observatory Urbain Le Verrier and the French government awarded Janssen a grant to establish an astrophysical observatory at Meudon on the outskirts of Paris with Janssen as the sole astronomer. In 1889, Le Verrier was succeeded by Am√©d√©e Mouchez who set to work to bring astrophysics into the mainstream by hiring Deslandres. Deslandres developed the spectroheliograph simultaneously with George Hale. In 1898, he joined Janssen at Meudon, increasing the scientific staff by 100%. On Janssen's death in 1907, Deslandres became director and embarked on a programme of expansion. Deslandres was the President of the Soci√©t√© Astronomique de France (SAF), the French astronomical society, from 1907-1909.de la Soci√©t√© astronomique de France, 1911, vol. 25, pp. 581-586 At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, though already in his 60s, he returned to active service in the engineers as a major and later lieutenant colonel. In 1918, following the armistice, he resumed his office at Meudon until 1926 when its administration merged with that of the Paris Observatory, Mouchez assuming the role of director of both institutions until his retirement in 1929. He remained active in research right up until his death. Fellow astronomer Raymond Michard observed that In his bearing, his character and his style of life Deslandres always remained more akin to the soldier (and the officer) than to the scholar. ==Honours== Awards *Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, (1913) *Henry Draper Medal of the National Academy of Sciences, (1913) *Prix Jules Janssen, the highest award of the Soci√©t√© astronomique de France, the French astronomical society, (1920) *Bruce Medal of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, (1921) *Fellow of the Royal Society Named after him *The crater Deslandres on the Moon *Deslandres Prize of the French Academy of Sciences *Asteroid 11763 Deslandres ==References== ==External links== *Biography by Joseph S.

More precisely, it facilitates the interconversion of glucose 1-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate. ==Biological FunctionRole in glycogenolysis=== After glycogen phosphorylase catalyzes the phosphorolytic cleavage of a glucosyl residue from the glycogen polymer, the freed glucose has a phosphate group on its 1-carbon. This glucose 1-phosphate molecule is not itself a useful metabolic intermediate, but phosphoglucomutase catalyzes the conversion of this glucose 1-phosphate to glucose 6-phosphate (see below for the mechanism of this reaction). Glucose 6-phosphate‚Äôs metabolic fate depends on the needs of the cell at the time it is generated. If the cell is low on energy, then glucose 6-phosphate will travel down the glycolytic pathway, eventually yielding two molecules of adenosine triphosphate. If the cell is in need of biosynthetic intermediates, glucose 6-phosphate will enter the pentose phosphate pathway, where it will undergo a series of reactions to yield riboses and/or NADPH, depending on cellular conditions. If glycogenolysis is taking place in the liver, glucose 6-phosphate can be converted to glucose by the enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase; the glucose produced in the liver is then released to the bloodstream for use in other organs. Muscle cells in contrast do not have the enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase, so they cannot share their glycogen stores with the rest of the body. ===Role in glycogenesis=== Phosphoglucomutase also acts in the opposite fashion when blood glucose levels are high. In this case, phosphoglucomutase catalyzes the conversion of glucose 6-phosphate (which is easily generated from glucose by the action of hexokinase) to glucose 1-phosphate. This glucose-1-phosphate can then react with UTP to yield UDP- glucose in a reaction catalyzed by UDP-glucose-pyrophosphorylase. If activated by insulin, glycogen synthase will proceed to clip the glucose from the UDP- glucose complex onto a glycogen polymer. ==Reaction mechanism== Phosphoglucomutase affects a phosphoryl group shift by exchanging a phosphoryl group with the substrate. Isotopic labeling experiments have confirmed that this reaction proceeds through a glucose 1,6-bisphosphate intermediate. The first step in the forward reaction is the transfer of a phosphoryl group from the enzyme to glucose 1-phosphate, forming glucose 1,6-bisphosphate and leaving a dephosphorylated form of the enzyme. The enzyme then undergoes a rapid diffusional reorientation to position the 1-phosphate of the bisphosphate intermediate properly relative to the dephosphorylated enzyme. Substrate-velocity relationships and induced transport tests have revealed that the dephosphorylated enzyme then facilitates the transfer of a phosphoryl group from the glucose-1,6-bisphosphate intermediate to the enzyme, regenerating phosphorylated phosphoglucomutase and yielding glucose 6-phosphate (in the forward direction). Later structural studies confirmed that the single site in the enzyme that becomes phosphorylated and dephosphorylated is the oxygen of the active-site serine residue (see diagram below). A bivalent metal ion, usually magnesium or cadmium, is required for enzymatic activity and has been shown to complex directly with the phosphoryl group esterified to the active-site serine. Mechanism for the phosphoglucomutase-catalyzed interconversion of glucose 1-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate. This formation of a glucose 1,6-bisphosphate intermediate is analogous to the interconversion of 2-phosphoglycerate and 3-phosphoglycerate catalyzed by phosphoglycerate mutase, in which 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate is generated as an intermediate. ==Structure== The four domains of rabbit muscle phosphoglucomutase, drawn from . Green = Domain I, Blue = Domain II, Red = Domain III, Yellow = Domain IV. Pink residue = Serine 116. While rabbit muscle phosphoglucomutase has served as the prototype for much of the elucidation of this enzyme's structure, newer bacterium- derived crystal structures exhibit many of the same defining characteristics. Each phosphoglucomutase monomer can be divided into four sequence domains, I-IV, based on the enzyme‚Äôs default spatial configuration (see image at right). Each monomer comprises four distinct Œ±/Œ≤ structural units, each of which contains one of the four strands in each monomer's Œ≤-sheet and is made up only of the residues in a given sequence domain (see image at right). The burial of the active site (including Ser-116, the critical residue on the enzyme that is phosphorylated and dephosphorylated) in the hydrophobic interior of the enzyme serves to exclude water from counterproductively hydrolyzing critical phosphoester bonds while still allowing the substrate to access the active site. ==Disease relevance== Human muscle contains two phosphoglucomutases with nearly identical catalytic properties, PGM I and PGM II. One or the other of these forms is missing in some humans congenitally. PGM deficiency is an extremely rare condition that does not have a set of well-characterized physiological symptoms. This condition can be detected by an in vitro study of anaerobic glycolysis which reveals a block in the pathway toward lactic acid production after glucose 1-phosphate but before glucose 6-phosphate.

Neighboring provinces are from the north clockwise San Luis, C√≥rdoba, Buenos Aires, R√≠o Negro, Neuqu√©n and Mendoza. ==History== Stables at the former Roca-Luro Estate, now the Luro Prairie Preserve. In 1604 Hernandarias was the first European explorer to reach the area; it was later explored by Jer√≥nimo Luis de Cabrera in 1662. But it was not until the 18th century that Spanish colonists established permanent settlements here. Resistance of the local indigenous people prevented much expansion until the government of Juan Manuel de Rosas. It did not cease until Julio Roca's conquest of the desert in the 19th century. The territory was divided between the officers, and they erected the first Spanish settlements. The Territorio Nacional de La Pampa Central was erected in 1884, containing the R√≠o Negro Province and parts of other surrounding provinces. It had around 25,000 inhabitants. By 1915 there were 110,000 residents, a reflection of movement to that area. In 1945 the territory was divided and La Pampa became a province. In 1952 its constitution was written and the province was renamed after Eva Peron. In 1955 after the government changed and the Per√≥ns went into exile, both La Pampa and Chaco, which had been named for Juan Per√≥n, were reverted to their original names. ==Geography== Landscape near Winifreda, La Pampa. There are only two major rivers in the province: the Colorado (\\"Red River\\") on the border with the Province of R√≠o Negro, and the Salado (\\"Salty River\\") crossing it. The Salado's level has been dropping, as its tributaries in the Province of Mendoza are diverted for irrigation. The general aspect of the central-eastern part of the province is that of a plain gently tilted to the east that is dissected by valleys. The surface of the plain has a calcrete crust. The valleys of La Pampa, known as the transverse valleys () are NE-SW oriented, with breadths of various kilometers and lengths of tens of kilometers. Some of the valleys host very large fossil inland dunes. Formerly functioning as windfunnels for sand at present these valleys are an ecotone region between the Dry and Humid Pampas. While mostly flat the province do also contains mountains like Sierra de Lihuel Calel where a variety of landforms can be observed including inselbergs, flared slopes, domes, nubbins, tors, tafonis and gnammas. Most of Sierra de Lihuel Calel is made up ignimbrite, a volcanic rock type that was violently erupted by ancient volcanoes. ===Climate=== K√∂ppen climate map of La Pampa Being located in the Pampas, the province has a cool temperate climate. In general, the province is dominated by two different types of climates: a temperate one in the east and a semi-arid one in the west. Precipitation generally decreases from east to west and from north to south. Being characterized by large thermal amplitudes, the climate of the province has continental characteristics, particularly in the west where thermal amplitudes are much larger. The general atmospheric circulation is one of the most important factors that influence the climate on a regional scale. During summer, the South Atlantic High is displaced to the southeast, which brings hot and humid air masses from the north and northeast. The South Pacific High in summer is responsible for bringing cooler air masses from the southwest which when these two contrasting air masses meet lead to precipitation occurring. In contrast, winters are dry due to the northward displacement of the South Atlantic high and the topographic barrier of the Andes north of 40oS which prevents frontal systems that bring precipitation from reaching the province. Any winds from the southwest during winter bring in cold and dry weather since most of the precipitation and humidity are released in the Andes. As such, most of the precipitation occurs during summer. Temperature Mean annual temperatures in the province range between although the thermal amplitude (difference between temperatures in the warmest and coldest months) is large. In summer, mean temperatures in the warmest month (January) range from in the north and northeastern parts to in the west and southwestern parts of the province. Temperatures tend to be cooler in the west owing to the higher altitudes. In winter, mean temperatures in the coldest month (July) range from in the north to in the west and southwest. The northern parts are the warmest parts of the province; absolute maximum temperatures can reach up to . The lowest temperatures ever recorded range from in the northeast to in the southwest. Precipitation One characteristic of the precipitation in the province is that most of the precipitation occurs from October to March with little precipitation during winter. Mean annual precipitation ranges from a low of in the southwest to in the northeast. Precipitation generally decreases from northeast to southwest. Most of the precipitation is caused by frontal systems. Precipitation is highly variable from year to year. ==Economy== La Pampa, long Argentina's most economically agricultural province, produced an estimated US$3.144 billion in output in 2006, or, US$10,504 per capita (almost 20% above the national average). Now, the GDP per capita of the province is of US$14.000. Agriculture contributes a fourth to La Pampa's economy, the most important activity being cattle ranching, with 3,632,684 (2002) head, which takes place all over the province. Other livestock include 202,428 sheep, 140,498 goats and 64,118 pigs. Parque Luro Natural Prairie Preserve. The Northeast, on the more fertile lands, has also an important activity with wheat (10% of the national production), sunflower (13% of NP), maize, alfalfa, barley, and other cereals. There's also a dairy industry of 300 centres of extraction and 25 cheese factories, honey production, and salt extraction from salt basins. La Pampa is home to very little industry, construction or mining and, so, its services sector accounts for over two-thirds of the economy, a fairly high proportion. Tourism is an underdeveloped activity, however. Visitors start at Santa Rosa and reach Lihu√© Calel National Park, Parque Luro Provincial Reserve or visit one of the many estancias, some of which are dedicated to agritourism. == Government == The provincial government is divided into the usual three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoints the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court. The Constitution of La Pampa Province forms the formal law of the province. In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the La Pampa Provincial Police. ==Political divisions== Civic Center and governor's offices, Santa Rosa.

The novel focuses on the ability of ordinary people, particularly women, to accomplish great things. Velvet is a teenager in the late 1920s, living in a small English coastal village in Sussex, dreaming of one day owning many horses. She is a high-strung, shy, nervous child with a delicate stomach. Her mother is a wise, taciturn woman who was once famous for swimming the English Channel; her father is a butcher. Velvet's best friend is her father's assistant, Mi (Michael) Taylor, whose father ‚Äì as Mrs. Brown's swimming coach ‚Äì helped her cross the channel. Mi formerly worked in stables and is familiar with the horse racing world. One day they both watch The Piebald jump over a five-foot-high cobbled fence to escape a field. Mi remarks that \\"a horse like that'd win the National\\".Enid Bagnold, \\"National Velvet\\", William Morrow & Co. Inc., 1949, p. 67. Velvet becomes obsessed with winning the horse in an upcoming raffle and riding him to greatness. In addition to inheriting several horses from one of her father's customers, Velvet also wins The Pie, her dream horse. After riding him in a local gymkhana, she and Mi seriously consider entering the Grand National steeplechase at Aintree racecourse and train the Piebald accordingly. Mi uses his connections to the horse training/racing world and obtains a fake clearance document for Velvet in the name of James Tasky, a Russian jockey. Velvet wins the race, but is disqualified for dismounting too soon after she slides off the saddle due to exhaustion. Her gender is discovered in the first-aid station. The racing world is both dismayed and fascinated by a young girl's winning its toughest race. Velvet and The Piebald become instant celebrities, with Velvet and her family nearly drowning in notoriety (echoing her mother's unsought fame after swimming the English Channel), complete with merchandising. Velvet strongly objects to the publicity, saying The Piebald is a creature of glory who should not be cheapened in tabloid trash and newsreels. She insists that she did not win the race, the horse did, and she simply wanted to see him go down in history. The National Hunt Committee finds no evidence of fraud, exonerates all involved, and Velvet and her family return to their ordinary lives; or rather, Velvet goes on \\"to her next adventures\\", for clearly she is a person to whom great things happen. ===Film adaptation=== The novel was made into a more or less faithful, highly successful film version in 1944, starring twelve-year-old Elizabeth Taylor and Mickey Rooney, with Donald Crisp, Anne Revere and a young Angela Lansbury. In 2008 the film was voted the ninth best American film in the sports genre. In the film the horse, who was solid coloured, hence not a piebald (British English) or pinto (American English), was renamed The Pie.In the book The Piebald was occasionally abbreviated to The Pie. ===Radio adaptation=== National Velvet was presented on Hallmark Playhouse on the CBS radio network on 6 October 1949. The half-hour adaptation starred Roddy McDowell and Anne Whitfield. ===Television adaptation=== From 1960 to 1962, there was a half- hour B&W; American television series, with Lori Martin, Ann Doran and James McCallion. In this version her horse was named King. This aired on NBC for 52 episodes. ===Film sequel=== A 1978 film sequel, International Velvet, was made starring Tatum O'Neal as Sarah Brown, a young orphaned American teenager living in England with her aunt Velvet Brown (Nanette Newman) after Sarah's parents die in a car accident. Sarah and Velvet purchase the descendant of The Pie after Sarah earns the money by working for Velvet's boyfriend John. They name him Arizona Pie after Sarah's home state. Working with Arizona Pie, Sarah is selected to represent Britain in the equine three-day Olympic event. While working with the horse with trainer Captain Johnson (Anthony Hopkins), she falls for an American competitor, Scott Saunders (Jeffrey Byron). Though distracted by him, she wins the event. Later, after getting engaged to Scott, Sarah returns to England and presents the medal to her aunt Velvet as a keepsake and introduces her and John to Scott. ==References== Category:1935 British novels Category:Novels set in Sussex Category:Horse racing novels Category:British novels adapted into films Category:Novels adapted into television shows la:National Velvet ","title":"National Velvet"},{"id":"522343","text":"Joel Hodgson (born February 20, 1960) is an American writer, comedian and television actor. He is best known for creating Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K) and starring in it as the character Joel Robinson. In 2007, MST3K was listed as \\"one of the top 100 television shows of all time\\" by Time.. From 2007 to 2013, Hodgson was part of the \\"movie riffing\\" project Cinematic Titanic with several of his fellow MST3K alumni, performing live and producing content for DVDs and direct download. He has also served as Creative Lead for Media at Pennsylvania technology firm Cannae. ==Early life and career== Hodgson was born on February 20, 1960 in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, and later moved to Green Bay, Wisconsin. He was raised in an Evangelical Christian upbringing, and later claimed that the various shows his church would put on had a profound influence on his desire to become an entertainer. Hodgson began his career in seventh grade as a magician and ventriloquist. Joel performed for local events in Green Bay, and attended Ashwaubenon High School. Upon graduation, Hodgson moved to Minneapolis to attend Bethel University (Minnesota) to study Theatre and Mass Media. While there, Hodgson further developed his magic act by adding comedy and began opening for musical acts at Bethel as well as performing in coffee houses and comedy clubs. Hodgson cites a Theatre of the Absurd class at Bethel taught by Dr. David Horn for helping him crystallize the meaning of his comedy. In 1981 he won the Campus Comedy Contest and then the first annual Twin Cities Comedy Invitational in 1982. In November of the same year Hodgson moved to Los Angeles where he became a regular performer at the Comedy Store and the Hollywood Magic Castle, as well as the Comedy Magic Club. At the Comedy Magic Club, Hodgson was spotted by Late Night with David Letterman producer Barry Sand and three months later at age 22 had his network television debut. He later made four other appearances on the Letterman show, as well as four on Saturday Night Live as a guest act. Hodgson also was a featured performer on HBO‚Äôs \\"Eighth Annual Young Comedians Special\\" hosted by John Candy along with Bill Maher, Paula Poundstone, and the Amazing Johnathan. He worked at the Comedy Store while in LA, also doing traveling stand-up in San Jose, San Francisco, Detroit, Kansas City and Minneapolis. Hodgson left stand-up in 1985, citing the need for a creative sabbatical, and moved back to Minneapolis. Between 1984 and 1988 - Hodgson's 'official' return to comedy - he built and sold sculptures, worked at a T-shirt factory, designed toys, and began designing and building props (including robots) for other comedians. In 1986 he co-wrote an HBO special with Jerry Seinfeld. He was also considered for the role of Woody Boyd in Cheers. He met Jim Mallon in 1987, and Mallon became production manager at the St. Paul UHF station KTMA Channel 23 in 1988. Hodgson was the first choice to portray \\"Philo\\" in the \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic film UHF, but at the time of the filming in 1988, he had begun the production of a new form of television program for KTMA. ==Mystery Science Theater 3000== Building on his gift for designing toys and other gizmos, Hodgson built three robot puppets and created MST3K in 1988. He starred as the show's long-suffering but inventive protagonist, Joel Robinson, who in the backstory is responsible for creating his own robot companions. Hodgson cites the 1972 film Silent Running influenced the premise of the show. MST3K originally aired on KTMA-TV, before becoming one of the first two shows to be picked up by the Comedy Channel, the forerunner of Comedy Central upon starting operations in 1989. The other show, also created and written by Hodgson, was the short-lived Higgins Boys and Gruber, a sketch comedy program that starred Steve Higgins, David Anthony Higgins and Dave Allen. Hodgson surprised many fans when he left MST3K after its 107th episode, Mitchell in 1993. Hodgson's departure was scripted into the episode with the robot, Gypsy, ejecting Joel from the Satellite of Love in an escape pod after incorrectly believing Joel's captors were plotting to kill him. Michael J. Nelson replaced Hodgson as host for the remainder of the series' run. In contemporary interviews, Hodgson stated he was uncomfortable with acting and being in front of the camera. In 1999, he added that he and producer Jim Mallon had been fighting over creative control of MST3K. His departure allowed the show to continue and gave him the opportunity to focus on his preferred creation and production work rather than on performing, which he did only reluctantly. Hodgson later made a surprise guest appearance in the season premiere for the final season of MST3K (\\"Soultaker\\", episode 1001). The original MST3K ended its run in 1999. Hodgson said in 2008 that he felt leaving MST3K \\"was a bit of a personal tragedy\\" and that he had \\"...created the appearance to the press that I had other plans, but I didn't. It was all to keep [MST3K] alive.\\" He also stated that he felt his run on MST3K \\"...was the perfect job.\\" In a separate interview that year, Hodgson said of his departure from MST3K, \\"I was, like, totally happy at Mystery Science Theater. I loved it. I wanted to stay, but I was basically having a fight with my partner, Jim Mallon. So we weren't getting along and so I just felt like ‚Äî I thought it really could possibly jeopardize the show. It would have been easy to create factions out of the group. And by that time it would not have been a fun show to work on. And so, I felt like I saw it coming and I just thought [leaving] was the best thing at the time.\\" ==Work after MST3K== After MST3K, Hodgson formed Visual Story Tools (VST) with his brother Jim Hodgson. They created a special for an interactive sketch comedy program called The TV Wheel for HBO, which Joel produced and hosted. It aired only once, on Comedy Central, after the last new Comedy Central episode of MST3K. Over the years Hodgson and his brother Jim maintained a side project that utilized the repurposing of movie footage with digital effects; codenamed \\"jollyfilter.\\" Hodgson's other post-MST3K projects and contributions include Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves, You Don't Know Jack, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and Everything You Need to Know. In 1999, Hodgson played a recurring role as a disco-loving clothing store salesman and DJ on the television show Freaks and Geeks. Hodgson was featured as the cover story in the November 1996 issue of Genii magazine. Hodgson at Dragon Con, 2008 In 2007, he portrayed Blackbeard the pirate in two episodes of The Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd and recently joined fellow MST3K alum Frank Conniff's monthly comedy revue Cartoon Dump, helming his self- created puppet \\"Dumpster Diver Dan.\\" He has since starred in the science fiction computer game Darkstar: The Interactive Movie as Scythe Commander Kane Cooper. Joel also reunited with Jerry Seinfeld as a guest on his web show, Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee. In 2013, he reprised his role as Joel Robinson for a brief cameo appearance in two episodes of the fourth season of Arrested Development, along with Trace Beaulieu as Crow. Since 2013, he has been voicing recurring character Mayor Bill Dewey in the Cartoon Network original animated series Steven Universe. In 2015, he appeared as Zalien Fletcher, a long-haired, laid-back, dim-witted engineer on the Paul Feig produced space comedy Other Space, which premiered on Yahoo! Screen on April 14, 2015. Fellow Mystery Science Theater 3000 alum Trace Beaulieu also appears as Zalien's robot pal Art, an homage to MST3K. ==Cinematic Titanic== On October 30, 2007, Hodgson announced he was starting a new show with the same \\"riffing on bad movies\\" premise as MST3K called Cinematic Titanic, together with former MST3K cast and crew members Trace Beaulieu, J. Elvis Weinstein, Frank Conniff and Mary Jo Pehl. In 2012, he began touring a one-man show detailing his life and career through slides, video, and live interaction titled Riffing Myself. Cinematic Titanic completed the final tour on December 30, 2013. ==Mystery Science Theater 3000 revival== On November 10, 2015, Joel Hodgson launched a Kickstarter campaign to bring back MST3K for another season. The Kickstarter closed with over $6.3 million in funding (including \\"add-on rewards\\" offered through a separate site), allowing Hodgson to plan to produce fourteen new episodes. The project was released on Netflix as Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return in April, 2017, and stars comedian Jonah Ray as Jonah Heston, alongside original co-star robots (puppets voiced by actors) Tom Servo, Crow, and Gypsy, much like when Hodgson hosted the show himself. Hodgson himself makes an appearance on this series as \\"Ardy,\\" although he is hidden under a HAZMAT suit in this character. The series was met with mainly positive reviews, and has been certified \\"Fresh\\" by Rotten Tomatoes, and features a nationwide live tour, titled \\"MST3K Live! Watch Out for Snakes! Tour.\\" Hodgson will be present for each show, marking the first time he's hosted the show in several years, and his first time hosting alongside Jonah Ray. ==References* Joel Hodgson's Inspirational Quotes Category:1960 births Category:20th-century American male actors Category:21st-century American male actors Category:American comedy writers Category:American male comedians Category:American male television actors Category:American stand-up comedians Category:American television writers Category:Living people Category:Male actors from Wisconsin Category:American male television writers Category:People from Green Bay, Wisconsin Category:People from Stevens Point, Wisconsin Category:Prop comics Category:Male actors from Los Angeles Category:Writers from Los Angeles Category:Screenwriters from California Category:Screenwriters from Wisconsin Category:Comedians from California Category:20th-century American comedians Category:21st-century American comedians ","title":"Joel Hodgson"},{"id":"522347","text":"The pelagic zone consists of the water column of the open ocean, and can be further divided into regions by depth. The word \\"pelagic\\" is derived .pelagic (adj.) Online Etymological Dictionary. Retrieved 17 February 2020. The pelagic zone can be thought of in terms of an imaginary cylinder or water column that goes from the surface of the sea almost to the bottom. Conditions in the water column change with distance from the surface (depth): the pressure increases; the temperature and amount of light decreases; the salinity and amount of dissolved oxygen, as well as micronutrients such as iron, magnesium and calcium, all change. Rather like the Earth's atmosphere, but depending on how deep the water is, the water column can be divided vertically into up to five different layers, as illustrated on the right. In addition to the above changes, marine life is affected by bathymetry (underwater topography), by the proximity to land that is underwater such as the seafloor or a shoreline or a submarine seamount. Marine life is also affected by the proximity of the ocean surface, the boundary between the ocean and the atmosphere, which can bring light for photosynthesis but can also bring predation from above and wind stirring up waves and setting currents in motion. The pelagic zone refers to open and free waters in the body of the ocean that stretch between the ocean surface and the ocean bottom and are not too close to some boundary, like a shore or the seafloor or the surface. Marine life living in the pelagic zone can swim freely in any direction, unhindered by topographical constraints. The oceanic zone is the deep open ocean beyond the continental shelf. These offshore waters contrast with the inshore or coastal waters near the coast, such as in estuaries or on the continental shelf. Waters can plunge in the oceanic zone to the depths of the abyssopelagic and even the hadopelagic. Coastal waters are generally confined to the relatively shallow epipelagic, though these are still pelagic waters providing they are not near the seafloor. Altogether, the pelagic zone occupies 1,330 million km3 (320 million mi3) with a mean depth of and maximum depth of .Ocean's Depth and Volume Revealed OurAmazingPlanet, 19 May 2010. Fish that live in the pelagic zone are called pelagic fish. Pelagic life decreases with increasing depth. The pelagic zone can be contrasted with the benthic and demersal zones at the bottom of the sea. The benthic zone is the ecological region at the very bottom of the sea. It includes the sediment surface and some subsurface layers. Marine organisms living in this zone, such as clams and crabs, are called benthos. The demersal zone is just above the benthic zone. It can be significantly affected by the seabed and the life that lives there. Fish that live in the demersal zone are called demersal fish, and can be divided into benthic fish, which are denser than water so they can rest on the bottom, and benthopelagic fish, which swim in the water column just above the bottom. Demersal fish are also known as bottom feeders and groundfish. ==Depth and layers== Depending on how deep the sea is, the pelagic zone can extend to five vertical regions in the ocean. From the top down, these are: ===Epipelagic (sunlight)=== This is the illuminated zone at the surface of the sea where enough light is available for photosynthesis. Nearly all primary production in the ocean occurs here. Consequently, plants and animals are largely concentrated in this zone. Examples of organisms living in this zone are plankton, floating seaweed, jellyfish, tuna, many sharks and dolphins. ===Mesopelagic (twilight)=== The most abundant organisms thriving into the mesopelagic zone are heterotrophic bacteria. Examples of animals that live here are swordfish, squid, Anarhichadidae or \\"wolffish\\" and some species of cuttlefish. Many organisms that live in this zone are bioluminescent.The Open Ocean - MarineBio.org Some creatures living in the mesopelagic zone rise to the epipelagic zone at night to feed. ===Bathypelagic (midnight)=== The name stems . At this depth, the ocean is pitch black, apart from occasional bioluminescent organisms, such as anglerfish. No living plant exists here. Most animals living here survive by consuming the detritus falling from the zones above, which is known as \\"marine snow\\", or, like the marine hatchetfish, by preying on other inhabitants of this zone. Other examples of this zone's inhabitants are giant squid, smaller squids and the grimpoteuthis or \\"dumbo octopus\\". The giant squid is hunted here by deep-diving sperm whales. ===Abyssopelagic (abyssal zone)=== The name is derived (a holdover from the times when the deep ocean, or abyss, was believed to be bottomless). Very few creatures live in the cold temperatures, high pressures and complete darkness of this depth. Among the species found in this zone are several species of squid; echinoderms including the basket star, swimming cucumber, and the sea pig; and marine arthropods including the sea spider. Many of the species living at these depths are transparent and eyeless because of the total lack of light in this zone. ===Hadopelagic (hadal zone)=== The name is derived from the realm of Hades, the Greek underworld. This is the deepest part of the ocean at more than or , depending on authority. Such depths are generally located in trenches. ==Pelagic ecosystem== Some representative ocean animals (not drawn to scale) within their approximate depth-defined ecological habitats. Marine microorganisms also exist on the surfaces and within the tissues and organs of the diverse life inhabiting the ocean, across all ocean habitats. The animals rooted to or living on the ocean floor are not pelagic but are benthic animals.Apprill, A. (2017)\\"Marine animal microbiomes: toward understanding host‚Äìmicrobiome interactions in a changing ocean\\". Frontiers in Marine Science, 4: 222. . 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. The pelagic ecosystem is based on phytoplankton. Phytoplankton manufacture their own food using a process of photosynthesis. Because they need sunlight, they inhabit the upper, sunlit epipelagic zone, which includes the coastal or neritic zone. Biodiversity diminishes markedly in the deeper zones below the epipelagic zone as dissolved oxygen diminishes, water pressure increases, temperatures become colder, food sources become scarce, and light diminishes and finally disappears.Walker P and Wood E (2005) The Open Ocean (volume in a series called Life in the sea), Infobase Publishing, . ===Pelagic invertebrates=== Some examples of pelagic invertebrates include krill, copepods, jellyfish, decapod larvae, hyperiid amphipods, rotifers and cladocerans. Thorson's rule states that benthic marine invertebrates at low latitudes tend to produce large numbers of eggs developing to widely dispersing pelagic larvae, whereas at high latitudes such organisms tend to produce fewer and larger lecithotrophic (yolk-feeding) eggs and larger offspring. ===Pelagic fish=== Pelagic fish live in the water column of coastal, ocean, and lake waters, but not on or near the bottom of the sea or the lake. They can be contrasted with demersal fish, which live on or near the bottom, and coral reef fish. These fish are often migratory forage fish, which feed on plankton, and the larger fish that follow and feed on the forage fish. Examples of migratory forage fish are herring, anchovies, capelin, and menhaden. Examples of larger pelagic fish which prey on the forage fish are billfish, tuna, and oceanic sharks. ===Pelagic reptiles=== Pelamis platura, the pelagic sea snake, is the only one of the 65 species of marine snakes to spend its entire life in the pelagic zone. It bears live young at sea and is helpless on land. The species sometimes forms aggregations of thousands along slicks in surface waters. The pelagic sea snake is the world's most widely distributed snake species. The pelagic albatross ranges over huge areas of ocean and can circle the globe. Many species of sea turtles spend the first years of their lives in the pelagic zone, moving closer to shore as they reach maturity. ===Pelagic birds=== Pelagic birds, also called oceanic birds or seabirds, live on open seas and oceans rather than inland or around more restricted waters such as rivers and lakes. Pelagic birds feed on planktonic crustaceans, squid and forage fish. Examples are the Atlantic puffin, macaroni penguins, sooty terns, shearwaters, and Procellariiformes such as the albatross, Procellariidae and petrels. ==References== ==Further reading== * Ryan, Paddy \\"Deep-sea creatures\\" Te Ara ‚Äì the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 21 September 2007 * \\"Pelagic-zone (oceanography)\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 21 March 2009. * Grantham HS, Game ET, Lombard AT, et al.

It has a face-centered cubic (\\"zincblende\\") crystal structure, identical to that of GaAs and most of the III-V semiconductors. ==Manufacturing== Indium phosphide nanocrystalline surface obtained by electrochemical etching and viewed under scanning electron microscope.

InP is also used as a substrate for epitaxial indium gallium arsenide based opto-electronic devices. == Applications == The application fields of InP splits up into three main areas. It is used as the basis \\\\- for optoelectronic components \\\\- for high-speed electronics. \\\\- for photovoltaics There is still a vastly under-utilized, yet technically exciting zone in the electromagnetic spectrum between microwaves and infrared, often referred to as ‚ÄúTerahertz‚Äù. Electromagnetic waves in this range possess hybrid properties they show high-frequency- and optical characteristics simultaneously. InP based components unlock this spectral range for important new applications. === Optoelectronic Applications === InP based lasers and LEDs can emit light in the very broad range of 1200 nm up to 12 ¬µm. This light is used for fibre based Telecom and Datacom applications in all areas of the digitalised world. Light is also used for sensing applications. On one hand there are spectroscopic applications, where a certain wavelength is needed to interact with matter to detect highly diluted gases for example. Optoelectronic terahertz is used in ultra-sensitive spectroscopic analysers, thickness measurements of polymers and for the detection of multilayer coatings in the automotive industry. On the other hand there is a huge benefit of specific InP lasers because they are eye safe. The radiation is absorbed in the vitreous body of the human eye and cannot harm the retina. === Telecom/Datacom === Indium Phosphide (InP) is used to produce efficient lasers, sensitive photodetectors and modulators in the wavelength window typically used for telecommunications, i.e., 1550 nm wavelengths, as it is a direct bandgap III-V compound semiconductor material. The wavelength between about 1510 nm and 1600 nm has the lowest attenuation available on optical fibre (about 0.26 dB/km). InP is a commonly used material for the generation of laser signals and the detection and conversion of those signals back to electronic form. Wafer diameters range from 2-4 inches. Applications are: ‚Ä¢ Long-haul optical fibre connections over great distance up to 5000 km typically >10 Tbit/s ‚Ä¢ Metro ring access networks ‚Ä¢ Company networks and data center ‚Ä¢ Fibre to the home ‚Ä¢ Connections to wireless 3G, LTE and 5G base stations ‚Ä¢ Free space satellite communication === Optical Sensing === Spectroscopic Sensing aiming environmental protection and identification of dangerous substances ‚Ä¢ A growing field is sensing based on the wavelength regime of InP. One example for Gas Spectroscopy is drive test equipment with real-time measurement of (CO, CO2, NOX [or NO + NO2]). ‚Ä¢ Another example is FT-IR-Spectrometer VERTEX with a terahertz source. The terahertz radiation is generated from the beating signal of 2 InP lasers and an InP antenna that transforms the optical signal to the terahertz regime. ‚Ä¢ Stand-Off detection of traces of explosive substances on surfaces, e.g. for safety applications on airports or crime scene investigation after assassination attempts. ‚Ä¢ Quick verification of traces of toxic substances in gases and liquids (including tap water) or surface contaminations down to the ppb level. ‚Ä¢ Spectroscopy for non-destructive product control of e.g. food (early detection of spoiled foodstuff) ‚Ä¢ Spectroscopy for many novel applications, especially in air pollution control are being discussed today and implementations are on the way. === LiDAR systems for the automotive sector and industry 4.0 === Widely discussed in the LiDAR arena is the wavelength of the signal. While some players have opted for 830-to-940-nm wavelengths to take advantage of available optical components, companies (including Blackmore, Neptec, Aeye, and Luminar) are increasingly turning to longer wavelengths in the also-well- served 1550-nm wavelength band, as those wavelengths allow laser powers roughly 100 times higher to be employed without compromising public safety. Lasers with emission wavelengths longer than ‚âà 1.4 Œºm are often called ‚Äúeye- safe‚Äù because light in that wavelength range is strongly absorbed in the eye's cornea, lens and vitreous body and therefore cannot damage the sensitive retina). ‚Ä¢ LiDAR-based sensor technology can provide a high level of object identification and classification with three-dimensional (3D) imaging techniques. ‚Ä¢ The automotive industry will adopt a chip-based, low cost solid state LiDAR sensor technology instead of large, expensive, mechanical LiDAR systems in the future. ‚Ä¢ For the most advanced chip-based LiDAR systems, InP will play an important role and will enable autonomous driving. (Report: Blistering Growth for Automotive Lidar, Stewart Wills). The longer eye safe wavelength is also more appropriate dealing with real world conditions like dust, fog and rain. === High-speed electronics === Today's semiconductor technology allows the creation and detection of very high frequencies of 100 GHz and higher. Such components find their applications in wireless high-speed data communication (directional radio), radars (compact, energy-efficient and highly resolving), and radiometric sensing e. g. for weather- or atmospheric observations. InP is also used to realize high-speed microelectronics and such semiconductor devices are the fastest devices available today. Typically, microelectronics on InP is based on High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMT) or on Heterostructure Bipolar Transistors (HBT). The sizes and volumes of both transistors based on InP material is very small: 0.1 ¬µm x 10 ¬µm x 1¬µm. Typical substrate thicknesses are < 100 ¬µm. These transistors are assembled into circuits and modules for the following applications: ‚Ä¢ Security scanning systems: Imaging systems for airport security imaging and scanners for civil security applications ‚Ä¢ Wireless communications: High-speed 5G wireless communications will explore InP technology due to its superior performance. Such systems operate at frequencies beyond 100 GHz in order to support high data rates ‚Ä¢ Biomedical applications: Millimeter-wave and THz spectrometers are employed for non-invasive diagnostics in medical applications from cancer tissue identification, diabetes detection, to medical diagnostics using human exhaled air. ‚Ä¢ Non-destructive testing: Industrial applications employ scanning systems for quality control in e.g. automotive paint thickness applications and defects in composite materials in aerospace ‚Ä¢ Robotics: Robotic vision is essentially based on high resolution imaging radar systems at millimetre-waves ‚Ä¢ Radiometric sensing: Almost all components and pollutions in the atmosphere show characteristic absorptions/emissions (fingerprints) in the microwave range. InP allows to fabricate small, lightweight and mobile systems to identify such substances. === Photovoltaic applications === Photovoltaic cells with highest efficiencies of up to 46% (Press Release, Fraunhofer ISE, 1. December 2014) implement InP substrates to achieve an optimal bandgap combination to efficiently convert solar radiation into electrical energy. Today, only InP substrates achieve the lattice constant to grow the required low bandgap materials with high crystalline quality. Research groups all over the world are looking for replacements due to the high costs of these materials. However, up to now all other options yield lower material qualities and hence lower conversion efficiencies. Further research focusses on the re-use of the InP substrate as template for the production of further solar cells. Also today‚Äôs state-of-the-art high- efficiency solar cells for concentrator photovoltaics (CPV) and for space applications use (Ga)InP and other III-V compounds to achieve the required bandgap combinations. Other technologies, such as Si solar cells, provide only half the power than III-V cells and furthermore show much stronger degradation in the harsh space environment. Finally, Si-based solar cells are also much heavier than III-V solar cells and yield to a higher amount of space debris. One way to significantly increase conversion efficiency also in terrestrial PV systems is the use of similar III-V solar cells in CPV systems where only about one-tenth of a percent of the area is covered by high-efficiency III-V solar cells. ==Chemistry== Indium phosphide also has one of the longest-lived optical phonons of any compound with the zincblende crystal structure. ==References== ==External links== *Extensive site on the physical properties of indium phosphide (Ioffe institute) **Band structure and carrier concentration of InP. *InP conference series at IEEE *Indium Phosphide: Transcending frequency and integration limits.

Visualizing a Fischer projection. The Fischer projection, devised by Emil Fischer in 1891, is a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional organic molecule by projection. Fischer projections were originally proposed for the depiction of carbohydrates and used by chemists, particularly in organic chemistry and biochemistry. The use of Fischer projections in non-carbohydrates is discouraged, as such drawings are ambiguous when confused with other types of drawing. == Conventions == All non-terminal bonds are depicted as horizontal or vertical lines. The carbon chain is depicted vertically, with carbon atoms sometimes not shown and represented by the center of crossing lines (see figure below). The orientation of the carbon chain is so that the first carbon (C1) is at the top.Understanding Fischer Projection and Angular Line Representation Conversion Luis F. Moreno Journal of Chemical Education 2012 89 (1), 175-176 In an aldose, C1 is the carbon of the aldehyde group; in a ketose, C1 is the carbon closest to the ketone group, which is typically found at C2. In a Fischer projection, all horizontal bonds are meant to be slanted toward the viewer. Molecules with a simple tetrahedral geometry can be easily rotated in space, so that this condition is met (see figures). For instance, a monosaccharide with three carbon atoms (triose), such as the D-Glyceraldehyde depicted above has a tetrahedral geometry, with C2 at its center, and can be rotated in space so that the carbon chain is vertical with C1 at the top, and the horizontal bonds connecting C2 with -H and -OH are both slanted toward the viewer. However, when creating a Fischer projection for a monosaccharide with more than three carbons, there's no way to orient the molecule in space so that all horizontal bonds will be slanted toward the viewer. After rotating the molecule so that both the horizontal bonds with C2 are slanted toward the viewer, the horizontal bonds with C3 will be typically slanted away. So, after drawing the bonds with C2, before drawing the bonds with C3 the molecule must be rotated in space by 180¬∞ about its vertical axis. Further similar rotations may be needed to complete the drawing. This implies that in most cases a Fischer projection is not an accurate representation of the actual 3D configuration of a molecule. It can be regarded as a projection of a modified version of the molecule, ideally twisted at multiple levels along its backbone. For instance, an open-chain molecule of D-glucose rotated so that the horizontal bonds with C2 are slanted toward the viewer, would have the bonds with C3 and C5 slanted away from the viewer, and hence its accurate projection would not coincide with a Fischer projection. For a more accurate representation of an open-chain molecule, a Natta projection may be used. According to IUPAC rules, all hydrogen atoms should preferably be drawn explicitly; in particular, the hydrogen atoms of the end group of carbohydrates should be present. Graphical representation of stereochemical configuration (IUPAC Recommendations 2006), p.1933-1934 In this regard Fischer projection is different from skeletal formulae. == Usage == Fischer projections are most commonly used in biochemistry and organic chemistry to represent monosaccharides. They can also be used for amino acids or for other organic molecules, although this is discouraged by the 2006 IUPAC recommendations. A Fischer projection can be used to differentiate between L- and D- molecules. For instance, by definition, in a Fischer projection the penultimate (next-to-last) carbon of D-sugars are depicted with hydrogen on the left and hydroxyl on the right. L-sugars will be shown with the hydrogen on the right and the hydroxyl on the left. == Other systems == Haworth projections are a related chemical notation used to represent sugars in ring form. The groups on the right hand side of a Fischer projection are equivalent to those below the plane of the ring in Haworth projections.Matthews, C. E.; K. E. Van Holde; K. G. Ahern (1999) Biochemistry. 3rd edition. Benjamin Cummings. Fischer projections should not be confused with Lewis structures, which do not contain any information about three dimensional geometry. Wedge- and-dash notation is used to represent the stereochemistry of most classes of organic compounds, with Newman projections being used to depict specific conformations of rotatable bonds of organic molecules (including but not limited to carbohydrates). == See also == * Structural formula * Skeletal formula * Haworth projection * Newman projection * Natta projection ==References== Category:Carbohydrate chemistry Category:Stereochemistry Category:Emil Fischer Category:1891 in science Category:1891 in Germany ","title":"Fischer projection"},{"id":"522387","text":"Dahir Rayale Kahin (, ) (born 12 March 1952) is a Somaliland politician who was President of Somaliland from 2002 to 2010.

He hails from the Jibreel Younis sub-clan of the Gadabuursi clan. He was educated in Amoud, and was later trained in Mogadishu. ==CareerEarly career=== Kahin's previous posts included a diplomatic position at the Somali Embassy in Djibouti. In the last years of the Siad Barre government, during the 1980s, Kahin was the highest-ranking National Security Service (NSS) officer in Berbera.Human Rights Watch (Organization), Chris Albin-Lackey, Hostages to peace: threats to human rights and democracy in Somaliland, (Human Rights Watch: 2009), p.13. From 1997 to 2002, Kahin served as the Vice President of Somaliland. ===President of Somaliland=== On 3 May 2002, Kahin became the third President of Somaliland, after the death of the autonomous region's President Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal. Kahin later won the elections on 14 April 2003, representing the Ururka Dimuqraadiga Umada Bahawday (UDUB), or United Democratic People's Party. He was sworn into office on 16 May. In 2008, Kahin established by decree new regions and districts, which drew criticism.Somaliland President Creates New Regions and Districts, Hiiraan Online, March 24, 2008. Accessed on 5 February 2015. Regions and districts in Somaliland are not just an instrument for the organisation of local government, they are also used as electoral districts. Kahin's move was considered by several to have motives rooted in electoral and clan-politics. Moreover, as these new regions and districts were never geographically delimitated, they argued that he saddled the region with a legacy that hampers the efficient organisation of local government to this day.See: Somaliland Local Government Re‚Äêorganisation through Presidential Decrees in an Election Year, by Ibrahim Hashi Jama, Somalilandlaw.com, 7 April 2008.

Neighbouring provinces are, moving clockwise from the north, La Rioja, San Luis and Mendoza. It borders with Chile to the west. The province has an area of 89,651 km2, covering a mountainous region with scarce vegetation, fertile oases and turbulent rivers. Throughout the entire province there are an important number of paleontological sites. Similar to other regions in Argentina, agriculture is one of the most important economic activities, highlighting wine production and olive oil. Additionally, a variety of fruits and vegetables are produced in the fertile valleys irrigated by artificial channels in the western part, close to the Andes mountain range. This is the second province in volume of wine production at the national level and in South America, and possesses outstanding varietal wines. It is also an important center of mining and oil production. ==History== Downtown San Juan, 1910. Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, Governor of San Juan in 1862‚Äì64, he enacted the nation's first compulsory education laws, which became a national policy when he was elected president in 1868. Scene following the 1944 earthquake Before the arrival of Spanish conquistadores, different tribes like Huarpes, Diaguitas, Capazanes, Olongastas and Yacampis, highly influenced by the Inca empire, inhabited the area. The city of San Juan de la Frontera was founded by Juan Jufr√© y Montesa in 1562 and relocated 2 kilometres south in 1593 due to the frequent flooding of the San Juan River. In 1776, San Juan was annexed to the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata, becoming one of the cities of the Province of Cuyo. In the same year, the first recorded earthquake caused massive damage to the city. The father of Argentine independence, Gen. Jose de San Martin, was appointed Governor of the Province of Cuyo in 1814. From there, San Martin began his legendary crossing of the Andes, one of military history's great tactical decisions. San Juan, then a small town, was a great supporter of the expedition supplying gold, men and mules. In 1820, San Juan was granted autonomy from the Province of Cuyo, thereby becoming an autonomous province. The remainder of Cuyo region became Mendoza Province. Following an era of international isolation for Argentina, the advent of new, more liberal government in 1853 attracted a number of exiled intellectuals back into San Juan. Among these, was a San Juan military officer and novelist named Domingo Sarmiento. Sarmiento was eventually elected governor in 1862, pursuing sorely needed public investments and enacting Argentina's first law mandating compulsory education (at that time about 80% of the adult population lacked any form of education). Once elected President of Argentina in 1868, those policies became national law. In 1944 a moderate, yet highly destructive earthquake near the capital destroyed most of the city and killed 10,000 people. A fundraiser was organized to raise money for the victims of the quake where Colonel Juan Per√≥n met his eventual wife and political companion Eva Duarte. A more powerful earthquake stuck the same city in 1977; however new construction codes put in effect following the 1944 incident kept damage to a relative minimum. The most noteworthy loss following this event was the destruction of the Cathedral of San Juan (image, at top). A new, modernist house of worship was quickly put up in its place and inaugurated in 1979. Among the most rapidly growing provinces in Argentina after 1945, the national government began the construction of the National University of San Juan, which opened its doors in 1973. Congress further responded to the needs of San Juan's growing agricultural sector by breaking ground in the mid '70s for the largest hydrostructural project in the province up to that point, the Ullum Dam and Reservoir. Inaugurated in 1980, it has contributed to the province's production of irrigated desert crops, like olives, figs and, most importantly, wine grapes. Jose Luis Gioja, alongside Cristina Kirchner at the opening of the Caracoles Dam. In 2005, Barrick Gold Corporation, one of the world's largest gold-mining conglomerates, announced the purchase of large tracts in the San Juan Andes where a gold mine was started. These have, so far, been yielding over 11,000 ounces of gold yearly, though evidence suggests these activities may be having an adverse impact on San Juan's glaciers. In 2007, the same company installed the world's highest-situated wind turbine at the Veladero mine in San Juan Province at nearly 4,200m elevation. ==Geography and climate== The Andes as seen from Estancia Maradona The province is part of the continental semi-desert Cuyo region. The arid plains start on the east, with a few low hills in the middle and swiftly turn into 6,000-meter-high mountain peaks towards the west. Both areas are subject to the dry hot Zonda (a kind of foehn wind). Most of the precipitations take place during the summer, often as electrical storms. The hot wind has modeled the clay-rich red soil into Pampa del Leoncito (Reserva Natural Estricta El Leoncito) and Valle de la Luna (Parque Provincial Ischigualasto) 200-million-year-old geological formations. The J√°chal and San Juan rivers, both part of Desaguadero River system, are the source of fertile valleys and centre of the province's economy. The San Juan River finishes in the Huanacache lagoons (sometimes called Guanacache), on the southeast. The Andes of San Juan Province belong to the Dry Andes climatic province. Permafrost is widespread above 3000 masl in the Andes and rock glaciers are common. ==Population== San Juan concentrates most of its population in the oases or central valleys, Tulum Valley, Zonda, Ullum and J√°chal, containing nearly 80% of this population. The remaining is located in the oasis located at the foot of the Andes in Iglesias and Calingasta. Another population concentration is in Fertile Valley. ==Economy== Vineyards on the Andes foothills. San Juan focuses its economy in agriculture, specially wine production. Additionally, preserved foods production is highly developed. Mining is a growing activity, with the extraction of various minerals financed by multinational companies. Tourism is a relatively new and flourishing activity and it is becoming an important source of revenue for the province. San Juan's is a somewhat underdeveloped, yet diversified, economy. Its output was estimated in 2006 at US$3.613 billion, or US$5,827 per capita (a third less than the national average). Agriculture has, traditionally, played a small, though significant role in San Juan's economy. The province produces crops not widely grown in other regions of Argentina. San Juan is the second- largest producer of Argentine Wine, after neighboring Mendoza Province. The winemaking industry reached San Juan between the years 1569 and 1589 carried by the Spanish conquistadors. Blessed by the optimal weather conditions and soil, the wine-making largely expanded and accelerated development in the province. Since the beginning, the inhabitants of the region understood that the arid climate required an advanced artificial irrigation system with dams and channels. Viticulture is the main crop of the province's economy, with some 500 km¬≤ (56% of the productive area), and the rest is reserved for wine production counting 90% of the crop. Other products include tomato, maize, potato, fig and peach. Since 1980, San Juan has experienced an industrial expansion that now includes, in addition to the wineries, food processing plants, chemical, plastics, iron, auto parts and textiles factories. Manufacturing now accounts for nearly 20% of San Juan's production output. In the year 2000, the province came into mineral development with the Veladero Project of Barrick Gold, which, on the first year of mining alone, yielded more than 11,000 ounces of gold. These efforts were intensified with more projects including the Easter Lama, with the particularity that it is shared with neighboring Chile. The more widespread mining products are gold, lead, graphite and clay. Large-scale efforts began, in 2006, in the search for petroleum in the department of J√°chal. Energy production is mainly hydroelectric, produced by a few dams such as Quebrada de Ullum, La Roza, San Emiliano and El Pinar Station, which also help to regulate the water level for irrigation of the arid lands. Electricity is also produced, in a lesser proportion, by thermal power stations. San Juan has recently started to have a flourishing tourism industry. Remarkable places are the city of San Juan, the Ischigualasto Provincial Park, the Ullum Dam, San Guillermo National Park, the Pismanta hot springs, the Mercedario Mount and the pagan Difunta Correa shrine. These sites are specially suitable for ecotourism or adventure tourism. Furthermore, an increase in agrotourism has started recently, particularly, around the wine industry, creating the so-called \\"Wine Routes.\\" == Government == San Juan Provincial Police The provincial government is divided into three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoints the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court. The Constitution of San Juan Province, Argentina forms the formal law of the province. In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the San Juan Provincial Police. ==Political division== Huaco, J√°chal Department. Tunnel on National Route 150, Iglesia Department The province is divided into 19 departments ().

This features create a unique landscape that is beginning to be intensively exploited by tourism. Tourism infrastructure has been also improved recently with the installation of a considerable number of hotels and other accommodation. Heavily developed areas are the northwest, in the town of Rodeo, where posts and countryside hotels have been installed. In the west, the towns of Calingasta Barreal and Tamber√≠as, many projects are being develop to foster adventure tourism by with the practice of climbing the Mount Mercedario, which is one of the highest peaks in America. The northern zone, J√°chal, is known for its cultural tourism related to the gaucho tradition. Ischigualasto national park Nevertheless, San Juan is the economic center of the province and also the most visited place. It is known for its modern architecture that differentiates it from others cities in the rest of the country, with wide tree-lined streets as well as hardwood parks, plazas and walkways, in the middle of the desert of San Juan. This is the cause for which has the nickname of 'city oasis'. The city holds several attractions such as Sarmiento's birthplace and modern Cathedral, among others. A number of joyful celebrations are held in the province, combining old and new traditions that pay homage to economic activities or natural events like Fiesta Nacional del Sol, which takes the form of annual parades carousel and various artistic performances. Valle F√©rtil. The winter sports industry has a prosper future in the province. A ski resort is under development, located in the mountainous area of Calingasta, western part of the province, where the largest ski tracks in South America are being constructed. This will be the northernmost ski resort in Argentina and will be known as Manantiales'Manantiales ski resort project home page, http://manantiales.inar.net/ ==Transportation== San Juan has a good transportation network, as most of the routes that connect with the rest of the country are in very good maintenance condition. The more important routes are the RN40, which crosses from north to south and joins the provinces of Mendoza and La Rioja, the RN20, which links San Juan with the city of Buenos Aires and Cordoba, the RN150, which allows a connection to the country of Chile. There are important projects under way that will allow a connection with the province of La Rioja, the entire northern Fertile Valley, J√°chal and Church, and with Chile, which will be a vital part of the strategic corridor Pacific-Atlantic . Motorway in Santa Lucia This project for the construction of a communication path connecting the Pacific ports of (Coquimbo, Chile) and Atlantic (Porto Alegre, Brazil) by Paso de Agua Negra, has been under development for more than a decade. Its importance lies in the necessity of the Southern Cone countries to put their export production into the global market at lower costs. Long distance transportation exists and allows weekly trips to almost all the other provinces and cities in the country. The main hub is the modern bus terminal of the city of San Juan. There are another important transportation centers in San Jos√© de J√°chal and in the city of Caucete, which is currently under construction. By bus, it takes around 18 hours to get Buenos Aires. There are daily flight services to Buenos Aires from Domingo Faustino Sarmiento Airport. The public transportation system in the city of San Juan and surrounding areas includes buses that connect downtown with other cities such as Villa Krause, Rivadavia, Santa Lucia, Villa Paula Sarmiento Albarrac√≠n and Aberastain. Private taxis (called Remis) and public taxis also exist. Rapid population growth has led to a number of projects for the construction of mass transit systems. == See also == *1894 San Juan earthquake *1944 San Juan earthquake *1952 San Juan earthquake *1977 San Juan earthquake == References == == External links == *Official page (Spanish) *Tourist office (Spanish) *San Juan Tourist guide (English ‚Äì Spanish ‚Äì Deutsch) *Universidad Nacional de San Juan (Spanish) *Diario de Cuyo (Newspaper ‚Äì Spanish) *CuyoNoticias (digital newspaper ‚Äì Spanish-English) Category:Provinces of Argentina Category:Wine regions of Argentina Category:States and territories established in 1820 ","title":"San Juan Province, Argentina"},{"id":"522390","text":"The Owl Creek Mountains in Wyoming are shown highlighted on a map of the western United States The Owl Creek Mountains are a subrange of the Rocky Mountains in central Wyoming in the United States, running east to west to form a bridge between the Absaroka Range to the northwest and the Bridger Mountains to the east.

The International Triathlon Union governs the sport internationally. Duathlons are conducted at sprint, standard, middle and long distances. The following distances are considered the norm, however individual races may vary. *Sprint distance - 5km run, 20km bike, 2.5km run *Standard distance - 10km run, 40km bike, 5km run *Middle distance - 10km run, 60km bike, 10km run *Long distance - 10km run, 150km bike, 30km run ==Relationships to similar sports== Duathlons are most similar to triathlons, with the key difference being the replacement of the swimming leg with a second run. Other sports derived from triathlon include aquathlon, which combines swimming and running but has omitted the cycling part, and aquabike, with the swim and bike and no run. The word duathlon is also used for some events which comprise running or walking and cycling, but not in three stages, such as the annual Highland Cross in Scotland. The word duathlon does not appear in the online Oxford English Dictionary , nor in the 11th edition (2008) of Chambers Dictionary, but a definition available online from Collins English Dictionary defines it as \\"an athletic contest in which each athlete competes in running and cycling events\\" without specifying the three-stage structure of the International Triathlon Union's definition. ==Team duathlon== The run-bike transition zone at a duathlon In this variation, the cycling and running segments need to be undertaken simultaneously by a team consisting of a predetermined number of individuals. Only one of the team members is running while all others are cycling. All the members of a team must be together at any given point of time but exchanging the tasks of running and cycling amongst the team members themselves is permitted. The challenge is to rotate the task of running at an optimum rate such that the time from start to destination is minimized. This demands a smooth coordination amongst all team members which makes the sport more exciting. An example is the 100 km-Duathlon around Dresden which is the oldest of its kind in Germany.http://100 km- duathlon.de/index.php/infos-rund-um-den-100 km-duathlon/die-geburt-100 km- duathlon.html == Notable duathlons == Powerman Duathlon http://www.powerman.org/ is the major run bike run brand in the world.

With the popularity of extreme sports, a new form of duathlon has become popular in the last few years. Referred to as an off-road duathlon, or \\"Dirty-Du\\", it consists of an off-road or trail run, followed by a mountain bike leg followed by a final off-road or trail run. The Dirty Du off-road duathlon series, held in Texas, was made famous by Lance Armstrong, who won it in 2003. ==Notable DuathletesMen=== *Kenny Souza ‚Äì 1990 ITU world champion *Benny Vansteelant ‚Äì winner of the World Duathlon, World Long-Distance Duathlon, European Duathlon and numerous Powerman titles. *Joerie Vansteelant ‚Äì winner of the World Long-Distance Duathlon 2007 *Koen Maris ‚Äì 2007 Powerman Duathlon World Champion (10 km/150 km/30 km) *Rob Woestenborghs ‚Äì 2008 World Champion Duathlon Short Distance in Rimini *Bart Aernouts ‚Äì 2010 World Champion Duathlon Short Distance in Edinburgh *Emilio Martin ‚Äì 2012 World Champion Duathlon Short Distance in Nancy http://www.triathlon.org/news/article/emilio_martin_bolts_to_first_duathlon_world_championship_title/ *Gael Le Bellec ‚Äì 2014, 2015 and 2018 ITU LD World Champion https://www.triathlon.org/athletes/profile/86383/gael_le_bellec ===Women=== *Catriona Morrison ‚Äì 2006 and 2010 World Duathlon Champion, 2007 and 2008 World Long-Distance Duathlon Champion, 2007 and 2009 European Duathlon Champion *Andrea \\"RAT\\" Ratkovic - 2006 World Long-Distance Duathlon bronze medalist, multiple USA Pro National Duathlon Champion, Elite Duathlete of the Year, Rookie Duathlete of the Year, multiple Powerman wins *Emma Pooley - 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 ITU LD World Champion, 2017 European MD Champion ==References== ==External links== *London Duathlon *NI Duathlon (Northern Ireland) *Duathlon.ca *Duathlon.com Category:Multisports Category:Cycle racing by discipline ","title":"Duathlon"},{"id":"522399","text":"Yes You Can was a Canadian children's television series broadcast on CBC Television from 1980 to 1983. Hosted by singer Kevin Gillis, and co-hosted by Trevor Bruneau and Tammy Bourne, the half-hour live-action series was sports- themed and encouraged fitness and good health. Also featured were the comedic Coach Cuddles Ford (played by Patrick Ford), and two animated characters, \\"Harry Hog\\" and \\"Body Man\\", voiced by Michael Magee. Each show also featured an appearance from a professional athlete, such as Gordie Howe, Karen Kain and Toller Cranston. The show was written by Jack Hutchinson and Jamie Wayne, produced by Bill Hunt, directed by Ron Piggott and executive produced by Michael Lansbury. Reruns of Yes You Can aired in the launch schedules of TSN and YTV. Kevin Gillis went on to create and produce The Christmas Raccoons animated special - which led to The Raccoons on Ice, The Raccoons and the Lost Star, The Raccoons: Let's Dance! and the Raccoons animated series. Many of the songs Gillis used the Yes You Can series were later re-recorded and used in the Raccoons animated series. ==External links== * * Queen's University Directory of CBC Television Series (Yes You Can archived listing link via archive.org) Category:1980 Canadian television series debuts Category:1983 Canadian television series endings Category:Television series produced in Toronto Category:1980s Canadian children's television series Category:CBC Television original programming ","title":"Yes You Can"},{"id":"522401","text":"Henry King may refer to: ==People== In order of birth * Henry King (poet) (1592‚Äì1669), English poet, Bishop of Chichester * Sir Henry King, 3rd Baronet (1681‚Äì1740), Anglo-Irish politician * Henry King (fl. 1699), English pirate captain * Henry King (politician) (1733‚Äì1821), Anglo-Irish politician * Henry King (British Army officer) (1776‚Äì1839), Member of Parliament for County Sligo * Henry King (congressman) (1790‚Äì1861), U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania * Henry W.

It has a sweetness that is equivalent to sucrose (table sugar). The commercial production of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) often begins with sorbose. L-Sorbose is the configuration of the naturally occurring sugar. ==References== Category:Ketohexoses ","title":"Sorbose"},{"id":"522407","text":"Glucosamine In organic chemistry, an amino sugar (or more technically a 2-amino-2-deoxysugar) is a sugar molecule in which a hydroxyl group has been replaced with an amine group. More than 60 amino sugars are known, with one of the most abundant being N-Acetyl--glucosamine, which is the main component of chitin. Derivatives of amine containing sugars, such as N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid, whose nitrogens are part of more complex functional groups rather than formally being amines, are also considered amino sugars. Aminoglycosides are a class of antimicrobial compounds that inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. These compounds are conjugates of amino sugars and aminocyclitols. ==SynthesisFrom glycals=== Glycals are cyclic enol ether derivatives of monosaccharides, having a double bond between carbon atoms 1 and 2 of the ring. N-functionalized of glycals at the C2 position, combined with glycosidic bond formation at C1 is a common strategy for the synthesis of amino sugars. This can be achieved using azides with subsequent reduction yielding the amino sugar. One advantage of introducing azide moiety at C-2 lies in its non-participatory ability, which could serve as the basis of stereoseletive synthesis of 1.2-cis-glycosidic linkage. 600px Azides give high regioselectivity, however stereoselectivity both at C-1 and C-2 is generally poor. Usually anomeric mixtures will be obtained and the stereochemistry formed at C-2 is heavily dependent upon the starting substrates. For galactal, addition of azide to the double bond will preferentially occur from equatorial direction because of steric hindrance at the top face caused by axial group at C-4. For glucal, azide could attack from both axial and equatorial directions with almost similar probability, so its selectivity will decrease. 600px Glycals may also be converted into amino sugars by nitration followed by treatment with thiophenol (Michael addition) to furnish a thioglycoside donor. This is a versatile donor and can react with simple or carbohydrate alcohols to establish the glycosidic linkage, with reduction and N-acetylation of nitro group will give the targeted product. 600px One-pot reactions have also been reported. For instance glycal, activated by thianthrene-5-oxide and Tf2O is treated with an amide nucleophile and a glycosyl acceptor to produce various 1,2-trans C-2-amidoglycosides. Both the C-2 nitrogen introduction and the glycosidic bond formation precede stereoselectively. This methodology makes the introduction of both natural and non-natural amide functionalities at C-2 possible and more importantly with glycosidic bond formation at the same time in a one-pot procedure. === Via nucleophilic displacement=== Nucleophilic displacement can be an effective strategy for the synthesis of amino sugars, however success strongly depends upon the nature of nucleophile, the type of leaving group and site of displacements on sugar rings. One aspect of this problem is that displacements at the C2 position tend to be slow as it is adjacent to the anomeric centre; this is particularly true for glycosides with axially-oriented aglycones. 600px Epoxides are suitable starting materials for realizing nucleophilic displacement reaction to introduce azide into C-2. Anhydrosugar 21 could be transformed into thioglycoside 22, which serves as a donor to react with alcohols to obtain 2-azide-2-deoxy-O-glycosides. The subsequent reduction and N-acetylation will furnish the desired 2-N-acetamido-2-deoxyglycosides. 600px == See also == * Iminosugar *N-Acetylglucosamine *Galactosamine *Glucosamine *Sialic acid *L-Daunosamine ==References== ==External links== * ","title":"Amino sugar"},{"id":"522410","text":"XPM was a short-lived Canadian television sitcom broadcast in 2004 on CBC Television.\\"CBC televises 'warm, family comedy': Show about ex-prime minister airs tonight\\".

More recent breeding has focused on the Collie as a show dog, and also companion. The breed specifications call for a distinctive long narrow tapered snout and tipped (semiprick) ears, so some dogs must have their ears taped when young. Rough Collies generally come in shades of sable and white (sometimes mahogany), blue merle, tri-colored, and white. Originating in the 1800s, the breed is now well known through the stories of author Albert Payson Terhune about his dog Lad, and later with Eric Knight's character of Lassie and her novels, movies, and television shows. There is a smooth-coated variety known as a Smooth Collie; some breed organisations, including both the American and Canadian Kennel Clubs, consider smooth-coat and rough-coat collies to be variations of the same breed. Rough Collies closely resemble smaller Shetland Sheepdogs or \\"Shelties\\", but the two breeds do not have an exclusive linear relationship. ==History== left Both Rough and Smooth collies are descended from a localised variety of herding dog originating in Scotland and Wales. The Scottish variety was a large, strong, aggressive dog, bred to herd highland sheep. The Welsh variety was small and nimble, domesticated and friendly, and also herded goats. When the English saw these dogs at the Birmingham market, they interbred them with their own variety of sheepdogs, producing a mixture of short- and long-haired varieties. After the industrial revolution, dog ownership became fashionable, and these early collies were believed to have been crossed with the Borzoi (Russian Wolfhound) to get a more \\"noble\\" head (longer muzzle), which is today one of the true characteristics of the Rough Collie. It is not known conclusively if the Borzoi cross made it into the mainstream of the breed. When Queen Victoria acquired a Rough Collie, after seeing one at Balmoral Castle, they were transformed into something of a fashion item. Continued breeding for show purposes drastically changed the appearance of the dogs; in the 1960s, it was a much taller dog than it is today (in the UK; in the US, the size standard has not been revised downward and dogs have remained between 24-26\\"). Earlier dogs were also more sturdy in build and reportedly capable of covering up to 100 miles in one day. In the UK the Rough Collie is no longer used for serious herding, having been replaced by the Border Collie, though in the United States and a number of European countries, there has been a resurgence in the use of the Collie as a working and performance dog. The Collie Club of America is one of the oldest breed-specific clubs in existence in the United States (founded in 1886). The Collie Club in England dates from 1881. Quoted from Collie Club of America: > Unfortunately, the Collie's exact origins are shrouded in obscurity. It has > been the subject of much research and speculation. The word \\"Collie\\" is as > obscure as the breed itself. The name has been spelled many different ways: > Coll, Colley, Coally and Coaly.

All have white coat areas, in the collar, parts of the leg, and usually the tail tip. Some may have white blazes on their faces. Note that the American Kennel Club accepts white, where the dog is predominantly white with coloured markings of sable, tricolor, or blue merle on the head and sometimes body patches. The downy undercoat is covered by a long, dense, coarse outer coat with a notable ruff around the neck, feathers about the legs, a petticoat on the abdomen, and a frill on the hindquarters.leftOne of the characteristic features of the Rough Collie is its head. This is light in relation to the rest of the body, and resembles a blunted wedge tapering smoothly from ears to black nose, with a distinct stop and parallel head planes. The muzzle is well rounded, and never square. There is considerable variation in the color of the head, however. The eyes are medium-sized and almond shaped. The ears are supposed to be semi-prick, or tipped, with the upper third folded over. Ears which do not \\"tip\\" properly, however, are common, and many collies have their ears taped as puppies (using medical adhesive or paper tape) to encourage them to lay properly ‚Äì no cutting or surgery is involved. Rough Collies have a more blunt, gradually tapering, face than the smaller, but otherwise very similar Shetland Sheepdog, which is partly descended from the Rough Collie. The planes of the muzzle and the top of the skull should be parallel in collies, with a slight but distinct stop. (In shelties, the planes are not parallel.) The ears of a Rough Collie are similar to a Shetland Sheepdog's, but larger. Furthermore, once seen, the contrast between the Rough Collie head and that of a Border Collie is immediately apparent, the latter having a considerably shorter muzzle and a more distinct stop between muzzle and forehead. The ruff is also distinctive in distinguishing the two breeds. The size and weight varies among breed standards; male collies can stand 55.8 to 66 cm (22 to 26 in) at the shoulder; the female averages 5 cm (2 in) shorter. The males are usually in the weight range (50‚Äì70 lbs), and the females are usually 5 to 10 lbs less. Collies in the US are sometimes reported to be over one hundred pounds, but a large collie typically weighs no more than 70 pounds. US and UK standards may differ. The UK standard calls for dogs to be significantly smaller than those under the American Kennel Club. ==Temperament== Blue merle Rough collies should show no nervousness or aggression, and are generally great with children and other animals. However, they must be well socialised to prevent shyness. They are medium to large sized dogs, and they generally need a house instead of being in a small apartment. Like many herding dogs, collies can be fairly vocal, and some are easily trained not to bark. The amount of herding instinct varies, with some dogs being quite drivey and others calmer. Rough Collies are very loyal and may be one-family dogs (although most make exceptions for children), but are very rarely aggressive or protective beyond barking and providing a visual deterrent. They are typically excellent with kids. They are eager to learn and respond best to a gentle hand. The rough collie's long coat has made the breed successful on northern Midwest farms as an able herder and guardian of the farm during the winter. The dog needs to be gradually acclimated to the cold and a suitable insulated outdoor shelter must be provided for the dog along with ample quality food and a source of unfrozen water. The rough collie also relishes playing in the snow with children during the winter months. They guard the farm while the owner is away and are naturally protective of small children. ==Health== left While Rough Collies are generally resilient and healthy, there are some health problems that can affect the breed. Collie eye anomaly (CEA), a genetic disease which causes improper development of the eye and possible blindness, is a common ailment in the breed. More rarely, Rough Collies can be affected by progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), another genetic disease in which bilateral degeneration of the retina results in progressive vision loss culminating in blindness. Through genetic testing and careful screening program it would be theoretically possible to eradicate both of these problems in purebred lines, however, certainly in the UK, the Kennel Club does not require these tests to be done either for registration or showing. CEA is so prevalent that elimination of affected dogs except through very slow and careful breeding decisions to avoid shrinking the gene pool more than absolutely necessary. Rough Collie puppies should be screened at an early age (6‚Äì8 weeks) by a certified veterinary ophthalmologist to check for CEA. PRA has a later onset and can be detected by DNA test, but is much less widespread (in the US) than CEA. (In the UK, PRA is more common.) Note, the UK Kennel Club \\"Accredited Breeder Scheme\\" requires eye tests and recommends the genetic test for this class of members. Canine cyclic neutropenia is a cyclic blood disorder that is usually fatal to affected puppies. The disease is also referred to as \\"gray collie syndrome\\", due to affected puppies having a pale gray, pinkish/gray or beige colouring, none of which are normal Rough Collie colours. Puppies that survive through adulthood are plagued with immune disorders throughout their lives and rarely live more than three years. DNA testing can help detect carriers of the recessive gene that causes the disease. Hip dysplasia: As with most of the larger breeds, hip dysplasia is a potential concern for Rough Collies. Although this disease appears to be \\"multigene\\", careful selection by many breeders is reducing this problem. The UK Kennel Club \\"Accredited Breeder Scheme\\" requires hip-scores this class of members, however, a very small proportion of UK registered puppies are bred under this scheme. Hip dysplasia is rare in collies compared to their closest relatives and other breeds of the same size.Mahogany sable Rough CollieRough Collies may carry a mutant Mdr1 gene that results in a sensitivity to Ivermectin and related drugs. A screening test is used to determine if alternative medications are required. Overdoses from the proscribed medications can result in neurological impairment or even death. This faulty gene is present in several breeds, but is well known among collies. In addition to these problems, all of which can be tested for, there are a number of problems which are thought to be genetic but for which no screening test exists. These include epilepsy, bloat, a tendency towards allergies, and thyroid disorders (primarily hypothyroidism.). Because no DNA tests exist for these disorders (and all can have causes other than genetic origins), breeders can only do their best to avoid producing them by removing affected dogs from the gene pool. ===Grooming=== The double- layered coat needs to be brushed frequently and thoroughly to keep it in a show condition. Pet dogs need less maintenance but still a significant amount to keep the dog healthy. The profuse coat picks up grass seeds and burrs, and many dogs tend to mat to some degree, particularly behind the ears, around the collar (if a collar is left on the dog), and in the pants. Spaying and neutering can alter coat texture, making it softer and more prone to matting. ==Working lifeHerding=== In the 18th century, the Collie's natural home was in the highlands of Scotland In the 18th century, the Collie's natural home was in the highlands of Scotland, where it had been used for centuries as a sheepdog. The dogs were bred with great care in order to assist their masters in the herding and guarding of their flock. Collies are capable of being keen herders while remaining sensible, flexible family companions, whether as working dogs on a ranch or farm or helping out a suburban owner who keeps a few sheep, goats, or ducks as a hobby. Participation in herding helps preserve the special heritage of the Collie and opens up new opportunities for owner and dog. The qualities that make a good herding dog ‚Äì trainability, adaptability, loyalty, soundness of body and character, agility, grace ‚Äì are important in many areas, and contribute so much toward making the dog an outstanding companion as well. Throughout the country there are local herding clubs that provide clinics, work days, trials and tests. Several organizations provide herding title programs in which Collies regularly participate. A Herding Instinct Test introduces Collies and their handlers to herding at the basic level. It is designed to show whether or not a Collie, who may have never had any exposure to livestock, still has the natural instinct to perform the function for which the breed was initially created. It is a non- competitive introduction to carefully selected and easily handled livestock under favorably controlled conditions. ===Activities=== Rough Collies can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, conformation, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Rough Collies exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials. The breed has also been known to work as search and rescue dogs, therapy dogs and guide dogs for the blind. ==Notable Rough Collies== Lassie TV series (1954‚Äì1973), filming on location in Florida (1965) * Lassie, a line of Rough Collies originally owned by Rudd Weatherwax that have starred in numerous films, multiple television series, a radio program, and has been the subject of various novels and non-fiction works.

The landscape of the province consist of a series of arid to semi-arid mountain ranges and agricultural valleys in between. It is in one of these valleys that the capital of the province, the city of la La Rioja, lies. Neighboring provinces are from the north clockwise Catamarca, C√≥rdoba, San Luis and San Juan. The dinosaur Riojasaurus is named after the province. ==History== Facundo Quiroga, La Rioja's popular fighter for autonomy. Petroglyphs created by early indigenous peoples at the Talampaya National Park are dated around 10,000 years BC. Succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples developed here. The Diaguita, Capayan and the Olongasta peoples inhabited the territory of present-day La Rioja Province at the time of encounter with the Spanish colonists in the 16th century. Juan Ram√≠rez de Velazco founded Todos Los Santos de la Nueva Rioja in 1591 under the government of Tucum√°n of the Viceroyalty of Peru. In 1630 the Calchaqu√≠ people revolted against the Spanish, but the governor Albornoz suppressed them. In 1783, after the creation of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata, the control of the province of 10,000 inhabitants passed to the C√≥rdoba independency. The province acquired independence from C√≥rdoba in 1820. Following attempts by Bernardino Rivadavia, the first elected President of Argentina, to impose a centralist constitution, the caudillo Juan Facundo Quiroga emerged as a popular leader. He represented their preference for more autonomy, for which they continued to press following Quiroga's 1835 assassination. After a period of internal instability in Argentina, the province finally joined the Argentine Confederation in 1853. La Rioja Bishop Enrique Angelelli, whose advocacy for the poor and for peace cost him the support of his church and his life. La Rioja attracted fewer immigrants from Europe than did other Argentine provinces from 1890 to the 1930s. Some Syrian and Lebanese immigrants did settle in the province, among whom the most well-known is probably the Menem family. Coming from what had been the Ottoman Empire, Saul Menem and his wife were of Armenian and Alawi ancestry. He prospered as a traveling salesman and sent his eldest son, Carlos Menem, to Spain for college. After the younger Menem was elected governor of La Rioja Province in March 1973, he implemented a number of reforms advocated by activists for the poor, rural majority, particularly those recommended by Bishop Enrique Angelelli. Removed and imprisoned following the military ouster of President Isabel Per√≥n in March 1976, Menem was kept in illegal confinement until the end of 1980. He was reportedly tortured during this time. The dictatorship repressed people in the province and was responsible for the brutal murder in August 1976 of Bishop Angelelli. After democracy was restored in 1983, Menem was overwhelmingly re- elected to office. He pursued conservative policies, leveraging La Rioja's dry, agreeable climate, its modest wage scale, and skilled work-force, to attract La Rioja's first significant light industries, particularly bottling and food-processing. Having presided over a growing La Rioja economy even as the nation's languished during the 1980s, Menem secured the Peronist Justicialist Party nomination for president in May 1988; in an upset, he defeated the popular Governor Antonio Cafiero of Buenos Aires Province. Elected president of Argentina in 1988, Menem served until 1999. During those years, he steered billions in federal public works spending into La Rioja. Although the province remains less developed than the average in the nation, its economy today compares favorably with those of its neighbors. ==Geography and climate== Talampaya Natural Park hosts upright Located in the Argentine Northwest area, its landscape is arid to semi-arid, and the dry climate receives annually 200 mm of precipitations, has short winters and very hot summers. From the Andes at the west, with peaks of up to 6,795 meters (Monte Pissis), the relief's height descents towards the sierras of the neighbouring dry Pampas zone. Most ranges in La Rioja are oriented in a north-south fashion. The province's two largest cities, La Rioja and Chilecito are separated by Sierra de Velasco and west of Chilecito and Famatina rises the Sierra de Famatina with heights of up to 6.250 m.a.sl. (‚âà20500 feet). The Talampaya National Park is a dry red-soil canyon of the ancient extinguished Talampaya river, which contains many walls and rock formations that make it an interesting tourist destination. ==Economy== La Rioja's economy, estimated at US$1.822 billion in 2006, is the second-smallest among Argentina's provinces. Its per capita output of US$6,283, though about 30% below the national average, makes it the most well-developed in northern Argentina. Its economy is, likewise, very well-diversified. Agriculture (long limited by La Rioja's dry, mountainous terrain) adds less than 5% to its output. La Rioja's agriculture (as well as cities) lies on the banks of the few permanent rivers and oases that allow irrigation, with only 190 square kilometres of cultivated land. Vineyards, nuts and olive plantations are the most common, followed by cotton. Vineyard in Chilecito. The province's main crop is the grape, and its associated wine production, especially around the Chilecito area, with a production of 8 million litres per year. Cattle (250,000 heads) and goats (150,000 heads) are secondary activities, particularly for skin and leather. Clay represents the main mining activity, and uranium is also extracted near El Colorado. Manufacturing in La Rioja has expanded considerably since Gov. Menem began attracting investment into the province, after 1983. Limited mostly to light industry like bottling and food processing, it, nevertheless, adds about 20% to La Rioja's output. Tourism is, likewise, an expanding activity. Besides the Talampaya National Park, tourists visiting La Rioja usually go also to the Chilecito town, Cerro de La Cruz, Termas de Santa Teresita hot springs and the village of Villa Sanagasta. La Rioja's development plan is being designed by Proyectos Innovadores to encourage further economic growth in the province. Recently, the province experienced a wave of immigration from Eastern Europe, East or South Asian and Middle Eastern countries. == Government == The provincial government is divided into the usual three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoint the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court. The Constitution of La Rioja Province, Argentina forms the formal law of the province. In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the La Rioja Provincial Police. ==Political division== Hangliding in the Famatina valley, La Rioja.

It is intended primarily for creating icon pixmaps, and supports transparent pixels. Derived from the earlier XBM syntax, it is a plain text file in the XPM2 format or of a C programming language syntax, which can be included in a C program file. == XPM == The XPM format is an array of strings composed of six different sections as follows: static char* [] = ; This is a black-and-white image in the first (1989) XPM format. #define XFACE_format 1 #define XFACE_width 48 #define XFACE_height 48 #define XFACE_ncolors 2 #define XFACE_chars_per_pixel 1 static char *XFACE_colors[] = { \\"a\\", \\"#ffffff\\", \\"b\\", \\"#000000\\" }; static char *XFACE_pixels[] = { \\"abaabaababaaabaabababaabaabaababaabaaababaabaaab\\", // and so on for 48 rows with 48 pixels The values section contains the width, height, number of colors, and number of characters per pixel. == XPM2 == XPM2 simplifies the format by removing all C code. An example: ! XPM2 48 4 2 1 a c #FFFFFF b c #000000 abaabaababaaabaabababaabaabaababaabaaababaabaaab abaabaababaaabaabababaabaabaababaabaaababaabaaab abaabaababaaabaabababaabaabaababaabaaababaabaaab abaabaababaaabaabababaabaabaababaabaaababaabaaab This is an XPM2 file with width 48, height 4, 2 colors, and 1 character per pixel. One tool is known to use only a to p for 16 colors, switching to aa up to dp for 64 colors, but still reading single character encodings for 64 colors; compare Base64. With more colors the codes use more characters, e.g. aa up to pp for 16 √ó 16 = 256 colors. This is less useful for text editors, because a string ab could be actually the middle of two adjacent pixels dabc. Spaces are allowed as color code, but might be a bad idea depending on the used text editor. Without control codes, backslash, and quote (needed in XPM1 and XPM3) 128 ‚àí 33 ‚àí 2 = 93 ASCII characters are available for single character color codes. Simplified example: 90 US-ASCII characters could be arranged into nine non-overlapping sets of 10 characters. Thus unambiguous strings of nine characters could set the color of each pixel by its XPM palette index with up to 109 = colors (compare to GIF, which supports only 256). For XPM2 it is clear how many lines belong to the image ‚Äì two header lines, the second header line announcing the number of color codes (2 lines in the example above) and rows (height 4 in the example above), e.g. 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 lines. == XPM3 == The other styles XPM1 and XPM3 are designed to be used as is in C source code, example: /* XPM */ static char * XFACE[] = { /* */ /* */ \\"48 4 2 1\\", /* */ \\"a c #ffffff\\", \\"b c #000000\\", /* */ \\"abaabaababaaabaabababaabaabaababaabaaababaabaaab\\", \\"abaabaababaaabaabababaabaabaababaabaaababaabaaab\\", \\"abaabaababaaabaabababaabaabaababaabaaababaabaaab\\", \\"abaabaababaaabaabababaabaabaababaabaaababaabaaab\\" }; The latter format is XPM3, the common format used for the X Window System since about 1991. The c means \\"color\\", it's possible to add m for \\"monochrome\\" output, g for \\"grayscale\\", and s for \\"symbolic\\", explaining what a defined color is supposed to do. In addition to the X11 color names the name \`none\` indicates transparency. The \\"symbolic\\" feature permits adjusting colors depending on the context where they are used. Code such as \`s border c blue\` could be adjusted on a blue background. If the width, height, colors, and characters per pixel line contains six instead of four numbers, the additional values indicate the coordinates of a \\"hotspot\\", 0 0 is the upper left corner of a box containing the icon and the default. A \\"hotspot\\" is used for mouse pointers and similar applications. == Comparison with other formats == Blarg file opened in program window The following code displays the same blarg file in the XBM, XPM and PBM formats.

The name derives from its similarity to the oxygen heterocycle furan, but the furanose ring does not have double bonds. ==Structural properties== The chemical structure of ribose in its furanose form. The wavy bond indicates a mixture of Œ≤-ribofuranose and Œ±-ribofuranose. The furanose ring is a cyclic hemiacetal of an aldopentose or a cyclic hemiketal of a ketohexose. A furanose ring structure consists of four carbon and one oxygen atom with the anomeric carbon to the right of the oxygen. The highest numbered chiral carbon (typically to the left of the oxygen in a Haworth projection) determines whether or not the structure has a -configuration or L-configuration. In an -configuration furanose, the substituent on the highest numbered chiral carbon is pointed downwards out of the plane, and in a D-configuration furanose, the highest numbered chiral carbon is facing upwards. The furanose ring will have either alpha or beta configuration, depending on which direction the anomeric hydroxy group is pointing. In a -configuration furanose, alpha configuration has the hydroxy pointing down, and beta has the hydroxy pointing up. It is the opposite in an -configuration furanose. Typically, the anomeric carbon undergoes mutarotation in solution, and the result is an equilibrium mixture of Œ± and Œ≤ configurations. ==See also== *Pyranose ==References== Category:Carbohydrate chemistry Category:Carbohydrates Category:Tetrahydrofurans Category:Hexoses ","title":"Furanose"},{"id":"522440","text":"The Bridger Mountains may refer to either of two mountain ranges in the United States: * Bridger Range (Montana) * Bridger Mountains (Wyoming) ==See also== * Bridger Mountain, West Virginia ","title":"Bridger Mountains"},{"id":"522442","text":"Mutarotation is the change in the optical rotation because of the change in the equilibrium between two anomers, when the corresponding stereocenters interconvert. Cyclic sugars show mutarotation as Œ± and Œ≤ anomeric forms interconvert.IUPAC Gold Book mutarotation The optical rotation of the solution depends on the optical rotation of each anomer and their ratio in the solution. Mutarotation was discovered by French chemist Dubrunfaut in 1844, when he noticed that the specific rotation of aqueous sugar solution changes with time. == Measurement == The Œ± and Œ≤ anomers are diastereomers of each other and usually have different specific rotations. A solution or liquid sample of a pure Œ± anomer will rotate plane polarised light by a different amount and/or in the opposite direction than the pure Œ≤ anomer of that compound. The optical rotation of the solution depends on the optical rotation of each anomer and their ratio in the solution. For example, if a solution of Œ≤-D-glucopyranose is dissolved in water, its specific optical rotation will be +18.7¬∞. Over time, some of the Œ≤-D-glucopyranose will undergo mutarotation to become Œ±-D-glucopyranose, which has an optical rotation of +112.2¬∞. The rotation of the solution will increase from +18.7¬∞ to an equilibrium value of +52.7¬∞ as some of the Œ≤ form is converted to the Œ± form. The equilibrium mixture is about 64% of Œ≤-D-glucopyranose and about 36% of Œ±-D-glucopyranose, though there are also traces of the other forms including furanoses and open chained form. :left The observed rotation of the sample is the weighted sum of the optical rotation of each anomer weighted by the amount of that anomer present. Therefore, one can use a polarimeter to measure the rotation of a sample and then calculate the ratio of the two anomers present from the enantiomeric excess, as long as one knows the rotation of each pure anomer. One can monitor the mutarotation process over time or determine the equilibrium mixture by observing the optical rotation and how it changes. ==Reaction mechanism== :Reaction mechanism for the interconversion of Œ± and Œ≤ anomers ==See also== *Anomer *Carbohydrate *Monosaccharide *Polysaccharide *Stereochemistry ==References== ==External links== * Category:Carbohydrate chemistry Category:Carbohydrates Category:Organic chemistry Category:Stereochemistry ","title":"Mutarotation"},{"id":"522457","text":"The river Eridanos or Eridanus (; , \\"Amber\\") is a river in northern Europe mentioned in Greek mythology and historiography. ==Ancient references== Hesiod, in the Theogony, calls it \\"deep-eddying Eridanos\\" in his list of rivers, the offspring of Tethys and Oceanus.Theogony XI, 334‚Äì345. Herodotus suspects the word Eridanos to be essentially Greek in character, and notably forged by some unknown poet, and expresses his disbelief in the whole concept‚Äîpassed on to him by others, themselves not eye witnesses‚Äîof such a river flowing into a northern sea, surrounding Europe, where the mythical Amber and Tin Isles were supposed; he upholds the belief in the abundance of natural goods at the world's ends though, to be found in the north of Europa as well as in India (east: big animals, gold, cotton) and Arabia (south: incense, myrrh, etc.).Histories III, 115; cfr. ibd. 106 f. The Eridanos was later associated with the river Po, because the Po was located near the end of the Amber Trail. According to Apollonius of RhodesArgonautica IV, 597ff. and Ovid,Metamorphoses II, 367‚Äì380. amber originated from the tears of the Heliades, encased in poplars as dryads, shed when their brother, Phaethon, died and fell from the sky, struck by Zeus' thunderbolt, and tumbled into the Eridanos, where \\"to this very day the marsh exhales a heavy vapour which rises from his smouldering wound; no bird can stretch out its fragile wings to fly over that water, but in mid-flight it falls dead in the flames\\";Argonautica IV, 599‚Äì603. \\"along the green banks of the river Eridanos,\\" Cygnus mourned him‚ÄîOvid told‚Äîand was transformed into a swan. There in the far west, Heracles asked the river nymphs of Eridanos to help him locate the Garden of the Hesperides. Strabo commented disregardingly on such mythmaking: : [‚Ä¶] one must put aside many of the mythical or false accounts such as those of Phaethon and of the Heliades changed into black poplars near the Eridanos (a river that does not exist anywhere on earth, although it is said to be near the Po), and of the Islands of Amber that lie off the Po, and of the guinea-fowl on them, because none of these exist in this area. : ()Strabo, Geography V, 1, 9.''

The Eridanos is mentioned in Greek writings as a river in northern Europe rich in amber ( Vistula on Amber Road? ).\\"The holy isle of Elektris\\", named for elektron (\\"amber\\") off the mouth of the Eridanos, was reached by the Argonauts, who were fleeing from the Colchians, in Apollonius of Rhodes' Argonautica, Book IV; their return trip from Colchis, in which they passed \\"the farthest reaches of the stream Eridanos\\" (IV, 597), can probably not be made to coincide with actual geography. A small river near Athens was named Eridanos in ancient times, and has been rediscovered with the excavations for construction of the Athens Metro. ==Cenozoic river== Eridanos is the name that has been applied by geologists to a river which flowed where the Baltic Sea is now,Overeem, I., Weltje, G.J., Bishop-Kay, C. & Kroonenberg, S.B., 2002. \\"The Late Cenozoic Eridanos delta system in the southern North Sea Basin: a climate signal in sediment supply?\\" Basin Research 13: 293‚Äì312. a river system also known simply as the \\"Baltic River System\\".Bijlsma, S., 1981.

He is a member of the Democratic Party. ==Early life== Born in La Crosse, Wisconsin, O'Callaghan later moved to Sparta, where his family subsistence farmed. He lied about his age to join the U.S. Marine Corps, at the age of 16 and served from 1946 to 1948. He attended Boise Junior College and joined the U.S. Air Force in 1950 and served as an intelligence operator in the Aleutian Islands. O'Callaghan was transferred to the U.S. Army in 1952 to see combat and lost part of his left leg after being hit by a mortar round during a battle in the Korean War. He was awarded the Silver Star and Bronze Star and returned to the United States. O'Callaghan resumed his college studies at the University of Idaho in Moscow and completed his bachelor's and master's degree in education in 1956, then became a high school teacher and boxing coach in Nevada. He was U.S. Senator Harry Reid's history teacher at Basic High School in Henderson and later promoted Reid's political career. From 1961 to 1963, he was the chief probation officer and director of court services for Clark County. ==Political career== O'Callaghan's political career began in 1963, when Governor Grant Sawyer appointed him to head the state's new department of health and welfare. In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed O'Callaghan to be the regional director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness. In 1966, O'Callaghan ran in the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor, but lost. In 1970, he received the Democratic gubernatorial nomination and won a surprising victory in the general election over his Republican opponent, Edward Fike. He proved to be an extremely popular governor and was re-elected in 1974 by a four-to-one margin, the greatest landslide in a gubernatorial election in state history. The last Nevada governor before term limits, who was eligible for an elected third term, O'Callaghan chose not to run again in 1978. After he left office O'Callaghan became the executive editor of the Las Vegas Sun, a job he held until his death in 2004. He was also the publisher of the Henderson Home News and Boulder City News. In the 1990s, O'Callaghan monitored elections in Nicaragua and northern Iraq, and was a strong supporter of the country of Israel. ==Death== Mike O'Callaghan died on September 5, 2004, of a heart attack at the age of 74, five days before his 75th birthday, after collapsing during the morning mass hours at the Saint Viator Catholic Church in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was pronounced dead at the Desert Springs Hospital in Paradise, Nevada. His widow Carolyn, a native of Twin Falls, Idaho, died one month later on October 7, 2004, of complications from cardiac surgery, at the age of 68. They were married on October 25, 1954 in Twin Falls, Idaho and had five children; the former governor died one month before their 50th anniversary. Both are interred at the Southern Nevada Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Boulder City, Nevada. ==Legacy== O'Callaghan's legacy as Nevada politician and philanthropist survives through three structures that bear his name. Mike O'Callaghan Middle School opened on the east side of Las Vegas in 1991. The Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital is located on Nellis Air Force Base northeast of Las Vegas. A bridge that is a part of the highway bypass around the Hoover Dam, spanning the Colorado River between Nevada and Arizona, bears O'Callaghan's name, as well as that of former NFL Arizona Cardinals player and U.S. Army veteran Pat Tillman. Tillman died in combat while serving in the U.S. Army in Afghanistan. The Mike O'Callaghan‚ÄìPat Tillman Memorial Bridge was completed on October 14, 2010. Also in 2010, The O‚ÄôCallaghan Resource Integrated Oncology Network (ORION) Cancer Foundation, a nonprofit charity that assists cancer patients in Nevada was established in honor of Mike and Carolyn O‚ÄôCallaghan, both cancer survivors. ==References== Citations * ==External links== * Nevada State Library & Archives ‚Äì Mike O'Callaghan biography * National Governor's Association: profile ‚Äì Mike O'Callaghan * University of Idaho Alumni Hall of Fame ‚Äì 1971 inductees * * Las Vegas SUN obituary * Las Vegas SUN remembrance * Las Vegas CityLife remembrance * Mike O'Callaghan Middle School web site Category:1929 births Category:2004 deaths Category:20th-century American politicians Category:American amputees Category:American army personnel of the Korean War Category:American politicians with physical disabilities Category:Burials at Southern Nevada Veterans Memorial Cemetery (Boulder City) Category:Catholics from Nevada Category:Catholics from Wisconsin Category:Democratic Party state governors of the United States Category:Governors of Nevada Category:Military personnel from Nevada Category:Military personnel from Wisconsin Category:Nevada Democrats Category:Politicians from Carson City, Nevada Category:Politicians from La Crosse, Wisconsin Category:Politicians from Las Vegas Category:Recipients of the Silver Star Category:United States Air Force airmen Category:United States Marines Category:University of Idaho alumni ","title":"Mike O'Callaghan"},{"id":"522466","text":"Logo of Gara Music festival in support of Gara, Donostia (San Sebasti√°n), 2019 Gara (Basque: We Are) is a bilingual (Basque/Spanish) newspaper published in the city of Donostia-San Sebasti√°n in the Basque Autonomous Community.

Synthetic lubricants can be manufactured using chemically modified petroleum components rather than whole crude oil, but can also be synthesized from other raw materials. The base material, however, is still overwhelmingly crude oil that is distilled and then modified physically and chemically. The actual synthesis process and composition of additives is generally a commercial trade secret and will vary among producers. Synthetic oil is used as a substitute for petroleum-refined oils when operating in extreme temperature. Aircraft jet engines, for example, require the use of synthetic oils, whereas aircraft piston engines do not. Synthetic oils are also used in metal stamping to provide environmental and other benefits when compared to conventional petroleum and animal-fat based products. These products are also referred to as \\"non-oil\\" or \\"oil free\\". ==TypesFull=== Some \\"synthetic\\" oil is made from Group III base stock, some from Group IV. Some from a blend of the two. Mobil sued Castrol and Castrol prevailed in showing that their Group III base stock oil was changed enough that it qualified as full synthetic. Since then API has removed all references to Synthetic in their documentation regarding standards. \\"Full synthetic\\" is a marketing term and is not a measurable quality. Group IV: PAO Poly-alpha-olefin (poly-Œ±-olefin, PAO) is a non-polar polymer made by polymerizing an alpha-olefin. They are designated at API Group IV and are a 100% synthetic chemical compound. It is a specific type of olefin (organic) that is used as a base stock in the production of some synthetic lubricants. An alpha-olefin (or Œ±-olefin) is an alkene where the carbon-carbon double bond starts at the Œ±-carbon atom, i.e. the double bond is between the #1 and #2 carbons in the molecule.SynLube Incorporated. All About Synthetic Oil Group V: Other Synthetics Group V base oils are defined by API as any other type of oil other than mineral oils or PAO lubricants. Esters are the most famous synthetics in Group V, which are 100% synthetic chemical compounds consisting of a carbonyl adjacent to an ether linkage. They are derived by reacting an oxoacid with a hydroxyl compound such as an alcohol or phenol. Esters are usually derived from an inorganic acid or organic acid in which at least one -OH (hydroxyl) group is replaced by an -O-alkyl (alkoxy) group, most commonly from carboxylic acids and alcohols. That is to say, esters are formed by condensing an acid with an alcohol. Many chemically different \\"esters\\" due to their polarity and usually excellent lubricity are used for various reasons as either \\"additives\\" or \\"base stocks\\" for lubricants. Polyalkylene Glycol (PAG) Synthetic Oil Industrial PAG The terms polyalkylene glycol and polyglycol are used interchangeably.Polyalkylene Glycol Synthetic PAG Oil Explained  Daryl Beatty, Dow Chemical Company and Martin Greaves, Dow Chemical Company Synthetic lubricants are about 4% of the lubricants market. PAGs are about 24% of the synthetic lubricants market. Ethylene is the basic raw material used to make the synthetic lubricant polyglycols oils. When ethylene and propylene react with oxygen we obtain ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, from which the polyalkylene glycols are produced by means of polymerization. Polyalkylene glycols are usually made by combining ethylene oxide (EO) and/or propylene oxide (PO) with an alcohol or water. The mixing ratio between EO and PO, plus the oxygen bonded in the chemical structure, crucially affect the behavior of polyglycols. The gear industry predominantly uses polyglycols with an EO/PO ratio of 50:50 to 60:40, which exhibit very similar behavior. The polyglycols featuring this composition are also generally referred to as water soluble polyglycols.Klueber  White Paper Polyglycol-based Oils Polyalkylene glycol base oils are formed by reacting an alcohol with one or more alkylene oxides: Propylene oxide provides water insolubility, Ethylene oxide provides water solubility. PAG Properties PAGs offer properties that include: high lubricity, polarity, low traction properties, high viscosity index, controlled quenching speeds, good temperature stability and low wear. They are available in both water soluble and insoluble forms.Croda Lubricants  Polyalkylene glycol base oils PAG Uses PAGs are commonly used in quenching fluids, metalworking fluids, gear oils, chain oils, food-grade lubricants and as lubricants in HFC type hydraulics and gas compressor equipment. Croda Lubricants  Polyalkylene glycol base oils PAG lubricants are used by the two largest U.S. air compressor OEMs in rotary screw air compressors.Polyalkylene Glycol Synthetic PAG Oil Explained  Daryl Beatty, Dow Chemical Company and Martin Greaves, Dow Chemical Company PAG oils of different viscosity grades (usually either ISO VG 46 or ISO VG 100) are often used as compressor lubricants for automotive air conditioning systems employing low GWP refrigerants. PAG Advantages PAGs are available in a wide range of viscosity grades and additive packages for a variety of uses.

Motul introduced the first semi-synthetic motor oil in 1966.DELPHI history Lubricants that have synthetic base stocks even lower than 30% but with high-performance additives consisting of esters can also be considered synthetic lubricants. In general, the ratio of the synthetic base stock is used to define commodity codes among the customs declarations for tax purposes. ===Other base stocks help semi-synthetic lubricants=== API Group II- and API Group III-type base stocks help to formulate more economic-type semi- synthetic lubricants. API Group I-, II-, II+-, and III-type mineral-base oil stocks are widely used in combination with additive packages, performance packages, and ester and/or API Group IV poly-alpha-olefins in order to formulate semi-synthetic-based lubricants. API Group III base oils are sometimes considered fully synthetic, but they are still classified as highest-top-level mineral-base stocks. A synthetic or synthesized material is one that is produced by combining or building individual units into a unified entity. Synthetic base stocks as described above are man-made and tailored to have a controlled molecular structure with predictable properties, unlike mineral base oils, which are complex mixtures of naturally occurring hydrocarbons and paraffins.ASTM Fuels & Lubricants Handbook, Hydrocarbon Chemistry, pg 169-184, section 7 ==Performance== The advantages of using synthetic motor oils includes better low- and high-temperature viscosity performance at service temperature extremes better (higher) Viscosity Index (VI) and chemical and shear stability This also helps in decreasing the loss due to evaporation.Synthetic verus Mineral Fluids in Lubrication  A.

It provides better lubrication during the time when extreme cold weather starts The use of synthetic oils promises possibly a longer engine life with superior protection against \\"ash\\" and other deposit formation in engine hot spots (in particular in turbochargers and superchargers) for less oil burn-off and reduced chances of damaging oil passageway clogging. The performance of automobiles is improved as net increase in horsepower and torque due to less internal drag on engine. Moreover, it helps in improved fuel efficiency - from 1.8% to up to 5% has been documented in fleet tests. Researches suggest that synthetics performed about 47% better than regular oil.AAA study However, synthetic motor oils are substantially more expensive (per volume) than mineral oils and have potential decomposition problems in certain chemical environments (predominantly in industrial use). ==See also== * PTT Public Company Limited * Total S.A. * Amsoil * Castrol * ENEOS * ENOC * Fischer‚ÄìTropsch process * Idemitsu Kosan * Liqui Moly * Mobil 1 * Valvoline * Shell * Fuchs Petrolub * Motul * Pennzoil * Petro-Canada * Quaker State * Red Line Oil * Royal Purple * Schaeffer Oil * Silver State * Synthetic fuel == References == Category:Motor oils Category:Non-petroleum based lubricants Category:Tribology ","title":"Synthetic oil"},{"id":"522469","text":"Sergio Ortega (February 2, 1938 ‚Äì September 15, 2003) was a Chilean composer and pianist. == Biography == Ortega was born in Antofagasta, Chile. He studied composition with Roberto Falabella and with Gustavo Becerra-Schmidt in the National Conservatory at the Universidad de Chile. After graduating, he worked in the Institute of Musical Extension and was a sound engineer for six years in the University‚Äôs Experimental Theater, Teatro Antonio Varas. Ortega was a force for the leftist movement in Chile. Not only did he compose President Salvador Allende‚Äôs electoral theme song, \\"Venceremos\\" (\\"We Shall Triumph\\"), he was also the author of the worldwide anthem of popular resistance, \\"¬°El pueblo unido, jam√°s ser√° vencido!\\" (\\"The People United Will Never Be Defeated!\\"). He was also the composer of the anthems of the Partido Radical (Radical Party), the Juventudes Comunistas (Communist Youth), and the Central √önica de Trabajadores. He also turned Salvador Allende‚Äôs political plan, embodied in the texts of Julio Rojas, into an album of songs called Canto al Programa, performed by Inti-Illimani. Ortega composed some of the seminal works of the movement known as the Nueva Canci√≥n Chilena (New Chilean Song), a fusion of rhythms and styles with a social conscience. In his work, one can find poems, cantatas, operas, songs, and soundtracks. Among his most famous works are the songs \\"El monte y el r√≠o‚Äù (\\"The Mountain and the River\\", lyrics by Nicol√°s Guill√©n), and \\"Les deux mers‚Äù (\\"The Two Seas\\"), and a trilogy about the French Revolution. Ortega composed a fair number of songs for use in the theater, one of his last works being the opera of fellow communist Pablo Neruda's epic poem \\"Fulgor y muerte de Joaqu√≠n Murieta\\" (\\"Brilliance and Death of Joaqu√≠n Murieta\\"). He also worked on a musical version of Neruda's Canto General with Gustavo Becerra, which was staged in 1970. In 1978, Ortega wrote a cantata of Neruda‚Äôs \\"Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme, 1810. Poema sonoro para el padre de mi patria\\" (\\"Homage to the Father of my Country\\"), for the liberator of Chile. Ortega worked with his eldest son, Chanaral Ortega, on an operatic version of Pedro P√°ramo, the novel by Mexican writer Juan Rulfo. In 1969, Ortega became a professor of composition in the Conservatory. In his classes and master classes in composition took part: Gustavo Baez, Mirtru Escalona-Mijares, Christine Groult, Adolfo Kaplan, Sergey Kutanin, Arthur Lavilla, Clem Mounkala, Chanaral Ortega-Miranda, Martin Pavlovsky, Claire-Melanie Sinnhuber and others. In 1970, he began to direct the University's TV station, Channel 9, which he continued until 1973. At the end of 1973, after the September 11 coup, Ortega fled to France, where he resided until his death. In 1978 Ortega visited the USSR, participated in the festival \\"Red carnation\\". He was given permission to return to Chile in 1983, and did so several times. During his exile, Ortega directed L'Ecole Nationale de Musique, in Pantin, France. Ortega died of cancer at the age of 65 on September 15, 2003 in Paris, four days after the 30th anniversary of the coup d‚Äôetat. His remains were repatriated to Chile. ==External links== *Sergio Ortega's official website Category:1938 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Chilean activists Category:Chilean composers Category:Chilean male composers Category:Chilean Marxists Category:Chilean socialists Category:Musical theatre composers Category:Nueva canci√≥n musicians Category:People from Antofagasta Category:Deaths from cancer in France Category:Chilean pianists Category:20th-century pianists Category:Male pianists ","title":"Sergio Ortega"},{"id":"522472","text":"The middlegame in chess is the portion of the game in between the opening and the endgame, though there is no clear line between the opening and middlegame, and between the middlegame and endgame. The middle game begins when both players have completed the development of all or most of their pieces and the king has been brought to relative safety. However, at master level, the opening analysis may go well into the middlegame. Likewise, the middlegame blends into the endgame. There are differing opinions and criteria for when the middlegame ends and the endgame starts (see the start of the endgame). Factors such as control of the center are less important in the endgame than the middlegame. In endgames the number of pieces and pawns is much reduced, though even after queens are traded, one may talk about a \\"middlegame without queens.\\" The endgame is often said to begin when the kings can safely play an active role. Theory on the middlegame is less developed than the opening or endgames. Since middlegame positions are unique from game to game, memorization of theoretical variations is not possible as it is in the opening. Likewise, there are usually too many pieces on the board for theoretical positions to be completely analyzed as can be done in the simpler endgames. ==Aims of the middlegame== The Middle Game in Chess by Reuben Fine lists three major factors in the middlegame: king safety, force (material) and mobility, although not all of these factors are of equal importance. If king safety is a serious issue, a well-executed attack on the king can render other considerations, including material advantages, irrelevant. Material is another important consideration, Fine notes that‚Äîif all other things are equal‚Äîany material advantage will usually be decisive. According to Fine, a material advantage will usually not give a direct mating attack unless the advantage is very large (a rook or more), rather it can be used as a means of gaining more material and a decisive endgame advantage. To gain mobility is to ensure that the pieces have a wide scope of action and targets to focus on. The concept is largely strategic in nature, and involves such concepts as space, pawn weaknesses (since weak pawns can compel pieces to defensive duties, reducing their mobility), and securing outposts for the pieces. The strategy required for middlegame play varies considerably. Some middlegame positions feature featuring maneuvering behind the lines, while other middlegames are wide open, where both players attempt to gain the initiative. Dan Heisman noted three features which can seriously alter the way the middlegame is played. First, if the kings are castled on opposite wings, and queens remain on the board, the position can be very violent, with both players aiming to assault the enemy king. Material considerations are often secondary to pursuing the attack, and it can even be advantageous to lose pawns in front of the enemy king in order to open up lines for the rooks and queen. Second, positions where the pawn structure is static and locked, can also feature mutual attacks, since players often elect to play on the side where they have more space (playing on the side of the board in which their pawns are pointing). Time is often less of a concern in such middlegames, allowing lengthy maneuvers. Players attempt to strengthen their positions and weaken their opponent's. Both players need to be on the lookout for pawn breaks, and the possibility of taking advantage of the open files which may arise from them. Third, if one player has an overwhelming material advantage and is clearly winning, the stronger player can usually afford to violate several of the normal middlegame principles in order to trade down to an endgame. For example, trading queens even at the cost of a ruined pawn structure may be a viable option. ==Transition to the endgame== Not all games reach the endgame, since an attack on the king, or a combination leading to large material gains can end the game while it is still in the middlegame. At other times, an advantage needs to be pursued in the endgame, and learning how to make favorable exchanges leading to a favorable endgame is an important skill. The last thing that happens in the middlegame is the setup for endgame. Since many endgames involve the promotion of a pawn, it is usually good to keep that in mind when making trades during the middlegame. For example, World Champion Max Euwe considered a preponderance of pawns on the (queenside majority) an advantage because this might be used to create a passed pawn. ==See also== * Chess terminology * Chess strategy * Chess tactics * Opening * Endgame * Chess piece relative value * Pawn structure ==Notes== ==Reference works Classical middlegame textbooks === Works mostly written before 1970. * Euwe, Max and H.

Category:Chess theory ","title":"Chess middlegame"},{"id":"522476","text":"In a molecule, a stereocenter is a particular instance of a stereogenic element that is geometrically a point. A stereocenter or stereogenic center is any point in a molecule, though not necessarily an atom, bearing different substituents, such that interchanging any two substituents leads to a stereoisomer. The term stereocenter was introduced in 1984 by Kurt Mislow and Jay Siegel. A chirality center is a stereocenter consisting of an atom holding a set of ligands (atoms or groups of atoms) in a spatial arrangement which is not superimposable on its mirror image. The concept of a chirality center generalizes the concept of an asymmetric carbon atom (a carbon atom bonded to four different entities) such that an interchanging of any two groups gives rise to an enantiomer. In organic chemistry, a chirality center usually refers to a carbon, phosphorus, or sulfur atom, though it is also possible for other atoms to be chirality centers, especially in areas of organometallic and inorganic chemistry. ==Possible number of stereoisomers== A molecule can have multiple stereocenters, giving it many stereoisomers. In compounds whose stereoisomerism is due to tetrahedral stereogenic centers, the total number of hypothetically possible stereoisomers will not exceed 2n, where n is the number of tetrahedral stereocenters. However, this is an upper bound because molecules with symmetry frequently have fewer stereoisomers. Having two chirality centers may give a meso compound which is achiral. Certain configurations may not exist due to steric reasons. Cyclic compounds with chiral centers may not exhibit chirality due to the presence of a two-fold rotation axis. Planar chirality may also provide for chirality without having an actual chiral center present. ==Stereogenic on carbon== The carbon which has four different groups or atoms attached to it is called a chiral carbon. ==Stereogenic on other atoms== Chirality is not limited to carbon atoms, though carbon atoms are often centers of chirality due to their ubiquity in organic chemistry. Nitrogen and phosphorus atoms can also form bonds in a tetrahedral configuration. A nitrogen in an amine may be a stereocenter if all three groups attached are different because the electron pair of the amine functions as a fourth group. However, nitrogen inversion, a form of pyramidal inversion, causes racemization which means that both epimers at that nitrogen are present under normal circumstances. Racemization by nitrogen inversion may be restricted (such as quaternary ammonium or phosphonium cations), or slow, which allows the existence of chirality. Metal atoms with tetrahedral or octahedral geometries may also be chiral due to having different ligands. For the octahedral case, several chiralities are possible. Having three ligands of two types, the ligands may be lined up along the meridian, giving the mer- isomer, or forming a face--the fac isomer. Having three bidentate ligands of only one type gives a propeller-type structure, with two different enantiomers denoted Œõ and Œî. ==See also== * Chirality_(chemistry)#Stereogenic_centers * Cahn‚ÄìIngold‚ÄìPrelog priority rules for nomenclature ==References== Category:Stereochemistry ","title":"Stereocenter"},{"id":"522477","text":"Jarlshof ( ) is the best known prehistoric archaeological site in Shetland, Scotland.

Retrieved 2 August 2008. It contains remains dating from 2500 BC up to the 17th century AD. The Bronze Age settlers left evidence of several small oval houses with thick stone walls and various artefacts including a decorated bone object. The Iron Age ruins include several different types of structures, including a broch and a defensive wall around the site. The Pictish period provides various works of art including a painted pebble and a symbol stone. The Viking Age ruins make up the largest such site visible anywhere in Britain and include a longhouse; excavations provided numerous tools and a detailed insight into life in Shetland at this time. The most visible structures on the site are the walls of the Scottish period fortified manor house, which inspired the name \\"Jarlshof\\" that first appears in an 1821 novel by Walter Scott. The site is in the care of Historic Scotland and is open from April to September. In 2010 \\"The Crucible of Iron Age Shetland\\" including Mousa, Old Scatness and Jarlshof was added to those seeking to be on the \\"tentative list\\" of World Heritage Sites.\\"From Chatham to Chester and Lincoln to the Lake District ‚Äì 38 UK places put themselves forward for World Heritage status\\" United Kingdom Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

The site overlooks an arm of the sea called the West Voe of Sumburgh and the nearby freshwater springs and building materials available on the beach will have added to the location's attraction as a settlement. The south Mainland also provides a favourable location for arable cultivation in a Shetland context and there is a high density of prehistoric settlement in the surrounding area.Dockrill, Stepehen J. \\"Brochs, economy and power\\" in Smith and Banks (2002) p. 156. Jarlshof is only one mile from Scatness where the remains of another broch and other ruins of a similar longevity were discovered in 1975. There is a small visitor centre at Jarlshof with displays and a collection of artefacts.Armit (1996) p. 152.

Other than the Old House of Sumburgh (see below) the site remained largely hidden until a storm in the late 19th century washed away part of the shore, and revealed evidence of these ancient buildings. Formal archaeological excavation started in 1925 and Bronze Age relics were soon discovered. Jarlshof was one of two broch sites which were the first to be excavated using modern scientific techniques between 1949‚Äì52. Although the deposits within the broch had been badly disturbed by earlier attempts, this work revealed a complex sequence of construction from different periods.Armit (2003) pp. 26‚Äì28. The work was undertaken by John Hamilton of the Ministry of Works at Jarlshof and Clickhimin. Buildings on the site include the remains of a Bronze Age smithy, an Iron Age broch and roundhouses, a complex of Pictish wheelhouses, a Viking longhouse,Jarlshof Prehistoric & Norse Settlement\\" Historic Scotland.

No further excavations have been undertaken since the early 1950s and no radiocarbon dating has been attempted. ===Neolithic=== The earliest finds are pottery from the Neolithic era, although the main settlement dates from the Bronze Age (see below). A site nearby has been dated to 3200 BC.Nicolson, James R. (1972) Shetland. David & Charles. Newton Abbott. pp. 33‚Äì35. ===Bronze Age=== The Bronze Age in Scotland lasted from approximately 2000 BC to 800 BC.Scotland: 2200‚Äì800 BC Bronze Age\\" worldtimelines.org.uk Retrieved 23 August 2008. The oldest known remains on the Jarlshof site date from this period, although there is evidence of inhabitation as far back as 2500 BC.Gilmour, Simon \\"Mid-first millennium BC settlement in the Atlantic West?\\" in Smith and Banks (2002) p. 55. The remains of several small oval houses with thick stone walls date to the late Bronze Age and the structures show some similarity to Skara Brae on Mainland, Orkney, but are smaller and of a later date. These buildings may have been partly subterranean at the earliest period of inhabitation, a technique that provided both structural stability and insulation.Armit (2003) p. 28. There is also evidence of a cattle stall with a waste channel leading to a tank in a courtyard and a whale vertebra set into a wall that may have been used as a tethering post. Broken moulds from the smithy indicate that axes, knives, swords and pins were produced there and a bronze dagger was found at the site. The objects indicate the smith was trained in the Irish style of working.Turner (1998) p. 59.Nicolson (1972) p. 33. Nicolson states that the smith \\"came from Ireland\\", but provides no supporting evidence. Bone pins and awls also survive and an extraordinary bone \\"plaque\\". This latter object is long, has three holes bored into the ends and is decorated with various linear patterns. Its function is unknown.Turner (1998) pp. 29‚Äì30. The Bronze Age structures are overlain with sterile sand, suggesting a break in occupation prior to the next phase of building.Armit (2003) pp. 29, 39. ===Iron Age and Pictish period=== The exterior of the wheelhouses at Jarlshof The inhabitants of the Iron Age built part of their settlement on top of the Bronze Age one. The structures include a complex roundhouse, replaced at a later stage by an \\"aisled roundhouse\\". Neither have been dated although artefacts found at this level include querns that suggest the latter may have been constructed prior to 200 BC.Armit (2003) p. 49. It is in this period that the broch was built. Part of the structure has been lost to coastal erosion, and modern sea defences have been erected. The tower was probably originally 13 metres (40 feet) or more high and as with many broch sites the position would have commanded fine views of the surrounding seas.Nicolson (1972) p. 33. During this period archaeological sites in Shetland usually exhibit defensive fortifications of some kind, and Jarlshof is no exception.Turner (1998) p. 63. An outer defensive wall associated with the broch contained a substantial (although rather poorly constructed) house and byre at one time.Turner (1998) p. 74. This wall was utilised at a later stage to build a large roundhouse in the lee of the broch.Nicolson (1972) p. 35. The interior of a Jarlshof wheelhouse showing bays between the stone piers. The earliest part of the wheelhouse complex has been dated to 200 BC, although other parts were built later, post-dating the 1st century BC‚Äì2nd century AD profusion of these structures in the Western Isles by several centuries.Armit (2003) p. 135. Construction used the stones of the broch itself and two of the four main structures are amongst the best examples of their type.Crawford, Iain \\"The wheelhouse\\" in Smith and Banks (2002) p. 116. Three successive periods of construction were undertaken, and the best preserved retains a significant proportion of the stone part of its roof and displays a series of corbelled bays.Armit (2006) p. 124. One structure was built as a circular building and the radial piers were inserted afterwards. This may have been an earlier, less stable design. In one case the piers are alternately rectangular and V-shaped, in another all are to the latter design, again suggesting a developing style. Unlike many wheelhouses elsewhere in Scotland that are built into the earth, the Jarlshof structures seem to have been built from ground level upwards.Turner (1998) pp. 81‚Äì2. Amongst the artefacts dated to the later Pictish period is a bone pin with a rounded head probably used as a hair or dress pin. It has been dated to AD 500‚Äì800.\\"Bone pin\\" National Museums Scotland. Retrieved 16 August 2008. \\"Painted pebbles\\" are associated with more than two dozen Pictish sites and one such stone was unearthed at Jarlshof. This rectangular slate fragment had a cross painted onto it and two small \\"S\\" shaped scrolls suggesting an association with Christian beliefs.Turner (1998) p. 86. The stone is painted with a brown-black stain of unknown provenance and the purpose of these devices is obscure. One of only two Pictish symbol stones found in Shetland was found here, exhibiting a double disc shape and a Z-rod.Turner (1998) p. 87. Pottery finds include buff ware from the period after AD 10, including bowls with flat rims. The quality of the pots appears to decline in the period prior to Viking settlement, becoming thinner-walled and generally more crude in design.Laing (2006) p. 90 In AD 43 and 77 the Roman authors Pomponius Mela and Pliny the Elder referred to the seven islands they call Haemodae and Acmodae respectively, both of which are assumed to be Shetland. Another early written reference to the Shetland islands may have been when Tacitus reported that the Roman fleet had seen \\"Thule\\" on a voyage that included the Orkney archipelago in AD 98.\\"The fleet must have sailed on to the Shetlands since ... the only land likely to be visible from ... the Orkney coast would be Fair Isle\\" ‚Äì Ogilvie and Richmond, 1967 Watson in 1926 stated that Tacitus was referring to southern Shetland, probably the area of the brochs in Jarlshof. ===Norse period=== Remains from this era used to cover most of the site, and it is believed the Norse inhabited the site continuously from the ninth to the 14th centuries.Nicolson (1972) p. 39. Excavations in the 1930s by Alex Curle found the first confirmed Norse longhouse in the British Isles and later digs in the 1950s found evidence of fishing and farming activities.\\"Jarlshof\\" Shetlopedia.

Re-creation of a Viking settlement in L'Anse-aux-Meadows, Newfoundland, Canada similar in scale to Jarlshof. There are seven Norse-era houses at Jarlshof, although no more than two were in use at one time. There were several outbuildings, including a small square structure with a large hearth that may have been a sauna and which was later replaced by two separate outhouses.Armit (2006) p. 177. The largest house from this period is a rectangular chamber with opposing doors, timber benches along the long sides, and a hearth in the centre. Unlike the earlier structures that had conical thatched roofs, those of the Norse buildings had ridged timber frames. At a later period this large structure was also used to shelter domesticated animals (at which stage it had a paved centre and animal stalls along the sides) and later still may have become an outbuilding. The door to the byre puzzled archaeologists as it appeared to be too narrow to admit a cow. The mystery was solved when a byre door was excavated at Easting on Unst which had a narrow base similar to Jarlshof's but which widened out to become cow-shaped.Turner (1998) pp. 104‚Äì05.Armit (2006) pp. 176‚Äì77. Another outbuilding has been interpreted as a corn-drying room.Turner (1998) p. 104. Later houses were built at 90 degrees to the longhouse and these are of a type and size that is similar to croft houses that were common in Shetland until the mid-19th century.Turner (1998) p. 105. One hundred and fifty loom weights were found suggesting wool was an important aspect of Norse-era life. Line weights from the later Norse period and associated evidence from elsewhere in Shetland indicates that deep-water fishing was also a regular undertaking.Turner (1998) pp. 100, 106. The Jarlshof site also produced ample evidence of the use of iron tools such as shears, scissors, sickles, and a fish-hook and knife. The ore was locally obtained bog iron.Turner (1998) p. 107. Hazel, birch and willow grew in the area at this time but the pine and oak must have been driftwood or imported timber. Drawings scratched on slate have been found of dragon-prowed ships, portraits of an old man and of a young, bearded man and of a four-legged animal. The drawings were found in the Viking levels but are Pictish in style and may either pre-date the arrival of the Norse or indicate a continuity of art and culture from one period to the next.Ritchie (2003) suggests the Norse may have found a use for Pictish carvings, although Armit (2006) pp. 176, 178 notes that a similar continuity of tools and ornaments exists at Brough of Birsay. Similarly, although the rectangular shape of the Norse-era buildings are quite unlike the earlier rounded Pictish style, the basement courses of the two periods are constructed in the same way. The Viking-style loom weights, spindle whorls and other vessels were found with stone discs and other objects of a Pictish design.Turner (1998) pp. 100, 104.

Jarlshof contains the most extensive remains of a Viking site visible anywhere in Britain. ===Old House of Sumburgh=== The Old House of Sumburgh dating from the early 17th century The castle, now known as Jarlshof House, was built during the Scottish period. Originally a medieval stone farmhouse, it was converted into a fortified house during the 16th century, by Robert Stewart, 1st Earl of Orkney after Scotland annexed Shetland. The building was named \\"New Hall\\" at this time. It was further modernised in the early 17th century by his son Patrick Stewart, 2nd Earl of Orkney who renamed it the \\"Old House of Sumburgh\\". It then passed into the keeping of John Buchanan and Margaret Hartsyde, but was abandoned in the late 17th century.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1895), p. 715. The structure was also known as \\"The laird's house\\" and \\"Stewart Mansion\\". ==Cultural references== Walter Scott set part of his 1821 novel The Pirate in the Old House of Sumburgh during the 17th century, which he named Jarlshof. :\\"Man, however, had in former days considered this as a remote or unlikely event; for a Norwegian chief of other times, or, as other accounts said, and as the name of Jarlshof seemed to imply an ancient Earl of the Orkneys had elected this neck of land as the place for establishing a mansion-house. It has been long entirely deserted, and the vestiges only can be discerned with difficulty; for the loose sand, borne on the temptestuous gales of those stormy regions, has overblown, and almost buried, the ruins of the buildings; but in the end of the seventeenth century, a part of the Earl's mansion was still entire and habitable. It was a rude building of rough stone, with nothing about it to gratify the eye, or to excite the imagination; a large old-fashioned narrow house, with a very steep roof, covered with flags composed of grey sandstone, would perhaps convey the best of idea of the place to a modern reader. The windows were few, very small in size, and distributed up and down the building with utter contempt of regularity. Against the main structure had rested, in former times, certain smaller compartments of the mansion-house, containing offices, or subordinate apartments, necessary for the Earl's retainers and menials. But these had become ruinous; and the rafters had been taken down for fire-wood, or for other purposes; the walls had given way in many places; and, to complete the devastation, the sand had already drifted amongst the ruins, and filled up what had been once the chambers the contained, to the depth of two or three feet. :\\"Amid this desolation, the inhabitants of Jarlshof had contrived, by constant labour and attention, to keep in order a few roods of land, which had been enclosed as a garden, and which, sheltered by the walls of the house itself, from the relentless sea-blast, produced such vegetables as the climate could bring forth, or rather as the sea-gale would permit to grow; for these islands experience even less of the rigour of cold than is encountered on the mainland of Scotland; but, unsheltered by a wall of some sort of other, it is scarce possible to raise even the most ordinary culinary vegetables; and as for shrubs or trees, they are entirely out of the question, such is the force of the sweeping sea-blast.\\" ==See also== Shetland *Broch of Clickimin *Broch of Mousa *Old Scatness *Scalloway Castle Other *Prehistoric Scotland *Timeline of prehistoric Scotland *Prehistoric Orkney *Brough of Birsay ‚Äì a site of similar antiquity in Orkney *Oldest buildings in the United Kingdom ==References== * Armit, Ian (2003), Towers in the North: The Brochs of Scotland.

R. R. Tolkien's The Fall of Gondolin is one of the stories in The Book of Lost Tales which formed the basis for a section in his later work, The Silmarillion. A stand-alone, book-length version of the story was published in 2018. The Fall of Gondolin is one of three stories from the First Age of Middle-earth to be published as a stand-alone book: the other two are Beren and L√∫thien and The Children of H√∫rin. ==Story== Gondolin was a secret city of Elves in the First Age of Middle-earth. The Fall of Gondolin tells of the founding of the city; of the arrival there of Tuor, a prince of Men; of the betrayal of the city to Morgoth by the king's nephew, Maeglin; and of its subsequent catastrophic destruction by Morgoth's armies. It also relates the flight of the fugitives to the Havens of Sirion, the wedding of Tuor and Idril, as well as the childhood of their son E√§rendil. ==Gondolin== Gondolin\\"Tolkien explained its origin in his \\"Name-list to \\"The Fall of Gondolin\\" thus: \\"Gondolin meaneth in Gnomish 'stone of song' (whereby figuratively the Gnomes meant stone that was carven and wrought to great beauty)\\". Tolkien, J. R. R. The Book of Lost Tales, part II. p. 216. was founded with divine inspiration. It was hidden by mountains and endured for centuries before being betrayed and destroyed. It was the mightiest of the elven homes in the Hither Lands. The city was famed for its walls, and had possible parallels to Troy. Gondolin was founded by King Turgon in the First Age. It was originally named 'Ondolind√´'. According to The Silmarillion, the Vala Ulmo, the Lord of Waters, revealed the location of the Vale of Tumladen to Turgon in a dream. Under this divine guidance, Turgon travelled from his kingdom in Nevrast and found the vale. Within the Echoriath, the Encircling Mountains, lay a round level plain with sheer walls on all sides and a ravine and tunnel leading out to the southwest known as the Hidden Way. In the middle of the vale there was a steep hill which was called Amon Gwareth, the \\"Hill of Watch\\". There Turgon decided to found a city, designed after the city of Tirion in Valinor that the Noldor had left. Turgon and his people built Gondolin in secret. After it was completed, he took with him to dwell in the hidden city his entire people in Nevrast‚Äîalmost a third of the Noldor of Fingolfin's House‚Äîas well as nearly three quarters of the northern Sindar. === The seven gates of the city === The Hidden Pass was protected by seven gates, all constantly guarded; the first of wood, then stone, bronze, iron, silver, gold, and steel, perhaps based on Herodotus's description of the Medean city of Ecbatana. The seven gates of Minas Tirith echoed this notion of a layered defence on a hill. === The fall of the city === The city stood for nearly 400 years until it was betrayed to Morgoth by Maeglin, Turgon's nephew. Maeglin was captured while mining outside the Encircling Mountains (against Turgon's orders). Maeglin betrayed the location of Gondolin after being promised Lordship and Turgon's daughter Idril. Morgoth then sent an army over the Crissaegrim, the northernmost precipitous and dangerous portion of the Encircling Mountains, during The Gates of Summer (a great Gondolin festival), catching them unawares and sacking the city with relative ease. In addition to orcs, Balrogs and dragons, Melkor's (Morgoth's) army, in early versions of the story, included iron machines (tanks) powered by \\"internal fires\\" and used as personnel carriers, to surmount difficult geographic obstacles and to defeat fortifications. The Fall of Gondolin closely resembles that of Troy. === The seven names of Gondolin === According to The Book of Lost Tales, the city had seven names: \\"‚ÄôTis said and ‚Äôtis sung: Gondobar am I called and Gondothlimbar, City of Stone and City of the Dwellers in Stone; Gondolin the Stone of Song and Gwarestrin am I named, the Tower of the Guard, Gar Thurion or the Secret Place, for I am hidden from the eyes of Melko; but they who love me most greatly call me Loth, for like a flower am I, even Lothengriol the flower that blooms on the plain.\\" === The Houses of Gondolin === According to The Book of Lost Tales the active male Elves of Gondolin belonged to one of the 11 \\"Houses\\" or Thlim plus the bodyguard of Tuor which was accounted the twelfth: { class= width=100% !Name in Gnomish of the HousesThese Elvish names come from a text written by Tolkien: \\"The Official Name List\\", and published in Parma Eldalamberon n¬∫ 13, pp. 100‚Äì105. !!Leader!!colspan=2Uniforms and emblems!!Notes - The folk of the White WingTuor60px\\"These wore wings as it were of swans or gulls upon their helms, and the emblem of the White Wing was upon their shields.\\"J.

Thus the city was usually called Gondolin (from Q. Ondolin(d√´)) with simple replacement of g-, not Goenlin or Goenglin [as it would have been in standard Sindarin]\\".J.R.R. Tolkien, \\"Words, Phrases and Passages\\", Parma Eldalamberon 17, p. 29 The common or standard Sindarin tongue was not used in Gondolin. ===Weaponry=== The smiths of Gondolin, using Elven craft, made powerful weapons. In The Hobbit, the swords Orcrist, Glamdring and a long dagger later named Sting were found in a Troll-hoard.The Hobbit, ch. 3 \\"A Short Rest\\" Each of these weapons had the ability to detect Orcs in the immediate vicinity by glowing blue. They also had the property of striking fear in the hearts of Orcs when used against them in combat. All were well- crafted, and extraordinarily sharp. Apparently, Gondolinian weapons were impervious to rust and corrosion, as the examples found in the trolls' lair were over 6,000 years old and had been hanging in the lair for an indeterminate length of time, yet were sharp and ready for use when unsheathed. The dagger Sting was highly effective against giant spiders (distant offspring of Ungoliant) and could cut their webs with ease, including the spiders of Mirkwood and Shelob. Sting was able to cut the spider's eyes and wound her sufficiently that she fled in pain. Such creatures were common in the Ered Gorgoroth south of Gondolin. ==Origin and publication history== Tolkien began writing the story that would become The Fall of Gondolin in 1917 in an army barracks on the back of a sheet of military marching music. It is the first traceable story of his Middle-earth legendarium that he wrote down on paper. While the first half of the story \\"appears to echo Tolkien's creative development and slow acceptance of duty in the first year of the war,\\" the second half echoes his personal experience of battle. The story was read aloud by Tolkien to the Exeter College Essay Club in the spring of 1920.Tolkien, J.R.R. The Book of Lost Tales, Part II. p. 147. Tolkien was constantly revising his First Age stories; however, the narrative he wrote in 1917, published posthumously in The Book of Lost Tales, remains the only full account of the fall of the city. The narrative in The Silmarillion was the result of the editing by his son Christopher using that story (minus some elements all too obviously evocative of World War I warfare) and compressed versions from the different versions of the Annals and Quentas as various sources. The later Quenta Silmarillion and the Grey Annals of Beleriand, the main sources for much of the published Silmarillion, both stop before the beginning of the Tuor story. A partial later version of The Fall of Gondolin was published in Unfinished Tales under the title \\"Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin\\". Originally titled \\"Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin,\\" this narrative shows a great expansion of the earlier tale. Christopher Tolkien retitled the story before including it in Unfinished Tales, because it ends at the point of Tuor's arrival in Gondolin, and does not depict the actual Fall. There is also an unfinished poem, The Lay of the Fall of Gondolin, of which a few verses are quoted in The Lays of Beleriand. In 130 verses Tolkien reaches the point where dragons attack the city. ==Stand-alone book== On 30 August 2018, the first stand-alone version of the story was published by HarperCollins in the UK and Houghton Mifflin in the US. This version, illustrated by Alan Lee, has been curated and edited by Christopher Tolkien, J.R.R. Tolkien's son, who also edited The Silmarillion, The Children of H√∫rin, and several other works that were published after the author's death. The book compiles material previously published elsewhere, namely The Tale of The Fall of Gondolin and Isfin and E√∂l both published in The Book of Lost Tales, Part Two; Turlin and the Exiles of Gondolin published in The Shaping of Middle- earth; excerpts from the Sketch of the Mythology and Quenta Noldorinwa, both published in The Shaping of Middle-Earth; and Of Tuor and The Fall of Gondolin published in Unfinished Tales, along with excerpts from The Silmarillion and elsewhere. ===Reception=== According to Entertainment Weekly, \\"Patient and dedicated readers will find among the references to other books and their many footnotes and appendices a poignant sense of completion and finality to the life's pursuit of a father and son.\\" Writing for The Washington Post, writer Andrew Ervin said that \\"'The Fall of Gondolin' provides everything Tolkien's readers expect.\\" According to The Independent, \\"Even amid the complexities and difficulties of the book‚Äîand there are many‚Äîthere is enough splendid imagery and characterful prose that readers will be carried along to the end even if they don't know where they are going.\\" ==See also== * Middle-earth canon ==ReferencesPrimary=== ::This list identifies each item's location in Tolkien's writings. ===Secondary=== Category:Books published posthumously Category:Middle-earth books Category:2018 books Category:2018 fantasy novels Category:English fantasy novels Category:HarperCollins books ","title":"The Fall of Gondolin"},{"id":"522513","text":"Belltown Belltown is the most densely populated neighborhood in Seattle, Washington, United States, located on the city's downtown waterfront on land that was artificially flattened as part of a regrading project. Formerly a low-rent, semi-industrial arts district, in recent decades it has transformed into a neighborhood of trendy restaurants, boutiques, nightclubs, and residential towers as well as warehouses and art galleries. The area is named after William Nathaniel Bell, on whose land claim the neighborhood was built. In 2007, CNNMoney named Belltown the best place to retire in the Seattle metro area, calling it \\"a walkable neighborhood with everything you need.\\" Belltown is home to Antioch University, Argosy University, City University of Seattle, and the Seattle School of Theology & Psychology. It lies directly west of the Denny Triangle neighborhood, where online retailer Amazon is constructing three office towers to house its downtown headquarters, and where the Cornish College of the Arts is located. ==Businesses== Although many new businesses have eclipsed older ones, some venerated establishments still draw crowds of loyal patrons, such as the locally famous Bavarian Meat Products. Some of the classic, old Seattle nightspots in Belltown are: The Rendezvous, The Lava Lounge, Ohana, The Crocodile Cafe, and Shorty's. At one time Alaska Airlines had its headquarters in what is now Belltown.\\"World Airline Directory.\\" Flight International. April 11, 1963. 511. ==Geography== Belltown as seen from West Seattle The neighborhood is bounded on the north by Denny Way, beyond which lies Seattle Center, Lower Queen Anne, and Queen Anne Hill, on the southwest by Elliott Bay, on the southeast by Virginia Street, beyond which lies the Pike Place Market and the rest of Downtown, and on the northeast by 5th Avenue, beyond which lies the Denny Triangle. All of its northwest- and southeast-bound streets are major thoroughfares (Alaskan Way and Elliott, Western, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Avenues); major northeast- and southwest-bound thoroughfares are Broad, Wall, and Battery Streets. The Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel runs under Belltown for a number of blocks as it connects the Alaskan Freeway to Aurora Avenue N. North on Western Avenue at Vine Street is the Belltown P-Patch and the Cottage Park. These single family homes built in 1916 are the last of 11 on the 1/4 block. The Cottages mark the 1850s shoreline and are the last remaining wood framed residences in downtown Seattle. The Belltown P-Patch provides gardening opportunities through the City of Seattle P-Patch program. ==Sculpture garden== The Olympic Sculpture Park, a public sculpture garden of adjacent to Myrtle Edwards Park, is located on the northern edge of the Belltown waterfront. The park features contemporary pieces, various ecosystems with plants indigenous to the Pacific Northwest, and a restored beach and seawall. The park's construction was funded entirely with private donations and is operated by the Seattle Art Museum. Unlike other such parks in the United States, the Olympic Sculpture Park is unwalled, and admission is free. ==\\"Film Row\\"== The McGraw-Kittenger- Case Building at the corner of Second and Battery, and behind that the William Tell Hotel. Beyond that, the former National Theater Building, now painted blue, can barely be seen The Path√© Theatre at 717 1st Avenue opened around 1910 and a Path√© Exchange debuted at 2113 3rd Avenue. In August 1916, the Mutual Exchange opened at 3rd and Virginia in a building with an auditorium. The first building constructed for Seattle's burgeoning film industry and in what would become \\"Film Row\\" in Belltown opened in 1922 in the Pathe Building designed by Julian F. Everett at 2025 3rd Avenue (which was demolished in 2016). Eventually, silent-era film exchanges in Seattle serviced approximately 470 commercial movie theaters throughout Washington, Idaho, Montana and Oregon.Megan Lee, H-wood in B-town: Belltown's Historic Film Row , Belltown Messenger, July 2005. Concern about the flammability of nitrocellulose film resulted in the concentration of film exchanges in this single neighborhood, as a zoning issue.\\"Film Storage Bill Up For Discussion\\"; in 1915‚Äì1920 clipping file in the Seattle Room of the Seattle Central Library.

From the 1920s into at least the 1960s, Second Avenue in Belltown was home to Seattle's second \\"Film Row.\\" In 1928, just after the era of talkies began, the role of the Second Avenue film row was consolidated by the erection of the terra-cotta-ornamented, art deco Film Exchange Building (FEB, also known as the Canterbury Building) designed by Seattle architect Earl W. Morrison; it covered an entire block on the west side of Second Avenue, from Battery Street to Wall Street. By 1930, Polk lists only 18 Seattle film exchanges; while Kodascope Libraries is at 111 Cherry Street in the Pioneer Square neighborhood, all of the others are on Second Avenue within a block of Battery Street (save only Columbia Pictures at First and Battery).1930 Seattle City Directory, R.L. Polk, 1930. This situation was essentially unchanged in 1948: 19 entries under \\"Motion Picture Distributors and Film Exchanges\\", 15 of them in this same two blocks, and two of the others elsewhere in Belltown.1948‚Äì1949 Seattle City Directory, R.L.

Immediately south, the block of Second Avenue on the other side of Battery still contains many remnants of the Film Row era. The Jewel Box theater of the Rendezvous bar is the one remaining screening room in the neighborhood, but several other buildings remain.

It is provided in recognition of the opposition leader's position. Located at 541 Acacia Avenue in the Rockcliffe Park area of Ottawa of Ontario province. Stornoway has assessed value $4,225,000 (2008) (based on this value, which is only approximation of market value, the municipal property taxes are calculated) and is maintained with $70,000 a year in government funds. The property has been owned and managed by the National Capital Commission since April 1986. The lot size, with a frontage of and depth of , is slightly irregular. The property is from Ottawa's Parliament Buildings, whereas the Prime Minister's official residence is only away from Parliament. It is located in an area which contains many ambassadorial residences. ==History== The house was built by architect Allan Keefer in 1914 for Ottawa grocer Ascanio J. Major and was given the name \\"Stornoway\\" by the second occupants, Irvine Gale Perley- Robertson and Ethel Lesa Perley, after the ancestral home of the Perley family in the Outer Hebrides in Scotland. During the Second World War, from summer 1941 to 1945, Mrs. Perley-Robertson offered Stornoway to (then) Princess Juliana of the Netherlands as a temporary home-in-exile for the Dutch Royal Family, including the future Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands. Stornoway has served its present role as the Official Opposition Leader's residence since 1950, when it was purchased by a group of concerned citizens and later transferred to the Government of Canada. Although the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois were the official Opposition from 1993 to 1997, party leader Lucien Bouchard declined to move into the residence as a mark of protest against the federal government, choosing instead to live in nearby Gatineau, Quebec. His successor, Gilles Duceppe, also did not reside in Stornoway. Following the 1997 election, when the Reform Party displaced the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois to become the largest opposition party, the new official Opposition Leader, Preston Manning, declined to move in for a different reason: he protested that it was too extravagant and a waste of taxpayers' money, even joking that it should be used as a bingo hall to pay off the national debt. Manning asked that he be provided with a more 'modest' residence, but soon moved into Stornoway after his refusal to do so began to be portrayed in the media as a mark of disrespect for his position as Leader of the Opposition. Renovations from 2002 to 2006 included an overhaul of the living room and kitchen, repair of the chimney, replacement of carpets, refinishing of hardwood floors, and painting, among other things. Jack Layton, who had led the NDP to official Opposition status in the May 2, 2011 election, moved in a month later, but stated that he would continue to live in Toronto when Parliament was out of session. He died on August 22 of cancer; it was subsequently revealed that Layton and his wife Olivia Chow actually spent just one night in the house.\\"Layton spent one night at Stornoway\\". iPolitics, August 25, 2011. His interim successor as NDP leader, Nycole Turmel, also did not formally move into the house, though she used Stornoway for entertaining purposes and slept over on occasion.\\"Mulcair takes up residence at Stornoway\\". CBC News, April 18, 2012. Of the Leaders of the Opposition, John Reynolds, Bill Graham, and Rona Ambrose are the only interim party leaders to have resided at Stornoway; Ambrose was the most recent resident after being selected as interim leader of the Conservative Party after the defeat of Stephen Harper in the 2015 Canadian federal election. All other residents have been permanent party leaders (ratified at a leadership convention).. Andrew Scheer moved in after being elected as leader of the Conservative party in the 2017 leadership election. ===List of residents=== Completed in 1914, the building had three occupants prior to its acquisition by the Government of Canada. Ascanio Joseph Major, a local grocer, was the original occupant of Stornoway, residing there from 1914 to 1923. In 1923, the Perley-Robertson family acquired the home. From 1941 to 1945, during the Second World War, the Dutch Royal Family leased the home from the Perley- Robertson family. Andrew Scheer (right foreground) with his family in Stornoway's kitchen, September 2019. He has resided in Stornoway from 2017 to present as the Leader of the Official Opposition. In 1950, the building was acquired by a private trust, and later transferred to the Government of Canada. Since 1950, Stornoway has been used as the official residence of the leader of the official opposition in the House of Commons of Canada. Official opposition leaders (including interim leaders) who resided in Stornoway include: *George A. Drew 1950‚Äì56 *John Diefenbaker 1957 *Vacant, as Louis St. Laurent declined to use the house, due to his intending to step down as Liberal leader following his government's defeat 1957‚Äì58 *Lester B.

The town's population is around 8,000, making it by far the largest town in the Hebrides, as well as the second largest island town in Scotland after Kirkwall in Orkney. The traditional civil parish of Stornoway, which includes various nearby villages, has a combined population of just over 10,000. Stornoway is an important port and the major town and administrative centre of the Outer Hebrides. It is home to Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (the Western Isles Council) and a variety of educational, sporting and media establishments. Until relatively recently, observance of the Christian Sabbath (Sunday) has been associated with Hebridean culture. Recent changes mean that Sundays on Lewis now more closely resemble those on the other Western Isles or on mainland Scotland. ==History== The town was founded by Vikings in the early 9th century, with the Old Norse name Stj√≥rnav√°gr. The settlement grew up around a sheltered natural harbour near the centre of the island; people travelled to Stornoway from all over the island, either by family boat or by horse-drawn coach, for onward travel to and trade with the rest of Scotland and further afield. At some point in the mid 1500s, the already ancient MacLeod castle in Stornoway 'fell victim to the cannons of the Duke of Argyle'. By the early 1600s rumbling trade wars came to a head, and all further government attempts to curtail traditional shipping rights were firmly resisted by the islanders, as was an attempt by James VI, King of Scotland, to establish on the island the Scottish trading company known as the Fife Adventurers around 1598. As a result, James VI transferred Lewis to the MacKenzies of Seaforth in 1610. In 1844, the MacKenzies sold Stornoway, and the Isle of Lewis as a whole, to Sir James Matheson (and his descendants) who built the present Lews Castle on a hill overlooking the bay of Stornoway. Fragmentary ruins of the old Stornoway Castle had survived in the bay until that time, and can even be seen in Victorian photographs,http://www.stravaiging.com/photos/albums/buildings/castles/Stornoway%20Castle,%20Ross%20and%20Cromarty/StornowayCastle- StornowayLibrary.jpg but Matheson destroyed them in 1882, in order to expand the harbour; a few remains of Stornoway Castle still remain, hidden beneath pier number 1, close to the shore, slightly west of centre. In 1918, Matheson sold the island to William Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme. Lord Leverhulme held the island for a short time. His economic plans for the island (together with various business setbacks) overstretched his finances. Faced with failure in Lewis, he gave Stornoway parish to the people of the town. The Stornoway Trust was formed and continues to administer the parish for the people. ==Harbour and maritime industry== Panorama of Stornoway Harbour area from Arnish PointToday the harbour hosts a fishing fleet (and associated shoreside services) somewhat reduced from its heyday, a small marina and moorings for pleasure craft, a small shipyard and slipway, three larger piers for commercial traffic and Stornoway Lifeboat Station, run by the RNLI and home to a , Tom Sanderson. Her Majesty's Coastguard operates a Maritime Rescue Sub Centre from a building near the harbour. A lighthouse, seaweed processing plant and a renewable energy manufacturing yard are situated on Arnish Point at the mouth of the harbour and visually dominate the approaches. Arnish Point is also earmarked by AMEC as the landfall for its proposed private sub-sea cable which would export the electricity generated from the Lewis Windpower wind farm with a planning application for 181 turbines submitted to the Scottish Executive. In 2008 the Scottish Government rejected the plans - the company responsible is currently planning their next move. The Arnish area was also surveyed by SSE for a second sub-sea cable but lost out in favour of Gravir to the south as the preferred site. SSE prefers Arnish Point as of 2016. The manufacturing yard was originally established in the 1970s as a fabrication plant for the oil industry but suffered regular boom and bust cycles. The downturn in business from the North Sea oil industry in recent years led to a move away from serving this market. The yard is now earmarked as a key business in the development of the whole Arnish Point industrial estate and has received large amounts of funding in recent years. In 2007 the Arnish yard was taken over by its third tenant in as many years. Cambrian Engineering fell into liquidation as did Aberdeen-owned Camcal Ltd with relatively large-scale redundancies. Both firms were affected by the absence of a regular stream of orders and left a chain of large debts impacting upon local suppliers. Altissimo Ltd is a new firm backed by a group of Swiss and Dutch investors, and has purchased the Camcal name from the previous operator. In December 2007, the yard won a contract to construct 49 towers for wind turbines in Turkey. This will ensure employment for around 70 employees for over six months. On 1 January 1919, the Iolaire sank at the entrance of the harbour, one of the worst maritime disasters in Scottish or UK waters, with a death toll of 205 men, who were returning home from World War I. ==Climate== Like much of the British Isles, Stornoway has an oceanic climate, with relatively little variation of temperature and damp conditions throughout the year.. Winters are exceptionally mild for such a northerly location; average nighttime low temperatures in January and February, the coldest months, are above , while daytime high temperatures average about . Summers are cool, due to influence from the Atlantic Ocean; average daytime high temperatures in July and August are just over . Precipitation falls mostly as rain (though snow occasionally falls in winter), and October through January are the wettest months due to frequent, sometimes intense storms from the North Atlantic, which can bring heavy rain and high winds. April through July represents a markedly drier season, when storm frequency and intensity diminish markedly. June is the driest month in Stornoway, averaging at of precipitation, while January is the wettest month, averaging at . ==Transport== MV Loch Seaforth Stornoway Airport The Caledonian MacBrayne- operated ferry has been sailing since 2015, from Stornoway harbour to Ullapool on the Scottish mainland, taking 2 hours 30 minutes. There are an average of two return crossings a day: more in summer than in winter. The former main ship on the route, (1995), used to carry the freight crossing, however she has now been reassigned elsewhere by CalMac. This means that MV Loch Seaforth is often heavily congested, particularly during the summer months. The idea of an undersea tunnel linking Lewis and Harris to the Scottish mainland was raised in early 2007. One of the possible routes, between Stornoway and Ullapool, would be over long: the longest road tunnel in the world. Stornoway is the hub of bus routes in Lewis: buses run to Point, Ness, Back and Tolsta, Uig, the West Side, Lochs and Tarbert, Harris. These buses are provided by the Comhairle and several private operators as well as some community-run organisations. Stornoway Airport is located next to the village of Melbost, east of the town; there are flights to Benbecula, Edinburgh, Inverness and Glasgow, operated by Loganair and Flybe franchisee Eastern Airways. The airport is also the base of an HM Coastguard Search & Rescue Sikorsky S-92 helicopter, and was previously home to RAF Stornoway. In 1898, the Hebridean Light Railway Company was proposed, with a terminus at Stornoway, but the line was never constructed. Cruise ships visit the town and anchor in the bay, with passengers coming ashore on tenders. == Education == Boats in Stornoway harbour Stornoway is home to the Nicolson Institute: founded in 1873, it is the largest school in the Western Isles and the only secondary school in Lewis providing a six-year course. It has a roll of around 1,000 pupils. After a two-year rebuilding project costing ¬£29 million, the new school building was formally opened in October 2012. Primary education in Stornoway is in Stornoway Primary School, which opened in August 1969. The school is on Jamieson Drive and has around 400 pupils. The head teacher is Annette Murray. There is a further education college, Lews Castle College, which was founded in 1953 and is now part of the University of the Highlands and Islands. It runs over 140 courses and has around 2700 students. There is also a small campus of the University of Stirling in Stornoway, teaching nursing, based in the Western Isles Hospital. It provides undergraduate degree programmes for adult nursing and supports postgraduate students, who can choose from various higher level courses. ==Sport== Football is the most popular amateur sport and Goathill Park in the town hosts special matches involving select teams and visiting clubs and other organisations. Two local teams currently participate in the Lewis and Harris Football League: Stornoway Athletic (Aths) and Stornoway United. Until the early 1990s there was also Stornoway Rovers. Stornoway United FC usually win the Manor Dairy Football Competition. Shinty is not as popular as in the rest of the West of Scotland, but the Lewis Camanachd team is based around the town. Rugby Union is also popular, and Stornoway RFC competes regularly in national leagues and cups. The town also has a very popular gymnastics group which competes annually in sports festivals. The Lews Castle Grounds is the home of Stornoway Golf Club (the only 18-hole golf course in the Outer Hebrides). Very near to the Nicolson Institute is the Lewis Sports Centre (Ionad Spors Le√≤dhas), which has a sports hall, fitness suite, climbing wall, swimming pool and various other facilities. It has a running track and an AstroTurf Football pitch. There is also the Stornoway Karate Club, a member of the International Japan Karate Association. == Culture and media == According to the 2011 Census, there are 5,492 Scottish Gaelic speakers (43%) in the greater Stornoway area. The annual Hebridean Celtic Festival is a 4-day community-led festival which attracts over 10,000 visitors during July of each year. The Royal National M√≤d has been held in Stornoway on a number of occasions, most recently in 2005, 2011 and 2016. Large influxes of visitors such as for these events can strain the town's accommodation capacity. Stornoway is a sister town of Pendleton, in Anderson County, South Carolina, United States. === Broadcasting === The radio station Isles FM is based in Stornoway and broadcasts on 103FM, featuring a mixture of Gaelic and English programming. It is also home to a studio operated by BBC Radio nan G√†idheal. The Gaelic-language public service broadcaster BBC Alba launched on 19 September 2008, is based in Stornoway. === Stornoway Public Library === Stornoway Library operates a five-day opening service from Tuesday to Saturday, with a late night opening on Thursday evenings. The library offers book borrowing services as well as free access to wifi and computer access to the internet. As part of its collections, the library offers access to a wide range of Gaelic materials, with a large collection of books and periodicals such as Gairm, Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness, Scottish Gaelic Studies and Guth, as well as out of print publications An Gaidheal and Guth na Bliadhna. In their newspaper section, the library holds copies of Alba and Mac-Talla as well as Sruth, Scotland's only bilingual newspaper from the 1960s. Through the library membership, it is also possible to access An St√≤r-d√†ta Stuthan G√†idhlig, a database of Gaelic educational resources. Stornoway Library also holds an extensive local studies collection for research purposes. As part of those collections, the library holds an archive of local newspaper back editions including the Stornoway Gazette from 1917, the Highland News from 1883, the West Highland Free Press from 1972, the Oban Times from 1861, the Inverness Courier from 1817, the Inverness Advertiser from 1849 and the Inverness Courier and Advertiser from 1885. Other resources include a collection of ordnance survey maps and admiralty charts for the local area, old parochial registers, 19th century census returns, minutes of the former Stornoway Town Council as well as current Comhairle nan Eilean Siar and school log books. The library also holds the Seaforth Muniments (Seaforth Estate Papers), local croft histories and rental and valuation rolls dated as far back as the 18th century. In 2018, Stornoway Library announced plans to transform their coffee shop into a makerspace available to the general public where they run educational activities on topics including 3D printing and virtual reality. ===Newspapers=== The main local newspapers for the Western Isles are the Stornoway Gazette, Am Paipear and Events. == Food and drink == Stornoway black pudding is a gourmet black pudding, and was granted PGI status in 2013 by the European Commission to prevent inferior puddings produced elsewhere being marketed as \\"Stornoway\\" or \\"Stornoway Style\\". Stornoway kippers and Stornoway smoked salmon are produced in town. They have one of the last working brick kilns in the UK, at the establishment of Stornoway Fish Smokers, Shell Street. The Hebridean Brewing Company produces cask ale and filtered beer in bottles.Online Travel guide retrieved 1 September 2007 ==Notable buildings== Lews Castle in StornowayNotable buildings in Stornoway include: * Stornoway Town Hall * The Lewis War Memorial * The neo-Gothic Lews Castle * Lewis Loom Centre ==Stornoway in popular media and culture== Houses in Stornoway as seen from a ferry Stornoway became immortalised in the song \\"Lovely Stornoway\\" by Calum Kennedy and Bob Halfin, the song has recently been covered in by Hebridean rock band Peat and Diesel. The 4AD Records folk-rock band Stornoway took their name from the town, after seeing it on the BBC weather report. They signed their record deal outside the Woodlands Centre in Lews Castle Grounds, Stornoway, after performing in the town for the first time in April 2010. Their second concert there was as headliners on the main stage of the Hebridean Celtic Festival on 13 July 2011. \\"Stornoway\\" is the name of the official residence of the Leader of the Opposition in Canada's Parliament. It was given the name by its second occupants, the Perley-Robertsons, after the ancestral home of the Perley family. The novel The Stornoway Way by Lewisman Kevin MacNeil is largely set in Stornoway. RAF Stornoway is featured in the Tom Clancy novel Red Storm Rising as a base for Allied air operations over the North Atlantic and against Soviet-held Iceland. Stornoway features heavily in the initial stages of the X-Men comics Dark Phoenix Saga due to its proximity to the fictional Muir Island and Proteus' attempts to find a new host body. In the motion picture Latitude Zero by Toho Productions (1969), Stornoway Harbour is featured on a wall plaque as the construction site of the submarine \\"Alpha\\". In 2007 the British car manufacturer Land Rover introduced Stornoway Grey as a colour choice for its vehicle line-up. In response, Stornoway's councillor Angus Nicolson appealed to Land Rover to relabel the colour as Silvery Stornoway, fearing that the association of grey with dull and boring would hurt the image of the town with tourists; Mr Nicolson said: \\"This is deeply insulting and is offensive, inaccurate and inherently degrading. This will hit tourism as it subliminally implants adverse connotations in the minds of those who have never experienced the reality of these beautiful islands.\\" Land Rover replied that the colour in question is one of the most popular ones and the use of Stornoway in its name will instead \\"keep it on the map\\". In 2011 Scottish author Peter May published The Blackhouse, the first of The Lewis Trilogy of thrillers based on Lewis, where the primary police murder investigation is based in Stornoway. == Religion == Stornoway has several churches of various Christian and non Christian denominations. In May 2018, the first mosque of the Western Isles opened to serve a small Muslim population. ==Travel== There are daily ferry routes between Ullapool and Stornoway. It was not until July 2009 that Caledonian MacBrayne began to operate Sunday sailings from Stornoway. There are flights leaving from Stornoway Airport daily to Inverness, Edinburgh and Glasgow. Additionally, seasonal routes to Barra, Manchester and London Southend are available also. Despite a large number of offshore oil workers living in Stornoway, there is no longer a direct Stornoway to Aberdeen route. == Notable people == *Astrid (band), band from the Western Isles *Peat and Diesel, band from the Western Isles *Calum Kennedy, singer and entertainer *Sheilagh M.

He was a 1951 alumnus of the University of Portland, where he studied engineering. ==Early life== He was born in Yakima, Washington on January 19, 1920. His family was homesteaders, and followed the fruit harvest; he joined his brothers at harvest time through the years of the Great Depression, but quickly learned that his interest and skill were in ‚Äúfixing things‚Äù on the farm. He said that ‚ÄúI liked machines. I liked the way they are ideas that get built.‚Äú Shiley attended Oregon State University, the Land-grant university in Oregon, on a scholarship, but left to join the Navy for service in World War II. After the war, he enrolled at the University of Portland, a private Roman Catholic institution, using the G.I. Bill benefits to study engineering and chemistry. In 1951, he graduated first in his class. ==Career== Shiley began working at Edwards Laboratories, located in Orange County, California, south of Los Angeles, the first manufacturer of artificial heart-valves. Later he established his own company, Shiley Laboratories, in the same area. His first valve was developed together with the American heart-surgeon Kay, and was the first disc heart-valve. Compared with the Edwards valve, which had the shape of a little ball, the disc valve needed much less space within the heart when implanted. Some years later, Shiley improved his design in cooperation with Swedish heart surgeon Viking Bj√∂rk, which led to the first tilting disc heart-valve, resulting in a much better flow of blood through the valve. Shiley Labs developed and manufactured other products, especially tracheal and endotracheal tubes for respiration after surgery in the mouth or throat, and during anesthesia. The Bj√∂rk‚ÄìShiley heart valve underwent several improvements in the following years, primarily in the degree of opening of the disc, thus reducing turbulence in the bloodstream. Some years later, Shiley decided to sell his company to Pfizer, and retired. ==Personal life== Shiley was married twice: to Pat, the mother of his four children and who died in middle-age; and to Darlene Marcos, who survived him. ==Death== Donald Shiley died on July 31, 2010, after deteriorating health. He is survived by his wife, Darlene Marcos, and four children and five grandchildren ==Legacy== In March 2007, Shiley and Darlene donated $12 million to the University of Portland, for renovating the University's School of Engineering. The grant was the largest the university had ever received. He also provided a donation to the University of San Diego for the Donald P. Shiley Center for Science and Technology. In 2012, Darlene Shiley donated $1 million to MASTERPIECE Trust, the PBS fund which supports the \\"Masterpiece\\" program series, when the Downton Abbey series brought increased interest in Masterpiece and the fund had lost a major donor. ==References== Category:American engineers Category:University of Portland alumni Category:2010 deaths Category:1920 births ","title":"Donald Shiley"},{"id":"522592","text":"Darbar may refer to: * Durbar (court), a term for a court in Urdu from the Persian * Darbar (Raga), a musical scale/mode of South Indian classical music (Carnatic music) * Darbar Sahib (disambiguation) * Darbar (title) or Darbar Saheb is a title of honor used in India * Darbar, Iran (disambiguation), places in Iran * Darbar (film), a 2020 Indian Tamil-language action film ","title":"Darbar"},{"id":"522604","text":"The Transverse Ranges are a group of mountain ranges of southern California, in the Pacific Coast Ranges physiographic region in North America. The Transverse Ranges begin at the southern end of the California Coast Ranges and lie within Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside and Kern counties. The Peninsular Ranges lie to the south. The name Transverse Ranges is due to their east‚Äìwest orientation, making them transverse to the general northwest‚Äìsoutheast orientation of most of California's coastal mountains.Dibblee Jr, T.W., 1982. Regional geology of the Transverse Ranges Province of southern California. Geology and mineral wealth of the California Transverse Ranges, 10, pp.7-26. The ranges extend from west of Point Conception eastward approximately 500 kilometers into the Mojave and Colorado Desert. The geology and topography of the ranges express three distinct segments that have contrasting elevations, rock types, and vegetation. The western segment extends to the San Gabriel Mountains and San Gabriel fault. The central segment includes mountains that range eastward to the San Andreas fault. The eastern segment extends from the San Andreas fault eastward to the Colorado Desert. The central and eastern segments (near the San Andreas fault) have the highest elevations. Most of the ranges lie in the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion. Lower elevations are dominated by chaparral and scrubland, while higher elevations support large conifer forests. Most of the ranges in the system are fault blocks, and were uplifted by tectonic movements late in the Cenozoic Era. West of Tejon Pass, the primary rock types are varied, with a mix of sedimentary, volcanic, and metamorphic rocks, while regions east of the pass are dominated by plutonic granitic and metasedimentary rocks. ==Geography== left Snowy Mt. Baden-Powell in the San Gabriel Mountains The western and central segments of the Transverse Ranges are bounded to the north and east by the San Andreas Fault, which separates those segments from the Mojave Desert. The eastern segment bounds the southern Mojave Desert. Notable passes along the San Andreas fault include Tejon Pass, Cajon Pass, and San Gorgonio Pass. Components of Transverse Ranges to the north and east of the fault include the San Bernardino Mountains, Little San Bernardino Mountains, Pinto and Eagle Mountains. The western and southern boundaries are acknowledged to be the Pacific Ocean and the northern Channel Islands. Onshore the Los Angeles Basin lies at the southern boundary of the western and central segments of the ranges. Major passes not along the San Andreas Fault include Gaviota Pass, San Marcos Pass, the Conejo Grade, Newhall Pass, and Cahuenga Pass. The Transverse Ranges manifest themselves as a series of roughly parallel ridges with an average height of . The ranges are dissected by young, steep streams of relatively low flow rate; as a result, there is high topographic relief throughout the range, and other than in marginal areas (e.g. the San Fernando Valley) and a few river valleys (such as Lockwood Valley and Big Bear Valley), there are no large, flat basins within the ranges. The mountains are notable for being steep and difficult to traverse. There are few passes that are sufficiently low or wide enough to accommodate significant volumes of traffic. This has resulted in situations where major cities are linked to the rest of the state by relatively few roads; for example, the vast majority of traffic between the Central Valley and the Los Angeles area is routed through Tejon Pass. This results in significant traffic issues throughout Southern California when a pass has to be shut down due to heavy snow or construction. Occasionally, major cities, such as Santa Barbara during the 2005 La Conchita landslide, may be cut off from timely road access to the rest of Southern California. === Peaks === Major peaks of the Transverse Ranges with at least of prominence, listed by height: === Ranges ===  Western Segment  This segment begins at Point Conception in Santa Barbara County, and include the Santa Ynez Mountains that run parallel to the coast behind Santa Barbara. The western Transverse Ranges also include the Topatopa Mountains and the Santa Susana Mountains of Ventura County and Los Angeles County, the Simi Hills, the Santa Monica Mountains that run along the Pacific coast behind Malibu, and whose eastern portion are known as the Hollywood Hills, and the Chalk Hills. The northern Channel Islands of California are also part of the Transverse Ranges; San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz and Anacapa Islands are a westward extension of the Santa Monica Mountains.  Central Segment  The Ranges include the steep San Gabriel Mountains northeast of Los Angeles, the Tehachapi Mountains southeast of Bakersfield, the Verdugo Mountains, the Liebre-Sawmill Mountains, the San Rafael Hills, Puente Hills, San Jose Hills, and Chino Hills.  Eastern Segment  The San Bernardino Mountains, Little San Bernardino Mountains, and the Pinto, Eagle, and Orocopia Mountains are within the eastern segment. The Mojave Desert and California's low desert, including the Coachella Valley, are at the eastern end of the ranges. Ranges north of the western segment that are nearly transverse but are part of the California Coast Ranges include the San Rafael Mountains and the Sierra Madre Mountains. Likewise, the Tehachapi Mountains north of the Mojave Desert, although nearly transverse, are the southern end of the Sierra Nevada. Mountain ranges with peaks exceeding , listed west to east, include: *Santa Ynez Mountains *Pine Mountain Ridge *San Emigdio Mountains *Topatopa Mountains *Sierra Pelona Mountains *San Gabriel Mountains *San Bernardino Mountains *Little San Bernardino Mountains Examples of smaller mountain and hill ranges include: *Santa Monica Mountains *Santa Susana Mountains *Simi Hills *Chalk Hills *San Rafael Hills *Puente Hills *San Jose Hills *Shandin Hills ===Climate=== The climate in most of the range is Csb (Warm-summer Mediterranean) under the K√∂ppen climate classification; the upper reaches of San Gorgonio Mountain have an alpine tundra climate (ET), while the lower northern slopes of the range have a desert (BW) or steppe (BS) climate; most of the nearby lowlands to the south and west have a Hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa).Redlands Biology Snow falls above most winters, and above every few years. It is rare for elevations above to go multiple winters without snow, even during severe droughts. Due to relatively low humidity, the regional snow line lies at about , above the highest elevation of the range; as such, snow does not persist year-round except in the form of snow patches. The tree line lies at about ; San Gorgonio Mountain is the only peak with an alpine environment. ==Geology== View west of the eastern portion of the San Bernardino and San Gabriel Mountains, with the Mojave Desert on the right and Silverwood Lake near the boundary. The San Andreas Fault runs straight up the middle toward the horizon. The San Andreas Fault trends more east-west where it cuts through the Transverse Ranges. ===Tectonics=== The Transverse Ranges result from a complex of tectonic forces and faulting stemming from the interaction of the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate along the dextral (right slip) San Andreas Fault system. Their orientation along an east‚Äìwest axis as opposed to the general northwest‚Äìsoutheast trend of most California ranges results from a pronounced left step in the San Andreas Fault that occurred in Pliocene time ( million years ago) when southern reaches of the fault moved east to open the Gulf of California. The crust within the Pacific Plate south of the ranges can not easily make the left turn westward as the entire plate moves northwestward, forcing pieces of the crust to compress and lift. Prior to this shift of the fault to create the left bend, northwest‚Äìsoutheast trending rock belts in all of the Transverse Ranges began to rotate clockwise in the right shear of Pacific Plate ‚Äì North American Plate motion. This tectonic rotation began in Early Miocene Time and continues today. The total rotation is about 90¬∞ in the Western Transverse Ranges and less (about 40¬∞) in the eastern ranges. Catalina Island shows the most rotation: almost 120¬∞. A mechanism proposed for the rotation event is capture of the subducting Monterey plate by the outboard Pacific plate. Because the Monterey plate was then beneath southern California, the capture resulted in pulling of the overlying crust out and northward from the rest of California. ===Rocks=== Rocks of the Transverse Ranges exhibit extreme differences in geologic age and composition, varying from sedimentary rocks in the western Santa Ynez and volcanic rocks in the Santa Monica Mountains to primarily granitic and metamorphic rock in the central and eastern segments, including the San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mountains. The oldest basement (deepest) rocks are of Proterozoic age, and are found in the San Gabriel Mountains and the San Bernardino Mountains. The Jurassic-Cretaceous Franciscan Assemblage is found in the western section of the ranges and is the presumed basement in this segment. Exposed plutonic rocks from the Mesozoic, mostly granites, can be found on Mount Pinos and generally in regions east of Tejon Pass. The youngest rocks are Cenozoic sedimentary and volcanic rocks that can be found throughout the ranges. The western segment is distinctive for the large thickness of Cretaceous and Cenozoic sedimentary rocks, estimated to be up to 10 kilometers. The thickest deposits of these are in the Santa Barbara Channel and Ventura basin. These are mostly marine in origin with a marked change to red beds of river systems of Oligocene age in the western and central segments. Limestones and dolomites of the marine Miocene Monterey Formation are found in the Santa Ynez Mountains and in the Coast Ranges to the north. ===Faults=== leftThe distinctive feature of the Transverse Ranges besides their anomalous orientation is that they are bounded by east-west trending faults. Most are left slip, strike slip faults. In the western and central segments many of the faults are thrust faults. Faults in the Coast Ranges and Peninsular Ranges trend northwest-southeast and butt into the east-west trending faults of the Transverse Ranges. Because all of these faults are considered active and seismic but they do to cut each other, the only geometry that satisfies that observation is if the east-west faults and Transverse Ranges are rotating clockwise with respect to the faults outside that province. Between the western segment and the Peninsular Ranges to the south is the complex Malibu Coast‚ÄîSanta Monica‚ÄîHollywood fault, which exists as the border between these two mostly geologically unitary provinces. These faults are part of the same thrust fault system south of the northern Channel Islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and Anacapa Islands. North of the western segment the bounding faults are left slip Santa Ynez and Pine Mountain Faults. The San Gabriel Fault and San Andreas bound the central segment. The eastern segment is bounded by the Pinto Mountain Fault in the north and the Salton Creek Fault in the south. ===Petroleum=== The large thickness of marine sediments in the western segment have made it a habit for oil. Several dozen fields are found onshore and offshore, particularly in the Santa Barbara Channel and Ventura Basin. Much oil has pooled in the Monterey Formation, which is produced onshore and offshore. In the eastern Santa Barbara Channel oil is held in younger sedimentary rocks. The Los Angeles Basin south of the western segment, formed during rotation of that segment away from the Peninsular Ranges. It is also a site of prolific oil production. The California Geologic Survey states: > Great thicknesses of Cenozoic petroleum-rich sedimentary rocks have been > folded and faulted, making California one of the most important oil- > producing areas in the United States.‚Äò‚ÄôCalifornia Geologic Provinces,‚Äô‚Äô Note > 36, page 2 ==Ecology== Savannah-like oak woodlands are typical of the westernmost ranges; shown here is the north slope of the Santa Ynez Mountains The plant place of the Transverse ranges include coastal sage scrub, oak woodland and savanna, and pinyon-juniper woodland at lower elevations, and yellow pine forest, Lodgepole Pine, and subalpine forest at higher elevations.Schoenherr, Allan A. (1992). A Natural History of California. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press. The Angeles and Los Padres National Forests cover portions of the Transverse ranges. The ranges are part of the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion, but the eastern points of the range touch two desert regions, the Mojave Desert and the Colorado Desert section of the Sonoran Desert. The Carrizo Plain adjoins the northern edge of the Transverse Range. Chaparral is a common feature of the Transverse Ranges. Common plant associates in chaparral, especially in the transition between coastal chaparral and coastal sage scrub, include California sagebrush and Toyon, the latter shrub having its southern distribution limit defined by the Transverse Ranges.C. Michael Hogan, (2008) Toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia), GlobalTwitcher, ed. N. Stromberg Pinyon-juniper woodland is common on the north slopes of the San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mountains. This ecosystem is easily visible in the well-travelled Soledad Pass region, between Pearblossom and Santa Clarita. ===Urban impact=== A number of densely populated coastal plains and interior valleys lie between the mountain ranges, including the Oxnard Plain of coastal Ventura County, the Santa Clarita Valley north of Los Angeles, the San Fernando Valley, which is mostly included in the City of Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Basin, which includes the portion of Los Angeles County south of the Santa Monica Mountains and most of Orange County, and the Inland Empire basin, which includes the cities of San Bernardino and Riverside, lie between the Transverse Ranges and the Peninsular Ranges to the south. ==Transportation== View looking westward at the western portion of the San Bernardino and San Gabriel Mountains, with the San Bernardino Valley to the left, with San Bernardino itself in the foreground. The Foothill Freeway (I-210) runs toward the horizon, while I-15 runs through Cajon Pass to the right. There are a number of important freeways that cross the Transverse Ranges, such as (from west to east) US-101, I-5 at Tejon Pass, SR 14 at Soledad Pass, and I-15 at Cajon Pass. These highways link Southern California with places to the north and northeast like San Francisco and Las Vegas, respectively. With the exception of several high passes on less-traveled SR 33, SR 2, SR 330. SR 18 and SR 38, none of these passes are at high elevations, with Cajon Pass being at a modest 4,190 ft (1,277 m) above mean sea level; this means that snow is less of a factor here than in the moderate to high mountain passes to the north like Donner Pass. Still sometimes, heavy snowfall can snarl traffic on Tejon and Cajon Pass, the higher two of the three freeway passes. I-5 and I-15 commonly experience heavy traffic over their mountainous route across these mountains. ==See also== *Southern California faults *Transverse Ranges topics index ==References== ==Further reading== * *Minor, S.A., Kellogg, K.S., Stanley, R.G., Gurrola, L.D., Keller, E.A. and Brandt, T.R., 2009.

The term is not often used for churches. Contrary to the American usage of the term, it is characterised by strongly bilateral symmetry, with an Italianate or Palladian- derived pediment on the front formal elevation. It often uses a contrast in colour between carefully chosen red brick for the walls, with details in a lighter stone that are often rather richly carved. Christopher Wren used this style, which achieved a rich effect for a considerably lower cost than using stone as a facing throughout, in his rebuilding of Hampton Court Palace, commissioned by William and Mary. Here it harmonized well with the remaining Tudor parts of the palace. This highly visible example probably influenced many others. The architectural historian Marcus Binney, writing in The Times in 2006, describes Poulton House in Poulton, Wiltshire (built in 1706, during the reign of Queen Anne)Poulton House as \\"...Queen Anne at its most delightful\\". Binney lists what he describes as the typical features of the Queen Anne style:The Times, \\"Bricks and Mortar\\" Supplement, 5 May 2006, pp.6-7. * a sweep of steps leading to a carved stone door-case * rows of painted sash windows in boxes set flush with the brickwork * stone quoins emphasizing corners * a central triangular pediment set against a hipped roof with dormers * typically box-like \\"double pile\\" plans, two rooms deep When used of revived \\"Queen Anne style\\" of the 19th and 20th centuries, the historic reference in the name should not be taken at all literally, as buildings said to be in the \\"Queen Anne style\\" in other parts of the English- speaking world normally bear even less resemblance to English buildings of the early 18th century as those of any style of revival architecture to the original. In particular, Queen Anne style architecture in the United States is a wholly different style, as is that in Australia, and normally includes no elements very typical of the actual architecture of Queen Anne's reign, the names having been devised for marketing purposes. ==British 19th-century Queen Anne style== County Hall, Wakefield, designed by architects James Gibson and Samuel Russell in 1894 George Devey (1820‚Äì1886) and the better-known Norman Shaw (1831‚Äì1912) popularized the Queen Anne style of British architecture of the industrial age in the 1870s. Norman Shaw published a book of architectural sketches as early as 1858, and his evocative pen-and-ink drawings began to appear in trade journals and artistic magazines in the 1870s. (American commercial builders quickly adopted the style.) Shaw's eclectic designs often included Tudor elements, and this \\"Old English\\" style also became popular in the United States, where it became known (inaccurately) as the Queen Anne style. Confusion between buildings constructed during the reign of Queen Anne and the \\"Queen Anne\\" style still persists, especially in England. In the late 1850s, the name \\"Queen Anne\\" was in the air, following publication in 1852 of William Makepeace Thackeray's novel, The History of Henry Esmond, Esq., A Colonel in the Service of Her Majesty Queen Anne. One minor side-effect of Thackeray's novel and of Norman Shaw's freehand picturesque vernacular Renaissance survives to this day. When, in the early 1870s, Chinese-inspired Early Georgian furniture on cabriole legs, featuring smooth expanses of walnut and chairs with flowing lines and slat backs, began to be looked for in out- of-the-way curio shops (Macquoid 1904), the style was mis-attributed to the reign of Queen Anne, and the \\"Queen Anne\\" misnomer has stuck to this day, in American as well as English furniture-style designations (see Queen Anne style furniture). Even the most stylish and up-to-date furnishings of the historical reign of Queen Anne, as inventories reveal, used a style that 21st-century connoisseurs would immediately identify as \\"William and Mary\\". The British Victorian version of the style empathises more closely with the Arts and Crafts movement than does its American counterpart. A good example is Severalls Hospital in Colchester, Essex (1913‚Äì1997), now defunct. The historic precedents of the Queen Anne style were broad: * fine brickwork, often in a warmer, softer finish than the Victorians characteristically used, varied with terracotta panels, or tile-hung upper stories, with crisply-painted white woodwork, or blond limestone detailing * oriel windows, often stacked one above another * corner towers * asymmetrical fronts and picturesque massing * Flemish mannerist sunken panels of strapwork * deeply shadowed entrances * broad porches * overall, a domesticated free Renaissance style When an open architectural competition took place in 1892 for a county hall to be built in Wakefield, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the instructions to competitors noted that \\"the style of architecture will be left to the competitors but the Queen Anne or Renaissance School of Architecture appears suited to an old town like Wakefield\\".County Council Records, 11 January 1893; Papers Building of County Hall The executed design, by architects James Gibson and Samuel Russell of London, combines a corner turret, grandly domed and with gargoyles at the angles, freely combined with Flemish Renaissance stepped gables. In the 20th century, Edwin Lutyens and others used an elegant version of the style, usually with red-brick walls contrasting with pale stone details. ==Queen Anne Revival in other countries== The Carson Mansion, located in Eureka, California, is widely considered to be one of the most extreme examples of American Queen Anne style. ===American Queen Anne style=== House in the Old West End District (Toledo, Ohio), a district with many more simple examples In the United States, the so-called \\"Queen Anne style\\" is loosely used of a wide range of picturesque buildings with \\"free Renaissance\\" (non-Gothic Revival architecture) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right. \\"Queen Anne\\", as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less \\"domestic\\" Beaux-Arts architecture, is broadly applied to architecture, furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910; some \\"Queen Anne\\" architectural elements, such as the wraparound front porch, continued to be found into the 1920s. The gabled and domestically scaled \\"Queen Anne\\" style arrived in New York City with the new housing for the New York House and School of Industry Sidney V. Stratton, architect, 1878). Distinctive features of American Queen Anne style (rooted in the English style) may include an asymmetrical fa√ßade; dominant front-facing gable, often cantilevered out beyond the plane of the wall below; overhanging eaves; round, square, or polygonal tower(s); shaped and Dutch gables; a porch covering part or all of the front facade, including the primary entrance area; a second- story porch or balconies; pedimented porches; differing wall textures, such as patterned wood shingles shaped into varying designs, including resembling fish scales, terra cotta tiles, relief panels, or wooden shingles over brickwork, etc.; dentils; classical columns; spindle work; oriel and bay windows; horizontal bands of leaded windows; monumental chimneys; painted balustrades; and wooden or slate roofs. Front gardens often had wooden fences. ===Australian Queen Anne style=== APA Building in Melbourne, circa 1900. It was Australia's tallest building from its completion in 1889 to 1912 and was demolished in 1980. In Australia, the Queen Anne style was absorbed into the Federation style, which was, broadly speaking, the Australian equivalent of the Edwardian style, derived from the influence of Richard Norman Shaw,A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, Apperly (Angus and Robertson) 1994, p.132 an influential British architect of the late Victorian era. The Federation period went from 1890 to 1915 and included twelve styles, one of which was the Federation Queen Anne. This became the most popular style for houses built between 1890 and 1910.A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, p.132 The style often utilised Tudor-style woodwork and elaborate fretwork that replaced the Victorian taste for wrought iron. Verandahs were usually a feature, as were the image of the rising sun and Australian wildlife; plus circular windows, turrets and towers with conical or pyramid-shaped roofs. Appian Way in the Sydney suburb of Burwood South Yarra, Victoria. The first Queen Anne house in Australia was Caerleon in the suburb of Bellevue Hill, New South Wales.The Federation House, Hugh Fraser (New Holland) 2002, p.24 Caerleon was designed initially by a Sydney architect, Harry Kent, but was then substantially reworked in London by Maurice Adams.Sydney Architecture, Graham Jahn (Watermark Press) 1997, p.62 This led to some controversy over who deserved the credit. The house was built in 1885 and was the precursor for the Federation Queen Anne house that was to become so popular. The APA Building in the Melbourne city centre was an example of the Queen Anne style being used for non-residential purposes, though at some stage the building may have been apartments. It was demolished in 1981 after the modernism boom in Melbourne took off‚Äìfactors that sealed its demolition included rapacious development, lax heritage attitudes in Australian cities, and the owner's own decision to argue for a demolition permit which was granted. Caerleon was followed soon after by West Maling, in the suburb of Penshurst, New South Wales,Heritage branch  NSW Environment & Heritage and Annesbury, in the suburb of Ashfield, New South Wales, both built circa 1888. These houses, although built around the same time, had distinct styles, West Maling displaying a robust Tudor influence that was not present in Annesbury. The style soon became increasingly popular, appealing predominantly to reasonably well-off people with an \\"Establishment\\" leaning.The Federation House, p.22 The style as it developed in Australia was highly eclectic, blending Queen Anne elements with various Australian influences. Old English characteristics like ribbed chimneys and gabled roofs were combined with Australian aspects like encircling verandahs, designed to keep the sun out. One outstanding example of this eclectic approach is Urrbrae House, in the Adelaide suburb of Urrbrae, South Australia, part of the Waite Institute. Another variation with connections to the Federation Queen Anne style was the Federation Bungalow, featuring extended verandahs. This style generally incorporated familiar Queen Anne elements, but usually in simplified form.

It is bounded by the Absaroka Range on the west, the Pryor Mountains on the north, the Bighorn Mountains on the east, and the Owl Creek Mountains and Bridger Mountains on the south. It is drained to the north by tributaries of the Bighorn River, which enters the basin from the south, through a gap between the Owl Creek and Bridger Mountains, as the Wind River, and becomes the Bighorn as it enters the basin. The region is semi-arid, receiving only 6‚Äì10 in (15‚Äì25 cm) of rain annually. The largest cities in the basin include the Wyoming towns of Cody, Thermopolis, Worland, and Powell. Sugar beets, pinto beans, sunflowers, barley, oats, corn and alfalfa hay are grown on irrigated farms in the region. ==History== The basin was explored by John Colter in 1807. Just west of Cody, he discovered geothermal features that were later popularly called \\"Colter's Hell\\". The region was later transversed by the Bridger Trail, which was blazed in 1864 by Jim Bridger to connect the Oregon Trail to the south with Montana. The route was an important alternative to the Bozeman Trail, which had crossed the Powder River Country, but had been closed to white settlers following Red Cloud's War. Around the turn of the 20th century the Bighorn Basin was settled by ranchers such as William \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody who founded the town of Cody and owned a great deal of land surrounding the Shoshone River. The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad extended a branch line to Cody in 1901 and ultimately built through the entire basin. In 1904, Cody helped to form the Shoshone project, the nation's first federal water development project to help irrigate the western portion of the basin. The project culminated in the construction of the Buffalo Bill Dam and reservoir. The wealth in the region also attracted outlaws. Butch Cassidy lived near Meeteetse for a while and was arrested at the insistence of local cattle baron Otto Franc and sent to the Wyoming State Penitentiary for horse theft. Following his release, he formed the Wild Bunch gang which operated from the Hole-in-the-Wall area southeast of the Bighorn Basin. In 1942 one of the nation's ten Japanese American internment camps was located in Park County in the western part of the basin. The camp was named Heart Mountain Relocation Center, after nearby Heart Mountain. The camp operated until 1945, and at its peak detained over 10,000 internees. ==Geology== The Bighorn and adjacent structures in NE Wyoming The Bighorn Basin forms a geologic structural basin filled with more than of sedimentary rocks from Cambrian to Miocene in age. Since the early 20th century the basin has been a significant source of petroleum, and has produced more than of oil. The principal reservoir of oil is the Pennsylvanian Tensleep Formation; Other important petroleum horizons are the Mississippian Madison Limestone, Permian Phosphoria Formation and the Cretaceous Frontier Sandstone.John P. Weldon (1972) The Big Horn Basin in Geologic Atlas of the Rocky Mountain Region, Denver: Rocky Mountain Association of Geologists, p.270-272. Some uranium has been mined in the northern part of the basin, along the Bighorn Mountains. The eastern section of the basin is famously rich in fossils, with formations such as the Cretaceous period Cloverly Formation yielding numerous dinosaur fossils. The alluvial strata of the Willwood and Fort Union Formations of the Bighorn Basin contain a well-documented record of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). Analysis of paleosols here shows that the Bighorn Basin became more arid during the PETM, with wet/dry cycles superimposed over this general increase in aridity. These changes in environment are coupled with changes in paleoecology. == Communities == == Notable Features == * Red Gulch Dinosaur Tracksite * Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area ==See also== * Uranium mining in Wyoming * Wind River Basin * Wyoming Basin shrub steppe * Bighorn Basin Dinosaur Project ==References== Category:Landforms of Wyoming Category:Plateaus of the United States Category:Geology of Wyoming Category:Sedimentary basins of North America Category:Landforms of Big Horn County, Wyoming Category:Landforms of Park County, Wyoming Category:Landforms of Hot Springs County, Wyoming Category:Landforms of Washakie County, Wyoming ","title":"Bighorn Basin"},{"id":"522630","text":"Silverstone is a village and civil parish in Northamptonshire, England. It is about from Towcester on the former A43 main road, from the M1 motorway junction 15A and about from the M40 motorway junction 10, Northampton, Milton Keynes and Banbury. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 2,176. The A43 now bypasses to the south-east of the village. The Silverstone Circuit, the current home of the British Grand Prix, is located nearby; it straddles the Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire border. The village is listed in the Domesday Book. ==Parish church== St. Michael's Church Silverstone had a chapel by AD 1200. In about 1780 the medieval building was replaced by a Georgian one, which was enlarged by the addition of a chancel in 1841 and a north aisle and vestry in 1852. The entire church was demolished in the 1880s and replaced by the present Church of England parish church of Saint Michael, which is a Gothic Revival building designed by JP St Aubyn and completed in 1884.Pevsner & Cherry, 1973, page 404 On the north side of the parish churchyard are the remains of medieval fish ponds. ==Facilities== The village has one public house: the White Horse Inn. About south of the village is the Silverstone Circuit, a former Royal Air Force World War II bomber base and now the traditional home of the British Grand Prix, a Formula One race that attracts more than 300,000 visitors each year. Silverstone University Technical College opened at the circuit in September 2013. Adjacent to Silverstone Circuit is Silverstone Park, a business park operated by MEPC plc, with a focus on engineering and high-tech activities. The site is home to over 80 organisations, including Envision Virgin Racing, David Brown Automotive, Delta Motorsport, Ducati UK Ltd, National College for Motorsport, Danecca Limited and Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence. It also features the UK's only dedicated sub-contract inspection metrology facility, managed by Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence, a technical partner to Red Bull Formula 1.

It is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Theatre. ==History== AMDA was founded in 1964 by Philip Burton along with other people from the New York theatre community. The school established itself as a part of the New York performing arts community and garnered early support from members of the Broadway theatre such as Sammy Davis Jr., Dina Merrill and Carol Channing. By 1970, the school had outgrown its original location on East 23rd Street and moved into a new building on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village. A few years later, further growth prompted a move to the Ansonia Building. In the 1990s a second location, which is now the principal location of AMDA New York, was opened near Lincoln Center. In 2003 the school expanded west by opening AMDA Los Angeles in the Vine Tower Building. AMDA is the only BFA-granting performing arts college with campuses in both New York and Los Angeles. ==Campuses== The New York City campus is located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The principal facility is located at 211 West 61st Street, directly behind Lincoln Center. The other half of the campus is located at the Ansonia building, on West 73rd Street.

Sartre dedicated the book to his companion Olga Kosakiewicz, a former student of Simone de Beauvoir. ==\\"The Wall\\"== The eponymous story coldly depicts a situation in which prisoners are condemned to death. Written in 1939, the story is set in the Spanish Civil War, which began July 18, 1936, and ended April 1, 1939, when the Nationalists (known in Spanish as the Nacionalistas), led by General Francisco Franco, overcame the forces of the Spanish Republic and entered Madrid. The title refers to the wall used by firing squads to execute prisoners. The Wall itself symbolises the inevitability and unknowing of one's death. The protagonist, Pablo Ibbieta, along with two others in his cell, is sentenced to death. He is offered a way out if he reveals the location of his comrade, Ram√≥n Gris. Pablo begins thinking to himself and finds that he no longer cares about his cause or his life. Pablo continues to refuse to cooperate until just before his scheduled execution, when, seeing no harm in it, he gives the authorities what he believes to be false information on Ram√≥n Gris' whereabouts. Ram√≥n Gris moved from his previous hiding place to the very spot where Pablo tells the authorities he may be found. Thus Ram√≥n Gris is shot and Pablo's life is, at least temporarily, spared from death. ==\\"The Room\\"== In La Chambre (\\"The Room\\"), Mme Darb√©dat is confined to her room by an unknown illness, where she spends her bedridden days reminiscing about the past and eating rahat-loukoums. She receives weekly visits from her husband, M. Darb√©dat; that day, during their conversation, it is revealed that the Darb√©dats' daughter, √àve, refuses to allow her husband Pierre ‚Äì who suffers from apparent insanity ‚Äì to be put away into an asylum. Mme Darb√©dat hints at √àve and Pierre's continued romantic intimacy, further angering her husband. M. Darb√©dat decides to pay √àve a visit, and the narrative shifts from the ‚Äúsane‚Äù world of the Darb√©dats into the ‚Äúsick,‚Äù perverse world of Pierre. After witnessing some of Pierre‚Äôs eccentric, abnormal behavior, M. Darb√©dat, unable to convince √àve to send the \\"madman\\" to Dr Franchot's clinic, finally leaves the apartment in helpless frustration. In the second part of the story, the nature of Pierre‚Äôs bizarre psychosis is explored more fully: he remains locked in a room that he has painted in black, calls his wife ‚ÄúAgatha‚Äù and recounts delusions about a time spent with her in Hamburg, and keeps a talisman (which he calls a ‚Äúziuthre‚Äù) to deal with his hallucinations.

From its inception, the band underwent a number of line-up changes and never had a bass player. Known for its grindcore musical style and controversial lyrics, Anal Cunt released eight full-length studio albums in addition to a number of compilations and extended plays. Anal Cunt disbanded in 2011 after the group's founder and frontman, Seth Putnam, died of a suspected heart attack. They have been categorized as grindcore,Anal Cunt biography on Rockdetector Rivadavia, Eduardo.[] at Allmusic noisecore, noisegrind and hardcore. The band is often referred to by their initials A.C. (often written as AxCx) due to the offensive nature of their name and censorship limits on some radio and publications, and many of their album covers simply display the initials A. C. However, the band managed to subvert even this abbreviation by drawing these letters in a manner resembling an anus and a vulva. The group's early material contained no pre- written lyrics or music. Rather, the band developed an entirely improvised style which consisted of extremely loud, fast, and aggressive noise. Over time, the band gradually shifted their style and slowly began to incorporate more riffs and pre-written lyrics into their songs. It was not until then that Anal Cunt had earned the reputation for intentionally being outrageous and offensive. 2010 and 2011 saw the release of their final two albums; one of which is a \\"cock rock\\" album entitled Fuckin' A, and another being an album of material similar to their old grindcore albums called Wearing Out Our Welcome. ==BiographyFormation (1988)=== Anal Cunt was formed on March 1, 1988, in the city of Newton, Massachusetts, near Boston, by Seth Putnam, who had previously been a member of bands such as Executioner and Satan's Warriors. The name Anal Cunt came from Seth Putnam's attempt \\"to get the most offensive, stupid, dumb, etc. name possible\\". A common misconception is that the band is named after the song \\"Anal Cunt\\" by GG Allin,Torreano, Bradley. [ AC Biography] at Allmusic but in fact Allin's song was written years after the band had started. The band did, however, later in their career render tribute to him by recording a version of \\"I'll Slice Your Fucking Throat (If You Fuck with Me)\\", originally recorded by Allin and the Murder Junkies. In Q magazine's 2005 book The Greatest Rock & Pop Miscellany Ever!, Anal Cunt was included in a list of \\"25 Band Names That Should Have Stayed on the Drawing Board\\". Putnam originally formed the band as a joke, and they were supposed to only record one demo and do one show; however, they were active up to 2011, despite several brief break-ups. Originally, the band was to produce a form of 'anti-music', without rhythm, beats, riffs, lyrics, song titles or any other of the normal features of a band, an approach exemplified by the 5643 Song EP. ===Early performances and recordings and brief breakup (1988‚Äì1992)=== The band's first performance was in 1988 at Putnam's mother's house in front of some family members, namely his mother, his two little brothers and his grandmother, as well as some of his mother's friends. Several other small performances followed, in various basements and living rooms, before their first public show live over the radio at Brandeis University, with Anal Cunt being the latest in the long line of Putnam's bands who had performed in this way. This was scheduled to be the band's first and last show. Putnam invited future member Fred Ordonez, from the band Shit Scum, to the show, but he failed to turn up. As a result, it was arranged for the two bands (Anal Cunt and Shit Scum) to play a concert together so Ordonez could see Putnam's band, and a further show was arranged at Shit Scum's rented practice warehouse. The first demo was recorded on a 4-track in April in his mother's attic but this has never been mixed, released, or heard by anyone outside of the band members themselves. After a few more shows, the band decided to attempt a U.S. tour, in August 1988, a few days before which they recorded their 47 Song Demo, which was later re-released on a compilation of the bands' material from the early years. They recorded their 88 Song EP later that year and after its release, a number of record labels started showing interest in the band, including Earache Records, with whom they would later sign a contract. A few releases later, Earache Records again made an offer to the band, this time to license the 5643 Song EP for a European pressing (and later to buy the whole pressing), but Anal Cunt continued to turn down such offers. This was also the point where the band decided they had done as much as they could and decided to split up, after releasing Another EP and completing their first European tour. This tour was in April, and recordings from this tour are numerous, appearing on the compilations Fast Boston HC The Early Years and the bootlegs Harmonized Noise and the Anal Cunt/Patareni split. Following appearances in a few other bands, including (recently reformed) George H. Brown (a blues rock act whose song \\"Foreplay with a Tree Shredder\\" would later be recorded by Anal Cunt for the album Top 40 Hits), From Sloth to Anger, and Post Mortem, Seth Putnam and Tim Morse decided to reform Anal Cunt on March 1, 1991, exactly 3 years after they had initially formed. After the band's reformation, they decided they wanted to change their style to avoid getting bored again. The guitarist for the new, slightly more musical, Anal Cunt was originally supposed to be future member Paul Kraynak but ended up being Fred Ordonez, an ex-boxer. Some more EPs followed, including the world's first acoustic noisecore record, the Unplugged EP, before Putnam finally decided to introduce some elements of \\"real songs\\" into the band's material. Seth Putnam and Tim Morse tried out this idea in a 6-song session in 1992, just before Putnam successfully auditioned for the reformed thrashcore band Siege, but it was a while before the plans were fully realized. Later that year, Anal Cunt decided on another European tour. Despite the fact that Tim Morse pulled out at the last minute, the tour still went ahead, with the band deciding to find a drummer while they were touring. The two drummers who auditioned were not fast enough for the band, so Anal Cunt decided to have them both playing the same drum kit at the same time for the beginning of the tour, before resorting to just using the faster of the two. Most of the shows consisted of Putnam and Ordonez going into the crowd, punching people and destroying equipment, not only because of drunkenness but to conceal the fact that the drummer did not know their songs very well. This was also the tour that saw Putnam joining Fear of God on-stage as their drummer for one show and Putnam and Ordonez recording with Seven Minutes of Nausea. On returning to the U.S., Anal Cunt decided to get a second guitarist who could carry on playing with the drummer during the violence and shouting. The choice was John Kozik, and with him came a new era of the band. ===The Earache years (1993‚Äì1999)=== Although Anal Cunt had released a lot of material, their records were mostly out of print and hard to find, so they got in contact with Earache Records, which had previously shown an interest in the band. Anal Cunt wanted a label that would not only keep their records in stock but also pay for their tours, as the band at the time was operating essentially at a loss. Earache replied to Anal Cunt, asking to hear some new material. The band thereupon went into a studio in September to record what would later be released on Relapse Records as Morbid Florist. Fred Ordonez briefly quit, but was invited to rejoin after unsuccessful searches for a replacement and Earache Records decided to sign them. Anal Cunt started recording their first album on the label, Everyone Should Be Killed, in March 1993. Soon afterwards, Ordonez was kicked out of the band for good and was replaced by Paul Kraynak. Recording was put on hold for a short West Coast tour in mid-1993, after which Kraynak too quit the band. This was also the tour when Putnam got arrested for hitting a woman in the face with a microphone in San Francisco during a show that, along with another show from earlier that year in Massachusetts, is documented on the EP Breaking the Law. After some searching for a replacement for Kraynak, Anal Cunt decided to just stick with one guitarist, John Kozik. Following the release of Everyone Should Be Killed in 1994, the band did more tours, one in Europe and one immediately afterwards in the United States. The European tour encompassed Germany, Belgium, Spain and Austria, and Anal Cunt were supported by W.B.I. and the Necrophiliacs; on the American tour, they were joined by Incantation, Morpheus Descends, Afterlife and Gutted. The transition from noise-style to fast-hardcore-style songs began in the fall of that year with the recording of their next album Top 40 Hits, which featured the single \\"Stayin' Alive (Oi! Version)\\". Released in 1995, this album is about 50% noise and 50% songs and marked a significant change in the band's style. Anal Cunt toured America again, and in June toured Japan for the first time. After this, Kozik was replaced by Scott Hull, of Pig Destroyer and Agoraphobic Nosebleed fame. With this line-up (or variations on it), the album 40 More Reasons to Hate Us was recorded.Torreano, Bradley. [ \\"40 More Reasons to Hate Us\\" ‚Äì Overview]. Allmusic. This album marked another change in the band's direction, with lyrics ‚Äì and insults ‚Äì being included in their songs for the first time. Another two-week long tour with Eyehategod followed, but Hull refused to tour and was temporarily replaced by a returning Kozik. After this tour, the band was again close to breaking up (for the second time), but instead decided to shuffle the line-up once more. The problem seemed to be with Tim Morse, so he was kicked out of the band. Seth Putnam was now the only surviving original member of Anal Cunt. The band was briefly on hiatus while Putnam put together a new lineup. The only thing they recorded during this time was the song \\"You're Gonna Need Someone On Your Side\\", for the Smiths tribute album The World Still Won't Listen, and the song \\"Two Turds and a Golf Ball\\" for the compilation CD of the same name, with Hull on guitar and Putnam performing drums and vocals. During this period, Putnam also did backing vocals for Pantera's The Great Southern Trendkill[ \\"The Great Southern Trendkill\\" credits] at Allmusic in New Orleans, and lead vocals for an Eyehategod show. In January 1996 Putnam hired a new guitarist, Josh Martin. Martin was a student at New York University in 1994‚Äì1995, when Anal Cunt used to play in New York a lot, and they had become good friends. Indeed, this was a friendship that would continue, as Putnam and Martin would join forces later in Adolf Satan and acoustic black-metal band Impaled Northern Moonforest. Martin moved to Boston following his graduation, and was appointed by Putnam as the new Anal Cunt guitarist. After trying out a lot of drummers, they hired Nate Linehan, who blew away the competition. Yet another tour followed, this time with Incantation and Mortician. Anal Cunt then released their next full- length release, I Like It When You Die, which they had recorded prior to the tour. This album was essentially a collection of insults and featured the songs \\"You're Gay\\" and \\"Technology's Gay\\", as well as a guest appearance from Kyle Severn from Incantation. A lot of the songs refer to things being \\"gay\\", as this was a common slang word in Massachusetts and in junior-high schools across the United States at the time. Following the tour, Linehan left the band and again activities were put on hold. Even so, Putnam and Martin recorded a few songs for a Black Sabbath tribute, In These Black Days Volume 1, which was a split with Eyehategod and featured Putnam on drums. A few months later, Putnam and Martin asked Linehan to rejoin the band and he agreed. Another two tours later (the first in America with Murder One, the second in Japan), Anal Cunt recorded what would be their last album on Earache Records, It Just Gets Worse, which was released at the end of their 1999 European tour with Fl√§chenbrand. The album was surrounded by much controversy: the label changed some of the song titles and also censored the lyrics to two of the songs. ===Second breakup, reformation, and 20th anniversary (2000‚Äì2009)=== Despite being dropped by their label (although Earache did later make them an offer to come back, which they turned down) and Linehan leaving again in September 1999, Anal Cunt continued on, now with John Gillis on drums. Some more touring and a few releases followed, such as the Defenders of the Hate EP and a split 7\\" with Flachenbrand (who had opened for AC on their 1999 German tour). There was also a Defenders of the Hate tour in 2001, featuring two legs: one to California and back in June, and one to Texas and back in September. The band released a limited tour edition of the record as part of the tour. Anal Cunt issued an official press release at the end of December 2001 saying that they had broken up again. This time, the band seemed to have permanently disbanded, with only a few compilation tracks and the Very Rare Rehearsal from February 1989 CD being released. During a show in 2000 in Providence, Rhode Island, Dropdead opened for Anal Cunt, but when Anal Cunt took the stage, Putnam began insulting Bob Otis from Dropdead, and eventually the audience, throwing out racial slurs and performing Nazi salutes; Otis eventually got on stage and knocked Putnam off the stage, and a fight broke out. Anal Cunt reformed in August 2003 with the lineup of Putnam, Martin and Linehan. However, after one practice, Martin was forced to leave the band, due to him going to jail. Putnam brought John Kozik back to replace him. After a few gigs in late 2003 (including one opening for Superjoint Ritual) and a short Japan tour in January 2004 with Napalm Death, Nasum, and Pig Destroyer, Linehan left the band yet again. He was again replaced by John Gillis. In October 2004, Putnam went into a coma for nearly a month as a result of a drug overdose. Initially reported as a sleeping pill overdose for legal reasons, he later claimed it was a combination of alcohol, crack, heroin, and a bottle of sleeping pills. Doctors thought that even if he survived, he would suffer permanent serious brain damage and were intending to \\"pull the plug\\", before Putnam's mother intervened. Even after coming out of the coma, Putnam was now paralyzed and had sustained severe nerve damage, needing months of physical therapy to recover. For the first show that Anal Cunt played following this coma (with Eyehategod), Putnam had to remain seated in a chair throughout.Kozik, Tina. A.C. DecibelCarioli, Carly. Coma chameleon . The Boston Phoenix. October 14, 2005. Putnam said he would continue to play songs such as \\"You're in a Coma\\" and had promised that the band would release new material. After a festival appearance in Norway in 2006, at which Putnam completely passed out on stage and was unconscious for the entire gig, both Kozik and Gillis quit the band. Martin (now out of jail) soon returned to the band and got Linehan to return as well. Anal Cunt released the Defenders of the Hate full-length CD in 2007, which featured bonus out-of-print tracks, such as those from the 13 Bands Who Think You're Gay and Thrash of the Titans compilations, as well as the tracks from the split with Fl√§chenbrand. Other releases that had been promised included a sequel to Picnic of Love (Picnic of Love II) and an Anal Cunt/Gay Bar split, featuring unreleased Anal Cunt material from the Putnam/Martin/Linehan era on one side and a recording of Seth Putnam in a gay bar on the other. These albums were never recorded. The Defenders of the Hate re-release sparked another tour in March 2007 which included an appearance at the Los Angeles Murderfest Version 3.0 on March 24, 2007.More Bands Announced For Los Angeles Murderfest. MetalUnderground.com: February 19, 2007. with Accused, Brutal Truth, Pig Destroyer, and others, and a UK festival appearance later that year. 2008 was the 20th anniversary of the band, so Putnam celebrated it with several original lineup reunion shows with Tim Morse and Mike Mahan. By this point Linehan had yet again left the band, and Martin was again in jail. They played shows in Boston, Texas, and the West Coast. On November 17, 2008, the original Anal Cunt line-up (Seth Putnam, Mike Mahan, and Tim Morse) finished recording their 110 Song CD. The album was made as a celebration of the band's 20-year anniversary. The album's musical style is the same as Anal Cunt's early noisecore style. After the original lineup reunion was over, Morse decided to stay on as the permanent drummer. Martin also returned. In early 2009 the Old Stuff Part 3 CD was released, featuring all the non-Earache tracks recorded by the Putnam, Martin and Linehan lineup in the 1990s. This sparked another round of touring. In 2009 AC played all over the US, plus a short tour of Norway in October. Also in 2009, Anal Cunt recorded their next two albums. ===New material, Putnam's death, and permanent dissolution (2010‚Äì2011)=== In April 2010, Putnam announced that the new album was almost completed. The album was delayed due to Josh Martin being in jail (for a third time). The lead guitar tracks were recorded when he was released. On May 11, 2010, Putnam announced that the band decided to split the new recording into two albums. The \\"cock rock songs\\" would be released on an album called Fuckin' A in a style similar to that of M√∂tley Cr√ºe's debut Too Fast for Love, and the noisegrind songs would be released on an album called Wearing Out Our Welcome, which would also feature backing vocals from members of the Raunchous Brothers, Vaginal Jesus, and Mudoven. On June 22, 2010, Putnam completed Fuckin' A. The songs \\"Fuck Yeah\\" and \\"Cranking My Band's Demo on a Box at the Beach\\" were released on Myspace Music. On June 24, 2010, Seth Putnam announced on the Anal Cunt Myspace blog that guitarist Josh Martin \\"is out of A.C.\\". Putnam continued by stating that the band would play and record as a two-piece outfit. Fuckin' A was released on January 11, 2011. At the same time, it was announced that Josh Martin was once again back in Anal Cunt, after only two shows performed as a two-piece. In April 2011 Anal Cunt embarked on what would be their final tour. The last show was on April 30, 2011, in Cleveland. On June 11, 2011, the band's frontman and founder Seth Putnam died of a suspected heart attack, seemingly ending the band. A compilation CD of obscure Anal Cunt releases was announced in 2009 and was planned to be released by Wicked Sick Records (Seth Putnam's label). In October 2011 it was announced to be a two-CD set entitled The Old Testament. It is a re-release of The Early Years 1988‚Äì1991 with a new cover, liner notes penned by Putnam, the band's first demo (which was never before heard by anyone outside Anal Cunt and two girls that visited Putnam's house and were in the room when the recording was made), and tracks from Anal Cunt's final rehearsal session in 1991. It was released in November 2011 by Relapse Records. Former guitarist Josh Martin died on May 28, 2018, after accidentally falling off an escalator and hitting his head on a table at the Providence Place mall in Rhode Island. ==Style and controversy== Anal Cunt's style had changed much since 1988, as originally they formed as a noisecore band before incorporating elements of grindcore and hardcore into their style. Songs in the early years were often no more than a few seconds long (their 5643 Song EP being an extreme example), although this later increased so that the average song length was between 40 seconds and 1 minute. The typical Anal Cunt song was short and loud with extremely distorted guitars played randomly up and down the neck, near incomprehensible screaming and blast beat drumming. Some songs show influence from punk rock, powerviolence, doom metal and sludge metal. ===Lyrics=== Anal Cunt were often cited as having common lyrical themes that include misogyny, homophobia, Nazism, antisemitism, racism and ridicule of the unfortunate, although this has not always been the case. Many of these songs included insults, either general or specific to one person. The album I Like It When You Die developed the idea of containing insults in their songs, with a recurring song title being \\"X Is Gay\\", with examples including \\"You're Gay\\", \\"Technology's Gay\\", \\"Recycling Is Gay\\", \\"The Internet Is Gay\\", \\"Windchimes Are Gay\\" and even \\"The Word 'Homophobic' Is Gay.\\" Another recurring song title is \\"You X\\", with examples including \\"You Own a Store\\", \\"You Live in a Houseboat\\", \\"You Are an Orphan\\", \\"You Go to Art School\\", and \\"You Keep a Diary\\". The band even parodied this theme with the songs \\"You (Fill in the Blank)\\" and \\"I'm in Anal Cunt\\". The 1999 album, It Just Gets Worse, took the idea of intentional offense a step further with more extreme examples of racism and sexism. Examples include \\"You're Pregnant So I Kicked You in the Stomach\\", \\"I Lit Your Baby on Fire\\" and \\"Women: Nature's Punching Bag\\". The lyrics to two of the songs on this album were altered, and one of the songs on this album had its name changed from \\"Conor Clapton Committed Suicide Because His Father Sucks\\" to \\"Your Kid Committed Suicide Because You Suck\\", because they were working for a record label in Britain, where libel laws are very stringent. Another song on the album called \\"Easy E Got Aids from F Mercury\\" contains the lyrics \\"Now Freddie's dead and he's in heaven; at his wake you ate watermelon\\". It was also on It Just Gets Worse that the band began to include references to the Holocaust in their songs, including \\"I Sent Concentration Camp Footage to America's Funniest Home Videos\\". This theme of seemingly glorifying Adolf Hitler and his actions continued on their subsequent EPs, with songs such as \\"Hitler Was a Sensitive Man\\", \\"I'm Hitler\\", \\"Body by Auschwitz\\", \\"I Went Back in Time and Voted for Hitler\\" and \\"Ha Ha Holocaust\\". Another common lyrical theme in the band's material was that of insulting other bands, or music in general. Such examples include the song titles \\"Rancid Sucks (And The Clash Sucked Too)\\", \\"Limp Bizkit Think They're Black, but They're Just Gay\\", \\"Anyone Who Likes the Dillinger Escape Plan Is a Faggot\\" and \\"311 Sucks\\". Next to this offensive material, some of their other songs were deliberately much more light-hearted, which was done to self- parody.

The school is dedicated to the acting technique of Sanford Meisner. Its founder, William \\"Bill\\" Esper, is often referred to as the best-known of Meisner's first generation teachers, and his most \\"authentic protege\\". The William Esper Studio was listed as one of The 25 Best Drama Schools for a Master of Fine Arts numerous times. ==Background== When Esper was a young man, he saw Eli Wallach and Maureen Stapleton in a touring production of The Rose Tattoo. As Esper later recounted: \\"[I] was so struck by the acting ...[A]fter the play was over, I decided to go around the corner to get a cup of coffee so I could think about it some more. I walked into a little drugstore, and Eli was sitting there having a bite to eat...\\" Esper talked to the actor, and Wallach told him he had studied at Sanford Meisner's Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre. After graduating Case Western Reserve University in his native Ohio, Esper moved to New York City and began studying with Meisner, who was famous for his repetition exercise.Backstage Magazine NY feature on Studio In 1962 Esper undertook training as a teacher and director with Meisner and proceeded to work closely with him for the next 15 years. Esper was on the staff of the Neighborhood Playhouse from 1965 to 1977 and Associate Director of the Playhouse Acting Department from 1974 to 1977. In 1977 Esper also founded the BFA and MFA Professional Actor Training Programs at Rutgers University's Mason Gross School of the Arts. He led that department until 2004. Esper has been a guest artist/teacher at Canada's Banff Festival of the Arts as well as at the National Theatre School of Canada, the St. Nicholas Theater in Chicago, Illinois, and the Schauspiel M√ºnchen School in Munich. Together with his wife Suzanne Esper, who also teaches at Esper Studios, he has conducted numerous workshops throughout Europe, most notably at the National Film School of Denmark, the Norwegian National Academy of Theatre, and the National Theatre Mannheim. In 2008 Bill and Suzanne Esper introduced Meisner's work to Russia at the St. Petersburg State Academy of Theater. Esper has worked extensively Off-Broadway and regionally. He is a member of Ensemble Studio Theatre in New York. He was profiled in the book The New Generation of Acting Teachers, published by Viking Press in 1987. He is a past member of the National Board of the National Association of Schools of Theatre and a former Vice-President and Board Member of the University/Resident Theatre Association. He has lectured on acting at People‚Ä≤s Light and Theatre Company and the Screen Actors Guild Conservatory, New York City; SAG honored him with a Certificate of Achievement for his service to the profession. In 2011 Esper received the Association for Theatre in Higher Education (ATHE)'s Lifetime Achievement in Academic Theatre Award. In 2013 he was inducted into the College of Fellows of the American Theatre. Esper died January 26, 2019. The studio is currently led by his widow Suzanne, who also was trained by Sanford Meisner both as an actor and a teacher alongside with Esper. ==Notable alumni== In 1965 Esper founded his eponymous studio.

He is so impressed with Guan Ping on first sight that he accepts him as his foster son. During the Battle of Runan, Guan Ping, Guan Yu and Zhou Cang lead 300 men to rescue Liu Bei, who is under attack by Cao Cao's general Zhang He. Guan Ping participates in some of Liu Bei's subsequent military exploits, including the Battle of Bowang against Cao Cao's general Xiahou Dun, and the Yi Province campaign against Liu Zhang. Later, he is relocated to Jing Province to join his foster father in defending Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province. In 219, Guan Ping follows Guan Yu to the Battle of Fancheng and scores some initial victories over Cao Cao's forces, including flooding seven enemy armies. However, in the meantime, Sun Quan (Liu Bei's ally) secretly breaks the alliance and sends his general L√º Meng to attack and conquer Jing Province in a stealth invasion. Guan Yu is completely caught off guard and eventually isolated in Maicheng with a fraction of his remaining forces. While trying to break out of the siege, Guan Yu and Guan Ping are captured in an ambush by Sun Quan's forces. Sun Quan tries to persuade them to surrender, but they refuse so Sun has them executed. ==In popular cultureReligion=== Statue of Guan Ping in the Stele Forest in Beilin District, Xi'an Guan Ping sometimes appears as a door god in Chinese and Taoist temples in partnership with Guan Yu.

Described as a \\"variant player's handbook\\", the 256-page hardcover core rulebook bears many similarities to the Player's Handbook of 3rd Edition Dungeons & Dragons, on which Cook worked a few years prior. Arcana Unearthed is based on the d20 system of Dungeons & Dragons, but because of the rules for character advancement, it cannot be an official d20 system product. It does, however, use the Open Gaming License. ==Development== Arcana Unearthed (2003) was advertised as a \\"variant player's handbook\\" that offered different d20 rules set in Monte Cook's world of \\"The Diamond Throne,\\" a giant-dominated setting. It was revised in Arcana Evolved (2005). ==Themes== Two of the most important themes of the game are ritual and character choices. Both the setting information and the game rules emphasize these areas far more than is typical of Dungeons & Dragons products. Two examples are metamorphosis, in which faen become tiny, winged sprytes, and Chi-Julud, in which the wise giants temporarily lose their wisdom to become stronger and more warlike. Both involve rituals, and both also involve choices on the part of both the player and character that are much more far-reaching than those typically faced by D&D; characters (especially Spryte transformation, which is permanent and irrevocable). Cook emphasizes that players should avoid archetypes (presumably referring to the character archetypes of Dungeons & Dragons) and design their characters more creatively. In fact, shortly after the game was released, Monte Cook's website held a character design competition. ==Setting== The campaign setting for Arcana Unearthed is the lands of The Diamond Throne, a land ruled by giants (in contrast to the human dominance assumed in most other fantasy settings). The setting includes many elements of a traditional fantasy setting, along with a focus on ritual and ceremony, runes, and the magical properties of crystals. ==Title confusion== Arcana Unearthed is not to be confused with Unearthed Arcana, the title of two books published in 1985 and 2004 that provided additional material for use in the then-current version of Dungeons & Dragons. The name Arcana Unearthed was chosen partially as a homage to the earlier of these two books. The announcement of the 2004 version came as an unpleasant surprise to Cook and some of his fans, who believed that they had an understanding with Wizards of the Coast that this title would not be re-used in the near future. (Cook praised the book itself, however, calling the 2004 Unearthed Arcana \\"Probably the best book [Wizards of the Coast has] released since 3rd Edition began\\" in the introduction to Monte Cook Presents: The Year's Best D20, Volume 1.) ==Reception== Arcana Unearthed won the 2004 Gold ENnie Award for Best Game, and the Silver for Best Art (Cover). The cover, by artist Mark Zug, won the Chesley Award for Best Gaming-Related Illustration in 2005.(October 2005). \\"Chesley Awards\\", Chronicle 27 (9): 10‚Äì11. ==Arcana Evolved== Arcana Evolved is an updated \\"director's cut\\" of Arcana Unearthed released in 2005. Arcana Evolved is 432 pages in full color. It adds the contents of two previously separate books, The Diamond Throne and the Player's Companion, to the original variant player's handbook, along with new material including a new class and race, many new feats and spells, and rules for higher level characters than were possible in the original book. On the less mechanical side, it also advances the time line of the Diamond Throne campaign setting by several years - years which feature the return of dragons to the lands of the Diamond Throne, reviving an ancient rivalry with the ruling giants. == Additional books == Malhavoc Press have expanded the Arcana Unearthed universe with a series of books, including the rulebooks The Diamond Throne, Legacy of Dragons, Grimoire II, and Mystic Secrets, and the short story collection Children of the Rune. Some other publishers, including Blue Devil Games, have also supported the Arcana Unearthed line. Since the release of Arcana Evolved, Malhavoc has released a number of supporting books specific to the new edition, such as the Spell Treasury, Transcendence and Ruins of Intrigue. Sue Weinlein Cook edited the 2004 short story collection Children of the Rune. ==References== ==External links== * Arcana Evolved Products at Malhavoc Press. * Review of Arcana Evolved at Enworld. * d20 Magazine Rack has 3 staff reviews of Arcana Evolved: ** Review by Bruce Boughner ** Review by Chris Sims, also known as Khur ** Review by Ian Hewitt Category:D20 System publications Category:Fantasy role-playing games Category:Role-playing games introduced in 2003 ","title":"Arcana Unearthed"},{"id":"522655","text":"John Forsyth Sr. (October 22, 1780October 21, 1841) was a 19th-century American politician from Georgia. He represented the state in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, and also served as the 33rd Governor of Georgia. As a supporter of the policies of President Andrew Jackson, Forsyth was appointed secretary of state by Jackson in 1834, and continued in that role until 1841 during the presidency of Martin Van Buren. ==Early life== Forsyth was born in Fredericksburg, Virginia. His father, Robert Forsyth, was the first U.S. Marshal to be killed in the line of duty in 1794. He was an attorney who graduated from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1799. He married Clara Meigs, daughter of Josiah Meigs, in 1801 or 1802. One of his sons, John Forsyth, Jr., later became a newspaper editor. ==Political life== Forsyth served in the United States House of Representatives (1813‚Äì1818 and 1823‚Äì1827), the United States Senate (1818‚Äì1819 and 1829‚Äì1834), and as the 33rd Governor of Georgia (1827‚Äì1829). He was the United States Secretary of State from 1834 until 1841. In this role he led the government's response to the Amistad case. He was a loyal follower of Andrew Jackson and opposed John C. Calhoun in the issue of nullification. Forsyth was appointed as Secretary of State in reward for his efforts. He led the pro- removal reply to Theodore Frelinghuysen about the Indian Removal Act of 1830. He supported slavery and was a slaveholder himself. ==Death and legacy== Forsyth died in Washington, D.C., and was buried in Congressional Cemetery.

It used to be part of the Surrey Commercial Docks, most of which have by now been filled in. Greenland Dock is now used purely for recreational purposes; it is one of only two functioning enclosed docks on the south bank of the River Thames, along with the smaller South Dock, Rotherhithe, to which it is connected by a channel now known as Greenland Cut. ==HistoryHowland Great Wet Dock=== View of the Howland Great Wet Dock in 1717 looking west across the Rotherhithe peninsula The dock was originally laid out between 1695 and 1699 on land owned by the aristocratic Russell family of the 1st Duke of Bedford. The Russells had been given a portion of land in lower Rotherhithe by a wealthy Streatham landowner, John Howland, as part of a wedding dowry for his daughter Elizabeth, granddaughter of Sir Josiah Child ‚Äì the dictatorial chairman of the East India Company, who married Wriothesley Russell, the Marquis of Tavistock. They immediately set about \\"improving\\" the rural property, obtaining parliamentary permission in 1695 to construct a rectangular dock with an area of about , capable of accommodating around 120 ships. It was named Howland Great Wet Dock in honour of John Howland. Designed by local shipwright, John Wells, the dock was intended to refit East India ships. In a picture of about 1717, it can be seen in a rural setting some miles outside the (much smaller) city of London, lined with trees on three sides (to act as windbreaks) and with the Russell family's mansion situated at the western end. Unlike the later docks, it was not built with cargo traffic in mind; it did not have walls, warehouses or other commercial facilities. Instead, it was promoted as being capable of accommodating ships \\"without the trouble of shifting, mooring or unmooring any in the dock for taking in or out any other\\". It was essentially a re-fitting base where ships could be repaired and berthed in a sheltered anchorage. It was aided in this regard by its proximity to the dockyards at Deptford. ===Whaling and timber trades=== Manuscript plan of the Greenland Dock, 1763 From the 1720s, Greenland whalers also used the dock and substantial blubber boiling houses were built to produce oil on the south side. Howland Great Wet Dock was sold by the fourth Duke of Bedford in 1763. Extensive usage by the Greenland whaling ships prompted the dock to be renamed Greenland Dock. However, this trade declined sharply by the start of the 19th century. In 1806 the dock was sold to William Richie, a Greenwich timber merchant and founder of the Commercial Dock Company (1807). The Company built a series of additional docks and two new timber ponds to the north while rival companies built additional docks, leading to the jumble of harbours, canals and timber ponds. In 1865, the company merged with the neighbouring Surrey Docks to form the Surrey Commercial Docks, controlling some 80% of London's timber trade. Greenland Dock remained at the centre of London's timber trade for well over a century to come. It was lined with warehouses and immense piles of construction timber or \\"deal wood\\", which were maintained by the athletic deal porters. Much of the timber arrived aboard small sailing vessels from the Baltic region, although these were eventually displaced by large steamers. ===Expansion and decline=== Unloading timber at Greenland Dock, 1927 Between 1895 and 1904 Greenland Dock was greatly expanded by being extended at a cost of ¬£940,000 to the west in a project carried out under Sir John Wolfe-Barry, the engineer who built Tower Bridge. More than doubling in length and nearly doubling in depth, in its final form, it covered an area of , with a depth of and a length of , which cut straight across the old Grand Surrey Canal. It was also given a large lock, long, wide and deep. This renovation enabled the dock to take large cargo ships and even ocean-going liners. Cunard Line A-class vessels of as much as , driven by large steam engines and carrying passengers and cargos in both directions, sailed regularly from Greenland Dock to the St. Lawrence River in Canada. They were considered huge ships for so far upstream and they had to be swung round in the river to enter the lock. In 1909 the dock, along with all of the other London docks, was amalgamated into the Port of London under the management of the Port of London Authority. In the same era as the big steamships there were, by contrast, the barques and barquentines of less than a tenth the size that brought timber from Finland: survivors of the age of sail with three or more masts and representatives of the Baltic side of the timber trade. Finland Quay, Swedish Quay, Norway Dock and Russia Dock were some of the names arising from what had been the original part of Rotherhithe's timber trade. Greenland Dock suffered greatly during World War II, when many of the warehouses were razed by German bombing and the great lock was rendered unusable due to bomb damage. It soon recovered after the war and enjoyed a brief resurgence of prosperity. However, technological changes in the shipping industry soon pushed the dock into a spiral of decline. The deal porters' jobs were abolished from 1958 when timber started to be packaged. Not long afterwards, the shipping industry moved en masse to the system of containerization, which required bulk carriers far too large to be accommodated in the London docks. In 1970, the Surrey Commercial Docks were closed. Greenland Dock was sold to Southwark council. ==Redevelopment== The ILEA water sports centre, 1980 Greenland Dock, Surrey Quays, circa 1995 The Surrey Docks remained derelict for over a decade, with much of the warehousing demolished and over 90% of the docks filled in. Greenland Dock, which now belonged to the local authority, escaped this fate and in 1981 was handed over to the London Docklands Development Corporation. During this period the Inner London Education Authority ran a Surrey Docks Watersports Centre on the dock from a series of portable cabins at the Redriff Road end of the dock. It was at this centre many young people who would not have been exposed to sailing or canoeing were trained. A masterplan was produced that advocated evicting the remaining industrial occupiers of the quaysides and transforming the dock into a residential area. This went ahead in the late 1980s despite some controversy, with seven residential developments being constructed on the site of the former warehouse complexes (and named after them; hence Swedish Yard became Swedish Quay, Brunswick Yard became Brunswick Quay, Baltic Yard became Baltic Quay and so on). Today the area is dominated by luxury residential developments, such as the Greenland Passage development and the gated New Caledonian Wharf. Additionally, a new watersports centre was constructed on the site of the former entrance to the now infilled Grand Surrey Canal. This has maintained the dock as a popular site for sailing, windsurfing, canoeing and dragon boat racing. The dock itself is still substantially intact, other than its former entrances and exits, all but one of which have been filled in or blocked. It still has a working connection to South Dock, which is now a marina, and it has a small marina of its own at its eastern end. There are no traces of the former warehouses, although many of the old capstans and some of the hydraulic machines on the quayside have been preserved. The alternative comedian Malcolm Hardee drowned in the dock in 2005 while rowing to his houseboat, Sea Sovereign, from the floating pub he owned, the Wibbley Wobbley, which was moored at the Thames end of Greenland Dock. ==Transport== Residential development at Greenland Dock The nearest London Underground station is Canada Water on the Jubilee line. The nearest London Overground stations are Surrey Quays and Canada Water on the East London Line. Thames Clippers' water-bus serves Greenland Pier. The Thames Path passes along the southern bank of the River Thames. ==Nearby places== *Canada Water *Russia Dock Woodland *South Dock *Surrey Quays ==Further reading== *Shipbuilding in Rotherhithe ‚Äì Greenland Dock & Barnard's Wharf by Stuart Rankin, Bib Id 482821 *Shipbuilding in Rotherhithe ‚Äì An historical introduction by Stuart Rankin, Bib Id 488375, pp. 5‚Äì6 ==External links== *John Butler's Landscape Photography page on Rotherhithe Category:London docks Category:Geography of the London Borough of Southwark Category:Port of London Category:Rotherhithe ","title":"Greenland Dock"},{"id":"522672","text":"Dancing satyr is a sculpture type in Hellenistic and Roman art.

Metheny and Mays composed and arranged nearly all of the group's music, for which Mays won eleven Grammy Awards. ==Biography== While growing up, Mays had four main interests: chess, mathematics, architecture, and music. His mother Doris played piano and organ and his father Cecil, a truck driver, taught himself to play guitar. His teacher allowed him to practice improvisation after the structured elements of the lesson were completed. At age nine he played organ at a family member's wedding, and at age fourteen he began to play in church. In summer camp he was introduced to jazz pianist Marian McPartland. Bill Evans at the Montreux Jazz Festival and Filles de Kilimanjaro by Miles Davis (both recorded in 1968) were important influences. He graduated from the University of North Texas after attending the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìEau Claire. He composed and arranged for the One O'Clock Lab Band and was the composer and arranger for the Grammy Award-nominated album Lab 75. After leaving North Texas, Mays toured with Woody Herman's group for approximately eight months. In 1975 he met Pat Metheny and later founded the Pat Metheny Group. Mays won ten Grammy awards and was nominated twenty-three times. In an interview with JAZZIZ magazine in 2016 Mays said he had been working as a music software manager because of changes in the music industry. ==Work== Mays composed and arranged as a member of the Pat Metheny Group, playing piano, organ, keyboards, synthesizer, and occasionally trumpet, accordion, agog√¥ bells, autoharp, toy xylophone, and electric guitar. He composed and recorded children's audio books, such as East of the Sun, West of the Moon, Moses the Lawgiver, The Lion and the Lamb, The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher, and Tale of Peter Rabbit with text read by Meryl Streep. Metheny's and Mays' compositions were performed by the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago in a production of Orphans by Lyle Kessler. He composed classical music, such as \\"Twelve Days in the Shadow of a Miracle\\", a piece for harp, flute, viola, and synthesizer recorded in 1996 by the Debussy Trio. Apart from the Metheny group, he performed in a trio with Marc Johnson and Peter Erskine and formed the Lyle Mays Quartet with Eric Hochberg, Mark Walker, and Bob Sheppard. An amateur architect, he designed his sister Joan's house and was influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright. ==Death== Mays died in Los Angeles, at the age of 66, on February 10, 2020 \\"after a long battle with a recurring illness\\". ==DiscographyAs leader=== * As Falls Wichita, So Falls Wichita Falls with Pat Metheny (ECM, 1981) * Lyle Mays (Geffen, 1986) * Street Dreams (Geffen, 1988) * Fictionary (Geffen, 1993) * Solo: Improvisations for Expanded Piano (Warner Bros., 2000) * The Ludwigsburg Concert (Jazzhaus, 2015) With the Pat Metheny Group * Pat Metheny Group (ECM, 1978) * American Garage (ECM, 1979) * Offramp (ECM, 1982) * Travels (ECM, 1983) * First Circle (ECM, 1984) * The Falcon and the Snowman (EMI, 1985) * Still Life (Talking) (Geffen, 1987) * Letter from Home (Geffen, 1989) * The Road to You (Geffen, 1993) * We Live Here (Geffen, 1995) * Quartet (Geffen, 1996) * Imaginary Day (Warner Bros, 1997) * Speaking of Now (Warner Bros., 2002) * The Way Up (Nonesuch, 2005) ===As sideman=== * Pedro Aznar, Contemplacion (Interdisc, 1985) * Betty Buckley, Betty Buckley (Rizzoli, 1986) * Igor Butman, Falling Out (Impromptu, 1993) * Woody Herman, Live in Warsaw (Storyville 1991) * Mark Isham, Film Music (Windham Hill, 1985) * Rickie Lee Jones, Girl at Her Volcano (Warner Bros., 1983) * Nando Lauria, Points of View (Narada, 1994) * Paul McCandless, Premonition (Windham Hill, 1992) * Bobby McFerrin, Medicine Music (EMI, 1990) * Pat Metheny, Watercolors (ECM, 1977) * Pat Metheny, Secret Story (Geffen, 1992) * Joni Mitchell, Shadows and Light (Asylum, 1980) * Bob Moses, When Elephants Dream of Music (Gramavision, 1983) * Bob Moses, The Story of Moses (Gramavision, 1987) * Noa, Noa (Geffen, 1994) * Steve Swallow, Home (ECM, 1980) * Toots Thielemans, East Coast West Coast (Private Music 1994) * Eberhard Weber, Later That Evening (ECM, 1982) * Phil Wilson & Rich Matteson, The Sound of the Wasp (1975) ==References== ==External links== * At Jazziz magazine * Podcast Category:American jazz pianists Category:American male pianists Category:1953 births Category:2020 deaths Category:People from Marinette County, Wisconsin Category:University of North Texas College of Music alumni Category:Musicians from Wisconsin Category:University of Wisconsin‚ÄìEau Claire alumni Category:Pat Metheny Group members Category:20th- century American pianists Category:21st-century American pianists Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:21st-century American male musicians Category:American male jazz musicians ","title":"Lyle Mays"},{"id":"522676","text":"Silverstone Circuit is a motor racing circuit in England, near the Northamptonshire villages of Silverstone and Whittlebury. It is the current home of the British Grand Prix, which it first hosted as the 1948 British Grand Prix. The 1950 British Grand Prix at Silverstone was the first race in the newly created World Championship of Drivers.Mike Lang, Grand Prix! Volume 1, 1950 to 1965, page 14World Championship of Drivers, 1974 FIA Yearbook, Grey section, page 118‚Äì119 The race rotated between Silverstone, Aintree and Brands Hatch from 1955 to 1986, but settled permanently at the Silverstone track in 1987. The circuit also hosts the British round of the MotoGP series. On 30 September 2004 British Racing Drivers' Club president Jackie Stewart announced that the British Grand Prix would not be included on the 2005 provisional race calendar and, if it were, would probably not occur at Silverstone. However, on 9 December an agreement was reached with former Formula One rights holder Bernie Ecclestone ensuring that the track would host the British Grand Prix until 2009 after which Donington Park would become the new host. However, the Donington Park leaseholders, Donington Ventures Leisure, ran into severe financial problems and went into administration, resulting in the BRDC signing a 17-year deal with Ecclestone to hold the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. The escalating costs of the British Grand Prix led to the BRDC triggering a break clause in their contract, meaning that the 2019 British Grand Prix would be the last at the Silverstone Circuit. Although there was speculation of a street race in London, lengthy negotiations with Liberty Media have led to a new agreement for Silverstone to continue to host the British Grand Prix for a further five years after 2019. ==Circuit== Satellite view of the circuit in 2018 (Planet Labs) The Silverstone circuit is on the site of a World War II Royal Air Force bomber station, RAF Silverstone, which opened in 1943. The station was the base for No. 17 Operational Training Unit. The airfield's three runways, in classic WWII triangle format, lie within the outline of the present track. The circuit straddles the Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire border and is accessed from the nearby A43. The Northamptonshire towns of Towcester (5 miles) and Brackley (7 miles) and Buckinghamshire town of Buckingham (6 miles) are close by, and the nearest large towns are Northampton and Milton Keynes. Silverstone was first used for motorsport by an 'ad hoc' group of friends who set up an impromptu race in September 1947. One of their members, Maurice Geoghegan, lived in nearby Silverstone village and was aware that the airfield was deserted. He and eleven other drivers raced over a two- mile circuit, during the course of which Geoghegan himself ran over a sheep that had wandered onto the airfield. The sheep was killed and the car written off, and in the aftermath of this event the informal race became known as the Mutton Grand Prix. The next year the Royal Automobile Club took a lease on the airfield and set out a more formal racing circuit. Their first two races were held on the runways themselves, with long straights separated by tight hairpin corners, the track demarcated by hay bales. However, for the 1949 International Trophy meeting, it was decided to switch to the perimeter track. This arrangement was used for the 1950 and 1951 Grands Prix. In 1952 the start line was moved from the Farm Straight to the straight linking Woodcote and Copse corners, and this layout remained largely unaltered for the following 38 years. For the 1975 meeting a chicane was introduced to try to tame speeds through Woodcote Corner (although MotoGP would still use the circuit without the chicane up until 1986), and Bridge Corner was subtly rerouted in 1987. The track underwent a major redesign between the 1990 and 1991 races, transforming the ultra-fast track (where in, its last years, fourth or fifth gear, depending on the transmission of the car, was used for every corner except the Bridge chicane which was usually taken in second gear) into a more technical track. The reshaped track's first Formula One race was won by Nigel Mansell in front of his home crowd. On his victory lap back to the pits Mansell picked up stranded rival Ayrton Senna to give him a lift on his side-pod after his McLaren had run out of fuel on the final lap of the race. Following the deaths of Senna and fellow Grand Prix driver Roland Ratzenberger at Imola in 1994, many Grand Prix circuits were modified in order to reduce speed and increase driver safety. As a consequence of this the entry from Hangar Straight into Stowe Corner was modified in 1995 to improve the run off area. In addition, the flat-out Abbey kink was modified to a chicane in just 19 days ready for the 1994 Grand Prix. Parts of the circuit, such as the starting grid, are wide, complying with the latest safety guidelines. ===A lap in a Formula One car=== After a new pit building, the Silverstone Wing, was completed in time for the 2011 British Grand Prix, the starting grid for the full Grand Prix Circuit was relocated to between Club Corner and Abbey Corner. Almost flat out, the right-hander of Abbey leads immediately into the left-hander of Farm before cars brake heavily into the third-gear right-hander Village Corner. The even slower left-hander of the Loop comes immediately after, and leads into the flat-out left-hander of Aintree, before cars head down the DRS zone of the Wellington Straight, designed in 2010 to promote overtaking at the track. Turn 6, the left hander of Brooklands, is taken by drivers in second gear and leads immediately into Luffield, another second-gear curve, a right-hand hairpin. The right-handed kink of Woodcote leads cars down the old pit straight, before the difficult sixth-gear right-hander of Copse, with a minimum speed of 175 mph in the dry for Formula One cars. Then, the challenging complex of Maggotts, Becketts and Chapel ‚Äì a left‚Äìright‚Äìleft‚Äìright‚Äìleft complex with a minimum speed of 130 mph ‚Äì leads cars down the 770-metre Hangar Straight with the fifth-gear right-hander of Stowe at the end. The fifteenth turn of the track, Stowe, has a minimum speed of 125 mph and precedes a short straight, named Vale, which leads cars downhill towards the Club complex. Heavy braking is required for the left-hander of turn 16, and understeer can be an issue for the next right-handers of turns 17 and 18, as cars tentatively accelerate round to the start‚Äìfinish straight. === A lap on a MotoGP bike=== At the start of the lap, the bikes make a right turn into Copse, then head to Maggotts and Becketts, forcing the riders to lean six times. Next, the bikes blast down the Hangar straight, then brake down as they make their way to Stowe. Afterwards, they make a gentle left turn to the short Vale straight. At the end of the straight, riders lean again on the bikes to turn the bike at the chicane before making a right turn at the Club corner, where they pass the start/finish line of the current full starting grid, used by Formula One. After that, they make their way to turn 1 of the F1 starting grid, then make a left as they reach the gentle Farm left-hander. They brake as they reach Village and make another left as they reach The Loop, and make another left again as they arrive at the Aintree corner. The bikes then reach the final straight of the MotoGP circuit: Wellington. The most intense final lap battles happen in Brooklands, or in the second-to-the-last turn, Luffield. Finally, the bikes make their way to the Woodcote corner, and they complete the lap. ==History1940s=== With the termination of hostilities in Europe in 1945, the first motorsport event in the British Isles was held at Gransden Lodge in 1946 and the next on the Isle of Man, but there was nowhere permanent on the mainland which was suitable.Peter Swinger, Motor Racing Circuits in England : Then & Now (Ian Allan Publishing, , 2008) In 1948, Royal Automobile Club (RAC), under the chairmanship of Wilfred Andrews, set its mind upon running a Grand Prix and started to cast around public roads on the mainland. There was no possibility of closing the public highway as could happen on the Isle of Man, or the Channel Islands; it was a time of austerity and there was no question of building a new circuit from scratch, so some viable alternative had to be found. A considerable number of ex-RAF airfields existed, and it was to these the RAC turned their attention to with particular interest being paid to two near the centre of England ‚Äì Snitterfield near Stratford-upon-Avon and one behind the village of Silverstone. The latter was still under the control of the Air Ministry, but a lease was arranged in August 1948 and plans put into place to run the first British Grand Prix since the RAC last ran one at Brooklands in 1927 (those held at Donington Park in the late 1930s had the title of 'Donington Grand Prix'). In August 1948, Andrews employed James Brown on a three-month contact to create the Grand Prix circuit in less than two months. Nearly 40 years later, Brown died while still employed by the circuit. Despite possible concerns about the weather, the 1948 British Grand Prix began at Silverstone on Thursday 30 September 1948. The race took place on 2 October. The new circuit was marked out with oil drums and straw bales and consisted of the perimeter road and the runaways running into the centre of the airfield from two directions. Spectators were contained behind rope barriers and the officials were housed in tents. An estimated 100,000 spectators watched the race. There were no factory entries but Scuderia Ambrosiana sent two Maserati 4CLT/48s for Luigi Villoresi and Alberto Ascari who finished in that order (notwithstanding having started from the back of the grid of 25 cars) ahead of Bob Gerard in his ERA R14B/C. The race was 239 miles long and was run at an average speed of 72.28 mph. Fourth place went to Louis Rosier's Talbot-Lago T26, followed home by 'Bira' in another Maserati 4CLT/48. The second Grand Prix at Silverstone was scheduled for May 1949 and was officially designated the British Grand Prix. It was to use the full perimeter track with a chicane inserted at Club Corner. The length of the second circuit was exactly three miles and the race run over 100 laps, making it the longest post-war Grand Prix held in England. There were again 25 starters and victory went to a 'San Remo' Maserati 4CLT/48, this time in the hands of Toulo de Graffenried, from Bob Gerard in his familiar ERA and Louis Rosier in a 4¬Ω-litre Talbot-Lago. The race average speed had risen to 77.31 mph. The attendance was estimated at anything up to 120,000. Also in 1949, the first running took place of what was to become an institution at Silverstone, the International Trophy sponsored by the Daily Express and which become virtually a second Grand Prix. The first International Trophy was run on 20 August in two heats and a final. Victory in heat one went to Prince Birabongse ('Bira') and the second to Giuseppe Farina ‚Äì both driving Maserati 4CLT/48s, but the final went to a Ferrari Tipo 125 driven by Alberto Ascari from Farina, with Luigi Villoresi third in another Ferrari. For this meeting, the chicane at Club Corner was dispensed with and the circuit took up a shape that was to last for 25 years. ===1950s=== The 1950 British Grand Prix was a significant occasion for two reasons: it was the first ever World Championship Grand Prix, carrying the title of the European Grand Prix; and the event was graced by the presence of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth ‚Äì the first and only time a reigning monarch has attended a motor race in Britain. The year was the institution of the World Championship for Driver, and Silverstone witnessed the first time that Alfa Romeo 158 'Alfettas' had been seen in England, and they took the first three places in the hands of Giuseppe Farina, Luigi Fagioli and Reg Parnell, with the race average having increased to 90.96 mph; however the race distance had been reduced to 205 miles. 1951 was memorable for it saw the defeat of the Alfas, with victory going to the popular Argentinian driver, Froil√°n Gonz√°lez driving the Ferrari 375. His fellow countryman Juan Manuel Fangio was second in an Alfa Romeo 159B, and Luigi Villoresi in another Ferrari 375 was third. The race distance had increased to 263 miles, and the race average speed was now 96.11 mph. 1951 also saw the British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC) take over the lease from the RAC, and set about making the circuit into something more permanent. The International Trophy attracted the cream of Formula One, including the seemingly invincible Alfas, driven by Fangio and Farina. However, the weather worsened for the final and visibility was almost nil, and in those conditions the Alfettas with their supercharged engines were at a distinct disadvantage. When the race was abandoned after only six laps, Reg Parnell was in the lead in the \\"Thinwall Special\\"; no official winner was declared. In 1952, the RAC decided it no longer wished to run the circuit, and on 1 January the lease was taken on by the BRDC, with James Brown continuing as track manager. The lease covered only the perimeter track and other areas at specific times. The original pits between Abbey and Woodcote were demolished, and new pit facilities were constructed between Woodcote and Copse. Coinciding with the BRDC taking over the running of the Grand Prix, there was a little unrest within the sport which led to the downgrading of Grand Prix racing to Formula Two, which was won by Alberto Ascari at 90.9 mph from his Ferrari teammate Piero Taruffi ‚Äì both driving the Tipo 500. The podium was completed by Mike Hawthorn driving a Cooper-Bristol T12. The International Trophy was notable in 1952, in that it saw a rare victory for Hersham and Walton Motors when Lance Macklin had a win. The same situation continued into 1953 with the World Championship being run for Formula Two cars. The race was a straight fight between the Maserati and Ferrari teams, with victory going to Ascari at 92.9 mph aboard a Ferrari Tipo 500, from the Maserati A6GCM of Fangio and another Tipo 500 of Farina. The racecard included a Formula Libre race which put the Grand Prix into perspective; Farina drove the Thinwall Special to victory at a higher speed than the actual GP, setting the first lap record at over 100 mph, at 100.16 mph. The 1954 Grand Prix season was the new 2.5-litre Formula One and had attracted interest from some major players. Lancia had joined the fray with their D50, and Daimler-Benz were back; the appearance of Lancia meant that there were three Italian teams competing at the highest level, the others being Ferrari and Maserati. The British were catered for by the Owen Racing Organisation with their BRMs, the Vanwall of Tony Vandervell and Connaught still competing, while Cooper-Bristol were not to be forgotten. At the start of the season, Mercedes-Benz had swept all before them, but Silverstone was a d√©b√¢cle for the team, which returned to Untert√ºrkheim in defeat. The 263-mile race was won by Gonz√°lez from Hawthorn in the works 625s, with Onofre Marim√≥n third in the works Maserati 250F. The best Mercedes driver was pole-man Fangio in his W196. From 1955, the Grand Prix was alternated between Aintree and Silverstone, until 1964 when Brands Hatch took over as the alternative venue. By the time the Grand Prix returned to Silverstone in 1956, Mercedes-Benz had gone, as had Lancia as an independent entrant, the cars having been handed to Scuderia Ferrari, who ran them as 'Lancia-Ferraris'. The great Fangio scored his only British Grand Prix win in one of these cars. Second was another Lancia-Ferrari which had started the race in the hands of Alfonso de Portago, but was taken over by Peter Collins at half-distance and third place was Jean Behra in a Maserati 250F. Matters were somewhat happier for the British enthusiast at the International Trophy; a quality field had been attracted including Fangio and Collins in their Lancia-Ferraris, but the 13 laps of the race were led by the new BRM P25 driven by Hawthorn. When the engine of the BRM expired, Stirling Moss in the Vanwall took over, going on to win. With the Lancias broken by the Brit, the rest of the podium was taken by the Connaughts of Archie Scott Brown and Desmond Titterington. For 1958 drastic rule changes were introduced into Formula One, Fangio had retired and Maserati had withdrawn due to financial difficulties. Throughout the season the battle was between Ferrari and Vanwall and it was fervently hoped that Vandervell would success at home but it was not to be; the green cars fell apart, Stuart Lewis- Evans the best placed finisher in fourth. Victory went to Collins from Hawthorn, both driving Ferrari Dino 246s. The crowd of 120,000 witnessed a hat-trick of English drivers on the podium with Roy Salvadori coming home third in one of John Cooper's Coventry-Climax rear-engined powered cars. ===1960s=== Piers Courage on his way to 5th place in the 1969 British Grand Prix, aboard Frank Williams Racing Cars's Brabham-Cosworth BT26A At the British Grand Prix of 1960, the front-engined cars were completely outclassed, the podium going to the Coventry-Climax-powered cars, with victory going to Jack Brabham in the works Cooper T53 from John Surtees and Innes Ireland in their Lotus 18s. Although the race is remembered as the race lost by Graham Hill, rather than won by Brabham. Hill stalled his BRM on the grid, left the line in last place, then proceeded to carve through the whole field. Once in the lead, the BRM was troubled by fading brakes which led to Hill spinning off at Copse Corner. 1961 was the year of the new 1.5 litre Formula One introduced by the governing body on safety grounds ‚Äì it met with strong opposition in Britain which gave birth to the short-lived 'Inter-Continental Formula', which extended the life of the now-obsolete Formula One cars. The International Trophy was run to this Formula and produced a notable first and last ‚Äì the first and only appearance of the American Scarab and the last appearance of the Vanwall, in the hands of Surtees. The race was wet and Moss demonstrated his supreme prowess in Rob Walker's Cooper by lapping all but Brabham twice. In 1962, the second year of the Formula, the International Trophy was run for the 1.5 litre cars. This was the classic occasion when Hill in the BRM crossed the finishing line almost sideways to snatch victory from Jim Clark's Lotus 24; both drivers were credited with the same race time. Clark was to win the British Grand Prix when it returned to Silverstone in 1963, driving the Lotus- Climax 25. By now, even Ferrari had succumbed to the rear-engined layout, but sent only one to Northamptonshire for Surtees (Ferrari 156). He finished second, ahead of three BRM P57's of Hill, Richie Ginther and Lorenzo Bandini. For the 1965 season, BRM had taken a chance and signed Jackie Stewart straight from Formula Three; the International Trophy was only his fourth Formula One race, but despite this he won handsomely from Surtees in the Ferrari. When the Formula One returned for the British Grand Prix later that year, Stewart finished a creditable fifth. Fellow Scot, Clark won the race in his Lotus- Climax 33 from the BRM P261 of Hill and the Ferrari of Surtees. The following year, the new 3-litre Formula One was heralded as the \\"Return of Power\\", however the first Grand Prix under these regulations was held at Brands Hatch. It was not until 1967 that the big-engined cars came to Northamptonshire. The result remained unchanged, with Clark winning in the Lotus-Cosworth 49 at a race average speed of 117.6 mph. Second was Kiwi Denny Hulme aboard the Brabham-Repco, from the Ferrari 312 of his fellow countrymen Chris Amon. There was a frightening increase in race average speed in 1969, for it rose by 10 mph, to 127.2 mph when Stewart won in his Matra-Cosworth MS80 from Jacky Ickx (Brabham-Cosworth BT26) and Bruce McLaren driving one of his own Cosworth- powered M7Cs. ===1970s=== Niki Lauda taking the Ferrari 312T through Maggotts Copse during 1975 John Player Grand Prix, Silverstone By 1971, the 3-litre era was now into its fifth season; it was also the year when sponsorship came to the fore. Ken Tyrrell became a constructor and Jackie Stewart won at Silverstone driving the Tyrrell 003 on his way to a second World Championship. Ronnie Peterson was second in March 711 from Emerson Fittipaldi in Lotus 72D; all were Cosworth-powered in what fast becoming Formula Super Ford; the race average was 130.5 mph. 1973 was the year that Jody Scheckter lost control of his McLaren at the completion of the first lap, spinning into the pit wall and setting in motion the biggest accident ever seen on a British motor racing circuit. The race was stopped on lap two and the carnage cleared away; it speaks highly for the construction of the cars that only one driver was injured. The race was won Scheckter's teammate, Peter Revson (McLaren M23-Cosworth) from Peterson (Lotus 72E) and Denny Hulme (McLaren M23). The race average speed had risen again to 131.75 mph. The 1973 d√©b√¢cle wrought changes upon Silverstone as it was deemed necessary to slow these cars through Woodcote, therefore a chicane was inserted. \\"Formula Super Ford\\" reached its peak in 1975, when 26 of the 28 entries were Cosworth-powered, there being just two Ferraris to challenge them. Tom Pryce placed his Shadow DN5 on pole for the 1975 Grand Prix, but an accident destroyed his chances as the race was run in appalling weather and it was stopped at two-thirds distance, following multiple cars crashing on the very wet circuit. Victory went to Fittipaldi (McLaren M23) from Carlos Pace (Brabham BT44B) and Scheckter (Tyrrell 007). International motor racing at Silverstone is not concerned solely to Formula One, however, and 1976 saw one of the closest finished in endurance racing during the Silverstone Six-Hour race, which was a round of the World Championship for Makes. The series was almost a German benefit that season as the main contenders were the Porsche 935s and BMW 3-litre CSLs (common known as the 'Batmobiles'). Porsche had had the upper hand in the opening rounds of the series, but at Silverstone things were different. John Fitzpatrick and Tom Walkinshaw kept their BMW ahead to win by 197 yards (1.18secs) from the Bob Wollek/Hans Heyer Porsche 935 Turbo. Third was a Porsche 934 Turbo in the hands of Leo Kinnunen and Egon Evertz. The 1977 British Grand Prix saw the beginning of a revolution in Formula One, for towards the back of the grid was the product of R√®gie Renault which was exploiting a rule in F1 regulations that allowed the use of 1.5-litre turbocharged engines. The Renault RS01 expired early in the race. Ulsterman John Watson had an early battle with James Hunt, but the fuel system in Watson's Brabham-Alfa Romeo let him down and the winner Hunt (McLaren M26) won at a speed of 130.36, with Niki Lauda second for Ferrari from Gunnar Nilsson in a Lotus. Once the most prestigious race of the motorcycle calendar, the Isle of Man TT had been increasingly boycotted by the top riders, and finally succumbed to pressure and was dropped, being replaced by the British Motorcycle Grand Prix. 1977 marked the beginning of this era, and Silverstone was the chosen venue. It took place on 14 August, with Pat Hennen riding a Suzuki RG500 to victory from Steve Baker (Yamaha).Chris Carter, \\"Motocourse 1977‚Äì1979\\" (Hazleton Securities Ltd, , 1979) The International Trophy attracted World Championship contenders for the last time in 1978 but the race witnessed the d√©but of the epoch-making Lotus 79 in the hands of Mario Andretti. Such events as this gave the Formula One also-rans a chance to start, which they were normally denied in Grands Prix; two such were the Theodore and Fittipaldi. Keke Rosberg won the former in atrocious conditions from Fittipaldi in his namesake car. Jochen Mass (Martini Racing Porsche 935) during the 1976 Silverstone Six-Hours 14 May witnessed the running of the Silverstone Six-Hours, a round of the World Championship for Makes. A 3.2-litre Porsche 935 won in the hands of Jacky Ickx and Jochen Mass from a 3.0-litre version driven by Wollek and Henri Pescarolo; third and fourth were BMW 320s handled by Harald Grohs/Eddy Joosen and Freddy Kottulinsky/Markus Hotz. The race was run over 235 laps of the Grand Prix circuit to make a total of a little over 689 miles which the winning car covered at 114.914 mph. Come the 1979 Grand Prix and the passage of two years had made a great difference to the performance of the turbocharged Renaults; the car which qualified on the last row in 1977 was now on the front row beside Alan Jones in the Williams FW07. When Jones's Cosworth expired, his teammate Clay Regazzoni moved into the lead, going on to win from Ren√© Arnoux in the Renault RS10 with Jean-Pierre Jarier third in the Tyrrell 009. The winners average speed was 138.80 mph. The 1979 British Motorcycle Grand Prix was again held at Silverstone and would be one of the closest races in the history of Motorcycle Grand Prix racing. The 1978 winner Kenny Roberts and the pair of works Suzuki riders, Barry Sheene and Wil Hartog broke away from the rest of the field. After a few laps, Hartog fell off the pace as Sheene and Roberts continued to swap the lead throughout the 28-lap event, the American winning for the second time ahead of Sheene by a narrow margin of just three- hundreds of a second. ===1980s=== John Watson's 1981 British Grand Prix race winning McLaren, during the 2011 Silverstone Classic meeting In May 1980, World Championship for Makes ‚Äì sports cars in other words ‚Äì returned in form of the Silverstone Six-Hours, which was won by Alain de Cadenet driving a car bearing his own name, partnered by Desir√© Wilson; the 235 laps (687 miles) being completed at 114.602 mph. The only other to complete the full race distance was the Siegfried Brunn/J√ºrgen Barth (Porsche 908/3), with a Porsche 935K Turbo driven by John Paul and Brian Redman third, a lap down. The passage of a further two years saw the arrival of the one-one-one grid in 1981, albeit staggered in two rows. The turbocharged era had arrived for not only did Renault occupy the front row of the grid, but turbo-engined Ferraris were fourth and eighth. The Renaults dominated the race, but total reliability was still lacking and the day went to John Watson in a McLaren MP4/1. Second place went to Carlos Reutemann in the Williams FW07C from the Talbot-Ligier JS17 of Jacques Laffite, a lap down; the race speed was down a little at 137.64 mph. For 1982, endurance sport car racing entered a rejuvenated phrase with the coming of Group C; the BRDC and l'Automobile Club de l'Ouest instituted a joint Silverstone/Le Mans Challenge Trophy. The trophy eventually went to Jacky Ickx and Derek Bell in a Porsche 956, but at Silverstone they could not make maximum use of the fuel allowance and victory went to the Lancia LC1 of Riccardo Patrese and Michele Alboreto. The winning car completed the 240 laps at a speed of 128.5 mph, with the second-place car three laps adrift, that of Ickx/Bell. The final podium place went to the Joest Racing Porsche 936C Turbo of Bob Wollek/Jean-Michel Martin/Philippe Martin. The big sports cars returned to Northamptonshire on 8 May 1983 to contest the Silverstone 1000 kilometres, which was a round of the newly instigated World Endurance Championship. It was a Porsche benefit with Derek Bell and Stefan Bellof bringing their 956 home ahead of Wollek and Stefan Johansson in an identical car ‚Äì in fact 956s filled the first five places. In the 1983 British Grand Prix, the first Cosworth- powered car was in 13th place on the grid, all the cars ahead of it were being powered by turbocharged engines. Fuel consumption of the turbos was heavy and refuelling mid-race had become de rigueur, the mechanics now playing as important part as the drivers. With the ever-increasing power, speeds were continually on the up and in practice Ren√© Arnoux became the first person to lap the circuit in under 1:10.000 with a time of 1:09.462 in his Ferrari 126C3, a lap at over 150 mph. In the race, the lap record was raised to over 140 mph by Frenchman Alain Prost who won the race in the Renault RE40 at an average speed of 139.218 mph, from Nelson Piquet in the Brabham-BMW BT52B and Patrick Tambay in a Ferrari. Finishing fourth, also using Renault power, was the Lotus 94T of future British hero, Nigel Mansell. The 1985 International Trophy (run 24 March) saw the race again make history, as it was the inaugural event under the regulations for the new International Formula 3000. Kiwi racer Mike Thackwell wrote himself into the record books by winning the International Trophy for the third time, and the first F3000 race in the process, driving a Ralt RT20 from John Nielsen in a similar car. The lower step on the podium went a March 85B driven by Michel Fert√©. Six weeks later, the big sports cars returned for the Silverstone 1000 km. This turned out to be a Porsche benefit, the Stuttgart cars taking the five of the top six placings in the shape of four 962Cs and a 956. The winners were the works pairing of Ickx/Mass from their teammates Bell and Hans Stuck but third was the Lancia-Martini of Patrese and Alessandro Nannini. Keke Rosberg driving the Williams FW10 at the 1985 German Grand Prix. Rosberg lapped Silverstone at over 160mph, during qualifying for the 1985 British Grand Prix The 1985 British Grand Prix saw Keke Rosberg in his Williams FW10-Honda set a qualifying lap at over 160 mph. Three others clocked an average lap speed of over 159 mph. Making Rosberg's lap even more remarkable was that he had a deflating rear tyre and the track was still slightly damp from the rain that hit the circuit during the day. The turbo era had reached its zenith. This was a peak in the history of Silverstone and while Prost put the new lap record up to 150.035 mph, like most races of the era it was something of an economy run as the FIA had limited fuel capacities (220 litres per car per race). Prost went on the win in the race, in the McLaren MP4/2B, at an average of 146.246 mph from the Ferrari 156/85 of Alboreto and the Ligier JS25 of Laffite. The International season opened on 13 April with the first round of the Intercontinental F3000 Championship. The first home was Pascal Fabr√© with a Lola T86/50 from Emanuele Pirro (March) and Nielsen (Ralt). In 1986, the Silverstone 1000 km run on 5 May was a round of the World Endurance Championship, which Silk Cut Jaguar (Tom Walkinshaw Racing) won in a year when everything did not exactly go their way. However, the Derek Warwick/Eddie CheeverXJR9 was the only car to complete the distance of 212 laps, at a speed of 129.05 mph. The Stuck/Bell Porsche 962C was two laps down in second place, with a 962C a further three laps adrift in the hands of Jo Gartner and Tiff Needell. Someone had become rather more than a little concerned over the 160 mph lap in 1985, for by the time the Grand Prix returned in Silverstone in 1987, a new corner was inserted before Woodcote which changed the character of the circuit. However, the first International meeting in 1987 was the initial round of the Intercontinental F3000 Championship on 12 April. The race was run at 103.96 mph, the winner being Maur√≠cio Gugelmin in a Ralt from Michel Troll√© in a Lola and Roberto Moreno aboard another Ralt. Things went somewhat better for Jaguar in 1987 for they won the Silverstone 1000 km, their fourth successive win in the World Sports Car Championship ‚Äì the XJR8s putting on a truly impressive demonstration to take a one-two finish. The first car home was that of Cheever and Raul Boesel, followed by Jan Lammers and Watson, with the Porsche 962C of Stuck and Bell third; these three crews covered the whole lap distance of 210 laps of the full GP circuit, the winning Jaguar averaging 123.42 mph. And so to the 1987 British Grand Prix, the event now firmly established at Silverstone. The first two placings were a repeat of the 1986 race at Brands Hatch, Mansell winning from his Williams-Honda teammate Piquet at 146.208 mph and Ayrton Senna in the Lotus-Honda. The race will always be remembered the inter-team rivalry of the Williams pairing. Following a late pit stop in a bid to cure a vibration in the car, Mansell found himself 16.8secs behind Piquet with only 17 laps to go. But Mansell proceeded to eat into Piquet's lead ‚Äì more than a second per lap ‚Äì until with five laps to go the gap was only 1.6 seconds. With two laps to go Mansell slipstreamed Piquet down the Hangar Straight, jinked left and then dived right to pass Piquet into Stowe. To a tumultuous reception, Mansell went on to win the race. 1987 saw the inaugural World Touring Car Championship arrive at Silverstone. Luis P√©rez-Sala had a meeting no one would believe; he led the race until the penultimate lap, with nearly one minute lead, but then his Bigazzi-entered BMW M3 retired. He wasn't even sure that the car would start the race after Olivier Grouillard rolled the car in practice. However, the Munich marque still took victory when the CiBiEmme Sport's M3 finished first, in the hands of Enzo Calderari and Fabio Mancini. The Schnitzer M3 of Roberto Ravaglia, Roland Ratzenberger and Pirro managed to finished second, ahead of the Alfa Romeo 75 Turbo of Giorgio Francia and Nicola Larini. The 1988 race was won at 124.142 mph, the dramatic reduction in race speed is attributable to the monsoon-like conditions, the entire race being run in pouring rain. Senna splashed his way to victory abroad his McLaren from Mansell (Williams) and Nannini (Benetton). The 1988 Silverstone 1000 km saw Cheever take a hat-trick of victories for Jaguar, this time partnered by Martin Brundle. The XJR9 won at 128.02 mph from the Sauber-Mercedes C9 driven by Jean-Louis Schlesser and Mass. The second Sauber driven by Mauro Baldi and James Weaver, was third, two laps down, while third on the road was the Porsche 962C of Bell and Needell which was disqualified for an oversize fuel tank. April at Silverstone is not the warmest place to be but nonetheless F3000 contingent contested the first round of the 1989 International F3000 Championship. Thomas Danielsson won at the wheel of a Reynard 89D, at a speed of 131.56 mph. Second by 0.5secs was Philippe Favre in a Lola T89/50 from Mark Blundell and Jean Alesi in Reynards. Mid-July is the traditional time for the British Grand Prix and on the 16th, over 90,000 spectators converged upon the circuit to see Prost score his 38th GP win in the McLaren-Honda MP4/5, at 143.694 mph. Mansell brought the Ferrari 641 into second place from Nannini's Benetton. ===1990s=== Nigel Mansell gives Ayrton Senna a lift back to the pits on the side-pod of his Williams FW14 The weekend of 19/20 May 1990 was a busy one at Silverstone, for on the Saturday, a round of the FIA F3000 Championship was run on the Grand Prix circuit, and on the Sunday the contenders in the World Sports-Prototype Championship had their turn. In the F3000 race, Scotland's Allan McNish led √ârik Comas home from Marco Apicella. The first two were Lola-Mugen T90/50 mounted, while the third-placed car was a Reynard-Mugen 90D. The sports cars again ran over 300 miles, contesting the Shell BRDC Empire Trophy. The first three places went to British cars, with Jaguar first and second from a Spice-Cosworth in the hands of Ferm√≠n V√©lez and Bruno Giacomelli. The winning Jaguar XJR11 of Martin Brundle and Michel Fert√© was the only to run the full distance of 101 laps, lapping even the second-placed XJR11 of Jan Lammers and Andy Wallace. And so to July, and the British Grand Prix. Once again, it was over 190 miles and was won at 145.253 mph. Alain Prost was now driving for Ferrari and his victory was rounded by Thierry Boutsen in the Williams in second, and Ayrton Senna's McLaren in third. After the Grand Prix, it had already been decided to extensively redesign Silverstone's layout. Nearly every part of Silverstone (except Copse, Abbey and all of the straights, save the Farm Straight) was redesigned. The ultra-high speed Club and Stowe corners were made slower and a chicane was placed before Stowe. Maggotts, Becketts and Chapel were re- designed as very fast snaky esses that proved to be even more challenging than the original series of corners ‚Äì the considerable amount of lateral acceleration change from side to side became the highlighted challenge of the new circuit. A new twisty infield section called Luffield was created in place of the Farm straight and the Bridge chicane. Despite these alterations, the Grand Prix and World Sportscar circuses both very much approved of the new layout: Silverstone was still fast, which is what it has always been known for. When the Group C cars returned in 1991, they raced for the World Sports Car Championship, but the race distance was reduced to 269 miles (83 laps of the GP circuit) and it was a straight battle between Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz, with victory going to the Jaguar XJR14 of Teo Fabi and Derek Warwick at a speed of 122.048 mph. In second place, four laps behind, came the Mercedes C291 of Michael Schumacher and Karl Wendlinger, followed by the singleton driver XJR14 of Brundle. July came, and with it came, of course, the Grand Prix. The almost unbelievably popular victory was Nigel Mansell's 18th Grand Prix win, making him the most successful English driver ever. Only two other drivers completed the full race distance: Gerhard Berger for McLaren and Prost for Ferrari. 1992 was once more a very busy International season for Silverstone with a round of the International F3000 Championship, the World Sports Car Championship, and of course, the Grand Prix. The first two were run on the same day, 10 May. Although the practice was spoilt by hailstorm, the races were run in bright weather. The F3000 victor was Jordi Gen√© who completed the 37 laps at a speed of 121.145 mph in a Reynard-Mugen 92D, from a similar Judd-engined example in the hands of Rubens Barrichello. Lola-Cosworth were third and fourth, driven by Olivier Panis and Emanuele Naspetti. The sports car race was a sad affair, with but a handful of cars coming to the grid. There were 11 starters and just five finishers. The race was won by the Peugeot 905 of Warwick and Yannick Dalmas at 122.661 mph, two laps ahead of the Maurizio Sandro Sala/Johnny Herbert Mazda MXR-01 which was four laps ahead of the Lola-Judd T92/10 driven by J√©sus Pareja and Stefan Johansson. At the end of the season, the World Sports Car Championship was no more. The Grand Prix was a happier affair with Williams-Renaults of Mansell and Riccardo Patrese taking top honours from the Benettons of Brundle and Schumacher. Mansell dominated practice and the race, winning at 133.772 mph. Six days after competing at Donington Park, the F3000 guys were at Silverstone for the second round of the 1993 International F3000 Championship. Gil de Ferran won at 119.462 mph from David Coulthard and Michael Bartels ‚Äì all were driving Cosworth powered Reynard 93Ds. Despite back-to-back Grand Prix victories for Williams, Mansell would not be back in 1993 to try for a famous hat-trick as he was racing in the States. However, things looked good his replacement, Damon Hill after he set fastest time in practice, but Prost (now at Williams) pipped him to pole by just 0.128secs and he went on to win the race after Hill's engine exploded 18 laps from home. Second and third were the Benettons of Schumacher and Patrese. A year later, the Grand Prix was a race of controversy which rumbled on for most of the season: Hill was barely ahead of Schumacher on the grid and on the formation lap the young German sprinted ahead of the Englishmen which was not allowed under the rules (cars were required to maintain station during the formation lap). The race authorities informed Benetton that their man had been penalised 5 seconds for his transgression but they did not realise that it was a stop/go penalty and did not call Schumacher in, so he was black-flagged. Schumacher ignored the black flag for six laps, and for failing to respond to the black flag Schumacher was disqualified, having finished second on the road. Hill won the race at 125.609 mph from Jean Alesi in the Ferrari and Mika H√§kkinen in the McLaren. The 1994 F3000 race was an all Reynard 94D affair. The 38-lap race was won by Franck Lagorce winning at 119.512 mph, from Coulthard and de Ferran. The race distance for the following season had increased by two. Victorious on this occasion was Riccardo Rosset driving Super Nova's Reynard-Cosworth AC 95D. His teammate Vincenzo Sospiri finished second, while Allan McNish was third in a Zytek-Judd KV-engined 95D. Johnny Herbert winning the 1995 British Grand Prix, driving the Benetton-Renault B195 Hill and Schumacher were not having a happy 1995 and managed to take each other off after the final pit stops, leaving Coulthard in the lead which he lost when he had to take a 10 sec 'stop/go' penalty for speeding in the pit lane. All of this left Herbert to take his maiden Grand Prix win ‚Äì he was euphoric and was held shoulder high on the podium by the second and third-placed men, Coulthard and Alesi. On 12 May 1996, the Northamptonshire circuit hosted a round of the International BPR series which was very a British affair. First was the McLaren F1 GTR of Andy Wallace and Olivier Grouillard followed by the Jan Lammers/Perry McCarthy Lotus Esprit and another McLaren in the hands of James Weaver and Ray Bellm. At the Grand Prix on 14 July, the pressures on Hill as national favourite and son of a famous father (Graham Hill) were not inconsiderable, but he responded well, setting pole. Unfortunately he muffed the start and later spun out of contention when a front wheel nut became loose, and his teammate Jacques Villeneuve went on to win at a fraction over 124 mph, from Berger's Benetton and the McLaren of H√§kkinen. The 1997 Grand Prix was again won by Villeneuve at the wheel of a Williams-Renault at a speed of 128.443 mph from the Benettons of Alesi and Alexander Wurz. From the start of 1998, the FIA decreed that all Formula One grids must be straight: in order to comply with this, the RAC moved the start line forward at Silverstone but not, significantly, the finish line. This led to some confusion at the end of the Grand Prix, which was scheduled for 60 laps, but was effectively 59.95 laps: it was more than a little fortunate that the timing was being taken from the finish line and not the start line as the winning car was in the pits at the end of the race and the Ferrari pit was situated between the two lines. The chequered flag is supposed to be waved at the winning car and then showed to the other competitors, but it was waved at the second man who thought that he had won! Victory went to Schumacher at the wheel of a Ferrari in appalling conditions. It was something of a farce, for in addition to the pit lane confusion, he was penalised 10sec for passing another racer under a yellow flag. The stewards failed to inform the teams of their decision in the proper manner so Schumacher took his stop go penalty in the pits, after the race was over! McLaren appealed to the FIA, but the appeal was rejected and the results were confirmed, with H√§kkinen second in the McLaren and Eddie Irvine third in the second Ferrari. Victory in the 1999 British Grand Prix went to Coulthard at the wheel of a McLaren-Mercedes with an average speed of 124.256 mph from Irvine's Ferrari and the other Schumacher, Ralf. Fernando Alonso during the 2005 British Grand Prix in his Renault For Silverstone's first Grand Prix of the 21st Century, the FIA decreed that the race should be moved to April, and the event took place over Easter, with the GP itself run on Easter Sunday. In hindsight this was a poor decision by the FIA, who failed to take into account the unpredictable weather in Britain at this time of year. It rained almost continually for the best part of three weeks before the event and most of Good Friday; by Easter Saturday the car parks had virtually collapsed and were completely closed. Although most of the race day itself was fine, the damage was done and many thousands of spectators were unable to get to Silverstone to witness David Coulthard win his second straight victory in the event, from his McLaren teammate Mika H√§kkinen, with Michael Schumacher third for Ferrari. On 14 May, the FIA GT Championship came to Northants, in slightly more clement conditions and victory went to Julian Bailey and Jamie Campbell-Walter driving a Lister Storm GT from no fewer than four Chrysler Viper GTS-Rs. The 2000 Silverstone 500 USA Challenge was the first American Le Mans Series race to be held outside of North America. It served as a precursor to the creation of the European Le Mans Series by gauging the willingness of European teams from the FIA Sportscar Championship and FIA GT Championship to participate in a series identical to the American Le Mans Series. This event also shared the weekend at Silverstone with an FIA GT round, with some GT teams running both events. The race was won by the Schnitzer Motorsport's BMW V12 LMP of J√∂rg M√ºller and JJ Lehto. Formula One returned for the 2001 British Grand Prix in July to see H√§kkinen triumph having managing to overtake the driver in pole, Schumacher. Schumacher, driving for Ferrari finished second while teammate Barrichello gained the final spot in the podium. The 2002 British Grand Prix saw Ferrari return to the top two steps of the podium with Schumacher beating Barrichello, while pole-sitter and Williams driver Juan Pablo Montoya finished in third. These three drivers, as well as gaining the top three qualifying places, were the only drivers to finish on the lead lap. Although the 2003 Grand Prix was won by pole-sitter Barrichello for Ferrari, the race is probably most remember for a track invasion by the defrocked priest, Neil Horan, who ran along Hangar Straight, head-on to the 175 mph train of cars, wearing a saffron kilt and waving religious banners. Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen (McLaren) was pressured by Barrichello into losing the lead and an unforced error later on allowed Montoya to seize second. Neil Hodgson had a brilliant World Superbike meeting in 2003. The Fila Ducati rider withstood the attention of James Toseland in the first race and then fellow Ducati pilot, Gregorio Lavilla in the second, just 0.493secs ahead of the Spaniard. Rub√©n Xaus claimed two third-place finishes. Schumacher celebrated his 80th Grand Prix victory of his career at the 2004 event after taking the lead from R√§ikk√∂nen during the first round of pit stops. Ferrari's strategy won the day with Schumacher's two stops to R√§ikk√∂nen's three. Barrichello completed the podium in third, and coming home in fourth was BAR's Jenson Button. A crowd of 68,000 saw Renegade Ducati's Noriyuki Haga and Ten Kate Honda's Chris Vermeulen take a win each in the 2004 World Superbike event. Haga pulled off a close finish in race one, just beating Vermeulen. In race two, the roles were reversed with the Honda beating the Ducati. When the Le Mans Prototypes returned in 2004, they raced for the Le Mans Series over a distance of 1000 km. It was a straight battle between the pair of Audi R8's of Audi Sport UK Team Veloqx and Team Goh's singleton R8, with victory going to the Veloqx pair of Allan McNish and Pierre Kaffer. In second place, one lap behind was Rinaldo Capello and Seiji Ara for Team Goh, followed by the all English pair of Johnny Herbert and Jamie Davies for Veloqx. A crowd of 27,000 welcomed back the World Touring Car Championship. The Alfa Romeo drivers dominated the first race, on a sunny 15 May 2005. Gabriele Tarquini scored a lights to flag victory, leading home an Alfa quartet. Behind the Italian, a tough fight for second between James Thompson and Fabrizio Giovanardi, with a number of overtaking and paint swapping moves, also involving the BMW 320i of Andy Priaulx. Augusto Farfus completed the quartet, with Priaulx dropping back to fifth. After a superb start, Priaulx led most of race two, until side-lined with a puncture. This enabled the SEAT duo of Rickard Rydell and Jason Plato to take the win for the Spanish manufacturer, with Tarquini in third. Ducati took both legs of the 2005 World Superbike double-header. Regis Laconi scored the first win and Toseland doubled Ducati's pleasure. Laconi beat Troy Corser to the finishing line by 0.096secs. Toseland claimed third on the podium. Toseland turn came to Race 2, when he passed Croser and Haga. Fernando Alonso and Montoya fought a cat-and- mouse battle for the victory in the 2005 British Grand Prix, with the deciding factor being the back-markers. In a straight line the McLaren of Montoya was probably quicker than Alonso's Renault, but in the heat of battle, with different strategies going and different computer projections, Montoya came through to win the race from Alonso, with R√§ikk√∂nen driving for McLaren in third. In the 2005 Le Mans Series race, Team ORECA Audi R8 scored a prestigious victory, with McNish, this time paired with St√©phane Ortelli, winning after a thrilling race-long battle with the Creation Autosportif's DBA 03S of Nicolas Minassian and Campbell-Walter, a car that provided much of the season's excitement. Alonso would see the chequered flag first as he wins again at Silverstone in 2006. In doing so, the Spaniard became the youngest driver to get the hat-trick (pole position, winning and fastest lap). Alonso won by nearly 14 seconds from Schumacher and R√§ikk√∂nen took third again. Troy Bayliss gained a pair of wins in the 2006 World Superbike, aboard his Xerox Ducati. Haga (Yamaha) and Toseland (Honda) joined Bayliss on the podium in both races. Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen piloting his Ferrari to victory in the 2007 British Grand Prix Following Hamilton's victory in the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix, Silverstone reported that ticket sales had \\"gone through the roof\\"; circuit director Ian Phillips added, \\"we haven't seen this level of interest since Mansell-mania in the late 80s and early 90s\\". Hamilton did not disappoint on the Saturday and qualified his McLaren on pole. However, race day saw R√§ikk√∂nen move ahead during the first round of pit stops. The other McLaren driver, Alonso, also finished ahead in second. Bayliss (Ducati) took the chequered flag in a solitary 2007 World Superbike race, with a heavy downpour causing the first race to be run in the wet, with Race 2 cancelled altogether. Naga and Corser completed the podium line-up. After a one-year hiatus, the Le Mans Series returned to Silverstone. At the head of the field, the Team Peugeot 908 HDi's lead was unchallenged and Minassian achieved his goal to do one better, partnered by Marc Gen√©. Emmanuel Collard/Jean-Christophe Boullion finished two laps down in second. Third place on the podium was for the Rollcentre Pescarolo, piloted by Stuart Hall and Joao Barbosa. Hamilton made amends in the 2008 British Grand Prix, when he crossed the line to win by 68 seconds, from Nick Heidfeld (BMW-Sauber). The margin of victory was the largest in Formula One since 1995. Once again, Barrichello finished on the podium, this time in a Honda. Allan McNish driving the Audi R10 during the 2008 Le Mans Series race A spirited drive from the 2008 Le Mans winners Rinaldo Capello and McNish saw their Audi R10 TDI progress through the field after a trip in the gravel early in the race, all the way up to second behind their sister car. When the leading Audi came in for an unplanned pit stop and was pulled into the pit for some rear suspension repairs, this handed the lead to McNish and Capello, who took a well deserved win. The Charouz Lola-Aston Martin B08/60 was second, driven by Jan Charouz and Stefan M√ºcke. The Pescarolo of Romain Dumas and Boullion got a well deserved podium finish. The 2009 British Grand Prix at Silverstone was due to be the last in Northamptonshire, as the event was moving to Donington Park from the 2010 season. The race was won by Sebastian Vettel for Red Bull Racing, 15.1secs ahead of his teammate Mark Webber. A further 25.9secs behind was that regular visitor to the podium, Barrichello, in his Brawn. However, due to Donington Park funding issues, the Grand Prix would remain at Silverstone until at least 2019. The 2009 1000 km of Silverstone saw Oreca take the chequered flag with the aid of their drivers Olivier Panis and Nicolas Lapierre. The next three cars home were also on the lead lap after 195 laps of racing, with second place going to Speedy Racing's Lola-Aston Martin B08/60 of Marcel F√§ssler, Andrea Belicchi and Nicolas Prost. The newer Lola-Aston Martin B09/60 of Aston Martin Racing took the next two places, with the partnership of Tom√°≈° Enge, Charouz and M√ºcke claiming the final step on the podium. ===2010s=== Fernando Alonso's Ferrari F150 Italia in the pit lane, in the Formula One 2011 British Grand Prix Mark Webber (Red Bull) claimed the silverware in the 2010 British Grand Prix, just over a second ahead of McLaren's Hamilton. Nico Rosberg claimed third place for Mercedes team. The FIM World Superbike Championship round at Silverstone in 2010 will go down in history as being totally dominated by British riders. In both race, the top step was the property of Yamaha Sterilgarda's Cal Crutchlow. Also, second in both races was Jonathan Rea. Alstare Suzuki's Leon Haslam and Aprilla's Leon Camier made appearances in the top three, giving Britain a complete podium sweep of the event. Cal Crutchlow on his way to a double win, in the 2010 World Superbike event The 2010 British motorcycle Grand Prix returned to Silverstone for the first time since 1986, although the category had evolved into MotoGP. Jorge Lorenzo dominated the event for Fiat Yamaha, finishing nearly seven seconds clear of a battle for second place. Andrea Dovizioso winning the battle for second for Repsol Honda, with the Tech 3 Yamaha of Ben Spies third, after passing fellow American Nicky Hayden on the last lap. The victory for Anthony Davidson and Minassian for Peugeot in the 2010 1000 km of Silverstone was but a small consolation for the disastrous Le Mans race but did wipe away the bad memories of Silverstone in 2008. The second place was enough for the Oreca team to be crowned as the 2010 champions, who were using a Peugeot instead their own race winning chassis from the 2009 event. This time Lapierre was co-driven by St√©phane Sarrazin. Audi were third with the R15 TDI of Capello and Timo Bernhard. The 2011 British Grand Prix was Alonso's return to the top step for Ferrari ‚Äì sixteen seconds ahead of the Red Bull pairing of Vettel and Webber. The Althea Racing Ducati of Carlos Checa robbed Yamaha's Eugene Laverty from taking victory in both races of the 2011 World Superbike meeting, with Laverty's teammate Marco Melandri finishing on the podium, again in both races. The MotoGP guys returned in June 2011 only to find conditions less than ideal, but the rain didn't stop the Repsol Hondas totally dominating the race with pole-man Casey Stoner beating his teammate Dovizioso by more than 15sec. The Tech 3 Yamaha of Colin Edwards completed the podium. The 2011 6 Hours of Silverstone, witnessed a nose-to-tail fight between the Audi R18 of Bernhard and F√§ssler and the Peugeot 908 of S√©bastien Bourdais and Simon Pagenaud, but was temporarily finished after a spin by Bernhard. A conservative drive from Pagenaud saw F√§ssler close the gap right down again and in fact jump into the lead. Pagenaud picked up the pace and the two cars were on each other's tails until the end of the fourth hour when damaged rear bodywork needed replacing on the Audi. This gave the Peugeot a one-minute advantage that it did not give up. Third was the OAK Racing's Pescarolo 01 piloted by Olivier Pla and Alexandre Pr√©mat. The F1 cars returned in Silverstone on 8 July 2012, for the Grand Prix. The race was won for the second time by Webber, with pole-sitter Alonso second for Ferrari, finishing 3secs behind. Red Bull Racing and Webber's teammate Vettel rounded off the podium. Silverstone is often the site of unpredictable weather, the 2012 World Superbike event proved to be no exception. Due to fluctuating weather, the riders were greeted with a track in-between wet and dry for Race 1. Kawasaki Racing's Loris Baz posted an astonishing finish to win from the BMW's of Michel Fabrizio and Ayrton Badovini. Baz then took second behind PATA Racing's Ducati, piloted by Sylvain Guintoli in a shortened Race2. Jakub Smrz took third, as nine riders went down before the official called an early end after eight laps. The 2012 British MotoGP went the way of the Yamaha factory rider, Lorenzo. He crossed the line 3.313secs ahead of the Respol Honda of Stoner, with Dani Pedrosa third on the other Honda. The 2012 Le Mans 24 Hours winners Beno√Æt Tr√©luyer, Andr√© Lotterer and F√§ssler steered their Audi R18 e-tron Quattro hybrid car to victory in the 6 Hours of Silverstone on 26 August 2012. The win, added to third place for the sister car of Allan McNish, Rinaldo Capello and Tom Kristensen, enabled Audi to get both their cars to finish on the podium. Audi didn't have everything its own way though, as the Toyota TS030 hybrid of Alex Wurz, Kazuki Nakajima and Nicolas Lapierre challenged hard, leading early on, to finish a richly deserved second. Toyota TS030 Hybrid on its way to the third place in the 2013 FIA World Endurance Championship race The opening round of the 2013 World Endurance Championship saw Audi Sport Team Joest dominating. The race soon developed into a pattern of 2 Audi R18 e-tron quattros followed by 2 Toyota TS030 Hybrids and backed up by 2 Rebellion Lola B12/60s. Audis had a better early stage of the race when Toyota tyres did not work well and by the middle of the race they were securely leading the race by one lap. Toyota also did not manage to go through a middle race rain shower so well as Audi did. Despite that, the race was still very interesting until the end, when McNish was behind Tr√©luyer by more than 20 seconds with some 15 laps to go. But McNish (partnered by Kristensen and Lo√Øc Duval), and motivated to win the RAC Tourist Trophy award for the race, very quickly ate the gap and finally manage to overtake Tr√©luyer (supported by Lotterer and F√§ssler) some two laps before the finish. The podium was completed the Toyota of Davidson/Sarrazin/S√©bastien Buemi. Mercedes's Rosberg held off Red Bull's Webber to win a dramatic 2013 British Grand Prix overshadowed by a series of Pirelli tyre failures. In a race featuring two safety car interventions and tyre failures on five cars (four of which blew the rear-right tyre), Ferrari's Alonso fought up to third from ninth on the grid. Rosberg's teammate, pole-man Hamilton, dropped to last with tyre failure, but fought back to fourth ahead of Lotus's R√§ikk√∂nen. Pata Honda's Jonathan Rea took advantage of the fluctuating weather conditions to take the lead mid-distance during the 2013 World Superbike Race 1, which he held until the end. Aprilia Racing's Eugene Laverty followed home for second place, with Crescent Suzuki's Leon Camier third. Race 2 started dry and deteriorated to treacherously damp by mid-race. This saw Baz prevailing, replicating his victory from 2012, in similar conditions, after a spirited battle. Jules Cluzel took his Crescent Suzuki up to second place, followed home by Laverty in third. Reigning World MotoGP Champion, Lorenzo, ended Marc M√°rquez's four-race winning streak to take victory in the 2013 British MotoGP after a classic last lap. Yamaha factory-rider, Lorenzo swapped the lead three times with M√°rquez through the last few corners, but Lorenzo managed to make the crucial pass and win. M√°rquez's Repsol Honda teammate, Pedrosa finished third, while Crutchlow was seventh. Meanwhile, in the supporting Moto2 race, Scott Redding took the spoils, much to the delight of the Silverstone crowd. Easter Sunday 2014, saw the return of Porsche to top-level sportscar racing in the World Endurance Championship event. However, it was Toyota who stole the show with a dominant one-two. The Toyota TS040 Hybrid of S√©bastien Buemi, Anthony Davidson and Nicolas Lapierre took victory by a clear lap over their teammates, Alex Wurz, Kazuki Nakajima and St√©phane Sarrazin, at the end of a race that was red-flagged before its scheduled finish courtesy of heavy rain. Porsche claimed a podium on its return with the 919 Hybrid. The partnership of Mark Webber, Timo Bernhard and Brendon Hartley took third, finishing two laps down on the winner and one down on the second-placed Toyota. Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton delighted the 120,000 Formula One fans by winning the 2014 British Grand Prix. Hamilton was catching his teammate and championship rival, Nico Rosberg, at the half-way stage of the race when Rosberg suffered a gearbox failure and was forced to retire, with Williams's Valtteri Bottas coming from 14th on the grid to finish second. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo took third. The race had to be red flagged following a high-speed crash on the opening lap for Ferrari's Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen. The reigning world champion Marc M√°rquez won a thrilling Hertz British MotoGP to make it 11 wins in 12 starts. The Honda rider, overtook last year's winner Jorge Lorenzo on a Yamaha with three laps to go to cross the line 0.732 seconds in front. The second works- Yamaha of Valentino Rossi completed the podium, after fending off Honda's Dani Pedrosa. Lewis Hamilton's win at the 2019 British Grand Prix was his sixth win at the Silverstone circuit and resulted in him breaking a 52-year-old record for most wins in the British Grand Prix by a Formula One driver. The previous record of five wins was set and held by Jim Clark in 1967. This record was then matched by Alain Prost in 1993, and Hamilton in 2017. === 2020s === The Silverstone Circuit held two Formula One World Championship races in one season in 2020 (behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic) on consecutive weekends with the races on 2 August and 9 August; the second race was referred to as the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix to commemorate the 70 years since the inception of the Formula One World Championship in 1950. ==Other competitions== 2010 Superleague Formula round Silverstone also hosts many club racing series and the world's largest historic race meeting, the Silverstone Classic. It is also host to one of the UK's only 24-hour car races, the Britcar 24, which is gaining in popularity, having run between 2005 and 2012.

The party currently forms government in Nova Scotia, under the leadership of Premier Stephen McNeil. It has held power in the province since the 2013 election, and the current government led by Stephen McNeil was the first in Nova Scotia to win 2 consecutive majorities since the government of John Buchanan, after the victory in the 2017 Nova Scotia election. ==Origins== The party is descended from the pre-Confederation Reformers in Nova Scotia who coalesced around Joseph Howe demanding the institution of responsible government. The Liberals (Reformers) formed several governments in the colony between 1848 and 1867. The party split during the debate on Confederation, with Howe and most other Liberals forming an Anti-Confederation Party, while supporters of confederation joined Tory Charles Tupper's Confederation Party. Howe, himself, initially opposed Confederation, but accepted it as a reality after initial attempts to scuttle it failed. In 1868, Howe joined the pro- Confederation forces, serving for a time in the federal Cabinet of Sir John A. Macdonald. The Anti-Confederation Party took most of Nova Scotia's seats in the House of Commons of Canada in 1867, as well as forming the government of the new province under William Annand. The new, post-1867 Liberal Party was organised by Annand and his anti-Confederate forces, while the Conservative Party was organised by Tupper and supporters of Sir John A. Macdonald's coalition in the province. Prior to 1956, the Nova Scotia Liberal Party had ruled the province for 76 of its 89 years, most of that time with fewer than 5 opposition members. It had also ruled prior to confederation, and was responsible for bringing the first responsible government to North America. From 1882 to 1925, the Liberals held power for an unbroken 43 years, the second longest serving political dynasty in Canadian history, behind the Alberta PCs. ==The party in recent years== From 1956 the Tories gained significant ground with Robert Stanfield's reformation of the \\"Progressive Conservatives\\", and have successfully challenged the Liberals for control of the government. The Liberals faltered in the province at the beginning of the 21st century, and for a time were the third-largest party in the House of Assembly, behind the Tories and the Nova Scotia New Democratic Party. After the Nova Scotia Liberal Party's dismal performance in the 2006 election (and failing to win his own seat), leader Francis MacKenzie announced his resignation. He was succeeded by Stephen McNeil. In the 2009 election, the Liberals moved out of third-party status and formed the official opposition once again. In the 2013 election, the Liberals won a majority government, their first since the 1993 election under John Savage, and took office for the first time in 14 years. Under McNeil, a self-described fiscal conservative, the party pushed for balanced provincial budgets and took a firm stance against public sector unions. The Nova Scotia Liberals are the provincial section of the federal Liberal Party of Canada. The two parties have a shared membership, and Liberal Members of Parliament often become Liberal Members of the Legislative Assembly, and vice versa. Gerald Regan, for instance, became leader of the provincial party after serving as a Liberal MP. He joined the federal Liberal government after serving as premier of Nova Scotia. Angus L. Macdonald, the province's most storied Liberal premier, split his term into two by spending five years as a federal Liberal cabinet minister in the wartime government of William Lyon Mackenzie King. On August 6, 2020, Stephen McNeil announced he will step down as party leader and that he will continue to act as premier and as the party's leader until the a replacement is found. ==Current elected members== { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" - !

J. Verwey, 1995, page 236 The Anglo Boer War (Second Boer War) broke out when he was five years old. During the war, his mother and the children were interned at the Winburg concentration camp. Out of the three boys, one died while in the concentration camp. His father was wounded and captured by the British during the Battle of Paardeberg. He became a prisoner-of-war and stayed in Groenpunt and Simonstad until the end of the war.President C.R.

Established in 1913, the society is organized into six geographical regions of both medical and lay volunteers operating in more than 250 Regional offices throughout the United States. Its global headquarters is located in the American Cancer Society Center in Atlanta, Georgia. The ACS publishes the journals Cancer, CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians and Cancer Cytopathology. ==History== ACS offices in Washington, D.C. The society was founded on May 22, 1913, by ten physicians and five businessmen in New York City under the name \\"American Society for the Control of Cancer\\" (ASCC).\\"The Organization of National and Local Forces in the Campaign Against Cancer\\", by Curtis E. Lakeman, M.D., Executive Secretary of the American Society for the Control of Cancer, in Journal of the Missouri State Medical Association (October 1915) p455Frederick L. Hoffman, The Mortality from Cancer throughout the World (Prudential Press, 1913) The current name was adopted in 1944. At the time of founding, it was not considered appropriate to mention the word \\"cancer\\" in public. Information concerning this illness was cloaked in a climate of fear and denial. Over 75,000 people died each year of cancer in just the United States. The top item on the founders' agenda was to raise awareness of cancer, before any other progress could be made in funding research. Therefore, a frenetic writing campaign was undertaken to educate doctors, nurses, patients and family members about cancer. Articles were written for popular magazines and professional journals. The ASCC undertook to publish their own journal, Campaign Notes, a monthly bulletin with information about cancer. They began recruiting doctors from all over the United States to help educate the public about cancer. In 1936, Marjorie Illig, an ASCC field representative, suggested the creation of a network consisting of new volunteers for the purpose of waging \\"war on cancer\\". From 1935 to 1938 the number of people involved in cancer control in the US grew from 15,000 to 150,000. According to Working to Give, the Women's Field Army, a group of volunteers working for the ASCC, was primarily responsible for this increase. The sword symbol, adopted by the American Cancer Society in 1928, was designed by George E. Durant of Brooklyn, New York. According to Durant, the two serpents forming the handle represent the scientific and medical focus of the society's mission, and the blade expresses the \\"crusading spirit of the cancer control movement\\". In 2012 the American Cancer Society raised $934 million and spent $943 million prompting a national consolidation and cost-cutting reorganization in 2013. It centralized its operations and consolidated, merging previous regional affiliates into the parent organization. It also required all employees to reapply for their jobs. ==Activities and fund allocation== 1938 American Society for the Control of Cancer poster The ACS' activities include providing grants to researchers, including funding 49 Nobel Laureate researchers; discovering the link between smoking and cancer; and serving one million callers every year through its National Cancer Information Center. The Nobel Prize laureates include James D. Watson, Mario Capecchi, Oliver Smithies, Paul Berg, E. Donnall Thomas, and Walter Gilbert. The American Cancer Society's website contained a chronological listing of specific accomplishments in the fight against cancer in which the ACS had a hand, including the funding of various scientists who went on to discover life-saving cancer treatments, and advocating for increased use of preventative techniques. The organization also runs public health advertising campaigns, and organizes projects such as the Relay For Life and the Great American Smokeout. It operates a series of thrift stores to raise money for its operations. The ACS participates in the Hopkins 4K for Cancer, a 4000-mile bike ride from Baltimore to San Francisco to raise money for the society's Hope Lodge. The society's allocation of funds for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, lists 78% of funds for Program Services (Patient Support 36%, Research 19%, Prevention 14%, Detection and Treatment 9%). The remaining 22% are allocated for supporting services (Fundraising 17%, and Management, General administration 5%). This meets the Better Business Bureau's Standards for Charity Accountability: Standard 8 (Program Service Expense Ratio) of at least 65% of total expenses spent on program activities. In 2020, The American Cancer Society launched Gamers Vs Cancer, a series of charity online streams that feature professional gaming live streamers. ==Evaluations and controversies== ACS Hope Lodge in Manhattan In 1994, the Chronicle of Philanthropy, a nonprofit industry publication, released the results of the largest study of charitable and non-profit organization popularity and credibility, conducted by Nye Lavalle & Associates. The study showed that the American Cancer Society was ranked as the 10th \\"most popular charity/non-profit in America\\" of over 100 charities researched, with 38% of Americans over the age of 12 choosing \\"love\\" and \\"like a lot\\" for the ACS. The Better Business Bureau lists American Cancer Society as an accredited charity meeting all of its Standards for Charity Accountability . In 1995, the Arizona chapter of the American Cancer Society was targeted for its extremely high overhead. Two economists, James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo, issued a report analyzing the chapter's financial statements and demonstrating that the Arizona chapter used about 95% of its donations for paying salaries and other overhead costs, resulting in a 22 to 1 ratio of overhead to actual money spent on the cause. The report also asserted that the Arizona chapter's annual report had grossly misrepresented the amount of money spent on patient services, inflating it by more than a factor of 10. The American Cancer Society responded by alleging that the economists issuing the report were working for a group funded by the tobacco industry. John R. Seffrin, former CEO of the American Cancer Society, received $2,401,112 salary and compensation from the charity for the 2009‚Äì2010 fiscal year. This is the second most money given by any charity to the head of that charity, according to Charity Watch. The money included $1.5 million in a retention benefit approved in 2001, \\"to preserve management stability\\". Seffrin's compensation for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2012, was $832,355. The American Cancer Society was criticized in 2011 for turning down participation from the Foundation Beyond Belief in its Relay For Life \\"National Team\\" program. ==See also== * American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network * American Cancer Society Center * Canadian Cancer Society * Cattle Baron's Ball, an annual Dallas-based fundraising event * Great American Smokeout * Hope Lodge (American Cancer Society) * National Cancer Institute * National Comprehensive Cancer Network * Oncology * Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy * Relay For Life, the signature event of the American Cancer Society * Treatment of cancer ==ReferencesGuidestar Report on American Cancer Society, including financial data Category:1913 establishments in New York (state) Category:Charities based in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Organizations established in 1913 ","title":"American Cancer Society"},{"id":"522684","text":"Itzik Feffer (left), Albert Einstein and Solomon Mikhoels in the United States in 1943.

He and Solomon Mikhoels travelled to the United States in 1943 in a well-documented fund-raising trip. ===Arrest and death=== In 1948, after the assassination of the JAC Chairman Solomon Mikhoels, Feffer, along with other JAC members, was arrested and accused of treason. Feffer had been an informer for the NKVD (predecessor of the KGB) since 1943. Feffer reportedly cooperated with the investigation, providing false information that would lead to the arrest and indictment of over a hundred people, but at the trial, he made openly nationalistic statements and expressed pride in his Jewish identity. Feffer had also allegedly been one of the \\"most loyal and conformist Yiddish poets\\", who had helped to enforce strict ideological control over other Yiddish writers, and had a history of denouncing colleagues for their \\"nationalistic hysteria\\". However, in 1952, Feffer, along with other defendants, was tried at a closed JAC trial, and executed on 12 August 1952, at Lubyanka prison. Feffer was rehabilitated posthumously in 1955, after Stalin's death. ==Paul Robeson== The American concert singer and actor Paul Robeson met Feffer on 8 July 1943, in New York during a Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee event chaired by Albert Einstein, one of the largest pro-Soviet rallies ever held in the United States. After the rally, Paul Robeson and his wife Eslanda Robeson, befriended Feffer and Mikhoels. Six years later, in June 1949, during the 150th-anniversary celebration of the birth of Alexander Pushkin, Robeson visited the Soviet Union to sing in concert. According to David Horowitz During his concert in Tchaikovsky Hall on 14 June - which was broadcast across the entire country - Robeson publicly paid tribute to Feffer and the late Mikhoels, singing the Vilna Partisan song \\"Zog Nit Keynmol\\" in both Russian and Yiddish.Duberman 352-354.Paul Robeson Live Concert in Moscow at Tchaikovsky Hall Recordings of the concert survived, but Robeson's spoken words are lost. ==Literary work== Feffer was a prolific poet who wrote almost exclusively in Yiddish, and his poems were widely translated into Russian and Ukrainian. He is considered one of the greatest Soviet poets in the Yiddish language and his poems were widely admired inside and outside Russia. ===Di Shotns fun Varshever Geto=== His epic poem (\\"The Shadows of the Warsaw Ghetto\\" is a tribute to the 750 Jews who rebelled against the Nazi liquidation of the ghetto and gave their lives fighting tyranny during World War II. ===Books of poetry=== * (Splinters), 1922; * (About Me and Others Like Me), 1924; * (A Stone to a Stone), 1925; * (Simple Words), 1925; * (Blossoming Garbage), 1926, a paradoxical title about the revival of a shtetl in Soviet times; * (Found Sparkles), 1928; * (Competition), 1930; * (Posters in Bronze), 1932; * (Force), 1937; * 1943; * (Anew), 1948. ==References== ==Further reading== * Rappaport, Louis.

The strait is the channel to the east and southeast of Tsushima Island, with the Japanese islands of Honshu to the east and northeast, and Kyushu and the Got≈ç Islands to the south and southeast. It is narrowest south-east of Shimono-shima, the south end of Tsushima Island proper, constricted there by nearby Iki Island, which lies wholly in the strait near the tip of Honshu. South of that point Japan's Inland Sea mingles its waters through the narrow Kanmon Strait between Honshu and Kyushu, with those of the Eastern Channel, making for some of the busiest sea lanes in the world. The Strait was the site of the decisive naval battle in the Russo-Japanese War, the Battle of Tsushima, took place between the Japanese and Russian navies in 1905. The Russian fleet was virtually destroyed, with the Japanese suffering only the loss of three torpedo boats.100 Battles, Decisive Battles that Shaped the World, Dougherty, Martin, J., Parragon, p.144-45 ==Geography== The Tsushima Strait measures approximately 100 kilometres along Tsushima Island and is about 65 kilometres wide at its narrowest. The strait has a depth of about 140Imamura, K. 1996. Prehistoric Japan: New Perspectives on Insular East Asia. London, University College London. metres and is bounded by the Tsushima Islands to the west through north (of Got≈ç Islands). Nearby Iki Island lies in the strait about 50 kilometres towards Ky≈´sh≈´ from the southern tip of Kamino- shima (South Island). A warm branch of the Kuroshio Current passes through the strait. Originating along the Japanese islands, this current passes through the Sea of Japan then a branch eventually flowing into the Pacific Northern Pacific Ocean via the Tsugaru Strait south of Hokkaido. Another branch continues far northward and divides along either shore of Sakhalin Island; eventually flowing into the Sea of Okhotsk via the La Perouse Strait north of Hokkaido and via the Strait of Tartary into the Sea of Okhotsk north of Sakhalin Island near Vladivostok. The Kuroshio Current brings rich fisheries resources from the East China Sea into the Sea of Japan, like Japanese amberjack, Japanese horse mackerel, but these days also brings disaster like mass aggregation of gigantic Nomura's jellyfish and waste from countries along the course of the current. A commercial ferry service operates between Shimonoseki at the western tip of Honshu and Busan (aka Pusan), South Korea. Another operates between Shimonoseki and Tsushima Island. The cities of Kitakyushu (Kyushu) and Shimonoseki (Honshu) are joined by an ocean-spanning bridge across the Kanmon Strait joining those cities with Nagasaki, which latter city serves as prefecture-level capital and administers both Tsushima and Iki Island. The Kanmon Strait lies approximately 85 miles (135 km) due east of the center of Tsushima Island, while Nagasaki city proper lies about 100 miles (165 km) to the south-south-east of the southern tip of the island. ==Historical impact== The earliest settlement of Japan by people most resembling modern Japanese in litoral northern Kyushu next to the Eastern Channel is supported by legendary, historical, and archeological evidence, and is undisputed. A range of dates when immigration began from what is the mainland via the Korean Peninsula to north Kyushu from the fall of Four Commanderies of Han (108 BC) to the 4th century AD. Historically these narrows (i.e., the whole Korea/Tsushima Strait) served as a highway for high-risk voyages (southern end of the Korean Peninsula to the Tsushima Islands to Iki Island to the western tip of Honshu) for trade between the countries of the Korean peninsula and Japan The straits also served as a migration or an invasion path, in both directions. For example, archeologists believe the first Mesolithic migrations (J≈çmon) traveled across to Honshu around the 10th century BC, supplanting Paleolithic people that walked from Asia to Japan overland over 100,000 years ago when the sea level was lower during the Pleistocene ice age. Immigrants from Korea and China also contributed to waves of immigrants arriving in Kyushu, although who, when, and how many exactly is a matter of intense debate. Buddhism, along with Chinese writing, was initially transmitted from Korean Peninsula via Eastern Channel to Japan in the 5th century by way of the straits as well. Iki to Kamino-shima, the southern end of the large island of Tsushima, is about 50 kilometres. Busan (Korea), to the northern tip of Tsushima, about the same across the Korea Strait. These were tremendous distances to attempt in small boats over open seas. The Mongol invasions of Japan crossed this sea and ravaged the Tsushima Islands before the kamikaze - translated as \\"divine wind\\" - a typhoon that is said to have saved Japan from a Mongol invasion fleet led by Kublai Khan in 1281. The 16th century, Toyotomi Hideyoshi was aimed at the conquest of China via the Korean Peninsula from this strait. The decisive naval battle in the Russo-Japanese War, the Battle of Tsushima, took place in the strait between the Japanese and Russian navies in 1905; the Russian fleet was virtually destroyed by a Japanese naval force for the loss of only three Japanese torpedo boats. Japan's territorial waters extend to three nautical miles (5.6 km) into the strait instead of the usual twelve, reportedly to allow nuclear- armed United States Navy warships and submarines to transit the strait without violating Japan's prohibition against nuclear weapons in its territory.Kyodo News, \\"Japan left key straits open for U.S. nukes\\", Japan Times, June 22, 2009. ==See also== *List of Korea-related topics *List of Japan-related topics *Geography of Korea *Geography of Japan *Russo-Japanese War *Tsushima City ==References== Category:Straits of South Korea Category:Straits of Japan Category:International straits ","title":"Tsushima Strait"},{"id":"522695","text":"The Alaouite dynasty, or Alawite dynasty (, SulƒÅlat al- øAlawiyyƒ´n al- Fƒ´lƒÅlƒ´yn), is the current Moroccan royal family. Sharif ibn Ali became Prince of Tafilalt in 1631. His son Mulay Al-Rashid (1664‚Äì1672) was able to unite and pacify the country. The Alaouites claim descent from a relative of prophet Muhammad and are the Arab ruling family of Morocco. The name Alaouites stems from Ali son of Abu Taalib ==Centralised state== The organisation of the sultanate developed under Ismail Ibn Sharif (1672‚Äì1727), who, against the opposition of local tribes, began to create a unified state. Because the Alaouites had difficult relations with many of the country's Berber and Bedouin-Arab tribes, Isma'ƒ´l formed a new army of black slaves, the Black Guard. However, the unity of Morocco did not survive his death‚Äîin the ensuing power struggles the tribes became a political and military force once again. During Muhammad III's reign (1757‚Äì1790) the kingdom was once again united and the administration reorganised. A renewed attempt at centralisation was abandoned, and the tribes were allowed to preserve their autonomy. Under Abderrahmane (1822‚Äì1859) Morocco fell under the influence of the European powers. After Morocco supported the Algerian independence movement of Emir Abd al-Qadir, it was attacked and defeated by the French in 1844 at the Battle of Isly and made to abandon its support. ==European contact and the French protectorate== During the reigns of Muhammad IV (1859‚Äì1873) and Hassan I (1873‚Äì1894), the Alaouites tried to foster trading links, above all with European countries and the United States. The army and administration were also modernised to improve control over the Berber and Bedouin tribes. With the war against Spain (1859‚Äì1860) came direct involvement in European affairs. Although the independence of Morocco was guaranteed at the Treaty of Madrid (1880), the French gained ever greater influence. German attempts to counter this growing influence led to the First Moroccan Crisis of 1905‚Äì1906 and the Second Moroccan Crisis of 1911. Eventually the Moroccans were forced to recognise the French protectorate through the Treaty of Fez, signed on December 3, 1912.

He served as the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services during President George H. W. Bush's Administration and was Founding Dean of the Morehouse School of Medicine. ==Biography== He was born in Atlanta, Georgia, although his parents moved to rural Blakely, Georgia, shortly after he was born. His father was a mortician and his mother a teacher. His parents sent him, and his brother Walter, to live with friends in Atlanta during the school year where there were better public schools. By age 5, with inspiration from his family physician and encouragement from teachers and parents, Sullivan had decided he would pursue a career in healthcare. In 1950, Sullivan graduated from Atlanta's Booker T. Washington high school as Class Salutatorian. He then enrolled at Morehouse College and graduated magna cum laude in 1954, before earning his medical degree, cum laude, from Boston University School of Medicine in 1958. His postgraduate training included internship and residency in internal medicine at New York Hospital ‚Äì Cornell Medical Center (1958‚Äì60), a clinical fellowship in pathology at Massachusetts General Hospital (1960‚Äì61), and a research fellowship in hematology at the Thorndike Memorial Laboratory of Harvard Medical School, Boston City Hospital (1961‚Äì63). He is certified in internal medicine and hematology, holds a mastership from the American College of Physicians and is a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Alpha Omega Alpha academic honor societies. Sullivan was an instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School from 1963‚Äì64, and an assistant professor of medicine at Seton Hall College of Medicine from 1964‚Äì66. In 1966, he became co-director of hematology at Boston University Medical Center and, a year later, founded the Boston University Hematology Service at Boston City Hospital. Sullivan remained at Boston University until 1975, holding positions as assistant professor of medicine, associate professor of medicine, and professor of medicine. In his teaching, he specialized in \\"sickle-cell anemia and blood disorders related to vitamin deficiencies\\". He married E. Ginger Williamson, an attorney, on September 30, 1955. They have three children. Sullivan is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.(2007). Attention Alpha College Presidents In 1992, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 2000, he received an honorary degree in Doctor of Letters from Oglethorpe University. ==Morehouse School of Medicine== Sullivan became the founding dean and director of the Medical Education Program at Morehouse College in 1975. The program became The School of Medicine at Morehouse College in 1978, admitting its first 24 students to a two-year program in the basic medical sciences. In 1981, the school received provisional accreditation of its four-year curriculum leading to the M.D. degree, became independent from Morehouse College and was renamed Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM), with Sullivan as dean and president. In 1983, MSM became a member of the Atlanta University Center (AUC). MSM was fully accredited as a four-year medical school in April 1985 and awarded its first 16 M.D. degrees in May of that year. With the exception of his tenure as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from 1989 to 1993, Sullivan was president of Morehouse School of Medicine for more than two decades. On July 1, 2002, he retired and was appointed president emeritus. ==Secretary of Health and Human Services== Sullivan in 2015 Sullivan left MSM in 1989 to accept an appointment by President George H.W. Bush to serve as secretary of HHS. In this cabinet position, Sullivan managed the federal agency responsible for the major health, welfare, food and drug safety, medical research and income security programs serving the American people. ===Initiatives=== Among his efforts to improve the health and health behavior of Americans were: (1) the introduction of a new and improved FDA food label; (2) the release of Healthy People 2000, a guide for improved health promotion/disease prevention activities; (3) the public education program focused on the health dangers from tobacco use (including the successful efforts to prevent the introduction of \\"Uptown,\\" a non-filtered, mentholated cigarette); (4) the inauguration of a $100 million minority male health and injury prevention initiative; and (5) a greater emphasis on gender and ethnic diversity in senior positions of HHS, including the selection of the: * First female Director of the National Institutes of Health * First female (and first Hispanic) Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service * First African- American Commissioner of the Social Security Administration * First African- American Administrator (Acting) of the Health Care Financing Administration and * First female Chief of Staff of the Department of Health and Human Services In 1991, Sullivan formed the Workgroup for Electronic Data Interchange (WEDI). WEDI was designated in the 1996 HIPAA legislation as an advisor to HHS. WEDI is an authority on the use of Health IT to improve healthcare information exchange in order to enhance the quality of care, improve efficiency, and reduce costs of our nation's healthcare system. In 2013, on the 20th anniversary of the original WEDI Report, WEDI brought together healthcare, corporate and government organizations to create an updated WEDI Report to guide the future of health information exchange. The 2013 WEDI Report was managed by an Executive Steering Committee led by Sullivan. In January 1993, he returned to Morehouse School of Medicine and resumed the office of president until 2002. ==The Sullivan Commission== Established in 2003, the Sullivan Commission on Diversity in the Healthcare Workforce [was] an outgrowth of a grant from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation to Duke University School of Medicine. Named for former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Louis W. Sullivan, M.D., the Commission [was] composed of 16 health, business, higher education and legal experts and other leaders. Former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole and former U.S. Congressman and Congressional Health Subcommittee Chairman Paul Rogers [served] as Honorary Co-Chairs. The Sullivan Commission [made] policy recommendations to bring about systemic change that [addressed] the scarcity of minorities in the health professions. The work of the Commission [came] at a time when enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in nursing, medicine, and dentistry has stagnated despite America's growing diversity. While African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and American Indians, as a group, constitute nearly 25 percent of the U.S. population, these three groups account for less than 9 percent of nurses, 6 percent of physicians, and only 5 percent of dentists. The Sullivan Commission gathered testimonies from health, education, religion and business leaders; community and civil rights advocates; health care practitioners; and students. Drawing upon the expertise and experience of the Commissioners, and the witnesses who provided valuable testimony, the Commission's report, Missing Persons: Minorities in the Health Professions, [provided] the nation with a blueprint for achieving diversity in the health professions. ==The Sullivan Alliance to Transform the Health Professions== Sullivan organized The Sullivan Alliance in January 2005, to act on the reports and recommendations of the Sullivan Commission (Missing Persons: Minorities in the Health Professions), and the Institute of Medicine Committee on Institutional and Policy-Level Strategies for Increasing the Diversity of the U.S. Healthcare Workforce.In the Nation‚Äôs Compelling Interest: Ensuring Diversity in the Healthcare Workforce The Sullivan Alliance became a 501c.3. non-profit organization in 2011. The Sullivan Alliance: (1) raises awareness of the importance and value of achieving racial and ethnic diversity in the health professions; (2) disseminates information about \\"best practices\\" and resources that enhance the health professions pipeline; and (3) stimulates academic programs and partnerships in the health professions of medicine, dentistry, nursing, psychology and public health to create new‚Äîor more effectively implement existing‚Äîdiversity initiatives. The Sullivan Alliance actively participates in a project funded by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation to train mid-level dental professionals, thereby addressing the shortage of dentists and increasing the diversity in the dental professions. The Sullivan Alliance has developed an international consortium that is building a U.S.-Caribbean health disparities research partnership that responds to The Institute of Medicine's 2009 Report, U.S. Commitment to Global Health: Recommendations for the Public and Private Sector, by conducting research that lessens knowledge gaps about global heath disparities. The project focuses on epidemiological research in order to advance understanding of the relationships among health factors such as: history-ancestry, language, indigenous health practices, life styles, and socioeconomic status. Funded by the Department of Health and Human Services through a cooperative agreement with NIH's National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIH- NIMHD), the United States of America (U.S.)-Caribbean Alliance for Health Disparities Research (USCAHDR) consortium includes NIMHD, The Sullivan Alliance; and The University of the West Indies. ==National Health Museum== Sullivan is chairman of the Atlanta-based National Health Museum. The National Health Museum (NHM) will educate and inspire Americans to live healthier lives. NHM will help move our society from simply treating disease to promoting and maintaining health. NHM will build and lead a national health and wellness community with two platforms: a global online network and digital information hub called the Cyber Museum, and a visitor center at Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park called the Experience Museum. ==Other activitiesBoard member=== Sullivan serves on the boards of a number of organizations including: Henry Schein, United Therapeutics, Emergent BioSolutions, and BioSante Pharmaceuticals. He is retired from the boards of General Motors, 3M, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Cigna, Household International (now HBSC), and Equifax. Sullivan is the founding president of the Association of Minority Health Professions Schools (AMHPS). He is a former member of the Joint Committee on Health Policy of the Association of American Universities and the National Association of Land Grant Colleges and Universities. He also is a member of the boards of Africare in Washington, D.C. and Callaway Gardens in Pine Mountain, Georgia. ===Other leadership roles=== In 1985, Sullivan was one of the founders of Medical Education for South African Blacks (MESAB). From 1994‚Äì2007, he served as chairman of the organization, which raised scholarship funds in the United States and South Africa for more than 10,000 black health professions students, who are now physicians, nurses, dentists and other health professionals in South Africa. In March 2008, Sullivan was appointed to the new Grady Hospital Corporation Board of Trustees. In June, 2008, Sullivan accepted appointments to (a) the Health Disparities Technical Expert Panel (HDTEP) of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) of HHS and (b) an Institute of Medicine Committee, \\"Improving the Organization of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to Advance the Health of Our Population.\\" ===Publications=== Sullivan has authored and co-authored many academic papers. Recently, he has also contributed to two books: The Morehouse Mystique: Becoming a Doctor at the Nation's Newest African American Medical School (Author: Marybeth Gasman.

The Company of Watermen and Lightermen (CWL) is a City Guild without Grant of Livery who historically licensed Thames Watermen (now licensed by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency). Watermen are river workers who transfer passengers across and along city centre rivers and estuaries in Britain and its former colonies. Most notable are those on the River Thames and River Medway, but other rivers such as the River Tyne and River Dee, Wales also had their watermen who formed guilds in medieval times. Lightermen were workers who transferred goods between ships and quays, aboard flat-bottomed barges called lighters in the Port of London. Its ancient apprenticeship index is a unique resource to genealogical research however despite its medieval guild roots it is an active lobbying force today. Working alongside the Passenger Boat Association, it consults and negotiates with national and local government and its agencies on behalf of its members. In 2003 funds were made available via CWL using government grants, to assist apprentices from the riverside east London boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Newham.

Kasumi Pond, November. Kenroku-en (ÂÖºÂÖ≠Âúí, Six Attributes Garden), located in Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan, is an old private garden. Along with Kairaku-en and K≈çraku-en, Kenroku-en is one of the Three Great Gardens of Japan. The grounds are open year-round except for December 29 through January 3 during daylight hours and famous for its beauty in all seasons; an admission fee is charged. ==History== Kenroku-en was developed from the 1620s to the 1840s by the Maeda clan, the daimy≈çs who ruled the former Kaga Domain. While the date of initial development of the garden that would be become known as Kenrokuen is rather unclear, one version of the garden's origins can perhaps be marked by the completion of the Tatsumi water channel in 1632 by Maeda Toshitsune, the third daimy≈ç of the powerful Maeda clan and ruler of the Kaga Domain from 1605 to 1639, as this feature would be later incorporated into creating the garden's twisting waterways in 1822. Conversely, other versions of the garden's inception \\"is said to have originated when the 5th daimy≈ç Tsunanori [r. 1645‚Äì1723] built [in 1676] the Renchiochin house on the slope facing the [Kanazawa] castle, and gave its garden the name Renchitei\\", also spelled Renchi-tei, which means \\"lotus pond\\". Not much is known about Renchitei in the years after it was named, principally as about eighty years after its creation, nearly the entire garden was destroyed by a massive fire in 1759. However, it is known from documents of the period that before the fire, the garden was often used and enjoyed by successive lords and retainers for \\"different banquet occasions such as viewing the moon ... enjoying colorful maples\\", and for admiring horses. Furthermore, local legend suggests that the Sacred Well of Kenrokuen ‚Äì arguably the oldest object in the garden if the legend is true ‚Äì suggests that: > 1,200 years ago a peasant named Togoro stopped to wash his potatoes at the > well. Suddenly, flakes of gold began to bubble up from the well, giving > Kanazawa ‚Äì meaning 'Marsh of Gold' ‚Äì its name. Water from the well runs to > the purification basin at the nearby Shinto shrine, and many people come to > the Sacred Well for water for the tea ceremony. The Shigure-tei teahouse ‚Äì constructed in 1725 ‚Äì miraculously survived the fire of 1759, and it offers evidence that not only was the tea ceremony present before the fire, but more importantly so was the culture associated with this elaborate ritual as it had a significant effect on garden design. Following the fire, the teahouse continued to be used and was completely restored during the Meiji period. It can still be seen today in the Renchitei section of the garden. Another object that existed in or around the garden before the fire of 1759 was the Kaisekito Pagoda, which is currently situated in Kenrokuen Garden on an island near the center of Hisago-ike Pond. Not only is this object of considerable interest due to the theories which suggest its origin, but it also requires extra consideration due to the fact it \\"was erected by the third lord Toshitsune\\" who lived from 1594 to 1658, as it provides evidence that perhaps it predates the initial creation of Renchitei Garden. Of course, this depends upon ones interpretation regarding both when the garden was initially created, along with the two theories regarding its origin. The first theory suggests it was formerly part of a \\"13-tiered pagoda that was once in the Gyokusen-in garden in Kanazawa Castle\\". The second theory is a bit more interesting than the first, as it suggests the pagoda was \\"brought back from Korea by Kato Kiyomasa when he came back from a military incursion there, and that it was presented to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and then passed on by him to the first lord [Maeda] Toshiie\\". Since these military incursions by Kato Kiyomasa probably took place between 1592 and 1598, and as Hideyoshi died in 1598, one can assert that if the second theory is true, then the pagoda probably entered Japan and into the hands of Maeda Toshiie between 1592 and 1598. Moreover, both theories regarding its origin could be true, which one could argue would lead to a third theory behind the pagoda's origin. Perhaps, Maeda Toshiie received from Hideyoshi a 13-tiered pagoda, placed it in Gyokusen-in garden in Kanazawa Castle, and a subsequent daimyo placed the pagoda where it stands today in its current form. However, as there isn't any evidence suggesting this third theory, this claim cannot be substantiated. The garden is located outside the gates of Kanazawa Castle where it originally formed the outer garden, and covers 114,436.65 m¬≤ (over 25 acres). It began in 1676 when the 5th daimy≈ç Maeda Tsunanori moved his administration to the castle and began to landscape a garden in this vicinity. This garden was, however, destroyed by fire in 1759. The garden restoration was begun in 1774 by the 11th daimy≈ç Harunaga, who created the Emerald Waterfall (Midori-taki) and Yugao-tei, a teahouse. Improvements continued in 1822 when the 12th daimy≈ç Narinaga created the garden's winding streams with water drawn from the Tatsumi Waterway. The 13th daimy≈ç Nariyasu subsequently added more streams and expanded the Kasumi Pond. With this, the garden's current form was complete. The garden was opened to the public on May 7, 1874. The garden was named by Matsudaira Sadanobu at the request of Narinaga. Its name was derived from the \\"Chronicles of the Famous Luoyang Gardens\\" (Ê¥õÈôΩÂêçÂúíË®ò), a book by the Chinese poet Li Gefei (ÊùéÊ†ºÈùû), and stands for the six attributes of a perfect landscape: spaciousness, seclusion, artifice, antiquity, waterways, and panoramas. ==Features== Kenroku-en contains roughly 8,750 trees, and 183 species of plants in total.

Ophidia was defined as the \\"most recent common ancestor of Pachyrhachis and Serpentes (modern snakes), and all its descendants\\" by Lee and Caldwell (1998: 1551). The latter author has used Ophidia in a manner inconsistent with this definition, using it to incorporate other more basal stem-snakes, such as the Late Cretaceous Najash rioegrina or the Jurassic Diablophis and Portugalophis. The clade name Ophidia derives from the Ancient Greek word (), meaning \\"small snake\\". ==Evolution== Modern snakes are thought to have evolved from either burrowing or aquatic lizards during the mid-Cretaceous period, and the earliest known fossils date to around 112 Ma ago. However, the relationship between modern snake and more primitive snake ancestors, many of which retained hind limbs, is less clear. While many of these \\"stem-snakes\\" are known from Mesozoic fossils, some of them may be descendants of the earliest true snakes rather than more primitive lineages. Below is a cladogram modified from a study by Wilson et al. (2010), which found many stem-snakes of other studies to be true snakes instead. Below is different phylogenetic overview of ophidians, following the study by Caldwell et al. 2015. The fossil record of snakes is relatively poor because snake skeletons are typically small and fragile, making fossilization uncommon. Fossils readily identifiable as snakes (though often retaining hind limbs) first appear in the fossil record during the Cretaceous period.Durand, J.F. (2004). \\"The origin of snakes\\". Geoscience Africa 2004. Abstract Volume, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa, pp. 187. The earliest known snake fossils come from sites in Utah and Algeria, represented by the genera Coniophis and Lapparentophis, respectively. These fossil sites have been tentatively dated to the Albian or Cenomanian age of the late Cretaceous, between 112 and 94 Ma ago. However, an even greater age has been suggested for one of the Algerian sites, which may be as old as the Aptian, 125 to 112 Ma ago.Vidal, N., Rage, J.-C., Couloux, A. and Hedges, S.B. (2009). \\"Snakes (Serpentes)\\". Pp. 390-397 in Hedges, S.B. and Kumar, S. (eds.), The Timetree of Life. Oxford University Press. Based on comparative anatomy, there is consensus that snakes descended from lizards.Mehrtens JM. 1987. Living Snakes of the World in Color. New York: Sterling Publishers. 480 pp. . Pythons and boas‚Äîprimitive groups among modern snakes‚Äîhave vestigial hind limbs: tiny, clawed digits known as anal spurs, which are used to grasp during mating. The Leptotyphlopidae and Typhlopidae groups also possess remnants of the pelvic girdle, sometimes appearing as horny projections when visible. Front limbs are nonexistent in all known snakes. This is caused by the evolution of Hox genes, controlling limb morphogenesis. The axial skeleton of the snakes‚Äô common ancestor, like most other tetrapods, had regional specializations consisting of cervical (neck), thoracic (chest), lumbar (lower back), sacral (pelvic), and caudal (tail) vertebrae. Early in snake evolution, the Hox gene expression in the axial skeleton responsible for the development of the thorax became dominant. As a result, the vertebrae anterior to the hindlimb buds (when present) all have the same thoracic-like identity (except from the atlas, axis, and 1‚Äì3 neck vertebrae). In other words, most of a snake's skeleton is an extremely extended thorax. Ribs are found exclusively on the thoracic vertebrae. Neck, lumbar and pelvic vertebrae are very reduced in number (only 2‚Äì10 lumbar and pelvic vertebrae are present), while only a short tail remains of the caudal vertebrae. However, the tail is still long enough to be of important use in many species, and is modified in some aquatic and tree- dwelling species. Modern snakes greatly diversified during the Paleocene. This occurred alongside the adaptive radiation of mammals, following the extinction of (non-avian) dinosaurs. The colubrids, one of the more common snake groups, became particularly diverse due to preying on rodents, an especially successful mammal group. ===Origins=== The origin of snakes remains an unresolved issue. There are two main hypotheses competing for acceptance. Burrowing Lizard Hypothesis There is fossil evidence to suggest that snakes may have evolved from burrowing lizards, such as the varanids (or a similar group) during the Cretaceous Period. An early fossil snake, Najash rionegrina, was a two-legged burrowing animal with a sacrum, and was fully terrestrial. One extant analog of these putative ancestors is the earless monitor Lanthanotus of Borneo (though it also is semiaquatic). Subterranean species evolved bodies streamlined for burrowing, and eventually lost their limbs. According to this hypothesis, features such as the transparent, fused eyelids (brille) and loss of external ears evolved to cope with fossorial difficulties, such as scratched corneas and dirt in the ears. Some primitive snakes are known to have possessed hindlimbs, but their pelvic bones lacked a direct connection to the vertebrae. These include fossil species like Haasiophis, Pachyrhachis and Eupodophis, which are slightly older than Najash. Fossil of Archaeophis proavus. Aquatic Lizard Hypothesis Many researchers believe that snakes share a common marine ancestry with mosasaurs, a suggestion advanced in 1869 by Edward Drinker Cope, who coined the term Pythonomorpha to unite them. The idea lay dormant for more than a century, to be revived in the 1990s. The mosasaurs were aquatic varanid lizards the from the Cretaceous‚Äîwhich in turn are derived from Aigialosaurids. According to this hypothesis, the fused, transparent eyelids of snakes are thought to have evolved to combat marine conditions (corneal water loss through osmosis), and the external ears were lost through disuse in an aquatic environment. This ultimately led to an animal similar to today's sea snakes. In the Late Cretaceous, snakes recolonized land, and continued to diversify into today's snakes. Fossilized snake remains are known from early Late Cretaceous marine sediments, which is consistent with this hypothesis; particularly so, as they are older than the terrestrial Najash rionegrina. Similar skull structure, reduced or absent limbs, and other anatomical features found in both mosasaurs and snakes led to a positive cladistical correlation, and some of these features are shared with varanids. The cladogram below, based on Palci and Caldwell (2010), suggests that snakes are more closely related to Dolichosaurids than mosasaurs proper. placing the Dolichosauridae as a sister group to modern snakes and their closest ancestors. Genetics Genetic studies in recent years have indicated snakes are not as closely related to monitor lizards as was once believed‚Äîand therefore not to mosasaurs, the proposed ancestor in the aquatic scenario of their evolution. Fragmented remains found from the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous indicate deeper fossil records for these groups, which may potentially refute either hypothesis. ==References== Category:Squamata Category:Aalenian first appearances Category:Extant Middle Jurassic first appearances ","title":"Ophidia"},{"id":"522723","text":"A fire made of charcoal briquettes Solid fuel refers to various forms of solid material that can be burnt to release energy, providing heat and light through the process of combustion. Solid fuels can be contrasted with liquid fuels and gaseous fuels. Common examples of solid fuels include wood, charcoal, peat, coal, Hexamine fuel tablets, wood pellets, corn, wheat, rye, and other grains. Solid fuels are extensively used in rocketry as solid propellants. Solid fuels have been used throughout human history to create fire and solid fuel is still in widespread use throughout the world in the present day. ==Types of solid fuelsWood=== Wood fuel can refer to several fuels such as firewood, charcoal, wood chips sheets, pellets, and sawdust. The particular form used depends upon factors such as source, quantity, quality and application. In many areas, wood is the most easily available form of fuel, requiring no tools in the case of picking up dead wood, or few tools. Today, burning of wood is the largest use of energy derived from a solid fuel biomass. Wood fuel can be used for cooking and heating, and occasionally for fueling steam engines and steam turbines that generate electricity. Wood may be used indoors in a furnace, stove, or fireplace, or outdoors in a furnace, campfire, or bonfire. As with any fire, burning wood fuel creates numerous by-products, some of which may be useful (heat and steam), and others that are undesirable, irritating or dangerous. There is debate as to whether burning wood can be considered carbon neutral, as technically the wood cannot release more carbon than was sequestered during its growth, although this does not take account of other impacts such as deforestation and rotting has on the carbon footprint. When harvested in a sustainable fashion wood is usually considered to be a renewable solid fuel.Wood is one of the most commonly used solid fuels. ===Biomass=== Although wood is a form of biomass, the term usually refers to other natural plant material that can be burnt for fuel. Common biomass fuels include waste wheat, straw, nut shells and other fibrous material. ===Peat=== Peat fuel is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation or organic matter that can be burnt once sufficiently dried. It is used widely in the country districts of Ireland and Scotland where alternatives are absent or expensive. It has a relatively low calorific value, even after essential drying. === Coal === Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock usually occurring in rock strata in layers or veins called coal beds or coal seams. Throughout history, coal has been used as an energy resource, primarily burned for the production of electricity and heat, and is also used for industrial purposes, such as refining metals. Coal is the largest source of energy for the generation of electricity worldwide, as well as one of the largest worldwide The extraction of coal, its use in energy production and its byproducts are all associated with environmental and health effects. Variations such as smokeless coal can be formed naturally in the form of anthracite, a metamorphosed type of coal with a very high carbon content that gives off a smokeless flame when set alight. It is an important type of smokeless fuel. === Coke === Coke is a fuel with few impurities and a high carbon content, usually made from coal. It is the solid carbonaceous material derived from destructive distillation of low-ash, low-sulfur bituminous coal. Cokes made from coal are grey, hard, and porous. While coke can be formed naturally, the commonly used form is man-made. The form known as petroleum coke, or pet coke, is derived from oil refinery coker units or other cracking processes. === Smokeless fuel === Solid fuels which produce little smoke or volatiles are made from powdered anthracite coal and supplied in the form of briquettes usually for domestic use either in stoves or open fireplaces. The fuel is replacing coal as a fuel for open fires because of the reduction in particulate emissions and its increased efficiency. Smokeless fuel burns at a higher temperature and more slowly than a coal fire. The term also includes charcoal, made by restricted combustion of dry wood, is also widely used for open air barbecues with food cooked on an open fire. === Municipal waste === Municipal solid waste commonly known as trash or garbage in the United States and as rubbish in Britain, is a waste type consisting of everyday items that are discarded by the public. It can be burnt to create electrical energy by careful control of the waste stream. With the correct technology it can also be gasified and converted to a viable fuel source. However, this is technology heavy and can only be used where the waste is known not to contain toxic materials.[Wilson and Burgh. (2008). Energizing Our Future: Rational Choices For The 21st Century. New Jersey: John Wiley & Sons, Inc.] === Rocket propellant === Solid rocket propellant consists of a solid oxidizer (such as ammonium nitrate) bound with flakes or powders of energy compounds (such as RDX) plus binders, plasticizers, stabilizers and other additives. Solid propellant is much easier to store and handle than liquid propellant. It also has a higher energy density so it does not require as large of a space for the same amount of stored energy. ==Calorific value== The heat available from each type of fuel is very variable, and depends on the carbon and hydrogen content, as well as non-combustible or ash and water content. One measure of the heat produced by burning is the Heat of combustion, an exact measure usually determined using bomb calorimetry and demanding complete combustion to carbon dioxide and water. Gaseous fuels like methane have higher values than solid fuels like coal, and peat exhibits the lowest value of all common fuels. Thus methane has an HHV (Higher heating value) of 55.50 MJ/kg, the highest value of common fuels. Diesel fuel has an HHV value of 44.80 MJ/kg and anthracite coal a value of 32.50 MJ/kg. Moisture and ash-free firewood has a lower value of 21.70 MJ/kg while dry peat has the lowest value of all common fuels of about 15.00 MJ/kg. These are somewhat ideal values and the actual heat realized by any fuel will depend on the fireplace or combustion chamber used and its design for example. But they do give a useful guide to the heat available from any fuel. Dry wood has roughly two thirds the calorific value of coal so a greater weight is needed to make the same amount of heat. ==Benefits/disadvantages of solid fuel== Solid fuels, compared to liquid fuels or gaseous fuels, are often cheaper, easier to extract, more stable to transport and in many places are more readily available. Coal, in particular, is utilized in the generation of 38.1% of the world‚Äôs electricity because it is less expensive than its liquid and gas counterparts. However, solid fuels are also heavier to transport, require more destructive methods to extract/burn and often have higher carbon, nitrate and sulphate emissions. With the exception of sustainable wood/biomass solid fuel is normally considered non-renewable as it requires thousands of years to form. ==See also== * Bagasse * Biofuel * Biomass * Fossil fuel * Synthetic fuel * Nuclear power ==References== ==Further reading== * \\"CO2 Emissions (metric tons per capita).\\" Data.

She was launched on 6 November 1982 sponsored by Mrs. Sheila M. Watkins, and commissioned as a fleet ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) on 11 February 1984, with Captain A. W. Kuester commanding the Blue crew and Captain M. P. Gray commanding the Gold crew. This ship was later converted to a guided missile submarine (SSGN) for carrying guided cruise missiles instead of fleet ballistic missiles in its missile compartment. == Operational history == USS Georgias ship's crest when she was an SSBN From March to April 1984 she went on her shakedown cruise and test-launched a Trident C-4 missile in the Eastern Test Range on 7 April 1986. In November 1984, she arrived in her home port of Bangor, Washington. In January 1985 she started her first strategic deterrence patrol. As an element of Task Unit 14.7.1 from September 1983 to May 1986, she was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation. She was awarded her second Meritorious Unit Commendation for Submarine Operations between February 1986 to August 1986. On 22 March 1986, three miles south of Midway Island, harbor tug had just completed a personnel transfer from Georgia, picking up a submarine crewman who was going on emergency leave, when Secota lost power and got hung up on Georgias starboard stern plane while the sub's propeller continued to turn. That sank Secota within two minutes. Ten people were rescued, including the Georgia crewman who had just transferred to Secota. Two Secota crewmen trapped in her engine room were lost. While Lt. Cmdr. John Carman, a Navy spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Fleet, told the media that the Georgia was undamaged, a report sent by the Commanding Officer of the Georgia indicates that after returning the surviving Secota crew members to Hawaii, Georgia underwent emergency repairs for minor damage sustained in the collision. Her Gold crew was awarded the Comsubron Seventeen Battle Efficiency Award for 2001. On 30 October 2003, Georgia returned from her 65th and last deterrent patrol. On 7 November 2003, while Georgia was docked at Bangor, Washington, her C-4 Trident I missiles were offloaded. The process proceeded smoothly until tube number 16. When each tube was opened, a ladder was lowered into the tube so a sailor could climb down and attach a hoist to lift the missile. After attaching the hoist to the missile in tube 16, the sailor climbed out, and the crew took a break without removing the ladder. When they returned, they began to hoist the missile, pulling against the ladder and cutting a hole in its nose cone. No radioactive material was released. Three enlisted men in the missile handling team faced a court-martial. The Strategic Weapons Facility Pacific was immediately shut down and inspected by the Navy, and failed to pass. SWFPAC's commanding officer, Captain Keith Lyles, was relieved of command on 19 December 2003, followed by his executive officer, Commander Phillip Jackson, weapons officer, Commander Marshall Millett, and Master Chief Petty Officer of the Command Steven Perry. SWFPAC reopened after passing inspection under a new commanding officer on 9 January 2004. Georgias crew was unaffected. == Conversion to SSGN == Georgia was redesignated to SSGN on 1 March 2004. In October 2004 she participated as the command node of Exercise Silent Hammer to validate and showcase the new Joint Warfare and ISR capabilities. In March 2005, Georgia entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard for her scheduled Engineered Refueling Overhaul. The SSGN conversion took place concurrently. The conversion and refitting work was completed in February 2008. After the refit, Georgia moved to her new home port in Kings Bay, Georgia. Georgia was officially welcomed home in Kings Bay, Georgia, on 28 March 2008 in a return to service ceremony attended by Governor Sonny Perdue. On August 2009, Georgia began first SSGN deployment. On January 2010, Georgia earned Squadron SIXTEEN battle efficiency \\"E\\" for 2009. GEORGIA Blue crew earns Squadron SIXTEEN Engineering Red \\"E\\", Navigation Red and Green \\"N\\". In December 2010, a foreign material, i.e., a bolt, was left in the submarine's reduction gears. It caused $2.2 million in damage and forced the boat into three months of repairs. One officer and several enlisted sailors were disciplined over the mishap.Fellman, Sam, \\"$2.2 Million Sub Mishap Was 'Avoidable,' Report Says\\", Military Times, 14 May 2012. On 25 November 2015, Georgia struck a channel buoy and subsequently grounded whilst entering the Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base. The ship was placed into drydock for inspection and repairs which cost about $1 million. The navy stated that the damage was limited to the exterior of the sub and the hull was not compromised. The commanding officer of the Blue crew at the time of the accident - Captain David Adams - was relieved of duty on 4 January 2016 by Rear Adm. Randy Crites. ==In fiction and documentary== *Georgia is featured prominently in the 2012 naval thriller Fire of the Raging Dragon by Don Brown. *The Discovery Channel documentary Submarines: Sharks of Steel (1993) features Georgia and her crew. == References == :This article includes information collected from the Naval Vessel Register and various press releases. == External links == * * ‚Äì Life as a SSBN * ‚Äì Conversion to SSGN * [ USS Georgia Official Navy Home Page] * USS Georgia (SSBN-729/SSGN-729) command histories ‚Äì Naval History & Heritage Command Category:Ships built in Groton, Connecticut Category:Ohio-class submarines Category:Nuclear submarines of the United States Navy Category:United States Navy Georgia-related ships Category:1982 ships ","title":"USS Georgia (SSGN-729)"},{"id":"522727","text":"A vision mixer.

In Otto Erich Deutsch's catalogue of Schubert's works, it is D. 827. The song, a meditation on night and dreams, is marked \\"Sehr langsam\\" (very slowly) and is in the key of B major (with a modulation to the flattened submediant, G major, in the middle). There is a single dynamic indication, \\"pianissimo\\" (very quietly), which does not change throughout the song. The piano plays broken chords in semiquavers for the song's duration in a manner similar to bar five (the bar in which the voice enters), for example: :File:Nacht und traume bar 5.png A typical performance will last around three to four minutes. A version in the Spaun family collection has the different tempo marking \\"Langsam, Sempre legato\\" (Slow, Always legato). The original publication erroneously attributed the text to Friedrich Schiller. \\"Nacht und Tr√§ume\\" is one of several Schubert songs that Max Reger arranged for voice and orchestra.

His father was a music teacher who bought him an acoustic bass, electric bass, and amp when he was 12. He heard classical music from a young age and was educated in classical until high school when he learned jazz. During high school summers, he went to jazz camps, where he met Pat Metheny, Lyle Mays, and Danny Gottlieb, three of the four members of The Pat Metheny Group. Rodby played acoustic bass until he graduated from Northwestern University in 1977, when he taught himself how to play electric. He performed in the house band at the Jazz Showcase in Chicago, with local and visiting musicians such as Milt Jackson, Joe Henderson, and Art Farmer. He joined the Pat Metheny Group in 1981, starting on electric bass before spending most of his time on acoustic. He spent the next thirty years at Metheny's side, touring, recording, and producing, in Group projects and in Metheny's other projects. With Metheny he earned multiple Grammy awards and nominations, and admiration from critics, magazines, and reader polls. Rodby collaborated with Fred Simon and Paul McCandless on two albums: Since Forever and Remember the River. In 2011 he collaborated with Paul Wertico, a former drummer for the Metheny Group, and with Israeli musicians Danny Markovitch and Dani Rabin on Marbin's album Breaking the Cycle. ==Discography== With Ross Traut * Great Lawn (Columbia, 1987) * The Duo Life (Columbia, 1991) ==As sideman== With Pat Metheny Group * Offramp (ECM, 1982) ‚Äì bassist * Travels (ECM, 1983) ‚Äì bassist * First Circle (ECM, 1984) ‚Äì bassist * The Falcon and the Snowman (EMI, 1985) ‚Äì bassist, conductor * Still Life (Talking) (Geffen Records, 1987) ‚Äì bassist, co-producer * Letter from Home (Geffen Records, 1989) ‚Äì bassist, co-producer * The Road to You (Geffen Records, 1993) ‚Äì bassist, co-producer * We Live Here (Geffen Records, 1995) ‚Äì bassist, co-producer * Quartet (Geffen Records, 1996) ‚Äì bassist, co-producer * Imaginary Day (Warner Bros, 1997) ‚Äì bassist, co- producer * Speaking of Now (Warner Bros, 2002) ‚Äì bassist, co-producer * The Way Up (Nonesuch, 2005) ‚Äì bassist, co-producer With Pat Metheny * Secret Story (Geffen Records, 1992) ‚Äì bassist, co-producer * A Map of the World (Warner Bros, 1999) ‚Äì bassist, co-producer * Trio 99 ‚Üí 00 (Warner Bros, 2000) ‚Äì co- producer * Trio ‚Üí Live (Warner Bros, 2000) ‚Äì co-producer * Day Trip (Nonesuch, 2008) ‚Äì co-producer * Tokyo Day Trip (Nonesuch, 2008) ‚Äì co-producer * Orchestrion (Nonesuch, 2010) ‚Äì co-producer * Unity Band (Nonesuch, 2012) ‚Äì co- producer * The Orchestrion Project (Nonesuch, 2013) ‚Äì co-producer * KIN (‚Üê‚Üí) (Nonesuch, 2014) ‚Äì co-producer * The Unity Sessions (Nonesuch, 2016) ‚Äì co- producer * From This Place (Nonesuch, 2020) ‚àí co-producer With Simon & Bard Group * Musaic (Flying Fish, 1980) ‚Äì bassist * Tear It Up (Flying Fish, 1982) ‚Äì bassist * The Enormous Radio (Flying Fish, 1984) ‚Äì bassist With Michael Brecker * Nearness of You: The Ballad Book (Verve Records, 2001) ‚Äì co-producer * Pilgrimage (Heads Up, 2007) ‚Äì co-producer With Eliane Elias * Dreamer (Bluebird, 2004) ‚Äì co-producer * Something for You: Eliane Elias Sings & Plays Bill Evans (Blue Note, 2007) ‚Äì co-producer * Bossa Nova Stories (Blue Note, 2009) ‚Äì co-producer * Light My Fire (Concord Picante, 2011) ‚Äì co-producer * I Thought About You (Concord Jazz, 2013) ‚Äì co-producer * Made In Brazil (Concord Jazz, 2015) ‚Äì co-producer, recorded * Dance of Time (Concord Jazz, 2017) ‚Äì co- producer * Love Stories (Concord Jazz, 2019) ‚Äì co-producer With Lyle Mays * Street Dreams (Geffen Records, 1988) ‚Äì bassist, co-producer, conductor * Fictionary (Geffen Records, 1993) ‚Äì co-producer * Solo (Improvisations For Expanded Piano) (Geffen Records, 2000) ‚Äì co-producer With Pat Coil * Schemes And Dreams (Sheffield Lab, 1994) ‚Äì bassist, co-producer * Gold (Sheffield Lab, 1996) ‚Äì bassist With Fred Simon * Usually/Always (Windham Hill Records, 1988) - bassist, producer, editing * Open Book (Columbia, 1991) ‚Äì bassist, co- producer * Remember the River by (Naim, 2004) ‚Äì bassist * Since Forever (Naim, 2009) ‚Äì bassist, producer, editing With Steve Cole * Spin (Narada Jazz, 2005) ‚Äì bassist * True (Narada Jazz, 2005) - bassist With Paul McCandless * Heresay (Windham Hill Records, 1988) ‚Äì bassist * Premonition (Windham Hill Records, 1992) ‚Äì bassist, producer * Navigator (Landslide Records, 1994) ‚Äì bassist With others * Madelaine, Who Is She...

Formerly a Republican Party strategist before becoming an Independent, Phillips became disaffected with the party from the 1990s, and became a critic. He is a regular contributor to the Los Angeles Times, Harper's Magazine, and National Public Radio, and was a political analyst on PBS' NOW with Bill Moyers. Phillips was a strategist on voting patterns for Richard Nixon's 1968 campaign, which was the basis for a book, The Emerging Republican Majority, which predicted a conservative political realignment in national politics, and is widely regarded as one of the most influential recent works in political science. His predictions regarding shifting voting patterns in presidential elections proved accurate, though they did not extend \\"down ballot\\" to Congress until the Republican revolution of 1994. Phillips also was partly responsible for the design of the Republican \\"Southern strategy\\" of the 1970s and 1980s. The author of fourteen books, he lives in Goshen, Connecticut. ==Southern strategy== Phillips worked for Richard Nixon's presidential campaign in 1968, and afterwards wrote a book on what has come to be known as the \\"Southern strategy\\" of the Republican Party. The book was entitled The Emerging Republican Majority and argued that the southern states of the US would keep the Republicans winning Presidential Elections and more than offset the Northeast states, based on racial politics. As he stated to the New York Times Magazine in 1970, > All the talk about Republicans making inroads into the Negro vote is > persiflage. Even 'Jake the Snake' [Senator Jacob Javits of New York] only > gets 20 percent. From now on, Republicans are never going to get more than > 10 to 20 percent of the Negro vote, and they don't need any more than > that... but Republicans would be shortsighted if they weakened the Voting > Rights Act. The more Negroes who register as Democrats in the South, the > sooner the Negrophobe whites will quit the Democrats and become Republicans. > That's where the votes are. Without that prodding from the blacks, the > whites will backslide into their old comfortable arrangement with the local > Democrats. The book however wasn't used in the campaign itself, Phillips notes in the preface to the Princeton Edition, > Some observers concluded that The Emerging Republican Majority was the > emerging Republican strategy. Newsweek labeled the book \\"The political bible > of the Nixon Era.\\" Not quite. The book was not a blueprint of the GOP's > \\"Southern Strategy\\" as some claimed,. ... Richard Nixon had read memos based > on the book's analyses during the week before the November 1968 election, > but in mid-1969 he truthfully said he had not read the actual book. He read > it a few months later. ==BooksAmerican Theocracy (2006)=== Rev. Dr. Allen Dwight Callahan Rev.

Phillips uses the term financialization to describe how the U.S. economy has been radically restructured from a focus on production, manufacturing and wages, to a focus on speculation, debt, and profits. Since the 1980s, Phillips argues in American Theocracy, > the underlying Washington strategy‚Ä¶ was less to give ordinary Americans > direct sums than to create a low-interest-rate boom in real estate, thereby > raising the percentage of American home ownership, ballooning the prices of > homes, and allowing householders to take out some of that increase through > low-cost refinancing.

This in itself confirmed the > massive realignment of preferences and priorities within the American > system‚Ä¶. Likewise, huge and indisputable but almost never discussed, were > the powerful political economics lurking behind the stimulus: the massive > rate-cut-driven post-2000 bailout of the FIRE (finance, insurance, and real > estate) sector, with its ever-climbing share of GDP and proximity to power. > No longer would Washington concentrate stimulus on wages or public-works > employment. The Fed's policies, however shrewd, were not rooted in an > abstraction of the national interest but in pursuit of its statutory mandate > to protect the U.S. banking and payments system, now inseparable from the > broadly defined financial-services sector. Critical reception American Theocracy was reviewed widely. The New York Times Book Review wrote \\"It is not without polemic, but unlike many of the more glib and strident political commentaries of recent years, it is extensively researched and frighteningly persuasive...\\"Alan Brinkley, The New York Times Book Review, March 19, 2006 The Chicago Sun-Times wrote \\"Overall, Phillips' book is a thoughtful and somber jeremiad, written throughout with a graceful wryness... a capstone to his life's work.\\"William O'Rourke, The Chicago Sun-Times, March 12, 2006. ===Bad Money (2008)=== Phillips examines America's great shift from manufacturing to financial services. He also discusses America's petroleum policies and the tying of the dollar to the price of oil. Phillips suggests that the Euro and the Chinese Yuan/Renminbi are favorites to take the dollar's place in countries hostile towards America, like Iran. He then tackles the lack of regulatory oversight employed in the housing market and how the housing boom was allowed to run free under Alan Greenspan. The book concludes with the proposal that America is employing bad capitalism and extends Gresham's Law of currency to suggest that our good capitalism will be driven out by the bad.Bad Money: Reckless Finance, Failed Politics, and the Global Crisis of American Capitalism (2008); ==Bibliography== * The Emerging Republican Majority (1969) * Mediacracy: American Parties and Politics in the Communications Age (1974) * Electoral Reform and Voter Participation (with Paul H.

Connolly was born in Sydney, Nova Scotia, the son of Richard Joseph Connolly and Annie Duffield. He was educated at St. Mary's College. As a newspaperman, he worked for the Halifax Chronicle before serving as editor of the Daily Star. He was first elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in a 1936 by-election as a Liberal in Halifax North after Gordon Benjamin Isnor was elected to the House of Commons. He was appointed to cabinet in 1941 as Minister of Industry and Publicity. He served as Minister of Industry and Trade from 1945 to 1950, when he became Minister of Public Health. When Premier Angus L. Macdonald died in 1954, Connolly became the province's premier and the Liberal party's interim leader. A Catholic, he was defeated by Henry Hicks at the party's leadership convention when Protestant delegates formed a united front against a Catholic leader, a move that caused a severe religious split within the party that contributed to its defeat two years later at the hands of Robert Stanfield's Progressive Conservatives. Connolly retired from provincial politics in 1955 when he was elevated to the Senate of Canada for the Halifax North, Nova Scotia division on 28 July 1955 following nomination by Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent. He served until his resignation on 14 May 1979. Connolly was a lieutenant in the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps and the Canadian Officers' Training Corps from 1940 to 1945. He married Catherine Burns in 1928; with whom he had 1 daughter, Catherine. He married Vivian Martel after the death of his first wife. He had five more children, Maureen, Dennis, David, Sharon and Patricia.

Starting in the 15th century and especially since the beginning of the 19th century, Jewish communities in Morocco were constrained to live in mellah districts in many Moroccan cities.Encyclopedia of the Jewish Diaspora: Origins, Experiences, and Culture, Volume 1, p. 306, refers to Bernard Lewis 1987. The name mellah derives from a local toponym in Fez which became the name of the first separate Jewish district in Morocco (the Mellah of Fez) created in that city during the 15th century. The term is often mistakenly conflated with European ghettos. In cities, a mellah was often surrounded by a wall with a fortified gateway. Usually, the Jewish quarter was situated near the royal palace or the residence of the governor, in order to protect its inhabitants from recurring riots since its inhabitants played a vital role in the local economy. In contrast, rural mellahs were separate villages inhabited solely by the Jews.Colin, Georges S. ‚ÄúMellƒÅ·∏•.‚Äù Encyclopaedia of Islam, First Edition (1913-1936)], April 24, 2012. ==HistoryOrigins of the first Mellah in Fez (15th century)=== The first Mellah of Morocco was created in the city of Fez. Fez had long hosted the largest and one of the oldest Jewish communities in Morocco, present since the city's foundation by the Idrisids (in the late 8th or early 9th century). Since the time of Idris II (early 9th century) a Jewish community was concentrated in the neighbourhood known as Foundouk el-Yihoudi (\\"hotel/warehouse of the Jew\\") near Bab Guissa in the northeast of the city. Nonetheless, historical evidence also shows that the Jewish population was widely distributed in many parts of the old city (Fes el-Bali) alongside the Muslim population, including near the Qarawiyyin Mosque in the heart of the city.Bab el-Mellah, the historic entrance to the Jewish Mellah of FezIn 1276 the Marinid sultan Abu Yusuf Ya'qub founded Fes el-Jdid, a new fortified administrative city to house their troops and the royal palace. The city included a southern district, known as Hims, which was initially inhabited by Muslim garrisons, particularly the Sultan's mercenary contingents of Syrian archers, that were later disbanded by Sultan Abu Sa'id. The same district, however, was also known by the name Mellah ( or 'saline area') due to either a saline water source in the area or to the presence of a former salt warehouse. It was this name which was later retained as the name of the eventual Jewish quarter in the area. The same name thus came to be associated by analogy with similar districts that were later created in many other cities such as Marrakesh. The name thus originally had no negative connotation but was rather just a local toponym. Nonetheless, over generations a number of legends and popular etymologies came to explain the origin of the word mellah as a \\"salted, cursed ground\\" or a place where the Jews were forced to \\"salt\\" the heads of decapitated rebels. Both the exact reasons and the exact date for the creation of a separate Jewish Mellah in Fez are not firmly agreed upon by all scholars. Historical accounts confirm that in the mid-14th century the Jews of Fez were still living in Fes el-Bali but that by the end of the 16th century they were well-established in the Mellah of Fes el-Jdid. Some authors argue that the transfer likely happened in stages across the Marinid period (late 13th to 15th centuries), particularly following episodes of violence or repression against Jews in the old city. The urban fabric of the Mellah appears to have developed progressively and it's possible that a small Jewish population settled here right after the foundation of Fes el-Jdid and that other Jews fleeing the old city joined them later. Some scholars, citing historical Jewish chronicles, attribute the date of the move more specifically the \\"rediscovery\\" of Idris II's body in his zawiya at the center of the old city (Fes el-Bali) in 1437. The area around the mosque, located in the middle of the city's main commercial districts where Jewish merchants were quite active, was turned into a horm (sanctuary) where non-Muslims were not allowed to enter, resulting in the expulsion of the Jewish inhabitants and businesses there. Many other scholars date the move generally to the mid-15th century. In any case, the transfer (whether progressive or sudden) occurred with some violence and hardship. Many Jewish households chose to convert (at least officially) rather than leave their homes and their businesses in the heart of the old city, resulting in a growing group referred to as al- Baldiyyin (Muslim families of Jewish origin, often retaining Jewish surnames). Jewish houses in the Mellah of Fez (photographed in 1932) Broader political motivations for moving the Jewish community to Fes el-Jdid, closer to the royal palace, may have included the rulers' desire to take more direct advantage (or control) of their artisan skills and of their commercial relations with Jewish communities in Europe and other countries (which, by extension, could also be used for diplomatic purposes). The Mellah's Jewish cemetery was even established on land which was donated to the Jewish community by a Marinid princess named Lalla Mina in the 15th century. The location next to the royal palace, within the more heavily fortified Fes el- Jdid, may have also been intended to better protect the Jewish community from the larger and more restive population of the old city; a pattern that would be repeated for future mellahs in other cities. Despite the more secure location, however, disasters still occasionally struck the community and its district. The 15th century was also a time of relative political instability, with the Wattasid viziers taking over effective control from the Marinid dynasty and competing with other local factions in Fez. In 1465, the Mellah was attacked by the Muslim population of Fes el-Bali during a revolt led by the shurafa (noble sharifian families) against the Marinid sultan Abd al-Haqq II and his Jewish vizier Harun ibn Battash. The attack resulted in thousands of Jewish inhabitants being killed, with many others having to openly renounce their faith. The community took at least a decade to recover from this, only growing again under the rule of the Wattasid sultan Muhammad al-Shaykh (1472-1505). Major changes in the Jewish population also took place when in 1492 the Spanish crown expelled all Jews from Spain, with Portugal doing the same in 1497. The following waves of Spanish Jews migrating to Fez and North Africa increased the Jewish population and also altered its social, ethnic, and linguistic makeup. The influx of migrants also revitalized Jewish cultural activity in the following years, while splitting the community along ethnic lines for many generations. In Fez, for example, the Megorashim of Spanish origin retained their heritage and their Spanish language while the indigenous Moroccan Toshavim, who spoke Arabic and were of Arab and Berber heritage, followed their own traditions. Members of the two communities worshiped in separate synagogues and were even buried separately. It was only in the 18th century that the two communities eventually blended together, with Arabic eventually becoming the main language of the entire community while the Spanish (Sephardic) minhag became dominant in religious practice; a situation which was repeated elsewhere in Morocco, with the notable exception of the Marrakesh community. ===16th‚Äì18th centuries=== alt= The Slat al-Azama Synagogue in MarrakeshFor a while, the mellah of Fez remained the only one. The second mellah was only created in the second half of the 16th century in Marrakesh, which by then had replaced Fez as the capital of Morocco under the new Saadian dynasty. Here too the Jewish population of the city had lived alongside the Muslim population. Many of them had come from the Atlas Mountain regions and from the nearby city of Aghmat, where a much older Jewish community had already existed. The Jewish district at the time was concentrated in what is now the Mouassine neighbourhood. In 1557-58 CE sultan Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib ordered that the Jewish population of the city relocate from here to an area next to the royal Kasbah (citadel), and construction of the new mellah was probably finished around 1562-63. The political motivations for this may have been similar to those of the Marinids in creating the Mellah of Fez, which served as a precedent followed by the Saadian dynasty. Additionally, however, Moulay Abdallah appeared to have been planning the creation of new \\"model\\" Muslim neighbourhoods in the city, centered around the new Mouassine Mosque which he immediately built on the newly-liberated land of the old Jewish neighbourhood. Another factor for the move may have been the rapid growth of the Jewish population due to the influx of Jewish migrants from Fez and other towns seeking economic opportunities in the capital. Incidentally, the new Mellah was indeed quite large and functioned as a city unto itself, with its own services and facilities. Despite this, some historical references indicate that Jews may have still been living in other parts of the city in the decades after the Mellah's creation. A Frenchman, who was held captive in Morocco from 1670 to 1681, wrote: \\"In Fez and in Morocco [that is, Marrakesh], the Jews are separated from the inhabitants, having their own quarters set apart, surrounded by walls of which the gates are guarded by men appointed by the King ... In the other towns, they are intermingled with the Moors.\\" In 1791, a European traveller described the Marrakesh mellah: \\"It has two large gates, which are regularly shut every evening about nine o'clock, after which time no person whatever is permitted to enter or go out... till... the following morning. The Jews have a market of their own...\\". The third mellah of Morocco wasn't created until 1682, when the Alaouite sultan Moulay Isma'il moved the Jewish population of Meknes, his new capital, to a new district on the southwest side of the city, next to the vast new kasbah or royal citadel that he was building for himself. In Fez, the 17th century saw a significant influx of Jews from the Tadla region and from the Sous Valley arriving under the reigns of the Alaouite sultans Moulay Rashid and Moulay Isma'il, respectively. A serious disaster, however, took place in 1790 to 1792 during a period of general turmoil for the city under Sultan Moulay Yazid. During these two years the sultan forced the entire Jewish community to move to the outlying Kasbah Cherarda on the other side of Fes el-Jdid. The Mellah was occupied by tribal troops allied to him, its synagogue was replaced by a mosque, and the Jewish cemetery and its contents were moved to a cemetery near Bab Guissa. Moreover, Moulay Yazid permanently reduced the size of the district by demolishing the old city walls around it and rebuilding them along a much smaller perimeter. It was only after the sultan's death that the chief Muslim qadi (judge) of Fez ordered the Mellah to be restored to the Jewish community, along with the demolition of the mosque built by Yazid's troops. ===19th century=== A Jewish house in Essaouira, by Darondeau (1807‚Äì1841) At the beginning of the 19th century, around 1807, sultan Sulayman forced Jews to move to mellahs in the towns of the coastal region, in Rabat, Sal√©, Essaouira, and Tetouan. (In Tetouan, the Spanish word juder√≠a was later used as the name of the district.) The mellah in Rabat was established in 1808 by Sultan Mawlay Sulaiman; this separated the Jewish and Muslim people who had lived together in a shared area of the city.Houtsma, M. Th. E.J. Brill‚Äôs First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913-1936. Vol. 5. BRILL, 1993. In Sal√©, the new Jewish quarter was a long avenue with a total of 200 houses, 20 shops and trading booths, two kilns and two mills. In 1865, the mellah of Essaouira, having become over-populated, was permitted to extend. During this century, the fortunes of the Jewish community of Fez in particular improved considerably as the expansion of contact and trade with Europe allowed the Jewish merchant class to place themselves at the center of international trade networks in Morocco. This also led to a greater social openness and a shift in tastes and attitudes, especially among richer Jews, who built luxurious residences in the upper parts of the Mellah there. ===20th century onwards=== In the early twentieth century affluent Jews started to move to the new neighborhoods (Villes nouvelles) planned along European urban schemes, leaving in the mellahs only the elderly and the poorest families. Since the establishment of the State of Israel, in 1948, almost all Moroccan Jews have emigrated either to the new Jewish state or to countries like France and Canada, some fleeing persecution and some encouraged by the Jewish Agency. As a result, nowadays mellahs are only inhabited by Muslims, the few remaining Jews have moved to modern quarters of Moroccan towns. The changing economy of Morocco has also meant that the majority of Moroccan Jews now live in the modern metropolis of Casablanca, with an estimated 5,000 living there in 1997 (with only 150 living in Fez, by comparison).alt=In Marakesh, parts of the mellah are showing signs of the gentrification in the 21st century. Only three Jewish families remain in the Mellah, with one of them taking care of the Slat al-Azama Synagogue, one of the few remaining in the area.Frank, Michael (May 30, 2015). \\"In Morocco, Exploring Remnants of Jewish History\\". The New York Times. Retrieved 2018-11-29.

The appearance of a mellah in a Persian Gulf port, in the account of a journey to China purportedly by a \\"Jacob of Ancona\\" and supposed to be made in 1271, that was published by David Selbourne in 1997 as The City of Light, was identified as a clear anachronism in the critical reaction to the book that judged it a hoax. The legacy of the Moroccan Jewish districts on commerce remain, as the markets constructed and brought alive by Jewish merchants not only exist today but still in the lively forms they served in previous centuries for the Jewish communities.

The former mellahs continue to be visited as historical sites. One writer notes: \\"The quarters‚Äô squalor still exists, but they‚Äôre also picturesque and bustling ‚Äî and that, too, speaks to Morocco‚Äôs vibrant Jewish past.\\" ==Culture== A preserved synagogue in Sefrou While the settling location of Jews was by Muslim rulers was typically imposed, the mellah existed in a relatively autonomous fashion, with Jews building and sustaining their own communities within the walls of their quarter. Indeed, there was resistance to forced relocation, but ultimately the Jewish mellah became a sanctified space that the Jews had pride for.A.I.U., Maroc II.B.9‚Äì 13, 10 March 1929, Goldenberg. > \\"The one gate that gave way to the medina, which could have easily been > repudiated as an emblem of imprisonment, instead came to be treated as an > object of reverence by the mellah ‚Äôs inhabitants, as we see in this > description from the early twentieth century: If one stops for a moment in > front of this gate, one sees a curious thing: All who pass, children, > beggars, peddlers driving their donkeys loaded with merchandise, old women, > hunched-over men, all approach this dusty wall and press their lips against > it with as much fervor as if they were kissing the holy Torah.\\" The mellahs of Morocco primarily came about as Jews migrated to Morocco after being expelled from the Iberian Peninsula during the Spanish Inquisition.Frank, Michael (May 30, 2015). \\"In Morocco, Exploring Remnants of Jewish History\\". The New York Times. Retrieved 2018-11-29. There were two primary justifications given for mellahization. First, these Jewish quarters were often in close proximity to the ruling local powers, offering a form of protection for the Jews. This explanation also addresses the resulting effective authority over differing religious populations; if all the Jews are physically together, it is easier to maintain effective muslim rule, assess taxes, and keep count of the community. The second justification of cause for the institution of the mellah is the idea that mellahs were a \\"collective punishment for specific transgressions.\\" Jews were associated with ethical deviance, physical malformation, and disease and so were separated from the Christian and Muslim populations. Organization relative to the city as a whole gives insight into how Jews were situated compared to the Muslim majority and how relevant these justifications are to specific mellahs. As Gilson Miller et al write: > \\"Sometimes the quarter is contained within the larger city and forms a > microcosm of it, such as the Jewish quarter of Tetuan; at other times, it is > removed from the molecular city and attached to the royal enclave, as in > Fez. The siting of the quarter invites speculation about its origins and the > relationship between the Jewish minority and the Muslim majority. Was the > purpose of the quarter to isolate its inhabitants, to safeguard them, or > both? In Fez, the proximity of the mellah to the royal palace is often read > as a sign of dependency of the Jews on the power and protection of the > ruling sovereign.\\" == Physical space and cultural interaction == The Jewish Cemetery in the Mellah of Fez Mellahs, walled on all four sides and typically gated, housed the Jewish population of Moroccan cities. As a result, these spaces fostered Jewish communal life through its physical structures. Mellahs were typically organized in neighborhoods and had synagogues, a Jewish cemetery, and kosher markets situated among other public areas. Even the synagogue itself facilitated a wide variety of Jewish communal needs including education, ritual baths, and spaces for children to play. While at first these quarters offered considerable comfort to Jewish families, with spacious homes and protection due to proximity to the royal palace these luxuries soon came to a close. > \\"Yet over time, the quarters‚Äô narrow streets became congested and overrun > with people, and they became synonymous with ghettos. The Jews were confined > to the inner walls of the rundown mellahs, and the areas became associated > with cursed, ‚Äúsalted‚Äù land, much like the Jews were perceived among Moroccan > society.\\" As Jews were key players in trade and commerce, mellahs were often situated on major waterways and were usually pretty close to each other to facilitate trade networks effectively.Goldberg, Harvey. ‚ÄúThe Mellahs of Southern Morocco: Report of a Survey.‚Äù The Maghreb Review, vol. 8, no. 3, ser. 4, 1983, pp. 61‚Äì69. Even more so, the mellah's market became a prominent space for not only the Jewish community, but non-Jewish peoples who would come to shop on market days. Because Jews commonly held merchant and artisan positions, the mellah was an attractive trade post for the entire city, not just the Jewish quarter. Separation certainly stifled cultural interaction to some degree, but Muslims were allowed to enter the mellah and did so if they needed goods and services that fell within the Jewish niche. ==See also== *Mellah of Fez *History of the Jews in Morocco *Aljama * Al Wifaq * Ghetto * Jewish Quarter ==References== Category:Jewish communities Category:Arabic words and phrases Category:Human habitats Category:Jews and Judaism in Morocco Category:Islam and antisemitism Category:Jewish ghettos ","title":"Mellah"},{"id":"522750","text":"Girls Club (sometimes styled in all-lowercase girls club) is an American television series created by David E.

Born in Bridgetown, Nova Scotia, the son of Henry Hicks and Annie Kinney, Hicks was educated in Bridgetown and at Mount Allison University, Dalhousie University and Oxford University. He was admitted to the Nova Scotia bar in 1941. During World War II, he served as a captain in the Royal Canadian Artillery. Hicks was elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in 1945 as a Liberal for Annapolis County and served as Nova Scotia's first Minister of Education from 1949 to 1954 in the government of Angus Lewis Macdonald. When Macdonald died, Hicks ran for the Liberal party leadership against interim leader and then Premier Harold Connolly. The party was badly split along religious lines with Protestants uniting behind Hicks to defeat Connolly who was a Roman Catholic. As the new Premier, Hicks was unable to unite the party and his government was defeated in the 1956 election by Robert Stanfield's Progressive Conservatives. Hicks resigned as Leader of the opposition in 1960 and took the post of Dean of Arts and Science at Dalhousie University. He later became a Vice President of the school and then President in 1963. He served as President until August 31, 1980 and is recognized as transforming Dalhousie University from a tiny \\"College By the Sea\\" into a leading national research university. During Hicks' tenure, the campus underwent a complete transformation as new facilities were built, expanded, or acquired for all areas of the university from academics and research to arts and athletics, as well as student housing. In September 2002, the Henry Hicks Academic Administration Building was named after him. In 1949, Hicks married Pauline Banks (d. February 1963). They had four children; Catherine, Henry, John, and Francess. In 1965, he married Gene Morrison (d. January 1988). In 1988, he married Rosalie Comeau (d. December 1990). In 1970, Hicks was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. On April 27, 1972, he was appointed to the Senate of Canada by Pierre Trudeau, and served in that capacity until his retirement on March 5, 1990. On the afternoon of December 9, 1990, Hicks and his wife Rosalie were returning to Halifax from the Annapolis Valley when their vehicle crossed the centre line and struck an oncoming car. Hicks and his wife were killed, along with two of the four passengers in the other vehicle. The British TV presenter Richard Madeley is a distant relative of Hicks. == References == * * Marble, A.E.

These animals are called \\"secondarily aquatic\\" because although their ancestors lived on land for hundreds of millions of years, they all originally descended from aquatic animals (see Evolution of tetrapods). These ancestral tetrapods had never left the water, and were thus primarily aquatic, like modern fishes. Secondary aquatic adaptations tend to develop in early speciation as the animal ventures into water in order to find available food. As successive generations spend more time in the water, natural selection causes the acquisition of more adaptations. Animals of later generations may spend the majority of their life in the water, coming ashore for mating. Finally, fully adapted animals may take to mating and birthing in water or ice. ==Anapsid== Archelon is a type of giant sea turtle dating from the Cretaceous Period, now long extinct. Its smaller cousins survive as the sea turtles of today. Mesosaurus (and other mesosaurids) were another group of anapsid reptiles to secondarily return to the sea, eschewing shells, and are also long extinct. ==Diapsid== Living at the same time as, but not closely related to, dinosaurs, the mosasaurs resembled crocodiles but were more strongly adapted to marine life. They became extinct 66 million years ago, at the same time as the dinosaurs. Modern diapsids which have made their own adaptions to allow them to spend significant time in the water include marine iguanas and marine crocodiles. Sea snakes are extensively adapted to the marine environment, giving birth to live offspring in the same way as the Euryapsida (see below) and are largely incapable of terrestrial activity. The arc of their adaptation is evident by observing the primitive Laticauda genus, which must return to land to lay eggs. ==Euryapsida== These marine reptiles had ancestors who moved back into the oceans. In the case of ichthyosaurs adapting as fully as the dolphins they superficially resemble, even giving birth to live offspring instead of laying eggs. Euryapsida is now no longer considered a valid taxonomic group (Motani, 2009). ==Cetacea== During the Paleocene Epoch (about 66 - 55 million years ago), the ancient whale Pakicetus began pursuing an amphibious lifestyle in rivers or shallow seas. It was the ancestor of modern whales, dolphins, and porpoises. The cetacea are extensively adapted to marine life and cannot survive on land at all. Their adaptation can be seen in many unique physiognomic characteristics such as the dorsal blowhole, baleen teeth, and the cranial 'melon' organ used for aquatic echolocation. The closest extant terrestrial relative to the whale is the hippopotamus, which spends much of its time in the water and whose name literally means \\"horse of the river\\". ==Sirenians== The ancestors of the dugong and manatees first appeared in the fossil record about 45 to 50 million years ago in the ocean. ==Pinnipeds== The fossil records show that phocids existed 12 to 15 million years ago, and odobenids about 14 million years ago. Their common ancestor must have existed even earlier than that. ==Polar bears== Although polar bears spend most of their time on the ice rather than in the water, polar bears show the beginnings of aquatic adaptation to swimming (high levels of body fat and nostrils that are able to close), diving, and thermoregulation. Distinctly polar bear fossils can be dated to about 100,000 years ago. The polar bear has thick fur and layers of fat on its body to protect it from the cold. ==Speculative theoriesHumans=== Proponents of the aquatic ape hypothesis believe that part of human evolution includes some aquatic adaptation, which has been said to explain human hairlessness, bipedalism, increased subcutaneous fat, descended larynx, vernix caseosa, a hooded nose and various other physiological and anatomical changes.

He first appeared in Strange Adventures #205 (October 1967), and was created by Arnold Drake and Carmine Infantino. ==Publication history== Cover for The Deadman Collection (2001) by Neal Adams Deadman's first appearance in Strange Adventures #205, written by Arnold Drake and drawn by Carmine Infantino, included the first known depiction of narcotics in a story approved by the Comics Code Authority. The series is most associated with the art and writing of Neal Adams and the writing of Jack Miller, who took over from Infantino and Drake after the first story. The first story and all of the Adams stories were reprinted in 1985 as a seven- issue series. Although he appeared from time to time in the 1970s and 1980s as a supporting character in various comics, including Jack Kirby's Forever People, Deadman did not get his own series again until 1986, in a four-issue limited series written by Andrew Helfer and drawn by Jos√© Luis Garc√≠a-L√≥pez, which picked up the story where Adams left off. Deadman's next major storyline was in Action Comics Weekly, in 1988‚Äì1989. After this, he starred in the two- issue series Deadman: Love After Death, drawn by Kelley Jones and written by Mike Baron. This was followed by the limited series Deadman: Exorcism in 1992, also written by Mike Baron and drawn by Kelley Jones. Jones' gaunt, zombie- like rendition of the character would later appear in the pages of Batman. There was a Deadman ongoing series in 2002, which lasted nine issues, as well as a couple of standalone issues. His cameo appearances also continued, including several issues of Alan Moore's run on Swamp Thing, and Neil Gaiman's The Books of Magic. He had a cameo in books two and three of Batman: Gotham County Line, which was released in November 2005. In 2009, Deadman was a featured title in the Wednesday Comics. The character and self-titled series have won several awards, including the 1967 Alley Award for Best New Strip (by Arnold Drake and Carmine Infantino in Strange Adventures), and the 1968 Alley Award Hall of Fame (for Neal Adams). DC Comics published a slipcased hardcover edition collecting the original Deadman stories in December 2001. Deadman's retconned origin is revealed in Brightest Day #14 (2010), written by Geoff Johns and Peter Tomasi. Deadman has a 3-part mini-series called Deadman: Dark Mansion of Forbidden Love written by Sarah Vaughn and the art was done by Lan Medina. ==Fictional character biography== Deadman is a ghost, formerly a circus trapeze artist named Boston Brand who performed under the name Deadman, a stage persona including a red costume and white corpse makeup. When Brand is murdered during a trapeze performance by a mysterious assailant known only as the Hook, his spirit is given the power to possess any living being by a Hindu god named \\"Rama Kushna\\" in order to search for his murderer and obtain justice. It is established in Green Arrow Vol. 4, #4, that Deadman believes Rama is the supreme being of the universe. At the end of the Neal Adams story line, Deadman seems to discover the truth behind his murder and the ultimate fate of Hook, who killed Deadman as part of an initiation into a society of contract killers who then kill him to silence him. However, the real Hook is one among many one-handed men who work for an organization known as \\"The Scavengers\\". This group steals advanced technology for a profit. Fighting the Scavengers also led to Deadman gaining an artificial body for some time, thanks to the influence of the Forever People. This group had rented rooms from Trixie Magruder, an old circus companion of Deadman.Forever People Vol. 1 #9‚Äì10 (July, August 1972) ===Various missions=== Rama also maintained a city for some time, called Nanda Parbat. The most evil people in the world came to live there, where Rama's power kept them sane and good. One of the worst was Darius Caldera, who almost destroyed the world when he left the city. Nanda later fell due to a combined military and mystical force. All the evil people are now back in the real world, still a danger. Brand's twin brother, Cleveland, is killed while possessed by Boston, while doing Boston's circus act. The killer was out to kill Boston Brand. His \\"benefactor\\", Rama Kushna, also dies in order to defeat Jonah, a spirit similar to Deadman. Around this time, Deadman assists the Spectre in defeating a newly formed demonic being and werewolves. Formed from the skeletons of many souls in hell, this blue- eyed, blonde-haired being comes to Earth to foment chaos and death. It manages to actually remove much of the Spectre's substance. Deadman is forced to merge with Spectre until things are stabilized. Later, Deadman receives a birthday present from his diminutive friend, Max Loomis. Max places himself in a trance so he could \\"meet\\" Deadman and the two take a pleasant journey down \\"memory lane\\", mainly Deadman's more pleasant memories of Nanda Parbat. Soon after, Loomis meets with old circus friends and Deadman involves himself in a case of suspected murder. Deadman wants to go after the escapees of Nanda Parbat, but Max thinks pursuing the murder is a better course.Deadman #1‚Äì4 (Feb.-May 2002) Over several years, a mysterious stranger has Deadman travel through time to try to save the souls of deceased heroes from the menace of Caldera. Due to the mental influence of various forces, Deadman is unable to use the knowledge of the timestream to benefit humanity. With the assistance of the spirits of the deceased heroes, Deadman defeats Caldera and the powers behind him. Max Loomis provides vital help on the material plane. After that, Boston and Loomis decide to hunt down the other Parbat escapees.Deadman: Dead Again #1‚Äì5 (June‚ÄìOctbober 2001) ===Youth and Hell=== In the Sins of Youth incident, Deadman is one of the dozens of heroes reduced to a preteen age by Klarion the Witch Boy and an alien machine owned by Doiby Dickles. He is still a spirit, now with a lower-case d on his chest. He assists Secret in confronting Teekl, Klarion's companion, in an effort to restore everyone. He also joins in the fight against mystically created and mystically altered villains. During the Day of Judgment incident, Boston Brand travels with a group of heroes to the frozen wastelands of Hell. Their goal is to restart the demonic fires, thus recalling all the demons from the earthly plane. An accident strands Brand and the others under the frozen waters of the River Styx, forcing them to live out what would be, to them, Hell. For Brand, it is that the sharpshooter hits him in the shoulder, thus he survives. Brand feels he needs to die in order to learn \\"how to live\\". His battles against the demons would come back to haunt him. In the four-part Black Baptism miniseries, Deadman and several other \\"Sentinels of Magic\\", the magical group formed out of the Day of Judgment incident, are hunted by the Diablos. Partly fueled by revenge, they subdue many of the Sentinels and drain their magic. The JLA eventually rescue them all and destroy all the Diablos. ===Blackest Night=== Boston Brand begins to hear the voices of the dead and his own remains calling for him to protect them.Blackest Night #2 (August 2009) Being a spirit, he is unable to stop his body from being raised as a Black Lantern.

Deadman then frees Batman and Red Robin, who had frozen themselves to escape the Black Lanterns' onslaught.Blackest Night: Batman #3 (October 2009) He is later seen inside the Black Lantern Damage's ring, apparently having followed Jean Loring, Mera and the Atom when they shrank down into it.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #49 (December 2009) He frees Mera and the Atom from Loring by briefly possessing her, allowing them time to return to normal size. During this incident he says he believes possessing the Black Lanterns causes him damage.Blackest Night #6 (December 2009) He is later seen at Nanda Parbat, attempting to stop the Black Lanterns attempting to pass through the spiritual barrier by taking over their bodies and ripping them apart. He briefly loses himself to a Black Lantern's personality, but is saved by the Phantom Stranger. The Stranger convinces Deadman to enter his body again, telling them it is his destiny to bring it within Nanda Parbat. With the Stranger's help, Deadman is able to force the black ring off his body, bringing it through the gate of Nanda Parbat. The body, which the Stranger states is of \\"singular importance\\", is placed under the gatekeeper and Blue Devil's protection, and Deadman heads out, intent on sharing the information he gleaned while inside the Black Lanterns with Hal Jordan.Phantom Stranger #44 (January 2010) In the aftermath of the final battle, Deadman, wearing a White Lantern ring, is resurrected by the power of the white light.Blackest Night #8 (March 2010) ===Brightest Day=== In the 2010‚Äì11 miniseries Brightest Day, Deadman discovers that his white power ring can restore the dead to life,Brightest Day #0 (April 2010) and begins to acclimate to living again, including exercising self-preservational habits,Brightest Day #3 (June 2010) though he expresses reservations about being alive again.

In learning to appreciate his new life, Deadman realizes that he and Dove have fallen in love,Brightest Day #14 (November 2010) and reconnects with his grandfather.Brightest Day #17 (January 2011) The Entity also tells Deadman that when Nekron attacked Earth, the contamination of his presence on the planet manifested itself in the form of a \\"dark avatar\\" who will try to destroy the Star City forest, which is the key to saving Earth's soul.Brightest Day #19 (February 2011) The Entity reveals that Earth's savior is Alec Holland,Brightest Day #23 (April 2011) and the \\"dark avatar\\" is a corrupted Swamp Thing, which once thought that it was Holland, but now believes itself to be Nekron. In the forest, Captain Boomerang throws one of his deadly boomerangs at Dove, but it impacts Deadman instead. As his dying act, he gives his white power ring to Holland, transforming him into a new Swamp Thing, who destroys the corrupted, original Swamp Thing. Unable to return to life, Deadman and Dove, heartbroken at being denied a happy life now that he can never again be resurrected, share an emotional farewell.Brightest Day #24 (April 2011) ===The New 52=== In The New 52, Deadman's origins are rebooted in the initial run of DC Universe Presents, a new anthology book. After living a selfish life as Boston Brand, he is forced to possess people as Deadman following his assassination, in order to set problems in their lives right, so he can avoid an eternity in Hell. He also features as a member of the Justice League Dark, a new team of DC's more supernatural characters. Deadman uses his possession talents to help take down various supernatural threats, such as Dr. Mist and Faust Sr. Despite their earlier claim, he and Dove try to rekindle their love. However, their attempt fails miserably as Deadman insists on carrying on their relationship forward using borrowed bodies, while Dove shows disdain and repulsion to the idea. Furthermore, by helping out June Moone, they both gain the enmity of a crazed Enchantress.Justice League Dark #2 (2011) ===DC Rebirth=== As part of the DC Rebirth continuity, a three-part miniseries, Deadman: Dark Mansion of Forbidden Love was released in October 2016.DEADMAN: DARK MANSION OF FORBIDDEN LOVE #1 on DCComics.com The story featured the creative team of Sarah Vaugham (writer) and Lan Medina (artist).Sarah Vaughn On ‚ÄòDeadman: Dark Mansion‚Äô And Why Queer Ghost Stories Matter by Elle Collins, Comics Alliance, February 17, 2017 Deadman also appears in the Trinity book, focused on Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman, along with his fellow Justice League Dark teammates Zatanna and John Constantine. ==Powers and abilities== As a disembodied spirit, Deadman could not be seen or heard by most others (certain mystics could still perceive him), was able to pass through objects, and could fly or float. He was able to possess any living being (human or animal), control their actions, and could communicate with people through another's body. In one storyline, however, he could not control certain criminal henchmen he possessed due to their minds being under post-hypnotic suggestion (since their minds were not truly theirs in that instance). The people he possessed retained no memory of the experience. He has issues possessing those with stronger minds like Batman and is often forced out in a short amount of time. Deadman also has problems with magic as his spiritual form can be manipulated by it to some degree. As a living human, he is an Olympic-level athlete well-trained in acrobatics. As a wearer of a White power ring he possesses whatever powers the ring confers upon its wielder. These powers, so far, include flight, invisibility (or the ability to cloak his presence), teleportation, healing severe wounds, making solid energy constructs, and the power to bring beings back to life. However, he had no control over these new powers and the scope and limitations on those powers are as yet undefined. The Black Lantern power ring gave his reanimated corpse similar abilities, however it reanimates the dead instead of fully resurrecting them. ==Other versionsKingdom Come=== Deadman appeared twice briefly in Mark Waid and Alex Ross' Elseworlds story Kingdom Come, first as an extra in a metahuman bar (alongside Rorschach, Obsidian, and the Question) where he offered some words of encouragement to Norman McCay. He appears as a skeleton wearing the tattered remains of his Deadman uniform. He introduces himself as simply \\"Boston\\", and also appears in the sequel The Kingdom as a guide to time-lost, deceased versions of Superman. This version of Deadman was made into an action figure by DC Direct for Series 3 of their Kingdom Come line. ===The Books of Magic=== Deadman also appears in Neil Gaiman's story The Books of Magic, looking very similar to his appearance in Kingdom Come. He possesses the body of several people throughout the comic, trying to warn Timothy Hunter about a coming danger. ===Vertigo=== In 2006, Vertigo a DC Comics imprint, announced that it would trade some of its trademark characters with others of DC's. Among the swaps was Vertigo's Jonah Hex in exchange for Deadman. The result was a continuing series published later that year. ===Bizarro World=== Deadman also had a brief comic in the book Bizarro World where he was interested in meeting girls and dating while in Limbo. ===Superman & Batman: Generation II=== During Superman & Batman: Generations II, Deadman is summoned by Doctor Occult to assist the third Batman (Bruce Wayne, Junior, the son of the first Batman) to investigate the elderly Joker's apparent delusions that Batman is trying to kill him. By possessing the Joker's body, Deadman discovers that the Joker is being haunted by the ghost of Dick Grayson. Grayson's ghost is seeking revenge, as the Joker killed him when Grayson was in the role of Batman. While the Joker's insane mind makes it difficult for Deadman to possess the criminal, he is able to hold on long enough to allow the ghost of Alfred Pennyworth to convince the ghost of Grayson that is his time to pass on. ===Superman/Batman=== Deadman appeared briefly in Jeph Loeb's \\"Absolute Power\\" story arc in Superman/Batman, in which he attempted to possess Superman after he and Batman killed off all the monks of Nanda Parbat (under orders from their adoptive parents, who saw the monks as a threat to their plans in an alternate timeline). Deadman is prevented from using Superman's strength to kill Batman when Batman uses a spell from Zatanna to trap Deadman inside a crystal. ===Flashpoint=== In the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint storyline, Boston Brand is a part of the Haly's Circus, featured in a show alongside the Flying Graysons. Boston is still as obnoxious and arrogant as he was before he died and does not wish to be a part of the circus. Brand makes fun of the circus' fortune teller Doctor Fate until Fate gives him a vision of Boston himself standing over a dead Dick Grayson. Before the next show, Boston tries to convince Dick to go solo as he himself had. However, Dick tells him that family means too much to him. Dick poses the question that Boston's seeming fearlessness could stem from his insecurity of being alone.Flashpoint: Deadman and the Flying Graysons #1 (June 2011) Haley Circus is attacked by Amazons who want the Helm of Nabu. While Boston, along with the circus, is running away from the Amazons, they are rescued by the Resistance member Vertigo. When they are hiding, Boston tells Dick to leave his father since he's fatally wounded, but Dick refuses. Before he dies Dick's father asks Boston to protect his son.Flashpoint: Deadman and the Flying Graysons #2 (July 2011) Later, Boston and Dick are running around the countryside looking for reinforcements, when they are soon caught in an explosion. It appears that they both survived the explosion, but when Boston tells Dick he is okay, Dick walks through him towards Boston's dead body behind him. Boston realizes that he is now a ghost whose presence cannot be seen or heard. He helps Dick, keeping him safe from the Amazons. Meeting up with the Resistance, Boston aids Dick who has become the new Doctor Fate and lets him know that he is not alone.Flashpoint: Deadman and the Flying Graysons #3 (August 2011) ===The Batman Adventures=== Deadman was in the comic books based on Batman: The Animated Series and his origin was similar to his mainstream comics appearances with minor changes: he was in the Haly's Circus and Rama Kushna was male. Deadman appears as a \\"Haly's Circus\\" performer in the Batman & Robin Adventures comic in issue #15 and meets Dick Grayson for the first time since taking over for The Flying Graysons. Issue #6 of the follow-up series, Batman: Gotham Adventures, featured his assassination and transformation to the supernatural Deadman. His killer, Hook, appears as well. ===Injustice: Gods Among Us=== Deadman appears in the Injustice: Gods Among Us prequel comic as a vision prophesied by Madame Xanadu in the sixth chapter of Year Three. He is later \\"killed\\" by the new Spectre. Deadman passes on his role as Deadman to the spirit of Dick Grayson, who was accidentally killed by Damian Wayne, before he moves on to the afterlife. ==In other mediaTelevision=== Live action * Following the success of X-Men in 2000, Warner Bros. Television announced that a Deadman television film for TNT was in development, which was also being considered as a pilot for a potential television series. The project was in development until 2003, but was later shelved. * In 2011, WBTV hired Supernatural creator Eric Kripke to helm a Deadman television series for The CW, as the network was looking to commission a new superhero series. The following year, another superhero series debuted on the network. A Deadman series never materialized and Kripke has since moved on to other projects. Animation Deadman as he appeared in the Justice League Unlimited series * Deadman appeared in Justice League Unlimited, voiced by Raphael Sbarge. He appears as the champion of the Goddess Rama Kushna. It is stated that Batman already knew Deadman having helped him solve his own murder and trained under the monk at the temple where Deadman was residing. In the episode \\"Dead Reckoning\\", he resides in a temple in Nanda Parbat that the Legion of Doom invades and robs of a specific artifact. Upon Deadman being enlisted by Rama Kushna to reclaim the artifact, Deadman heads to the Watchtower and possesses Superman to ask for help from the Justice League. This leads to a conflict with the Legion of Doom at Gorilla City where Deadman helps Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman prevent Gorilla Grodd from using the artifact to turn all humans into gorillas, possessing Wonder Woman and Atomic Skull to go after Devil Ray and stop the Legion of Doom. After the conflict ended with some of the Legion of Doom escaping while leaving the defeated members behind, he saw Devil Ray aiming at Wonder Woman. Deadman possessed Batman and shot Devil Ray with a gun, accidentally killing Devil Ray by sending flying into electric wires. For this mistake causing the scales to become unbalanced, Deadman is required by Rama Kushna to continue his duties and is teleported back to the temple. * Deadman appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Michael Rosenbaum. Boston Brand's origin is almost exactly the same, right down to the hook-handed killer called Hook (with the exception that Rama Kushna is not mentioned at all). He does not know how or why he was kept from 'crossing over', which fuels his melancholic self-pity. In the episode \\"Dawn of the Deadman!\\", Deadman finds the spirit of Batman in London, England when Gentleman Ghost buries Batman alive. Still depressed because of his condition, he is convinced by Batman to help stop Gentleman Ghost from raising an army of the undead to destroy London, while Green Arrow and Speedy try to dig out Batman's body. Deadman helps the heroes thwart Gentlemen Ghost, and embraces his destiny as a hero. Also, it's revealed that Batman has been working his case since Brand's demise. In the episode's final scene, Deadman appears where he helps Batman fight the Triad. * Boston Brand is referenced in the Teen Titans Go! animated series. In the episode \\"La Larva de Amor\\", Robin searches Titans Tower for Silkie and looks under Starfire's bed but instead finds Boston's corpse underneath much to Robin's horror. Raven gets asked by an Underworld boatman for 'Deadman's coins' and a tombstone with Brand's name appears in the episode \\"Salty Codgers\\". * Deadman appears in his own segment in DC Nation Shorts, voiced by Matt L. Jones. These three shorts have been produced by Cartoon Network and Chowder creator C.H. Greenblatt. The first short has Deadman possessing various bodies in order to save a falling crow that he has tried to scare. ===Film=== * Guillermo del Toro has taken interest in producing a film of the hero, supposedly from the only source. Variety reported that Nikolaj Arcel was set to direct. * Deadman appears in Justice League Dark, voiced by Nicholas Turturro. * Deadman makes a theatrical appearance in Teen Titans Go! To the Movies. ===Video games=== * Deadman appears as a playable character in Lego DC Super-Villains, as part of the \\"Justice League Dark DLC Character Pack\\", voiced by Steven Blum. ==Collected editions== * The Deadman Collection (342 pages, collecting Strange Adventures (vol.1) #205‚Äì216, Brave and the Bold (vol.1) #79, 86 and 104, Aquaman (vol.1) #50‚Äì52 and Challengers of the Unknown (vol.1) #74) * Deadman: Book One (176 pages, collecting Strange Adventures (vol. 1) #205‚Äì213) * Deadman: Book Two (168 pages, collecting Brave and the Bold (vol.1) #79 and 86, Strange Adventures (vol. 1) #214‚Äì216, Aquaman (vol.1) #50‚Äì52 and Challengers of the Unknown (vol.1) #74) * Deadman: Book Three (176 pages, collecting Phantom Stranger #33, 39‚Äì41, The Brave and the Bold #133, Superman Family #183, World's Finest #223, 227 and DC Super-Stars #18) * Deadman: Book Four (168 pages, collecting DC Special Series #8, Adventure Comics #459‚Äì466 and DC Comics Presents #24) * Deadman: Book Five (176 pages, collecting Deadman #1‚Äì4, Secret Origins #15, Challengers of the Unknown #85‚Äì87) * Deadman: Lost Souls (200 pages, collecting Deadman: Love After Death #1‚Äì2, and Deadman: Exorcism #1‚Äì2) by Mike Baron and Kelley Jones * Deadman by Kelley Jones: The Complete Collection (272 pages, collecting Action Comics Weekly #618‚Äì626, Deadman: Love After Death #1‚Äì2, and Deadman: Exorcism #1‚Äì2) * Batman/Deadman: Death & Glory (92 page graphic novel) * DC Comics Presents: Brightest Day #1 (96 pages, collecting Solo #8, DCU Holiday '09 and Strange Adventures #205) * Deadman Omnibus (944 pages, collects Strange Adventures #205-216, The Brave and the Bold #79, 86, 104, 133; Aquaman #50-52, Challengers of the Unknown #74, 84-87; Justice League of America #94, World‚Äôs Finest Comics #223, 227; The Phantom Stranger vol. 2 #33, 39-41; Superman Family #183, DC Super Stars #18, DC Special Series #8, Adventure Comics #460-466, DC Comics Presents #94, Detective Comics #500, Deadman vol. 1 #1-4, Secret Origins #15, covers from Deadman vol. 2 #1-7) ==Notes== ==References== * Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams, The Deadman Collection, DC Comics, 2001, . * Jack Kirby, Jack Kirby's Fourth World Omnibus Volume Three, DC Comics, 2007, , . ==External links== * Toonopedia: Deadman profile * DCU Guide: Deadman * Comic Book Awards Almanac * Deadman Comics Issue by Issue Category:DC Comics male superheroes Category:DC Comics titles Category:DC Comics fantasy characters Category:Fictional ghosts Category:Fictional characters with spirit possession or body swapping abilities Category:Fictional trapeze artists Category:Comics characters introduced in 1967 Category:1967 comics debuts Category:Undead superheroes Category:Characters created by Carmine Infantino Category:Characters created by Arnold Drake ","title":"Deadman (comics)"},{"id":"522780","text":"David Cay Boyle Johnston (born December 24, 1948)According to the State of California. California Birth Index, 1905-1995. Center for Health Statistics, California Department of Health Services, Sacramento, California. is an American investigative journalist and author, a specialist in economics and tax issues, and winner of the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Beat Reporting. From 2009 to 2016 he was a Distinguished Visiting Lecturer who taught the tax, property, and regulatory law of the ancient world at Syracuse University College of Law and the Whitman School of Management. From July 2011 until September 2012 he was a columnist for Reuters, writing, and producing video commentaries, on worldwide issues of tax, accounting, economics, public finance and business. Johnston is the board president of Investigative Reporters and Editors. He has also written for Al Jazeera English and America in recent years. == Reporting == Johnston covered \\"student radicals, black politics and development\\" at the San Jose Mercury News from 1968 to 1973. Although he \\"earned enough credits for at least one master‚Äôs degree,\\" his formal educational credentials are limited to a \\"night high school diploma\\" as he \\"skipped most general education requirements in favor of upper division and graduate study at seven schools,\\" including San Francisco State University (1972), the University of Chicago (where he studied under a five-month fellowship in 1973) and Michigan State University (1973-1975). At Michigan State, he wrote an internal textbook (A Guide to Public Records) for the university's journalism department. From 1973 to 1976, he was an investigative reporter at the Detroit Free Press in its Lansing bureau. In 1976, he joined the Los Angeles Times, where he remained until 1988. Johnston subsequently worked as a reporter at The Philadelphia Inquirer from 1988 to 1995. He joined The New York Times in February 1995. As a reporter Johnston investigated Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) political spying and other abuses, the hotelier Barron Hilton, misuse of charitable funds at United Way, news manipulation at WJIM-TV in Lansing, Michigan, and Donald Trump's financial dealings. In 1983, Johnston's reporting of newer information regarding a problematic murder investigation helped a man who had been previously tried four times to win an acquittal during his fifth trial, and was judged \\"the best news story of the year by the California-Nevada editors of United Press International.\\" From February 1995 to April 2008, he was the tax reporter with The New York Times. For the next three years, until joining Reuters, he wrote \\"Johnston's Take\\", a column on tax policy for the nonprofit journal Tax Notes and its sister website tax.com, published by Tax Analysts. In 2009 he briefly wrote a column titled \\"By The Numbers\\" for The Nation. Johnston received the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Beat Reporting \\"for his penetrating and enterprising reporting that exposed loopholes and inequities in the U.S. tax code, which was instrumental in bringing about reforms. \\"Johnston described how corporations were paying less in taxes, even as individuals were paying more, with even well-known companies like Colgate-Palmolive, Compaq Computer, and United Parcel Service (UPS) engaging in \\"what the courts called shams.\\" A court found that Merrill Lynch saved AlliedSignal (now Honeywell) $180 million in \\"sham\\" money transfers among foreign companies. However, the IRS is, since 1999, more likely to audit the poor than the rich, Johnston reported.The 2001 Pulitzer Prize Winners: Beat Reporting Works. In 2001 Johnston investigated the claim that estate taxes, which Republicans call \\"death taxes,\\" were so high that farm families were being forced to sell their family farms in order to pay the taxes. This claim was presented to prove the need to eliminate the inheritance tax. Johnston challenged those who made that claim, such as the American Farm Bureau Federation, to cite an example of a farm that was lost because of estate taxes, and they were unable to do so. Economists told Johnston that it was a myth. An IRS analysis of 1999 returns found that almost no working farmers owe estate taxes. Estate taxes are not assessed on the first $1.35 million net worth, and then rise from 43 to 55 percent above $3 million. Additionally, most wealthy people use legal maneuvers to reduce their estate taxes to 25 percent (or even as little as zero) for the largest estates. He was a Pulitzer finalist in 2003 \\"for his stories that displayed exquisite command of complicated U.S. tax laws and of how corporations and individuals twist them to their advantage.\\" He was also a finalist in 2000 \\"for his lucid coverage of problems resulting from the reorganization of the Internal Revenue Service.\\" Johnston speaking at the San Francisco Tax Day March, April 2017 Like columnist Steven Pearlstein, Johnston has won praise for his writing even though he has no degree in economics. Johnston studied economics at the University of Chicago graduate school and six other colleges, earning the equivalent of six years of college credits but no awarded degree, because he took upper level and graduate level courses almost exclusively, and did not remain at any one school long enough. Johnston has been critical of news coverage of the 2008 $700 billion bailout of Wall Street. In a letter to American journalist and blogger Jim Romenesko, Johnston wrote, \\"In covering the proposed $700 billion bailout of Wall Street don't repeat the failed lapdog practices that so damaged our reputations in the rush to war in Iraq and the adoption of the Patriot Act. Don't assume that Congress must act instantly, as so many news stories state as if it was an immutable fact. Don't assume there is a case just because officials say there is.\\" Johnston has been cited favorably by Glenn GreenwaldGlenn Greenwald Salon Radio interview of David Cay Johnston, Salon, October 1, 2008 as well as other bailout critics. On September 26, 2008, Johnston said: \\"If you look around, you'll notice that banks are still making ordinary loans to ordinary businesses. Your mailbox is still full of proposals to sell you credit cards and extend you debt. The Internet still has ads for these very toxic mortgages that are at the heart of this. They're being advertised all over the Internet....And my point is not to argue that there is or is not a crisis, but that journalists need to begin not by questioning around the edges but by going to the core question. Is this the least expensive way to do this? Are there market solutions that might be applied?\\" In 2011, in his debut article for Reuters, Johnson mistook a positive number for a negative one in News Corp's annual report, and as a result, his article said that News Corp had received a large tax refund, when in reality, it had paid taxes. This error led to a retraction of the article. In late-2016 Johnston founded DCReport, an online journal covering the president's administration and Congress. On March 14, 2017, Johnston released a portion of Donald Trump's 2005 Form 1040 tax return which, he states, he received anonymously in the mail. == Works== Johnston is the author of best- selling books on tax and economic policy. Free Lunch: How the Wealthiest Americans Enrich Themselves at Government Expense and Stick You With The Bill, is about hidden subsidies, rigged markets, and corporate socialism. It follows his earlier book Perfectly Legal: The Covert Campaign to Rig Our Tax System to Benefit the Super Rich‚Äîand Cheat Everybody Else, a New York Times bestseller on the U.S. tax system that won the Investigative Reporters and Editors 2003 Book of the Year award. Johnston's first book, the 1992 Temples of Chance: How America Inc. Bought Out Murder Inc. to Win Control of the Casino Business is an account of how the junk-bond kings usurped mob control of the casino industry in the 1980s. The book discusses corruption in the industry and the role of the federal and state governments in that corruption. In 2014 Johnston released Divided: The Perils of Our Growing Inequality. Cay Johnston shows most Americans, in inflation-adjusted terms, are now back to the average income of 1966. Post-recession (from 2009 to 2011) the top one percent of households took in 121 percent of the income gains while the bottom 99 percent saw their incomes fall. In 2016, Johnston released The Making of Donald Trump, a journalistic account of the rise of businessperson-turned-presidential candidate Donald Trump. At the time he wrote the book, Johnston had known Trump for 28 years. The book was on the New York Times bestseller. His latest book, published in 2018, is It's Even Worse Than You Think: What the Trump Administration is Doing to America, an investigative piece that details actions taken by Trump and his appointees at the departmental level, and how these actions affect Americans' rights and civil protections. * Temples of Chance: How America Inc.

It was named for the 1942 Makin raid, an early diversionary raid designed to distract from the Guadalcanal campaign and the Tulagi campaign. Launched in April 1944, and commissioned in May, she served in support of the Philippines campaign, the Invasion of Iwo Jima, and the Battle of Okinawa. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. She was decommissioned in April 1946, and ultimately sold for scrapping in January 1947. ==Design and description== A profile of the design of , which was shared with all Casablanca-class escort carriers. Makin Island was a Casablanca-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , an extreme width of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck, a long flight deck. She was powered with two Uniflow reciprocating steam engines, which provided a force of , driving two shafts, enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of , assuming that she traveled at a constant speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow end, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one on the fore, another on the aft. One /38 caliber dual purpose gun was mounted on the stern, and she was equipped with 16 Bofors 40 mm anti- aircraft (AA) guns in twin mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon 20 mm cannons, which were used in an anti-aircraft capability. By the end of the war, Casablanca- class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20 mm cannons, as a response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Anti-aircraft guns were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. Casablanca-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but she sometimes went over or under this number. For example, during the Philippines campaign, she carried 15 FM-2 fighters, 9 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, and a TBM-3P photo reconnaissance plane, for a total of 25 aircraft. However, during the Invasion of Iwo Jima, she carried 20 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, for a total of 32 aircraft. During the Battle of Okinawa, she carried 16 FM-2 fighters and 11 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, for a total of 27 aircraft. ==Construction== The escort carrier was laid down on 12 January 1944 under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1130, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. She was launched on 5 April 1944; sponsored by Mrs. B. B. Nichol; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 9 May 1944, Commodore William Baynard Whaley Jr. in command, and with a partial crew complement of 60 officers and 560 crewmen. ==Service history== Following commissioning, she underwent outfitting at Astoria, Oregon. On 31 May, she left, bound for Puget Sound, where munitions were loaded, and tests were conducted. On 8 June, she departed, traveling down to Naval Base San Diego, stopping at Naval Air Station Alameda to load more munitions and to refuel. Upon arriving in San Diego, she underwent a brief shakedown cruise, engaging in exercises off of Baja California. On 19 June, she set off on a transport mission, ferrying 78 aircraft and 236 men to Hawaii. After unloading her cargo in Pearl Harbor, she took on 70 aircraft, along with a marine squadron (VMO-155). She then proceeded onwards to Majuro Atoll, where she unloaded her planes. After leaving, she made stops at Kwajalein Atoll and Roi-Namur, where she took on wounded from the ongoing Battle of Saipan. She then returned to Pearl Harbor, where she loaded onboard Air Group 16, which had been recently detached from . After returning her aircraft cargo to San Diego, she sailed to Long Beach Naval Shipyard, where she underwent overhaul. After finishing overhaul, she took on her aircraft contingent (VC-84), and on 16 August, she began exercises along the California coast. Exercises concluded on 5 September, with minor repairs being conducted until 11 September, when she sortied again for more exercises. She was assigned as part of Carrier Division 29, along with , , and . The task group engaged in simulated amphibious landings on San Clemente Island. On 10 October, Rear Admiral Calvin T. Durgin took control over the escort carrier group, making Makin Island as his flagship. On 16 October, her task group finished exercises, and traveled to the Ulithi Atoll, making stops at Pearl Harbor and Enewetak Atoll. On 10 November, the ship got underway for Leyte, stopping at Kossol Roads. There, she protected convoys in transit to supply the ongoing Battle of Leyte. Notably, on 21 November, she opened fire on three Nakajima J1N \\"Irving\\" twin-engined bombers who flew near the carrier, albeit the aircraft did not engage, and escaped. On 23 November, she was relieved by Carrier Division 27, and the task group sailed to Manus for the forthcoming invasion of Luzon. On 27 November, she arrived at Seeadler Harbor, Manus Island, where supplies were loaded and preparations were made. Between 16 December and 20 December, she left port to engage in exercises with Huon Gulf. She left Manus island on 27 December, and she rendezvoused with the invasion force in Surigao Strait, Leyte on 3 January 1945. The fleet assembled for the invasion of Luzon was immense, consisting of 18 escort carriers, 6 battleships, 4 heavy cruisers, and a multitude of destroyers and destroyer escorts. Almost immediately, the massive fleet was continuously harassed by Japanese kamikaze attacks. On the night of 3 January, a Mitsubishi A6M Zero \\"Zeke\\" dove on the escort carriers, plunging into the ocean approximately from the starboard of Makin Island. On the afternoon of 4 January, the task force once again came under kamikaze attacks, which sunk . On the early morning of 5 January, a Japanese plane flew a scant over the carrier. Later that day, her aircraft supplemented a strike force which sunk and heavily damaged . That same day, in the evening, kamikazes damaged , , and . Makin Island arrived unscathed near Luzon on 6 January. For the next 11 days, she remained off of Luzon flying air support for the amphibious operation. Notably, Salamaua was heavily damaged by a kamikaze on 13 January. On 17 January, the escort carriers withdrew, heading back to Ulithi. During the three-week operation, the only fatality onboard Makin Island was a sailor on the flight deck, who died when a 3.5-inch rocket on an Avenger accidentally discharged, launching him off the carrier. A resulting search proved unsuccessful. This was despite the fact 16 of her own aircraft were destroyed through anti-aircraft fire and accidents. Her air group destroyed 10 Japanese aircraft, and her anti-aircraft guns claimed a kamikaze heading towards the task force. A TBF Avenger being launched off of Makin Bay's aircraft catapult. After the Battle of Luzon, the aircraft carriers only had 18 days to prepare for the Invasion of Iwo Jima. On 10 February, she departed Ulithi for Iwo Jima, where she arrived on 16 February 1945. Her escort carrier task group conducted 3,000 sorties over the Iwo Islands until 8 March, conducting aerial reconnaissance, providing close air support, creating a fighter cover, and patrolling against submarines. On 28 February, her fighters were even used to spray down the island with DDT to control a boom in the population of flies on the island. Notably, her fighters intercepted two Japanese troop transports carrying reinforcements to Iwo Jima, which were promptly strafed and sunk. The carrier group yet again came under heavy Japanese kamikaze attacks, but Makin Island was once again unscathed, although was sunk, and heavily damaged. Despite the intense air support, the only casualty onboard Makin Island was a wounded airman. After replenishing at Ulithi, she sailed for Okinawa, again as flagship. On 8 March, she retired to Ulithi in preparations for the Battle of Okinawa. Okinawa Campaign. Arriving at Ulithi on 11 March, the ship was quickly readied, and launched for Okinawa on 21 March. Arriving on 25 March, Makin Island remained on station for 77 days (69 days directly off the coast of Okinawa), flying constant fire support, supply, and reconnaissance missions for the ground forces. The ship's aircraft, from Composite Squadrons 84 and 91 (VC-84 and -91), flew 2,347 combat sorties, recording almost 8,000 hours of flying time. Relieved 1 June, the carrier sailed for Guam, arriving on 5 June. Whilst in availability on Guam, Vice Admiral Ira Earl Hobbs relieved now Rear Admiral Whaley from command. In addition, her aircraft contingent was rotated, with VC-41 being transferred onto the ship. She sailed again 11 July, with Task Group 32.1, into the East China Sea. The task group's goal was to provide air cover for minesweepers operating in the area, to blockade Japanese troops within China from mainland Japan, to provide air cover for a fast cruiser group which was raiding the Chinese coast, and to attack shipping around Shanghai. Upon a sweep of the Chinese coast, in which the task group encountered minimal resistance, and after a brief bombing of Shanghai harbor, she anchored in Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 13 August. There, she received news of the Japanese surrender, and on 9 September proceeded to Wakanoura Wan, in southern Honsh≈´, for occupation duty. Among her missions was providing air cover for the evacuation of Allied prisoners of war. She sailed for San Francisco on 18 October, arriving on 5 November, then voyaged to Shanghai to return troops (including the famous Flying Tigers) to the United States at Seattle on 30 December. Makin Island was decommissioned on 19 April 1946 at Puget Sound, was stricken from the Navy list on 11 July, and sold on 1 January 1947. == See also == ==References== ==SourcesOnline sources=== * * * ===Bibliography=== * * * == External links == * Category:Casablanca-class escort carriers Category:World War II escort aircraft carriers of the United States Category:Ships built in Vancouver, Washington Category:1944 ships ","title":"USS Makin Island (CVE-93)"},{"id":"522804","text":" USS Thetis Bay (CVE-90/CVHA-1/LPH-6) was a of the United States Navy. Though not the last of the class to be built, she was the last Casablanca class hull to be scrapped. Thetis Bay was laid down under Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1127) on 22 December 1943 at Vancouver, Washington, by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company; launched on 16 March 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Rico Botta; and commissioned on 21 April 1944, Captain Donald E.

On 2 June, she moved to San Pedro to load planes and passengers for Pacific bases. The new escort carrier put out to sea on 5 June; called at Pearl Harbor on the 11th; and continued on, via Makin and Majuro, to Kwajalein. There, she embarked the Army's 50th Engineer Battalion which she offloaded at Pearl Harbor on 5 July. Thetis Bay in August 1944 in her original configuration. Two days later, the carrier got underway for Alameda with 41 aircraft that needed repairs. She arrived on 13 July and, after offloading the aircraft, proceeded to Terminal Island for a three-week yard period. Between 11 August and 13 September, the escort carrier delivered spare parts, replacement aircraft, and personnel to Hawaii and the Marshalls. From September 1944 through mid-April 1945, Thetis Bay made five round-trip voyages from California ports to bases in the Pacific ranging from Pearl Harbor to Finschhaven, New Guinea. On 12 June 1945, Thetis Bay arrived at Pearl Harbor from San Diego with a load of aircraft. There, the aircraft were readied for combat within 72 hours; and the ship got underway for Guam. She arrived at Apra Harbor on 25 June and was assigned to Task Group 30.8 for duty as a replenishment carrier. Thetis Bay made her first rendezvous with Task Force 38 on 12 July when she transferred 40 planes to various carriers. She returned to Guam on 22 July and remained there until 24 July to load more aircraft before joining the fast carriers again on the 31st. The ship reloaded at Guam once more and resupplied the task force from 14 August to 8 September when she returned to Apra Harbor en route to the United States. Thetis Bay arrived at Alameda on 7 September 1945 and was assigned to \\"Magic-Carpet\\" duty, returning veterans from overseas bases to the United States. She served in this capacity until January 1946 when she began inactivation. The ship was placed out of commission, in reserve, at Bremerton, Washington, on 7 August 1946. Thetis Bay transporting planes in 1944. ==Recommissioning as CVHA-1== In May 1955, Thetis Bay was towed to the San Francisco Naval Shipyard where she began conversion to the Navy's first assault helicopter aircraft carrier. On 1 July 1955, her designation was changed from CVE-90 to CVHA-1. With that change, she became a complement to the attack transport. Her helicopters supplemented landing craft to give the Navy and Marine Corps the flexibility of a vertical assault capability. She was recommissioned on 20 July 1956, Captain Thomas W. South, II, in command, and completed conversion six weeks later on 1 September. The carrier arrived at her new home port, Long Beach, on 20 September. There, helicopter teams from Marine Corps Test Unit No. 1, Camp Pendleton, demonstrated landing and take-off techniques. Thetis Bay participated in amphibious training exercises off the California coast before deploying to the Far East on 10 July 1957. She returned to Long Beach on 11 December 1957 and resumed local operations. On 28 May 1959, her designation was changed to LPH-6, amphibious assault ship. In August 1959, Thetis Bay was serving with the 7th Fleet when floods in Taiwan left thousands homeless. On the 12th, she was ordered to proceed from Hong Kong to Taiwan and use HMR(L)-261's (USMC) 21 large troop-carrying helicopters to aid the flood victims. By the end of the assistance operation, at noon of the 20th, the ship had delivered a total of 1,600,540 pounds of supplies to the Chinese. In addition, HMR(L)-261's helicopters had lifted 850 passengers to and from various sites in the flooded area. In May 1960, Thetis Bay participated in a practice night assault landing at Camp Pendleton during which her helicopters carried 1,300 troops and 33 tons of cargo to the objective area. This was the first large-scale night landing of ground forces by carrier-based helicopters. Thetis Bay deployed to the western Pacific in the spring of 1961. After the assault ship returned to Long Beach, she was transferred to the Atlantic Fleet. She arrived at Norfolk, her new home port, in early December 1961. During the next three years, the ship operated along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean. The highlight of her service with the Atlantic Fleet came during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 when she proceeded to the quarantine area with her embarked marine landing team and helicopter squadron ready for action. In September 1963 Thetis Bay proceeded to hurricane-stricken Haiti. She anchored off Port- au-Prince and launched Marine helicopters carrying medical aid and food supplies to thousands of victims of Hurricane Flora. Thetis Bay stood out of Norfolk on 5 January 1964 en route to Philadelphia for deactivation and arrived there the next day. She was decommissioned and struck from the Navy List on 1 March 1964. Her hulk was sold in December 1964 to Peck Iron & Metal Co., Inc., Portsmouth, Virginia, for scrap. ==References== Category:Casablanca-class escort carriers Category:World War II escort aircraft carriers of the United States Category:Cold War amphibious assault ships of the United States Category:Ships built in Vancouver, Washington Category:1944 ships ","title":"USS Thetis Bay"},{"id":"522806","text":"After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, evidence began to emerge of failed attempts by the Iraqi government to bring the conflict to a peaceful resolution. A UN weapons inspector in Iraq ==Saddam Hussein's attempts== In December 2002, a representative of the head of Iraqi Intelligence, Gen. Tahir Jalil Habbush al- Tikriti, contacted former CIA counterterrorism head Vincent Cannistraro, stating that Saddam \\"knew there was a campaign to link him to September 11 and prove he had weapons of mass destruction.\\" Cannistraro further added that \\"the Iraqis were prepared to satisfy these concerns. I reported the conversation to senior levels of the state department and I was told to stand aside and they would handle it.\\" Cannistraro stated that the offers made were all \\"killed\\" by the Bush administration because they allowed Saddam Hussein to remain in power - an outcome viewed as unacceptable. Shortly after, Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak's national security advisor, Osama El-Baz, sent a message to the U.S. State Department that the Iraqis wanted to discuss the accusations that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction and ties with al- Qaeda.http://www.mcclatchydc.com/128/story/9987.html Iraq also attempted to reach the US through the Syrian, French, German, and Russian intelligence services. Nothing came of the attempts. ==Imad Hage== In January 2003, Lebanese-American Imad Hage met with Michael Maloof of the DoD's Office of Special Plans. Hage, a resident of Beirut, had been recruited by the department to assist in the War on Terrorism. He reported that Mohammed Nassif, a close aide to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, had expressed frustrations about the difficulties of Syria contacting the United States, and had attempted to use him as an intermediary. Maloof arranged for Hage to meet with Richard Perle, head of the Defense Policy Board. In February 2003, Hage met with the chief of Iraqi intelligence's foreign operations, Hassan al- Obeidi. Obeidi told Hage that Baghdad didn't understand why they were being targeted, and that they had no WMDs; he then made the offer for Washington to send in 2000 FBI agents to ascertain this. He additionally offered oil concessions, but stopped short of having Hussein give up power, instead suggesting that elections could be held in two years. Later, Obeidi suggested that Hage travel to Baghdad for talks; he accepted. Later that month, Hage met with Gen. Habbush in addition to Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. He was offered top priority to US firms in oil and mining rights, UN-supervised elections, US inspections (with up to 5,000 inspectors), to have al-Qaeda agent Abdul Rahman Yasin (in Iraqi custody since 1994) handed over as a sign of good faith, and to give \\"full support for any US plan\\" in the Arab-Israeli peace process. They also wished to meet with high-ranking US officials. On February 19, Hage faxed Maloof his report of the trip. Maloof reports having brought the proposal to Jamie Duran. The Pentagon denies that either Wolfowitz or Rumsfeld, Duran's bosses, were aware of the plan. On February 21, Maloof informed Duran in an email that Perle wished to meet with Hage and the Iraqis if the Pentagon would clear it. Duran responded \\"Mike, working this. Keep this close hold.\\". On March 7, Perle met with Hage in Knightsbridge, and stated that he wanted to pursue the matter further with people in Washington (both have acknowledged the meeting). A few days later, he informed Hage that Washington refused to let him meet with Habbush to discuss the offer (Hage stated that Perle's response was \\"that the consensus in Washington was it was a no-go\\"). Perle told the Times, \\"The message was 'Tell them that we will see them in Baghdad.\\" Throughout March, Hage continued to pass messages from Iraqi officials to Maloof. At one point, Maloof wrote a memo stating \\"Hage quoted Obeidi as saying this is the last window or channel through which this message has gone to the United States. He characterized the tone of Dr. Obeidi as begging.\\" Maloof contacted Perle, stating that Iraqi officials are \\"prepared to meet with you in Beirut, and as soon as possible, concerning 'unconditional terms' \\", and that \\"Such a meeting has Saddam Hussein's clearance.\\" No action was taken. According to an Arab source of the Guardian, Perle sent a Saudi official the following terms for Iraq to fulfill to prevent war: \\"Saddam's abdication and departure, first to a US military base for interrogation and then into supervised exile, a surrender of Iraqi troops, and the admission that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Hage has since become embroiled in a situation involving an earlier incident involving airport security that many have viewed as payback similar to the case of Valerie Plame. == Exile proposal == It has been suggested that Saddam Hussein was prepared to go into exile if allowed to keep $1 billion USD. On February 22, at a meeting in Crawford, Texas, George Bush told Spanish prime minister Jose Maria Aznar: The same month Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his representative, former prime minister Yevgeny Primakov, to Saddam Hussein. Primakov's mission was to convince Saddam to abdicate as Iraqi president, which could prevent US invasion of Iraq. The debates failed, though. \\"Saddam just tapped me on the shoulder and went out of the room\\", Primakov recalled.Yossef Bodansky The Secret History of the Iraq War. Regan Books, 2005, In late October 2005, the son of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan (the late president of the United Arab Emirates) stated that Saddam Hussein had in fact accepted the offer of exile in that country. Under the deal, Saddam and his family would have fled, been granted immunity from prosecution, and elections would have been held in Iraq within six months under UN and Arab League auspices. However, according to him, the Arab League did not bring up the issue at their emergency summit, citing rules preventing interference in the affairs of their member states, thus preventing it from being accepted. Anonymous officials in the UAE have confirmed the report. There was also speculation that Saddam would go into exile in Belarus. After the invasion, there was concern that members of Hussein's regime were trying to flee to that country. ==See also== *Blair's tests for Iraq Disarmament ==References== ==External links== * Saddam's desperate offers to stave off war * As war loomed, Iraq offered deal * US 'rejected Iraqi concessions' * Last-minute Iraq offer cited Category:Iraq War Category:Iraq‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:Middle East peace efforts ","title":"Failed Iraqi peace initiatives"},{"id":"522808","text":"The Prince Edward Island Liberal Party (officially the Prince Edward Island Liberal Association) is a political party in the province of Prince Edward Island, Canada. The PEI Liberals are affiliated with the federal Liberal Party of Canada. ==History== The party was created when PEI was a British colony by reformers who agitated for the system of responsible government. This was granted by the British crown to the colony in 1851. George Coles was its dominant figure in its first decades. While initially supportive of Canadian Confederation, Coles and the Liberals soured on the project, and it was not until 1873 that the island joined Canada as a means of relieving the PEI government's severe debts. The early party supported the abolition of school fees, and a resolution to the \\"Land Question\\" that divided the province. The Liberals supported land reform through the state acquisition of large landed estates. These estates were broken up and turned over to tenants and squatters. The Liberals have been one of only two parties forming government on the island since 1851, the other being the Conservatives. The Liberals have formed government more often, but not in recent times. In practice, there is little to distinguish the two parties from each other: both lean towards the centre of the political spectrum. The Liberals being slightly to the left and the Conservatives (Tories) slightly to the right. Traditionally, the Tories have done better among Protestant voters, while Liberals have had more support from Catholics. Politics on the island, however, has never been sectarian, and both parties have always had voters and members from both populations. Indeed, it has been the custom until recently for a Liberal incumbent of one denomination to be opposed by a Tory challenger of the same denomination and vice versa. This had tended to minimise religious sectarianism within the parties. The Liberals have also traditionally enjoyed the support of the province's small Acadian population concentrated in Prince County at the west end of the island. Conservative support has tended to be greater on the eastern half of the island. In the past forty years the most significant figures in the party have been Alexander B. Campbell and, later, Joe Ghiz. Liberal governments in the 1960s and 1970s under Campbell supported diversification of the province's agricultural economy. Government incentives were provided to attract manufacturing and tourism. Under Ghiz in the 1980s, the Liberals opposed free trade between Canada and the United States, and the federal Tory government's decision to close a military base on the island. The party's enthusiasm for economic intervention in the economy had waned since the Campbell years. Ghiz resigned in 1993 and was succeeded by Catherine Callbeck. Callbeck was the third female premier in Canadian history and, after the 1993 election, the first to lead her party to victory in a general election. After three and a half years, Callbeck resigned and was succeeded by Keith Milligan, under whom the Liberals were defeated in the 1996 election, falling to 8 seats. Wayne Carew was elected leader in 1999, and saw the party's fortunes fall further, winning a single seat in the 2000 election. Robert Ghiz, son of Joe Ghiz, was elected leader in 2003. After more than ten years in opposition, the Liberals returned to government in the 2007 election, and were re-elected in 2011. Ghiz resigned in 2015 and was succeeded as party leader and premier by Wade MacLauchlan, who lead the Liberals to a third victory in 2015.

Romance films or romance movies are romantic love stories recorded in visual media for broadcast in theaters and on TV that focus on passion, emotion, and the affectionate romantic involvement of the main characters and the journey that their love takes them through dating, courtship or marriage. Romance films make the romantic love story or the search for strong and pure love and romance the main plot focus. Occasionally, romance lovers face obstacles such as finances, physical illness, various forms of discrimination, psychological restraints or family that threaten to break their union of love. As in all quite strong, deep, and close romantic relationships, tensions of day-to-day life, temptations (of infidelity), and differences in compatibility enter into the plots of romantic films. Romantic films often explore the essential themes of love at first sight, young with older love, unrequited romantic love, obsessive love, sentimental love, spiritual love, forbidden love/romance, platonic love, sexual and passionate love, sacrificial love, explosive and destructive love, and tragic love. Romantic films serve as great escapes and fantasies for viewers, especially if the two people finally overcome their difficulties, declare their love, and experience life \\"happily ever after\\", implied by a reunion and final kiss. In romantic television series, the development of such romantic relationships may play out over many episodes and/or different characters may become intertwined in different romantic arcs. Screenwriter and scholar Eric R. Williams identifies Romance Films as one of eleven super-genres in his screenwriters‚Äô taxonomy, claiming that all feature length narrative films can be classified by these super-genres. The other ten super-genres are Action, Crime, Fantasy, Horror, Science Fiction, Slice of Life, Sports, Thriller, War and Western. ==Subgenres== Gone With the Wind (1939). === Historical romance === Also known as Epic romance, this is a romantic story with a historical period setting, normally with a turbulent backdrop of war, revolution or tragedy. This includes films such as Titanic, Gone with the Wind, Reds and Doctor Zhivago. === Romantic drama === Romantic dramas usually revolve around an obstacle which prevents deep and true love between two people. Music is often employed to indicate the emotional mood, creating an atmosphere of greater insulation for the couple. The conclusion of a romantic drama typically does not indicate whether a final romantic union between the two main characters will occur. Some examples of romantic drama films are Mouna Ragam, Titanic, The Bridges of Madison County, The English Patient, Sommersby, Casablanca, Coming Home, Jungle Fever, Restless, Memoirs of a Geisha, Last Tango in Paris, Water for Elephants, 5 Centimeters per Second, Love Story, Man's Way with Women, Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, Veer-Zaara and Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. Same-sex romantic dramas, which tackle LGBT issues include Brokeback Mountain and Call Me by Your Name. === Chick flick === Chick flick is a term often associated with romance films as many are targeted to a female audience. Although many romance films may be targeted at women, this is not a defining characteristic of a romance film and a chick flick does not necessarily have a romance as a central theme, revolve around the romantic involvement of characters or even contain a romantic relationship. As such, the terms cannot be used interchangeably. Films of this genre include Dirty Dancing, The Notebook, Dear John, A Walk to Remember, and Romeo + Juliet. === Bromantic comedy === A bromantic comedy is a comedy film genre that takes the formula of the typical ‚Äúromantic comedy‚Äù but focuses on close male friendships. The word ‚Äúbromance‚Äù is a close but non-sexual relationship between two or more men. Notable bromantic comedy films are Shaun of the Dead, Superbad, I Love You, Man, and Step Brothers. Popular and common elements or themes of bromantic comedies include; male bonding, bromance, and conflicts with heterosexuality bonding, with the addition of humour. Aspects of bromantic comedies, including male camaraderie, were first seen in Barry Levinson's 1982 film Diner. === Romantic comedy === Romantic comedies are films with light-hearted, humorous plotlines, centered on romantic ideals such as that true love is able to surmount most obstacles. Humour in such films tends to be of a verbal, low-key variety or situational, as opposed to slapstick. Films within this genre include Four Weddings and a Funeral, Love Actually, Moonstruck, As Good as It Gets, Something's Gotta Give, It Happened One Night, When Harry Met Sally..., Annie Hall, and The Apartment. === Romantic action === Romantic action is a film that blend romance and action. Examples include Killers, Knight and Day, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, This Means War and The Bounty Hunter. === Romantic thriller === Romantic thriller is a genre of film which has a storyline combining elements of the romance film and the thriller genre. Some examples of romantic thriller films are The Adjustment Bureau, The Phantom of the Opera, The Tourist, The Bodyguard, Unfaithful, and Wicker Park. === Gothic romance === Gothic romance is a film genre which includes gothic elements and affirms feminine experiences, perceptions and interpretations of their ‚Äúfear, anger, and distrust of patriarchal order‚Äù. A key feature of gothic romance films is the ‚ÄúBluebeard motif‚Äù. This typically refers to secrets or forbidden rooms or areas in a house, which represent female protagonists‚Äô repressions. This common characteristic is based on a variation of the Bluebeard folktale of a wealthy man who forbids his new wife from entering his castle's underground chamber, to which she finds the corpses of his many former wives. Some examples of gothic romance films include Crimson Peak, Rebecca, Suspicion and Gaslight'. === Romantic fantasy === Romantic fantasies describe fantasy stories using many of the elements and conventions of the romance genre. Some examples include Edward Scissorhands, Cinderella and The Shape of Water. ===Paranormal romance === Paranormal romance is a popular genre of film which features romantic relationships between humans and supernatural creatures. Popular tropes include vampirism, time-travel, ghosts and psychic or telekinetic abilities - i.e. things that cannot be explained by science. The genre originated in literature and moved on to the screen in the early 2000s, following the success of the Twilight Saga adaptations from Stephanie Meyer‚Äôs books. By 2007‚Äì8, film studios were producing various paranormal romance films, many adapted from novels. Examples of paranormal romance films include Warm Bodies, The Twilight Saga, Emerald Green, Vampire Academy and I Am Dragon. ==See also== * List of romance films * AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions * Romantic comedy * Drama film * Interracial romance film * Romance novel * Romance (love) ==References== ==External links== * IMDb guide to Romance movies Category:Film genres Category:Interpersonal relationships ","title":"Romance film"},{"id":"522826","text":"Juan Carlos I of Spain (born 1938) is a former king of Spain.

was a Canadian surveyor, road builder, Indian commissioner and politician born in Devonshire, England. He emigrated to British Columbia in 1859 in order to act as surveyor for the Dewdney Trail that runs through the province. In 1870, Dewdney decided to take up a role in Canadian government. In this year, he was elected to the Legislative Council of British Columbia as a representative form the Kootenay region. In 1872, he was elected as a member of Federal Government for the Yale region representing the Conservative party. He was reelected to this position in 1874 and again in 1878. Dewdney served as Lieutenant Governor of the North- West Territories from 1879 to 1888, and the fifth Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia from 1892 to 1897. Additionally, he served as the Indian commissioner in the North-West Territories from 1879 until 1888. In 1897, Dewdney retired from politics and began working as a financial agent until his death in 1916. Throughout his political career, Dewdney played a role in the settlement of western Canada and defining the relationship between the government of Canada and the Indigenous peoples of the North-West in the nineteenth century. Dewdney experienced several political and humanitarian issues throughout his political appointments. As Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories, Dewdney had to manage with a starvation crisis faced by the Indigenous peoples after years of buffalo decline. Additionally, as Indian Commissioner, Dewdney subsequently tackled issues pertaining to the North-West Rebellion of 1885. ==Early life and career== Edgar Dewdney was born in Bideford, England to parents Charles Dewdney and Fanny Hollingshead. He grew up in a wealthy family, providing him with many social opportunities. Dewdney had two marriages throughout his life, neither producing any children. The first marriage was to Jane Shaw Moir in 1864, and the second in 1909 to Blanche Elizabeth Plantagenet Kemeys-Tynte.E. Brian Titley. ‚ÄúDewdney, Edgar‚Äù in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 14. (University of Toronto/Universit√© Laval: 2003). Dewdney originally wanted to pursue a career in civil engineering, studying the subject at Cardiff University. After his civil engineering training in 1859, he decided to start a life in the Pacific Northwest in hopes of making a fortune with his newly acquired qualifications. In addition, Dewdney was also motivated to move to the North-West Territories after the discovery and further mining of gold in the Fraser Valley. He was active in the development of pack trails in the colony of British Columbia including the Dewdney Trail which became the main trail into the interior of the colony. Dewdney was active in political life in British Columbia throughout the 1860s. Dewdney had a limited understanding of the functions of Canadian politics when his interests first piqued.Titley, Brian. The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 39. After a few years in Provincial politics, Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald requested Dewdney to become the Indian Commissioner in the North-West, as he knew of the ‚ÄúIndians‚Äù in the area quite well. Dewdney had an advantage due to his general knowledge of Indigenous peoples and that he did not originate from Ottawa.Titley, Brian. The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 40. Later in his life, Dewdney held dual titles of Indian Commissioner and Lieutenant- Governor of the North-West Territories.Dempsey, Hugh A. The Amazing Death of Calf Shirt and Other Blackfoot Stories. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 1994. 180. He was also the Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia and after three years retired and became a surveyor.Harvey, R.G. Carving the Western Path, By River, Rail, and Road Through B.C‚Äôs Southern Mountains. Toronto, ON: Heritage House, 1998. 117. Due to his prestigious career in politics, Dewdney was considered suitable to conduct the study and surveying of the Cascades. He discovered three routes, Allison, Coquihalla, and Railroad Passes in his 1902 exhibition. However, he disclosed that he never liked any of these routes due to their engineering difficulties. As a result, Dewdney suggested the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) should be built from Midway to Princeton, then north to Merritt and Spences Bridge, and have Fraser Canyon as the way through the Cascades.Harvey, R.G. Carving the Western Path, By River, Rail, and Road Through B.C‚Äôs Southern Mountains. Toronto, ON: Heritage House, 1998. 134. Dewdney is recognized as a legendary trail builder of colonial days in British Columbia, as this played a large role in the westward expansion of Canada.Harvey, R.G. Carving the Western Path, By River, Rail, and Road Through B.C‚Äôs Southern Mountains. Toronto, ON: Heritage House, 1998. 116. Despite this recognition, he faced issues regarding Canadian expansionism and the effect on Indigenous peoples. ===Surveyor during the gold rushes of the 1860s=== Dewdney was originally employed as a surveyor, and supervised the survey of New Westminster. In 1865, Dewdney was appointed by Governor Frederick Seymour to oversee the construction of a trail to the East Kootenay region of the British Columbia Interior so that coastal merchants might benefit from the burgeoning trade associated with gold mining in that area. This was also done to secure a line of communication within the region to prevent an American takeover of that part of the province. Although used for only a few years, parts of the Dewdney Trail, as it was known, remain to this day and are used for recreational hiking. Provincial Highway 3 largely follows the route of the Dewdney Trail. ==Entry into politics== From 1868 to 1869, Dewdney became active in Colonial politics, representing the electoral district of Kootenay in the Legislative Council of British Columbia. After the Colony joined Canadian Confederation in 1871, he served as a Conservative Member of Parliament for the riding of Yale following his election in 1872. He was appointed a member of Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald's cabinet in 1879, where he served as Indian commissioner for the North-West Territories until 1888. First Government House shortly after construction in 1883.In 1881, Macdonald arranged Dewdney's appointment as Lieutenant Governor of the North- West Territories, then an executive position. Dewdney resigned his seat in the Commons, but remained Indian Commissioner during his term as Lieutenant- Governor, which lasted until 1888. Macdonald, along with being Prime Minister, held the cabinet post Minister of the Interior. Dewdney took orders directly from Macdonald.Indian Claims Commission. Carry the Kettle First Nation Inquiry, Cypress Hills Claim. pp. 31,32 Responsible government had not been granted to the North-West Territories, so Dewdney was the Territories' head of government. Perhaps his most notable decision in office was changing the territorial capital from Battleford to Wascana ‚Äî Cree for \\"Pile of Bones\\" ‚Äî in 1883: a featureless location without water apart from a short spring run-off Wascana Creek, trees or topography. This is where Dewdney had secured a substantial real estate for himself adjacent to the near-future planned Canadian Pacific Railway line. Other townsites were also considered probable territorial capitals, including Fort Qu'Appelle and Qu'Appelle, the latter to the extent of having been designated the cathedral city of the new Diocese of Qu'Appelle by the Church of England in Canada. The matter was a national scandal at the time.Pierre Berton, The Last Spike: The Great Railway 1881-1885 (Toronto: McLelland and Stewart, 1973), 120) Still, the initial major street of Pile of Bones, later renamed Regina by Princess Louise, Marchioness of Lorne, was called Dewdney Avenue. After his term as Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories, Dewdney was again elected to Parliament and served as the member for Assiniboia East (now southeastern Saskatchewan) from 1888 to 1891. During this period he also served as Minister of the Interior and Superintendent of Indian Affairs. In 1892, he was appointed to the non- executive viceregal post of Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia. He served in this post until 1897. He retired from politics in 1900, after unsuccessfully running for Parliament in New Westminster, British Columbia. In 1909, following the death his wife Jane, Dewdney remarried. His newlywed wife was Blanche Kemeys-Tynte, the daughter of Colonel Charles John Kemeys-Tynte of Halswell, Somerset, England. ==Crisis: The starvation of the natives== Upon taking office in May, 1879, Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories Edgar Dewdney came face to face with the plight of the natives in the wake of the disappearing buffalo. The exploitation of buffalo for the fur trade had greatly affected the Indigenous peoples who relied completely on every aspect of the buffalo for food, clothing and resources for housing.McQuillan, D. Aidan. ‚ÄúCreation of Indian Reserves on the Canadian Prairies 1870-1885.‚Äù Geographical Review 70, no. 4 (1980): 383. Indigenous peoples had already starved to death at Qu'Appele, Fort Walsh, Fort Macleod, Battleford, Carlton, Fort Pitt, Fort Saskatchewan, Edmonton, Touchwood Hills, Fort Ellice, Moose Mountain, Fort Calgary, and elsewhere. Dewdney's solution was to locate the native tribes on reserves. There agents would teach them how to farm. He reported conditions at the Blackfoot Crossing in July 1879 as follows: By that autumn, seventeen instructors were established at different reserves along with supplies of tools and seed. They began to teach the natives how to farm. Dewdney was later denounced for not responding to four official requests for food aid during the winter of 1882-83 for \\"over 2000 Indians here almost naked and on the verge of starvation\\".https://elysebruce.wordpress.com/tag/canadian- history/ When finally pressed to send food supplies after the official requests, Dewdney stated it was government policy to use famine to force Indians onto reserves. The Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples was conducted by Dewdney in 1880 regarding the administration of Indian Affairs in the North-West Territories. This communication was written to the Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs in Ottawa and provided insight into conditions in the North-West Territories during the 1880s. This report was controversial because it only provided a colonial viewpoint into the lives of Indigenous peoples. The Indigenous voice was omitted from the report, making the report bias to colonial views. Dewdney outlined in the Royal Commission to Inquire into Changes Affecting the Administration of Justice in the North-West Territories that the ‚Äúscarcity of buffalo in Fort Walsh had not been exaggerated, and numbers of Indians of the Cree, Assiniboine and Blackfeet were awaiting the arrival of Col. MacLeod and myself.‚ÄùCanada. Royal Commission to Inquire Into Changes Affecting the Administration of Justice in the North-West Territories. Report of the Royal Commission to Inquire Into Changes Affecting the Administration of Justice in the North-West Territories. Ottawa: Indian Affairs, 1880. 76. The decline of the buffalo populations created a famine which ‚Äúreduced the Indians to a state of dependence on government relief supplies and even forced the Indians to seek government on their reserves.‚ÄùMcQuillan, D. Aidan. ‚ÄúCreation of Indian Reserves on the Canadian Prairies 1870-1885.‚Äù 384. In order to resolve the starvation crisis, Dewdney proposed relocating all Indigenous peoples in the region onto reserves. Because of the scarcity in buffalo populations, the government had no other choice but to provide Indigenous peoples on reserves with food rations, distributed by the North-West Mounted Police. Due to the high decline in the buffalo population, many Indigenous communities were facing starvation. Changes needed to be made in regards to the government‚Äôs actions in controlling and alleviating the threat of a starvation crisis. Dewdney traveled to parts of the North-West with Col. James Macleod, the Commissioner of the North-West Mounted Police, in response to the threat of a starvation crisis. Before traveling to Blackfoot Crossing, Macleod stated in Fort Walk that the resolution to the buffalo problem and the starvation of the Indigenous peoples was to promote an agricultural lifestyle rather than one based on the reliance on buffalo. After observing the crisis at Blackfoot Crossing, Dewdney stressed that the Indigenous peoples there should work to relieve themselves of starvation that resulted from the disappearance of buffalo.Canada. Royal Commission to Inquire Into Changes Affecting the Administration of Justice in the North-West Territories. Report of the Royal Commission to Inquire Into Changes Affecting the Administration of Justice in the North-West Territories. Ottawa: Indian Affairs, 1880. 79. He proposed stationing instructors on reserves in order to educate the Indigenous peoples on how to sustain an agricultural society, as well as to provide those on reserves with the necessary supplies. The Royal Commission shows that members of the Blackfoot nation were grateful for Dewdney‚Äôs efforts made to ending the crisis. Both members of government in Ottawa and Dewdney believed that the Blackfoot Crossing could be a prosperous agricultural settlement. Upon arriving to Blackfoot, Dewdney hoped to talk about this possible prosperity but before his arrival, he had received news that a number of buffalo had crossed through the settlement and destroyed the crops.Mulvany, Charles P. The History of the North-west rebellion of 1885. Toronto, ON: A. H. Hovey and CO., 1885. 59. In the early 1880s, government officials such as Dewdney withheld rations from Indigenous people as a tool to bring them into submission.Carter, Sarah. Aboriginal People and Colonizers of Western Canada to 1900. Toronto, ON: University of Toronto Press, 1999. 142. From 1881 to 1883, it was recorded that buffalo and buffalo herds were headed towards Fort Walsh. Upon hearing this, Dewdney ordered that the food rations for Fort Walsh be reduced. The Northwest Mounted Police began preparation to abandon their post at the fort, which meant Indigenous peoples could only receive their treaty payments and other assistance if or when they signed the treaty and moved north. Dewdney's refusal to allow the supply of relief to Indigenous communities created a volatile environment.Hogue, Michel. Metis and the Medicine Line: Creating a Border and Dividing a People. North Carolina, USA: University of North Carolina Press. 2015. 155. In October 1882, reports from Augustus Jukes, senior surgeon for the Northwest Mounted Police, regarding the limited food and lack of shelter did not have an effect on Dewdney. As a result, Fort Walsh closed in 1882 which left many Indigenous people starved, unless they signed Treaty One or Treaty Two. Dewdney said that he would recognize any male Cree as a chief if he could get the support of one hundred or more men to accept him as a leader. As a result, many Metis, Cree and Assiniboine separated from their bands in order to receive the promised rations from the government. In 1882, it was reported that Cree and Assiniboine that settled in Cyprus Hill were supplied with minimal food rations. As a result, many Cree and Assiniboine began travelling to Indian Head. However, many died along the journey as a result of starvation. The reserve in Indian Head was called Win- cha-pa-ghen, or Skull Mountainettes, because the mountains were covered with the victims of the starvation crisis who received little aid from the government of Canada. In the spring, many made the journey back to Cyprus Hill, where Augustus Juke reported that many of the Cree and Assiniboine were in a state of starvation and did not have the basic necessities of life. This was the direct result of the Indian Commissioner‚Äôs insistence on letting them starve unless they complied with the government's request for them to sign treaties.Carter, Sarah. Aboriginal People and Colonizers of Western Canada to 1900. Toronto, ON: University of Toronto Press, 1999. 149. Dewdney was quoted saying ‚Äúthe longer they continue to act against the wishes of the Government, the more wretched will they become.‚ÄùCarter, Sarah. Aboriginal People and Colonizers of Western Canada to 1900. Toronto, ON: University of Toronto Press, 1999. 148. In 1884, tensions between Louis Riel and the government were rising. Charles Borrom√©e, the Justice of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories and legal advisor in the North-West Territories, sent a letter to Edgar Dewdney on September 5, 1884 regarding the conditions of Indigenous communities during the North-West Rebellion. Borrom√©e wrote ‚ÄúRiel can harm the country, and that the government must come to the assistance of the Indians or misery and starvation will result.‚Äù Dewdney ultimately ignored this information, allowing the half breed (Metis) to starve.Rouleau Borromee, Charles. Charles Borromee to Edgar Dewdney, September 5, 1884. Held at Glenbow Museum. In 1886, Dewdney described the state‚Äôs initiatives to provide rations to Indigenous communities as a ‚Äúpolicy of reward and punishment,‚Äù implying that only bands deemed as ‚Äúloyal‚Äù would receive rations, livestock, and other farming equipment.Daschuk, James. Clearing the Plains: Disease, Politics of Starvation, and the Loss of Aboriginal Life. Regina, SK: University of Regina Press, 2013. 159 To help promote an agricultural society within Indigenous communities, treaties stipulated that farming supplies would be made available as well as livestock. Dewdney believed that one of the reasons Indigenous people could not become self supporting was due to the treaties failing to provide grist mills for grain farming.McQuillan, D. Aidan. ‚ÄúCreation of Indian Reserves on the Canadian Prairies 1870-1885.‚Äù Geographical Review 70, no. 4 (1980): 391. Dewdney, as Indian Commissioner, noted that there were insufficient resources and supplies despite the terms of the treaties. The government of Canada promoted self sufficiency in agriculture by Indigenous peoples as a way to offset the cost of famine relief from the government. However, the supplies that would help Indigenous peoples on reserves to create an agricultural based community were lacking. The lack of supplies from the government frustrated many.McQuillan, D. Aidan. ‚ÄúCreation of Indian Reserves on the Canadian Prairies 1870-1885.‚Äù Geographical Review 70, no. 4 (1980): 389-390 The starvation crisis would symbolize the defining issue during Edgar Dewdney‚Äôs tenure as Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories. The Crisis regarding the starvation of the natives is still seen as a major political and humanitarian crisis. ==The Northwest Rebellion of 1885== The North-West Rebellion of 1885 was an uprising led by the Metis and other Indigenous peoples of the North-West Territories against the Canadian government. The Metis felt threatened by the continuous buying and selling of land by the Canadian government. There was the question of whether the Metis would receive the land that they were entitled to, while the government continued to give more land to settlers. This, in conjunction with the decline in buffalo in the region and the lack of government relief, resulted in the North-West rebellion. The North-West Rebellion began as a peaceful protest by the Metis against the lack of government relief. The reinforcement of the North-West Mounted Police to the area was seen as a threat to the Metis, and helped to jumpstart violence between the Metis and the government. The violent altercation lasted for five months, with the eventual defeat of the Metis rebels by federal enforcers.Friesen, Gerald. The Canadian Prairies: A History. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1987. 220-227. Edgar Dewdney was the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories during the Riel-led rebellion of 1885. It is clear that there were many issues in the North-West region prior to the outbreak of the Metis rebellion. The North-West Mounted Police Superintendent L.N.F. Crozier acted as an informant for Dewdney in the events leading up to the outbreak of the rebellion. With the information that he had gathered, Dewdney believed that he could maintain peace within the region and that he had control of the situation.Titley, Brian. The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 63. However, he did not have faith in the ability of Indian agents across the region to maintain and control the unrest that was beginning to arise within Indigenous communities. As a result, Dewdney called for the appointment of a second roving inspector in 1885, as he believed that it would be difficult for one man to do the job effectively over a vast amount of territory, as well as the fact that the current roving inspector T.P. Wadsworth was reporting his findings to other officials behind Dewdney‚Äôs back. Since his arrival in the North-West Territories, Dewdney supported the increase of rations for Indigenous communities and believed that it was crucial that the terms outlined in treaties were met in order to maintain peace between the Metis and colonial settlers.Titley, Brian. The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 64. === Land === The issue regarding Metis land claims and entitlement had been a topic of discussion for many years prior to the outbreak of rebellion. Louis Riel‚Äôs return to Canada caught the attention of the Canadian government, which motivated the efforts of communities along the Saskatchewan River to advance political demands. The Federal Government was not willing to negotiate with the Metis on the matter. Metis leader, Louis Riel and the Metis forwarded their demands to Ottawa in 1884. Dewdney, as Lieutenant Governor, stated that the government would investigate the claims of those who did not receive land or script in Manitoba, but made no other promises.Hogue, Michel. Metis and the Medicine Line: Creating a Border and Dividing a People. North Carolina, USA: University of North Carolina Press. 2015. 174. Riel wanted ‚Äúland titles and government by the people‚Äù instead of Dewdney holding absolute power in the region.Titley, Brian. The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 66. The issue had been brought up to Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald many times, but had always been pushed aside to prioritize other issues occurring within the dominion. Many settlers in the region were becoming anxious and feared the outbreak of a rebellion, so in February 1885, Dewdney urged the Prime Minister to respond to their demands from the Metis. This request was once again ignored. Later that month, officials in Saskatchewan began sending reports to Dewdney regarding Metis military action that had begun in the area. It had been reported that the Metis had obtained weapons and ammunition from colonial traders, which was considered illegal. This was alarming for Dewdney, who believed that action needed to be taken to control the Metis and suppress tensions. As a result, Dewdney prepared to send police to the area if conditions worsened.Titley, Brian. The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 65. When Riel and his followers began to take prisoners and recruit support from individuals on nearby reserves, Dewdney allowed one hundred Mounted Police to intervene. Dewdney was devoted to preventing other Indigenous peoples on reserves from joining Riel in the North-West Rebellion as an attempt to keep settlers in the area at ease. Land was prioritized by Riel and the Metis in order to secure their future prosperity and survival in the area. Their demands were not recognized by the government of Canada and prompted some Metis communities to prepare for military action. === Food and Rations === Land and food were important tools used by the government of Canada to control Indigenous peoples. Therefore, land and food were key motivators in the resistance. Prior to the outbreak of the rebellion, Dewdney was unwilling to provide large amounts of rations to Metis settlements unless they were in extreme desperation. This mindset changed during the rebellion, as Dewdney‚Äôs idea was to ‚Äútempt‚Äù Metis and other Indigenous peoples to remain on their reserve and remain devoted to the dominion by offering them more rations and goods.Titley, Brian. The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 67. When violence broke out between Riel and the government, Dewdney conducted a tour of reserves in the area, listening to the specific needs of the individuals living on the reserves in an attempt to keep them content. Dewdney offered them more rations of tobacco, bacon, flour, and tea. This was done to keep the Indigenous people on the reserve loyal to the state and separated from the rebellious Metis. Dewdney maintained this appeasement strategy throughout the rebellion. He emphasized the need to be loyal to the state throughout the rebellion. Dewdney suggested that rations and other goods should be withheld from ‚Äúrebel Indians‚Äù after the North-West Rebellion had ended, until it was decided how justice could be achieved.Titley, Brian. The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 74. Dewdney believed that those who had been loyal to the state should be rewarded after the North-West Rebellion had ended. These individuals were awarded through the distribution of money and livestock.Titley, Brian. The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 76. The North-West Rebellion can be linked to the starvation crisis, which is represented in the Frog Lake Massacre. The Frog Lake Massacre on April 2, 1885 was due to the restlessness of the Native people in the area of Frog Lake due to the lack of food and resources.Mulvany, Charles P. The History of the North-west rebellion of 1885. Toronto, ON: A. H. Hovey and CO., 1885. 89. Theresa Delaney, a settler who was held captive whose husband was shot in Frog Lake believed that Edgar Dewdney should be blamed as a cause for the massacre in that while visiting Frog Lake, Dewdney made many promises in regards to food and aid, but none of the promises were fulfilled.Delany, Theresa, and Theresa Gowanlock. Two Months in the Camp of Big Bear. Regina, SK: Canadian Plains Research Centre, University of Regina, 1999. xxx. Although the massacre cannot be directly linked to Dewdney‚Äôs unfulfilled promises to the Indigenous peoples of Frog Lake, it is clear that the lack of government intervention at a time of crisis worsened the conditions. Due to the lack of resources, aid, and food provided to those in the region, it is clear that the residents of Frog Lake were living in unjust circumstances. Additionally, Dewdney acted as a mediator between the government and the Indigenous peoples of Frog Lake. === Result of the Rebellion === The North-West Rebellion eventually ended on June 3, 1885 with subsequent consequences and as well as solutions to ensure there would be no repetition of violence. After the North-West Rebellion had ended, Dewdney took actions to improve the level of security on reserves. This was done to prevent another rebellion of the same nature from occurring in the region.Titley, Brian. The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 78. Dewdney believed that all of those who were involved in the North-West Rebellion should be sentenced accordingly. He supported heavy jail sentences for the perpetrators and believed that many executions needed to be carried out in order to make a statement, including the execution of Louis Riel.Titley, Brian. The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 77. Dewdney believed that the future of Indigenous communities lay in the younger generation. He feared Indigenous children and the power that they held. This was one of the arguments that justified his support the closing of day schools and the creation of Indian residential schools in order to fully transform Indigenous children into model citizens. He believed that children needed to be removed from the influence of their Indigenous parents and communities. This needed to be done in order to maintain control and ensure that another rebellion of similar nature did not occur.Titley, Brian. The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 78. The failure of the North-West Rebellion caused the government of Canada to impose other regulations on the lives of individuals, such as Indian residential schools. The intended purpose of Indian residential schools were to isolate Indigenous children from the influences of their family in order to effectively assimilate them into Euro- Canadian society. These schools operated within Canada until 1996. They were opened and funded by the Canadian government and were operated by the Catholic church. At these schools, Indigenous children faced extreme physical, emotional, and sexual abuse as an assimilation tactic. The traumatization that Indigenous children faced at these schools has been passed down through generations and continues to have an extremely negative effect on Indigenous communities in the twenty-first century. ==Honours== Dewdney had the prenominal \\"the Honourable\\" and the postnominal \\"PC\\" for life by virtue of being made a member of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada on September 25, 1888.http://www.pco- bcp.gc.ca/default.asp?Language=E&Page;=informationresources‚ãê=PrivyCouncilMembers&doc;=PCMembersHistList- A-E_e.htm == Indigenous Relations == Settler expansion westward further strained Indigenous and Crown relations. Metis and Indigenous peoples were affected by the increase in westward expansion and the methods of land settlement imposed by the government in Qu‚ÄôAppelle and Saskatchewan. The Metis distrusted Dewdney due to his control over the land in question for settlement. New settlers arriving in the region began to push Metis out of Manitoba.Mulvany, Charles P. The History of the North-west rebellion of 1885. Toronto, ON: A. H. Hovey and CO., 1885. 23. The uncertainty regarding the fate of the Metis in Manitoba in regards to settler migration became a reality. Surveying of Metis land for the new settlers created new tensions, which Dewdney failed to acknowledge.Janigan, Mary. Let the Eastern Bastards Freeze in the Dark: The West Versus the Rest Since Confederation. Toronto, ON: Alfred A. Knopf Canada 2012. 75. There are some instances of Dewdney mediating territorial disputes as Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs, and while travelling the areas affected by the starvation crisis in 1879. He noted in the Royal Commission that the Sacree nation was in dispute with the Blackfeet over flour rations. The Sacree were forced to travel to Fort MacLeod in order to avoid further trauma caused by starvation, but voiced concern over the area also being inhabited by the Blackfeet. Dewdney ended the dispute and the Sacree agreed to move to Fort MacLeod.Canada. Royal Commission to Inquire Into Changes Affecting the Administration of Justice in the North-West Territories. Report of the Royal Commission to Inquire Into Changes Affecting the Administration of Justice in the North-West Territories. Ottawa: Indian Affairs, 1880. 80-81. Dewdney was involved in mediating the territorial disputes between the Metis and settlers when tensions were heightened. The early 1880s saw raids led by Indigenous bands to steal cattle and horses from ranchers. This is directly linked to the loss of buffalo in the area and the subsequent starvation crisis. These raids occurred across into the United States and created American tensions. As a Result, Dewdney created a permit system in 1882 so that groups such as the Blackfeet and Assiniboine could move across the border to hunt, visit relatives, and for leisure.Hogue, Michel. ‚ÄúDisputing the Medicine Line: The Plains Crees and the Canadian-American Border, 1876- 1885.‚Äù Montana: The Magazine of Western History 52, no. 4 (2002). 11-12. Dewdney supported and defended the allegations against Canadian Indigenous peoples as being held responsible for the depredations in Northern Montana.Hogue, Michel. ‚ÄúDisputing the Medicine Line: The Plains Crees and the Canadian-American Border, 1876- 1885.‚Äù Montana: The Magazine of Western History 52, no. 4 (2002). 11. Rancher anxieties and prompts from Americans due to raids by Indigenous peoples pushed Dewdney to move Indigenous bands ‚Äúfrom the southern prairies of Assiniboia to reserves north of the Canadian Pacific Railroad.‚Äù This plan disrupted bands searching and following remaining buffalo across the international boundary. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police were instructed to use force when faced with bands attempting to move north.McQuillan, D. Aidan. ‚ÄúCreation of Indian Reserves on the Canadian Prairies 1870-1885.‚Äù 385. Dewdney triumphantly claimed that there were no more natives north of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) line. As a result, the development of the CPR could continue further west by the instruction of Dewdney. Concerning governance, Dewdney advocated for the enforcement of the Indian Act to dispose Indian chiefs. This would help the colonial government maintain power in local communities by removing Indigenous leadership and eradicating self-governance. As a result of this enforcement, arrests were made against those who were viewed as ‚Äòbad Indians.‚ÄôMonaghan, Jeffrey. ‚ÄúSettler Governmentality and Racializing Surveillance in Canada's North-West.‚Äù The Canadian Journal of Sociology 38, no. 4 (2013). 502. The use of language such as ‚Äòbad Indians‚Äô left for interpretation that any Metis or Indigenous person that rejected government policy was atrocious. Additionally, Dewdney mediated territorial disputes as Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs while traveling areas affected by colonial expansion as well as food and land disputes. == Criticism == Dewdney has been criticized for using the courts as an extension of administering his own concept of justice (Gavigan, p. 38). He reportedly withheld rations from the Cree until he realized that it created more violence among them (Gavigan, p. 36). Dewdney was known for making many promises to the Indigenous peoples which raised their morale, but ultimately leaving these promises unfulfilled.Delany, Theresa, and Theresa Gowanlock. Two Months in the Camp of Big Bear. Regina, SK: Canadian Plains Research Centre, University of Regina, 1999. 30. At the time of the North-West Rebellion, Dewdney was Indian Commissioner as well as Lieutenant Governor of the North- West Territories. This gave him a great deal of power and influence in the area and created criticism towards him, as many believe that he was able to abuse this power to ultimately achieve his goals.Titley, Brian. The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 80. Dewdney was criticized for not responding to requests for food relief made to the government by Metis, Assiniboine and Cree in the winter of 1882 to 1883. The lack of a response from Dewdney in regard to official requests for food supplies to Indigenous communities can be seen as a tactic used in order to push Indigenous peoples onto reserves. Additionally, there was concern that the Department of Indian Affairs, its agents, and Dewdney had secretly been in contact with Montana grocery and mercantile firm I.G. Baker Company. The worry was that the Department had purchased subpar goods to distribute to the Metis who were affected by the starvation crisis. It was claimed by the Hudson's Bay Company That Dewdney and other key officials in the North-West and Ottawa were linked with the company and therefore profiting off of the starvation crisis.Daschuk, James. Clearing the Plains: Disease, Politics of Starvation, and the Loss of Aboriginal Life. Regina, SK: University of Regina Press, 2013. 137-138. Dewdney's relationship with the Baker Co. relates back to before his appointment as Indian Commissioner. Dewdney was known to involve himself in various business ventures and investments in the North-West that resulted in his personal financial gain.Daschuk, James. Clearing the Plains: Disease, Politics of Starvation, and the Loss of Aboriginal Life. Regina, SK: University of Regina Press, 2013. 138. Flour supplied to Indigenous communities by the Baker Company was unfit for consumption and caused deaths in several reserves. Additionally, there was the belief that the food had been tampered with which created a formal independent investigation into the Baker Company‚Äôs flour supply.Daschuk, James. Clearing the Plains: Disease, Politics of Starvation, and the Loss of Aboriginal Life. Regina, SK: University of Regina Press, 2013. 139. It was determined that the flour was indeed substandard, which reflected negatively on Dewdney given his relationship with the Company. Furthermore, there are also reports that Dewdney and other agents from the Department of Indian Affairs used food as a tool for coercion. Many Indigenous people on reserves were at the mercy of these agents. == Life After the Rebellion == It is important to note that Dewdney never truly liked living in the North-West Territories, as he saw the land as bleak and lifeless. He also disliked the harsh climate of the North-West Territories, as it could become intolerable at times. Dewdney suffered from extreme back pain, preventing him from traveling on horseback and camping between reserves. Dewdney‚Äôs wife Jane also expressed a longing to return to life in British Columbia, as it was filled with excitement and adventure.Titley, Brian. The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 91. After the North-West Rebellion, Dewdney requested political appointments outside of the North-West. On September 12, 1888, he was named Minister of the Interior as well as superintendent general of Indian Affairs.E. Brian Titley. ‚ÄúDewdney, Edgar‚Äù in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 14. (University of Toronto/Universit√© Laval: 2003). Dewdney was appointed as Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia on November 2, 1892 and retired December 1, 1897. After his retirement from politics, Dewdney focused on business ventures. Throughout his life, Dewdney managed his personal finances poorly, resulting in his lack of pension to support him in his later life. Subsequently, he also focused on surveying projects for proposed railways in British Columbia. His wife Jane died in January 1909, which prompted his second marriage to Blanche Elizabeth Plantagenet Kemeys-Tynte in 1909. Money continued to be an issue for Dewdney up until his death. He attempted to receive a senate appointment as well as an appeal to receive a pension to aid him in his old age. He never received a senate appointment or a pension. Edgar Dewdney died on August 8, 1916 in Victoria, British Columbia at the age of eighty. ==Legacy== *A major east-west street in Regina, Dewdney Avenue, is named after him; Government House, the original Territorial government building and the local detachment of the RCMP (formerly its headquarters before these were transferred to Ottawa) and national training centre are on Dewdney Avenue. *Dewdney, British Columbia is the name of a locality immediately east of Mission, British Columbia, located below the 920 m Dewdney Peak on the north shore of the Fraser River. The community was the namesake of the former Dewdney provincial electoral district and also of the now-dismantled Dewdney-Alouette Regional District *The Dewdney Trunk Road was one of the earliest main roads in the Lower Fraser Valley of British Columbia, running from Port Moody to the community of Dewdney.

Symptoms are meningitis-like and include headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, a stiff neck, confusion, hallucinations and seizures. Symptoms progress rapidly over around five days, and death usually results within one to two weeks of symptoms. N. fowleri is typically found in warm bodies of fresh water, such as ponds, lakes, rivers and hot springs. It is also found in an amoeboid or temporary flagellate stage in soil, poorly maintained municipal water supplies, water heaters, near warm-water discharges of industrial plants and in poorly chlorinated or unchlorinated swimming pools. There is no evidence of it living in salt water. As the disease is rare, it is often not considered during diagnosis. Although infection occurs very rarely, it almost inevitably results in death.one death in September 2018 was the first confirmed case of the infection in the United States since 2016 (nytimes.com: A Man Died After Being Infected With a Brain-Eating Amoeba. Here Are the Facts) Of the 450 or so naegleriasis cases in the past 60 years, only seven have survived, implying a case fatality rate of 98.5%. ==Signs and symptoms== Onset of symptoms begins one to nine days following exposure (with an average of five). Initial symptoms include changes in taste and smell, headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, back pain, and a stiff neck. Secondary symptoms are also meningitis-like including confusion, hallucinations, lack of attention, ataxia, cramp and seizures. After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly over three to seven days, with death usually occurring anywhere from seven to fourteen days later, although it can take longer. In 2013, a man in Taiwan died 25 days after being infected by Naegleria fowleri. It affects healthy children or young adults who have recently been exposed to bodies of fresh water. Some people have presented with a clinical triad of edematous brain lesions, immune suppression and fever.. Scientists speculate that lower age groups are at a higher risk of contracting the disease because adolescents have a more underdeveloped and porous cribriform plate, an organ which the amoeba travels through to reach the brain . ==Cause== Naegleria fowleri's human eye-like structure N. fowleri invades the central nervous system via the nose, specifically through the olfactory mucosa of the nasal tissues. This usually occurs as the result of the introduction of water that has been contaminated with N. fowleri into the nose during activities such as swimming, bathing or nasal irrigation. The amoeba follows the olfactory nerve fibers through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone into the skull. There, it migrates to the olfactory bulbs and subsequently other regions of the brain, where it feeds on the nerve tissue. The organism then begins to consume cells of the brain, piecemeal, by means of an amoebostome, a unique actin-rich sucking apparatus extended from its cell surface. It then becomes pathogenic, causing primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM or PAME). Primary amebic meningoencephalitis presents symptoms similar to those of bacterial and viral meningitis. Upon abrupt disease onset, a plethora of problems arise. Endogenous cytokines, which release in response to pathogens, affect the hypothalamus‚Äô thermoregulatory neurons and cause a rise in body temperature. Additionally, cytokines may act on the vascular organ of the lamina terminalis, leading to the synthesis of prostaglandin (PG) E2 which acts on the hypothalamus, resulting in an increase in body temperature. Also, the release of cytokines and exogenous exotoxins coupled with an increase in intracranial pressure stimulate nociceptors in the meninges creating pain sensations. The release of cytotoxic molecules in the central nervous system results in extensive tissue damage and necrosis, such as damage to the olfactory nerve through lysis of nerve cells and demyelination.. Specifically, the olfactory nerve and bulbs become necrotic and hemorrhagic. Spinal flexion leads to nuchal rigidity, or stiff neck, due to the stretching of the inflamed meninges. The increase in intracranial pressure stimulates the area postrema to create nausea sensations which may lead to brain herniation and damage to the reticular formation. Ultimately, the increase in cerebrospinal fluid from inflammation of the meninges increases intracranial pressure and leads to the destruction of the central nervous system. Although it is unknown of the exact pathophysiology behind the seizures caused by PAM, scientists speculate the seizures arise from altered meningeal permeability caused by increased intracranial pressure. ==Pathogenesis== Roman Baths in Bath, Somerset, closed for bathing since 1978 due to presence of N. fowleri Naegleria fowleri propagates in warm, stagnant bodies of freshwater (typically during the summer months), and enters the central nervous system after insufflation of infected water by attaching itself to the olfactory nerve. It then migrates through the cribriform plate and into the olfactory bulbs of the forebrain, where it multiplies itself greatly by feeding on nerve tissue. ==Diagnosis== N. fowleri can be grown in several kinds of liquid axenic media or on non-nutrient agar plates coated with bacteria. Escherichia coli can be used to overlay the non-nutrient agar plate and a drop of cerebrospinal fluid sediment is added to it. Plates are then incubated at 37 ¬∞C and checked daily for clearing of the agar in thin tracks, which indicate the trophozoites have fed on the bacteria. Detection in water is performed by centrifuging a water sample with E. coli added, then applying the pellet to a non-nutrient agar plate. After several days, the plate is microscopically inspected and Naegleria cysts are identified by their morphology. Final confirmation of the species' identity can be performed by various molecular or biochemical methods. Confirmation of Naegleria presence can be done by a so-called flagellation test, where the organism is exposed to a hypotonic environment (distilled water). Naegleria, in contrast to other amoebae, differentiates within two hours into the flagellate state. Pathogenicity can be further confirmed by exposure to high temperature (42 ¬∞C): Naegleria fowleri is able to grow at this temperature, but the nonpathogenic Naegleria gruberi is not. ==Prevention== Michael Beach, a recreational waterborne illness specialist for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, stated in remarks to the Associated Press that wearing of nose-clips to prevent insufflation of contaminated water would be effective protection against contracting PAM, noting that \\"You'd have to have water going way up in your nose to begin with\\".\\"6 die from brain-eating amoeba in lakes\\", Chris Kahn/Associated Press, 9/28/07 Advice stated in the press release from Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control recommended people prevent fresh water from entering the nostrils and avoid putting their heads down into fresh water or stirring mud in the water with feet. When starting to suffer from fever, headache, nausea, or vomiting subsequent to any kind of exposure to fresh water, even in the belief that no fresh water has traveled through the nostrils, people with such conditions should be carried to hospital quickly and make sure doctors are well-informed about the history of exposure to fresh water. ==Treatment== On the basis of the laboratory evidence and case reports, heroic doses of amphotericin B have been the traditional mainstay of PAM treatment since the first reported survivor in the United States in 1982. Treatment has often also used combination therapy with multiple other antimicrobials in addition to amphotericin, such as fluconazole, miconazole, rifampicin and azithromycin. They have shown limited success only when administered early in the course of an infection. Fluconazole is commonly used as it has been shown to have synergistic effects against naegleria when used with amphotericin in-vitro. While the use of rifampicin has been common, including in all four North American cases of survival, its continued use has been questioned. It only has variable activity in-vitro and it has strong effects on the therapeutic levels of other antimicrobials used by inducing cytochrome p450 pathways. In 2013, two successfully treated cases in the United States utilized the medication miltefosine. As of 2015, there was no data on how well miltefosine is able to reach the central nervous system. As of 2015 the U.S. CDC offered miltefosine to doctors for the treatment of free- living ameobas including naegleria. In one of the cases, a 12-year-old female, was given miltefosine and targeted temperature management to manage cerebral edema that is secondary to the infection. She survived with no neurological damage. The targeted temperature management commingled with early diagnosis and the miltefosine medication has been attributed with her survival. On the other hand, the other survivor, an 8-year-old male, was diagnosed several days after symptoms appeared and was not treated with targeted temperature management; however, he was administered the miltefosine. He suffered what is likely permanent neurological damage. In 2016, a 16-year-old boy also survived PAM. He was treated with the same protocols of the 12-year-old girl in 2013. He recovered making a near complete neurological recovery; however, he has stated that learning has been more difficult for him since contracting the disease. In 2018, a 10-year-old girl in the Spanish city of Toledo became the first person to have PAM in Spain, and was successfully treated using intravenous and intrathecal amphotericin B. ==Prognosis== Since its first description in the 1960s, only seven people worldwide had been reported to have survived PAM by 2015, out of 450 cases diagnosed, implying a fatality rate of about 98.5%. The survivors include four in the United States, one in Mexico and one in Spain. One of the US survivors had brain damage that is probably permanent, but there are two documented surviving cases in the United States who made a full recovery with no neurological damage; they were both treated with the same protocols. ==Epidemiology== The disease is rare and highly lethal: there have only been 300 cases as of 2008. Drug treatment research at Aga Khan University in Pakistan has shown that in-vitro drug susceptibility tests with some FDA approved drugs used for non-infectious diseases (digoxin and procyclidine were shown to be most effective of the drugs studied) have proved to kill Naegleria fowleri with an amoebicidal rate greater than 95%. The same source has also proposed a device for drug delivery via the transcranial route to the brain. In the US, the most common states with cases reported of PAM from N. fowleri are the southern states, with Texas and Florida having the highest prevalence. The most commonly affected age group is 5‚Äì14 year olds (those who play in water).‚ÄúNumber of Case-Reports of Primary Amebic Meningoencephalitis Caused by Naegleria Fowleri (N=133) by State of Exposure*‚Äî United States, 1962‚Äì2014.‚Äù CDC.gov, CDC, www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/pdf/naegleria-state-map-2014.pdf. The number of cases of infection could increase due to climate change, and was posited as the reason for three cases in Minnesota in 2010, 2012, and 2015. As of 2013, numbers of reported cases were expected to increase, simply because of better- informed diagnoses being made both in ongoing cases and in autopsy findings. ==History== This form of nervous system infection by amoeba was first documented in Australia in 1965. In 1966, four cases were reported in the US. By 1968 the causative organism, previously thought to be a species of Acanthamoeba or Hartmannella, was identified as Naegleria. This same year, occurrence of sixteen cases over a period of three years (1962‚Äì1965) was reported in √öst√≠ nad Labem, Czechoslovakia. In 1970, the species of amoeba was named N. fowleri. Australian physicians Fowler and Carter first described human disease caused by amebo-flagellates in Adelaide in 1965. Their work on amebo-flagellates has provided an example of how a protozoan can effectively live both freely in the environment, and in a human host. Since 1965, more than 144 cases have been confirmed in different countries. In 1966, Fowler termed the infection resulting from N. fowleri primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) to distinguish this central nervous system (CNS) invasion from other secondary invasions made by other amoebae such as Entamoeba histolytica. A retrospective study determined the first documented case of PAM possibly occurred in Britain in 1909. The species Naegleria fowleri was named for Mathieu Naegler (1867‚Äì1934), a French parasitologist and zoologist who discovered it for the first time in 1899, and Malcolm Fowler (1924‚Äì1974), the Australian doctor who described the distinct disease process of the pathogen in Australia in 1965. == Society and culture == Naegleria fowleri is also known as the \\"brain-eating amoeba\\". The term has also been applied to Balamuthia mandrillaris, causing some confusion between the two; Balamuthia mandrillaris is unrelated to Naegleria fowleri, and causes a different disease called granulomatous amoebic encephalitis. Unlike naegleriasis, which is usually seen in people with normal immune function, granulomatous amoebic encephalitis is usually seen in people with poor immune function, such as those with HIV/AIDS or leukemia. Naegleriasis was the topic of Episodes 20‚Äì21, Season 2 in the medical mystery drama House, M.D. == Research == The U.S. National Institutes of Health budgeted $800,000 for research on the disease in 2016.Phenothiazines have been tested in vitro and in animal models of PAM.Improving case detection through increased awareness, reporting, and information about cases might enable earlier detection of infections, provide insight into the human or environmental determinants of infection, and allow improved assessment of treatment effectiveness. == See also == * Balamuthia mandrillaris ‚Äì unrelated pathogenic organism that shares the same common name as N. fowleri == References == == External links == * Naegleria Infection Information Page from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention * Naegleria General Information from the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Category:Parasitic excavates Category:Percolozoa Category:Waterborne diseases Category:Rare infectious diseases ","title":"Naegleriasis"},{"id":"522836","text":"Elisabeth F√©lix, better known only as Mademoiselle Rachel (21 February 1821 ‚Äì 3 January 1858), was a French actress. She became a prominent figure in French society, and was the mistress of, among others, Napoleon III, Napol√©on Joseph Charles Paul Bonaparte and Alexandre Colonna-Walewski, the illegitimate son of Napoleon I. Efforts by newspapers to publish pictures of her on her deathbed led to the introduction of privacy rights into French law. ==Biography== Rachel F√©lix was born as Elisabeth F√©lix on 28 February 1821, in Mumpf, Rheinfelden, Aargau, to a family of Jewish background. Her father, Jacob F√©lix, was a peddler and her mother, Esther Hayer, was a Bohemian dealer in second-hand clothes. She had four sisters (Sarah, Rebecca, Dinah, and Leah) and one brother, Raphael. As a child, F√©lix earned money singing and reciting in the streets. She arrived in Paris in 1830 intending to become an actress. She took elocution and singing lessons, eventually studying under the instruction of the musician Alexandre-√âtienne Choron and Saint-Aulaire. She took dramatic arts classes and debuted in La Vend√©enne in January 1837, at the Th√©√¢tre du Gymnase. Delestre-Poirson, the director, gave her the stage name Rachel, which she chose to retain in her private life as well. Rachel was described as a very serious and committed student. She was admired for her intelligence, work ethic, diction, and ability to act. Auditioning in March 1838, she starred in Pierre Corneille's Horace at the Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais at the age of 17. During this time she began a liaison with Louis V√©ron, the former director of the Paris Opera, which became the subject of much gossip.Agate, James, Rachel. Gerald Howe, London; Viking Press, NY; 1928. During this time, from 1838‚Äì42, she lived in a third-floor apartment in Paris's Galerie V√©ro- Dodat. Her fame spread throughout Europe after success in London in 1841, and she was often associated with the works of Racine, Voltaire, and Corneille. She toured Brussels, Berlin, and St. Petersburg. Although French classical tragedy was no longer popular at the time Rachel entered the stage of Com√©die- Fran√ßaise, she remained true to her classical roots, arousing audiences with a craving for the tragic style of writers like Corneille, Racine and Moli√®re. She created the title role in Eug√®ne Scribe's Adrienne Lecouvreur. Her acting style was characterized by clear diction and economy of gesture; she evoked a high demand for classical tragedy to remain on the stage. This represented a major change from the exaggerated style of those days, as society was beginning to demand the highly emotional, realistic, instinctual acting styles of the Romantics. F√©lix completely rejected the Romantic Drama movement happening in nineteenth-century France. She was best known for her portrayal of the title role in Ph√®dre. Portrait by Joseph Kriehuber ==Death== F√©lix's health declined after a long tour of Russia. She died early in 1858, aged 36, from tuberculosis in Le Cannet, Alpes-Maritimes, France. ==Legacy== Upon her deathbed, she wrote many farewell letters to her sons, family members, lovers, colleagues and theatre connections at Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. She is buried in a mausoleum in the Jewish part of P√®re Lachaise Cemetery and :fr:Avenue Rachel in Paris was named after her.M-P. Hamache et C.

Fenech, 2014, The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies is the community kitchen of a gurdwara, which serves meals free of charge to all visitors‚Äîwithout making a distinction of religion, caste, gender, economic status or ethnicity. The meals are always vegetarian.William Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi (1995), The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, , page 148 The exception to vegetarian langar is when Nihang Sikhs serve meat in some Gurdwaras, on the occasion of Holla Mohalla, and call it Mahaprasad.\\"The most special occasion of the Chhauni is the festival of Diwali which is celebrated for ten days. This is the only Sikh shrine at Amritsar where Maha Prasad (meat) is served on special occasions in a Langar.\\" The Sikh review, Volume 35, Issue 409 - Volume 36, Issue 420, Sikh Cultural Centre, 1988. People sit and eat together, and the kitchen is maintained and serviced by Sikh community volunteers. ==Etymology== The word langar has origins in the Punjabi language. ==Origins== The langar concept was an innovative charity and symbol of equality introduced by the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak around 1500 CE. The roots of such community kitchen institutions and volunteer run charitable feeding is very old in the Sikh traditions. The Chinese Buddhist pilgrim I Ching (7th-century CE) wrote about monasteries with such volunteer run kitchens. A related concept emerged from the practices of Fariduddin Ganjshakar, a Sufi saint living in the Punjab region during the 13th century, who would redistribute sweets his visitors would bring to his khalifas and common devotees. This concept developed, over time, into langar-khana near his shrine, a practice documented in Jawahir al- Faridi compiled in 1623 CE. According to Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair, a professor of Sikh Studies, community kitchens were already operating in Punjab when Guru Nanak founded Sikhism, and these were run by Muslim Sufi orders. However, Guru Nanak developed it as a part of the institutional framework that helped evolve the community free of any prejudices. Similarly, Hindu temples of the Gupta Empire era had attached kitchen and almshouse called Dharma-shala or Dharma- sattra to feed the travelers and poor for free, or whatever donation they may leave. These community kitchens and rest houses are evidenced in epigraphical evidence, and in some cases referred to as Satram (for example, Annasya Satram), Choultry or Chathram in parts of India.[a] ; [b] Sanctuaries of times past The Hindu (June 27, 2010) ==History== In Sikhism, the practice of the langar, or free kitchen, is believed to have been started by the first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak. It was designed to uphold the principle of equality among all people, regardless of religion, caste, colour, creed, age, gender or social status. The second Guru of Sikhism, Guru Angad, is remembered in Sikh tradition for systematizing the institution of langar in all Sikh temple premises, where visitors from near and far could get a free simple meal in a simple and equal seating. He also set rules and training method for volunteers (sevadars) who operated the kitchen, placing emphasis on treating it as a place of rest and refuge, and being always polite and hospitable to all visitors. It was the third Guru, Amar Das, who established langar as a prominent institution, and required people to dine together irrespective of their caste and class. He encouraged the practice of langar, and made all those who visited him attend langar before they could speak to him. ==Contemporary practice== Langar is a practice which promotes the idea of equality. People sit together on the floor as equals with no discrimination of class, race or income to have a vegetarian meal served by volunteers. Anyone can volunteer in langar, regardless of whether or not they are Sikh adherents. Langars are held in gurdwaras all over the world, most of which attract homeless population. The volunteers feed them without any discrimination, along with the other devotees who gather. Almost all gurdwaras operate langars where local communities, sometimes consisting of hundreds or thousands of visitors, join together for a simple vegetarian meal. ==See also== * Bhog * Prasad (Hinduism) ==Notes and references== ==External links== * Category:Indian cuisine Category:Punjabi words and phrases Category:Sikh practices Category:Sikh terminology Category:Vegetarian dishes of India Category:Free meals Category:Punjabi cuisine ","title":"Langar (Sikhism)"},{"id":"522852","text":"The history of Isan (, ) has been determined by its geography, situated as it is on the Korat Plateau between Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand. The national government claimed that the name \\"Isan\\" was derived from Sanskrit ƒ™≈õƒÅna, a name of Shiva they claimed referred to his rule of the northeast (Sanskrit ƒ´≈õƒÅnya).Royal Institute - 1982: ‡∏≠‡∏µ‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏ô ‡πë This interpretation was intended to reinforce Isan's identity as the northeast of Thailand, rather than as part of the Lao kingdom because of the fear of the Lao people seceding. The Thai king Vajiravudh reinvoked the ancient name, designating the northeast sector of the Rattanakosin Kingdom \\"Isan\\". Previously, in the reign of Chulalongkorn in early 20th century, the sector was generally called Hua Mueang Lao (Lao Townships ) for the area north of Nakhon Ratchasima (Korat) and Khamen Pa Dong (Wilderness Khmer, ) for the townships to the east. Later, the term Isan came into wide, if unofficial, use as a term for the northeastern region, and khon Isan (Isan people, ) as a general term for the peoples of Isan. Isan has been dominated by each of its neighbors in turn, although its relative infertility meant it was more often a battleground than a prize. Rather than being incorporated into the respective empires of each power, the area was divided into mueang (\\"city-states\\", ), each paying tribute to one or more powers under the mandala system. Throughout the 20th century, the Thai government took steps to cement Isan's status as a part of Thailand and to de-emphasize the Lao, Khmer and Kuy origins of its population, a process known as Thaification. Phanom Rung in Buriram. The majority of people in present-day Isan speak the Lao language known as Isan. Many Khmer speakers live in the southern half and substantial minorities of Katuic speakers (i.e., Kuy, Bru, and So) also exist. Most Isan people are both conversant and to some degree literate in Central Thai. Before the central government introduced the Thai alphabet and language in regional schools, the people of Isan wrote in the Lao alphabet, a very similar script that Thai adopted. Most people still speak the Isan language, a dialect of the Lao language, as their first language. A significant minority in the south also speak Northern Khmer. The Kuy people, an Austroasiatic people concentrated around the core of what was once the Chenla Kingdom and known as the Khmer Boran \\"ancient Khmer\\", are a link to the region's pre-Tai history. ==Prehistory== Four Homo erectus fossil skull fragments found in northern Thailand's Hat Pudui cave (Ko Kha District, Lampang Province) by Thai paleontologists Somsak Pramankij and Vadhana Subhavanin, were in deposits dating from the mid-Pleistocene era, which was before the Khorat Plateau had uplifted from an extensive plain. Professor Phillip V. Tobias of Johannesburg's University of the Witwatersrand examined the fragments and said: \\"It seems unavoidable but to conclude that Thailand must have been a highway or crossroads in the movement of hominids -- members of the family of man.\\" Pha Taem cliff paintings alongside the Mekong in Udon Thani Province date to around 1500 BC. They are younger than but similar in composition to the Rock Paintings of Hua Mountain in southern China, which are attributed to the Luoyue people of what is today the lowland plains of northern Vietnam, particularly the marshy, agriculturally rich area of the Red River Delta, and particularly associated with the Bronze Age ƒê√¥ng S∆°n culture of mainland Southeast Asia. Ban Chiang pottery in the Museum f√ºr Indische Kunst, Berlin- DahlemThe Ban Chiang archaeological site, dating from around 3000 BC to 300 AD, attracted attention in 1966 as seemingly the world's oldest site showing traces of a Bronze Age culture, due to errors in dating. In Fine Arts, the site is remarkable for its pottery; further investigation into ancient skeletal remains raised serious questions about transitions to sedentism and intensified agriculture. The question as to why the site was abandoned until resettled by 19th‚Äìcentury Lao √©migr√©s remains to be settled. The Bronze Age site of Ban Non Wat in the southeast of the plateau is also under investigation (2002‚Äìpresent.) ==Early history== Isan Lao people reciting story The first major civilisation to occupy Isan was considered, by the study of artifacts, to be Dvaravati. The remains of walled and moated towns scattered the region, in the valleys of Chi and Mun Rivers. The remains often show the Buddhist and Hinduist influence, perhaps expanding from the western part or the coastal and the Chao Phraya River basin. ==Khmer Domination== From the 11th century, the Dvaravati or Mon culture from the Chao Phraya River basin was gradually displaced by the Khmer Empire of Angkor. Many principal centers became Angkor's tributary states. Consequently, a number of temples influenced by ancient Khmer art were found in Isan, most notably in southern part, at Phanom Rung and Phimai, which lie on the so-called Ancient Khmer Highway, the direct link to Angkor. Inscriptions found also told the connections between vassal towns and the court of Angkor. ==Sukhothai== The Sukhothai Kingdom broke free from the Angkor Empire around the 13th century. Although Isan is not thought to have been a part of the Sukhothai kingdom due to the lack of clear evidence, the Khmer empire became weaker and retreated to its Cambodian heartlands, leaving Isan in the hands of fragmented muang () city-states or statelets. However, many Khmer-speaking people remained and are still a prominent fixture in the southern area, constituting the majority in present- day southern part of the region such as in present-day Surin Province, Buriram Province and are also numerous in part of Sisaket Province. ==Lan Xang== Isan and Southeast Asia c.1707-1828 The Lao kingdom of Lan Xang was established in Luang Prabang in the 14th century by Fa Ngum. The kingdom's name means Million Elephants, echoing the name of the neighboring northern kingdom of Lan Na \\"Million Rice Paddies\\". As the Khmer Empire continued to retreat under pressure from the neighboring Tai kingdoms of the Ayutthaya Kingdom and Lan Xang. Ayutthaya established a presence at Nakhon Ratchasima and Phimai. However, the bulk of the Khorat Plateau fell into the mandala of Lan Xang. Lao settlers began gradually moving across the Mekong into Isan between the 14th and 16th centuries. Major cities were established at Loei, Viang Khuk, Nong Khai, Nong Bua Lamphu (traditionally held by the crown prince), Sakon Nakhon, Nakhon Phanom, Roi Et, Suwannaphume, and Champasak. Additional settlements were located Nong Han Noi, Mahukhanakhon, and a number of settlements across the Mekong from Vientiane including Sri Xiang Mai, Phon Phao, Tha Bo, Say Fong, and Phon Phisai. Many of these early settlements were destroyed or abandoned in the aftermath of the Lao rebellion (1826-1828). Lan Xang was divided by a succession dispute after the death of King Sourigna Vongsa in 1700, into the competing Kingdom of Vientiane, Kingdom of Luang Phrabang and Kingdom of Champasak. Most of what would become the Isan was split between Vientiane and Champasak. ==Siam== With the rise of King Taksin, his Thonburi Kingdom began expanding direct control over the region. Thonburi forces invaded and took control of the Kingdom of Luang Phrabang and the Kingdom of Vientiane and Isan entered its direct orbit. In 1718, Lao settlers in the company of an official in the service of King Nokasad of the Kingdom of Champasak founded mueang Suwannaphum. During late 18th century, the Lao kingdoms of Luang Phrabang and Champasak were increasingly at odds with Vientiane. As Vientiane struggled to maintain control of Isan, a number of dissidents began migrating from Vientiane and taking refuge in Isan. Most of them recognized Siam as their suzerain according to the mandala system. Under this system, mueang leaders were granted something equivalent to a fiefdom and Thai feudal titles as governor, having full right of rulership over their towns. Thus they eventually became the subjects of the royal court in Bangkok. New towns were founded such and Chaiyaphum along with many minor towns such as Han Chai Cham Na. Figure in northeast corner of victory monument in Yasothon facing BangkokIn 1827, King Anouvong of Vientiane rebelled against Siam. After a successful attack on the stronghold of Korat, he was defeated and in Yasothon a memorial to the defeat was raised. The defeat of Anu's revolt was followed by forced migrations from defeated Lao kingdoms to Isan, further increasing the dominance of Lao culture in the region but weakening the mueang of the Lao. The governors of these new towns were semi-autonomous. They had right to rule, to tax their own subject, part of which might be transferred to Bangkok periodically. If time of war, these local rulers had a duty to send troops to defend Siam. Following defeat in the Franco-Siamese War, Siam ceded Luang Phrabang and Champasak to France in 1893 and 1904. Isan became the kingdom's northeast frontier as the buffer zone between French Indochina and Siam, with Siam becoming a 'buffer zone' between Briton and France with the Entente Cordiale. Thus began the process of annexation of Isan area into the modern Siamese nation. Prince Damrong Rajanubhab as the new Minister of Interior (1892) introduced the monthon administration system known as Thesaphiban ( - literally, control over territory) - officially adopted by the 1897 Local Administration Act, which transferred much power from the traditional provincial governors drawn from the local nobility to the newly established monthon commissioners and civil servants (‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏≠‡∏≥‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏ï‡∏¢‡πå - court support) appointed by Bangkok. In 1902, local revolts broke out in Isan, often led by charismatic religious leaders called () or (Holy man). One of the most serious of these rebellions ( ) recalled the resistance to Thonburi authority by the monk Chao Phra Faang, 1768‚Äì70. A former monk and Phu Mi Bun in the Ubon Ratchathani area headed a millenarian sect inspired by his predictions of 'apocalyptic' vision. His apocalyptic prophecy created panic among almost all of the Isan people until the Bangkok government eventually crushed it. From the 20th century onwards, Siam gradually consolidated its control over Isan through a programme of Thaification. The introduction of a national school system in the 1920s replaced instruction by monks in the Isan Lao language with teaching in the Thai language only. Radio and television, when they began, also broadcast in Thai. They included (and still do) twice daily broadcasts of the Thai National Anthem. Even after the Revolution in 1932, when democratic rule began, Isan was ignored by the new Thai government. Most of the region was underdeveloped. Apparently new or necessary infrastructure were hardly built. Albeit the biggest part of Thailand, until now, there are still only two railways in the region and most of modern paved roads were built in the 1960s and 1970s. ==Communism== In the latter half of the 20th century, Isan was perceived by the Thai government as a potential breeding ground for Communism. The region's poverty, special history, remoteness and inaccessible terrain all contributed to this fear. Inevitably, the extent to which Communist insurgents were a real threat in Isan is hard to determine. It is known that there were a number of political attacks from the 1960s onwards, and that Communist activists and equipment entered the region from Laos. On the other hand, the number of guerrillas probably never exceeded a few thousand, and the combination of action by the security forces and the offers of amnesties had largely ended the threat by the early 1980s. ==US bases== The fight against Communism persuaded the government to allow the establishment of a number of US bases in Isan, notably in the provinces of Nakhon Ratchasima, Nakhon Phanom, Udon Thani, Nakhon Sawan and Ubon Ratchathani. Although the bases were directed at Communists in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, they had an indirect effect in promoting development and opposing Communism in Isan. The bases required the creation of improved transport links, facilitating the integration of Isan with the rest of Thailand. The most important of these was Highway 2 named the Mittraphap Road (Friendship Highway,) which links with Bangkok and Isan. and other northeast highways that being with the numeral 2, which link the region's major cities with each other. These remain Isan's primary road links, with many later to be incorporated into the 21st-century Asian Highway Network. Complemented by Thai government programs to build minor roads, these projects did much to bind rural Isan more closely to the cities and to Bangkok. The number of US servicemen reached its peak in 1969 at 50,000.http://www.aznet.net/~rmyers/Chapt3.htm#_ftn8 This influx of US personnel also had a direct effect in exposing the region to western culture. This helped to promote the development of the region, but it also created a sizable sex industry in the vicinity of the bases. Finally, the US military presence contributed substantial sums of money to the area's economy, with emigrant-spouses who accompanied American servicemen continuing to send substantial sums home. The bases were closed at the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. ==Development== The Thai government promoted development in Isan as one weapon in the fight against Communism. In particular, Field Marshal Sarit Dhanarajata, who took control of the country in 1958, was a native of Isan and promoted a number of development projects there. From the 1960s onwards, the government launched a string of development programmes aimed wholly or in part at Isan. These began with a five-year development plan announced in 1961 and backed by US aid. The program's \\"top down\\" approach was satirized in a country song still being sung decades later. An Accelerated Rural Development Programme followed in 1964, again with US support. This was administered by provincial governors in the hope of circumventing the inefficiencies of central government, but it could not evade the problems of bureaucracy, corruption and a conservative mindset which hampered all development efforts. 1960s projects to introduce improved crop strains have been criticised for forcing farmers to take out loans to pay for the seed, fertiliser and equipment required, while reducing genetic diversity. Even in the 1970s, government per capita spending on rural assistance programmes was lower in Isan than anywhere else in Thailand.http://www.aznet.net/~rmyers/Chapt3.htm#_ftn35 Nevertheless, much was achieved: Mobile Rural Development Units focusing on health education trained about 1000 field workers per year in the late 1960s; hydroelectric schemes such as Nam Pong/Ubon Ratana power station in Khon Kaen and Lam Pao in Kalasin provided electricity; modern toilets were distributed; government rice purchase programmes maintained prices. Education efforts increased the proportion of children attending high school from 4.4% in 1970 to 80% by 2000. Universities were established beginning with Khon Kaen University in 1964, soon followed by Mahasarakham University and Suranee University of Technology. ==Recent history== An important political issue at the end of the 20th century was the construction of the Pak Mun dam in the district of Khong Chiam, in Ubon Ratchathani Province. The project was completed in 1994, flooding 117 square kilometres of land and displacing around 3000 families. The project has been criticised for insufficient compensation payments, adverse effects on the fisheries of the Mun River, and failure to produce the projected power output. Protesters against the Pak Mun dam joined with other grassroots activists in 1995 to form the Assembly of the Poor, a group seeking to promote the involvement of the poor in decision-making processes, and to have their interests taken into account. The group has organised a number of protests against the project in Bangkok. The now deposed prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, responded by claiming that activists NGO Living River Siam are trouble-makers who do not reflect the opinions of ordinary people. The same issue arose with the Rasi Salai Dam in Sisaket Province, which was also completed in 1994 for the generation of electricity; it was abandoned for that purpose in 2000 and converted into a recreation area. == Early 21st century == ==See also== * Decline of Angkor & the Emergence of a Theravada Kingdom (section) * Khorat Plateau (Geography, Geology and Archeology sections) * Nang Ai, Phadaeng, and Phangkhi (section) * Peopling of Laos == References Bibliography=== * ==External links== * Isan: The People and Region of Northeast Thailand by Ron Myers * Isan History by Char Karnchanapee * Origins of Angkor Archaeological Project * * ==Further reading== * Twentieth century impressions of Siam its history, people, commerce, industries, and resources, with which is incorporated an abridged edition of Twentieth century impressions of British Malaya.

It was discovered in 1826 by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop from his home in Parramatta, in New South Wales, Australia. There is considerable debate in the literature regarding the galaxy's fundamental properties such as its Hubble type (lenticular galaxy or a giant elliptical galaxy) and distance (10‚Äì16 million light-years). NGC 5128 is one of the closest radio galaxies to Earth, so its active galactic nucleus has been extensively studied by professional astronomers. The galaxy is also the fifth-brightest in the sky, making it an ideal amateur astronomy target, although the galaxy is only visible from low northern latitudes and the southern hemisphere. The center of the galaxy contains a supermassive black hole with a mass of 55 million solar masses, which ejects a relativistic jet that is responsible for emissions in the X-ray and radio wavelengths. By taking radio observations of the jet separated by a decade, astronomers have determined that the inner parts of the jet are moving at about half of the speed of light. X-rays are produced farther out as the jet collides with surrounding gases, resulting in the creation of highly energetic particles. The X-ray jets of Centaurus A are thousands of light-years long, while the radio jets are over a million light- years long. Like other starburst galaxies, a collision is suspected to be responsible for the intense burst of star formation. Models have suggested that Centaurus A was a large elliptical galaxy that collided and merged with a smaller spiral galaxy. == Observational history == NGC 5128 was discovered on 29 April 1826 by James Dunlop during a survey at the Parramatta Observatory. Centaurus A is listed on p. 138 as entry number 482. A sketch of Centaurus A appears as Fig. 20 on the plate between pages 114 and 115. In 1847 John Herschel described the galaxy as \\"two semi-ovals of elliptically formed nebula appearing to be cut asunder and separated by a broad obscure band parallel to the larger axis of the nebula, in the midst of which a faint streak of light parallel to the sides of the cut appears.\\" In 1949 John Gatenby Bolton, Bruce Slee and Gordon Stanley localized NGC 5128 as one of the first extragalactic radio sources. Five years later, Walter Baade and Rudolph Minkowski suggested that the peculiar structure is the result of a merge event of a giant elliptical galaxy and a small spiral galaxy. The first detection of X-ray emissions, using a sounding rocket, was performed in 1970. In 1975‚Äì76 gamma- ray emissions from Centaurus A were observed through the atmospheric Cerenkov technique. The Einstein Observatory detected an X-ray jet emanating from the nucleus in 1979. Ten years later, young blue stars were found along the central dust band with the Hubble Space Telescope. The Chandra X-ray Observatory identified in 1999 more than 200 new point sources. Another space telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope, found a parallelogram-shaped structure of dust in near infrared images of Centaurus A in 2006. Evidence of gamma emissions with very high energy (more than 100 GeV) was detected by the H.E.S.S-Observatorium in Namibia in 2009. The following year, Centaurus A was identified as a source of cosmic rays of highest energies, after years of observations by Pierre Auger Observatory. In 2016 a review of data from Chandra and XMM-Newton, unusual high flares of energy were found in NGC 5128 and the galaxy NGC 4636. Jimmy Erwin of University of Alabama hypothesized the discovery as potentially a black hole in a yet unknown process or an intermediate-mass black hole. ==Morphology== Centaurus A may be described as having a peculiar morphology. As seen from Earth, the galaxy looks like a lenticular or elliptical galaxy with a superimposed dust lane. The peculiarity of this galaxy was first identified in 1847 by John Herschel, and the galaxy was included in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies (published in 1966) as one of the best examples of a \\"disturbed\\" galaxy with dust absorption. The galaxy's strange morphology is generally recognized as the result of a merger between two smaller galaxies. Zoom movie of the galaxy Centaurus A, showing different aspects of the galaxy in several wavelengths. Schematic diagram of the components of the Centaurus A galaxy The bulge of this galaxy is composed mainly of evolved red stars. The dusty disk, however, has been the site of more recent star formation; over 100 star formation regions have been identified in the disk. ==Supernovae== Two supernovae have been detected in Centaurus A. The first supernova, named SN 1986G, was discovered within the dark dust lane of the galaxy by R. Evans in 1986. It was later identified as a Type Ia supernova, which forms when a white dwarf's mass grows large enough to ignite carbon fusion in its center, touching off a runaway thermonuclear reaction, as may happen when a white dwarf in a binary star system strips gas away from the other star. SN 1986G was used to demonstrate that the spectra of type Ia supernovae are not all identical, and that type Ia supernovae may differ in the way that they change in brightness over time. The second supernova, dubbed SN2016adj, was discovered by Backyard Observatory Supernova Search in February 2016 and was initially classified as a Type II supernova based on its H-alpha emission line. A subsequent classification found the spectrum best resembled the Type Ib core-collapse supernova 1999dn (See Type Ib and Ic supernovae). ==Distance== Distance estimates to Centaurus A established since the 1980s typically range between 3‚Äì5 Mpc. Classical Cepheids discovered in the heavily obscured dust lane of Centaurus A yield a distance between ~3‚Äì3.5 Mpc, depending on the nature of the extinction law adopted and other considerations. Mira variables and Type II Cepheids were also discovered in Centaurus A, the latter being rarely detected beyond the Local Group. The distance to Centaurus A established from several indicators such as Mira variables and planetary nebulae favour a more distant value of ~3.8 Mpc. ==Nearby galaxies and galaxy group information== Centaurus A is at the center of one of two subgroups within the Centaurus A/M83 Group, a nearby group of galaxies. Messier 83 (the Southern Pinwheel Galaxy) is at the center of the other subgroup. These two groups are sometimes identified as one group and sometimes identified as two groups. However, the galaxies around Centaurus A and the galaxies around M83 are physically close to each other, and both subgroups appear not to be moving relative to each other. The Centaurus A/M83 Group is located in the Virgo Supercluster. == Observations  Radio waves === This view of the jets of Centaurus A was created through observations in radio waves with a wavelength of 20 cm with the VLA. The position of the radio jet and the knots within the jets matches very well with the structures seen in the x-ray jet. This region of the jet is named ‚ÄûInner Lobe‚Äú.Inner Radio Lobes of Centaurus A (NGC 5128). ==Visibility== Elliptical galaxy Centaurus A and its globular clusters Centaurus A is located approximately 4¬∞ north of Omega Centauri (a globular cluster visible with the naked eye). Because the galaxy has a high surface brightness and relatively large angular size, it is an ideal target for amateur astronomy observations. The bright central bulge and dark dust lane are visible even in finderscopes and large binoculars, and additional structure may be seen in larger telescopes. Centaurus A is visible to the naked eye under exceptionally good conditions.

The Great Satan (; Shayt√¢n-e Bozorg) is a demonizing epithet for the United States of America in Iranian foreign policy statements. Occasionally, these words have also been used toward the government of the United Kingdom. The term was used by Iranian leader Ruhollah Khomeini in his speech on November 5, 1979 to describe the United States, which he accused of imperialism and the sponsoring of corruption throughout the world. The speech occurred one day after the onset of the Iran hostage crisis. Ayatollah Khomeini also occasionally used the term \\"Iblis\\" (the primary devil in Islam) to refer to the United States and other Western countries. ==Background== The post-revolutionary government of Iran has regarded the United States and the United Kingdom as imperialist states, who have a long history of interfering in Iran's internal affairs. In 1907, an Anglo-Russian agreement between Russia and Britain divided Iran into spheres of influence, ignoring, although not terminating, Iran's sovereignty. In 1953, during the Cold War, British intelligence officials and the administration of the U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower planned a joint Anglo-American operation to overthrow the elected prime minister, Mohammad Mossadeq. The Eisenhower administration was concerned that Mossadeq's nationalist aspirations could lead to an eventual communist takeover of Iran. The operation was code-named Operation Ajax. At first, the military coup seemed to fail, and Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi fled the country. After widespread rioting and with help from the CIA and British intelligence services, Mossadeq was defeated and the Shah returned to power, ensuring support for Western (chiefly British) oil interests and ending the perceived threat of communist expansion. General Fazlollah Zahedi, who led the military coup, became prime minister. In 1965, Ayatollah Khomeini was exiled for criticizing the White Revolution's vote to women, land reform and the Shah's unpopular Status of Forces Bill, which gave U.S. military personnel diplomatic immunity for crimes committed in Iran. By the early 1970s, many Iranians opposed the Shah's government. Khomeini eventually returned to Iran and led the 1979 Iranian revolution. During the Iranian Revolution, demonstrators commonly chanted slogans such as \\"Death to Shah,\\" \\"Independence, Freedom, Islamic Republic,\\" and \\"Death to America\\". ==Definition== The Great Satan by Carlos Latuff Khomeini is quoted as saying on November 5, 1979, \\"[America is] the great Satan, the wounded snake.\\"Christopher Buck, Religious myths and visions of America: how minority faiths redefined America's world role, page 136 The term was used extensively during and after the Islamic Revolution,Iran & the Great Satan and it continues to be used in some Iranian political circles. Use of the term at rallies is often accompanied by shouts of \\"Marg bar Amrika!\\" (\\"Death to America\\"). It is used in academic journals. ===Lesser Satan=== Khomeini called the Soviet Union, the principal antagonist of the US during the Cold War, the \\"Lesser Satan\\" because of its atheistic communist ideology, and he said that Iran should support neither side of the Cold War. The State of Israel was condemned as the \\"Little Satan\\" in 1979 by Khomeini when he was addressing Israel's backing of the Shah, its close ties to the US, and the ongoing Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. Former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi also stated that \\"Israel is the little Satan\\" in a July 1980 interview. ==See also== * Iran‚ÄìUnited States relations * Devil (Islam) *Anti- American sentiment *Anti-Israeli sentiment **Little Satan **Zionist entity ==References and notes* The Great Satan by Kavitha Rao, April 26, 2000 * 'Great Satan' warned of a burning hell by Ian Black, The Guardian, February 16, 2005 * How the \\"Great Satan\\" Became Just Great Category:Iran‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:Political terminology of Iran Category:Political catchphrases Category:Pejoratives Category:Anti-Western sentiment Category:Anti-Americanism Category:Anti-imperialism Category:Ruhollah Khomeini ","title":"Great Satan"},{"id":"522897","text":"Order of the Smile The Order of the Smile (Polish: Order U≈õmiechu) is an international award given by children to adults distinguished in their love, care and aid for children. ==History== Museum of the Order of the Smile The idea of the Order of the Smile was established in 1968 by the Polish magazine Kurier Polski, inspired by Wanda Chotomska. In 1979 (announced by the International Year of the Child) the Secretary-General of the United Nations Kurt Waldheim officially recognized the Order. From then, the Order of the Smile became an international order. In 1996, in Rabka, the Order of the Smile Museum was established on the grounds of the family park known as \\"Rabkoland.\\" After the region had been given the official status of the \\"City of Children from around the World,\\" an initiative was put forward to open a permanent Polish Santa's Village, which would accept letters addressed to Santa Claus from children across Poland. In 2003 an International Charter of the Order of the Smile session took place outside the Warsaw headquarters in ≈öwidnica, where the Child Friendship Center was being erected. ≈öwidnica had been officially titled the \\"Capital of Children's Dreams,\\" and September 21, 2003, was declared Order of the Smile Children's Day. ==Design== Chotomska's television series Jacek i Agatka announced a competition to submit a design for the Order of the Smile. The award's logo was created and developed by a nine-year-old girl from G≈Çucho≈Çazy, Ewa Chrobak.\\"Jacek i Agatka on Muzeum Dobranocek\\" Retrieved 2014-06-30. Using a plate as a template, she drew a sun, and added uneven rays of light. The design, one of 45,000 that had been submitted, was chosen by Szymon Kobyli≈Ñski, who elaborated it into its current form. == Nomination == All candidates for the Order of Smile should be nominated by children. Nominations can come from a single child or collectively from many children. Nominations can be submitted from all around the world. The candidates should be people of extraordinary love and work for children. Nominations should be sent to the International Chapter of the Order of Smile (ICOS). Afterwards the candidates are chosen to be Laureates by the Chapter. The Order is awarded twice a year: in spring and in fall. Laureates of the Order of Smile include now about 1000 people from almost 50 countries (state of April 2016). ==Decorating== The medal - which is a badge representing a smiling sun - is awarded in Warsaw, Poland by the International Chapter of the Order of the Smile. There is a special procedure of the decoration. In special cases the decoration could be held outside Poland, in the country of the laurate.

He has preached at major universities in all fifty US states, and in some other countries. As an itinerant preacher, he usually only spends a few days on each campus, visiting the northern campuses in the fall and spring and the southern campuses in the winter months. In 2004 he relocated to Columbia, Missouri where he often preached at the University of Missouri and other colleges throughout the Midwest. In the summer of 2013 he relocated his ministry and residence to his hometown of Terre Haute, Indiana. == Biography == Brother Jed's self-described lifestyle of \\"drunkenness, dissipation, and debauchery\\" began while he was a freshman in high school. Older friends exposed him to alcohol, which became a regular part of his life. Smock began attending Indiana State University in 1960, studying social studies and English. By his second year he had established himself as the heaviest drinker in the fraternity. Smock states in his autobiography that, despite his lifestyle, he graduated near the top of his class. Smock attended graduate school at Indiana State University, where he earned a master's degree in history and wrote a thesis on \\"the personal effects of smoking seven straight joints of marijuana\\" while he was a research assistant in psychology for the Institute of Research into Human Behavior at the school. Smock served as a history professor for one year at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìLa Crosse. He converted to Christianity after being preached to by an Arab carrying a cross in Morocco.\\"Teacher preacher\\". The Advocate.

In 2004 the group moved its operations from Newark, Ohio to Columbia, Missouri, where he often preached at the University of Missouri on Speakers Circle. Brother Jed left Columbia for Indiana in 2013. His family was documented for a pilot TV series while preaching in Indiana.

Smock and his wife Cindy use a distinctive preaching style, termed \\"confrontational evangelism\\" in the subtitle of his autobiography. This controversial variant of evangelismCollege crusader condemns students , The State Hornet is shared by some street and campus preachers, who hope that a spiritual rebuke will force sinners to repent.Students confront aggressive preachers , The Maneater In his autobiography Smock refers to his college evangelical group as \\"The Destroyers,\\" but this name is not presently being used on his website. Smock is a member of the United Methodist Church, although his actions, views, and theology are not indicative of its positions. College newspapers have reported some of his statements: \\"I don't know how the whorehouses in this town stay open ‚Äî all of you sorority girls are giving it away for free!\\" and \\"Who are you, Bob Marley?\\" (addressed to a black student with dreadlocks). He often shouts, \\"A masturbator today is a homosexual tomorrow.\\" His assistants carry signs declaring that feminists, liberals, and those who listen to rock and roll are destined for Hell, along with homosexuals, fornicators, those who use tampons, and masturbators. As a result of his aggressive, rude and confrontational style of preaching, Brother Jed is frequently mocked and accused of intolerance. Smock's behavior and beliefs are not accepted in most Christian circles, and some view his beliefs as cultish. Besides issues relating to coarse language with immodest sexual references, Smock claims to be sinless, holding an unorthodox position called sinless perfection. He identifies himself with the teachings of Pelagius, a heretical British monk who denied moral inability and the effects of original sin.http://www.brojed.org/cms/commentary/faq/95-what-is-your-opinion-of- pelagius Evangelical Christians and Roman Catholics uniformly consider Pelagianism to be a heresy. In addition, he holds a view of God which denies that goodness is an essential attribute of God's nature. His theological positions are indicative of moral government theology, which is also considered to be heretical by evangelical Christianity. == Fictional portrayals == Smock's character was the basis of the 2012 short, Battle of the Sects,IMDB - Battle of the Sects (2012) in which an extreme evangelical preacher visits a university only to be run out by the campus Christians. == See also == * List of campus preachers == Notes == == External links == * * The Brother Jed Phenomenon ‚Äì Brother Jed incorporated this op-ed from Cal Poly's Mustang Daily into his autobiographical book Who Will Rise Up? * Brother Jed moves beyond Speakers Circle, Columbia Missourian == Further reading == * Handelman, David \\"College is Hell: The Destroyers have preached hellfire and damnation on campus for a decade.

He won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay as one of the writers of the 2004 film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, a film he also directed. His other films include the surrealistic science fantasy comedy The Science of Sleep (2006), the comedy Be Kind Rewind (2008), the superhero action comedy The Green Hornet (2011), the drama The We and the I (2012), and the romantic science fantasy tragedy Mood Indigo (2013). He is well known for his music video collaborations with Daft Punk, Donald Fagen, Radiohead, Bj√∂rk, Beck, The Chemical Brothers, Kylie Minogue, IDLES, and The White Stripes. ==Early life== Gondry was born in Versailles. He is the grandson of inventor Constant Martin. ==Career== Gondry in 2008 Gondry's vision and career began with his emphasis on emotion. Much of his inspiration, he says, came from the film Le voyage en ballon. He stated: \\"When I watch this movie, I dream I'm flying and then I do stories where people are flying. I think it's directly influencing.\\"Robert K. Elder interview with Michel Gondry, The Film That Changed My Life, Chicago Review Press, 2011, pg. 151. His career as a filmmaker began with creating music videos for the French rock band Oui Oui, in which he also served as a drummer. The style of his videos for Oui Oui caught the attention of music artist Bj√∂rk, who asked him to direct the video for her song \\"Human Behaviour\\". The collaboration proved long-lasting, with Gondry directing a total of eight music videos for Bj√∂rk. Other artists who have collaborated with Gondry on more than one occasion include Daft Punk, The White Stripes, The Chemical Brothers, The Vines, Steriogram, Radiohead, and Beck. Gondry's video for Lucas Secon's \\"Lucas with the Lid Off\\" was nominated in the Best Music Video (short form) category at the 37th Grammy Awards, (one of two Gondry music videos nominated that year along with Sin√©ad O'Connor's Fire On Babylon). Gondry has also created numerous television commercials. He pioneered the \\"bullet time\\" technique later adapted in The Matrix in the 1996 \\"Smarienberg\\" commercial for Smirnoff vodka, as well as directing a trio of inventive holiday-themed advertisements for clothing retailer Gap. Gondry, along with directors Spike Jonze and David Fincher, is representative of the influx of music video directors into feature film. Gondry made his feature film debut in 2001 with Human Nature, garnering mixed reviews. His second film, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (also his second collaboration with screenwriter Charlie Kaufman), was released in 2004 and received very favorable reviews, becoming one of the most critically acclaimed films of the year. Eternal Sunshine utilizes many of the image manipulation techniques that Gondry had experimented with in his music videos. Gondry won an Academy Award alongside Kaufman and Pierre Bismuth for the screenplay of Eternal Sunshine. The style of Gondry's music videos often relies on videography and camera tricks which play with frames of reference. Gondry also directed the musical documentary Dave Chappelle's Block Party (2006) which followed comedian Dave Chappelle as he attempted to hold a large, free concert in the Bedford- Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. His following film, The Science of Sleep, hit theaters in September 2006. This film stars Mexican actor Gael Garc√≠a Bernal, and marked a return to the fantastical, surreal techniques he employed in Eternal Sunshine. According to the Guinness World Records 2004, Gondry's Levi's 501 Jeans \\"Drugstore\\" spot holds the record for \\"Most awards won by a TV commercial\\". The commercial was never aired in North America because of the suggestive content involving purchasing latex condoms. He was asked by French comic duet √âric and Ramzy to direct Seuls Two, but declined; by his suggestion, √âric and Ramzy subsequently asked Mr Oizo to direct another movie, Steak. In September 2006, Gondry made his debut as an installation artist at Deitch Projects in New York City's SoHo gallery district. The show, called \\"The Science of Sleep: An Exhibition of Sculpture and Pathological Creepy Little Gifts\\" featured props from his film, The Science of Sleep, as well as film clips and a selection of gifts that the artist had given to women he was interested in, many of them former or current collaborators, Karen Baird, Kishu Chand, Dorothy Barrick and Lauri Faggioni. A leitmotif of the film is a 'Disastrology' calendar; Gondry commissioned the painter Baptiste Ibar to draw harrowing images of natural and human disasters. His brother Olivier \\"Twist\\" Gondry is also a television commercial and music video director creating videos for bands such as The Stills, Hot Hot Heat, Daft Punk and The Vines. Michel's son Paul Gondry is an artist, actor, and film director as well. Gondry was an Artist in Residence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2005 and 2006. Later directing the music video for the Paul McCartney song \\"Dance Tonight\\", in which Gondry makes a cameo appearance. Gondry directed \\"Unnatural Love\\", the fifth episode in season two of HBO's Flight of the Conchords. Interior Design one third of the 2008 anthology film Tokyo! was next for Gondry. Interior Design was based on the comic book \\"Cecil and Jordan in New York\\" by Gabrielle Bell but was adapted from New York City to Tokyo for the film. In 2009, The Thorn in the Heart, another feature documentary, was released, it is about Michel's aunt Suzette and her son Jean-Yves. In 2011, Gondry directed The Green Hornet, a superhero film by Sony starring Seth Rogen, Jay Chou and Christoph Waltz; Rogen co-wrote the script. In 2011, he was the head of the jury for the short film competition at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. His film The We and the I was selected to be screened in the Directors' Fortnight section at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival. On 3 January 2013, Gondry released his latest animated short Haircut Mouse on his official Vimeo channel. In February 2013, Gondry released a hand-drawn animated documentary on famed linguist Noam Chomsky, Is the Man Who is Tall Happy?. In 2014, he was selected as a member of the jury for the 64th Berlin International Film Festival. On 23 January 2013, Gondry was confirmed to have produced the video for Metronomy's upcoming single, Love Letters, as it was named Zane Lowe's Hottest Record in the World. ==FilmographyFilm=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"margin-right: 0;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" scope=\\"col\\"  Title ! rowspan=\\"2\\" scope=\\"col\\"  Year - ! width=\\"65\\" Director ! width=\\"65\\" Writer ! width=\\"65\\" Producer !

According to The Kipling Society, the word shere (or shir) translates as 'tiger', and khan is a title of distinction, used together \\"to show that he is the chief among tigers.\\"\\"Kipling's list of names in the stories\\", excerpted from volume XII of The Complete Works, Sussex edition, 1936. ==The original Jungle Book stories== Shere Khan is depicted by Kipling with being born with a crippled leg and was derisively nicknamed \\"Lungri\\" (\\"The Lame One\\") by his mother. Despite this condition, Shere Khan is arrogant and regards himself as the \\"rightful\\" lord of the jungle. The only creature who looks up to him is Tabaqui, a cowardly and despised golden jackal.In Hindi lungri is the adjective's female form. The corresponding male form would be lungra, ‡§≤‡§Ç‡§ó‡§°‡§º‡§æ. See or In \\"Mowgli's Brothers\\", Shere Khan's failed attempt to hunt humans causes a human \\"cub\\" to stray from its parents. When Shere Khan discovers the infant, it has been adopted by Indian wolves, Raksha and Father Wolf, who have named the child Mowgli. Mowgli is accepted into Akela's wolf pack and is protected by Bagheera (a panther) and Baloo (a bear). Furious at losing his kill, the tiger swears that the boy will be his some day. While Mowgli is growing up, Shere Khan infiltrates the wolf pack by promising the younger wolves rich rewards once Akela is deposed. When the young wolves manoeuvre Akela into missing his kill, the pack council meets to kill and replace him. Shere Khan threatens to take over their hunting territory if the wolves don't give him Mowgli. Having been warned by Bagheera, Mowgli attacks Shere Khan and his allies with a burning branch (the mysterious and powerful \\"red flower\\" of man) and drives them away. Akela leaves the pack to become a lone hunter. Mowgli goes to the human village but swears that he will return one day with Shere Khan's skin. Shere Khan also appears in the story \\"How Fear Came\\", which is set between the first and second halves of the \\"Mowgli's Brothers,\\" and probably sometime after \\"Kaa's Hunting\\". In this story the tiger comes to drink from the river just after having killed a human purely for sport, leading Hathi the elephant to tell the story of why tigers, out of all the animals in the jungle, are allowed to hunt humans for pleasure at certain times. This story, in which Mowgli appears mainly as an observer, may be seen as a direct ancestor of Kipling's Just So Stories. In \\"Tiger! Tiger!\\", Mowgli is adopted by Messua and her husband and learns human ways. In this short story, Mowgli learns the villagers have heard of the tiger Shere Khan, who also has a bounty on his head, but believe the tiger's lame because he's the reincarnation of a money- lender injured in a riot. When Mowgli scoffs at these fanciful tales, the villagers decide to put him to work herding buffalo. He then meets his wolf friend Grey Brother, who tells him that Shere Khan is still planning to kill him. Grey Brother forces Tabaqui to tell him where and when Shere Khan is planning to strike; then kills the jackal. With the help of Akela, Grey Brother and Mowgli trap Shere Khan in a narrow canyon and incite the buffalo to stampede him to death. ==In film and televisionDisney versions=== The Jungle Book In Disney's 1967 animated adaptation of The Jungle Book, Shere Khan's voice was performed by George Sanders, while his singing voice was provided by Bill Lee and his roars were performed by Jimmy MacDonald. He was designed and animated by animator Milt Kahl. The inhabitants of the jungle fear him greatly; mere news of his being in the vicinity compels the wolf pack to send Mowgli away. Man's gun and fire are the only things Shere Khan fears, and consequently, he feels the urge to kill humans whenever the opportunity presents itself. Shere Khan first appears about two-thirds of the way through the film where, after having been interrupted during a hunt by Colonel Hathi, he eavesdrops on Bagheera asking the elephants to help search for a now-lost Mowgli and sets out to find and kill the boy. He later encounters Kaa just as he was going to eat Mowgli, but the snake denies any knowledge of the man-cub. Doubting Kaa's honesty, Shere Khan threatens Kaa into showing his middle by loosening his coils, inadvertently allowing Mowgli to escape after the tiger resumes his search. In the climax, Shere Khan finds Mowgli, who refuses to run and instead stands up against the tiger, saying that he is not afraid. Impressed by Mowgli's bravery, Shere Khan, for his own amusement, gives him a 10-second head start to run away. But Mowgli still refuses and grabs a log, intent on fighting the tiger. Shere Khan becomes annoyed and immediately attempts to attack Mowgli, who flinches in fear, finally understanding the true danger of the ferocious beast. Fortunately, Baloo arrives just in time and grabs Shere Khan by the tail. Mowgli then hits Shere Khan with his log. Enraged, he chases Mowgli while dragging Baloo behind him, but the vultures manage to fly Mowgli to safety. Baloo proves such a strong opponent to Shere Khan that he decides to savage the bear, nearly killing him. Upon learning that Shere Khan is afraid of fire, Mowgli grabs a burning branch from a tree struck by a bolt of lightning, and the vultures distract Shere Khan long enough for Mowgli to tie the branch to his tail. Shere Khan panics and is forced to flee. The Jungle Book 2 Shere Khan returned (and had more on-screen time) in The Jungle Book 2. Humiliated by the ordeal of his tail being tied to a burning branch in the original film, the tiger has sworn to kill Mowgli for revenge. He first searches the Man Village and is chased off by the villagers. He then searches the jungle for Mowgli and is lied to by Kaa, who tells him that Mowgli is at the swamp out of fear, and being pestered by Lucky, a new but dim-witted member of the vultures, who accidentally reveals Mowgli's whereabouts before Shere Khan violently attacks him for his jokes, causing the other 4 vultures to fly away in fear. Shere Khan and Mowgli ultimately meet again as Mowgli tries to reconcile with Shanti and Ranjan, who, unbeknownst to him, were cornered by the tiger at that very moment. Barely escaping, Mowgli hides in an abandoned temple surrounded by lava. Shanti, Ranjan, Baloo, and Bagheera hurry to save Mowgli. After Baloo and Shanti team up, they, along with Mowgli, confuse Shere Khan by banging 3 different gongs. Eventually, Shanti's gong collapses, giving away her hiding place. Shere Khan threatens to kill Shanti instead unless Mowgli comes out of hiding, forcing Mowgli to reveal himself. Shere Khan then chases the 2 of them, despite Baloo's efforts to slow him down. Mowgli and Shanti jump over a pit of molten lava and grab onto the head of a tiger statue. Shere Khan leaps across and corners the children. Before he can kill them, his weight causes the statue to fall with the 3 of them on it. Shanti and Mowgli are saved by Baloo while Shere Khan falls onto a stone slab in the lava pit, and the statue lands on top of him, trapping him inside its mouth. He is last seen being taunted by Lucky. In The Jungle Book 2, Shere Khan was voiced by Tony Jay, who reprised his role from the Disney Afternoon series TaleSpin. TaleSpin Shere Khan's character was included in the 1990 Disney Afternoon series TaleSpin, cast as the wealthy mogul of a company called Khan Industries in the harbour city of Cape Suzette. He was a nominal villain who occasionally took enjoyment in driving small companies out of business to expand his own enterprise, but sometimes allied with the heroes when it suited him. 1994 live-action film In the 1994 live-action film The Jungle Book, Shere Khan is presented as a more sympathetic character. In the film, Shere Khan does not kill for sport, and his sole goal is to protect the jungle from those who break \\"the laws of the jungle\\" (the most basic of which are killing to eat or to keep from being eaten), including humans who trespass with guns and kill animals for fun instead of food. At the beginning of the film, he sees two British guards and a hunter named Buldeo shooting animals for sport and becomes enraged at this. That night, he attacks the humans' camp in revenge for the animals' death and kills Mowgli's father Nathoo, who was defending Buldeo (not knowing what Buldeo had done), in the process. Shere Khan also kills a guard and a British sergeant named Claiborne, both of whom were responsible for the jungle law being broken alongside Buldeo. This event is what led Mowgli to be separated from civilization and to live in the jungle to survive. Shere Khan is not seen again until the second half of the film, which takes place twenty years after the first act, when he spots several hunters (led by Captain William Boone) and roars to announce his approach. He goes on to maul Lieutenant Wilkins (a henchman of Boone) to death when he gets separated. Following Boone's death by Kaa, Shere Khan and Mowgli meet face to face for the first time. Shere Khan is obviously distrusting of Mowgli and all humans. He attempts to scare Mowgli away by roaring in his face, but Mowgli stubbornly roars back and stares Shere Khan down. Seeing Mowgli's courage, Shere Khan develops a newfound respect for him, and begins to see him as a fellow \\"creature of the jungle\\". Because of this, Shere Khan spares Mowgli and allows him and his friend Katherine Brydon to leave peacefully. Jungle Cubs Shere Khan also appears in the 1996 Disney animated series Jungle Cubs, where he is a tiger cub. He is more of a bully than a predator but is friends with the other characters. Shere Khan is voiced by Jason Marsden. The producers originally wanted Shere Khan to keep his British accent for the show, but later changed their mind, and Shere Khan ended up with an American accent, completely different from that of his adult version. The adult version of himself appears in the Jungle Cubs: Born to be Wild video (again voiced by Tony Jay), and in these cut scenes, he attempts to kill Mowgli when Mowgli, Baloo and Bagheera walk into his part of the jungle. Baloo and Bagheera try to reason with Shere Khan by recounting the \\"Red Dogs\\" story, in which they and the other animals saved Shere Khan's life, but Shere Khan refuses to listen and says to them the past is the past. Baloo then throws a stone at a beehive and grabs Shere Khan by the head, letting go only when the beehive falls on his head. Shere Khan, with the beehive still on his head, runs away from the angry bees. The Jungle Book: Mowgli's Story Shere Khan appears once again as a villain in the 1998 film The Jungle Book: Mowgli's Story, where he is voiced by Sherman Howard and accompanied by his sidekick Tabaqui, who in this version is a spotted hyena. In the film, he kills Raksha in Monkey Town when she comes to rescue Mowgli. During the final battle, Mowgli uses fire in order to banish Shere Khan from his jungle. Shere Khan complies and leaves the jungle. 2016 live-action film The Jungle Book (2016) Idris Elba voices Shere Khan in the 2016 live-action film The Jungle Book. In this incarnation, Shere Khan has several noticeable burns, including a blinded left eye. He also hates humans and views them all as a threat, much as his previous Disney incarnation does. When interviewed regarding the character, Elba described Shere Khan as the \\"lord of the jungle\\", a creature \\"that reigns with fear\\" and that he \\"terrorizes everyone he encounters because he comes from a place of fear.\\" Shere Khan first appears during the drought, when the animals gather to drink at Peace Rock, a watering hole where the animals maintain a water truce not to devour each other while quenching their thirst. Upon scenting Mowgli, he threatens to kill him as man is not allowed to live in the jungle. This causes Akela and his wolf pack to debate whether to have Mowgli leave. When Mowgli leaves the wolf pack with Bagheera, Shere Khan ambushes him en route and fights with Bagheera. Though Shere Khan defeats and mildly injures Bagheera, Mowgli escapes with the aid of a stampeding water buffalo herd. During Kaa's attempt to hypnotise Mowgli, she reveals that Shere Khan himself is responsible for Mowgli being found by Bagheera, as he killed Mowgli's father (an event that left him with his burns and passionate hatred for humans). Shere Khan later returns to confront Akela's pack and demand Mowgli is turned over to him, killing Akela by grabbing him in his jaws and throwing the wolf leader off a cliff when he learns that Mowgli is on his way to the Man-village. He then assumes control of the wolves, confident that Mowgli will return as he orders them to spread the word. Later that night, Shere Khan tells the wolf pups the story of the cuckoo bird. He admits to Raksha that he never wanted Mowgli to leave the jungle, he wanted him dead. When Mowgli hears of Akela's death, he returns to face Shere Khan at the river with a burning torch stolen from the Man-village. Shere Khan points out that he has accidentally started a wildfire in the process, and that the animals now have more reason to fear Mowgli than Shere Khan. When Mowgli throws away the torch, Shere Khan attacks Mowgli, but Baloo, Bagheera and the wolf pack see Mowgli's courage and stand up to Shere Khan. Finally losing his cool and unleashing his true behavior as a vicious tiger, Shere Khan attempts to kill all the animals to get to Mowgli, but the combined efforts of Baloo, Bagheera and the wolf pack keep him distracted long enough for Mowgli to set a trap in the burning jungle nearby. During their battle, Mowgli lures Shere Khan onto a dead strangler fig tree and eventually defeats him by causing him to fall into the fires below.  Other  In the Descendants novel \\"The Isle of the Lost\\", Shere Khan is shown as an inmate of the Isle of the Lost. He is shown to have a soft spot for the Evil Queen's daughter Evie. === Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle (2018) === In the 2018 live-action film Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle, Shere Khan is portrayed in motion-capture and voice-over by Benedict Cumberbatch. This version of Shere Khan bears a closer resemblance to his novel counterpart in that he is crippled with a deformed front leg. He is also considerably more sinister than previous incarnations as he continually strives to gain more power and influence among the jungle's creatures as he seeks to kill Mowgli. Shere Khan first appears in the beginning of the film breaking jungle law by killing Mowgli's parents. When the infant Mowgli escapes him thanks to the intervention of Bagheera and the wolf pack, Shere Khan is informed of his whereabouts by his hyena minion Tabaqui and challenges Akela for him. When this fails, Shere Khan leaves for many years until he announces his return by killing man's cattle and leaving it for Baloo and the pack to find. He also pursues Mowgli during the latter's swim and subsequent escape, but fails to catch him after Mowgli falls into a tiger pit and an elephant rescues him. Shere Khan next appears when the Bandar-Log monkeys bring Mowgli to him on Tabaqui's orders, where he tries to eat Mowgli while the boy has been knocked unconscious. The intervention of Baloo, Bagheera and Kaa stops Shere Khan, and he waits until Akela is challenged for leadership to try and claim the boy again after Akela fails to catch a deer. However, Mowgli drives him away with a burning branch taken from the Man-Village. Afterwards, Shere Khan divides the wolf pack with his followers haranguing and raiding Akela's pack and their allies. Mowgli, having lived in the Man-Village and seeking to rid the jungle of the tiger's influence, calls out Shere Khan. The boy then faces off against the tiger, aided by the elephants before he manages to mortally wound Shere Khan. However, the hunter pursuing Shere Khan, John Lockwood, accidentally grazes Mowgli with a bullet and shoots Akela as he stops the tiger from killing Mowgli causing the elephant whose tusk was shot off by Lockwood to intervene and kill the hunter to prevent more death. As the other animals rally to Mowgli, Shere Khan slinks away and collapses, playing dead to try and lure Mowgli in. However, Mowgli fails to let his guard down and kills Shere Khan with his knife as the tiger tries to kill him, ending his reign of terror once and for all. ===Other appearances=== * Shere Khan appeared in the 1942 film adaptation by the Hungarian brothers, Zoltan and Alexander Korda, with the screenplay written by Laurence Stallings. * In the 1967 Russian animated short series Adventures of Mowgli, Shere Khan is voiced by Anatoli Papanov in Russian and by Scott McNeil in the English-language version. * In the 1976 animated TV adaptation of \\"Mowgli's Brothers\\", all the male characters, including Shere Khan, are voiced by narrator Roddy McDowall. * In the 1989 Japanese anime television series Jungle Book Sh≈çnen Mowgli, Shere Khan is voiced by Shigez≈ç Sasaoka in Japanese, Jean Fontaine in the English dub, and Nana Patekar in the Hindi dub. Unlike in the literature, his crippled right-leg wasn't a birth-defect, but gained in a fight with the wolf Alexander, who was fathering Mowgli. Even so he is very accurate to Kipling's portrayal in a lot of ways (like the fact that he has Tabaqui as a sidekick), only crueler as he has violated many jungle-laws (which includes man-eating) and also shares his Disney version's fear of fire. * In the 2010 Indian computer animated TV series The Jungle Book, Shere Khan is voiced by David Holt. * A song titled \\"Shere Khan\\" appears on the 1997 debut album Music for Earthworms by underground rapper Aesop Rock. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Fictional tigers Category:Literary characters introduced in 1894 Category:Characters in British novels of the 19th century Category:Fictional nobility Category:Male film villains Category:Male literary villains Category:Male characters in literature Category:Male characters in animation Category:Fictional anthropophages ","title":"Shere Khan"},{"id":"522920","text":"Diagram of Foil Kite Foil kites are soft kites based on the design of the parafoil. They consist of a number of cells running fore to aft, some or all of which are open at the front to allow air to inflate the kite so it takes on an aerofoil section. Due to the amount of power that these kites can generate, they can be used for a variety of different activities including kitesurfing, kite landboarding, snowkiting, kite buggying, kite-energy systems or airborne wind energy, and recreational kiting. Foil kites are flown with various line set-ups that includes 2-, 3- and 4-line systems; 2-line systems consisting of rings, wrist bands or bar compared to depowerable 4-line systems using a bar or handles. (See also: kite control systems) In order to make them suitable for use on water some foils have limited air inlets in the centre of the leading edge, with valves to keep the air in and (hopefully) the water out. Internal holes in the cell sides allow the whole kite to inflate. These kites are naturally slower to inflate than an open-fronted foil. Foils are the most efficient of the power kites. The aerofoil section means that they can still provide significant lift when parked overhead, unlike leading edge inflatable kites. ==Development and history of foil kites== One of the first popular foil-based kites was the development of a two-line power kite by Ray Merry and Andrew Jones in the early 1970s in England Flexifoil History which became known as the Flexifoil (and later the Flexifoil company). Merry and Jones also experimented with kite pulled vehicles,Early Kite Buggy a concept which was further developed by Peter Lynn and popular today in its current form as kite buggying. The Flexifoil kite, still sold today as a 'Stacker' has a solid carbon spar in its leading edge to maintain its shape as it flies. The second- generation two-line parafoil was called the Sparless Stunter, designed by Ted Dougherty. Development began mid-1985 and was available for sale in mid-1988. These parafoil kites were square in shape and had 6 cells. In September 1988 a 460-square-foot (43 m¬≤) version was flown at the Ocean City Sunfest breaking the record for the World's Largest Stunt kite. In January 1989 the Sparless Stunter was introduced at the KTA show as the first totally sparless parafoil stunt kite. The Sparless Stunter saw a very brief history as kite technology evolved by May 1990 the first version of the original Quadrifoil was flown in competition at Wildwood, NJ. The first Quadrifoil was essentially two Sparless Stunters sewn together with a swept back shape. Later generations were refined into the widely known ‚Äúclassic.‚Äù Peter Lynn introduced a similar foil-based kite in 1991 for kite traction with the Peter Lynn PeelPeel History ‚Äì this was a completely soft foil kite without any spars. The Peel was a popular kite traction kite in the early to mid-1990s and continued to sell into the late 1990s and was sold in sizes up to 10m¬≤. The Peel was also a two-line kite flown in the same style as the Flexifoil. The next evolution on the foil kites for traction activities was the development of the 4-line foil kite. While 2-line kites require sometimes significant push and pull arm movement to fly (especially true the larger the kite), the development of the 4-line kite required less arm movement. 4-line kites are flown with two lines on each handle: a top line (or power line), and a bottom line (or brake line). 4-line kites can still be flown with push and pull arm movement, but if the bottom brake line is pulled in the bottom edge of the kite stalls and will cause the kite to turn on that bottom edge. This results in tighter turns with less arm movement ‚Äì this is important if sitting in a kite buggy. One of the first available 4-line kites was the Quadrifoil, designed by Ted Dougherty, popular as a buggy kite in the mid-1990s. The Quadrifoil in its original design became known as the 'Classic' ‚Äì the kite was rectangular in shape in contrast to today's more elliptical designs. Later evolutions of the kite were sold as the Competition (more elliptical in design ‚Äì C1, C3), Q2000 range, and lastly the Competition X range (XXS, XS, XM, XL and the XXL). Although these were sold under the Quadrifoil brand-name by Active People, none of these were designed by Dougherty himself. Dougherty's next kite after the Quadrifoil was the QuadTrac built and sold by Skynasaur in the USBuggy Newz 2.3 in the mid-1990s. Following the success of the Quadrifoil, Ray Merry (of Flexifoil fame) designed the Skytiger range of 4-line kites that was the dominant 4-line traction kite of the mid to late 1990s. This too was a rectangular design and a very solid and stable flying kite. The design was refined for more pull with the introduction of the 'Hi' series with an increased aspect ratio (wing). Commonly available were the Hi-22, Hi-40 (3.7 metre) and the Hi-60 (5.6 metre). A Hi-80 and Hi-100 were also available although not commonly seen. The 'Hi' series was available in regular ripstop nylon, or also available made from 'Icarex', a lightweight polyester material that allowed the kites to fly in much lower winds. In Europe in the late 1990s the kite buggy scene was becoming popular and there were a large number of traction kite designs from a large number of European companies. The designs took two different directions ‚Äì those that were steady and reliable in most winds and typically resistant to 'luffing' in gusty or unreliable winds, and those that were tuned to produce maximum pull at the cost of stability (known as 'race kites'). In the UK in the late 1990s, the 'Predator' kite designed by Peter Mirkovic of Sky KitesAEOLIAN.CO.UK ‚Äì Misc ‚Äì Kite Shops ‚Äì Shop Profile: Sky Kites was the most popular and successful traction kite amongst people competing in buggy races, winning the majority of races at this time.AchievementsAEOLIAN.CO.UK ‚Äì Misc ‚Äì Features ‚Äì Mark Kingshott By late 1990s/early 2000s a number of new companies entered the traction kite market that had prior experience with development of paragliders, and used this knowledge and experience for the development of traction kites. == See also == *Bow kite *Kite *Stunt kite *Kite surfing *Kite landboarding *Kite buggying *LEI kite *Arc kite *Parafoil *Power kite *Windsports *Kite types *Kite mooring *Kite applications == References == *Parafoil kites at the Virtual Kite Zoo. ==External links== * Nautikites Blog (http://www.nautikites.net/blog/index.php?entry=entry091117-182426) ‚Äì The compared evolution of kitesurfing and other great air & water sports. * Extreme Kites (www.ExtremeKites.com.au) ‚Äì Leading Power Kite Information Portal, Forums, Videos, Reviews, News and Galleries.

It is supported by the Apache Software Foundation and is released under the Apache Software License. Lucene has been ported to other programming languages including Object Pascal, Perl, C#, C++, Python, Ruby and PHP. ==History== Doug Cutting originally wrote Lucene in 1999.KeywordAnalyzer Lucene was his fifth search engine, having previously written two while at Xerox PARC, one at Apple, and a fourth at Excite. It was initially available for download from its home at the SourceForge web site. It joined the Apache Software Foundation's Jakarta family of open-source Java products in September 2001 and became its own top- level Apache project in February 2005. The name Lucene is Doug Cutting's wife's middle name and her maternal grandmother's first name. Lucene formerly included a number of sub-projects, such as Lucene.NET, Mahout, Tika and Nutch. These three are now independent top-level projects. In March 2010, the Apache Solr search server joined as a Lucene sub-project, merging the developer communities. Version 4.0 was released on October 12, 2012. ==Features and common use== While suitable for any application that requires full text indexing and searching capability, Lucene is recognized for its utility in the implementation of Internet search engines and local, single-site searching. Lucene includes a feature to perform a fuzzy search based on edit distance. Lucene has also been used to implement recommendation systems.J. Beel, S. Langer, and B.

Changes in the cost of living over time are often operationalized in a cost-of-living index. Cost of living calculations are also used to compare the cost of maintaining a certain standard of living in different geographic areas. Differences in cost of living between locations can also be measured in terms of purchasing power parity rates. ==Cost-of-living adjustment (COLA)== Employment contracts and pension benefits can be tied to a cost-of-living index, typically to the consumer price index (CPI). A COLA adjusts salaries based on changes in a cost-of-living index. Salaries are typically adjusted annually. They may also be tied to a cost-of-living index that varies by geographic location if the employee moves. In this later case, the expatriate employee will likely see only the discretionary income part of their salary indexed by a differential CPI between the new and old employment locations, leaving the non- discretionary part of the salary (e.g., mortgage payments, insurance, car payments) unmodified. Annual escalation clauses in employment contracts can specify retroactive or future percentage increases in worker pay which are not tied to any index. These negotiated increases in pay are colloquially referred to as cost-of-living adjustments or cost-of-living increases because of their similarity to increases tied to externally determined indexes. Cost-of-living allowance is equal to the nominal interest minus the real interest rate. == Consumer Price Index (CPI) == When cost-of-living adjustments, negotiated wage settlements and budgetary increases exceed CPI, media reports frequently compare the two without consideration of the pertinent tax code. However, CPI is based on the retail pricing of a basket of goods and services. Most purchases of that same basket require the use of after-tax dollars‚Äîdollars that were often subject to the highest marginal tax rate. Consequently, the COLA will necessarily have to exceed the CPI inflation rate to maintain purchasing power. The widely recognized problem known as bracket-creep can also occur in countries where the marginal tax brackets themselves are not indexed ‚Äî COLA increases simply place more dollars into higher tax rate brackets. (Only under a flat tax system would a percentage gain on gross income translate into a comparable inflation-offsetting gain at the after-tax level.) Some salaries and pensions in the United States with a COLA (they vary by type) include: * Social Security * Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) * Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) Pensions in Canada with a COLA include: * Canadian Auto Workers union (CAW) Local 200 (Ontario) == Social Security benefits United States=== For 2018, the Social Security cost- of-living adjustment (\\"COLA\\") is 2.0% (a significant increase over the 0.3% figure used for 2017). The maximum Supplemental Security Income (\\"SSI\\") benefit will go from $735 to $750, while the maximum SSI payment for a couple will go from $1,103 to $1,125. The estimated average monthly benefit for a disabled person will increase from $1,173 to $1,197. The estimated average monthly benefit for a retired person will increase from $1,377 to $1,404. The presumptive Substantial Gainful Activity (‚ÄúSGA‚Äù) threshold will increase from $1,170 to $1,180 for non-blind individuals, but from $1,950 to $1,970 for blind individuals. The Trial Work Period (‚ÄúTWP‚Äù) monthly amount will increase from $840 to $850. The amount of earnings needed for a worker to obtain a ‚Äúquarter of coverage‚Äù or ‚Äúcredit‚Äù will increase from $1,300 to $1,320. Maximum taxable earnings under the Social Security OASDI program will go from $127,200 to $128,700. In 2019, Social Security benefits increased by 2.8 percent the largest cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in seven years. ==Worldwide Cost of Living Survey== The Economist Intelligence Unit produces a semi-annual (twice yearly) worldwide cost of living survey that compares more than 400 individual prices across 160 products and services. They include food, drink, clothing, household supplies and personal care items, home rents, transport, utility bills, private schools, domestic help and recreational costs. The survey itself is an internet tool designed to calculate cost-of-living allowances and build compensation packages for corporate executives maintaining a western lifestyle. The survey incorporates easy-to-understand comparative cost of living indices between cities. The survey allows city-to-city comparisons, but for the purpose of this report all cities are compared to a base city of New York City, which has an index set at 100. The survey has been carried out for more than 30 years. The most recent survey was published in March 2017. Singapore remains the most expensive city in the world for the fourth year running, in a rare occurrence where the entire top five most expensive cities were unchanged from the year prior. Sydney and Melbourne have both cemented their positions as top-ten staples, with Sydney becoming the fifth most expensive, and Melbourne becoming the sixth. Asia is home to more than five most expensive cities in the top twenty but also home to eight cheapest cities of the cheapest ten. ==Other uses == Stipends or extra pay provided to employees who are being temporarily relocated may also be called cost-of- living adjustments or cost-of-living allowances. Such adjustments are intended to offset changes in welfare due to geographic differences in the cost of living. Such adjustments might more accurately be described as a per diem allowance or tied to a specific item, as with housing allowances. Employees who are being permanently relocated are less likely to receive such allowances, but may receive a base salary adjustment to reflect local market conditions. A cost-of-living allowance is frequently given to members of the U.S. military stationed at overseas bases if the area to which a service member is assigned has a higher cost of living than the average area in the United States. For example, service members stationed in Japan receive a cost of living allowance of between $300 and $700 per month (depending on pay grade, years of service, and number of dependents), in addition to their base pay. This additional pay is non-taxable. ==See also== * ACCRA Cost of Living Index * United States Consumer Price Index * Consumer Price Index * Inflation * Price index * Cost of Living Allowance (U.S. Military) Specific: * List of most expensive cities for expatriate employees * Middle class squeeze * Cost of raising a child * Walk to work protest ==References== ==External links== * Economist Intelligence Unit worldwide cost of living survey results (requires registration) * Cost-of-Living Calculator relative to time from American Institute for Economic Research (AIER) * US Consumer Price Index FAQ * Expatistan a crowd sourced comparison site Category:Personal finance ","title":"Cost of living"},{"id":"522938","text":"In cryptography, a ciphertext-only attack (COA) or known ciphertext attack is an attack model for cryptanalysis where the attacker is assumed to have access only to a set of ciphertexts. While the attacker has no channel providing access to the plaintext prior to encryption, in all practical ciphertext-only attacks, the attacker still has some knowledge of the plaintext. For instance, the attacker might know the language in which the plaintext is written or the expected statistical distribution of characters in the plaintext. Standard protocol data and messages are commonly part of the plaintext in many deployed systems and can usually be guessed or known efficiently as part of a ciphertext-only attack on these systems. ==Attack== The attack is completely successful if the corresponding plaintexts can be deduced, or even better, the key. The ability to obtain any information at all about the underlying plaintext beyond what was pre-known to the attacker is still considered a success. For example, if an adversary is sending ciphertext continuously to maintain traffic-flow security, it would be very useful to be able to distinguish real messages from nulls. Even making an informed guess of the existence of real messages would facilitate traffic analysis. In the history of cryptography, early ciphers, implemented using pen-and-paper, were routinely broken using ciphertexts alone. Cryptographers developed statistical techniques for attacking ciphertext, such as frequency analysis. Mechanical encryption devices such as Enigma made these attacks much more difficult (although, historically, Polish cryptographers were able to mount a successful ciphertext-only cryptanalysis of the Enigma by exploiting an insecure protocol for indicating the message settings). More advanced ciphertext-only attacks on the Enigma were mounted in Bletchley Park during World War II, by intelligently guessing plaintexts corresponding to intercepted ciphertexts. ==Modern== Every modern cipher attempts to provide protection against ciphertext-only attacks. The vetting process for a new cipher design standard usually takes many years and includes exhaustive testing of large quantities of ciphertext for any statistical departure from random noise. See: Advanced Encryption Standard process. Also, the field of steganography evolved, in part, to develop methods like mimic functions that allow one piece of data to adopt the statistical profile of another. Nonetheless poor cipher usage or reliance on home-grown proprietary algorithms that have not been subject to thorough scrutiny has resulted in many computer-age encryption systems that are still subject to ciphertext-only attack. Examples include: ===Examples=== *Early versions of Microsoft's PPTP virtual private network software used the same RC4 key for the sender and the receiver (later versions had other problems). In any case where a stream cipher like RC4 is used twice with the same key it is open to ciphertext-only attack. See: stream cipher attack * Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), the first security protocol for Wi-Fi, proved vulnerable to several attacks, most of them ciphertext-only. * GSM's A5/1 and A5/2 * Some modern cipher designs have later been shown to be vulnerable to ciphertext-only attacks. For example, Akelarre. * A cipher whose key space is too small is subject to brute force attack with access to nothing but ciphertext by simply trying all possible keys. All that is needed is some way to distinguish valid plaintext from random noise, which is easily done for natural languages when the ciphertext is longer than the unicity distance. One example is DES, which only has 56-bit keys. All too common current examples are commercial security products that derive keys for otherwise impregnable ciphers like AES from a user-selected password. Since users rarely employ passwords with anything close to the entropy of the cipher's key space, such systems are often quite easy to break in practice using only ciphertext. The 40-bit CSS cipher used to encrypt DVD video discs can always be broken with this method, as all that is needed is to look for MPEG-2 video data. ==References== * Alex Biryukov and Eyal Kushilevitz, From Differential Cryptanalysis to Ciphertext-Only Attacks, CRYPTO 1998, pp72-88; Category:Cryptographic attacks ","title":"Ciphertext-only attack"},{"id":"522940","text":"George Isaac Smith, MBE (April 6, 1909 - December 19, 1982), usually referred to as G.I.

It is useful as a power or traction kite. These kites are flown using 2, 4 or 5 control lines and a bar. (See also: kite control systems) A LEI is a great kite for water use because the inflated bladders cause it to float on the water surface. A LEI can sit on the water for an indefinite time and still be relaunched because, unlike a foil kite, there are no chambers that can fill with water. Generally used for kitesurfing and kiteboarding, leading edge inflatable kites come in many different sizes, most commonly from 5 to 18 square metres. Based on their design Leading Edge Inflatable kites can be broken down into four categories: C-kites, hybrid kites, delta kites, and bow kites. ==C-kites== C-kites are the oldest style of LEI used for traction kiting. They typically come with four lines, and some have the option of an additional 5th line for safety and easy relaunching. The main difference between C-kites and other LEI styles is that they do not have any lines that support the leading edge of the kite (called bridles). The lines on a C-kite attach to the four corners of the kite. Hybrid kites, together with bow kites and later delta kites are all subtypes of a SLE-kite (Supported Leading Edge), defined by having a bridle which supports the leading edge. C-kites are the preferred kite of wake-style kiteboarders. ==SLE sub-typesBow kites=== All of the Bow kite's advantages are because of its concave trailing edge. This design feature changes the shape of the kite's trailing edge as it flies, requiring that the leading edge flatten to match, resulting in a much flatter looking kite. The bridles on the kite restrict the leading edge and hold it in line with the rest of the kite. In addition, the concave trailing edge enables the kite to be sheeted out further than a traditional C- kite, which is why a Bow kite can be nearly 100% depowered. The inflatable and bow kite designs were invented by Dominique and Bruno Legaignoux. ===Hybrid kites=== Hybrid kites are a cross between C-kites and bow kites. Like bow kites, they incorporate bridles to support their leading edge. These bridles support the kite and enable designers to experiment with different arc profiles - some Hybrids can have a very flat arc, while some can look similar to a C-kite. Individual characteristics of the Hybrid kites vary depending on how similar they represent one of the other two kite styles. The defining difference between a Hybrid and Bow kite is the shape of the trailing edge. The trailing edge on a Hybrid kite is convex, whereas that of a Bow is concave. ===Delta kites=== Delta kites are a refinement of the hybrid design. Their shape (when flattened out) is more triangular, which places more of the kite's canopy in the middle. This increases the amount of \\"projected area\\" that is exposed to the wind, resulting in more power. These kites still use a bridle (though it's often extremely simplified), and so could still be called SLE kites. (They are often called C-shaped, but they are not C-kites as they are traditionally known.) Delta C-kites are a new breed of hybrid which combines the high-performance of a C-kite with the depowerable fast-turning triangular Delta kites. ==See also== * List of inflatable manufactured goods ==References== Category:Kites Category:Kitesurfing Category:Inflatable manufactured goods ","title":"Leading edge inflatable kite"},{"id":"522949","text":"Robert Dunkerson Orr (November 17, 1917 ‚Äì March 10, 2004) was an American politician and diplomat who served as the 45th Governor of Indiana from 1981 to 1989. He was a member of the Republican Party. ==Early life== Robert D. Orr was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where his family was vacationing, on November 17, 1917, the last of the three children of Samuel Lowery and Louise Dunkerson Orr. His father was an industrialist with interests in many companies whose holdings were centralized in the Orr Iron Company. Orr grew up in Evansville, Indiana where his father's company was headquartered. His family have lived in the area for three generations.Gugin, p. 368 He attended local public schools for most of his early education, but transferred to the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut before his final year of high school beginning in 1934. Upon graduation he was accepted to Yale University, enrolling in 1936. At Yale he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Phi chapter). He earned a bachelor's degree in 1940 and then enrolled in Harvard Business School.Gugin, p. 369 After the outbreak of World War II, he left Harvard without graduating to join the Army. He was admitted to Officer's Candidate School and after completing his course served on the staff of the quartermaster's general staff in the Pacific Theater, eventually rising to the rank of major. For his service, he was awarded the Legion of Merit. He met Joanne \\"Josie\\" Wallace who served in the Women's Air Force Service Pilots, while he was serving. They were married in 1944, settled in Evansville, and eventually had three children. After returning home, Orr entered into the family business, and became active in Republican politics of Vanderburgh County. Many Evansville factories had been creating war implements, and the end of the conflict led many of them to close. Orr began purchasing vacated factories, refurbishing them to produce goods, and selling them. Through his activity he became involved in a local economic development committee. His business and holdings expanded rapidly and by 1953 he was on the board of twenty local businesses including Erie Investments, Sterling Brewers, and Grand Junction, and was director of twelve other companies. He was on several civic boards including the Rotary Club, Evansville YMCA, Willard Library, Buffalo Trace Council of Boy Scouts of America, and the Presbyterian Church of Evansville. Because of his community service, he was awarded the Jaycees Young Man of the Year award in 1953. As a result of the award, he was invited to serve as a trustee of Hanover College, a position he held for decades.Gugin, p. 370 ==Political career== President Gerald Ford in 1976 President Ronald Reagan in 1982 Orr first became involved in politics in 1950 as a member of a local Republican Party advisory board. In 1951 he became chairman of the local party; he served until 1954. He was a precinct committeeman for eight years, and in 1958 became treasurer for the Eight District Republican Committee, a position he held until 1960. In 1965 he was elected chairman of the Vanderburg County Republican Central Committee; he held that position for six years. In 1968 he was elected to the Indiana Senate representing Evansville. He served there until 1973. In 1972, he was nominated at the State Republican Convention to run for Lieutenant Governor on a ticket with Otis R. Bowen. The election campaign focused largely on their opponents' records of raising taxes, and they won the election with 56.8 percent of the vote. As lieutenant governor, Orr oversaw the state agricultural bureau and was director of the Indiana Department of Commerce. Orr drew on his experience in economic development in Evansville to put in a place a statewide economic growth plan. He convinced state leaders to fund the creation of two Port of Indiana ports on the Ohio River, one at Mount Vernon and other at Jeffersonville, and he launched a successful tourist attraction campaign. Orr vote five tie breaking votes in the Indiana Senate during his term, including one that passed Bowen's tax reorganization plan, drastically lowering property taxes, requiring local taxing authorities to receive state level approval to raise taxes, while increasing the state sales tax. Orr and Bowen were reelected to office in 1976.Gugin, p. 371 Orr was popular statewide because of his economic plans and for being associated with the tax reorganization plan. With Bowen's backing, he ran unopposed for the Republican nomination to run for governor in 1980. In the general election he was opposed by Democrat John Hillenbrand. Orr focused on connecting himself with the popular Governor Bowen; his slogan was \\"Let's Keep a Good Thing Going.\\" He easily defeated Hillenbrand, 1,257,383 (57.7 percent) to 913,116 (41.9 percent) votes. As governor he oversaw the reform of the Indiana educational system. In 1984, he defeated State Senator Wayne Townsend of Hartford City to win a second term as governor: 1,146,497 (52.8 percent of the two-party vote) to 1,036,832 (47.2 percent). An ad from the 1984 campaign, which featured an actress playing a fortune teller and a singer with a Daryl Hall style mullet, was featured on an episode of CNN's Not Just Another Cable News Show. In the 1984 election, Orr polled 110,886 fewer votes than he had in 1980, and his overall percent dropped by 4.9.Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections, 2005 edition In 1986, Orr served as president of the Council of State Governments and as the chairman of the Midwestern Governors Association. After his terms as governor, Orr was named by U.S. President George H. W. Bush as the U.S. Ambassador to Singapore, a position that he held until 1992. After he left his ambassadorship, Orr established a consulting firm called the Alliance for Global Commerce, which focused on international trade and export issues. In 2000, his wife, Joanne \\"Josie\\" Wallace, requested that he divorce her because she was suffering from dementia. She wanted her husband to be happy in his last years instead of watching his wife slowly die. In 2001, at the age of eighty-three, he married Mary Kay Davis. On March 10, 2004, Orr died at the age of eighty-six at the Indiana University Medical Center in Indianapolis from complications following kidney surgery. He is buried in Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis. The portion of Interstate 69 south of its interchange with Interstate 64, at one time labeled Interstate 164, is named the \\"Robert D. Orr Highway\\" in his honor. ==Electoral history== ==See also== *List of Governors of Indiana *Robert D.

Most of his works are in the shi form, but they are much freer in content than those of the Tang dynasty. His response to the impossibility of surpassing the Tang poets was to make a virtue of his lack of ambition; his ideal was Âπ≥Ê∑° (pingdan), or the pedestrian. His early verses are often socio-critical, advocating reform along Neo-Confucian lines; later he turned to celebrations of ordinary life and verses mourning the deaths of his first wife and several of his children.

Husting, Wisconsin Historical Society == Background and early career == Husting was born April 25, 1866 in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. His father, John P. Husting, had emigrated from the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg to the United States in 1855. His mother, Mary M. Husting, n√©e Juneau, was the fourth youngest of sixteen children born to Solomon Juneau, co-founder and first mayor of Milwaukee. Husting moved with his parents to Mayville, Wisconsin, in 1876, where he received a common school education. From the age of 17 years, he became successively a retail clerk in a general store, a railway postal clerk, a mailing clerk in the Wisconsin State Prison at Waupun, and assistant bookkeeper in the office of the Secretary of State of Wisconsin under Thomas J. Cunningham (also a Democrat). Husting entered the University of Wisconsin Law School, passed the state bar examination, and was admitted to the bar in 1895. He initially practiced law in Mayville by himself, but in 1897 associated himself with C. W. Lamoreux until the latter was elected judge, upon which the firm of Husting & Brother was formed. == Public office == Husting was elected district attorney of Dodge County in 1902 and reelected in 1904. He was elected to the state senate in 1906, and reelected in 1910. In the state senate, he advocated conservation of the state's natural resources, the income tax, the \\"Husting bill\\" establishing a maximum passenger railroad fare of two cents per mile, initiative and referendum, and direct election of United States senators. He offered the original resolution to investigate, and assisted in the investigation of, the Wisconsin primary and election of 1908, which resulted in the enactment of the state's Corrupt Practices Act. Husting was the first United States senator from Wisconsin to be elected by a direct vote of the people, defeating ex- Governor Francis E. McGovern at the November, 1914, election by 967 votes. He succeeded Isaac Stephenson as United States senator on March 4, 1915, and served in the Senate from 1915 until his death.The Wisconsin blue book, 1917 Madison: Democrat Printing Co., State Printer, 1917; p. 495 He was chairman of the Committee on Fisheries during 1917 and chairman of a special committee investigating trespasses on Indian lands during his entire time in the Senate. == Death and political consequences == Husting was killed in a duck hunting accident on Rush Lake near Pickett, Wisconsin while rising in a row boat after telling his brother Gustave to fire. Gustave shot his brother accidentally in the back. Husting fell into a coma and died later in the day. The New York Times described him as \\"the most aggressive leader\\" of the \\"loyalist\\" (i.e., supportive of Woodrow Wilson's pro-Allied policies) forces in Wisconsin, and contrasted him with \\"Senator La Follette and the pro-German constituency behind him\\".\\"Husting is Killed by Brother in Hunt\\" New York Times October 22, 1917 He is interred at the Graceland Cemetery in Mayville. Husting's death was of political importance. In 1919 the Senate would have been under Democratic control had he not been succeeded by Republican Irvine Lenroot, as a consequence of which in 1919 the Senate had 49 Republicans and 47 Democrats (Vice-President Thomas R. Marshall was a Democrat, and had the power to break all ties). ==See also== * List of United States Congress members who died in office (1900‚Äì49) ==References== *Paul Husting, late a senator from Wisconsin, Memorial addresses delivered in the House of Representatives and Senate frontispiece 1919 - - - Category:1866 births Category:1917 deaths Category:19th-century American politicians Category:Accidental deaths in Wisconsin Category:American people of French-Canadian descent Category:American people of Luxembourgian descent Category:Deaths by firearm in Wisconsin Category:Democratic Party United States senators Category:District attorneys in Wisconsin Category:Firearm accident victims in the United States Category:Hunting accident deaths Category:People from Mayville, Wisconsin Category:United States senators from Wisconsin Category:University of Wisconsin Law School alumni Category:Wisconsin Democrats Category:Wisconsin state senators Category:People from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin ","title":"Paul O.

In quantum mechanics, the Schr√∂dinger equation, which describes the continuous time evolution of a system's wave function, is deterministic. However, the relationship between a system's wave function and the observable properties of the system appears to be non-deterministic. ==In mathematics== The systems studied in chaos theory are deterministic. If the initial state were known exactly, then the future state of such a system could theoretically be predicted. However, in practice, knowledge about the future state is limited by the precision with which the initial state can be measured, and chaotic systems are characterized by a strong dependence on the initial conditions. This sensitivity to initial conditions can be measured with Lyapunov exponents. Markov chains and other random walks are not deterministic systems, because their development depends on random choices. ==In computer science== A deterministic model of computation, for example a deterministic Turing machine, is a model of computation such that the successive states of the machine and the operations to be performed are completely determined by the preceding state. A deterministic algorithm is an algorithm which, given a particular input, will always produce the same output, with the underlying machine always passing through the same sequence of states. There may be non- deterministic algorithms that run on a deterministic machine, for example, an algorithm that relies on random choices. Generally, for such random choices, one uses a pseudorandom number generator, but one may also use some external physical process, such as the last digits of the time given by the computer clock. A pseudorandom number generator is a deterministic algorithm, that is designed to produce sequences of numbers that behave as random sequences. A hardware random number generator, however, may be non-deterministic. ==Others== In economics, the Ramsey‚ÄìCass‚ÄìKoopmans model is deterministic. The stochastic equivalent is known as Real Business Cycle theory. == See also == * Deterministic system (philosophy) * Dynamical system * Scientific modelling * Statistical model * Stochastic process ==References== System Category:Dynamical systems ","title":"Deterministic system"},{"id":"522959","text":"The south-west corner drainage region of Western Australia is one of only two temperate and relatively fertile parts of mainland Australia.

According to Richie Unterberger of Allmusic, \\"The album is an average, perhaps somewhat below average, late-'60s hard rock recording. It looks forward to some facets of '70s metal and art rock in its overwrought vocals, tandem hard rock guitar riffs, and classical-influenced keyboards.\\" Rick Nielsen has nothing good to say about the Fuse album, stating \\"Tom Petersson and I were in a Midwest band called Fuse. The guys we were with were all rinky dinks; they‚Äôre probably pumping gas now. Tom and I had the stick-to- it-iveness and positive thinking to know what we wanted to do, so we split the band and went off to hang out in England.... That Fuse stuff stinks.

The producer was an idiot.\\" The other band members were not rinky dinks, far from it. Guitarist Craig Myers was a guitar prodigy, playing in bands since he was 12 or 13 years old. Drummer Chip Greenman was also universally respected amongst his peers, as was singer Joe Sundberg. In fact Craig, Chip and Tom Peterson were bandmates in Toastin Jam, the band Rick Nielsen essentially joined when he broke up the version of The Grim Reapers that was a cover band in order to pursue creating original music with the talented musicians in Toastin Jam. Jackie Mills produced quality psychedelic rock records with Kaleidoscope and The Floating Bridge before working with Fuse.

From its inception, the observatory has emphasized research, the development of technology and the training of students--both graduate and undergraduate. The initial FCRAO telescope was a customized low-frequency antenna to search for pulsars in the galaxy. The development of instrumentation within the FCRAO labs contributed to the discovery of the binary pulsar system PSR B1913+16 by Joseph Taylor and Russell Hulse, for which they received the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics.

The name Sydney Tower has become common in daily usage; however, the tower has been known as the Sydney Tower Eye, AMP Tower, Flower Tower, Glower Tower, Westfield Centrepoint Tower, Big Poke, Centrepoint Tower or just Centrepoint. The Sydney Tower is a member of the World Federation of Great Towers. The tower stands above the Sydney central business district (CBD), located on Market Street, between Pitt and Castlereagh Streets. It is accessible from the Pitt Street Mall, Market Street or Castlereagh Street and sits above the Westfield Sydney (formerly Centrepoint) shopping centre. The tower is open to the public, and is one of the most prominent tourist attractions in the city, being visible from a number of vantage points throughout town and from adjoining suburbs. Auckland's Sky Tower is taller but Sydney Tower's main observation deck is almost higher than the observation deck on Auckland's Sky Tower. While the shopping centre at the base of the tower is run by Scentre Group, the tower itself is occupied by Trippas White Group, which owns and operates Sydney Tower Dining, and Merlin Entertainments, which owns and operates the \\"Sydney Tower Eye\\" observation deck and \\"Oztrek\\" simulated ride attraction. ==History== Designed by Australian architect Donald Crone, the first plans for Sydney Tower were unveiled in March 1968. Construction of the office building commenced in 1970, and tower construction began in 1975. Prior to construction of the tower, the height limit in Sydney had been set at , to allow for the harbour's flying boats that were popular before the modern jet era. Public access to the tower began in August 1981.Sydney Tower (from the Sydney Tower/Oztrek website. Accessed 21 June 2008.) The total cost of construction was A$36 million. In 1998, the addition of a lightning rod to the top of spire extended the tower's overall height from 305 m to , which is above sea level. While AMP managed the Centrepoint shopping centre, the tower was officially referred to as \\"AMP Tower\\". After the Westfield Group took over ownership of Centrepoint in December 2001, the name was changed to Sydney Tower.Westfield Group Limited. Westfield Centrepoint (from the Westfield Group website. Accessed on 2 March 2008.) In 2009, the base building was closed and stripped for a major refurbishment. This involved the connection of the shopping centre to other arcades and a complete upgrade of all the sites. The shopping centre was progressively reopened from 2010 and was renamed Westfield Sydney. On 25‚Äì26 June 2011 the \\"AMP\\" banner was removed from the tower and replaced by a large illuminated \\"Westfield\\" logo. This was achieved by helicopter after two previous attempts on 22 May and 12 June were aborted due to bad weather. In 2011, Merlin Entertainments acquired the rights to operate the observation deck tower and its name was changed to the Sydney Tower Eye. ==StructureSections=== Four sections of the tower are open to the public, three being occupied by Sydney Tower Dining. 360 Bar and Dining, which offers revolving views of the Sydney skyline, is located on level one of the Sydney Tower. Sydney Tower Buffet, a contemporary self-select restaurant, is on the tower's second level. STUDIO, located on level three can cater for cocktail functions for 200 people and 156 sit-down guests. The observation deck, currently called the Sydney Tower Eye, is located on level four of Sydney Tower. To access this level, visitors can buy a pass from the operating company or at the gate. The pass allows access to other Sydney attractions including Wild Life Sydney and the Sydney Aquarium. The Sydney Tower Eye is located above ground level. It has a fully enclosed viewing platform featuring 360-degree views of the city and surrounding areas. This floor also houses a small gift shop, multilingual touchscreens and a readout that displays data about the wind speed, direction, sway amplitude, and other statistics of the tower. On 23 September 2011, a 4D cinema was opened on the fourth floor of the arcade, playing a film with footage from various locations in Sydney. The theatre is the first of its kind in Australia; in-theatre effects include wind, bubbles, and fire. Skywalk is an open-air glass-floored platform encircling the Sydney Tower Eye at a height of above ground level. The viewing platform extends over the edge of the main structure of the deck. It was opened on 18 October 2005, cost A$3.75 million to construct, took four years to design and two months to build. This platform is only accessible as part of planned and booked tours. ===Details=== The golden turret near the top of the tower has a maximum capacity of 960 people. Travel to the observation deck is by three high speed double-deck lifts, each with a capacity of 8 to 10 people. The lifts travel at full, half or quarter speed, depending on wind conditions. At full speed the lifts reach the deck in 45 seconds. ==Cultural events== Leading up to the Sydney 2000 Olympics, the tower was decorated with sculptures by Australian artist Dominique Sutton (an athlete rising from starting blocks, a gymnast performing a handstand, and a wheelchair basketball player passing the ball) which were positioned above the main body of the tower and in some cases overhung the edges. These sculptures were removed in 2003 and relocated to Sydney Olympic Park at Homebush. (Updated 11 January 2016). The figures were placed atop the tower using an S-64 Aircrane heavy lift helicopter known as \\"Elvis\\". On several occasions, the tower has been used to launch fireworks or it has been illuminated with coloured lights as part of various celebrations in Sydney, such as New Year's Eve or during the Olympics in 2000. Each year the Sydney Tower Stair Challenge comprises the challenge of running up 1,504 stairs from Pitt Street Mall to the Observation Deck.Sydney Tower Run Up (from the 'Supersprint' website) The event is to raise money for the Cancer Council, and the two winners become eligible to compete in the Empire State Building Run-up. However, the event was cancelled in both 2011 and 2012. ==Incidents== On 8 March 2018, the Skywalk was closed for five weeks following the suicide of a 21-year-old woman who removed her safety harness and leapt from the tower while on a tour. The Skywalk reopened on 12 April 2018, after conducting a probe into the incident and the tower having upgraded the safety equipment.

A CGI simulation of the tower was used when it became a weapon for the main villain, Ivan Ooze in the film's climatic battle. * The tower is destroyed in the films Godzilla: Final Wars and Supernova. ==Gallery== File:The Westfield Centrepoint Tower (6619289471).jpgThe turret of the tower, with current Westfield branding File:Speaker's adventure - Sydney Tower.jpgExternal bracing on the tower File:Sydney tower sunset.jpgThe tower at sunset File:(1)Market Street Sydney.jpgThe Sydney Tower seen from Market Street, 1985 File:Sydney Tower view from Pitt St mall - panoramio.jpgSydney Tower from Pitt Street File:Sydney Tower Revolving Restauarant.jpgRevolving restaurant ==See also== * List of tallest towers in the world * Hyperboloid structure ** List of hyperboloid structures ==References== == Further reading == * Saiful H.

It is a spinoff of an earlier film by the same name, also directed by Zalman King. Most episodes were directed by either Zalman King, Rafael Eisenman or both. The story-lines usually have a thin plot revolving around some intrigue and the sexual awakening of a girl or woman who often also narrates. Sensuous love scenes with nudity as well as sultry, moody music are characteristic for most episodes. There is no story arc or characters connecting the different stories other than Jake Winters introducing each episode. ==Synopsis== The tested episodes always open with a quick montage of a newspaper personals section ad under \\"Red Shoes\\" seeking women to mail in their personal diaries with stories of love, passion and/or betrayal. The presenter and host Jake Winters (David Duchovny) is then shown walking on desolate train tracks with his dog Stella. He begins reading a letter from his post office box out loud that begins with \\"Dear Red Shoes...\\" He first took out the ad after the suicide of his fianc√©e, and his subsequent confrontation of the man with whom she was having an affair, a construction worker and shoe salesman who sold her a pair of red high heels, inspiring the ad. He placed the ad in the newspaper in an effort to understand why it happened and learn his fianc√©e's reasons for killing herself through the stories of women in similar situations. ==Syndication== Red Shoe Diaries episodes were running on the Canadian television channel Showcase, early Saturday morning, as of August 2010. From time to time, episodes can also be viewed on Showtime. A few episodes can be viewed on Amazon Video or hulu.com. This show is also on Tubi. ==Episodes listSeason 1=== #\\"Safe Sex\\"; Guest Stars: Steven Bauer, Joan Severance, John Toles-Bey #\\"Double Dare\\"; Guest Stars: Laura Johnson, Scott Lawrence, Sarah Luck Pearson, Arnold Vosloo, Michael Woods #\\"You Have the Right to Remain Silent\\"; Guest Stars: David Duchovny, Pat Banta, Denise Crosby, Robert Knepper #\\"Talk to Me Baby\\"; Guest Stars: Ely Pouget, Kim Burnette, Lydie Denier, Annabelle Gurwitch, Lynn Speier, Peter Spellos, Richard Tyson #\\"Just Like That\\"; Guest Stars: Ely Pouget, Carl Gilliard, Tch√©ky Karyo, Matt LeBlanc, Victoria Mahoney, Renata Scott, Nina Siemaszko #\\"Another Woman's Lipstick\\"; Guest Stars: Ely Pouget, Maryam d'Abo, √Ångel Ferreira, Christina Fulton, Miranda Garrison, Annabelle Gurwitch, Kevin Haley #\\"Auto Erotica\\"; Guest Stars: Ely Pouget, Nick Chinlund, Caitlin Dulany, Kenny Johnson #\\"Jake's Story\\"; Guest Stars: David Duchovny, Ely Pouget, William Paul Burns, Angela Cornell, Audie England, Sheryl Lee, Frederick Washburn #\\"Accidents Happen\\" a.k.a. \\"The Fling\\"; Guest Stars: Ely Pouget, Marina Giulia Cavalli, David Duchovny, Scott Plank, Ally Sheedy #\\"The Bounty Hunter\\"; Guest Stars: David Duchovny, Ely Pouget, Sue Kiel, Nicholas Love, Ron Marquette, Dee McCafferty, Claire Stansfield #\\"Weekend Pass\\"; Guest Stars: Anthony Addabbo, Shashawnee Hall, Ely Pouget #\\"Double or Nothing\\"; Guest Stars: Ely Pouget, Paula Barbieri, Francesco Quinn, Lisa Boyle #\\"How I Met My Husband\\"; Guest Stars: Ely Pouget, Luigi Amodeo, Alex Ardenti, Jennifer Burton, Neith Hunter, Sue Kiel, Andrea Riave, Lucas David Castillo Acosta ===Season 2=== #\\"Midnight Bells\\"; Guest Stars: Luc Leestemaker, Charlotte Lewis, Carsten Norgaard #\\"Naked in the Moonlight\\"; Guest Stars: Rudy de Rooy, John Enos III, California Ralph, Raven Snow #\\"Runway\\"; Guest Stars: Darienne Arnold, Daniel Anibal Blasco, Jennifer Burton, James DeAngelo, Lorna Firman, Krista Heitkamp, Udo Kier, Ena La Van, Tiffany Lawrence, Deborah Lin, Andrea Riave, Amber Smith, Frederick Washburn #\\"Kidnap\\"; Guest Stars: Randall Boffman, Jennifer Ciesar, Matt LeBlanc, Robert Mailhouse, Ron Marquette, Dee McCafferty, Robert Peters, Hartley Silver #\\"Burning Up\\"; Guest Stars: Rhonda Aldrich, Ivan Allen, Avalon Anders, Jennifer Burton, Anthony Guidera, Alexandra Tydings, Mark Zuelke #\\"Night of Abandon\\"; Guest Stars: Catalina Bonakie, Ann Cockburn, Daniel Leza #\\"Liar's Tale\\"; Guest Stars: Erika Anderson, Audie England, Lorna Firman, Margaret Makinen, Peter Quartaroli, Terrence Sheahan, Paula Venice #\\"In the Blink of an Eye\\"; Guest Stars: Richard Dieux, Brian Edwards, Julien Maurel, Philippe Nahon, Laurie Simpson, Dominique Valera #\\"Hotline\\"; Guest Stars: Don Bloomfield, Mar√≠a Celedonio, Margaret Cho, Audie England, George Pilgrim, Wendy Schaal, Judy Toll #\\"Love at First Sight\\"; Guest Stars: Anthony Addabbo, Eric James, Denice D.

These divisions are known as the three states of the Church, especially within Catholic ecclesiology. In systems of theology which reject the doctrine of Purgatory, such as Lutheranism, and most other Protestant denominations, the Churches Militant and Triumphant are together known as the two states of the Church. These divisions are often discussed in the context of the doctrine of the communion of saints; although Christians may be physically separated from each other by the barrier of death, they nonetheless remain united to each other in one Church, and support each other in prayer. == Etymology  Militant === The term militant () has a primary meaning of \\"being a soldier, performing military service\\", but it acquired a secondary meaning of \\"serving, performing service, laboring\\", with its root ' coming to mean \\"soldier of Christ or God\\" in Medieval Latin usage. The members of the Church Militant, i.e. those Christians on earth, are engaged in spiritual warfare against sin Failing that directly, those who believe in the existence of Purgatory hope to die in a state of grace and join the Church Penitent, to purify themselves of their imperfections and, ultimately, join the Church Triumphant. === Penitent === The term penitent ( or paenitens means \\"repenting, being sorry\\". Those who constitute the Church Penitent are in Purgatory to satisfy whatever portion of the temporal punishment due for their sins was not satisfied before death. They are in a process of purging their imperfections before entering heaven. It is held that all members of the Church Penitent will eventually join the Church Triumphant. The alternate term suffering () emphasizes the nature of souls' experience in Purgatory; they are suffering the temporal consequences of their sins to redemptive effect. The other alternative, expectant ( or exspectans), emphasizes that the souls of Purgatory are awaiting expectantly the beatific vision of heaven. === Triumphant === The term triumphant (), means \\"exulting, rejoicing exceedingly\\", taken from a figurative usage of ', originally designating the Roman triumph. Those who constitute the Church Triumphant rejoice eternally in the glory of God, to whom they are united in the beatific vision. == Usage in different Christian Churches  Anglican Communion === Anglicans believe that \\"...the Church on earth is united with the Church in heaven, ('sanctorum communio'). They speak of the 'Church Militant here on earth' and the Church triumphant in heaven. They worship God together with 'angels and archangels, and with all the company of heaven. === Catholic Church === The Catholic Church commemorates the Church Triumphant and the Church Penitent in its liturgy on two consecutive days: All Saints' Day on November 1 (the Church Triumphant) and All Souls' Day on November 2 (the Church Penitent). These terms are not used in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, an authoritative summary of the teaching of the Catholic Church published in 1994. However, the teaching these terms represent is precisely restated, quoting Lumen gentium: > The three states of the Church. \\"When the Lord comes in glory, and all his > angels with him, death will be no more and all things will be subject to > him. But at the present time some of his disciples are pilgrims on earth. > Others have died and are being purified, while still others are in glory, > contemplating 'in full light, God himself triune and one, exactly as he > is'.\\" Ecclesia militans, one of the largest icons in existence === Lutheran Church === Eric Lund, a Lutheran professor, described an analogy relating the Old Testament to the New Testament: \\"God ordered two altars to be placed in the tabernacle. Fire was transferred from the outer one to the inner one. God also assembled a twofold church: the church militant and the church triumphant. The fire of love will someday be transferred from the church militant to the church triumphant.\\" As such, within Lutheranism, \\"That is called the Church militant, which in this life is still fighting, under the banner of Christ, against Satan, the world, and the flesh.\\" Likewise, \\"That is called the Church triumphant, which, being transferred to heavenly rest, and relieved from the labor of fighting, and the danger of being overcome in heaven against all contending powers.\\" Heinrich Schmid, a Lutheran theologian explains that the Church Militant derives her name from spiritual warfare, citing , , , , and ; he further states that the Church Triumphant derives her name from spiritual victory, citing , , and . === Methodist Churches === The African Methodist Episcopal Church, a part of the World Methodist Council, defines the Church Militant as \\"engaged in constant warfare against the world, the flesh and the devil, and in that respect is distinguished from the Church Triumphant.\\" It defines the Church Militant as inclusive of all Christian denominations, among them Methodism, Presbyterianism, Baptist churches, Congregational churches, Anglicanism, among many others. In the same fashion, it defines the Church Triumphant as existing \\"in heaven, and consist[ing] of those who have washed their robes and made them immaculate and pure in the blood of the Lamb.\\" In Methodist theology, \\"the communion expressed at the Eucharist is not only within the Church Militant, but is between the Church Militant and the Church Triumphant.\\" === Seventh-day Adventist Church === The Seventh-day Adventist Church defines the terms in the following ways, \\"While in this world the church is a militant church, daily engaged in the battles of its Lord, and in warfare against satanic agencies. Its members are in constant conflict with the world, the flesh, and the powers of evil (Rom. 7:15‚Äì23; Gal. 5:17; 1 Peter 5:8, 9; 1 John 5:4; cf. 1 John 4:4). If this side of the Lord's return the church is the militant church, the church of the New Jerusalem is the triumphant church. It is made up of faithful disciples and conquerors in this worldly battle. They have exchanged the sword for a palm of victory (Rev 7:9) and the cross for a crown (2 Tim. 4:8; 1 Peter 5:4). The battle is over, the mission accomplished (Matt. 25:21, 23) and the redeemed, invited to the wedding feast of the Lamb (Rev. 19:9), eat and drink at Christ's table in His kingdom (Luke 22:28‚Äì30) and reign with Him for ever and ever (Rev 22:5).\\"Handbook of Seventh-day Adventist Theology (Hagerstown, MD: Review and Herald, 2000), pp. 565‚Äì566. Thus, the Seventh-day Adventist view is that the church is the Church Militant until the general resurrection at the end of the present age. The church becomes the Church Triumphant only after the second coming of Christ. ==Secular uses== The two states account of the church was adapted by Anatoly Lunacharsky to distinguish between a socialistic culture of the future (Ecclesia triumphans) and proletarian culture of the proletariat struggling in the present against capitalism (Ecclesia militans). This theoretical approach was used in the development of Proletkult. ==See also== * Book of Common Prayer * Catholic spirituality * Ecclesiology * Ecclesiology (Catholic Church) * Jihad ==References== *The Spirit of Catholicism, ch. 7-8 (\\"The Communion of Saints\\") by Karl Adam *Communion of Saints - article from the Catholic Encyclopedia *Lumen gentium (Dogmatic Constitution on the Church), n. 49 ==External links== *The Catholic Church is the Mystical Body of Christ by Fr.

The central part of the franchise dates from 1864, with the formation of First National Bank of Minneapolis. In 1929, that bank merged with First National Bank of St. Paul (also formed in 1864) and several smaller Upper Midwest banks to form the First Bank Stock Corporation, which changed its name to First Bank System in 1968. In the eastern part of the franchise, Farmers and Millers Bank in Milwaukee opened its doors in 1853, growing into the First National Bank of Milwaukee and eventually becoming First Wisconsin and ultimately Firstar Corporation.

In July 1988, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Auburn, Washington-based Western Independent Bancshares with its Auburn Valley Bank subsidiary for $4.25 million in cash. In October 1989, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Sacramento, California-based Mother Lode Savings Bank with three branch offices for $5.3 million. The acquisition was completed in August 1990. This acquisition was one of the first of thrift by a commercial bank in the nation since legislation permitting such takeovers went into effect. During the late 1980s, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon made several attempts to enter the state of Idaho by the acquisition of an existing Idaho-based bank, the only method then allowed under Idaho law, but failed when the price got too high. In March 1990, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced that they would establish a bank through a loophole in Federal banking law that allows the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to allow the relocation of bank headquarters within 30 miles of their present location without regards to state boundaries and state regulations. Link via ProQuest. So U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced that they plan to transfer the existing branches of the First National Bank of Spokane to the U.S. Bancorp of Washington and then ask permission from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to move the headquarters of First National from Spokane, Washington, to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. After receiving Federal approval, First National was finally moved in February 1992 and renamed U.S. Bank of Idaho. Link via ProQuest. In July 1990, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Auburn, California-based HeartFed Financial Corporation with its Heart Federal Savings and Loan subsidiary for $107.8 million in stock. At the time of the announcement, Heart Federal Savings had 29 branch offices in northern California. The acquisition was completed in March 1991 for $118 million. In November 1991, Edmund P. Jensen was given the post of chief operating officer in addition to his duties as president, making him a possible successor to Breezley. Alternate Link via ProQuest. In February 1992, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the 20 branch offices in Northern California and 29 branch offices in Nevada for $70 million that were being divested by Bankamerica Corporation as a result of Bank of America's impending acquisition of Security Pacific Corporation. This acquisition gave U.S. Bancorp of Oregon its first presence in the state of Nevada. Another major change in the organization of leadership in the U.S. Bancorp of Oregon occurred in January 1993. While retaining his position as chief operating officer, Edmund P. Jensen was appointed vice-chairman while giving his position of president to Kevin R. Kelly. At the same time, Gerry B. Cameron was appointed vice-chairman. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Ten months later, Jensen resigned to become president of Visa Inc. In January 1994, Gerry Cameron was first appointed chief operating officer as a replacement to Jensen and later appointed chief executive officer just three weeks later. Kelly submitted his resignation as president in March 1994 and Breezley finally gave up the chairmanship to Cameron in April 1994. In May 1995, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Boise, Idaho-based West One Bancorp for $1.8 billion. At the time of the announcement, West One had branch offices in Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and Utah while U.S. Bancorp of Oregon had branch offices in Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, and Nevada. The acquisition was completed in December 1995 and gave U.S. Bancorp of Oregon its first entry into the state of Utah. As part of the acquisition deal, West One's chairman and chief executive Daniel R. Nelson would become the chief operating officer and president of U.S. Bancorp and he would later be Cameron's successor as chairman and CEO upon Cameron's planned retirement in three years. Since both U.S. Bancorp and West One had overlapping territories in Oregon and Washington, the U.S. Justice Department would only allow the acquisition to proceed if U.S. Bancorp would sell off 27 branch offices in Washington and Oregon. As a result of the regulatory ruling, U.S. Bancorp sold 25 branch offices in Oregon, four in central Washington and one in Idaho to First Hawaiian Bank for $38 million in cash. In February 1996, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the San Ramon, California-based California Bancshares for $309 million in stock. California Bancshares had a total of 38 branches in the East San Francisco Bay Area in nine separate banks that included Alameda First National, Community First National, Modesto Banking Co., Commercial Bank of Fremont, Lamorinda National Bank, Bank of San Ramon Valley, Westside Bank, Concord Commercial Bank and Bank of Milipitas. The acquisition was completed in June 1996. In September 1996, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the St. George, Utah-based Sun Capital Bancorp with its three-branch office Sun Capital Bank subsidiary for $15.5 million. The acquisition was completed in January 1997. In December 1996, Daniel R. Nelson, president and chief operating officer of U.S. Bancorp of Oregon, unexpectedly announced his early retirement effective on New Year‚Äôs Day 1997. Nelson was originally in line to be Gerry B. Cameron's successor as chairman and chief executive upon the Cameron's planned retirement on New Year's Day 1999. In December 1996, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Sacramento, California-based Business & Professional Bank for $35 million in cash. The acquisition was completed in May 1997. ===First Bank System era=== First Bank System used this logo from 1979. It incorporates the silhouette of the number one. In March 1997, the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based First Bank System announced the pending acquisition of the Portland, Oregon-based U.S. Bancorp of Oregon for $9 billion in stock. At the time of the announcement, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon had banking offices in Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho and Utah while First Bank System had banking offices in Minnesota, Colorado, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Kansas, and Wyoming. Under the terms of the acquisition, First Bank System would be renamed U.S. Bancorp with the headquarters for the newly combined company being at First Bank's existing headquarters in Minneapolis. John F. Grundhofer, chairman and chief executive of First Bank, was appointed president and chief executive of the new company while Gerry B. Cameron, chairman, and chief executive of U.S. Bancorp of Oregon, was appointed chairman of the new company, which he held until his retirement in 1998. The acquisition was completed in August 1997. Approximately 4000 jobs were eliminated, mostly in Portland. Brief history of First Bank prior to acquisition First Bank System can trace its roots back to the formation of First National Bank of Minneapolis in 1864. In 1929, the First National Bank of Minneapolis joined together with the First National Bank of St. Paul to form a joint holding company for both banks that was called the First Bank Stock Corporation while keeping both subsidiary banks legally separate. The new holding company quickly grew by acquiring other banks in the four-state region before the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 prohibited such actions. First Bank Stock Corporation was renamed First Bank Stock Corporation Inc. in 1968. U.S. Bancorp after takeover by First Bank System In September 1997, the new U.S. Bancorp, formerly First Bank System, announced the pending acquisition of the St. Cloud, Minnesota-based Zappco, Inc. with its three banks and six banking locations for an undisclosed amount. At the time of the announcement, U.S. Bancorp had more than 1,000 banking offices in the states of Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, California, Idaho, Nebraska, North Dakota, Nevada, South Dakota, Montana, Iowa, Illinois, Utah, Wisconsin, Kansas, and Wyoming. The acquisition was completed in December 1997. In March 1998, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the Vancouver, Washington-based Northwest Bancshares with its 10-branch offices Northwest National Bank subsidiary for an undisclosed amount. In October 1998, the U.S. Justice Department agreed to allow the acquisition to proceed on the condition that one of the Northwest National Bank branch offices was to be sold. The acquisition was completed in December 1998 after U.S. Bancorp sold the request banking office to Centennial Bank of Eugene. At the end of 1998, Gerry Cameron retired as chairman and handed the position over to John Grundhofer who added the title of chairman to his other positions of president and chief executive officer. In February 1999, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the San Diego-based Bank of Commerce with its 10 branch offices for $314 million in stock. The acquisition was finalized in July 1999. In May 1999, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the Newport Beach, California-based Western Bancorp with its Santa Monica Bank and Southern California Bank subsidiaries and a total of 31 branch offices for $904 million in stock. Alternate Link via ProQuest. At the time of the announcement, U.S. Bancorp had 98 branch offices within California. The acquisition was finalized in November 1999 for $1.04 billion in stock. In July 1999, Philip G. Heasley was appointed president and chief operating officer of U.S. Bancorp. John Grundhofer had handed over the position of president to Heasley while still retaining the titles of chairman and chief executive officer. Heasley had assisted Grundhofer in turning the company around from near insolvency when the company was originally known as First Bank until it became a successful financial institution that became large enough to be absorb other banks, including U.S. Bancorp of Oregon in 1997. Heasley resigned the following year to join Bank One as the head of their First USA credit card unit around the same time Firstar was about to takeover U.S. Bancorp. In September 1999, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the San Diego-based Peninsula Bank with its 11 branch offices for $104 million in stock. In early January 2000, a group of Peninsula Bank stockholders tried to stop the merger because the initial merger agreement was made prior to the huge 27% single-day drop in the value of U.S. Bancorp stock which effectively lowered the purchase price. The acquisition was later completed in January 2000 at a 10% reduction of the original price negotiated. In June 2000, U.S. Bancorp announced the acquisition of the San Diego-based Scripps Financial Corporation with its nine-branch office Scripps Bank subsidiary for $155 million in stock. The acquisition was completed in October 2000. ===Firstar era=== In October 2000, Firstar Corporation of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, announced the pending acquisition of U.S. Bancorp of Minneapolis, Minnesota, for $21 billion in stock. Firstar completed its buyout of U.S. Bancorp on February 27, 2001, and changed its name to U.S. Bancorp. Under the merger agreement, Jerry Grundhofer, president and chief executive officer of Firstar, would continue in those positions in the combined company while his older brother, John Grundhofer, chairman, president and chief executive officer of U.S. Bancorp, would serve as chairman of the board in the combined company until his planned retirement on December 31, 2002. Though some administrative functions would remain in Milwaukee and Cincinnati, it was decided that the new combined company would be based in Minneapolis and that the new company would use the U.S. Bancorp name. To allow the merger to proceed, the U.S. Department of Justice required Firstar to sell 11 branch offices in the Minneapolis-area and 2 in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Bremer Bank of Saint Paul, Minnesota, purchased the 11 Minneapolis-area Firstar offices while Liberty Bank of West Des Moines, Iowa, purchased the 2 Council Bluffs offices. Brief history of Firstar prior to acquisition Although the origin of the Milwaukee-based Firstar Corporation can be traced back to the founding of the Farmer's and Millers Bank in Milwaukee in 1853 and the later formation of the First Wisconsin National Bank in 1919, the actual company that took over U.S. Bancorp in 2001 is the actually the same company and leadership that was responsible for the takeover of Firstar 27 months earlier in 1998, namely Star Banc Corporation. That bank, in turn, traced its roots to the founding of First National Bank of Cincinnati in 1863. Jerry Grundhofer and his team from Star Banc were instrumental in both acquisitions. Present-day U.S. Bancorp retains Star Banc's pre-1998 stock price history, and as mentioned above operates under the charter originally granted to First National Bank of Cincinnati. Additionally, all SEC filings before 1998 are under Star Banc, and all filings from 1998 to 2000 are under Firstar. U.S. Bancorp after takeover by Firstar In April 2001, the new U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of all 20 branch offices in California of the Encino-based Pacific Century Bank from its Honolulu-based parent Pacific Century Financial Corporation. The acquisition was completed in September 2001. In July 2002, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of all 57 retail banking branches of the San Mateo, California-based Bay View Bank from its Bay View Capital Corporation parent for $429 million. The acquisition was completed in November 2002. On New Years Day 2003, John Grundhofer retired as chairman of U.S. Bancorp and handed the position to his younger brother Jerry Grundhofer, who added the title of chairman to his other positions of president and chief executive officer in the corporation. In May 2004, U.S. Bancorp announced that it was acquiring the $34 billion corporate trust bond administration business from National City Corporation. In October 2004, Richard K. Davis was appointed chief operating officer and president of U.S. Bancorp. Jerry Grundhofer had handed over the position of president to Davis while still retaining the titles of chairman and chief executive officer. Davis had been a protege of Grundhofer since their days together at Star Banc Corporation and had assisted in the takeover of Firstar by Star Banc in 1998 and the later acquisition of U.S. Bancorp by Firstar in 2001. U.S. Bancorp acquired Genpass along with its MoneyPass ATM network subsidiary for an undisclosed amount in May 2005. In November 2005, U.S. Bancorp announced that it was acquiring the $410 billion corporate trust and institutional custody businesses of Wachovia Corporation for $720 million in cash. In July 2006, U.S. Bancorp announced that it was acquiring the $123 billion municipal and corporate bond trustee business from SunTrust. In June 2006, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the Avon, Colorado-based Vail Banks Inc. with its WestStar Bank subsidiary and 23 locations for $98.6 million in cash. The acquisition was completed in September 2006. In November 2006, U.S. Bancorp announced that it was acquiring the $30 billion municipal bond trustee business from LaSalle Bank. In November 2006, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the Great Falls, Montana-based United Financial Corporation with its Heritage Bank subsidiary for $71 million in stock. The acquisition was completed in February 2007 and nearly double the branch presence of U.S. Bank in Montana. In December 2006, Jerry Grundhofer handed over the position of chief executive officer to president Richard Davis while Grundhofer remained chairman until his retirement the following year in December 2007. After Grundhofer retirement in December 2007, Davis added the position of chairman to his other titles of president and chief executive officer. In March 2008, the U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the seven-office Los Angeles- based Mellon 1st Business Bank from the Bank of New York Mellon for an undisclosed amount in cash. The acquisition was completed in June 2008. On November 14, 2008, the U.S. Treasury invested $6,599,000,000 in preferred stock and warrants in the company via the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. On November 21, 2008, the company acquired the failed Downey Savings & Loan Association and also the failed Pomona First Federal Bancorp in a transaction facilitated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for an undisclosed amount. Downey Savings had 170 branch offices in California and five branch offices in Arizona while PFF Bank had 38 branch offices in Southern California. In April 2009, U.S. Bancorp acquired the assets and deposits of the failed Ketchum, Idaho-based First Bank of Idaho in a transaction facilitated by the FDIC. First Bank of Idaho had seven offices in Idaho and Wyoming, some of which operated under the name First Bank of the Tetons. On June 17, 2009, the company redeemed the $6.6 billion of preferred stock and on July 15, 2009, it completed the purchase of a warrant held by the U.S. Treasury Department. This effectively concluded U.S. Bancorp‚Äôs participation in the Capital Purchase Program. It was the first bank to repay the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds. On October 5, 2009, the company announced its acquisition of the $8 billion mutual fund administration and accounting servicing division of Fiduciary Management, Inc. for an undisclosed amount. On October 7, 2009, the company agreed to buy the bond trustee business of First Citizens Bank, a subsidiary of First Citizens BancShares Inc. for an undisclosed amount. On October 20, 2009, the company completed a transaction to purchase the failed FBOP Corporation's nine subsidiary banks from the FDIC for an undisclosed amount. The banks included BankUSA, National Association with 2 offices in Arizona, Cal National Bank with 68 offices in California, Citizens National Bank with 1 office in Texas, Community Bank of Lemont with 1 office in Illinois, Madisonville State Bank with 1 office in Texas, North Houston Bank with 1 office in Texas, Pacific National Bank with 17 offices in California, Park National Bank with 31 offices in Illinois, and San Diego National Bank with 28 offices in California. Since the company did not have a previous presence in Texas nor want one in the near future, the company subsequently sold the three banks in Texas in 2010 to Houston-based Prosperity Bancshares for an undisclosed amount. Each of the banks had one office each. In October 2009, BB&T; Corporation (now Truist Financial) announced the pending sale of its Nevada banking operations to U.S. Bancorp for an undisclosed amount. BB&T; had just acquired the 21 offices in Nevada through a transaction facilitated by the FDIC for disposal of the assets and deposits of the failed Alabama-based Colonial BancGroup but BB&T; had no desire to expand west of Texas while it wanted to keep the other Colonial former locations in the Southeastern United States. The acquisition was completed in January 2010. In July 2010, U.S. Bancorp sold its FAF Advisors subsidiary to Nuveen Investments for $80 million and a 9.5% stake in Nuveen. In January 2011, U.S. Bancorp acquired the assets and deposits of the failed First Community Bank of New Mexico in a transaction facilitated by the FDIC for an asset discount of approximately $380 million. The acquisition had included 35 offices in New Mexico and 3 offices in Arizona. In January 2012, the company acquired the assets and deposits of the failed Knoxville, Tennessee-based BankEast in a transaction facilitated by the FDIC for an asset discount of approximately $67.5 million. The acquisition had included 10 offices in the Knoxville area. In March 2013, U.S. Bancorp announced that it was acquiring the $57 billion municipal bond trustee business from Deutsche Bank. In January 2014, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of 94 branch offices of the Charter One Bank in Chicago from the RBS Citizens Financial Group for $315 million, doubling its market share in Chicago. 13 Charter One branches were closed due to their close proximity to existing U.S. Bank offices. The acquisition was completed in June 2014. In January 2015, chief financial officer Andrew Cecere was promoted to chief operating officer. A year later, Cecere was given the additional position of president. In January 2017, U.S. Bancorp announced that chairman and CEO Richard Davis was going to hand over his CEO position to president and COO Andrew Cecere in April 2017 while still remaining chairman of the corporation. Davis officially retired from the company in April 2018 and handed over the chairmanship position to Cecere. In February 2018, the bank was charged by the Department of Justice with failing to implement measures preventing illegal activities, including one case of abetting them. To defer prosecution, U.S. Bancorp agreed to pay $613 million in fines and agreed to implement measures to show the authorities that it had improved the monitoring of its customer transactions. $505 million was distributed in September 2018 to customers of an illegal payday loan business whose suspicious activities US Bancorp had failed to report. In September 2018, Fiserv announced that it would acquire MoneyPass from US Bancorp for $690 million. The deal was finalized in March 2019. In December 2019, the bank dismissed Emily James, a Portland, Ore., call-center employee, and her supervisor, after James personally gave $20 of her own money to a customer in need, Marc Eugenio. On Christmas Eve, Eugenio ran out of gasoline and cash, and he was stranded at a gas station when his U.S. Bank debit card was rejected because funds he had deposited two days earlier had not yet been released into his account as he had been promised. After an unsuccessful attempt to release the funds, James met Eugenio at the gas station during her break and offered him $20 from her own pocket as a Christmas Eve act of kindness. She was fired from her job, despite U.S. Bankcorp's policy that \\"Our employees are empowered to do the right thing.\\" After Nicolas Kristof published a critique of the firing in The New York Times the bank agreed to rehire the employees. ==Notable corporate buildings== *U.S. Bank Center in Phoenix, Arizona *U.S. Bank Tower in Sacramento, California *One California in San Francisco, California, sports the U.S. Bank logo and houses bank offices *U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles, California, the third tallest building west of the Mississippi River *U.S. Bank Tower in Denver, Colorado *U.S. Bank Plaza in Boise, Idaho *U.S. Bank Building in Chicago, Illinois *U.S. Bank Building in Davenport, Iowa *U.S. Bank Building in Duluth, Minnesota *U.S. Bancorp Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota *U.S. Bank Plaza in Minneapolis, Minnesota *U.S. Bank Center in St. Paul, Minnesota *One U.S. Bank Plaza in St. Louis, Missouri *U.S. Bank Building in Billings, Montana *U.S. Bank Tower in Lincoln, Nebraska *U.S. Bank Center in Las Vegas, Nevada *U.S. Bank Tower in Cincinnati, Ohio *U.S. Bank Centre in Cleveland, Ohio *U.S. Bancorp Tower in Portland, Oregon *U.S. Bank Building in Sioux Falls, South Dakota *U.S. Bank Centre in Seattle, Washington * U.S. Bank Building in Spokane, Washington *U.S. Bank Building in La Crosse, Wisconsin *U.S. Bank Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin *U.S. Bank Plaza in Madison, Wisconsin ==Naming rights and Sponsorships== U.S. Bank owns corporate naming rights to the following: *U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota U.S. Bank is a sponsor of: * Denver Broncos ‚Äì Official Bank of the Denver Broncos. * Minnesota Vikings ‚Äì Official Bank of the Minnesota Vikings. * San Francisco 49ers ‚Äì Official Bank of the San Francisco 49ers. * Utah Jazz ‚Äì Official Bank of the Utah Jazz. * NHL ‚Äì Official Partner of the NHL. ==See also== * John F.

The term \\"Mixolydian mode\\" may refer to one of three things: the name applied to one of the ancient Greek harmoniai or tonoi, based on a particular octave species or scale; one of the medieval church modes; a modern musical mode or diatonic scale, related to the medieval mode. (The Hypomixolydian mode of medieval music, by contrast, has no modern counterpart.) : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 7/4 c4^\\\\markup { Modern C Mixolydian scale } d e f g a bes c2 } } The modern diatonic mode is the scale forming the basis of both the rising and falling forms of Harikambhoji in Carnatic music, the classical music form of southern India. ==Greek Mixolydian== The idea of a Mixolydian mode comes from the music theory of ancient Greece. The invention of the ancient Greek Mixolydian mode was attributed to Sappho, the poet and musician.Anne Carson (ed.), If Not, Winter: Fragments of Sappho (New York: Vintage Books, 2002), p. ix. . Carson cites Pseudo-Plutarch, On Music 16.113c, who in turn names Aristoxenus as his authority. However, what the ancient Greeks thought of as Mixolydian was very different from the modern interpretation of the mode. In Greek theory, the Mixolydian tonos (the term \\"mode\\" is a later Latin term) employs a scale (or \\"octave species\\") corresponding to the Greek Hypolydian mode inverted. In its diatonic genus, this is a scale descending from paramese to hypate hypaton. In the diatonic genus, a whole tone (paramese to mese) followed by two conjunct inverted Lydian tetrachords (each being two whole tones followed by a semitone descending). This diatonic genus of the scale is roughly the equivalent of playing all the white notes of a piano from B to B, which is also known as modern Locrian mode. : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 7/4 e4^\\\\markup { Greek Mixolydian tonos (diatonic genus) on E } f g a bes c d e2 } } In the chromatic and enharmonic genera, each tetrachord consists of a minor third plus two semitones, and a major third plus two quarter tones, respectively.Thomas J. Mathiesen, \\"Greece\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, 29 vols., edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell, 10: (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001), 10:339. . : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 7/4 e4^\\\\markup { Greek Mixolydian tonos (chromatic genus) on E } f ges a bes ces d e2 } } : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 7/4 e4^\\\\markup { Greek Mixolydian tonos (enharmonic genus) on E } feh geses a beseh ceses d e2 } } ==Medieval Mixolydian and Hypomixolydian== The term Mixolydian was originally used to designate one of the traditional harmoniai of Greek theory. It was appropriated later (along with six other names) by 2nd-century theorist Ptolemy to designate his seven tonoi or transposition keys. Four centuries later, Boethius interpreted Ptolemy in Latin, still with the meaning of transposition keys, not scales. When chant theory was first being formulated in the 9th century, these seven names plus an eighth, Hypermixolydian (later changed to Hypomixolydian), were again re-appropriated in the anonymous treatise Alia Musica. A commentary on that treatise, called the Nova expositio, first gave it a new sense as one of a set of eight diatonic species of the octave, or scales.Harold S. Powers, \\"Dorian\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001). The name Mixolydian came to be applied to one of the eight modes of medieval church music: the seventh mode. This mode does not run from B to B on white notes, as the Greek mode, but was defined in two ways: as the diatonic octave species from G up one octave to the G above, or as a mode whose final was G and whose ambitus runs from the F below the final to the G above, with possible extensions \\"by licence\\" up to A above and even down to E below, and in which the note D (the tenor of the corresponding seventh psalm tone) had an important melodic function.Harold S. Powers and Frans Wiering, \\"Mixolydian\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, 29 vols., edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrell, 16:766‚Äì67 (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001), 767. . This medieval theoretical construction led to the modern use of the term for the natural scale from G to G. The seventh mode of western church music is an authentic mode based on and encompassing the natural scale from G to G, with the perfect fifth (the D in a G to G scale) as the dominant, reciting note or tenor. The plagal eighth mode was termed Hypomixolydian (or \\"lower Mixolydian\\") and, like the Mixolydian, was defined in two ways: as the diatonic octave species from D to the D an octave higher, divided at the mode final, G (thus D‚ÄìE‚ÄìF‚ÄìG + G‚ÄìA‚ÄìB‚ÄìC‚ÄìD); or as a mode with a final of G and an ambitus from C below the final to E above it, in which the note C (the tenor of the corresponding eighth psalm tone) had an important melodic function.Harold S. Powers and Frans Wiering, \\"Hypomixolydian\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, 29 vols., edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrell, 12:38 (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001) . ==Modern Mixolydian== The modern Mixolydian scale is the fifth mode of the major scale (Ionian mode). That is, it can be constructed by starting on the fifth scale degree (the dominant) of the major scale. Because of this, the Mixolydian mode is sometimes called the dominant scale.Dan Haerle, Scales for Jazz Improvisation (Hialeah: Columbia Pictures Publications; Lebanon, Indiana: Studio P/R; Miami: Warner Bros, 1983), p. 15. . : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 7/4 g4^\\\\markup { Modern G Mixolydian scale } a b c d e f g2 } } This scale has the same series of tones and semitones as the major scale, but with a minor seventh. As a result, the seventh scale degree is a subtonic, rather than a leading-tone.Arnie Berle, \\"The Mixolydian Mode/Dominant Seventh Scale\\", in Mel Bay's Encyclopedia of Scales, Modes and Melodic Patterns: A Unique Approach to Developing Ear, Mind and Finger Coordination (Pacific, Missouri: Mel Bay Publications, 1997): p. 33. The flattened seventh of the scale is a tritone away from the mediant (major-third degree) of the key. The order of whole tones and semitones in a Mixolydian scale is :whole, whole, half, whole, whole, half, whole In the Mixolydian mode, the tonic, subdominant, and subtonic triads are all major, the mediant is diminished, and the remaining triads are minor. The Mixolydian mode is common in non-classical harmony, such as folk, jazz, funk, blues, and rock music. Klezmer musicians refer to the Mixolydian scale as the Adonai malakh mode. In Klezmer, it is usually transposed to C, where the main chords used are C, F, and G7 (sometimes Gm).Dick Weissman and Dan Fox, A Guide to Non-Jazz Improvisation: Guitar Edition (Pacific, Missouri: Mel Bay Publications, 2009): p. 130. . ==Notable music in Mixolydian modeTraditional=== *\\"Old Joe Clark\\"Wendy Anthony, \\"Building a Traditional Tune Repertoire: Old Joe Clark (Key of A-Mixolydian) \\", Mandolin Sessions webzine (February 2007) (Accessed 2 February 2010).Ted Eschliman, \\"Something Old.

Contemporary manufacturers, kite athletes, kite pilots, scientists, and engineers are expanding the possibilities. == Single-line kite control systems  High-altitude attempt single-line control systems === On-board angle-of-attack mechanisms were used in 2000 altitude record-making flight; the operators' designed adjuster limited kite line tension to not more than 100 pounds by altering the angle of attack of the kite's wing body. The kite's line had a control: line payout meter that did not function in the record-setting flight. However, some special tether line lower end used some bungee and pulley arrangements to lower the impact of gusts on the long tether. Control of a kite includes how other aircraft sees the kite system; the team placed a radio beacon (using two-meter frequency detectable for 50 miles) on the kite; for sight visibility, strobe lights were hung from the kite's nose. Control via use of reels and pulleys become critical when tension is high; the team had to repair and replace parts during the flight session. === Auxiliary control === Auxiliary devices have been invented and used for controlling single-line kites. Devices on board the kite's wing can react to the kite-line's tension or to the kite's angle of attack with the ambient stream in which the kite is flying. Special reel devices allow kite-line length and tension control. Moving the kite's line lower end left or right or windward or anti-windward forms part of the control system of single-line kites. Devices at the kite's bridle can be set to alter the relative lengths of sub-bridle lines in order to set the attitude of the kite so that the kite flies at a certain position of the potential positions; this can be done for one setting while the kite is readied for flight; but Kenneth C. Howard invited a device that can be operated on single-line kites during the flight session for variable settings: === Fighter-kite control systems === The traditional fighter kiting with single-line control dominates kite fighting while multi-line kite fighting is yet a minor activity. The human operator of the single line aims to master movements (tugs, jerks, releases, directional movements) in order to have the unstable kite temporarily move in one direction or another. The intents of the controls are offensive and defensive; escape from an attack or position for an attack. The building of the kite so that motions by the kite's human operator or pilot allow a temporary limited stability takes special care.The Art of Gudiparan bazi.

He finally came upon what George A. Spratt already had found for aviation and any hang glider: triangle control frame or A-frame in front of pilot while pilot hung from a tether either in a seat or harness for various positions; the mechanical arrangement precluded invention in later years for the same. Many others would find the same mechanical arrangement for mass-shifting for Rogallo hang gliders and derivatives; these free-flying manned kites or hang gliders used the wing for the kites from the Fleep or Paresev or derivatives of that branch of stiffened flexible wings.Barry Palmer's Sevtec Sev Surface Skimmer Program == Medium- length-tethered power kites == Power kites are controlled by 2 to 5 lines. The simplest systems provide steering by pulling either end of the kite. More lines can provide different functions. These are: * adjusting the angle of attack: Pulling on lines attached to the front edge of the kite will reduce the angle of attack and thereby reduce the pull of the kite. * braking: A line pulling the trailing edge down causes a braking effect that can be used either to make the kite turn quickly if applied to only one side, or to bring the kite down if applied symmetrically. * distorting the kite: Useful when the kite is lying on the surface of the water. A fifth line is occasionally used to do this and thereby makes relaunching much quicker and easier. The lines attach to different controllers: ;Rings or wrist loops :These are commonly found on smaller foils. ;Two-line bars :These are found on LEIs, target kites, and other recreational, and special-application kite systems.KITE CONTROL ASSEMBLY E. V. KINSEYCARNWATH ROTATING KITE J. R. CARNWATH They almost always have a wrist leash attached to one of the lines so that the kite will come down if the bar is released. ;Three-line bars :These are found on some foils. Lines from the ends of the bar attach to either side of the kite and the third line attaches to the rear edge of the foil. This line passes through the bar and is attached to a wrist leash via a cleat to lock the brake off until the bar is dropped. This bar design was never developed by the major manufacturers due to the complexity of the design however an advanced model is now commercially available from K-trac. ;Four-line bars :These are found on LEIs, Bows and some foils. This system provides angle-of-attack adjustment. There is usually a semi-permanent attachment, known as the chicken loop, fastened to the kiter's harness via the front lines. Releasing the bar while still attached to the chicken loop causes the kite to assume its minimum angle of attack and therefore minimizes the pull generated. There is usually a safety mechanism so that the kite can be totally depowered by detaching from the chicken loop whilst still hanging on to the kite by a leash attached to one of the lines. There are many variants on this system. ;Five-line bars :These are essentially a 4-line system plus a fifth line attached to either the leading edge or trailing edge of the kite. A trailing edge system causes the kite to travel to the center of the power zone and thus re-launch with a lot of power. A leading edge system is used both as a depower and a relaunch device. It can be used to lower the angle of attack for depowering. For relaunch it can be used to assist rolling the kite into the proper position. ;Handles :These are commonly found on 4-line foils. Each handle is a bar with a line attached at each end and each handle controls either the left or right side of the kite. They are held at the top where the power lines attach. Brake lines attach to the bottom of each bar and go to the rear edge of each side of the kite. These provide a braking function not an angle of attack function == Control of high- altitude electricity-generating wind-power kite systems == Human control of high altitude wind power systems is typically accomplished through servo mechanisms, as the tether tensions are too great for direct manual operation.KiteGen project: control as key technology for a quantum leap in wind energy generators by M. Canale, L. Fagiano, M. Milanese, and M. Ippolito. There are a number of patents in this area: * Kite control systems John D. Bellacera * Several patents by brothers L Patents by Dominique and Bruno Legaignoux In 1984 a fundamental first patent gave them impetus to later bring forward several other key kite control patents. Other concepts include: * Pulling the lines using winches * Rotating the line attachment points around a central pivot.Kite test 2 of the Sussex University kite control project. * Shifting the line attachment points back and forth (or up and down) using linear motors == Control of kite rigs == See main article kite rigs. Kite rigs are systems for propelling a vehicle, such as a boat, buggy, or a vehicle with snow and ice runners. They may be as simple as a person flying a kite while standing on a specialized skateboard, or be complex systems fixed to the vehicle with powered and automated controls. They differ from conventional sails in that they are flown from lines, not supported by masts. ===Commercial transport propulsion === Ship-pulling kites run to hundreds of square meters of area and require a special attachment points, a launch and recovery system, and fly-by-wire controls. The SkySails ship propulsion system consists of a large foil kite, an electronic control system for the kite, and an automatic system to retract the kite. The kite, while over ten times larger, bears similarities to the arc kites used in kitesurfing. However, the kite is an inflatable rather than a ram-air kite. Additionally, a control pod is used rather than direct tension on multiple kite control lines; only one line runs the full distance from kite to ship, with the bridle lines running from kite to control pod. Power to the pod is provided by cables embedded in the line; the same line also carries commands to the control pod from the ship.Airborne Wind Energy Systems, a review of the technologies, A. cherubini, A. Papini, R. Vertechy, M.Fontana, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 2015 The kite is launched and recovered by an animated mast or arm, which grips the kite by its leading edge. The mast also inflates and deflates the kite. When not in use, mast and deflated kite fold away. == Target-kites == The term target kite generally refers to the war-time kites used for shipboard anti-aircraft gunnery practice. These were the invention of Paul Garber, doing war work while on leave from the Smithsonian (where he was responsible for the acquisition of much of the Air and Space collection). The kites were ordinary two-spar Eddy style kites with a height of about five feet. The sail was sky blue with the profile of a Japanese Zero or German aircraft painted in black. Attached at the lower end of the vertical spar is a small rudder, much like a boat's rudder. The rudder is controlled by two kite lines, which are also used to fly the kite. The two lines come down to earth and terminate at an either a flying bar (a bar with spools at either end) or a special two-spool reel which incorporated a ratchet mechanism to assist in equalizing line length. The spool was in the center of a wooden bar which held the lines a fixed distance apart. == Indoor == A wand or pole with a string on the end is often used to lead indoor kites around. == Hang-gliders  Unpowered short-tethered hang-gliders === Unlike the long-lined power kites used in extreme kiting sport, the focus in this section is the short-lined framed large kite.by Craig C. Freudenrich, Ph.D.Hang Gliding It's Not Just For Hanging on to Dear Life Anymore by Angelo Mantas.Historical Background. The kite line or \\"hang line\\" for best controlling the flight of the hang glider kite needs to be carefully lengthed; then the line frequently splits to two, three, or four main tethers that connect to the hung kite operator's or pilot's harness. Mike Meier, respected kite glider author wrote How To Get The Right Hang Height NASA used mass-shifting in the Paresev hung-pilot aircraft with a stiffened-frame kite; the hang tether was also stiffened; differently, in sport hang gliding kite systems using the short hang line, the hang loop or first section of the hanging kite line is a flexible webbing; then the main lines to the harness are cords and sometimes webbing that are flexible. Control of the attitude of the kite's wing is achieved frequently by the pilot's grabbing the kite's stiffened airframe part called the control frame and pushing or pulling the kite's airframe left or right or forward and aft in various combinations; this control system is most commonly called \\"weight-shifting\\" although mechanically the situation is altering positions of mass to alter the center of gravity of the entire system relative to the aerodynamic center of pressure in order to effect leveraging moments to control the flight. The place on the kite airframe where the tether is tied is very important as in all kites; such connection or bridling takes into consideration the aerodynamic center of pressure and the system's center of gravity. A key article by Mike Meier Pitch Stability & Center of Mass Location by Mike Meier focuses on this concern of control. While flying the kite hang glider, there are times during flight instruction that instructors will have the student fully release from holding the triangle control frame and simply and only hang. The hanging (gravity pulls the student's body downwards and results in a tensional tugging of the kite's wing) student experiences that the properly bridled and trimmed wing will fly stably.Flight. The student experiences that the letting go of the control frame will let a properly trim allows stable flight still to occur. However, since gusts occur, the student learns that hands-off flying is not the normal status‚Äîrather the kite pilot almost always is handling the control frame.

Light bar pressure deemed important for longer X-C flying.How To Control a Hang Glider in the Air. === Powered short-tethered hang-gliders === Here the unpowered kite is tethered to a pilot who arranges to have a harness to which is attached a thrusting prime moving engine or motor; the total system is a [Powered hang gliderpowered aircraft] while the kite itself remains unpowered (very differently is when an engine is mounted on a wing). The control system includes the control system of the similar system where the pilot is not thrusted by a harnessed prime moving engine or motor, however in controlling flight, adjustments for center of mass are respected. Further, while the pilot's thrust is on, the pilot positions so that the kite's kite line is angled so tugging of the wing is accomplished in the familiar kiting manner where the kite line begins upwind and angles upward downwind (relative wind is to be the wind in attention here).Powered Hang Gliders: Climbing & AirspeedEffect of FLPHG Engine Thrust on Bar PositionFour Years With a Powered Harness Richard Cobb - 2005 === Under tow by airplane === Image:Hg tow instruction.jpgThe kite hang glider is readying for being a kite in two ways; during kiting tug by the ultralight powered hang glider trike the system is a long-line kite being towed; then upon release from tug, the kite hang glider is a short-kite-lined free-flight kite with a dominant aim of gliding. Image:Hg tow start.jpgComplex control: The kited hang glider pilot is the main decision maker; the ultralight tug pilot has control duties. Hang glider on a runway, ready to start by UL-tow. The kite hang glider is sitting in a three-wheeled trolley while the trike is starting its engine. === Under static-line tow === Here the tug kite line stays the same length during the kiting operation. Static Line Towing Here the ground vehicle driver has special control duties; the kited hang glider person controls the kite in some ways different from other tow methods; careful distinctions are learned in professional instruction. Controlling things when unexpected events occur is a large part of instructions. === Under non-static-line tow === Hang glider tow with stationary winch in 1987; pilot: Manfred Laudahn in Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Germany. The red item on the long kite line is a line parachute that will soften the fall of the released kite line. After release, the human will hang from a short hang line only to tug the kite hang glider wing; he then moves the triangle control frame to control the attitudes of the kite's wing. The fall of the pilot's mass provides the tension to fly the wing. The complex control system includes the operator of the winch. The length of line starts long and then gets shorter as the winch reels the tug line; this alters the control decisions by the kited hang glider pilot. Instruction for controls is available for new winch operators and hang glider pilots who want to be so kited. Distinguish this method from static-line (tug line stays same length during the tow). The control system for the shortening-the-tug-line method of kiting is different. === Under bungee-line launch=== Bungee launch control systems for kited hang gliders has its own special details. The tug kite line is very elastic; when tensed, the line is long; during use for launch, the kite line shortens. Controlling the kite's wing attitudes is up to the pilot who frequently is hung from a short kite line while controlling a triangle control frame or other airframe part or even aerodynamic surface controls. Professional instruction is highly recommended. Inelastic portion of the bungee assembly is used to help guard against what can happen if the bungee breaks and snaps back toward the pilot; a tug-line parachute can be used to lower the speed that the released bungee will fall. Bungee launch is used most frequently for launch off slopes when free-foot-launch is not easy (site structure or pilots who have not the use of their legs), or for flatland short-flight demonstrations. Hang Gliding - Bungee Launch == Paragliders == The non-stiffened Francis Rogallo parawing, the Domina Jalbert founded parafoil wing, or other modified fully flexible wings (Barish sailwing, KiteShip wing, parasails, modified conical parachutes) do not lend themselves to a mounting of a prime moving engine or motor to them; rather the kiting lines to the unpowered wing terminate below the wing to a static or mobile anchoring; that anchoring itself may be with its own active thrusting engine or motor or the anchor (which could be payload, pilot, or both payload and pilot) may simply fall by gravity force‚Äîand thus by gravity tug the wing through the kite lines. When the payload or pilot is simply falling without adding a prime moving engine or motor, then the kited flexible wing is a paragliding wing; when the payload or pilotComparing Ultralight Aircraft: Choices, Choices. Author sees what is nearly a clich√© by those understanding: paraglider is a kite. is additionally arranged with a thrust engine or motor, then the kited unpowered flexible wing with such thrusted payload or pilot is a powered aircraft system or powered paragliding system. The control systems are varied for particular applications (ranging from lowering military payloads, autonomous powered paragliders or drones, sport paragliding, sport powered paragliding, scale-model paragliding, scale-model powered paragliding).[Powered Paraglider UAVs]About Powered Paragliding (PPG FAQ)Powered Paragliders - 101 UsesParaglide InstructionOzone Frog guru turns 60 All variations have in common the unpowered kite whether or not the payload and/or pilot is powered. == Governable gliding parachutes == slider. These free-flight kites are governable parachutes and are used as payload delivery systems, sport gliding parachuting or skydiving, BASE jumping, scale-model parachuting. When used for delivery of sensitive payloads or carrying humans, the fast opening from packed format is damped by use of a slider. The wing remains unpowered and kited by bridle tethering lines; the lines attach to platforms or harnesses. The size and design of the kited wing is customized for the final type of use where packing, opening, and sink rate are important feature. Control systems are specialized for the specific use. Control systems sometimes include radio control from remote locations. == Kite aerial photography == Kites used in kite aerial photography (KAP) are typically controlled using the same reels and spools as non-KAP kite flyers. The best KAP work seems be done at lower altitudes than you might imagine (100‚Äì200'), so no special equipment is required. The most problematic KAP flights are when the best camera shot requires the kite to be flown amongst tall trees or buildings, so quick haul-in can be a plus. The camera rig itself is attached to the kite line some distance beneath the kite, preferably with a pulley scheme that will permit the camera to float in a level attitude regardless of the kite's gyrations. The Picavet system is one such scheme. Further sophistication in kite photography comes with live video and radio control features to control where the camera is pointing. This is superior to the minimal rig which simply clicks the camera every few minutes and must be hauled down to earth to change the direction in which the camera points. The penalty of the radio control rigs is weight, which requires higher winds to do photography. So in addition to clear skies, you must also have high winds, which will limit opportunities for photography. == Solar sail and plasma kites == Scientists on one type of solar kite take pride that there will be a minimum of moving parts to control the movement of the solar kite through space and around the earth, moon, comet, or other solar system body. ESA CONTRACT 17679/03/NL/SFe Solar Kite Mission Feasibility Study EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Authors: C. Jack and C. Welch A collection of scientists and engineers are expanding the definition of what is a kite; the solar kite described by authors C. Jack and C. Welch has the inertia of the mass of the kite providing resistance against photonic flow; also, the controlling of the kite to alter the kite's acceleration sets up a kiting scenario: cause the kite to deflect away from the pull of gravity to keep the kite flying intended path supports the inclusion of the solar sail as a kite in photonic flow. The kite is fed start data; the kite tracks the stars and operates three elements to control its attitude to effect its deflections to result in the flight path desired by the ground-directing kite operators. The position of the payload is changed to alter the relative positions of the kite's center of pressure and center of mass; this is done in part by piezoelectric actuators. Also, the struts that hold the centered payload are differentially heated; such causes one of the struts to become longer than the cooler struts and thereby changing the center of mass relative to the center of pressure of the kite. Further, to cause an attitude change, tiny photo thrusters (heated wire) tweak the attitude of the kite; such thrusters do not propel the kite, but are only used to change the attitude of the kite's sail. These mechanisms aim to give authoritative control at minimum power use for giving direction to the kite. Working solar kite groups are considering at least seventeen means of control of the solar kite/solar sail. West Group.

Glarean added Aeolian as the name of the new ninth mode: the relative natural mode in A with the perfect fifth as its dominant, reciting tone, reciting note, or tenor. The tenth mode, the plagal version of the Aeolian mode, Glarean called Hypoaeolian (\\"under Aeolian\\"), based on the same relative scale, but with the minor third as its tenor, and having a melodic range from a perfect fourth below the tonic to a perfect fifth above it. Although scholars for the past three centuries have regarded the modes added by Glarean as the basis of the minor/major division of classical European music, as homophonic music replaced Renaissance polyphony, this is an oversimplification. Even the key of A minor is as closely related to the old transposed modes 1 and 2 (Dorian and Hypodorian) with finals on A‚Äîas well as to mode 3 (Phrygian)‚Äîas it is to Glarean's Aeolian. In modern usage, the Aeolian mode is the sixth mode of the major scale and has the following formula: :1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 The Aeolian mode is the sixth mode of the major scale, that is, it is formed by starting on the sixth degree (submediant) of the major scale. For example, if the Aeolian mode is used in its all-white-note pitch based on A, this would be an A-minor triad, which would be the submediant in the relative major key of C major. : {\\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 7/4 \\\\hide Staff.TimeSignature a4^\\\\markup { A Aeolian scale } b c d e f g a2 } } == Aeolian harmony == All harmony Aeolian except for the Picardy third ending this i‚Äìv‚Äìi‚Äìiv‚Äìi‚Äìv‚ÄìI progression . Aeolian harmonyAlf Bj√∂rnberg (1985). Cited in Middleton 1990, p. 198. is harmony or chord progression created from chords of the Aeolian mode. Commonly known as the \\"natural minor\\" scale, it allows for the construction of the following triads (three note chords built from major or minor thirds), in popular music symbols: i, III, iv, v, VI, and VII. The scale also produces ii, which is avoided since it is diminished. The leading-tone and major V which contains it are also not used, as they are not part of the Aeolian mode (natural minor scale). However, Aeolian harmony may be used with mode mixture. For example, VII is a major chord built on the seventh scale degree, indicated by capital Roman numerals for seven. There are common subsets including i‚ÄìVII‚ÄìVI, i‚Äìiv‚Äìv and blues minor pentatonic derived chord sequences such as I‚ÄìIII‚ÄìIV, I‚ÄìIV, VII (The verse of \\"I'm Your Man\\").Richard Middleton, Studying Popular Music (Milton Keynes and Philadelphia: Open University Press, 1990), p. 198\\\\. . All these lack perfect cadences (V‚ÄìI) and may be thought of as derived from rewrite rules using recursive fourth structures (repeated progression by perfect fourth, see circle progression). Middleton suggests of modal and fourth-oriented structures that, rather than being, \\"distortions or surface transformations of Schenker's favoured V‚ÄìI kernel, it is more likely that both are branches of a deeper principle, that of tonic/not-tonic differentiation.\\" ==Songs that use Aeolian mode== The Aeolian mode is identical with the natural minor scale. Thus, it is ubiquitous in minor-key music. The following is a list of some examples that are distinguishable from ordinary minor tonality, which also uses the melodic minor scale and the harmonic minor scale as required. *Bob Dylan ‚Äì \\"All Along the Watchtower\\"Gary Ewer, \\"Dorian Mode, Aeolian Mode, Minor Key...

A. (2004). A practical Sanskrit Dictionary. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, pages 15, 382-383 specifically in Indian religions. It also refers to a genre of religious performance arts, connoting a musical form of narration or shared recitation, particularly of spiritual or religious ideas, native to the Indian subcontinent. With roots in the Vedic anukirtana tradition, a kirtan is a call-and-response style song or chant, set to music, wherein multiple singers recite or describe a legend, or express loving devotion to a deity, or discuss spiritual ideas. It may include dancing or direct expression of bhavas (emotive states) by the singer. Many kirtan performances are structured to engage the audience where they either repeat the chant,Sara Brown (2012), Every Word Is a Song, Every Step Is a Dance, PhD Thesis, Florida State University (Advisor: Michael Bakan), pages 25-26, 87-88, 277 or reply to the call of the singer. A person performing kirtan is known as a kirtankara (or kirtankar). A Kirtan performance includes an accompaniment of regionally popular musical instruments, such as the harmonium, the veena or ektara (forms of string instruments), the tabla (one- sided drums), the mrdanga or pakhawaj (two-sided drum), flute (forms of woodwind instruments), and karatalas or talas (cymbals). It is a major practice in Hinduism, Vaisnava devotionalism, Sikhism, the Sant traditions and some forms of Buddhism, as well as other religious groups. Kirtan is sometimes accompanied by story-telling and acting. Texts typically cover religious, mythological or social subjects. ==Etymology and nomenclature== Maha-San- Kirtan Kirtan () has Vedic roots and it is \\"telling, narrating, describing, enumerating, reporting\\". The term is found as Anukirtan (or Anukrti, Anukarana, literally a \\"re-telling\\") in the context of Yajna, wherein team recitations of dialogue-style and question-answer riddle hymns were part of the ritual or celebratory dramatic performance. The Sanskrit verses in chapter 13.2 of Shatapatha Brahmana (~800‚Äì700 BCE), for example, are written in the form of a riddle play between two actors.ML Varadpande (1990), History of Indian Theatre, Volume 1, Abhinav, , page 48 The root of kirtan is kirt (). The root is found in the Samhitas, the Brahmanas and other Vedic literature, as well as the Vedanga and Sutras literature. Kirt, according to Monier- Williams contextually means, \\"to mention, make mention of, tell, name, call, recite, repeat, relate, declare, communicate, commemorate, celebrate, praise, glorify\\".Monier William (1899), kƒ´rt, Sanskrit-English Dictionary, 2nd Ed., Oxford University Press Kirtan, sometimes referred to as sankirtana (literally, \\"collective performance\\"), is a call-and-response chanting or musical conversation, a genre of religious performance arts that developed during India's bhakti devotional traditions. However, it is a heterogeneous practice that varies regionally according to Christian Novetzke, and includes varying mixture of different musical instruments, dance, oration, theatre, audience participation and moral narration. In Maharashtra for example, states Novetzke, a kirtan is a call-and-response style performance, ranging from devotional dancing and singing by a lead singer and audience, to an \\"intricate scholarly treatise, a social commentary or a philosophical/linguistic exposition\\", that includes narration, allegory, humor, erudition and entertainment ‚Äì all an aesthetic part of ranga (beauty, color) of the kirtan. Kirtan is locally known as Abhang, Samaj Gayan, Haveli Sangeet, Vishnupad, Harikatha. The Vaishnava temples and monasteries of Hinduism in Assam and northeastern, called Satra, have a large worship hall named kirtan ghar ‚Äì a name derived from their being used for congregational singing and performance arts. In regional languages, kirtan is scripted as ; Nepali & ; ; ; ; ; . ==Hinduism== The Vedic sage Narada has been called an early Kirtana singer in the Puranas. Musical recitation of hymns, mantras and the praise of deities has ancient roots in Hinduism, as evidenced by the Samaveda and other Vedic literature. Kirtans were popularized by the Bhakti movement of medieval era Hinduism, starting with the South Indian Alvars (Vaishnavism) and Nayanars (Shaivism) around the 6th century, which spread in central, northern, western and eastern India particularly after the 12th century, as a social and congregational response to Hindu-Muslim conflicts.Karen Pechelis (2011), Bhakti Traditions, in The Continuum Companion to Hindu Studies (Editors: Jessica Frazier, Gavin Flood), Bloomsbury, , pages 107-121 The foundations of the kirtan traditions are also found in other Hindu scriptures such as the Bhagavad-gita where Krishna describes bhakti marga (path of loving devotion to god) as a means to moksha, alongside karma marga (path of action) and jnana marga (path of knowledge). References to kirtan as a musical recitation are also found in the Bhagavata Purana, an important Vaishnava text. Kirtan is often practiced as a kind of theatrical folk song with call-and-response chanting or antiphon. The ancient sage Narada revered as a musical genius, is called a kirtankar in the Padma Purana. The famous story of Prahlada in the Avatara Katha mentions kirtan as one of nine forms of worship, called the nava vidha bhakti along with shravanam (listening), smaranam (remembrance), pada sevanam (service), archanam (offering), vandanam (obeisance), dasyam (servitude), sakhyam (friendship) and atmanivedanam (surrender). The so-called Naradiya Kirtan divides kirtan into five parts: naman (prayers), purvaranga (spiritual lesson based on old epics), chanting, katha or akhyan (exegesis), and a final prayer for universal welfare. ===Vaishnavism=== Some Vaishnavism sub-traditions believe in public kirtan performance, with songs and dance. A painting of a 19th-century performance by Chaitanya group in Bengal. Kirtan as a genre of religious music has been a major part of the Vaishnavism tradition, particularly starting with the Alvars of Sri Vaishnavism sub-tradition between the 7th to 10th century CE. After the 13th-century, two subgenres of kirtan emerged in Vaishnavism, namely the Nama-kirtana wherein the different names or aspects of god (a Vishnu avatar) are extolled, and the Lila- kirtana wherein the deity's life and legends are narrated. The Marathi Varkari saint Namdev (c. 1270‚Äì1350) used the kirtan form of singing to praise the glory of god Vithoba, an avatar of Vishnu. Marathi kirtan is typically performed by one or two main performers, called kirtankar, accompanied by harmonium and tabla. It involves singing, acting, dancing, and story-telling. The Naradiya Kirtan popular in Maharashtra is performed by a single Kirtankar, and contains the poetry of saints of Maharashtra such as Dnyaneshwar, Eknath, Namdev and Tukaram.Learned poets from 17th and 18th century such as Shridhar, Mahipati, Moropant contributed to the development of this form of kirtan.' 'Jugalbandi Kirtan is performed by two persons, allowing question-answer, dialogue and debate. Performance requires skill in music, dance, comedy, oratory, debate, memory, general knowledge and Sanskrit literature. Training takes place at the Kirtan Kul in Sangli, the Akhil Bharatiya Kirtan Sanstha in Dadar, Mumbai, the Narad Mandir at Sadashiv Peth, Pune and the Kalidas Mahavidyalay in Ramtek, Nagpur as well as at smaller schools in Goa, Beed and Ujjain. In the early 16th century CE Chaitanya Mahaprabhu popularized adolescent Krishna based san- kirtana in Bengal, with Hare Krishna mantra and other songs, wherein the love between Radha and Krishna was symbolized as the love between one's soul and God. About the same time, Shankaradeva in Assam inspired Neo-Vaishnavite Bhakti movement that emphasized Advaita Vedanta philosophy within the framework of Bhagavata Purana and Vaishnavism. Shankaradeva helped establish Sattras (Hindu temples and monasteries) with kirtan-ghar (also called Namghar), for singing and dramatic performance of Krishna-related theosophy. Elsewhere, in Vrindavan of Braj region (Mathura), Vallabha launched a Kirtan singing devotional movement around the stories of baby Krishna and his early childhood, in early 16th century. ===Carnatic traditions=== In Andhra Pradesh, the compositions of Tallapaka Annamacharya, a 14th-century mystic, represent the earliest known music called sankirtana. He wrote in praise of Lord Venkateswara, the deity of Seven Hills in Tirumala, where unbroken worship has been offered for over twelve centuries at the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple. Annamcharya is believed to be the incarnation of Lord Venkateswara's sword.SVSA-2008/07/21 During his long and prolific career, he reputedly composed and sang 32,000 Sankirtanas and 12 Shatakas (sets of hundred verses). His works were in Telugu and Sanskrit. ===Bhajan versus Kirtan=== A Kirtan and a Bhajan are closely related, with both sharing common aims, subjects, musical themes and being devotional performance arts. A Bhajan is more free form, can be singular melody that is performed by a single singer with or without one and more musical instruments. Kirtan, in contrast, differs in being a more structured team performance, typically with a call and response musical structure, similar to an intimate conversation or gentle sharing of ideas, and it includes two or more musical instruments, with roots in the prosody principles of the Vedic era. Many Kirtan are structured for more audience participation, where the singer calls a spiritual chant, a hymn or a devotional theme such as from Vaishnavism, the audience then responds back by repeating the chant or by chanting back a reply of their shared beliefs. ==In Sikhism== Kirtan refers to devotional singing in Sikhism. It is typically performed at Gurdwaras (Sikh temples). Sikh scriptures and legends are usually recited in a song, to a certain raga and accompanied with musical instruments. The Gurus themselves created numerous musical instruments including the Dilruba, the Sarangi, the Esraj and a modification of the Pakhawaj creating an early form of the Tabla. A Shabad Kirtan refers to the musical recitation of the Guru Granth Sahib, the primary scripture in the Sikhism tradition which is arranged according to raga. The Shabad Kirtan can be listened to silently or sung along with the gathered congregation. Kirtan in Sikh history has been the musical analog of Kathas recitation, both preferably performed by ragi jatha, or professional trained performers. A Sikh Kirtan is a religious, aesthetic and social event, usually held in a congregational setting on Sundays or over certain festivals to honor the historical Gurus, but major temples in the Sikh tradition recite Kirtan everyday as a mark of daily bhakti (devotional remembrance) of God's name. The congregational setting is called a Sangat or Satsang, a word that in ancient Indian texts means \\"like minded individuals, or fellow travelers on a spiritual journey\\". ==In Buddhism== According to Guy Beck, the music tradition did not develop in early Buddhism possibly because it was considered sensual and inconsistent with its core teachings. Later Buddhism did develop monastic chanting of the canonical literature, particularly in the ritualistic Vajrayana and other Mahayana traditions. Chants, songs and plays about the life of the Buddha by the Buddhists of Bengal were called Buddha-samkirtan. ==In the west== Paramahansa Yogananda, a Bengali saint was an early proponent of kirtan in the west, chanting Guru Nanak Dev's Hey Hari Sundara (\\"Oh God Beautiful\\") with 3,000 people at Carnegie Hall in 1923. Kirtan became more common with the spread of Gaudiya Vaishnavism by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness's (ISKCON) founder A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in the 1960s. Kirtan singers have appeared in the West, such as Krishna Das, Bhagavan Das, Wah! and Jai Uttal as well as Snatam Kaur, Lokah Music, Deva Premal, Jim Gelcer, Jyoshna, Aindra Das, Gina Sala', and Gaura Vani & As Kindred Spirits. Yoga centers report an increase in attendance at kirtan; according to Pure Music‚Äôs Frank Goodman in conversation with Krishna Das in 2006, kirtan has taken on a wider popularity. There are also Kirtan singers in the west who sing authentic traditional Indian style Kirtans such as Kamini Natarajan and Sheela Bringi. In the United States case law, the term sankirtana has also been used to refer to evangelical activities of ISKCON.Supreme Court of California, opinion in ISKCON v. City of Los Angeles, pages 4, 7 online ISKCON had sought the right to perform sankirtana in California airports such as in Los Angeles. The court ruled that while ISKCON has a constitutional rights of protected speech, the Los Angeles airport also has a right to forbid any form of solicitation, out of \\"a legitimate interest in controlling pedestrian congestion and reducing the risk of fraud and duress attendant to repetitive, in-person solicitation of funds\\" by all groups including ISKCON.Supreme Court of California, opinion in ISKCON v.

As a part of the Mississippi River system, its waters eventually reach the Gulf of Mexico. ==Course== The Sweetwater rises in southwestern Fremont County, at the continental divide near South Pass Wyoming, on the southern end of the Wind River Range. It flows ENE along the north side of the Antelope Hills, then ESE, through Fremont County, past Jeffrey City, between the Granite Mountains to the north and the Green Mountains (Wyoming) to the south, through what are now cattle-raising areas. In southern Natrona County, it passes Devil's Gate and Independence Rock along the Oregon, California and Mormon Trails, and empties into the North Platte as the Sweetwater arm of Pathfinder Reservoir. ==History== The Sweetwater River valley provided a route used by fur trappers, mountain men and fur traders as they went to their annual summertime Rocky Mountain Rendezvous located usually somewhere along the Green River Wyoming. These trappers and traders soon established a path for their pack trains along the Sweetwater and eventually cleared a rough wagon trail to the Green River. In fall of 1823, trappers and fur traders Jedediah Smith and Thomas Fitzpatrick led their trapping crew south from the Yellowstone River to the Sweetwater River. They were looking for a safe location to spend the winter. Smith reasoned since the Sweetwater flowed east it must eventually run into the Missouri River. Trying to transport their extensive fur collection down the Sweetwater and North Platte River, they found after a near disastrous canoe crash that the rivers in Wyoming were too swift and rough for water passage. On July 4, 1824, they cached their furs under a dome of rock they named Independence Rock and started their long trek on foot to the Missouri River via the Sweetwater, North Platte and Platte River valleys. Upon arriving back in a settled area on the Missouri River they bought pack horses (on credit) and retrieved their furs. They had re-discovered the route that Robert Stuart of the Astor Expedition had taken in 1813‚Äîeleven years before. Thomas Fitzpatrick was often hired as a trail guide when the fur trade almost ceased in 1840. Jedediah Smith was killed by Indians about 1831. By 1843 the Sweetwater River valley was a regular wagon trail providing the water, grass and fuel needed on the Oregon, California and Mormon Trails across Wyoming. The Sweetwater provided an almost direct path from the Platte and North Platte Rivers to the wide South Pass Continental Divide between the Atlantic Ocean rivers and Pacific Ocean rivers. South Pass was the easiest pass across the Atlantic and Pacific drainages. These wagon trails crossed the meandering Sweetwater River about nine times on their about 10 to 20 day trips along the Sweetwater River before they reached South Pass. The Sweetwater River's connection to the California Trail is of particular interest to members of the Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta, since it is a site where two early members met, including one of the fraternity's six founders. At a time when such a meeting was incredibly unlikely, the coincidence was so fortuitous as to be chronicled in the fraternity's history.http://www.phigam.org/page.aspx?pid=1053 ==See also== * List of rivers of Wyoming ==References== Category:Rivers of Wyoming Category:Bodies of water of Natrona County, Wyoming Category:Bodies of water of Fremont County, Wyoming Category:Tributaries of the North Platte River ","title":"Sweetwater River (Wyoming)"},{"id":"523043","text":"The fallacy of composition arises when one infers that something is true of the whole from the fact that it is true of some part of the whole. A trivial example might be: \\"This tire is made of rubber, therefore the vehicle of which it is a part is also made of rubber.\\" This is fallacious, because vehicles are made with a variety of parts, most of which are not made of rubber. The fallacy of composition can apply even when a fact is true of every proper part of a greater entity, though. A more complicated example might be: \\"No atoms are alive. Therefore, nothing made of atoms is alive.\\" This is a statement most people would consider incorrect, due to emergence, where the whole possesses properties not present in any of the parts. This fallacy is related to the fallacy of hasty generalization, in which an unwarranted inference is made from a statement about a sample to a statement about the population from which it is drawn. The fallacy of composition is the converse of the fallacy of division. ==Examples== If someone stands up out of their seat at a cricket match, they can see better. Therefore, if everyone stands up, they can all see better. Some people can become millionaires with the right business concept. Therefore, if everyone has the right business concept, everyone will become a millionaire. If a runner runs faster, he can win the race. Therefore, if all the runners run faster, they can all win the race. In voting theory, the Condorcet paradox demonstrates a fallacy of composition: Even if all voters have rational preferences, the collective choice induced by majority rule is not transitive and hence not rational. The fallacy of composition occurs if from the rationality of the individuals one infers that society can be equally rational. The principle generalizes beyond the aggregation via majority rule to any reasonable aggregation rule, demonstrating that the aggregation of individual preferences into a social welfare function is fraught with severe difficulties (see Arrow's impossibility theorem and social choice theory). ===In economics=== * The paradox of thrift is a notable fallacy of composition described by Keynesian economics. * Division of labour is another economic example, in which overall productivity can greatly increase when individual workers specialize in doing different jobs. An individual worker may become more productive by specializing in making, say, hatpins, but by satisfying the wants of many other individuals for a given product, the specialist worker forces other workers to specialize in making different things. What is true for the part (earning more by investing in the skills or equipment to make a given product faster) is not true for the whole (because not everybody can profitably make the same product). * Economists use the term representative agent to refer to the typical decision-maker of a certain type (for example, the typical consumer, or the typical firm); when this representative agent is poorly chosen in a model, it can be seen as a fallacy of composition. * In a tragedy of the commons, an individual can profit by consuming a larger share of a common, shared resource such as fish from the sea; but if too many individuals seek to consume more, they can destroy the resource. * In the free rider problem, an individual can benefit by failing to pay when consuming a share of a public good; but if there are too many such \\"free riders\\", eventually there will be no \\"ride\\" for anyone. In chemistry and materials science, a single type of atom may form allotropes with different physical properties from each other, and from their individual constituent atoms, such as diamond and graphite each consisting of carbon atoms. What is true of a single carbon atom is not true of a collection of carbon atoms bonded into a material. Furthermore, the properties of an atom differ from the properties of the individual subatomic particles that constitute it. In social network theory, a group of humans arranged into a social network can have abilities not possessed by the individual humans making up the network. A simple example is the bucket brigade, in which humans arranged into a chain can move buckets of water or other similar items across a distance faster and with less effort than can a disorganized group of individuals carrying the loads across the same distance. What is true of the part (an individual needing to move his or her body across the whole distance to move a load) is not true of the whole (in which individuals can move loads across the distance merely by standing in place and handing off the load to the next individual). ==Modo hoc fallacy== The modo hoc (or \\"just this\\") fallacy is the informal error of assessing meaning to an existent based on the constituent properties of its material makeup while omitting the matter's arrangement. For instance, metaphysical naturalism states that while matter and motion are all that compose humans, it cannot be assumed that the characteristics inherent in the elements and physical reactions that make us up ultimately and solely define our meaning; for, a cow which is alive and well and a cow which has been chopped up into meat are the same matter but it is obvious that the arrangement of that matter clarifies those different situational meanings. ==See also== *Synecdoche, the figure of speech of two forms: **Pars pro toto using the word for a part by way of referring to the whole **Totum pro parte using the word for the whole by way of referring to a part ==References== Category:Inductive fallacies Category:Verbal fallacies Category:Relevance fallacies ","title":"Fallacy of composition"},{"id":"523052","text":"The Cathedral Church of St. Barnabas in the city of Nottingham, England, is a cathedral of the Roman Catholic church. It is the mother church of the Diocese of Nottingham and seat of the Bishop of Nottingham. ==Location== It is located on the corner of Derby Road and North Circus Street, on the opposite side of which are the Albert Hall and the Nottingham Playhouse (Wellington Circus). ==History== The nave looking east The nave looking west The Blessed Sacrament Chapel It was built between 1841 and 1844, costing ¬£15,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ), and was first consecrated in 1844, fifteen years after the Catholic Relief Act ended most restrictions on Catholicism in the United Kingdom. A substantial amount of the cost was paid by the important Catholic Lord Shrewsbury. The architect was Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin who also designed the interior of The Houses of Parliament. It was built in the Early English Plain Gothic style, although in contrast, the Blessed Sacrament Chapel was richly decorated and Pugin's later churches were built in that Decorated Gothic style throughout. Pugin was retained as architect by Rev Robert William Willson, then priest in charge of Nottingham. In 1842 he was named as Bishop- Elect of Hobart, Tasmania, and had to leave the work in Nottingham before completion. Following the establishment of a new Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales in 1850 by the decree of Pope Pius IX, it was raised to cathedral status in 1852, becoming one of the first four Catholic cathedrals in England and Wales since the English Reformation.Decree of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, 21 April 1852. The other churches raised to cathedrals by this decree were St George's, Southwark, St Chad's, Birmingham and St John's, Salford: Decreta Quatuor Conciliorum Provincialium Westmonasteriensium, (2nd Edn, London: Burns & Oates), p.56; translation in: Robert Guy OSB, The Synods in English (Stratford-on-Avon: St Gregory Press, 1886) p.101. It is the seat of the Bishop of Nottingham. The cathedral is a Grade II* listed building of the lancet style of architecture, and is considered to be one of the best specimens of Pugin's work. Most of Pugin's decorative scheme was destroyed in the upheaval that surrounded the Second Vatican Council, when the old high altar was discarded, and most of the painted decoration smothered and painted plain. Other fittings removed at this time include the old cathedra, as well as the figures of St Mary and St John from the rood screen (the figures were reinstated in 1993). Buildings of England wrote: ‚ÄòThe whole effect could hardly be further from the richness of decoration and atmosphere that Pugin intended‚Äô. A fragment of the scheme is preserved in the Blessed Sacrament chapel, and is the highlight of the interior. The replacement high altar from the 1960s was replaced again in 1993 with one in a more sympathetic style. Fragments of Pugin's decoration, such as the roundels in the nave, were uncovered and restored, but most remains lost. The clergy of the Cathedral also serve the church of St. Augustine on Woodborough Road. == Cathedral music == The organ The Chapel of Our Lady The Cathedral's choral scholarships are available to students above or of eighteen years of age who are in full-time tertiary education in the Nottingham area. ===List of Directors of Music=== *Edmund Hart Turpin 1850 ‚Äì 1865 *James Turpin 1866 ‚Äì 1873Nottinghamshire Guardian ‚Äì Friday 1 August 1873 (afterwards organist of Londonderry Cathedral) *William George Taylor 1874 ‚Äì 1885History, Gazetteer & Directory of Nottinghamshire, 1885, p.445 ‚Äì 1898Wright's Directory of Nottingham, 1898‚Äì99, p.466 ‚Äì 1905 *William Francis Taylor 1905 ‚Äì 1963 Nottingham Cathedral Yesterday and Today, Edward Cocking et al. 2007 p.36 *Peter Smedley 1964 ‚Äì 2003 *Neil Page 2003 ‚Äì 2014 *Alex Patterson 2014 ‚Äì 2020. ===Assistant Directors of Music / Organists === *Peter Smedley 1954 ‚Äì 1964 *Christopher Burton 2008 ‚Äì 2010 *Paul Hayward 2011 ‚Äì 2012 *Alex Patterson 2012 ‚Äì 2014 *Eden Lavelle 2016 ‚Äì 2017 *Eleanor Martin 2019 ‚Äì present ==References== ==External links== *St. Barnabas' Cathedral Official Website *Nottingham Cathedral Music Website *Diocese of Nottingham Official Website * Audio slideshow tour of St. Barnabas' from the BBC Nottingham Nottingham Category:Tourist attractions in Nottinghamshire Category:Buildings and structures in Nottinghamshire Category:Grade II* listed churches in Nottinghamshire Category:Grade II* listed cathedrals Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1844 Category:19th-century Roman Catholic church buildings in the United Kingdom Category:Roman Catholic Diocese of Nottingham Category:Grade II* listed Roman Catholic churches in England Category:Roman Catholic churches in Nottinghamshire Category:Augustus Pugin buildings ","title":"Nottingham Cathedral"},{"id":"523060","text":"George Packer (born August 13, 1960) is an American journalist, novelist, and playwright.

The white feather is a widely recognised symbol, although its meaning varies significantly between different countries and cultures. In the United Kingdom and the countries of the British Empire since the eighteenth century it has been used a symbol of cowardice, used by patriotic groups, including prominent members of the Suffragette movement and early feminists, in order to shame men into enlisting. However, in some cases of pacifism and in the United States armed forces, it is used to signify extraordinary bravery and excellence in combat marksmanship. ==Symbol of cowardice== As a symbol of cowardice, the white feather supposedly comes from cockfighting and the belief that a cockerel sporting a white feather in its tail is likely to be a poor fighter. Pure- breed gamecocks do not show white feathers and so its presence indicates that the cockerel is an inferior cross-breed. === The Crusades === Shame was exerted upon men in England and France who had not taken the cross at the time of the Third Crusade, \\"A great many men sent each other wool and distaff, hinting that if anyone failed to join this military undertaking they were only fit for women's work\\". ===World War I=== In August 1914, at the start of World War I, Admiral Charles Fitzgerald founded the Order of the White Feather with the support of the prominent author Mrs Humphry Ward. The organisation aimed to shame men into enlisting in the British army by persuading women to present them with a white feather if they were not wearing a uniform.Guardian review of We Will Not Fight...: The Untold Story of World War One's Conscientious Objectors by Will Ellsworth-Jones\\"The White Feather Diaries\\" project Although the draft would conscript both sexes, only males would be on the front lines.\\"The Suffragette Movement\\" by Sylvia Pankhurst: \\"Mrs. Pankhurst toured the country, making recruiting speeches. Her supporters handed the white feather to every young man they encountered wearing civilian dress, and bobbed up at Hyde Park meetings with placards: \\"Intern Them All.\\"\\"The least that men can do is that every man of fighting age should prepare himself to redeem his word to women...\\" - Mrs. Pankhurst\\"Emmeline Pankhurst‚Äôs call for universal compulsory national service for both sexes\\" and \\"Female service would be played out on the floor of the factory.\\" see http://itech.fgcu.edu/&/issues/vol1/issue1/feather.htm While the true effectiveness of the campaign is impossible to judge, it spread throughout several other nations in the empire. In Britain, it started to cause problems for the government when public servants and men in essential occupations came under pressure to enlist. That prompted Home Secretary Reginald McKenna to issue employees in state industries with lapel badges reading \\"King and Country\\" to indicate that they were serving the war effort. Likewise, the Silver War Badge, which was given to service personnel who had been honourably discharged by wounds or sickness, was first issued in September 1916 to prevent veterans from being challenged for not wearing uniform. Anecdotes from the time indicate that the campaign was not popular among soldiers, not least because soldiers who were home on leave could find themselves presented with feathers. One example was Private Ernest Atkins, who was on leave from the Western Front. He was riding a tram when he was presented with a white feather by a girl sitting behind him. He smacked her across the face with his pay book and said, \\"Certainly I'll take your feather back to the boys at Passchendaele. I'm in civvies because people think my uniform might be lousy, but if I had it on I wouldn't be half as lousy as you\\".Reagan, Geoffrey. Military Anecdotes (1992) p. 63 Guinness Publishing Private Norman Demuth, who had been discharged from the British Army after he had been wounded in 1916, received numerous white feathers after he returned from the Western Front. In Forgotten Voices of the Great War, Demuth is quoted as saying: > \\"Almost the last feather I received was on a bus. I was sitting near the > door when I became aware of two women on the other side talking at me, and I > thought to myself, 'Oh Lord, here we go again'. One lent forward and > produced a feather and said, 'Here's a gift for a brave soldier. I took it > and said,'Thank you very much- I wanted one of those.' Then I took my pipe > out of my pocket and put this feather down the stem and worked it in a way > I've never worked a pipe cleaner before. When it was filthy I pulled it out > and said, 'You know, we didn't get these in the trenches', and handed it > back to her. She instinctively put out her hand and took it, so there she > was sitting with this filthy pipe cleaner in her hand and all the other > people on the bus began to get indignant. Then she dropped it and got up to > get out, but we were nowhere near a stopping place and the bus went on quite > a long way while she got well and truly barracked by the rest of the people > on the bus. I sat back and laughed like mad.\\"Max Arthur, Forgotten Voices of > the Great War (London: Random House, 2012). 18‚Äì22 Supporters of the campaign were not easily put off. A woman who confronted a young man in a London park demanded to know why he was not in the army. \\"Because I am a German\\", he replied. He received a white feather anyway.Reagan p. 55 Perhaps the most misplaced use of a white feather was when one was presented to Seaman George Samson, who was on his way in civilian clothes to a public reception in his honour. Samson had been awarded the Victoria Cross for gallantry in the Gallipoli campaign.Glanfield, John. Bravest of the Brave (2005) pp. 110‚Äì112 Sutton Publishing Roland Gwynne, later the mayor of Eastbourne (1929‚Äì1931) and a lover of suspected serial killer John Bodkin Adams, received a feather from a relative. That prompted him to enlist, and he would receive the Distinguished Service Order for bravery.Pamela Cullen, A Stranger in Blood: The case files on Doctor John Bodkin Adams, 2006. p. 626 The writer Compton Mackenzie, then a serving soldier, complained about the activities of the Order of the White Feather. He argued that \\"idiotic young women were using white feathers to get rid of boyfriends of whom they were tired\\". The pacifist Fenner Brockway claimed that he received so many white feathers that he had enough to make a fan. ===World War II=== The white feather campaign was briefly renewed during World War II.\\"Can It Be True?\\" editorial by \\"W.M.\\" from the 3 April 1940 issue of the Daily Mirror: \\"Is it possible that nitwit girls are reviving the infamous \\"white feather\\" campaign of the last war? Rumours reach us from Doncaster to the effect that certain female louts are thus insulting male workers in or out of reserved occupations\\". Referenced 29 October 2012, retrieved 29 January 2013 ==Symbol of pacifism and peace== In contrast, the white feather has been used by some pacifist organisations as a sign of harmlessness. In the 1870s, the MƒÅori prophet of passive resistance Te Whiti o Rongomai promoted the wearing of white feathers by his followers at Parihaka. They are still worn by the iwi associated with that area, and by Te Ati Awa in Wellington. They are known as te raukura, which literally means the red feather, but metaphorically, the chiefly feather. They are usually three in number, interpreted as standing for \\"glory to God, peace on earth, goodwill toward people\\" (Luke 2:14). Albatross feathers are preferred but any white feathers will do. They are usually worn in the hair or on the lapel (but not from the ear). Some time after the war, pacifists found an alternative interpretation of the white feather as a symbol of peace. The apocryphal story goes that in 1775, Quakers in a Friends meeting house in Easton, New York were faced by a tribe of Indians on the war path. Rather than flee, the Quakers fell silent and waited. The Indian chief came into the meeting house and finding no weapons he declared the Quakers as friends. On leaving he took a white feather from his quiver and attached it to the door as a sign to leave the building unharmed. In 1937 the Peace Pledge Union sold 500 white feather badges as symbols of peace. ===Other symbolism=== In the United States, the white feather has also become a symbol of courage, persistence, and superior combat marksmanship. Its most notable wearer was US Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant Carlos Hathcock, who was awarded the Silver Star medal for bravery during the Vietnam War. Hathcock picked up a white feather on a mission and wore it in his hat to taunt the enemy. He was so feared by enemy troops that they put a price on his head. Its wear on combat headgear flaunts an insultingly-easy target for enemy snipers.Charles Henderson. Marine Sniper. New York: Berkley Books, 1986. . ==Portrayals in popular cultureLiterature=== The adventure novel The Four Feathers (1902) by A. E. W. Mason tells the story of Harry Feversham, an officer in the British Army, who decides to resign his commission the day before his regiment is dispatched to fight in Sudan (the 1882 First War of Sudan, leading to the fall of Khartoum). Harry's three fellow officers and his fianc√©e conclude that he is resigning in order to avoid fighting in the conflict, and each send him a white feather. Stung by the criticism, Harry sails to Sudan, disguises himself as an Arab, and looks for the opportunity to redeem his honour. He manages this by fighting a covert war on behalf of the British, saving the life of one of his colleagues in the process. On returning to England he asks each of his accusers to take back one of the feathers. The 1907 P. G. Wodehouse novel The White Feather is a school story about apparent cowardice and the efforts a boy goes to in order to redeem himself by physical combat. In the novel Birds of a Feather by Jacqueline Winspear, four young girls take it upon themselves to hand out feathers to young men not in uniform in an effort to shame them into enlisting on Britain's side in The Great War. Rilla of Ingleside (1921) by Lucy Maud Montgomery, the penultimate book in her Anne of Green Gables series, sees Anne Shirley's son, Walter Blythe, enlist in the First World War after receiving a white feather in the mail; he subsequently dies in battle. The Man Who Stayed at Home, a 1914 play by J. E. Harold Terry and Lechmere Worrall, was renamed The White Feather when staged in North America. The title character is a British secret agent who is falsely perceived to be a coward for his refusal to enlist as a soldier. In The Camels are Coming (1932), the first-ever collection of Biggles stories, Biggles is handed a white feather by a young woman while on leave in civilian clothes, who is later taken aback to find that he is one of the Royal Flying Corps' leading pilots. In Pat Barker's 1991 novel Regeneration, the character Burns is given two white feathers during his home leave from Craiglockhart War Hospital. In the 1997 book Jingo (novel) citizens of Ankh-Morpork are handed white feathers for not enlisting to fight in the impending war against Klatch. In the 2015 graphic novel Suffrajitsu: Mrs. Pankhurst's Amazons, Christabel Pankhurst is depicted encouraging women to hand white feathers to every young man they see out of uniform. Persephone Wright, the protagonist of the story and heretofore a staunch supporter of Pankhurst's Votes for Women campaigns, rejects the idea on ethical grounds, saying \\"a man who's been shamed into service isn't a volunteer at all\\". ===Music=== The Order of the White Feather was the inspiration for the Weddings Parties Anything song \\"Scorn of the Women\\", which concerns a man who is deemed medically unfit for service when he attempts to enlist, and is unjustly accused of cowardice. In 1983, new wave band Kajagoogoo released their debut album called White Feathers, whose opener was the title track, a light-hearted allegory for weak people, whereas the final track, Frayo, had a political flavour, referencing cowardice as the cause for an unchanging war-torn world. In 1985, progressive rock band Marillion released an anti-war song called \\"White Feather\\" as the ending track to their album Misplaced Childhood. In 2009, \\"White Feather\\" was released as the third single from the Wolfmother album entitled Cosmic Egg. ===Film and television=== The novel The Four Feathers has been the basis of at least seven feature films, the most recent being The Four Feathers (2002), starring Heath Ledger. It was also parodied in the Dad's Army episode \\"The Two and a Half Feathers\\". In the 1980 BBC TV series To Serve Them All My Days, David Powlett- Jones, a shell-shocked Tommy, takes a position in a boys' school. Suspecting that fellow teacher Carter may be avoiding war duty, he muses, \\"I'd give a good deal to know whether he's really got a gammy knee\\", to which an acerbic colleague responds, \\"I suppose we couldn't get some chubby cherub to give him the white feather\\" as a means of accusing the suspected malingerer. The 2000 Canadian miniseries, Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story, includes a scene in which Anne Shirley's fiance, Gilbert Blythe, receives a white feather from a young woman, despite the fact he is a medical doctor and therefore one who provides an essential service at home. He eventually does enlist, and much of the plot deals with Anne searching for him when he's declared missing in action. As noted above, in the original novels, it is Anne and Gilbert's son, Walter, who enlists after receiving a feather. In the short-lived 2007 British period drama Lilies, the brother of the protagonists is discharged from the military during World War I after his boat sinks and he is one of a handful of shell-shocked survivors. Billy gets sent and given numerous white feathers for his perceived cowardice, and begins to hallucinate them choking him. This is a recurring theme throughout the series. In the 2010 Australian film Beneath Hill 60 about real-life soldier Oliver Woodward, Woodward, before enlisting, receives several feathers to which he jokingly states, \\"Just a few more feathers, and I'll have a whole chicken.\\" In the first episode of the second season of Downton Abbey, a pair of young women interrupt a benefit concert to hand out white feathers to the men who have not enlisted, before being ordered out by an angry Earl of Grantham. ===Comic Books=== The satirical superhero team Inferior Five includes a cowardly archer named White Feather. ==Notes== ==External links== *Order of the White Feather *Peace Pledge Union Category:Symbols Feather, white Category:Men in history ","title":"White feather"},{"id":"523070","text":"Joseph Patrick Kennedy II (born September 24, 1952) is an American businessman, Democratic politician, and a member of the Kennedy family.

In 1991 Kennedy boycotted a speech to the U.S. Congress by the United Kingdom's Queen Elizabeth II \\"in protest to the British occupation in northern Ireland\\". In March 1998, following a year of family troubles that included the skiing death of his brother Michael LeMoyne Kennedy, he announced that he planned to retire from the U.S. House, citing \\"a new recognition of our own vulnerabilities and the vagaries of life.\\" An editorial in The Boston Globe observed that \\"Kennedy has remained steadfast in his political life to issues and constituencies no poll would have led him to: the poor, the homeless, disadvantaged children, and others swamped in the current tide of prosperity.\\" He served in the U.S. House for six terms, until January 1999.

Kennedy also served on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, passing legislation to strengthen the veterans' health-care system, to investigate the causes of Gulf War syndrome, and to provide medical treatment for veterans of the Persian Gulf War. ==Citizens Energy (since 1999)Overview=== After leaving the U.S. House, Kennedy returned to Citizens Energy. (During Kennedy's terms in the U.S. House, it had been run by his brother Michael.) Citizens Energy pursues commercial ventures aimed at generating revenues that, in turn, are used to generate funds that could assist those in need in the U.S. and abroad.Katz, Marisa (2001-01-15). \\"Heat Is On, Thanks to Joe\\". The Providence Journal. It grew to encompass seven separate companies, including one of the largest energy-conservation firms in the U.S. Citizens Energy became one of the U.S.'s first energy firms to move large volumes of natural gas to more than thirty states.Citizens Energy website, \\"Natural Gas: Our Experience\\" As a precursor to market changes under electricity deregulation in the late 1990s, Citizens Energy was a pioneer in moving and marketing electrical power over the power grid.Sheingold,, Barry J. \\"Power Marketing for the People\\". Public Power (January‚ÄìFebruary 1990), pp. 24‚Äì29. In recent years, Kennedy has led the company into the renewable-energy industry, building solar farms along the East Coast and transmission lines to support charitable programs like one giving free solar panels to low-income families in California. ===Public policy=== Since 1979, Citizens Energy has provided affordable heating oil to low-income families in Massachusetts and other cold-weather states. These charitable efforts were funded largely from profitable commercial ventures and donations.Chapman, Fern Schumer (1994-07-23). \\"Joe Kennedy, The Poor Man's Oil Tycoon\\". Fortune. pp. 98‚Äì101. Since returning to Citizens Energy, Kennedy also has sought to influence energy-related public policy, challenging the Bush administration to invest in energy conservation and efficiency and renewable energy,Kennedy II, Joseph P.

Kennedy has been criticized for the salaries paid to himself and his wife.Isabel Vincent, \\"RFK son is broken up over Chavez death\\", New York Post, Mar. 2013.

The Wall Street Journal and others criticized Citizens Energy for continuing its relationship with the Venezuelan government and Venezuelan president Hugo Ch√°vez, a harsh critic of the United States.Editorial (2006-11-28).

The Boston Globe. have argued that it is hypocritical to criticize a non-profit organization for accepting oil from Venezuela while numerous other American businesses are profiting from robust trade with Venezuela and at a time when the U.S. government has cut low-income fuel assistance. Although Citgo donations reportedly dried up in 2015 owing to Venezuela's economic turmoil, the company was reported in 2009 to have donated 83 million gallons of oil over the two previous years, which was used to provide heating assistance to an estimated 200,000 families a year in 23 states.Rezendes, Michael; Bierman, Noah (2009-09-06). \\"As Joe Kennedy Considers Run, Chavez Ties Loom\\". The Boston Globe. p. 1. Kennedy has since turned into a critic of Venezuelan president Nicol√°s Maduro, the handpicked successor of Ch√°vez, accusing him of \\"stealing democracy from the people\\" and calling for Maduro's removal. ==Later political considerationsGubernatorial elections=== In 1993 a Boston Globe poll showed Kennedy within one percentage point of popular incumbent William Weld in a hypothetical gubernatorial match-up, prompting prominent state Democrats to try and recruit him for the race. Though no other Democrat was polling near Weld, Kennedy decided to forgo the race and remain in Congress. Mark Roosevelt won the nomination and lost to Governor Weld by over 40 points. Kennedy was considered the front runner for the governorship of Massachusetts in 1998, but revelations about his personal life led to a tumultuous fall in public opinion polling, and he decided against running. Kennedy explained in a VFW hall in a working-class corner of Boston that he believed he would never be able to focus his candidacy on issues: \\"The race will focus on personal or family questions. It is not fair to my family, it is not fair to the people of Massachusetts and it is not the right thing to do.\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- srv/politics/campaigns/keyraces98/stories/ma082997.htm === 2010 U.S. Senate election === With the death of his uncle U.S. senator Ted Kennedy on August 25, 2009, Kennedy's name had been mentioned as a possible candidate for his uncle's seat representing Massachusetts in the United States Senate. In an Associated Press article, Democratic strategist Dan Payne said, \\"He wouldn't be human and he wouldn't be a Kennedy if he didn't give serious consideration to running for what is known as the 'Kennedy seat' in Massachusetts.\\" However, Kennedy released a statement on September 7 explaining that he would not pursue the seat. The seat eventually went by appointment to Paul G. Kirk and later by election to Republican Scott Brown. ==Personal life== On February 3, 1979, Kennedy married Sheila Brewster Rauch (born March 22, 1949), a daughter of banker Rudolph Stewart \\"Stew\\" Rauch Jr., president then chairman of the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, and Frances Stuart Brewster. On October 4, 1980, the couple had fraternal twin sons, Matthew Skakel \\"Matt\\" Kennedy and Joseph Patrick \\"Joe\\" Kennedy III. They were legally divorced in 1991. His older son (by eight minutes), Matthew, and his wife Katherine became parents to a daughter, Lily Frances Kennedy in 2013; Matthew and Katherine then welcomed their second child, Charlotte Ethel Kennedy, in 2016\\\\. His younger son, Joseph III, and wife Lauren became parents to a daughter, Eleanor Anne Kennedy, in 2015, and a son in 2017, James Matthew Kennedy. In 1993 Kennedy asked the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston for an annulment of the marriage, feeling he was mentally incapable of entering into marriage at the time of his wedding. An annulment would have rendered the marriage void sacramentally (a church annulment does not change the legal legitimacy of a marriage) and allow Kennedy to marry Anne Elizabeth \\"Beth\\" Kelly (born April 3, 1957)‚Äîhis former staff member‚Äîin a Roman Catholic ceremony, as well as allow him to participate in other sacraments of the church, such as Holy Communion, not available to a divorced person who remarries. Rauch refused to agree to the annulment, and Kennedy married Beth in a non-Catholic civil ceremony on October 23, 1993. The Boston Archdiocese initially granted Kennedy the annulment, which was discovered by Rauch only after the decision in 1996. Sheila, who is an Episcopalian, wrote a book Shattered Faith: A Woman's Struggle to Stop the Catholic Church from Annulling Her Marriage, explaining that she was opposed to the concept of annulment because it meant in Roman Catholic theology that the marriage had never actually existed, and claiming that the Kennedy family influence made it possible to unilaterally \\"cancel\\" a 12-year marriage. A tribunal decision in favor of annulment is automatically appealed, and the decision is not effective until a second, conforming, sentence is granted. Instead of allowing the appeal to take place in the United States, Rauch appealed directly to the Holy See. The original decision was overturned by the highest appellate tribunal of the Roman Catholic Church, the Roman Rota, in 2005. Rauch was not informed of the decision by the Boston Archdiocese until 2007. As the first decision was never confirmed, there was no time at which the Church declared the marriage to be null or gave Kennedy permission to remarry. Because the Rota was sitting as a second-instance appellate court, Kennedy could appeal the decision to another Rotal panel. ==See also== * Kennedy family tree ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * *Citizens Energy Corporation *Citizens Energy Corporation profile of Kennedy * Category:1952 births Category:Hijacking survivors Category:American people of Dutch descent Category:American people of Irish descent Category:Catholics from Massachusetts Category:Businesspeople from Boston Category:Kennedy family Category:Living people Category:Massachusetts Democrats Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Massachusetts Category:Politicians from Boston Category:Robert F.

A forest is an example of an excitable medium: if a wildfire burns through the forest, no fire can return to a burnt spot until the vegetation has gone through its refractory period and regrown. In chemistry, oscillating reactions are excitable media, for example the Belousov‚ÄìZhabotinsky reaction and the Briggs‚ÄìRauscher reaction. Cell excitability is the change in membrane potential that is necessary for cellular responses in various tissues. The resting potential forms the basis of cell excitability and these processes are fundamental for the generation of graded and action potentials. Normal and pathological activities in the heart and brain can be modelled as excitable media. A group of spectators at a sporting event are an excitable medium, as can be observed in a Mexican wave (so-called from its initial appearance in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico). ==Modelling excitable media== Excitable media can be modelled using both partial differential equations and cellular automata. ===With cellular automata=== Cellular automata provide a simple model to aid in the understanding of excitable media. Perhaps the simplest such model is in. See Greenberg-Hastings cellular automaton for this model. Each cell of the automaton is made to represent some section of the medium being modelled (for example, a patch of trees in a forest, or a segment of heart tissue). Each cell can be in one of the three following states: Traveling waves in a model of an excitable medium (White ‚Äì Quiescent, Green ‚Äì Excited, Yellow ‚Äì Refractory) * Quiescent or excitable ‚Äî the cell is unexcited, but can be excited. In the forest fire example, this corresponds to the trees being unburnt. * Excited ‚Äî the cell is excited. The trees are on fire. * Refractory ‚Äî the cell has recently been excited and is temporarily not excitable. This corresponds to a patch of land where the trees have burnt and the vegetation has yet to regrow. As in all cellular automata, the state of a particular cell in the next time step depends on the state of the cells around it‚Äîits neighbours‚Äîat the current time. In the forest fire example the simple rules given in Greenberg-Hastings cellular automaton might be modified as follows: * If a cell is quiescent, then it remains quiescent unless one or more of its neighbours is excited. In the forest fire example, this means a patch of land only burns if a neighbouring patch is on fire. * If a cell is excited, it becomes refractory at the next iteration. After trees have finished burning, the patch of land is left barren. * If a cell is refractory, then its remaining refractory period is lessened at the next period, until it reaches the end of the refractory period and becomes excitable once more. The trees regrow. This function can be refined according to the particular medium. For example, the effect of wind can be added to the model of the forest fire. ==Geometries of wavesOne-dimensional waves=== It is most common for a one-dimensional medium to form a closed circuit, i.e. a ring. For example, the Mexican wave can be modeled as a ring going around the stadium. If the wave moves in one direction it will eventually return to where it started. If, upon a wave's return to the origin, the original spot has gone through its refractory period, then the wave will propagate along the ring again (and will do so indefinitely). If, however, the origin is still refractory upon the wave's return, the wave will be stopped. In the Mexican wave, for example, if for some reason, the originators of the wave are still standing upon its return it will not continue. If the originators have sat back down then the wave can, in theory, continue. ===Two-dimensional waves=== Several forms of waves can be observed in a two-dimensional medium. A spreading wave will originate at a single point in the medium and spread outwards. For example, a forest fire could start from a lightning strike at the centre of a forest and spread outwards. A spiral wave will again originate at a single point, but will spread in a spiral circuit. Spiral waves are believed to underlie phenomena such as tachycardia and fibrillation. Spiral waves constitute one of the mechanisms of fibrillation when they organize in long-lasting reentrant activities named rotors. == See also == * Autowave == Notes == ==References== * Leon Glass and Daniel Kaplan, Understanding Nonlinear Dynamics. ==External links== * An introduction to excitable media * Java applets that show excitable media in 0, 1, and 2D * CAPOW software by Rudy Rucker contains several excitable media models.

He was the sixth of eleven children to Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Skakel. Kennedy also served as the head of the non-profit organization Citizens Energy. He died in a skiing accident in 1997. ==Early life== Michael LeMoyne Kennedy was born on February 27, 1958 in Washington, D.C.. He was named after an Irish priest and a long-standing family friend, Michael Kennedy of Dungarvan in County Waterford, and Kirk LeMoyne Billings, the prep school roommate of his paternal uncle, John F. Kennedy, and a close Kennedy family friend. He was five years old when his uncle was assassinated and ten years old when his father was also assassinated. ==Education and career== He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from Harvard College in 1980, and subsequently earned his Juris Doctor from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1984. After receiving his law degree, Kennedy worked briefly for a private law firm in Boston, Massachusetts. Kennedy was the head of his brother Joe's non-profit organization, Citizens Energy Corporation, which provides heating oil and services to elderly and low-income households in Massachusetts and other cold weather states. Kennedy co-chaired the Walden Woods Project, a non-profit organization to preserve Walden Pond in Concord, Massachusetts. In 1994, he co-founded Stop Handgun Violence, a group that raises public awareness about handguns. That same year, he helped organize his uncle Ted Kennedy's re- election campaign for the U.S. Senate against Republican Mitt Romney. ==Personal life== Kennedy married Victoria Denise Gifford, daughter of former pro-football player and sportscaster Frank Gifford and Maxine Avis Ewart, on March 14, 1981, in New York City. They had one son, Michael LeMoyne Kennedy Jr. (born January 9, 1983), and two daughters, Kyle Francis Kennedy (born July 6, 1984), and Rory Gifford Kennedy (born November 14, 1987). The family resided in Cohasset, Massachusetts, until his death in December 1997. His son Michael Jr. and his wife, Mary Campbell, had one son, Michael LeMoyne Kennedy III, in 2014 and a daughter, Quinn Victoria Ethel Kennedy, in 2016. Kyle and her husband Liam Kerr were married on August 18, 2012, and had sons Conor Nash Kerr (2014) and Declan Francis Kerr (2016). A daughter, Conor's twin sister, Josephine Ethel Kerr, died in infancy in 2014. His youngest daughter, Rory, married David DiCamillo on September 30, 2016. They welcomed their first child, Jack Kennedy DiCamillo, on September 22, 2018. In 1997, the news broke that Kennedy was having an affair with the family's former babysitter. Allegations were reported that the affair had begun three years earlier, when the babysitter was 14 years old. Kennedy took and passed three polygraph tests claiming he had not had sex with the Cohasset teen until she was 16, the legal age of consent in Massachusetts at the time. Kennedy was placed under investigation for statutory rape. Shortly after the scandal began, Kennedy and his wife separated. ==Death== Last picture of Michael Kennedy, taken the day that he died. Kennedy died on December 31, 1997, in a skiing accident in Aspen Mountain, Colorado. He was playing football while on skis with several other members of the Kennedy family when, at approximately 4:15 p.m., he hit a tree. Kennedy was not wearing a helmet or other safety equipment. The family had been warned by the ski patrol to cease the activity; others have stated that the ski patrol issued no such warnings. Following the accident, Kennedy was taken to Aspen Valley Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 5:50 p.m. He was interred on January 3, 1998 in the family plot at Holyhood Cemetery in Brookline, Massachusetts. ==See also== *Kennedy family *Kennedy Curse *List of skiing deaths ==ReferencesCategory:1958 births Category:1997 deaths Category:Harvard College alumni Category:American people of Irish descent Category:Kennedy family Category:People from Washington, D.C.

A much celebrated writer, both among his contemporaries and in subsequent centuries, Ouyang Xiu is considered the central figure of the Eight Masters of the Tang and Song. It was he who revived the Classical Prose Movement (first begun by the two Tang dynasty masters two centuries before him) and promoted it in imperial examinations, paving the way for future masters like Su Shi and Su Zhe. Ouyang Xiu's interests as a writer were remarkably diverse. As a historian, he was put in charge by Emperor Renzong of Song of creating the New Book of Tang, which was completed in 1060. He also wrote in his spare time the Historical Records of the Five Dynasties, the only book in the Twenty-Four Histories to have been written in private by a single author. As a poet, he was a noted writer of both the ci and shi genres. But it was his prose writings like Zuiweng Tingji that won him the greatest acclaim. Treatises from Ouyang's voluminous oeuvre range from studies of flowers to literary criticism and political commentaries. Politically, Ouyang Xiu was one of the major proponents of the Qingli Reforms of the 1040s. When lead reformer Fan Zhongyan fell from power in 1045, Ouyang was also demoted to posts away from the capital. He returned to the central government only in 1054, and gradually moved up the bureaucratic ladder again, until in 1060 he was made the assistant councilor of the state. He retired from politics in 1071, after vehemently (and unsuccessfully) opposing the New Policies of Wang Anshi, whose career he very much helped. ==Early life== He was born in Sichuan, where his father was a judge, though his family comes from present day Jishui (then known as Luling), Jiangxi. His family was relatively poor, not coming from one of the old great lineages of Chinese society. Losing his father when he was three, his literate mother was responsible for much of his early education. He was unable to afford traditional tutoring and was largely self-taught. The writings of Han Yu were particularly influential in his development. He passed the jinshi degree exam in 1030 on his third attempt at the age of 22.Mote p. 120-121 ==Official career== After passing the jinshi exam, he was appointed to a judgeship in Luoyang, the old Tang Dynasty eastern capital. While there, he found others with his interest in the writings of Han Yu.Mote p. 121 Politically, he was an early patron of the political reformer Wang Anshi, but later became one of his strongest opponents. At court, he was both much loved and deeply resented at the same time. In 1034 he was appointed to be a collator of texts at the Imperial Academy in Kaifeng where he was associated with Fan Zhongyan, who was the prefect of Kaifeng. Fan was demoted, however, after criticizing the Chief Councillor and submitting reform proposals. Ouyang was later demoted as well for his defense of Fan, an action that brought him to the attention of other reform-minded people.Mote p. 123 Military threats from the Liao Dynasty and Xi Xia in the north in 1040 caused Fan Zhongyan to come back into favor. Fan offered Ouyang a post as secretary, but Ouyang refused. Instead, in 1041 Ouyang obtained a position preparing a catalogue of the Imperial Library. 1043 was the high point in the first half of the eleventh century for reformers. Ouyang and Fan spurred the Qingli Reforms, a ten-point reform platform.Mote p. 124 Among other things, these included improved entrance examinations for government service, elimination of favouritism in government appointments, and increased salaries.Mote p. 137 They were able to implement some of these ideas in what was later called the Minor Reform of 1043, but the emperor rescinded their changes and Fan and his group fell from power. Ouyang was demoted to service in the provinces. He returned briefly to court in 1049 but was forced to serve a two-year sabbatical during the mourning period for his mother, who died in 1052. Upon his return to government service, he was appointed to the Hanlin Academy, charged with heading the commission compiling the New Book of Tang (1060). He also served as Song ambassador to the Liao on annual visits and served as examiner of the jinshi examinations, working on improving them in the process.Mote p. 125 In the early 1060s, he was one of the most powerful men in court, concurrently holding the positions of Assistant Chief Councillor, Hanlin Academician, Vice Commissioner of Military Affairs, and Vice Minister of Revenues. Around the time of the ascension of Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1067, Ouyang was charged with several crimes, including having sexual relations with his daughter-in-law. While the charges had no credibility, the investigation alone damaged Ouyang's reputation. His request to retire was declined by the emperor,Mote p. 126 who sent him to magistrate positions in Shandong and Anhui. While a magistrate in Shandong, he opposed and refused to carry out reforms advocated by Wang Anshi, particularly a system of low- interest loans to farmers. He was finally permitted to retire in 1071. ==Prose== In his prose works, he followed the example of Han Yu, promoting the Classical Prose Movement. While posted in Luoyang, Ouyang founded a group who made his ‚Äúancient prose‚Äù style a public cause. He is listed as one of the Eight Masters of the Tang and Song. Among his most famous prose works is the Zuiweng Tingji (literally, An Account of the Old Toper's Pavilion). The Zuiweng Pavilion near Chuzhou is named in his honor whilst the poem is a description of his pastoral lifestyle among the mountains, rivers and people of Chuzhou. The work is lyrical in its quality and acclaimed as one of the highest achievements of Chinese travel writing. Chinese commentators in the centuries immediately following the work's composition focused on the nature of the writing. Huang Zhen said that the essay is an example of \\"using writing to play around\\". It was agreed that the essay was about fengyue, the enjoyment of nature. During the Qing Dynasty, however, commentators began to see past the playfulness of the piece to the thorough and sincere joy that the author found in the joy of others. ==Historian== Ouyang led the commission compiling the New Book of Tang, which completed its work in 1060. He wrote New History of the Five Dynasties on his own following his official service. The book was not discovered until after his death. As a historian, he has been criticised as overly didactic, but he played an important role in establishing the use of epigraphy as a historiographic technique. Epigraphy, as well as the practice of calligraphy, figured in Ouyang's contributions to Confucian aesthetics. In his Record of the Eastern Study he states how literary minded gentlemen might utilize their leisure to nourish their mental state. The practice of calligraphy and the appreciation of associated art objects were integral to this Daoist-like transformation of intellectual life.Carpenter, Bruce E., \\"Confucian Aesthetics and Eleventh Century Ou-yang Hsiu\\" in Tezukayama University Review (Tezukayama Daigaku Ronshu) Nara, Japan, 1988, no. 59, pp. 111‚Äì118. ISSN 0385-7743 The Ming dynasty writer Feng Menglong recorded a possibly apocryphal anecdote regarding Ouyang's writing style in his collection of short stories Gujin Tan'gai „ÄäÂè§‰ªäË≠öÊ¶Ç„Äã.È¶ÆÂ§¢Èæç„ÄäÂè§‰ªäË≠öÊ¶Ç¬∑Êõ∏È¶¨Áä¨‰∫ã„Äã Ê≠êÈôΩÂÖ¨Âú®Áø∞ÊûóÊôÇÔºåÂ∏∏ËàáÂêåÈô¢Âá∫ÈÅä„ÄÇÊúâÂ•îÈ¶¨ÊñÉÁä¨ÔºåÂÖ¨Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåË©¶Êõ∏ÂÖ∂‰∏Ä‰∫ã„ÄÇ„Äç‰∏ÄÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊúâÁä¨Ëá•ÊñºÈÄöË°¢ÔºåÈÄ∏È¶¨ËπÑËÄåÊÆ∫‰πã„ÄÇ„Äç‰∏ÄÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊúâÈ¶¨ÈÄ∏ÊñºË°óË°¢ÔºåËá•Áä¨ÈÅ≠‰πãËÄåÊñÉ„ÄÇ„ÄçÂÖ¨Êõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰ΩøÂ≠ê‰øÆÂè≤ÔºåËê¨Âç∑Êú™Â∑≤‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂÖßÁø∞‰∫ë‰ΩïÔºü„ÄçÂÖ¨Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÈÄ∏È¶¨ÊÆ∫Áä¨ÊñºÈÅì„ÄÇ„ÄçÁõ∏Ëàá‰∏ÄÁ¨ë„ÄÇ As the story goes, during one of Ouyang's trips outside the Hanlin Academy with his associates, they witnessed an unusual event: a horse became spooked, galloped down a busy street, and kicked to death a dog sleeping there. Ouyang challenged his two associates to express this event in writing. One wrote: \\"A dog was lying in the thoroughfare and was kicked to death by a galloping horse,\\" while the other wrote: \\"A horse galloped down a thoroughfare. A lying dog encountered it and was killed.\\" Ouyang teased his junior colleagues, \\"A history book in your hands would remain incomplete after ten thousand volumes.\\" When asked for his own rendering, Ouyang, replying with a smile, wrote: \\"A galloping horse killed a dog in its path.\\" ==Poetry== His poems are generally relaxed, humorous and often self-deprecatory; he gave himself the title The Old Drunkard. He wrote both shi and ci. His shi are stripped down to the essentials emphasised in the early Tang period, eschewing the ornate style of the late Tang. He is best known, however, for his ci. In particular, his series of ten poems entitled West Lake is Good set to the tune Picking Mulberries helped to popularise the genre as a vehicle for serious poetry. Ouyang's poetry, especially the mature works of the 1050s, dealt with new themes that previous poets had avoided. These include interactions with friends, family life, food and beverages, antiques, and political themes. He also used an innovative style containing elements that he had learned from his prose writing. This includes his use of self-caricature and exaggeration. Ouyang's poetry bears the characteristic of literary playfulness common to Northern Song poetry. For example, many poems have titles that indicate that they originated in rhyme games, and feature extensive rhyming schemes throughout. Below is one of the many poems Ouyang Xiu wrote about the famed West Lake in Hangzhou. ==Legacy== He died in 1072 in present-day Fuyang, Anhui. His influence was so great, even opponents like Wang Anshi wrote moving tributes on his behalf. Wang referred to him as the greatest literary figure of his age. During the Ming Dynasty, Li Dongyang, who rose to be the highest official in the Hanlin Academy, was an admirer of Ouyang Xiu, regarding him as \\"an ideal example of the scholar-official committed to both public service and literary art\\", and praising his writings for their tranquility and propriety. ==See also== *Classical Chinese poetry *Qingli Reforms *Song poetry *Twenty- Four Histories == Notes == == References  Citations = Sources === ; Books * * ; Articles * Biography by James T.C.

It is an index that measures differences in the price of goods and services, and allows for substitutions with other items as prices vary. There are many different methodologies that have been developed to approximate cost-of-living indexes. A Kon√ºs index is a type of cost-of-living index that uses an expenditure function such as one used in assessing expected compensating variation. The expected indirect utility is equated in both periods. ==Application to price index theory== The United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a price index that is based on the idea of a cost-of-living index. The U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) explains the differences: > The CPI frequently is called a cost-of-living index, but it differs in > important ways from a complete cost-of-living measure. BLS has for some time > used a cost-of-living framework in making practical decisions about > questions that arise in constructing the CPI. A cost-of-living index is a > conceptual measurement goal, however, not a straightforward alternative to > the CPI. A cost-of-living index would measure changes over time in the > amount that consumers need to spend to reach a certain utility level or > standard of living. Both the CPI and a cost-of-living index would reflect > changes in the prices of goods and services, such as food and clothing that > are directly purchased in the marketplace; but a complete cost-of-living > index would go beyond this to also take into account changes in other > governmental or environmental factors that affect consumers' well-being. It > is very difficult to determine the proper treatment of public goods, such as > safety and education, and other broad concerns, such as health, water > quality, and crime that would constitute a complete cost-of-living > framework.http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpifaq.htm#Question_4 US Consumer Price > Index FAQ question #4 ==Economic theory== The basis for the theory behind the cost-of-living index is attributed to Russian economist A. A. Kon√ºs.ILO CPI manual , 313. The theory assumes that consumers are optimizers and get as much utility as possible from the money that they have to spend. These assumptions can be shown to lead to a \\"consumer's cost function\\", C(u,p), the cost of achieving utility level u given a set of prices p.ILO CPI manual, 314. Assuming that the cost function holds across time (i.e., people get the same amount of utility from one set of purchases in year as they would have buying the same set in a different year) leads to a \\"true cost of living index\\". The general form for Kon√ºs's true cost-of-living index compares the consumer's cost function given the prices in one year with the consumer's cost function given the prices in a different year: :P_K(p^0,p^1,u)=\\\\frac{C(u,p^1)}{ C(u,p^0)} Since u can be defined as the utility received from a set of goods measured in quantity, q, u can be replaced with f(q) to produce a version of the true cost of living index that is based on price and quantities like most other price indices: :P_K(p^0,p^1,q)=\\\\frac{C(f(q),p^1)}{ C(f(q),p^0)} In simpler terms, the true cost-of-living index is the cost of achieving a certain level of utility (or standard of living) in one year relative to the cost of achieving the same level the next year. Utility is not directly measurable, so the true cost of living index only serves as a theoretical ideal, not a practical price index formula. However, more practical formulas can be evaluated based on their relationship to the true cost of living index. One of the most commonly used formulas for consumer price indices, the Laspeyres price index, compares the cost of what a consumer bought in one time period (q0) with how much it would have cost to buy the same set of goods and services in a later period. Since the utility from q0 in the first year should be equal to the utility from q0 in the next year, Laspeyres gives the upper bound for the true cost-of-living index. Laspeyres only serves as an upper bound, because consumers could turn to substitute goods for those goods that have gotten more expensive and achieved the same level of utility from q0 for a lower cost. In contrast, a Paasche price index uses the cost of a set of goods purchased in one time period with the cost it would have taken to buy the same set of goods in an earlier time period. It can be shown that the Paasche is a lower bound for true cost of living index.ILO CPI manual , 315. Since upper and lower bounds of the true cost of living index can be found, respectively, through the Laspeyres and Paasche indices, the geometric average of the two, known as the Fisher price index, is a close approximation of the true cost of living index if the upper and lower bounds are not too far apart.ILO CPI manual , 316. ==See also== * ACCRA Cost of Living Index * Bureau of Labor Statistics * Consumer price index ==References== ==External links== * Cost-of-living index in glossary, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Division of Information Services, , , Category:Price indices Category:Price index theory ","title":"Cost-of-living index"},{"id":"523116","text":"The Hansaviertel is the smallest Ortsteil (district) of Berlin and is between Gro√üer Tiergarten and the Spree River, within the central Mitte borough of Berlin.

Kennedy and Ethel Skakel. Kennedy has made documentary films that center on social issues such as addiction, nuclear radiation, the treatment of prisoners-of-war, and the politics of the Mexican border fence. Her films have been featured on many TV networks. ==Early life and education== She was born in Washington, D.C., six months after her father was assassinated. Her mother chose the name \\"Rory\\" after the last king of Ireland Rory O'Connor who ruled in the 12th century. On December 19, 1968 (a week after Rory was born), her mother took her to her father's grave at Arlington National Cemetery. Kennedy's older brother Michael LeMoyne Kennedy was assigned as her godparent by their mother. Friends of the Kennedy family said the pair spoke almost every day of their lives. When Rory was a teenager, she was arrested during a protest outside the South African Embassy. When she was 15, her brother David died from a drug overdose. Rory graduated from Madeira School and then Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. During her sophomore year there, she organized a rally in front of a Providence supermarket. In solidarity with migrant farm workers, she urged shoppers to boycott grapes. ==Career== In the 1990s, Rory and fellow Brown classmate Vanessa Vadim (daughter of Roger Vadim and Jane Fonda) formed May Day Media, a non-profit organization based in Washington, D.C. that specializes in the production and distribution of films with a social conscience. Women of Substance was Kennedy's first documentary. The film was released in 1994, and the idea came out of a paper she wrote while a student at Brown on female addicts. In 1998, Kennedy and another fellow Brown graduate Liz Garbus founded Moxie Firecracker Films, which specializes in documentaries that highlight pressing social issues. The television networks that have shown its films include: A&E;, the UK's Channel 4, Court TV, Discovery Channel, HBO, Lifetime, MTV, Oxygen, PBS, Sundance Channel, and TLC. She directed and co- produced American Hollow (1999), a film about a struggling Appalachian family that received critical acclaim and many awards. HBO broadcast the film and publisher Little, Brown and Company simultaneously released Kennedy's companion book. Kennedy presented the documentary at Wittenberg University on September 13, 2001. After the film's presentation, she answered questions. In October 2001, Kennedy traveled to Cleveland, Ohio to address the opening meeting of the National Council of Jewish Women. At the meeting, she spoke about her documentary film-production company Change the World Through Film. Kennedy directed and co-produced the Emmy Award-nominated series Pandemic: Facing AIDS (2003), which premiered at the International AIDS Conference in Barcelona, Spain, on July 8, 2002. It was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and it tells the real stories of AIDS patients outside the Western world. It was broadcast in America as a five-part series on HBO in June 2003. Kennedy directed and co-produced A Boy's Life (2004), the story of a young boy and his family in rural Mississippi. The movie premiered to rave reviews at the 2003 Tribeca Film Festival and was awarded the Best Documentary prize at the Woodstock Film Festival; it was later broadcast on HBO. When Kennedy was asked in a March 24, 2004, interview with Salon about her interest in the American South, she cited her father's experiences in the region as an inspiration and starting point.Traister, Rebecca (March 24, 2004). \\"A harrowing, inspiring Boy's Life\\" Salon. Accessed August 25, 2009. In the same article, she goes on to mention that showing class differences in American culture also motivates her. For HBO, she directed and co-produced Indian Point: Imagining the Unimaginable (2004), which was broadcast on September 9, 2004. The film takes a \\"what if\\" look at the catastrophic consequences of a radioactive release at the Indian Point Energy Center, a three-unit nuclear- power plant station, located north of midtown Manhattan, New York City, New York. Rory directed and co-produced Homestead Strike (2006) as part of The History Channel's series, 10 Days that Unexpectedly Changed America (April 2006). She was a co-executive producer for Street Fight (2005), which chronicles the 2002 Newark, New Jersey, unsuccessful mayoral campaign of Democratic Cory Booker ‚Äî then a Newark Municipal Councilman ‚Äî against Democratic eighteen-year incumbent Mayor Sharpe James. The film earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary (Feature). (Booker later won the mayoral election on May 9, 2006, against Democratic Ronald Rice; James did not seek re-election for another four-year term in 2006.) Kennedy directed and co- produced Ghosts of Abu Ghraib (2007), which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and won the 2007 Primetime Emmy Award for Best Documentary. Kennedy first learned of the Abu Ghraib prison when images came out in the media, which were accompanied by a New Yorker article by Seymour Hersh. According to Kennedy, she was \\"horrified and shocked and disgusted\\" by the images of the naked prisoners and laughing American soldiers. She conducted interviews with people who were present at the prison along with those directly involved in the abuse. Kennedy's opinion of the participants changed after she interviewed them, where she began feeling they \\"were very humane and very much like me\\" and discovered they \\"were not monsters.\\" She directed Thank You, Mr. President: Helen Thomas at the White House for HBO Documentary Films, which premiered on HBO on August 18, 2008. According to reviews, the 40 minute long documentary provided an interesting, if brief, glimpse into the iconic journalist. On June 30, 2009, Kennedy was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Kennedy directed The Fence (La Barda), which premiered at the opening night of The Sundance Film Festival 2010. The film made its debut on HBO on September 16, 2010. Favorably received, it details the woeful inadequacies of the border fence between the United States and Mexico, which has increased migrants' deaths, but does not deter illegal immigration. In 2011, she produced and directed Ethel, which was a documentary about her own mother. The movie premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival and aired on HBO on October 18, 2012. Reviews portrayed the documentary as a moving tribute, but criticized its lack of depth. Kennedy conducted interviews with her siblings over five days at the Kennedy family compound in Hyannis Port. For the finished film, she went through \\"some 100 hours\\" of archive footage, photos and home videos. Last Days in Vietnam was directed by Kennedy and co-produced with Keven McAlester; the documentary film debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2014. During production of the film, she spoke with U.S. military and Vietnam nationals now in the U.S. and said the most exciting part of the film to her was \\"telling the untold stories about Americans and Vietnamese who were on the ground, who went against U.S. policy and risked their lives to save Vietnamese\\". Kennedy was reported to have signed with Nonfiction Unlimited in May 2014. In September 2014, Last Days in Vietnam opened at the Nuart Theater in Los Angeles. Kennedy had difficulty getting some of the people featured in her film to get involved. Out of them, she believed Henry Kissinger had the most reluctance to the project. On their reluctance, Kennedy stated: \\"I think a lot of those folks suffered post- traumatic stress from that moment. When I asked them to relive it, it really took a toll. Many of the people told me it took them a week to recover from the interviews. I've gotten tons of emails from people in Vietnam who can't see the film because it's too traumatic for them.\\" Last Days in Vietnam was nominated as Best Documentary Feature for the 87th Academy Awards. ==Activism and politics== Kennedy advocates for several social activism organizations and sits on the board of numerous non-profit organizations. In March 2010, Kennedy gave a presentation at The Ritz-Carlton, where she spoke on the effects of alcohol and drug abuse and concluded that addiction and domestic violence \\"are intricately connected.\\" She also voiced her support of treatment options, calling them \\"more important than the criminal justice approach\\". Executive director and CEO of Comprehensive Alcoholism Rehabilitation Programs Robert Bozzone agreed with her opinion and added, \\"If you listen to Rory, treatment is more effective than incarceration. Referring to the shooting of Michael Brown, Kennedy believed the reason it garnered national media attention \\"is that it's a touch point that indicates a larger social challenge that we all need to mull over and try to grapple with in a thoughtful and considerate way, and I think it has to do both with race and class.\\" On January 11, 2019, Kennedy co-authored a Rolling Stone opinion piece with Red Hot Chili Peppers singer Anthony Kiedis and the Malibu Foundation's Trevor Neilson on the current climate crisis. ===2008 Barack Obama endorsement=== Kennedy announced her support of Barack Obama as the Democratic Party's nominee in the 2008 U.S. presidential election in an op-ed essay, \\"Two fine choices, one clear decision - Obama\\", in the San Francisco Chronicle stating: Kennedy subsequently endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016. ==Personal life== Following graduation, Kennedy moved to New York and then briefly to Los Angeles. Kennedy's brother Michael LeMoyne Kennedy died in December 1997 as a result of a skiing accident. She was with him at the time of the accident and tried to save his life by giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Despite her efforts, he had been fatally injured and his blood stained her mouth. Kennedy attended his funeral in January 1998. On August 2, 1999, Kennedy married Mark Bailey in Greece at the mansion of shipping tycoon Vardis Vardinoyiannis. Kennedy met Bailey in Washington through mutual friends after graduating from Brown University. The wedding was originally scheduled for July 17 in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, but was postponed after the plane carrying her cousin John F. Kennedy, Jr. and his wife and her sister crashed en route to the event. The tent intended for the wedding became a site for family prayers during the search for her cousin. In October 1999, Kennedy and her husband moved with their dog Clementine to a new home in a West Village neighborhood they reportedly \\"loved.\\" Rory and Mark have two daughters, Georgia Elizabeth Kennedy-Bailey (b. 2002) and Bridget Katherine Kennedy-Bailey (b. 2004), and one son, Zachary Corkland Kennedy-Bailey (b. 2007)Beggy, Carol and Mark Shanahan, Mark (July 17, 2009). \\"Busy Moore Takes Time to Sing Local Costar's Praises\\". The Boston Globe. Accessed August 25, 2009. Around the time of the birth of her second daughter in 2004, Kennedy and her husband purchased a home. Kennedy went on maternity leave from her filmmaking career for the birth of her son in 2007. She sold her Shelter Island home in December 2009. Rory's nephew Conor dated Taylor Swift in 2012. According to her mother Ethel, Swift began associating with the family after Rory attended a concert of hers with her daughters, Georgia and Bridget. Kennedy said she loved the singer and her music. In July 2012, Kennedy's sister Kerry swerved her Lexus SUV into a tractor-trailer on Interstate 684. During the trial in February 2014, Kennedy defended her sister by insisting that she had \\"reputation for sobriety and general healthy living\\". According to Trulia.com, Kennedy purchased a home in Malibu, California, in January 2013 and currently resides there. == Public image == Prior to the 1990s, Kennedy was said to have been known solely for being the child who was born after the assassination of her father, Robert F. Kennedy. Following the plane crash of her cousin John F. Kennedy, Jr., she established notability for being the cousin whose wedding he planned to attend. Anita Gates of The New York Times wrote that Kennedy would understandably want to be known as \\"the one who became a filmmaker.\\" She has elicited sympathy in some corners. Edward Klein wrote in his book The Kennedy Curse: Why Tragedy Has Haunted America's First Family for 150 Years that Rory Kennedy \\"had suffered more from the Kennedy Curse than any other member of the family.\\" Klein then listed the deaths of her father and brother David, as well as her role in unsuccessfully attempting to save the life of her brother Michael Kennedy. Kennedy has spoken of her work and its relation to that of her father. \\"I don't think of it as a continuation of his work, but I certainly think I was influenced by the person that he was and have made a range of choices because of what he contributed to the world. I have enormous respect for all that he accomplished in his short life and how much he was able to move people and touch people. I've certainly been inspired by that.\\" On January 14, 2010, Full Frame announced Kennedy and Liz Garbus would be the recipients of that year's Career Award. In the press release, Full Frame called the duo's work \\"unique\\". ==WorksBibliography=== *Kennedy, Rory; Lehman, Steve; Bailey, Mark (1999). American Hollow. Boston.

The project was named for Robert Rochon Taylor, an African- American activist and the first African American chairman of the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA).PRESERVATION CHICAGO Chicago‚Äôs Seven Most Threatened Buildings It was a part of the State Street Corridor which included other CHA housing projects: Stateway Gardens, Dearborn Homes, Harold Ickes Homes, and Hilliard Homes. ==History== Robert Taylor Homes were completed in 1962 and named for Robert Rochon Taylor (1899‚Äì1957), an African American activist and Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) board member who in 1950 resigned when the city council refused to endorse potential building locations throughout the city of Chicago that would induce racially integrated housing.Blackpast - Taylor, Robert Rochon (1899-1957) At one time, it was the largest public housing development in the country, and it was intended to offer decent affordable housing. It was composed of 28 high-rise buildings with 16 stories each, with a total of 4,415 units, mostly arranged in U-shaped clusters of three, stretching for two miles (three kilometers). ==Problems== The Robert Taylor Homes faced many of the same problems that doomed other high-rise housing projects in Chicago such as Cabrini‚ÄìGreen. These problems included drug dealing, drug abuse, gang violence, and the perpetuation of poverty. Planned for 11,000 inhabitants, the Robert Taylor Homes housed up to a peak of 27,000 people.Robert Taylor Homes, Chicago Housing Authority Six of the poorest US census areas with populations above 2,500 were found there.Inventing Black-on-Black Violence: Discourse, Space, And Representation - David Wilson Including children who are not of working age, at one point 95 percent of the housing development's 27,000 residents were unemployed and listed public assistance as their only income source,\\"Midst the Handguns' Red Glare - Chicago's Robert Taylor Homes, a public housing development\\" and 40 percent of the households were single-parent, female-headed households earning less than $5,000 per year. About 96 percent were African-American. The drab, concrete high-rises, many blackened with the scars of arson fire, sat in a narrow stretch of slum. The city's neglect was evident in littered streets, poorly enforced building codes and scant commercial or civic amenities. Aside from neglect and ignoring crime, police officers also felt unsafe in darkened hallways and were frequently shot at from the high rises. In the Robert Taylor Homes a survey was conducted and showed that the majority of residents either had a family member in prison or expected one to return from prison within two years. This caused issues when residents tried to relocate; many of these returning prisoners had partners, children and/or mental illnesses that prevented them from relocating to another residence.The Robert Taylor Homes Relocation Study ===Gang violence and drugs=== The Mickey Cobras (MC's), Gangster Disciples (GDs), and Black Disciples (BDs) gangs dominated the housing project. Police intelligence sources say that the elevated number of homicides was the result of gang \\"turf wars\\", as gang members and drug dealers fought over control of given Chicago neighborhoods. The CHA estimated that $45,000 in drug deals took place daily. Former residents of the Robert Taylor Homes have said that the drug dealers fought for control of the buildings. In one weekend, more than 300 separate shooting incidents were reported in the vicinity of the Robert Taylor Homes. Twenty-eight people were killed during the same weekend, with 26 of the 28 incidents believed to be gang-related. ===Crime=== Numerous crimes occurred in the Robert Taylor Homes, reaching at an all‚Äìtime high in the mid‚Äì1970s. Most crimes committed at the housing project were drug and street gang violence related. In October 1976, 22‚Äìyear- old Denise Dozier was thrown from a 15th floor apartment window at the project; she survived the incident. On June 25, 1983, 18 month-old Vinyette Teague was abducted from the project after her grandmother left her alone in the hallway for a few minutes to answer a phone call. An estimated 50 people were in the hallway at the time of the abduction, but police were unable to gather enough evidence to make any arrests. She has never been seen or heard from since.The Charley Project: Vinyette Trudy Teague On August 15, 1991, shortly before midnight, CHA police officer Jimmie Haynes was fatally wounded by a sniper rifle at the project. He died two days later at Mercy Hospital and Medical Center. Three suspects were charged with his murder. A maintenance worker at the project was beaten to death by gang members after he allowed police officers access to a building where a gang meeting was taking place in February 1993. ==Redevelopment== In 1993, it was decided to replace all Robert Taylor Homes with a mixed-income community in low-rise buildings as part of a federal block grant received for the purpose from the HOPE VI federal program. In 1996, HOPE VI federal funds were granted specifically for off-site Taylor replacement housing. The Chicago Housing Authority moved out all residents by the end of 2005. On March 8, 2007, the last remaining building was demolished. As of 2007, a total of 2,300 low-rise residential homes and apartments, seven new and renovated community facilities, and a number of retail and commercial spaces are to be built in place of the old high-rise buildings. The development costs are expected to total an estimated $583 million. Part of the redevelopment is the renaming of the area to \\"Legends South\\". ==Notable residents== The Robert Taylor Homes were also home at one time to: * Mr. T (Lawrence Tureaud), actor and former wrestler.Chicago Tribune - Still Mr. T: The \`T' is for testimony: Willow Creek Community Church hosts the 1980s TV star as he tells how his faith has helped him overcome poverty and withstand cancer - October 01, 2004 * Kirby Puckett, baseball player. * Deval Patrick, 71st Governor of Massachusetts (2007-2015). *Corey Holcomb, comedian and actor. *Open Mike Eagle, Hip-hop artist. * Ronnie Lester, NBA basketball player and executive *Beauty Turner, writer and community activist. *Maurice Cheeks, basketball player.Chicago Tribune - Slaying Of Nba Player\`s Brother Baffles Family, Police - October 07, 1991 *Kenny Duckworth, Kendrick Lamar's father. *Michael Colyar, comedian and actor. *Aaron Chapman, Blues artist, lead singer, guitarist, for 3rd Degree Blues. is *Aaron Chapman, Blues artist 3rd Degree Blues band ==Research== Because of the standardized housing and near homogeneous demographics, the RTH cluster was an ideal location for studying the effects of urban living and lack of \\"green space\\" on the human condition. This type of research in environmental psychology was most clearly demonstrated by a group of studies done by Frances Kuo and William Sullivan of the Landscape and Human Health Laboratory (formerly the Human-Environment Research Laboratory) at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. The history and economy of this housing development was studied by Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh in his book American Project (). In his 2008 book Gang Leader For A Day: A Rogue Sociologist Takes To The Streets (), Venkatesh also profiled the area, its residents and the \\"Black Kings\\", a Chicago gang known for selling drugs. The \\"Black Kings\\" were renamed for the book to preserve anonymity, although it is likely referential to the Gangster Disciples. Although not about the Robert Taylor Homes, author Alex Kotlowitz wrote about the Chicago Housing Authority, the demographics and the history of the Chicago Housing projects in his book There Are No Children Here (). The book discusses the Henry Horner Homes, but also looks at and discusses the issues within the entire area. The housing development was the subject of a PBS documentary called Crisis On Federal Street which aired nationally in August 1987.Chicago Tribune: Human Story At Robert Taylor Homes (September 07, 1987) ==References== ==External links== *CHA's official Robert Taylor Homes site *\\"Midst the Handguns' Red Glare - Chicago's Robert Taylor Homes, a public housing development\\", Summer, 1999. *Farewell to the High-rise - the last days of Chicago's Robert Taylor Homes *Robert Taylor Homes website at Emporis *Encyclopedia of Chicago entry on Robert Taylor Homes *\\"Dislocation\\", a film by Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh, Professor of Sociology and African-American Studies at Columbia University, which \\"chronicles the lives of tenants in one building as they move through the six-month relocation process\\" according to the website's description. *A history of the building's namesake Robert Taylor *Robert Taylor Homes Bows Out photos by ChicagoEye (Lee Bey).

The bridge forms part of the road network leading from the central business district, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and Cross City Tunnel to the Inner West and Northern Suburbs. ==History Glebe Island Bridges === There were two bridges over Johnstons Bay before the construction of the Anzac Bridge. The first bridge was constructed as part of a project to move the abattoirs out of central Sydney, and to construct public abattoirs at Glebe Island. The first pile of the original bridge was driven in October 1860. The bridge was opened in 1862 and was a timber beam bridge long and wide with a swing section on the eastern side. It replaced a double steam punt crossing. The second Glebe Island Bridge was an electrically operated swing bridge opened in 1903, the year after the opening of the new Pyrmont Bridge over Sydney's Darling Harbour, which has a similar design. The bridge was designed by Percy Allan of the New South Wales Public Works Department who also designed the Pyrmont Bridge. Delays due to increasing traffic, which were exacerbated by having to close a major arterial road to allow the movement of shipping into Blackwattle Bay, led to the construction of the present-day Anzac Bridge. The 1903 bridge is still standing, but there is no access to pedestrians or vehicular traffic. === Anzac Bridge === The stay cable design concept development and final design for the new bridge were carried out by a team from the NSW Roads & Traffic Authority, led by their Chief Bridge Engineer Ray Wedgwood and the construction by Baulderstone. The bridge was opened to traffic on 3 December 1995 as the Glebe Island Bridge. The bridge was given its current name on Remembrance Day in 1998 to honour the memory of the soldiers of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (known as Anzacs) who served in World War I. An Australian Flag flies atop the eastern pylon and a New Zealand Flag flies atop the western pylon. A bronze memorial statue of an Australian Anzac soldier (\\"digger\\") holding a Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifle in the \\"rest on arms reverse\\" drill position was placed on the western end of the bridge on Anzac Day in 2000. A statue of a New Zealand soldier was added to a plinth across the road from the Australian Digger, facing towards the east, and was unveiled by Prime Minister of New Zealand Helen Clark in the presence of Premier of New South Wales Morris Iemma on Sunday 27 April 2008. == Description == The bridge is wide and the main span is long. The reinforced concrete pylons are high and support the deck by two planes of stay cables. Initially the stay cables were plagued by vibrations which have since been resolved by the addition of thin stabilising cables between the stay cables. There is a grade-separated shared pedestrian footpath and cycleway located on the northern side of the bridge, making possible a leisurely 30-to-40-minute walk from Glebe Point Road, down Bridge Road, over the bridge and round Blackwattle Bay back to Glebe Point Road. The bridge can carry a maximum of 180,000 cars per day. It reached its maximum capacity in 2002, only seven years after it was finished. The bridge is regularly patrolled by security guards as a counter-terrorism measure. Security cameras also monitor the walkway. The bridge has a speed limit of : it was reduced from in January 2005. Also prior to that date, the bridge had seven traffic lanes (4 eastbound, 3 westbound). Originally, there were bus stops at the western end of the bridge, but they were removed because buses pulling out from the stops created a hazard as they merged with other traffic moving at (or close to) the speed limit. The Australian Anzac statue on the northern side of the bridge is adjacent to the former city-bound bus stop; the New Zealand Anzac statue was installed within the ramp area of the former stop on the southern side. ==Use in popular culture== The bridge has been used in a number of artistic works including: * The bridge was used in the Looking for Alibrandi (1999) movie scene where the title character, Josephine Alibrandi, and her date Jacob Coote rode across the bridge on Jacob's motorcycle. * Deni Hines' song \\"It's Alright\\" (1995) features the nearly completed bridge in the music video group dance sequences, the filming of which taking place a few months before the bridge's December 1995 opening. * You Am I's song \\"Purple Sneakers\\" from the band's album Hi Fi Way (1995) opens with the lyric \\"Had a scratch only you could itch, underneath the Glebe Point bridge\\". The Glebe Island Bridge was still under construction when Tim Rogers wrote and recorded the song in 1994, with the bridge's name change to 'Anzac Bridge' not occurring until 1998. ==Gallery== Atop the anzac bridge.jpgAnzac Bridge pylons and cables Anzac Bridge East.jpgAnzac Bridge at dusk.

It is endemic to a small dune ecosystem in Southern California that used to be a community called Palisades del Rey, close to the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). In 1976 it became a federally designated endangered species.Traci Watson:Rare Butterflies Flying High at Los Angeles Airport, National Geographic, 21 April 2016 This butterfly‚Äôs habitat has been substantially reduced due to urban development and invasive plants, and it now exists as a handful of populations restricted to coastal dunes in the vicinity of Los Angeles.

The largest of these is on the grounds of LAX; a further colony exists on a site within the huge Chevron El Segundo oil refinery complex, and the smallest colony is an area of only a few square yards on a local beach. The butterfly lays its eggs on coast buckwheat, which the adults also use as a nectar source. Recently, some nearby beach cities such as Redondo Beach have replaced ice plant growth near the beaches with coast buckwheat, in order to provide the butterflies with more of their natural food source. ==Population== ==Further reading== * Mattoni, Rudolf H.

Early civilizations in Mesopotamia (present day Iraq), Egypt, China and Pakistan / NW India allowed rulers and the wealthy class citizens to keep collections of wild animals. These civilizations had individuals who caught and cared for wild animals such as fish and birds. King Hammurabi (Babylonia, 1728-1686 BC) established the first known Code of Laws, which included fees that could be charged by ‚Äúox and ass doctors‚Äù or what we know today as veterinarians Some ancient collections of animals were very large and contained a wide variety of species, although specific details of these collections were not recorded. Many cultures such as the Chinese, Egyptians, Persians, Greeks, Arabian, and India collected. Little is known about how or where they kept these animals, or even what the animals were. Our knowledge comes from when these animals appeared in the processionals (parades) or in the arena fights. However, there is proof that large elephant exhibits were maintained outside of Rome. There is also proof of people who cared for the sick animals (veterinarians). In the areas known as the New World, Aztec and Inca societies also maintained large animal collections. While these were only discovered in the early 16th century, they were much older than that. Montezuma (Mexico City) had the largest known collections. One collection consisted of birds and required some 300 keepers. Another collection consisted of mammals and reptiles requiring another 300 keepers. There were also fresh and salt water fish ponds. ==Duties and Responsibilities== Zookeepers with a cheetah at Australia Zoo. A zookeeper's responsibilities usually include feeding, maintaining and cleaning the animals, diet preparation, behavioral observation, record keeping, exhibit maintenance and providing environmental enrichment for the animals in their care.\\"Zoo Keeper.\\" Jobs4u Careers Database. 12 Jun. 2009. Some also conduct behavioral or reproductive research on a species and participate in public education through talks, programs or shows. They are expected to clean enclosures every day. They look for any signs of injuries or illness in the animals, and in the case of sickness or injury, the keeper is responsible for contacting a veterinarian, and sometimes a zookeeper will assist a veterinarian. Some zookeepers train the animals to make caring for them easier. For example, a zookeeper can train an elephant to lift their feet so that a veterinarian can check them more easily.Crosby, Olivia. \\"Wild jobs with wild life.\\" Occupational Outlook Quarterly Spring 45 (2001): 1-15. Some zookeepers are responsible for informing an audience, in an exhibit or presentation, about certain types of animals and their behavioral characteristics. They also talk about experiences with the animal, and answer questions. The keeper is also responsible for lecturing the visiting public on how to behave responsibly toward the exhibited animals. Depending on the zoo structure, keepers may be assigned to work with a broad group of animals, such as mammals, birds, or reptiles, or they may work with a limited collection of animals such as primates, large cats, or small mammals. Traditionally, the live exhibits were often organized by taxonomy, resulting in clusters of carnivores cages, bird aviaries, primate exhibits, and so on, which led to sections within a zoo cared for by specialized staff. Some keepers can become highly specialized such as those who concentrate on a specific group of animals like birds, great apes, elephants or reptiles. Modern habitat exhibits attempt to display a diversity of species of different animal classes within one enclosure to represent ecosystem concepts. Groups of enclosures are organized by themes, relating to, for example, zoogeography and bioclimatic zones, rather than taxonomy. The shift in exhibit arrangements is changing the scope of work for animal keepers, as they become habitat keepers, with a necessary working knowledge of living environment care, including landscape maintenance, plant care, climate control, and expanded knowledge of animals husbandry for many more species across taxonomic classes.Karsten, Peter, \\"Staff\\" in Encyclopedia of the World's Zoos, Bell, Catharine E. (ed.), Fitzroy Dearborn, Chicago, 2001, Vol.3, pp.1174-1176. ==Educational Requirements== The educational requirements for an entry level zoo keeper vary. In the USA they are often required to have completed a college degree in zoology, biology, wildlife management, animal science, or some other animal-related field. Some colleges offer programs oriented towards a career in zoos. Job advancement is also possible but more limited than in some other careers requiring a college degree. In other institutions keepers are required to have finished a full apprenticeship as craftsmen, before receiving special training for their task as animal keeper. In fact in many European countries, people intending to keep or take care of wild animals need to be licensed. This license will only be given if they can prove sufficient knowledge and practical abilities (evidence of competence). Of course in the vast array of zoos in the world, some of them are still privately owned amateur facilities with a lack of well-trained personnel. In contrast, some zoos in Australia have a strong reliance on dedicated part-time volunteer workers, who assist zookeepers in the simpler tasks such as preparation of foods and medicines, and cleaning of animal enclosures. ==Internships and Volunteer Work== In the USA, in addition to good academic preparation, most zoos prefer to hire people for zookeeping positions who have prior animal-handling experience. There are a wide variety of internships that aspiring zoo keepers can take both during and after college. Many of these internships can be found by going to a local zoo or aquarium.\\"So You Want To Be A Zookeeper.\\" St. Louis Zoo. 18 May 2009. Other internships can be found in an animal-related facility, including vet hospitals, humane society shelters, wildlife rehabilitation centers, farms and stables. Internships are an opportunity for individuals who are considering a career in animal welfare to learn more about companion animals and their behaviors. ==Notes and references== ==External links== *American Association of Zookeepers website *Association of Zoos and Aquariums *International Congress of Zookeepers website Category:Animal care occupations ","title":"Zookeeper"},{"id":"523135","text":"Edmond Dant√®s () is a title character and the protagonist of Alexandre Dumas p√®re's 1844 adventure novel The Count of Monte Cristo. Within the story's narrative, Dant√®s is an intelligent, honest and loving man who turns bitter and vengeful after he is framed for a crime he did not commit. When Dant√®s finds himself free and enormously wealthy, he takes it upon himself to reward those who have helped him in his plight and punish those responsible for his years of suffering. He is known by the aliases The Count of Monte Cristo (), Sinbad the Sailor (Sinbad le Marin), Abb√© Busoni and Lord Wilmore. == History  Dant√®s, first mate === When the reader is first introduced to Edmond Dant√®s, he arrives in Marseille as first mate aboard the merchant ship Le Pharaon (The Pharaoh). At only 19 years old, the young Dant√®s seems destined for success. Although the trip was successful, the former Captain, Lecl√®re, has fallen ill and died. Dant√®s relays these events to his patron, M. Morrel, who tells Dant√®s that he will try to have him named captain. Dant√®s rushes off to see his father and then his beloved, the young Catalan woman Merc√©d√®s, and the two agree to be married immediately. === The engagement and the arrest === The marriage never occurs, however. On the very night of their nuptial feast, Dant√®s is arrested as a suspected Bonapartist, a helper to Napol√©on, and taken to see the public prosecutor, G√©rard de Villefort. Edmond had been anonymously and falsely denounced by Danglars, Edmond's shipmate over whom he was promoted, and Fernand Mondego, a rival suitor for Merc√©d√®s' hand. Prosecutor De Villefort concludes that Edmond is innocent, and assures him that he will be released. He then asks for a piece of evidence cited in a letter denouncing Edmond to the authorities. The letter claims that on Edmond's last voyage, he made a stopover at the island of Elba, and received a letter from the deposed Emperor Napol√©on. Edmond hands over the letter, which he received in the name of Captain Lecl√®re, and of which the contents are unknown to Edmond. De Villefort throws the letter on the fire for the letter is addressed to his father. Once again he promises Edmond's speedy release. De Villefort has renounced his father, a staunch Bonapartist, and destroyed the letter to protect himself, not Edmond; to further protect his name, de Villefort sentences Edmond to imprisonment in the dreaded Chateau d'If, an island fortress from which no prisoner had ever escaped, and to which the most dangerous political prisoners are sent. === Despair and near-suicide === After six long years in solitary confinement in the dungeons of the Chateau, Edmond decides to commit suicide by starving himself. Fearing he will be forced to eat, he throws out his food in secrecy. After nearly six months, he hears scratching against the wall of his cell. Curiosity about the source of the noise inspires him to begin eating again. He taps on his wall several times, and when the scratching stops, he concludes that it is a prisoner trying to escape. He then uses the saucepan on which his food is served to begin digging where he heard the scratching before in hopes that it was another prisoner digging his way to freedom. Dant√®s eventually breaks through enough of the wall that he is able to exchange a brief greeting with an old Italian abb√© named Faria, sometimes called the \\"Mad Priest\\", who had indeed been attempting to dig to freedom. === Edmond and the Abb√© === The two prisoners become very close, with the learned priest teaching Dant√®s all he knows about reading, mathematics, science, languages, philosophy, history, sword fighting, and economics. Together, they determine who betrayed Edmond, and although Faria disapproves, Edmond plans vengeance against his betrayers. The two spend years digging a tunnel to freedom, but Faria dies before they can escape. With his dying words, he bequeaths to Edmond a secret treasure, hidden on the island of Monte Cristo. That night, Edmond exchanges himself for his mentor in the priest's bodybag, and escapes from the prison. The jailers, rather than burying prisoners, toss them over the fortress' wall into the sea, weighted with an iron ball chained around the legs. Using a knife made from a sharpened crucifix, Edmond frees himself and reaches the surface. Edmond swims to a small island nearby to seek refuge from the storm for the night. The next day, he swims out to sea as a smuggling ship passes by and is rescued under the pretense of being a shipwreck victim. Edmond soon suggests a stopover and trading of goods at the small island of Monte Cristo, during which he confirms that Faria's treasure exists. On this and subsequent visits, Edmond becomes wealthy. === Loyalty and betrayal === Upon returning to Marseille, Edmond learns that his father had died of poverty and that Merc√©d√®s had married Fernand 18 months after he was supposedly executed for treason. His old neighbour Gaspard Caderousse is still alive, and‚Äîunder the guise of the Abb√© Busoni‚ÄîEdmond visits him to learn more. Caderousse tells him that Morrel had tried to obtain a fair trial for Edmond, and how Merc√©d√®s pleaded for his release. He also learns that those who had remained loyal to him had suffered greatly, while those who had betrayed him had prospered. Edmond thanks Caderousse for the information, paying him with a large diamond that he said had come into Edmond's possession while in prison. Realizing that only Morrel had remained loyal, Edmond creates three disguises ‚Äî an Englishman named Lord Wilmore, a clerk from the banking firm Thomson and French, and Sinbad the Sailor ‚Äî and uses them to save Morrel from bankruptcy and suicide. Edmond then goes into hiding, spending nine years reforming himself as the Count of Monte Cristo. === Paris and the Count === Edmond emerges into Parisian society as the mysterious and sophisticated Count of Monte Cristo. Having purchased the deed to the island from whence he obtained his treasure, Edmond is able to place himself in the upper strata of Parisian society and assume the role of one of the most influential men in all of France. As such, he is introduced to several other powerful men, most notably Danglars, who is now a wealthy banker; Mondego, who is now Count de Morcerf and a military hero; and M. Villefort, who is now the procureur du roi, one of the most powerful advocates in the country. Furthermore, Mondego has married Merc√©d√®s, and the two have a son named Albert. Having established himself in Parisian society, and having distanced himself from Edmond Dant√®s, the Count is able to formulate his plans of revenge against the men who betrayed him. By the end of the novel, Edmond had exacted his revenge on all of the men who would have seen him rot in prison. He exposes Villefort and Mondego for their part in the conspiracy, ruining their respective reputations and bringing the police down upon them; Villefort goes insane, and Mondego commits suicide. Danglars is, for a time, captured by the Italian bandit Luigi Vampa, made to understand Edmond's suffering, and stripped of all of his wealth. Edmond, at the end of the novel, departs with Hayd√©e, leaving with words of immortal wisdom: \\"to wait and hope\\". == Portrayal in adaptations == James O'Neill, father of playwright Eugene, performed the title role over 6,000 times during his career. Edmond Dant√®s has been portrayed on film many times by actors such as George Michael Dolenz, Sr., Robert Donat, Jean Marais, Louis Jourdan, G√©rard Depardieu, Richard Chamberlain, and, most recently, Jim Caviezel. Dant√®s has also been portrayed on stage, including in a musical adaptation of the novel. In the Japanese animated television series Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo, he is voiced by J≈çji Nakata in the Japanese version and by Jamieson Price in the English dub. There are also at least three adaptations into television soap operas, the last of which being the 2006 Mexican series Montecristo. In 2011, ABC debuted the television drama Revenge, billed as a loose adaptation of Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo. In it, the character of Dant√®s is envisioned as a female protagonist by the name of Emily Thorne (portrayed by actress Emily VanCamp). He is a character in the popular mobile game, Fate/Grand Order as an Avenger Class Servant. Craig Horner portrays the Count of Monte Cristo in the second episode of the sixth season of Once Upon a Time. In the series, Edmond seeks revenge on Baron Danglars for burning down his village and murdering his fianc√©e. Edmond manages to kill him at a party. Aftwerwards, he is approached by the Evil Queen Regina who was impressed with his vengeance and hires Edmond to kill Snow White and Prince Charming. Edmond poses as a victim of the Queen and becomes Snow and Charming's wine steward, but he is hesitant to kill them after he discovers they are nice people. Edmond nonetheless prepares to poison the royal couple. As Rumplestiltskin needs them alive for his own purposes, he poisons Snow and Charming's handmaiden Charlotte, whom Edmond has fallen in love with, with poison from the Agrabahn Vipers. This forces Edmond to take Charlotte to the Land of Untold Stories where their story \\"cannot play out\\". Years later, the Evil Queen has redeemed but because of Dr. Jekyll's serum, Regina and the Queen are two separate people. Edmond is among the inhabitants of the Land of Untold Stories that are emigrated to Storybrooke with Charlotte dying from the poison. The Evil Queen takes Edmond's heart to try to force him to kill Snow and Charming. This left Regina with no choice but to kill Edmond by throwing her sword into his back == Referenced in other films == Edmond Dant√®s was referenced in the final scenes of V for Vendetta (2005); protagonist Evey Hammond describes terrorist V as Edmond Dant√®s after he martyrs himself to bring down the tyrannical Norsefire government. Earlier in the movie, V and Evey watch the 1934 film adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo, which V states is his favorite movie.

A try is scored by grounding the ball (the ball must be touching the player when coming into contact with the ground) in the opposition's in-goal area (on or behind the goal line). Rugby union and league differ slightly in defining \\"grounding the ball\\" and the \\"in-goal\\" area. The term \\"try\\" comes from \\"try at goal\\", signifying that grounding the ball originally only gave the attacking team the opportunity to try to score with a kick at goal.Rugby Heaven Extra point more than a bonus A try is analogous to a touchdown in American and Canadian football, with the major difference being that a try requires the ball be simultaneously touching the ground and an attacking player, whereas a touchdown merely requires that the player in possession of the ball enter the end zone. In both codes of rugby, the term touch down formally refers only to grounding the ball by the defensive team in their in-goal. ==Scoring a tryAspects common to both union and league=== There are differences in the fine detail of the laws and their interpretation between the two rugby codes. These are the common aspects, while the differences are treated below. *The player holding the ball to score a try and the ball itself must not be in touch or touch-in-goal (including on or over the dead ball line). The touchline, touch-in-goal lines and dead ball lines count as being 'out'. There has to be contact with the ground by a player or the ball for it to be ruled in touch or touch-in-goal. Parts of the body in the air above the lines and outside the field of play or in-goal are not touch, and it is common to see players who are partly in the air over the lines still grounding the ball successfully. *The in-goal area in which the ball must be grounded includes the goal line, but not the touch-in- goal and dead ball lines. *Grounding the ball in both codes means either holding it and touching it to the ground in-goal, or placing hand, arm or front of body between waist and neck (the front torso) on top of the ball which is on the ground in-goal. *A player does not need to be holding the ball to ground it. If the ball is on the ground or just above it, it can be touched to the ground with a hand, arm or front torso. Match officials interpret dropping the ball in-goal as a knock-on, and disallow a try. For a try to be awarded, they consider whether the player had the intention to ground the ball and was in control of the ball when he did. Grounding of the ball can be instantaneous, it does not matter if the player immediately lets go and the ball then bounces forward. *An attacking player who falls to the ground before reaching the goal line scores a try if momentum carries the player so that the ball touches the in-goal, including the goal line. ===Variations specific to rugby union=== *A player may ground the ball in one of two ways: 1) if the ball is held in the hand(s) or arm(s), merely touching the ball to the ground in-goal suffices and no downward pressure is required; 2) if the ball is on the ground in-goal, downward pressure from the hand(s), arm(s) or upper body (waist to neck) is required. For a try to be awarded, an attacking player must ground the ball before a defender does so. If there is doubt about which team first grounded the ball, the attacking team are awarded a 5-metre scrum. *A player who is in touch or touch-in-goal, but who is not carrying the ball, may score a try by grounding the ball in-goal. *The goal-posts and padding at ground level are part of the goal line and therefore of the in-goal, so a try may be scored by grounding the ball at the foot of the posts. *A player may ground the ball in a scrum as soon as the ball reaches or crosses the goal line. (The laws governing the scrum do not apply to the in-goal area, so as soon as the ball crosses the line, players may unbind and ground the ball.) *If an attacking player is tackled short of the goal-line but immediately reaches out and places the ball on or over the goal-line, a try is scored. (This is a direct contrast to rugby league, which would award a penalty for \\"double movement\\", see below. There is occasionally confusion amongst spectators and players at community levels of the game and an incorrect protest of \\"double movement\\" is a common one at English rugby union matches. A \\"double movement\\" in rugby union involves movement of the torso, rather than arms only.) *If a television match official (TMO, or video referee) has been appointed, the referee may ask for advice before deciding whether to award a try, but under current protocols the TMO may only advise on whether the ball was properly grounded, on whether the ball or ball-carrier went into touch or touch-in-goal in the act of scoring; and on any foul play that may have occurred. ===Variations specific to rugby league=== Shaun Ainscough dives for the line to score a try in the 2009 Challenge Cup for Wigan during their victory over Barrow Raiders *The laws of rugby league still refer to the need for \\"downward pressure\\" to be exerted in grounding the ball with hand or arm. *The laws of rugby league specify that a try is scored if an attacker grounds the ball simultaneously with a defender. *An attacking player whose momentum does not allow the ball to reach the try-line or in-goal after their ball- carrying arm touches the ground may not reach out to score if a defender is in contact with them; this is disallowed by interpretation as a \\"double movement\\". *Players who are in touch-in-goal and not carrying the ball may not score a try by pressing a loose ball still in play to the ground. *A try may not be scored in a scrum which crosses the goal line, but when the ball comes out of scrum a player may pick it up and 'bore through' their own scrum to score a try. *Video referees in rugby league are given a wider scope to look at the validity of a try. If the onfield referee is unsure or needs clarification, they may refer to the video referee to award a possible try. This referral must also be sent with the onfield referees opinion on whether the play is a 'Try' (signaled by forming a 'T' with their forearms) or 'No Try' (signaled by folding their arms across the shoulders). The video referee must then find evidence to support the opinion, or conclusive evidence against the opinion. In the event the video referee cannot prove or deny the opinion, the original opinion is upheld. ==Point value== In rugby union, a try is worth five points, in rugby league, four. Although a try is worth less in rugby league, it is more often the main method of scoring due to the smaller value of a goal kick and surety of possession. In rugby union, however, there is heavier reliance placed on goals to accumulate points at elite levels due to the significant value of goals and the defending team's skills. In rugby union, the value of a try has varied over time, from none to five points. In rugby league, the original value was three; this was increased to four in 1983. For the 2015‚Äì16 Welsh Premier Division season, World Rugby and the Welsh Rugby Union experimented with the awarding of six points for a try, along with other scoring changes. The intended result of a faster, more running-focussed game was not realised and the changes were reverted the following year. ==Penalty try== In both rugby league and rugby union, if the referee believes that a try has been prevented by the defending team's misconduct, he may award the attacking team a penalty try. Penalty tries are always awarded under the posts regardless of where the offence took place. In rugby union, the standard applied by the referee is that a try \\"probably\\" would have been scored. The referee does not have to be certain a try would have been scored. In rugby league, the referee \\"may award a penalty try if, in his opinion, a try would have been scored but for the unfair play of the defending team\\".The International Laws Of The Game, The Rugby Football League (2002), p.13 In rugby union, a penalty try awards the attacking team 7 points, and no conversion is attempted Laws of the game Rugby Union, World Rugby (2018) In rugby league, an 8-point try is awarded if the defending team commits an act of foul play as the ball is being grounded. The try is awarded, and is followed by a conversion attempt, in-line from where the try was scored, and then a penalty kick from in front of the posts. In rugby union, foul play after a try being scored results in a penalty being awarded on the half way mark, in lieu of a kick off. A penalty try and an 8 point try are two separate results with the latter being scarcely seen in today's game. ==Conversion== Scott Daruda kicking a conversion for the Western Force In both codes, when a try is scored, the scoring team gets to attempt a conversion, which is a kick at goal to convert the try from one set of points into another larger set of points. The kick is taken at any point on the field of play in line with the point that the ball was grounded for the try, and parallel to the touch-lines. If successful, additional points are scored. For the conversion to be successful, the ball must pass over the crossbar and between the uprights. In both codes, the conversion may be attempted as either a place kick (from the ground) or a drop kick. Most players will nevertheless opt for a place kick, this being generally regarded as the easier skill. Note, however, that in both rugby sevens (usually, but not always, played under union rules) and rugby league nines, conversions may only take place as drop kicks. In rugby league, the game clock continues during preparation and execution of a conversion, with the institution of a 25-second shot clock at certain tournaments from the moment the try is awarded by the referee, within which time the conversion kick must be taken, hence a team may decline a conversion attempt if recommencing play as quickly as possible is advantageous to them. To make the conversion easier, attacking players will try to ground the ball as close to the centre of the in-goal area as possible. The attacking player will, however, ground the ball when confronted by a defender rather than risk losing the ball by being tackled or passing it to a teammate. In both rugby union and rugby league, a conversion is worth two points; a successful kick at goal thus converts a five-point try to seven for rugby union, and a four-point try to six for rugby league. ==Past to present== The in-goal area is the rectangular area from the goal line (try line) to the dead ball line. The image shows the markings of a rugby league field. In early forms of rugby football, the point of the game was to score goals. A try [at goal] was awarded for grounding the ball in the opponents' in-goal area. The try had zero value itself, but allowed the attacking team to try a kick at goal without interference from the other team. This kick, if successful, converts a try into a goal. Modern rugby and all derived forms now favour the try over a goal and thus the try has a definite value, that has increased over time and has for many years surpassed the number of points awarded for a goal. In rugby league and rugby union, a conversion attempt is still given, but is simply seen as adding extra 'bonus' points. These points, however, can mean the difference between winning or losing a match, so thought is given to fielding players with good goal-kicking skill. Since 1979, in rugby union, the \\"try\\" and \\"conversion goal\\" have been officially considered as separate scores. Before then, the converted try was officially a single score called a \\"goal from a try\\" which replaced the score of the (unconverted) \\"try\\". The change allowed the player who touched down for the try and the player who kicked the conversion to be credited separately for their portions of the score. ==See also== *Try celebration *Tambo rugby ==References== *\\"Laws of the Game: Rugby Union 2007.\\" International Rugby Board, Dublin, 2007.

It was founded in 1896 and has an enrollment of about 4,300 students studying toward bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in each of its schools or institutes: the Institute for a Sustainable Environment, the School of Arts & Sciences, the David D. Reh School of Business, the Wallace H. Coulter School of Engineering, and the Earl R. and Barbara D. Lewis School of Health Sciences. It is classified among \\"R2: Doctoral Universities ‚Äì High research activity.\\" ==History== The school was founded in 1896, funded by the sisters of Thomas S. Clarkson, a local entrepreneur who was accidentally killed while working in his sandstone quarry not far from Potsdam. When a worker was in danger of being crushed by a loose pump, Clarkson pushed him out of the way risking his own life. Clarkson was crushed against a wall by the swinging pump, sustaining severe internal injuries. He died five days later. The Clarkson family realized great wealth in the development of such quarries, and Potsdam sandstone was highly sought after by developers of townhouses in New York City and elsewhere. The family were important benefactors in the Potsdam area. The school was called the Thomas S. Clarkson Memorial School of Technology. Old Main, 2009 Clarkson University Capital Region Campus in Schenectady, N.Y., 2016 In 1913, the name was changed to Thomas S. Clarkson Memorial College of Technology, which was used in a shortened version as Clarkson College of Technology or CCT. During the first half of the 20th century the majority of the campus was located \\"downtown\\". The campus slowly expanded to an area known as the \\"Hill\\", located on the south-western edge of the village. As of 2001, almost all academics and housing had moved to the hill campus, although the university still uses the downtown buildings known as Old Snell and Old Main for administrative functions. On February 24, 1984, the school officially became Clarkson University, although the pep band's rallying cry at hockey games is still \\"Let's Go Tech!\\". The school and its hockey team have carried the nickname \\"Tech\\" since the 1896 founding. \\"CCT\\" is still printed on older school property and equipment. On Feb. 1, 2016, Union Graduate College merged into Clarkson University and became the Clarkson University Capital Region Campus in Schenectady, N.Y. ==Academics== More than 50 undergraduate majors and minors are available at the university. The university also offers master's and doctoral degrees. These degree programs are offered through the School of Arts & Sciences, David D. Reh School of Business, Institute for a Sustainable Environment, Wallace H. Coulter School of Engineering, the Earl R. and Barbara D. Lewis School of Health Sciences and the Clarkson School. Clarkson University is home to the Center for Advanced Materials Processing (CAMP). CAMP is dedicated to developing Clarkson's research and educational programs in high-technology materials processing. It focuses on developing innovations in advanced materials processing and transferring this technology to business and industry. The center receives support from the New York State Office of Science, Technology, and Academic Research for research and operating expenses as one of 14 Centers for Advanced Technology (CATs). In addition, CAMP-related work receives several million dollars each year from the federal government and private industry. Clarkson's 15 Student Projects for Engineering Experience and Design (SPEED) teams allow students across all majors to participate in hands-on, extracurricular projects. Clarkson participates in student exchange programs with many schools in Europe and Australia. One example is the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom, where students who are studying engineering come to Clarkson for a year as part of one of the exchange programs. ===Rankings=== Forbes magazine ranks Clarkson University in its top-50 list of \\"America's most entrepreneurial universities.\\" Clarkson University's Entrepreneurship Program is one of the top 15 in the nation, according to the Princeton Review's 2015 rankings. and Entrepreneur magazine's 2015 rankings. Clarkson University ranked #8 among \\"Top Salary-Boosting Colleges\\" nationwide in Money's 2015 rankings. U.S. News & World Report's 2019 rankings \\"America's Best Colleges\\" placed Clarkson University in the top 125 institutions in the nation, and a listing on the \\"Great Schools, Great Prices\\" list. Clarkson's supply chain management program was listed as one of the top 20 in the nation. The survey editors also placed Clarkson in the \\"A+ Options for B Students\\" list and on the \\"Best Colleges for Veterans\\" list in the National University category. Clarkson University graduates have some of the highest salaries in the nation, according to the 2019 College Salary Report from PayScale Inc. Clarkson's online graduate business programs #12 in the nation (U.S. News & World Report 2013). Clarkson is #20 on the Fifty Most Affordable with a Return on Investment list, Bloomberg Businessweek, 2011. Clarkson is ranked among the nation's most environmentally responsible colleges, by Princeton Review Guide to Green Colleges: 2019 edition. U.S. News & World Report's Best Graduate Schools 2019 ranks Clarkson 40th overall in Environmental Engineering. ===The Clarkson School=== The Clarkson School, a special division of Clarkson University, was founded in 1978. The School offers students an early entrance opportunity into college, replacing the typical senior year of high school with a year of college. It is one of few college early admission programs in the country that provides a real community living/learning experience on a university campus. The Clarkson School's Bridging Year is a \\"bridging year\\" between high school and college for students who are ready to enter college early. Every year 50 to 80 high school students are accepted to The Clarkson School, where they may work towards a GED and take college classes. They may also work with their high schools to complete a high school diploma or drop out of high school entirely. After they complete the program, they are given the option to enter Clarkson University with all credits from the previous year or to transfer to another school, usually as freshmen with advanced standing. Students in The Clarkson School are fully matriculated undergraduates with freshman status at the University. They take classes with other University students and usually carry a course load of 15 to 18 credits per semester for two semesters. College credits may also be given for college and Advanced Placement courses taken before entering The Clarkson School. Cross-registration at neighboring area colleges and universities can provide additional college credits, particularly in art, music and languages. These credits also appear on an official Clarkson University transcript. The Clarkson School students are housed in Newell House and Ormsby House in Price Hall and the typical class size is about 50 students. Students participating in this program are often called \\"Schoolies\\" by other Clarkson students. ==Campus== Clarkson has two campuses in Potsdam‚Äîthe \\"downtown\\" campus and the \\"hill\\" campus‚Äîas well as the Capital Region Campus in Schenectady, N.Y., and the Beacon Institute for Rivers and Estuaries in Beacon, N.Y. During the last 35 years, Clarkson has developed the Potsdam hill campus significantly. The health science departments of Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy and Physician Assistant Studies are located on the downtown campus. The campus bookstore is located in downtown Potsdam. The last student dormitory (Congdon) located on the downtown campus closed in May 2006. The only buildings remaining in Clarkson's service at the downtown campus are a few administration buildings, the Army ROTC house, the Clarkson Hall Center for Health Sciences (physical therapy and physician assistant studies), and the Peyton Hall Business Incubator. Other downtown campus buildings contain leased space to businesses. ===Academic buildings=== Bertrand H. Snell Hall * Bertrand H.

Coulter School of Engineering * Price and Graham Hall - Still known as \\"The New Dorms\\" although built in the 1960s, they consist of the Price and Graham complexes, each split into four Houses. The Graham Hall complex consists of Donahue, Olson, Van Note, and Wilson Houses, while the Price Hall complex consists of Farrisee, Newell, Ormsby, and Thomas Houses. Newell House and Ormsby House are reserved for the Clarkson School and the Honors Program. There are a few styles of rooms. Most are four-person suites containing 2 double bedrooms linked by a common bathroom. The other four- person suites are composed of a single double bedroom and two single bedrooms which share a single bathroom. There are a handful of single double bedrooms, which have their own bathroom. These few double bedrooms are much larger than any other suite. The center core of both complexes formerly housed cafeterias. The center core of Graham Hall is now the Service Center, Student Administrative Services, Payroll and other administrative departments. The center core of Price Hall is now the Clarkson School/Honors offices and the Air Force ROTC. These two complexes were planned to be the on-campus Greek housing, but admission growth pressures caused them to be used as ordinary dormitories. Each house was to be a separate fraternity or sorority. * Moore House - Generally inhabited by juniors and sophomores, it is the closest residential building to Snell Hall and the Science Center. Moore is divided into two wings and a center core. The first three floors of each wing contain two doubles with a common bathroom.

There are 20 varsity athletic teams. Except for the men's and women's alpine and nordic skiing, all of these teams compete in the NCAA. While Clarkson is an NCAA Division III school, both the men's and women's ice hockey teams compete in Division I, with both teams playing in the ECAC. The men's team is a traditional power in the ECAC. They have won 6 ECAC Tournament Championships, most recently in 2019. Clarkson's most recent NCAA tournament was as the number two seed in the 2019 NCAA Northeast Regional, where they lost in overtime to the University of Notre Dame, 3-2, in the 1st round. The women's team is far younger, beginning play in 2003, than the men's team, although they too have become an ECAC power. The team has appeared in every tournament since entering the ECAC in 2004 and have appeared in four NCAA tournaments, winning the 2018 edition, 2017 edition and 2014 edition, the first three NCAA titles won by the school, the first NCAA ice hockey title won by a school in St. Lawrence County, and the first Division I NCAA championship won by a school from the North Country. Other Division III varsity teams compete in the Liberty League conference and include baseball, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's cross country, men's golf, men's and women's lacrosse, men's and women's soccer, softball, men's and women's swimming, and women's volleyball. The men and women's alpine skiing and nordic skiing teams compete in the MacConnell Division of the Eastern Collegiate Ski Conference (ECSC), within the United States Collegiate Ski and Snowboard Association (USCSA). They are top contenders almost every year within their division and even conference, and have consistently qualified for the annual USCSA National Championships numerous times. In 2019, the Women's Nordic Team were USCSA National Champions and the Men placed second. Other non-varsity clubs include men's and women's ice hockey, men's lacrosse, men's and women's rugby union, men's soccer, men's bowling, combined men's and women's crew, and ultimate frisbee. Clarkson's combined men's and women's club racquetball team won the Division II title at the USRA National Tournament in 2005. In 2010, the school started a club football team. \\"The Golden Knight\\" is the university's hockey mascot, which can be seen at hockey games waving the Clarkson flag. The nickname \\"Golden Knights\\" was first suggested in an editorial of the October 28, 1950 issue of the Clarkson Integrator, and was in use by the following month. ===Clubs=== Clarkson University's Student Association (CUSA) sponsors more than 130 clubs and organizations, the largest of which being the Outing Club, Ski Club, Cornhole Club, the Clarkson Pep Band, and the Clarkson Union Board. All CUSA sponsored clubs are entirely student-run and both undergraduate and graduate students are welcome to join. Clarkson Mountain Bike Club Non-stop shredding in the ECCC Clarkson Union Board Clarkson Union Board (CUB) is the campus's programming board. CUB hosts various campus events throughout the semester and co-sponsors events with other organizations and University offices and departments. CUB provides professional quality audio and visual support for on-campus events, and hosts the annual SpringFest concert. Previous Springfest performers have included the Goo Goo Dolls, Panic! at the Disco, Plain White Tees, and the All American Rejects. K2CC Amateur Radio Club (K2CC), established in 1922 is the University's oldest organization that is still active today. The club offers two licensing exam sessions per semester and interacts regularly with the local community. K2CC has both analog and digital voice repeaters and maintains a contest and experimentation room equipped with DX, weak signal and satellite radios and antennas. WTSC With WTSC 91.1 FM The Source, Clarkson also offers one of the North Country's most popular radio stations, which is run completely by the student body. Students can broadcast their own shows, and offers a wide variety of music from Rap to Alternative, from Classic rock to street punk. The station has well over 1000 CDs and nearly 24 Terabytes of music on vinyl. The station has a fully equipped broadcast studio (studio A), as well as a second studio for mixing (studio B), and a fully functional recording studio. Clarkson Photo Club The Clarkson Photo Club is a group of students with strong interests in photography, ranging from black and white, color, or digital. Golden Knotes Clarkson Golden Knotes is the Co-ed a Cappella group on campus that formed in the Spring of 2002. Every semester a Final Performance is held to showcase the songs the group worked on for that semester. They also perform at various events on campus. Each year, executive board members of the Golden Knotes hire music students from the neighboring Crane School of Music to serve as music director of the group. FIRST Robotics Clarkson Robotics is a unique club on campus that brings Clarkson University students together with local high school students to design, build, and test a robot that competes in the FIRST Robotics Competition each year. Applied Computer Science Labs Applied CS Labs - The Applied Computer Science Labs at Clarkson University consist of the Clarkson Open Source Institute, the Internet Teaching Lab, and the Virtual Reality Lab, however only the first is populated. These labs, better known as COSI, are almost entirely student-run, offering the opportunity to gain experience in managing both facilities and projects. All three labs are located on the 3rd floor of the Science Center in rooms SC334 and SC336. Clarkson Pep Band The Clarkson University Pep Band is a student-run organization that supports the Clarkson University Golden Knights ice hockey teams. The band consists of approximately 75 full- time members, and performs at Clarkson's Cheel Arena at all of the home games for the Men's NCAA Division I hockey team and some games for the NCAA Division I Women's team. The band also travels to Clarkson Men's ECAC Hockey conference away games with 35-40 members (unless restricted by the policies of the opposing team's arena, notably at Saint Lawrence University) and post-season tournaments. The Clarkson University Pep Band was founded in the fall of 1964, by a small group of Clarkson students. By the 1980s, the band's membership grew significantly. Clarkson Theatre Company The Clarkson Theatre Company (CTC) is a student-run theatre group, part of Clarkson University and supported by the Clarkson University Student Association (CUSA). The mission of CTC is to provide both theatrical entertainment and an outlet for artistic self-expression in the realm of the theatre arts at Clarkson. Membership consists of students and faculty from Clarkson and the other Associated Colleges of the St. Lawrence Valley (SUNY Potsdam, SUNY Canton, and St. Lawrence University) Every fall, CTC puts on a musical over Clarkson University's family weekend, sometime in mid-to-late October. The production time for this show is between 5 and 7 weeks. After the fall production is over, preparations for the One Act Festival begin. This festival is made up of short plays chosen and directed by students, as well as several written by students. This festival is usually put on as a fundraiser for a charity chosen by the executive board, and takes place at the end of January or beginning of February. The next show, usually a straight play, is put on near the beginning of April. Show choice for each slot is not limited to either a musical or play, but it is traditional to use this structure; as shows are chosen by a general member vote, however, any show can be chosen to be put on any semester. CTC's most famous alumnus is not a student, but an adviser. Wes Craven, creator of the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, was a professor at Clarkson University in 1968, as well as faculty adviser to the Clarkson Drama Club (the predecessor of the current Clarkson Theatre Company). As part of one of Professor Craven's classes, Humanities IV, several Theta Chi members wanted to make a spoof of traditional horror movies, about the strange occurrences in their fraternity's house at 18 Elm Street. The filming included CTC's home, Old Snell Hall, where the boiler room scene took place in the basement. While none of those involved had very much film experience, they made the film for about $300 and it was shown twice on campus. Much of Craven's inspiration for A Nightmare on Elm Street came from this first filmmaking experience; the house in the movie, while not the house used in the first version, resembles this house and also resides on Elm Street. ===Fraternities and sororities=== Clarkson social fraternities began organizing on campus in 1903. Several local organizations accepted members from both Clarkson and SUNY Potsdam. In 1977, the first Clarkson-only sorority was founded, and in 1987 Clarkson discontinued recognition of the local sororities at SUNY Potsdam. Clarkson women were still allowed to join these organizations but they could not participate in on-campus rush or live in their houses prior to other off- campus options. Over the years, there have been many different fraternities and sororities that have come and gone due to declining membership, university probationary periods, and disaffiliation from nationals. In order for the university to recognize a Greek organization, all the members must be registered Clarkson students. Additionally, any new organization applying for recognition after 1977 must affiliate with a national organization within five years to maintain recognition. Clarkson recognized international and national fraternities are Alpha Chi Rho, Delta Upsilon, Phi Kappa Sigma, Sigma Chi, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Tau Epsilon Phi and Tau Kappa Epsilon; recognized local fraternities are Omicron Pi Omicron, Beta Tau, and Zeta Nu. Clarkson recognized international and national sororities are Delta Zeta, Phi Sigma Sigma, Theta Phi Alpha, and Kappa Delta Chi. Additionally, there are a number of professional Greek lettered organizations: Alpha Kappa Psi, Chi Epsilon, Omega Chi Epsilon, Phi Delta Epsilon, Phi Kappa Phi, Tau Beta Pi, and Tri- Beta. Clarkson is also home to a chapter of the national service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega. Interfraternity Council The Interfraternity Council (IFC) provides outlets for social interaction among the fraternity and sorority members. IFC helps to sponsor educational opportunities for all of its members and to help to promote the fraternal ideals of leadership, scholarship, service, community and brotherhood. Panhellenic Council The Panhellenic Council is the governing body of the sorority system. The Panhellenic Council provides many opportunities for involvement in campus life and the fraternity and sorority system outside of the individual sororities. Recruitment, social, and educational opportunities are provided by the council. All social sororities recognized by Clarkson University adhere to the rules and regulations set by the National Panhellenic Conference. Greek Life A few organizations have chapter houses off campus; others have plans of having chapter houses on campus in the near future. Clarkson fraternities and sororities take great pride in their chapter houses because of the rich history each residence has. The Greek community is very tight knit because of the university's small size. Fraternities and sororities attend each other's national philanthropy and local community service events. Greek Week and Ice Carnival have an extensive history both with the local colleges and the Potsdam community. ===Publications and media=== * The Integrator is a weekly student-run newspaper which is distributed on Clarkson's campus as well as the town of Potsdam. * WCKN Television is a student-run television station and is also the local cable systems public access station.

ROTC has been an institution at Clarkson since May 1936, when the first ROTC Battalion was activated during the tenure of College President James S. Thomas. The ROTC program at Clarkson has commissioned well over 1,150 military officers. These alumni have been represented at each level of the Officer Corps, from Second Lieutenant to General. Army ROTC The Clarkson Army ROTC Battalion (officially the \\"Golden Knight Battalion\\") is one of 272 Army ROTC battalions in the United States. The average size of the Golden Knight Battalion is 100 Cadets, mostly Clarkson students.

It is located in the central Santa Monica Mountains ‚Äî on Mulholland Highway near Agoura Hills, Southern California, in the Western United States. The ranch is named after the actor Peter Strauss, who was the last private owner-resident of the property. Much of the ranch was destroyed during the Woolsey Fire in November 2018. ==Geography== The Peter Strauss Ranch Park is noted for its extensive California oak woodlands and montane chaparral habitats traversed by a walking path and hiking trail. The moister area along Triunfo Creek has a riparian zone density of plants and animals. The park's habitats represent the California chaparral and woodlands Ecoregion - with the diverse species of the flora of the Santa Monica Mountains. Recreational facilities, beyond trails, also include guided nature walks and programs, a swimming pool and the Lake Enchanto Dam, and a stone ranch house with a large terrazzo patio available for outdoor social events, including concerts, weddings, picnics, and art exhibits. ==History== The area was inhabited by the Chumash people for up to 8,000 years. After Spanish colonization of Alta California, it was taken to become part of the Rancho Las Virgenes land grant. After California became one of the United States in 1850, the area was surveyed in 1881 to confirm the grant's land patent. A California live oak (Quercus agrifolia) that was used as a marker in the survey still stands, just west of the swimming pool, with an upside-down letter \\"T\\" still visible in the bark. ===20th century=== In the early 20th century, the automobile manufacturer Harry Miller, famous for his patented master carburetor featured at the Indianapolis 500, purchased the ranch as a weekend retreat from his factory and residence in Los Angeles. In 1926, Miller built the current stone ranch house, the look-out tower, and the aviary. He held grand parties there during Prohibition, having someone watch for the cops from the tower. The man would then run to the house to warn them to put the booze away. Miller also had other large animals there as part of his private zoo. During the Great Depression, Miller suffered financial ruin after attempting to build aircraft engines, forcing him to sell the property. In the mid-1930s, the property was purchased by Warren Shobert and Arthur Edeson, who renamed the property \\"Shoson\\" and transformed it into a recreational fairyland resort for children and adults. The Lake Encanto Dam, creating Lake Encanto, was constructed on Triunfo Creek. The resort was later renamed \\"Lake Enchanto.\\" Competition from other, larger amusement parks and resorts led to the decline of Lake Enchanto, which fell into disrepair and closed around 1960. In 1976, actor Peter Strauss purchased the property after being moved by the area's natural beauty while filming the mini-series Rich Man, Poor Man at nearby Malibu Lake. Strauss restored the property to a more natural look and lived there until 1983, when he sold it to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. The National Park Service purchased the ranch in 1987. ===Woolsey Fire damage=== On November 14, 2018, the Los Angeles Times published images showing ruined structures on the site and reported that the Ranch was reduced to \\"charred remnants.\\" ==See also== * Flora of the Santa Monica Mountains ==References== ==External links== *National Park Service: official Peter Strauss Ranch Park website * LAMountains: Peter Strauss Ranch Park - images & trails map.

As its distribution has been proven to be limited to one single site it has one of the best claims to being the world's rarest butterfly. ==Overview== The Palos Verdes blue (G. l. palosverdesensis) is a localized and international subspecies of the silvery blue (G. lygdamus). It was described in 1977, shortly before it became one of the second groups of butterflies to be listed under the US Endangered Species Act in 1980.Mattoni, R. 1995. Rediscovery of the Palos Verdes endangered blue butterfly, Glaucopsyche lygdamus palosverdesensis Perkins and Emmel (Lycaenidae). Journal of Research on the Lepidoptera. 31 (3-4): 180-194. It is distinguished from other subspecies of G. lygdamus by its slightly different patterning on the underside of the wing and an earlier flight period. The subspecies was described from the southern slope of the Palos Verdes Peninsula in coastal Los Angeles County. The Palos Verdes blue butterfly was thought to be driven to extinction in 1983, primarily by development of its habitat. The last three to six known individuals were seen and photographed in March, 1983, but the site they occupied was scraped shortly after for fire control. Then, in 1994, the butterfly was rediscovered by Rick Rogers, Rudi Mattoni, and Timothy Dahlum at the Defense Fuel Support Point in San Pedro, which is located on the northern (inland) side of the Palos Verdes Peninsula. This new population lays eggs on an additional food plant (common deerweed, Lotus scoparius) but shares physical and behavioral characteristics with the other now-extinct populations. ==BiologyTaxonomy and systematics=== Glaucopsyche lygdamus palosverdesensis, is a subspecies of the Glaucopsyche lygdamus (silvery blue) species of butterfly found throughout North America. There are currently 11 subspecies of silvery blue. G. lygdamus palosverdesensis was first described in the 1970s and was distinguished from other G. lygdamus by its faster and early flight, wing color and wing spot patterns. 1999\\\\. Habitat Evaluation and Reintroduction Planning for the Endangered Palos Verdes Blue Butterfly. Final Technical Report to California Department of Fish and Game. 1-47. ===Morphology=== The Palos Verdes blue butterfly has a wingspan of only . The male has a bright silvery-blue dorsal wing outlined in a narrow line of black, while the female's dorsal wing is a more brownish-gray colour. Both males and females have gray ventral wings with dark spots surrounded by white rings. 1987\\\\. Decline of the Endangered Palos Verdes Blue Butterfly in California. Biological Conservation. 40: 203-217. ===Habitat=== G. lygdamus palosverdesensis persists particularly on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, 15 miles south of Los Angeles, in a coastal sage scrub habitat. This subspecies is locally monophagous, or particular to one species of food plant. The entire subspecies was originally thought to be particular only to the locoweed or rattlepod (Astragalus trichopodus lonchus), but the population rediscovered in 1994 used common deerweed (Lotus scoparius) as its larval food plant. These two types of plants are fast becoming scarce on the Palos Verdes Peninsula because of housing development. Retention of these larval food plants is essential for conservation of the Palos Verdes blue. ===Life stages=== Oviposition, laying of eggs on the larval food plant, occurs only once a breeding season for the Palos Verdes blue. There are at least four larval instars, or stages of development. After 7 to 10 days the larvae emerge and crawl to the base of the food plant where they pupate. Pupae remain in diapause until emerging as adults. The flight period and reproductive period occur together, beginning in late January and ending in early May. It is rare to see the Palos Verdes blue far from its home food patch, but research shows that males cover more distance and have longer periods of flight. Palos Verdes blues are a diurnal and panmictic subspecies. They are also non-migratory and very particular in their use of larval food plants. Their adult lifespan is only five days. 1996\\\\. Green Teens Save the Blues. Audubon. 98 (5): 102-105. ===Relationships with other species=== Interspecific competition may occur with other lycaenid butterflies for the larval food plant. A mutualism between ants and larvae has been observed during the instars of butterfly development. G. l. palosverdesensis has a host-parasite relationship with its larval food plants, Astragalus lonchus and Lotus scoparius. There has also been observed predation on Palos Verdes blue by western yellowjackets (Vespula pensylvanica) at the Defense Fuel Point location. ==ConservationLaws=== G. lygdamus palosverdesensis was listed as an \\"endangered species\\" by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service on July 2, 1980. This listing also included city- owned critical habitat, plus comments and recommendations for species conservation. Insects are not currently protected by California laws. ===Threats=== The main threat to the Palos Verdes blue has been habitat destruction due to weeds and rototilling, which has negative effects on the essential larval food plants. Recreational, commercial, or residential development of the Palos Verdes Peninsula is also a major concern in preservation of the food plants. 1980\\\\. Listing the Palos Verdes Blue butterfly as an Endangered Species with Critical Habitat. Federal Register. Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. 45 (129): 44939-42. ===Court case=== In 1982, the city of Rancho Palos Verdes bulldozed the then most extensive known habitat of the butterfly to build a baseball field, an act believed to have been a principal cause of the die-off of the subspecies before its rediscovery in 1994. The US Fish and Wildlife Service maintained that the city was \\"well aware\\" of the butterfly and the site status. According to the Los Angeles Times, the mayor of the city \\"said no one complained about butterfly destruction until grading had been completed.\\" In 1987, the city was charged by the federal government with violating the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The case was dismissed later that year by a federal court, which said a municipality was not a person for purposes of the ESA, and thus could not be held criminally responsible. The following year, the US Congress responded by amending the act to include any \\"individual, corporation, partnership, trust, association, or any other private entity; or any officer, employee, agent, department, or instrumentality of the Federal Government, of any State, municipality, or political subdivision of a State, or of any federal government; any State, municipality, or political subdivision of a State; or any other entity subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\\" ===Reintroduction=== The Palos Verdes Peninsula is split into the north and south slopes. On the north slope, reintroduction is suggested based on presence of deerweed (Lotus scoparius) and a native plant index number. The only habitat known so far on the north slope is the Defense Fuel Support Point location. The south slope has many more historic sites of Palos Verdes blue, which are all suggested for reintroduction, including any more sites containing locoweed (Astragalus). Particular sites of reintroduction and rehabilitation of the Palos Verdes blue include Defense Fuel Support Point in San Pedro and the Linden H. Chandler Preserve. In conjunction with other organizations, the Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy is installing and maintaining coastal sage scrub habitat on the slopes around the fuel tanks to benefit the blue butterfly. The Urban Wildlands Group, a nonprofit organization \\"dedicated to the conservation of species, habitats, and ecological processes in urban and urbanizing areas\\", conducts the captive breeding program. This program is a collaboration with Moorpark College and is directed by Moorpark College professor Dr. Jana Johnson. Since that time, the Defense Logistics Agency, which operates the facility, has funded habitat restoration and a breeding program for the blue butterfly. Honey, produced on the premises, is provided to the captive rearing program so the butterflies are able to feed on the same food source as its wild companions. Major Jason Pike, an entomologist for the Defense Logistics Agency who has been monitoring the project, commented, \\"The military takes its responsibilities for endangered species on its properties very seriously, and DLA is pleased to provide support for the blue butterfly project.\\" ===Mass rearing=== Mass rearing of the Palos Verdes blue has been taking place since rediscovery in 1994. The mass rearing is conducted for conservation purposes, reintroduction and prevention of extinction. The mass rearing takes place in \\"tent\\" cages containing both known larval food plants.. 2003. Mass Rearing the endangered Palos Verdes blue butterfly (Glaucopsyche lygdamus palosverdesensis: Lycaenidae). Journal of Research on the Lepidoptera. 37: 55-67. It has been variably successful. In 2008, 2,400 butterflies were raised in a laboratory at Moorpark College. In addition to accepting the conditions of the butterflies' protected status, landowners seeking to house the butterflies needed to prove they could provide sufficient numbers of \\"yellow-flowering deer weed plants.\\" ===Modeling=== Although population viability analysis models are often very important for predicting the outcome of conservation efforts, there have been many problems with using population viability analysis models to predict Palos Verdes blue populations. This type of modeling has proved inconclusive mainly because the Palos Verdes blue utilizes habitat so variably, depending on climatic and successional changes. So far, the appropriate habitat has been hard to find, and expert intuition has often been wrong. Long-term population studies are not available to provide this information because of the many local extinctions and declining numbers of this subspecies. For this reason, the subspecies long-term viability is very difficult to predict. ===Key conservationists=== Current conservation efforts are supported by the Defense Logistics Agency and the U.S. Navy and implemented by the Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy, The Urban Wildlands Group, and The Butterfly Project led by biologist Jana J. Johnson at Moorpark College. The Youth Environmental Service program of the Palos Verdes / South Bay Audubon Society and other volunteer groups have provided help weeding and establishing habitat for the butterfly. The Youth Environmental Service (YES) program started in 2012 and focuses on conserving the Linden H. Chandler Preserve, where they work on restoring native plants for the Palos Verdes blue butterfly. ==See also== *Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy ==References== ==External links== * Technical Reports Urban Wildlands Group * NatureServe Category:Glaucopsyche Category:Endemic fauna of California Category:Fauna of the California chaparral and woodlands Category:Natural history of Los Angeles County, California Category:Butterflies of North America Category:ESA endangered species Category:Butterfly subspecies ","title":"Palos Verdes blue"},{"id":"523171","text":"Wells College is a private liberal arts college in Aurora, New York. The college has cross-enrollment with Cornell University and Ithaca College. Wells College is located in the Finger Lakes region of New York. It is about an hour from Syracuse and Rochester and a half-hour drive from both Ithaca and Auburn. It is within the Aurora Village‚ÄìWells College Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The college has an average student body of 450, with a student to faculty ratio of 9:1. It has five residence halls and seven academic buildings. ==History== Wells College tower Wells was established as a women's college in 1868 by Henry Wells, founder of Wells Fargo and the American Express Company. Wells had the building for Wells Seminary constructed on property he donated. On August 9, 1888, the College's main building burned to the ground. The building was replaced in 1890 by the current Main Building, designed by architect William Henry Miller. In 1906 Henry Wells' 1852 mansion, Glen Park, was purchased by the Alumnae Association and given to the College for its use. It is now operated as a residence hall for upper-class women. In 1965, Walter Netsch designed the Louis Jefferson Long Library. The design of this award-winning building inspired two other buildings on campus, Barler Music Hall and Campbell Art Building. In 1886, Frances Folsom, Wells Class of 1885, married President Grover Cleveland and became the youngest First Lady of the United States. She was the only First Lady to have her wedding in the White House. She was the first among them who was a college graduate. Frances Cleveland (later Preston, after her second marriage) served on the College's Board of Trustees for 50 years. She helped bring the College to national prominence. ===Co-education=== After 136 years as a women's college, Wells announced on October 2, 2004 that it would become a co-educational institution in 2005. Students protested on campus against the change. Some parents of students also became involved in the protests. Some of the students said that their protests were patterned after ones at Mills College in the early 1990s. A website called Wells for Women was established to organize support. After the college's decision to adopt coeducation was approved by its board, students filed a lawsuit, which the courts rejected. The college adopted coeducation in 2005. ===Financial difficulties=== In 2020 the president of Wells College, Jonathan Gibraltar, sent a letter to the college community reporting that financial issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic threatened the College's future, writing, \\"If New York State continues its mandate that our campus remain closed through all or part of the [2020] fall semester, Wells simply will not receive enough revenue to continue operations.\\" Because Wells College receives about 15% of its operating revenue from its Italy-based study abroad program, a COVID-19-related postponement or termination of that program has also been identified as having a significant, negative impact upon the College's financial standing. ==Academics== In 2016, U.S. News ranked Wells at 174 (tied) among liberal arts colleges nationally. Wells College is strengthening its off-campus study programs (most notably in Florence, Italy.) It has created centers in sustainability, business and entrepreneurship, and book arts. Undergraduate students are required to participate in at least two off-campus internships during their time at Wells. ==Athletics== Athletics are offered with half a PE credit earned for each season completed. A member of the Private College Athletic Conference throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Express sports teams of the college captured four consecutive conference championships in women's tennis (1977‚Äì78, 1978‚Äì79, 1979‚Äì80, 1980‚Äì81). They also won titles in women's bowling (1978‚Äì79, 1979‚Äì80). Wells, which officially became an NCAA Division III institution prior to the 1986‚Äì87 athletic season, joined the Atlantic Women's Colleges Conference prior to the 1996‚Äì97 athletic season. In 1996, the Wells women's soccer team captured the school's only AWCC championship title. Wells offered six intercollegiate athletic sports: field hockey, softball, women's lacrosse, women's soccer, women's swimming and women's tennis. As part of the Board of Trustees decision to begin accepting men to the traditionally all- women's college, Wells in 2005 incorporated men's soccer, men's swimming, and men's and women's cross country into their athletic cadre. Prior to the 2007‚Äì08 academic year, the Express teams were invited to join the North Eastern Athletic Conference and compete against 14 other schools in the East Region. By joining the NEAC, Wells can compete for conference championships with the added benefit of receiving an automatic qualifier in select sports to participate in the NCAA tournament. Since joining the NEAC, Wells has captured six separate conference championships. Men's swimming won the first league title in 2009‚Äì10, and earned a second title in 2012‚Äì13. Women's swimming have won three consecutive conference championships, during the 2011‚Äì12, 2012‚Äì13, and 2013‚Äì14 seasons. Men's basketball, who won the NEAC championship in 2010‚Äì11, was the first team from Wells to participate in the NCAA Tournament. As of the 2015‚Äì16 athletic season, Wells offers 16 NCAA Division III varsity sports, including field hockey, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's lacrosse, men's and women's soccer, men's and women's swimming, men's and women's volleyball, men's and women's cross country, softball, baseball, and women's tennis. In the 2018-2019 season the Wells Men‚Äôs Volleyball team made it to the Elite 8 (Quarterfinals) in the NCAA Division 3 Men‚Äôs Volleyball Tournament before falling to Stevens Institute of Technology. ==Honor Code== Wells has an honor code to which all students subscribe. By signing the Honor Code, Wells students pledge \\"not to lie, cheat, steal, deceive, or conceal in the conduct of their collegiate life\\". Wells allows students to have take-home exams, and to work in their residence hall rooms, at the library, or on the dock by the lake, rather than only in classrooms. ==Notable alumnae== *Frances Folsom Cleveland ‚Äì wife of President Grover Cleveland and First Lady of the United States *Pleasant Rowland ‚Äì founder of Pleasant Company and creator of the American Girl brand of dolls, books, and accessories *Laura Nader ‚Äì Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley. *Helen Barolini ‚Äì author of novels and essays *Edith Kinney Gaylord ‚Äì journalist, philanthropist, founder of Inasmuch Foundation and Ethics and Excellence in Journalism Foundation, and former president of the National Women's Press Club *Mary Beckerle ‚Äì Ph.D and executive director of the Huntsman Cancer Institute.

It grows west of the Sierra Nevada mountain range from Mendocino County, California, south to northern Baja California in Mexico. It is classified in the red oak section of oaks (Quercus sect. Lobatae). This species is commonly sympatric with canyon live oak (Q. chrysolepis), and the two may be hard to distinguish because their spinose leaves are superficially similar. ==Description== Coast live oak, Sonoma County Coast live oak typically has a much-branched trunk and reaches a mature height of . Some specimens may attain an age exceeding 1000 years. Examples of this include the Grand Oak of Cherry Valley, California https://www.monumentaltrees.com/en/usa/california/riversidecounty/8948_highlandspringsresort/17622/, the Encino Oak Tree, which died in the 1990s (part of the stump has been preserved)https://web.archive.org/web/20121021220556/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83858687.html and the Pechanga Great Oak.https://www.pechanga-nsn.gov/index.php/history/the- great-oak The trunk, particularly for older individuals, may be highly contorted, massive and gnarled. The crown is broadly rounded and dense, especially when aged 20 to 70 years; in later life the trunk and branches are more well defined and the leaf density lower. The oldest specimens might exceed 20 feet in trunk circumference and 100 feet height.https://www.pechanga-nsn.gov/index.php/history/the-great-oak https://www.lindaymakutadds.com/the-lang-oak-encino-oak-tree/ ===Leaves=== The leaves are dark green, oval, often convex in shape, long and broad; the leaf margin is spiny-toothed (spinose), with sharp thistly fibers that extend from the lateral leaf veins. The outer layers of leaves are designed for maximum solar absorption, containing two to three layers of photosynthetic cells. These outer leaves are deemed to be small in size to more efficiently re- radiate the heat gained from solar capture. Shaded leaves are generally broader and thinner, having only a single layer of photosynthetic cells. The convex leaf shape may be useful for interior leaves which depend on capturing reflected light scattered in random directions from the outer canopy. ===Inflorescence and acorns=== Acorns and leaves The flowers are produced in early-to-mid spring; the male flowers are pendulous catkins long, the female flowers inconspicuous, less than long, with 1‚Äì3 clustered together. The fruit is a slender reddish brown acorn long and broad, with the basal quarter enclosed in a cupule; unusually for a red oak, the acorns mature about 7‚Äì8 months after pollination (most red oak acorns take 18 months to mature). ===Recognized varieties=== There are two varieties of Quercus agrifolia: * Quercus agrifolia var. agrifolia. Throughout the range of the species. Leaves that are glabrous to slightly hairy on the abaxial side, especially near the leaf vein axils. Hybrids with Q. kelloggii, Q. parvula var. shevei, and Q. wislizeni are known. * Quercus agrifolia var. oxyadenia. Southwesternmost California (San Diego area), Baja California. Leaves that are tomentose abaxially, with densely interwoven hairs. It prefers granitic soils; hybrids with Q. kelloggii known. ===Hybridity=== Several hybrids between coast live oak and other red oak species have been documented. Hybrids with interior live oak (Q. wislizenii) are known in many areas in northern California. Coast live oak also hybridizes with Shreve oak (Q. parvula var. shrevei). All these oak species show evidence of introgression with one another. ==Etymology== In naming the species, N√©e compared it to a species illustrated in Leonard Plukenet‚Äôs Phytographia under the descriptive name ‚ÄúIlex folio agrifolii americana, forte agria, vel aquifolia glandifera‚Äù which Plukenet had compared, in his Almagestum botanicum, to Luigi Anguillara‚Äôs ‚ÄúAgrifolia glandifera,‚Äù the noun ‚ÄúAgrifolia‚Äù being a Medieval Latin form of ‚ÄúAquifolium‚Äù meaning a holly or holly-leaved oak, and related to the Modern Italian ‚ÄúAgrifoglio,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúholly.‚Äù N√©e, Luis. Descripci√≥n de varias especies nuevas de 'Encina ' (Quercus de Linneo). Anales de historia natural. volume 3. 1801.Plukenet, Leonard. Phytographia [...] Pars tertia, 1692 Plukenet, Leonard. Almagestum botanicum, 1696 ==Habitat and ecology== Coast live oak, San Luis Obispo County, California. Coast live oak is the only California native oak that actually thrives in the coastal environment, although it is rare on the immediate shore; it enjoys the mild winter and summer climate afforded by ocean proximity, and it is somewhat tolerant of aerosol-borne sea salt. The coastal fog supplies relief from the rainless California summer heat. It is the dominant overstory plant of the coast live oak woodland habitat, often joined by California bay laurel and California buckeye north of Big Sur. Associated understory plants include toyon, various manzanitas and western poison-oak. Normally the tree is found on well drained soils of coastal hills and plains, often near year round or perennial streams. It may be found in several natural communities including coast live oak woodland, Engelmann oak woodland, valley oak woodland and both northern and southern mixed evergreen forests. While normally found within of the Pacific Ocean at elevations less than , in southern California it occasionally occurs at up to in altitude. The California oak moth (Phryganidia californica) caterpillar subsists entirely on living and fallen leaves of the Coast Live Oak. In 8‚Äì10 year cycles, the caterpillar will appear in sufficient abundance to denude healthy trees. The trees recover, and botanists speculate that the species provide mutual benefit, possibly in the form of fertilizer for the oak. The coast live oak is also the only known foodplant of Chionodes vanduzeei caterpillars. ==Allergenicity== The pollen of the coast live oak is a severe allergen. Pollination occurs in spring. http://www.pollenlibrary.com/Local/Specie/Quercus+agrifolia/in/Santa%20clara%20County/CA/ ==Economic usageHistorical usage=== Coast live oak at Rancho Los Encinos in the San Fernando Valley At least twelve distinct cultures of Native Americans are known to have consumed the acorns as a dietary staple. The seeds were ground into meal, which after being washed was boiled into mush or baked in ashes to make bread. In the 18th century, Spaniards in the San Fernando Valley used the wood for charcoal to fire kilns in making adobe. Later this form of charcoal would be utilized in the baking, gunpowder and electric power industries. In the 18th and 19th centuries shipbuilders sought out the odd angular branches to make special joints. Pioneers moving west would harvest small amounts for making farm implements and wagon wheels, but the greatest impact was the wholesale clearing of oak woodlands to erect sprawling cities such as San Diego and San Francisco. The irregular shape often let the tree escape widespread harvest for building timbers, and also led the early settlers to endow the coast live oak with mystical qualities. Its stateliness has made it a subject of historical landscape painters throughout California modern history since the mid-19th century. ===Modern usage=== Coast live oak has also become a common addition to western USA landscaping. It is however sensitive to changes in grading and drainage; in particular, it is important to respect the root crown level and avoid adding soil near the trunk when construction or landscaping occurs. Also, if incorporating it into a landscaping scheme with artificial irrigation, it is important to avoid regular watering within the oak's drip line (canopy), since wet soil in the summer increases infection rates by soil-borne Phytophthora diseases like sudden oak death. ==Geographical monikers== The coast live oak, especially in its Spanish forms encino or encina, encinitas \\"little oaks\\", and encinal \\"oak grove\\", gave its name to seven land grants across California and to many communities and geographic features. These include Rancho Los Encinos, the Los Angeles community of Encino, Encinitas near San Diego, and Encinal del Temescal, now the city of Oakland.Gudde, Erwin, and William Bright, California Place Names, University of California Press, 4th edition, 1998, , p. 123-124 Paso Robles (originally 'El Paso de Robles' or 'Pass of the Oaks') also refers to oaks as a geographical place name. ==References== ==Further reading== * Jepson Flora Project: Quercus agrifolia, var. agrifolia, var. oxyadenia * Balls, E.

The term implies that by opposing the ruling subgroup, the \\"enemies\\" in question are acting against the larger group, for example against society as a whole. It is similar to the notion of \\"enemy of the state\\". The term originated in Roman times as , typically translated into English as the \\"public enemy\\". The term in its \\"enemy of the people\\" form has been used for centuries in literature (see An Enemy of the People, the play by Henrik Ibsen, 1882; or Coriolanus, the play by William Shakespeare, c. 1605). The Soviet Union made extensive use of the term until 1956, notably by Stalin. It is routinely used by authoritarian rulers, and since early 2017 it has been used on multiple occasions by US President Donald Trump to refer to news organizations and journalists who he perceives as critical of and biased against him. ==Origins of the expression== The expression dates back to Roman times.see also Jal, Paul (1963) Hostis (publicus) dans la litt√©rature latine de la fin de la R√©publique, footnotes 1 and 2 The Senate declared emperor Nero a hostis publicus in AD 68.Garzetti, Albino (2014) From Tiberius to the Antonines: A History of the Roman Empire AD 14-192, Routledge. p.220 Its direct translation is \\"public enemy\\". Whereas \\"public\\" is currently used in English to describe something related to collectivity at large, with an implication towards government or the State, the Latin word \\"publicus\\" could, in addition to that meaning, also refer directly to people, making it the equivalent of the genitive of populus (\\"people\\"), populi (\\"popular\\" or \\"of the people\\"). Thus, \\"public enemy\\" and \\"enemy of the people\\" are, etymologically, near synonyms. The words \\"ennemi du peuple\\" were used extensively during the French Revolution. On 25 December 1793 Robespierre stated: \\"The revolutionary government owes to the good citizen all the protection of the nation; it owes nothing to the Enemies of the People but death\\".Robespierre\\"Le but du gouvernement constitutionnel est de conserver la R√©publique; celui du gouvernement r√©volutionnaire est de la fonder. [‚Ä¶] Le gouvernement r√©volutionnaire doit au bon citoyen toute la protection nationale; il ne doit aux Ennemis du Peuple que la mort\\" (speech at the National Convention The Law of 22 Prairial in 1794 extended the remit of the Revolutionary Tribunal to punish \\"enemies of the people\\", with some political crimes punishable by death, including \\"spreading false news to divide or trouble the people\\".Higgins, Andrew (26 February 2017) \\"Trump Embraces ‚ÄòEnemy of the People,‚Äô a Phrase With a Fraught History\\" The New York Times ==Marxist‚ÄìLeninist statesSoviet Union=== The Soviet Union made extensive use of the term (, vrag naroda) (literal meaning is the enemy of the nation). The term was used by Vladimir Lenin after coming to power, as early as in the decree of 28 November 1917: Other similar terms were in use as well: *enemy of the labourers (–≤—Ä–∞–≥ —Ç—Ä—É–¥—è—â–∏—Ö—Å—è, vrag trudyashchikhsya) *enemy of the proletariat (–≤—Ä–∞–≥ –ø—Ä–æ–ª–µ—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–∞—Ç–∞, vrag proletariata) *class enemy (–∫–ª–∞—Å—Å–æ–≤—ã–π –≤—Ä–∞–≥, klassovyi vrag), etc. In particular, the term \\"enemy of the workers\\" was formalized in the Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code),\\"Article 58\\", an online excerpt and similar articles in the codes of the other Soviet Republics. At various times these terms were applied, in particular, to Tsar Nicholas II and the Imperial family, aristocrats, the bourgeoisie, clerics, business entrepreneurs, anarchists, kulaks, monarchists, Mensheviks, Esers, Bundists, Trotskyists, Bukharinists, the \\"old Bolsheviks\\", the army and police, emigrants, saboteurs, wreckers (–≤—Ä–µ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª–∏, \\"vrediteli\\"), \\"social parasites\\" (—Ç—É–Ω–µ—è–¥—Ü—ã, \\"tuneyadtsy\\"), Kavezhedists (people who administered and serviced the KVZhD (China Far East Railway), particularly the Russian population of Harbin, China), those considered bourgeois nationalists (notably Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Armenian, Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian nationalists, Zionists, Basmachi). An \\"enemy of the people\\" could be imprisoned, expelled or executed, and lose their property to confiscation. Close relatives of enemies of the people were labeled as \\"traitor of Motherland family members\\" and prosecuted. They could be sent to Gulag, punished by the involuntary settlement in unpopulated areas, or stripped of citizen's rights. Being a friend of an enemy of the people automatically placed the person under suspicion. A majority of the enemies of the people were given this label not because of their hostile actions against the workers' and peasants' state, but simply because of their social origin or profession before the revolution: those who used hired labor, high-ranking clergy, former policemen, merchants, etc. Some of them were commonly known as lishentsy (–ª–∏—à–µ–Ω—Ü—ã, derived from Russian word –ª–∏—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ, deprivation), because by the Soviet Constitution they were deprived of the right of voting. This automatically translated into a deprivation of various social benefits; some of them, e.g., rationing, were at times critical for survival. Since 1927, Article 20 of the Common Part of the penal code that listed possible \\"measures of social defence\\" had the following item 20a: \\"declaration to be an enemy of the workers with deprivation of the union republic citizenship and hence of the USSR citizenship, with obligatory expulsion from its territory\\". Nevertheless, most \\"enemies of the people\\" suffered labor camps, rather than expulsion.  Rejection of the phrase  On 25 February 1956, Nikita Khrushchev delivered a speech to the Communist Party in which he identified Stalin as the author of the phrase and distanced himself from it, saying that it made debate impossible. \\"This term automatically made it unnecessary that the ideological errors of a man or men engaged in a controversy be proven,\\" Khrushchev said. \\"It made possible the use of the cruelest repression, violating all norms of [...] legality, against anyone who in any way disagreed with Stalin, against those who were only suspected of hostile intent, against those who had bad reputations ... The formula ‚Äòenemy of the people‚Äô was specifically introduced for the purpose of physically annihilating such individuals.\\" For decades afterwards, the phrase \\"was so omnipresent, freighted and devastating in its use under Stalin that nobody [in Russia] wanted to touch it. ... except in reference to history and in jokes\\", according to William Taubman in his biography of Khrushchev. However, the term returned to Russian public discourse in the late 2000s with a number of nationalist and pro-government politicians (most notably Ramzan Kadyrov) calling for restoration of the Soviet approach to the \\"enemies of the people\\" defined as all non-system opposition. ===China=== In Mao Zedong's 1957 speech On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People, he comments that \\"At the present stage, the period of building socialism, the classes, strata and social groups which favour, support and work for the cause of socialist construction all come within the category of the people, while the social forces and groups which resist the socialist revolution and are hostile to or sabotage socialist construction are all enemies of the people.\\"Mao Zedong (27 February 1957) On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People pp.2‚Äì3 (According to Philip Short, an author of biographies of Mao and Cambodia's Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, in domestic political struggles Chinese and Cambodian communists rarely if ever used the phrase \\"enemy of the people\\" as they were very nationalistic, and saw it as an alien import.) ===Albania=== Enemy of the people (Alb: Armiku i popullit) in Albania was the enemy typology of the Communist Albanian regime used to denounce political or class opponents. The term is today considered totalitarian, derogatory and hostile. There are still some politicians who use the term on political opponents with the intention of dehumanization.. After the communist take over in, many who were labeled with this term were executed or imprisoned.. Enver Hoxha declared religious leaders, landowners, disloyal party officials, clerics and clan leaders as \\"enemies of the people\\". This is said to have led to the death of 6000 people.. Thousands were sentenced to death.. From 1945 to 1991, around 5000 men and women were executed and close to 100,000 were sent to prison as they were labeled enemies of the people.. Many who were targeted held important leadership positions in the party and state structures of the regime.. Hoxha also used the term against the Soviet union and the US when he spoke: \\"as to ‚ÄôAlbania being only one mouthful‚Äô, watch out, gentlemen, for socialist Albania is a hard bone that will stick in your throat and choke you!\\".. On 1 June 1945, The Albanian Central Commission for the Discovery of Crimes, of War Criminals and Enemies of the People requested the International Commission for the Discovery of Crimes and War Criminals to hand over a number of Albanian war criminals found in concentration camps in Italy such as Bari, Lecce, Salerno and others.. In 1954, Hoxha condemned the American and British liberation of Albania calling them \\"enemies of the people\\".. In the 1960s, many Albanian migrants returned from Austria and Italy after having fled in the 1940s, and despite having been promised not to be punished, were immediately arrested as \\"enemies of the people\\".. In 1990, Ismail Kadare applied for political asylum in France, which was granted, resulting in him being condemned by Albanian officials as an \\"enemy of the people\\".. ==Nazi Germany== Regarding the Nazi plan to relocate all Jews to Madagascar, the Nazi tabloid Der St√ºrmer wrote that \\"The Jews don't want to go to Madagascar ‚Äì They cannot bear the climate. Jews are pests and disseminators of diseases. In whatever country they settle and spread themselves out, they produce the same effects as are produced in the human body by germs. ... In former times sane people and sane leaders of the peoples made short shrift of enemies of the people. They had them either expelled or killed.\\" ==United States in the 1960s== In the United States during the 1960s, organizations such as the Black Panther Party and Students for a Democratic Society were known to use the term. In one inter-party dispute in February 1971, for example, Black Panther leader Huey P. Newton denounced two other Panthers as \\"enemies of the people\\" for allegedly putting party leaders and members in jeopardy. ==Usage in the 2010sUnited Kingdom=== During the aftermath of the referendum on membership of the European Union, the Daily Mail was criticized for a headline describing judges (in the Miller case) as \\"Enemies of the People\\" for ruling that the process for leaving the European Union (i.e. the triggering of Article 50) would require the consent of the British Parliament. The May administration had hoped to use the powers of the royal prerogative to bypass parliamentary approval. The paper issued character assassinations of all the judges involved in the ruling (Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, Sir Terence Etherton, and Lord Justice Sales), and received more than 1,000 complaints to the Independent Press Standards Organisation. The Secretary of State for Justice, Liz Truss, issued a three-line statement defending the independence and impartiality of the judiciary, which some saw as inadequate due to the delayed response and failure to condemn the attacks. ===Donald Trump=== Donald Trump at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2017 On 17 February 2017, President of the United States Donald Trump declared on Twitter that The New York Times, NBC News, ABC, CBS, and CNN were \\"fake news\\" and the \\"enemy of the people\\".Erickson, Amanda (18 February 2017)\\"Trump called the news media an ‚Äòenemy of the American People.‚Äô Here‚Äôs a history of the term\\" The Washington Post Trump repeated the assertion on 24 February at the Conservative Political Action Conference, saying, \\"A few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people and they are. They are the enemy of the people.\\" At a 25 June 2018 rally in South Carolina, Trump singled out journalists as \\"fake newsers\\" and again called them \\"the enemy of the people.\\" Some commentators tried to link these comments to a mass shooting at the offices of a newspaper publisher in Annapolis, Maryland, that took place only days later, on 28 June. On 19 July 2018, following the critical reaction to his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on 15 July 2018 in Helsinki, Finland, Trump tweeted \\"The Summit with Russia was a great success, except with the real enemy of the people, the Fake News Media.\\" The New York Times noted Trump's use of this phrase during his \\"moments of peak criticism\\" and use of the term by Nazi and Soviet propaganda. On 2 August 2018, after Trump tweeted \\"FAKE NEWS media... is the enemy of the American People\\", multiple international institutions such as the United Nations and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights criticized Trump for his attacks on the free press. On 16 August 2018, the United States Senate, in a symbolic rebuke to Trump, passed by unanimous consent a resolution affirming that the media is not \\"the enemy of the people\\" and reaffirming \\"the vital and indispensable role the free press serves.\\"Reiss, Jaclyn (16 August 2018) \\"US Senate unanimously passes resolution affirming the press ‚Äòis not the enemy of the people‚Äô\\" Boston GlobeS.Res.607 ‚Äì A resolution reaffirming the vital and indispensable role the free press serves., 115th Congress (2017‚Äì2018), Congress.gov.

The name (ŒíŒ±œÑŒµœÅŒ¨) comes from Œ≤Œ¨œÑŒ± (vata, meaning \\"bramble\\"), in reference to prickly bushes that blocked the old mule-drive access. It is 55 km in total from Mytilini. The 7 km long, sandy beach here, backed by vegetated hills and looking out to Hios and Psara, offers some of the warmest, cleanest swimming on Lesvos. Several family hotels and taverns with traditional tastes are across the biggest beach on the island. 3 km west you can gaze out to the cape of Agios Fokas, where foundations and columns stubs remain of the temple of Dionysos and an early Christian basilica. The Vatera area hit the Greek news in 1997 when a palaeontologist, Michael Dermitzakis, confirmed what farmers unearthing bones had long suspected when he announced that the area was a treasure trove of two-million-year-old fossils, belonging to the Late Pliocene. The fossils include bones of stenoid horses (Equus stenonis), mastodons, a baboon-like monkey (Paradolichopithecus) and a giant tortoise (Cheirogaster), the latter the size of a small car. Around two million years ago, Lesvos was not an island but was joined to the Asian mainland, and the gulf of Vatera was a subtropical shallow sea. The environment of Vatera at that time, was partly forested, partly open woodlands, with meandering rivers through the area flowing to the sea. The animals in question died somewhere near the rivers and their carcasses were transported by the water downstream. They got stuck somewhere at a bend, and sediments covered the remains until they were removed by Dermitzakis' team. In the nearby village of Vrissa, the University of Athens has established a natural history collection dedicated to the palaeontological finds. ==See also== *List of settlements in Lesbos == References == Athanassiou A. 2002.

During a NATO-sponsored training seminar in Budapest, Safarov broke into Margaryan's dormitory room at night and axed Margaryan to death while he was asleep. In 2006, Safarov was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment in Hungary with a minimum incarceration period of 30 years. After his request under the Strasbourg Convention, he was extradited on August 31, 2012 to Azerbaijan, where he was greeted as a hero, pardoned by Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev despite contrary assurances made to Hungary, promoted to the rank of major and given an apartment and over eight years of back pay. According to Azerbaijani authorities, Safarov was pardoned in compliance with Article 12 of the convention. Following Safarov's pardon, Armenia severed diplomatic relations with Hungary and immediate protests broke out in Yerevan. The extradition was widely condemned by international organizations and governments of many countries, including the US, Russia and France. ==Early life== Ramil Safarov was born on August 25, 1977 in the town of Jabrayil, former Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic of Soviet Union (now Azerbaijan) where he finished middle school. He is one of four brothers. Jabrayil was occupied by Armenian forces on August 26, 1993, and remained under control of Nagorno-Karabakh army as part of the unresolved Nagorno-Karabakh conflict until October 4, 2020. Safarov's family fled to Baku in 1991. During a court hearing, Safarov recounted memories from the years of war, during which he had lost family members. This, however, contradicted another version he told the court, where he stated that he was studying in Azerbaijan's capital of Baku and in Turkey from 1992 to 1996. He continued his studies at Maltepe Military High School in ƒ∞zmir and then at the Turkish Military Academy, graduating in 2000, after which he returned to Azerbaijan.Gunel Abilova.

Retrieved 1 September 2012. ==Budapest murder== In January 2004, the 26-year-old Ramil Safarov, along with another officer from Azerbaijan, went to Budapest (Hungary), to participate in the three-month English language courses, organized by NATO's Partnership for Peace program for military personnel from different countries. Two Armenian officers, a 25-year-old Gurgen Margaryan and Hayk Makuchyan, also participated in this program. On the evening of February 18, Safarov bought an axe and a honing stone at Tesco, near Ferenc Pusk√°s Stadium. He took them in the bag to his dormitory room at the Zrinyi Miklos National Defence University, where all the course participants were staying. Safarov's roommate had returned to his native Ukraine to attend the funerals of his relatives and so nobody interrupted Safarov as he sharpened the axe in his room. At around 5:00 am on February 19 Safarov took the axe and went to Margaryan's room, which he was sharing with his Hungarian roommate, Bal√°zs Kuti. The door of their room was not locked. Safarov attacked the sleeping Margaryan with the axe and delivered 16 blows to his body, which almost severed Margaryan‚Äôs head. The noises woke up Kuti, who was shocked seeing the Azerbaijani officer standing by Gurgen‚Äôs bed with a long axe in his hands. As Kuti later testified, ‚ÄúBy that time I understood that something terrible had happened for there was blood all around. I started to shout at the Azerbaijani urging him to stop it. He said that he had no problems with me and would not touch me, stabbed Gurgen a couple of more times and left. The expression of his face was as if he was glad he had finished something important. Greatly shocked, I ran out of the room to find help, and Ramil went in another direction‚Äù. Afterwards, Safarov headed for the room of Makuchyan, the other Armenian student, with the intention of attacking him also, but found his door locked.safarov.org The murderAsbarez. Safarov Trial Resumes in Budapest He shouted out Makuchyan‚Äôs name in a threatening voice. The half-sleeping Makuchyan wanted to open the door, but his Lithuanian roommate stopped him and called his compatriot next door to check what was going on. Meanwhile, Safarov went to look for Hayk in the room of the Serbian and the Ukrainian roommates, showing them the blood- stained axe and stating that he thirsted for nobody's blood but Armenian. Safarov then attempted to break the door with the axe, but, by this time, the students in the neighboring rooms already woke up, went out to the corridor and tried to persuade him to stop. Later the eyewitnesses confessed that they were afraid to approach Ramil with a blood-stained axe closer than at three meters. Soon after, the Hungarian police, which was summoned by Bal√°zs Kuti, arrived and arrested Safarov at the scene. A Hungarian court later found that it was an attempt on Makuchyan‚Äôs life and recognized the latter also as a victim.panarmenian.net Safarov victim Hayk Makuchyan to apply to European institutions While announcing the verdict the judge particularly emphasized that if Safarov had not been restrained by his fellow officers he would have killed the second Armenian officer as well.BBC News [Hungary jails Azerbaijani killer http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4907552.stm] ===Interrogation and trial=== During his initial interrogation Safarov confessed to killing Margaryan and his intention to kill Makuchyan. Questioned about his motives during the interrogation, Safarov stated: According to Bal√°zs Kuti, at the very beginning of the language courses, when the students got acquainted, there was a conversation about different international issues, but nobody spoke of it afterwards. Kuti also said that he had not noticed any strain in the relationship between Margaryan and the Azerbaijani officers. Makuchyan's neighbor, officer Saulius Paulius also said that he observed nothing strange in the relationship between the Armenian and the Azerbaijani guys. The police afterwards interrogated all the students and all testified that there was no conflict between the Armenian and the Azerbaijani officers and that they did not even interact with each other. Later in an interview to the Armenian newspaper ‚ÄúIravunk‚Äù Hayk Makuchyan confirmed that neither Gurgen nor him had had any contacts with any of the Azerbaijani officers. ‚ÄúThey were not of a communicative type. Usually, after classes, they went straight to their rooms‚Äù, said Hayk. To the question as to why he chose to attack Margaryan first Safarov answered it was because he was big, muscular and of sportive type. When the case went to trial Safarov's defense asserted that the murder was committed because Margaryan had insulted the Azerbaijani flag. This explanation later underwent several variations in the press in Azerbaijan and among his defenders. It was claimed that Margaryan and/or Makuchyan had urinated on the Azerbaijani flag; used it to clean and wipe their shoes; and had played an audio recording of \\"voices of suffering Azerbaijani women and girls.\\"Pearce, Katy. \\"Deep Dive: Filling In The Gaps -- Reading The Ramil Safarov Case In Azerbaijan.\\" RFE/RL. September 10, 2012. Retrieved September 14, 2012. Safarov did not mention any of this in either his interrogation or his court trial and made it very clear he killed Margaryan just because he was an Armenian. No witnesses were ever called during the trial to corroborate these allegations of harassment in court and prosecution lawyers strongly disputed that they had taken place.Amnesty International Azerbaijan: Government sends dangerous message on ethnically-motivated violence Despite the lack of evidence the Azerbaijani media, including state-owned media outlets, have circulated the version of the flag for making Safarov a national hero. The defense also alleged that Safarov was mentally sick when committing the murder, however the forensic medical examination, which was upheld by the judge, showed that \\"Safarov was sane and aware of the consequences of his act\\".Panorama 04/03/2013. Hero-murderer Ramil Safarov told about his bodily fear towards Armenians On April 13, 2006, a Hungarian court sentenced Safarov to life imprisonment without right of appeal for 30 years. The judge, Andras Vaskuti, cited the premeditated nature and brutality of the crime and the fact that Safarov showed no remorse for his deeds as the reasons for the sentence. Handing down a life sentence, the judge particularly emphasised that ‚Äúthe murder of a sleeping man in peace time is always a crime and cannot be an act of heroism‚Äù. On February 22, 2007, a Hungarian appeal court upheld the ruling following an appeal filed by Safarov's lawyer. While serving his sentence, Safarov translated several novels by Hungarian authors into Azeri, including Magda Szab√≥'s The Door ()Ramil Safarov Translated Another Work by Hungarian Writer. Day.az. 14 September 2011. and The Paul Street Boys () (youth novel by the Hungarian writer Ferenc Moln√°r). ===Reaction to the murder and the sentence=== A lawyer representing the victim's family welcomed the sentence as a \\"good decision for the Hungarian court and for Armenian society.\\" Many officials in Azerbaijan publicly praised Safarov's actions, while there were also those who condemned them. Elmira S√ºleymanova, the human rights commissioner (ombudsman) of Azerbaijan, declared that Safarov's punishment was far too harsh and that \\"Safarov must become an example of patriotism for the Azerbaijani youth\\".‚ÄúZerkalo‚Äù Newspaper, Baku, 28.02.2004 The banned radical Azerbaijan National Democrat Party awarded Safarov with the title of \\"Man of the Year 2005\\" for killing an Armenian. Fuad Agayev, a prominent Azeri lawyer, said that Azeris \\"...have to urgently stop this current campaign to raise Safarov to the rank of national hero. He is no hero.‚Äù The United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs condemned Azerbaijan's reaction to the brutal murder of the Armenian officer in a hearing. A report which was published by the Committee on Foreign Affairs contained a statement by Bryan Ardouny, Executive Director of the Armenian Assembly of America, who stated that \\"The Azerbaijani government has also consistently failed to condemn Safarov, an Azeri military officer who in 2003 [sic] brutally murdered an Armenian participant at a NATO Partnership for Peace military training exercise in Budapest, Hungary. Instead, it has encouraged domestic media and various organizations to treat the murderer as a celebrity. That individual has since been awarded the title of 'Man of the Year' by Azerbaijan‚Äôs National- Democratic Party.\\" ==Extradition and pardonSafarov's welcome in Azerbaijan=== After serving eight years of the life sentence, Safarov was extradited under the framework guidelines of the 1983 Strasbourg Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and transferred to Azerbaijan on August 31, 2012. Although the Hungarian government stated that it had received assurances from the Azerbaijan government that the remainder of the sentence would be enforced, President Ilham Aliyev issued a pardon immediately upon Safarov's arrival in Baku and ordered that he be \\"freed from the term of his punishment.\\" Azerbaijani Defense Minister Safar Abiyev promoted Safarov to the rank of major and the Defense Ministry of Azerbaijan provided him with an apartment and over eight years of back pay. On September 1, Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry spokesman Elman Abdullayev said that the return of Safarov to Azerbaijan is a matter of relations between Azerbaijan and Hungary, which was resolved in the \\"framework of the law and is not contrary to norms and principles of the international law.\\" He described Sargsyan's statements as \\"hysterical\\" and accused him of being one of the leaders of the group that committed the Khojaly Massacre. After arriving in Baku, Safarov stated: \\"This is restoration of justice. It was a bit of surprise for me.\\" He then visited Martyrs' Lane to lay flowers at the tomb of Azerbaijan's former president Heydar Aliyev. He also laid flowers at the Eternal Flame monument and visited a monument to Turkish soldiers. Novruz Mammadov, the head of the presidential foreign relations department, said that secret talks had been going on for a year between Azerbaijan and Hungary, and that agreement had been reached on the visit of Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb√°n. A week before Safarov's release there came reports that the two countries were in talks over a loan from Azerbaijan to Hungary of 2-3bn euros ($2.5-3.8bn; ¬£1.6-2.4bn) which gave way to speculations in Hungary that Orb√°n extradited Safarov in return for a promise that Azerbaijan would buy Hungarian bonds.Euobserver 03.09.12.

It is murder on ethnic grounds,\\" he said. Sargsyan suggested the possibility that Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev and Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb√°n had entered into a secret agreement during the latter's visit to Baku on June 30, 2012. A number of sources in the media have also speculated that Hungary's deepening economic ties with Azerbaijan may have had something to do with Safarov's release. Sargsyan concluded his statements by saying, \\"with their joint actions the authorities of Hungary and Azerbaijan have opened the door for the recurrence of such crimes.\\" Demonstrations took place in front of the Hungarian consulate in Yerevan, during which the building was pelted with tomatoes. Demonstrators also burned a Hungarian flag. A photo of Safarov was also burned by the activists. National Assembly Speaker Hovik Abrahamyan cancelled his visit to Hungary planned for late September. Hayk Makuchyan, whom Safarov unsuccessfully planned to kill on the same night as Margaryan, stated that he will petition to all judicial instances and possibly The Hague, since the murder was committed on ethnic grounds, adding: \\"I had no doubt that Ramil Safarov would not have served his sentence in the case of an extradition. But the Azerbaijani leadership‚Äôs cynicism surpassed everything.\\" Hungary On September 2 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Hungary announced the country \\"refuses to accept and condemns the action of Azerbaijan, which contradicts the relevant rules of international law and sharply contrasts the undertaking of the Azerbaijani side in this matter, confirmed by the Deputy Minister of Justice of the Republic of Azerbaijan in his letter <...> of 15 August 2012.\\" The Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the action of Azerbaijan in a diplomatic note. The press release also states that \\"Hungary regards the decision of Azerbaijan inconsistent with the spirit of cooperation based on mutual trust that has been achieved during the past years between our respective countries.\\" The opposition parties strongly criticized Viktor Orb√°n and his cabinet for the move. Despite government denials, opposition parties said Orb√°n let Safarov return to Azerbaijan in the hope of economic favors in return from the energy producer Azerbaijan.Reuters, 18 Sep 2012 Reuters INSIGHT-Hungarians impatiently await promised \\"fairy tale\\" Representatives of MSZP, the then largest opposition party, called for various subcommittees of the parliament to examine who exactly made the decision and why the procedure was kept secret.

Only four other north‚Äìsouth routes are longer: US 1, US 41, US 59, and US 87\\\\. The highway's northern terminus is north of Westhope, North Dakota, at the Canadian border, where it continues as Manitoba Highway 83. The southern terminus is at the Veterans International Bridge in Brownsville, Texas. Together, US 83 and PTH 83 form a continuously numbered north-south highway with a combined distance is 3,450 kilometres (2,140 mi). Despite its length it has very short concurrencies with any interstate highways. Due to the sparse population and primarily rural routing, no segments have been decommissioned. If the road was ever upgraded to interstate status, no numbers in the proper sequence are available as the route is between I-27 and I-29. ==Route descriptionTexas=== US 83 is a largely north‚Äìsouth highway, in length, in Texas except for a segment parallel to the Rio Grande, where it takes an east‚Äìwest course, much of which runs concurrently with the Interstate 2 (I-2) freeway. It enters the United States and Texas near Brownsville concurrent with US 77 and then splits from US 77 at Harlingen. Passing Weslaco with I-2, it begins to veer northward and passes the current western terminus of I-2 at Penitas, follows the Rio Grande to Laredo where it meets I-35 in a concurrency before heading northwestward. It meets I-10 at Junction, where it has a concurrency with I-10, before heading almost due-north to Abilene, meeting I-20 on an expressway before heading north again on mostly undivided surface roads. It again heads slightly west of due north to meet US 287 in Childress and I-40 in Shamrock. About north of Perryton it leaves Texas and enters Oklahoma. Except for Abilene, Laredo, and some cities in the lower Rio Grande Valley it is largely rural in nature. ===Oklahoma=== US 83 traverses the Oklahoma panhandle along the western border of Beaver County, but in this brief stretch it encounters no fewer than three other federal highways. Approximately from the Texas line, US 83 intersects US 412 in the hamlet of Bryan's Corner. Continuing its journey northward, the highway crosses the Beaver River, then intersects US 64 in Turpin. US 83 north and US 64 east are co-signed for three northbound miles, where US 64 turns eastward. At this intersection, US 270 west joins the highway, and together with US 83 proceeds northbound for the final to the Kansas line. ===Kansas=== US 83 enters the Sunflower State in Seward County, approximately south of Liberal, where it intersects US 54 and US-270 ends. North of Liberal, US 83 begins a concurrency with US 160, and the highways remain joined until reaching Sublette, the seat of Haskell County. US 83 and US 160 split north of Sublette; US 160 heads west toward Ulysses, and US 83 continues north toward Garden City. At Garden City, US 50 and US 400 join US 83 for a brief concurrency on a bypass around the east and north sides of the city while US 83 Business follows the former routing through downtown. All three routes cross K-156, also known as Kansas Avenue, in the northwest portion of the city. At the north end of the US 50/US 83 Business route, US 83 splits and heads north toward Scott City, while US 50 and US 400 remain joined through the rest of the state. The highway passes through largely unpopulated areas of Finney County and Scott County before reaching a junction with K-96 in downtown Scott City. In northern Scott County, K-4 has its origins at US-83, heading east toward Healy, and US-83 traverses through rolling farmlands until reaching Oakley, the seat of Logan County. US-83 reaches US-40 less than a mile west of I-70, and the two highways jog west for a brief multiplex before US-83 splits and crosses I-70. North of I-70, US-83 intersects US-24 then curves northeast, east of Gem in Thomas County. US-83 continues its northeasterly track through Rexford and Selden. After passing through Selden, US-83 intersects the southern terminus of K-383 and the northern terminus of K-23. From here, US-83 turns north, crosses into Decatur County then continues north and intersects US-36 in Oberlin. Oberlin is the last area of significant population the highway passes in Kansas; the next city is McCook, Nebraska. ===Nebraska=== A view of the Dismal River, Nebraska Sandhills, and US 83 in Thomas County, Nebraska US 83 enters Nebraska south of McCook, where it meets US 6 and US 34\\\\. It continues northward to North Platte, where it intersects I-80 and US 30\\\\. After leaving North Platte in a northeasterly direction, it turns north near Thedford and goes north through the Sand Hills to Valentine. For before Valentine, it runs concurrently with US 20\\\\. After passing through Valentine, it continues north to enter South Dakota. ===South Dakota=== Looking south at the intersection of US 83 and I-90 in Murdo, South Dakota US 83 enters South Dakota south of Olsonville on a segment of highway which passes through the Rosebud Indian Reservation. After a brief overlap with US 18 in Mission, the route turns north and meets I-90 at Murdo. The two routes overlap as US 83 goes east with I-90 until Vivian, where US 83 turns north. At Fort Pierre, US 83 meets US 14 and South Dakota Highway 34. The three highways overlap as they cross the Missouri River and enter Pierre. At Pierre, SD 34 separates and US 83 turns northeast with US 14\\\\. They separate near Blunt and US 83 turns northward. US 83 briefly overlaps with US 212 near Gettysburg and with US 12 through the Selby area. US 83 leaves South Dakota north of Herreid. The South Dakota section of US 83, with the exception of concurrencies with US 18, I-90, US 14, US 212, and US 12, is defined at South Dakota Codified Laws ¬ß 31-4-180. ===North Dakota=== US 83 enters North Dakota at the South Dakota state line, near the town of Hague, and runs northward for approximately , serving the small cities of Strasburg and Linton before reaching I-94. It follows I-94 west to Bismarck, where it resumes a generally northward course as a four-lane highway. Headed toward Minot US 83 traverses mostly agricultural land, passing through the some small cities such as Wilton, Washburn and Underwood north to Max. Leaving Underwood, US 83 encounters a large strip-mining coal (lignite) operation which can not only be seen from the roadway in the vicinity of Falkirk, but a small viaduct carries coal over the highway. North of Coleharbor, US 83 briefly merges both roadways and shares land with an adjacent railroad line in order to cross a viaduct that separates Lake Sakakawea from Lake Audubon. North of the lakes, the surroundings return to cropland and grazing land, though a wind farm is located south of Minot. US 83 passes directly through Minot, where it is known as Broadway, although the Minot Bypass to the west is an alternate route. From Minot, the northbound route passes Minot Air Force Base where it returns to a two-lane highway, and shares a roadway with eastbound North Dakota Highway 5 about north of the base for about . The highway then diverges from ND 5 to head north to the Canadian border. == Major intersections == US 83 (along with I-2) traveling through a major retail district of McAllen, Texas. ;Texas : at the Veterans International Bridge at Los Tomates at the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border in Brownsville.

The previous year, Governor Hughes had vetoed a bill authorizing such a college.Rodgers, A.D. Liberty Hyde Bailey: A Story of American Plant Sciences. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1949. Both bills followed the state's defunding in 1903 of the New York State College of Forestry at Cornell. Originally a unit of Syracuse University, in 1913, the College was made a separate, legal entity.

Syracuse native and constitutional lawyer Louis Marshall, with a summer residence at Knollwood Club on Saranac Lake and a prime mover for the establishment of the Adirondack and Catskill Forest Preserve (New York), became a Syracuse University Trustee in 1910. He confided in Chancellor James R. Day his desire to have an agricultural and forestry school at the University, and by 1911 his efforts resulted in a New York State bill to fund the project: the aforementioned appropriation bill signed by Governor Dix. Marshall was elected president of the college's board of trustees at its first meeting, in 1911; at the time of his death, eighteen years later, he was still president of the board.Louis Marshall,\\"Champion of Liberty\\", selected papers and addresses(in 2 volumes), edited by Charles Reznikoff,1957.

In 1972, the college's name was changed yet again to State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry. Unlike other state-supported degree-granting institutions which had been created at private institutions in New York State, the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University was an autonomous institution not administratively part of Syracuse University.

Accessed: 6 February 2019. The first research report published in 1913 by the College of Forestry was the result of the above noted USDA Forest Service supported study of the wood-using industries of New York State. Since that time, the research initiatives of the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF) have expanded greatly as both faculty and students conduct pioneering studies, many with a global reach. ESF researchers delve into topics well beyond the boundaries of central New York. Recent international sites of research interest include Madagascar, the Amazon floodplains, Mongolia and the Galapagos Islands. Vermont and the Sierra Nevada are other locales within the US where recent research has focused. Current research efforts include the Willow Biomass Project and the American Chestnut Research and Restoration Project. ==Campus life== Q. robur), direct descendant of Major Oak, of Sherwood Forest, EnglandInterpretive sign, ESF Many students identify themselves as a \\"Stumpy\\" (or \\"Stumpie\\"). The nickname was given to students by their neighbors at Syracuse University, probably in the 1920s, and most-likely refers to forestry \\"stump jumpers\\". Although originally used as an insult, today, most students embrace the nickname with pride. Students at the Syracuse campus enjoy many activities on and off campus. There are a number of student clubs and organizations at ESF, including the Undergraduate Student Association, Graduate Student Association, Woodsmen Team, Bob Marshall Club, Alpha Xi Sigma Honor Society,\\"Alpha Xi Sigma Honor Society,\\" ESF website. Accessed: August 18, 2013. Soccer Team, Sigma Lambda Alpha, The Knothole (weekly newspaper), Papyrus Club, The Empire Forester (yearbook), Landscape Architecture Club (formally the Mollet Club), Forest Engineers Club, Environmental Studies Student Organization, Habitat for Humanity, Ecologue (yearly journal), the Bioethics Society, Green Campus Initiative, Baobab Society, and the Sustainable Energy Club. Wanakena students have their own woodsmen and ice hockey teams. A number of professional organizations are also open to student membership, including the Society of American Foresters, The Wildlife Society, Conservation Biology club, American Fisheries Association, and the (currently defunct) American Water Resources Association. ESF has an agreement with adjacent Syracuse University that allows ESF students to enjoy many amenities offered by SU. ESF students take courses at their sister institution, can apply for admission to concurrent degree and joint certificate programs, and may join any SU organization except for NCAA sports teams. SU students are also welcome to enroll in ESF classes. Because of this, students feel a certain degree of integration with the Syracuse University community. Every May, ESF holds a joint commencement ceremony with Syracuse University in the Carrier Dome. ESF's baccalaureate diplomas bear the seals of both the State University of New York and Syracuse University. Students also enjoy a variety of shops, restaurants, museums, and theaters in Syracuse, and nearby Marshall Street and Westcott Street. == Gateway Center == ESF has launched several programs, both within the confines of campus and other locations to reduce its carbon emissions. The Gateway Center utilizes sustainable energy resources to generate power and heat utilized across the campus. The building includes a state-of-the-art, combined heat-and-power (CHP) system, producing 65% of campus heating needs along with 20% of its electrical needs. The CHP system uses biomass to drive a steam turbine and produce electricity, while natural gas is used for steam heating along with additional electricity. It has been estimated this building alone is responsible for reducing ESF's carbon footprint by 22%. green roof/ garden (foreground) Increased global awareness of global warming and reduced nonrenewable resources has driven ESF to invest in biomass. Biomass is a renewable resource that draws light energy, carbon dioxide, and water from the environment; in return oxygen is released. It can be harvested without negatively affecting the environment. For this reason, ESF launched a program to grow its own biomass, known as the Willow Biomass Project. Benefits of woody willow include, high yields and fast growth times, quick re-sprouting, and high heat energy is produced when burned. Woody willow also increases habitat diversity significantly contributes to carbon neutrality. The Gateway Center was one of the final stages in the school's Climate Action Plan, that encompasses the vision of carbon neutrality and reduced fossil fuel dependence by 2015. Currently, the school rests in Phase III of the program and is on track to reach its goal. Included in Phase III is the opening of The Gateway Center, retrofits to Illick Hall, and rooftop greenhouse replacement. One other advancement towards carbon neutrality can be seen on top of the campus's buildings. Rooftop gardens provide reduced energy consumption and water runoff. Shrubbery, soil thickness, and moisture content all can contribute to increased energy savings. Gateway and other buildings on campus utilize rooftop gardens to reduce energy consumption and water runoff. == Athletics  USCAA === ESF is affiliated with the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA), fielding six teams in four sports: * Basketball, men's * Cross-country, men's & women's * Golf, men's * Soccer, men's and women's ESF athletics is a member of the Hudson Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.\\"HVIAC Members,\\" HVIAC website.

Cox, professor of Landscape Architecture, was responsible for establishing Syracuse University's renowned lacrosse program in 1916, including players from the New York State College of Forestry. ==Affiliation with Syracuse University== ESF was founded in 1911 as the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University, under the leadership of Syracuse University Trustee Louis Marshall, with the active support of Syracuse University Chancellor Day. Its founding followed several years after the cessation of state funding to the earlier New York State College of Forestry at Cornell.Education & Agriculture, A History of the NYS College of Agriculture at Cornell University, 1963, by Gould P. Colman, page 161, Cornell University Press ESF is an autonomous institution, administratively separate from Syracuse University, while some resources, facilities and infrastructure are shared. The two schools share a common Schedule of Classes; students may take courses at both institutions, and baccalaureate diplomas from ESF bear the Syracuse University seal along with that of the State University of New York. A number of concurrent degree programs and certificates are offered between the schools. ESF receives an annual appropriation as part of the SUNY budget and the state builds and maintains all of the college's educational facilities. The state has somewhat similar financial and working relationships with five statutory colleges that are at Alfred University and Cornell University, although unlike ESF, these statutory institutions are legally and technically part of their respective host institutions and are administered by them as well. ESF faculty, students, and students' families join those from Syracuse University (SU) in a joint convocation ceremony at the beginning of the academic year in August and combined commencement exercises in May. ESF and SU students share access to library resources, recreational facilities, student clubs, and activities at both institutions, except for the schools' intercollegiate athletics teams, affiliated with the USCAA and NCAA, respectively. ==Traditions== The best known tradition among ESF students is that walking across the quad is shunned. The tradition, which dates back to at least the early 1960s, is intended to inhibit tracks from being worn into the lawn. Hecklers have been known to yell and even tackle people walking across the quad. However, other activities such as frisbee and soccer playing are encouraged on the Quad. Eustace B. Nifkin, ESF's previous mascot, is an unofficial student. He first appeared in the 1940s after a group of students summering in the Adirondacks thought him up. Ever since, he has appeared on class rosters, written articles for The Knothole, and sent mail to the College from around the world. He has a girlfriend, the lesser-known Elsa S. Freeborn. SUNY granted him a bachelor's degree in 1972. The Alumni Lounge in Marshall Hall is dedicated to Nifkin. Another well known legend is that of Chainer or Chainsaw who supposedly graduated in 1993.

The anti-cosmopolitan campaign began in 1946 when Joseph Stalin attacked writers who were ethnic Jews in a speech in Moscow and culminated in the exposure of the non-existent Doctors' Plot in 1953. == Origin == The expression was coined in the 19th century by Russian literary critic Vissarion Belinsky to describe writers who lacked Russian national character.Orlando Figes The Whisperers: Private Life in Stalin's Russia, 2007, , page 494. The idea also comes from German Romantic criticism of Bodenlosigkeit (\\"absence of roots\\", \\"ground\\"). == Use under Stalin == According to the journalist Masha Gessen, a concise definition of rootless cosmopolitan appeared in an issue of Voprosy istorii (The Issues of History) in 1949: \\"The rootless cosmopolitan [...] falsifies and misrepresents the worldwide historical role of the Russian people in the construction of socialist society and the victory over the enemies of humanity, over German fascism in the Great Patriotic War.\\" Gessen states that the term used for \\"Russian\\" is an exclusive term that means ethnic Russians only and so she concludes that \\"any historian who neglected to sing the praises of the heroic ethnic Russians [...] was a likely traitor\\".

An example is a stockbroker who buys and sells securities in a portfolio more frequently than is necessary, in order to generate commission fees. Dollar cost averaging is a form of product churn under certain conditions. In this strategy, an investor is advised to repeatedly buy or sell small lots of a security as the price changes. Each transaction carries a commission fee. In this way the overall cost is averaged down as prices fall, and the investor is protected from market fluctuations which can be very difficult to accurately predict. The effectiveness of this as an investing strategy is open to debate, but it involves many transactions, creating brokerage commissions for the brokerage firm. Frequent trading in fee-based accounts is not an example of churning, since no commissions are generated in those transactions. However, the practice of putting clients who trade infrequently into a fee-based brokerage account is known as \\"reverse churning\\", since clients are charged fees in accounts with few if any transactions.FINRA Fines Brokerage Firm For Reverse Churning Another form of product churning is sometimes practiced by maintenance service providers. By replacing worn-out parts with inferior quality parts, they are assured of a greater frequency of service requests. Companies sometimes intentionally deliver products which are not durable or reliable, so that the customer will have to replace them. Similarly, new models might be made incompatible with accessories used with old models to force consumers to purchase replacements. Another example is refreshments and snacks sold in theaters, fairs, and other venues. Small servings are proportionally more expensive than large servings. Customers choose the bigger size even if it is more than they would like to eat or drink because it seems like a better deal. Textbook publishers are often accused of product churning for their practice of frequently publishing new editions of their texts (thus rendering previous editions obsolete, forcing students to purchase the new editions as required texts and minimizing or eliminating the prices paid for the old editions by bookstore buyback programs), often while making insignificant changes to the information presented in the text. Product churning is similar to the razor and blades business model. This involves selling a basic product at a loss (or low profit margin), but receiving very high profit margins on associated products that are necessary for the basic product's continued usage. Examples of this strategy include razors (and their blades), computer printers (and their ink cartridge refills), cell phones (and their usage time), and cameras (and film). ==See also== * Low cost broker * Planned obsolescence ==References== Category:Brand management Category:Ethically disputed business practices Category:Product management Category:Personal selling Category:Business terms ","title":"Product churning"},{"id":"523211","text":" The Fairey Albacore was a British single-engine carrier-borne biplane torpedo bomber built by Fairey Aviation between 1939 and 1943 for the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm and used during the Second World War.

Early Albacores were fitted with the Bristol Taurus II engine and those built later received the more powerful Taurus XII. Boscombe Down testing of the Albacore and Taurus II engine, in February 1940, showed a maximum speed of 160 mph (258 km/h), at an altitude of 4,800 ft (1,463 m), at 11,570 lb (5,259 kg), which was achieved with four under-wing depth charges, while maximum speed without the depth charges was 172 mph (277 km/h). An Albacore fitted with the Taurus II engine and carrying a torpedo weighed 11,100 lb (5,045 kg). A total of 800 Albacores were built, including two prototypes which were all built at Fairey's Hayes Factory and test flown at London's Great West Aerodrome, what is now London Heathrow Airport. ==Operational history== Fairey Albacore N4389, 827 Naval Air Squadron, . Shot down during raid on Kirkenes, July 1941. Salvaged, rebuilt and now on display in the FAA Museum No. 826 Naval Air Squadron was specially formed to operate the first Albacores in March 1940, being used for attacks against harbours and shipping in the English Channel, operating from shore bases and for convoy escort for the rest of 1940. s 826 and 829 Squadrons were the first to operate the Albacore from a carrier, with operations starting in November 1940. Initially, the Albacore suffered from reliability problems with the Taurus engine, although these were later solved, so that the failure rate was no worse than the Pegasus equipped Swordfish. The Albacore remained less popular than the Swordfish, as it was less manoeuvrable, with the controls being too heavy for a pilot to take much evasive action after dropping a torpedo. Eventually, there were 15 first-line FAA squadrons equipped with the Albacore which operated widely in the Mediterranean. Albacores played a prominent role in the ill-fated raid on Kirkenes and Petsamo in July 1941. Albacores participated with more success in the Battle of Cape Matapan and the fighting at El Alamein as well as supporting the landings at Sicily and Salerno. During the period September 1941 to end of June 1943, No. 828 Squadron, based at RAF Hal Far, Malta, operated a squadron of Albacores under severe blitz conditions during the siege of Malta, mainly against Italian shipping and shore targets in Sicily. Albacore in flight. The markings place it around 1940. On 9 March 1942, 12 Albacores from were launched to attack the German at sea near Narvik. Based on information from one of six radar-equipped aircraft already airborne, Albacores from 817 and 832 Squadrons launched torpedoes and some also attacked with their machine guns. One attack came within of success at the bow, but the FAA's only torpedo attack on Tirpitz at sea failed, with the loss of two aircraft and damage to many others. In 1943, the Albacore was progressively replaced in Fleet Air Arm service by the Barracuda. The last FAA Albacore squadron, No. 841 Squadron, which had been used for shore-based attacks against shipping in the Channel for the whole of its career with the Albacore, disbanded in late 1943. The Royal Air Force deployed some Albacores; No. 36 Squadron based at Singapore acquired five to supplement its Vickers Vildebeests at RAF Seletar in December 1941. The remnants of the squadron was captured by the Japanese in March 1942. In 1943, No. 415 Squadron RCAF was equipped with Albacores (presumably ex-FAA) before the Flight operating them was transferred and reformed as 119 Squadron at RAF Manston in July 1944. The squadron deployed later to Belgium and their Albacores were disposed of in early 1945, due to spares shortages, in favour of the inferior but ASV radar-equipped Swordfish Mk.IIIs that the squadron kept until the end of the war on 8 May. This was to combat German mini- submarines attacking Allied shipping entering the River Scheldt on its way to Antwerp Port. The Aden Communication Flight used 17 Albacores between the middle of 1944 and August 1946. Some of these were delivered by sea on the in December 1945 (all from Royal Navy stock). The Royal Canadian Air Force took over the Albacores and used them during the Normandy invasion, for a similar role until July 1944. The Albacore was the last biplane to be used in combat by the RCAF. ==Operators== ;: * Royal Canadian Air Force ** No. 415 Squadron RCAF HMS Formidable during the North African landings, November 1942 ;: * Royal Air Force ** No. 36 Squadron RAF ** No. 119 Squadron RAF * Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm :* 700 Naval Air Squadron :* 733 Naval Air Squadron :* 747 Naval Air Squadron :* 750 Naval Air Squadron :* 753 Naval Air Squadron :* 754 Naval Air Squadron :* 756 Naval Air Squadron :* 763 Naval Air Squadron :* 766 Naval Air Squadron :* 767 Naval Air Squadron :* 768 Naval Air Squadron :* 769 Naval Air Squadron :* 771 Naval Air Squadron :* 774 Naval Air Squadron :* 775 Naval Air Squadron :* 778 Naval Air Squadron :* 781 Naval Air Squadron :* 782 Naval Air Squadron :* 783 Naval Air Squadron :* 785 Naval Air Squadron :* 786 Naval Air Squadron :* 787 Naval Air Squadron :* 788 Naval Air Squadron :* 789 Naval Air Squadron :* 791 Naval Air Squadron :* 793 Naval Air Squadron :* 796 Naval Air Squadron :* 797 Naval Air Squadron :* 799 Naval Air Squadron :* 810 Naval Air Squadron :* 815 Naval Air Squadron :* 817 Naval Air Squadron :* 818 Naval Air Squadron :* 820 Naval Air Squadron :* 821 Naval Air Squadron :* 822 Naval Air Squadron :* 823 Naval Air Squadron :* 826 Naval Air Squadron :* 827 Naval Air Squadron :* 828 Naval Air Squadron :* 829 Naval Air Squadron :* 830 Naval Air Squadron :* 831 Naval Air Squadron :* 832 Naval Air Squadron :* 841 Naval Air Squadron ==Surviving aircraft== Albacore (N4389) at the Fleet Air Arm Museum Only one Albacore is known to survive, on display at the Fleet Air Arm Museum, which was built using parts of Albacores N4389 and N4172 recovered from crash sites. ==Specifications (Albacore with Taurus XII)== Fairey Albacore Mk.1 ==See also== ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * * ==External links== * Fleet Air Arm Archive * 828 Squadron (TSR) Albacores: Malta War-Time Diaries 1941-1943 Sgt.

Accessed 2010-08-29 in a lower-class family. He initially worked as kitchen helper at the Jesuit school at Krumlov, but was eventually admitted to the Krumlov Seminary of poor students in 1590. Jakub eventually graduated from the Krumlov Gymnasium, where he studied poetry and rhetoric, and became a pharmacist himself. There he also worked in the college's pharmacy, on topics involving chemistry and herbalism, under the overseeing of Martin Schaffner (1564‚Äì1608).Johannes Schmidl (1754) Historiae Societatis Jesu Provinciae Bohemiae, part III (1616-1632), Prague By 1598, he started studying Aristotelian philosophy at the Clementinum college in Prague (which was later merged with Charles University), and at the same time oversaw the kitchen and pantry, but continued working in chemistry and pharmacy. However, Sinapius was not satisfied with the teachings there, learning Barbara and Celare, instead of physics and the origins of nature. Because his herbal skills to treat illness impressed, he was allowed gardening near the river Vltava, under the Br√§ke. Here he grew herbs and set up a laboratory at Sm√≠chov (then a village behind Prague walls), the Clementinum's botanical garden. There, or at the garden, he distilled a very popular Aqua Sinapis (\\"Die Sinapischen Wasser\\", Horczicze in Latin means mustard, hence mustard water) whose sale made him a wealthy man. In 1600, he became the administrator of the Jesuit college in Jind≈ôich≈Øv Hradec, and in 1606 he became capitaneus and administrator of the properties of the St. George's Convent in the Prague Castle. In 1607 he was named imperial chemist by Rudolf II. In return for curing the emperor of a grave disease, he was ennobled with the title \\"de Tepenec\\", presumably after the medieval Tepenec Castle (destroyed in 1391) near Olomouc. He lent emperor Rudolf II money and received from him in return an estate around town Mƒõln√≠k. He also supported students of the studies of catholic theology financially. In the religious disputes of the early 17th century, Jakub strongly defended the Catholic side. He became the administrator of the but was jailed in 1620, when the Protestants took charge of the town. Subsequently, was exchanged by another prisoner (famous physician Jessenius) and exiled, but later, after defeating of the Bohemian Revolt, he returned to Mƒõln√≠k and lived there the rest of his life. He died in 1622, from a horse-fall that he had suffered a year before. Two days before his death he was moved to the Clementinum at the care of the Jesuits, and left them the sum of 50,000 gold coins and his Mƒõln√≠k estate. He is buried in the Church of St. Salvator in the Clementinum. ==Writings== In 1609 he published a pro-Catholic pamphlet which saw several reprintings. According to a 1777 source, he had written several manuscripts on chemistry and botany. ==Connection to the Voynich manuscript== Book dealer Wilfrid Voynich saw Jakub's name and title at the bottom of the first page of the Voynich manuscript. Voynich saw the faint writing later revealed as Jacobus Sinapius (Jacobus Ho≈ôƒçick√Ω de Tepenec), Voynich subsequently used many chemicals to make it clearer but failed. It was later revealed by ultraviolet light and has been compared with other samples of his signature. Jakub is thus the second person known to have owned the Voynich manuscript after Emperor Rudolf II. Its attested provenance begins with him, since the story that it was owned by Emperor Rudolf II rests on a single piece of unsubstantiated hearsay, related at second hand in a letter to Athanasius Kircher. ==References== Category:1575 births Category:1622 deaths Category:17th-century Bohemian physicians Category:Czech pharmacists ","title":"Jacobus Sinapius"},{"id":"523224","text":"Location of Blue Ball, Ohio Blue Ball is a community in Butler and Warren counties, in the U.S. state of Ohio.

The crater Marci on the far side of the Moon is named after him. == Career == Marci was born in Lan≈°kroun, near the border between historical lands Bohemia and Moravia (presently parts of the Czech Republic). He studied under Athanasius Kircher, and spent most of his career as a professor of Charles University in Prague, where he served eight times as Dean of the medical school and once as Rector in 1662. He was also the personal doctor of Emperors Ferdinand III and Leopold I, and distinguished himself in the defense of Prague against the Swedish armies in 1648. In October 1654 he was given the nobility title (falckrabƒõ) \\"de Kronland\\" (anagram of \\"Landskron\\", German name for the city of Lan≈°kroun). It is contested whether Marci was a member of the Royal Society. Some claim that he was elected as a corresponding member in 1667. Other dispute this and argue that a Fellowship was not granted due to his death in this year. Unlike in the legend spread by Jesuit order MacDonnell, Joseph. Companions of Jesuits: A History of Collaboration.Detroit: NU-AD Inc., 1995, p. 78., he did not join the Jesuit order shortly before his death. == Work == Marci's studies covered the mechanics of colliding bodies, epilepsy, and the refraction of light, as well as other topics. Prior to Marci, the prevailing theory of color assumed that light was modified by the action of a medium to produce color. Most theories were based upon the assumption that color was simply a modification of light varying between whiteness and blackness. Marci preceded Isaac Newton in his belief that \\"Light is not changed into colors except by a certain refraction in a dense medium; and the diverse species of colors are the products of refraction.\\"Richard S. Westfall, \\"The Development of Newton's Theory of Color\\" ISIS, Vol. 53, No. 3 (Sept. 1962) pp. 339-358 Although he thought that different colors were caused by varying angles of incidence across the 1/2 degree apparent diameter of the sun, he stated that each color was condensed or disentangled from the others after refraction into homogeneous or elementary colors of red, green, blue and purple, and that no further change in color was obtained by additional refraction of elementary colors.Carl B. Boyer, The Rainbow from Myth to Mathematics (1959) Marci at some time came into possession of the Voynich Manuscript, apparently upon the death of its former owner, the alchemist Georg Baresch. He sent the book to his longtime friend Athanasius Kircher, with a cover letter dated 19 August 1666, or possibly 1665. This cover letter has remained intact and was present when the manuscript was obtained by Wilfrid Voynich. He is remembered today by the award of an annual medal to distinguished scientists by the Slovak-Czech Spectroscopy Society. == Books == * Operatricum Idea (1635) * Idearum operaticum idea (1636) * De proportione motus seu regula sphygmica (1639) * Thaumantias.

It was founded in 1925 by Linus A. Sims as Hammond Junior College. Sims succeeded in getting the campus moved to north Hammond in 1928, when it became known as Southeastern Louisiana College. It achieved university status in 1970. In the fall of 2019 there were 14,298 students enrolled. During the 1990s, Southeastern was one of the fastest-growing colleges in the United States. The university is the third largest in Louisiana, trailing only LSU and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Southeastern's colors are green and gold, and the mascot is a lion named Roomie. Southeastern's sports teams participate in NCAA Division I (FCS for football) in the Southland Conference. ==History== Commons Area in Southeastern's War Memorial Student Union What began as a junior college supported by local taxes developed into a major university as Southeastern has grown to meet the evolving needs of southeast Louisiana and the Florida parishes.Southeastern Louisiana University. (2006). A Brief History of Southeastern . Fayard Hall, completed in 2001, makes practical use of brick, glass, light, and open space. On July 7, 1925, the voters overwhelmingly approved a bond issue that created Hammond Junior College. Operated under the auspices of the Tangipahoa Parish School Board, Sims opened the doors on September 14, 1925, with a faculty of three women and two men and 40 students. The two-year coeducational institution offered basic undergraduate work in arts and sciences that culminated in a teaching certificate. Rapidly increasing enrollments quickly forced the college out of its two rooms in Hammond High School. In 1927, voters supported the purchase of the Hunter Leake estate on Hammond's north end. In 1928, Hammond Junior College became Southeastern Louisiana College, formally adopted into the state educational system under the control of the State Board of Education. The purchase of adjoining the original plot provided the space to develop a suitable campus. In 1934, a state bond issue provided for the construction of McGehee Hall and a gymnasium. Lucius McGehee Hall was built in 1935. it is the oldest building constructed by the University. McGehee Hall is on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1937, the State Board of Education authorized curricula for four-year programs in liberal arts, teacher education, business administration, music, social sciences, and physical education. The first baccalaureate degrees were conferred in May 1939. Part of the campus, looking east: Zachary Taylor Hall (left foreground), Tangipahoa Hall (middle), Linus A. Sims Memorial Library (right). Zachary Taylor Hall is the only academic building in Louisiana named for the sole President to come from Louisiana. Voter approval of Act 388 in 1938, an amendment to the 1920 Louisiana Constitution, granted Southeastern Louisiana College the same legal status as other four-year colleges. The amendment did not, however, require the state to fund Southeastern at the level of other institutions of higher education, despite strong local support. On January 18, 1946, the State Board made available funds to purchase seven city blocks east and west of the campus, and of land north and northwest of the campus, increasing Southeastern's total area to approximately . On March 3, 1946, Southeastern was formally approved and accepted into full membership in the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), as a four-year degree-granting institution. Friendship Circle on Southeastern's campus is dominated by Friendship Oak. This tree is hundreds of years old. Like other mature spreading oaks, Friendship Oak is maintained by arborists to prevent the limbs from growing into the ground. After World War II, returning G.I.s caused exponential growth of the college, necessitating construction of classrooms, a student union, a cafeteria, a health center, dormitories, apartments for married students, and many surplus temporary buildings donated by the federal government. In 1948, the U.S. Navy contributed two steel barracks for use as dormitories including McNeely Hall (which was demolished in 2007). In 1960, the State Board authorized Southeastern to offer master's degrees through the newly formed Division of Graduate Studies. Southeastern began awarding the Education Specialist degree in 1967. The War Memorial Student Union, constructed in the mid-1960s, is the only student union building in the United States dedicated to alumni who died in World War II. In 1969, the college awarded its first Distinguished Alumnus Award to jazz pianist Bill Evans. Governor John McKeithen on June 16, 1970, signed into law the legislative act turning Southeastern Louisiana College into Southeastern Louisiana University. Early 1970s also saw the construction of D Vickers, the Athletics Building, and the C.E. Cate Teacher Education Building. After years of planning and fundraising, the Southeastern Louisiana University Center was constructed. An 8000-seat (more if the floor level is used) arena, the University Center hosts all home basketball games and a variety of civic, cultural, and big-name entertainment events. Lucius McGehee Hall was named for Hammond physician Lucius W. McGehee. McGehee Hall, a sturdy example of Depression Gothic architecture, is on the National Register of Historic Places in Louisiana. Shown is the intricate masonry of the southwest corner. Bicycles are a widespread mode of transportation at Southeastern, and bikeracks are adjacent to all major edifices. In October 1986, a group of faculty members launched Fanfare, a festival celebrating the arts, humanities and sciences. Since then, Fanfare has become an acclaimed month-long event, drawing nationally and internationally recognized artists and providing recognition for those closer to home. In addition to providing entertainment for Lake Pontchartrain's Northshore Area, Fanfare has an educational-outreach program that works closely with local schools. In October 2005, Fanfare proudly celebrated its 20th anniversary. Southeastern's enrollment, continually increasing since its inception, reached an important milestone in 1997, registering over 15 thousand students for the fall semester. Pervasive professional accreditations, such as accreditation of the College of Business by AACSB, and excellent egress from/to I-55 and I-12 figure significantly in the increase. From its founding in 1925 until 2009, Southeastern has conferred more than 50,000 degrees. As Southeastern celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2000, the fall semester marked an exciting change as Southeastern implemented screened admissions standards for the first time. Also during the 2000‚Äì2001 academic year, the Village, Fayard Hall, and the Claude B. Pennington, Jr., Student Activity Center were completed. Southeastern's main entrance is connected to I-55 via LA 3234 (University Avenue), a multilane thoroughfare. Background: Saint Tammany Hall, namesake of Saint Tammany Parish. In May 2001, Southeastern received full approval from the Board of Regents for its first new graduate degree program in more than a decade, an MS in Integrated Science and Technology. Since then, Southeastern received approval for seven additional programs: MA in Organizational Communications, MS in Applied Sociology, BS in Athletic Training, BS in Health Education & Promotion, BS in Health Studies, BS in Occupational Health, Safety & Environment, and Master of Arts in Teaching. In 2001 Southeastern took ownership of the historic Columbia Theatre for the Performing Arts in downtown Hammond. The theater is operated by a separate foundation and presents a variety of theatrical works, concerts, and dance performances. In Fall 2003, Southeastern hit a record enrollment of 15,662 students. Fall 2003 also saw the return of football to Strawberry Stadium, after an 18-year hiatus. The Lions completed the season 5‚Äì7. In the fall of 2004, Southeastern began implementing portions of the Board of Regents Master Plan admissions criteria, a full year ahead of schedule and before any other schools in the state. In Fall 2005, Southeastern began its first year under the full Board of Regents Master Plan admissions criterion. In the same semester Southeastern, which was virtually undamaged by Hurricane Katrina, absorbed some two thousand students whom the storm had displaced from institutions in New Orleans. North of the War Memorial Student Union is a large fountain constructed and dedicated in 2007 to the victims of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita; it is the only such memorial fountain in existence. Southeastern's parking was augmented in 2008 by this facility undertaken by the Student Government Association: a parking garage fitted to Strawberry Stadium. Initiated by the students and paid for by student fees and parking permits, it is one of only two parking garages on public university campuses in Louisiana. Southeastern President John L. Crain addresses the Faculty Senate about the budget. John Alario, dean of the Louisiana State Senate, is a graduate of Southeastern. Another Southeastern alumnus was the late State Representative Donald Ray Kennard, who began representing parts of East Baton Rouge and Livingston parishes starting in 1976. Kennard is also a former president of the Southeastern Alumni Association. See also Southeastern Louisiana University alumni.

Southeastern owns the Columbia Theatre for the Performing Arts in Hammond's Historic District. First opened in 1928, the Columbia was acquired by the university in the 1990s and renovated in the amount of $5.6 million. The large foyer is dedicated to the late State Senator John Hainkel, who was instrumental in obtaining the funding for the renovation. ==Academics== Southeastern Louisiana University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) to award degrees at the Associate, Baccalaureate and Master's levels.

Leche (1898‚Äì1965). It is a large medallion on the north exterior wall of the east side of Strawberry Stadium. Southeastern offers nursing curricula in Hammond and Baton Rouge. In a consortium with the University of Louisiana at Lafayette Southeastern offers a master of science in nursing. Southeastern became a doctoral-granting institution in 2005 with the inauguration of a doctor of education in higher education leadership. Southeastern's business programs are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). Southeastern was the first institution in Louisiana to achieve AACSB's separate and special accreditation in accounting. Graduates of both the MBA program and the Executive MBA program are serving widely in education and industry. In the aftermath of Tulane University's post-Katrina decision to close several engineering programs including computer engineering, Southeastern received approval from the Louisiana Board of Regents to develop an undergraduate curriculum in engineering technology within the Department of Computer Science & Industrial Technology. ==Campus locations== * Southeastern's main campus is located in Hammond in Tangipahoa Parish.

In the background is the simultaneously completed building for the Department of Kinesiology and Health Studies. Southeastern has several state-of-the-art athletic facilities, including an eight-lane all-weather running track completed in 2011 (see inset). == Media == Southeastern's major campus media and publications are the Lion's Roar (newspaper), KSLU (FM radio station), ByLion (weekly online publication), the Southeastern Channel (public access cable television channel), and Le Souvenir (official yearbook). === The Lion's Roar === The Lion's Roar is the official newspaper of the students of Southeastern Louisiana University. Distributed on Tuesdays, it is published weekly during regular semesters and monthly during the summer semester. The Lion's Roar is planned, written, designed, created, and published by the students of Southeastern Louisiana University working in the Office of Student Publications, a part of the Division of Student Affairs. The Lion's Roar has been in continuous publication since 1937.The Lion's Roar Newspaper. === KSLU radio station === Southeastern's KSLU-FM radio station began operation on November 11, 1974, as a radio club at the university, operating at 10 watts of power. Initially the station was on the air a few hours a day during the week; the transmitter was turned off during weekends and holidays. Thanks to support from the Student Government Association and self-assessed fees of the student body, in 1983 the station qualified for membership in the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Since that time the station has grown to 3,000 watts, the maximum allowed because of the crowded 88‚Äì92 MHz band and the university's proximity to Baton Rouge and New Orleans. In 1988, KSLU became the first radio station in the South to install a digital touchscreen operating system. The installation was featured in Broadcast Engineering magazine and visited by radio personnel from across the world.

The broadcast schedule offers non-commercial programs, with offerings including local talk shows, entertainment and sports news, campus and community activities. In 1993, an emergency-situation room was added using amateur radio equipment purchased with grants from State Farm Insurance and Louisiana Power & Light (a subsidiary of Entergy). During critical times, this room is staffed by local ham operators, members of the Amateur Radio Emergency Service in the Florida Parishes area. In the past, the station produced several political forums which were fed to all public radio stations in Louisiana and to commercial stations via the Louisiana News Network. The year 1996 brought another phase as KSLU began broadcasting globally via the internet, enabling families of international and out-of-state students to hear live university events.Southeastern Louisiana University.

It is closely related to the genus Aster and the true daisy Bellis. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution in dry, mountainous areas and grassland, with the highest diversity in North America.Linnaeus, Carl von. 1753. Species Plantarum 2: 863-865 in LatinTropicos, Erigeron L.The Plant List, search for Erigeron ==Etymology== Erigeron annuus Its English name, fleabane, is shared with related plants in several other genera. It appears to be derived from a belief that the dried plants repelled fleasFrances Perry wrote in Collins Guide to Border Plants (2nd edition, 1956) p.146 that it was reputed to repel insects but that the name referred to a tropical species which has a particularly strong odour or that the plants were poisonous to fleas.see Oxford English Dictionary under 'Flea-bane' and under 'Bane' para 2.b. The earliest quotation cited in the O.E.D. is dated 1813 when Humphry Davy in Elements of Agricultural Chemistry stated that the fleabane of Canada had only recently been found in Europe The generic name Erigeron is derived from the Ancient Greek words (√™ri) \\"early in the morning\\" and (g√©r≈çn) \\"old man\\", a reference to the appearance of the white hairs of the fruit soon after flowering or possibly alluding to the early appearance of the seed heads.Frances Perry: Collins Guide to Border Plants 2nd edition (1956) p.145 The noun is masculine, so that specific epithets should have masculine endings (e.g. glaucus) to agree with it. However, authors have incorrectly used neuter endings (e.g. glaucum), because the ending -on resembles the ending of Ancient Greek neuter second declension nouns, as Augustin Pyramus de Candolle did in his 1836 account of the genus. ==Description== The species may be annuals, biennials or perennials. They are well-branched with erect stems, characterized by their numerous white, lavender or pink ray flowers and yellow disc flowers. Some members of this group have no ray flowers. The pappus (= modified calyx, forming a crown) is shorter than in Aster, and consists of bristles. The ray florets are narrower than in Aster, but are clearly longer than the involucre (= whorled bracts). ==Cultivation== Many species are used as ornamental plants, with numerous named cultivars such as 'Wayne Roderick', 'Charity', 'Foersters Liebling' and 'Dunkelste aller' (\\"The darkest of all\\" with semi- double, deep violet flower heads). ==Ecology== Erigeron species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Bucculatrix angustata, Coleophora squamosella (which feeds exclusively on E. acris), Schinia intermontana, Schinia obscurata (both of which also feed exclusively on Erigeron), Schinia sexata (which feeds exclusively on E. glabellus) and Schinia villosa. ==Selected species== ==References== ==Bibliography== * ==External links== * Fleabane species and cultivars * Mountain and Desert Plants of the Southwest * Darrell's Fleabane Info Page Category:Asteraceae genera Category:Astereae Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Erigeron"},{"id":"523236","text":"\\"God of the gaps\\" is a theological perspective in which gaps in scientific knowledge are taken to be evidence or proof of God's existence. The term \\"gaps\\" was initially used by Christian theologians not to discredit theism but rather to point out the fallacy of relying on teleological arguments for God's existence. p. 333.See, for example, \\"Teleological Arguments for God's Existence\\" in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. ==Origins of the term== From the 1880s, Friedrich Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Part Two, \\"On Priests\\", said \\"... into every gap they put their delusion, their stopgap, which they called God.\\".https://antilogicalism.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/the-portable- nietzsche-walter-kaufmann.pdf page 204. The German reads \\"... in jede L√ºcke hatten sie ihren Wahn gestellt, ihren L√ºckenb√º√üer, den sie Gott nannten.\\" The concept, although not the exact wording, goes back to Henry Drummond, a 19th- century evangelist lecturer, from his Lowell Lectures on The Ascent of Man. He chastises those Christians who point to the things that science cannot yet explain‚Äî\\"gaps which they will fill up with God\\"‚Äîand urges them to embrace all nature as God's, as the work of \\"an immanent God, which is the God of Evolution, is infinitely grander than the occasional wonder-worker, who is the God of an old theology.\\"See Thomas Dixon Science and Religion: A Very Short Introduction p. 45 p. 333 In 1933, Ernest Barnes, the Bishop of Birmingham, used the phrase in a discussion of general relativity's implication of a Big Bang: During World War II the German theologian and martyr Dietrich Bonhoeffer expressed the concept in similar terms in letters he wrote while in a Nazi prison. Bonhoeffer wrote, for example: In his 1955 book Science and Christian Belief Charles Alfred Coulson (1910‚àí1974) wrote: and Coulson was a mathematics professor at Oxford University as well as a Methodist church leader, often appearing in the religious programs of British Broadcasting Corporation. His book got national attention,The Fontana edition cites reviews from The Times Literary Supplement, New Statesman, and Manchester Guardian, was reissued as a paperback, and was reprinted several times, most recently in 1971. It is claimed that the actual phrase 'God of the gaps' was invented by Coulson.C. Southgate et al.(1999), God, Humanity and the Cosmos: A Textbook in Science and Religion, T. & T. Clark, p. 247.A. Hough, Not a Gap in Sight: Fifty Years of Charles Coulson's Science and Christian Belief, Theology 2006 109: 21‚àí27. Hough writes, p. 24: :The concept was certainly present, but according to Southgate it was Coulson who devised the actual terminology which we now use and which has been adapted to provide the title of the present article. The idea that Coulson coined this phrase is supported by the fact that he used it without reference or explanation and as a natural self-explanatory part of his argument. The term was then used in a 1971 book and a 1978 article, by Richard Bube. He articulated the concept in greater detail in Man come of Age: Bonhoeffer‚Äôs Response to the God-of-the-Gaps (1978). Bube attributed modern crises in religious faith in part to the inexorable shrinking of the God-of- the-gaps as scientific knowledge progressed. As humans progressively increased their understanding of nature, the previous \\"realm\\" of God seemed to many persons and religions to be getting smaller and smaller by comparison. Bube maintained that Darwin's Origin of Species was the \\"death knell\\" of the God- of-the-gaps. Bube also maintained that the God-of-the-gaps was not the same as the God of the Bible (that is, he was not making an argument against God per se, but rather asserting there was a fundamental problem with the perception of God as existing in the gaps of present-day knowledge).Man Come of Age: Bonhoeffer‚Äôs Response to the God-of-the-Gaps. Richard Bube. Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society. Volume 14. 1971. pp.203‚Äì220. ==General usage== The term \\"God of the gaps\\" is sometimes used in describing the incremental retreat of religious explanations of physical phenomena in the face of increasingly comprehensive scientific explanations for those phenomena.Richard Bube (1971) The Human Quest: A New Look at Science and the Christian Faith Dorothy Dinnerstein includes psychological explanations for developmental distortions leading to a person believing in a deity, particularly a male deity.See, e.g., Dinnerstein, Dorothy, The Mermaid and the Minotaur. R. Laird Harris writes of the physical science aspect of this: > The expression, \\"God of the Gaps,\\" contains a real truth. It is erroneous if > it is taken to mean that God is not immanent in natural law but is only to > be observed in mysteries unexplained by law. No significant Christian group > has believed this view. It is true, however, if it be taken to emphasize > that God is not only immanent in natural law but also is active in the > numerous phenomena associated with the supernatural and the spiritual. There > are gaps in a physical-chemical explanation of this world, and there always > will be. Because science has learned many marvelous secrets of nature, it > cannot be concluded that it can explain all phenomena. Meaning, soul, > spirits, and life are subjects incapable of physical-chemical explanation or > formation.Harris, L. L, \\"The God of the Gaps\\". JASA. Vol.15.No.4. Dec. 1963. > pp. 101‚Äì104. ==Usage in referring to a type of argument== The term God-of-the-gaps fallacy can refer to a position that assumes an act of God as the explanation for an unknown phenomenon, which is a variant of an argument from ignorance fallacy.Michael Shermer (2003) How We Believe: Science, Skepticism, and the Search for God, p 115 ff.Robert Larmer, \\"Is there anything wrong with 'God of the gaps' reasoning?\\" International Journal for Philosophy of Religion, Volume 52, Number 3 / December, 2002, p 129 ff. Such an argument is sometimes reduced to the following form: *There is a gap in understanding of some aspect of the natural world. *Therefore, the cause must be supernatural. One example of such an argument, which uses God as an explanation of one of the current gaps in biological science, is as follows: \\"Because current science can't figure out exactly how life started, it must be God who caused life to start.\\" Critics of intelligent design creationism, for example, have accused proponents of using this basic type of argument.See, e.g., Mark Isaak (2006) The Counter- Creationism Handbook pp x, 11‚Äì12, 35. God-of-the-gaps arguments have been discouraged by some theologians who assert that such arguments tend to relegate God to the leftovers of science: as scientific knowledge increases, the dominion of God decreases.Thomas Dixon \\"Science and Religion: A Very Short Introduction\\" p. 45Man Come of Age: Bonhoeffer‚Äôs Response to the God-Of-The- Gaps, Richard Bube, 1971 ==Criticism== The term was invented as a criticism of people who perceive that God only acts in the gaps, and who restrict God's activity to such \\"gaps\\".Larmer, Robert (2002). Is there anything wrong with ‚ÄúGod of the gaps‚Äù reasoning? . International Journal for Philosophy of Religion. Kluwer Academic Publishers. Netherlands. 52: 129‚Äì142. It has also been argued that the God-of-the-gaps view is predicated on the assumption that any event which can be explained by science automatically excludes God; that if God did not do something via direct action, that he had no role in it at all.God of the gaps ‚Äì Science & Theology The \\"God of the gaps\\" argument, as traditionally advanced by scholarly Christians, was intended as a criticism against weak or tenuous faith, not as a statement against theism or belief in God.Charles Alfred Coulson (1955) Science and Christian Belief, p 20. According to John Habgood in The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology, the phrase is generally derogatory, and is inherently a direct criticism of a tendency to postulate acts of God to explain phenomena for which science has yet to give a satisfactory account.The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology (Ed. Alan Richardson, John Bowden, 1983), p 242 Habgood also states: > It is theologically more satisfactory to look for evidence of God's actions > within natural processes rather than apart from them, in much the same way > that the meaning of a book transcends, but is not independent of, the paper > and ink of which it is comprised. Both many theologians and scientists believe that it is a logical fallacy to base belief in God on gaps in scientific knowledge. In this vein, Richard Dawkins, an atheist, dedicates a chapter of his book The God Delusion to criticism of the God-of-the-gaps fallacy. Other scientists holding religious beliefs, such as Francis Collins, reject a God-of-the-gaps while embracing the idea of a God who fine tuned the universe precisely so human life could exist. ==See also== * Faith and rationality * Moving the goalposts * Non-overlapping magisteria * The Challenge of Creation * Watchmaker analogy ==References== ==Bibliography== * Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Letters and Papers from Prison, New York: Simon & Schuster, 1997 () \\"Letter to Eberhard Bethge\\", 29 May 1944, pages 310‚Äì312. * Richard H.

From its chambers, the executive and legislative branches perform the duties involved in governing the state. The Hawaii State Legislature‚Äîcomposed of the twenty-five member Hawaii State Senate led by the President of the Senate and the fifty-one member Hawaii State House of Representatives led by the Speaker of the House‚Äîconvenes in the building. Its principal tenants are the Governor of Hawaii and Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii, as well as all legislative offices and the Legislative Reference Bureau. Located in downtown Honolulu, the Hawaii State Capitol was commissioned and dedicated by John A. Burns, second Governor of Hawaii. It opened on March 15, 1969, replacing the former statehouse, the Iolani Palace. ==Monuments== Burns designed the restoration of the royal palace built by King David KalƒÅkaua and Queen Kapiolani; as part of that effort, the Queen Liliuokalani Statue in the Capitol Mall between the capitol building and Iolani Palace was dedicated on April 10, 1982. The site was once Haimoeipo, the royal residence of Queen Dowager Kalama and later King Lunalilo, who died there. Several other capitol building monuments decorate the statehouse grounds. The Beretania Street entrance features the Liberty Bell, a gift of the President of the United States and the United States Congress to the Territory of Hawaii in 1950 as a symbol of freedom and democracy. One of the more prominent monuments on the statehouse grounds is the Father Damien Statue‚Äîa tribute to the Roman Catholic priest who died in 1869 after sixteen years of serving patients afflicted with leprosy. Father Damien was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1995, and canonized on October 11, 2009, by Pope Benedict XVI. His feast Day is celebrated on May 10. In Hawai ªi, it is celebrated on the day of his death, April 15. The Eternal Flame on Beretania Street is a metal sculptured torch that burns endlessly as a tribute to all men and women from Hawaii who served with the Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Marines, and Navy in the major and minor conflicts in which the United States was engaged. Likewise, the Korean-Vietnam War Memorial pays tribute to service members who died in those conflicts. Dedicated on July 24, 1994 by Benjamin J. Cayetano, fifth Governor of Hawaii, the monument consists of 768 black marble pedestals engraved with the names of 312 service members of the Vietnam War. A larger marble slab bears a Hawaiian language inscription of remembrance. ==Architecture== The Hawaii State Capitol is on Beretania Street. Hawaii Capitol interior Statue of Father Damien outside the Hawaii State Capitol Building Reflecting pool The Hawaii State Capitol is an American adaptation of the Bauhaus style termed \\"Hawaiian international architecture\\". It was designed by a partnership between the firms of Belt, Lemon and Lo (Architects Hawaii Ltd.), and John Carl Warnecke and Associates. Unlike other state capitols modeled after the United States Capitol, the Hawaii State Capitol's distinct architectural features symbolize various natural aspects of Hawaii. Among them: * The building is surrounded by a reflecting pool, symbolizing the Pacific Ocean. * The two legislative chambers are cone-shaped, symbolizing volcanoes that formed the Hawaiian Islands. * The columns around the perimeter of the building have shapes resembling royal palm trees. There are eight columns in four rows at either side of the building, representing the eight main islands of Hawaii; sets of eight items appear in other places inside and along the outside of the building. * The Capitol is built with an open-air design, allowing sun, wind, and rain to enter; the central atrium opens to the sky and rainbows can sometimes be seen inside the building when it rains. * Four kukui nut trees (Hawaii's state tree) are a numerical reference to the four main counties in the State of Hawaii and the four major Hawaiian gods (Kukailimoku, Kane, Lono, and Kanaloa). Sets of four items appear in many other places in the building. * When standing in the center of the structure, the chandeliers from both legislative chambers, which represent the sun and moon, can be seen through the glass walls, while the area that is normally reserved for a rotunda in most capitol buildings is left open to the sky. It is said that the sky is Hawaii's capitol dome. * German-American artist Otto Piene designed the chandeliers, which are kinetic sculptures made of small objects. The Sun chandelier in the House is made of dozens of gold-plated globes, and the Moon chandelier in the Senate is made of 620 white chambered nautilus shells. ===Reflecting pool algae issue=== From the time the Capitol was completed in 1969, the reflecting pool has had a persistent algae growth problem, due partly to the fact the pool is fed with brackish water from on- site wells. Attempts by the state to fix the problem included introducing tilapia fish into the pool and installing an ozone treatment system. The state currently has the pool lining scrubbed manually with enzymes added to the water to combat growth. Some Capitol regulars say the algae growth has come to represent the pollution of the Pacific Ocean, in an ironic twist of the original symbolic meaning of the pool.

A child whose nurture and/or education cause them to have conflict between legitimate feelings, living in an illogical environment and interacting with adults who do not take the long- term interests of the child to heart will be more likely to form these secondary traits. In this manner the child blocks the unwanted emotional reaction that would have normally occurred. Although this may serve the child well while in that dysfunctional environment, it may also cause the child to react in inappropriate ways, by developing alternate ways in which the energy compulsively surfaces, ways damaging to his or her own interests, when interacting with people in a completely independent environment. Major trauma that occurs later in life, even in adulthood, can sometimes have a profound effect on character. See post-traumatic stress disorder. However, character may also develop in a positive way according to how the individual meets the psychosocial challenges of the life cycle (Erikson). == Theories  Freud === Freud's first paper on character described the anal character consisting of stubbornness, stinginess, and extreme neatness. He saw this as a reaction formation to the child's having to give up pleasure in anal eroticism. The positive version of this character is the conscientious, inner directed obsessive. Freud also described the erotic character as both loving and dependent. And the narcissistic character as the natural leader, aggressive and independent because of not internalizing a strong super-ego. === Fromm === For Erich Fromm character develops as the way in which an individual structures modes of assimilation and relatedness. The character types are almost identical to Freud's but Fromm gives them different names: receptive, hoarding, and exploitative. Fromm adds the marketing type to describe individuals who continually adapt the self to succeed in the new service economy. For Fromm, character types can be productive or unproductive. Fromm notes that character structures develop in each individual to enable him or her to interact successfully within a given society and adapt to its mode of production and social norms (see social character), and may be very counter- productive when used in a different society. Fromm got his ideas about character structure from two associates/students of Freud, S√°ndor Ferenczi and Wilhelm Reich. It is Reich who really developed the concept from Ferenczi, and added to it an exploration of character structure as it applies to body structure and development as well as mental life. === Reich === For Wilhelm Reich, character structures are based upon blocks‚Äîchronic, unconsciously held muscular contractions‚Äîagainst awareness of feelings. The blocks result from trauma: the child learns to limit their awareness of strong feelings as their needs are thwarted by parents who meet cries for fulfillment with neglect or punishment. Reich argued for five basic character structures, each with its own body type developed as a result of the particular blocks created due to deprivation or frustration of the child's stage-specific needs: # The schizoid structure, which could result in full blown schizophrenia: this is the result of not feeling wanted by hostile parents, even in the womb. There is a fragmentation of both body and mind with this structure. # The oral structure is an adaptation to an early wound of deprivation around the basic need for nourishment from birth to approx. 18 months. The oral structure as an adult will sometimes adopt an attitude of \\"you do it for me,\\" as a reaction to not having been nurtured when young. At other times the defense is one of compensation where the individual denies their own needs in the belief that needing will result in abandonment. The person loses touch with their healthy natural assertion and aggression and energy tends to collapse and be difficult to sustain. The body adopts a posture where shoulders are usually hunched which contracts the chest and limits breath and therefore the amount of energy the body takes in. The head juts forward, This posture limits energy flow to the arms which then feel weak. The body of the oral structure defends against receiving and thus confirms the belief that they cannot get their needs met, which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy unless the defense can be challenged in both mind and body and the individual can mobilize their energy, stand on their own two feet and own the right to need and to receive. # The psychopath or upwardly displaced structure: this wound, around the age of 3, is around the parent manipulating, emotionally molesting the child by seducing them into feeling \\"special\\" for the parent's own narcissistic needs. The child resolves to never again permit themselves to be vulnerable, and so decides to instead manipulate and overpower others with their will. The body is well developed above, weak below, as the psychopath pulls away from the ground and attempts to overpower from above. This structure has variations, depending on the admixture with prior wounds: the overbearing is the pure type, the submissive is mixed with oral, the withdrawing, with schizoid. # The masochist structure: this wound occurs when the parent refuses to allow the child to say \\"no,\\" the first step in setting boundaries. The child seeks relief from the rage that builds up underneath bounded muscle and fat, by provoking punishment from others. # The rigid: this wound occurs around the time of the first puberty, the age of 4. The child's sexuality is not affirmed by the parent, but instead shamed or denied. This structure seeks to prove to the parents and others that the child is worthy of love. The rigid structure is often beautifully harmonious, but there is a physical split around the diaphragm between heart and pelvis: love and sex. This person has trouble with being aware of their emotions, which are strong, yet buried. The rigid structure has many substructures, depending on the exact nature of the wound, the admixture with other pre-rigid (oedipal) structures, and the gender: in women, the masculine aggressive, hysterical, and the alternating; in men, the phallic narcissist, the compulsive, and the passive feminine. While each of these structures has blocks, and these blocks to some degree resemble \\"armour\\", it is only the rigid structure that truly has what Reich called \\"character armour\\": a system of blocks all over the body. Depending on which version of rigid one is, the rigid character possesses either 'plate' (i.e. clanky) or 'mesh' (much more flexible) character armour. == See also == * Temperament and Character Inventory ==References== * Alexander Lowen, The Language of the Body * Wilhelm Reich, Character Analysis == External links == * https://web.archive.org/web/20040401170949/http://www.duq.edu/facultyhome/burston/legacy.html Category:Personality traits ","title":"Character structure"},{"id":"523252","text":"The Pertuis d'Antioche (, Passage of Antioch) is a strait on the Atlantic coast of Western France, between two islands, √éle de R√© and √éle d'Ol√©ron, on the one side, and on the other side the continental coast between the cities of La Rochelle and the naval arsenal of Rochefort. The link with Antioch is tenuous: the Pertuis is a north-eastern corner of coastline, as is the coast between Cyprus, Syria and Turkey around the ancient city. ==History== The Pertuis d'Antioche was already active during Roman times, when it saw trade in salt and wine centred on Saintes. Much later, the military rivalry between England and France resulted in the Pertuis being the site of frequent naval engagements. In the middle-ages, the area sought its independence from the English crown under Richard the Lionheart. Louis XIV made the city of Rochefort one of the great naval bases of his kingdom. He then had fortresses constructed to protect the Rochefort roads. During the Napoleonic wars, the French further fortified the area, most notably with the construction of Fort Boyard. After his defeat at Waterloo, Napoleon tried to flee to the United States of America from the Pertuis d'Antioche, but eventually surrendered to the English navy, which was blockading the area; he was later sent into exile on the island of Saint Helena. Lastly, during World War II, the Germans occupied the coast and fortified it against invasion. They also built a large submarine base in La Rochelle; this still stands today, and was used as a set for the historical submarine movie Das Boot. Even after the Allied invasion of France, La Rochelle remained a pocket of German resistance that surrendered only at the end of the war. ==Geography== The Pertuis d'Antioche is bordered by a limestone coast dating back to the Cretaceous, at which time it was deep under water. The weather is oceanic. Although at the same latitude as Montreal, Canada and the Kuril islands, Russia, the area is quite warm throughout the year, due to the influence of the Gulf Stream waters, and the number of sunny days per year, which is remarkably high, on a par with the French Riviera on the Mediterranean coast of France. With its warm, protected waters, the Pertuis d'Antioche has become one of the most active tourist and pleasure-boat centres in Europe, with the La Rochelle marina complex at its centre. ==Gallery== == Further reading == * An early modern pilotage handbook for what was at the time an enemy coast.

Bennett was a successful businessman and one of the colony's richest residents with interests in the fisheries, distillery and brewery industry and shipbuilding. His brother Thomas Bennett, a magistrate and member of Newfoundland's first House of Assembly, was a partner in the business. Bennett became involved in politics in the 1840s as a leader of the colony's Anglican community and an opponent of responsible government, an argument he lost when an alliance of Catholics and non-Anglican Protestants persuaded the Colonial Office to grant Newfoundland self-government. In the 1860s, he led the Anti-Confederation Party opposing the proposals by Sir Frederick Carter to join Canada. Bennett's party defeated Carter's Conservatives on the Confederation issue in the 1869 elections, allowing Bennett to form a government in 1870. However, as Premier he was unable to keep his party united, and in 1874 resigned, allowing Carter to return to power. The issue of Confederation had become a moot point and would not be seriously raised again until the Great Depression.

The book expresses details of the history of American expansionism from a point of view that is critical of its effects on the Native Americans. Brown describes Native Americans' displacement through forced relocations and years of warfare waged by the United States federal government. The government's dealings are portrayed as a continuing effort to destroy the culture, religion, and way of life of Native American peoples. Helen Hunt Jackson's 1881 book A Century of Dishonor is often considered a nineteenth-century precursor to Dee Brown's writing. Before the publication of Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, Dee Brown had become well versed in the history of the American frontier. Having grown up in Arkansas, he developed a keen interest in the American West, and during his graduate education at George Washington University and his career as a librarian for both the US Department of Agriculture and the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, he wrote numerous books on the subject. (Interview conducted in Fall 1994.) Brown's works maintained a focus on the American West, but ranged anywhere from western fiction to histories to even children's books. Many of Brown's books revolved around similar Native American topics, including his Showdown at Little Bighorn (1964) and The Fetterman Massacre (1974). Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee was first published in 1970 to generally strong reviews. Published at a time of increasing American Indian activism, the book has never gone out of print and has been translated into 17 languages. The title is taken from the final phrase of a twentieth-century poem titled \\"American Names\\" by Stephen Vincent Benet. The full quotation ‚Äì \\"I shall not be there. I shall rise and pass. Bury my heart at Wounded Knee.\\" ‚Äì appears at the beginning of Brown's book. Although Benet's poem is not about the plight of Native Americans, Wounded Knee was the location of the last major confrontation between the US Army and Native Americans. It is also the vicinity of where Crazy Horse's parents buried his heart and some of his bones after his murder in 1877. ==Synopsis== In the first chapter, Brown presents a brief history of the discovery and settlement of America, from 1492 to the Indian turmoil that began in 1860. He stresses the initially gentle and peaceable behavior of Indians toward Europeans, especially given their apparent lack of resistance to early colonial efforts at Europeanization. It was not until the further influx of European settlers, gradual encroachment, and eventual seizure of American lands by the \\"white man\\" that the Native people were shown to exhibit forms of major resistance. Brown completes his initial overview by briefly describing incidents up to 1860 that involve American encroachment and Indian removal, beginning with the defeat of the Wampanoags and Narragansetts, Iroquois, and Cherokee Nations, as well as the establishment of the West as the \\"permanent Indian frontier\\" and the ultimate breaches of the frontier as a means to achieve Manifest Destiny. In each of the following chapters, Brown provides an in-depth description of a significant post-1860 event in American Western expansion or Native American eradication, focusing in turn on the specific tribe or tribes involved in the event. In his narrative, Brown primarily discusses such tribes as the Navajo Nation, Santee Dakota, Hunkpapa Lakota, Oglala Lakota, Cheyenne, and Apache people. He touches more lightly upon the subjects of the Arapaho, Modoc, Kiowa, Comanche, Nez Perce, Ponca, Ute, and Minneconjou Lakota tribes. ===Navajo=== Brown discusses the plights of Manuelito and the Navajo people in New Mexico, who make treaties and other efforts to maintain peace with Euro- Americans despite their encroachment upon Navajo land, stealing livestock and burning entire villages as punishment for perceived misbehavior. The second, third and fourth generation European immigrants occupy land in Navajo country not only to build their own forts, the first of which was Fort Defiance, but also claim rights to the surrounding prized Navajo lands as pasture for their livestock. Various disputes occur between the Navajo and the Euro-Americans, culminating in a horse race between Manuelito and a US Army lieutenant who wins as a result of dishonesty and trickery. The consequence is a massacre of Navajo bystanders. The US Army General James Carleton orders the Navajos to relocate to a reservation at Bosque Redondo, where the Apaches had recently been moved, but is met with resistance. Employing a scorched-earth campaign, Kit Carson and Carleton force a large majority of resistant Navajos and Apaches to surrender and flee to the reservation. Manuelito and a few other Navajo leaders refuse to surrender but finally agree to relocate to the Bosque in 1866 \\"for the sake of the women and children\\", signing a peace treaty on June 1, 1868. ===Sioux=== Santee Dakota The narrative of the Sioux begins with Brown's discussion of the Santee Dakota tribe. Following a poor harvest and lack of promised support from the US government in the early 1860s, members of the tribe became angry at white people. After the murder of several white men and women by young Dakota, the frustrated Santee tribe, led by Chief Little Crow, attacked Fort Ridgely and a nearby town. When the Santees refuse to surrender their white hostages to Colonel Sibley, they are forced into battle again at Yellow Medicine River. The Santees lose and over three dozen Santee warriors are executed in December 1862. Santee chiefs, including Chief Little Crow, were killed during the following six months, and the remaining Santees are removed to a Missouri River and Crow Creek reservation. Oglala Lakota Brown's discussion of the Oglala Lakota begins with the US Army's 1865 invasion of the Powder River country in Montana. The army is confronted with opposition from the local Lakota and Cheyenne tribes. This and other skirmishes result in heated conflict between the US Army and the Oglala Lakotas led by Chiefs Red Cloud and Roman Nose, forcing the US Army to retreat for the winter. The high death toll among US troops fostered great confidence in the Native Americans who began a journey to the Black Hills. By the US Army's request, the Sioux chiefs and approximately 2000 other warriors arrived at Fort Laramie in May 1866 for treaty talks. The tribes quickly learned of the army's intent to build roads and railroads through Sioux land. As construction progresses, the Sioux plan an attack on the white men and harass white traffic through the Powder River country. Red Cloud unknowingly leads approximately 3,000 Lakota into an ambush, later called the Fetterman Massacre, at Peno Creek where 81 white men and 200 Lakotas are killed. Conflict continues between the US Army and the Lakota for years despite peace commissioners being sent to Powder River to address differences. In 1868 the US Army retreats upon the signing of the peace treaty with Red Cloud. In 1869 Red Cloud is invited to Washington D.C. to speak with Donehogawa, a member of the Iroquois tribe who is serving as the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in the US government. Chief Red Cloud and his tribe members express their discontent with the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie which defined their reservation land as bordered by the Missouri River rather than the Powder River. Commissioner Donehogawa corrected this mistake by declaring the Powder River country as reserved for Lakota hunting grounds. Donehogawa's agency was later accused of being like a \\"savage Indian\\" and the agency was unable to purchase supplies for the reservations. Donehogawa was subsequently forced to resign his commission. In 1874, when rumors of gold in the Black Hills were delivered by Custer and his men to the white settlers on the plains, miners and panhandlers flooded the Black Hills, angering the Lakota and Dakota living there. A peace council in 1875 tried to arrange for the US government to either purchase the mineral rights or outright ownership of the Black Hills, but both proposals were rejected by the Sioux. In 1876, a series of battles occur between the Sioux and US troops which initially ends when the Sioux defeat General Custer and his troops at the Battle of Little Bighorn on June 25. The humiliated US Army sends a peace council to sign a treaty that forces the Sioux out of the Black Hills to the Missouri River. The troops follow this treaty with numerous attacks on Lakota villages. Hunkpapa and Minneconjou Lakota Following the removal of the Lakota from the Black Hills to the Missouri River Reservation, Sitting Bull, in exile in Canada and participating in unsuccessful peace talks, returns to American soil and surrenders at Fort Buford. He is removed to the Hunkpapa reservation at Standing Rock; he subsequently joins Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. The Lakota were ultimately forced to sign a treaty in 1890 that further divided and limited their reservation. Sitting Bull is later arrested in an attempt by US authorities to suppress Sitting Bull's endorsement of the Ghost Dance which they considered a religious disturbance. The two Native American policemen sent to arrest Sitting Bull killed him. Following the death of Sitting Bull, a conflict arose that resulted in the Hunkpapas and Minneconjous tribes fleeing Standing Rock. Deciding against further resistance, the tribes join Red Cloud at Pine Ridge where they encounter Major Whitside in late December 1890. The tribes are subsequently directed to Wounded Knee, where a member of the Minneconjou tribe called Black Coyote refuses to surrender his rifle. The US Army reacts with violence which results in the deaths of 150‚Äì350 Native Americans and 25‚Äì31 US Army soldiers. The Lakota that survived the assault fled to Pine Ridge, and returned to Wounded Knee the next day only to bury their families and comrades. ===Cheyenne and Arapaho=== The 1858 Pikes Peak Gold Rush in Colorado creates a swarm of white settlers onto Cheyenne and Arapaho lands and instigates treaty talks that result in removal of Cheyenne and Arapaho territory to any area between Sand Creek and the Arkansas River. When the Civil War brings the US Army into Cheyenne and Arapaho territory, the resulting conflict endorses the murder of \\"hostile Indians\\". The Cheyenne tribe responds with numerous strikes on the army outposts. In early 1866, the Southern Cheyenne Dog Soldiers are asked to sign the treaty that would relocate them to the south with Black Kettle and his tribe. When they refuse, Roman Nose organizes an attack which is thwarted by the coming of winter. In the following year a peace council is held between the General Hancock's army and the Cheyenne which ends when Hancock's army burns the Cheyenne camp to force their cooperation. After a series of retaliatory assaults, a treaty is signed by the Cheyenne, Arapaho, Kiowa, and Comanche tribes which relocates them to the reservation south of Arkansas River. Roman Nose doesn't sign the treaty. Instead he leads his Dog Soldiers on more war parties and is eventually killed. Generals Custer and Sheridan burn Black Kettle's village and the remaining band of Dog Soldiers are killed. After the surrender and removal, the Northern Cheyenne tribe led by Little Wolf and Dull Knife are unable to sustain themselves on the poor land at Fort Reno, and they form a hunting party to hunt buffalo north of their reservation. Their hunt was unsuccessful, and the tribe continues to suffer severe losses due to health problems from malnutrition and a measles epidemic. Chiefs Little Wolf and Dull Knife decide to move north but this leads to more violent encounters with the US Army. The tribes are reduced to nearly 10% of their earlier population. Dull Knife and his tribe try to join Red Cloud, and they defy orders to return to their southern, buffalo-depleted reservation. Battles ensue, and Dull Knife's tribe is pursued north until the majority of the tribe are killed. The survivors take refuge at Red Cloud's reservation. ===Apache=== The friendly relations between the Apaches and Euro-Americans, that were once signified by the Apaches allowing white travelers to pass through their land unmolested, began to diminish when Apache Chief Cochise was imprisoned for allegedly stealing cattle and kidnapping a white boy from a settler's farm. When Cochise escaped, he and his warriors killed three white men, and the army responded by hanging male members of Cochise's family. Cochise spent the next two years leading attacks on the Euro-Americans. In 1865, after Cochise refuses a treaty designed to relocate his Chiricahua tribe to a reservation, the Apaches successfully avoid contact with white men for a number of years. But in 1871, a group of settlers, Mexicans, and warriors from competing tribes massacre an Apache village, and Cochise and his followers retreat into the mountains. They stay there until the chief agrees to move the Apache to a reservation in the Chiricahua Mountains in Arizona. He dies soon thereafter in 1874. The Apache nation was divided after Cochise's death, and they soon become infamous for raiding white villages. The Chiricahua Apaches, avoiding attempts to relocate to a reservation, flee into Mexico. Victorio and his Warm Springs Apaches are removed to the San Carlos agency in southeastern Arizona in 1877. The entire tribe is eventually killed, to stop their raids on white settlers. Geronimo and his tribe leave their reservation only to return heavily armed and determined to free their fellow Apaches. This results in the stationing of Apache guerillas in Mexico. Negotiations with Geronimo and the guerillas continue over the next few years as alleged stories of the guerillas‚Äô brutalities and atrocities circulate. In 1886, Geronimo flees once again before being incarcerated and transported to a reservation in Florida with the remaining Chiricahua Apaches. ===Modoc=== Captain Jack, the Chief of the Modoc tribe located in Northern California, is described as a Native American friendly to the \\"white people\\" who settled in his country. As larger numbers of settlers trespass onto Modoc land and small disputes arise between the Modocs and white settlers, the US government coerces a treaty, over Captain Jack's reluctance, that will relocate the Modocs to a reservation in Oregon and shared with the Klamaths. Conflicts between the two tribes quickly begin, and the Modocs return south to California. Their return is halted by a skirmish between the tribe and an army battalion in 1872, and the Modocs divert to the California lava beds. Another group of Modocs, led by Hooker Jim, murdered 12 white settlers and forced Captain Jack to lead his tribe into a battle against the US Army. A peace commission led by General Canby, conducts peace talks with Captain Jack who eventually, under pressure from Hooker Jim's Modocs, agrees to kill Canby should the original Modoc land not be returned to the tribe. As feared, Canby refuses to return the land to the Modocs, and he is killed by Captain Jack. Hooker Jim betrays Captain Jack to the army, and he is hanged on October 3, 1873. ===Kiowa and Comanche=== After the Battle of Washita in 1868, General Sheridan ordered all tribes involved to surrender at Fort Cobb; the Kiowa tribe refused. The Kiowa chiefs are arrested and both the Kiowa and Comanche people are forced onto the Fort Cobb reservation. The Kiowas and Comanches, led by Satanta and Big Tree, decide to attack the white men, and they kill 7 teamsters. This results in the arrest and imprisonment of both chiefs. Lone Wolf, another Kiowa Chief, arranges for the release of White Bear and Big Tree so they can attend the peace talks at Fort Sill. In early 1874, while on parole, White Bear and Big Tree lead the Kiowa and Comanche tribes on an attack against white settlers in order to preserve the buffalo. When both tribes flee their reservations, they are hunted down by the US Army. Upon their surrender in early 1875, they are exiled in Florida. ===Nez Perc√©=== Despite maintaining peaceful relations with whites, the Nez Perces are forced to sign a treaty in 1863 which removes them to a small reservation in Idaho. Chief Joseph and his tribe designated this agreement as the \\"thief treaty\\". Being highly offended by the treaty terms, and the sudden influx of gold miners and cattle farmers onto Nez Perce land, the tribe refused to move to the Lapwai Reservation, choosing instead to fight the US Army at White Bird Canyon in June 1877. After winning that battle, the tribe fled to Montana, trying to join Sitting Bull in Canada, but then they lost the battle at the Bear Paw Mountains in August and were forced to surrender. Some members of the tribe managed to find refuge in Canada, but those that surrendered were split between the Lapwai reservation and the Colville reservation in Washington. ===Ponca=== Despite having previously signed treaties guaranteeing their ownership of the land on the Niobrara River, the Ponca land was taken from via a subsequent US treaty and given to the Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota tribes just before they were added to a list of tribes to be exiled to Indian Territory following Custer's defeat. Ponca Chief Standing Bear was arrested along with other chiefs for refusing to leave voluntarily. The Ponca tribe was forced onto the Quapaw reservation, where over one quarter of their population died. Standing Bear returned to the Niobrara and takes his case to a white man's court in 1879 arguing that he is a person protected by the US Constitution. Standing Bear won his case but is informed by General Sherman that the case is specific to him and does not maintain validity for the other Poncas, who were forced to remain in Indian Territory. ===Utes=== The Utes are a Colorado tribe whose land was gradually overrun by mineral and gold miners. Chief Ouray signed a treaty in 1863 allowing settlers to mine Ute land and relinquishing all mineral rights. He signed another treaty in 1868 that allotted 16 million acres of forests and meadows in the Rockies as a personal reservation that prohibited white trespass. When disputes arose, Nathan Meeker attempted to assimilate the Utes into Euro-American culture, but William Vickers opposed the idea and started \\"The Utes Must Go!\\" campaign in 1879. Vickers called on the US cavalry to prevent an uprising by the Utes. The Utes responded by killing all the white men at the White River Indian agency. In 1881, as a result of outrage over the White River Massacre, the Utes were removed to a marginal reservation in Utah. ==Key charactersNative Americans=== * Manuelito * Little Crow * Roman Nose * William and George Bent * Black Kettle * Red Cloud * Tall Bull * Donehogawa * Cochise * Mangas Colorado * Eskiminzin * Captain Jack * Hooker Jim * Satanta * Kicking Bird * Lone Wolf * Sitting Bull * Crazy Horse * Chief (Young) Joseph * Dull Knife * Little Wolf * Standing Bear * Chief Ouray * Geronimo * Victorio * Kicking Bear * Big Foot * Black Coyote ===European- Americans=== * Andrew Jackson * Colonel Edward Canby * General James Carleton * Kit Carson * Colonel Henry Sibley * Colonel John Chivington * General Patrick Connor * Colonel Henry Carrington * General William Sherman * General Winfield Scott Hancock * General Philip Sheridan * General George Custer * Jacob Cox * General George Crook * Colonel Nelson Miles * Carl Schurz * Nathan Meeker * Buffalo Bill Cody ==Historical contextAmerican Indian Movement=== Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee was published less than three years following the establishment of AIM, the American Indian Movement, formed in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1968. AIM moved to promote modern Native American issues and to unite America's dividing Native American population, similar to the Civil Rights and Environmental Movements that gained support at that time. The publication of Brown's book came at the height of the American Indian Movement's activism. In 1969, AIM occupied Alcatraz Island for 19 months in hopes of reclaiming Native American land after the San Francisco Indian Center burned down. In 1973, less than three years after the book's release, AIM and local Oglala and neighboring Sicangu Lakota took part in a 71-day occupation at Wounded Knee in protest of the government of Richard Wilson, the chairman of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, which resulted in the death of two Indians and injury of the US Marshal. The resulting 1974 trial ended in the dismissal of all charges due to the uncovering of various incidents of government misconduct. ===Vietnam War=== At the time of the publication of Brown's book, the United States was engaged in the Vietnam War. The actions of the United States Army in Vietnam were frequently criticized in the media and critics of Brown's narrative often drew comparisons between its contents and what was seen in the media. The primary comparison made was the similarity between the massacre and atrocities against Native Americans in the late nineteenth century as portrayed by Dee Brown's book and the 1968 massacre of hundreds of civilians in Southern Vietnam at My Lai for which twenty-five US Army members were indicted. Native American author N. Scott Momaday, in his review of the narrative, agreed with the viability of the comparison, stating \\"Having read Mr. Brown, one has a better understanding of what it is that nags at the American conscience at times (to our everlasting credit) and of that morality which informs and fuses events so far apart in time and space as the massacres at Wounded Knee and My Lai.\\" Thirty years later, in the foreword of a modern printing of the book by Hampton Sides, it is argued that My Lai had a powerful impact on the success of Brown's narrative, as \\"Bury My Heart landed on America's doorstep in the anguished midst of the Vietnam War, shortly after revelations of the My Lai massacre had plunged the nation into gnawing self- doubt. Here was a book filled with a hundred My Lais, a book that explored the dark roots of American arrogance while dealing a near-deathblow to our fondest folk myth.\\" ==Reception== Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee received ultimately positive reviews upon its publication. TIME magazine reviewed the book: > \\"In the last decade or so, after almost a century of saloon art and horse > operas that romanticized Indian fighters and white settlers, Americans have > been developing a reasonably acute sense of the injustices and humiliations > suffered by the Indians. But the details of how the West was won are not > really part of the American consciousness.... Dee Brown, Western historian > and head librarian at the University of Illinois, now attempts to balance > the account. With the zeal of an IRS investigator, he audits US history's > forgotten set of books. Compiled from old but rarely exploited sources plus > a fresh look at dusty Government documents, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee > tallies the broken promises and treaties, the provocations, massacres, > discriminatory policies and condescending diplomacy.\\" The Native American author N. Scott Momaday, who won the Pulitzer Prize, noted that the book contains strong documentation of original sources, such as council records and first-hand descriptions. He stated that \\"it is, in fact, extraordinary on several accounts\\" and further complimented Brown's writing by saying that \\"the book is a story, whole narrative of singular integrity and precise continuity; that is what makes the book so hard to put aside, even when one has come to the end.\\" Peter Farb reviewed the book in 1971 in the New York Review of Books: \\"The Indian wars were shown to be the dirty murders they were.\\" Other critics could not believe that the book was not written by a Native American and that Dee Brown was a white man, as the book's Native perspective felt so real. Remaining on bestseller lists for over a year following its release in hardback, the book remains in print 40 years later. Translated into at least 17 languages, it has sold nearly four million copies and remains popular today. Despite the book's widespread acceptance by journalists and the general public, scholars such as Francis Paul Prucha criticized it for lacking sources for much of the material, except for direct quotations. He also said that content was selected to present a particular point of view, rather than to be balanced, and that the narrative of government-Indian relations suffered from not being placed within the perspective of what else occurred in the government and the country at the time. Brown was candid about his intention to present the history of the settlement of the West from the point of view of the Indians ‚Äî \\"its victims,\\" as he wrote. He noted, \\"Americans who have always looked westward when reading about this period should read this book facing eastward.\\" ==AdaptationsFilm=== HBO Films produced a made-for-television film adaptation by the same title of the Brown's book for the HBO television network. The film stars Adam Beach, Aidan Quinn, Anna Paquin, and August Schellenberg with a cameo appearance by late actor and former US Senator Fred Thompson as President Grant. It debuted on the HBO television network Sunday, May 27, 2007 and covers roughly the last two chapters of Brown's book, focusing on the narrative of the Lakota tribes leading up to the death of Sitting Bull and the Massacre at Wounded Knee.Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, directed by Yves Simoneau (2007; Calgary, Alberta, Canada: HBO Films, 2007), DVD. The film received 17 Primetime Emmy nominations and went on to win six awards, including the category of Outstanding Made For Television Movie. It also garnered nominations for three Golden Globe Awards, two Satellite Awards, and one Screen Actors Guild Award. ===Children's literature=== Bestselling author of Lincoln's Last Days, Dwight Jon Zimmerman adapted Brown's book for children in his work entitled The Saga of the Sioux. The narrative deals solely with the Sioux tribe as the representatives of the story told in Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, written from the perspective of the Sioux chiefs and warriors from 1860 to the events at the Massacre at Wounded Knee. The book includes copious photographs, illustrations, and maps in support of the narrative and to appeal to its middle school demographic. ==See also== * Native Americans in the United States * Wounded Knee Massacre * American Indian Wars * Manifest Destiny ==References== ==External links== * Publisher 'Sterling Publishing' webpage: Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee Category:1970 non-fiction books Category:History books about the American Old West Category:Non-fiction books about Native Americans Category:Books about indigenous rights Category:Books adapted into films ","title":"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"},{"id":"523281","text":"The University of Southern Queensland (USQ) is a medium-sized, regional university based in Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia, with three university campuses at Toowoomba, Springfield and Ipswich. It offers courses in law, health, engineering, the sciences, business, education, and the arts. The institution was established in 1969 as the Darling Downs campus of the Queensland Institute of Technology. In 1970, the institution had provided studying programs for rural Queensland and international communities. In 1971, it became the Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education, then the University College of Southern Queensland in 1990 and finally the University of Southern Queensland in 1992. It operates three research institutes and seven research centres which focus on a wide range of business, agricultural, scientific, environmental, and technological issues. The University is recognised for having the largest Japanese-designed garden in Australia, Australia's largest solar integrated carpark, and a library with rainforest and water features. In 2017, the University won the international Green Gown award for its approach to sustainability focusing on renewable energy, waste reduction, water retention, and integration of sustainability into strategic planning. In 2012, the University's archaeologists discovered the oldest Australian rock art of 28,000 years old in the Northern Territory, and in 2018, the University's astronomers discovered a new planet that orbits an ancient star almost 2 billion years older than the sun. The University is recognised for its efforts in preventing violence against women and cited as employer of choice for gender equality by the Federal Government's Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA). ==History Dellys Kelly === At the age of 26, Dellys Kelly was working as a manager at East Greenmount. In 1958, with a bought map, she drove to Canberra to start her campaign for a new university in Toowoomba. After driving to the Parliament House and asking to meet with Prime Minister Robert Menzies, she was challenged by him to raise ¬£30,000 before he would discuss the issue. She received strong support from the community, and after eleven weeks, the money was raised. In 1960, the Darling Downs University Establishment Association was founded. === Overview === Queensland Institute of Technology (Darling Downs) opened on 2 February 1967 in Toowoomba. It had 140 foundation students. In 1971, the institute became the Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education (DDIAE). Managed by its own College Council, DDIAE educated 75% of the country's international students in the 1986-1987 school year. From 1980 to 1990, DDIAE grew significantly from 1,000 to 8,000 full-time student equivalents (EFTSL). It became the University College of Southern Queensland (UCSQ) in 1990, under the sponsorship of the University of Queensland. In 1992, the institution became the University of Southern Queensland (USQ) when it gained full university status. USQ was a founding member of the Regional Universities Network that was launched in 2011. The Network's research in 2013 showed that USQ generated $411.7 million into the economy of Queensland every year as well as household income of $255.4 million and 3,313 jobs in the communities of Toowoomba, Fraser Coast, and Springfield. Along with Toowoomba's investments in data centers, landscaped and business parks, air and land infrastructures, USQ has been contributing an important part in making the region a centre of agribusiness, sustainable development, and trade. === Milestones === * 2004, 8 July: Groundbreaking was held at Springfield campus. * 2006, 11 August: Springfield campus was officially opened by Minister for Education and Science Julie Bishop. * 2007, Semester 1: The first students started their studies at Springfield campus. * 2014, 5 March: Health & Recreation Club worth of $1.2 million and Engineering Laboratory were opened at Springfield campus. * 2015, 7 January: Ipswich campus was formally transferred to USQ. * 2015, 10 August: Clinical simulation labs worth of $1.7 million were opened at Ipswich campus. * 2015, 26 August: Building B (Awarded 6 Star Green Star by Green Building Council of Australia) worth of $45 million was opened at Springfield campus. * 2016, Semester 1: Bachelor of Aviation was launched at Springfield campus and Bachelor of Midwifery was launched at Ipswich campus. * 2016, 20 June: Psychology and Counselling Clinic was opened at Ipswich campus. * 2017, 1 March: Midwifery Simulation Centre and Paramedic Simulation House were opened at Ipswich campus. * 2017, 27 October: Boeing 737 flight simulator worth of $1 million went into operation at Springfield campus. * 2017, Semester 2: The first students of Bachelor of Paramedicine were farewelled at Ipswich campus. ==Campuses== Toowoomba campus USQ ensures that, as a regional university, its curriculum serves local and regional employment needs, it engages in regional social and economic development, and serves the regional community.

Based on competitive grants won and industry funded research collaborations, USQ has significant and core research strength in the broad area of agriculture and the environment. This core research strength generated over $10 million in new grant and industry funding, announced by vice- chancellor Bill Lovegrove in 2008.Jim Campbell 16 December 2008, The Morning Bulletin, In 2003, the university established the Institute for Agriculture and the Environment (IAgE) with improved biotechnology and pathology laboratories. In 2017, the Queensland Drought Mitigation Centre (QDMC) was established as a result of collaboration between the university and the government. In 2017, as a part of the mega $15m campus expansion, the university started upgrading the Agricultural Science and Engineering Precinct (ASEP) to facilitate agricultural and material engineering development, including constructing new microbiology laboratories, glasshouses, dehumidified storage, and controlled ecological environments, developing methods of soil pathogen resistance, and applying vision sensing and robotics trials. In 2017, the university hosted Australia's first regional meeting with Australia-ASEAN Council (AAC) in Toowoomba Campus to discuss the issue of trade and agriculture in preparation for the Sydney ASEAN-Australia Special Summit in 2018. The participants addressed the global demand for food, the current problems in the industry, and the development of new technologies in environmental science, engineering, and agribusiness. In 2018, a new climate project of $8 million was established by the University, the Queensland government, and the MLA, bringing together world scientists to find better solutions for managing drought and predicting seasonal climates. USQ researchers undertake different roles with international climate organisations, such as the President of the United Nations‚Äô World Meteorological Organization (with the commission to design better services for global agribusiness and climate risk management) and ocean expeditor in the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (with the mission to examine how ocean currents affect the world's weather). USQ also supports the usage of renewable energy by integrating 2MW solar power system with the carpark in Toowoomba campus to provide energy to the campus's activities, reducing the emission of carbon dioxide by 20 percent. In addition, USQ has developed projects in the fields of construction industry and space research.

It stretches approximately north to south and east to west. It is the world's highest and largest plateau, with an area of (about five times the size of Metropolitan France). With an average elevation exceeding and being surrounded by imposing mountain ranges that harbor the world's two highest summits, Mount Everest and K2, the Tibetan Plateau is often referred to as \\"the Roof of the World\\". The Tibetan Plateau contains the headwaters of the drainage basins of most of the streams in surrounding regions. Its tens of thousands of glaciers and other geographical and ecological features serve as a \\"water tower\\" storing water and maintaining flow. It is sometimes termed the Third Pole given its ice fields contain the largest reserve of fresh water outside the polar regions. The impact of global warming on the Tibetan Plateau is of intense scientific interest. == Description == The Tibetan Plateau is surrounded by the massive mountain ranges of high-mountain Asia. The plateau is bordered to the south by the inner Himalayan range, to the north by the Kunlun Mountains, which separate it from the Tarim Basin, and to the northeast by the Qilian Mountains, which separate the plateau from the Hexi Corridor and Gobi Desert. To the east and southeast the plateau gives way to the forested gorge and ridge geography of the mountainous headwaters of the Salween, Mekong, and Yangtze rivers in northwest Yunnan and western Sichuan (the Hengduan Mountains). In the west the curve of the rugged Karakoram range of northern Kashmir embraces the plateau. The Indus River originates in the western Tibetan Plateau in the vicinity of Lake Manasarovar. Tibetan Buddhist stupa and houses outside the town of Ngawa, on the Tibetan Plateau. The Tibetan Plateau is bounded in the north by a broad escarpment where the altitude drops from around to over a horizontal distance of less than . Along the escarpment is a range of mountains. In the west, the Kunlun Mountains separate the plateau from the Tarim Basin. About halfway across the Tarim the bounding range becomes the Altyn-Tagh and the Kunluns, by convention, continue somewhat to the south. In the 'V' formed by this split is the western part of the Qaidam Basin. The Altyn-Tagh ends near the Dangjin pass on the Dunhuang‚ÄìGolmud road. To the west are short ranges called the Danghe, Yema, Shule, and Tulai Nanshans. The easternmost range is the Qilian Mountains. The line of mountains continues east of the plateau as the Qinling, which separates the Ordos Plateau from Sichuan. North of the mountains runs the Gansu or Hexi Corridor which was the main silk-road route from China proper to the West. The plateau is a high-altitude arid steppe interspersed with mountain ranges and large brackish lakes. Annual precipitation ranges from and falls mainly as hail. The southern and eastern edges of the steppe have grasslands that can sustainably support populations of nomadic herdsmen, although frost occurs for six months of the year. Permafrost occurs over extensive parts of the plateau. Proceeding to the north and northwest, the plateau becomes progressively higher, colder, and drier, until reaching the remote Changtang region in the northwestern part of the plateau. Here the average altitude exceeds and winter temperatures can drop to . As a result of this extremely inhospitable environment, the Changthang region (together with the adjoining Kekexili region) is the least populous region in Asia and the third least populous area in the world after Antarctica and northern Greenland.

Brahmaputra River is in the lower right. == Geology and geological history == Yamdrok Lake is one of the three largest sacred lakes in Tibet. The geological history of the Tibetan Plateau is closely related to that of the Himalayas. The Himalayas belong to the Alpine Orogeny and are therefore among the younger mountain ranges on the planet, consisting mostly of uplifted sedimentary and metamorphic rock. Their formation is a result of a continental collision or orogeny along the convergent boundary between the Indo-Australian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The collision began in the Upper Cretaceous period about 70 million years ago, when the north-moving Indo- Australian Plate, moving at about per year, collided with the Eurasian Plate. About 50 million years ago, this fast-moving Indo-Australian plate had completely closed the Tethys Ocean, the existence of which has been determined by sedimentary rocks settled on the ocean floor, and the volcanoes that fringed its edges. Since these sediments were light, they crumpled into mountain ranges rather than sinking to the floor. The Indo-Australian plate continues to be driven horizontally below the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to move upwards; the plateau is still rising at a rate of approximately per year. Much of the Tibetan Plateau is of relatively low relief. The cause of this is debated among geologists. Some argue that the Tibetan Plateau is an uplifted peneplain formed at low altitude, while others argue that the low relief stems from erosion and infill of topographic depressions that occurred at already high elevations. ==Environment== Typical landscape The Tibetan Plateau supports a variety of ecosystems, most of them classified as montane grasslands. While parts of the plateau feature an alpine tundra-like environment, other areas feature monsoon-influenced shrublands and forests. Species diversity is generally reduced on the plateau due to the elevation and low precipitation. The Tibetan Plateau hosts the Tibetan wolf, and species of snow leopard, wild yak, wild donkey, cranes, vultures, hawks, geese, snakes, and water buffalo. One notable animal is the high-altitude jumping spider, that can live at elevations of over . Ecoregions found on the Tibetan Plateau, as defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature, are as follows: * The Pamir alpine desert and tundra covers the western end of the Tibetan Plateau where it transitions to the Pamir Mountains * The North Tibetan Plateau-Kunlun Mountains alpine desert covers the northwestern limits of the Tibetan Plateau along the Kunlun Mountains * The Karakoram-West Tibetan Plateau alpine steppe covers the westernmost parts of the Tibetan Plateau and Ladakh * The Northwestern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows on the edges mountains bordering the extreme west of the Tibetan Plateau * The Central Tibetan Plateau alpine steppe covers most of the central portions of the Tibetan Plateau and the eastern Changtang * The Western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows covers the southwestern plateau in the Garuda Valley region * The Qaidam Basin semi-desert located in the Qaidam Basin on the northern Tibetan Plateau * The Qilian Mountains subalpine meadows covering the Qilian Mountains in the northernmost portions of the plateau * The Qilian Mountains conifer forests covering parts of the mountain ranges in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau * The Tibetan Plateau alpine shrub and meadows covering a swath of the central and northeastern Tibetan Plateau * The Yarlung Tsangpo arid steppe in the Yarlung Tsangpo River Valley, where most of the permanent human population on the Tibetan Plateau lives * The Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows cover the southern Tibetan Plateau on the north side of the Himalayas * The Southeast Tibet shrub and meadows cover the southeastern and eastern parts of the plateau and are generally rainier than the other high-altitude Tibetan Plateau regions * The Northeastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests reach up mountain valleys in the southern plateau and contain some of the highest altitude forests in the world * The Nujiang Langcang Gorge alpine conifer and mixed forests cover the mountain valleys that reach into the southeastern Tibetan Plateau * The Hengduan Mountains subalpine conifer forests cover the southeasternmost mountain valleys on the plateau * The Qionglai-Minshan conifer forests cover the eastern edges of the plateau and are the densest forests to be found anywhere on the Tibetan Plateau == Human history == Pastoral nomads camping near Namtso. Nomads on the Tibetan Plateau and in the Himalayas are the remainders of nomadic practices historically once widespread in Asia and Africa. Pastoral nomads constitute about 40% of the ethnic Tibetan population.In pictures: Tibetan nomads BBC News The presence of nomadic peoples on the plateau is predicated on their adaptation to survival on the world's grassland by raising livestock rather than crops, which are unsuitable to the terrain. Archaeological evidence suggests that the colonization leading to the full-time occupation of the plateau occurred much later than the previously thought 30,000 years ago. Since colonization of the Tibetan Plateau, Tibetan culture has adapted and flourished in the western, southern, and eastern regions of the plateau. The northern portion, the Changtang, is generally too high and cold to support permanent population. One of the most notable civilizations to have developed on the Tibetan Plateau is the Tibetan Empire from the 7th century to the 9th century AD. == Impact on other regions  Role in monsoons === Natural-colour satellite image of the Tibetan Plateau Monsoons are caused by the different amplitudes of surface temperature seasonal cycles between land and oceans. This differential warming occurs because heating rates differ between land and water. Ocean heating is distributed vertically through a \\"mixed layer\\" that may be 50 meters deep through the action of wind and buoyancy-generated turbulence, whereas the land surface conducts heat slowly, with the seasonal signal penetrating only a meter or so. Additionally, the specific heat capacity of liquid water is significantly greater than that of most materials that make up land. Together, these factors mean that the heat capacity of the layer participating in the seasonal cycle is much larger over the oceans than over land, with the consequence that the land warms and cools faster than the ocean. In turn, air over the land warms faster and reaches a higher temperature than does air over the ocean.Oracle Thinkquest Education Foundation. monsoons: causes of monsoons. Retrieved on 22 May 2008. The warmer air over land tends to rise, creating an area of low pressure. The pressure anomaly then causes a steady wind to blow toward the land, which brings the moist air over the ocean surface with it. Rainfall is then increased by the presence of the moist ocean air. The rainfall is stimulated by a variety of mechanisms, such as low-level air being lifted upwards by mountains, surface heating, convergence at the surface, divergence aloft, or from storm-produced outflows near the surface. When such lifting occurs, the air cools due to expansion in lower pressure, which in turn produces condensation and precipitation. In winter, the land cools off quickly, but the ocean maintains the heat longer. The hot air over the ocean rises, creating a low-pressure area and a breeze from land to ocean while a large area of drying high pressure is formed over the land, increased by wintertime cooling. Monsoons are similar to sea and land breezes, a term usually referring to the localized, diurnal cycle of circulation near coastlines everywhere, but they are much larger in scale, stronger and seasonal. The seasonal monsoon wind shift and weather associated with the heating and cooling of the Tibetan plateau is the strongest such monsoon on Earth. ==Glaciology: the Ice Age and at present== The Himalayas as seen from space looking south from over the Tibetan Plateau. Today, Tibet is an important heating surface of the atmosphere. However, during the Last Glacial Maximum, an approximately ice sheet covered the plateau. See chapter entitled: \\"Reconstruction of an approximately complete Quaternary Tibetan Inland Glaciation between the Mt. Everest and Cho Oyu Massifs and the Aksai Chin. ‚Äì A new glaciogeomorphological southeast-northwest diagonal profile through Tibet and its consequences for the glacial isostasy and Ice Age cycle\\". Due to its great extent, this glaciation in the subtropics was an important element of radiative forcing. With a much lower latitude, the ice in Tibet reflected at least four times more radiation energy per unit area into space than ice at higher latitudes. Thus, while the modern plateau heats the overlying atmosphere, during the Last Ice Age it helped to cool it. This cooling had multiple effects on regional climate. Without the thermal low pressure caused by the heating, there was no monsoon over the Indian subcontinent. This lack of monsoon caused extensive rainfall over the Sahara, expansion of the Thar Desert, more dust deposited into the Arabian Sea, and a lowering of the biotic life zones on the Indian subcontinent. Animals responded to this shift in climate, with the Javan rusa migrating into India. In addition, the glaciers in Tibet created meltwater lakes in the Qaidam Basin, the Tarim Basin, and the Gobi Desert, despite the strong evaporation caused by the low latitude. Silt and clay from the glaciers accumulated in these lakes; when the lakes dried at the end of the ice age, the silt and clay were blown by the downslope wind off the Plateau. These airborne fine grains produced the enormous amount of loess in the Chinese lowlands. ===Effects of climate change=== The Tibetan Plateau contains the world's third-largest store of ice.

The facility is located on Mount Locke in the Davis Mountains of West Texas, with additional facilities on Mount Fowlkes, approximately to the northeast. The observatory is part of the University of Texas at Austin. It is an organized research unit of the College of Natural Sciences. The observatory produces StarDate, a daily syndicated radio program consisting of short segments related to astronomy that airs on both National Public Radio and commercial radio stations ‚Äî about 400 affiliates in all. ==History== McDonald Observatory The McDonald Observatory was originally endowed by the Texas banker William Johnson McDonald (1844-1926), who left about $1 million - the bulk of his fortune - to the University of Texas to endow an astronomical observatory. The provision of the will was challenged by McDonald's relatives, but after a long legal fight, the University received about $800,000 from the estate and construction began at Mt. Locke. The then-unnamed Otto Struve Telescope was dedicated on May 5, 1939, and at that time was the second largest telescope in the world. McDonald Observatory was operated under contract by the University of Chicago until the 1960s, when control was transferred to the University of Texas at Austin under the direction of Harlan J. Smith. Research today at the McDonald Observatory encompasses a wide variety of topics and projects, including planetary systems, stars and stellar spectroscopy, the interstellar medium, extragalactic astronomy, and theoretical astronomy.

Electric motors and position sensors at the Otto Struve Telescope at the McDonald Observatory, Texas. The Otto Struve Telescope, dedicated in 1939, was the first large telescope built at the observatory. It is located on Mt. Locke at an altitude of . The summit of Mt. Locke, accessed by Spur 78, is the highest point on Texas highways. The Harlan J. Smith Telescope, also on Mt. Locke, was completed in 1968. The Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET), dedicated in late 1997, is located on the summit of Mt. Fowlkes at above sea level. It is operated jointly by the University of Texas at Austin, Pennsylvania State University, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, and Georg-August University of G√∂ttingen. As of 2019, after upgrades the HET is tied with the Keck Telescopes as the second or third largest telescope in the world. However, its cost was about 20% that of other similarly-sized telescopes in use today due to its optimization for spectroscopy. ==Telescopes== Domes of the 2.1 m Otto Struve Telescope (left) and 2.7 m Harlan J.

Its principal activity is the production, marketing and sale of Isuzu commercial vehicles and diesel engines. It also has a number of subsidiaries, including Anadolu Isuzu (a Turkish joint venture with Anadolu Group), Sollers-Isuzu (a Russian joint venture with Sollers JSC), SML Isuzu (an Indian venture formerly known as Swaraj Mazda), Jiangxi Isuzu Motors (a Chinese joint venture with Jiangling Motors Company Group), Isuzu Astra Motor Indonesia, Isuzu Malaysia (Isuzu HICOM), Isuzu UK, Isuzu South Africa, Isuzu Philippines, Taiwan Isuzu Motors, Isuzu Vietnam, Isuzu Motors India and BYD Isuzu. Isuzu has assembly and manufacturing plants in Fujisawa which has been there since the company was founded under earlier names, as well as in the Tochigi and Hokkaid≈ç prefectures. Isuzu-branded vehicles are sold in most commercial markets worldwide. Isuzu's primary market focus is on commercial diesel-powered truck, buses and construction, while their Japanese competitor Yanmar focuses on commercial-level powerplants and generators. By 2009, Isuzu had produced over 21 million diesel engines, which can be found in vehicles all over the world. Isuzu diesel engines are used by dozens of vehicle manufacturers, including General Motors. The name Isuzu translates into English as \\"fifty bells\\". ==History== Isuzu Sumida bus 1927 Wolseley CP series (Japanese built) Isuzu Motors' history began in 1916, when Tokyo Ishikawajima Shipbuilding and Engineering Co., Ltd. planned a cooperation with the Tokyo Gas and Electric Industrial Co. to build automobiles. The next step was taken in 1918, when a technical cooperation with Wolseley Motors Limited was initiated, yielding exclusive rights to the production and sales of Wolseley vehicles in East Asia from knock-down kits. In 1919 came the first ever Japan-produced passenger car, a Wolseley model, the Fifteen A9 15/40 –ù–† at the Tokyo Ishikawajima Shipyard at the Fukagawa Factory. The Wolseley sourced CP truck followed two years later; 550 of these were built by 1927.In 1923 Japan was devastated by the Kanto earthquake and heavy construction vehicles were imported from the United States companies GMC and Ford to aid in recovery and reconstruction, and the company sought to contribute by producing locally built construction and heavy duty vehicles. In 1927 the company introduced its 2-ton load capacity \\"Sumida P-type truck\\" equipped with an A6 engine and a 1-ton vehicle \\"Sumida M-type No. 1 bus\\" equipped with an A4 engine. The name \\"sumida\\" was used from the Sumida River as the factory at Fukagawa was close by. In 1929 IHI Corporation, separated part of its manufacturing business and merged with DAT Automobile Manufacturing Inc. (a predecessor of Nissan) and changed its name to Jidosha Kogyo Co., Ltd. (Automobile Industries Co., Ltd.) The names used for the products of this company, marketed as \\"Sumida\\" and \\"Chiyoda\\", have special significance in Japan. Chiyoda is a district in Tokyo where the Imperial Palace is located, and Sumida refers to a river that flows through Tokyo approximately west of the Imperial Palace. Later, the company was renamed from Ishikawajima Motor Co. , Ltd., to Isuzu (after the Isuzu River) in 1934, following a meeting with the Japanese Government's Ministry of Trade and Industry (MITI). In 1934 the Tsurumi Factory opened under company name Automobile Industry Co., Ltd. and in 1937 Automobile Industries was reorganized and formed into a new company, Tokyo Automobile Industries Co., Ltd. and was founded with a capital of ¬•1,000,000. The company continued to manufacture heavy duty trucks and passenger busses, realizing the need to modernize the transportation infrastructure of Japan, and was one of the primary manufacturers for the Imperial Japanese Army along with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and had a corporate allegiance to the Yasuda zaibatsu. One of the vehicles it produced for the war effort was the Sumida M.2593 armored personnel carrier. In 1942, Hino Heavy Industries was split off from Isuzu, becoming a separate corporation. ===Etymology=== The word Isuzu translated into English means \\"fifty bells\\"‚Äîhence the focus on \\"bell\\" in both the later Bellel and the Bellett. The name was used from the Isuzu River that flows near to the Ise Grand Shrine, one of Japan's most sacred and revered shrines. The company adopted the name in 1949. ===Post World War history=== Truck and bus production of the (TX40 and TU60) series and the Isuzu Sumida bus resumed in 1945, with the permission of the occupation authorities.Ishikawa, p. 7 and has remained the primary focus of manufacture for the company, along with diesel engine production. In 1958 a factory was built at Fujisawa, Kanagawa, and in 1959 the Isuzu Elf was introduced as a medium duty cab over commercial truck which is still in production, and was also shared with the Isuzu Journey bus. Isuzu continued to maintain its market presence by providing commercial vehicles by introducing the Isuzu TY in 1966. The company is one of the primary manufacturers of commercial duty trucks and busses for public transportation, to include the Isuzu Cubic, Isuzu Gala and the Isuzu Erga along with the Isuzu Giga. ===Corporate Partnerships=== Beginning in 1953 the Hillman Minx passenger car is produced under license of Rootes Group giving the company a passenger car to compete with other Japanese manufacturers, realizing that their resources were limited and therefore sought out international partnerships. The Minx remained in production until 1962, after the 1961 introduction of Isuzu's first passenger car, the Bellel, and later the sports coupe Isuzu 117 Coup√©. Being a small producer making cars which were somewhat too large and pricey for the Japanese market at the time, Isuzu spent some time looking for a commercial partner. Under pressure from MITI, who were attempting to limit the number of automobile manufacturers in Japan, a cooperation with Fuji Heavy Industries (Subaru) began in 1966. This joint sales-service collaboration was seen as the first step towards an eventual merger. The Subaru 1000 was even shown in Isuzu's 1967 annual vehicle brochure, as a suitable complement to the larger Isuzu lineup. This tie-up was over by 1968, when an agreement with Mitsubishi was formed. This ended even more quickly, by 1969, and the next year an equally short-lived collaboration was entered with Nissan.Ruiz, p. 131 A few months later, in September 1971, what was to prove a more durable capital agreement was signed with General Motors. ===Linking with General Motors=== Isuzu 117 Coupe While the company had a long relationship with GM going back to the 1920's, the first investment of GM taking a 34% stake in Isuzu was seen in 1972, when the Chevrolet LUV became the first Isuzu-built vehicle to be sold in the United States. To symbolize the new beginning, Isuzu also developed a new logo for 1974, with two vertical pillars as stylized representations of the first syllable in „ÅÑ„Åô„Çû (\\"Isuzu\\"). In 1974 Isuzu introduced the Gemini, which was co-produced with General Motors as the T-body Chevrolet Chevette. A modified version was sold in the United States as Buick's Opel by Isuzu, and in Australia as the Holden Gemini. As a result of the collaboration, certain American GM products were sold to Japanese customers through Isuzu dealerships. Holden's Statesman was also briefly sold (246 examples) with Isuzu badging in Japan during the seventies. Isuzu exports also increased considerably as a result of being able to use GM networks, from 0.7% of production in 1973 to 35.2% by 1976; this while overall production increased more than fourfold in the same period. As a result of the GM joint venture, Isuzu engines were also used by existing GM divisions (some USA-market Chevrolet automobiles had Isuzu powertrains e.g. the Chevette and early S10/S15 trucks manufactured prior to 1985). 1966 Isuzu Bellett 1600 GT (PR90) In 1981 Isuzu began selling consumer and commercial vehicles under their own brand in the United States. The Isuzu P'Up was the first model sold to consumers as an Isuzu, rather than as a Chevrolet or Buick, along with the Isuzu Piazza sports car. Isuzu's then president Toshio Okamoto then initiated a collaboration with small-car expert Suzuki to develop a global small car for GM, the S-car. A three-way agreement of co-ownership was signed in August 1981, with Isuzu and Suzuki exchanging shares and General Motors taking a 5% share of Suzuki. Following on from this, in 1985 Isuzu and GM established the IBC Vehicles venture in the United Kingdom, producing locally built versions of Isuzu and Suzuki light vans (the Isuzu Fargo and Suzuki Carry); to be sold in the European market under Vauxhall's Bedford brand. During this period Isuzu also developed a worldwide presence as an exporter of diesel engines, with their powerplants in use by Opel/Vauxhall, Land Rover, Hindustan, and many others. Two Isuzu model lines (Gemini, Impulse) were marketed as part of the Geo division (Spectrum, Storm) when it was initially launched as a Chevrolet subsidiary. In the domestic Japanese market, OEM deals with other manufacturers were entered to aid the poorly performing passenger car arm. It led to the badging of Suzukis, beginning in 1986, and Subaru small commercial vehicles as Isuzus (Geminett, Geminett II). This OEM tie-up occurred alongside the establishment of SIA (Subaru-Isuzu Automotive), an American joint venture with Fuji Heavy Industries (the parent company of Subaru). Shortly afterwards, the Lafayette, Indiana plant became operational. ===Contraction begins=== 1967 Isuzu Unicab, a two-wheel-drive utility vehicle Isuzu ended US sales of the Impulse (Geo Storm) in 1992, and the following year it stopped exporting the Stylus (the basis for the Geo Spectrum), the last Isuzu-built car sold in the US. In 1993 Isuzu began a new vehicle exchange program with Honda, whereby Honda sold the Isuzu Rodeo and Isuzu Trooper as the Honda Passport and Acura SLX, respectively. In return Isuzu began selling the Honda Odyssey as the Isuzu Oasis. Thus, Honda's lineup gained two SUVs, and Isuzu's lineup gained a minivan. In the Japanese market, the Gemini (Stylus) was now a rebadged Honda Domani and the Aska (originally based on the GM J-car) was a Honda Accord. Isuzu's United States sales reached a peak in 1996 after the introduction of the Isuzu Hombre pickup, a badge- engineered GM truck (using the sheetmetal of the Brazil-market Chevrolet S10). Isuzu resurrected the beloved Amigo in 1998, before changing the name of the 2-door convertible to Rodeo Sport in 2001 in an attempt to associate it with the better selling 4-door Rodeo. The new Axiom launched in 2001, with the fictional salesman Joe Isuzu from 1980s advertising campaigns brought back to promote it. Isuzu sales began to slide due to the ageing of the Rodeo and Trooper, and poor management and a lack of assistance from GM. The Rodeo Sport was discontinued in 2003, while production of the Rodeo and Axiom ceased a year later. By this point sales in North America had slowed to just 27,188, with the discontinued Rodeo and Axiom making up 71% of that total. In 1998 General Motors and Isuzu formed DMAX, a joint venture to produce diesel engines. GM raised its stake in Isuzu to 49% the following year, effectively gaining control of the company, and quickly followed this up by appointing an American GM executive to head Isuzu's North American Operations. This marked the first time a non-Japanese executive had held such a high position at Isuzu. In 2001 GM and Isuzu announced plans to share distribution networks and for Chevrolet to market an Isuzu product. Isuzu VehiCROSS The production version of the heralded VehiCROSS was introduced to the US in 1999, but met with mixed reviews, as its high pricetag, unique styling and two-door configuration did not seem to meet with market demands. Production of the VehiCROSS and other sport utility vehicles, including the Trooper, ended in 2001 as part of a major financial reorganization which eliminated almost 10,000 jobs. GM had been pushing the company to focus exclusively on producing commercial vehicles and engines. The number of Isuzu dealerships in the US began a rapid decline, and by 2005 had only 2 models: the Ascender (a re- badged GMC Envoy) and the i-series pickup truck (a rebadged Chevrolet Colorado). At this point, Isuzu in the US was primarily a distributor of medium duty trucks such as the N-series, sourced both from Japan and US plants in Janesville, Wisconsin and Flint, Michigan. Isuzu had 290 light-vehicle dealers in the US in August 2006, and sold an average of just two Ascenders per dealer per month, and rumors of Isuzu's withdrawal from the US market were rampant. Plans to introduce a new Thai-built SUV for 2007 were shelved when Isuzu Motors Limited decided that a new SUV would be too risky, instead proceeding with the launch of the i-series trucks. Despite extremely low sales figures of 12,177 passenger vehicles for 2005 (with leftover Axiom and Rodeos making up 30% of this), Isuzu Motors America announced its first profit in years, mainly due to restructuring cuts. In early 2002, Fuji Heavy Industries (Subaru's parent company) bought Isuzu's share of Lafayette, Indiana plant, and Subaru Isuzu Automotive (SIA) became Subaru of Indiana Automotive. After 8 years of heavy Honda Passport sales and light Isuzu Oasis sales, Honda and Isuzu cooperatively ended their vehicle exchange agreement in 2001. The Oasis was dropped, and Honda replaced the Passport with the Pilot. 2001 was Isuzu's last year for passenger vehicles in Canada, as Isuzus in Canada were mostly sold at Saturn-Saab dealerships. In late 2002 Isuzu initiated a recapitalization and debt-for-equity conversion plan to stave off a bankruptcy. GM acquired 20% of DMAX, 60% of Isuzu Motors Polska and Isuzu Motors Germany, and the rights to three types of diesel engine technology from Isuzu. by paying 50 billion yen (about US$425 million). GM also paid 10 billion yen (about US$85 million) for a 12% stake in the recapitalized company. GM wrote off its investment in Isuzu in 2001. Production of the 7-passenger Ascender ended in February 2006 with the closure of GM's Oklahoma City Assembly plant, leaving Isuzu with the 5-passenger Ascender, built in Moraine, Ohio and the low-selling i-Series as its only retail products. The company sold just 1,504 vehicles in North America in the first two months of 2006. GM ended its equity investment in Isuzu and sold all its shares to Mitsubishi Corporation, Itochu and Mizuho Corporate Bank; both GM and Isuzu claimed the companies would continue their relationship, but there was no word as of April 12, 2006 on the effect this would have on DMAX operations. Isuzu LT132L on a Hong Kong motorway Isuzu LV486R CNG City Bus in Bangkok with the CNG-MPI Engine In June 2006 Isuzu and GM agreed to establish a joint venture called \\"LCV Platform Engineering Corporation (LPEC)\\" to develop a new pickup. Isuzu said it would use its engineering expertise to develop the pickup and GM would develop derivatives based on the integrated platform. Mitsubishi Corp became Isuzu's largest shareholder in October 2006, after it converted all the preferred shares in Isuzu it had held since 2005 into common stock, increasing its shareholding from 3.5% to 15.65%. In November 2006 Toyota purchased 5.9% of Isuzu, becoming the third largest shareholder behind Itochu and Mitsubishi Corporation, and the two companies agreed to study possible business collaboration focusing on the areas of R&D; and production of diesel engines, related emissions-control, and other environmental technologies. In January 2007 Isuzu and General Motors updated the LCV range with a 3.0 litre common rail diesel engine that had far more torque and power than its predecessor. In August 2007 Isuzu and Toyota agreed to develop a 1.6-liter diesel engine for use in Toyota vehicles sold in European markets. At this point, details of development, production and supply of the diesel engine were still under discussion, but in principle, Isuzu would play the leading role, with production scheduled to begin around 2012. On January 30, 2008 Isuzu announced its complete withdrawal from the US market, effective January 31, 2009. It would continue to provide support and parts. The decision was due to lack of sales. Some of the lack of sales was blamed on consumer experiences with low quality engines and service. Isuzu had been experiencing a slow decline since the late 1990s. In less than 10 years, they had gone from selling a complete line of cars, trucks, and SUVs, into being a specialized SUV maker, and finally selling only a pair of rebadged, General Motors Trucks. The company continued to sell commercial vehicles in the US. Isuzu and Toyota shelved development of a clean diesel engine in December 2008. On January 29, 2009, Isuzu and General Motors announced that they were in talks to transfer the operation of the medium-duty truck production line in Flint, Michigan to Isuzu for a five-year period. In June, however, GM announced that these talks failed to reach an agreement, and GM instead ceased production of the Chevrolet Kodiak and GMC Topkick vehicles on 31 July 2009. In July 2016, Isuzu and Mazda agreed to collaborate to produce the next-generation pickup trucks for Mazda outside of North America. Isuzu‚Äôs plant in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh began operations in 2016.Isuzu Motors opens manufacturing plant in Andhra Pradesh , Economic Times, April 27, 2016 In August 2018, Toyota sold off its 5.9% stake in Isuzu. In December 2019, Isuzu announced that it had signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding which would eventually see Volvo sell UD Trucks to them. ==Market presence== Isuzu Gemini with European (Maltese) registration plates Isuzu NHR (Elf) light truck In most of Asia and Africa, Isuzu is known primarily for trucks of all sizes, after Isuzu dropped all sales of sedans and compact cars in the late 1990s due to plummeting sales. In the days when Isuzu sold passenger cars, they were known for focusing on the diesel-engined niche. In 1983, for instance, long before the explosion in diesel sales, diesels represented 63.4% of their passenger car production. In 2009, Isuzu abandoned the United States consumer market due to lack of sales. Isuzu as a corporation has always been primarily a manufacturer of small to medium compact automobiles and commercial trucks of sizes medium duty and larger, but markets around the world show different needs. Isuzu Motors America discontinued the sale of passenger vehicles in the United States on January 31, 2009. The company explained to its dealers that it had not been able to secure replacements for the Isuzu Ascender and Isuzu i-Series that would be commercially viable. Isuzu sold 7,098 cars in the year 2007. This action did not affect Isuzu's commercial vehicle or industrial diesel engine operations in the United States. Isuzu has a contract with Budget Truck Rental to manufacture their rental trucks, shared with Ford, GMC, and Navistar International. In Australia, Isuzu was for many years a major supplier of light commercial and domestic vehicles to Holden (General Motors). However, by 2008, Holden was sourcing few Isuzus. At this time Isuzu began to sell the D-Max under the Isuzu name. Isuzu's entry in the Thai market proved to be one of its most successful. Its presence in the country began in 1966 when it established a manufacturing facility for pick-up trucks in the Samuthprakarn province with a capacity of 155,000 units per year. The automaker quickly became a market leader so that by 2002, the company transferred its production base from its original location in Fujisuwa, Japan to Thailand. Isuzu claimed the largest share of the Thai commercial vehicle market, outperforming its competitors for at least 23 years. By 2006, the company transferred to an industrial zone in Chacheongsao province to support further production expansion. By 2017, Isuzu has been exporting pick-up trucks, with shipments reaching North America, Latin America, Australia, and Japan. In the same year, it announced that its profit climbed 7 percent and has doubled its annual truck production to meet overseas demands. ==Subsidiaries and joint venturesJapan=== The Fujisawa Plant was built and opened for production November 1961. It is located at 8 Tsuchidana, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, and is still producing commercial vehicles for domestic Japanese use and international exports. The Toghichi Plant, located at Hakuchu, Ohira-Machi, Tochigi, Tochigi, is where the engines are currently built. There was a factory at Tonomachi, Kawasaki-ku, Kawasaki-shi, Kanagawa Pref. that closed March 2005 that manufactured passenger vehicles. ===Mimamori-kun online service=== Mimamori-kun, which means to watch, monitor, or observe in Japanese (literally \\"Mr. Watcher\\"), is a commercial vehicle telematics service developed by Isuzu Motors for monitoring and tracking commercial vehicle operations and movements in Japan. The service uses GPS satellite tracking services, and began February 2004. It is connected to the internet and provides government mandated driver activity logs, and records how long the driver was on-duty and how much time was spent driving. The service also records when the driver took lunch breaks, where the truck stopped and for how long, and when the driver logged off for his duty shift. The service has been modified for personal use in Japan to keep track of family members, to include elderly members of health status and location of children for safety purposes. Some of the main features include the wireless Internet Digital Tachograph, the first of its kind in Japan, combined with hands-free communication, voice guidance, and text messages displayed from the dispatch office. The system also has a password-enabled vehicle theft prevention feature that will not let the vehicle start without the driver having entered a password. ===International operations=== * DMAX (engines) - former joint venture with General Motors in United States for production of diesel engines * Ghandhara Industries - joint venture in Pakistan - trucks, buses * Guangzhou Automobile Group Bus - joint venture in China - buses * HICOM Automotive Manufacturers (Malaysia) - joint venture in Malaysia - trucks, SUVs * Industries M√©caniques Maghr√©bines - joint venture at Kairouan, Tunisia - trucks, SUVs * Isuzu (Anadolu) - joint venture in Turkey - trucks, buses * Isuzu Astra Motor Indonesia - joint venture in Indonesia - trucks, SUVs * Isuzu HICOM Malaysia - joint venture in Malaysia - trucks, SUVs * Isuzu Commercial Truck of America, Inc. * Isuzu Malaysia - joint venture in Malaysia - trucks, SUVs * Isuzu Motors de M√©xico - joint venture in Malaysia - trucks, buses * Isuzu Motors Polska - former joint venture in Poland - diesel engines, taken over by General Motors * Isuzu Motorsports - Australia and Thailand * Isuzu Philippines - joint venture in the Philippines - trucks, SUVs * General Motors De Portugal-FMAT S.A. at Tramagal near Abrantes (Assembling company of all Bedford and Isuzu medium to heavy diesel trucks and 4X4 Pickup models since the 1960s then vehicles are sent for sale in Portugal and Spain) * The assembling of Isuzu commercial trucks is carried out by the Az Universal Motors which is part of the AzGroup in Azerbaijan. * Isuzu Motors Saudi Arabia - joint venture in Saudi Arabia - trucks, SUVs * Isuzu Truck (UK) - at the former IBC factory Dunstable, England - trucks, SUVs * Isuzu Truck South Africa - joint venture in South Africa - trucks * Isuzu Vietnam - joint venture in Vietnam - trucks, SUVs * Jiangxi Isuzu - joint venture in China - trucks, SUVs * Qingling Motors - joint venture in China - trucks, SUVs * SML Isuzu - joint venture in India, formerly Swaraj Mazda * Sollers-Isuzu - joint venture in Russia - trucks * Taiwan Isuzu Motors - joint venture in Taiwan - trucks * Thai Rung Union Car - Thailand - assembles SUVs ===Former international operations=== * Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc. - former joint venture in United States, interest sold to Subaru - cars, SUVs * Zexel - Japan - auto components, now part of Bosch == Isuzu Diesel Engines / Power Train division == Diesel engines are a major part of the Isuzu Motor's business with over 20 million engines worldwide.

The patriarch, Percival Lowle (1571‚Äì1665), described as a \\"solid citizen of Bristol\\", determined at the age of 68 that the future was in the New World. By the 19th and 20th centuries, the Lowells descended from John Lowell (1743‚Äì1802) were widely considered to be one of U.S. most accomplished families.Cleveland Amory, The Proper BostoniansGreat American Family: The Lowells of Massachusetts. Oxfordclothbuttondown.com. March 2012. Massachusetts Bay Colony Governor John Winthrop needed solid, dependable people to settle the North Shore area as a buffer against the French from Canada and urged that the Lowells relocate to Newburyport on the Merrimack River, at the border of the failing Province of Maine. ==Ancestry in the UKOrigin of the name=== Many suggestions about the origins of the medieval name Lowle were offered during the late 20th century. Some argued that it was Welsh or Saxon while others supported the name was of Norman origin. One possibility is that it originates from the Latin word lupellus (wolf-cub) from Latin lupus (wolf). Lowell family historian Delmar R. Lowell, gave much weight and persuasion to the origins of the name Lowle in his work and he and others concluded the Lowles of England were unquestionably of Norman descent.Lowell, Delmar R., The Historic Genealogy of the Lowells of America from 1639 to 1899 (pp 208‚Äì209); Rutland VT, The Tuttle Company, 1899; . There were still Louels in Scotland on the Scottish Marches in the Royal Burgh of Roxburgh when Edward Longshanks, King of England, ordered the nobility and gentry in Scotland to swear an oath of allegiance to him in the Ragman Roll in 1291. It is during this period, in 1288, that the earliest documentation for the name Lowle appears. William Lowle of Yardley in Worcestershire is documented as a yeoman, and standing as a witness to a border dispute between two of his neighbours. It is from this period that Delmar Lowell traces the descent of the Lowles through England until their departure for the colonies. Documentation for this period also exists in The National Archives of England showing that there were also Lowels in the Welsh Marches. In 1317, William de Braose, 2nd Baron Braose petitioned King Edward II, the King's Council, and the Parliament to request that Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March send two justices to arrest and bring to trial 200‚Äì300 men he accused of attacking his Knights and Ministers and for, \\"trespasses made against the King's peace to Brewose and his people of Gower.\\", a peninsula, part of Glamorgan in Wales. Members named in this band of men included Ieuan and Griffith Lowel for the attack at Eynon. ===Coat of arms=== The Harleian Society, a British publisher of the official Royal Heraldic visitations, describes the Lowle Coate of Arms from the herald's records taken in Somersetshire in the years 1573, 1591, and 1623. *Blazon: Sable, a dexter hand couped at the wrist grasping three darts, one in pale and two in saltire, all in argent. *Crest: A Stag's head cabossed, between the attires a pheon azure. *Motto: Occasionem Cognosce (oh-kay-see-OH-nem kogg- NOHS-keh). The coat of arms has a shield with black field displaying a right hand cut-off at the wrist and grabbing three arrows, one vertical and two crossed diagonally, in silver; above the shield is a male deer's head with a barbed, broad arrowhead in blue between its antlers. A loose translation of the family motto is Know Your Opportunity. The use of the Lowle Coat of Arms has varied slightly between the generations; some families omitted the pheon azure or substituted blunted bolts for the pointed darts; and one generation, notably a pastor, used an urn in his families crest instead of the stag's head. The right for a man to bear arms traditionally passes from father to eldest son; occasionally subsequent generations change the Coat of Arms to reflect their lives or vocations better, sometimes even \\"quartering\\" their Coat of Arms with another family by way of marriage. Some believe that the Lowle Coat of Arms fell into abeyance when Percival Lowle and his sons emigrated to Massachusetts. They were still subjects of the Crown and its favor until the colonies declared Independence from Britain in 1776 and were entitled to bear their Coat of Arms. Also, there were a number of Lowles who remained in England who could claim the right. ==Lowle to Lowell== After Percival Lowle emigrated to the New World with his sons and after some subsequent generations Lowle became Lowell. Delmar Lowell suggests that Rev. John Lowell was the catalyst in getting the Lowell family into cohesion regarding the spelling of the surname sometime after 1721. At the time, Lowells all over New England spelled their names as many different ways as there were branches. Some spelled their surname Lowel, Lowle, Lowell, Lowl, and some spelled it Louell, and Louel even after arriving in the new world. Spelling was so poorly controlled that some early wills show one son with the name Lowle while another son is Lowel and the wife as Lowell all in the same document. It's unlikely that one member of the family had such a big impact on the name. He may well have influenced many Lowells in America to be consistent, but documentation shows that Lowles in England started spelling their name Lowell around this time as well. By the mid 18th century in England there are plenty of documents for Lowells and none for the prior spellings. This suggests that the proliferation of literacy and a trend to standardize the English language caused members of the family on both sides of the Atlantic to adopt the phonetic spelling. ==Family tree== The Lowell family of Boston was traditionally known as the descendants of John Lowell (1743‚Äì1802) of Newburyport. His descendants were the Lowells well known as members the Boston Brahmins. * John Lowell (1743‚Äì1802), Member of the Continental Congress and Federal Judge ** John Lowell (1769‚Äì1840), lawyer and Federalist *** John Amory Lowell (1798‚Äì1881), industrialist, philanthropist **** John Lowell (1824‚Äì1897), Federal Judge ***** John Lowell (1856‚Äì1922), lawyer ****** Mary Emlen Lowell (1884‚Äì1975), Countess of Berkeley, m.

The highway runs southeast‚Äìnorthwest from an interchange with the New York State Thruway (I-90) northwest of Schenectady to another junction with the Thruway south of the city and passes through Downtown Schenectady along the way. Most of I-890 is six lanes wide, including a section that runs above an industrial section of Schenectady on an elevated highway. I-890 is a local, toll-free alternative to the Thruway, which bypasses the city and its suburbs to the southwest. The section of I-890 west of downtown Schenectady was mostly built over what was once part of New York State Route 5S (NY 5S). I-890 was constructed in stages during the 1960s and 1970s, and NY 5S was gradually cut back to its current terminus west of Schenectady as more pieces of I-890 were completed. The highway is one of four Interstate Highways in New York to use distance-based exit numbering, the result of a New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) experiment from the 1970s. In Schenectady County, I-890 is designated as the Schenectady County Veterans Memorial Highway.https://law.justia.com/codes/new-york/2015/hay/article-12/342-zz/ ==Route description== I-890 begins at the toll booth for exit 26 of the New York State Thruway in the Schenectady County town of Rotterdam. It initially heads to the east, connecting to NY 890 and NY 5S by way of a modified trumpet interchange that directly feeds into the Thruway junction. At this point, I-890 takes over the four-lane right-of-way established by NY 890 to the north and follows the Mohawk River (Erie Canal) and CSX Transportation's Selkirk Subdivision rail line southeast toward Schenectady. The first of I-890 passes through mostly undeveloped, wooded areas, a trend that finally ends as the highway curves east to meet the north end of NY 337 at exit 2 near the Rotterdam Square shopping mall. Continuing on, I-890 follows the Mohawk River along the northern edge of General Electric's Schenectady plant, connecting to the facility by way of two separate exits serving different parts of the complex. Aerial view of downtown Schenectady, looking east, with I-890 running across the city from center left to center right Not far from the GE plant is downtown Schenectady, which the now six-lane I-890 largely bypasses to the south and west on an elevated highway passing over a mostly industrial section of the city. The section closest to the city center runs past by the campus of Schenectady County Community College and provides panoramic views of downtown Schenectady. I-890 heads south from downtown, crossing over the Delaware and Hudson Railway and CSX's Hudson Subdivision before finally connecting to downtown by way of Broadway at exit 5\\\\. Past Broadway, the elevated highway comes to an end as I-890 heads southeastward into a dense residential area on a plateau overlooking the city. The homes are not visible from I-890, however, as the freeway is lined on both sides by a thick line of trees serving as noise barriers. The residential section of Schenectady is served by a single exit for Michigan Avenue, a local street that connects to NY 146 at a junction two blocks north of I-890. From here, the freeway passes under NY 146 before curving to the south and exiting the city limits. Now back in the town of Rotterdam, I-890 runs parallel to NY 146 to an interchange with NY 7\\\\. The state route joins I-890, following the highway as it narrows to four lanes and crosses back over the Hudson Subdivision rail line. I-890 and NY 7 connect to High Bridge Road (County Route 48) at exit 8, the last junction in a residential area and the last in Schenectady County. Exit 9, located just south of the Albany County line in a lightly developed commercial area, serves as the end of NY 7's its wrong-way concurrency with I-890; the southbound exit also links to NY 146 by way of a long ramp connecting to the state route. I-890 ends a short distance south of the exit at the toll booths for exit 25 of the New York State Thruway. The section of I-890 in Schenectady County is designated as the Schenectady County Veterans Memorial Highway. Exit numbering on I-890 is distance-based, a holdover from a NYSDOT experiment during the early 1970s. However, because of how the exits are spaced along I-890, the exit numbers end up being mostly sequential anyway, with the only evidence of distance based numbering being the existence of exit 4C. I-890 is one of four Interstate Highways in New York that first utilized milepost-based exit numbering in contrast to the sequential exit numbering used elsewhere in New York. ==History== 1955 Yellow Book map of Schenectady, showing what would become I-90 and I-890 The original riverside roadway along the southern bank of the Mohawk River in western Schenectady was designated as part of NY 5S in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY 5S entered the Schenectady area on River Road and followed River and Rice Roads and Erie Boulevard into downtown Schenectady, where it ended at NY 5. In the initial plans for the Interstate Highway System, outlined by the Bureau of Public Roads in the 1955 Yellow Book, the city of Schenectady would be served by two highways: one bypassing the city to the southwest (the New York State Thruway) and another that would loop north of the bypass route to serve downtown Schenectady. The western portion of the loop route would run through the NY 5S corridor. The first section of I-890 to be completed was the portion from New York State Thruway exit 25 southeast of Schenectady to Altamont Avenue (NY 146), which opened to traffic as I-890 . A short extension to Brandywine Avenue was completed by 1964. By 1968, all of I-890 west to modern exit 3 was complete and open to traffic. As planned, I-890 replaced NY 5S from downtown Schenectady to exit 3, where NY 5S now terminated. The remainder of the expressway was built . NY 5S was cut back to I-890 exit 2 in the mid-1970s, then to its modern eastern terminus in the late 1980s following a reconfiguration of the interchange linking I-890 to New York State Thruway exit 26. ==Exit list== ==See also== * ==References== ==External links== 90-8 90-8 8 Category:Transportation in Albany County, New York Category:Transportation in Schenectady County, New York ","title":"Interstate 890"},{"id":"523318","text":"Juan de Dios Ventura Soriano (born 8 March 1940 in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic), better known as Johnny Ventura nicknamed , is a Dominican singer and band leader of merengue and salsa. He also served as vicemayor of Santo Domingo from 1994 to 1998, and as mayor of Santo Domingo from 1998 to 2002. ==Early history== He began his career as a singer when he presented himself with some friends in a program of devotees which was broadcast by La Voz de la Alegr√≠a weekly. The young Ventura, only 16 years of age, obtained first place of the participants. A little later, he started appearing in the programs of devotees which were sponsored by La Voz Dominicana. When Ventura Soriano appeared for the first time in the TV show: La TV busca una estrella, that was broadcast Friday night at seven, they rang the bell. In the following week, like a champion, Juan de Dios returned to be welcomed in the same competition. He practiced, worked and was crowned for the hit. Then he won first prize. Thereupon he won a lot of prizes in the devotees programs, until he was finally rewarded with the much desired scholarship which the broadcasting company, property of Jos√© Arismendy Trujillo Molina, gave for young talents. With La Voz Dominicana Juan de Dios studied music, vocal techniques and expression. This made Ventura one of the most famous singers in Latin America. ==Political career== In 1998, Ventura was elected mayor of Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic.https://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-767542 ==Musical career== In 1959, Juan de Dios decided to take the name 'Johnny Ventura'. He started his career as a singer in several bands that presented themselves at the dances in La Feria. He worked with the orchestra of Rond√≥n Votau and in 1961 with the band of the Dominican percussionist Donald Wild. In 1962 he sang with Combo Caribe of Luis P√©rez, with whom he recorded Cuidado Con el Cuabero, of which he was the author, and La Agarradera, of Luis P√©rez. It was with this band that he recorded his first LP consisting of 12 songs. In 1963, Johnny Ventura was recruited by the musical director Papa Molina to join La Super Orquesta San Jos√©, which he was the director at that time. He joined as singer and as player of the g√ºira. For two years Ventura was part of La Super Orquesta with stars such as Vinicio Franco and Grecia Aquino. Although no records remain of this group, this period was a landmark in his career. In 1964, the Cuban impresario Angel Guinea insisted on Johnny Ventura to create his own orchestra, the \\"Combo Show\\" which is known as an important part of the history of popular Dominican music. In 1965, with his orchestra, Ventura recorded for the Fonogram label the albums La Coquetona, La Resbalosa and El Turun Tun Tun. In 1967 he travelled to the United States, where he immediately became a star. He is credited with the song \\"La muerte de Martin\\", with the voice of Luisito Mart√≠, the Combo Show made their first golden record with Ah..! Yo No Se... No (1971). ==Discography== * La Agarradera Vol. 4 (1962) * Cuidado con el Cuabero (1963) * El Llor√≥n (El Flor√≥n) (1964) * 1920 y Otros √âxitos (1964) * El Turun Tun Tun (1965) * El Boogaloo Est√° en Algo (1965) * La Resbalosa (1965) * Siempre Pa' Lante (1966) * Figurando (1966) * El Papelito Blanco (1967) * Noches en Quisqueya (1968) * El Mamito (1968) * Siempre en √ìrbita (1969) * El Guataco (1970) * M√°s √âxitos (1970) * Ah..!

In order to explain psychological phenomena encountered in humans, he starts with the consideration of most basic organisms and how they are different from inanimate matter. First of all, any organism may be treated as an autonomous but open system, separated from its environment by means of a boundary (skin or cell membrane). As an open system, it is engaged in a continual exchange with its surroundings. That exchange may be regarded as twofold i.e. energetic and informational. For the sake of analysis, one may think of energy metabolism and information metabolism as separate processes. Kƒôpi≈Ñski postulates that life is sustained if both metabolisms are occurring, and it stops if one of them is ceased. The energy metabolism concept is relatively easy to understand. The molecules of the body are continually replaced. Catabolic and anabolic processes occur in cells. Information metabolism is the other side of the same process, but its objective is control. During the energy exchange, the organism strives to maintain its characteristic order (negentropy) and projects that order onto the surroundings. Due to that, the order of the surroundings is destroyed. By contrast, inanimate matter does not have the ability to maintain or lower its negentropy, because spontaneous natural processes are always accompanied by entropy generation. ===Two biological laws=== Information metabolism may be generally seen as the exchange of signals between the organism and its environment, but also as the processing of signals originating in the organism. These signals must be interpreted in relation to some goals. For all organisms these goals are predicated on two biological laws: the first law states that an organism must be oriented towards its own survival. The second law states that the preservation of the species is equally important. Kƒôpi≈Ñski noticed that these objectives are conflicting. The conflict between the two biological laws is often the source of ethical dilemmas. There are times when the organism needs to sacrifice its life in order to save its offspring. Sometimes it is forced to fight with the representatives of its own species, in order to protect itself. The first biological law is egoistic and related with withdrawal from reality (escape, destruction of reality etc.). The second biological law is altruistic and requires turning towards the reality (sexual reproduction requires union with the partner). In case of humans, the connection between the goals of various everyday actions and two biological laws is less direct, nevertheless these laws still motivate us. Humans are able to project themselves into the future, think abstractly and consciously and therefore their goals may possess transcendent and symbolic character. This fact is typically expressed as belief in a higher good or an afterlife. ===The hierarchy of value=== It is impossible to keep track of all information generated by various processes occurring in reality. As organisms strive to fulfill two biological laws, proper selection of signals becomes a central problem. According to Kƒôpi≈Ñski, a hierarchy of value is necessary in order to integrate information. In humans, that hierarchy comprises three levels i.e. biological, emotional and sociocultural. The first two levels are handled subconsciously. The third level, by contrast, is associated with consciousness. From the biological perspective, the number of processes occurring simultaneously in the organism and its physical surroundings is virtually infinite. There is also infinite number of ways in which these processes may be framed. That complexity must be reduced, as only selected signals may be sensed and processed in the nervous system. Moreover, the signals must be ordered according to their present and future relevance. The structure of the body and locations of various receptors are evolutionally adapted to assure isolation of the most relevant signals from the surrounding environment. The internal structure of the body is adjusted to ensure proper integration of information. Of all signals collected by the receptors, only the most important ones reach the level of subjective experience. At the level of signals reaching the field of subjective experience, attention is actively directed (with the help of emotions) towards those related with two biological laws. Perception is not passive and inclusive, but anticipatory and selective. Above biological and emotional levels of signal interpretation, there is the frame of social and cultural norms of the community, which serves as reference for conscious decisions. The sociocultural background plays significant role in people's lives. ===Two phases of information metabolism=== The division of information metabolism into two phases is loosely based on the analysis of the orienting response. Information metabolism is initiated by the perception of a change in the internal or external environment of the organism. In the first phase, the organism seeks to obtain direct information about the perceived phenomenon. Because of that, it must turn its attention 'outside' to the reality. The perceived phenomenon is then subconsciously evaluated. The result of that evaluation manifests itself as an emotion. The sign of the invoked emotion may be positive or negative. This emotion, arising quickly and automatically, serves as the background for the second phase of information metabolism. In the second phase, the organism executes a locomotor reaction to the phenomenon. Motion towards the source of the stimulus is performed if the stimulus signifies a positive possibility. If the stimulus was evaluated negatively in the first phase, then it is likely that the executed reaction will take the form of escape, fight or immobilization. During the second phase, the organism is primarily occupied by its own actions. It observes their effect and makes adjustments (which forms a feedback loop). Despite the feedback, its connection with reality is less intensive than during the first phase. The separation from reality in the second phase of information metabolism is greater in complex animals and reaches its maximum in humans. ===Functional structures=== The term functional structure was used by Kƒôpi≈Ñski to denote two phenomena. Firstly, the term was used to denote the reaction of an organism to a stimulus. Secondly, it denoted the model of reality generated in the mind in the second phase of the information metabolism. In the case of humans, the number of possible functional structures associated with the first phase of information metabolism is limited. These include, for example, endocrine reactions of the autonomous nervous system and basic locomotor patterns. The range and complexity of functional structures generated in the second phase is much broader. Humans possess the ability to generate many possible models of reality in response to a newly perceived phenomenon. Functional structures can be relatively complex. They include predictions regarding the behavior of objects in the environment as well as the planned sequence of actions of the individual. Typically, multiple functional structures are generated in the second phase of information metabolism, but only one is embodied (executed). The ones that were generated but rejected, gradually fall into the unconscious and form the Jungian shadow. If particular structure is embodied, the probability of its selection in the future increases. Forgotten structures may manifest themselves in the least expected moment. That situation is known as the possession by the Shadow. Kƒôpi≈Ñski mentioned that the embodied reaction is a signal to other organisms. It always takes the form of motion (or lack of it). In case of humans, it may be speech (according to Kƒôpi≈Ñski, speech is the highest form of motion ). ===Emotional coloration=== Emotional coloration manifests in the first phase of information metabolism. It signifies the general attitude of the organism towards the stimulus. This attitude may be either positive or negative. It depends on the nature of the stimulus and on the physical condition of the organism in the moment of perception. The individual has very little conscious control over the feeling that arises. It is selected at lower levels of neurophysiological operation. Selection of an attitude in the first phase (positive or negative) limits the character of functional structures generated in the second phase. Although typically there are many possible ways of reacting, they are limited by the emotional background appearing in the first phase. The reality is not static but it always evolves, even though some regularities and laws may be identified. Due to that, the effort associated with organizing the world adequately to our own needs continues through the whole life. It cannot be ceased because of the second law of thermodynamics. In order to decrease its own entropy and the entropy of its immediate surroundings, the organism must expend energy. This is subjectively experienced as the feeling of difficulty, effort or burden. Integrative effort is inherent to life. This effort is rewarded by positive emotional state ‚Äì the feeling of satisfaction associated with the overcoming of obstacles and advancing towards important goals. By contrast, negative feelings, such as anxiety or fear, signify danger. In case of anxiety, this danger is typically distant in time and space and not known precisely. Fear, on the contrary, signifies close and specified threat to the integrity of the organism. In healthy individuals, the balance between negative and positive emotions is on the side of the positive. They are more willing to engage in the exchange of information with the environment and to undertake tasks associated with the integrative effort. By contrast, depressive patients withdraw from reality, which lowers their rate of information metabolism. In many cases, the predisposition to depression is caused by the lack of warm and friendly maternal environment during childhood. The presence of friendly and safe maternal environment during childhood is crucial for the development of the general positive attitude towards the environment. If the childhood environment is hostile, the attitude of withdrawal is reinforced and becomes automated. ===The problem of authority=== Life may be seen as conflict between two orders ‚Äì the order of the individual and the order of the environment. As a process placed between these two orders, information metabolism becomes the tool for establishing the right balance of authority (\\"I am in control\\" versus \\"I am controlled\\"). In pathological cases, the individual may aim to gain absolute control over their environment, or quite contrarily, to fully submit to some external power (i.e. their partner, a political group etc.). The need for an absolute control cannot be fulfilled, therefore it frequently takes the form of fantasy, which sometimes becomes indistinguishable from reality (e.g. in schizophrenia). Many individuals submit to revolutionary movements, promising a utopian future, and to social ideologies which offer simple answers to complex life problems. They give up their individual responsibility to find relief from the burdens of life. In his reflections on information metabolism, Kƒôpi≈Ñski tried to explain psychological mechanisms which made the atrocities of the Second World War possible. ===The anatomical basis of information metabolism=== It is traditionally assumed that functional structures associated with the subjective experience of emotions and moods (the first phase of information metabolism) are controlled by phylogenetically older parts of the brain (diencephalon and rhinencephalon), while those generated in the second phase of information metabolism, subjectively experienced as thoughts, are associated with the neocortex. ===The mathematical character of information metabolism=== The mathematical character of information metabolism is twofold. Receptors, acting as inputs for the metabolized signals, operate analogically to analog electronic devices. The processing of signals in the remaining part of the nervous system is binary (the response of a neuron may be twofold: null ‚Äì no response, or 1 ‚Äì when the action potential is released). Due to these characteristics, organisms may be considered analogous to digital systems. ==Reception== Kƒôpi≈Ñski's books are regarded as classics of Polish psychiatric and philosophical literature. Because of the interest in his work, his most important books have been reissued several times (recently in 2012-2015 by Wydawictwo Literackie ). Kƒôpi≈Ñski's work was evaluated by the reviewers as insightful, comprehensive and unique. Nevertheless, his concept of information metabolism has been criticized as controversial by some scholars. The controversy was related with the fact that some elements of the theory cannot be verified by the scientific method because it is hard to design appropriate experiments. In response to these objections, psychiatrist Jacek Bomba pointed out that information metabolism was never meant to be a scientific theory, but rather an anthropological model, which accurately integrates the findings of neurophysiology, psychology, social science and medicine. Philosopher Jakub Zawi≈Ça-Nied≈∫wiecki noted that current reading of Kƒôpi≈Ñski has to correct for his work mostly being pre-scientific from before the evidence-based medicine, modern philosophy of the mind and cognitive psychology era. He enlisted two Kƒôpi≈Ñski's propositions that are currently considered incorrect i.e. the proposition that information metabolism has its control center (the homunculus argument) and the view that brain is only used in 30%. Nevertheless, as noted by Zawi≈Ça-Nied≈∫wiecki, these concepts were not central in Kƒôpi≈Ñski's theory and can be safely rejected. He also reminded that Kƒôpi≈Ñski was sceptical about methods that lacked strong scientific basis, e.g. psychoanalysis, and rejected magical thinking in general. During his life, Kƒôpi≈Ñski mentioned that his model of information metabolism is not complete. The work upon it was interrupted by his illness and death. Some researchers took his work and developed their own theories based on it. Kokoszka used the conception of information metabolism as the basis of his model of the states of consciousness. Struzik proposed that information metabolism theory may be used as an extension to Brillouin's negentropy principle of information. Inspired by Kƒôpi≈Ñski's work and Jungian typology, Augustinaviƒçi≈´tƒó proposed her theory of information metabolism in human mind and society, known as Socionics. ==See also== *Autopoiesis *Information *Negentropy *Socionics *What is life?, a 1944 science book ==References== ==External links== *Life Circle, Time and the Self in Antoni Kƒôpi≈Ñski's Conception of Information Metabolism *Description of information metabolism on Wikisocion.net Category:Psychological theories ","title":"Information metabolism"},{"id":"523326","text":"Harrington Lake () is the summer residence and all-season retreat of the Prime Minister of Canada, and also the name of the land which surrounds it. The farm that surrounded most of the lake was the property of Margaret and John Harrington. John could not farm the land and moved to the local town of Iron Sides (now Old Chelsea). The family stayed on the farm for many years and eventually moved to old Ottawa. The property is located near Meech Lake‚Äîwhere the Meech Lake Accord was negotiated in 1987‚Äîapproximately 35 kilometres northwest of Ottawa, in Gatineau Park, amidst the Gatineau Hills in Quebec. The property is not open to the public, but the Mackenzie King Estate, the retreat of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King at Kingsmere, is a tourist attraction located 2 kilometres south in the park. ==Description== Since 1986, the 5.4-hectare (13-acre) property at Harrington Lake has been managed by the National Capital Commission. The property includes four recreational buildings; the land, which formerly consisted of cultivated fields, has reverted to secondary forest. In addition to the main cottage with its fine view over the lake, the Harrington estate includes the following structures: * staff cottage * upper guest cottage * lower guest cottage * boat house and paddleboat dock * long dock (located the northeast of the retreat) The lake itself and the area around it are referred to as Lac Mousseau. The name Harrington is thought to be a misspelling of Hetherington, the name of a family which settled in this area. The French name Mousseau comes from another early settler to the area, Louis Mousseau, who bought property here in 1867. The retreat is accessed by Chemin de Lac Meech with a gatehouse, staffed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Protective Policing Service, at the driveway of the retreat. The Prime Minister's motorcade accesses Harrington Lake from Ottawa via Quebec Autoroute 5. ==History== Several families came in the 19th century to settle the Harrington Lake area, including the Harrington and the Mousseau families. The lake eventually became known as \\"Harrington Lake\\" in English and \\"lac Mousseau\\" in French. The Mousseau family had built a farm on the shores of the lake, which remained in the family for several decades. Since the land was not suitable for farming, the lumber industry replaced it as the primary economic activity. In the early 20th century, two Americans, W. A. Drum and W. L. Donnelly, built a sawmill at Harrington Lake to serve the lumber industry. In the 1920s, Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Macpherson Edwards, a member of a prominent lumbering family in Ottawa, inherited part of the property from his uncle, Senator William Cameron Edwards (who had owned 24 Sussex Drive). He recognized the value of the land for recreation, as well as for lumber. He purchased more land around the lake, expanding his total holdings to some 1,200 hectares (3,000 acres). He also ordered the demolition of the mill buildings at Harrington Lake, and replaced them with a 16-room cottage that was designed in the Colonial Revival style, very common in the 1920s according to the NCC, but with the addition of large fieldstone chimneys. In 1951, the lake and the property (including neighbouring land belonging to William Duncan Herridge and Stanley Healey) were acquired by the King in Right of Canada to build up preserves of natural areas around the capital. In 1959, supporters of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker suggested that he needed a quiet place to go fishing, not too far from Ottawa. Later that year, Harrington Lake was chosen as the site for an official country residence and the buildings were formally designated as a secure residence for Canada‚Äôs prime ministers. During the first prime ministership of Pierre Trudeau, his then-wife, Margaret, added a vegetable garden; according to Kim Campbell's autobiography Time and Chance, the garden still provided the house with fresh produce at the time of that writing. Campbell was the only Prime Minister to have spent her entire term in office residing at Harrington Lake. Initially, Campbell took up residence at Harrington Lake so that her predecessor, Brian Mulroney, could continue to reside at 24 Sussex Drive until renovations on his new private residence in Montreal were completed. Once Mulroney vacated 24 Sussex, Campbell had not finished moving to that address before her party was defeated in the 1993 election. ==See also== * Chequers, the retreat of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom * Camp David, the retreat of the President of the United States * Harpsund ==References== ==External links== * Harrington Lake webpage * Prime minister's lakeside residence undergoing $8.6M renovation Category:Lakes of Outaouais Category:Canadian federal government buildings Category:Official residences in Canada Category:Prime ministerial residences ","title":"Harrington Lake"},{"id":"523329","text":"Corgi Toys (trademark) is the name of a range of die-cast toy vehicles produced by Mettoy Playcraft Ltd. in the United Kingdom. The Mettoy (Metal Toy) company was founded in 1933 by German √©migr√© Philip Ullmann in Northampton, England, where he was later joined by South African-born German Arthur Katz, who had previously worked for Ullmann at his toy company Tipp and Co of Nuremberg. After dabbling for some years in the model car market, they decided to produce a range of diecast toy vehicles as competition to Meccano's Dinky Toys model vehicles, which had dominated the British market for many years. Corgi Toys were introduced in the UK in July 1956 and were manufactured in Swansea, Wales, for 27 years before the company went into liquidation. A management buy-out re-formed the company as Corgi Toys Limited in March 1984. In 1989, the management sold the Corgi brand to Mattel and the factory was retained under the name of Microlink Industries Ltd. In 1995, Corgi regained its independence as a new company, Corgi Classics Limited, and moved to new premises in Leicester. The range was exported worldwide and sold in large numbers. Some of the best known and most popular models were of cars made famous in film and television such as the Batmobile, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and James Bond's Aston Martin DB5 ‚Äì which remains the largest selling toy car ever produced. Although the largest single vehicle type featured in the Corgi Toys range were models of cars from manufacturers around the world, this article sub-divides vehicles into genres, wherever possible, to allow a more detailed look at the variety of models produced by the company. ==Early history== 204 Rover 90 and 205 Riley Pathfinder Mettoy became established in Northampton and within six years of the company's founding, the Northampton factory had 600 employees. A production plant was built at Fforestfach in Swansea, South Wales, to manufacture the new range of Corgi Toys. This provided many new jobs in an area of high unemployment following the scaling down of local coal mining operations. Prior to the introduction of Corgi Toys, Mettoy mainly produced tin plate toys. However, in the early 1950s, they began producing a few products in cast metal. The first was a large scale wind-up racer made with a cast aluminium body and tin plate wheels. The body material was soon changed to die cast zinc and it was refitted with cast wheels and moulded rubber tyres. Other models followed and the product line was given the name \\"Castoys.\\" These were the direct ancestors of Corgi Toys. 305 Triumph TR3 The name 'Corgi Toys' was chosen by Philip Ullmann in honour of the company's new home, taken from the Welsh breed of dog, the Corgi, and the iconic Corgi dog logo branded the new range. The name was short and easy to remember, further aligning the range with their rival Dinky Toys. Corgi Toys also included plastic glazing, which lent the models a greater authenticity, and they carried the advertising slogan \\"the ones with windows\\". The 1956 releases were all familiar British vehicles. Six family saloon cars; Ford Consul (200/200M), Austin A50 Cambridge (201/201M), Morris Cowley (202/202M), Vauxhall Velox (203/203M), Rover 90 (204/204M), Riley Pathfinder (205/205M) and Hillman Husky (206/206M), and two sports cars; Austin-Healey 100 (300) and Triumph TR2 (301). Initially, models were issued both in free-rolling form, and (except the larger commercial vehicles and sports cars with low-slung bodies) with friction drive motors. The Mechanical versions, as they were known, were indicated by an 'M' suffix to the model number and were produced in different colour schemes. They were issued with tougher die-cast bases to support the extra weight of the motor. Mechanical versions did not sell as well as the free-rolling versions, partly due to a significantly higher purchase price, and were phased out in 1960 with Ford Thunderbird (214M) the last of the line. One particular problem that was not anticipated was that it was possible to lubricate the \\"motor\\" using oil through a hole in the base, but the oil tended to splatter around inside and cloud up the windows. The rigid die-case bases which were are originally limited to the \\"M\\" versions were retained and became the standard for Corgi toys. ==Expansion and innovation== 309 Aston Martin DB4 Competition Model British cars dominated the releases at the beginning, reflecting the company's concentration on the home market, but by 1957 new markets were being explored and the first European car to be modelled was the Citro√´n DS19 (210) issued in December of that year. The first American car, the Studebaker Golden Hawk (211/211M), was released in February 1958 and by the early 1960s the Corgi range was being exported widely, finding particular popularity in Europe, Australia, Canada, the United States of America and areas of southeast Asia such as Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong, and gradually more foreign vehicles were included to appeal to these new markets. 241 Ghia L6.4 Models were issued on a monthly basis and the range grew quickly to include vehicles of all types. Gradually the models became more sophisticated with the addition of such features as 'Glidamatic' spring suspension and a detailed interior on the Renault Floride (222) in October 1959, and the fibre-optic style 'Trans-o-Lite' illuminating lights system first seen on the Superior Ambulance on Cadillac Chassis (437) in October 1962. The early type of interior which was known as 'vac-formed', was produced by stretching a thin sheet of acetate over a mould by means of a vacuum, and lasted for three years until being replaced by the crisper, more detailed injection-moulded type first seen in the Thames 'Airborne' caravan (420) in February 1962. The Corgi design team came up with the first model with an opening feature in February 1960, the Aston Martin DB4 (218) which had an opening bonnet. Steerable front wheels, jewelled headlights and rear lights and an opening boot complete with spare wheel were added on the Bentley Continental Sports Saloon (224) in April 1961, and by October 1963 with the release of the Ghia L6.4 (241) new levels of authenticity were reached. This model featured a number of 'firsts' with not only an opening bonnet, but also opening doors and boot, and a detailed interior with a rear view mirror, folding front seats, and even a model corgi dog sitting on the rear parcel shelf. At introduction, the Ghia sold for eight shillings and sixpence, and even at this relatively high price around 1.7 million were sold before being withdrawn in 1969. By contrast, only twenty five examples of the real car were completed!Chrysler's Italianate Diversions, Part Two: the Ghia L6.4 ; retrieved 18 July 2009 from automotivetraveler.com Another popular model was the Jaguar Mark X (#238; 1962-1967) ‚Äî over 1.1 million were sold, and hardly any other model was released in as many colours.238 Corgi Jaguar Mk10 - DiecastGems In 1964, Mettoy introduced a range of smaller scale vehicles called Husky Toys. These retailed at a lower retail price than the larger Corgi Toys, and competed with Matchbox Toys. ==Corgi Classics== In 1964 Corgi diversified into the adult collector market and released a range of highly detailed models of vintage cars called 'Corgi Classics'. Marketed at a higher price point than Lesney's Matchbox 'Models of Yesteryear', they met with mixed success. Initial releases were a 1927 Bentley finished in green (9001) or red (9002), an open 1915 Ford Model T coloured black (9011) and a version finished in blue with the hood raised (9013), a 1910 Daimler 38 finished in red (9021) and a 1911 Renault 12/16 finished in lavender (9031) or pale yellow (9032). Two years later, a 1912 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost coloured silver (9041) was added to the range, which was updated in 1970 to feature American TV stars The Hardy Boys, discussed later in this article. A Ford Model T van in Lyons Tea livery (9014) appeared in the 1967 Corgi catalogue but was never released. The Corgi Classics range had been discontinued by 1969, although the name was later revived for a range of adult collectable models in the 1980s. ==Corgi Major Toys== Following the success of the Dinky Supertoys range of die-cast trucks, Corgi decided to launch a range of heavy commercial vehicles in October 1957 with the release of the Carrimore Car Transporter (1101) featuring a Bedford S-Type tractor unit with full glazing in keeping with the rest of the Corgi range, and the company's first gift set including the Carrimore Car Transporter and four cars (GS1); Austin Cambridge (201), Jaguar 2.4 (208), Austin-Healey (300) and MGA (302) in time for the Christmas market in December 1957. Early models in the new 'Corgi Major' range were issued in sturdy two piece boxes featuring the blue and yellow colour scheme that had recently been adopted across the entire Corgi range, later models in the 1960s using clear fronted packaging in line with the rest of the Corgi Toys range. The Carrimore Low Loader (1100) was the next release in April 1958 which was a low loader trailer attached to the Bedford cab and was followed by the similar Machinery Carrier low loader (1104) in September 1958. In November 1958 the Euclid TC12 Bulldozer (1102) was issued. A large earth mover which was being widely used in the construction of the M1, the UK's first motorway, the Euclid factory was only two miles from Corgi headquarters which allowed easy access to all the data required to produce a very accurate model. April 1959 saw the release of the Bedford Fuel Tanker in the red livery of 'Mobilgas' (1110) and this model was revamped in pale blue and white as the Bedford Milk Tanker (1129) in May 1962, and both were later re-issued with a more modern Bedford TK cab. The Midland Red Motor Express Coach (1120), issued in March 1960, was a model of the latest high speed coach for the motorway age fitted with a turbo-charged engine and capable of 100 mph, and a model of the pioneering SR.N1 hovercraft (1119) was released in June 1960. In November 1962 the new Bedford TK cab unit was also fitted to the existing Carrimore Car Transporter (1105) and was also included in a new Car Transporter Gift Set (GS28) in December 1963 along with four cars; Ford Consul Classic (234), Mercedes-Benz 220 SE (230), Renault Floride (222) and Fiat 2100 (232). The Ecurie Ecosse Racing Transporter (1126) issued in October 1961 was a racing car transporter custom built for the Scottish motor racing team Ecurie Ecosse, with room for three cars and an on-board workshop. The Corgi model featured operational ramps, a sliding door revealing the workshop complete with a miniature lathe, operational steering, and was finished in authentic dark blue. Racing Transporter Set (GS16) was also released in October 1961 featuring the Ecurie Ecosse transporter along with three racing cars; Vanwall (150), BRM (156) and [Lotus XI] (151). The Simon Snorkel Aerial Rescue Truck (1127) was issued in September 1964. This model fire engine was based on a Bedford TK chassis and featured an extendable centre-hinged arm with rescue cradle complete with fire fighter figure holding a die-cast water cannon which could be manoeuvred by means of a rotating base and wheels and gears. The model stayed in the range until being updated with a more modern Dennis cab (1126) in June 1977. 1142 Holmes Wrecker Recovery Vehicle A new cab unit was introduced in September 1965. The Ford H Cab and Detachable Trailer (1137) was an American truck produced by Corgi to appeal to the lucrative US market and featured a forward tilting cab revealing a highly detailed engine, realistic moveable door mirrors and die-cast metal air horns and side ladders. The large box trailer featured sliding side doors, opening rear doors and was finished in the blue and silver 'Express Services' livery. The leap in quality of this model proved that the Major range had entered a new era, and it continued to sell well until 1972. The new Ford cab was used again in April 1966 with a new version of the Carrimore Car Transporter (1138) which had been re-designed to carry up to six Corgi cars, and which also featured in Gift Set 41 along with six cars; Ford Cortina Estate (440), Rover 2000 (252), Hillman Imp (251), Mini Cooper De-Luxe (249), Austin Seven (225) and Mini Cooper Monte Carlo 1966 (321). This gift set was initially only available by mail order but was finally issued in time for Christmas in December 1967. The Holmes Wrecker Recovery Vehicle (1142) issued in May 1967 was also based on the Ford H Series tractor unit, and featured twin boom die-cast recovery cranes with hooks attached to cotton lines that could be extended by winding a pair of spare wheels attached to the sides of the vehicle, and also included were two model mechanics previously seen with the 'Express Services' truck. The American LaFrance Aerial Rescue Truck (1143) was added to the Major range in October 1968 and was a highly detailed model of a tiller/ladder truck (or hook and ladder) from the United States of America. It featured an extendable ladder on a rotating base complete with plastic ladder extensions and model firemen and has recently been re-issued by the modern Corgi company in a number of authentic liveries. The Carrimore Car Transporter Mark IV using the recently introduced Scammell cab was also released in April 1969 and a gift set (GS48) featuring the new transporter and six cars; MGC GT (345), Mini Cooper Monte Carlo 1967 (339), Sunbeam Imp Monte Carlo 1967 (340), Mini Cooper S Magnifique (334), Morris Mini Minor (226) and The Saint's Volvo P1800 (258) soon followed. By October 1970 the Carrimore Car Transporter Mark V (1146) had grown to three decks and Gift Set 20 again featured the transporter complete with six cars now fitted with Whizzwheels; Lancia Fulvia Zagato (372), Marcos 3 Litre (377), MGC GT (378), Ford Capri 3 Litre (311), The Saint's Volvo P1800 (201) and Pontiac Firebird (343). The colour schemes applied to some cars in the Car Transporter Gift Sets were unique to models included in these sets, such as the MGC GT (345) finished in orange, and today are particularly collectable. The Scammell Handyman Ferrymasters Truck (1147) issued in December 1969, proved to be the last new application for the Scammell cab and was finished in the authentic yellow and white livery of the Ferrymasters haulage company. The Major range continued into the 1970s but along with the Corgi Toys range suffered somewhat from the constraints on development budgets that the company was forced to make. The Mercedes-Benz Unimog and snowplough (1150) was released in February 1971 and another American cab unit was introduced in October 1971. The new Mack was coupled with a fuel tanker in the livery of \\"Esso\\" (1152) in October 1971 and a Transcontinental trailer (1100) in November 1971, and fitted with an updated version of the Priestman Cub Shovel now converted to become a crane in October 1972 as the Mack Priestman Crane Truck (1154). 1160 Corgi Major Ford Transcontinental tank truck Gulf from 1976 A new Berliet cab was introduced in May 1974 as the Crane Fruehauf Discharge Dumper (1102), a large articulated aggregate carrier for use on construction sites, and the new cab was also used as the Berliet Wrecker Truck (1144) in March 1975 updating the aforementioned Holmes Wrecker, which had been in the range since 1967. The Pathfinder Airport Crash Truck (1103) released in September 1974 had won the Design Council Engineering Award for its manufacturer Chubb, and the Corgi miniature included an internal water tank allowing water to be squirted through die-cast water cannons by pumping a rubber bulb. Another new cab was introduced in April 1976: The Ford Transcontinental was designed for long range treks across the European continent and was first issued coupled to the fuel tanker previously seen with the earlier Mack cab, also in 'Esso' livery (1157) or \\"Gulf\\" livery (1160), and, later in February 1982, in the livery of \\"Guinness\\" (1169). ==Circus vehicle models== The Chipperfield's Circus Crane Truck (1121) was the first of the highly successful and much sought after range of Chipperfield's Circus vehicles produced by Corgi Toys during the 1960s, and was issued in October 1960. It was based on a large International truck fitted with a metal crane, hook and pulley, and painted in the traditional Chipperfield's Circus livery of red and blue, as were all the models in the range. It was followed by the Circus Animal Cage Trailer (1123) in January 1961 which featured two two-part opening doors revealing a large cage with metal bars. These two models were later packaged together as the Chipperfield's Circus Set (GS12). An updated version of the Karrier Bantam Mobile Butcher Shop was introduced in January 1962 as the Circus Booking Office (426). The window insert of the original depicting joints of meat was replaced with a new one with circus advertising posters. In April 1962 the existing Land Rover 109 model was issued along with a trailer carrying a large cage and a model elephant as Chipperfield's Circus Land Rover and Elephant Cage on Trailer (GS19). The Chipperfield's Circus Vehicles Set (GS23) was issued in September 1962 featuring all the Chipperfield's models released to date, and today this is one of the most desirable gift sets issued by the company. The Chipperfield's Circus Horse Transporter (1130) was released in October 1962 featuring the new Bedford TK tractor unit and an articulated trailer with models of circus horses, and in June 1964 the Bedford TK tractor unit was adapted with a large high-sided open top 'wooden' box as the Giraffe Transporter (503) complete with models of a mother and baby giraffe. The Land Rover, which had been adapted as a 'Vote For Corgi' campaigning vehicle as a tie-in with the 1964 UK General Election, was re-issued in September 1965 in the red and blue colours of Chipperfield's as the Chipperfield's Circus Parade Vehicle (487) with a clown and chimpanzee replacing the political canvassers of the original, and a 'The Circus is Here' banner across the bonnet. The Chipperfield's Circus Menagerie Transporter (1139) which was released in October 1968 featured a new Scammell Handyman cab and a flatbed articulated trailer which carried a load of three clear plastic boxes designed to represent cages, each containing models of lions, bears and tigers. The Chipperfield's Circus Crane and Cage (1144), issued in April 1969, again featured the Scammell tractor unit but modified using the Holmes Wrecker platform with a large crane mounted on a pivoting base to the rear, and included another of the clear plastic animal cages with a model rhinoceros inside. The final model in the Chipperfield's Circus range was released in January 1970. The Chipperfield's Performing Poodles Pick Up (511) was an update of the earlier Kennel Club Wagon (itself an adaptation of the Chevrolet Impala first issued in 1960) and included model poodles and trainer. There were no further circus related releases until the Jean Richard Circus Set (GS48) which was issued in November 1978. This large set included models of the new 1/36 scale Land Rover Estate and Chevrolet Van which had been updated to become a parade vehicle and mobile booking office respectively. Also included were an animal cage trailer and models of horses and an elephant and figures of a clown and a ringmaster, together with various Big Top accessories. Another circus themed release was the Berliet tractor unit which had been adapted to become a human cannonball launcher complete with die-cast cannon attached to the rear and a human cannonball figure that could be fired from the cannon by means of depressing a button. ==Competition models== Lotus XI Throughout the company's history, Corgi Toys have been closely associated with modelling Grand Prix and Formula 1 racing cars. The first issued was the Vanwall Grand Prix car (150) issued in July 1957. Finished in green and carrying racing number 3, it was a scale model of the car driven by Stirling Moss. This was followed in December 1958 by a BRM Grand Prix car (106) also with green paintwork, and both cars featured in the Racing Car Set (GS5) from 1958, along with the Lotus XI Le Mans racing car (151) from July 1958. The Vanwall, however, had been re-coloured red. It was followed in December 1964 by the Lotus-Climax F1 car (155). Finished in an authentic British Racing Green and carrying racing number 1, it represented Jim Clark's 1963 world championship winning Lotus 25, and in 1967 it was joined by the Cooper- Maserati F1 car (156) painted blue. The Lotus-Climax and the Cooper-Maserati were re-engineered in 1969 to include steerable front wheels operated by moving the driver from side to side, and a high level rear wing in the style of real Formula 1 cars of the time. They were re-coloured orange in the case of the Lotus-Climax (158) and yellow in the case of the Cooper-Maserati (159). A Lotus Racing Car set (GS37) was issued in August 1966 containing the Lotus- Climax F1 car, two Lotus Elans and a Volkswagen breakdown tow truck. Another Ferrari was issued in February 1965, the Ferrari Berlinetta (314) (Ferrari 250 LM) which had competed at the 1964 Le Mans 24 Hour race, and in May 1967 another successful sports racer, the Porsche Carrera 6 (330) (Porsche 906), was released. In 1972 Corgi worked with the newly formed Grand Prix Association to produce a series of 1/36 scale Formula 1 racing cars. The first was the Yardley McLaren M19A (151) driven by New Zealander and 1967 World Champion Denny Hulme which was followed by the Brooke Bond Oxo Surtees TS9 driven by 1964 World Champion John Surtees (150), later followed by a Surtees TS9B in the livery of Italian sponsors 'Pagnossin', driven by Andrea de Adamich (153). These were the first models produced in the larger 1/36 scale instead of the familiar O scale preferred by Dinky and Corgi up to this date (varying between 1/43 to about 1/50 for larger vehicles). Within the following five years virtually the complete Corgi range would be replaced by vehicles in 1/36 scale, much to the dismay of adult collectors. 1973 saw the release of Jacky Ickx's Ferrari 312 B2 (152) and the John Player Special Lotus 72 (154) of World Champion (1972 and 1974) Emerson Fittipaldi or Ronnie Peterson, and in 1974 the Shadow F1 car was issued in both UOP livery (155) as driven by Jackie Oliver, and as Graham Hill's Embassy Shadow (156). Scottish multiple World Champion Jackie Stewart's Elf Tyrrell F1 car (158) was also released along with the STP Patrick Eagle (159) driven to victory in the 1973 Indianapolis 500 by Gordon Johncock. The final two models in the series were the Hesketh 308 F1 car (190) driven by the then becoming English World Champion James Hunt issued in 1976, and the six wheeled Tyrrell Project 34 driven by Frenchman Patrick Depailler issued in Elf livery (161) in 1977 and First National City Travellers Checks livery (162) which was released in 1978. Two Formula 1 cars were also issued in 1/18 scale, the John Player Special Lotus 72 (190) in 1974 and the Marlboro McLaren (191) in 1975. The Proteus- Campbell Bluebird Record Car (153) was issued in September 1960 and was modelled on the vehicle with which Donald Campbell was to set a new Land Speed Record on 17 July 1964. The Corgi design team were given extensive access to the real car in order to produce their scale model, even receiving paint samples to enable them to create an exact colour match. However, a lighter blue was chosen for the model eventually. An example of the model was presented to Donald Campbell by young members of the Corgi Club. 475 Citroen DS Safari 1964 Winter Olympics & 499 Citroen DS Safari 1968 Grenoble Olympics Models following themes were released over the years. In January 1964, Corgi updated the existing Citro√´n DS Safari to become a promotional vehicle for the 1964 Winter Olympics (475), complete with a skier figure, four model skis and two model ski poles. Painted white and with a decal of the Olympic rings logo on the bonnet, this model then reverted to a 'Corgi Ski Club' version the following year. It was revamped again in November 1967 for the 1968 Winter Olympics (499), this time painted white with a blue roof, and with a model toboggan on the roof rack along with a figure of a tobogganist and a pair of skis and poles, and a stylish 'Grenoble Olympiade 1968' decal on the bonnet. The final version introduced in 1970 was an Alpine Rescue vehicle (510), painted white with a red roof and which came complete with figures of a St Bernard dog and rescuer, and today is the rarest of the versions. 340 Sunbeam Imp 1967 Monte Carlo Rally, 322 Rover 2000 1965 Monte Carlo Rally, 339 Mini Cooper S 1967 Monte Carlo Rally The Monte Carlo Rally, held annually in January, provided a rich source of model cars between 1964 and 1967. By following the event closely, Corgi Toys were able to issue a model of the winning car shortly after the end of the rally Often there was not even enough time to produce a unique box for the new model, which had to make do with a hastily produced sticker applied to a standard issue box for a similar model. The 1964 winner, Paddy Hopkirk's Mini Cooper S (317) released in February 1964, featured jewelled headlights and a rally lamp on the roof, and was finished in the BMC team colours of red with a white roof with authentic Monte Carlo Rally transfers. Three Monte Carlo Rally cars were issued in 1965, the winning Mini Cooper S of Timo M√§kinen (321) in February, finished in the same red with a white roof, and three jewelled rally lamps, and in April a Rover 2000 (322) in maroon with a white roof with two jewelled rally lamps in the grill and a Citro√´n DS21 (323) with four small jewelled rally lamps and finished in pale blue with a white roof complete with roof aerial. All three of these models were available in the Monte Carlo Gift Set (GS38) also issued in April 1965; a highly prized set for today's collector. Another Mini Cooper S in Monte Carlo Rally finish was issued the January of following year complete with two jewelled rally lamps in the grille and the signatures of the driver Timo M√§kinen and his co-driver Paul Easter printed on the roof. The model number 321 was carried over from the 1965 car. A Hillman Imp was also issued as a Monte Carlo Rally car (328), finished in blue with a white flash along the sides and two jewelled rally lamps, and was driven by an all-female team of Rosemary Smith and Valerie Domleo in the 1966 event. 1967 was the final year that Corgi issued Monte Carlo Rally cars, and the famous Mini Cooper S (339) appeared yet again in March, this time with four jewelled rally lamps in the grill, a sump guard and two spare wheels on a roof rack borrowed from the 'Surfing' Mini Traveller (485) from 1965. The 1967 Monte Carlo Rally Mini Cooper S stayed in the Corgi range until 1972, spanning two different castings. Another Mini Cooper S (333) was released in February 1967 carrying the same red and white paintwork, but as campaigned in the 1967 RAC/Sun rally by Tony Fall and Mike Wood, along with another Rover 2000 (322) from the same event finished in white with a matt black bonnet. The final rally car was the Sunbeam Imp (340) issued in March 1967, which featured four jewelled rally lamps and was finished in blue with a white flash and front panel. In December 1965 a Volkswagen 1200 Beetle was issued in East African Safari finish (256). This model featured an opening boot and engine cover and steerable front wheels operated by a spare tyre on the roof of the car. Three years later, in July 1969, Corgi issued the winning Hillman Hunter from the 1968 London to Sydney Marathon (302), complete with Take-Off Wheels, roof mounted tool box and a plastic kangaroo guard across the front of the car. This time the packaging included a model kangaroo and details of the event, and in February 1970 a model of the unique 4wd Ford Capri 3-Litre rally car (303) driven by Roger Clark was released. A model of the successful Datsun 240Z rally car in East African Safari Finish (394) was issued in October 1972 and in May 1973 the Datsun 240Z was also issued in \\"US Rally\\" finish (396). This, in fact, was an authentic model of John Morton's 300 bhp BRE-Datsun 240Z which won the 1970 and 1971 SCCA class C/P championships. The Ferrari 365GTB/4 Daytona as raced at the 1973 Le Mans 24 Hours race, with JCB and Corgi sponsorship (324), was released in June 1973 along with another in white/red/blue livery inspired by a 1972 Le Mans entry (323). In July 1973 the Porsche-Audi 917/10 (397) from the Can-Am race series was issued with L&M; cigarette sponsorship. In the early 1970s Corgi Toys issued a range of dragsters in response not only to the increased interest in this form of motorsport in the UK, focused on the Santa Pod Raceway in Northamptonshire, but also the attention brought to these vehicles by Mattel's Hot Wheels. The first to be released was the 'Quartermaster' Dragster (162) in April 1971, closely followed by the 'Commuter' Dragster (161) in June. Both were models of real vehicles, and were of the 'rail' dragster variety. The first 'Funny Car' dragster was the Santa Pod \\"Gloworm\\" Dragster (163) issued in July 1971, and which was based on the existing Ford Capri 3-Litre casting. Modifications allowed the body to be hinged from the rear, and by pressing a button secreted in the front bumper the entire body rose, by means of a spring, to reveal a roll cage and driver within and a detailed V8 engine. The next release was a figment of the Corgi design team's imagination. The \\"Organ Grinder\\" Mustang Funny Car (166), which was issued in October 1971, was purely an update of the Ford Mustang (320) first seen in 1965, complete with huge rear wheels and headers resembling organ pipes fitted to the V8 engine. In December 1971 the Ison Brothers \\"Wild Honey\\" Dragster (164) was released which was a fully customised 'gasser' based on a 1930s Austin Seven saloon. The Adams Brothers \\"Drag-Star\\" (165) released in February 1972 was a four engined machine produced in conjunction with designers the Adams Brothers, and the earlier \\"Quartermaster\\" Dragster was updated in October 1972 as the John Woolfe Radio Luxembourg 208 Dragster (170). ==Film and television models1960s=== Corgi Toys introduced the first of the many film and television tie-in models that made the company famous in March 1965, with The Saint's Volvo P1800 (258) from the British television series The Saint starring Roger Moore. This was an update of the existing Volvo P1800 model that had been issued in 1962, now finished in white and featuring The Saint's logo on the bonnet and a model of The Saint in the drivers seat. The Corgi executives were impressed by how The Saint version sold in much larger numbers than the regular version, despite the fact that on the TV there was no Saint's logo on the car. With the second in the range of film and TV related models Corgi revolutionised the British toy car industry. 270 James Bond Aston Martin DB5, second issue from 1968 produced by Corgi Toys as a tie-in to the film \\"Goldfinger\\" The most famous and best selling (to date) toy car of all, James Bond's Aston Martin DB5 (261) from the film Goldfinger, was issued in October 1965. Despite the fact that the casting of the new James Bond car was based heavily on the earlier Aston Martin DB4 model from 1960, it was the special features marked out this model. There were machine guns in the front wings which popped out at the touch of a button, a bulletproof shield which popped up to protect the rear screen when the exhaust pipes were pressed, and an ejector seat which fired through a roof panel which opened by the touch of another button. The model was released in time for the 1965 Christmas market and the Corgi factory found it was unable to keep up with demand, leading to coverage in the British press of stories of toy shop shelves being cleared of this new must-have toy in minutes. The model remains in production to this day in an updated form and has gone on to sell more than seven million examples in all its various versions. The \\"Thrushbuster\\" (497) was an update of an existing Oldsmobile Super 88 casting dating back to 1961, but now with models of the stars of the television series The Man from U.N.C.L.E., agents Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin, firing guns out of the windows. The two figures popped in and out of the car windows by pressing down on a model periscope protruding through the roof. Like in the case of The Saint, this owed little to realism - on the TV show the two heroes would certainly not advertize their affiliation with the logo on the bonnet. 267 Later issue of the Batmobile featuring Whizzwheels The Christmas market was again dominated by a Corgi toy car; this time the Batmobile (267) released in October 1966. This was a George Barris customised 1955 Lincoln Futura concept car bought by Barris as a wreck from Ford Motor Company (reputedly for one dollar) and which featured heavily in the American television series Batman. In June 1967 GS3 was issued consisting of The Batmobile towing a Batboat on a trailer, and another James Bond car soon followed ‚Äì the Toyota 2000GT (336) issued in October 1967 from the film You Only Live Twice, which fired rockets from the boot. The previously issued 1927 Bentley was updated for a second time to tie in with the BBC television series The World of Wooster (9004) which starred Ian Carmichael and featured figures of Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves at the wheel. It was the only film and television related model issued as part of the Corgi Classics range and did not sell well. The final film and television related model for 1967 was issued in November. The crime fighting car Black Beauty (268) - a George Barris customised 1965 Imperial Crown sedan, included an operational satellite launcher inside the boot and a rocket fired from behind the grill, and was featured in the American television series The Green Hornet. Although the series was not screened in the UK until years later, the model proved to be very popular and it went on to sell over two million examples. A new casting of the James Bond Aston Martin DB5 (270) was released in February 1968, this time featuring the correct DB5 taillights (instead of the DB4 taillight clusters on the 261) and authentic silver paintwork. The original had been painted gold after the Corgi design team decided that silver painted pre-production models looked as if the metal bodies were unpainted. The new model now featured tyre slashers and revolving number plates whilst retaining all the features of the original, and early examples packaged in a short lived bubble-pack are even more valuable today than the earlier 1965 release. November 1968 saw the release of the flying car Chitty Chitty Bang Bang'(266) from the successful film of the same name that had been in cinemas throughout that summer, and which featured plastic wings that popped out from the car's side skirts when the hand brake was pushed and detailed miniatures of the car's inventor Caractacus Potts, Truly Scrumptious and the children Jeremy and Jemima. The Monkeemobile (277) issued in December was a model of the Dean Jeffries customised 1966 Pontiac GTO that featured in the American television series The Monkees. It included miniatures of band members Davy Jones, Mickey Dolenz, Peter Tork and Mike Nesmith sitting in the car. 277 Monkeemobile Film and television related models continued to be issued in February 1969 with the Yellow Submarine (803) from the animated Beatles film of the same name. This model featured two hatches that lifted at the touch of buttons on the side of the craft to allow models of the Fab Four John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr to pop into view. Early examples featured a white hatch to the front and a yellow hatch to the rear in keeping with the colour scheme of the original, before both hatches were coloured red on later models. The Yellow Submarine commands high prices today amongst both die-cast collectors and Beatles related collectors too. Corgi Toys not only produced models of automotive stars of film and television, but also models of production vehicles. A newly tooled Commer 2500 mini bus body was used for the Samuelson Mobile Camera Van (479) issued in December 1967 which included a detailed cast metal model of a Panavision film camera and plastic cameraman on a metal plinth that could be either attached to the vehicle's roof rack or to the front or rear of the van for tracking shots. The lens of the camera was represented by a tiny jewel. In September 1968 the Renault 16 Tour De France Paramount Film Unit (GS13) was released. This gift set featured a Renault 16 car with the tailgate removed and a platform extension fixed at the rear to accommodate the Panavision film camera model and cameraman. Also included was a miniature racing cycle and cyclist. ===1970s=== The releases of film and television related models continued into the seventies, and included more James Bond models. In June 1970, the 1912 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost from the Corgi Classics range was reissued, but updated with psychedelic paintwork and featuring figures of the group from the animated series The Hardy Boys, another American television show which was unknown in Britain. This time the model failed to sell, making it extremely rare today. A Ford Mustang Mach 1 (391) and the \\"Moon Buggy\\" (802) from the film Diamonds Are Forever were issued in 1972, and the Lotus Esprit (269) in 'underwater' mode from The Spy Who Loved Me in 1977. A rocket- firing 'Stromberg' Bell JetRanger helicopter (926) from the same film was added in 1978. The Space Shuttle (649) from the Bond movie Moonraker appeared in 1979 along with a 'Drax' JetRanger helicopter (930) from the same film. A Citro√´n 2CV which James Bond drove in the film For Your Eyes Only was issued in 1981. As the decade progressed some of the film and television related models became less authentic due to the lack of expensive licensing deals, and more a product of the imagination of the Corgi design team. In 1973 'Dick Dastardly's' Car (809) was issued featuring models of the characters 'Dick Dastardly' and his sidekick 'Muttley' from the children's television program Wacky Races. However, this Corgi offering was a toy-like race car from the 'Qualitoys' range, and was a far cry from the famous \\"00-zero\\" car that 'Dick Dastardly' drove in the cartoon series. In 1978 the \\"U.S. Racing Buggy\\" (167) was reissued as 'The Penguinmobile', themed around Batman's arch-enemy The Penguin, complete with an umbrella. (259). A 'Batbike' was released in 1978 featuring a figure of 'Batman' sitting astride a modified motorbike which fired two rockets, along with a series of vehicles that were issued as the result of obtaining the Marvel Comics license. They were themed around Spider- Man, Captain America, Captain Marvel and The Incredible Hulk. These included a 'Spidervan' (436); a suitably decorated Chevrolet van, which had also been issued the previous year as a tie-in with the American television series Charlie's Angels (434), a \\"Daily Planet\\" JetRanger helicopter (929), a \\"Spiderbuggy\\" (261); a Jeep CJ-5 with a model of 'Spider-Man's' archenemy \\"The Green Goblin\\" trapped in a web styled plastic bag dangling from a crane fitted at the back of the vehicle, a \\"Spidercopter\\" (928) and a \\"Spiderbike\\" (266). A similar treatment was also given to other Marvel characters including a \\"Captain America\\" Jetmobile (263), a 'Captain Marvel' Porsche 917/10 Can-Am racer (262) and an 'Incredible Hulk' Mazda pick-up (264) which featured a caged model of the 'Hulk' on the flatbed of the truck. A \\"Superman\\" gift set (GS21) was released featuring a 'Supermobile', the 'Daily Planet' helicopter and a Buick Regal police car, as well as a \\"Spider-Man\\" gift set (GS23) consisting of the \\"Spiderbuggy\\", the \\"Spidercopter\\" and the \\"Spidervan\\". Many of these later film and television related releases were not models of authentic vehicles as were the earlier issues from the 1960s, but merely existing models updated to take advantage of recently acquired licensing deals. In May 1978 a new version of the James Bond Aston Martin DB5 (271) was issued in 1/36 scale which featured the operational gimmicks of the 1965 original. This model appears in the Corgi range to the present day. In October 1978 The Saint's Jaguar XJS (320) was issued. This was a model of the latest Jaguar coupe as driven by Ian Ogilvy in the ATV television series The Return of the Saint and, again, was painted white and featured The Saint logo on the bonnet. In 1980, the 'Buck Rogers' Starfighter (647), from the series Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, was released, including figures of 'Colonel Wilma Deering' and robot 'Twiki'. A series of models featuring characters from Jim Henson's The Muppet Show were also issued in 1980. These included \\"Kermit's\\" car (2030), \\"Fozzie Bear's truck\\" (2031), \\"Miss Piggy's Sports Coupe\\" (2032) and \\"Animal's Percussionmobile\\" (2033). By the mid-1970s some of the most popular series shown on British television were American police dramas, and Corgi decided to model several of the vehicles featured in these shows. In 1976 the Buick Regal (296) from the series Kojak was issued, complete with figures of 'Lieutenant Kojak' and 'Detective Crocker' shooting from the rear seat, and a year later the Ford Gran Torino from Starsky & Hutch (292) was released also with figures of \\"David Starsky\\", \\"Ken Hutchinson\\", and a \\"suspect\\". In 1980, a silver Ford Capri 3.0 S (342) was issued as a tie-in with the popular British television crime drama The Professionals featuring models of 'Bodie', 'Doyle' and 'Cowley', as well as a 1957 Ford Thunderbird (348) from the American show Vega$ with 'Dan Tanna' at the wheel. 1982 saw the release of the Magnum, P.I. Ferrari 308 GTS (298). Cost-cutting at the time dictated that no figure was included. == Emergency vehicle models == The first emergency vehicles produced by Corgi Toys were issued as part of the launch range in July 1956, and were based on the Bedford Utilicon light commercial. It was issued in red as a 'Fire Dept' vehicle (405M) and in green as an 'Army Fire Service' vehicle (405), both with a tin plate ladder attached to the roof of the vehicle. These were followed in June 1958 by the company's first police vehicle; a Riley Pathfinder patrol car (209), finished in black and with a die cast police sign fitted to the roof complete with siren and bell. In January 1959 a Jaguar 2.4 Fire Chief car (213) was added to the range, finished in red and with a nylon aerial, crest transfers on the front doors and the same cast sign as the Pathfinder but modified to read 'Fire Chief'. The first American emergency vehicle to be produced by Corgi Toys was the Chevrolet Impala State Patrol car (223) introduced in December 1959. It was painted black and featured a nylon aerial and 'State Patrol' stickers on the vehicle's front doors. An updated version finished in black and white was issued in 1965. By 1959 the M1, the UK's first motorway, had opened to the public and this prompted the introduction of a new breed of powerful police vehicle able to carry a large payload. The Ford Zodiac Motorway Patrol Car (419) was introduced in August 1960 and was finished in white with a plastic aerial fitted to the front wing, a blue light attached to the roof, a 'Police' decal on the bonnet and a vac-formed interior detailing rescue equipment in the luggage compartment and in June 1962 the Oldsmobile Super 88 County Sheriff car (237) was added to the range. Painted black and white it featured a red light fitted to the roof and 'County Sheriff' stickers on the doors. This model became the company's first million seller. The Superior Ambulance on Cadillac Chassis (437) introduced in October 1962 was from the latest generation of models and featured red and white paintwork, a working battery operated flashing light on the roof and four trans-o-lite fibre optic lights in each corner of the roof that flashed in unison with the main bulb. This model was re-issued in blue and white in 1966. In January 1963 the existing Chevrolet Impala was introduced as a Fire Chief car (439), painted red with a light on the roof, crests decals on the doors and a 'Fire Chief' transfer on the bonnet, and was also updated with a red and white finish in 1966. In June 1963 the Commer Police Van (464) was released, painted blue with a battery operated flashing light on the roof, barred side windows and 'County Police' transfers along the sides, and this model was also updated in 1967. An ambulance version (463) painted white was issued in February 1964. In October 1964 a Police Dog Handler Mini van (450) was introduced painted dark blue with 'Police' in white letters on the sides, a nylon aerial fitted to the front wing and came with models of the police dog handler and police Alsatian dog. The Volkswagen European Police Car (492) issued in May 1966 was finished in the green and white of the German police force, and carried 'Polizei' transfers on the doors. It featured steerable front wheels operated by the blue metal 'light' on the roof and two policemen sitting inside the vehicle, not to mention opening boot and rear engine cover. Another rear engined police car was introduced in May 1968, the Sunbeam Imp 'Panda' car (506). It was painted black and white initially but this colour scheme was soon changed to authentic 'Panda' car colours of pale blue with a white vertical centre section. 437 Superior Ambulance on Cadillac Chassis (second issue) In June 1970 a Porsche 911 Targa 'Polizei' car (509) fitted with Whizzwheels was released. It featured a colour scheme of white and red and was fitted with a blue light on an extension next to the door and a die-cast loud hailer on the engine cover. A rare Dutch issue of the model featured dayglo orange and white paintwork and the correct 'Rijkspolitie' livery as featured on the real vehicle. The Fire Bug (395) appeared in December 1971, and was based on a GP Beach Buggy fitted with fire fighting equipment. British police vehicles were well represented with the Police 'Vigilant' Range Rover (461) released in January 1972 and the Ford Cortina Police Car (402) released in August of the same year. Both models were finished in the contemporary white with red/blue side stripes, which would have been familiar to many motorists at the time. The Range Rover came complete with a model policeman and emergency road signs, while the Cortina was also released with 'Polizei' labels on the otherwise unchanged British car as an export model for the German-speaking countries. The remaining years that the company was in existence saw police cars based on such subjects as a Porsche 924 (430) and a Renault 5 (428), both in the white and black livery of the French Police nationale, a Mercedes 240D (412) and the Porsche 924 (430) in white and green of the German 'Polizei', and a blue Buick Regal (416) which had previously seen service as 'Kojak's' car. There was also a Metropolitan Police Land Rover and Horse box (GS44) complete with a model Police horse and rider, which was also available in Royal Canadian Mounted Police finish (GS45). 1982 the Ford Escort was released as a blue and white Police 'Panda' car (297). Ambulances were issued based on the Range Rover 'Vigilant' (482), a Mercedes-Benz W123 'Bonna' (406) in four different liveries for Scandinavian and German-speaking countries, and a Chevrolet Superior Ambulance (405). There appears, however, to have been a lack of fire fighting machinery released in this time, although the American LaFrance ladder truck and Simon Snorkel were still available along with the modern Chubb Pathfinder airport crash tender. Two models from this era do warrant attention. Riot Police Truck (422) released in September 1977 was a squat armoured military vehicle painted white and red with twin water cannons fitted to the rear, and perhaps reflected the turbulent times in Britain towards the end of the 1970s, and the Jaguar XJ12 Coupe which was released in December 1975 finished in the white and pale blue livery of the Coastguard (414), complete with die-cast light and twin foghorns on the roof. The model was updated as a police vehicle (429) in February 1978. In 1980 the first of the later 'Corgitronics' range was introduced: the HCB-Angus Firestreak (1001) with battery-operated siren and flashing red lights, complete with two figures in silver protective clothing. ==Commercial vehicles models== The first light commercial modelled by Corgi Toys was the Bedford CA van in Daily Express livery (403) and in 'KLG Plugs' livery (403M) which was part of the July 1956 range that launched the brand. The CA van was later released in the yellow and black livery of AA Services in May 1957 (408), in the black and silver livery of the Evening Standard (421) in June 1960 and in the yellow and blue livery of Corgi Toys (422) in October 1960. The first large commercial vehicles in the Corgi Toys range were the Commer Dropside lorry (452) and the Commer Refrigerated van finished the livery of Walls Ice Cream (453). The same large van body was used on the ERF 88G chassis to become the Moorhouses Van (459) in March 1958. Painted red and yellow it featured paper stickers on the sides advertising Moorhouses Lemon Cheese and Raspberry jam.452 Commer Dropside Lorry (1956-1963). The Karrier Bantam Lucozade Van (411) was introduced in August 1958 and featured a sliding plastic door, yellow paintwork and adverts for Lucozade energy drink on the side. This model was updated in May 1962 to become the Dairy Produce Van (435) now painted pale blue and white and with a 'Drive Safely on Milk' advert on the side. A Volkswagen van (433) was introduced in December 1962 finished in two tone red and white along with the Volkswagen Kombi (434) which was finished in green and white paintwork. A rare promotional version of the van was produced for the Dutch department store Vroom & Dreesman. In February 1963 the basic Volkswagen van was updated with Trans-o-lite headlamps as the Volkswagen Toblerone van (441). It was painted pale blue and finished with transfers along the sides advertising Toblerone chocolate bars. In March 1964 a Volkswagen Pick Up (432) was introduced to the range which came complete with a plastic canopy, and in December 1966 the pick up was converted to become the Volkswagen Breakdown Truck (490). In 1963 Corgi introduced the Commer Constructor Set (GS 24), which consisted of two Commer FC van chassis units and four different rear bodies ‚Äì an ambulance, milk float, panel van and pick-up. It proved very popular and remained in production until 1968. These models were also available separately as part of the normal Corgi range. The Commer Holiday Camp Special bus (508) issued in August 1968 was based on the earlier Samuelson Commer Film Unit bus, and featured bright orange and white paintwork with a decal fixed on one side on the vehicle, together with a plastic representation of luggage under cover on the roof rack. The 'Mister Softee' Ice Cream Van (428) was introduced in March 1962 and was based on a Commer BF 1 ton van and which featured a plastic knob on the underside that allowed the ice cream salesman inside to be rotated. It also featured a sliding side window. In 1965 a Thames Wall's Ice Cream Van (447) was introduced. This was a smaller vehicle based on the Thames 5 cwt van, a commercial version of the Ford Anglia, and the bodywork featured a pointed roof design and a sliding side window. The model also came with a sheet of stickers which could be applied and also included were models of an ice cream vendor and small boy. An alternative version (474) with musical chimes operated by a handle protruding from the back of the model was introduced a year later, but without the plastic figures. A Karrier Bantam- based Mobile Butchers Shop (413) was released in October 1960 and was later updated to become a Chipperfield's Circus Booking Office (426) in January 1962 and with the addition of an opening side hatch, a detailed kitchen interior and revolving chef it was re-issued in March 1965 as Joe's Diner Mobile Canteen (471). An export version to be sold in Belgium featured 'Patates Frites' stickers on the side in place of the usual 'Joe's Diner'. There were no further additions to the commercial vehicle range until June 1979 with the Chevrolet van, first seen the previous year, issued in the livery of Coca-Cola (437). A Ford Transit Wrecker (1140) in the livery of 'Corgi 24 Hour Service' was issued in March 1981 followed by the Ford Transit Milk float (405) in February 1982 which carried the period slogan \\"Milk's Gotta Lotta Bottle\\". ==Agricultural vehicle models== A variety of farming vehicles formed part of the Corgi Toys range for the majority of the company's existence under Mettoy's ownership. These models were popular with children from rural areas and today are considered highly collectable. The range was introduced in June 1959 with the Massey Ferguson 65 tractor (50) finished in the manufacturer's familiar red and white colours. An accompanying Massey Ferguson trailer (51) was introduced at the same time, and in April 1960 an operational shovel was added to the tractor as the Massey Ferguson 65 Tractor Shovel (53). The scoop could either be raised or lowered by means of one of two levers and could be tipped by means of the second lever. Both the tractor and trailer were available together as GS 7. The Massey Ferguson combine harvester (1111) was released in August 1959 as part of the Corgi Major range, which featured blades that rotated as the model was pushed along. 64 Working Conveyor on Forward Control Jeep FC-150, complete with farmhand figure and 7 sacks (1965-1969). A new tractor was introduced in May 1961. The Fordson Power Major Tractor (56) featured steering operated by the steering wheel and was finished in Ford's traditional blue. A plough that could be attached to the tractor (57) was issued at the same time, and the two were available together as GS18. A half track version of the Fordson was available in March 1962 as the Fordson Power Major with Roadless Half Tracks (54). The first Agricultural Gift Set (GS22) was released in September 1962 and included the combine harvester, the Fordson and Massey Ferguson tractors with a fork replacing the shovel on the Massey Ferguson for this gift set only. Also included in the set were two trailers and an example of the existing Land Rover. The Fordson Power Major Tractor was issued with a new Beast Carrier Trailer, carrying a load of four plastic calves, as GS33 in March 1965 and the Working Conveyor on F.C.Jeep (64) was released in June 1965. This was an update of the Forward Control Jeep first issued in 1959 with a new casting of a working conveyor belt assembly fitted to the flat bed and accompanied by plastic model grain sacks and farmer. The first new tractor for five years was issued in July 1966. The Massey Ferguson 165 (66) featured steering and an 'engine sound' as the model was pushed along and was finished in red and white. The conveyor belt first seen with the F.C. Jeep was updated with a trailer chassis and coupled to a second new tractor in GS47 issued in September 1966. The Ford 5000 Super Major was finished in blue and came complete with operational steering and jewelled headlights. The new Ford tractor was coupled to a Beast Carrier trailer for GS1 released in December 1966 which became the first Corgi release in the new style cellophane window box which defined the company's packaging for the future. The Dodge Kew Fargo Livestock Transporter (484) was issued in April 1967. This was a large animal transporter based on an American Dodge truck which featured an opening bonnet and carried a cargo of plastic pigs. The Tandem Disc Harrow Plough Trailer (71) was released in July 1967 and an updated Agricultural Gift Set (GS5) in October 1967, which featured some of the more recent releases such as the Dodge Kew Fargo and the Massey Ferguson 165 tractor with scoop. In March 1970 the Massey Ferguson 165 Tractor With Saw Attachment (73) was issued featuring a clever circular saw attachment which rotated as the model was pushed along by means of a long finely coiled spring. Next followed two versions of the Ford 5000 Super Major tractor with a fully operational side trenching scoop (74) in 1970 followed by a version with a rear trenching scoop (72) in January 1971. The next new tractor model was issued in April 1973. The Massey Ferguson MF50B (50) featured a closed cab and was finished in yellow. A version with an operational shovel (54) was released in April 1974 and was featured with a trailer carrying a load of plastic 'hay' with figures sitting atop the 'hay' as the latest version of the Agricultural Gift Set (GS4) in July 1974. Another new tractor was added to the range in September 1976. The David Brown Tractor and Trailer Set (GS34) included the new tractor finished in white and with a closed cab and a tipping trailer. These models were also featured in another version of the Agricultural Gift Set (GS42) released in March 1978, along with models of a grain elevator and grain silo. At the same time the David Brown tractor was issued with a Danish JF combine harvester attachment (1112). == Military vehicle models == Corgi Toys produced a sizeable range of military vehicles during the 1950s and early 1960s, and they proved very popular. The Thunderbird Guided Missile and Trailer (350) was issued in May 1958 followed by the Bloodhound Guided Missile and Launch Pad (1108) in October 1958. In June 1959 the Corporal Guided Missile on Launch Pad was issued, which was later featured coupled to a mobile transporter as Corporal Erector Vehicle and Missile (1113) released in October 1959. RAF vehicles included RAF Land Rover (351) issued in May 1958, which was included in Gift Set 4 along with the Bloodhound Guided Missile, and Standard Vanguard RAF Staff Car (352) which was issued in October 1958. The Decca Mobile Airfield Radar Van (1106) released in January 1959 featured a radar scanner which revolved remotely by means of a serrated wheel, and the Bedford Military Ambulance (414) was issued in January 1961. In January 1965, in response to a request from the company's American agent, a range of vehicles was produced in the matt green with white star livery of the US Army. These included Commer Military Ambulance (354), Commer Military Police Van (355), Volkswagen Military Personnel Carrier (356), Land Rover Weapons Carrier (357), Oldsmobile HQ Staff Car (358), Army Field Kitchen (359), International Troop Transporter (1113), Bedford Army Fuel Tanker (1134) and Heavy Equipment Transporter (1135). All were updates of existing models from both the standard Corgi range and the Corgi Major range, and sold disappointingly leading to their withdrawal at the end of 1966. This line featured in Corgi catalogues for 1965 & 66\\\\. There were no further military vehicles produced until the 1970s. A range of tanks was introduced in November 1973 with the German Tiger Tank Mk I (900) and the British Centurion Tank Mk III (901). It was expanded in 1974 with the releases of U.S. M60A1 Tank (902), the British Chieftain Tank (903), German King Tiger Tank (904), Russian SU-100 Tank Destroyer (905) and British Saladin Armoured Car (906). The Centurion Mk III tank was also included as part of Centurion Tank and Transporter (GS 10) along with a Mack articulated transporter truck. The Bell AH-1G 'HueyCobra' US Army Helicopter (920) was issued in March 1975, the German Hanomag Sd.Kfz. 251 Semi-Track Rocket Launcher (907) in July 1975 and the Sikorsky Skycrane US Army Helicopter (923) in September 1975. Military Gift Set (GS17) included the Bell Helicopter, Tiger I Tank and Saladin Armoured Car. Finally, in October 1976 the French AMX-30 Recovery Tank (908) and British Quad Gun Tractor and Field Gun (909) were issued. == Take-Off Wheels and Whizzwheels == 302 Hillman Hunter London to Sydney Marathon Winner (Take-Off Wheels) By the late sixties the British toy car market had changed with the arrival from the U.S. of Mattel's Hot Wheels range and their associated track sets. Sales of Corgi Toys began to fall away and matters were not helped by a disastrous fire at the Swansea factory in March 1969 which destroyed a warehouse full of models awaiting delivery. Even one of the company's cleverest innovations the Golden Jacks 'Take-Off Wheels' system which first appeared in March 1968 did little to halt the slide. The authentically detailed die-cast wheels fitted to these models were unique to each model, with the exception of the Oldsmobile Toronado and the Chevrolet Camaro which shared a wheel design, and were attached to the axle by means of the 'Golden Jacks' ‚Äì die-cast golden metal stands, which when folded downwards both released the wheel and supported the model. Only seven models were produced with this feature, with more models like the Ferrari Dino, Lamborghini Miura and Pontiac Firebird planned but ultimately released with Whizzwheels instead. The Mini Marcos was a fibreglass-bodied coupe produced by the specialist British sports car manufacturer Marcos and was built on the Austin/Morris Mini chassis and fitted with a highly tuned Mini engine. The Corgi model Mini Marcos GT850 (341), finished in metallic red, was the first in the series of Take-Off Wheels models and was introduced in March 1968. The Rover 2000 TC (275) issued a month later in April 1968 and finished in metallic green was a new casting despite Corgi having previously issued a model of the Rover 2000, and was fitted with a clear roof panel as featured on a Rover 2000 displayed on the Triplex stand at the 1965 Earls Court Motor Show, and a plastic spare wheel holder attached to the boot lid which was a popular period extra on the real car. A rare version finished in white with a red interior also exists. 344 Ferrari 206 Dino ('Red Spot' Whizzwheels) The Oldsmobile Toronado (276) released in June 1968 was an updated version of the earlier 1967 Corgi release of the same model but re-coloured metallic red or metallic yellow, but the metallic gold coloured Chevrolet Camaro SS350 (338) issued in August 1968 was a new model of one of the latest generation 'pony' cars from America. The previously mentioned 1968 London to Sydney Marathon winning Hillman Hunter rally car (302) was issued in July 1969 and was finished in the blue and white of the original. The Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow Mulliner Park Ward Coupe (273), finished in pearlescent white over grey, was issued in March 1970. A rare version of this model was released in silver over metallic blue which was used as the colour scheme for the later Whizzwheels version. The Chevrolet Corvette Stingray (300) with detachable roof panels, released in April 1970, was the last of this short-lived line. This model was available in chromed red or green finish called 'Solarbrite' by Corgi and introduced with the Corgi Rockets range the previous year. Spare Take-Off Wheels were available separately in packs of twelve. Low friction wheels known as 'Whizzwheels' were introduced to keep up with the competition in September 1969 with the Ferrari 206 Dino Sports (344) finished in either red and white or yellow and black. The first incarnation (known to collectors as 'Red Spots') featured rubber tyres and brass hubs with low friction red nylon centres, which though attractive and effective, were expensive to produce and were soon replaced by plastic wheels. Although giving more 'play value', Whizzwheels models are less popular with collectors today as they take away some of the character and realism of the earlier regular wheeled models fitted with rubber tyres. ==Corgi Comics== Corgi Toys introduced the Corgi Comics range in 1969 as a range of character based toys aimed at younger children. Noddy's Car (801) featured figures from the Enid Blyton children's novels of 'Noddy', 'Big-Ears' and 'Golly' sitting in the rumble seat. Early examples featured a model gollywog with a black painted face but after just a few months the colour was changed to grey. The model was later reissued with 'Teddy' sitting in the rumble seat, perhaps in response to the fact that gollywogs had become less acceptable by the late 1960s. It was issued again in the 1970s with just 'Noddy' at the wheel. Also released in December 1969 as part of the range was 'Popeye's Paddlewagon' (802) a half car ‚Äì half boat featuring 'Popeye', 'Olive Oyl' and 'Swee'pea' from the 'Popeye' cartoon series, and 'Basil Brush's car (808) featuring a model of the glove puppet fox from the popular British children's television series The Basil Brush Show driving a colourful version of the 1911 Renault from the Corgi Classics range. Also issued at the same time was a range of toys from Serge Danot's animated television series The Magic Roundabout. These included the 'Magic Roundabout' Carousel (H852), 'Mr Mac Henry's' trike (H859), the 'Magic Roundabout' train (H851) and 'Dougal's' car (807), a modified Citro√´n DS featuring models of 'Dougal' the dog, 'Dylan' the rabbit and 'Brian' the snail. Individual figures of all the characters were available, as was a 'Magic Roundabout' Playground set (H853) that included all the models in the 'Magic Roundabout' series as well as a large 'magic garden' base that featured trees and train tracks. The models in the series were all able to run on these tracks, and would move around the 'Magic Garden' at the turn of a large plastic handle. This set is now one of the most valuable of all Corgi Toys products. == Corgi Kits, Corgi Cargoes, accessories and catalogues == During the early 1960s Corgi Toys issued a series of clip- together plastic kits of buildings and street furniture to complement and add further play value to their range of scale vehicles. The first release was the Batley Leofric Garage (601) with opening garage door in May 1960 followed by two street lamps (606) and AA (Automobile Association) and RAC (Royal Automobile Club) Telephone Boxes (602) in June 1960. In November 1960 Silverstone Pits (603) and Silverstone Press Box (604) were added to the range with Silverstone Club House and Timekeepers Box (605) released in March 1963 along with Circus Elephant and Cage (607). In April 1963 the Motel Chalet (611) was issued and in December 1963 a Shell/BP Service Station (608) was released, along with Shell/BP Forecourt Accessories (609) and Metropolitan Police and Public Telephone Boxes (610). A series of figures to go with Corgi Kits were released in December 1962; Racing Drivers and Mechanics (1501), Spectators (1502), Race Track Officials (1503), Press Officials (1504) and Garage Attendants (1505). The range culminated with two Gift Sets grouping together most of the releases - Shell/BP Garage Layout (GS25) and Silverstone Racing Layout (GS15) both issued in December 1963. Designed with the intention of being used in conjunction with the Commer Platform Lorry (454), Commer Dropside Lorry (452), ERF Platform Lorry (457) and ERF Dropside Lorry (456), Corgi introduced a series of painted die-cast metal 'loads' called Corgi Cargoes. They were packaged in a clear plastic blisters attached to a card featuring the Corgi dog logo, images of Corgi lorries and the range's signature blue and yellow colour scheme. The first to be introduced in February 1960 were Plank Load (1485) and Cement Load (1488), and they were incorporated into Gift Set 11 including the ERF Dropside Lorry and Trailer in March 1960. Brick Load (1486) and Milk Churns Load (1487) followed in July 1960 and Skip and Churns (1490) in September 1960. The last in this range to be released was to be used with the Massey Ferguson 65 Tractor (50) and was a red painted cast metal platform carrying three metal milk churns which clipped to the rear of the tractor. The packaging featured an image of a tractor. Corgi Cargoes were available until 1964. In December 1959 Corgi Toys produced packs of stickers which could be affixed to personalise Corgi models. Pack A (1460) included number plates, road fund licenses and GB plates, Pack B (1461) featured sports wheel discs and white-wall tyres, Pack C (1462) contained commercial vehicle items, Pack D (1463) included CD plates and L (learner) plates and Pack E (1464) introduced in December 1961 contained AA and RAC badges and towing plates. Today it is not uncommon to find early Corgi models with such additions still intact. From 1956 to 1985 a catalogue was issued annually to promote the Corgi range. It was originally a small fold-out single sheet leaflet but by the late 1960s it had evolved into a 48-page colour catalogue. Corgi catalogues are notable for their illustrations and art work that are evocative of the period, and they are now collectable in their own right. ==Decline and demise== After the success of the range during the late 1950s and 1960s, sales remained buoyant in the 1970s, and the company made its biggest profit of ¬£3.5 million in 1978. In an attempt to keep its products contemporary Mettoy began production of the Dragon computer which was aimed at younger users. The expense of this project proved a drain on the company's resources, and profits were hit hard. In October 1983, Corgi Toys were forced to call in the Official Receiver, just three years after the demise of Dinky Toys and one year after Lesney (Matchbox). ==Legacy== The logo used from 1985 until 1994 The Corgi story did not end in the mid-1980s, however, as a management buy-out saw the company re-formed as Corgi Toys Limited in March 1984. This company continued to produce model vehicles, but in smaller numbers than before. The workforce grew but the costs of running the factory at the Fforestfach site had become higher. Competition was now wholly in the form of products that were being manufactured overseas leading to management moving some of the moulds to China and setting up a joint venture company with a Hong Kong company called Flying Dragon. At the same time it took on contract work producing non-toy items. In 1989 the management sold the Corgi brand to Mattel and the factory was retained under the name of Microlink Industries Ltd. The products of the Mettoy owned company continue to be prized by collectors worldwide. In recent years the internet has allowed a far wider collector-base than in the past when swapmeets and antique markets were the only places they could be found. ==Corgi Classics Limited== A management buyout in 1995 saw the end of Mattel ownership and a new company was created, Corgi Classics Limited. On 1 May 2008, Corgi Classics was bought by the international models and collectables group Hornby.Hornby strengthens product range with ¬£7.5M acquisition of Corgi Retrieved from www.corgi.biz on 13 December 2008 == Further reading == The Great Book of Corgi.

Her career began in 1980 when she won the singing competition Search for a Star. After appearances in various television shows and releasing her first singles, Stansfield, Ian Devaney and Andy Morris formed Blue Zone in 1986. The band released several singles and one album, but after the success of Coldcut's \\"People Hold On\\" in 1989, on which Stansfield was featured, the focus was placed on her solo career. Stansfield's first solo album Affection (1989) and its worldwide chart-topping lead single \\"All Around the World\\" were major breakthroughs in her career.

In 1983, Johnnie Hamp produced for ITV Granada a documentary directed by Pete Walker, Born in the Sixties: Lisa Stansfield. It was a profile of the aspiring singer, and it included her comments and those of her mother and sisters, and some songs sung by Stansfield. Also in 1983, she co-hosted the children's television music programme Razzamatazz and appeared on another children's television series The Krankies Klub. Between 1982 and 1983, Stansfield released her next three singles: \\"The Only Way,\\" \\"Listen to Your Heart,\\" and \\"I Got a Feeling.\\" Her early recordings were collected and released on the album In Session in September 1996. ==Music career1984‚Äì1988: Blue Zone=== In 1984, Stansfield and former schoolmates Ian Devaney and Andy Morris, after having worked together on a school musical production, began to collaborate musically and, in 1986, formed the band Blue Zone. They wrote some songs, produced a demo, and took it around to record labels. The small indie label Rockin' Horse Records signed them in 1985, and one year later the label was bought up by Arista Records. After releasing their first two singles in 1986, \\"Love Will Wait\\" and \\"Finest Thing\\", Arista issued \\"On Fire\\" in October 1987. Just as the single was climbing the charts (number ninety-nine in the United Kingdom), it was withdrawn by the record company in the wake of the King's Cross fire. The band's next single, \\"Thinking About His Baby,\\" was released in January 1988 and reached number seventy-nine in the UK. Its B-side, \\"Big Thing,\\" became popular on the radio and in the clubs. In July 1988, \\"Jackie\\" was issued as a single outside the UK, reaching number thirty-seven on the Hot Dance Club Songs and number fifty-four on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. The release date for Blue Zone's album Big Thing, which was recorded in 1987, was pushed back many times by the record label. Finally, it was released outside the UK in November 1988 without any further promotion. The album included songs written by Blue Zone, except for \\"Jackie,\\" which was written by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. The album was produced by Paul Staveley O'Duffy, except for the track \\"Perfect Crime,\\" which was produced by Blue Zone. Ric Wake also co-produced \\"Jackie\\" and \\"Perfect Crime.\\" ===1989‚Äì1990: Affection=== In early 1989, Stansfield co-wrote and recorded \\"People Hold On\\" for Coldcut's album What's That Noise? The single was released in March 1989, and reached number six on the Hot Dance Club Songs in the United States and number eleven in the United Kingdom. On the strength of this hit, Arista Records signed Stansfield to a solo deal. Her debut album Affection was released on 20 November 1989. Stansfield co-wrote all songs with Ian Devaney and Andy Morris. Devaney and Morris also produced the album, except for \\"This Is the Right Time,\\" which was produced by Coldcut. Affection received critical acclaim from music critics, and was commercially successful. It reached the top ten on charts around the world, including number one in Austria and Italy, number two in the UK, Germany, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, number three in Belgium, number five in New Zealand, number six in the Netherlands and Norway, and number seven in Australia and Canada. In the U.S., it peaked at number five on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums, and number nine on the Billboard 200. The album has sold over five million copies worldwide and was certified 3√ó Platinum in the UK, Platinum in the U.S., Canada, Germany, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, and Gold in France, Finland and Austria. Affection includes Stansfield's biggest hit and signature song, \\"All Around the World\\".

In the U.S., \\"All Around the World\\" peaked at number one on the Hot Dance Club Songs and Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs, and reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100. The single was certified Platinum in the U.S. for selling over one million copies, and Gold in many other countries, including the UK, Germany, Australia, Sweden and Austria. In the UK, other singles from the album reached numbers ten (\\"Live Together\\"), thirteen (\\"This Is the Right Time\\") and twenty-five (\\"What Did I Do to You?\\") on the chart. In the U.S., \\"You Can't Deny It\\" peaked at number one on Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs, number two on Hot Dance Club Songs, and number fourteen on the Billboard Hot 100. \\"This Is the Right Time\\" reached number one on Hot Dance Club Songs, number thirteen on Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs, and number twenty-one on the Billboard Hot 100. Stansfield also toured Europe and North America in 1990 in support of the album, and eventually released the Live! All Around the World home video. Thanks to Affection and \\"All Around the World,\\" she received many awards, including the Brit Award, the Billboard Music Award, the World Music Award, the ASCAP Award, Ivor Novello Awards, Silver Clef Awards and DMC Awards. Stansfield was also nominated for two Grammy Awards in the Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance categories. Shortly after her success, she made two charity recordings.

She also wrote a song for Dionne Warwick, \\"Friends Can Be Lovers,\\" which was produced by Ian and Andy along with another song written by Diane Warren, \\"Much Too Much.\\" Lisa sang background vocals on both tracks, which appear on the 1993 Dionne Warwick album Friends Can Be Lovers. ===1993‚Äì1996: So Natural=== In April 1993, George Michael released his charity EP, Five Live. It included \\"These Are the Days of Our Lives,\\" recorded with Stansfield and Queen during The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert in April 1992. Five Live was a success, reaching number one in the United Kingdom for three weeks. During the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, which was also released on VHS, Stansfield performed \\"I Want to Break Free,\\" as well. In early 1993 she co-wrote and recorded \\"In All the Right Places,\\" the theme song from the film Indecent Proposal, starring Robert Redford and Demi Moore. The single was issued in May 1993, and reached number eight in the UK and Ireland. It was later included on Stansfield's third studio album, So Natural, released on 8 November 1993. So Natural garnered positive reviews from music critics, and performed moderately on the charts, reaching number six in the UK and receiving Platinum certification. It also peaked within the top forty in Italy, Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and the Netherlands. The album was promoted by two singles, \\"So Natural\\" and \\"Little Bit of Heaven,\\" which reached numbers fifteen and thirty-two in the UK. So Natural was not released in North America. In 1994, Stansfield toured Japan and the UK. In late 1994 she released two singles in the United States: \\"Make It Right\\" from the Beverly Hills 90210: The College Years soundtrack, and \\"Dream Away\\" (duet with Babyface) from the film The Pagemaster.

It garnered favourable reviews from music critics, and was commercially successful, reaching number two in the United Kingdom, number six in Belgium, and peaked inside the top forty in many European countries and Japan. It also received Gold certification in the UK, Spain, and Switzerland. In the United States the album peaked at number thirty on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums, and fifty-five on the Billboard 200. Singles released in Europe included \\"People Hold On (The Bootleg Mixes),\\" \\"The Real Thing,\\" \\"Never, Never Gonna Give You Up,\\" and \\"The Line.\\" They all entered the UK Singles Chart reaching numbers four, nine, twenty-five and sixty-four, respectively. In the U.S., \\"Never, Never Gonna Give You Up\\" peaked at number seventy-four on the Billboard Hot 100, and at number one on the Billboard Top Dance Tracks. The album also spawned four number-one singles on the Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs: \\"People Hold On (The Bootleg Mixes),\\" \\"Never, Never Gonna Give You Up,\\" \\"Never Gonna Fall,\\" and \\"I'm Leavin'.\\" This success prompted Arista Records to release The Remix Album in June 1998. Stansfield toured South America, the U.S., and Europe in 1997 and 1998 to promote the album. In July 1999, Stansfield's duet with Barry White \\"The Longer We Make Love\\" was released as a single from his album Staying Power.

It combined American big band music with Afro-Cuban rhythms, primarily the son cubano, but also conga and rumba. Although taking its name from the latter, ballroom rumba differs completely from Cuban rumba in both its music and its dance. Hence, authors prefer the Americanized spelling of the word (rhumba) to distinguish between them. == Music== Rumba rhythm.Blatter, Alfred (2007). Revisiting music theory: a guide to the practice. p. 28. . Although the term rhumba began to be used by American record companies to label all kinds of Latin music between 1913 and 1915, the history of rhumba as a specific form of ballroom music can be traced back to May 1930, when Don Azpiaz√∫ and his Havana Casino Orchestra recorded their song \\"El manisero\\" (The Peanut Vendor) in New York City.Daniel (2009). p. 156. This single, released four months later by Victor, became a hit, becoming the first Latin song to sell 1 million copies in the United States.Giro, Radam√©s (2007). Diccionario enciclop√©dico de la m√∫sica en Cuba, Vol. 4. Havana, Cuba: Letras Cubanas. p. 147. The song, composed by Mois√©s Simons, is a son-preg√≥n arranged, in this case, for Azpiaz√∫'s big band featuring three saxophones, two cornets, banjo, guitar, piano, violin, bass, and trap drums. With vocals by Antonio Mach√≠n and a trumpet solo (the first one in the recorded history of Cuban music) by Remberto Lara, the recording, arranged by saxophonist Alfredo Brito, attempted to adapt the Cuban son to the style of ballroom music prevalent at the time in the East Coast. Soon, Azpiaz√∫'s style was followed by other Cuban artists such as Armando Or√©fiche and the Lecuona Cuban Boys, who had extensive international tours in the 1930s. Their style has been often described as ballroom conga, since they used to borrow conga rhythms in songs such as \\"Para Vigo me voy\\". Among their numerous hits were boleros and canciones such as \\"Amapola\\" and \\"Siboney\\". This music movement, which also included many American big bands that covered Latin standards, was dubbed the rhumba craze. Notable bandleaders of the rhumba craze include Xavier Cugat, Jimmy Dorsey, Nathaniel Shilkret, Leo Reisman and Enric Madriguera. Rhumba was also incorporated into classical music, as exemplified by symphonic pieces by composers such as George Gershwin, Harl McDonald and Morton Gould. The kind of rhumba introduced into dance salons in America and Europe in the 1930s was characterized by variable tempo, sometimes nearly twice as fast as the modern ballroom rumba, which was developed as a dance in the 1940s and '50s, when the original music movement had died down. Nonetheless, the rhumba craze would be the first of three Latin music crazes in the first half of the 20th century, together with the mambo craze and the cha-cha-cha craze. ==Dance== American style rhumba box figure Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood has dance steps in the sidewalks on Broadway Ave. This one shows Rumba steps. Two variations of rhumba with opposing step patterns are danced around the world. American style rumba was imported to America by band directors like Emil Coleman and Don Aspiaz√∫ between 1913 and 1935. The film Rumba, released in 1935, brought the style to the attention of the general public. American style rhumba is taught in a box step, known for its slow-quick-quick pattern danced on the 1, 3, and 4 beats of 4-beat music. International style rhumba was developed in Europe by Monsieur Pierre after he compared the established American style with contemporary Cuban dancers. International style is taught in a quick-quick- slow pattern danced on the 2, 3, and 4 beats of 4 beat music, similar in step and motion to the cha-cha-cha.Daniel (2009). p. 164. Both styles were canonized in 1955. ===International style=== Rhumba is one of the ballroom dances which occurs in social dance and in international competitions. Of the five competitive international Latin dances (pasodoble, samba, cha-cha-cha, jive, and rumba), it is the slowest. This ballroom rumba was derived from a Cuban rhythm and dance called the bolero-son; the international style was derived from studies of dance in Cuba in the pre-revolutionary period.Lavelle, Doris (1983). Latin & American dances. 3rd ed. London, UK: Black. The modern international style of dancing the rumba derives from studies made by dance teacher Monsieur Pierre (Pierre Zurcher-Margolle), who partnered Doris Lavelle.Julie McMain's Glamour Addiction notes that Pierre Margolle's professional name was Monsieur Pierre; he and his partner were commonly referred to as \\"Monsieur Pierre and Doris Lavelle\\"; therefore some writers have incorrectly assumed that Pierre's last name was Lavelle.Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing 2004. 100 years of nce: a history of the ISTD Examinations Board. London. p. 62 Pierre, then from London, visited Cuba in 1947, 1951, and 1953 to find out how and what Cubans were dancing at the time.Lavelle (1983). The introduction tells the story of Pierre's visits to Cuba, but with inaccurate dates. The international ballroom rumba is a slower dance of about 120 beats per minute which corresponds, both in music and in dance, to what the Cubans of an older generation called the bolero-son. It is easy to see why, for ease of reference and for marketing, rhumba is a better name, however inaccurate; it is the same kind of reason that led later on to the use of salsa as an overall term for popular music of Cuban origin. All social dances in Cuba involve a hip-sway over the standing leg and, though this is scarcely noticeable in fast salsa, it is more pronounced in the slow ballroom rumba.Laird, Walter (2003). The Laird Technique of Latin Dancing. International Dance Publications Ltd. p .9, puts it like this (after taking a step to side): \\"Transfer full weight to this foot allowing the pelvis to move sideways and back so that the weight is felt to be near the heel of the standing foot. The knee of the supporting leg is locked back.\\" This description incidentally illustrates the difficulty of describing body movements in print. In general, steps are kept compact and the dance is danced generally without any rise and fall. This style is authentic, as is the use of free arms in various figures. The basic figuresbronze and silver medals of dance teaching organizations. (Medal examinations (dance)) derive from dance moves observed in Havana in the pre-revolutionary period, and have developed their own life since then. Competition figures are often complex, and this is where competition dance separates from social dance. Details can be obtained from the syllabuses of dance teaching organizations and from standard texts.Laird, Walter (2003). The Laird Technique of Latin Dancing. International Dance Publications Ltd.McMains, Juliet E. (2006).

Several firms took interest in this very advanced specification and the eventual contract (6/Acft/10144) was awarded to Bristol Aircraft in February 1953. Bristol gave the project the type number 188, of which three aircraft were to be built, one a pure test bed and the other two (constructor numbers 13518 and 13519) for flight testing. Under contract number KC/2M/04/CB.42(b) serial numbers XF923 and XF926 were given on 4 January 1954 to the two that would fly. To support the development of the Avro 730 Mach 3 reconnaissance bomber, another three aircraft were ordered (Serial Numbers XK429, XK434 and XK436). The follow-up order was cancelled when the Avro 730 programme was cancelled in 1957 as part of that year's review of defence spending. The 188 project was continued as a high speed research aircraft. Bristol 188 at the RAF Museum, Cosford. The advanced nature of the aircraft meant that new construction methods had to be developed. Several materials were considered for construction and two specialist grades of steel were selected: a titanium-stabilized 18-8 austenitic steel and a 12%-Cr steel used in gas turbines (Firth-Vickers Rex 448). These had to be manufactured to better tolerances in sufficient quantities for construction to start. The 12% chromium stainless steel with a honeycomb centre was used for the construction of the outer skin, to which no paint was applied. Riveting was a potential method for construction but the new arc welding technique using an argon gas shield known as puddle welding was used. There were long delays with the method, which was less than satisfactory. The W. G. Armstrong Whitworth company provided substantial technical help and support to Bristol during this period; they produced major sections of the airframe as a subcontractor. North American with the XB-70 Valkyrie bomber used the same methods of argon welding of stainless steel honeycomb sheet metal. A fused-quartz windscreen and canopy and cockpit refrigeration system were designed and fitted but were never tested in the environment for which they had been designed. The specification for the aircraft required engine installations which permitted the fitting of different air intakes, engines and propelling nozzles.\\"Three Centuries To Concorde\\" Charles Burnet, Mechanical Engineering Publications Limited, London 1979, , p.172 The 188 was originally intended to have Avon engines but the half ton lighter each Gyron Junior was substituted in June 1957, necessitating the engines mounted further forward with longer nacelles and jet pipes.https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1962/1962%20-%200700.html The Gyron Junior was then under development for the Saunders-Roe SR.177 supersonic interceptor and incorporated a fully variable reheat, from idle to full power, the first such application used in an aircraft.King 1962, p. 700. This choice of powerplant resulted in the 188 having a typical endurance of only 25 minutes, not long enough for the high-speed research tests that were required. Chief Test Pilot Godfrey L. Auty reported that while the 188 transitioned smoothly from subsonic to supersonic flight, the Gyron Junior engines were prone to surging beyond that speed, causing the aircraft to pitch and yaw. In order to solve the aerodynamic and flutter problems, a large number of scale models were tested. Some, mounted on converted rocket boosters, were launched from RAE Aberporth, for free-flight investigation.King 1962, p. 695. ==Operational history== The first prototype Bristol 188 landing at Farnborough after giving a public display at the 1962 SBAC Show In May 1960, the first airframe was delivered to the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough for structural tests ‚Äì loading tests both heated and unheated ‚Äì before moving on to RAE Bedford. XF923 undertook the first taxiing trials on 26 April 1961, although due to problems encountered, the first flight was not until 14 April 1962.\\"World News: T.188 Discontinued.\\" Flight International, 20 February 1964, p. 267. XF923 was intended to remain with Bristol for its initial flights and evaluation before turning it over to the MoA. XF926 had its first flight, using XF923s engines, on 26 April 1963. XF926 was given over to RAE Bedford for its flying programme. Over 51 flights, it managed a top speed of Mach 1.88 (1,440 mph : 2,300 km/h) at 36,000 ft (11,000 m).\\"Individual Aircraft History: Accession number 83/A/1112.\\" RAF Museum. Retrieved: 22 June 2010. The longest subsonic Bristol 188 flight was only 48 minutes in length, requiring 70% of the fuel load to be expended to attain its operational altitude. The first prototype made its first public appearance in September 1962 when it was displayed on the ground and in the air at that year's Farnborough Air Show. In the same year the aircraft was seen in the film Some People.https://annekewills.com/some-people-a-forgotten-film/ Measurements collected during testing were recorded onboard and transmitted to the ground station for recording.King 1962, p. 702. The flight information transmitted meant that a \\"ground pilot\\" could advise the pilot. Bristol 188 at the RAF Museum, Cosford. The project suffered a number of problems, the main being that the fuel consumption of the engines did not allow the aircraft to fly at high speeds long enough to evaluate the \\"thermal soaking\\" of the airframe, which was one of the main research areas it was built to investigate. Combined with fuel leaks, the inability to reach its design speed of Mach 2 and a takeoff speed at nearly , the test phase was severely compromised. Nonetheless, although the 188 programme was eventually abandoned, the knowledge and technical information gained was put to some use for the future Concorde program. The inconclusive nature of the research into the use of stainless steel led to Concordes being constructed from conventional aluminium alloys with a Mach limit of 2.2. Experience gained with the Gyron Junior engine, which was the first British gas turbine designed for sustained supersonic operation, additionally later assisted with the development of the Bristol (later Rolls Royce) Olympus 593 powerplant which was used on both Concorde and the BAC TSR-2. Various proposals to further develop the 188 were considered including incorporating ramjets and rocket engines as well as considering fighter and reconnaissance variants. One serious proposal involved the fitting of \\"wedge\\" type intakes. The announcement that all development was terminated was made in 1964, the last flight of XF926 taking place on 12 January 1964. In total the project cost ¬£20 million.Winchester 2005, p. 198. By the end of the programme, considered the most expensive to date for a research aircraft in Great Britain, each aircraft had to be \\"cannibalised\\" in order to keep the designated airframe ready for flight. ==Surviving aircraft== In April 1966, both 188 fuselages were transported to the Proof and Experimental Establishment at Shoeburyness, Essex to act as targets for gunnery trials, but during 1972, XF926 was dismantled and moved to RAF Cosford (without its engines) to act as instructional airframe 8368M, and is preserved at the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford near Wolverhampton. XF923 was subsequently scrapped at Foulness. ==Operators== ; * Royal Aircraft Establishment ==Specifications (Bristol 188)== ==Notable appearances in media== Bristol 188 XF923 was prominently featured in Some People (1962), a feature film primarily shot in Bristol. ==See also== ==ReferencesCitations=Bibliography=== * King, H.

At age 15, he went on the road playing piano in a barrelhouse style of blues. Like many bluesmen of his time, he travelled around playing to all-male audiences in sawmill, turpentine and levee camps along the Mississippi River, sometimes in a duo with Big Joe Williams, gathering a repertoire of raw, sexually explicit material. His wanderings eventually brought him to St. Louis, Missouri, where he met St. Louis Jimmy Oden, the writer of the blues standard \\"Goin' Down Slow\\". In 1929 he was spotted by a talent scout and sent to New York City to record for Okeh Records. His first release was \\"44 Blues\\" which became a blues standard and his signature song. He soon began recording for different labels under various names, including Easy Papa Johnson, Dobby Bragg, and Willie Kelly (for Victor Records from 1930 to 1933). During this period he befriended another blues musician, the singer Charlie \\"Specks\\" McFadden, and accompanied him on half of the McFadden's recordings. After he and Oden moved to Chicago, Sykes found his first period of fame when he signed a contract with Decca Records in 1934. In 1943, he signed with Bluebird Records and recorded with the Honeydrippers. Sykes and Oden continued their musical friendship into the 1960s. In Chicago, Sykes began to display an increasing urbanity in his songwriting, using an eight-bar blues pop gospel structure instead of the traditional twelve-bar blues. Despite the growing urbanity of his style, he gradually became less competitive in the post‚ÄìWorld War II music scene. After his contract with RCA Victor expired, he recorded for smaller labels, such as United, until his opportunities ran out in the mid-1950s. Sykes left Chicago in 1954 for New Orleans as electric blues was taking over the Chicago blues clubs. When he returned to recording in the 1960s, it was for labels such as Delmark, Bluesville, Storyville and Folkways, which were documenting the quickly passing blues history. He lived out his final years in New Orleans, where he died from a heart attack on July 17, 1983. ==Legacy== Sykes had a long career, spanning the pre-war and postwar eras. His pounding piano boogies and risqu√© lyrics characterize his contributions to the blues. He was responsible for influential blues songs such as \\"44 Blues\\", \\"Driving Wheel\\", and \\"Night Time Is the Right Time\\". He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1999 and the Gennett Records Walk of Fame in 2011. ==Discography== * The Return of Roosevelt Sykes (Bluesville, 1960) * The Honeydripper (Bluesville, 1961) * Blues (Folkways, 1961) with Memphis Slim * Face to Face with the Blues (Columbia, 1961) * Roosevelt Sykes Sings the Blues (Crown, 1962) * The Honeydripper: Roosevelt Sykes Plays and Sings the Blues (Columbia, 1962) * Hard Drivin' Blues (Delmark, 1964) with Homesick James * Roosevelt Sykes in Europe (Delmark, 1966 [1969]) * The Meek Roosevelt Sykes (Carson, 1969) * The Honeydripper's Duke's Mixture (Barclay, 1971) * Feel Like Blowing My Horn (Delmark, 1970 [1973]) * Dirty Double Mother (BluesWay, 1973) * The Original Honeydripper (Blind Pig, 1977) * Music Is My Business (Blue Labor, 1975 [1977]) ==ReferencesRoosevelt Sykes recordings at the Discography of American Historical Recordings.

Such doors were originally used on horse-drawn carriages,Anthony Bird & Francis Hutton-Stott, Lanchester Motorcars, A History, page 96, Cassell, London 1965 but are rarely found on modern vehicles, primarily because they are perceived as being less safe than a front-hinged door. Initially standard on many models, later they became popularized in the custom car trade. The term \\"suicide\\" is avoided by major automobile manufacturers in favor of alternatives such as coach doors (Rolls- Royce and Lincoln), flexdoors (Opel), freestyle doors (Mazda), rear access doors (Saturn), and rear-hinged doors (the preferred technical term). ==History== Fiat 600 Multipla with front suicide doors, right side doors open. Note that all four doors are connected to the B-pillars. Suicide doors were common on cars manufactured in the first half of the 20th century. In the era before seat belts, the accidental opening of such doors meant that there was a greater risk of falling out of the vehicle compared to front-hinged doors, where airflow pushed the doors closed rather than opening them further. Suicide doors were especially popular with mobsters in the gangster era of the 1930s, supposedly owing to the ease of pushing passengers out of moving vehicles with the air around the moving car holding the door open, according to Dave Brownell, the former editor of Hemmings Motor News. After World War II, the use of suicide doors was mostly limited to rear doors of four-door sedans. The best-known use of suicide doors on post-World War II American automobiles was the Lincoln Continental 4 door convertibles and sedans (1961‚Äì1969) and Ford Thunderbird 1967‚Äì1971 four-door sedans. The British Rover P4 cars also used rear suicide doors until their demise in 1964. German Goggomobil saloons and coupes had two door bodies with suicide doors, until these were changed to front-hinged in 1964.Goggomobil ==Modern use== Lincoln concept car (Lincoln C) from 2009 with rear suicide doors, left side doors open. Note that there is no B-pillar and therefore there are two pillars, A and C. 2010 Opel Meriva Due to increasing safety concerns, the last mass- produced car model with independently opening suicide doors sold in the United States was the Ford Thunderbird four-door sedan from 1967 to 1971. Similarly, the last mass-produced pickup truck with such doors was the Toyota Tundra from 2000 to 2003. In 2003, the new Rolls-Royce Phantom (sold in the United Kingdom) reintroduced independent suicide doors in luxury vehicle applications. Other luxury models with classic suicide doors include the Spyker D8 and the Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe four-seat convertible. However, the most recent mass-produced model with such doors may be the Opel Meriva.https://jalopnik.com/opel-vauxhall-meriva-giant-jelly-bean-gets- suicide-doo-5440497 Saturn Ion coupe 2002‚Äî2008 In recent years, rear-hinged rear doors that cannot be opened until the front doors are opened have appeared on a number of vehicles, including extended-cab pickup trucks, the Saturn SC, the Saturn Ion Quad Coupe, the Honda Element, the Toyota FJ Cruiser, the BMW i3, the Mazda RX-8 and Mazda MX-30. Such doors are more properly referred to as clamshell doors. Rear passenger suicide doors had long been used on Austin FX4 hackney carriages. Their successors, the TX1 TX2 and TX4, lacked them. In 2018 LEVC introduced the TXe which has rear passenger suicide doors. Several concept cars have featured suicide doors, such as the Lincoln C, a hatchback with no B-pillar and rear suicide doors, or the Carbon Motors Corporation E7, a police car with rear suicide doors designed to aid officers getting handcuffed passengers in and out of the back seat. The Kia Naimo, an electric concept car, also has rear suicide doors. Other car manufacturers which have produced models with suicide doors include Citro√´n, Lancia, Opel, Panhard, Rover, Saab, Saturn, ≈†koda, and Volkswagen. Lincoln has announced that 80 limited-edition 2019 Continentals will be made with suicide doors, marking the Continental's 80th anniversary. \\"A limited number of additional Continental Coach Door Edition sedans will be available for the 2020 model year, too...\\" ==Advantages== An open rear suicide door on a Rolls- Royce Ghost Rear-hinged doors make entering and exiting a vehicle easier, allowing a passenger to enter by turning to sit and exit by stepping forward and out. In combination with traditional front doors, they allow chauffeurs easier access to the rear door. In Austin FX4 taxis, drivers were able to reach the rear exterior door handle through the driver's window without getting out of the vehicle. Additionally, rear-hinged doors also allow a better position for a person installing a child seat into the back seat of a vehicle than conventional doors, while being simpler and cheaper to build than the sliding doors commonly used on MPVs. However, the most recent MPV in the compact MPV class with such doors has been the Opel Meriva B introduced in 2010. The combination of front-hinged front doors and rear-hinged rear doors allows for a design without the B-pillar, creating a large opening for entering and exiting the vehicle as seen in the above photo. ==Disadvantages== Lloyd LT 600 van with a front suicide door When front doors are directly adjacent to rear suicide doors, exiting and entering the vehicle can be awkward if people try to use the front and back doors at the same time. There are also a number of safety hazards: *Aerodynamic factors forcing rear-hinged doors open at speed in older cars. In 1969, Consumer Reports reported this problem on a Subaru 360. * if a person not wearing a seat belt falls out of a moving car with a coach door, the door can catch them and drag them along the road at speed, causing serious injuries. Car manufactures mitigate these hazards with such safety features as seat belts, and locks requiring front- hinged doors be open before permitting rear-hinged doors to open. ==See also== *Butterfly doors *Canopy doors *Gull-wing doors *List of cars with non- standard door designs *Scissor doors *Sliding doors *Swan doors ==References== Category:Automotive styling features Category:Car doors ","title":"Suicide door"},{"id":"523355","text":"Johnny Rivers (born John Henry Ramistella; November 7, 1942) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer. His repertoire includes pop, folk, blues, and old-time rock 'n' roll. Rivers charted during the 1960s and 1970s but remains best known for a string of hit singles between 1964 and 1968, among them \\"Memphis\\" (a Chuck Berry cover), \\"Mountain of Love\\" (a Harold Dorman cover), \\"The Seventh Son\\" (a Willie Mabon cover), \\"Secret Agent Man\\", \\"Poor Side of Town\\" (a US #1), \\"Baby I Need Your Lovin'\\" (a 1967 cover of the Four Tops single from 1964), and \\"Summer Rain\\". ==Life and careerEarly years=== Rivers was born as John Henry Ramistella in New York City, of Italian ancestry. His family moved from New York to Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Influenced by the distinctive Louisiana musical style, Rivers began playing guitar at age eight, taught by his father and uncle. While still in junior high school, he started sitting in with a band called the Rockets, led by Dick Holler, who later wrote a number of hit songs, including \\"Abraham, Martin and John\\" and the novelty song, \\"Snoopy vs. the Red Baron\\". Ramistella formed his own band, the Spades, and made his first record at 14, while he was a student at Baton Rouge High School. Some of their music was recorded on the Suede label as early as 1956.Poore, Billy (1998). Rockabilly: A Forty-Year Journey, p. 101. Hal Leonard Corporation. . On a trip to New York City in 1958, Ramistella met Alan Freed, who advised him to change his name to \\"Johnny Rivers\\" after the Mississippi River, which flows through Baton Rouge. Freed also helped Rivers gain several recording contracts on the Gone label. From March 1958 to March 1959, Johnny Rivers released three records which did not sell well. Rivers returned to Baton Rouge in 1959, and began playing throughout the American South alongside comedian Brother Dave Gardner. One evening in Birmingham, Rivers met Audrey Williams, Hank Williams' first wife. She encouraged Rivers to move to Nashville, where he found work as a songwriter and demo singer. Rivers also worked alongside Roger Miller. By this time, Rivers had decided he would never make it as a singer, and song writing became his priority. ===1960s=== In 1958, Rivers met fellow Louisianan James Burton, a guitarist in a band led by Ricky Nelson. Burton later recommended one of Rivers' songs, \\"I'll Make Believe,\\" to Nelson who recorded it. They met in Los Angeles in 1961, where Rivers subsequently found work as a songwriter and studio musician. His big break came in 1963, when he filled in for a jazz combo at Gazzarri's, a nightclub in Hollywood, where his instant popularity drew large crowds.Quisling, Erik, and Williams, Austin (2003). Straight Whisky: A Living History of Sex, Drugs, and Rock 'n' Roll on the Sunset Strip, pp. 19‚Äì21. Bonus Books, Inc. . In 1964, Elmer Valentine gave Rivers a one-year contract to open at the Whisky a Go Go, on Sunset Strip in West Hollywood. The Whisky had been in business just three days when the Beatles song \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" entered the Billboard Hot 100. The subsequent British Invasion knocked almost every American artist off the top of the charts, but Rivers was so popular that record producer Lou Adler decided to issue Johnny Rivers Live at the Whisky A Go Go, which reached #12. Rivers recalled that his most requested live song then was \\"Memphis\\", which reached #2 on Cash Box on 4‚Äì11 July 1964 and also on the Hot 100 on 11‚Äì18 July 1964. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. According to Elvis Presley's friend and employee, Alan Fortas, Presley played a test pressing of \\"Memphis\\" for Rivers that Presley had made but not released. Rivers was impressed and, much to Presley's chagrin, Rivers recorded and released it, even copying the arrangement. (Fortas writes: \\"After that, Johnny was on Elvis's shit list\\" and was persona non grata from then on.)Fortas, Alan and Nash, Alanna (1992). Elvis from Memphis to Hollywood, p.228, Aurum Press. . Rivers' version far outsold the Chuck Berry original from August 1959, which stalled at #87 in the US. Rivers continued to record mostly live performances throughout 1964 and 1965, including Go-Go-style records with songs featuring folk music and blues rock influences including \\"Maybellene\\" (another Berry cover), after which came \\"Mountain of Love\\", \\"Midnight Special\\", \\"Seventh Son\\" (written by Willie Dixon), plus Pete Seeger's\\" Where Have All the Flowers Gone?\\", all of which were hits. Rivers in a publicity photo in 1973 In 1963, Rivers began working with writers P.F. Sloan and Steve Barri on a theme song for the American broadcast of a British television series Danger Man, starring Patrick McGoohan. At first Rivers balked at the idea but eventually changed his mind. The American version of the show, titled Secret Agent, went on the air in the spring of 1965. The theme song was very popular and created public demand for a longer single version. Rivers' recording of \\"Secret Agent Man\\" reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1966. It sold one million copies, also winning gold disc status. In 1966, Rivers began to record ballads that featured background vocalists. He produced several hits including his own \\"Poor Side of Town\\", which would be his biggest chart hit and his only #1 record. He also started his own record company, Soul City Records which included the 5th Dimension, whose recordings of \\"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\\" and \\"Wedding Bell Blues\\" were #1 hits for the new label. In addition, Rivers is credited with giving songwriter Jimmy Webb a major break when the 5th Dimension recorded his song \\"Up, Up, and Away\\". Rivers also recorded Webb's \\"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\\". It was covered by Glen Campbell, who had a major hit with it. Rivers continued to record more hits covering other artists, including \\"Baby I Need Your Lovin'\\", originally recorded by the Four Tops, and \\"The Tracks of My Tears\\" by the Miracles, both going Top 10 in 1967. In 1968, Rivers put out Realization, a #5 album that included the #14 pop chart single \\"Summer Rain\\", written by a former member of the Mugwumps, James Hendricks. The album included some of the psychedelic influences of the time, such as the song Hey Joe, with a two minute introduction, and marked a change in Rivers' musical direction, with more introspective songs including \\"Look To Your Soul\\" and \\"Going Back to Big Sur\\". ===1970s=== Rivers on October 11, 1975 In the 1970s Rivers continued to record more songs and albums that were successes with music critics, but did not sell well. L.A. Reggae (1972) reached the LP chart as a result of the #6 hit \\"Rockin' Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu,\\" a cover version of the Huey \\"Piano\\" Smith and the Clowns song. The track became Rivers' third million seller, which was acknowledged with the presentation of a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America (R.I.A.A.) on January 29, 1973. Reviewing L.A. Reggae in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau said, \\"there are modernization moves, of course‚Äîtwo get-out-the-vote songs (just what George needs) plus the mysterious reggae conceit plus a heartfelt if belated antiwar song‚Äîbut basically this is just Johnny nasalizing on some fine old memories. 'Rockin' Pneumonia' and 'Knock on Wood' are especially fine.\\" Other Hot 100 top 40 hits from that time period were 1973's \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\" (originally recorded in 1955 by Carl Perkins) and 1975's \\"Help Me Rhonda\\" (originally a #1 hit for the Beach Boys), on which Brian Wilson sang back-up vocals. Rivers' last Top 10 entry was his 1977 recording of \\"Swayin' to the Music (Slow Dancing),\\" written by Jack Tempchin and originally released by Funky Kings. Rivers' last Hot 100 entry, also in 1977, was \\"Curious Mind (Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um),\\" originally released by Major Lance and written by Curtis Mayfield. In addition, Rivers recorded the title song for the late night concert- influenced TV show The Midnight Special. Johnny Rivers' career total is 9 Top 10 hits on the Hot 100 and 17 in the Top 40 from 1964 to 1977. Rivers has sold well over 30 million records. ===1980s to present=== Rivers (left) playing with Argentine guitarist Pappo, 1986 Rivers continued releasing material into the 1980s (e.g., 1980's Borrowed Time LP), garnering an interview with Dick Clark on American Bandstand in 1981, although his recording career was winding down. Around this time, Rivers turned to Christianity. Rivers is still touring, however, performing 50 to 60 shows a year. Increasingly he has returned to the blues that inspired him initially. In 1998 Rivers reactivated his Soul City Records label and released Last Train to Memphis. In early 2000, Rivers recorded with Eric Clapton, Tom Petty and Paul McCartney on a tribute album dedicated to Buddy Holly's backup band, the Crickets. Rivers performing at the Mohegan Sun Casino on June 18, 2011, in Connecticut Rivers is one of a small number of performers including Mariah Carey, Paul Simon, Billy Joel, Pink Floyd (from 1975's Wish You Were Here onward), Queen, Genesis (though under the members' individual names and/or the pseudonym Gelring Limited) and Neil Diamond, who have their names as the copyright owner on their recordings (most records have the recording company as the named owner of the recording). This development was spearheaded by the Bee Gees with their $200 million lawsuit against RSO Records, the largest successful lawsuit against a record company by an artist or group. On June 12, 2009, Johnny Rivers was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame. His name has been suggested many times for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but he has never been selected. Rivers, however, was a nominee for 2015 induction into America's Pop Music Hall of Fame. On April 9, 2017, Rivers performed a song, accompanying himself on acoustic guitar, at the funeral for Chuck Berry, at The Pageant, in St. Louis, Missouri. One of Rivers' biggest and earliest hits was his cover of Berry's \\"Memphis, Tennessee\\". ==Discography== ==References== * * ==External links== * * Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:Singers from New York City Category:Musicians from Baton Rouge, Louisiana Category:Baton Rouge Magnet High School alumni Category:American rock guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:American male singers Category:Imperial Records artists Category:Cub Records artists Category:Record producers from New York (state) Category:American rock songwriters Category:Atlantic Records artists Category:Epic Records artists Category:Era Records artists Category:Grammy Award winners Category:Big Tree Records artists Category:Songwriters from New York (state) Category:Songwriters from Louisiana Category:Singers from Louisiana Category:Guitarists from Louisiana Category:Guitarists from New York City Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:20th-century American male musicians ","title":"Johnny Rivers"},{"id":"523357","text":"Primary is a 1960 direct cinema documentary film about the 1960 Wisconsin primary election between John F.

A. Pennebaker, the film was a breakthrough in documentary film style. Most importantly, through the use of mobile cameras and lighter sound equipment, the filmmakers were able to follow the candidates as they wound their way through cheering crowds, cram with them into crowded hotel rooms and hover around their faces as they awaited polling results. This resulted in a greater intimacy than was possible with the older, more classical techniques of documentary filmmaking, and it established what has since become the standard style of video reporting.

The term came into widespread use after a series of such raids in Belfast in 1979 that was covered in news reports and in countries such as Australia that inspired a series of similar crimes. Notably, large trucks are used to break into technology companies and steal high-value equipment for resale on the black market. Commercial properties in areas prone to ram-raids often erect barriers or obstructions, such as bollards, to discourage such attacks. Automated teller machines are also targets of ram-raiding, with criminals smashing the machines to steal cash boxes. Many companies have come up with solutions to ram-raiding.'Raminator' foils ATM ram raids. The Daily Telegraph. 21 Aug. 2008. Everything from electronic bollards to electronic barriers has been employed to keep property from the raiders.

It is the first attack helicopter to be designed and produced wholly in Europe. It has continued to be developed by AgustaWestland, the successor company to Agusta. The A129 has undergone several combat deployments since entering service with the Italian Army in the 1990s. A derivative of the A129, the TAI/AgustaWestland T129 ATAK, has been developed by Turkish Aerospace Industries in cooperation with AgustaWestland for the Turkish Army and potential customers. ==DevelopmentOrigins=== In 1972, the Italian Army began forming a requirement for a light observation and anti-tank helicopter; around the same time, the West German military had identified a similar need. The two nations' requirements led to a joint project being initiated between the Italian company Agusta and West German company MBB; however, the joint effort was soon dissolved following preliminary work. Agusta had initially studied the development of a combat- oriented derivative of their existing A109 helicopter, however they decided to proceed with the development of a more ambitious helicopter design.Donald, David, ed. \\"Agusta A 129 Mangusta\\". The Complete Encyclopedia of World Aircraft. Barnes & Noble Books, 1997. . In 1978, Agusta formally began the design process on what would become the A129.Frawley, Gerald. \\"AgustaWestland A129 Mangusta\\". The International Directory of Military Aircraft, 2002/2003. Aerospace Publications, 2002. . On 11 September 1983, the first of five A129 prototypes made the type's maiden flight; the fifth prototype would first fly in March 1986. Around the same time, the Italian Army placed an order for a total of 60 A129s. According to defence publication Jane's Information Group, by 1985, the A129 was considered to be a comparable attack helicopter to the American-built McDonnell Douglas AH-64 Apache, and showed potential on the export market. ===Export market=== During the 1980s, Agusta sought to partner with Westland Helicopters to develop a common light attack helicopter, other prospective manufacturing participants in the joint initiative included Fokker and Construcciones Aeron√°uticas SA.Brzoska 1992, p. 26. In 1986, the governments of Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom signed a memorandum of understanding to investigate an improved version of the A129, alternatively called the Joint European Helicopter Tonal or Light Attack Helicopter (LAH). By 1988, feasibility studies for four different options had been conducted for the LAH, these would have between 80 per cent and 20 per cent growth over the initial A129; both single-engine and twin-engine configurations were examined using various new powerplants, as well as a new rotor system, retractable landing gear, improved sensors and more powerful armament.\\"LAH cost options defined.\\" Flight International, 24 September 1988. p. 2. However, the LAH project collapsed in 1990 following Britain and the Netherlands independently deciding to withdraw from the program and eventually procure the AH-64 Apache instead. An A129 in flight, with personnel riding on the landing gear Agusta proceeded to develop the A129 International, or A129I, an upgraded version of the A129 for export customers. The A129I featured a five-bladed main rotor (early production aircraft employed a four-bladed main rotor), a pair of LHTEC T800 engines (replacing the Rolls-Royce Gem engines) and an upgraded transmission; the A129I also had new weapons and electronic warfare systems. In 1998, the Italian Army had decided to upgrade a portion of their A129 fleet with many of the A129I's systems, the first of the remanufactured helicopters was delivered in 2002.\\"Italian army receives upgraded Mangusta attack helicopters.\\" Flight International, 11 November 2002.\\"Turkey Finally Lands Its Attack Helicopters.\\" Defense Industry Daily, 19 February 2014. In September 2007, the A129I was formally redesignated as the AW129.\\"Rising Fortunes.\\" Flight International, 4 May 1996. p. 33. During the Australian Army's AIR 87 project to procure a new Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter fleet, the Agusta A129 was one of the contenders; it was one of the three attack helicopters, alongside the AH-64 Apache and the Eurocopter Tiger, to be short-listed out of the six tenders submitted. In December 2001, Australia announced its selection of the Eurocopter Tiger as the winning bid.Australian Department of Defence, DMO AIR 87 - Armed Reconnaissance Helicopters Project Turkey had sought a new attack helicopter since the 1990s to replace their diminished Bell AH-1 Cobra and Bell AH-1 SuperCobra fleets. Following a highly protracted selection process, in September 2007, an order was issued for 51 TAI/AgustaWestland T129 ATAK helicopters, a variant of the A129 International. As a part of the deal with AgustaWestland, Turkish defense firm TAI acquired the rights for future manufacturing of the T129; TAI intends to produce the T129 for export customers. Various components and avionics systems are intended to be replaced with indigenously-produced systems as they are developed. ==Design== The gunner's position in the cockpit of an A129. Note the weapons scope and targeting controls present The A129 Mangusta is the first European attack helicopter; as such it has several original aspects to its design, such as being the first helicopter to make use of a fully computerised integrated management system to reduce crew workload.Fr√©driksen 2001, p. 12. It was decided that much of the helicopter's functionality was to be automated; as such, parts of the flight and armament systems are monitored and directly controlled by onboard computers. The A129 shares considerable design similarities to Agusta's earlier A109 utility helicopter; the rear section of the A129 was derived from the A109 and incorporated to an entirely new forward section. The A129's fuselage is highly angular and armoured for ballistic protection; the composite rotor blades are also able to withstand hits from 23mm cannon fire. The two man crew, comprising a pilot and gunner, sit in a conventional tandem cockpit. The A129 can be used in the anti-armour, armed reconnaissance, ground attack, escort, fire support and anti-aircraft roles. For the anti-ground mission the helicopter can employ various armaments, such as up to eight Hellfire missiles. In the air-to-air role, the FIM-92 Stinger missile was certified for use in 2003.\\"Stinger Air-To-Air Missile Validated On The A129 Combat Helicopter.\\" AgustaWestland, 20 October 2003.\\"A129 gets Stinger as helicopter anti-air missile moves on.\\" Flight International, 27 March 2000. The A129 can also be equipped with 81 mm or 70 mm (2.75 in) unguided rockets; a M197 three-barrel 20 mm cannon is also installed onto a nose-mounted Oto Melara TM-197B turret. By 2014, the Spike- ER, a fourth-generation anti-tank missile, had been added to the A129's arsenal. Power is provided by a pair of Rolls-Royce Gem 2-1004D turboshaft engines, the engines have been designed to incorporate infrared heat signature reduction measures. One of the key protective measures incorporated onto the A129 include the electronic warfare and SIAP (Single Integrated Air Picture) self-protection suite. Elements of the mission interface systems and the onboard software integrated onto later aircraft were produced by Selex Galileo.Peruzzi, Luca. \\"Italian army reveals AW129 upgrade plan.\\" Flight International, 12 November 2010. The A129 is equipped with infrared night vision systems and is capable of operating at day or night in all-weather conditions. Laser systems are fitted onto newer aircraft for range-finding and target designation purposes, the A129 can laser-designate targets for other friendly aircraft to attack. On the AW129D, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems's Toplite III sight is used as the primary targeting system; it is able to act as a FLIR and has both manual and automatic target tracking modes, Toplite also provides a greater detection and identification range than the 1970s era HeliTOW sensor it replaced.Egozi, Arie. \\"AW129 on target with TopLite integration\\". Flight International, 16 January 2015. In 1998, Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) formally partnered with Agusta to offer various avionics and weapons upgrades to potential A129 operators; various IAI technologies have since been proposed and implemented on Italian A129s.Egozi, Ari. \\"Israel and Italy team in Turkey.\\" Flight International, 3 March 1998.\\"Israeli systems on Italian helicopters?\\" iHLS, 28 January 2015. ==Operational history== Three A129s in Iraq The Italian Army would receive a total of 60 A129 helicopters, deliveries of the type began in 1990. In 1999, AgustaWestland received a contract to produce the last batch of 15 A129s to the new combat CBT configuration; in late 2001, the Italian Army opted to have all of their A129s retrofitted to the improved A129 CBT standard.\\"Agusta Delivers First Combat A129 To Italian Army.\\" AgustaWestland, 25 October 2002. As of 2011, AgustaWestland plans to modify a total of 24 A129s to the new ARH-129D aerial reconnaissance standard and manufacture a further 24 new-built ARH-129Ds for the Italian Army.Douglas Nelms. \\"AgustaWestland ARH-129D Mangusta.\\" Rotor & Wing Magazine, 1 June 2011. In Italian service, the Mangusta has successfully deployed on several United Nations missions in nations such as the Republic of Macedonia, Somalia and Angola. The A-129 proved to be suitable in the peacekeeping role and well-suited to operations in hot climates; the type was reported to have been highly reliable and extremely flexible during the deployment to Somalia.Crawford 2003, p. 18 Three A129 helicopters were deployed in Iraq to provide air support for the Italian forces in Nassiriya. Several A129s have also been stationed in Afghanistan to support in-theatre operations by Italian and allied forces.Kington, Tom. \\"Rotary Combat: U.K. Invests, Germany Cuts, France Debates.\\" Defense News, 7 April 2013. In November 2014, the latest variant of the A129, the AW-129D, was deployed to Afghanistan for the first time.Valpolini, Paolo. \\"Italy deploys latest Mangusta attack helo variant to Afghanistan.\\" IHS Jane's Defence Weekly, 23 November 2014. In January 2015, the Italian Army opted for an enhancement package their existing A129 attack helicopters. The upgrades, which are to enter service prior to 2020, focus on increasing the A129's endurance, speed, situational awareness, and information-handling capabilities; other goals included a reduction in pilot workload and integrating the aircraft with future tactical UAVs. A revealed alternative that was considered and rejected was the replacement of the type with an attack-orientated variant of the newer AgustaWestland AW149 helicopter, upgrading the existing A129s was considered to be less risky and time-consuming.Stevenson, Beth. \\"Italian army describes Mangusta upgrade wish list.\\" Flight International, 22 January 2015. In March 2016, the Italian government announced that it was deploying four A129 attack helicopters and four NHIndustries NH90 transport helicopters along with 130 personnel to the Kurdistan region of Iraq to perform combat search and rescue mission as part of a multinational effort to help combat Islamic State militants within the region and specifically to protect the Mosul Dam.Valpolini, Paolo. \\"Italy to deploy CSAR helicopter force to Iraq.\\" IHS Jane's Defence Weekly, 2 March 2016.Dolamari, Mewan. \\"Italy to send helicopters to Kurdistan Region.\\" Kurdistan 24, 3 March 2016. ==Variants== Agusta A129D Mangusta profile Agusta A129D Mangusta underside ===Production models=== * A129 Mangusta: Original production version, powered by two Rolls- Royce Gem 2 turboshaft engines. * A129 CBT (ComBaT): Upgraded version for the Italian army that incorporates the same advances as the A129 International version, but retains the original Gem turboshaft engines (although an uprated transmission system is fitted). * A129 International: Upgraded version with five-bladed rotor, M197 Gatling cannon in a customized nose turret, support for Hellfire and Stinger missiles, advanced avionics equipment and two LHTEC T800 turboshafts. * T129: (AgustaWestland AW129ATAK Team Announce T129 Maiden Flight) Turkish attack helicopter based on the A129CBT, featuring Turkish avionics and guided missiles. ===Proposed models=== * A129 LBH: A multipurpose assault helicopter version with a new cabin structure completely with space for carrying eight troops in addition to the two crew.

However, most of the children were only separated from their parents or sent purposely in the Savoy mountains which was then under Italian rule. Italy was less oppressive in that time. On 6 April 1944, three vehicles pulled up in front of the orphanage. The Gestapo, under the direction of the 'Butcher of Lyon' Klaus Barbie, entered the orphanage and forcibly removed the forty-four children and their seven supervisors, throwing the crying and terrified children on to the trucks. As a witness later recalled: 'I was on my way down the stairs when my sister shouted to me: It's the Germans, run away! I jumped out the window. I hid myself in a bush in the garden. I heard the cries of the children that were being kidnapped and I heard the shouts of the Nazis who were carrying them away.' Following the raid on their home in Izieu, the children were shipped directly to the \\"collection center\\" in Drancy, then put on the first available train towards the concentration camps in the East. Forty-two children and five adults were gassed in the concentration camp of Auschwitz. Two of the oldest children and Miron Zlatin, the superintendent, ended up in Tallinn, Estonia, and were killed by a firing squad. The orphanage director Sabine Zlatin survived the Gestapo raid, being away collecting funds for the institution. Some 40 years later she testified against Barbie at his trial.

Both the English and scientific names are believed to have originated from indigenous languages. The uakaris are unusual among New World monkeys in that the tail length (15‚Äì18 cm) is substantially less than their head and body length (40‚Äì45 cm). Their bodies are covered with long, loose hair but their heads are bald. They have almost no subcutaneous fat, so their bald faces appear almost skull-like. Like their closest relatives the saki monkeys, they have projecting lower incisors. These monkeys have the most striking red facial skin of any primate. Females choose their mates based on how red the male's face is. Evidence suggests that the red facial coloration reflects the health of the primate. The four species of uakari currently recognized are all found in the north-western Amazon basin. The bald uakari, remarkable for its brilliant scarlet complexion,Wolfe, A. (1997) Primates, San Francisco: Chronicle Books, p. 159 is found north of the Amazon River, and south of the Japur√° River in the Mamirau√° Sustainable Development Reserve. The black-headed uakari is found north of the Amazon and south of the Rio Negro. The Neblina uakari is found north of the Rio Negro, west of the Rio Maraui√° and east of the Casiquiare canal. The Arac√° uakari is currently known only from the Rio Curuduri basin. Uakaris are typically lethargic and silent in zoo conditions, but in the wild they are agile and active, capable of leaps of over 6 meters. They have been observed both in small groups and in larger troops of up to 100. When traveling through the forest they move in the lower branches of the trees, though when foraging they also go up to the canopy. They eat fruit, nuts, buds and leaves. Uakari are found in neotropical Amazon flooded or riparian forests, including Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela. ==Species== There are four species in this genus: * Genus Cacajao ** Bald uakari or red uakari, C. calvus *** Cacajao calvus calvus *** Cacajao calvus ucayalii *** Cacajao calvus rubicundus *** Cacajao calvus novaesi *Black-headed uakari species group ** Golden-backed uakari, Cacajao melanocephalus ** Arac√° uakari, Cacajao ayresi* ** Neblina uakari, Cacajao hosomi* In 2014 Ferrari et al. proposed an alternative taxonomy which recognizes the Arac√° uakari as a subspecies of the golden-backed uakari, and also recognized Cacajao ouakary as a separate species.

It is located to the west of Bukittinggi, at . ==Formation== The Maninjau caldera was formed by a volcanic eruption estimated to have occurred around 52,000 years ago. Deposits from the eruption have been found in a radial distribution around Maninjau extending up to to the east, to the southeast, and west to the present coastline. The deposits are estimated to be distributed over and have a volume of . The caldera has a length of and a width of . ==The lake== Lake Maninjau has an area of , being approximately long and wide. The average depth is , with a maximum depth of . The natural outlet for excess water is the Antokan river, located on the west side of the lake. It is the only lake in Sumatra which has a natural outlet to the west coast. Since 1983, this water has been used to generate hydroelectric power for West Sumatra, generated around 68 MW at maximum load. Most of the people who live around Lake Maninjau are ethnically Minangkabau. Villages on the shores of the lake include Maninjau and Bayur. Maninjau is a notable tourist destination in the region due to its scenic beauty and mild climate. It is also a site for paragliding. ==Local fishing and agriculture== Fisherman on Lake Maninjau Fish embankment in the lake Two endemic species collected from the lake for local consumption and for export to markets outside the crater are pensi, a species of small mussel, and palai rinuak, a type of small fish. One method of preparing palai rinuak is to grill a mixture of the fish along with coconut and spices, wrapped in a banana leaf. The lake is used for aquaculture, using karamba floating net cages. The technique was introduced in 1992 and, by 1997, there were over 2,000 cage units with over 600 households engaged. Each cage may have 3-4 production cycles each year. There is evidence of pollution around some karamba areas. On the edge of the lake, land use includes rice fields in the swamps and the lower slopes. The villages are bordered uphill by a large belt of forest-like tree gardens, which dissolve into the upper montane forest on the steepest parts of the slopes up to the ridge of the caldera. The tree gardens include three typical components: * Fruit trees including durian, jack fruit, cempedak, rambutan, langsat, golden berries and water apples. * Timber species including Toona sinensis and Pterospermum javanicum. * Spice trees including cinnamon, coffee, nutmeg and cardamum. ==Sukarno's pantun== Panorama of Lake Maninjau from the caldera rim The first president of Indonesia, Sukarno, visited the area in early June 1948.

Dupont, written by Arnold Bennett and starring Gilda Gray, Anna May Wong, and Jameson Thomas. The film was filmed on location in London,https://classical- iconoclast.blogspot.com/2010/03/beyond-piccadilly-anna-may- wong.htmlhttps://classical-iconoclast.blogspot.com/2010/04/anna-may-wong- piccadilly-explained.html produced by British International Pictures. This film initially was released as a silent in February 1929; however, with the advent of sound sweeping through the film industry at the time, the studio re- released the film later the same year in June for cinemas wired for sound. This version included a music score and sound effects by Harry Gordon, along with a five-minute sound prologue with Jameson Thomas who plays Valentine Wilmot in the film and John Longden as the man from China, which was filmed after the main filming was completed. The part-sound version initially was shown in the U.S. In 2004, the film was re-released by Milestone Films after an extensive restoration, with music scored by Neil Brand, replacing the original music-and-sound effects soundtrack. It appeared in 2004 at film festivals nationwide, and in 2005, it was released on DVD. ==Plot== Valentine Wilmot's Piccadilly Circus, a nightclub and restaurant in London, is a great success due to his star attraction: dancing partners Mabel (Gilda Gray) and Vic (Cyril Ritchard). One night, a dissatisfied diner (Charles Laughton) disrupts Mabel's solo with his loud complaints about a dirty plate. When Wilmot investigates, he finds Shosho (Anna May Wong) distracting the other dishwashers with her dancing. He fires her on the spot. After the performance, Vic tries to persuade Mabel to become his partner personally as well as professionally and to go to Hollywood with him. She coldly rebuffs him because she is romantically involved with Wilmot. That night, Wilmot summons Vic to his office, and before Wilmot can fire him, Vic quits. This decision turns out to be disastrous for the nightclub. The customers had come to see Vic, not Mabel. Business drops off dramatically. In desperation, Wilmot hires Shosho to perform a Chinese dance. She insists that her boyfriend Jim play the accompanying music. Shosho is an instant sensation, earning a standing ovation after her first performance. Both Mabel and Jim become jealous of the evident attraction between Shosho and Wilmot. Mabel breaks off her relationship with Wilmot. One night, Shosho invites Wilmot to be the first to see her new rooms. Mabel has followed the couple and waits outside. After Wilmot leaves, she persuades Jim to let her in. She pleads with her romantic rival to give Wilmot up, saying he is too old for her, but Shosho replies that it is Mabel who is too old and that she will keep him. When Mabel reaches into her purse for a handkerchief, Shosho sees a pistol inside and grabs a dagger used as a wall decoration. Frightened, Mabel picks up the gun, then faints. The next day, the newspapers report that Shosho has been murdered. Wilmot is charged with the crime. During the ensuing trial, he admits that the pistol is his, but refuses to divulge what happened that night. Jim testifies that Wilmot was Shosho's only visitor. Mabel insists on telling her story. However, she can recall nothing after fainting until she found herself running in the streets. Realizing that either Mabel or Jim must be lying, the judge summons Jim. By then, however, Jim has shot himself at Shosho's mausoleum. As he lies dying, he confesses that he killed Shosho. ==Cast== * Gilda Gray as Mabel Greenfield * Anna May Wong as Shosho * Jameson Thomas as Valentine Wilmot * Charles Laughton as a nightclub diner * Ray Milland as extra in nightclub scene * Cyril Ritchard as Victor Smiles (as Cyrill Ritchard) * King Hou Chang as Jim (as King Ho Chang) * Hannah Jones as Bessie, Shosho's friend and dishwashing supervisor * John Longden as the man from China (uncredited, appears in the sound prologue) ==References* Category:1929 films Category:British black-and-white films Category:British films Category:British silent feature films Category:British crime drama films Category:1929 crime drama films Category:Films shot at Elstree Studios Category:Films directed by E.

For example, a regular pentagon is constructible with compass and straightedge while a regular heptagon is not. There are infinitely many constructible polygons, but only 31 with an odd number of sides are known. ==Conditions for constructibility== Number of sides of known constructible polygons having up to 1000 sides (bold) or odd side count (red) Construction of the regular 17-gon Some regular polygons are easy to construct with compass and straightedge; others are not. The ancient Greek mathematicians knew how to construct a regular polygon with 3, 4, or 5 sides, and they knew how to construct a regular polygon with double the number of sides of a given regular polygon.Bold, Benjamin. Famous Problems of Geometry and How to Solve Them, Dover Publications, 1982 (orig. 1969). This led to the question being posed: is it possible to construct all regular polygons with compass and straightedge? If not, which n-gons (that is polygons with n edges) are constructible and which are not? Carl Friedrich Gauss proved the constructibility of the regular 17-gon in 1796. Five years later, he developed the theory of Gaussian periods in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. This theory allowed him to formulate a sufficient condition for the constructibility of regular polygons. Gauss stated without proof that this condition was also necessary, but never published his proof. A full proof of necessity was given by Pierre Wantzel in 1837. The result is known as the Gauss‚ÄìWantzel theorem: :A regular n-gon (that is, a polygon with n sides) can be constructed with compass and straightedge if and only if n is the product of a power of 2 and any number of distinct Fermat primes (including none). (A Fermat prime is a prime number of the form 2^{(2^m)}+1.) In order to reduce a geometric problem to a problem of pure number theory, the proof uses the fact that a regular n-gon is constructible if and only if the cosine, \\\\cos (2\\\\pi/n), is a constructible number‚Äîthat is, can be written in terms of the four basic arithmetic operations and the extraction of square roots. Equivalently, a regular n-gon is constructible if any root of the nth cyclotomic polynomial is constructible. ===Detailed results by Gauss's theory=== Restating the Gauss- Wantzel theorem: :A regular n-gon is constructible with straightedge and compass if and only if n = 2kp1p2...pt where k and t are non-negative integers, and the pi's (when t > 0) are distinct Fermat primes. The five known Fermat primes are: :F0 = 3, F1 = 5, F2 = 17, F3 = 257, and F4 = 65537 . Since there are 31 combinations of anywhere from one to five Fermat primes, there are 31 known constructible polygons with an odd number of sides. The next twenty-eight Fermat numbers, F5 through F32, are known to be composite.Fermat factoring status by Wilfrid Keller. Thus a regular n-gon is constructible if :n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20, 24, 30, 32, 34, 40, 48, 51, 60, 64, 68, 80, 85, 96, 102, 120, 128, 136, 160, 170, 192, 204, 240, 255, 256, 257, 272, 320, 340, 384, 408, 480, 510, 512, 514, 544, 640, 680, 768, 771, 816, 960, 1020, 1024, 1028, 1088, 1280, 1285, 1360, 1536, 1542, 1632, 1920, 2040, 2048, ... , while a regular n-gon is not constructible with compass and straightedge if :n = 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 49, 50, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 61, 62, 63, 65, 66, 67, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 81, 82, 83, 84, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, ... . ===Connection to Pascal's triangle=== Since there are 5 known Fermat primes, we know of 31 numbers that are products of distinct Fermat primes, and hence 31 constructible odd-sided regular polygons. These are 3, 5, 15, 17, 51, 85, 255, 257, 771, 1285, 3855, 4369, 13107, 21845, 65535, 65537, 196611, 327685, 983055, 1114129, 3342387, 5570645, 16711935, 16843009, 50529027, 84215045, 252645135, 286331153, 858993459, 1431655765, 4294967295 . As John Conway commented in The Book of Numbers, these numbers, when written in binary, are equal to the first 32 rows of the modulo-2 Pascal's triangle, minus the top row, which corresponds to a monogon. (Because of this, the 1s in such a list form an approximation to the Sierpi≈Ñski triangle.) This pattern breaks down after this, as the next Fermat number is composite (4294967297 = 641 √ó 6700417), so the following rows do not correspond to constructible polygons. It is unknown whether any more Fermat primes exist, and it is therefore unknown how many odd-sided constructible regular polygons exist. In general, if there are q Fermat primes, then there are 2q‚àí1 odd-sided regular constructible polygons. ==General theory== In the light of later work on Galois theory, the principles of these proofs have been clarified. It is straightforward to show from analytic geometry that constructible lengths must come from base lengths by the solution of some sequence of quadratic equations.. In terms of field theory, such lengths must be contained in a field extension generated by a tower of quadratic extensions. It follows that a field generated by constructions will always have degree over the base field that is a power of two. In the specific case of a regular n-gon, the question reduces to the question of constructing a length :cos , which is a trigonometric number and hence an algebraic number. This number lies in the n-th cyclotomic field -- and in fact in its real subfield, which is a totally real field and a rational vector space of dimension :¬ΩœÜ(n), where œÜ(n) is Euler's totient function. Wantzel's result comes down to a calculation showing that œÜ(n) is a power of 2 precisely in the cases specified. As for the construction of Gauss, when the Galois group is 2-group it follows that it has a sequence of subgroups of orders :1, 2, 4, 8, ... that are nested, each in the next (a composition series, in group theory terms), something simple to prove by induction in this case of an abelian group. Therefore, there are subfields nested inside the cyclotomic field, each of degree 2 over the one before. Generators for each such field can be written down by Gaussian period theory. For example, for n = 17 there is a period that is a sum of eight roots of unity, one that is a sum of four roots of unity, and one that is the sum of two, which is :cos . Each of those is a root of a quadratic equation in terms of the one before. Moreover, these equations have real rather than complex roots, so in principle can be solved by geometric construction: this is because the work all goes on inside a totally real field. In this way the result of Gauss can be understood in current terms; for actual calculation of the equations to be solved, the periods can be squared and compared with the 'lower' periods, in a quite feasible algorithm. == Compass and straightedge constructions == Compass and straightedge constructions are known for all known constructible polygons. If n = p¬∑q with p = 2 or p and q coprime, an n-gon can be constructed from a p-gon and a q-gon. *If p = 2, draw a q-gon and bisect one of its central angles. From this, a 2q-gon can be constructed. *If p > 2, inscribe a p-gon and a q-gon in the same circle in such a way that they share a vertex. Because p and q are relatively prime, there exists integers a,b such that ap + bq = 1. Then 2aœÄ/q + 2bœÄ/p = 2œÄ/pq. From this, a p¬∑q-gon can be constructed. Thus one only has to find a compass and straightedge construction for n-gons where n is a Fermat prime. *The construction for an equilateral triangle is simple and has been known since Antiquity. See equilateral triangle. *Constructions for the regular pentagon were described both by Euclid (Elements, ca 300 BC), and by Ptolemy (Almagest, ca AD 150). See pentagon. *Although Gauss proved that the regular 17-gon is constructible, he did not actually show how to do it. The first construction is due to Erchinger, a few years after Gauss' work. See heptadecagon. *The first explicit constructions of a regular 257-gon were given by Magnus Georg Paucker (1822) and Friedrich Julius Richelot (1832). *A construction for a regular 65537-gon was first given by Johann Gustav Hermes (1894). The construction is very complex; Hermes spent 10 years completing the 200-page manuscript. ===Gallery=== File:Regular_Pentadecagon_Inscribed_in_a_Circle.gif 257px File:Regular 257-gon Using Carlyle Circle.gif 257px From left to right, constructions of a 15-gon, 17-gon, 257-gon and 65537-gon. Only the first stage of the 65537-gon construction is shown; the constructions of the 15-gon, 17-gon, and 257-gon are given complete. ==Other constructions== The concept of constructibility as discussed in this article applies specifically to compass and straightedge construction. More constructions become possible if other tools are allowed. The so-called neusis constructions, for example, make use of a marked ruler. The constructions are a mathematical idealization and are assumed to be done exactly. A regular polygon with n sides can be constructed with ruler, compass, and angle trisector if and only if n=2^r3^sp_1p_2\\\\cdots p_k, where r, s, k ‚â• 0 and where the pi are distinct Pierpont primes greater than 3 (primes of the form 2^t3^u +1). ==See also== *Polygon *Carlyle circle ==References* Regular Polygon Formulas, Ask Dr. Math FAQ. * Carl Schick: Weiche Primzahlen und das 257-Eck : eine analytische L√∂sung des 257-Ecks.

The Cabot family emigrated from Jersey, where the family name can be traced back to at least 1274. In Jersey, the Rev. George Balleine records that the Cabot is a small fish that seems all head (from Latin caput, \\"head\\"). ===Rise to prominence=== George Cabot, one of John Cabot's grandsons John Cabot (b. 1680 Isle of Jersey) and his son, Joseph Cabot (b. 1720 in Salem), became highly successful merchants, operating a fleet of privateers carrying opium, rum, and slaves. Shipping during the eighteenth century was the lifeblood of most of Boston's first families. Joseph's sons, Joseph Cabot Jr. (b. 1746 in Salem), George Cabot (b. 1752 in Salem), and Samuel Cabot (b. 1758 in Salem), Pg. 192 left Harvard to work their way through shipping, furthering the family fortune and becoming extraordinarily wealthy. Two of the earliest U.S. Supreme Court cases, Bingham v. Cabot (1795) and Bingham v. Cabot (1798), involved family shipping disputes. In 1784, Samuel Cabot relocated to Boston. George Cabot George Cabot and his descendants went into politics. George Cabot became a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, and was appointed but declined to be first Secretary of the Navy. His great-grandson, Henry Cabot Lodge (b. 1850 in Boston) was also a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts from 1893 until his death in 1924. In the 1916 election, Henry Cabot Lodge defeated John F. Fitzgerald, former mayor of Boston and the maternal grandfather of John, Robert and Edward Kennedy. George's great-great-great grandson, Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. (b. 1902 in Nahant) was also U.S. Senator from Massachusetts from 1937 to 1943 and from 1946 to 1953, when he lost to John F. Kennedy in the 1952 Senate election. Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. went on to be the U.S. Ambassador to United Nations under President Eisenhower and ambassador to South Vietnam under President Kennedy. He was 1960 vice presidential candidate for Richard Nixon against Kennedy‚ÄìLyndon B. Johnson. George's other great-great-great grandson, John Davis Lodge (b. 1903 in Washington, D.C.) was the 64th Governor of Connecticut. George's great-great-great-great grandson, George Cabot Lodge II (b. 1927, son of Henry Cabot Lodge) ran against the successful Edward M. Kennedy in the United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 1962. Samuel Cabot Godfrey Lowell Cabot, one of John Cabot's great-great- great grandsons From John Cabot's grandson, Samuel Cabot's side, Samuel Cabot Jr. (b. 1784 in Boston) furthered the family fortune by combining the first family staples of working in shipping and marrying money. In 1812, he married Eliza Perkins, daughter of merchant king Colonel Thomas Perkins. Samuel Cabot III (b. 1815 in Boston) was an eminent surgeon, whose daughter, Lilla Cabot Perry, was a noted Impressionist artist, and son, Godfrey Lowell Cabot (b. 1861 in Boston) founded Cabot Corporation, the largest carbon black producer in the country, used for inks and paints. Godfrey's son, John Moors Cabot (b. 1901 in Cambridge), a great-great-grandson of Samuel, was a U.S. Ambassador to Sweden, Colombia, Brazil, and Poland during the Eisenhower and Kennedy administration. Another great-great grandson, Paul Codman Cabot (b. 1898Pg. 21‚Äì23 in Brookline), was cofounder of America's first mutual fund and \\"Harvard's [Endowment] Midas.\\" ===Boston Toast=== The widely known \\"Boston Toast\\" by Holy Cross alumnus John Collins Bossidy features the Cabot family: == Kabotchnik v. Cabot == In 1923, Harry H. Kabotchnik and his wife Myrtle petitioned to have his family name changed to Cabot. Some prominent Cabots of Boston (Judge Cabot of the Boston Juvenile Court; Stephen Cabot, Headmaster of St. George's School, Middletown, R.I.; Dr. Hugh Cabot, Dean of Michigan University Medical School) along with the Pennsylvania branch of the Order of Founder and Patriots, the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, and the Genealogical Society of Pennsylvania counter-sued to prevent the change.

It is approximately in area, and is operated by the East Bay Regional Park District. It includes the Dotson Family Marsh (formerly Breuner Marsh) and the Point Pinole Lagoon and hosts the North Richmond Shoreline Festival.North Richmond Shoreline Festival ==History== Point Pinole is located in the city of Richmond, California. It is on the site of a number of former explosives factories; the largest of these was operated by the Giant Powder Company, which was relocated to this relatively remote spot following accidental explosions at its former sites in San Francisco and at Albany Hill. Giant had built the first dynamite manufacturing plant in the United States at a site known as Glen Canyon Park, which started up on March 19, 1868. On November 26, 1869, there was an explosion that destroyed every building on the site (including the fence around the plant). The plant was forced to move farther away from heavily populated areas. Another explosion occurred at the Albany Hill plant in 1892, before Giant built its last plant in the lightly populated area of Pinole Point. Giant created a small unincorporated community, which it named Giant, California. Later, the Giant community became the established Croatian community of Sobrante.\\"Listed California Historical Resources No. 1002-1.

Accessed September 4, 2017.\\"Listed California Historical Resources No. 1002.\\" California State Parks. Office of Historical Preservation. 1917. Accessed September 4, 2017. Although the Point Pinole factory operated until 1960, when Bethlehem Steel Company acquired the Atlas Powder Company and its assets, little trace of it now remains. After several years, the East Bay Regional Park District succeeded and opened the property to the public as a park in 1973. A plaque denotes the site as a California Historical Landmark. The facility's former tramway grades provide a network of nearly of gently sloping paths for hiking, cycling and horse-riding. The other relic of the park's industrial past is the large number of eucalyptus glades groves which were planted around the factory site to buffer against potential explosions. The park features the promontory of Point Pinole, located where the East Bay shoreline turns from running south towards Berkeley and Oakland to running eastwards, inland. Geologically, it is a result of movement on the Hayward Fault which runs along its western edge, creating a low scarp. It offers superb views across the bay in all directions, towards San Francisco to the southwest, Mount Tamalpais and the Marin Headlands to the northwest, inland across San Pablo Bay to the north and east, and Mt. Diablo inland to the southeast. Fresh and ocean waters mix at this point, so the marine life is rich; a leisure pier has been built at the end of promontory, replacing a former jetty used by the factories, and is a popular location for angling. The parks trails are almost level allowing for easy walks. There is a $3 parking fee and a $2 per dog fee.Bean, Krysten. \\"Patch Picks Ideas for a Less Crowded Memorial Day Weekend.\\" El Cerrito Patch. May 26, 2011.

It is located on the Pacific Flyway, so many migrant species are also seen. The marsh provides habitat for several creatures, including the ridgeway rail and the salt marsh harvest mouse. Whittell Marsh is the site of one of the few remaining Native American shellmounds in the San Francisco Bay Area.\\"Whittell Marsh Shellmound\\", Bay Area Native Sites, retrieved October 10, 2018. The park is located on the Hayward Fault, whose exact position is marked by monuments erected by the United States Geological Survey. The USGS has a seismometer posted along the Union Pacific Railroad, which divides the park from the mainland; the park is reached via a bridge across the railroad. The San Francisco Bay Trail runs through the park. The park can be reached by the AC Transit bus service, by car, or by bicycle. Pedestrian and cyclist admission is free, but there is a parking fee. ==Recent construction projectsPlayground area=== The playground at Point Pinole park was temporarily closed for construction from mid-August through October, 2017. During this time, the playground was resurfaced with wood fiber, equipment replaced with a net climber and a stand- up spinner, and a wheelchair-accessible path and picnic tables was added. All park paths remained open to the public during this work. ===Atlas Road Bridge=== On April 22, 2017, EBRPD dedicated the Atlas Road Bridge, a combination vehicle and wheelchair-compliant pedestrian bridge that connects to the San Francisco Bay Trail. This activity included building a new main entrance and parking area. The new entrance provides a bridge over active railroad tracks, which had been a hazard for pedestrians approaching the park from the parking lot. The project cost $11.7 million, which was largely funded by local bond Measure CC, the City of Richmond and grants from the following grantors: * California State Parks * California Natural Resources Agency * Contra Costa Transportation Authority The new bridge is part of a multi-phase project that will eventually lead to additional picnic areas, a new playground and the route to a new interpretive center for the park. ===Dotson Family Marsh=== At the same ceremony in April 2017, EBRPD also renamed and dedicated Breuner Marsh as the Dotson Family Marsh, honoring a family led by Reverend Richard Dotson, who had worked for many years to keep Breuner Marsh wild and open to the public, opposing several attempts to develop the tract for commercial ventures. Rev. Dotson was able to organize residents of his own neighborhood in Richmond, Parchester, reminding them that the builder of their houses had promised they would always have access to the bay. He also recruited the Sierra Club as an influential ally in the three-decade legal fight against the developers. Dotson's group prevailed, and EBRPD acquires the marsh through eminent domain in March 2008. The district then attached the marsh to Point Pinole Regional Shoreline.Alvarez, Ana M. and Erich Pfueler. \\"Preserving a Marsh for People and Wildlife: The Dotson Family Marsh.\\" Parks & Recreation.

He was Minister of Foreign Affairs of Algeria from 1991 to 1993. He is also a member of The Elders, a group of world leaders working for global peace. Brahimi is a member of the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor, the first global initiative to focus specifically on the link between exclusion, poverty and law. He has also been a Member of the Global Leadership Foundation since 2008, an organization which works to promote good governance around the world. He is currently a distinguished senior fellow at the Centre for the Study of Global Governance at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and a governing board member of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. He relinquished his post as UN Special Envoy to Syria on 31 May 2014. ==Early life and education== Brahimi was born in 1934 in El Azizia near Tablat, Algeria, about 60 km south of Algiers. He was educated in Algeria and in France where he studied law and political science. He joined the campaign for independence in 1956. Based in Jakarta for five years, he was the representative of the National Liberation Front (Algeria) in South East Asia, touring the region in search of diplomatic support. ==Career== Brahimi (right) as the Algerian Ambassador to Egypt, shaking hands with Gamal Abdel Nasser, the Egyptian President, after presenting his credentials to the president, April 1963 Brahimi (left) as United Nations special mission to Afghanistan, visit President Mohammad Khatami, August 4, 2003 Brahimi was the United Nations special representative for Afghanistan and Iraq. Before his appointment in 2001 by the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, he had served the U.N. as special representative to Haiti and to South Africa. Before coming to the U.N., Brahimi, who represented the National Liberation Front in Tunis during Algeria's independence movement in 1956‚Äì1961, was an Arab League official (1984‚Äì1991) and the Algerian Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1991 until 1993. Brahimi was also chair of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations, which produced the influential Brahimi Report. On a visit to Baghdad in April 2004 to help determine how and when Iraqi elections can be held, he said that the recent violence threatened to delay Iraqi national assembly elections‚Äîthe national assembly is to pick the president and write a constitution. : \\"The elections scheduled to take place in January 2005 are the most important milestone,\\" Brahimi said. \\"There is no substitute for the legitimacy that comes from free and fair elections.\\" (Witter, 2004) Brahimi suggested that the Iraq Interim Governing Council should be dissolved, and that most of its members should not have any role in the new government. Though the council was in fact dissolved early, some of its members will have major roles in the new government. The president, one of the two vice- presidents, and the prime minister are all from the council. Most prominently, his criticism of Ahmed Chalabi has led to Chalabi's claim that Brahimi is an Arab nationalist who should have no role in determining the future of Iraq. At the same time, close allies of Chalabi have been pushing claims that various world leaders and the UN took bribes from Saddam Hussein under the Oil for Food program. In May 2004, Brahimi was supposed to play a large advisory role in the appointment of candidates, which ended up selecting as Iraq's new interim President and Prime Minister: Ghazi Mashal Ajil al-Yawer and Iyad Allawi, respectively. However, Brahimi expressed serious disappointment and frustration about his role. \\"Bremer is the dictator of Iraq, He has the money. He has the signature. ...

Sound cards and modems are the most common devices to use the specification. ACR and other riser cards lower hardware costs by offloading much of the computing tasks of the peripheral to the CPU. ACR uses a 120 pin PCI connector which is reversed and offset, retaining backward compatibility with 46 pin AMR cards while including support for newer technologies. It is also more cost-effective and simple for the manufacturer, since the connectors are identical to the PCI connectors already purchased in quantity. New features supported by ACR include standards for an EEPROM for storing model and vendor information, USB support, and the Integrated Packet Bus for digital subscriber line (DSL), cable modem, and wireless networking support. ==History== The ACR specification was created by the Advanced Communications Riser Special Interest Group (ACR SIG) in 2000 with the intent to replace the AMR specification. Because it was backwards compatible with AMR cards, and technically superior, it quickly replaced it.

The population was 52,860 at the 2010 Census. ==History== During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Morotai was generally within the sphere of influence of the powerful sultanate on the island of Ternate. It was the core of a larger region, called Moro, that included the island and the coastline of Halmahera closest to Morotai to the south. In the mid-sixteenth century, the island was also the site of a Portuguese Jesuit mission. The Muslim states on Ternate and Halmahera resented the outpost for its proselytising activities, and managed to drive the mission from the island in 1571, as a part of a larger Portuguese retreat in the region. In the seventeenth century, Ternate further exerted its power over Morotai by repeatedly forcing major parts of the population to move off the island. Early in the century most of the population was moved to Dodinga, a small town in a strategic spot on Halmahera's west coast. Later, in 1627 and 1628, Sultan Hamzah of Ternate had much of the Christian population of the island moved to Malayu, on Ternate, where they could be more easily controlled. ===World War II=== The island was captured by the Japanese in early 1942. Morotai's southern plain was taken by American forces in September 1944 during the Battle of Morotai, and used as a staging point for the Allied invasion of the Philippines in early 1945, and of Borneo in May and June of that year. Japanese soldier Teruo Nakamura was discovered in the Morotai jungle in 1974, as one of the World War II Japanese soldiers who held out subsequent to the Japanese military's surrender. ===Post-independence=== Morotai became its own regency in 2008, separating from the North Halmahera Regency. ==Geography== Morotai is a rugged, forested island lying to the north of Halmahera. It has an area of some , stretching north-south and no more than wide. The regency's largest town is Daruba, on the island's south coast. Almost all of Morotai's numerous villages are coastal settlements; a paved road linking those on the east coast starts from Daruba and will eventually reach Berebere, the principal town on Morotai's east coast, from Daruba. == Administration == The regency is divided into five districts (kecamatan), tabulated below with their areas and their 2010 Census populations. { class=\\"sortable \\" - !

During the 19th century, it was responsible for synchronizing clocks across the world. It was headed during this time by Fran√ßois Arago and Henri Poincar√©. The Bureau now functions as an academy and still meets monthly to discuss topics related to astronomy. The Bureau was founded by the National Convention after it heard a report drawn up jointly by the Committee of Navy, the Committee of Finances and the Committee of State education. Henri Gr√©goire had brought to the attention of the National Convention France's failing maritime power and the naval mastery of England, proposing that improvements in navigation would lay the foundations for a renaissance in naval strength. As a result, the Bureau was established with authority over the Paris Observatory and all other astronomical establishments throughout France. The Bureau was charged with taking control of the seas away from the English and improving accuracy when tracking the longitudes of ships through astronomical observations and reliable clocks. The ten original members of its founding board were: *Joseph-Louis Lagrange, geometer; *Pierre-Simon Laplace, geometer; *Joseph J√©r√¥me Lefran√ßais de Lalande, astronomer; *Pierre M√©chain, astronomer; *Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre, astronomer; *Dominique, comte de Cassini, astronomer; *Jean-Charles de Borda, Navy officer; *Jean-Nicolas Buache, geographer; *Louis Antoine de Bougainville, Navy officer; *No√´l Simon Caroch√©, manufacturer of telescopes. By a decree of 30 January 1854, the Bureau's mission was extended to embrace geodesy, time standardisation and astronomical measurements. This decree granted independence to the Paris Observatory, separating it from the Bureau, and focused the efforts of the Bureau on time and astronomy. The Bureau was successful at setting a universal time in Paris via air pulses sent through pneumatic tubes. It later worked to synchronize time across the French colonial empire by determining the length of time for a signal to make a round trip to and from a French colony. The French Bureau of Longitude established a commission in the year 1897 to extend the metric system to the measurement of time. They planned to abolish the antiquated division of the day into hours, minutes, and seconds, and replace it by a division into tenths, thousandths, and hundred-thousandths of a day. This was a revival of a dream that was in the minds of the creators of the metric system at the time of the French Revolution a hundred years earlier. Some members of the Bureau of Longitude commission introduced a compromise proposal, retaining the old-fashioned hour as the basic unit of time and dividing it into hundredths and ten-thousandths. Poincar√© served as secretary of the commission and took its work very seriously, writing several of its reports. He was a fervent believer in a universal metric system. But he lost the battle. The rest of the world outside France gave no support to the commission's proposals, and the French government was not prepared to go it alone. After three years of hard work, the commission was dissolved in 1900. Since 1970, the board has been constituted with 13 members, 3 nominated by the Acad√©mie des Sciences. Since 1998, practical work has been carried out by the Institut de m√©canique c√©leste et de calcul des √©ph√©m√©rides. ==Publications== *Connaissance des temps, astronomical ephemerides, published annually since 1679; *Annuaire du Bureau des longitudes, almanac and calendar for public and civil use, published annually since 1795; *√âph√©m√©rides nautiques, (from 1889) for marine navigation; *√âph√©m√©rides a√©ronautiques, (from 1938) for civil and military aerial navigation. *Proc√®s-verbaux du Bureau des longitudes ==See also== * Institut de m√©canique c√©leste et de calcul des √©ph√©m√©rides ==References== *Bureau Des Longitudes (French) * Galison, Peter Louis (2003).

It served as the basis for a film in 1977 and a play in 2004. ==Inspiration== The character of Dr. Fried is based closely on Greenberg's real doctor Frieda Fromm-Reichmann, and the hospital on Chestnut Lodge in Rockville, Maryland. While at Chestnut Lodge, Greenberg described a fantasy world called Iria to her doctors, quoting poetry in the Irian language. However, some of Greenberg's doctors felt that this was not a true delusion but rather something Greenberg had made up on the spot to impress her psychiatrist. One doctor went so far as to state that Irian was not an actual language, but was a form of bastardized Armenian.\\"Alberta Szalitza, who had seen Joanne in a series of strikingly unsuccessful sessions during Frieda's vacation, was far less taken with Greenberg's creativity. She insisted to colleagues that Irian wasn't really a language, just \\"a poor set-up of some words that were similar to Armenian\\" that Greenberg had put together from having had Armenian friends. Szalitza seemed irritated that Frieda ignored the fact that Joanne translated the same words differently on different days and showed other inconsistencies in her use of this so-called language (minutes of staff meetings; Szalitza interview).\\" Gail Hornstein, To Redeem One Person Is To Redeem The World: A Life of Frieda Fromm-Reichmann (Free Press 2002), pp. 425-426. Fromm-Reichmann wrote glowing reports focusing on Greenberg's genius and creativity, which she saw as signs of Greenberg's innate health, indicating that she had every chance of recovering from her mental illness. Similar to what occurred in the novel, Greenberg was diagnosed with schizophrenia. At that time though, undifferentiated schizophrenia was often a vague diagnosis given to a patient or to medical records department for essentially non-medical reasons, which could have covered any number of mental illnesses from anxiety to depression. Two psychiatrists who examined the description of Blau in the book say that she was not schizophrenic, but rather suffered from extreme depression and somatization disorder. ==See also== *I Never Promised You a Rose Garden (film) *I Never Promised You a Rose Garden (play) ==References== ==External links== * Biography of Frieda Fromm-Reichmann, with much information on Greenberg and her stay at Chestnut Lodge. *A 1995 lecture by Joanne Greenberg, exemplifying her personal style. *Appearances in a Rosegarden 2006 interview with Greenberg (free registration required) Category:1964 American novels Category:American autobiographical novels Category:American novels adapted into films Category:English-language books Category:Fictional portrayals of schizophrenia Category:American novels adapted into plays Category:Works published under a pseudonym ","title":"I Never Promised You a Rose Garden (novel)"}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function H(s,a,i,c,u,n){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâLife Quotesü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",R,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(n.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const D=d(I,[["render",H]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/63.md","filePath":"guide/63.md"}'),L={name:"guide/63.md"},E=Object.assign(L,{setup(s){return(a,i)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(D)]))}});export{F as __pageData,E as default};
