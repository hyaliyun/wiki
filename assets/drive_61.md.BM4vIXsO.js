He was also the only Polish–Lithuanian member of the Taryba, the provisional Lithuanian parliament formed in the later stages of World War I. ==Biograph == The Narutowicz family, which had its roots in Lithuanian nobility, received a coat of arms in 1413, changing its name from Noručiai (singular Norutis) to Narutowicz in the process. He was a self- declared Samogitian, Lithuanian and a Pole. His parents, Jan Narutowicz and Wiktoria née Szczepkowska were landowners and ran a manor. His father took part in the January Uprising of 1863, which was a revolt that took place in the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth against Tsarist oppression. While studying at the Liepāja Gymnasium and later at the St. Petersburg University, he collected Lithuanian folklore and distributed Lithuanian language books whenever he returned home on his vacations. He graduated from the faculty of law at Kiev University. During his studies in Kiev, Narutowicz joined the Polish circle of students and became a member of the II Proletaryat, an underground socialist-revolutionary party and the predecessor of the Polish Socialist Party. However, his beliefs were much less radical than those of his colleagues, and with time his contacts with the far left weakened. Early in his life Narutowicz married Joanna née Billewicz, owner of the Brėvikai manor and a cousin of Józef Piłsudski. After 1907, the couple created and maintained a secondary school for girls in Telšiai. It was the first such school for girls in Russian-held Lithuania where teaching in Lithuanian and Polish was permitted. In the period preceding World War I Narutowicz published articles in various Polish-language newspapers. He also was the publisher of the first issues of the Tygodnik Powszechny weekly. The couple were also involved in several educational programs whose goal was increasing learning skills among the Lithuanian peasants, and their children who inhabited the area. ==Politician== As a politician, Narutowicz was a mild socialist or a social- democrat. He was a supporter of independence of Lithuania rather than of restoring a Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, mostly from fear that the far more populous Poland would gain the upper hand in such a union. On the other hand, he supported a loose union between the states, which made him one of the leaders of the krajowcy movement, a group of Polish Lithuanians loyal to the legacy of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and supporting reconciliation of divided loyalties of local Poles between Poland and Lithuania. In his vision, the Polish minority in Lithuania would gain a status similar to the Walloons in Belgium: with separate culture and language, but united with Lithuanians by what he called \\"state patriotism\\". At the same time he also supported close ties between the nations formerly constituting the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and took part in various Polish-Lithuanian-Belarusian enterprises. At the 1905 Great Seimas of Vilnius, he suggested that all estates be disbanded and the land distributed amongst poorer peasants. It was a quite unexpected proposal for most of the deputies. During the 1917 Vilnius Conference he stated his primary goal as \\"An independent Lithuania within ethnic Lithuanian lands\\". In September 1917 Narutowicz joined the Council of Lithuania (Lietuvos Taryba), a Lithuanian governing body established by the Germans as part of their Mitteleuropa plan, yet largely independent and striving for establishment of Lithuania as an independent state. As a member of that body, Narutowicz became one of twenty signatories of the Act of Independence of Lithuania. However, following the conflicts within the Taryba he took a more anti-German stance than most of his colleagues. After the body asked the government of Germany for protection and help and vowed for a stable and strong alliance with the German Reich, Narutowicz protested. When, on 26 January 1918, 12 of the Taryba's members voted for compromise with Germany, Narutowicz and three of his social-democratic colleagues (Steponas Kairys, Jonas Vileišis and Mykolas Biržiška) resigned their posts. Lithuania and Poland came into increasing intense conflicts in the years that followed. Narutowicz continued to actively support a rapprochement but met with little success. ==Death and legacy== Narutowicz committed suicide on 31 December 1932 in Kaunas. The Polish historian Krzysztof Buchowski of the University of Białystok attributes his suicide to alienation resulting from the futility of his endeavors, denounced on both sides of the border, as well as to the increasingly hostile stance of the Lithuanian government towards the Polish minority in Lithuania. His biography published by the National Museum of Lithuania attributes his suicide to depression, family issues, and economic hardship. Narutowicz's son Kazimierz Narutowicz (1904–1987) was also an activist in the interwar period, engaged in the issue of Polish-Lithuanian relations. Narutowicz's widow continued to run various schools in Lithuania, notably the Polish gymnasium in Kaunas. After the outbreak of World War II she retired to her manor in Brėvikiai, but left the Lithuanian SSR for Warsaw, where she died in 1948. ==Notes and references== ==External links== * Bio in Lithuanian Category:1862 births Category:1932 deaths Category:People from Telšiai District Municipality Category:People from Telshevsky Uyezd Category:Members of the Council of Lithuania Category:Independence activists Category:Lithuanian lawyers Category:20th-century Lithuanian lawyers Category:Lithuanian book smugglers Category:Jurists who committed suicide Category:Male suicides Category:Suicides by firearm in Lithuania ","title":"Stanisław Narutowicz"},{"id":"2561361","text":"Warrigal Creek is a creek and area in Gippsland, Victoria, Australia. It is known as the site of massacres of Aboriginal people in 19th-century colonial Victoria. ==Massacre== In July 1843, a man named Ronald Macallister was killed by Aboriginal men near Port Albert. The Scottish colonist and pastoralist, Angus McMillan, led a group of around 20 colonists to attack and kill several groups of Aboriginal people across a number of days. The group was known as the \\"Highland Brigade\\". Some historical accounts assert that around 60 people were killed, but other survivors said the number was 150–180. Some historians claim that the number of 60 is an exaggeration, despite the witness accounts. The statistical discrepancies likely emerged because Macmillan's group killed Aboriginal people at five different locations in the area. A witness, Willy Hoddinott, wrote the following in 1925: > \\"The brigade coming up to the blacks camped around the Waterhole at Warrigal > Creek surrounded them and fired into them, killing a great number, some > escaped into the scrub, others jumped into the waterhole, and, as fast as > they put their heads up for breath, they were shot until the water was red > with blood.

He was hit in the > eye by a slug, captured by the whites, and made to lead the 'brigade' from > one camp to another.\\" Hoddinott said that more than 100 Aboriginal people were killed on that day. Historian Peter Gardner, in a review of all accounts of the massacre, wrote that MacMillan and the Highland Brigade aimed to wipe out all the Aboriginal people in the area. Gardner concludes that McMillan's group initially killed two family groups at Warrigal Creek waterhole and then a few days later killed another 60 people at the mouth of Warrigal Creek, then killing three other groups at Freshwater Creek, Gammon Creek, and Red Hill. ==See also== * Gunai * Gippsland massacres ==References== ==Bibliography== * The Book of the Bush * \\"The Settling of Gippsland - A Regional History\\", by Patrick Morgan, published by Gippsland Municipalities Association, Traralgon, 1997 * Gardner, Peter, 'The Warrigal Creek massacre', Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society, pp. 47–51, June, 1980. ==Further reading== * * Category:History of Victoria (Australia) Category:Conflicts in 1843 Category:Crime in Victoria (Australia) Category:Massacres of Indigenous Australians ","title":"Warrigal Creek"},{"id":"2561371","text":"Lin Xiangru () was a politician of the Warring States period, who served the state of Zhao. He figures prominently in two stories of the period, namely the episode and the namesake chengyu of \\"Returning the Jade to Zhao\\" (), as well as the story and the namesake chengyu of \\"Carrying Thorned Grass and Pleading Guilt\\" (). ==Background== Lin Xiangru was born sometime in the reign of King Wuling of Zhao. Due to his intellect and superior skills, he rose quickly through the ranks of the Zhao bureaucracy. ==Returning the Jade to Zhao== Emissaries from the King of Qin came over to the Zhao court one day, offering to exchange fifteen cities for the sacred Heshibi jade disk. At this stage of the Warring States period, Qin was the most powerful state, making it difficult to decline. On the other hand, the Kings of Qin had historically been untrustworthy, and King Huiwen of Zhao did not trust the King of Qin to keep his side of the bargain. Lin Xiangru volunteered to go to the Qin court with the He Shi Bi, promising to trade the jade for the cities if the King of Qin kept his word, and to return the jade safely if he did not. At the Qin court, the King of Qin passed the He Shi Bi among his ministers and concubines, making no mention of the promised 15 cities. Lin concluded that the King of Qin was not intending to keep his word. He tricked the King of Qin by claiming that there was a tiny flaw in the jade, and when the King of Qin returned the jade to him so that he could point out the flaw, Lin threatened to smash both the jade and his head (i.e. commit suicide) against a pillar if the King of Qin tried to take it back by force. He demanded the King of Qin fast for three days and receive him with proper ceremonies before surrendering the jade. The Qin king, unwilling to see the jade ruined, agreed. That night, still not trusting the King of Qin, Lin ordered his henchman to take the jade back to Zhao in secret; he himself would stay in Qin and face the King. Three days later, the King of Qin was furious that the jade had been returned to Zhao. However, unwilling to execute a Zhao diplomat, he could do nothing but let Lin go. The incident made Lin famous throughout the Warring States as the man who had shamed the Qin king. His status rose and soon he was chief minister of Zhao. ==Carrying Thorned Grass and Pleading Guilt== Many people were jealous of Lin's meteoric rise, most notably the old general Lian Po, one of the most experienced commanders during that time. Lian Po was so jealous that he swore enmity between the two of them. When Lin had caught wind of this, he decided that the best way to deal with the problem was to not confront Lian at all. In one incident, Lian's and Lin's carriage met on a narrow road. Lin, as the higher-ranking minister, normally had right of passage; however, he turned and backed out of the street in order to let Lian pass. Many saw it as a sign of weakness, not least Lian Po himself, who reckoned that Lin, an academic, was too scared to fight such a warrior as he. Lin's courtiers, too, grew dissatisfied by the subservient way Lin was behaving, and many left. But when Lin's chief courtier demanded to know why he was behaving in such a manner, Lin Xiangru replied: \\"The feud between me and Lian Po is a personal one; but I am in charge of the nation's government, and he the nation's security: I cannot let my personal life ruin that of the kingdom!\\" When Lian Po finally heard of this, all his jealousy turned into shame. Deciding to apologize to Lin, he strapped brambles to his bare back and walked from his house to that of Lin Xiangru's, begging for his forgiveness. Lin Xiangru forgave him, and from then on, they became good friends. The alliance between chief minister and general kept Zhao peaceful for years. ==Subsequent events== When Lian Po was on the verge of being replaced as overall commander in the Battle of Changping by the much younger and much more inexperienced Zhao Kuo, Lin Xiangru begged King Xiaocheng of Zhao to reconsider the decision. However, his advice was not heeded, and disaster followed. Lin Xiangru died probably in the years between Changping and the annexation of Zhao by Qin. ==Legacy== *Sima Xiangru, a poet during the western Han Dynasty, named himself after Lin Xiangru as a result of having fostered great admiration for the latter during his studies. ==Popular culture== Lin Xiangru is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI by Koei. Lin Xiangru also appears in the manga Kingdom as one of Zhao's \\"three great heavens\\" alongside Lian Po (Ren Pa) and Zhao She (Chou Sha) under his Japanese name \\"Rin Shou Jo\\", fostering a friendly rivalry with the former. He died early in his career, and most of his retainers went down performing suicide charges, stricken by grief, except for two who stayed at his deathbed. Many years later, the remaining two joined their master after being killed. Lin Xiangru is portrayed by Tan Yang in the last episode of The Legend of Mi Yue (2015) as a guest appearance, depicting the \\"Returning the Jade to Zhao\\" incident. == References == Category:Chinese chancellors Category:Zhou dynasty people Category:3rd-century BC Chinese people Category:Zhao (state) ","title":"Lin Xiangru"},{"id":"2561374","text":"Shostka () is a city in Sumy Oblast in the north-east of Ukraine.

Though he never attended university he ultimately acquired a thorough knowledge of Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Syriac, French and German. In 1824 he was placed on the Wesleyan Methodist plan as a local preacher. In 1826 his offer to enter the ministry was accepted, and after the usual probationary trial he was received into full connection at the conference of 1831. For two years after this he remained at Brighton, and in 1833 he removed to Cornwall, being stationed successively at the Truro and Falmouth circuits. From Falmouth he removed to Darlaston, where in 1838 his health gave way. For a good many years he was a supernumerary, and lived for a while at Caen and Paris, where in the public libraries he found great facilities for prosecuting his favorite Oriental studies. His health having considerably improved, he became, in 1843, pastor of the Methodist church at Boulogne-sur-Mer. He returned to England in 1847, and was appointed successively to the circuits of Islington, Bristol, Leeds, Penzance, Penryn, Truro and St Austell in east Cornwall. Shortly after his return to England he received the degree of Ph.D. from the University of Heidelberg. He was a patient, modest, hard-working and accurate scholar.

She was popular in the Middle Ages, especially in the Netherlands, as the patron saint of sickness. ==Historical background== Both the Latin and Greek Churches mention a holy martyr Juliana in their lists of saints. The oldest historical notice of her is found in the Martyrologium Hieronymianum for 16 February, her place of birth being given as Cumae in Campania (\\"In Campania Cumbas, natale Julianae\\"). It is true that the reference is contained only in the single chief manuscript of the above-named martyrology (the Codex Epternacensis). It is nevertheless clear that the notice is certainly authentic, from a letter of Saint Gregory the Great, which testifies to the special veneration of Saint Juliana in the neighbourhood of Naples. A pious matron named Januaria built a church on one of her estates, for the consecration of which she desired relics (sanctuaria, that is to say, objects which had been brought into contact with the graves) of Saints Severin and Juliana. Gregory wrote to Fortunatus II, Bishop of Naples, telling him to accede to the wishes of Januaria.\\"Gregorii Magni epist.\\", lib. IX, ep. ####\\", in J. P. Migne's Patrologia Latina, LXXXVII, 1015. Her life is listed in the BHG #963; BHL##4522-4527 ==The legend== According to, the Acts of Saint Juliana used by Bede in his \\"Martyrologium\\" are purely legendary. According to this account, Saint Juliana, daughter of an illustrious pagan named Africanus, was born in Nicomedia; and as a child was betrothed to the Senator Eleusius, one of the emperor's advisors. Her father was hostile to the Christians. Juliana secretly accepted holy baptism. When the time of her wedding approached, Juliana refused to be married. Her father urged her not to break her engagement, but when she refused to obey him, he handed her over to the Governor, her former fiancé. Elusius again asked Juliana to marry him, but she again refused. Juliana was beheaded after suffering torture in 304, during the persecution of Maximian. Another Christian named Barbara suffered the death of a martyr along with Juliana and was likewise sainted. Soon after a noble lady named Sephonia came through Nicomedia and took the saint's body with her to Italy, and had it buried in Campania. Evidently it was this alleged translation that caused the martyred Juliana, honoured in Nicomedia, to be identified with the Saint Juliana of Cumae evidenced above, although they are quite distinct persons. ==Alternate account== Juliana’s parents were pagans and they wanted to betroth her with Eleusius, a prominent officer from Antioch, but Juliana denied strongly. Her denial left her parents surprised because until then she had never opposed them and she was an obedient daughter. Eleusius' ego was sorely injured and he sought revenge. He made some queries and found out that Juliana had converted to Christianity, though her parents knew nothing about this. Eleusius impeached her before the Roman governor and as a result she was arrested and put in jail. While she was in prison, efforts to make her the wife of Eleusius continued, in order to save her from execution, but Juliana preferred to die rather than have a pagan as a husband. Then Eleusius after being ordered by the Roman governor and filled with hate flogged her in a ruthless way. After that, he burned her face with a heated iron and said at her, \\"Go now at the mirror to see your beauty\\". Juliana answered him with a light smile: \\"At the resurrection of the righteous, there won’t exist burnings and wounds but only the soul. So Eleusius, I prefer to have now the wounds of the body which are temporary, rather than the wounds of the soul which torture eternal.\\" After a while, Juliana was beheaded. Eleusius was later eaten by a lion, when he was shipwrecked on an unknown island. ==Later history== An icon depicting Saints Paraskevi of Iconium, Barbara and Juliana. The veneration of Saint Juliana of Nicomedia became very widespread, especially in the Netherlands. She became known as the patron saint of sickness. At the beginning of the 13th century her remains were transferred to Naples. The description of this translation by a contemporary writer is still extant. The feast of the saint is celebrated in the Latin Church on 16 February, in the Greek on 21 December. Since her Acts describe the conflicts which she is said to have with the devil, she is represented in pictures with a winged devil whom she leads by a chain. She is also shown enduring various tortures or fighting a dragon. St. Juliana is the subject of an Anglo-Saxon poem, believed to have been written by Cynewulf in the eighth century. ==See also== * Saint Juliana of Nicomedia, patron saint archive ==References== ==Sources== *Mombritius, Sanctuarium, II, fol. 41 v.-43 v.; *Acta SS., FEB., II, 808 sqq.; *J.

The Antiquities of Scotland. High Holborn : Hooper and Wigstead. V. 2. The castle consisted of two distinct parts; a keep of an irregular shape on the top of a precipitous rock and other buildings at a lower level. The keep walls are about five feet thick and the vaults on the basement are well preserved, however most of the superstructure is entirely demolished. The keep represents the original castle, much altered. The central portion of the castle may be 15th century and was intended to form a defence to the access into the keep. The additional buildings are of a later date and contain two kitchens on the ground level, one for the castle and the other for the retainers. To the north-east stands a detached wall which may have led to a gateway. A drawbridge may have stood nearby and the chapel may have been located against the thick wall of the central part of the castle. A moat or fosse protected the approach and a wall may have also existed. In the 1990s excavations showed that a hall house was built across the 13th century court in the 14th century.Salter, Mike (2009). The Castles of South-West Scotland. Malvern : Folly. . p. 41 Beneath the castle is a cavern, called the Browney's Cave which may have been a sally-port; a secret tunnel leading to the castle.Grose, Francis (1797). The Antiquities of Scotland. High Holborn : Hooper and Wigstead. p. 196. In 1429 a meeting took place at Dunure between James Campbell, representing King James I of Scotland and John Mor MacDonald, representing the Lord of the Isles. Violence broke out and MacDonald was killed. James I's efforts to contain the outrage of the Lords of the Isles by executing Campbell did not prevent a subsequent uprising by them. For three days from 4 August 1563, Mary, Queen of Scots, stayed at Dunure Castle on her Royal tour down the west coast to Glenluce Abbey then on to Whithorn Priory. She was the guest of Gilbert Kennedy, the 4th Earl of Cassilis. ===Doocot=== The late medieval \\"beehive\\"-shaped dovecot of Dunure Castle dates probably from the 15th century. It would have held some 200 nesting boxes and would have supplied the castle with fresh eggs and meat.Dunure Doocot on flikr. ===Demise=== Dunure and the castle in 1840 Dunure Castle and headland from the south. This began in the mid-17th century and by 1694 the castle is described as \\"wholly ruined\\". It is not clear whether this can be linked to the Civil War period, although local tradition suggests that Dunure had been burnt and / or blown up. A major collapse of the SE part of the keep could perhaps be linked to such activity. Recovery of building materials for the construction of the Cromwellian citadel in Ayr may also account for its ruination, as at Ardrossan Castle. Much evidence exists for the systematic dismantling of the structure for recoverable building materials including the orderly removal of slates, stone and glass. The windows were dismantled and comprehensively stripped of their lead. Remains of a localised fire and associated deposits of coal suggested that smelting of the lead took place within the room. Those dismantling the castle seem to have occupied part of the structure during their work. The ruin subsequently saw periodic robbing of its sandstone dressings. A range of castle buildings to the S of Area 4 remained in occupation until c. 1860\\\\. Census records and reuse of some rooms demonstrate that some of the occupants were fishermen. A large midden of mussel shell gave evidence for the baiting of cod lines. Domestic refuse of the later 18th and early to mid-19th century was also recovered. The only relatively late recorded military action at Dunure consists of a short siege in 1570. A Civil War action or slighting is a further possibility, although the castle may have been abandoned by that time. The route of a stone-lined water course was located at the S end of the trench as it ran into the entrance of the Area 4 kitchen range. Groundworks to the S of the ruins located a further, well preserved section of the same water course.RCAHMS Scotland. == Present day == The castle has been excavated and consolidated, making safe the public access to the area.

As a boy he witnessed something of the \\"Rebecca Riots\\", and went to school at the neighbouring village of Llechryd. He spent several of his earlier years with his grandfather, Jonah Evans, at Pen-yr-Herber, whence, some twenty years later, he adopted his second name. When fourteen years of age, young Evan was apprenticed to a local draper, who was known as a man of literary tastes, and after four years' service in Pontypridd and then at Merthyr, he removed to Liverpool, where in 1857 he commenced to preach in connection with the Welsh congregational church (the Tabernacle), Great Crosshall Street, then under the pastorate of John Thomas (1821–1892). ==Preacher and lecturer== After twelve months' preparatory training at the Normal College, Swansea, he proceeded in September 1858 to the Memorial College, Brecon, where he remained for four years. He was ordained to the pastorate of Libanus Church, Morriston, on 26 June 1862, and almost immediately he stepped into the first rank of the pulpit orators of Wales. After three years at Morriston (during which time a debt of £2,000 was paid off the chapel) he removed in the autumn of 1865 to Carnarvon to undertake the charge of a comparatively weak church, Salem, formed two or three years previously, and still burdened with a heavy debt. Before he left it, in April 1894, it was, in point of members, the largest belonging to the denomination in North Wales, the chapel having been much enlarged in 1890. In 1891-2, he filled the chair of the congregational union of England and Wales, and his first presidential address, on \\"The Free Churches and their own Opportunities,\\" was described by Dr. Andrw Fairbairn as \\"magnificent\\", while his second address, delivered at Bradford, on \\"A Living Church\\", was by special vote of the assembly ordered to be printed in a cheap form for general circulation. In 1891, he accepted the appointment as lecturer on homiletics at Bala-Bangor Theological Seminary, and in 1894 became its principal. ==Civic and literary work== Throughout his life, Evans took an active part in civic work; he was elected on the first school board at Carnarvon, and on the first county council. He declined, however, to stand as liberal candidate for Carnarvon boroughs in April 1890. In 1895, he was placed on the commission of the peace for Carnarvonshire, an honour never previously conferred (it is believed) on a Welsh dissenting minister. Evans performed some useful literary work as editor of \\"Y Dysgedydd\\" (\\"The Instructor\\"), one of the monthly magazines of the Welsh congregationalists. From 1874 to 1880, he shared its editorship with Ap Vychan, but had sole charge of it from 1880 till his death. A selection of his editorial \\"notes\\" which were remarkable for their freshness and racy quality, was issued shortly after his death by his son-in-law, under the title of \\"Nodiadau Herber\\" (Dolgelly, 1897, 8vo, with portrait). His brother, the Rev. W. Justin Evans, also edited a volume of his sermons (London, 1897), entitled \\"True and False Aims and other Sermons\\", including inter alia reprints of his two addresses from the chair of the congregational union. He had just completed, before his final illness, a chapter which he was contributing for a biography of Dr. John Thomas of Liverpool, and a short life of David Rees of Llanelly, which appeared posthumously. But it is as a preacher that Dr. Evans was chiefly celebrated. Indeed, he was probably unequalled for natural unaffected eloquence among the pulpit orators of Wales during the last half-century. In his delivery there was no apparent effort, and attractive personality added greatly to the effect. But his sermons were characterised by freshness of presentment rather than originality of idea, being practical rather than doctrinal. Probably no Welsh pastor ever appeared so often in English pulpits, and he was immensely popular with English audiences. Evans died on 30 December 1896 at Bangor, and was buried there on 4 January in the Glan-adda cemetery. ==Family== In 1865, he married Jenny, the only daughter of John Hughes, the jeweller of Carnarvon. She died on 10 May 1875, leaving behind an only child, who married Rev. O.L. Roberts of Liverpool. In 1877, he married the only daughter of Owen Jones (from Waterloo House, Carnarvon), who survived him. His only child by her died in infancy. ==References== Attribution * ==Sources== *Lewis, Howell Elvet, The Life of E. Herber Evans, D.D.

The most prestigious competition for top dancers is the (the World Championships), held each Easter Week and in a different city each year. ==Dance competition== Feiseanna are held all over the world, Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, England, Scotland, Wales, all over Europe, South Africa, Australia, the USA and Canada. Feiseanna are held by all the organisations which oversee Irish dance, with most feiseanna being confined to only those dancers who take lessons with a teacher certified by that particular organisation. However, there are a number of organisations (primarily CRN and WIDA along with its affiliated organisations) who organise 'open feisanna', which are open to any dancer regardless of their teacher's organisation (or if they are self-taught). The organisers of 'closed feiseanna' frown upon dancers from their organisation competing at such open competitions, and there are rumours that organisations may sanction competitors/teachers found to participate in such open feiseanna. This, however, has never been confirmed by any organisations, teachers or dancers and could be construed as a way to keep teachers/dancers within one organisation. There are different levels of competition offered at all feiseanna, however the number of levels, and the names of each level vary by country (and even region within that country). Competitions are offered for both solo and team dancing, and are separated based upon the age of the competitors. At some competitions, ceili categories are offered for teams of 4 or 8 dancers, the ceili dances performed must be done so as espoused in the book 'Ar Rince Foirne' which lays down 30 of the traditional Irish ceili dances. Competitions for teams of 2, 3 and 8–16 dancers, called figure dances, may also be offered, choreography for these dances is made up by the teacher and/or dancers themselves, though must adhere to certain rules and parameters, a notable rule for figure dances being that 'any move in which a dancer is thrown across the stage is prohibited'. The commonly competed dances are reel, slip jig, light jig and single jig, in soft shoe, and heavy/treble jig and hornpipe in hard shoe. Treble reels (hard shoe reels) may be offered as 'special dances', as may traditional set dances and special trophy dances in soft and hard shoe in addition to the regular competition. Grade dances are when competitors dance, are judged and are placed in each dance separately. Championships consist of three rounds, an initial soft (reel or slip jig) round and a heavy (heavy/treble jig or hornpipe) round danced by all entrants, the scores from the soft and heavy round are combined, and a percentage (usually circa 50%) of dancers with the highest combined score dance a third round of a modern set dance, the winner is the dancer with the highest combined score across all three rounds. Championships must be judged by a minimum of three judges, preliminary championships in the UK may offer a recall of the heavy dance not danced in the initial heavy round instead of a modern set dance upon recall. Modern set dances are of the teacher and/or dancers own choreography and are danced to a specific set dance chosen from a list compiled by the overseeing organisation. Modern set dances are rarely offered to dance outside of championship competitions, though may occasionally be present as a 'special' competition. Slip jig is only danced by girls, with the exception of male dancers from the CRN organisation. In CLRG affiliated competitions in the USA, Canada and Mexico these levels of competition are offered: beginner, advanced beginner, novice, open/prizewinner, preliminary championship, and championship. The names of categories vary by region. In some regions of the USA there are also special categories for adults, to be eligible the adult dancers must not have competed in the standard age-defined competitions for a stipulated amount of time (usually circa 4 years). Some feiseanna in the US also offer a 'first feis' category for the youngest dancers, to give them a more gentle introduction into the world of competitions. In the UK, Europe, Australia and New Zealand almost all of the organisations separate the competitions into beginner (sometimes referred to as novice), primary, intermediate and open levels. In recent years a preliminary championship level has begun to be introduced at many feiseanna, unlike in the US this level is not compulsory, and is an optional level to bridge the gap between placing out of intermediate and entering the open level. Apart from in the younger age groups, the majority of feiseanna in the UK operate only an open championship competition, rather than open grade dances. The most common way for dancers to advance between levels is through winning a dance when there are 6 or more competitors in the competition, although this depends on organisation. However, in many regions a dancer can only win 3 competitions with fewer than 6 dancers before they must move up to the next level. Teachers may also choose to move a dancer up a level. Once a dancer has met the requirements to move up a level they are no longer allowed to compete at the lower level of competition, however in the UK if a dancer in the open level has not placed in the top 5 for a period of more than a year, they may return to the intermediate level of competition. ===Competition scoring=== Competitions for each individual dance are scored on a 100-point system, which indicate the subjective opinion of each different judge. Most scores seem to be in the 60–95 point range, and can vary wildly depending upon the judge. However, each competition is judged in its entirety by the same judge(s), so what really matters is the relative placing of each dancer. Placing of dancers For Individual dance competitions, placing is based entirely on a single judges subjective opinion. Ties are common, and can result in slightly skewed final results. For instance, a tie at 2nd place would result in the 4th best dancer receiving 3rd place (1st, 2nd, 2nd, 3rd, instead of 1st, 2nd, 2nd, 4th). ===Irish Points=== Preliminary and Open Championship competitions are judged by at least 3 adjudicators (Judges) and at regional, national and world \\"Oireachtas\\" competitions, there can be 5 or more. Because of the subjective nature of judging, the varying scales used by each judge, and fact that the scores of 3 dances must be combined to determine overall placing, an additional [Irish Points] method of scoring is used. Each individual adjudicator derives from their own scoring, a final placing. Ties in these placings are discouraged but do happen. Each of the placings from 1st to 50th are assigned an Irish Point Value, which when combined with the other adjudicators, determines final placing. The Irish Points per individually judged place are vaguely logarithmic, in that 1st == 100 points, 2nd == 75, 3rd == 65 etc., until 50th == 1. This gives higher marks by single judges more weight than average marks by more judges. Complete List of Irish Points: * 1st 100 11th 41 21st 30 31st 20 41st 10 * 2nd 75 12th 39 22nd 29 32nd 19 42nd 9 * 3rd 65 13th 38 23rd 28 33rd 18 43rd 8 * 4th 60 14th 37 24th 27 34th 17 44th 7 * 5th 56 15th 36 25th 26 35th 16 45th 6 * 6th 53 16th 35 26th 25 36th 15 46th 5 * 7th 50 17th 34 27th 24 37th 14 47th 4 * 8th 47 18th 33 28th 23 38th 13 48th 3 * 9th 45 19th 32 29th 22 39th 12 49th 2 * 10th 43 20th 31 30th 21 40th 11 50th 1 In a 3 judge competition it is almost impossible to Not get first with 2 judges agreeing that 1st place is warranted, since with 200 Irish points, the 3rd judge would need to place a dance 7th or worse to overcome the 25 point bonus between 1st and 2nd. This scoring method helps ensure that a single bad adjudicator does not unfairly ruin the results. At a standard 3 judge Feis competition, a unanimous 1st place score is 300 (100 from each judge). At Regional Oireachtas competitions, there are 5 judges who rate all three dance programs, creating the possibility of a perfect score of 500. At the CLRG World Championship Oireachtas (Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne), there are 7 judges, which means that 700 would be perfect if all 7 judges agree that one dancer performed the best. Most schools in North America, are registered with An Coimisiun le Rince Gaelacha and its subsidiary the Irish Dance Teacher's Association of North America. However WIDA and Rince Tuatha Nua are also present as are CRN. ==See also== *Ardfheis, originally the name of the Conradh na Gaeilge Feis, now used of Irish political party conferences *Eisteddfod, the Welsh equivalent of a Feis. *Fèisean nan Gàidheal, the Scottish Gaelic arts youth tuition festivals. ==References== ==External links== *WorldIrishDancer.com Irish dance community & Annual Online Feis * North American Feis Commission *Feiseanna for dummies : a comprehensive explanation of the basics of feiseanna *FeisWorx.com: Popular website for the registration and results of Irish Dancing Feiseanna *FeisKeeper A place to register for NAIDF sponsored feiseanna. *eFeis.com: Another popular website for the registration of Irish Dancing Feiseanna *Feis Productions: a smaller site to register for several US Western Region feiseanna *The Pan-Celtic Festival in Ireland *The National Mòd (Am Mòd Nàiseanta Rìoghail) in Scotland *Goderich Celtic Roots Festival in Canada *Feisean nan Gaidheal – Scottish Gaelic Arts Youth Tuition Festivals *Feis Locator Feis/Feiseanna throughout the world Category:Irish culture Category:Scottish culture Category:Irish dance Category:Celtic music festivals Category:Folk festivals Category:Celtic festivals ","title":"Feis"},{"id":"2561476","text":"Baret Island is a small, sandy but mostly-rocky, oval-shaped island in Buzzards Bay; it is part of the town of Gosnold, in Dukes County and the Elizabeth Islands in Massachusetts, USA.

He is a former leader of the Lebanese Ba'ath Party. ==Political career== Qanso joined the Lebanese Ba'ath in 1953. During the Lebanese war, the Lebanese Ba'ath was divided into two hostile groups: a pro-Iraqi group and a pro-Syrian group. Qanso is staunchly pro-Syrian. Relations between the Kataeb Party and the Ba'ath Party improved when on the orders of Karim Pakradouni (the leader of the Kataeb Party) and Qanso agreed to establish a committee between the two parties to discuss Lebanese and Arab politics. Relations improved further when the Syrian Ba'athist government increased its contacts with the Kataeb Party. During the Lebanese civil war, the Lebanese parliament formed the National Dialogue Committee in 1975; Qanso was a National Dialogue Committee representative. Qanso opposed the notion that the resignation of Suleiman Frangieh, the President of Lebanon, would end the conflict. Following the death of Hafez al-Assad in 2000, notable figures such as Abdul Halim Khaddam and Ghazi Kanaan, supported Rafic Hariri against Émile Lahoud, the then sitting President of Lebanon, during the 2000 general election. Qanso supported Khaddam and Kanaan's position, and declared during a parliamentary session \\"there is no zaim [leader] but Rafik Hariri.\\" On a later occasion, he stated: \\"It was a message to Lahoud that, if he tried to break Hariri, Kanaan would break Lahoud.\\" He later changed his position and supported to extend Lahoud's mandate, and Qanso began criticising the opposition. Qanso warned Walid Jumblat that \\"you are not out of reach of our militants\\". Jumblat replied by stating it was the Ba'ath Party which had ordered the assassination of his father, Kamal Jumblatt. ==2009 election and parliamentarian== There were discussions within the Ba'ath Party if Qanso was to give up his candidacy in the Baalbek-Hermel electoral district to Fayez Shukr, the leader of the Ba'ath Party. Qanso announced his candidacy for a seat in the Baalbek-Hermel electoral district in April 2009. In the 2009 parliamentary election, the Ba'ath Party won two seats as part of the March 8 Alliance; Qanso and Kassem Hachem. Qanso was elected to parliament in the Baalbek-Hermel district. The United States Government led by Barack Obama announced an extension of its travel ban and asset freeze against those seeking “to undermine Lebanon’s legitimate and democratically elected government.” Qanso was amongst those effected by the extension of sanctions. The Ba'ath Party which supports Najib Mikati, the then Prime Minister of Lebanon, claimed, through Qanso, that it \\"should have been represented in the [Mikati] government, just like the Syrian Social Nationalist Party”. === Syrian Civil War === Qanso supports the position of the United Nations Security Council which condemned the use of violence by the Ba'athist government, but which also called for ending the violence and holding those of fomenting the violence accountable. The decision to expel Syria from the Arab League was, according to Qanso, an American plot against Syria. Qanso condemned the Arab League sanctions towards Syria, and compared them to \\"complementary to the US plot against Syria, which targets its oil wealth.\\" In an interview with MTV Lebanon Qanso accused a conspiracy centered around Lebanon First bloc MP Okab Sakr, Hani Hammoud, and Saad Hariri, former Prime Minister of Lebanon, of fomenting the uprising in Syria. He further claimed that there was no good reason for the Assad government to resign. Qanso tried to persuade Mikati to expel Maura Connelly, the United States Ambassador to Lebanon, from the country in late 2011 because of the United States position towards Syria during the ongoing war. In the beginning of January 2012 Qanso claimed that al-Qaida had infiltrated more than 20 political organisations in Lebanon, this was in deep contrast to what Mikati stated when he claimed that Lebanon was \\"al-Qaida free\\". Qanso further claimed that \\"If Syria falls, the last resistance bastion will turn into a state similar to that of Egypt or Libya and will become a breeding ground for Salafis and [the Muslim Brotherhood]. On 30 January Qanso stated his believes that \\"The vast majority of [Syrian] people are with the Ba'ath Party that is tasked with protecting Syrian President Bashar Assad.” At the same time he announced that the Lebanese Ba'ath Party would hold a conference on 7–8 February 2012 in Syria to discuss and approve the reform package which is planned to be introduced by Bashar al-Assad's government. ==References== Category:1937 births Category:Living people Category:Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Lebanon Region politicians Category:Members of the Parliament of Lebanon Category:Lebanese Shia Muslims Category:Government ministers of Lebanon Category:Lebanese Arab nationalists ","title":"Assem Qanso"},{"id":"2561554","text":"Douglas Leslie Dewey Bell, (born June 15, 1926) is a Canadian politician and former Commissioner of the Yukon.Canadian who's who He was made a Member of the Order of Canada in 1989 and a member of the Order of Yukon in 2019.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/order-of-yukon- recipients-2019-1.5379422https://www.whitehorsestar.com/News/commissioner- names-first-recipients-of-the-order-of-yukon ==References== * History of Yukon Commissioners Category:Living people Category:Commissioners of Yukon Category:Members of the Order of Canada Category:1926 births ","title":"Douglas Bell (politician)"},{"id":"2561559","text":"Heptalene is a polycyclic hydrocarbon with chemical formula C12H10, composed of two fused cycloheptatriene rings.

It is caused by an abnormal or inadequate fusion of the superior and inferior endocardial cushions with the mid portion of the atrial septum and the muscular portion of the ventricular septum. ==Symptoms== Symptoms include difficulty breathing (dyspnoea) and bluish discoloration on skin and lips (cyanosis). A newborn baby will show signs of heart failure such as edema, fatigue, wheezing, sweating and irregular heartbeat.Mayo Clinic September 12, 2012\\"Atrioventricular Canal Defect\\" http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/atrioventricular-canal-defect/DS00745 ===Complications=== When there are holes in the septum that divide the four chambers of the heart the oxygen-rich blood and oxygen-poor blood mix this creates more stress on the heart to pump blood to where oxygen is needed. As a result, you get enlargement of the heart, heart failure (being unable to adequately supply body with needed oxygen), pulmonary hypertension, and pneumonia. The development of pulmonary hypertension is very serious. And this because the left ventricle is weakened due to its overuse. When this happens, the pressure backs up into the pulmonary veins and the lungs. This type of damage is irreversible which is why immediate treatment is recommended after diagnosis. ===Associated conditions=== Down syndrome is often associated with AVCD. Other risk factors include: having a parent with a congenital heart defect, alcohol use while pregnant, uncontrolled diabetes treatment during pregnancy and some medications during pregnancy. This type of congenital heart defect is associated with patients with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) or heterotaxy syndromes.Report of the New England Regional Infant Cardiac Program\\" Pediatrics 1980;65(suppl):441–444. 45% of children with Down syndrome have congenital heart disease. Of these, 35–40% have AV septal defects. Similarly, one-third of all children born with AVSDs also have Down syndrome.Children's National Health System. (2019). Pediatric Atrioventricular Canal (AV canal or AVC). [online] Available at: https://childrensnational.org/choose-childrens/conditions-and- treatments/heart/atrioventricular-canal-av-canal-or-avc [Accessed 5 Feb. 2019]. A study also showed that there is also an increased risk of atrioventricular canal in patients who suffer from Noonan syndrome. The pattern seen in those patients with Noonan syndrome differ from those patients who have Down syndrome in that \\"partial\\" AVCD is more prevalent in those who suffer from NS, where as those who suffer from down syndrome show a prevalence of the \\"complete\\" form of AVCD. ==Pathophysiology== If there is a defect in the septum, it is possible for blood to travel from the left side of the heart to the right side of the heart, or the other way around. Since the right side of the heart contains venous blood with a low oxygen content, and the left side of the heart contains arterial blood with a high oxygen content, it is beneficial to prevent any communication between the two sides of the heart and prevent the blood from the two sides of the heart from mixing with each other. 190px ===Genetic Relationship=== TBX2 is a T-box transcription factor and is usually expressed during various areas of embryogenesis. One notable expression is when it is shown in the development of the outflow system and atrioventricular canal of the developing heart. In a study, they used targeted mutagenesis in mice to delete Tbx2 locus in some specimen. The results showed that mice who were homozygous and heterozygous null (+/+ & +/-) for Tbx2 resulted in the development of a healthier heart, while those who were homozygous null (-/-) for Tbx2 died early because of the inability of the heart to supply the body. It showed that there was insufficient formation of the endocardial cushion. There was a clear abnormality not only in the atrioventricular canal but also in the left ventricle. This study supports the fact that Tbx2 expression is important in the development of proper chamber differentiation, and in turn cannot have a direct relation to the development of atrioventricular canal defect.Harrelson, Zachary \\"Tbx2 is Essential for Patterning the Atrioventricular Canal and for Morphogenesis of the Outflow Tract During Heart Development\\" 2004 October 15, The Company of Biologists http://dev.biologists.org/content/131/20/5041.full ==Diagnosis== Ultrasound showing a complete atrioventricular septal defect AVSDs can be detected by cardiac auscultation; they cause atypical murmurs and loud heart tones. Confirmation of findings from cardiac auscultation can be obtained with a cardiac ultrasound (echocardiography - less invasive) and cardiac catheterization (more invasive). Tentative diagnosis can also be made in utero via fetal echocardiogram. An AVSD diagnosis made before birth is a marker for Down syndrome, although other signs and further testing are required before any definitive confirmation of either can be made. ===Classification=== A variety of different classifications have been used, but the defects are usefully divided into \\"partial\\" and \\"complete\\" forms. * In the partial AVSD, there is a defect in the primum or inferior part of the atrial septum but no direct intraventricular communication (ostium primum defect). * In the complete AVSD (CAVSD), there is a large ventricular component beneath either or both the superior or inferior bridging leaflets of the AV valve. The defect involves the whole area of the junction of the upper and lower chambers of the heart, i.e. where the atria join the ventricles. There is a large hole between the lower portion of the atria and the upper or \`inlet' portion of the ventricles and this is associated with a significant abnormality of the valves separating the atria from the ventricles. The valves in effect become a common atrio-ventricular valve, and the severity of the defect depends largely on the supporting attachments of the valve to the ventricles and whether the valve allows dominant flow from the right atrium to right ventricle and from left atrium to left ventricle (\\"unbalanced\\" flow). The overall problems are similar to those of VSD but are more complicated. There is an increased flow of blood to the lungs through both the ventricular and atrial components of the defect. In addition, the abnormal atrio-ventricular valve invariably leaks, so that when the ventricles contract, blood flows not only forwards to the body and the lungs, but also backwards into the atria. The back-pressure effect on the atria causes congestion of blood in the left atrium in particular, and this in turn causes congestion in the veins draining the lungs. The effect on the baby is to worsen the heart failure that is associated with an isolated VSD and to hasten the onset of pulmonary hypertension. It should be mentioned that CAVSD is found in approximately one-third of babies who have Down syndrome, but it also occurs as an isolated abnormality. ==Treatment== Treatment is surgical and involves closure of the atrial and ventricular septal defects and restoration of a competent left AV valve as far as is possible. Open surgical procedures require a heart-lung machine and are done with a median sternotomy. Surgical mortality for uncomplicated ostium primum defects in experienced centers is 2%; for uncomplicated cases of complete atrioventricular canal defect, 4% or less. Certain complications such as tetralogy of Fallot or highly unbalanced flow across the common AV valve can increase risk significantly.Kirklin J, Barratt-Boyes B, ed. Cardiac Surgery, New York: Wiley, 1986:463–497.Marx, GR, Fyler DC, \\"Endiocardial Cusion Defects\\", in Keane, JF, Lock, JE, Fyler DC ed. Nadas' Pediatric Cardiology 2ed., Philadelphia: Saunders-Elsevier, 2006:663-674.. Infants born with AVSD are generally in sufficient health to not require immediate corrective surgery. If surgery is not required immediately after birth, the newborn will be closely monitored for the next several months, and the operation held-off until the first signs of lung distress or heart failure. This gives the infant time to grow, increasing the size of, and thereby the ease of operation on, the heart, as well as the ease of recovery. Infants will generally require surgery within three to six months, however, they may be able to go up to two years before the operation becomes necessary, depending on the severity of the defect.Hay, WW, et al. 2007.

Her father, Joseph Nyanduga, was one of the first men in the village of Asembo to obtain a Western education. He converted early on to the Anglican Church, and taught at the Church Missionary Society’s Ng'iya Girls’ School. From her father, she learned the stories of the Old Testament and it was from her grandmother that Ogot learned the traditional folk tales of the area from which she would later draw inspiration.Bernth Lindfors, \\"Interview with Grace Ogot\\", 1979, in World Literature Written in English 18(1) 57–68. Grace Ogot background was very interesting. Ogot attended the Ng'iya Girls' School and Butere High School throughout her youth. From 1949 to 1953, she trained as a nurse at the Nursing Training Hospital in Uganda. She later worked in London, England, at St. Thomas Hospital for Mothers and Babies. She returned to the African nursing profession in 1958, working at Maseno Hospital, run by the Church Missionary Society in Kisumu County, Kenya. Following this, Ogot worked at Makerere University College in Student Health Services. She was the very first female from Kenya to be published in English. In addition to her experience in healthcare, Ogot gained experience in multiple different areas, working for the BBC Overseas Service as a script-writer and announcer on the programme London Calling East and Central Africa, operating a prominent radio programme in the Luo language, working as an officer of community development in Kisumu County and as a public relations officer for the Air India Corporation of East Africa. In 1975, Ogot worked as a Kenyan delegate to the general assembly of the United Nations. Subsequently, in 1976, she became a member of the Kenyan delegation to UNESCO. That year, she chaired and helped found the Writers' Association of Kenya. In 1983 she became one of only a handful of women to serve as a member of parliament and the only woman assistant minister in the cabinet of then President Daniel arap Moi. ==Personal life== In 1959, Grace Ogot married history professor Bethwell Allan Ogot, a Luo from Gem Location, and later became the mother of four children. Her proclivity for storytelling and her husband's interest in the oral tradition and history of the Luo peoples would later be combined in her writing career.Chris Wanjala, \\"Grace Ogot chronicles her life in new autobiography\\", Business Daily, 3 January 2013. Ogot died on 18 March 2015.Joseph Muraya, \\"Ex-Assistant Minister and author Grace Ogot dies\\", Capital News, 18 March 2015. ==Work== ===Writing career=== In 1962, Grace Ogot read her short story \\"A Year of Sacrifice\\" at a conference on African Literature at Makerere University in Uganda. After discovering that there was no other work presented or displayed from East African writers, Ogot became motivated to publish her works,Bernth Lindfors \\"Interview with Grace Ogot\\", 1979, in World Literature Written in English 18(1), p. 58. which she subsequently did both in the Luo language and in English. \\"A Year of Sacrifice\\" appeared in print as Ogot's first published workDubem Okafor, Meditations on African Literature, Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 2001, p. 103. in the African journal Black Orpheus in 1963.Sarah Constantakis, ed. \\"Overview: The Rain Came\\", in Short Stories for Students. Volume 34. 2012. Detroit: Gale. In 1964, her short story \\"The Rain Came\\" was published as part of the collection Modern African Stories,Modern African Stories, ed. Ellis A. Comey and Ezekiel Mphahlele (London: Faber & Faber, 1964). co-edited by Es'kia Mphahlele, who had organised the earlier mentioned conference on African Literature at Makerere University in Uganda in 1962. \\"The Rain Came\\" was a reworked version of \\"A Year of Sacrifice\\" but considerably shortened and with a different beginning and ending. Also in 1964, the short story \\"Ward Nine\\" was published in the journal Transition.Peter Benson, Black Orpheus, Transition and Modern Cultural Awakening in Africa, University of California Press, 1986, p. 127. Ogot's first novel The Promised Land, set in the 1930s, was published in 1966 and focused on Luo emigration and the problems that arise through migration. Her main protagonists emigrate from Nyanza to northern Tanzania, in search of fertile land and wealth. The story also focused on themes of tribal hatred, materialism, and traditional notions of femininity and wifely duties.\\"The Promised Land\\" , African Books Collective. 1968 saw the publishing of Land Without Thunder, a collection of short stories set in ancient Luoland. Ogot's descriptions, literary tools, and storylines in Land Without Thunder offer a valuable insight into Luo culture in pre-colonial East Africa. Her other works include The Strange Bride, The Graduate, The Other Woman and The Island of Tears. Many of her stories are set against the scenic background of Lake Victoria and the traditions of the Luo people. One theme that features prominently within Ogot's work is the importance of traditional Luo folklore, mythologies, and oral traditions. This theme is at the forefront in \\"The Rain Came\\", a tale that was related to Ogot in her youth by her grandmother, whereby a chief's daughter must be sacrificed to bring rain.Margaret Busby, Daughters of Africa, London: Vintage, 1993, pp.365–371. Furthermore, Ogot’s short stories juxtapose traditional and modern themes and notions, demonstrating the conflicts and convergences that exist between the old ways of thought and the new. In The Promised Land, the main character, Ochola, falls under a mysterious illness which cannot be cured through medical intervention. Eventually, he turns to a medicine man to be healed. Ogot explains such thought processes as exemplary of the blending of traditional and modern understandings, \\"Many of the stories I have told are based on day- to-day life… And in the final analysis, when the Church fails and the hospital fails, these people will always slip into something they trust, something within their own cultural background. It may appear to us mere superstition, but those who do believe in it do get healed. In day-to-day life in some communities in Kenya, both the modern and the traditional cures coexist.\\"Bernth Lindfors \\"Interview with Grace Ogot\\", 1979, in World Literature Written in English 18(1), pp. 60–62. Another theme that often appears throughout Ogot’s works is that of womanhood and the female role. Throughout her stories, Ogot demonstrates an interest in family matters, revealing both traditional and modern female gender roles followed by women, especially within the context of marriage and Christian traditions.Gloria Chukukere, Gender Voices and Choices: Redefining Women in Contemporary African Fiction, Fourth Dimension Publishing Co., 1995, pp. 60–62. Such an emphasis can be seen in The Promised Land, in which the notions both of mothers as the ultimate protectors of their children and of dominant patriarchal husband-wife relationships feature heavily.Nici Nelson, \\"Representations of men and women, city and town in Kenyan novels of the 1970s and 1980s\\", in African Languages and Cultures, January 1996, 9(2): pp. 145–168. Critics such as Maryse Condé have suggested that Ogot's emphasis on the importance of the female marital role, as well as her portrayal of women in traditional roles, creates an overwhelmingly patriarchal tone in her stories.Chukukere, Gender Voices and Choices (1995), p. 218. However, others have suggested that women in Ogot’s works also demonstrate strength and integrity, as in \\"The Empty Basket\\", where the bravery of the main female character, Aloo, is contrasted by the failings of the male characters. Though her wits and self-assertion, Aloo overcomes a perilous situation with a snake, while the men are stricken by panic. It is only after she rebukes and shames the men that they are roused to destroy the snake.Grace Ify Achufusi, \\"Conceptions of Ideal Womanhood: The Example of Bessie Head and Grace Ogot\\", in Neohelicon, 2005 19(2): p. 95. In Ogot’s short stories, the women portrayed often have a strong sense of duty, as demonstrated in \\"The Rain Came\\", and her works regularly emphasise the need for understanding in relationships between men and women.O. R. Dathorne. African Literature in the Twentieth Century, Minnesota: University of Minnesota Press, 1974, pp. 130–131. Prior to Kenyan Independence, while Kenya was still under a colonial regime, Ogot experienced difficulties in her initial attempts to have her stories published: \\"I remember taking some of my short stories to the manager [of the East African Literature Bureau], including the one which was later published in Black Orpheus. They really couldn't understand how a Christian woman could write such stories, involved with sacrifices, traditional medicines and all, instead of writing about Salvation and Christianity. Thus, quite a few writers received no encouragement from colonial publishers who were perhaps afraid of turning out radical writers critical of the colonial regime.\\" She was interviewed in 1974 by Lee Nichols for a Voice of America radio broadcast that was aired between 1975 and 1979 (Voice of America radio series Conversations with African Writers, no. 23). The Library of Congress has a copy of the broadcast tape and the unedited original interview. The broadcast transcript appears in the 1981 book Conversations with African Writers.Conversations with African Writers (Washington, D.C.: Voice of America, 1981), p. 207–216.

Among the most important personalities of the 18th- century Italian culture, he is considered among the fathers of the Lombard reformist Enlightenment and the most important pre-Smithian authority on cheapness and plenty. == Early life == Pietro Verri was born in Milan, the eldest son of Gabriele Verri and Barbara Dati Della Somaglia, in a house of the Archinto in via Stampa 19, then under Austrian rule, to a conservative noble family. He had three brothers: Alessandro, Carlo and Giovanni.( ^ Angolani Bartolo, Gli Scritti di argomento familiare e autobiografico di Pietro Verri, Rivista di storia della filosofia. Fascicolo 3, 2007 (Firenze : [poi] Milano : La Nuova Italia ; Franco Angeli, 2007) He studied in the Jesuit college in Monza, five years (1740–44) in the college of Barnabites in S. Alessandro in Milan and two years (1744–45) in Rome in the college of Nazareno Degli Scolopi. He received a strong religious education, from which he began to rebel when he reached his twenties. He volunteered to serve in the Seven Years' War in order to escape his father's decision to register him for legal studies but quit after a year. In mid-September 1759, he met the economist Henry Lloyd and developed a lifelong friendship with Henry Lloyd.Porta, Pier Luigi. 2011. \\"Lombard Enlightenment and Classical Political Economy\\". European Journal of the History of Economic Thought. 18 (4): 521–550. Verri soon became convinced that Political Economy had to be at the center of all serious social and political interests. In his early life, he translated Destouches' works and wrote satirical almanacs (Borlanda impasticciata, Gran Zoroastro and Mal di Milza) which scandalized the Milanese society. Società dei Pugni by Antonio Perego from left to right: Alfonso Longo (behind), Alessandro Verri, Giambattista Biffi, Cesare Beccaria, Luigi Lambertenghi, Pietro Verri and Giuseppe Visconti di Saliceto Verri's early steps in educating himself in the science of civil society were guided by four eighteenth-century intellectual giants of the Enlightenment: Montesquieu, Voltaire, Rousseau, and Helvétius. In combination, these particularly informed his emerging views on law and civil society, the importance of historical understanding, his utilitarian tendencies and, more specifically, economic issues associated with trade, money, credit, and taxation.Verri, Pietro, Barbara McGilvray, and Peter D. Groenewegen. Reflections on Political Economy. Fairfield (N.J.: Kelley, 1993. Print In 1761, together with his brother Alessandro, he founded a literary association, the Società dei Pugni (\\"Society of the Fists\\"), and, from 1764, published the magazine Il Caffè (\\"The Coffeehouse\\"). Pietro Verri was the founder, leader, and active contributor to both. Il Caffe appeared between 1764 and 1766 in successive magazines made in two volumes. Magazine 10 of Volume 1 has an article by Pietro Verri devoted to thoughts on the spirit of Italian LiteratureBianchini (2002) Here Verri describes Galileo-Newtonianism at the philosophical level as a force of renovation, providing a new connecting frame for scientific reasoning, in the spirit of what we have called above moral Newtonianism.Bruni, Luigino, and Pier L. Porta. \\"Economia Civile and Pubblica Felicita in the Italian Enlightenment.\\" History of Political Economy. 35 (2003): 361. Print.(Page-365) his magazine became an important reference on Enlightenment Milan. Other figures who wrote on it include his brother Alessandro, the famous philosopher Cesare Beccaria, Alfonso Longo and Pietro Secchi. == Political economy == Detail of Pietro Verri monument in Milan In 1764, he also entered the public administration, where he distinguished for his reforming attitudes: in particular, he proposed the abolition of the exaction of taxes through intermediaries. After a documented Bilance on the Commerce of the State of Milan, In 1769 Verri published notable work, Elementi del Commercio (\\"Elements of Commerce\\"), inspired by a wide interpretation of liberalism in commerce. This was followed by the Meditazioni sull'economia politica (\\"Reflection's on Political Economy\\", 1771), the book contains 40 sections and when Verri's Meditiazioni first appeared was well received. Its success was considerable, in just one year, five different editions produced. According to Schumpeter, Verri was one of the first economists to figure out a balance of payments and Schumpeter adds Verri is the most important pre-Smithian authority on Cheapness and Plenty.Schumpeter, Joseph A, and Elizabeth B. Schumpeter. History of Economic Analysis. London: Routledge, 1997. Print.(page-273) His work is clearly one of the many examples in the economic literature which during the quarter-century after 1750 marks the emergence of political economy as a separate science.Verri, Pietro, Barbara McGilvray, and Peter D. Groenewegen. Reflections on Political Economy. Fairfield (N.J.: Kelley, 1993. Print (page-274) Pietro Verri provides the first systematic contribution stemming from the quarters of Lombard enlightenment in the field of political economy. From the vantage point afforded by Verri's political economy, we gain a considerably attractive view of the most significant elements and characteristic concepts of Lombard enlightenment during the latter half of the 18th century.Porta, Pier L, and Roberto Scazzieri.

Milano: Università di Milano, Istituto di Economia Politica, 1998. Print (page-3) Meditiazioni can be separated three different parts. The first, covering the first five sections, presents the general principles of the science by explaining economic development and growth, circulation, production, exchange, money, and prices in general terms. These general principles are supplemented and elucidated on money, industry, interest, and circulation and on population. Part II then applies these principles to a number of policy questions in political economy: the distribution of landed property, guilds and other forms of restrictive practices through privilege, price controls, controls over sales, sumptuary laws and some observations associated with population and agriculture. Part III presents the theory of finance while the last three sections act as a sort of summary of the policy implications of the material presented.Verri, Pietro, Barbara McGilvray, and Peter D. Groenewegen. Reflections on Political Economy. Fairfield (N.J.: Kelley, 1993. Print (page-275) First 5 editions of Meditiazioni do not contain any mathematical term, however, some footnotes added in the sixth edition in order to interpret Verri's economic thought into mathematical terms.Tubaro, Paola. \\"A Case Study in Early Mathematical Economics: Pietro Verri and Paolo Frisi, 1772.\\" Journal of the History of Economic Thought. 24.2 (2002): 195–214. Print (page- 195) The aim of political economy to increase national power, strength and happiness is achievable through an increased population, incentives to labor, increased production and an appropriate balance between it and consumption. Success in achieving this policy objective can be measured by at least three different means in the absence of reliable national output data, as Verri indicates at various points in his treatise. These are the balance of trade, which he regarded as an imperfect measure; the level of the rate of interest, which he saw as a better measure, and population size and characteristics, which he saw as the best measure because it could be most accurately measured. Verri's economic theory concentrates on three subjects: 1. prices; 2. aggregate equilibrium; 3. distribution.Marco E. L. Guidi PAIN AND HUMAN ACTION: LOCKE TO BENTHAM DSS PAPERS STO 1–95 Pietro Verri === Theory of prices === According to Verri, the price of a commodity is directly related to \\"need\\" and inversely to plenty. By \\"need\\", Verri does not mean any indeterminate desire, but the effective demand of goods, i.e. the level of demand at which the expected utility of any good is higher than the cost individual are ready to pay in order to acquire it . Verri stresses consumer sovereignty, by arguing that demand regulates supply and not the contrary. As to plenty, it basically depends on the market form: it is larger when the market approximates to perfect competition.Verri, P. (1781) \\"Discorso sull'indole del piacere e del dolore (1st edition 1773, 2nd ed. 1881)\\", in Id., Del piacere e del dolore ed altri scritti di filosofia ed economia, R.De Felice ed., Feltrinelli, Milano 1964.(page-144) === An equilibrium between production and consumption === The problem of equilibrium between production (\\"reproduction\\" in Verri's terms) and consumption is analyzed examining two opposed cases of disequilibrium. Verri's contribution is strictly connected here to the basic theoretical assumptions of his theory of action. It is also very original in its issues.Verri, P. (1781) \\"Discorso sull'indole del piacere e del dolore (1st edition 1773, 2nd ed. 1881)\\", in Id., Del piacere e del dolore ed altri scritti di filosofia ed economia, R.De Felice ed., Feltrinelli, Milano 1964.(page-137-139) The first case takes place when national consumption is greater than production and the balance of commerce is unfavorable. Unlike Hume, Verri pays no attention to deflux of money and to the ensuing deflation. His interest is devoted to real re- equilibrating mechanisms. There are two possible solutions to disequilibrium: the first one is negative and consists of factor mobility (emigration of a part of the laboring force). When the other solution prevails, new productive branches are created in the country: these new industries compete in quality and price with those located abroad, toward which the demand for imported goods was addressed. This process of import substitution re-equilibrates the balance of commerce. Welfare grows in the country with the increasing size of the internal market. The role of ideas is central to this picture: a class of individuals understands the existence of national demand for certain goods and produces it at better conditions than foreign competitors.Verri, P. (1781) \\"Discorso sull'indole del piacere e del dolore (1st edition 1773, 2nd ed. 1881)\\", in Id., Del piacere e del dolore ed altri scritti di filosofia ed economia, R.De Felice ed., Feltrinelli, Milano 1964. In the second case, consumption is smaller than production, and the balance of commerce is favorable. As a matter of fact, Verri engages himself in demonstrating that a favorable balance of commerce is possible at certain conditions, that inflation is not a necessary outcome of it, and finally that a growth of the real side of the economy is consistent with it. Inflation takes place only if the extra monetary demand clashes with rigidities on the supply side (in this case, money \\"stops\\" in the hands of an unmodified number of sellers). However, this case is not very likely in a \\"polite\\" nation. Verri describes here a sort of Hume-Cantillon transmission mechanism without inflation. Additional money, passing from hand to hand, incites industry and puts unemployed factors at work. The Verrian self-sustained mechanism of growth based on increasing income, new needs, and new productions, is the result of this first impulse. Here too, the entrepreneurial spirit plays an essential part. === Distribution === Like the other parts of his economic contribution, Verri's theory of distribution also springs from the theory of needs and desires. As many of the economists of his time, Verri has a preference for a society in which the weight of the middle class is large. The members of this class, urged by their needs, are stimulated to work hard in order to better their condition. Inequality of fortunes, as far as it is moderate and gradual, is an additional stimulus, giving to everyone a hope to ascend in the social scale. On the contrary, when inequality is too high, society is condemned to poverty and to a stationary state. Rich landlords take no care of their goods, having no anxiety for future welfare. Moreover, the poor are too poor to be influenced by superior need and to hope to better theircondition. As in the savage state, the poor have primary needs, but imagination and desire play no role in their life. Absolute equality of properties is not a better solution. The only effect of the Roman agrarian laws and of similar institutions are that of destroying desire and hindering development.Verri, P. (1781) \\"Discorso sull'indole del piacere e del dolore (1st edition 1773, 2nd ed. 1881)\\", in Id., Del piacere e del dolore ed altri scritti di filosofia ed economia, R.De Felice ed., Feltrinelli, Milano 1964 (page-151) == Philosophical work == Sull'indole del piacere e del dolore, 1781 As early as 1763, Verri's early study Meditiazioni sulla felicita—usually classified as a philosophical pamphlet—is written. Verri spells out the foundational pieces of his approach to civil life. Afterward, as resistance against his reforming work in administration stiffened, Verri devoted himself increasingly to philosophy. In 1773 he wrote Dell'indole del piacere e del dolore (\\"Discourse on Pleasure and Pain\\"), followed in 1777 by Osservazioni sulla tortura (\\"Observations on Torture\\"), in which he stressed the uselessness and cruelty of torture. He argues that the excess of desires over and above possibilities or \\"power\\" is a measure of unhappiness.( Verri, P. (1781) \\"Discorso sull'indole del piacere e del dolore (1st edition 1773, 2nd ed. 1881)\\", in Id., Del piacere e del dolore ed altri scritti di filosofia ed economia, R.De Felice ed., Feltrinelli, Milano 1964) The search for happiness in the form of the removal of unhappiness is a core issue in Pietro Verri's political philosophy. He appears from the start as one of the leading representatives eighteenth-century eudomistic views. Happiness, Verri argues, can be pursued in two ways. Happiness, in fact, consists in the reduction of the difference between the two elements of desires and power: that reduction can be achieved by acting upon either one or the other of the two elements. It can be said therefore that the object of happiness being reduced to a difference, it can be conquered either by \\"addition\\"(of power) or by \\"subtraction\\" (of desires). Verri declares addition to be superior. An addition in the form of the enlargement of power provides the main route to happiness as compared with a check on desires. Verri, however, lays a special emphasis upon creativity rather than mere enjoyment of what is already in our possession as a condition for happiness.Bruni, Luigino, and Pier L. Porta. \\"Economia Civile and Pubblica Felicita in the Italian Enlightenment.\\" History of Political Economy. 35 (2003): 361. Print.(page-366) His two most important productions (Discourse on the Nature of Pleasure and Pain, 1773; Meditations on Happiness, 1781) contain new and ingenious ideas on the function of pain and the law of contrasts, which were afterward adopted by Kant, Schopenhauer, and Wundt and discussed by Dumont, Bouillier, and Regalia.1 Bouvy, Le comte Pietro Verri et son temps, Paris, 1893. == Influence == The portrait of Pietro Verri on the house of Cesare Beccaria in Milan A comprehensive reading of Verri's economic and philosophical writings suggests a new perspective in the analysis of the interplay between moral sense theory, legislation and the competitive framework of a market economy which is not irrelevant to the understanding of the same relationship in other eighteenth-century writers, including Adam Smith. For Verri's Meditazioni are explicitly rooted in a 'historical' investigation of moral sentiments, and of the way in which these may influence the pursuit of private or public interest, and the characteristics of legislation.Porta, Pier L, and Roberto Scazzieri. Pietro Verri's Contribution to the Economic Theory of the 18th Century: Commercial Society, Civil Society and Governance of the Economy. Milano: Università di Milano, Istituto di Economia Politica, 1998. Print.(page-27) Verri's influence can be seen first, his friend and colleague from the Il Caffè, in Beccaria's known work in on Crimes and Punishments. Beccaria had been largely inspired by Verri himself and defended by him. It is proposed in the present paper to revisit some of the basic tenets of Pietro Verri's political economy, with more in view than dwell on specific intuitions and theorems: namely, relate those to Verri's own—quite original—conception of the economy.Porta, Pier L, and Roberto Scazzieri. Pietro Verri's Contribution to the Economic Theory of the 18th Century: Commercial Society, Civil Society and Governance of the Economy. Milano: Università di Milano, Istituto di Economia Politica, 1998. Print. 18th Century Philosopher Condillac apparently shared Verri's ideas on land reform. In the nineteenth century, Jean-Baptiste Say showed a favorable attitude towards Verri's treatment of productive and unproductive labor.Carlo Capra. Pietro Verri e il suo tempo, 2 vols. Milano: Cisalpino (ed.), 1999. (page-424) Pp. X-1137. . Verri's books also reached to Voltaire' and De Felice(Felice 1964, p. 127) reports Voltaire's description of Verri's Meditazioni as ‘the truest, wisest and clearest’ book he had ever read on the subject of political economy, but no letter from Voltaire to Verri or any other similar reference to Verri's work can be found in the standard collected edition of Voltaire's works. However, Caspari mentions Voltaire's thanks to Verri for sending him a copy of the Meditazioni, dating it precisely at 19 March 1772 on the authority of Mauri.(Caspari 1929, p. 240 and note) Adam Smith personal library included two copies (1771 and 1772) of Verri's Political economy. Adam Smith's reading Italian ability is well documented. The themes of a probable influence of Verri on Smith (the analysis is based on a comparison of Verri's Economia Politica with Smith's Wealth of Nations can be summarized as follows: * A strong emphasis on the balance of consumption and production, which finds an echo in Smith's text. * A Political economy of effective supply – that is, of cheapness-and abundance – based on a theory of price and on a criticism of the idea of money neutrality. * A notion of a spontaneous order – that is, order as the result of human action but not of human design – which Verri discovers from an analysis of the perverse effects of the corn trade prohibitions. * The canons for an effective tax system.Porta, Pier L. \\"Lombard Enlightenment and Classical Political Economy.\\" European Journal of the History of Economic Thought. 18.4 (2011): 521–550. Print. (Page-542-543) In spite of favorable references to Verri by such authorities as McCulloch and Ingram, Verri's fortune as an economist was inferior to his merits. == Later life and works == In 1777, he began the Storia di Milano (\\"History of Milan\\", two volumes, 1783 and 1798), a notable example of Enlightenment historiography. The ecclesiastical reforms of Joseph II of Austria inspired him the Dialogo fra Pio VI e Giuseppe II a Vienna (\\"Dialogue between Pius VI and Joseph II in Vienna\\", 1782), followed by La Decadenza del Papa (\\"The Pope's Decay\\"), marked by his disappointment for the lack of influence of Enlightenment's ideas on the Papacy. Joseph II's increasing despotism led Verri to abandon any position in the Austrian administration of Lombardy in 1786; ten years later, after the French invasion, he returned as a member of the Milanese municipality and was one of the founders of the Cisalpine Republic. Though disapproving the Jacobin excesses, Verri, however, welcomed the possibility of moral and economic improvement in the aftermath of the French Revolution, which he considered influenced in turn by the Enlightenment movement. In 1786, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. On the night of 28 June 1797, during a meeting in the hall of the Municipality, he died of a sudden apoplectic attack, at sixty-eight. He is buried in the chapel of the Sanctuary of the Blessed Virgin of Lazzaretto di Ornago, next to his first wife. Verri's death bicentenary was commemorated on an Italian postage stamp in 1997. == Bibliography == * La Borlanda impasticciata con la concia, e trappola de sorci composta per estro, e dedicata per bizzaria alla nobile curiosita di teste salate dall'incognito d'Eritrea Pedsol riconosciuto, Festosamente raccolta, e fatta dare in luce dall'abitatore disabitato accademico bontempista, Adorna di varj poetici encomj, ed accresciuta di opportune annotazioni per opera di varj suoi coaccademici amici (1751) * Il Gran Zoroastro ossia Astrologiche Predizioni per l'Anno 1758 (1758) * Il Mal di Milza (1764) * Diario militar (1759) * Elementi del commercio (1760) * Sul tributo del sale nello Stato di Milano (1761) * Sulla grandezza e decadenza del commercio di Milano (1763) * Dialogo tra Fronimo e Simplicio (detto anche Dialogo sul disordine delle monete nello Stato di Milano nel 1762) (1762) * Considerazioni sul commercio nello Stato di Milano (June 1763) * Orazione panegirica sula giurisprudenza milanese (1763) * Meditazioni sulla felicità (1763) * Bilancio del commercio dello stato di Milano (1758, poi 1762) * Il Caffè (1764–1766) * Sull'innesto del vajuolo (1766) * Memorie storiche sulla economia pubblica dello Stato di Milano (written in 1768, published in 1804) * Riflessioni sulle leggi vincolanti il commercio dei grani (written 1769, published in 1797) * Meditazioni sulla economia politica con annotazioni (1771) * Consulta su la riforma delle monete dello Stato di Milano (20 April 1772) * Osservazioni sulla tortura (written in 1776, published in 1804) * Ricordi a mia figlia (1777) * Considerazioni sul commercio nello Stato di Milano * Sull'indole del piacere e del dolore (1773–1781) * Manoscritto da leggersi dalla mia cara figlia Teresa Verri per cui sola lo scrissi ne’ mesi di Settembre e Ottobre 1781 (1781) * Storia di Milano (1783) * Piano di organizzazione del Consiglio governativo ed istruzioni per il medesimo (1786) * Precetti di Caligola e Claudio (1786–1788) * Memoria cronologica dei cambiamenti pubblici dello Stato di Milano 1750–1791 (1791) * Delle nozioni tendenti alla pubblica felicità (1791–1792) * Pensieri di un buon vecchio che non è letterato (1796) * Carteggio di Pietro e di Alessandro Verri (prima pubblicazione 1910) * Sulla tortura e singolarmente sugli effetti che produsse all'occasione delle unzioni malefiche, alle quali si attribui la pestilenza che devastò Milano 'l'anno 1630.

It is located adjacent to King George Square, where the rectangular City Hall has its main entrance. The City Hall also has frontages and entrances in both Ann Street and Adelaide Street. The building is considered one of Brisbane's finest and was listed on the Register of the National Estate in 1978. The building has been used for royal receptions, pageants, orchestral concerts, civic greetings, flower shows, school graduations and political meetings. In 2008, it was discovered that the building had severe structural problems. After a three-year restoration, it re-opened on 6 April 2013. ==History== The City Hall was once the tallest building in Brisbane (see external links below for image from 1957). The building was designed by the firm Hall and Prentice, in association with four young New South Wales Architects: Bruce Dellit, Peter Kaad, Emil Sodersten and Noel Wilson. ===Choosing a site=== Although there was a strong desire to construct a new city hall, there were many years of debating the best location for it. Charles Moffatt Jenkinson, the mayor of Brisbane in 1914, is credited with having finalised the decision to construct the city hall at Albert Square (now known as King George Square), by selling the alternative site in Fortitude Valley to the Catholic Church who proposed to construct the Holy Name Cathedral on that site. ===Laying the foundations=== The (second) foundation laying ceremony, 29 July 1920 The first foundation stone was laid on Saturday 3 February 1917 by Queensland Governor (Major Sir Hamilton J. Goold-Adams) in advance of the building's construction. The stone was placed facing Albert Square (now King George Square). At the time there were no plans for the new building. The stone was hollowed to allow a time capsule to be placed within it. The time capsule was a zinc cylinder; it contained: * copies of the Brisbane daily newspapers * copy of the Proclamation of the Incorporation of the City * a copy of the minutes of the first meeting of the City Council * a copy of the minutes of the meeting at which the council resolved to lay this foundation stone * one of each of the current coins of the realm * a message of good wishes from the Governor However, it was later found to be out of alignment, and it was removed. In 1935, it was claimed that the stone was in a Brisbane City Council depot in Macrossan Street. However, in 1954, it was claimed that the original foundation stone was lost as it was believed to have been used as part of a building's foundations. The 1920 foundation stone The second (and current) foundation stone was laid on 29 July 1920 by Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII / Duke of Windsor), with an opal encrusted 18ct gold and trowel, designed by Peter Kaad.Scene at the laying of the foundation stone for Brisbane City Hall, July 1920 – Queensland Digital Library The site was swampy and contained a creek. Pumping was needed to keep the site dry. Construction operations began in 1920. One man died as he was inspecting the construction site. ===Opening=== Brisbane City Hall around 1930 Although not complete, the building was occupied from 3 January 1928. The lord mayor William Jolly presented a cheque, paying for his electricity bill, as the first official transaction in the new building. City Hall Ann Street foyer Brisbane City Hall was opened in 1930 by Queensland Governor (Sir John Goodwin). The building was officially opened on 8 April 1930 by Lord Mayor of Brisbane William Jolly. However it had been partially occupied since 1927. In 1969 the council commenced the acquisition of the properties to the south of the City Hall, and in 1975 opened the Brisbane Administration Centre (or BAC), a 20-floor tower and surrounding plaza. Most of the Council's offices then moved from the City hall to the BAC. The Council Chambers (located on second floor of the Adelaide Street side of the building), Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor's offices remain however in City Hall. ===Organ=== The 4,391 pipes organ was built in 1891 by Henry Willis & Sons Organ Builders in Liverpool, UK, for the Brisbane Exhibition Building at Bowen Park. It remained in the Exhibition Concert Hall until it was moved to the Brisbane City Hall in 1927. The City Hall's first organ recital was held in 1929. The organ concert held on 14 November 2009 celebrated the 80th anniversary of the organ installation in the Brisbane City Hall and was the last organ recital before building restoration commenced. When City Hall closed on 31 December 2009, the organ was totally dismantled and removed from the building for storage. It was planned that the organs would return to the hall three years later. ===1980s restoration=== In the 1980s work commenced on a full-scale restoration of the building, opening up the side entrance vestibules and restoring a number of the reception rooms to their original design. These reception rooms are named for former local government areas subsumed into Greater Brisbane in 1925, such as the Sherwood Room, and the Ithaca Room. From 2003 the Museum of Brisbane replaced administration offices and had galleries positioned on both sides of the building's entrance from King George Square. ===2010–2013 restoration=== Auditorium Serious problems were identified with the building, including subsidence, concrete cancer, a lack of reinforcing in the concrete and old wiring. The Brisbane City Council set up a taskforce to address the issues, raise awareness, co-ordinate restoration and raise funds. The Brisbane City Hall closed on 31 December 2009, for the three-year restoration project. To undergo large scale restoration works, Brisbane City Hall was closed until April 2013. The restoration works involved replacement of all building services (electrical, mechanical, fire, hydraulic systems etc.), structural works to building interiors, dome and auditorium and conservation of the original heritage surfaces and building façade. The grand organs were removed from the building for the duration of the building works. The Museum of Brisbane was combined into a single venue on the 3rd floor. The Brisbane City Hall was officially reopened to the public on Saturday, 6 April 2013 following a re-dedication ceremony and celebrations. The renovation cost $215 million. ==Design and construction== The clock tower is 91 m (298 ft) high. The façade illuminated at night The building was designed according to the Italian Renaissance style, symmetrical and formal. It has three floors and a partial basement. The total cost of the project including furniture, fitout and furnishing was approximately . Chariot statues included in the original plans were discarded to save costs. The columns supporting the tympanum are of the Corinthian order while the columns extending on either side are of the Ionic order. Lions heads are found above these columns. Above the main entrance is a bronze awning and the doors are also made of bronze. ===Clock tower=== Brisbane City Hall has a clock tower (rising above ground level), based on the design of the St Mark's Campanile in Venice, Italy. When it was built, the four clock faces on each side of the tower were the largest in Australia. Each clock face is in diameter, the hour hands are , and the minute hands are long. The clock has Westminster Chimes, which sound on the quarter-hour, and can be heard from the Queen St Mall and, at times, in the surrounding suburbs. The time keeping is controlled by a master clock imported from England. The dials, hands and slave mechanisms were designed and built in Brisbane by Synchonome. Above the clocks is an observation platform, open to the public and accessible by lift between 10:15 am and 4:45 pm seven days a week, free. For many years this afforded extensive views of Brisbane, but since the relaxation of height limits for surrounding buildings in the late 1960s, the view is now somewhat restricted. ===Auditorium=== Queensland Police Ball, circa 1965alt= The centre of City Hall features an auditorium, based on the Pantheon, Rome, and several smaller reception rooms. The auditorium is a large circular hall that can seat up to 1,600 people and is covered by the largest copper dome in the southern hemisphere. Beneath this dome there are 8,500 L.E.D lights that display a light show. When originally built it was intended that the building would house most of the Council's administrative offices, Aldermen's (councillors') offices, the Council Chamber, a public library and several reception rooms, in addition to the auditorium. As the role of local government increased in the 1950s and 1960s, the reception rooms, hallways and side entrance vestibules (in Adelaide and Ann Streets) were converted to office space. Additional offices were constructed on the roof and in the basement. ===Construction material=== The building is constructed of concrete, brick and steel, with a base of Camp Mountain Granite. The granite was extracted by the first builder, Arthur Midson, from his quarry at Camp Mountain near Samford. This deposit was worked just for the City Hall project. Above Midson's granite base courses, the east, north and west sides are clad in Helidon Freestone, a type of sandstone extracted from Wright's Quarry at Helidon.J.H. Wagner & Sons – About Us . Retrieved 8 April 2013. The sandstone cladding was constructed (together with the rest of the building) by builder Douglas Dunn Carrick. The clock tower has a steel framework, and is clad in the same sandstone. The interior includes four marble columns, two of which support an arch above a ground marble staircase. Granite for the ground floor and basement was sourced from Enoggera. ==Sculptures== ===Pediment=== Daphne Mayo's tympanum above the King George Square entrance to the Brisbane City Hall The sculptured pediment above the portico and entrance, known as the tympanum, was carved by Brisbane sculptor Daphne Mayo during construction of the Hall. There is some controversy surrounding the theme of the tympanum, which depicts the settlement of Queensland. The gown-clad female figure in the centre depicts \\"progress\\" or \\"enlightenment\\", while settlers with their cattle and explorers with their horses, move out from under her protecting arms to claim the land from the indigenous people and native animals, who are represented by two aboriginal males crouching in the left hand corner, and a fleeing kangaroo. To the right corner one can see a young European male and female, adjoined by a sheep and a row of books and an artist's palette representing the new European nation, agriculture and civilisation. The tympanum measures long with a height of at its centre. The sculpture was unveiled eight months after the building was officially opened. King George V at Brisbane City Hall Side view of the two lion sculptures ===King George V and lions=== The bronze lion sculptures and statue of King George V, in front of the King George Square façade of Brisbane City Hall, were initially part of the King George V memorial, which was unveiled in 1938 as a tribute to the King from the citizens of Brisbane. In 2007, the lions, modelled on the bronze lions of Trafalgar Square, London, and the statue, were removed for renovations to the Square. They were re- incorporated into the newly redeveloped King George Square in 2009. ===The Petrie family=== An accompanying bronze work to complement the King George V pediment sculpture, based on the life of the pioneering Brisbane family, the Petrie's (famously of Brisbane's First Mayor John Petrie), known as the Petrie Tableau, also has been removed due to renovations at the square. Petrie Tableau, removed during redevelopment work ==King George Square== The City Hall faces King George Square, named in honour of King George V. Originally this area, between Ann and Adelaide Streets, was much narrower than at present and was called Albert Square. In the late 1960s premises on the square opposite the City Hall were acquired by the City Council, demolished and the area levelled to form a larger square. The creation of the enlarged square was criticised in some quarters as it resulted in the removal of the original imposing flight of stone stairs in front of the building, when the ground level in front of the City Hall was raised to the level of the main entrance. When Albert Square was redeveloped into King George Square, the existing fountain at Albert Square was relocated to Wynnum. King George Square is a common place for public gatherings, rallies and protest marches. As part of the Inner-Northern Busway project, King George Square has been remodelled. ===Forme del Mito=== Forme del Mito, a collection of large bronze thematic sculptured works by Italian artist Arnaldo Pomodoro, one of the more prominent works of art collected for and displayed at Brisbane's Expo '88, previously took pride of place in King George Square. In 2007, they were removed for renovation to take place. They are now situated at the foot of Jacob's Ladder, at the entrance to Wickham Terrace. ===2008/2009 developments=== Redevelopment of King George Square, in front of the Brisbane City Hall, included a new re- modelled public plaza, restaurants, gift shops and a stage. It was completed in October 2009, for the 150th Anniversary of Brisbane as State Capital of Queensland, It is also the site of the new underground King George Square busway station, linking the Queen Street bus station with the Roma Street Station and the northern suburbs. ==Current use== Following the 2010–2013 redevelopment, City Hall's role is primarily to support public gatherings, although it was the major Brisbane venue for classical concerts and arts events for decades, hosting such singers as Richard Tauber and Peter Dawson. In addition to the main auditorium, reception rooms that had been converted to administration spaces over the years have been restored to their original purpose. An industrial kitchen installed in the basement during the renovations provides catering support for events; previously external caterers had to be used, however now City Hall is managed on behalf of Brisbane City Council by EPICURE. Functions, concerts and events can still be hosted by contacting EPICURE. The Museum of Brisbane is now relocated into a purpose- built facility on the rooftop. In addition to a changing program of exhibitions, the museum also operates tours of the building and tours of the clock tower. There are two privately operated cafes in City Hall, the Red Cross Cafe and the Shingle Inn. The Shingle Inn cafe was originally not part of City Hall but was located in Edward Street and was demolished as part of the Queen's Plaza development. However, the iconic interior fittings of the Shingle Inn Cafe were removed and put into storage, allowing it to be reconstructed within the City Hall. The only administrative functions remaining in the city hall are the suite of offices for the Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor. == Awards == In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Brisbane City Hall was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a \\"structure and engineering feat\\". ==References== ==External links== * Google Earth placemark showing location of the Camp Mountain granite quarry.

Tsunamune’s succession and rule was soon opposed by a number of his kinsmen and vassals. This dispute eventually led to the Date Sōdō or \\"Date Disturbance\\" of 1671, which has been retold in theatre, and has become one of the more well-known tales of unrest and disunity among the daimyō of the Edo period. ==Biography== Tsunamune was the sixth son of Date Tadamune by a concubine (Kai-hime, the maternal aunt of Emperor Go-Sai, which thus made him cousin with the Emperor). His courtesy title was Sakonoe-gon-shōshō (General of the Left Guards), and his Court rank was Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade. On the death of his father, he became daimyō and Mutsu-no-kami at the age of 18. Due to his inexperience and his love of sake and women, rumours soon spread that he was unfit to govern. The center of opposition was his uncle, Date Munekatsu, daimyō of Ichinoseki Domain (and Date Masamune’s 10th son), who suborned many of Tsunamune’s retainers. In 1660, this clique of vassals and kinsman made a successful appeal to the rōjū to have Tsunemune removed from office and placed under house arrest in Edo under the charges of public drunkenness and debauchery while he was visiting the capital on sankin-kōtai and to supervise corvée labor on a canal.Turnbull, Stephen (1989). Samurai Warlords, London: Blandford Press, p. 117. He was replaced in Sendai by his infant son, Date Tsunamura, then only age one. The actual government of Sendai Domain was turned over to Date Munekatsu and to another uncle, Tamura Muneyoshi, as guardians.Sansom, George (1963). A History of Japan: 1615–1867 Stanford, California: Stanford University Press. p. 65. This event was the start of the Date Sōdō, which became a favorite theme of popular fiction, including bunraku and kabuki. According to one of the most popular legends, the scheming Date Munekatsu took the impressionable young Tsunamune to the licensed quarters of Yoshiwara, where he passionately fell in love with a prostitute, Takao. However, Takao was already pledged to marry a rōnin when her time at the brothel had expired and she rejected Tsunamune's offers. Undeterred, he offered to buy her contract in gold equal to her weight. The unscrupulous brothel-keeper added weights to her sleeves, so that he had to pay more than 165 pounds of gold. However, when he came to take her to the Date residence, she tried to throw herself in the river rather than go with him. Furious, Tsunamura pulled her from the river by her hair and stabbed her in the heart. His uncle and the other conspirators seized this opportunity to denounce him to the officials of wanton behavior and force his retirement. This story was the basis of many bunraku and kabuki plays, and attracted an extraordinary number of researchers over the years who have tried to determine if there was any truth in the story. It appears that Tsunamura did visit Yoshiwara and was enamoured by the prostitute named Takao, but she died in 1659 of illness and not by his hand.Seigle, Cecilia Segawa, Yoshiwara: The Glittering World of the Japanese Courtesan, University of Hawaii Press, pages 59–61 While Tsunamune remained under house arrest, the domain suffered greatly under the corrupt rule of Date Munekatsu and Tamura Muneyoshi. After ten years of violence and conflict, Aki Muneshige, a relative from a cadet branch of the Date clan and retainer of Tsunamune managed to register a complaint to the shogunate officials about the mismanagement of the domain. Aki and various domain officials were summoned before the council of rōjū and the Tairō Sakai Tadakiyo to testify. Testimony between Aki and the retainers of Munekatsu and Muneyoshi did not agree, and the testimony of Munekatsu’s retainer Harada Munesuke made a particularly poor impression. Harada then murdered Aki before further testimony could be given, before being killed himself by the guards. The court ruled in favor of Aki. The young Date Tsunamura was allowed to remain daimyō; however, his uncles Date Munekatsu and Tamura Muneyoshi were removed from office. As for Tsunamune, he lived the next 50 years in loose house arrest at the clan residence in the Ōi area of Edo, devoting his time to the arts, studying painting under Kanō Tan'yū, calligraphy, waka poetry, Maki-e lacquerware and even learning to forge Japanese swords. A number of his works are on display at The Miyagi Museum of Art. He died in Edo in 1711, but his grave was at the Date clan mausoleum of Zuihōden in Sendai. His mortuary temple was destroyed in 1945 during the Bombing of Sendai during World War II, and reconstructed in 1981. His body was so well preserved that an autopsy could be performed, revealing that he had a height of 158 cm and blood type A+, and had died of oral cancer. ==Family== * Father: Date Tadamune * Mother: Kii-hime (1624–1642) * Concubine: Misawa Hatsuko (1640–1686) ** 1st son: Date Tsunamura, daimyō of Sendai Domain ** 2nd son: Date Murayori (1661–1772), adopted by hatamoto Mizusawa-Date clan, later daimyō of Nakatsuyama sub-domain ** 3rd son: Date Muneyun (1665–1771) adopted by Date Munetoshi, later daimyō of Uwajima Domain * Concubine: Seiun'in ** 1st daughter: Natsuko / Kiyoko, married hatamoto Date Harusane of the Watari-Date clan, remarried to Date Harusada of the Iwaya-Date clan ** 4th son: Date Muranao (1666–1709), adopted by hatamoto Date Munetomo of the cadet Tome-Date clan ** 3rd daughter: Sanhime married Nakamura Moriyoshi * Concubine: Ohari no Kata ** 2nd daughter: Ruihime, married hatamoto Date Muramoto of the Watari-Date clan ** 4th daughter: Senhime, died in infancy ** 5th daughter: Chiehime, married Tachibana Sadaakira * Concubine: Yosei'in ** 6th daughter: Kirahime, adopted by Date Tsunamura, married Honda Yasunobu, daimyō of Zeze Domain ** 7th daughter: Narehime, died in infancy ** 5th son: Date Kikunosuke, died in infancy ** 8th daughter, Musuhime, died in infancy * Concubine: Bo-dono ** 6th son: Date Kichijuro, died in infancy * Concubine: Otome no Kata ** 9th daughter: Yuhime, died in infancy * Concubine: Kayo no Kata ** Onohime, died in infancy ==See also== *Date Sōdō ==References== *Papinot, Edmond.

Although he is sometimes claimed to have been a drummer or singer, frontman Jello Biafra has stated that 6025 was recruited solely as a guitarist. The other members joined after answering an ad placed by Ray. Biafra stated, \\"[A] week before our first gig we got a guitarist who called himself 6025 and he left about six months later\\". He actually parted with the band roughly eight months later, in March 1979. According to Biafra, he was the best all-around musician in the band, however his taste for prog rock and idiosyncratic songwriting alienated him from the rest of the band. 6025's final live appearance with Dead Kennedys was on March 3, 1979. The performance was taped and a few tracks appeared on compilation before being officially released in its entirety 25 years later as Live at the Deaf Club.

However, it does not grow high enough to become a canopy tree, and once the gap above it closes through succession, it responds by flowering and fruiting profusely, and to some degree spreading by vegetative reproduction. Mammals such as moose, deer, beavers, and rabbits eat the bark, particularly during the winter. ==References== ==External links== *NRCS: United States Department of Agriculture Plants Profile and map: Acer pennsylvanicum *Interactive Distribution Map of Acer pensylvanicum pensylvanicum Category:Hardwood forest plants Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains Category:Flora of Eastern Canada Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Acer pensylvanicum"},{"id":"2561677","text":"Kravaře (; ) is a town in Opava District the Moravian-Silesian Region of the Czech Republic.

The phrase derives from the plot of a number of fables ascribed to Aesop and is used here as their generic title. There are two main types of story, which exist in several different versions. Other fables exist in the East that feature division of prey in such a way that the divider gains the greater part - or even the whole. ==The Phaedrus version== Francis Barlow's edition of Aesop's Fables, 1687 The early Latin version of PhaedrusFabula I.5 begins with the reflection that \\"Partnership with the mighty is never trustworthy\\". It then relates how a cow, a goat and a sheep go hunting together with a lion. When it comes to dividing the spoil, the lion says, \\"I take the first portion because of my title, since I am addressed as king; the second portion you will assign to me, since I’m your partner; then because I am the stronger, the third will follow me; and an accident will happen to anyone who touches the fourth.\\" This was listed as Fable 339 in the Perry Index and was later the version followed by William Caxton in his 1484 collection of the Fables. The number of differing variations circulating by the time of the Middle Ages is witnessed by the fact that Marie de France included two in her 12th century Ysopet.The Fables of Marie de France, ed. Mary Lou Martin, Birmingham AL, pp.56-8; Google Books Both appear under the title \\"The Lion Goes Hunting\\" (De Leone Venante). On one occasion, she recounts, the lion is joined by officers of his court, a wild ox and a wolf, who divide the catch into three and invite their lord to apportion it. Then on another occasion, when the lion is accompanied by a goat and a sheep, the deer they take is divided into four. In both cases the lion begins by claiming portions as a legal right and retains the others with threats. In La Fontaine's Fables there is a fourfold division between a heifer, a goat and a lamb (Fables I.6). Each of these the lion retains because he is king, the strongest, the bravest, and will kill the first who touches the fourth part.“The Heifer, the Goat and the Lamb in Consort with the Lion”, translated by Norman Shapiro, in The Complete Fables of Jean de La Fontaine, University of Illinois 2010, pp.8-9 A Latin reference to Aesop's fable is found at the start of the Common Era, where the phrase societas leonina (a leonine company) was used by one Roman lawyer to describe the kind of unequal business partnership described by Aesop.The differences in interpretation between three versions of the fable is discussed in the article Societas Leonina or the lion's share by Brian Møller Jensen, in Eranos: Acta philologica Suecana Vol. CII (2004), pp.97-104 The early 19th century writer Jefferys Taylor also retold the fable in terms of a commercial enterprise in his poem \\"The Beasts in Partnership\\": :::This firm once existed, I'd have you to know, :::Messrs Lion, Wolf, Tiger, Fox, Leopard & Co; :::These in business were join'd, and of course 'twas implied, :::They their stocks should unite, and the profits divide.Aesop in Rhyme, London, 1828, pp.76-7 ==The Babrius version== In the extended Greek telling of Babrius it is a wild donkey and a lion who go hunting together, the first outstanding for strength, the second for speed. The lion divides their take into three, awarding himself the first because he is king of the beasts, the second because they are 'equal' partners, and suggesting that the ass runs away quickly rather than dare to touch the third. The moral Babrius draws is, \\"Measure yourself! Do not engage in any business or partnership with a man more powerful!\\" Another version that first appeared in the Middle Ages is more cynical still. A fox joins the lion and donkey in hunting. When the donkey divides their catch into three equal portions, the angry lion kills the donkey and eats him. The fox then puts everything into one pile, leaving just a tiny bit for herself, and tells the lion to choose. When the lion asks her how she learned to share things this way, the fox replies, \\"From the donkey’s misfortune.\\" This variation is given a separate number (149) in the Perry Index and is the one followed by such Neo-Latin writers as Gabriele FaernoFabulae Centum (1564), fable 3, p.9 and Hieronymus OsiusFabulae Aesopi (1564), fable 78 and in English by Geoffrey Whitney.Choice of Emblemes (1586), p.154 This alternative fable was given a different reading by the 13th century Persian poet, Rumi in his Masnavi. He began by orienting the reader to interpret the fable in a spiritual sense: ::Melt away your existence, as copper in the elixir, in the being of Him who fosters existence. ::You have fastened both your hands tight on 'I' and 'we': all this ruin is caused by dualism. In Rumi's telling, the lion had a wolf and a fox as hunting companions. The lion ordered the wolf to divide the catch and when it did so into three parts, tore off the wolf’s head, just as the lion tore the donkey to pieces in Aesop’s fable. Rumi's speciality, however, is always to offer an explanation of his actors' motives. In this case the lion explains that it is an act of grace for him to do so since the wolf did not recognise superiority when he saw it. When the fox was tested in the same way, he did not even retain a morsel for himself, explaining (as in the Greek version) that he had learned wisdom from the wolf's fate and thanking the lion for giving him the privilege of going second. This allows Rumi to conclude that we are lucky to be living now, with the examples of past generations to guide us. Rumi’s fox then worships at the feet of the lion, addressing him with the words \\"O king of the world\\" and is duly rewarded for this devotion with everything that he had resigned to the divine king. Much the same interpretation was given to the tale by Rumi's English contemporary, Odo of Cheriton, in the Latin work known as Parabolae. For him too the lion is a symbol of God and his actions are interpreted as an expression of divine justice. Odo explains that the lion punished the wolf, as God did Adam, for the sin of disobedience. The moral of the story is to learn from this example to show reverence to God, just as the fox learned from the wolf’s punishment. This reading of the fable therefore gained currency in Western Europe too, both via the preachers who used Odo's book as a source of stories for their sermons and through translations of it into French, Spanish and Welsh.There is a translation by John C. Jacobs: The Fables of Odo of Cheriton, New York, 1985; and a limited preview on Google Books ==Other related Eastern fables== There is a close family resemblance between fables where the lion takes all because he can and fables where an arbiter takes advantage of his powerful position, and indeed both are type 51 in the Aarne–Thompson classification system. The 10th-century Arabic Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity tells one such arbitration fable, said there to be of Indian origin. Here a group of foxes are sharing a dead camel. They cannot decide how to divide it among themselves and persuade a passing wolf to make a just division. At first the wolf begins to do this, but on further consideration he decides to keep the rest for himself, as he is, after all, more powerful. (In this case, however, the foxes appeal to the lion who decides in their favour and kills the wolf and returns the camel to them.) The tale of the jackal and the otters, a 2nd-century BCE Indian sculpture from the Bharhut stupa This fable shades into an Indian variant of the story, first told as the Dabbhapuppha Jataka,The Jataka or stories of the Buddha's former births, ed. E.B. Cowell, Cambridge University Press, 1895, pp.205-7, archive.org which features different animals but has at its centre the same situation of an animal making an unequal division. Here a jackal offers to arbitrate between two otters who are quarrelling over a fish they have co- operated in bringing to land. The jackal awards them the head and tail and runs off with the bulk of their catch. As well as being a condemnation of the greed that leads to strife, the tale takes a sceptical view of how the powerful frame the law to suit themselves, concluding with the satirical verse, ::Just as, when strife arises among men, ::They seek an arbiter: he's leader then; ::Their wealth decays and the king's coffers gain. In that the tale deals with outside arbitration, however, it has certain points in common with another of Aesop's fables, The Lion, the Bear and the Fox, in which the first two beasts simultaneously attack a kid and then fight over their spoil. When they are both too exhausted to move, a fox steals their prey and leaves them to reflect, \\"How much better it would have been to have shared in a friendly spirit.\\" ==References== ==External links== Category:Aesop's Fables Category:English phrases Category:English-language idioms Category:Fictional lions Category:Hunting The heifer, the goat and the sheep in company with the lion ","title":"Lion's share"},{"id":"2561687","text":"The Temptations Do the Temptations is a 1976 album by The Temptations for the Gordy (Motown) label.

It is a pseudoscientific supernatural explanation of the effects of gravity. The joke originated on Usenet, and has appeared in several online parodies. An article about Intelligent Falling in The Onion described free fall as being caused by \\"the hand of God\\". Intelligent Falling proposes that the scientific explanation of gravitational force cannot explain all aspects of the phenomenon, so credence should be given to the idea that things fall because a higher intelligence is moving them. Furthermore, IF asserts that theories explaining gravity are not internally consistent nor mathematically reconcilable with quantum mechanics, making gravity a \\"theory in crisis\\". IF also makes the claim that gravity is \\"only a theory\\", parodying the claims made by creationists regarding the theoretical status of evolution. IF apologists jokingly advocate that IF should be taught in school along with the theory of gravity so that students can make \\"an informed decision\\" on the subject, in a parody of the demands to \\"teach the controversy\\". ==History== In June 2002 a user named Jeff Stubbs posted a draft of a letter to the editor that mentions \\"intelligent grappling\\" to the alt.atheism and talk.origins usenet groups. He commented that \\"I don't like the theory of gravity, I feel personally insulted that engineers design structures only considering physical mass. What about our souls? I propose that science classes also teach the theory of \\"Intelligent Grappling\\". There's no way a weak force such as gravity can possibly hold everything onto the planet.

He held various municipal offices under the Revolution and came in 1793 to Paris, where he produced his first opera, Le Rêve, in 1799, in collaboration with Antoine- Frédéric Gresnick. Although Étienne continued to write for the Paris theatres for twenty years from that date, he is remembered chiefly as the author of one comedy, which excited considerable controversy. Les Deux Gendres was represented at the Théâtre Français on 11 August 1810, and procured for its author a seat in the Académie française. A rumour was put in circulation that Étienne had drawn largely on a manuscript play in the imperial library, entitled Conaxa, ou les gendres dupes. His rivals were not slow to take up the charge of plagiarism, to which Étienne replied that the story was an old one (it existed in an old French fabliaus) and had already been treated by Alexis Piron in Les Fils ingrats. He was, however, driven later to make admissions which at least showed a certain lack of candour. The bitterness of the attacks made on him was no doubt in part due to his position as editor-in-chief of the official Journal de l'Empire. His next play, L'Intrigante (1812), hardly maintained the high level of Les Deux Gendres; the patriotic opera L'Oriflamme and his lyric masterpiece Joconde date from 1814. Étienne had been secretary to Hugues-Bernard Maret, Duc de Bassano, and in this capacity had accompanied Napoleon throughout his campaigns in Italy, Germany, Austria and Poland. During these journeys he produced one of his best pieces, Brueys et Palaprat (1807). During the Restoration Étienne was an active member of the opposition. He was seven times returned as deputy for the département of Meuse, and was in full sympathy with the revolution of 1830, but the reforms actually carried out did not fulfil his expectations, and he gradually retired from public life. Among his other plays may be noted: Les Deux Mères, Le Pacha de Suresnes, and La Petite Ecole des pres, all produced in 1802, in collaboration with his friend Charles Gaugiran de Nanteuil (1778–1830). With Alphonse Dieudonné Martainville (1779–1830) he wrote an Histoire du Théâtre Français (5 vols, 1802) during the revolutionary period. Étienne was a bitter opponent of the romanticists, one of whom, Alfred de Vigny, was his successor and panegyrist in the Academy. He was an Officer in the Legion of Honour, and was buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.http://www.appl- lachaise.net/appl/article.php3?id_article=928 In Bruis et Palaprat, Étienne penned the phrase \\"On n'est jamais servi si bien que par soi-même\\", which has widely been translated as \\"If you want something done right, do it yourself\\", although the literal translation is \\"One is never served so well as by oneself\\".Bruis et Palaprat by Charles-Guillaume Étienne, published in 1807, Madame Masson (Paris)Dictionary of Quotations (French) == Works == Caricature by Honoré Daumier Theatre *1799: Le Rêve, opéra comique in 1 act and in prose, lyrics by citizen Étienne, music by citizen Gresnich, Paris, Opéra-Comique, 8 pluviôse an VII *1800: Rembrandt ou la Vente après décès, vaudeville anecdotique in 1 act, by citizens Étienne, Morel, Servière and Moras, Théâtre des Troubadours, 26 fructidor an VIII *1800: Le Chaudronnier, Homme d'État, comedy in three acts and in prose, Théâtre de l'Ambigu-Comique, 1er thermidor an VIII *1800: La Lettre sans adresse, comedy in 1 act and in prose, mingled with vaudevilles... by citizens Étienne and Moras, Théâtre des Troubadours, 26 vendémiaire an IX *1800: L'Apollon du Belvédere ou l'Oracle, folie-vaudeville impromptue in 1 act, by citizens Étienne, Moras and Gaugiran-Nanteuil, Théâtre des Troubadours, 29, 30 brumaire, 1er, 2 and 3 frimaire an IX *1801: Pont-de- Veyle ou le Bonnet de docteur, comédie en vaudeville in 1 act, by citizens Gosse and Étienne, Théâtre des Variétés, 6 vendémiaire an X *1801: Désirée ou la Paix du village, allegory in 1 act, in vaudevilles, by citizens Gaugiran- Nanteuil, Moras and Étienne, Théâtre Favart, 5 germinal an IX *1801: Le Grand Deuil, opéra bouffon, lyrics by citizens J.-B.

It was written by the lead singer, Kazufumi Miyazawa, based on his impressions from visiting Okinawa for a photo shoot. It is the band's best selling song, well known throughout Japan and Argentina, and one of the most widely known songs associated with Okinawa although the band members are all from Yamanashi Prefecture. The song uses a mix of modern pop and rock styles as well as min'yō. Okinawan musical instruments and Okinawan vocabulary have been incorporated into the song. The song itself was used in an advertising campaign for the Xi brand awamori. ==Origin== In a 2003 interview for fRoots, Miyazawa explained that he got the idea for the song after speaking with Okinawan survivors of the US invasion of Okinawa during World War II. In another interview, Miyazawa explained that most Okinawan casualties were not caused by American troops, but by Japan's instructions to commit suicide rather than surrender. While the song does not specify who the people being separated are, Miyazawa stated in the 2002 interview, \\"It is about the separation of a man and a woman, a separation that they couldn't control, and didn't want.\\" ==Okinawan influence== In fact, the term shima-uta originally refers to traditional folk songs of the Amami Islands. It is not a native term of Okinawa but was introduced from Amami in the 1970s. Uehara Naohiko, Okinawa's influential radio personality and songwriter, borrowed the term from Amami and give a new meaning to the term. He used his radio programs and musical events to popularize the name of shima- uta in Okinawa. Miyazawa first heard Okinawan-influenced music from Haruomi Hosono in the 1970s. Later, he asked friends to bring him tapes from the island, as Okinawan music was not readily available in Japan. Miyazawa said in the 2003 interview, Miyazawa plays the sanshin, the Okinawan precursor to the shamisen, when singing \\"Shima Uta\\" in concert. ==Release history== There were initially two versions of \\"Shima Uta\\" released by The Boom. The first release is the which is sung partly in Japanese and partly in Okinawan (uchinaaguchi), and was released as a single on December 12, 1992. The followed on June 21, 1993, and is sung entirely in Japanese, although some words from Okinawan remain (such as ウージ uuji, which means sugarcane Wuuji/Uuji Retrieved 2019/08/26). These versions of the song were performed at the 44th annual Kōhaku Uta Gassen. The Boom periodically re-released \\"Shima Uta\\", first on October 5, 2001, as a rearranged version as a double A-side to their song \\"Kamisama no Hōseki de Dekita Shima\\" which was later remixed for the band's 2002 album Okinawa: Watashi no Shima. 2002 also saw the release of a new \\"Shima Uta\\" single on May 22 which included vocals from Argentine vocalist Alfredo Casero who became famous in his own right for his cover of the song. The Boom with Casero performed this version at the 53rd Kōhaku Uta Gassen. On March 20, 2013, The Boom released a new 20th anniversary version of the song and single. ==Music video== The music video for \\"Shima Uta\\" was filmed on Okinawa Prefecture's Taketomi Island, with Taketomi Village's \\"traditional Okinawan\\"It is recognized in academics that Taketomi's \\"traditional\\" landscape is a modern product. For more information, see: and houses featured prominently along with local flora and fauna. For the 20th anniversary version, The Boom returned to Taketomi and filmed local residents, as well as some other notable residents of Okinawa Prefecture, lip syncing the song with Miyazawa's vocals. ==Cover versions== The song has been covered by many artists, including Gackt, Rimi Natsukawa, Tokiko Kato, Alfredo Casero, Plastiko, Diana King, Andrew W.K., Willy Sabor and Allister. ===Gackt=== The Gackt's version features taiko drums, traditional dancers and singers, and China Sadao as sanshin player/min'yō singer. ===Alfredo Casero=== The 2001 version by Casero won three awards at Premios Gardel, the \\"Argentine Grammy Awards.\\" In 2002 the Casero version was voted the theme song for the Argentina football (soccer) team's 2002 FIFA World Cup. A Japanese football fan club, Ultras Nippon, also used Shima Uta as their theme song.An Island Song Goes Borderless Web Japan, July 2002. Retrieved 2/6/08 \\"Shima Uta\\" was the first Argentine hit song to be sung entirely in Japanese. It stayed on the top of the charts for six months.

Patsalos in New York City to Greek parents. When Patler was five, his mother took him and his younger brother, George (born 1939), and moved to Patler's grandmother's house. Shortly after, his mother was shot and killed by his father. Patler's father was sent to Sing Sing Prison, then released on parole in 1953. After Patler's grandmother died, he and his brother were sent to the Bronx to live with their father. Both brothers spent two weeks at the Youth House while their father was facing child abuse charges, but were subsequently released back into his custody. Patler served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1958 to 1960, when he was honorably discharged on grounds of \\"unsuitability\\" after being arrested at an American Nazi Party rally. He joined the party in 1960 and soon changed his name to Patler to make it sound more like \\"Hitler\\". Patler later became a captain in the American Nazi Party and the editor and cartoonist for the party's magazine, Stormtrooper. However, he was expelled from the Party in March 1967 for alleged \\"Bolshevik leanings\\" after disagreeing with party leader George Lincoln Rockwell about some of the party's policies. Patler later described his relationship with Rockwell in very endearing terms, stating \\"I loved him like a father and he loved me like a son\\". In his last known letter to Rockwell, Patler wrote \\"I don't think there are two people on earth who think and feel the same as we do. ... You are a very important part of my life. I need you as much as you need me. Without you there is no future\\". On August 25, 1967, Patler shot and killed Rockwell while Rockwell was getting into his car, which was parked in front of a self-service laundry at an Arlington, Virginia, shopping center. Rockwell was shot with a 7.63mm Broomhandle Mauser pistol. Patler was arrested half an hour later, about a mile from the scene of the shooting. Patler was convicted of first-degree murder on December 16, 1967, by an Arlington jury and subsequently sentenced to 20 years in prison by Arlington Circuit Court Judge Charles Russell. Patler was paroled from prison in 1975, having served less than eight years of his sentence. After later violating his parole, he received an additional six-year sentence. Many years later, Patler was with his son, Nicholas, when he expressed regret for his time in the ANP. According to Nicholas, Patler said \\"I should have been with Dr. King and the Civil Rights people back then. They were truly my people, not those Nazis.\\" ==References== Category:1938 births Category:American neo-Nazis Category:American people convicted of murder Category:American people of Greek descent Category:Living people Category:People convicted of murder by Virginia Category:Criminals from New York City Category:Military personnel from New York City Category:United States Marines category:American assassins Category:American cartoonists ","title":"John Patler"},{"id":"2561733","text":"The Temptations Christmas Card is a 1970 Christmas album by The Temptations for the Gordy (Motown) label.

It was a relatively common infantry weapon in Ancient China, and was also used by cavalry and charioteers. In the Song dynasty, several weapons were referred to as ji, but they were developed from spears, not from ancient ji.

Another type was the fangtian ji (), which had a spear tip with crescent blades on both sides.Jiang Feng-wei (蔣豐維), Chinese weapons dictionary (中國兵器事典)Sadaharu Ichikawa (市川定春), Dictionary of the Weapon (武器事典) They had multiple means of attack: the side blade or blades, the spear tip, plus often a rear counterweight that could be used to strike the opponent. The way the side blades were fixed to the shaft differs, but usually there were empty spaces between the pole and the side blade. The wielder could strike with the shaft, with the option of then pulling the weapon back to hook with a side blade; or, he could slap his opponent with the flat side of the blade to knock him off his horse. ==Popular legend== The Ji is popularized through a historical character known as Lü Bu.

It arises from the nasal part of the frontal bone, from the frontal process of the maxilla in front of the lacrimal groove, and from the anterior surface and borders of a short fibrous band, the medial palpebral ligament. From this origin, the fibers are directed laterally, forming a broad and thin layer, which occupies the eyelids or palpebræ, surrounds the circumference of the orbit, and spreads over the temple, and downward on the cheek. ==Structure== There are at least 3 clearly defined sections of the orbicularis muscle. However, it is not clear whether the lacrimal section is a separate section, or whether it is just an extension of the preseptal and pretarsal sections.http://vmede.org/sait/content/Anatomija_bili4_t1/4_files/mb4_216.jpeg ===Orbital orbicularis=== The orbital portion is thicker and of a reddish color; its fibers form a complete ellipse without interruption at the lateral palpebral commissure; the upper fibers of this portion blend with the frontalis and corrugator. ===Palpebral orbicularis=== The palpebral portion of the muscle is thin and pale; it arises from the bifurcation of the medial palpebral ligament, forms a series of concentric curves, and is inserted into the lateral palpebral raphe at the outer canthus (corner) of the eye.\\"Eye, Human.\\"Encyclopædia Britannica from Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD 2010 The palpebral portion contains the preseptal and pretarsal muscles. The pretarsal orbicularis is thought to be responsible for the spontaneous blink ===Lacrimal orbicularis=== The lacrimal part is a small, thin muscle, about 6 mm in breadth and 12 mm in length, situated behind the medial palpebral ligament and lacrimal sac. It arises from the posterior crest and adjacent part of the orbital surface of the lacrimal bone, and passing behind the lacrimal sac, divides into two slips, upper and lower, which are inserted into the superior and inferior tarsi medial to the puncta lacrimalia; occasionally it is very indistinct. The lacrimal orbicularis facilitates the tear pump into the lacrimal sac. ==Function== The muscle acts to close the eye, and is the only muscle capable of doing so. Loss of function for any reason results in an inability to close the eye, necessitating eye drops at the minimum to surgical closure of the eye in extreme cases. The palpebral portion acts involuntarily, closing the lids gently, as in sleep or in blinking; the orbital portion is subject to conscious control. When the entire muscle is brought into action, the skin of the forehead, temple, and cheek is drawn toward the medial angle of the orbit, and the eyelids are firmly closed, as in photophobia. The skin thus drawn upon is thrown into folds, especially radiating from the lateral angle of the eyelids; these folds become permanent in senescence, and form the so-called \\"crow's feet\\". The Levator palpebræ superioris is the direct antagonist of this muscle; it raises the upper eyelid and exposes the front of the bulb of the eye. In addition, the orbital and palpebral portions can work independent of each other, as in the furrowing of the brows by contraction of the orbital to reduce glare while keeping the eyes open by virtue of the relaxation of the palpebral. Each time the eyelids are closed through the action of the orbicularis, the medial palpebral ligament is tightened, the wall of the lacrimal sac is thus drawn lateralward and forward, so that a vacuum is made in it and the tears are sucked along the lacrimal canals into it. The lacrimal part of the orbicularis oculi draws the eyelids and the ends of the lacrimal canals medialward and compresses them against the surface of the globe of the eye, thus placing them in the most favorable situation for receiving the tears; it also compresses the lacrimal sac. This part comprises two pieces: Horner's muscle and the muscle of Riolan, the latter helps hold the eyelids together to keep the lacrimal passage waterproof. Associated pathology, such as a lesion of the facial nerve seen in Bell's palsy results in the inability to blink or close the ipsilateral eyelid. Subsequent lack of irrigation increases the risk of corneal inflammation and ulcers. A number of auxiliary muscles assist in cooperating with the eyelid muscles. For example, the corrugator supercilii pulls the eyebrows to the bridge of the nose, making a roof over the middle of the forehead and forehead wrinkles, used mainly to protect the eyes from excess sunlight. The procerus (pyramidalis) muscles, in the bridge of the nose, arise from the lower nasal bone to the lower forehead, on each side of the midline. The procerus muscles pull the skin into horizontal wrinkles. The frontalis muscle, which runs from the upper forehead, halfway between the coronal suture (which traverses the top of the skull) and the top edge of the orbit, attaches to the eyebrow skin. Since it pulls the eyebrows upward, it is the antagonist of the orbicularis oculi. It is used in looking up, and increasing vision if there is insufficient light or when objects are far away. ==Clinical significance== It is involved in the corneal reflex, part of the assessment of the function of the facial nerve. This can be used to examine the facial nerve even in unconscious patients. ==References== ==External links== * PTCentral Category:Muscles of the head and neck ","title":"Orbicularis oculi muscle"},{"id":"2561793","text":"The orbital or horizontal part of the frontal bone (pars orbitalis) consists of two thin triangular plates, the orbital plates, which form the vaults of the orbits, and are separated from one another by a median gap, the ethmoidal notch. == Surfaces == * The inferior surface of each orbital plate is smooth and concave, and presents, laterally, under cover of the zygomatic process, a shallow depression, the lacrimal fossa, for the lacrimal gland; near the nasal part is a depression, the fovea trochlearis, or occasionally a small trochlear spine, for the attachment of the cartilaginous pulley of the obliquus oculi superior. * The superior surface is convex, and marked by depressions for the convolutions of the frontal lobes of the brain, and faint grooves for the meningeal branches of the ethmoidal vessels. ** The ethmoidal notch separates the two orbital plates; it is quadrilateral, and filled, in the articulated skull, by the cribriform plate of the ethmoid. *** The margins of the notch present several half-cells which, when united with corresponding half-cells on the upper surface of the ethmoid, complete the ethmoidal air cells. ** Two grooves cross these edges transversely; they are converted into the anterior and posterior ethmoidal canals by the ethmoid, and open on the medial wall of the orbit. *** The anterior canal transmits the nasociliary nerve and anterior ethmoidal vessels, *** the posterior, the posterior ethmoidal nerve and vessels. * In front of the ethmoidal notch, on either side of the frontal spine, are the openings of the frontal air sinuses. ** These are two irregular cavities, which extend backward, upward, and lateralward for a variable distance between the two tables of the skull; they are separated from one another by a thin bony septum, which often deviates to one or other side, with the result that the sinuses are rarely symmetrical. ** Absent at birth, they are usually fairly well-developed between the seventh and eighth years, but only reach their full size after puberty. ** They vary in size in different persons, and are larger in men than in women. ** They are lined by mucous membrane, and each communicates with the corresponding nasal cavity by means of a passage called the frontonasal duct. ==Additional images== Image:Orbital_bones.pngThe seven bones which articulate to form the orbit.

It is broader than the occipitalis and its fibers are longer and paler in color. It is located on the front of the head. The muscle has no bony attachments. Its medial fibers are continuous with those of the procerus; its intermediate fibers blend with the corrugator and orbicularis oculi muscles, thus attached to the skin of the eyebrows; and its lateral fibers are also blended with the latter muscle over the zygomatic process of the frontal bone. From these attachments the fibers are directed upward, and join the galea aponeurotica below the coronal suture. The medial margins of the frontalis muscles are joined together for some distance above the root of the nose; but between the occipitales there is a considerable, though variable, interval, occupied by the galea aponeurotica. ==Function== In humans, the frontalis muscle only serves for facial expressions. In the eyebrows, its primary function is to lift them (thus opposing the orbital portion of the orbicularis), especially when looking up. It also acts when a view is too distant or dim.\\"eye, human.\\"Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008.

Atari User was a general-interest computer magazine, containing games reviews as well as type-in programs, tutorials and hardware projects. As with Database's other publications, its appearance was somewhat conservative in comparison with its more games-oriented contemporaries, such as Computer and Video Games (C&VG;). The editorial style was equally restrained and relatively formal. Andre Willey was one of the early editors of this magazine after being promoted from Technical Editor. ==History== Early editions primarily focused on the Atari 8-bit family (400/800/XL/XE) and the newly launched Atari ST range (although they included news of other Atari products such as the relaunched Atari 2600 and Atari 7800 consoles). As the popularity of the ST increased, it was given its own pull-out section called \\"Atari ST User\\". From the April 1987 issue onward, Atari ST User was spun off as a magazine in its own right and went on to outlive its parent by a number of years. After the split, Atari User was almost entirely oriented towards the 8-bit computers. Until late 1987, when Page 6 magazine became available on newsstands, Atari User was the only British magazine with dedicated (or even significant) support for the 8-bit Atari line to be sold in shops. Following publication of the final issue in November 1988, Database sold the 'Atari User' name (but not 'Atari ST User') to the publishers of Page 6 magazine, an independent rival. Page 6 was briefly renamed Page 6 Atari User, before settling on New Atari User. Despite the name, New Atari User was to all intents and purposes the same magazine as Page 6; it had virtually no editorial continuity with the old Atari User. ==See also== *Antic *ANALOG Computing ==References== __NOTOC__ Category:1985 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Defunct computer magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Atari 8-bit computer magazines Category:Atari ST magazines Category:Magazines established in 1985 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1988 Category:Video game magazines published in the United Kingdom ","title":"Atari User"},{"id":"2561818","text":"Charles Beilby Stuart-Wortley, 1st Baron Stuart of Wortley (15 September 1851 – 24 April 1926), was a British Conservative politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1880 until 1916, shortly before he was raised to the peerage.

She also acted as regent of the Duchy of Bohemia from 921 to 924 during the minority of her son Wenceslaus. She is chiefly known for the murder of her mother-in-law Ludmila of Bohemia by hired assassins. ==Life== Drahomíra was born in the present-day Havelland region centered around the fortress of Brandenburg (Brennabor), the daughter of a Hevelli (Stodoran) prince. According to Cosmas of Prague, she married Duke Vratislav I of Bohemia about 906. Drahomíra gave birth to at least six children: her sons were Wenceslaus and Boleslaus, who both succeeded their father as Bohemian dukes. Among her four daughters was one Přibislava, whose considered to have married to a Croatian prince, who became a nun at the Prague St. George's Convent, and possibly Střezislava, the wife of the Bohemian nobleman Slavník, founder of the Slavník dynasty. The marriage led the Přemyslid dynasty to cooperation with the Polabian Slavs and brought Bohemia in conflict with the Saxon duke Henry the Fowler, who became German king in 919 and later waged war against the Hevelli tribes. Ludmila and Drahomíra with young Wenceslaus, 19th-century painting After her husband's untimely death in 921, the Bohemian nobles designated Drahomíra regent for her minor son Wenceslaus. However, she had to divide the government of Bohemia with her mother-in-law Ludmila, widow of Duke Bořivoj I, who took over the religious education of her sons. Popular history depicts Ludmila as a restrained and pious grandmother, but it is likely that the political demands of government called for more energy and worldliness than history records. Wenceslaus was one of the main reasons for the eventually fatal discord between Drahomíra and Ludmila, who had exerted great influence over Drahomíra's eldest son, leaving Drahomíra to concentrate her efforts on her younger son, Boleslaus. Despite or perhaps as a result of her political and personal efforts, Ludmila attracted Drahomíra's bitter enmity. She alleged that her mother-in-law, with the help of Bavarian missionaries, educated Wenceslaus to become a monk rather than a prince. Moreover, the two women may have disagreed whether to recognise the East Frankish supremacy of Henry the Fowler. Ludmila fled from Prague to Tetín Castle on the road to Regensburg, where on 16 September 921 Drahomíra's henchmen, Tunna and Gommon, attacked and strangled her. The next year the troops of Duke Arnulf of Bavaria raided the Bohemian duchy. When Drahomíra's son Wenceslaus came of age about 922, he sent his mother into exile, though he called her back in 925. She spent her later years in Prague, however, upon the murder of her son she fled from the court to the Croats. While some considered that the Croats lived near Prague, others noted that in the case of noble and royal fugitives tried to find security as distant as possible, indicating these Croats probably were located more to the East around Vistula valley. ==In culture== She is the subject of two operas, Drahomíra by František Škroup (1848), and Drahomíra by Karel Šebor (1867). ==References== ==Bibliography== *Ancestral Roots of Certain American Colonists Who Came to America Before 1700 by Frederick Lewis Weis; Line 244–7 ==External links== *Busta Drahomíry, matky sv.

It was published in 1995 by Rasputin Software. In this game, the player is a BASE jumper who jumps from towers. Each tower is a level through which the player must work himself, up towards the top in a platform gaming sequence.

It is often served with makkara (i.e. sausage). Turun sinappi was first launched by Turku foodstuffs manufacturer Jalostaja in 1926. The mustard got its name after the Finnish city of Turku. It is sold in yellow 250 g tubes. It consists of dark yellow finely ground mustard and various other spices. There are four types of Turun sinappi: Mieto (mild) with a green cap, Väkevä (strong) with a red cap, Tulinen (fiery) with a black cap and Linnan sinappi (Mustard of the Castle) with blue cap. The logo sports the profile of Turku castle. The most popular type is the \\"red\\" range (Väkevä), which has a distinctive taste. There was a controversy over the name in the early 2000s, when Unilever bought out the original manufacturer. When the brand was bought, the production was moved to Uppsala in Sweden. In 2008, the production was moved again, to Poland. In 2014, the production was moved back to Finland. A replacement product, produced by Turku foodstuffs manufacturer Lunden with the same recipe as the Turun sinappi, named Auran Sinappi was established in Finland. Now Auran sinappi has captured 25% of the market share. Turun sinappi is remembered for its TV commercials, which at a time were frequently shown on Finnish TV. The slogan was \\"Kahta en vaihda\\", meaning \\"There are two things that I'll never change\\". The commercials usually featured someone saying \\"There are two things that I'll never change.

The affair is named after David Pacifico, a British subject born in Gibraltar. == Immediate antagonism == The dispute began in 1847 after the house of Jewish former Portuguese consul- general to Greece, David Pacifico, better known as \\"Don Pacifico\\" – who had been dismissed from his consulship for exceeding his authority repeatedly during 1842, but who continued to reside in AthensGiannis Kairofylas, The history of Psiri District (Η ιστορία της συνοικίας του Ψυρή), Filippotis Editions, Athens 2000, p. 102 – was attacked and vandalised by a mob that included the sons of a government minister, while police, according to Pacifico's claims, watched and neglected to intervene. James Mayer de Rothschild had been visiting Athens during the Greek Orthodox Easter (which was on April 4) to discuss a possible loan,The House of Rothschild had already loaned the Greek Government 60,000,000 francs in 1832, in order to establish the monarchy. Niall Ferguson, The House of Rothschild, Money's Prophets 1798–1848 (New York: Penguin 1998), p. 256. and the city government decided to ban the traditional custom of burning the effigy of Judas,Giannis Kairofylas, The history of Psiri District (Η ιστορία της συνοικίας του Ψυρή), Filippotis Editions, Athens 2000, p. 102 thinking that Rothschild might be offended by the tradition.James Brown Scott (editor), Cases on International Law (St. Paul: West Publishing Co., 1922), p. 510. As Scott reports it: > It appears that it was then the custom at Athens to burn on Easter Sunday > the image of Judas Iscariot. As, however, Lord Rothschild, a British subject > of Jewish faith, was visiting Athens at this time, the Greek government > forbade the custom. This was attributed by the populace, not to the presence > of Lord Rothschild, but to the influence of Don Pacifico. Hence the outrages > to his person and property. Some of the Greek population in Athens, angered at the cancellation of their customs, rioted before the house of the Portuguese Consul-General. It was claimed by Pacifico that the crowd was infiltrated by the Greek police, and that among its inciters was one or more sons of the Greek Minister of War.Trollope, p. 119 \\"A Greek, of some position in his country, had been present in the streets encouraging the rioters when the house had been burnt down, and the police had refused to notice the matter.\\" Ashley, pp. 179–180: \\"M. Pacifico was a Jew native of Gibraltar, whose house was pillaged and gutted, in open day, by a mob headed by the sons of the Minister of War. While it was occurring no attempt was made by the authorities of Athens to protect him.\\" Three days after the incident, Don Pacifico himself wrote to Sir Edmund Lyons, British Minister Plenipotentiary to Greece:British and Foreign State Papers. 1849–1850. [2]. Vol. XXXIX, pp. 333–334. > It is with much grief that I feel myself obliged to communicate to your > Excellency a dreadful event which has happened to me, and as an English > subject to beg your protection.

He had been the Portuguese Consul-General in Athens until 1842,Giannis Kairofylas, The history of Psiri District (Η ιστορία της συνοικίας του Ψυρή), Filippotis Editions, Athens 2000, p. 102 and had possession of the Legation's archive. He had previously been Portuguese Consul-General in Morocco.according to Lord Palmerston, in Alden, Representative British Orations Volume 4, p. 156. He was appointed to Morocco in February, 1835: Bracebridge, p. 10 n. He was also concerned actively with the Jewish community in Athens, in possession of money intended for the construction of a synagogue in Athens. His house was not, as alleged by his defenders, a poor hovel, but the very house in which the chief of the Regency Council of King Otho, Count Josef Ludwig von Armansperg, had lived during the Regency (1832–1835) and as Arch-Secretary to the King (1835–1837).Alden, p. 157. On May 20, 1847, Lyons informed the Foreign Office in LondonBritish and Foreign State Papers. 1849–1850. [2]. Vol. XXXIX, p. 334. that he had applied to the Greek Government for compensation for Don David Pacifico, a British subject, for loss of possessions, including documents relating to a substantial claim against the Portuguese government for monies owed. The British Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston, a philhellene and supporter of the Greek War of Independence of 1821–1829, advised Lyons to have Pacifico compile an itemized valuation of his losses, and, if his statement was proven by satisfactory evidence, to present a note to the Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs requiring him to direct that the sum be paid to Don Pacifico. Pacifico complied on February 22, 1848, and Lyons duly dispatched a demand for payment to M. Drossos Mansolas, the Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs. He also wrote to M. Constantine Colocotronis, the Prime Minister. Colocotronis rejected Pacifico's claims, with the same objections used by his predecessor in office, M. Colettis.British and Foreign State Papers. 1849–1850. [2]. Vol. XXXIX , pp. 372–382. The objections of the Greek government were that the claimed damages were impossibly great, with some estimates of the claimed sum as being larger than the value of the Greek Royal Palace, while the Greek government also considered this to be an affair of the Judiciary, not the Executive branch.Eleftheroudakis Encyclopedia, \\"Perkerika\\" entry On August 31, 1848, David Pacifico again wrote to Lyons, mentioning that sixteen months had passed since the incident and satisfaction had not been forthcoming. Moreover, he had been forced to abandon his house during the Easter celebrations of 1848; and he drew to the attention of Lyons that several years earlier two Jews had been massacred at Patras, and likewise the synagogue at Negroponte had been burned down.British and Foreign State Papers. 1849–1850. [2]. Vol. XXXIX , pp. 382–388. After additional exchanges of letters among all the parties, on October 15, 1848, Don David Pacifico appealed again to the British Government to obtain the settlement of his claims. Already on December 3, 1849, Lord Palmerston had decided to take definitive action to settle the problems caused by Greek intransigence. King Otto and his government, in addition to refusing to settle claims of British citizens, had stopped payments for the loan of 1832. Palmerston wrote to Sir Thomas Wyse, the British Minister in Athens,Ashley, 183. > I have desired the Admiralty to instruct Sir William Parker to take Athens > on his way back from the Dardanelles, and to support you in bringing at last > to a satisfactory ending the settlement of our various claims upon the Greek > Government. You will, of course, in conjunction with him, persevere in the > suaviter in modo as long as is consistent with our dignity and honour, and I > measure that time by days – perhaps by some very small number of hours. If > however, the Greek Government does not strike, Parker must do so. In that > case you should embark on board his fleet before he begins to take any > hostile steps, in order that you and your mission may be secure against > insult. He should, of course, begin by reprisals; that is, by taking > possession of some Greek property; but the King would probably not much care > for our taking hold of any merchant property, and the best thing, therefore, > would be to seize hold of his little fleet, if that can be done handily. The > next thing would be a blockade of any or all of his ports.... On January 22, 1850, Admiral Sir William Parker reportedAshley, 187–188. that all the vessels of the Greek government had been detained, but that the machinations of the French Minister Thouvenot and the Prussian Chargé d'affaires were encouraging King Otto to resist. The Greek Government and the Greek people had been humiliated by the affair, and the British also attempted to push their desired outcomes on other disputes with the Greek government, especially pertaining to the United States of the Ionian Islands, such as: * The British claims on the islands of Sapientza and Elafonisos for the United States of the Ionian Islands (then a British protectorate). * Compensation for six British ships that were robbed. * Placation for an insult to the British flag and disrespect towards the British Ambassador, Mr. Boyde. * Compensation for two Ionian Islanders who had been abused in Pyrgos. * Compensation for Mr. Finley's barn, which had been included in the Royal Gardens of Athens without compensation. Greece was a state protected jointly by the UK, France, and Russia, and the imposition of the blockade caused a diplomatic conflict between Britain, on the one hand, and France and Russia on the other. France and Russia objected to the blockade and the French Ambassador in London, Édouard Drouyn de Lhuys, was temporarily withdrawn by the French government, causing the British to abandon the push on disputes not directly associated with the Don Pacifico affair. The affair also caused considerable damage to the reputation of King Otto in Athens. The blockade lasted two months and the affair ended only when the Greek government agreed to compensate Pacifico. == Political fallout in London == At Westminster, both houses of Parliament examined the issue of foreign policy, especially with regard to Greece, with considerable energy. On June 17, 1850, Lord Edward Stanley (the future Earl of Derby), the Leader of the Conservative Opposition in the House of Lords, proposed a motion in the House: \\"That, while the House fully recognizes the right and duty of the Government to secure to Her Majesty's subjects residing in foreign states the full protection of the laws of those states, it regrets to find, by the correspondence recently laid upon the table by Her Majesty's command, that various claims against the Greek government, doubtful in point of justice or exaggerated in amount, have been enforced by coercive measures directed against the commerce and people of Greece, and calculated to endanger the continuance of our friendly relations with other powers.\\"Ashley, p. 210. After a memorable debate on June 17, 1850, the House of Lords voted in favour of the Opposition motion, by a majority of 37, which was a rebuke to Lord Palmerston's policies. However, the House of Commons did not proceed as the Lords. The MP for Sheffield, John Arthur Roebuck, an independent and sometimes contrarian member, proposed to reverse this condemnation, by stating \\"That the principles on which the foreign policy of Her Majesty's Government have been regulated have been such as were calculated to maintain the honour and dignity of this country; and in times of unexampled difficulty, to preserve peace between England and the various nations of the world.\\" A debate ensued, which lasted four nights. Palmerston delivered a famous five-hour speech in which he sought to vindicate not only his claims on the Greek government for Don Pacifico, but his entire administration of foreign affairs. \\"As the Roman, in days of old, held himself free from indignity, when he could say, Civis Romanus sum,\\"I am a Roman citizen.\\" so also a British subject, in whatever land he may be, shall feel confident that the watchful eye and the strong arm of England will protect him from injustice and wrong.\\" He was answered by Sir Robert Peel,The Speeches of the late Right Honourable Sir Robert Peel, Bart. Volume IV, 846–855. in what turned out to be his last speech to the Commons, and by W. E. Gladstone.G.W.E. Russell, The Right Honourable William Ewart Gladstone pp. 102–110. The Government won the motion by 310 to 264, a majority of forty-six, in favor of Palmerston's conduct of foreign affairs. == Pacifico's settlement == The claims of the British Government were settled by a Convention, agreed between Her Britannic Majesty and His Hellenic Majesty on July 18, 1850.Scott, Cases on International Law, principally selected from Decisions of English and American Courts, p. 511. The King agreed to make good to Mr. Pacifico any real injury which could be proved, after a full and fair investigation. Don Pacifico's outstanding claims were submitted to a special Commission, composed of the French, British and Greek ministers in Lisbon. The Commissioners met in Lisbon in February 1851. The Commission discovered in the archives of the Cortes at Lisbon a petition addressed by Don Pacifico to the Cortes in 1839, accompanied by voluminous documents to prove his claims. The claims had yet to be addressed by the Cortes. The Commission awarded Don Pacifico the sum of £150, owed by the Greek Government.Scott, Cases on International Law, principally selected from Decisions of English and American Courts pp. 511–513. Pacifico received a total of 120,000 drachmas and £500 in the settlement. == See also == *History of nationality in Gibraltar == Footnotes == # Hansard CXII (3d Ser.), 380–444, Retrieved 28 March 2006. # Civitas Review, Volume 2, Issue 1; March, 2005 (pdf), Retrieved 28 March 2006. == References == == Bibliography == * Hannell, David. \\"Lord Palmerston and the 'Don Pacifico Affair' of 1850: The Ionian Connection.\\" European History Quarterly (1989) 19#4 pp: 495–508. online * Hicks, Geoffrey. \\"Don Pacifico, Democracy, and Danger: The Protectionist Party Critique of British Foreign Policy, 1850–1852.\\" International History Review (2004) 26 #3 pp: 515–540. *Taylor, Derek.

The name comes from the Greek word μέλισσα (mélissa), \\"bee\\",μέλισσα, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus. which in turn comes from μέλι (meli), \\"honey\\".μέλι, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on PerseusLexicon of Greek Personal Names, Oxford In Hittite, melit signifies \\"honey\\".Ivanov, V. 1963 The Hittite Language (Moscow): melt is among the brief examples given in Common Anatolian Glossary Melissa also refers to the plant Melissa officinalis (family Lamiaceae), known as lemon balm. Melissa is a common variant form, with others being Malissa, Melesa, Melessa, Meliza, Mellisa, Melosa, and Molissa.http://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/0/Melisa In Ireland it is sometimes used as a feminine form of the Gaelic male name Maoilíosa, which means \\"servant of Jesus\\", which is of an origin independent of the Hittites. According to Greek mythology, perhaps reflecting Minoan culture, making her the daughter of a Cretan king Melisseus, whose -issos ending is Pre-Greek,David Sacks, Oswyn Murray, 1995. A Dictionary of the Ancient Greek World s.v. \\"Names\\": \\"Narcissus...the pre-Greek ending of his name\\". Melissa was a nymph who discovered and taught the use of honey and from whom bees were believed to have received their name.Greek Myth Index She was one of the nymph nurses of Zeus, sister to Amaltheia, but rather than feeding the baby milk, Melissa, appropriately for her name, fed him honey. Or, alternatively, the bees brought honey straight to his mouth. Because of her, Melissa became the name of all the nymphs who cared for the patriarch god as a baby.Women in Greek Myths == Mythology == === Ancient Greek mythology === The name \\"Melissa\\" has a long history with roots reaching back to even before Ancient Greece. For this reason, in part, there are several versions of the story surrounding the mythological character Melissa, especially in how she came to care for the infant Zeus. In one version, Melissa, a mountain-nymph, hid Zeus from his father, Cronus, who was intent on devouring his progeny. She fed Zeus goat's milk from Amalthea and fed him honey, giving him a permanent taste for it even once he came to rule on Mount Olympus. Cronus became aware of Melissa's role in thwarting his murderous design and changed her into an earthworm. Zeus, however, took pity and transformed her into a beautiful bee. Nymphs, such as Melissa, played an important role in mythic accounts of the origin of basic institutions and skills, as in the training of the culture heroes Dionysos and Aristaeus or the civilizing behaviors taught by the bee nymph. The antiquarian Mnaseas' account of Melissa gives a good picture of her function as in this respect. According to folklore, as Larson phrases it, \\"Melissa first found a honeycomb, tasted it, then mixed it with water as a beverage. She taught others to do this, and thus the creature was named for her, and she was made its guardian.\\" This was part of the Nymphs' achievement of bringing men out of their wild state. Under the guidance of Melissa, the Nymphs not only turned men away from eating each other to eating only this product of the forest trees, but also introduced into the world of men the feeling of modesty. In addition, the ancient Greek philosopher, Porphyry (233 to c. 304 AD) wrote of the priestesses of Demeter, known as Melissae (\\"bees\\"), who were initiates of the chthonian goddess. The story surrounding Melissae tells of an elderly priestess of Demeter, named Melissa, initiated into her mysteries by the goddess herself. When Melissa's neighbors tried to make her reveal the secrets of her initiation, she remained silent, never letting a word pass from her lips. In anger, the women tore her to pieces, but Demeter sent a plague upon them, causing bees to be born from Melissa's dead body. From Porphyry's writings, scholars have also learned that Melissa was the name of the moon goddess Artemis and the goddess who took suffering away from mothers giving birth. Souls were symbolized by bees and it was Melissa who drew souls down to be born. She was connected with the idea of a periodic regeneration. ==== Melitta ==== Within a fragment of the Orphic poetry, quoted by Natalis Comes, Melitta is spoken of as a hive, and called Seira, or the hive of Venus: > Let us celebrate the hive of Venus, who rose from the sea: that hive of many > names: the mighty fountain, from whence all kings are descended; from whence > all the winged and immortal Loves were again produced. From the works of Hesychius, it is clear that the word Seira among other interpretations signified Melitta, a bee; also a hive, or house of Melitta, \\"[s]uch is the sense of it in this passage: and [she] was thus represented in ancient mythology, as being the receptacle, from whence issued that swarm, by which the world was peopled\\". With that said, Seira was none other than the goddess Demeter, the supposed mother of mankind; who was also styled as Melitta and Melissa, and was looked upon as the Venus of the East. This Deity, Melitta, was the same as Mylitta, the well-known Venus of the Babylonians and Arabians. Melissa or Melitta is also said to be the mother-wife of Phoroneus, the first that reigned, in whose days the dispersion of mankind occurred, whereas before all had been in harmony and only one language was spoken. Melitta, being the feminine of Melitz, the Mediator, consequently signifies Melitta the Mediatrix for sinful mortals. ==Poetry== The 16th-century Italian poet Ludovico Ariosto used the name \\"Melissa\\" for a good fairy (the good sorceress and prophetess who lived in Merlin's cave) in his poem Orlando Furioso. The following is an ode to Melissa's birthday by Thomas Blacklock, a Scottish poet from the late 18th century. ===Ode, on Melissa's Birth Day=== Ye nymphs and swains, whom love inspires With all his pure and faithful fires, Hither with joyful steps repair; You who his tenderest transports share For lo ! in beauty's fairest pride, Summer expands her heart so wide; The Sun no more in clouds inshrin'd, Darts all his glories unconfin'd; The feather'd choir from every spray Salute Melissa's natal day. Hither ye nymphs and shepherds haste, Each with a flow'ry chaplet grac'd, With transport while the shades resound, And Nature spreads her charms around; While ev'ry breeze exhales perfumes, And Bion his mute pipe resumes; With Bion long disus'd to play, Salute Melissa's natal day. For Bion long deplor'd his pain Thro' woods and devious wilds in vain; At last impell'd by deep despair, The swain proferr'd his ardent pray'r; His ardent pray'r Melissa heard, And every latent sorrow cheer'd, His days with social rapture blest, And sooth'd each anxious care to rest. Tune, shepherds, tune the festive lay, And hail Melissa's natal day. With Nature's incense to the skies Let all your fervid wishes rise, That Heav'n and Earth may join to shed Their choicest blessings on her head; That years protracted, as they flow, May pleasures more sublime bestow; While by succeeding years surpast, The happiest still may be the last; And thus each circling Sun display, A more auspicious natal day. == Popularity == Melissa became a popular name in the United States during the 1950s. Very popular from the 1960s through the 1990s, today Melissa is a relatively rare baby name; in 2010, fewer than 2,500 girls were given the name, compared with around 10,000 in 1993 and well over 30,000 at the name's peak popularity in 1979.http://www.babynameshub.com/baby-names-girls/Melissa.html In 2007, Melissa was the 137th most popular name for girls born in the United States, dropping steadily from its peak of second place in 1977. It was among the top ten most popular names for girls from 1967 to 1984. ==In popular culture== * \\"Melissa\\", a song by The Allman Brothers Band from the album Eat a Peach.Eat a Peach#Track listing Written by vocalist Gregg Allman, the song is said to be about a Cleveland-based accountant he had met while performing there in 1967. * \\"Melissa\\", the thirteenth single by Japanese rock band Porno Graffitti, was used as the first opening theme of the anime Fullmetal Alchemist. * Melissa, the first studio album by Mercyful Fate, issued in 1983. * Melisso is a male character in the opera Alcina by George Frideric Handel. * Melissa & Joey is an American sitcom television series. ==People== ===In film, television, and radio=== * Melissa Benoist, American actress, singer, dancer, and activist * Melissa Fumero, American actress * Melissa George, Australian actress and entrepreneur * Melissa Gilbert, American actress and television director * Melissa Joan Hart, American actress * Melissa McCarthy, American actress, comedian, writer, producer, and fashion designer * Melissa Rauch, an American actress * Melissa Villasenor, American actress, comedian, and singer ===In the arts=== * Melissa Auf der Maur, Canadian musician, singer-songwriter, photographer, and actress * Melissa Etheridge, American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and activist * Melissa Hamilton, Northern Irish ballet dancer * Melissa Hough, American ballet dancer * Melissa Manchester, American singer- songwriter and actress * Melissa VanFleet, American singer-songwriter and musician ===In the sciences=== * Melissa Marquez, American shark scientist *Melissa Simon, American clinical obstetrician/gynecologist *Melissa Trainer, American astrobiologist === In sport === *Melissa Maizels (born 1993), Australian footballer * Melissa Mantak, triathlete and triathlon coach from the United States ==References== ==External links== * Baby names Category:Feminine given names Category:Given names of Greek language origin Category:English feminine given names Category:Greek feminine given names Category:Italian feminine given names Category:Metamorphoses in Greek mythology Category:Nymphs Category:Arabic feminine given names Category:Bees in popular culture ","title":"Melissa"},{"id":"2561896","text":"The depressor anguli oris (triangularis) is a facial muscle associated with frowning.

This area, high in the Allegheny Mountains at about , is protected as the Cranberry Glades Botanical Area, part of the Monongahela National Forest. This site is the headwaters of the Cranberry River, a popular trout stream, and is adjacent to the nearly Cranberry Wilderness. The Glades are a grouping of peat bogs resembling some Canadian bogs. The gladed land is highly acidic and supports plants commonly found at higher latitudes, including cranberries, sphagnum moss, skunk cabbage, and two carnivorous plants (purple pitcher plant, sundew). The Glades serve as the southernmost home of many of the plant species found there. The Glades have been the subject of much scientific study, especially during the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. Professor Maurice Brooks conducted studies in 1930, 1934, and 1945. The work of Strausbaugh (1934), Darlington (1943), and Core (1955) followed. In 1974, the Cranberry Glades Botanical Area was designated a National Natural Landmark. ==Geography and geology== The natural history of the Glades has been traced back at least 12,200 years. Apparently, a forest of conifer-northern hardwoods replaced tundra with the end of the last Ice Age. Over time the Glades formed into what it is today. Now, most of the bog is underlain by peat that is up to thick. Under the peat is a layer of algal ooze and the ooze by marl. Since a limestone source in the surrounding rocks is indicated, an ample source appears to be present in the underlying Hinton Formation, a circumstance that also has significant implications for the Glades' flora. The area is not entirely a glade, but a bog or wetland covered with all sorts of decaying vegetation. The peat and decaying organic matter is more than ten feet thick under the dense plant cover. The ground is not as much as quicksand or swampy, but spongy. It is in a high valley, about 3,300 to 3,400 feet (1,005 to 1,036 meters) above sea level, surrounded by the Cranberry, Kennison, and Black Mountains. Five separate glades were identified and named in 1911Brooks, A.B. (1911), \\"Forestry and Wood Industries\\", West Virginia Geological Survey, 5:247-249. — Big Glade (59 acres), Flag Glade (28 acres), Long Glade (20 acres), Round Glade (8 acres) and Little Glade (1 acre). The smallest, Little Glade, has since grown over and is no longer recognizable.Edens, David L. (1977), \\"Cranberry Glades, A Unique Series of Boreal Bogs in the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia\\"; In: Adkins, Howard G., Steve Ewing and Chester E. Zimolzak (Editors), West Virginia and Appalachia: Selected Readings, The West Virginia Council for Geographic Education, Dubuque, Iowa: Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company, pp. 19-37. Darlington's studies showed that the Glades were formed by easily eroding rocks in the basin and more resistant rock at its lower end. This effectively prevented down-cutting and maintained a low gradient in the valley. This resulted in an elevation of at the upper end and at the back, eliminating the possibility of origin by water impoundment. The water from the Glades drains to form the headwaters of the Cranberry River, a popular trout stream joined by the Yew and Charles Creeks. It starts at about above the sea, and then it meanders through the glades and recedes through a narrow gap between Kennison and Black Mountains. It then joins the Gauley River down the mountains at about above sea level. ==Ecology== ===Flora=== Many of the plants found in the Glades resemble those in the northern region of North America. They are descendants of seeds that took root over ten thousand years ago before the last glacial retreat. Among these are two unusual species of carnivorous plants that thrive in the area — the purple pitcher plant and native sundew. They evolved carnivorous habits because of the scarce root food in the spongy soil. Two very rare boreal plants — bog rosemary and buckbean — also live in the Big Glade. Much of the area provides a home for many species of mosses. These include a cover of sphagnum moss, bird-wheat moss, bog moss and reindeer lichen. Hummocks of these plants reach a height of . Over top of these grow prostrate cranberry vines that bloom nice pink flowers in the summer and a bunch of fruits in late September. ====Trees==== Within the Glades floodplain, most tree species occur in the \\"bog forest\\" habitat, which is composed primarily of a mixture of red spruce, eastern (or Canada) hemlock, yellow birch and red maple. The upland forests immediately surrounding the wetlands are dominated by these same species, but also include American beech, sugar maple, black cherry, American basswood, white ash, yellow buckeye, black birch, cucumber tree, Fraser magnolia, and northern red oak. ====Shrubs==== The Glades' shrub layer, unlike the tree layer, is relatively species-rich. This is a consequence of the widespread presence of low- to medium-height woody plants throughout shrub swamps, forest habitats, and open glades. In the fringes of open glades and along streams, the dominant species is usually speckled alder. Also common are willow, pipestem, glade St. Johns-wort, great rhododendron, hobblebush, smooth arrowwood, wild raisin, ninebark, alternate- leaved dogwood, bunchberry, winterberry holly, mountain holly, swamp rose, the Appalachian endemic longstalked holly and many more. Most of these shrubs have markedly northern distributions, and bog rosemary and oblongfruited serviceberry are at their southernmost limits of distribution. The Canada yew is an uncommon evergreen shrub that was historically reported as abundant in the area. Nearby Yew Creek is presumably named for this species, as may be the broader Yew Mountains region in which the Glades are located. Browsing deer have reduced the number of Canada yew to such an extent that it is found only in scattered locations throughout its Central Appalachian range, including here. ====Herbs==== Many herbs with primarily northern distributions occur here, including oak fern, pod grass (collected in 1909), Canada mayflower, mountain bindweed, marsh marigold, goldthread, swamp saxifrage, white wood sorrel, northern white violet, Jacob's ladder and buckbean. Jacob's ladder is at its southernmost location. Grasses and sedges found here include blue joint, drooping wood reed grass, millet grass, rattlesnake mannagrass, interior sedge, and Fraser's sedge. Wild lilies in the Glades include yellow clintonia and white hellebore. Several species of orchids also grow here, such as the rose pogonia, lesser rattlesnake plantain, northern coralroot, and grass-pink orchid that are in full bloom in July. Northern (or early) coralroot is probably at its southernmost location in the eastern United States. ===Fauna=== Many animals that live in the Glades are at their southernmost breeding grounds, including birds such as the Swainson’s and hermit thrushes, Nashville and mourning warblers, and purple finches. Other, less exotic, birds like ravens and hawks are common. Other familiar animals including whitetail deer inhabit the Glades. Black bears have been seen in the skunk cabbage growing along the boardwalk. In the evening, you have a good chance of hearing beavers working; they are mostly inactive during the day. It is hard to see the beavers because of little light, and they are dark colored. They also reside submerged or are building their homes. ==Weather== Like many of the adjoining areas high in the Alleghenies, Cranberry Glades is known for frequent weather changes. Generally speaking, the area is cool and wet, comparable to the climates of New England and Canada. This can be explained by the biome which this area is set in, the Temperate Deciduous Forest. Biomes are defined by common flora and fauna types and by certain types of consistent weather patterns. Higher mountains surround the Glades form a bowl, draining their cool air downhill to the Glades. Due to the high elevation, the potential for frost exists year-round at Cranberry Glades. In some years, the frost-free period has been as short as 81 days. Still, the average summer high is in roughly 74 °F-82 °F (23 °C-28 °C). Mid-winter temperatures record as low as , and the area often sees heavy snow. ==Recreation== Today, Cranberry Glades serves as a major tourism stop along the Highland Scenic Highway corridor. Near the Glades is the Cranberry Mountain Nature Center providing interpretive services. Within the Glades area itself, Monongahela National Forest has constructed a boardwalk that traverses the edge of some bogs and a small wooded section. The entire Glades area itself is traversed by Cowpasture Trail, a improved hiking path that serves as the border between the Cranberry Glades Botanical Area and the much larger Cranberry Wilderness. Due to the ecologically-sensitive nature of the area, visitors are not permitted to leave these developed paths within the Glades. == See also == * List of botanical gardens and arboretums in West Virginia *Cranberry Wilderness *Cranberry River *Mill Point Federal Prison *List of National Natural Landmarks *List of National Natural Landmarks in West Virginia ==References== ==External links== *Monongahela National Forest: Cranberry Glades Botanical Area *Monongahela National Forest: Cranberry Mountain Nature Center *West Virginia Division of Natural Resources: Cranberry Glades page *National Park Service: NNL Webpage on the Glades *Eastern Panhandle Native Plant Society: Cranberry Glades Plant List (2001) Category:Appalachian bogs Category:Bogs of West Virginia Category:Botanical gardens in West Virginia Category:Monongahela National Forest Category:Protected areas of Pocahontas County, West Virginia Category:National Natural Landmarks in West Virginia Category:Landforms of Pocahontas County, West Virginia Category:Cranberries ","title":"Cranberry Glades"},{"id":"2561931","text":"Llynclys (, )) is a small village in Shropshire, England, in the civil parish of Llanyblodwel.

It is considered one of the finest examples of late Perpendicular Gothic English architecture.Saltmarsh, John: King's College (in Victoria County History of Cambridgeshire, Volume III, ed. J.P.C. Roach, 1959) The Chapel was built in phases by a succession of kings of England from 1446 to 1515, a period which spanned the Wars of the Roses and three subsequent decades. The Chapel's large stained glass windows were not completed until 1531, and its early Renaissance rood screen was erected in 1532–36. The Chapel is an active house of worship, and home of the King's College Choir. The Chapel is a significant landmark and a commonly used symbol of the city of Cambridge.Cambridge City Council ==Construction== The world's largest fan vault (1512–1515) Henry VI planned a university counterpart to Eton College (whose Chapel is very similar, but not on the scale intended by Henry). The King decided the dimensions of the Chapel. Reginald Ely was most likely the architect and worked on the site since 1446. Two years earlier Reginald was charged with sourcing craftsmen for the Chapel's construction. He continued to work on the site until building was interrupted in 1461, having probably designed the elevations. The original plans called for lierne vaulting, and the piers of the choir were built to conform with them. Ultimately, a complex fan vault was constructed instead. Reginald probably designed the window tracery at the extreme east of the church's north side: the east window of the easternmost side chapel, which unlike the Perpendicular style of the others is in curvilinear Gothic style. The priest and later bishop Nicholas Close (or Cloos) was recorded as the \\"surveyor\\", having been the curate of St John Zachary, a church demolished to make way for the Chapel.Thomas John P. Carter, King's college chapel: notes on its history and present condition (Macmillan and Co, 1867), 10 The first stone of the Chapel was laid, by Henry himself, on the Feast of St James the Apostle, 25 July 1446, the College having been begun in 1441. By the end of the reign of Richard III (1485), despite the Wars of the Roses, five bays had been completed and a timber roof erected. Henry VII visited in 1506, paying for the work to resume and even leaving money so that the work could continue after his death. In 1515, under Henry VIII, the building was complete but the great windows had yet to be made. The Chapel features the world's largest fan vault, constructed between 1512 and 1515 by master mason John Wastell. It also features fine medieval stained glass and, above the altar, The Adoration of the Magi by Rubens, painted in 1634 for the Convent of the White Nuns at Louvain in Belgium. The painting was installed in the Chapel in 1968; this involved the lowering of the Sanctuary floor leading up to the High Altar. It had been believed that gradations were created in 1774 by James Essex, when Essex had in fact lowered the floor by 5 1/2 inches,A Century of King's, 1873–1972 by L.P. Wilkinson, 1980: 130–131 but at the demolition of these steps, it was found that the floor instead rested on Tudor brick arches. During the removal of these Tudor steps, built at the Founder's specific request that the high altar should be 3 ft above the choir floor, human remains in intact lead coffins with brass plaques were discovered, dating from the 15th to 18th centuries, and were disinterred. The eventual installation of the Rubens was also not without problems: once seen beneath the east window, a conflict was felt between the picture's swirling colours and those of the stained glass. The Rubens was also a similar shape to the window, which \\"dwarfed it and made it look rather like a dependent postage stamp\\". Plain shutters were proposed, one on each side, to give it a triptych shape (although the picture was never part of a triptych) and lend it independence of form, which is how one sees the Rubens today. The installation was designed by architect Sir Martyn Beckett, who was \\"philosophical about the furore this inevitably occasioned - which quickly became acceptance of a solution to a difficult problem.\\" During the Civil War the Chapel was used as a training ground by Oliver Cromwell's troops, but escaped major damage, possibly because Cromwell, having been a Cambridge student, gave orders for it to be spared. Graffiti left by these soldiers is still visible on the north and south walls near the altar. During World War II most of the stained glass was removed and the Chapel again escaped damage.King's College Chapel, Cambridge at britainexpress.com Cambridge King's College Chapel Cambridge King's College Chapel Cambridge King's College Chapel ==Great windows== The Great East Window The windows of King's College Chapel are some of the finest in the world from their era. There are 12 large windows on each side of the Chapel, and larger windows at the east and west ends. With the exception of the west window, they are by Flemish hands and date from 1515 to 1531. Barnard Flower, the first non-Englishman appointed as the King's Glazier, completed four windows. Gaylon Hone and three partners (two English and one Flemish) are responsible for the east window and 16 others between 1526 and 1531. The final four were made by Francis Williamson and Symon Symondes. The one modern window is that in the west wall, which was donated by King's alumnus Francis Stacey and is by the Clayton and Bell company and dates from 1879. Cambridge King's College Chapel ==Rood screen== This large wooden screen, which separates the nave from the altar and supports the organ, was erected in 1532–36 by Henry VIII in celebration of his marriage to Anne Boleyn. The screen is an example of early Renaissance architecture: a striking contrast to the Perpendicular Gothic Chapel; Sir Nikolaus Pevsner said it is \\"the most exquisite piece of Italian decoration surviving in England\\".Pevsner, An Outline of European architecture 1963:292f. ==Current use== The Chapel is actively used as a place of worship and also for some concerts and college events. Notable college events include the annual King's College Music Society May Week Concert, held on the Monday of May Week. The event is popular with students, alumni, and visitors to the city. The Chapel is noted for its splendid acoustics. The world-famous Choir of King's College, Cambridge consists of choral scholars, organ scholars (male students at the college), and choristers (boys educated at the nearby King's College School). From 1982 until shortly before his death on 22 November 2019 the director of music for the choir was Sir Stephen Cleobury. The choir sings services on most days in term-time, and also performs concerts and makes recordings and broadcasts. The BBC has broadcast the Choir's Nine Lessons and Carols from the chapel on Christmas Eve, during which a solo treble sings the first verse of Once in Royal David's City. There is also a chapel choir of male and female students, King's Voices, which sings Evensong on Mondays during term-time. The chapel is widely seen as a symbol of Cambridge (for example in the logo of Cambridge City Council). File:20130808 Kings College Chapel 01.jpgSide view of the Chapel from inside the college.

King's College Chapel, like other Cambridge colleges, is not formally part of the structure of the Church of England, but the Dean is customarily licensed by the Bishop of Ely. Both he and the Chaplain take a regular part in chapel services: each is normally present at services six days a week during Full Term, and each preaches once or twice a term. The Chapel is run by a Chapel Committee chaired by the Dean.

Most recently, John has been involved with Kurt Vile, Sonic Youth, Alvvays, Sweet Apple, Dinosaur Jr., Thurston Moore and Jemina Pearl. ==Career== ===Early work=== Agnello's life in the studio began in 1979 at the age of 19 while working as an intern at the legendary Record Plant Studios in Manhattan. He worked his way up the ladder and became the studio’s go-to-assistant. He assisted on a number of albums including those by Aerosmith, Twisted Sister, Scandal, John Cougar Mellencamp, and John Waite. John also worked briefly on “Born In the USA” with Bruce Springsteen. However, working on Cyndi Lauper’s She’s So Unusual! had the biggest recording and production impact on him at the time. He worked with some of the great engineers and producers of that time, including, Jack Douglas, Jimmy Iovine, Rick Chertoff, William Wittman, Mike Chapman, Dave Thoener, Jay Messina, Roy Cicala, and Shelly Yakus. He got his first true break engineering on the second album by The Hooters. He was involved with artists such as Patty Smyth, Sophie B. Hawkins and The Outfield. The Outfield's first record, Play Deep, had a #2 hit with \\"Your Love\\". Around that time, he also got to do one off session with Bob Dylan and Mick Jagger, two of his favorite artists. The Bob Dylan song was “Series Of Dreams” which he co-mixed with Bill Wittman. That version was used by NARAS when presenting Bob Dylan with his lifetime achievement award. And the Mick Jagger song, \\"Hard Woman\\", was for a special made-for-MTV only video. ===1990s=== During the early nineties, Agnello began an association with Dinosaur Jr. and the Screaming Trees. This collaboration has extended through almost a dozen records. In fact, John recently mixed the heralded Dinosaur Jr. reunion record, Beyond, with the original lineup. He was also responsible for productions with artists such as Buffalo Tom, Chainsaw Kittens, Jawbox, Chavez, Redd Kross, Madrugada and Patti Smith, among others. He also worked with Alice Cooper on The Last Temptation Of Alice Cooper. ===2000–present=== right Agnello has worked with such artists as Sonic Youth, The Living End, Andrew W.K., Drive-By Truckers and Social Distortion. He has helmed both Boys And Girls In America and Stay Positive by The Hold Steady. Even though he excels at the hard edge sound of many of the aforementioned artists, he's also adept at working with the subtler sounds of artists such as Son Volt, The Kills, Thurston Moore, The Walkmen, and Five for Fighting. Agnello has also been involved with many newer artists including Scottish band The Hazey Janes. Agnello mixed one of their records in Spain in 2006. Agnello also worked with Jennifer O'Connor on her latest album, Here With Me, for Matador Records. Agnello has had commercial success overseas. The three records he did with Norwegian band Madrugada have scored both critical and commercial success. In the press release for the current record, Madrugada, they describe Agnello as \\"the external creative force that has had the most influence on Madrugada’s artistic development.” Agnello has also had success with another Norwegian band, Turbonegro, on their last record, Retox.Discogs, Turbonegro Retox, http://www.discogs.com/Turbonegro-Retox/release/1818437 In October 2012, Agnello produced the sixth album from indie punk band The Thermals. In 2015, Agnello produced the album Manhattan for the anti-folk singer Jeffrey Lewis. ==Discography== *Nothing - \\"Dance On The Blacktop\\", 2018 *Kevin Devine - \\"Instigator\\", 2016 *Kurt Vile - Wakin on a Pretty Daze, 2013 *The Black Clouds - Better Days, 2013 * Okkervil River - \\"The Silver Gymnasium\\", 2013 *Kurt Vile - Smoke Ring for My Halo, 2011 *Sonic Youth - The Eternal, 2009 *Dinosaur Jr., \\"Farm\\", 2009 *The Hold Steady, Stay Positive, 2008 *The Living End, White Noise, 2008 *Jennifer O’Connor, Here With Me, 2008 *Madrugada, Madrugada, 2008 *The Hazey Janes, Hands Around the City, 2008 *Thurston Moore, Trees Outside The Academy, 2007 *Turbonegro, Retox, 2007 *Dinosaur Jr., Beyond, 2007 *My Midnight Creeps, Histamin, 2007 *The Ponys, Turn the Lights Out, 2007 *Son Volt, The Search, 2007 *Oxford Collapse, Remember The Night Parties, 2006 *The Hold Steady, Boys and Girls in America, 2006 *Andrew WK, Close Calls with Brick Walls, 2006 *Sonic Youth, Rather Ripped, 2006 ==References== ==External links== * *Steel Toe Artist Management *Interview with John Agnello in Sound Bites Dog E-Zine *John Agnello interview with freqControl.com Category:American record producers Category:American audio engineers Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"John Agnello"},{"id":"2561948","text":"Saint Michael's Church, Loppington, painted by the Rev.

Other interesting buildings are The Nook, a timber-framed house near to the church, and Loppington Hall, an early 18th-century brick house, a former residence of John Lloyd Dickin restored in 2002.

The population according to the 2011 census was 3,270. ==History== Preeshenlle United Reform ChurchThe village was previously called Bryn-y-Castell (\\"Hill of the Castle\\" in English) after the Norman motte castle adjacent to the Preeshenlle United Reformed Church, the eastern edge of the site was cut into when the church was built. Alongside this monument there is a section of the 8th century Wat's Dyke. The name changed to Gobowen, this name is believed to originate from Gob (a pillow) and Owen (Owain Glyndŵr) who was believed to have rested his weary head here. However, this name may also originate from a man named Owen who started mining there, and the old Welsh word for mine is 'gob' hence Gobowen (Owen's mine). The mines were filled in by hand during the Second World War by displaced persons and prisoners of war, who were housed in a camp which is now called Bank Top Industrial Estate in the nearby village of St Martins. The population of Gobowen, however, grew up around the railway. The mainline route between Chester and Shrewsbury was diverted through Gobowen after permission was denied to route the railway through the local historic town of Oswestry. Gobowen railway station is a Grade II listed building. The village's main primary school was opened in 1907 with local educational provision previously being offered at the school hall attached to Preeshenlle United Reform Church. All Saints Church, Gobowen Hospital at Park Hall === All Saints Church === The Foundation Stone for All Saints Church was laid in 1926 and the memorial to this event can be found on the east end of the building. The church was built as a daughter church to St. Barnabas Church at Hengoed and remained as such until the Hengoed church was made redundant in 1981, at which point All Saints became the parish church for 'Hengoed with Gobowen'. The parish of Hengoed with Gobowen was originally in the diocese of St Asaph but transferred to the diocese of Lichfield when the Church in Wales disestablished. All Saints was officially opened in 1928 and its vicar was George Owen Browne, the first of nine vicars to date who have served the parish. Others have included: Bertram Russell, Arthur Cecil Roberts, Glyn Owen Jones, John Michael Allen, Paul Wilkinson, Michael John Withey, Christopher John Groocock and Adrian Richard Bailey (the current vicar). The church was extended variously throughout its history including the extension of the West End, the addition of a second vestry (to the rear) and a bell tower. In 1979, the building was devastated by fire and services continued during that period in the hall next to the Church. It re-opened in 1981 with a newly commissioned stained glass window to the East End, a donated window depicting the nativity in the West End, and various pieces of furniture donated from churches elsewhere. ==Governance== Gobowen is part of the electoral ward called Gobowen, Selattyn and Weston Rhyn. This ward had a population of 6,866 at the 2011 Census. ==Amenities and attractions== Derwen College, which provides residential further education for students with learning difficulties and disabilities, lies in the village. The college also operates a garden centre, Young Farmers' shop (selling produce grown at the college), coffee shop and restaurant. The village has shops, medical facilities and schools. There are three churches — Anglican, Methodist and United Reformed. There are around 20 organisations offering activities in which to participate. Local tourist attractions include Park Hall Countryside Experience, Chirk Castle, Whittington Castle and the Shropshire Union Canal. Milestone on the route of the old A5 ===Orthopaedic hospital=== The Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital is sited nearby. It was established as a convalescent home for disabled children in 1900 at Baschurch by Agnes Hunt. In 1919 funds and premises became available and the hospital transferred to the hospital section of a former army camp at Park Hall. Much progress has been made since that time both with vast new buildings and pioneering medical treatments. ==Transport== Gobowen lies on the A5/A483 roads between London and Holyhead. The village has regular bus links with Oswestry, St Martins, Ellesmere and Wrexham. Gobowen railway station is served by Transport for Wales with regular trains connecting to Wrexham, Chester, Shrewsbury, Holyhead and the North Wales Coast, Cardiff and Birmingham. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Selattyn and Gobowen ==References== ==External links== Gobowen is part of the Community Online forum http://www.community-online.co.uk Category:Villages in Shropshire ","title":"Gobowen"},{"id":"2561980","text":"Holla may refer to: == Places== * Holla, Telemark, a former municipality in Telemark county, Norway * Holla, Trøndelag, a village in Hemne municipality in Trøndelag county, Norway == Music == * \\"Holla\\", a song by EXID * \\"Holla\\", a 2001 song from Genesis (Busta Rhymes album) * \\"Holla\\", a melody by Ghostface Killah from his album The Pretty Toney Album * \\"Holla\\", a song by Proyecto Uno 2003 * Holla!, a 2004 album by Baha Men, or the title track == Other == * Holla, a surname of the Kota Brahmins of Karnataka state of India * Holla, a typeface created by Rudolf Koch ==See also== * Hola (disambiguation) * Holler (disambiguation) ","title":"Holla"},{"id":"2561982","text":"The Regina Capitals were a professional ice hockey team originally based in the city of Regina, Saskatchewan in the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL), founded in 1921. ==Western Canada Hockey League Capitals (1921–1926)== 1921 was the Regina Capitals' first season in the new Western Canada Hockey League, they finished second overall and then upset the Edmonton Eskimos in the playoffs to win the league championship. Winning the league championship meant that the team had to face the winner of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) before being able to challenge for the Stanley Cup. Unfortunately, the up-start Capitals lost to the Vancouver Millionaires of the PCHA. Vancouver went on to face the Toronto St. Patricks of the National Hockey League (NHL), but would lose the best-of-five series for the Stanley Cup 3 games to 2. They finished second overall in each of their first three seasons, with their third season only one point behind first place, but that first season would be the only one in which they would win the playoffs and advance to the next series. After three seasons well above .500, they fell to last place overall in their fourth season (1924–25) with only 8 wins in 28 games. The Capitals tried spending their way out of their difficulties, but that only caused more problems. With the team in debt and losing money, they followed the NHL's example of heading south across the border and moved to Portland, Oregon for the start of the 1925–26 WHL season. The Regina Capitals renamed themselves the Portland Rosebuds, which was a rekindling of an older, then defunct, team from the PCHA. With that move, they became the only United States-based team in their league. Since they moved to the States, the league had to change its name to reflect that not all of its teams were based in Canada anymore. So, the \\"Canada\\" part of the league's name was dropped and it was renamed the Western Hockey League. The move didn't help the on-ice performance of the team very much. They didn't finish last overall, but with an extra eight games played from the previous season, they only managed to better their total wins by 4 giving them 12 wins in 36 games. After that season, the Western Hockey League folded. The National Hockey League bought every contract of ever player from the WHL for $258,000. The former Capitals/Rosebuds players would go on to form the nucleus of the expansion Chicago Black Hawks franchise, which began play the following season. ==Prairie Hockey League Capitals (1926–1927)== With the collapse of the WHL, many of the players and teams that didn't become part of the NHL re-grouped and formed a new semi-pro league called the Prairie Hockey League (PrHL). A \\"new\\" Regina Capitals were born. They finished third overall in the inaugural season of the PrHL, but faltered badly for the second season with only two wins in 26 games. That second season would be the final season for both the Regina Capitals and the Prairie Hockey League as the league disbanded following the season's end. ==Season-by-season record== Note: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, GF= Goals For, GA = Goals Against, Pts = Points { cellpadding=5 - bgcolor=\\"#dddddd\\"  Season Team name & League  GP  W  L  T  PTS  GF  GA  Finish  Playoffs - 1921–22 Regina Capitals (WCHL)  24 14 10 0 28 94 78  2nd in WCHL  Won league Championship - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" 1922–23 Regina Capitals (WCHL)  30 16 14  0  3293 97  2nd in WCHL  Lost in WCHL finals - 1923–24 Regina Capitals (WCHL)  30 17 11 2 36 83 67  2nd in WCHL  Lost in WCHL finals - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" 1924–25 Regina Capitals (WCHL)  28 8 20 0 16 72 121  6th (last) in WCHL  Out of playoffs - 1925–26 Portland Rosebuds (WHL)  36 12 16 8 26 84 106 4th in WHL  Out of playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" 1926–27  Regina Capitals (PrHL)  32 14 16 2 30 110 117  3rd in PrHL  - 1927–28  Regina Capitals (PrHL) 26 2 19 5  9 46 89 3rd (last) in PrHL  } ==Head coach== *Wes Champ ==Notable players== * Eddie Shore, 1924–1925 (later to Edmonton, then to Boston Bruins (NHL)) * Dick Irvin, 1922–1925 Chicago Black Hawks ==See also== *Western Canada Hockey League *Pacific Coast Hockey Association *List of pre-NHL seasons *Portland Rosebuds *Chicago Black Hawks *List of ice hockey teams in Saskatchewan ==References== * * * Category:Defunct ice hockey teams in Canada Category:Defunct sports teams in Saskatchewan Category:Sport in Regina, Saskatchewan Category:Ice hockey teams in Saskatchewan Category:Ice hockey clubs established in 1921 Category:1921 establishments in Saskatchewan Category:1928 disestablishments in Saskatchewan Category:Sports clubs disestablished in 1928 ","title":"Regina Capitals"},{"id":"2561997","text":"Pars palpebralis in a medical context means \\"relating to the eyelids.\\" It is the source of the English word \\"palpebral\\".

Kurakin, by Vladimir Borovikovsky. Prince Alexander Borisovich Kurakin, sometimes spelled Kourakine (; 18 January 1752 – Weimar, 6 / 24 June 1818) was a Russian statesman and diplomat, a member of the State Council (from 1810), who was ranked Actual Privy Counsellor 1st Class (see Table of Ranks). ==Life== Born in Moscow to a long line of Russian diplomats, he was the great grandson of Boris Kurakin, a Russian ambassador and close associate of Peter the Great. He moved to St. Petersburg in 1764 following the death of his father, Boris Alexandrovich Kurakin. There he became acquainted with Great Prince (Grand Duke) Pavel Petrovich, the future Emperor Paul I of Russia, and remained one of his most trusted friends. This friendship, though, did not meet the approval of the then reigning Empress Catherine II, and so Kurakin was forced to depart abroad. In 1776, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. After Catherine II's death, Kurakin was allowed to return to St. Petersburg in 1796 and he resumed his career, becoming Vice Chancellor in 1796. During the reign of Alexander I Kurakin became the Ambassador of Russia in Vienna in 1806. Two years later, he replaced Ambassador Pyotr Tolstoy in Paris. ==Ambassador in Paris== As ambassador in Paris, Kurakin was known for two political acts: taking an active part in the arrangements for the signing of the Treaty of Tilsit, and warning the Tsar about the upcoming war with the French. From 1810 Kurakin wrote numerous notes to Tsar Alexander, warning him of imminent war. After the last futile attempt to reconcile the Russian-French relationship at his meeting with Napoleon on 15 April 1812, the subsequent departure of Napoleon marking the start of Napoleon's invasion of Russia led to Kurakin resigning as ambassador. In Paris' higher circles, Kurakin was famously referred to as a \\"diamond prince\\", due to magnificence and richness of his costumes. It was one of these costumes that actually saved his life during a fire that happened during a ball given by Schwarzenberg, the Austrian ambassador on 1 July 1810. While escorting the women out of the blazing hall, he fell to the ground and was trampled by the panicking crowd, but his richly decorated coat protected him from the worst of the intense heat. Nevertheless, he was still badly burned and was confined to bed for several months. He is also credited with introducing Russian-style service à la russe to France, where it replaced the previous service à la française. He never married but he had illegitimate issue by Akulina Dmitrievna Samoilova, the Barons Wrjevsky, and by an unknown woman, the Barons Serdobin.

A Qutubi jihadi ideologue, he has popularized many of the most common themes of radical Islam today, like the theological impetus given to the notion of Al Wala' Wal Bara', being the first to declare the Saudi royal family to be apostates or considering democracy a religion, and thus whoever believes in it to be an apostate,Nibraz Kazimi, \\"A Virulent Ideology in Mutation:Zarqawi Upstages Maqdisi\\", September 12, 2005, Hudson Institute. but he is best known as the spiritual mentor of Jordanian jihadist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the initial leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq. However, an ideological and methodical split emerged between Maqdisi and Zarqawi in 2004 due to Zarqawi's takfeer proclamations towards the Shia populations in Iraq. Maqdisi opted for a more cautious approach towards targeted Shia killings, attempting to stop Zarqawi's radical ideological movement before Zarqawi's methods become counter- productive.Allawi, Ali A. \\"The Occupation of Iraq: Winning the War, Losing the Peace.\\" Yale University Press, 2007. The writings of Maqdisi still have a wide following; a studyUSMA Militant Ideology Atlas, summary carried out by the Combating Terrorism Center of the United States Military Academy (USMA) concluded that Maqdisi \\"is the most influential living Jihadi Theorist\\" and that \\"by all measures, Maqdisi is the key contemporary ideologue in the Jihadi intellectual universe\\". The Tawhed jihadist website, which he owns, continues to operate; the USMA report describes it as \\"al-Qa\`ida's main online library\\". ==Background== Maqdisi was born in 1959 in the city of Nablus, West Bank.Democracy: A Religion!, Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, Al Furqan Islamic Information Centre, Australia, 2012 Revised Edition, pp. 8-12. At a young age his family emigrated to Kuwait. He later studied at the University of Mosul in Iraq. It was during this time he began to take on an Islamist world view. He began to travel around Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in order to visit with numerous religious students and sheikhs. However he came to believe that many of these religious figures were ignorant of the true state of affairs in the Muslim world. He then began to study the writings of Sayyid Qutub and Hassan Al Banna and the methods of the Muslim Brotherhood. Maqdisi travelled to Pakistan and Afghanistan and met many of the Afghan jihad groups there at the time. In Pakistan he was based in the city of Peshawar, a center for the Afghan Jihad, remaining there for three years as a professor of religion, where he first met the later notorious Jordanian jihadist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and also where he published some of his most famous books : Millat Ibrahim, considered to be his single most influential work, and Al-Kawashif al-Jaliyya fi Kufr al-Dawla al- Sa'udiyya, where he declared the Saudi state to be infidel.Jean-Charles Brisard, Zarqawi: The New Face of Al-Qaeda, Polity (2005), pp. 18-19Joas Wagemakers, A Quietist Jihadi: The Ideology and Influence of Abu Muhammad Al- Maqdisi, Cambridge University Press (2012), p. 38 He also confronted the members of Takfir wal-Hijra and wrote a book refuting their extreme views. In 1992, he returned to Jordan. He began to denounce the Jordanian government and what he believed were the man-made laws being implemented there. He was also the first prominent Islamist scholar to brand the House of Saud as unbelievers or takfir, and to hold the adoption of democracy as tantamount to apostasy.A Virulent Ideology in Mutation: Zarqawi Upstages Maqdisi, Nibras Kazim, September 12, 2005 hudson.org His teachings gained many adherents and this earned him the attention of the Jordanian government, and he was arrested and imprisoned. During the years 1995–99 both he and al-Zarqawi were in prison together and he exerted a strong influence on al-Zarqawi, shaping his Islamist ideology. Their strategic plans were described by Fouad Hussein in his book Al-Zarqawi: The Second Generation of Al Qaeda. After they were released from prison, al-Zarqawi departed for Afghanistan while Maqdisi stayed in Jordan. He was later rearrested on terrorism charges for conspiring to attack American targets in Jordan. He was released again in July 2005, but arrested again after he gave an interview to al Jazeera. In 2009 he defended himself against \\"younger extremists accus[ing] him of going soft\\" by quoting the American Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, which identified him \\"as a dangerous and influential jihadi theorist.\\" \\"Credentials Challenged, Radical Quotes West Point\\" By ROBERT F. WORTH, The New York Times, April 29, 2009 Maqdisi served a five-year term in a Jordanian prison for allegations of jeopardising state security and recruiting jihadists to fight in Afghanistan. He was released in June 2014 by the Jordanian government, in a move speculated to be motivated by their opposition to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. On 21 September 2014, he advocated for the release of British hostage, Alan Henning. Al- Maqdisi said, \\"Henning worked with a charitable organization led by Muslims which sent several aid convoys to help the Syrian people. Is it reasonable that his reward is being kidnapped and slaughtered? ... He should be rewarded with thanks. ..We call on the (Islamic) State to release this man (Henning) and other aid group employees who enter the land of Muslims with a guarantee of protection ... according to the judgment of Shariah law,\\" he said.\\" Maqdisi has also told those thinking of fighting for the Yemeni government against the Shia insurgency of the Houthis, that they should instead keep well out of the war against the Houthis because Yemeni's must not help Yemen's pro-Western government, which deserves to be overthrown. Dr. Abdullah al-Muheisini, a Saudi expat and religious scholar who abandoned his life of wealth and privilege in Saudi Arabia to struggle side by side with the mujahideen in Syria, endorsed Islamic scholars like Al-Balawi, Eyad Quneibi, Tareq Abdulhalim, Hani al-Siba'i, Yusuf al-Ahmed, Abdulaziz al-Tureifi, Suleiman al- Ulwan, Abu Qatada al-Filistini, and Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi.

Relying on Cassiodorus, Jordanes says that the Balts were \\"second\\" after the Ostrogothic Amals.post Amalos secunda nobilitas Balthorumque He claims that the family was named from long ago for its daring: \\"Baltha, which [in Gothic] means bold\\" (Baltha, qui est audax).Arne Søby Christensen, Cassiodorus, Jordanes and the History of the Goths: Studies in a Migration Myth (Museum Tusculanum Press, 2002), pp. 320–21. Historian Herwig Wolfram theorizes that the name may derive from Pliny the Elder's island of Baltia (i.e., isle of the Balts), which he also calls Basilia (i.e., royal land). The Visigoths as a nation were formed under the rule of Alaric I, the first named Balt, only in 395. He famously sacked Rome in 410. His descendants continued to rule down to 531, when on the death of Amalaric the line went extinct. In 507, the Visigoths were defeated by the Franks at the Battle of Vouillé and lost most of their kingdom. In 511, the Ostrogothic king Theoderic the Great intervened to depose the Balt king Gesalec. He ruled himself until his death in 526, when Amalaric succeeded him. Theoderic's intervention is often credited with saving the Visigothic kingdom, but it ended the Balt dynasty. The private wealth (res privata) of the Balt kings, which had been a foundation of their legitimacy, was transformed into the royal treasury (thesaurus regalis) and became state property after 531.Pablo C. Díaz and María R. Valverde, \\"The Theorethical Strength and Practical Weakness of the Visigothic Monarchy of Toledo\\", in Frans Theuws and Janet L.

It was published by Cappi Diabelli in Vienna in November 1821. The text is derived from a poem written by German poet Matthias Claudius. The song is set for voice and piano. ==Composition== The piece begins with an introduction in D minor; the first eight bars in the time signature 2/2. Both hands play chords. The section is quiet (pianissimo) and slow (mäßig), and presents the musical theme of Death. The Maiden enters in the ninth bar on an anacrusis. This section is more agitated than the first; it is marked piano and \\"somewhat faster\\" (etwas geschwinder). The melody gradually increases in pitch, chromatically at points. The piano accompaniment is syncopated, playing chords of quavers alternating in the left and right hand. A diminished chord in the first bar of the third line (ich bin noch jung) creates an eerie mood. In the eighth bar of the maiden's song, on the word rühre (\\"touch\\"), the quavers stop and the rhythm of the opening section returns. Then an imperfect cadence leads to a rest with fermata. This brings the second section to a total of 13 bars in length. The third and final section is Death's song. The music returns to the tempo and dynamics of the introduction. Death's melody has a narrow pitch range (save for the very last note where the singer has the option of dropping to D below the melody line). The key modulates to F major, the relative major of D minor. With the last syllable of Death's song, the key changes into D major. The coda is almost a repeat of the introduction, except it is shortened by one bar and is now in the major key. ==Text== { ! German ! English - Das Mädchen: Vorüber! Ach, vorüber! Geh, wilder Knochenmann! Ich bin noch jung! Geh, Lieber, Und rühre mich nicht an. Und rühre mich nicht an. Der Tod: Gib deine Hand, du schön und zart Gebild! Bin Freund, und komme nicht, zu strafen. Sei gutes Muts! ich bin nicht wild, Sollst sanft in meinen Armen schlafen! The Maiden: Pass me by! Oh, pass me by! Go, fierce man of bones! I am still young! Go, dear, And do not touch me. And do not touch me. Death: Give me your hand, you beautiful and tender form! I am a friend, and come not to punish. Be of good cheer!

Its main campus was opened on the Gießberg in 1972 after being founded in 1966. The university is Germany's southernmost university and is situated on the shore of Lake Constance just four kilometers from the Swiss border. It has been successful in all three funding lines of the Excellence Initiative, and is therefore one of Germany's elite \\"Universities of Excellence\\", a group of prestigious universities often considered the German Ivy League. The university is ranked in top 100 worldwide in the field of social policy and admistration in the 2020 QS World University Rankings, and ranked 51 in Political Science according to the 2020 ShanghaiRanking. The U.S. Department of Energy also refers to the University of Konstanz as a \\"small Harvard\\". Moreover, the University of Konstanz cooperates with a large number of renowned institutions, such as Harvard, Johns Hopkins University, Yale University, the University of Chicago, UC Berkeley, University of Zurich., and the Balsillie School of International Affairs. In addition to having approximately 11,500 students from around 100 countries, the university maintains over 220 partnerships with European universities as well as numerous international exchange programmes, thereby facilitating global networking. Students may choose from more than 100 degree programmes. Its library is open 24 hours a day and has more than two million books. ==History== ===Origins=== A university was briefly located in Konstanz during the 17th and 18th century. As a branch of the University of Freiburg, it was located in the Lanzenhof (today a building housing the administration of justice at the Untere Laube street) and existed from 1686–1698 as well as 1713–1715. The University of Konstanz was founded in 1966 as a reform university. In its early years it was located in various building in the inner city until 1972, when the campus was established on the Giessberg.History of the university, retrieved 29 January 2018 The university logo was designed by Otl Aicher in 1980, one of the most well-known graphic designers of the 20th century. Instead of creating institutes, the university was designed with (smaller than usual) departments and working groups, with a focus on developing teaching through research. In order to more easily transcend the boundaries between academic subjects and infrastructure, the Anglo-Saxon concept of the campus university was adapted, through which the administration and service providers such as the canteen and library have become easily accessible and centralised locations. The reform measures included the transformation of traditional learning and instructional mediums such as lectures to seminars or tutorials. The use of course-related performance assessments developed out of the implementation of these new measures. ===Transitions=== The single-stage legal education and training was adapted by the university in the context of a pilot programme in the 1970s and 1980s, in which the practical phase and university study were closely interlinked. At the beginning, the university also offered basic studies in social science through which students of administrative science, economics and law completed their studies together. After many of these projects expired, the university “reinvented” itself in accordance with the recommendations from the Mittelstraßcommission: To promote even more intense collaboration within the university, it was divided into three faculties with a total of 13 departments in 1999. The departments replaced the previous schools and working groups and the tasks and responsibilities of these schools have since been carried out and fulfilled by the faculties in accordance with the Landeshochschulgesetz LHG (state law on higher education). The university's consistent use of centralised service providers has not changed. Especially the 24-hour library, which provides easy access to all of its books, is a well-known feature of the university. ===University of Excellence=== The institutional strategy of the university, “Modell Konstanz - Towards a Culture of Creativity”, was adopted on 19 October 2007 in the context of the German Excellence Initiative, which administered jointly by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the German Council of Science and Humanities. Additionally, four Collaborative Research Centres (CRC) funded by the DFG are currently operating at the University of Konstanz. The \\"Zentrum für den wissenschaftlichen Nachwuchs\\" (ZWN) or Centre for Young Researchers was recognized in this third funding line of the German Excellence Initiative and stirred great interest across Germany, leading the press to refer to the university as the \\"mini Harvard at Lake Constance\\". The ZWN was created in 2001 to support junior researchers in gaining access to the highest possible amount of funding and flexibility for their research. It was successfully incorporated into the Zukunftskolleg in late 2007, which was again recognised in the second round of the Excellence Initiative in 2012. In that same year, the Zukunftskolleg successfully applied for co-financing from the EU-funded “Marie Curie Actions COFUND” programme in the amount of 6.24 million euros. The resulting Zukunftskolleg Incoming Fellowship Programme (ZIF-Marie-Curie- Programme) allowed the Zukunftskolleg to further develop its fellowship programme by adding one additional international component. The DFG's 2018 Funding Atlas retrieved 20 July 2018] once again confirmed the University of Konstanz's top national rankings from 2015 retrieved 20 July 2018] in regard to external funding obtained from the DFG. When comparing the funding in terms of per-capita values for all academic staff members (including professors), the university climbed one position to 1st place in Germany. Calculated on the basis of professors alone, the university's per-capita external funding volume ranked 2nd. When counting all acdacemic staff members, the per-capita funding totals in the life sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences were ranked 1st in Germany. The University of Konstanz's status as a research- oriented university of excellence was reaffirmed in the second round of the Excellence Initiative competition in 2012.About the Excellence Initiative, retrieved 23 October 2017 The university has also successfully participated in the Professorinnenprogramm retrieved 20 July 2018] (funding programme for female professors). In each of its two funding phases, two female professor positions were funded through this programme. To optimise its services, the university's library, IT Service Centre and administrative IT were combined in 2012 to form the new organisational unit Communications, Information, Media Centre (KIM).Communications, Information, Media Centre (KIM) at the University of Konstanz, retrieved 23 October 2017 The Excellence Strategy of the German Federal and State Governments at the University of Konstanz: The University of Konstanz submitted three full cluster proposals to the DFG in February 2018. The funding decision for the Excellence Cluster funding line was announced on 27 September 2018: Two of the three submitted cluster initiatives will be funded: The “Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour” and \\"The Politics of Inequality: Perceptions, Participation and Policies”. Since two Clusters of Excellence are the prerequisite for competing in the second funding line \\"Universities of Excellence\\", the University of Konstanz has submitted a full proposal in this funding line in December 2018. The German Council of Science and Humanities will announce the final decision in regard to the second funding line in July 2019.About the Excellence Strategy of the German Federal and State Governments, retrieved 25 January 2019 ==Campus== ===Geography=== The university comprises approximately 90,000 square metres and lies on the Gießberg within the Mainauwald (Mainau forest). It belongs to Konstanz's Egg district, with the old village of Egg located a distance of 200 metres from campus on the far side of the Mainaustrasse (Mainau street). Two pedestrian and bike bridges connect the university grounds to the village and lakeside. Just like the village, the university's sports grounds are located on the lakeside of the street, north of Egg. The university's botanical garden is located to the north-west of the north parking lot and is open on weekdays. Before the independent village of Allmannsdorf was merged with the city of Konstanz on 1 January 1915, all of the land that the university now occupies belonged to this former community. ===Architecture=== The university was designed as a customised space to facilitate social interaction between researchers, teachers and students, thereby departing from traditional university building layouts. Instead of a scattered array of individual buildings, architect Horst Linde drafted a compact university complex with interlinked buildings. The idea was to adapt the architecture to the hillside location, similar to a mountain village. Designer Wilhelm von Wolff's idea was that \\"people should be able to stroll through the university as if it were an old city centre with squares and alleyways that provide opportunities for casual encounters, perhaps with something mysterious here and there to rouse expectations\\". In order to shorten the routes to the centrally-located Agora, the planners made it a requirement that the radius of the university area should not exceed 500 to 700 meters. Construction started in 1970 and lasted until 1983. Since then, the university has made several additions, all of which followed the original plans. In 2012, major university building sections were identified as historic monuments and provided official monument protection in recognition of their collective design and construction. ===Percent for art=== The following artworks have been constructed as part of Percent for art projects on university grounds: The glass roof (1972) consisting of 227 coloured pyramids in the main entrance area of the university, designed by Otto Piene; the pipe sculptures (1969-1974) by Friedrich Gräsel in the Hockgrabental; the gate structures (1984) by Georg Karl Pfahler; the spool sculpture (1972) by Gottfried Bechtold; and the wooden head sculptures (1993) by Stephan Balkenhols. ==Organization== === Faculties and Departments === The 13 departments of the university are divided into three faculties: ==== Faculty of Sciences ==== * Biology * Chemistry * Computer and Information Science * Mathematics and Statistics * Physics * Psychology ==== Faculty of Humanities ==== * History and Sociology * Literary Studies * Linguistics * Philosophy ==== Faculty of Politics, Law and Economics ==== * Economics * Law * Politics and Public Administration ===Central institutions=== The university comprises several central institutions: * The Communication, Information, Media Centre (KIM) is the university's primary service provider for IT and library services. KIM was created in 2014 by combining the library, IT Service Centre and administrative IT. It supports teaching, research and study at the University of Konstanz. ** The library of the University of Konstanz is the central service provider for all literature and information needs at the University of Konstanz. It provides access to approximately two million freely accessible and systematically organised print media and 1,600 work stations in an area of 25,000 square metres at the heart of the university. The library was conceptually redesigned, adapted to current requirements and thoroughly renovated between 2011 and 2017 as part of a pollutant remediation project. The library services are responsible for making printed and electronic media accessible and answer all questions that are related to their service spectrum. The KonSearch literature search engine provides access to over 400 million digital and printed media items. ** The IT services provide all the services required for the operation and further development of a university. In this way, both researchers and students can benefit from essential services such as the email system, the e-learning platform, campus management, IT security and central storage services. * The International Office is responsible for advancing and sustaining international relations with other universities. It also provides support and guidance to visiting students and advises students interested in studying abroad. * The Career Service is a university service provider established as a joint initiative between the university, the Chamber of Industry and Commerce Hochrhein-Bodensee and the Agentur für Arbeit Konstanz-Ravensburg (employment agency). It helps students prepare to enter the job market and assists employers in their search for new employees. * The Language Institute (SLI) coordinates all foreign language training activities. * Since 2010, the Student Service Centre (SSZ) has been providing one-stop service to students who need to complete bureaucratic procedures (enrol, pay fees, receive certificates). * The central committees at the university are particularly important. A distinctive feature in Konstanz is the Committee on Research (AFF), which is a body of four representatives from each faculty (three professors and one academic staff member) that facilitates an equitable competition for research funds within the university. Every post-doc at the university can request staff funding and material resources from the AFF for up to two years. These funds are usually intended to provide start-up funding for third-party-funded research projects. The AFF is also responsible for distributing a substantial portion of the additional funds awarded through the Excellence Initiative. The Studentenwerk Seezeit student services is a supra- regional service provider for German universities, including the University of Konstanz. Not only does it specialise in providing students consultation regarding BAFöG and other social services, but it is also responsible for food and refreshment services (canteen) as well as maintaining and assigning student accommodations (residence halls). === Research institutionsResearch institutions, University of Konstanz website, retrieved 29 January 2018 === ==== Collaborative Research Centres ==== * Anisotropic Particles as Building Blocks: Tailoring Shape, Interactions and Structures (SFB 1214) * Chemical and Biological Principles of Cellular Proteostasis (SFB 969) * Controlled Nanosystems: Interaction and Interfacing to the Macroscale (SFB 767) * Quantitative Methods for Visual Computing (SFB-TRR 161) ==== Research groups ==== * The Dynamics of Risk – Perception and Behavior in the Context of Mental and Physical Health (Risk Dynamics - FOR 2374) * New Insights into the Bcl-2 family interactions – from biophysics to function (FOR 2036) * Nonlinear response to probe vitrification (FOR 1394) * Mediale Teilhabe.

This position makes Konstanz the best German university amongst those assessed, all of which are under 50 years old. This assessment was underscored by the 2014 edition of the global ranking \\"QS Top 50 under 50\\", which also concentrates on universities under the age of 50. In this case Konstanz came 21st in the global comparison. The University of Konstanz is consistently ranked among the global top 250 by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings. ==Regional and international collaboration== ===Regional collaboration=== Experts from the University of Konstanz, in collaboration with experienced consultants from schools, universities and employment agencies, have conceptualised the two-day Entscheidungstraining BEST (career and study orientation training programme). Additionally, the University of Konstanz was also involved in the development of an orientation test by the universities in the state of Baden-Württemberg. Through the collaboration with the HSG Konstanz handball team, the university supports elite sport activities by offering young and ambitious student-athletes exclusive scholarships. ===International collaboration=== The University of Konstanz maintains an extensive cooperation network with regional, national and international partner institutions from the areas of science, economics, politics and the public sector.Cooperations at the University of Konstanz, retrieved 29 January 2018 On the regional level, the university cooperates closely with Kanton Thurgau. This allows us to offer, among others, joint study programmes with the Thurgau University of Teacher Education (PHTG). Other German-Swiss collaborations include the Biotechnology Institute Thurgau (BITg) and the Thurgau Institute of Economics (TWI). Through the Internationale Bodensee- Hochschule, the University of Konstanz is connected to 30 other universities in the tri-border area Germany - Austria - Switzerland. On the international level, the University of Konstanz cooperates with around 220 partner universities in the context of the Erasmus Programme. Furthermore, the University of Konstanz maintains connections to around 100 strategically important and select international institutions. The university's International Office implements and promotes internationality in all areas of the university including research, teaching, study and administration. It enables and supports a wide range of international activities: from short visits by guest lecturers and doctoral students to summer schools, international workshops and start-up financing for new collaborations. Established networks between the university's organisational units make it possible to successfully address and complete tasks together. For this reason, the International Office is not only the first stop for international and Konstanz students, but also for the university's departments. The Welcome Center, on the other hand, supports and guides all international guest researchers at all stages of their careers (doctoral students, post-docs and professors). ==The Konstanz Science Forum== Since 2006, the University of Konstanz has hosted the Konstanz Science Forum,The Konstanz Science Forum website (in German) retrieved 7 November 2017 which is conceived as a \\"platform for knowledge transfer and science communication for the University of Konstanz\\". The forum will serve as an interface for \\"economy, politics and society\\" and deal with topics related to research and higher education during conferences. The founding members of the forum were Gerhart von Graevenitz as rector of the university, Renate Köcher from the Institut für Demoskopie Allensbach (IfD Allensbach), the biologist and science manager Hubert Markl, the philosopher Jürgen Mittelstraß and the economist Horst Siebert. Since 2008, the forum has published a series of books to commemorate its conferences. These books address topics such as creativity, \\"Project Europe\\", networks and clusters. The most recent book (2013) on \\"Macht und Wissenschaft\\" (power and science), was published by the Universitätsverlag Konstanz (university publishing house). ==Student body== After a forty-year absence, the organised student body (Verfasste Studierendenschaft) was reintroduced on 13 July 2012 through the organised student body law (Verfasste Studierendenschaft-Gesetz).Students' union website (in German) retrieved 19 January 2018 This allowed students to not only organise as a status group within the university, but also as an official student body or a legally binding constituent entity governed by public law (Teilkörperschaft des öffentlichen Rechts) of the University of Konstanz. The Rectorate carries out the legal supervision of this body, but not the technical supervision according to § 65b para. 6 LHG (state law on higher education). According to § 65a para. 8 LHG, the organised student body is by law a member of the student representative body of the state of Baden-Württemberg (Landesstudierendenvertretung Baden-Württemberg). By resolution of the StuPa (student parliament) and through the approval of the LEO (legislative organ) in January 2014, it also replaced the former u-AStA (university student union) in the fzs (national union of students). ===Responsibilities=== According to § 65 para. 2 LHG, the organised student body manages its own affairs within the framework of the legal provisions. Without infringing upon the responsibilities of the university and the Studentenwerk (state-run non-profit organisation for student services), it carries out the following tasks: * representing the students' political, academic and multidisciplinary interests as well as their social, economic and cultural concerns into consideration, * participation in carrying out university duties in accordance with §§ 2 to 7 (in particular: fostering and developing the sciences and the arts through research, teaching, study and continuing education in a free and democratic state dedicated to public welfare and the rule of law; supporting the social well-being of students; supporting junior researchers and artists, and supporting international cooperation, in particular European cooperation) * supporting students’ political education and fostering their civic responsibility, * promoting equal opportunities and reducing disadvantages within the student body, * fostering national and international student relations. The organised student body currently offers free legal advice, a bicycle workshop and a student café. A student beer garden on the campus and a bicycle rental service are run by an independent (friends’) association. Due to a lack of new agreements, traditional responsibilities that are usually carried out by student body representatives in other federal states have remained with the Studentenwerk Seezeit (Seezeit student services) in Baden- Württemberg in accordance to the LHG. This applies, in particular, to issuing the semester ticket (Studi-Ticket) and providing BAföG (German Federal Training Assistance Act) counselling. ===Organisation=== In accordance to article 3 § 1 of the organised student body law, which required an original vote on organisational statutes for the student body, the basic configuration of the organised student body is organised and structured on the basis of the provisions of the LHG. Additional statutes govern the particulars relating to the finances, elections, and the departmental student councils. The organised student body's organisational structure has centralised and decentralised components. While it is its own representative body (the organised student body as such), 16 departmental student councils (Studienfachschaften) representing students from all university departments or related study programmes take on delegated responsibilities of and for the organised student body. Since the LHG binds the term Fachschaft (student council) to university institutions or faculties (§ 65a para. 4 LHG), the university chose this form of subcategorisation using a different name in order to meet the special needs of the comparatively smaller university. Since a corresponding institution does not exist for teacher education students (Lehramtsstudierende) at the university level, these students are represented by the student councils at the department to which their major study subjects are assigned to. The teacher education working group (Arbeitskreis Lehramt) and a section within the AStA (student union) support the special interests and concerns of the teacher education students. == Well-known individuals == === Honorary citizens of the University of Konstanz === * Gerhard Hess, Founding Rector * Kurt Georg Kiesinger, former German Chancellor * Horst Sund, former Rector * Gerhart von Graevenitz, former Rector === Honorary senators of the University of Konstanz === * Herbert Beeck, businessman and CEO of the LBS (Badische Landesbausparkasse) * Dietrich H.

He was made the president of the Surat factory and the governor of Bombay in 1669, which posts he held until his death in 1677. He was responsible for the initial growth of the city. He is said to have famously quoted Bombay to be \\"the city which by God's assistance is intended to be built\\". It was during his tenure that the small town island of Bombay was converted into a promising hub for commerce. Great care was taken to bring the best traders, artisans and other professions to settle in Bombay. He is credited with adopting principles of religious toleration, empowered local self-governments and a strong focus on commerce ably supported by the creation of courts and enforcement through the formation of the local militia of Bhandari youth which evolved into the Bombay Police. Encyclopædia Britannica, 11th Edition, Volume 4, Slice 2 states that he was brother of Francis Aungier, 3rd Lord Aungier of Longford and 1st Earl of Longford in Ireland. Though significant research on the life and work of Gerald Aungier is not readily available, his contribution in shaping Bombay is broadly recognised by early prominent historians Da Cunha, Douglas and Edwardes in their separate works. Historian Phirozshah Malabari dedicates a full chapter to Gerald Aungier in his book Bombay in the Making. Historian S. M. Edwardes states Aungier's great work was: > \\"to weld into one homogeneous mass the discordant materials of Asiatic > nationalities, to solve the problem which had never been solved before, as > to how a great multitude of men of diverse religions and races should live > together in peace and harmony, free from discord within and aggression > without — this was the work he set himself to do, and he did it.\\" ==Early life== Little is known of the early years of Gerald Aungier in India, much less of his childhood and youth in England. He was born in 1640, the second son of Rev. Ambrose Aungier, Prebendary of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin and Grisel Bulkeley, daughter of the Archbishop of Dublin, Lancelot Bulkeley. He was the grandson of Francis Aungier, 1st Baron Aungier of Longford \\"Aungier-Baron Aungier of Longford\\", A genealogical history of the dormant..., p. 18, Retrieved 4 October 2009. His name enabled Historian Douglas to surmise that he came from the French town of Angers and his forefathers probably fled to England after the terrible massacre of Protestants on the eve of St. Bartholomew in 1572. Young Aungier in all likelihood trained in England and must have had a fairly good education, evidenced by the countless letters he wrote to his masters in England and his subordinates in Bombay which display an extensive and wholesome reading. ==Career== Like Sir George Oxenden (governor), Aungier entered the service of the Company at an early age and rose in rank step by step. He was appointed as a Factor for Surat in November 1661, and by 1663 he occupied the post of warehouse keeper at Surat.Bombay in the Making, Phiroze B M Malabari, 1910 He was deputed by the Surat factory to accompany the Earl of Marlborough when the latter claimed the town and island of Bombay in 1662 on behalf of the King of Great Britain. On the death of Sir George Oxenden on 14 July 1669, Aungier became the President of the Surat factory, a post which then carried with it the governorship of the port and island of Bombay. ==Relationship with native powers== Aungier was also at the helm in Surat on 3 October 1670 when Shivaji invaded Surat. He secured the British settlement and saved the lives and property within their fortifications. He showed great wisdom in managing both Mughal and Maratha aggressions. His constant reply to both was that the British were merchants and cannot take one side or the other. He sent envoys to Shivaji thrice and made treaties with Shivaji. His ambassadors were present at Shivaji's coronation. ==Governorship of Bombay== Aungier embarked at Surat on 11 January 1670 and arrived in Bombay a few days later. The town was rife with many allegations of improprieties against Deputy Governor Captain Henry Young, and Aungier's immediate task was to investigate these allegations. He immediately set about defining the rules and regulations based on which Bombay must be governed and without which other reforms would be useless. Learning from the incessant perils of wars and tyranny being faced by traders in Surat, his first idea was that the city needed absolute peace and security. He therefore set out to set up the courts of Judicature and strengthening the fortifications of Bombay. He also initiated a survey of Bombay with a view of ascertaining the island's total land revenue. Although this trip lasted just under a month, it had set the foundations for future work. 1671 found Aungier frustrated as he was stranded at Surat, first by the disturbances/delays created by the Mughal Governor and later by the advent of Shivaji. This strengthened his resolve to move the seat of government from Surat to Bombay, a suggestion that was finally implemented after his death in 1687. The revenue survey of Bombay indicated that the cost of upkeep far exceeded the revenues collected. Aungier implemented a set of measures that would encourage commerce at one end and improve tax collections on the other. He placed very high importance in the justice system being credible that would give confidence to all those residing on the island. He felt the European system may not meet the demands of Indian natives. ===Setting up Panchayats=== Realising the importance of being able to attract the wealthy traders and merchants from Surat to Bombay, he set up Panchayats based on each community, something that expanded access of justice and governance to not only the wealthy but also the poorest within each community. This one master stroke, created healthy competition amongst communities and ensured proper law and order as each Panchayat became responsible for their community's conduct. ===Property titles=== While ceding Bombay to the British, the local Portuguese government did everything in its power to make the transition difficult. One such measure was to declare that most of the lands of any value was the property of private individuals and hence could not be ceded to the crown or company. Aungier created an amicable settlement on property titles by arranging residents to pay annual quit rents in lieu of better administration. ===Acquisition of Colaba and Old Woman Island=== Aungier negotiated the acquisition of the islands of Colaba and Old Woman from the Portuguese ===Company patent to Neema Parrack=== Neema Parrack was a reputed Banya trader based in Diu, who presented certain conditions before moving to Bombay. He demanded a patent under the seal of the company that secured him and his community the right of practicing their religion not only to themselves but in perpetuity to their descendants. Though instances of religious toleration by rulers abound in medieval Indian history, this may be one of the first instances of a government granting a patent guaranteeing religious toleration. The patent was granted by Aungier on 22 March 1677.Bombay in the Making, Phiroze B M Malabari, 1910 ===Making Bombay the seat of British presidency in Western India=== Aungier proposed the shifting of Presidency of West India to Bombay, something that finally took effect many years after his death on 2 May 1687 ===Bhandari Militia=== Aungier engaged the services of around 600 Bhandari Militia men who were maintained by 100 of the principal landowners of the island. He organized the Bhandari Militia with Subhedars headquartered at Mahim, Sewree and Sion. ===Establishment of the Mint=== An event which attracted the wealthy trader population was the establishment of a Mint in 1676 for the coinage of \\"rupees, pies and bujurks\\". Tavernier who reported in 1678 that the currency was circulated within the fort precincts and some two or three leagues in the country. ===First execution in Bombay under British law=== Aungier was called in 1674 to quell a mutiny by English soldiers, and the first execution by British law as far as we can learn in Bombay was ordered by him. The execution took place on 21 October 1674 when Corporal Fake was shot. ==Accomplishments and legacy== Although the Portuguese king had ceded all the islands of Bombay to the British king Charles II of England, the Portuguese in India refused to hand over the territory. It was not till 1675 that Aungier actually took possession of Colaba and Old Woman's Island, thus completing the transfer of power to the British. His plan of fortifying the main island, from Dongri in the north to the harbour, had to wait until 1715 for completion, when Charles Boone became the governor of the town. He offered various inducements to skilled workers and traders to set up business in Bombay. His offers were tempting enough to lure many traders and artisans from Gujarat to the newly developing town. As a result Bombay registered its first population boom. Between 1661 and 1675 there was a sixfold increase in population. Aungier ceded land near the Malabar Hill to immigrant Parsi workers and traders for a Tower of Silence. It was during his governorship, in 1670, that the first printing press was imported and set up in Bombay. Bombay's population was around 10,000 people when Aungier assumed charge and had grown to 80,000 by the time of his death eight years later. The revenue too had grown from GBP 2,823 to GBP 9,254. During Aungier's governorship of Bombay the foundation stone of St. Thomas Church was laid. A silver chalice presented by Aungier to the Anglican Christian community in 1675 is among the historic treasures of the now diocesan cathedral. George Oxenden, first governor of Bombay, is buried in one of the nearby tombs, as is the later factory president Bartholomew Harris. Aungier died in Surat on 30 June 1677. His tomb lies close to that of Sir George Oxenden. His grave was unmarked for many years and was finally identified and a tablet was installed under instructions from Lord Curzon in 1916 http://suratmunicipal.org/content/city/heritage/english_cemeteries_geraid.shtml ==References== *Bombay and Western India by James Douglas, 1893 *Rise of Bombay: A Retrospect by S M Edwardes, 1902 ==External links== *Bombay: History of a City Category:1640s births Category:1677 deaths Category:History of Mumbai Category:Governors of Bombay Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Gerald Aungier"},{"id":"2562058","text":"Megalopyge opercularis is a moth of the family Megalopygidae. It has numerous common names, including southern flannel moth for its adult form, and puss caterpillar, asp, Italian asp, woolly slug, opossum bug, puss moth, tree asp, or asp caterpillar. == Description == The inch-long larva is generously coated in long, luxuriant hair-like setae, making it resemble a tiny Persian cat, the characteristic that presumably gave it the name \\"puss\\". It is variable in color, from downy grayish white to golden brown to dark charcoal gray. It often has a streak of bright orange running longitudinally. The \\"fur\\" on early-stage larvae is sometimes extremely curly, giving them a cottony, puffed-up look. The body tapers to a tail that extends well beyond the body, unlike its relative M. crispata. The middle instar has a more disheveled, \\"bad-hair-day\\" appearance, without a distinctive tail. The \\"fur\\" of the larva contains venomous spines that cause extremely painful reactions in human skin upon contact. The adult moth is covered in long fur in colors ranging from dull orange to lemon yellow, with hairy legs and fuzzy black feet. == Habitat == M. opercularis can be found on oak, elm, and wild plum, among others, as well as many garden plants such as roses and ivy. It is distributed throughout the Eastern United States between extreme southeastern Virginia and Florida, the southern United States, Mexico, and parts of Central America. == Dangers and treatment of stings == The caterpillar is regarded as a dangerous insect because of its venomous spines. Exposure to the caterpillar's fur-like spines leads to an immediate skin irritation characterized by a \\"grid-like hemorrhagic papular eruption with severe radiating pain.\\" Victims describe the pain as similar to a broken bone or blunt-force trauma, or even white hot.https://www.nbc12.com/2020/09/11/venomous-caterpillar-no-one-has-heard- sends-new-kent-woman-er/ The reactions are sometimes localized to the affected area, but are often very severe, radiating up a limb and causing burning, swelling, nausea, headache, abdominal distress, rashes, blisters, and sometimes chest pain, numbness, or difficulty breathing. Sweating from the welts or hives at the site of the sting is not unusual. The venom from the spines is best treated within hours of first contact. For first aid, the spines (if present) should be removed by using cellophane tape. Some remedies, which are reported to have varying degrees of success, include ice packs, oral antihistamine, baking soda, hydrocortisone cream, juice from the stems of comfrey plants, and calamine lotion. ==References== == External links == * * * Research on the Asp Caterpillar at Baylor College of Medicine * Info page with photos * BugGuide account * Megalopyge opercularis on the UF / IFAS Featured Creatures website. * Aylin Woodward, Caroline Praderio: Poisonous Caterpillars That Look Like Bad Wigs Are Popping Up All Over Virginia; on: sciencealert; 10 October 2020; source: Business Insider.

Althea and her four siblings, Sherry, Debbie, Marsha and Richard, came from an abusive home. When Althea was eight, her father Richard shot and killed her mother, June, her grandfather, and June's best friend, before fatally shooting himself. Althea's grandmother was present during the incident, but survived by hiding in the nearby creek. Althea and three of her siblings were later put into the OSSO Home (Ohio Soldiers and Sailors Orphanage) in Xenia, Ohio, which she ran away from many times because she was very unhappy after being sexually molested when sent to possible adoptor's homes. ==Career== She met Larry Flynt at age 17 in 1971, when she applied for a job as a go-go dancer at his Hustler club in Columbus, Ohio. They were married on August 21, 1976. She was Hustler's first life-size centerfold, and as Publisher/Editor was involved with the development, management and publication of the magazine until her untimely death; she ran the magazine and kept it afloat during Larry's \\"born again\\" experience brought on by a psychotic bipolar manic episode in 1977, his subsequent near-fatal crippling shooting in Georgia in 1978 and multiple bouts with bipolar disorder which also led to his campaign for President of the United States in 1984. In the mid-1980s, Althea planned a new non-pornographic magazine called The Rage, to focus on the punk subculture. The Rage was ultimately abandoned due to the expense of Flynt's 1984 presidential run. In 1982 Althea began using the drugs that Larry was prescribed for pain after he was shot in 1978, and developed an addiction. She was diagnosed with AIDS in 1983; Flynt stated that she contracted the disease from an untested blood transfusion during a hysterectomy, and that she always used clean needles when using drugs. ==Death== Althea died at age 33 when she drowned in the bathtub at the couple's Bel-Air mansion in Los Angeles on June 27, 1987. According to reports, she passed out from a prescription drug overdose and drowned. Her husband, however, states that at the time she was in the advanced stages of AIDS and would have died within that year, regardless. At that point he was taking care of her and claims that she was practically bedridden. Althea Flynt is buried in the Flynt family cemetery plot, located on Lakeville in Salyersville, Kentucky. ==In popular culture== In the 1996 movie The People vs. Larry Flynt she was portrayed by Courtney Love, who was nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance. ==References== ;Notes ;Citations * ==External links== * Category:1953 births Category:1987 deaths Category:Accidental deaths in California Category:American magazine publishers (people) Category:Burials in Kentucky Category:Deaths by drowning Category:Drug-related deaths in California Category:People from Marietta, Ohio Category:People with HIV/AIDS Category:20th-century American businesspeople Category:20th-century American businesswomen Category:Kentucky women writers ","title":"Althea Flynt"},{"id":"2562075","text":"Wyatt Eaton, baptised Charles Wyatt Eaton, (May 6, 1849June 7, 1896) was a Canadian/American portrait and figure painter, remembered as one of the founders of the Society of American Artists. ==Biography== Born in Philipsburg, Quebec, Lower Canada, Eaton was a student of the National Academy of Design, New York.

Statues and icons veiled in violet shrouds for Passiontide in St Pancras Church, Ipswich (in Catholic churches in England, paintings are also veiled) ==History== \\"Passiontide\\" refers to the last two weeks of Lent. According to Cyril of Scythopolis, during this time the monks of the East, who had chosen the desert for a severer mode of life, returned to their monasteries. In certain countries, such as Brazil and Italy, it is seen as the beginning of the Holy Week observances. The Viernes de Dolores (Friday of Sorrows). is a solemn pious remembrance of the sorrowful Blessed Virgin Mary on the Friday before Palm Sunday held in the fifth week of Lent. In the Orthodox Church, the Fifth Saturday of Great Lent is known as the Saturday of the Akathist, when the \\"Akathist to the Theotokos\\" is sung at Compline. ==Observance== In the Roman Catholic Church, Western Rite Orthodoxy, Lutheranism, and in Anglo-Catholic churches, all crucifixes and images may be covered in veils (usually violet, the color of vestments in Lent) starting on Passion Sunday: \\"The practice of covering crosses and images in the church may be observed, if the episcopal conference decides. The crosses are to be covered until the end of the celebration of the Lord's passion on Good Friday. Statues and images are to remain covered until the beginning of the Easter Vigil.\\"Note at the end of the Mass of Saturday of the Fourth Week of Lent in the Roman Missal (Specifically, those veils are removed during the singing of the Gloria.) The veiling was associated with Passion Sunday's Gospel (), in which Jesus \\"hid himself\\" from the people. In the Tridentine Mass, Psalm 42 (43) is omitted at ferial Masses until Holy Thursday inclusive, as is the short doxology (Gloria Patri) at the Introit and the Psalm Lavabo at Mass. It is likewise omitted in Psalm 94 at Matins, and the responds at Matins, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, and Compline. Also in the ferial Mass, the Preface for Lent gives way to the Preface of the Cross. In the 1955 Holy Week revisions, Passion Sunday was formally renamed from Dominica Passionis or Dominica de Passione (\\"Sunday of the Passion\\") to Dominica I Passionis, \\"First Sunday of the Passion\\" or \\"First Sunday of Passiontide\\". Palm Sunday, formerly Dominica in Palmis (\\"Sunday in Palms\\") became Dominica II Passionis seu in Palmis (\\"II Sunday of the Passion or in Palms\\"). Since the revision of the General Roman Calendar in 1969, the name \\"Passiontide\\" is no longer used for the last two weeks of Lent, although the former usage is somewhat preserved in the formal name for the Sunday before Easter, \\"Palm Sunday of the Lord's Passion\\". However, the Preface called that of the Passion of the Lord I (The Power of the Cross) is used in the fifth week of Lent and the Preface of the Passion of the Lord II (The Victory of the Passion) is used on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of Holy Week. Passiontide is observed in many provinces of the Anglican Communion, for example in the Church of England. In the Common Worship liturgy, material proper to Passiontide is used from Evening Prayer on the Eve of the Fifth Sunday of Lent to the evening of Easter Eve. Such \\"proper material\\" includes prefaces to the Eucharistic Prayer, special orders for Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer, and seasonal material for Night Prayer and Prayer During the Day. Although the Sarum Use used crimson as the liturgical colour for the whole of Passiontide, Common Worship recommends continuing in purple (or Lenten array) throughout the fifth week of Lent, changing to red for Holy Week. ===Passion Week=== Passion Week is a name for the week beginning on Passion Sunday, as the Fifth Sunday of Lent was once called in the Roman Rite. However, even before Pope John XXIII's Code of Rubrics (1960) changed the name of this Sunday from \\"Passion Sunday\\" (Dominica de Passione)Missale Romanum, 1920 typical edition, p. 156 to \\"First Sunday of the Passion\\" (Dominica I Passionis),Missale Romanum 1962, p. 118 the liturgical books gave no special name to this week, referring to the days in it simply as \\"Monday (etc.) after Passion Sunday\\", which in Pope John XXIII's edition of the Roman Missal became \\"Monday (etc.) after the First Sunday of the Passion\\". In Pope John XXIII's revision, not only the Sunday that had previously had the exclusive name of Passion Sunday but also the following Sunday referred in their names to the Passion. The latter became the \\"Second Sunday of the Passion or Palm Sunday\\" (Dominica II Passionis seu in Palmis).Missale Romanum 1962, p. 130 The week beginning on that Sunday continued to have a distinctive name, \\"Holy Week\\" (\\"Hebdomada sancta\\") (previously, \\"Great Week\\", \\"Hebdomada major\\", but referred to in English as Holy Week), and the first days in it were called \\"Monday (etc.) of Holy Week\\", not \\"Monday (etc.) after the Second Sunday of the Passion or Palm Sunday\\". In the 1969 revision, Passiontide ceased to be a separate liturgical season and became the Fifth Week of Lent, followed by Holy Week. Until the introduction of the new Harmony of the Gospel Readings for Holy Week in 1969, English- speaking members of the Moravian Church used the name \\"Passion Week\\" for Holy Week, a week much more closely associated with the Passion of Christ. ==Music for Passiontide== Much music has been written for Passiontide. The Gregorian chant composed for the First Sunday of Passiontide expresses two main themes: the expectation of Easter and the suffering that will be endured on Good Friday. The Introit \\"Iudica Me Domine\\" (Ps. 42 [43]), the Gradual \\"Eripe Me Domine\\" (Ps. 139), and the Tract \\"Saepe Expugnaverunt\\" (Ps. 128) all express the theme of the persecution of the just man. The Offertory on the other hand \\"Confitebor\\" (from Ps. 137 [138]) concentrates on the hope of ultimate victory and vindication. The Communion antiphon \\"Hoc Corpus\\" is taken directly from the Gospels and has a eucharist theme fittingly adapted to the liturgical moment that it accompanies, but it also calls to mind the impending Passover meal, which will serve as the setting for the Last Supper. Passion cantatas have been composed to texts in a variety of languages, taking as their theme the hours or days before the Crucifixion of Christ. Many settings have been made of the Latin poem Stabat Mater, which describes Mary standing in front of the Cross watching her son die (the Feast of the Seven Dolours of the Blessed Virgin is observed on Friday in Passion Week), and the lessons from the Tenebrae service have been set by a variety of composers. Several composers have set to music the seven sayings of Jesus on the cross. Heinrich Schütz composed a cantata, Die sieben Worte Jesu Christi am Kreuz, c. 1645. Joseph Haydn wrote seven string quartets, Die sieben letzten Worte unseres Erlösers am Kreuze (The seven last wods of our Redeemer on the cross) which also appeared in other arrangements. The Seven Last Words from the Cross, a cantata for choir and strings was composed in 1993) by James MacMillan. ==References== Category:Catholic liturgy Category:Lent Category:Holy Week ","title":"Passiontide"},{"id":"2562090","text":"The International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) is an independent, non- profit research organization located in Berkeley, California, United States.

Secker & Warburg) Blott on the Landscape is a novel by Tom Sharpe which was first published in 1975. The book was adapted into a 6-part television series of the same name for BBC television in 1985. ==Plot== The story revolves around the proposed construction of a motorwayM101 in the book and the M399 in the BBC seriesthrough Cleene Gorge in rural South Worfordshirea fictional gorge in a fictional English county. At one end of Cleene Gorge is Handyman Hall; the home of the politician Sir Giles Lynchwood and his wife Lady Maud Lynchwood. Sir Giles is secretly in favour of ensuring that the motorway passes through the Cleene Gorge (and is actually the originator of the plan) as it will mean he will be paid the compensation for the destruction of Handyman Hall, which is under a covenant preventing its sale. While superficially pretending to be supportive he takes steps to undermine the inquiry and prevent alternatives being adopted, to ensure the new road travels through the Gorge. By contrast, Lady Maud's family has lived in the gorge for over 500 years, and she is fiercely defensive of her heritage and expects Giles to support her. Matters are further complicated by their on- going marital problems, including Sir Giles's fetishist infidelity and Lady Maud's wish for children to continue her line (to which Sir Giles is violently opposed); and the actions of Maud's gardener, Blott, a former German prisoner of war who is believed to be Italian. The German Army had become so fed up with Blott that the Nazi High Command decided to get rid of him by assigning him to an Italian bomber on a raid to England. Blott, who had served as navigatorand was not very good at itmade them completely lost and was the only survivor when his plane crashed into a mountain, whereupon he was captured, with his captors believing him to be Italian. Blott is strongly patriotic towards his new home nation and home and fiercely devoted to the Handyman family, Maud in particular. Maud's and Giles's marriage settlement leaves Giles with Handyman Hall in the event of a no-fault divorce but not in the event of death or infidelity, a situation he also seeks to provoke by refusing to co-operate in his marital duties and which Maud sees as a potential solution. With his military training, and some leftovers of the war secretly buried on the estate, Blott begins a covert campaign including blackmail and wire tapping to scrutinize Sir Giles's activities on Maud's behalf and to undermine the construction of the motorway. He also discovers and aims to foil Giles's plans. In the course of the fight for the Gorge, a picturesque nearby village is destroyed by Blott using a demolition crane to whip up popular opposition to the works. Giles is discovered by Lady Maud and Blott in bed bound by his mistress Mrs Forthby and is blackmailed, as is Dundridge, the official in charge of the motorway construction, and the Hall is quickly converted into a wildlife park in an attempt to prevent the removal of its occupants. Giles himself is finally killed by lions when he is discovered by Blott and Maud trying to burn down the Hall. As a final resort, Blott concretes himself into his home, located in the entrance archway to the estate, preventing work progress. Dundridge, frustrated and going rapidly mad with power, demands the SAS are called in to remove Blott. Blott, after repelling their attempts to scale the arch, secretly launches an attack on his own archway for which the SAS is blamed, finally compelling enough public attention to cause the plans to be dropped. Dundridge is imprisoned for his part in the 'attack' and the destruction of the village (in which one person had been accidentally killed), and Maud and Blott (who have fallen in love by this time) marry and state their intention to add to the Handyman family. ==Adaptations== ===1985 TV series=== ===Audio book=== * Blott on the Landscape was released as an audiobook in two formats: abridged by Listen for Pleasure read by George Cole (), and unabridged by Chivers Audio Books read by David Suchet (). ==References== Category:1975 British novels Category:British comedy novels Category:Novels adapted into television shows Category:Novels by Tom Sharpe Category:Secker & Warburg books ","title":"Blott on the Landscape"},{"id":"2562120","text":"The Lurie Tower on North Campus, view from the southwest The Ann and Robert H.

By 1774, he was working in New Haven, Connecticut as a portrait painter. In the autumn of 1774, Earl returned to Leicester, Massachusetts to marry his cousin, Sarah Gates. A few months later, their daughter Phebe was born in January 1775. Earl left them both with Sarah's parents and returned to New Haven to continue painting portraits. Earl's wife and daughter joined him in New Haven in November 1776, and they lived there until May 1777, when their son, John, was born. Sarah later attested that this six-month period \\"was all the time we kept house together.\\" ==Career== Like many of the colonial craftsmen, Earl was self-taught, and for many years was an itinerant painter. In 1775, Earl visited Lexington and Concord, which were the sites of recent battles in the American Revolution. Although his father was a colonel in the Revolutionary army, Earl himself was a Loyalist.www.worcesterart.org Working in collaboration with the engraver Amos Doolittle, Earl drew four battle scenes that were made into pro-Revolutionary propaganda prints. {- 150px 150px 150px 150px } In 1778, he left behind his wife and daughter and escaped to England by disguising himself as the servant of British army captain John Money. In London, he entered the studio of Benjamin West, and painted the king and many notables. Earl continued painting portraits in the town of Norwich. He later married Ann Whiteside, an English woman, despite the fact that he had never ended his marriage with Sarah Gates. In 1785 or 1786, Earl returned to the United States with his new wife. ===Return to America=== After his return to America, he made portraits of Timothy Dwight, Governor Caleb Strong, Roger Sherman, and other prominent men. He also painted a large picture of Niagara Falls. In September 1786, while living in New York City, Earl was imprisoned for failing to pay his personal debts. Even while in jail, he drew portraits of his visitors, friends, and family of the Society for the Relief of Distressed Debtors. He was released in January 1788. ==Personal life== Earl probably trained his son, painter Ralph Eleaser Whiteside Earl, and was an influence on his nephew Augustus Earle who is reputed to have been the first European artist to have visited all five continents. Ralph's brother James Earl (1761–1796) was also a portrait painter. He died in Bolton, Connecticut, on August 16, 1801.

The dish employs a technique known as smothering, a popular method of cooking in the Cajun and Creole areas of southwest Louisiana. Étouffée is most popular in New Orleans and in the Acadiana area of the southernmost half of Louisiana as well as the coastal counties of Mississippi, Alabama, northern Florida, and eastern Texas. ==Etymology== In French, the word \\"étouffée\\" (borrowed into English as \\"stuffed\\" or \\"stifled\\") literally means \\"smothered\\" or \\"suffocated\\", from the verb \\"étouffer\\".Louisianaliving.com ==Description== Another version of crawfish étouffée Étouffée is a dish of seafood or chicken simmered in a sauce made from a light or blond roux. It is most commonly made with shellfish, such as crab or shrimp. The most popular version of the dish is made with crawfish (or \\"crayfish\\"). Étouffée is typically served over rice. Depending on who is making it and where it is being made it is flavored with either Creole or Cajun seasonings. Although Creole and Cajun cuisines are distinct, there are many similarities.Louisianafishfry.com In the case of the Creole version of crawfish étouffée, it is made with a blonde or brown roux and sometimes tomatoes are added. A blond roux is one that is cooked, stirring constantly, for approximately 5 minutes to remove the \\"raw\\" flavor of the flour and to add a slightly \\"nutty\\" flavor, while a brown roux is cooked longer (30 to 35 minutes) in order to deepen the color and flavor. ==History== Around the 1950s, crawfish étouffée was introduced to restaurant goers in Breaux Bridge, Louisiana; however, the dish may have been invented as early as the late 1920s, according to some sources. Originally, crawfish étouffée was a popular dish amongst Cajuns in the bayous and backwaters of Louisiana. Around 1983, a waiter at the popular Bourbon Street restaurant Galatoire's brought the dish to his boss to try. At the time, most New Orleans restaurants served French Creole cuisine, but this Cajun dish was a hit.Cason, Colleen (February 13, 2009). \\"From Swamp to Swank: Flavor Elevates Crawfish Étouffée\\", Ventura County Star.

His parents were of Scots-Irish ancestry. He worked as a piano accompanist for ballroom dancers before going to work as a musical conductor on Broadway. He went to Hollywood in 1932 along with his protégée Ethel Merman, writing and arranging her material for her films at Paramount. In 1935, he joined MGM as a musical supervisor and occasional composer and arranger, notably of music for Judy Garland. He also appeared on screen opposite Eleanor Powell in a cameo in Broadway Melody of 1936. Arthur Freed, producer of musicals at MGM, was impressed by Edens and soon made him integral to his production team, which was rapidly growing and featured many of the greatest talents, recruited by Freed himself. Freed built a cabinet around himself, and in the early 1940s made Edens associate producer. The unit made dozens of popular and extremely successful musical films in the 1940s and into the 1950s, including Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), Easter Parade (1948), On the Town (1949), Show Boat (1951), An American in Paris (1951), Singin' in the Rain (1952), and The Band Wagon (1953). Edens eventually separated from the MGM unit in the mid-1950s when the musical film's days of glory were coming to an end. He had his own office and worked on such projects as Funny Face (1957) with Audrey Hepburn, Fred Astaire, and Kay Thompson at Paramount. Edens is considered to be an important creative musical figure from the end of the 1930s until the beginning of the 1960s. His career at MGM allowed him to work with the top musical performers including Judy Garland, of whom he was the original trainer and overseer and a lifelong friend. He wrote special material for Garland, including the famous \\"Dear Mr Gable - You Made Me Love You\\" (1937), \\"Our Love Affair\\" (1940) for Strike up the Band - which received an Oscar nomination for best song of that year - and the music for the \\"Born in a Trunk\\" sequence in A Star Is Born (1954).Leonard Gershe received sole credit due to a contractual issue. Personal letter from Gershe to Jim Johnson Edens was responsible for writing \\"It's a Great Day for the Irish\\" to showcase Garland's powerhouse voice in 1940; she sang it in the film Little Nellie Kelly (1940). This became one of Garland's biggest hits and an Irish-American anthem played by military and marching bands every St. Patrick's Day the world over. He continued to compose, score, and arrange MGM musicals throughout the 1940s. He also produced a number of films after the mid-1950s and wrote special material for Garland's Palace Theatre debut in 1951 and for her London Palladium concerts the same year. ==Birthday parties== Edens and Kay Thompson had the same birthday (November 9). From 1942 through 1957 they gave joint birthday parties during which each presented a surprise production number using special material which featured their friends— Judy Garland, Lena Horne, Gene Kelly, Dorothy Dandridge, Maureen O'Hara, Ray Bolger, Ann Sothern, Phil Silvers, Danny Kaye, Charles Walters, Cole Porter, Hugh Martin, and Ralph Blane among others—each never telling the other while rehearsing what the other was planning to present. ==Show Boat== It was Edens, along with producer Arthur Freed, who was the real guiding force behind M-G-M's 1951 screen version of Show Boat. Edens headed the search for the right singer-actor to play Joe, the key supporting character who sings \\"Ol' Man River\\", and he discovered William Warfield after reading a rave review of his performance in a New York song recital. Edens also supervised cuts to the film after it was felt by the producer and director that the original cut was too slow. ==Personal life== Before moving to California, Edens had been married to Martha LaPrelle, but they spent much time apart and eventually divorced. By the time he knew Judy Garland, he was living as a gay man. In the latter part of his life, Edens was in long-term relationship with screenwriter and playwright Leonard Gershe. (Leonard Gershe denied he and Edens were ever lovers though he admitted many people assumed they were. Gershe said, \\"We weren't lovers because I didn't have enough closet space.\\") Edens died of cancer in Los Angeles, California on July 13, 1970. ==Awards and honors== *Academy Award for Best Score (nominated) 1939: Babes in Arms (film) (w.

Sürücü had divorced the cousin she was forced to marry at the age of 16, and was reportedly dating a German man. Her murder inflamed a public debate over forced marriage in Muslim families. Sürücü was sent to her ancestral village by her family and forced to marry a cousin there at the age of 16. She gave birth to a son, Can, in 1999. In October 1999, she fled her parents' home in Berlin, finding refuge in a home for underage mothers. She attended school, and had moved into her own apartment in the Tempelhof neighborhood of Berlin. At the time of her murder, she was at the end of her training to become an electrician. ==Murder== On February 7, 2005, at a bus stop near her apartment, Sürücü was killed by three gunshots to the head. The police arrested three of her brothers on February 14. After several weeks of news coverage, the media began to label the murder as an honor killing, since Sürücü had received threats and reported them to police before she was killed. ==Prosecution== In July 2005, the Berlin Public Prosecutor's office charged Sürücü's brothers with her murder. On September 14, 2005, Ayhan Sürücü, the youngest brother, confessed to murdering his sister. In April 2006, Ayhan was sentenced to nine years and three months in prison, and his two older brothers were acquitted of charges of conspiring to murder their sister. The prosecution appealed on a point of law at the Federal Court of Justice, the Bundesgerichtshof, immediately and the 5th criminal division of the Federal Court of Justice overturned the conviction and allowed the revision. A new criminal proceeding was to take place in August 2008.Pressemitteilung des Bundesgerichtshofs Nr. 117/07. August 28, 2007.\\"Sürücü-Mord kommt wieder vor Gericht\\". After complete serving his sentence, Ayhan Sürücü was released from prison on July 4, 2014, deported from Germany and immediately brought to Turkey. ==Public outrage== Hatun Sürücü's grave in Berlin-Gatow Sürücü's murder was the sixth incident of \\"honor\\" killing since October, 2004. On February 22, 2005, a vigil called by the Berlin Gay and Lesbian association was held at the scene of the crime, which was attended by about 100 Germans and Turks together. A second vigil, called for by German politicians and artists, was held on February 24. Sürücü's murder, and several similar cases in Germany and elsewhere in Europe have been cited by political opponents of Turkey's admission to the European Union, as an example of disregard for human rights in the Turkish culture. Oddly though Hatun Sürücü was of Kurdish descent. The Sürücü family's behaviour again sparked public outrage when Hatun's sister Arzu applied for custody of Hatun's six-year-old son Can, who has been living with a foster family in Berlin since the murder of his mother.Cleaver, Hannah (April 19, 2006). \\"Anger as 'honour killing' family try to adopt victim's son\\". Telegraph (UK). Eight months later the district court of Berlin-Tempelhof rejected the request.\\"Kein Sorgerecht für Sürücüs\\". n-tv.de. December 20, 2006. Arzu Sürücü appealed this decision but the appeal was rejected.\\"Sorgerechts-Gezerre um Hatun Sürücüs Sohn\\". Spiegel Online. February 5, 2007. The public continues to demonstrate for Hatun on the anniversary of her death. Activists and citizens lay wreaths in her memory and campaign for help for girls who are faced with forced marriage and honor-related violence. Giyasettin Sayan, a Kurdish politician, complained that no Kurdish representatives were invited in demonstrations after Sürücüs murder, saying, \\"we are all from Turkey, but we are not all Turks.\\" ==Legacy== A bridge in Neukölln, Berlin was named after the victim. A Regular Woman, a film, was made about the crime. ==See also== Honor killings in Germany: * Morsal Obeidi Honor killings of people with Kurdish heritage: * Pela Atroshi (Iraqi Kurdistan) * Banaz Mahmod (United Kingdom) * Fadime Şahindal (Sweden) Honor killings of Turkish people in Turkey: * Murder of Ahmet Yıldız ==References== ==External links== *\\"'Honour killing' shocks Germany\\".

They were bakufu officials ranking somewhat lower than the bugyō. The metsuke were charged with the special duty of detecting and investigating instances of maladministration, corruption or disaffection anywhere in Japan; and particularly amongst the populace having status below the daimyō.Beasley, William G. (1955). Select Documents on Japanese Foreign Policy, 1853–1868, p. 326. ==Intelligence gathering== The shogunate recognized the need for some kind of internal intelligence-gathering apparatus and for some degree of covert espionage within its own ranks. It could be said that the metsuke functioned as the Shogun's intelligence agency or as internal spies, reporting to the officials in Edo on events and situations across the country.Cunningham, Don. (2004). Taiho-jutsu: Law and Order in the Age of the Samurai, p. 39. The metsuke were charged with focusing on those ranking below daimyō-status; and their counterparts, the ōmetsuke, were responsible for supervising the activities of officials and members of the daimyō (feudal lords). Although similarly engaged, the reporting protocols of the metsuke and ōmetsuke differed. The metsuke reported to wakadoshiyori who ranked just below the rōjū. The ōmetsuke reported directly to the four or five rōjū at the top of the shogunate bureaucracy. By design, the intelligence-gathering activities of the metsuke was intended to complement those of the ōmetsuke even though there was no official reporting relationship between the two somewhat independent groups. There were at any given time as many as twenty-four metsuke. ==Ad hoc evolution== The bureaucracy of the Tokugawa shogunate expanded on an ad hoc basis, responding to perceived needs and changing circumstances. Sometimes one or more of the metsuke or ōmetsuke would have been selected to address a specific or even a unique problem. For example, Arao Norimasa in the period from 1852 through 1854 was charged with special duties as kaibo-gakari-metsuke.Beasley, p. 341. The prefix kaibō-gakari meaning \\"in charge of maritime defense\\" was used with the titles of some bakufu officials after 1845. This term was used to designate those who bore a special responsibility for overseeing coastal waters, and by implication, for dealing with matters involving foreigners. \\"Kaibō-gakari-metsuke\\" later came to be superseded by the term gaikoku-gakari.Beasley, p. 323. These developments preceded the Gaikoku bugyō system which began just prior to the negotiations which resulted in the Harris Treaty.Cullin, L.M. (2003). A History of Japan, 1582-1941, p. 185. First appointed in August 1858, the gaikoku-bugyō were bakufu officials who were charged with advising the government on foreign affairs and who were tasked with conducting negotiations with foreign diplomats both in Japan and abroad. ==In popular culture== The post of metsuke was, of course, not immune to corruption; and sometimes the conduct of these officials could be affected by bribes. For example, the televised jidaigeki episodes of Abarenbō Shōgun are rife with petty corruption, including a broad range of officials across the span of television seasons. Metsuke also appear as persecutors of Japanese Christians in the film Silence (2016).http://www.periodistadigital.com/guiacultural/ocio-y- cultura/2017/01/08/silencio-de-martin-scorsese-cine.shtml Metsuke are also portrayed by the game Total War: Shogun 2 as agents who try and imprison members of an enemy clan, as well as looking over settlements if needed. ==List of metsuke== * Matsudaira Chikano (1841–1844)Beasley, p. 335. * Ido Staohiro (1842–1845)Beasley, p. 332. * Arao Narimasa (1852–1854)Beasley, p. 331. * Nagai Naomune (1853–1858)Beasley, p. 338. * Iwase Tadanari (1854–1858)Beasley, p. 333. * Oguri Tadamasa (1859–1860) * Ikeda Nagaaki (1862–1863, 1863) * Kawada Hiroshi (1864)Beasley, p. 334. * Kurimoto Sebei (1864–1865) ==Notes== ==References== * Beasley, William G.

Dwight Theodore William Dwight (1822–1892), American jurist and educator, cousin of Theodore Dwight Woolsey and of Timothy Dwight V, was born July 18, 1822 in Catskill, New York. His father was Benjamin Woolsey Dwight (1780–1850), a physician and merchant, and his grandfather was Timothy Dwight IV (1752–1817), a prominent theologian, educator, author, and president of Yale University from 1795-1817. Theodore Dwight graduated from Hamilton College in 1840 where he studied physics under Samuel F.B. Morse and John William Draper. Dwight taught the classics at Utica Academy in 1840–1841. He studied law at Yale and was admitted to the bar in 1845. Between 1842-1858, he taught at Hamilton, first as tutor and later as professor of law, history, civil polity, and political economy. In 1853 he became dean of the Hamilton Law School. In 1858, he accepted an invitation to develop a department of law at Columbia. He was the sole professor of law at Columbia until the department was expanded in 1873, eventually becoming Columbia Law School. He served as the dean at Columbia Law School until 1891. That year, he and other faculty, students, and alumni protested the Columbia trustees’ attempts to convert the law school to the case method, and left to found New York Law School. At Columbia, Dwight was the creator of the Dwight method of legal instruction, which emphasized memorization of treatises, practice drills, and frequent moot courts. The Dwight method was in competition with the case method developed by Christopher Columbus Langdell, then Dean of Harvard, which emphasized the study of individual cases, and inductive reasoning. As described by Columbia Professor Peter Strauss, \\"Where Dwight aimed to give a sound knowledge of the law to men of average ability, Harvard's case method aimed to give as much intellectual stimulation as possible to those who would become the profession's elite.\\" Today, the more abstract case method dominates legal education, even at New York Law School. However, the Dwight method, while not described as such, is still used in some law schools. Dwight-like memorization techniques are also widely used to prepare for state bar exams. Dwight was also a prominent figure in political and social reforms. In 1873, Governor John Dix appointed Dwight a member of the commission of appeals, which in 1874–1875 aided the New York Court of Appeals to clear its docket. In 1886, he served as counsel for five Andover Theological Seminary professors charged with heresy. Dwight was particularly interested in prison reform; he collaborated on A Report on Prisons and Reformatories in the United States and Canada (1867), served as president of the New York Prison Association, and was a delegate to the International Prison Congress at Stockholm in 1878. He helped draw up the bill for the establishment of the Elmira Reformatory and wrote an early report that helped lead to the organization the State Charities Aid Association. Dwight edited Sir Henry Maine's Ancient Law;The first American edition was published in 1864 with an introduction by Theodore William Dwight. See was associate editor of the American Law Register and legal editor of Johnson's Cyclopaedia; and published Charitable Uses: Argument in the Rose Will Case (1863). He was a non-resident professor of law at Cornell (1869–1871) and at Amherst (1870–1872). Dwight died in Clinton, New York, on June 18, 1892. He died while in the act of signing his will. Because he had not finished writing his signature by the time he died, the will was not enforced.Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers § 3.3 rptr. n. 2 (1998). ==References== Category:1822 births Category:1892 deaths Category:Hamilton College (New York) alumni Category:Yale University alumni Category:Hamilton College (New York) faculty Category:Deans of Columbia Law School Category:Law school deans Category:Woolsey family ","title":"Theodore William Dwight"},{"id":"2562248","text":"Gerry Hutch (born 1963) is an Irish criminal. He was the prime suspect for two of the biggest armed robberies in Irish history. Known for leading a \\"disciplined, ascetic lifestyle\\" since leaving prison in 1985, he was christened \\"The Monk\\" by Veronica Guerin, an investigative journalist who was assassinated in 1996. == Early life== Born in central Dublin, his criminal career began at the age of 10. At some point in the 1970s, Hutch joined the Bugsy Malone Gang of inner city youngsters (named for the Bugsy Malone film), which he later led, and whose crimes included \\"jump-overs\\" - jumping over bank counters, grabbing cash and running. He was later part of a gang involved in major robberies and received many convictions between 1970 and 1983 intermittently spending time in prison. His gang was said to have amassed an estimated IR£40 million from a series of bank robberies, jewellery heists, and fraud scams spanning almost eight years. Hutch has also been awarded money from legal actions in Irish courts. These included £8,500 won from Securicor Ireland in June 1991, £2,000 from the Sunday Tribune newspaper in a libel action and around £26,000 won in legal actions against the Irish state. Hutch admitted to being a \\"convicted criminal\\" in a 2008 interview with The Independent, but insisted that he made his money through property deals, not crime. == Corinthians Boxing Club == In 1998 he was a founding member of the Corinthians Boxing Club in Dublin and has served as treasurer for the club. The club has a full gym and a boxing ring. The latter was donated by film director Jim Sheridan after making the film The Boxer. == Criminal Assets Bureau == In 1999, in the course of court proceedings brought against Hutch by the Irish state's anti-money laundering agency, the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB), Detective Chief Superintendent Felix McKenna stated that Hutch had been involved in the IR£1.7 million robbery of an armoured van at Marino Mart in January 1987 and the £3 million armed robbery of a Brinks Allied Security Depot in Clonshaugh, County Dublin, in 1995, which had been the largest cash robbery in the State at the time. Hutch eventually reached an £1.2m settlement with the CAB to \\"cover back taxes and interest for a nine-year period\\". == Carry Any Body == After the CAB settlement, Hutch applied for and was granted a taxi licence, and set up the limousine service Carry Any Body. The name is a humorous reference to the Criminal Assets Bureau. He has featured in the Irish media as he has driven celebrities including Mike Tyson on their visits to Ireland. ==Film and television== Hutch is depicted in the film Veronica Guerin, played by Alan Devine. It is based on the life of the late Irish journalist Veronica Guerin who had interviewed him. Hutch appeared on RTÉ's Prime Time programme in March 2008 where he was interviewed about his life and criminal career. Hutch denied any criminal activity, since his last prison sentence, other than tax evasion. Hutch was the subject of investigation in the Irish TV3 channel's television series, Dirty Money. Episode 5, which aired March 2008 was solely devoted to the assets seized by the CAB from Hutch and the threat to seize assets from his family. ==Family== He is an uncle of Gary Hutch, who was shot dead in September 2015 near Marbella, Andalusia, Spain.

The name means \\"a place where crows gather\\", deriving from the word corbîn meaning crow. However, seagulls have long since displaced the crows from their coastal nesting sites. La Corbière from the west The rocks and extreme tidal variation around this stretch of Jersey's coast have been treacherous for navigation and La Corbière has been the scene of many shipwrecks, including that of the mail packet \\"Express\\" on 20 September 1859. ==Monument== Sited on the headland overlooking the lighthouse is a monument sculpted by Derek Tristram and erected in April 1997, to commemorate a rescue that took place. The accompanying plaque describes the event: :\\"During the morning of Monday April 17th 1995 whilst on passage from Jersey to Sark, the French catamaran \\"Saint-Malo\\" struck a rock known as La Frouquie, 900 metres north of La Corbière Lighthouse. Visibility was good at the time, but with a spring tide ebbing to the west and a westerly Force 5 wind, the sea conditions near Corbière were moderate to rough.\\" Saint-Malo sculpture commemorating a maritime rescue in 1995 :\\"Emergency services responded promptly and nearby ships gave assistance. All 307 passengers and crew were saved from the partially submerged vessel.\\" :\\"This memorial is erected in thanksgiving and as a tribute to the rescue, which with the help of God and of many strong arms, ensured the safe return of all on board.\\" La Corbière was formerly the western terminus of the Jersey Railway line from Saint Helier. The first through train ran from Saint Helier to La Corbière on 5 August 1885. The service was unable to compete against motor buses and the railway closed in 1935. The States of Jersey purchased the railway track on 1 April 1937, and created a trail now known as the Railway Walk, linking La Corbière and Saint Aubin for pedestrians and cyclists. During the German military occupation 1940-45, the Germans re- established light railways for the purpose of supplying coastal fortifications. A one-metre gauge line was laid down following the route of the former Jersey Railway from Saint Helier to La Corbière, with a branch line connecting the stone quarry at Ronez in Saint John.Cruickshank, Charles G. (1975) The German Occupation of the Channel Islands, The Guernsey Press, The German railway infrastructure was dismantled after the Liberation in 1945, but other German fortifications remain, besides the communications tower, and can be seen around the headland. The former railway platform can still be seen at the end of the Railway Walk at La Corbière and just opposite on the other side of the trail is La Table des Marthes, a megalith. The table-like stone was used historically as a meeting place for the witnessing of contracts and it is conjectured that the name is a corruption of la table des martyres (\\"martyr\\" being intended in its meaning of \\"witness\\"). Other theories have been put forward to explain the name and purpose of this stone. ==Lighthouse== The lighthouse is situated on a rock that is a tidal island. A causeway links the lighthouse to shore at low tide. There is an alarm to warn visitors to clear the causeway as the tide rises; still, there have been casualties among the unwary or unlucky. A plaque adjacent to the causeway commemorates Peter Edwin Larbalestier, assistant keeper of the lighthouse, who was drowned on 28 May 1946, while trying to rescue a visitor cut off by the incoming tide. The lighthouse tower is 19 m (62 ft) high and the lamp stands 36 m (119 ft) above high water spring tides. It was lit on 24 April 1874, for the first time, and was the first lighthouse in the British Isles to be built of concrete. The lighthouse was built to designs by Sir John Coode. The beam has a reach of , and was automated in 1976. The lighthouse at La Corbière is one of the most photographed landmarks in Jersey and is a popular tourist site for its panoramic views. In the evenings the surrounding area provides an ideal viewing point for sunsets. ;Numismatics The lighthouse at La Corbière features on the Jersey 5 pound note (see Jersey pound) and the Jersey 20 pence piece (see coins of the Jersey pound) ==Culture== The prominence of La Corbière, especially for travellers by sea for whom rounding the rocky waters around the headland often means the roughest part of the journey from Guernsey or England but also the consolation that the boat is entering the final straight towards the harbour of St. Helier, has led to several proverbial expressions in Jèrriais: * j'avons pâssé La Corbiéthe (we've passed La Corbière, i.e. the worst is over) * il a pâssé hardi dg'ieau l'tou d'La Corbiéthe (a lot of water has passed round La Corbière, i.e. that's water under the bridge) ==MP2 tower== At the top of the headland is a range-finding tower that the German occupying forces built during the Second World War. At that time they camouflaged it with paint to give it an appearance similar to an 18th-century granite round tower. The tower has 7 floors, including the top floor, which was an originally the flat roof. The top floor is now enclosed with a new roof and glazing. It provides a 360° view out over Jersey's south-west tip. In 1976 the States' Harbours and Ports Committee added a glassed-in control room where a duty officer could monitor the radio communications of vessels in the English Channel.Jersey Forts and Towers, p.66 This lasted until 2004. Since then, Jersey Heritage has turned it into a self-catering accommodation with full facilities that one may rent as holiday accommodation. This is the only German tower in the Channel Islands that is now a self-catering apartment. ==See also== *List of lighthouses in the Channel Islands ==References== ;Notes * A Chronology of Jersey, Mollet, Jersey 1954 * Dictionnaire Jersiais- Français, Le Maistre, Jersey 1966 == Gallery == File:LaCorbiere.jpgLa Corbière Lighthouse, with a storm approaching.

Successively the pupil of Portaels and Jean-Léon Gérôme, he produced in 1868 The Battle of Hastings: the Finding of the body of Harold by Edith. ==Biography== Wauters made a journey to Italy, but that the study of the old masters in no way affected his individuality was proved by The Great Nave of St. Marks (purchased by Leopold II of Belgium). As his youth disqualified him for the medal of the Brussels Salon, which otherwise would have been his, he was sent, by way of compensation, by the minister of fine arts, as artist- delegate to Suez for the opening of the canal, a visit that was fruitful later on. In 1870, when he was yet only twenty-two years of age, Wauters exhibited his great historical picture of Mary of Burgundy entreating the Sheriffs of Ghent to pardon the Councillors Hugonet and Humbercourt (Liege Museum) which created a veritable furore, an impression which was confirmed the following year at the London International Exhibition. It was eclipsed by the celebrated Madness of Hugo van der Goes (1872, Brussels Museum), a picture which led to the commission for the two large works decorating the Lions staircase of the Hotel de Ville Mary of Burgundy swearing to respect the Communal Rights of Brussels, 1477 and The Armed Citizens of Brussels demanding the Charta from Duke John IV, Duke of Brabant. His other large compositions comprise Sobieski and his Staff before Besieged Vienna (Brussels Museum) and the Harvest of a journey to Spain and Tangiers, The Great Mosque, and Serpent Charmers of Sokko, and a souvenir of his Egyptian travel, Cairo, from the Bridge of Kasr- el-Nil (Antwerp Museum). His vast panorama probably the noblest and most artistic work of this class ever produced Cairo and the Banks of the Nile (1881), 380 ft. by 49 ft., executed in six months, was exhibited with extraordinary success in Brussels, Munich, and the Hague. == Oeuvre == Wauters is equally eminent as a portraitist, in his earliest period exhibiting, as in his pictures, sober qualities and subtle grip, but later on developing into the whole range of a brilliant, forceful palette, and then into brighter and more delicate colors, encouraged thereto, in his more recent work, by his adoption of pastel as a medium even for life-size portraits, mainly of ladies. His portraits, numbering over two hundred, include many of the greatest names in Belgium, France, and America (Wauters having for some years made Paris his chief home). Among these may be named the Baron Goffinet, the Baroness Goffinet, Madame Somze (standing at a piano), Master Somze (on horseback by the sea-shore), the Princess Clementine of Belgium (Brussels Museum), Lady Edward Sassoon, Baron de Bleichroder, Princess de Ligne, Miss Lorillard, a likeness of the artist in the Dresden Museum, and M. Schollaert (president of the Chamber of Deputies) the last named an amazing example of portraiture, instinct with character and vitality. The vigour of his male, and the grace and elegance of his female, portraits are unsurpassable, the resemblance perfect and the technical execution such as to place the artist in the front rank. == Prizes == Between 1889 and 1900 the painter contributed to the Royal Academy of London. Few artists have received such a succession of noteworthy distinctions and recognitions. His Hugo van der Goes, the work of a youth of twenty-four, secured the Grand Medal of the Salon. He has been awarded no fewer than six medals of honor at Paris in 1878 and 1889; Munich, 1879; Antwerp, 1885; Vienna, 1888; and Berlin, 1883. == Honours == * 1887: Commander in the Order of LeopoldHandelsblad (Het) 17-02-1887 * 1924: Grand Cross in the Order of the CrownRD 21.37.1924 * Commander in the Order of Saint Michael * Officer in the Legion of Honour * Order of Merit of Prussia * Knight in the Order of Franz JosephAlmanach royal officiel: 1875; p. 62 * Member of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium He was an honorary member of the Vienna, Berlin, and Munich academies, and corresponding member of the Institut de France and of that of Madrid. ==References== ==Sources== * P. & V.

Having taken the arts curriculum at the University of Glasgow, he studied for the ministry at the Divinity Hall of the United Secession Church, a dissenting body which, on its union a few years later with the Relief Church, adopted the title United Presbyterian. In 1843 Eadie was appointed professor of biblical literature and hermeneutics in the Divinity Hall of the United Presbyterian body. He held this appointment along with his ministerial charge till the close of his life. He received the degree of LL.D from Glasgow in 1844, and that of D.D. from St Andrews in 1850. He died at Glasgow on 3 June 1876. His library was bought and presented to the United Presbyterian College. ==Ministry== In 1835 he became minister of the Cambridge Street Secession church in Glasgow, and for many years he was generally regarded as the leading representative of his denomination in Glasgow. As a preacher, though he was not eloquent, he was distinguished by good sense, earnestness and breadth of sympathy. In 1863 he removed with a portion of his congregation to the new Lansdowne United Presbyterian Church, which became a notable landmark at Kelvinbridge.

The magnetization that occurs below is a famous example of the \\"spontaneous\\" breaking of a global symmetry, a phenomenon that is described by Goldstone's theorem. The term \\"symmetry breaking\\" refers to the choice of a magnetization direction by the spins, which have spherical symmetry above , but a preferred axis (the magnetization direction) below . ==Temperature dependence== To a first order approximation, the temperature dependence of spontaneous magnetization at low temperatures is given by Bloch's law: :M(T) = M(0)\\\\left(1-(T/T_c\\\\right)^{3/2}), where is the spontaneous magnetization at absolute zero. The decrease in spontaneous magnetization at higher temperatures is caused by the increasing excitation of spin waves. In a particle description, the spin waves correspond to magnons, which are the massless Goldstone bosons corresponding to the broken symmetry. This is exactly true for an isotropic magnet. Magnetic anisotropy, that is the existence of an easy direction along which the moments align spontaneously in the crystal, corresponds however to \\"massive\\" magnons. This is a way of saying that they cost a minimum amount of energy to excite, hence they are very unlikely to be excited as T\\\\rightarrow 0. Hence the magnetization of an anisotropic magnet is harder to destroy at low temperature and the temperature dependence of the magnetization deviates accordingly from the Bloch's law. All real magnets are anisotropic to some extent. Near the Curie temperature, :M(T) \\\\propto \\\\left(T_c-T\\\\right)^\\\\beta, where is a critical exponent that depends on the universality class of the magnetic interaction.

It gives a fictionalized account of his journey to Ireland in 1953-1954 to write a screen adaptation of the novel Moby-Dick with director John Huston. Bradbury has said he wrote it after reading actress Katharine Hepburn's account of filming The African Queen with Huston in Africa. The title itself is a play on Peter Viertel's novel White Hunter, Black Heart, which is also about Huston. Bradbury considers Green Shadows to be the culmination of thirty-five years of short stories, poems, and plays that were inspired by his stay in Ireland. As with most of his previous short-story collections, including The Illustrated Man and The Martian Chronicles, many of the short stories were originally published elsewhere and modified slightly for publication in the novel. ==Plot summary== The narrator, an unnamed writer, is sent to Dublin, Ireland to coproduce a film adaptation of Moby Dick with a director whose first name is given as \\"John\\". While there, he hears of the many strange and surreal stories of the boyos in Finn's pub that make up the bulk of the novel, along with other adventures in the land of Ireland, including a \\"hunt wedding\\" and a house that has a mind of its own. The last chapter of the novel is devoted to the successful completion of the screenplay and the narrator's resulting ascent to fame. ==Plot== The narrator arrives in Ireland by ferry. In his conversation with the customs inspector, his identity as a screenplay writer working on Moby Dick is introduced. They also discuss the peculiarities of the Irish. The narrator checks in at the Royal Hibernian Hotel in Dublin before leaving in a taxi for Kilcock. The taxi breaks down, and, after some resistance on his part, the narrator rides off on a bicycle given to him by the taxi driver. The narrator meets another bicyclist who tells him more of Ireland and its people. They proceed to Heeber Finn's pub, where the bicyclist is greeted as Mike, and the rest of the pub patrons are introduced. An injured man stumbles into the pub and informs those inside of a collision on the road. The collision turns out to be that of two bicyclists. The narrator learns that these are common as bicyclists travel at high speeds through the fog. One of the victims is taken to a local clinic in the only car present, and the narrator rides off on the wrong side of the road, as advised. The narrator meets with his director, John. They sit down to dinner with John's wife, Ricki, and John tells a story about his and his wife's trip to Spain, calling Ricki a coward, which upsets her. The narrator then flashes back to when he was buying his travel copy of Moby Dick. A woman warned him not to go to Ireland because the director is a monster. The narrator works for weeks on what he refers to as \\"the Whale\\" through the rain in Ireland. One night, Finn takes the narrator and Mike on a wild drive to bet on dog races. The narrator returns to his hotel and bed. The narrator buys a hunting outfit at Tyson's and goes to show it to John. John \\"hypnotizes\\" the narrator, who he calls H.G. for H.G. Wells, and the narrator says he wants to write \\"the... finest screenplay in the history of the world.\\" John's friend Tom calls from New York City, and John asks him and his fiancée, Lisa, to come to Ireland and have a \\"hunt wedding.\\" Tom and Lisa disembark from the plane fighting, which amuses John. More is told about Tom and John, and the planning of the hunt wedding is begun. They finally find a reverend that will marry the two non-Catholics, Reverend Hicks, a Unitarian. The minister finds that the couple fights a lot, and they go to meet with him about it and fight the whole time. He says it is not a marriage but a \\"rematch,\\" and the narrator convinces him to marry the two anyway. John falls off a horse while interviewing actors for the film and is considerably injured. On hunter's wife is heard to have died from falling off her horse, which causes the wedding to be delayed and considerably affects Tom. John arrives back in Ireland on crutches. He tells of his fall and goes home to Ricki, who finally finds out about his injuries. Tom, Lisa, John, and the narrator go out to dinner, where John tells Tom and Lisa that the screaming of the chef in the kitchen while the doors swing open sounds like Tom their fighting, which surprises them. Mike and the narrator go to pick up the minister, and Mike talks about Ireland during the trip. The day of the hunt wedding follows, and Lisa has a bad cold. The minister, after waiting for Ricki to get a Bible, enters a long sermon about sin. The cake is served and found to be rock hard after the week of delay. Tom then asks the minister about the legitimacy of the marriage, who then pronounces them man and wife. Tom rides off to the hunt, but John is detained by his injuries. Lisa then asks the minister about the legality of the marriage, and he gives her papers to sign. The narrator awakes back at his hotel and Ricki calls. She tells him of the proceedings after the wedding, and Tom is nowhere to be found. John gives Ricki a horse as a Christmas present. She rides off but falls, and John orders her back onto the horse. The narrator works on his novel and then decides to go to Finn's. Finn tells a story of the fathers of the men in the pub. They go to burn down the house of Lord Kilgotten, who instead invites them in. They decide to wait until the next night to burn the house. Lord Kilgotten then takes them through his house, showing them all of his paintings, and they all volunteer to save the paintings between them before the fire. Later, however, they all return with the paintings after meeting different problems in taking possession of the works of art. Lord Kilgotten has them put all of the paintings back in his house, with the exception of a portrait of him by Lady Kilgotten which he told them not to save in the first place. The narrator talks to John about how he can't help but give to the beggars outside and had been afraid to go out. John tries to give him advice and leads the way, but the narrator breaks down and gives to the beggars. They then proceed to O'Connell Bridge, where there is a beggar that the narrator thinks is blind, and who makes him both angry and compassionate. He is the only man without a cap and plays his concertina and sings beautifully. John is about to give him money, but the narrator stops him. The narrator then goes to buy the man a cap, deciding it's not just a ruse to evoke sympathy. He returns to find only a man and a woman on the bridge making horrible noise with a piano box on the bridge. John narrator find out from the paper that the man jumped off the bridge. John talks about the beggars and why they are in the position to beg, and the narrator goes out and gives the cap and all of the money he has with him to the first beggars that he sees. The narrator briefly speaks with Finn about figuring out the Irish. Nora, a friend of the narrator, calls, and invites him to her place, which is called Grynwood. Once there, she explains to him that the house burned down four years before. She had rebuilt an exact copy, but found that nothing was the same. When she invited all of the guests for the first party, the atmosphere was very empty and quiet, and all of the guests left. She tells him that she and her friends were old evil, and with the house new and innocent, it didn't want them there anymore. She offers the house to the narrator, but he also finds that the house gives subtle hints that it doesn't want him there. They go back to Dublin together, and the narrator finds her gone in the morning. The narrator returns to Finn's and talks with him shortly, primarily about John and the many people that have taken riding lessons and ended up injured. The narrator tells John that he won't be taking any more riding lessons. News comes to the pub that Lord Kilgotten has died. Everyone wonders what will become of his extensive wine collection, and this is answered at his funeral. In the wake come his coffin, made out of wine crates, and a lawyer, who reads Lord Kilgotten's will. In it he states that the residents of the town would not appreciate the value of the wine, and that he wants to have it all poured into the grave before he is buried. The men from the pub could not let all of the wine be wasted, and, after Finn's suggestion, they decide to drink the wine and relieve themselves in the grave, fulfilling the codicil of Kilgotten. Finn tells of the AMA's (American Medical Association) visit to Dublin. After finding and reporting endless problems in Dublin's facilities, the Irish threw them out. Finn tells the narrator to use the back door to his pub rather than the front on any bad days. He says that thinking only brings problems, and that it's better to drink and enjoy being alive. He also recommends a good pub in Dublin called \\"The Four Provinces.\\" The narrator goes to The Four Provinces on the extremely dull day of Sunday. He meets a man that tells him that thanking others for things makes life much better. The narrator leaves the pub and comes across a woman playing her harp. He thanks her and tells her what an effect she had on his day. However, he finds that he almost thanked her too much, to the point where she stops playing for a while. The narrator calls for Mike to come pick him up and take him to Finn's. While he drives very gently, Mike says that he has decided to give up what the narrator believes is smoking for Lent. The next day Mike returns to pick up the narrator, this time driving wildly, and the narrator realizes that Mike gave up drinking, not smoking, and that the crazy drive was the first time he rode with Mike while he was sober. The narrator tells Mike that he should find something else to give up, Mike has a drink, and then they slowly drive back to Dublin. While going into the Royal Hibernian, the narrator meets a beggar and her child. He is shocked to find that they are the same ones he saw many years ago in a previous trip to Dublin, and asks the doorman about them. Nick, the doorman, says that they have been there for many years. The vision of the two plagues the narrator, and he wanders around Dublin looking for them. He finally runs into the woman around a corner, and she takes off running. He loses them and decides to go into The Four Provinces, where he finds them. He talks with the babe, who he learns is forty years old and called Brat, and the \\"mother\\" is his sister. They have been begging in front of the Hibernian for thirty years, and the rest of their family before that. Brat has no explanation for his small size, and says that they will soon have enough to sail to New York and no longer have to beg. The narrator receives a cable that he had won an award from the National Institute of Arts and Letters of $5,000. He shares it with Ricki, John, and Jake Vickers. John insists that he find a way to spend it and earn more rather than let it rot. Then John brings up homosexuality, but unlike John and Jake the narrator has nothing to share on the topic. The subject returns to the prize money, and the narrator continues to refuse to go spend the money, and the two other men call him a coward. This takes a way the meaning from the prize and the money, and the narrator announces that he will bet all of the money at a horse race. Ricki had been quietly encouraging him through all of this, and they go out to the porch, where she reads him the letter again and the meaning returns. Nothing more is said of the prize or the money. The narrator has a nightmare where John comes to his door in a wetsuit and says he will teach him to snorkel. The narrator goes after John tells him not to be yellow, and he drowns. Finn wakes the narrator, who was sleeping in the pub. He tells him a story of a visit that George Bernard Shaw made to the pub. He put up signs in the pub reading \\"Stop,\\" \\"Consider,\\" \\"Think,\\" and \\"Do.\\" This brought about silence in the pub for the first time in twenty years, and Father O'Malley has a conversation with Shaw about the philosophy of the words, and eventually has them all taken down. Shaw sees his mistake and breaks them all in his bag before leaving. John tells two reporters that he doesn't think the narrator's heart is really in the writing of the screenplay. As quite the opposite is true, the narrator is devastated, while John insists that it was only a joke. The narrator then goes and writes a short story. In this story, he goes to bring John the latest progress on the script. John reads each page and lets it fall, and at the end proclaims it good. They hear sounds outside, and John says it is a banshee, which appears an hour before someone's death. He then reads a review of the narrator's work, which turns out to be very bad. He throws it in the fire and says that it was actually a good review that he embellished a bit. They then discuss the sound of a banshee outside, and John forces the narrator to go out and face it. The narrator finds a ghostly woman who describes John but calls him Joe, and says that he is nobody's friend and does not really love. The narrator comes back in, and talks to John about the review, and then the banshee outside. John goes out though the narrator tries to stop him, and the narrator goes to bed. The narrator gives the story to John and tells him not to toss the pages as he reads. He then hears John mutter that there will be no more jokes. A very odd group arrives at the Royal Hibernian, led by a man named David Snell-Orkney, and come from Sicily. They become the talk of the town very quickly, and the pub patrons decide to surround the park in which the group is. After a half an hour, the group was still just sitting there watching the trees, and the few that actually stayed gave up on the watch. Timulty enters the pub declares that the Sicilians are very similar to the Irish, which the people in the pub are very opposed to at first but come to realize is true. Then the group comes in the pub, and says that they have been following summer around the globe and decided to stop by for some winter in Dublin. They had been looking at the leaves fall off the trees in the snow and ice. The Irishmen of the pub realize that they have not noticed the trees in decades, and they all go out to look at the leaves. Father Leary takes the group to his church, and later Finn convinces them to come see a \\"sprint.\\" The Irish explain to the narrator and the Snell-Orkney group the anthem sprint. After a show in the cinema, the national anthem of Ireland is played. The moviegoers make a sport to see who can get out of the theater first after the movie before the anthem begins. Doone and Hoolihan decide to have an anthem run. All of the rules are explained, and after the movie, Hoolihan rushes out, but Doone does not. They find him still in the theater, where he was overcome by the singing of Deanna Durbin, which reminded him of his dead grandmother. They have the end of the film run again to redo the anthem sprint, but as the end approaches, Doone realizes that his leg is dead. He gives his cap and scarf to the narrator and tells him to run in his place. The narrator does so, but finds that he is the only one that ran. The rest are still in the theater, and then they wall watch again. Snell-Orkney and his friends all sail away singing. The narrator is at dinner, talking a lot with John, Jake, and friends. He makes jokes about everyone he can, evoking laughter from everyone present. He \\"hypnotizes\\" John, and tells him that it is not that the narrator that fears flying, but that John fears sailing. Later, John tells him that he needs to fly to England. The narrator says that he is scared to death and will not go, and John threatens to take both his vacation and that of their secretary. The narrator refuses and says that everyone will get their vacation, he will take the ferry, and John will fly. John leaves the room quickly, and refuses to talk to the narrator for a day and a half. Jake tells him that it is just a joke and that if he doesn't act upset about it that John will let it go. The narrator awakes at seven, convinces himself that he is Herman Melville, and writes into the afternoon, finishing the script. He takes it to John, who is impressed, and says that he should take the ferry to England.

Some critics gave the work high praise: Publishers Weekly said it was a \\"lighthearted, beguiling autobiographical novel\\", concluding, \\"Bradbury's prose is as vibrant and distinctive as the landscape in which these delightful tales are set.\\" Kirkus Reviews called it \\"Bradbury's triumph. He has never written better.\\" Others found it to fall short because of its stilted diction and stereotypical characters and plots. The New York Times found it \\"Somewhere between homage and hokum … a cartoon that might be offensive if it weren't so affectionate.\\"Review by Peter Finn, 26 July 1992, Section 7. The Los Angeles Times said it was \\"a charming, delicate story\\" of Bradbury's memories, and what they mean to him, \\"and if at times the words seem hushed, muted in their reverence for history, the cast of characters … keeps the story from sliding headlong into wistfulness.\\"Book Section, 7 June 1992.

It is a charter member of the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS). The IHSA regulates 14 sports for boys, 15 sports for girls, and eight co- educational non-athletic activities. More than 760 public and private high schools in the state of Illinois are members of the IHSA. The Association's offices are in Bloomington, Illinois. In its over 100 years of existence, the IHSA has been at the center of many controversies. Some of these controversies (inclusion of sports for girls, the inclusion of private schools, drug testing, and the use of the term \\"March Madness\\") have had national resonance, or paralleled the struggles seen in other states across the country. Other controversies (geographic advancement of teams to the state playoff series, struggles between small schools and large schools, particular rules unique to Illinois competition) are more of a local focus. ==Governance== The Illinois High School Association (IHSA) is governed according to the rules of its constitution. This constitution covers the broadest policies of the Association, such as membership, governance, officers and their duties, and meeting requirements. The IHSA is led by an eleven-member Board of Directors. All eleven members are high school principals from member schools. Seven of the ten are elected to three-year terms from seven geographic regions within the state of Illinois. Three other board members are elected at-large. A treasurer, who does not vote, is appointed by the Board. The Board of Directors determines IHSA policies and employs an executive director and staff. They also work with the Illinois General Assembly, the Illinois State Board of Education, the Illinois Principals Association, the Illinois Association of School Boards, the Illinois Association of School Administrators, the Illinois Athletic Directors Association and the North Central Association. The IHSA also has a 35-member Legislative Commission, consisting of 21 high school principals, seven high school athletic directors elected from each of the seven state regions, and seven at-large members. The commission reviews amendment proposals to the IHSA Constitution and By-laws, and determines which are passed on to a vote of the member schools. Each school receives one vote on any amendments, with voting taking place annually in December. Changes are passed by simple majority of member schools. The day- to-day running of the Association is charged to an administrative staff of nine, one of whom acts in the position of Executive Director. This group is directly responsible for setting up and running the individual state playoff series in each sport and activity. They also supervise annual meetings with advisory committees from each sport and activity to review possible changes in the rules. They also coordinate committees on issues from sportsmanship and sports medicine to media relations and corporate sponsorship. Subordinate to the Constitution and By-Laws are a number of policies. These policies are generally of greater interest to the public, as they more specifically deal with issues that affect the day-to-day operation of sports and activities. Examples of policies include individual athlete eligibility, rules governing the addition of new sports and activities, the classification of schools (1A, 2A, 3A, etc.), and media relations. The key policy that has been a cornerstone to the IHSA is its policy on grouping and seeding tournaments: 1\\\\. The State Series is designed to determine a State Champion. The State Series is not intended to necessarily advance the best teams in the state to the State Final. The IHSA is built upon the concept of geographic representation in its state playoff series. ==History== ===Early years=== The IHSA was founded on December 27, 1900, at a rump session of the Illinois Principals Association. Known as the Illinois High School Athletic Association for the first 40 years of its existence, the IHSA is the second oldest of the 52 state high school associations. Only the Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association outdates it, by two years. For the greater part of a decade, the IHSA was concerned mostly with establishing school control over interscholastic athletic programs and setting eligibility standards for competition. Ringers were a persistent problem, and among schoolboy sports, football was a special concern. In this period, severe injuries and even deaths were not uncommon, and there was much talk of banning football completely. In 1908, the IHSA's mission expanded in an unforeseen direction when its board was convinced by Lewis Omer of Oak Park and River Forest High School to sponsor a statewide basketball tournament. Although a handful of other state associations had sponsored track meets, none had ever attempted to organize a statewide basketball tournament. The first tournament, an 11-team invitational held at the Oak Park YMCA, was a financial success. Subsequent state tournaments, which were open to all member schools, provided the IHSA with fiscal independence, an important new vehicle to spread its message, and ever-increasing name recognition among the public. By 1922, the affairs of the Association became so time-consuming that its board hired a full-time manager, C. W. Whitten. As vice president of the Board, Whitten had recently reorganized the basketball tournament and reduced the size of the state finals from 21 teams to four. About the same time, the IHSA became a charter member of the National Federation of State High School Associations. In addition to his IHSA responsibilities, Whitten ran the business affairs of the NFHS, at first unofficially, and after 1927 with the official title of general manager. From this dual stage, Whitten and his assistant manager at the IHSA, H. V. Porter, exerted unusual influence over high school sports, not only in Illinois, but across the nation. In one memorable battle, Whitten took on the \\"grand old man\\" of college football, Amos Alonzo Stagg of the University of Chicago and effectively shut down his national tournament for high school basketball champions.https://search.proquest.com/docview/180758301 Porter served on several NFHS committees and helped develop the molded basketball and the fan-shaped backboard, among other inventions. Porter later became the first full-time executive of the NFHS. As the Association matured, member schools requested sponsorship of state tournaments in sports other than basketball. The first such move came in 1927, when the IHSA took over control of the Illinois Interscholastic, a festival of high school track, golf, and tennis run by the University of Illinois. The meet continued to be held on the campus in Champaign–Urbana, but as with basketball, IHSA involvement opened the field to all IHSA member schools and removed non-member schools, including a handful of out-of-state schools. The IHSA subsequently established state series in several other boys' sports: swimming and diving (1932), wrestling (1937), baseball (1940), cross country (1946), and gymnastics (1958) (gymnastics had a University of Illinois sponsored state meet from 1952 through 1957). Few of these series were self-supporting, but the ever-popular basketball tournament – sometimes referred to as the \\"goose that laid the golden egg\\" – paid the freight for all. Of the many challenges faced by Whitten during his 20-year career, the one with the longest-lasting repercussions was the reorganization of 1940. Prior to this time, two large groups of Illinois high schools remained outside of IHSA control: private schools, which were not eligible for membership, and the public schools of Chicago, which were eligible but had joined only sporadically. The new constitution approved in 1940 extended the privileges of membership to non- public schools and gave limited autonomy to the Chicago schools, which subsequently joined en masse. In addition, non-athletic activities such as speech and music were added to the IHSA's menu, prompting the elimination of the word \\"Athletic\\" from the Association's name.https://search.proquest.com/docview/176443981https://search.proquest.com/docview/176582220 1941 saw one of the first serious challenges to IHSA authority, when the association banned high school bands from competing nationally. When a bill was introduced in the Illinois General Assembly to transfer the IHSA's authority to the state superintendent's office, the IHSA moved to change the ban, and give local athletic directors a greater voice in decision making.https://search.proquest.com/docview/176507557 Also that year, the IHSA allowed private schools to participate for the first time. In 1942, as World War II started to have an effect on American life, many schools began dropping less popular sports as transportation and hiring qualified coaches became a serious issue. The association polled its membership to investigate the possibility of ending the spring sports season. The poll supported keeping the season.https://search.proquest.com/docview/176845622https://search.proquest.com/docview/176858025 All over the country, as gas rationing threatened to prevent teams and officials from traveling, IHSA Secretary Al Willis was able to get special exemptions for Illinois teams and officials; a precedent that spread to other states, very likely saving high school competitions during the war.Cox, Mark, Problems fail to upset state prep secretary, 12 January 1944, Chicago Daily Tribune, p. 22; accessed 1 September 2008 By 1943, the IHSA had to look at making changes to its rules regarding eligible coaches, and the prospect of military veterans returning to high school.https://search.proquest.com/docview/176867255 Ironically, the federal government eventually did put a limit to post season travel for high schools in May, 1945; too late to stop Illinois' spring tournaments, and just in time to herald the end of the war.https://search.proquest.com/docview/177087972 In the end, the IHSA did not curtail its sports tournaments throughout the war. ===Girls' sports=== The IHSA's record of leadership in the field of girls' athletics is mixed. Girls have had the opportunity to participate in IHSA sponsored interscholastic sports since 1972, though opportunities before that were somewhat restricted. Girls' basketball had already begun to pervade high schools by the time the IHSA was founded in 1900. Just a few years later, upwards of 300 Illinois high schools sponsored girls' basketball teams. For a variety of reasons, the early leaders of the IHSA found this situation unacceptable. They were worried about injuries and putting girls on public display, calling basketball \\"not altogether ladylike\\". They may also have been concerned about girls stealing gym time from the fledgling boys' teams. On November 2, 1907, the IHSA Board banned all interscholastic competition for girls, becoming the first state association to do so. Instead the IHSA, with considerable encouragement from female educators, promoted intramural activities and cooperative play days for girls. When Whitten became the director in 1921, he reached out to the Illinois League of High School Girls' Athletic Associations (ILHSGAA) and together they forged an agreement that barred girls' teams from interscholastic competition in most sports for decades thereafter. The IHSA took over the financial support of the girls' association in 1927 and absorbed it in 1945. The IHSA gradually relaxed its policy somewhat, allowing interschool contests for girls in some non-contact sports such as golf, tennis, and archery, but these were never popular events. To provide a small measure of competition in other sports, the IHSA sponsored \\"telegraphic\\" or \\"postal\\" competitions in basket-shooting, swimming, and bowling. By the late 1960s Whitten and the ILHSGAA were long gone, but for the high school girls of Illinois the playing field had not changed significantly since 1907. While the IHSA was able to withstand pressure from some of its member schools to initiate meaningful interscholastics for girls, the passage of Title IX in May 1972 finally forced the issue. The IHSA held its first girls' state tournament in tennis that fall, and a variety of other sports quickly followed. Today the IHSA sponsors state tournaments in 14 sports for girls. ===Recent times=== While the mundane tasks of regulating eligibility and licensing officials remain just as important to the IHSA's mission as they were in the beginning, higher-profile issues having to do with state tournaments –- and who wins them –- have repeatedly stolen the spotlight in recent years. ====Class change==== Illinois was one of the last states, and certainly the largest, to retain a one-class system, where all schools, regardless of enrollment, competed for the same prize. In December 1970 the smaller schools, who make up the majority of IHSA members, forced a binding referendum on whether to implement a two-class system in boys' basketball, and the measure carried by a narrow margin, 312–293. After this move, several other sports adopted the two-class format. In January 2006, after a substantial majority of schools responding to an advisory referendum indicated a preference for more classes, the IHSA Board of Directors approved expansion in several sports, starting in 2007–08. At the culmination of the first drive for expansion, the IHSA also sought a way to add a state championship in football to its schedule of events. Because of the sheer number of schools involved, a playoff involving all schools was not possible. In 1974, the IHSA introduced a five-class system in which teams qualified based on their regular-season performance. The addition of the football playoffs coaxed the last large group of non-members, the schools of the Chicago Catholic League, to join the IHSA. The playoffs were expanded to six classes in 1980 and eight classes in 2001. ====Private school multiplier==== The success of non-public schools in IHSA tournaments has led to considerable debate among the members, 83% of which are public schools. In 1985, the Interstate Eight Conference proposed a bylaw that the IHSA should exclude private schools from competing in state tournaments, though the membership voted this proposal down. In 2005, the Board of Directors implemented a multiplier for classification purposes that boosted the enrollments of non-boundaried schools by a factor of 1.65. A group of 37 private schools later sued the Association, and a settlement was reached that required the multiplier to go through the Association's annual legislative process. In December 2005, the member schools voted 450–143 to retain the 1.65 multiplier. ====March Madness==== Another lawsuit drew national attention in the 1990s, when the IHSA laid claim to \\"March Madness\\". The phrase was first used to describe the IHSA basketball tournament in an essay written by H. V. Porter in 1939 and published in the IHSA's monthly magazine. Over time the phrase came to be used for high school basketball tournaments, particularly in Illinois, but was not trademarked by the IHSA. When a television production company sought to register the phrase, the IHSA sued, leading to a battle that eventually involved the NCAA as well. In the end, a district court judge ruled that both the IHSA and NCAA could register the trademark and use the phrase for their own purposes. In addition, the IHSA is the sole owner of the mark, \\"America's Original March Madness\\". ====1995 wrestling controversy==== In 1995, Mt. Carmel (Chicago), under coach Bill Weick, entered the end of the wrestling season ranked third in the nation by USA Today, and was poised to win its fourth consecutive state dual team title.[Johnson, K. C. with Reid Hanley & Scott Johnson contributing, 5 February 1995, IHSA Ruling Pins Mt. Carmel's Hopes Caravan Disqualified From State Meet For Too Many Invitationals, Chicago Tribune, p. 16. Retrieved October 7, 2008, from Chicago Tribune database. (Document ID: 20692920)] Just prior to their Regional tournament, the IHSA learned that the school had competed in too many invitational tournaments, and disqualified the school from further competing as a team. Mt. Carmel did not deny the assertion; however, they claimed that one of the varsity tournaments had only had JV and frosh-soph wrestlers competing. Mt. Carmel won a temporary injunction from the Cook County Circuit Court to permit their team to compete in the regionals.[Hanley, Reid, with John K. McCarthy, Sam Natrop and Raymond Rinn contributing, 8 February 1995, Mt. Carmel Wins In Court; Naperville N., Waubonsie On Mat, Chicago Tribune, p. 4. Retrieved October 7, 2008, from Chicago Tribune database. (Document ID: 20695363)] While the individual tournaments progressed, Mt. Carmel won a court victory, which forced the IHSA to permit the team to wrestle.[Fegelman, Andrew, 17 February 1995, Judge favors Mt. Carmel; IHSA will appeal, Chicago Tribune, p. 410. Retrieved October 7, 2008, from Chicago Tribune database. (Document ID: 8009010).] When the IHSA's appeal was denied, and after temporarily suspending the tournament, the IHSA decided to end the season without a Class AA state championship dual team tournament; the first time in the history of the Association that a state tournament had been cancelled due to a cause other than war.[Hanley, Reid, 28 February 1995, IHSA Cancels Class AA Wrestling Tournament Ruling Body Decides To Pull Plug Rather Than Include Mt. Carmel, Chicago Tribune, p. 3, Retrieved October 7, 2008, from Chicago Tribune database. (Document ID: 20894054)] ====Media usage restrictions==== On November 1, 2007, the Illinois Press Association (IPA) and two newspapers (the Northwest Herald and the State Journal-Register) filed for a temporary restraining order to prohibit the IHSA from enforcing its policy restricting the use of photographs taken at its state final events. The IHSA's policy, similar to those adopted by the NCAA, colleges such as Illinois State University and the University of Illinois, and other state high school associations, allows news-gathering organizations to sell photos that are published but prohibits the sale (usually through a Web site) of the many photos taken at the event that are not published. A circuit court judge denied the motion on November 5 and encouraged the parties to renew talks to resolve the impasse. The plaintiffs withdrew their request for a preliminary injunction on November 16 as talks continued. On December 5, 2007, the IHSA announced that it had filed a countersuit to the IPA seeking a resolution to the ongoing issue, citing a failure on the part of the IPA to continue talks, and the ongoing sale of photographs. In January, 2008, it was announced that State Representative Joseph Lyons had submitted Illinois House Bill 4582, which would prevent the IHSA from enforcing its ban on press outlets from selling pictures of IHSA events. In April, 2008, the IHSA and the Illinois Press Association jointly announced a cessation of hostilities that gave the press permission to sell photographs without hindrance from the IHSA ====Performance-enhancing drug testing==== On January 14, 2008, the IHSA announced that, based on a survey of 54% of its principals, it would move forward to design and implement a program to test for the presence of performance-enhancing drugs in student athletes participating in select State Series competitions.IHSA Board minutes from Jan. 14, 2008 highlighting drug testing plan. While details have not been worked out, based on the vote of the principals, the membership would not favor forcing a team to forfeit in the event of a positive test, though the membership, which voted overwhelmingly favored to support a period of ineligibility for athletes testing positive, and narrowly supported forcing schools to adopt education programs if an athlete tested positive. ===Executive directors=== Prior to 1991, this office was known as Manager or Executive Secretary. * C.

Participation of girls on these boys & girls teams is uncommon, as it is in other states with similar arrangements. Girls teams with no accompanying \\"boys\\" team are girls only. On 13 October 2009, the IHSA announced that it would begin sponsoring a state series in lacrosse for both boys and girls starting in 2010–11. ===Discontinued sports=== { border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"3\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" -style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\" !width=\\"200\\"Sportwidth=\\"150\\"IHSA State Serieswidth=\\"300\\"Most Championships - Archery (girls)1976–802–Rolling Meadows HS -style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\" Field Hockey (girls)1975–812–DeKalb HS - } Note: In addition, the earliest Track and Field meets (1893–1901) included bicycle racing as events. ==Sanctioned non-athletic activities== { border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"3\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" -style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\" !width=\\"200\\"Sportwidth=\\"150\\"First IHSA State Serieswidth=\\"300\\"Most Championships - Bass Fishing20091--8-Way Tie -style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\" Chess19757--University HS - Debate9194120--Glenbrook North HS -style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\" Drama and Group Interpretation194117--Homewood-Flossmoor HS - Journalism20062—Naperville Central High School, Homewood-Flossmoor HS -style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\" Music197332--Herscher HS - Scholastic Bowl198712--Illinois Math and Science Academy -style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\" Speech Individual Events194116--Downers Grove South High School - } Note: Some Illinois high schools field competitive teams in events such as fencing, field hockey, and ice hockey, but the IHSA does not sponsor tournaments in these events. Other academic competitions, such as Academic Decathlon, Science Olympiad, and DECA are not sponsored by the IHSA, and are governed by their respective national and/or state agencies. ==State series format== While the earlier years of the IHSA saw a hodgepodge of systems for organizing each event's state playoff series, there exists today a more uniform system. The IHSA attempts to organize state championship events geographically, so that different regions of the state are represented in state finals competition. Though not every competition uses it, the Regional (R) tournament is generally the lowest level of competition, and is open to every team that is eligible to enter. This is followed by Sectional (S) competition, and is followed by the State (F) level. In some sports, there is a single game Super-Sectional (SS), which follows the Sectional, and determines the state qualifier. In some regions where teams are further from one another, the sectionals are divided into sub-sectionals for seeding purposes. The following is an overview of the state series. Unless noted, boys and girls sports use identical systems. In all cases, seeding is either conducted by a conclave of coaches, or is made by criterion of best scores or times (as in track & field). { border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"3\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" -style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\" !width=\\"210\\"Sportwidth=\\"90\\"# of Classeswidth=\\"90\\"Formatwidth=\\"350\\"Seeding information - Badminton (girls only)1S-Findividuals seeded at sectional level; no team seeding -style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\" Baseball4R-S-SS-Fteams seeded at sectional or sub-sectional level - Basketball4R-S-SS-Fteams seeded at sectional or sub-sectional level -style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\" Bowling1S-Fno seeding - Cheerleading32S-Fno seeding -style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\" Dance3S-Fno seeding - Cross- Country3R-S-Fno seeding - Football866 -style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\" Golf (boys)3R-S-Fno seeding - Golf (girls)2R-S-Fno seeding -style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\" Gymnastics (boys)1S-Findividual seeding at sectional level - Gymnastics (girls)1R-S-Findividual seeding at regional level -style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\" Soccer3R-S- SS-Fteams seeded at sectional or sub-sectional level - Softball4R-S- SS-Fteams seeded at sectional or sub-sectional level -style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\" Swimming & Diving1S-Findividuals seeded at sectional level - Tennis1S-Findividuals seeded at sectional level -style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\" Track & Field3S-Findividuals seeded at sectional level - Volleyball (boys)1R-S-Fteams seeded at sectional or sub-sectional level -style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\" Volleyball (girls)4R-S-SS-Fteams seeded at sectional or sub-sectional level - Water Polo1S-Fteams seeded at sectional level -style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\" Wrestling3R-S-Findividuals seeded at regional level7 - } None of the competitive activities to date have a super-sectional level of competition, but otherwise follow similar formats for their state competitions.

Individual schools organize themselves into conferences, mostly as a way of making scheduling easier, and many schools choose to compete as independents. However, conference affiliation does come into play in football competition, as conference champions earn an automatic bid into the playoffs (football conferences must have at least six members for a champion to be automatically playoff-eligible). Football teams not affiliated in a conference can still qualify with six or more wins. Football competition is played with a nine-game schedule. * National Federation of State High School Associations * Illinois high school boys basketball championship *Illinois Elementary School Association ==Notes== 1The total of 52 counts the high school association of the District of Columbia and the two associations in Iowa, of which the latter has separate governing bodies for boys' and girls' school activities. 2The IHSA sponsors three classes of competitive cheerleading. In addition, there is a fourth class for coed cheerleading teams. 3While boys' golf did not have a team champion until 1938, the IHSA sponsored an individual tournament in 1916, and from 1919 onward. 4Boys' tennis did not have a team champion until 1936, but the IHSA sponsored individual tournaments from 1912 to 1915, and then from 1919 onward. 5The seventeen state titles in Girls Track and Field were won by Lincoln High School in East St. Louis. This school closed after the 1997–98 school year. East St. Louis Senior High School is the caretaker of these records, though the school has not won any state titles in this sport since the merger. 6Football is the only sport to which a team must qualify for entry. 256 teams are accepted based on record, and then opponent wins. These teams are broken into eight groups by size, after which, each team is assigned to one of two 16-team brackets based on geography. Seeding within the bracket is based on record, and then opponent wins. 7Wrestling teams are assigned to a regional by geography. Individual wrestlers are seeded in each weight class. The team regional champion is based on team scores, which are standard for wrestling tournaments, based on individual advancement. The individuals then compete in individual sectionals and an individual state championship. Afterwards, the teams that won their regionals compete in a dual team sectional tournament, with sectional winners advancing to state. 8Music competition is held in a sweepstakes format. Competing schools perform at sites throughout the state. Scores are then submitted from each site to the IHSA, who then rank teams according to the judges scores, with the highest score in each Class being the State Champion. Any school earning a \\"First Division\\" distinction in judging, irrelevant of their final placement, may purchase an award. While barred from solo performance, music ensembles are the only IHSA competitions in which junior high or middle school participation is permitted. 9The IHSA stopped recognizing team champions in debate after the 1971–72 school year. Individual competition continues to the present. 10Although Football and Wrestling are boys' sports, girls can play in both of these sports. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Johnson, Scott, et al. 100 Years of Madness: The Illinois High School Association Boys' Basketball Tournament.

The Branston factory proved to be uneconomical, and production was moved to Crosse & Blackwell subsidiary, E Lazenby & Sons in Bermondsey, London, where it invested in new buildings in 1924 and 1926, which remained in use until 1969. In 2004, the pickle business was sold by Nestlé to Premier Foods and production was moved to Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk. Premier Foods sold the brand to Mizkan in 2013, at which time it ceased to be labelled as Crosse and Blackwell because in Europe this name was sold separately to Princes Group. Over 17 million jars a year are sold in the UK. ==Original pickle== Branston Pickle Branston Pickle is made from a variety of diced vegetables, including swede (rutabaga), carrots, onions and cauliflower pickled in a sauce made from vinegar, tomato, apple and spices. In recent years high-fructose corn syrup has replaced sugar in the product sold in the American market. Sugar is still used in the British version. Branston Pickle is sweet and spicy with a chutney-like consistency, containing chunks of vegetables in a thick brown sticky sauce. It is commonly served as part of a ploughman's lunch, a popular menu item in British pubs. It is also frequently combined with cheddar cheese in sandwiches, and many sandwich shops in the UK offer cheese and pickle as an option. It is available in the standard 'chunky' version, as well as a 'small chunk' variety, which is easier to spread onto bread. Convenient squeeze-bottle packs are also in the range, along with a 'smooth' recipe. Branston also has flavoured pickles including Sweet Chilli and Beetroot flavoured pickle. ==Brand extension== Additional Branston products include mayonnaise, tomato ketchup, brown sauce, salad cream, and baked beans. In October 2005, Premier Foods launched Branston Baked Beans. The marketing and promotion of this product was aimed at challenging Heinz's dominance of the UK baked bean market. This marketing included an advert, featuring a Branston Bean Tin explaining how Branston Beans are very \\"saucy\\". Promotional activities included a 'Great British Bean Poll' where members of the public across the country were invited to blind taste both 'the brand leader' (assumed to be Heinz) and Branston. In the poll, 76% of participants picked Branston over the brand leader. Heinz elected to change their recipe in the face of this aggressive activity. Premier Foods also attempted to leverage the traditional Branston Pickle brand name by producing Branston Relishes in four different flavours: Hot Chilli & Jalapeño, Gherkin, Sweet Onion and Tomato & Red Pepper. Around November 2015, a sweet chili-flavoured pickle was launched, and the brand's rich and fruity sauce was re-launched, along with two new sauce flavours, rich and spicy and rich and smoky. In 2017, Branston launched its tomato ketchup, mayonnaise and brown sauce lines in single-serving sachet packaging. Walkers once produced a variety of crisps called \\"Cheese and Branston Pickle\\". ==Sale to Mizkan== Branston Depot - the original factory of Branston Pickle; on Burton Road, Branston, Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire In late 2012, it was announced that as part of an aggressive debt reduction strategy, Premier Foods would be selling the Branston brand to Japanese food manufacturer Mizkan Group for £92.5 million, joining Sarson's vinegar and Hayward's pickled onions as recent Premier Foods to Mizkan brand acquisitions. The Bury St Edmunds plant continues to manufacture Branston products. ==Availability outside the UK== Branston Pickle is sold in Ireland, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, France, Denmark, Malta, Singapore (Cold Storage and Market Place), Germany (REWE and Globus Warenhaus), Turkey (Kipa), the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Slovakia (Tesco), Belgium (Carrefour Market Etterbeek), Hong Kong (Taste), South Africa, Southern Spain (Supersol and Carrefour), Thailand (Chiang Mai, Rimping), Vietnam, Angola and Namibia. ==See also== * Anglo-Indian cuisine * List of brand name condiments * List of chutneys * Major Grey's Chutney ==ReferencesBranston Pickle on the Mizkan website * Branston Pickle Facebook Page * Branston Pickle Twitter Account Category:Food brands of the United Kingdom Category:English brands Category:1922 establishments in England Category:British condiments Category:Mizkan brands Category:Brand name condiments Category:Brown sauces ","title":"Branston (brand)"},{"id":"2562490","text":"For Lovers Only is a 1995 covers/pop standards album by The Temptations for the Motown label, something of a sequel to their 1967 album The Temptations in a Mellow Mood.

A nasheed (Arabic: singular ', plural ', meaning: \\"chants\\") is a work of vocal music that is either sung a cappella or accompanied by percussion instruments such as the daf. In general, Islamic anasheed do not contain lamellaphone instruments, string instruments, or wind and brass instruments, and digital remastering – either to mimic percussion instruments or create overtones – is not permitted as this is still a form of instrumentation and mimics actual instruments. The only acceptable instrument is the daf which is to be used during weddings as some in the time of Muhammad. It can also be used in certain ceremonies. Nasheed are popular throughout the Islamic world. The material and lyrics of a nasheed usually make reference to Islamic beliefs, history, and religion, as well as current events. == Prohibition of instruments == Some ulama argue that the use of musical instruments is implicitly prohibited in the ahadith. The founders of all four of the major madhabs – Islamic schools of thought – as well as many other prominent scholars, have debated the legitimacy and use of musical instruments. For instance, according to the Hanafi school of thought, associated with the scholar Abu Hanifa, if a person is known to listen to such forbidden musical instruments, their testimony is not to be accepted. A majority of Muslim scholars traditionally have held that at least some music with some of its instruments are haraam: sinful by the hadith, as well as by tradition. There are those who reject such claims, citing revealed scriptures, earlier prophets, and the example of Mohammed in the appreciation of the musical arts. According to the widely acknowledged book of authentic hadiths Sahih al-Bukhari of Sunni scholarship, Muhammad taught that musical instruments are sinful: \\"Narrated Abu 'Amir or Abu Malik Al-Ash'ari [a companion of Muhammad] that he heard the Prophet saying, \\"From among my followers there will be some people who will consider illegal sexual intercourse, the wearing of silk, the drinking of alcoholic drinks and the use of musical instruments, as lawful. And there will be some people who will stay near the side of a mountain and in the evening their shepherd will come to them with their sheep and ask them for something, but they will say to him, 'Return to us tomorrow.' Allah will destroy them during the night and will let the mountain fall on them, and He will transform the rest of them into monkeys and pigs and they will remain so till the Day of Resurrection.\\".Shahih al- Bukhari Volume 7, Book 69, Number 494v: English translation of this hadith here: . == Modern interpretations == A new generation of nasheed artists use a wide variety of musical instruments in their art. Many new nasheed artists are non-Arabs and sing in different languages, like English, Bengali, Urdu, Hindi, Pashto, or Turkish. Some nasheed bands are Native Deen, Outlandish, UNIC and Raihan. Other well-known artists are Ahmed Bukhatir, Yusuf Islam (formerly known as Cat Stevens), Ahmed Mac, Sami Yusuf, Junaid Jamshed, Zahid Ullah Afridi, Maher Zain, Harris J, Humood AlKhudher, Hamza Namira, Atif Aslam, Raef, Jae deen (Deen Squad), Mesut Kurtis, Dawud Wharnsby, Zain Bhikha, Hafiz Mizan and Kamal Uddin. In the Indian subcontinent, Qawali is famous for the Islamic relationship with spirituality in the national language of Pakistan, Urdu. It is said that many spiritual men like Bhullay Shah, Kabir Singh, Baba Fareed and others spread the message of Islam in Punjabi, Saraiki, and Urdu. The Grand Masters Of Qawali are said to be Ustad (Teacher like Father) the most famous are Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Mian Azeez Qawal, Pathany Khan, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan and others. Arabic nasheed artists – or Munshids – include Abu Mazen, Abu Rateb, Abu Al joud, Abu Dujanah, Abdulfattah Owainat and Muhammad al-Muqit. Some of the well known Arabic nasheed bands are Al Rawabi, Al I'atisam, Al Baraa' and Al Wa'ad Appealing to a significant Muslim audience and also leading to performance of such artists at Islamic oriented festivals (such as Mawlid), conferences, concerts and shows, including ISNA, Celebrate Eid, and Young Muslims. Other artists and organisations such as Nasheed Bay promote an instrument-free stance with anasheed, differing from the current trends of the increasing usage of instruments in anasheed. The Islamic State (ISIS) is known for the use of nasheeds in their videos and propaganda, notable examples being the chant \\"Dawlat al-Islam Qamat\\", which came to be viewed as an unofficial anthem of ISIL, and \\"Salil al-sawarim\\". ISIS has also produced nasheeds in French. The 2016 nasheed \\"Ma vengeance\\" contains praise of the January 2015 Paris attacks, the November 2015 Paris attacks, and the 2016 Brussels bombings. The 2016 chant \\"Par Amour\\" glorifies martyrdom. == See also == == References == == Further reading == * Thibon, Jean-Jacques, Inshad, in Muhammad in History, Thought, and Culture: An Encyclopedia of the Prophet of God (2 vols.), Edited by C.

It was published between 1982 and 1998. The magazine supported both the Atari 8-bit family and later the Atari ST models. ==History== The magazine had its origins in the newsletter of the Birmingham User's Group, an independent Atari club based in England. Les Ellingham was appointed to be the editor of the newsletter, but decided to produce a magazine with broader appeal instead. He remained editor of Page 6 throughout its entire run of 85 issues.

When Database ceased publication of the original Atari User magazine in 1988, Page 6 bought the rights (and subscriber list), and renamed their magazine, firstly to Page 6 Atari User in February 1989 and then to New Atari User in June of the same year. The latter was simply Page 6 under a different (and more newsagent-friendly) name, and had next to no continuity with the original Atari User.

Its role is to isolate and protect the developing spore-producing surface, represented by gills or tubes, found on the lower surface of the cap. A partial veil, in contrast to a universal veil, extends from the stem surface to the cap edge. The partial veil later disintegrates, once the fruiting body has matured and the spores are ready for dispersal. It might then give rise to a stem ring, or fragments attached to the stem or cap edge. In some mushrooms, both a partial veil and a universal veil may be present. ==Structure== A cobweb-like cortina of Cortinarius claricolor In the immature fruit bodies of some basidiomycete fungi, the partial veil extends from the stem surface to the cap margin and shields the gills during development, and later breaks to expose the mature gills. The presence, absence, or structure of the partial veil is an aid to identification of mushrooms.Arora (1986), p. 16. Some fruit bodies may have both a universal and partial veil, others may have only one or the other, while many lack both types of veils. The partial veil may be membranous or cobwebby, and may have multiple layers. Various adjectives are commonly used to describe the texture of partial veils, such as: membranous, like a membrane; cottony, where the veil tissue is made of separate fibers that may be easily separated like a cotton ball; fibrillose, composed of thin strands and glutinous, with a slimy consistency. Some mushrooms have partial veils which are evanescent, which are so thin and delicate that they disappear after they rupture, or leave merely a faint trace on the stem known as an annular zone or ring zone. Others may leave a persistent annulus (ring). Occasionally, the partial veil adheres to the edge of the cap as shreds of tissue, forming an appendiculate margin. The cobweb-like, fragile partial veil of some mushrooms, especially those in the genus Cortinarius, are known as cortinas. The fibrous threads of the cortina often catch the brown spores as they drop, making them visible as fine brown streaks along the stem. Some species of Agaricus, such as Agaricus arvensis, have a partial veil that resembles a cogwheel. Mycologists Alexander H. Smith and Harry D. Thiers, in their 1964 monograph on the bolete genus Suillus, proposed the term \\"false veil\\" to account for those species of Suillus that have a \\"conspicuous cottony roll\\" of tissue that originates from the cap margin (especially in young specimens) and never becomes integrated with the stem tissue. ==Development in Agaricus== Species in the genus Agaricus have a partial veil that is made of two layers of tissue, although the two layers are not clearly distinct in all species.Arora, 1986, p. 312. In the early 20th century, American mycologist George Francis Atkinson investigated the development of the mushroom Agaricus arvensis by collecting young mushroom buttons (immature fruit bodies with the veil intact and the cap not yet expanded) and observing their growth in the laboratory. He determined that the partial veil originates from the tissue lying outside the annular cavity (the area containing the delicate developing hymenium and enclosed by the partial veil) and is not clearly separated from the universal veil. It is connected to both the margin of the cap and the surface of the stem. The partial veil increases in size as tension is applied to it from the expansion of the cap and stem. The lower portion of the partial veil (connected to the stem) has a looser texture, and is relatively porous to allow for air exchange. The upper portion of the partial veil (next to the gill cavity) is connected directly with the margin of the cap. It originates partly from fundamental tissue (actively dividing hyphae that comprise the bulk of the cap and stem tissue) and partly by growth from the margin of the cap. The looser portion of the veil is torn off from the surface of the stem as the mushroom expands and grows, and provides the looser lower portion of the duplex veil characteristic of this species and some of the other species of Agaricus, like A. augustus. ==See also== *Universal veil *Veil (mycology) ==References== ===Cited literature=== * Category:Fungal morphology and anatomy ","title":"Partial veil"},{"id":"2562513","text":"George (died 359) was the bishop of Laodicea in Syria from 335 until his deposition in 347. He took part in the Trinitarian controversies of the fourth century. At first an ardent admirer of the teaching of Arius and associated with Eusebius of Nicomedia, he subsequently became a semi-Arian, but seems ultimately to have united with the Anomoeans, whose uncompromising opponent he had once been, and to have died professing their tenets.Newman, Arians, pt. ii. p. 275. George was a native of Alexandria in Roman Egypt. In early life he devoted himself with considerable distinction to the study of philosophy.Philost. H. E. viii. 17. He was ordained a presbyter by Bishop Alexander I of Alexandria.Eus. Vit. Const. iii. 62. Having gone to Antioch, he endeavoured to mediate between Arius and the orthodox catholic church. To the Arians he shewed how, by a sophistical evasion based on (τὰ δὲ πάντα ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ), they might accept the orthodox test (Θεὸν ἐκ Θεοῦ).Socr. H. E. ii. 45.Athan. de Synod. p. 887. The attempt at reconciliation completely failed, and resulted in his deposition and excommunication by Alexander, on the ground of false doctrine and of the open and habitual irregularities of his life.Athan. de Synod. p. 886.Athan. Apol. ii. p. 728.Athan. de Fug. p. 718.Theod. H. E. ii. 9. Athanasius styles him \\"the most wicked of all the Arians\\", reprobated even by his own party. After his excommunication at Alexandria, George sought admission among the clergy of Antioch, but was steadily rejected by Eustathius.Athan. Hist. Arian. p. 812. On this he retired to Arethusa, where he acted as presbyter, and, on the expulsion of Eustathius, was welcomed back to Antioch by the dominant Arian faction. He was appointed bishop of Laodicea on the death of the Arian Theodotus.Athan. Or. i. p. 290.Soz. H. E. vi. 25. As bishop he took a leading part in the successive synods summoned by the Arian faction against Athanasius. He was at the councils of Tyre and Jerusalem in 335,Eus. Vit. Const. iv. 43. and the council at Antioch that celebrated the dedication of the Domus Aurea in 341.Soz. H. E. iii. 5. Fear kept him from the council of Sardica in 347, where the bishops unanimously deposed him and many others as having been previously condemned by Alexander, and as holding Arian opinions.Theod. H. E. iii. 9.Labbe, Concil. ii. 678.Athan. Apol. ii. p. 765. Of this deposition George took no heed. In 358, when Eudoxius, the newly appointed bishop of Antioch, openly sided with Aëtius and the Anomoeans, George earnestly appealed to Macedonius of Constantinople and other bishops, who were visiting Basil of Ancyra to consecrate a newly erected church in Ancyra, to lose no time in summoning a council to condemn the Anomoean heresy and eject Aëtius. His letter is preserved by Sozomen.Soz. H. E. iv. 13.Labbe, Concil. ii. 790. At Seleucia Pieria in 359, when the semi-Arian party was split into two, George headed the more numerous faction opposed to that of Acacius and Eudoxius, whom, with their adherents, they deposed.Socr. H. E. ii. 40. On the expulsion of Anianus from the see of Antioch, George was mainly responsible for the election of Meletius, believing him to hold the same opinions as himself.

Advocates generally argue that human life begins at conception and that the human zygote (or embryo or fetus) is a person and therefore has a right to life. The anti-abortion movement includes a variety of organizations, with no single centralized decision-making body. There are diverse arguments and rationales for the anti-abortion stance. Some anti- abortion activists allow for some permissible abortions, including therapeutic abortions, in exceptional circumstances such as incest, rape, severe fetal defects or when the woman's health is at risk. Before the Supreme Court 1973 decisions in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, anti-abortion views predominated and found expression in state laws which prohibited or restricted abortions in a variety of ways. (See Abortion in the United States.) The anti-abortion movement became politically active and dedicated to the reversal of the Roe v. Wade decision, which struck down most state laws restricting abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. In the United States, the movement is associated with several Christian religious groups, especially the Catholic Church, and is frequently, but not exclusively, allied with the Republican Party. The movement is also supported by secular organizations (such as Secular Pro-Life) and non-mainstream anti-abortion feminists. The movement seeks to reverse Roe v. Wade and to promote legislative changes or constitutional amendments, such as the Human Life Amendment, that prohibit or at least broadly restrict abortion. On the other side of the abortion debate in the United States is the abortion-rights movement (also called the pro-choice movement), which argues that pregnant women should have the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion. ==History== Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, a movement to liberalize abortion laws gained momentum due in part to the second-wave feminist movement and to a number of high-profile therapeutic abortion cases, such as that of Sherri Finkbine. In 1965, a Supreme Court decision in Griswold v. Connecticut set a precedent for an expansive right to privacy in the area of reproductive healthcare. In the late 1960s, in response to nationwide abortion-rights efforts, a number of organizations were formed to mobilize opinion against the legalization of abortion. Most of these were led by Catholic institutions and communities; most evangelical Christian groups did not see abortion as a clear-cut or priority issue at the time. The first major U.S. organization in the modern anti-abortion movement, the National Right to Life Committee, was formed out of the United States Catholic Conference in 1967. The description \\"pro-life\\" was adopted by the right-to-life (anti-abortion) movement in the United States following the Supreme Court 1973 decision Roe v. Wade, which held that a woman may terminate her pregnancy prior to the viability of the fetus outside of the womb and may also terminate her pregnancy \\"subsequent to viability ... for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\\"Roe v. Wade (98–1856) 410 U.S. 113 (1973). Retrieved April 29, 2011. The term pro- life was adopted instead of anti-abortion to highlight their proponents' belief that abortion is the taking of a human life, rather than an issue concerning the restriction of women's reproductive rights, as the pro choice movement would say. The first organized action was initiated by U.S. Catholic bishops who recommended in 1973 that the U.S. Constitution should be amended to ban abortion. Roe v. Wade was considered a major setback by anti-abortion campaigners. The case and the overturning of most anti-abortion laws spurred the growth of a largely religious-based anti-abortion political and social movement, even as Americans were becoming, in the 1970s and 1980s, increasingly pro-choice. The first major anti-abortion success since Roe's case came in 1976 with the passing of the Hyde Amendment prohibiting the use of certain federal funds for abortions. In Harris v. McRae, anti-abortion advocates won a 1980 challenge to the Hyde Amendment. That same year, anti- abortion politicians gained control of the Republican Party's platform committee, adding anti-abortion planks to the Republican position, and calling for a Human Life Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, banning abortion. Four anti-abortion U.S. Presidents – Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump – were elected. Lisa Miller of The Washington Post wrote about the younger, more feminine face of the anti-abortion movement with the rise of leaders such as Lila Rose of Live Action, Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List, Charmaine Yoest of Americans United for Life, Penny Nance of Concerned Women for America, and Kristan Hawkins of Students for Life, all \\"youngish Christian working mothers with children at home\\" who seek to combat the image of the anti-abortion movement as made up of \\"old white men\\" who cannot relate to the experience of pregnant women. The anti-abortion movement has been successful in recent years in promoting new laws against abortion within the states. The Guttmacher Institute said eighty laws restricting abortion were passed in the first six months of 2011, \\"more than double the previous record of 34 abortion restrictions enacted in 2005—and more than triple the 23 enacted in 2010\\". In 2019, six U.S. states (Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, and Ohio) enacted fetal heartbeat abortion bills. These heartbeat bills generally restrict abortion to the time period in pregnancy before a fetal heartbeat can be detected (which can be as early as six weeks of gestation or as late as twelve weeks). The bills face legal challenges, with their supporters stating they hope the legislation will allow the United States Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v Wade. Other abortion-related laws passed in several US states during this time period, which were upheld by the judicial system, include laws requiring an ultrasound before an abortion and laws that mandate fetal burial or cremation after an abortion. ==Overview== The anti-abortion movement includes a variety of organizations, with no single centralized decision-making body. There are diverse arguments and rationales for the anti-abortion stance. Many socially conservative organizations are involved in the anti-abortion movement. Some groups focus solely on promoting the anti-abortion cause, such as American Life League, the Susan B. Anthony List, National Right to Life Committee, Americans United for Life, and Live Action, among many others. Other groups support not only the anti-abortion cause but the broader family values cause, such as Family Research Council, Focus on the Family, American Family Association, and Concerned Women for America, among many others. Abortion opponents generally believe that human life should be valued either from fertilization or implantation until natural death. The contemporary anti- abortion movement is typically, but not exclusively, influenced by conservative Christian beliefs and has influenced certain strains of bioethical utilitarianism. From that viewpoint, any action which destroys an embryo or fetus kills a person. Any deliberate destruction of human life is considered ethically or morally wrong and is not considered to be mitigated by any benefits to others, as such benefits are coming at the expense of the life of what they believe to be a person. In some cases, this belief extends to opposing abortion of fetuses that would almost certainly expire within a short time after birth, such as anencephalic fetuses. Some abortion opponents also oppose certain forms of birth control, particularly hormonal contraception such as emergency contraception (ECPs), and copper IUDs which may prevent the implantation of a zygote. Because they believe that the term pregnancy should be defined so as to begin at fertilization, they refer to these contraceptives as abortifacients because they cause the fertilized egg to be flushed out during menses. The Catholic Church endorses this view. There are, however, anti-abortion physicians who concur with the view that hormonal contraception does not block implantation. Attachment to an anti-abortion position is often but not exclusively connected to religious beliefs about the sanctity of life (see also culture of life). Exclusively secular-humanist positions against abortion tend to be a minority viewpoint among anti-abortion advocates; these groups say that their position is based on human rights and biology, rather than religion. Some holding the anti-abortion position also hold a complementarian view of gender roles, though there is also a self-described feminist element inside the movement. ==Views in opposition to abortion== The variety in opinion on the issue of abortion is reflected in the diverse views of religious groups. For example, the Catholic Church considers all procured abortions morally evil,Catechism of the Catholic Church para.2271, \\"Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law: 'You shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish'\\". Vatican website. Accessed February 5, 2011. while traditional Jewish teaching sanctions abortion if necessary to safeguard the life and well-being of the pregnant woman. ===Christian groups=== Anti-abortion monument of a parish church in Brooklyn, New York The only coordinated opposition to abortion in the United States during the late 1960s and early 1970s before the Roe v. Wade decision was from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and its Family Life Bureau. Mobilization of a wide-scale anti-abortion movement began immediately after 1973 with the creation of the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC). Before 1980, the Southern Baptist Convention officially advocated for loosening of abortion restrictions. During the 1971 and 1974 Southern Baptist Conventions, Southern Baptists were called upon \\"to work for legislation that will allow the possibility of abortion under such conditions as rape, incest, clear evidence of severe fetal deformity, and carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the emotional, mental, and physical health of the mother.\\" W. Barry Garrett wrote in the Baptist Press, \\"Religious liberty, human equality and justice are advanced by the [Roe v. Wade] Supreme Court abortion decision.\\" By 1980, conservative Protestant leaders became vocal in their opposition to legalized abortion, and by the early 1990s Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition of America became a significant anti-abortion organization. In 2005, Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, said that making abortion illegal is more important than any other issue.Baptist Press \\"Sparks fly in Land's appearance at black columnists' meeting\\" Much of the anti- abortion movement in the United States and around the world finds support in the Roman Catholic Church, the Christian right, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod, the Church of England, the Anglican Church in North America, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS).Sex, Politics, and Religion: The Clash Between Poland and the European Union over Abortion by Alicia Czerwinski in the Denver Journal of International Law and Policy, 2003 However, the anti- abortion teachings of these denominations vary considerably. The Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church consider abortion to be immoral in all cases, but may in some cases permit an act which indirectly and without intent results in the death of the fetus in a case where the mother's life is threatened. In Pope John Paul II's Letter to Families he simply stated the Roman Catholic Church's view on abortion and euthanasia: \\"Laws which legitimize the direct killing of innocent human beings through abortion or euthanasia are in complete opposition to the inviolable right to life proper to every individual; they thus deny the equality of everyone before the law.\\" The National Association of Evangelicals has adopted a number of resolutions stating its opposition to abortion, but \\"recognizes that there might be situations in which terminating a pregnancy is warranted – such as protecting the life of a mother or in cases of rape or incest.\\"Religious Groups' Official Positions on Abortion, Pew Research Center (January 16, 2013). The position of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is that \\"elective abortion for personal or social convenience is contrary to the will and the commandments of God\\" but that abortion may be justified where the pregnancy endangers life of the mother, or where the pregnancy is the outcome of rape or incest. The Taskforce of United Methodists on Abortion and Sexuality (TUMAS) was formed in 1987 to further the anti-abortion ministry in The United Methodist Church. The Southern Baptist Convention believes that abortion is allowable only in cases where there is a direct threat to the life of the woman. Among Mainline Protestant denominations, the Episcopal Church recognizes a right of a pregnant woman to terminate a pregnancy, but opposes \\"abortion as a means of birth control, family planning, sex selection or any reason of mere convenience.\\" The United Church of Christ supports abortion rights, viewing it as a matter of reproductive health and justice. The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) adopts the view that abortion is a personal choice, but acknowledges \\"diverse conclusions and actions\\" within the church on the issue. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America's position is that abortion prior to the point of viability \\"should not be prohibited by law or by lack of public funding\\" but that \\"abortion after the point of fetal viability should be prohibited except when the life of a mother is threatened or when fetal abnormalities pose a fatal threat to a newborn.\\" ===Consistent life ethic=== Supporters of the consistent life ethic also oppose abortions as one of the acts that end human life. In 1979, Juli Loesch linked anti-abortion and anti-nuclear weapons arguments to form the group Pro Lifers for Survival. In 1987 this group defined an ethic of the sanctity of all life, and formed the group Seamless Garment Network. This group was against abortion, euthanasia, capital punishment, militarism, poverty and racism. Beginning in 1983, American Catholic Cardinal Joseph Bernardin argued that abortion, euthanasia, capital punishment, and unjust war are all related, and all wrong. He said that \\"to be truly 'pro-life,' you have to take all of those issues into account.\\" Paul M. Perl studied 1996 voter statistics and found that the consistent life ethic is difficult for religious leaders to promote because it combines the generally conservative anti-abortion stance with a liberal social attitude. ==Legal and political aspects== Democrats for Life of America demonstrates at the 2006 March for Life. The Republican Party platform officially advocates an anti-abortion position,2004 Republican Party Platform: A Safer World and a More Hopeful America p. 84. which developed alongside the modern pro-life movement. Before Roe v. Wade, the majority of Republicans were not anti-abortion, including most of the party's leadership, which typically cited abortion rights as included within an ideology of limited government and personal freedom. At the 1976 Republican National Convention, the party adopted an anti-abortion amendment as part of their platform, for strategic reasons. The party's leadership hoped to appeal to Catholics, a demographic which had traditionally voted Democratic, a party at the time containing fairly liberal economic views with mixed opinions on social ones, but who might be put off by growing cultural liberalism and who made up the core of the anti-abortion movement. Over time, the anti-abortion plank of the Republican platform became one rallying point for a growing conservative religious coalition in the party, which drove out many pro-choice Republicans and led to a long-term shift in the party's public image and identity. However, there are some pro-choice Republicans. The Republican group The Wish List supports pro-choice Republican women just as EMILY's List supports pro- choice Democratic women. The Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List) is dedicated to \\"increasing the percentage of anti-abortion women in Congress and high public office,\\"Its connected Candidate Fund increases the percentage of pro-life women in politics., http://www.suzyb.org/blog/Elections Retrieved September 25, 2008. and seeks to eliminate abortion in the U.S. The Democrats for Life of America are a group of anti-abortion Democrats on the political left who advocate for an anti-abortion plank in the Democratic Party's platform and for anti-abortion Democratic candidates. Former vice-presidential candidate Sargent Shriver, the late Robert Casey, a former two-term governor of Pennsylvania, and former Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich), a former leader of the bipartisan anti-abortion caucus in the United States House of Representatives, have been among the most well-known anti-abortion Democrats. However, following his vote in favor of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Marjorie Dannenfelser of the SBA List reported that her organization was revoking an anti-abortion award it had been planning to give to Stupak, and anti-abortion organizations accused Stupak of having betrayed the anti- abortion movement. The New York Times reported in 2011 that the anti-abortion movement in the United States had been undergoing a disagreement over tactics. Since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, the movement had usually focused on chipping away at Roe through incremental restrictions such as laws requiring parental consent or women to see sonograms, restricting late-term abortions, etc., with the goal of limiting abortions and changing \\"hearts and minds\\" until there is a majority on the Supreme Court to overturn Roe. However, some activists were calling for \\"an all-out legal assault on Roe. v. Wade\\", seeking the enactment of laws defining legal personhood as beginning at fertilization or prohibiting abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detectable at six to eight weeks in the hope that court challenges to such laws would lead the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. Such activists believed that then-Justice Anthony Kennedy, who nearly decided to overturn Roe in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, was open to rethinking Roe. Others feared that such a legal challenge would result in the solidification of the 1973 decision in Roe. Evangelical Christian groups tended to be in the former camp and Catholic groups in the latter. Among those who believe that abortion is murder, some believe it may be appropriate to punish it with death. While attempts to criminalize abortion generally focus on the doctor, Texas state Rep. Tony Tinderholt (R) introduced a bill in 2017 and 2019 that may enable the death penalty in Texas for women who have abortions, and the Ohio legislature considered a similar bill in 2018. ==Demographics== ===Within the movement=== Studies indicate that activists within the American anti-abortion movement are predominantly white and educated, with a majority of anti-abortion activism constituted by women. Scholars continue to dispute the primary factors that cause individuals to become anti-abortion activists. While some have suggested that a particular moral stance or worldview leads to activism, others have suggested that activism leads individuals to develop particular moral positions and worldviews. A 1981 survey of dues paying members of the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) by sociologist Donald O. Granberg found that survey respondents held conservative views on sex, sex education, and contraception. Additionally, Granberg's survey provided basic demographic characteristics of his sample: 98% of survey respondents were white, 63% were female, 58% had a college degree, and 70% were Catholic. Granberg concluded that conservative personal morality was the primary mechanism for explaining an individual's involvement in the anti-abortion movement. A 2002 study by Carol J.C. Maxwell drawing on decades of survey and interview data of direct-action activists within the anti-abortion movement found that 99% of the sample was white, 60% was female, 51% had a college degree, and 29% were Catholic. Like Granberg's 1981 study, Maxwell concluded that anti-abortion and abortion-rights activists held two different worldviews which in turn are formed by two different moral centers. More recently, sociologist Ziad Munson studied the characteristics of both activists and non-activists who considered themselves anti-abortion. The anti-abortion activists of Munson's sample were 93% white, 57% female, 66% Catholic, and 71% had a college degree. Of non-activists who considered themselves anti-abortion, Munson found that 83% were white, 52% were female, 45% were Catholic, and 76% had a college degree. In Munson's analysis personal moralities and worldviews are formed as a consequence of participation in anti-abortion activism. Munson's analysis differs from previous scholarly work in its assertion that beliefs result from activism rather than causing activism. For Munson, life course factors make an individual more or less likely to become an activist. ===Popular opinion=== A 2019 Gallup poll found that men and women in the United States generally hold similar abortion views: \\"19% of both men and women say abortion should be totally illegal; 31% of women and 26% of men want abortion to be totally legal.\\" In addition, 53% of men and 48% of women favored abortion being legal, but only under certain circumstances. Gallup polling in 2019 found that 25% of Americans believe abortion should be legal under any circumstances; 13%, under most circumstances; 39%, under only a few circumstances; and 21%, under no circumstances. A 2020 poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research similarly found that 37% of Americans believed abortion should be legal under only a few circumstances. This answer was provided by 45% of Catholics and 67% of white evangelical Protestants. In the Gallup poll, when respondents were first asked about the legality of abortion, 49% described themselves as \\"pro-life\\" and 46% as \\"pro-choice.\\" However, among people who were not asked about legality first, 43% described themselves as \\"pro-life\\" and 52% as \\"pro-choice.\\" Gallup's 2019 polling also found that 50% of Americans believe abortion to be morally wrong, while 42% believe it to be morally acceptable, and 6% believe that it depends on the situation. When asked whether the Supreme Court should reverse their 1973 decision of Roe v. Wade, 60% opined that the Court should not, while only 33% said that it should. Polling in 2020 revealed that 32% of Americans are either very or somewhat satisfied about abortion policies as they currently stand, while 24% report being dissatisfied and desire stricter policies and another 22% also express dissatisfaction but desire less strict policies.Abortion  Gallup Historical Trends According to a 2013 Gallup poll, 15% of Americans with no religious identity are anti-abortion and slight majorities of Catholics, Protestants, Southerners, seniors and nonwhites reported as anti-abortion. A 2019 Gallup poll found that Mormons, the Southern Baptist Convention, and Jehovah's Witnesses have the highest majorities who believe abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, while atheists, agnostics, and Jews have the highest majorities who think the reverse. == Controversies over terminology == Anti-abortion advocates tend to use terms such as \\"unborn baby\\", \\"unborn child\\", or \\"pre-born child\\",\\"The Roberts Court Takes on Abortion\\". New York Times. November 5, 2006. Retrieved January 18, 2008. and see the medical terms \\"embryo\\", \\"zygote\\", and \\"fetus\\" as dehumanizing.Brennan 'Dehumanizing the vulnerable' 2000 Protest outside clinic in the Bay Area, 1986. Both \\"pro- choice\\" and \\"pro-life\\" are examples of terms labeled as political framing: they are terms which purposely try to define their philosophies in the best possible light, while by definition attempting to describe their opposition in the worst possible light. \\"Pro-choice\\" implies that the alternative viewpoint is \\"anti-choice\\", while \\"pro-life\\" implies the alternative viewpoint is \\"pro- death\\" or \\"anti-life\\". In part due to this viewpoint, the Associated Press encourages journalists to use the terms \\"abortion rights\\" and \\"anti- abortion\\".Goldstein, Norm, ed. The Associated Press Stylebook. Philadelphia: Basic Books, 2007. In a 2009 Gallup Poll, a majority of U.S. adults (51%) called themselves \\"pro-life\\" on the issue of abortion—for the first time since Gallup began asking the question in 1995—while 42% identified themselves as \\"pro-choice\\", although pro-choice groups noted that acceptance of the \\"pro- life\\" label did not in all cases indicate opposition to legalized abortion, and that another recent poll had indicated that an equal number were pro- choice. A March 2011 Rasmussen Reports poll concluded that Americans are \\"closely divided between those who call themselves pro-life\\" and those who consider themselves as \\"pro-choice\\". In a February 2011 Rasmussen Reports poll of \\"Likely U.S. Voters\\", fifty percent view themselves as \\"pro-choice\\" and forty percent \\"say they are pro-life\\". In a July 2013 Rasmussen Reports poll of \\"Likely U.S. Voters\\", 46 percent view themselves as \\"pro-choice\\" and 43 percent \\"say they are pro-life\\". == Methods and activities == ===Demonstrations and protests=== * Mass demonstrations: every year, American anti-abortion advocates hold a March for Life in Washington, D.C., on January 22, the anniversary date of the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion in the United States. The event typically draws tens of thousands of attendees and, since 2003, frequently features notable politicians as speakers. Similar events take place on a smaller scale in other U.S. cities, such as the Walk for Life in San Francisco, California. * The life chain: The \\"Life Chain\\" is a public demonstration technique that involves standing in a row on sidewalks holding signs bearing anti-abortion messages. Messages include \\"Abortion Kills Children\\", \\"Abortion stops a beating heart\\" or \\"Abortion Hurts Women\\". Participants, as an official policy, do not yell or chant slogans and do not block pedestrians or roadways. Many Right to Life chapters hold Life Chain events yearlyhttp://nationallifechain.org Retrieved September 25, 2008. and the annual worldwide 40 Days for Life campaigns also use this technique. * The rescue: A \\"rescue operation\\" involves anti-abortion activists blocking the entrances to an abortion clinic in order to prevent anyone from entering. The stated goal of this practice is to force the clinic to shut down for the day. Often, the protesters are removed by law enforcement. Some clinics were protested so heavily in this fashion that they closed down permanently. \\"The rescue\\" was first attempted by Operation Rescue. Ever since President Bill Clinton signed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act into law, the rescue has become prohibitively expensive, and has rarely been attempted. * The truth display: Involves publicly displaying large pictures of aborted fetuses. Some anti-abortion groups believe that showing the graphic results of abortion is an effective way to dissuade and prevent others from choosing abortion. The Pro-Life Action League has used this form of activism in its Face the Truth displays. Members of one group, Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust, are known for setting up truth displays on university campuses. This group has faced legal battles over the use of such graphic imagery, and they have generated debate regarding the protection of such displays, by freedom of speech. \\"Truth displays\\" are controversial, even within the anti-abortion movement.Pavone, Frank A.\\"Should We Use Graphic Images?\\" Priests for Life Retrieved September 7, 2007. Quote: \\"Even among those who oppose abortion, answers to this question [Should we use graphic images?] vary\\". * Picketing: The majority of the facilities that perform abortions in the United States experience some form of protest from anti- abortion demonstrators every year, of which the most common form is picketing. In 2007, 11,113 instances of picketing were either reported to, or obtained by, the National Abortion Federation. ===Counseling=== * Sidewalk counseling: \\"Sidewalk counseling\\" is a form of anti-abortion advocacy which is conducted outside of abortion clinics. Activists seek to communicate with those entering the building, or with passersby in general, in an effort to persuade them not to have an abortion or to reconsider their position on the morality of abortion.Hill v. Colorado (98-1856) 530 U.S. 703 (2000). Retrieved December 13, 2006. They do so by trying to engage in conversation, displaying signs, distributing literature, or giving directions to a nearby crisis pregnancy center. ** The \\"Chicago Method\\" is an approach to sidewalk counseling that involves giving those about to enter an abortion facility copies of lawsuits filed against the facility or its physicians. The name comes from the fact that it was first used by Pro-Life Action League in Chicago.\\"Controversy in the Activist Movement\\", Pro-Life Action News, August 2000 The intent of the Chicago Method is to turn the woman away from a facility that the protesters deem \\"unsafe\\", thus giving her time to reconsider her choice to abort.\\"The \\"Chicago Method\\": Sidewalk Counseling that appeals to the Mother's concerns for her own well-being,\\" Priests for Life. * Crisis pregnancy centers: \\"Crisis pregnancy centers\\" are non-profit organizations, mainly in the United States, established to persuade pregnant women against having an abortion. These centers are typically run by anti-abortion Christians according to a conservative Christian philosophy, and they often disseminate false medical information, usually but not exclusively about the supposed health risks and mental health risks of abortion. The centers usually provide peer counseling against abortion, and sometimes also offer adoption referrals or baby supplies. Most are not licensed and do not provide medical services, though some offer sonograms, claiming that women who see such sonograms decide not to have an abortion. Legal and legislative action regarding CPCs has generally attempted to curb false or deceptive advertising undertaken in pursuit of the anti-abortion cause. Several thousand CPCs exist in the United States, often operating in affiliation with one of three umbrella organizations (Care Net, Heartbeat International, and Birthright International), with hundreds in other countries. By 2006, U.S. CPCs had received more than $60 million of federal funding, including some funding earmarked for abstinence-only programs, as well as state funding from many states. ===Specialty license plates=== In the United States, some states issue specialty license plates that have an anti- abortion theme. Choose Life, an advocacy group founded in 1997, was successful in securing an anti-abortion automobile tag in Florida. Subsequently, the organization has been actively helping groups in other states pursue \\"Choose Life\\" license plates.Burge, Kathleen: \\"Driving force\\" Boston Globe, May 5, 2006Madigan, Erin: \\"Choose Life Car Tags Spark Debate\\" Stateline.org, November 25, 2002 ==Abortion health risk claims== Some anti-abortion organizations and individuals disseminate false medical information and unsupported pseudoscientific claims about alleged physical and mental health risks of abortion. Many right-to-life organizations claim that abortion damages future fertility, or causes breast cancer, which is contradicted by the medical professional organizations. Some states, such as Alaska, Mississippi, West Virginia, Texas, and Kansas, have passed laws requiring abortion providers to warn patients of a link between abortion and breast cancer, and to issue other scientifically unsupported warnings. Some right-to-life advocacy groups allege a link between abortion and subsequent mental-health problems. \\"Currently, there are active attempts to convince the public and women considering abortion that abortion frequently has negative psychiatric consequences. This assertion is not borne out by the literature: the vast majority of women tolerate abortion without psychiatric sequelae.\\" Some U.S. state legislatures have mandated that patients be told that abortion increases their risk of depression and suicide, despite the fact that such risks are not supported by the bulk of the scientific literature, and are contradicted by mainstream organizations of mental-health professionals such as the American Psychological Association. ==Violence== Violent incidents directed against abortion providers have included arson and bombings of abortion clinics, and murders or attempted murders of physicians and clinic staff, especially the doctors that provide abortions. Acts of violence against abortion providers and facilities in North America have largely subsided following a peak in the mid-1990sViolence at US Abortion Clinics. which included the murders of Drs. David Gunn, John Britton, and Barnett Slepian and the attempted murder of Dr. George Tiller. Tiller was later murdered in his church in 2009. As of 1995, nearly all anti-abortion leaders said that they condemned the use of violence in the movement, describing it as an aberration and saying that no one in their organizations was associated with acts of violence. A small extremist element of the movement in the USA supports, raises money for, and attempts to justify anti-abortion violence, including murders of abortion workers, which this fringe element calls \\"justifiable homicides\\". An example of such an organization is the Army of God.James Risen and Judy L. Thomas: Wrath of Angels: The American Abortion War, Basic Books, 1998. Anti-abortion activists have also been the targets of violence, including the murder of Jim Pouillon.Memorial Held for Slain Anti-Abortion Protester Damien Cave; New York Times September 16, 2009 His killing is believed to be the first of someone protesting abortion ==See also== * Abortion law * Anti-abortion movements * Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act * Philosophical aspects of the abortion debate *180, a 2011 anti-abortion documentary ==References== ==Further reading== * Williams, Daniel K.

The first-year player draft is the primary mechanism of Major League Baseball for assigning amateur baseball players from high schools, colleges, and other amateur baseball clubs to its teams. The draft order is determined based on the previous season's standings, with the team possessing the worst record receiving the first pick. The first amateur draft was held in 1965. Unlike most sports drafts, the first-year player draft is held mid- season, in June. Another distinguishing feature of this draft in comparison with those of other North American major professional sports leagues is its sheer size: under the current collective bargaining agreement, the draft lasted until 40 rounds through 2019, plus compensatory picks. In contrast, the NFL draft lasts for seven rounds (a maximum of 256 selections), the NHL Entry Draft lasts for seven rounds and 217 picks, and the NBA draft lasts for only two rounds (60 selections). On March 26, 2020, MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) reached a deal that included the option to shorten that year's draft to five rounds, and halve the 2021 draft to 20 rounds. ==Before the draft== Major League Baseball has used a draft to assign minor league players to teams since 1921.Before the advent of the farm system, minor league players were under contract to their respective teams, rather than to a parent club. The minor league draft (known today as the Rule 5 draft) was later used to redistribute minor league players already under contract to major league teams. In 1936, the National Football League held the first amateur draft in professional sports.Staudohar, Lowenthal, and Lima, pp. 27-28. A decade later, the National Basketball Association instituted a similar method of player distribution. However, the player draft was controversial. Congressman Emanuel Celler questioned the legality of drafts during a series of hearings on the business practice of professional sports leagues in the 1950s.Hearings before the Antitrust Subcommittee, Committee on the Judiciary,, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. (1957) (testimonies of Chuck Bednarik, Red Grange, Kyle Rote, and Jackie Robinson). Successful clubs saw the draft as anti-competitive. Yankees executive Johnny Johnson equated it with communism. At the same time, Pulitzer Prize-winning sports columnist Arthur Daley compared the system to a \\"slave market.\\" Prior to the implementation of the first-year player draft, amateurs were free to sign with any Major League team that offered them a contract. As a result, wealthier teams such as the New York Yankees and St. Louis Cardinals were able to stockpile young talent, while poorer clubs were left to sign less desirable prospects. In 1947, Major League Baseball implemented the bonus rule, a restriction aimed at reducing player salaries, as well as keeping wealthier teams from monopolizing the player market. In its most restrictive form, it forbade any team which gave an amateur a signing bonus of more than $4,000 from assigning that player to a minor league affiliate for two seasons. If the player was removed from the major league roster, he became a free agent. The controversial legislation was repealed twice, only to be re-instituted. The bonus rule was largely ineffective. There were accusations that teams were signing players to smaller bonuses, only to supplement them with under-the-table payments. In one famous incident, the Kansas City Athletics signed Clete Boyer, kept him on their roster for two years, then traded him to the Yankees just as he became eligible to be sent to the minor leagues. Other clubs accused the Yankees of using the Athletics as a de facto farm team, and the A's later admitted to signing Boyer on their behalf. Finally, it was the bidding war for Rick Reichardt, who signed with the Los Angeles Angels for the then outrageous bonus of $200,000, that led to the implementation of the draft. Major League clubs voted on the draft during the 1964 Winter Meetings. Four teams—the New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, Los Angeles Dodgers, and New York Mets—attempted to defeat the proposal, but they failed to convince a majority of teams, and in the end only the Cardinals voted against it. ==The draft== Major League Baseball's first amateur draft was held on June 8–9, 1965, in New York City. Teams chose players in reverse order of the previous season's standings, with picks alternating between the National and American Leagues. With the first pick, the Kansas City Athletics took Rick Monday, an outfielder from Arizona State University. Originally, three separate drafts were held each year. The June draft, which was by far the largest, involved new high school graduates, as well as college seniors who had just finished their seasons. Another draft was held in January, which typically involved high school players who graduated in the winter, junior college players, and players who had dropped out of four-year colleges. Junior college players were required to wait until their current season was completed before they could sign. Finally, there was a draft in August for players who participated in amateur summer leagues. The August draft was eliminated after only two years, while the January draft lasted until 1986. ===Influence of the draftee's age=== Early on, the majority of players drafted came directly from high school. Between 1967 and 1971, only seven college players were chosen in the first round of the June draft. However, the college players who were drafted outperformed their high school counterparts by what statistician Bill James called \\"a laughably huge margin.\\"Staudohar, Lima, and Lowenthal, p. 39. By 1978, a majority of draftees had played college baseball, and by 2002, the number rose above sixty percent. While the number of high school players drafted has dropped, those picked have been more successful than their predecessors. In a study of drafts from 1984 to 1999, Baseball Prospectus writer Rany Jazayerli concluded that, by the 1990s, the gap in production between the two groups had nearly disappeared. In October 2011, Jazayerli presented another research study which included an analysis of those players drafted since 1965, but instead of breaking them into college or high school draftees, he segregated them by their age on draft day. In the study published in Baseball Prospectus, which included a follow up article of the financial benefits, Jazayerli concluded that the very young players return more value than expected by their draft slots. In Jazayerli's study he looked at the statistics and broke draftees into 5 distinctive groups based on their age and being drafted in the early rounds. Jazayerli's defined a “very young” player as those who are younger than 17 years and 296 days on draft day. Since the inception of the draft, the youngest player ever drafted in an early round is Alfredo Escalera. Escalera was drafted by the Kansas City Royals in the eighth round of the 2012 draft at 17 years and 114 days. Jazayerli's study does not clearly demonstrate the influence of the player's age when drafted in a late round. ===Economic impact=== Initially, the draft succeeded in reducing the value of signing bonuses. In 1964, a year before the first draft, University of Wisconsin outfielder Rick Reichardt was given a record bonus of $205,000 ($ today) by the Los Angeles Angels. Without competition from other clubs, the Athletics were able to sign Rick Monday for a bonus of only $104,000. It would take until 1979 for a drafted player to receive a bonus higher than Reichardt's.There is some disagreement over who was the first player to surpass Reichardt's bonus. Staudohar claims that Darryl Strawberry's 1980 bonus equaled Reichardt's, but it was actually worth only $200,000 ($ today). Jazayerli credits Andy Benes, who signed with the San Diego Padres for $235,000 ($ today) in 1988. Baseball America lists Todd Demeter, a career minor-leaguer drafted by the New York Yankees, as surpassing the milestone when he signed for a $208,000 ($ today) bonus in 1979. Player salaries continued to escalate through the 1980s. In 1986, Bo Jackson became the first draftee to sign a total contract (signing bonus and salary) worth over $1 million ($ today). Jackson, a Heisman Trophy-winning football player for Auburn University, was also the first overall choice in the National Football League draft, and was offered a $7 million ($ today) contract to play football for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. High school players possessed additional leverage, as they had the option of attending college and re-entering the draft the next year. Agent Scott Boras routinely exploited this advantage to increase the contracts of his clients. In 1990, Boras client Todd Van Poppel signed a $1.2 million ($ today) contract with Oakland Athletics, after committing to play for the University of Texas. The following year, Boras negotiated a $1.55 million ($ today) contract for Yankees first round pick Brien Taylor, who had said he would attend junior college if he did not receive a contract equal to Van Poppel's. By June 2009, a figure as high as $15 million was floated for collegian pitcher Stephen Strasburg. Increasingly, teams drafted based on whether or not a player was likely to sign for a particular amount of money, rather than on his talent. This became known as a \\"signability pick\\". Before the 1992 draft, team owners unilaterally decided to extend the period of time a team retained negotiating rights to a player from one year to five. In effect, the rule prohibited a high school draftee from attending college and re-entering the draft after his junior or senior seasons. The Major League Baseball Players Association filed a legal challenge, but Major League Baseball argued that, since the Players Association did not represent amateur players, it was not necessary for the union to agree to the change. An arbitrator ultimately decided that any change to draft articles must be negotiated with the Players Association.Staudohar, Lowenthal, and Lima, pp. 32-33. ===Media exposure=== The first-year player draft has historically had far less media exposure than its counterparts in the other leagues for three primary reasons: * High school and college baseball, the primary sources of MLB draftees, are not nearly as popular as college football, college basketball, and, in Canada and certain parts of the U.S., college and junior hockey. Consequently, most prospective top draft picks were unknown to the casual sports observer at the time of their draft. However, this is slowly changing: NCAA baseball has enjoyed a spike in popularity in the 2000s and top collegiate baseball players have enjoyed greater media exposure, though still far below that of their basketball and football counterparts. * Unlike top draft picks in the NHL, NBA, and NFL, all of whom are expected to make immediate impacts, top MLB draftees are nearly always assigned to the minor leagues for several years to hone their skills, usually at low levels (Rookie or Class A) initially. Due to this, fans cannot see the newly drafted players perform immediately, causing them to forget or lose interest in them. The entire 2007 first round (64 players) totaled one inning of major league playing time as of the end of the 2008 season; as of the 2009 season, the vast majority of 2008 first-rounders were still assigned to minor league organizations. In contrast, every first-round pick in the 2008 NFL draft had played in the league by the end of the 2008 season. *While many NHL, NBA, and NFL draftees will eventually reach their respective leagues, the vast majority of players selected in the first-year player draft will never play in a single MLB game, including many first-rounders. For example, only 31 of 52 first-round draft picks in the 1997 draft eventually made a big-league appearance, and only 13 of those 31 appeared in more than 100 games as of . In 1997's sixth round, only five of the 30 players selected eventually made a big league appearance, and only two of those five (Tim Hudson and Matt Wise) played more than 40 innings in the majors. Further illustrating the unpredictability of the draft's middle and later rounds, none of the 30 players selected in the 18th round ever reached the major leagues, but the 19th round eventually produced an all-star and World Series MVP, David Eckstein. Even stranger, Hall of Famer Mike Piazza was selected in the 62nd round, 1390th overall, of the 1988 draft. The 2007 draft was the first to be televised live, on June 7, 2007. The draft coverage took place at Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney World near Orlando, Florida. Since the 2009 draft, the first round of the draft has been broadcast annually on MLB Network live and in prime time from its studios in Secaucus, New Jersey. Starting in the 2021 draft, the event will take place during All-Star Weekend; all three days will take place during the festivities, set for July 11-13, 2021. ==Procedures and rules== ===Eligibility=== To be drafted, a player must fit the following criteria: * Be a resident of, or have attended an educational institution in, the United States, Canada, or a U.S. territory such as Puerto Rico. Players from other countries are not subject to the draft, and can be signed by any team unless they have attended an educational institution in the aforementioned areas. * Have never signed a major or minor league contract. * High school players are eligible only after graduation, and if they have not attended college. * Players at four-year colleges and universities are eligible three years after first enrolling in such an institution, or after their 21st birthdays (whichever occurs first). * Junior and community college players are eligible to be drafted at any time. ===Draft order=== The general draft order is the reverse order of the previous year's standings. If two teams finish with identical records, the previous year's standings of the two teams is the tiebreaker, with the team having a worse record receiving the higher pick. ===Negotiating rights=== Prior to 2007, a team retained the rights to sign a selected player until one week prior to the next draft, or until the player enters, or returns to, a four-year college on a full-time basis. This was known as the \\"draft-and-follow\\" procedure. Starting in 2012, the deadline for signing a drafted player is July 15. A selected player who enters a junior college cannot be signed until the conclusion of the school's baseball season. A player who is drafted and does not sign with the club that selected him may be drafted again at a future year's draft, so long as the player is eligible for that year's draft. A club may not select a player again in a subsequent year, unless the player has consented to the re-selection. A player who is eligible to be selected and is passed over by every club becomes a free agent and may sign with any club, up until one week before the next draft, or until the player enters, or returns to, a four-year college full-time or enters, or returns to, a junior college. In the one-week period before any draft, which is called the \\"closed period\\", the general rule is that no club may sign a new player. ===Compensatory picks=== Currently, teams can earn compensatory picks in the draft based on departing free agents who reject a Qualifying Offer from their respective team. A qualifying offer is defined as a one-year contract worth the average value of the top 120 player contracts for that year (in 2015, the value of the qualifying offer was $15.8 million). The 2013 draft saw major changes to the compensation rules. This was implemented as part of the most recent collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between MLB and its players' union, which took effect with the 2012 season. ==== Pre-2013 rules ==== Before the 2013 draft, free agents were ranked by the Elias Sports Bureau based on their previous two years of playing, and against players of similar positions. Players were categorized as either Type A or Type B, or fell into the category of all other players. Below is a description of each free agent class and the compensation the free agent's former team received when the player signed with a different team. • A Type A free agent was ranked in the top 20 percent of players at his position. A team that signed a Type A player gave its top draft pick to the club that the player left; that club also received a supplemental pick in the \\"sandwich\\" round between the first and second rounds. • A Type B free agent was ranked below the top 20 percent but in the top 40 percent of players at his position. A team that lost a Type B player received a supplemental pick, but the signing team did not lose a pick. • All other players carried no compensation at all. There had previously been a third class of \\"Type C\\" players, but that was eliminated in the 2007 CBA. To earn a compensatory pick, a free agent must have been either signed before the arbitration deadline in early December, or offered arbitration by their former team but still signed with another team. Compensatory picks that one team gave another via this method were the highest available pick that team had, with the exception of picks in the top half of the first round. These picks were protected from being used as compensation. If a team that picked in the top half of the first draft signed a Type A free agent, they would give up their second-round pick. If a team owed two other teams draft picks via Type A free agents, the team whose departing player had a higher score got the higher-ranked pick. A team could not lose picks it earned via compensation. The post-2012 rules for this aspect of the draft are similar, except that the \\"Type A\\" and \\"Type B\\" designations no longer exist (see below). The order of the supplemental round between the first and second rounds, a feature that will remain in place in 2013 and beyond, is determined by inverse order of the previous year's standings. Under pre-2013 rules, Type A picks were made first, and then the order reset for all the Type B compensation picks. In a feature that did not change with the most recent CBA in 2012, teams can also earn compensation for unsigned picks from the previous year's draft. If a team doesn't sign a first or second round pick, they will get to pick at the same slot plus one the following year. For example, if the team with the #5 pick does not sign that player, they would have the #6 pick the following year. The regular draft order would continue around those picks. For compensation for not signing a third round pick, teams would get a pick in a supplemental round between the third and fourth rounds. If a team fails to sign a player with one of these compensated picks, there is no compensation the following year. ====Current rules==== For the 2012 draft, the previous \\"Type A\\" and \\"Type B\\" designations remained in place, but the CBA included special provisions that modified the statuses of 11 players who were Type A free agents under the 2007 CBA. Six of these were \\"Modified Type A\\"—meaning that the signing team did not forfeit a draft pick, but the player's former team received a compensatory pick in the same position it would have earned under regular Type A rules. The remaining five were \\"Modified Type B\\", with compensation identical to that for other Type B free agents. Starting with the 2013 draft, free agents are no longer classified by \\"type\\". Instead, a team is only able to receive compensation if it makes its former player an offer at least equal to the average of the 125 richest contracts. However, if a player is traded during the final season of his contract, his new team will be ineligible to receive any compensation. ===Other changes from 2012=== The new CBA introduced other significant changes to the draft. ====Bonus pool==== From the 2012 draft on, each team is allocated a \\"bonus pool\\" from which it can offer initial contracts to its drafted players. Each team's pool is based on its draft position and number of picks, plus the amount spent in the previous year's draft. For the 2012 draft, these pools ranged from $4.5 million to $11.5 million. If a team goes over its threshold by 5 percent or less, it must pay a \\"luxury tax\\" of 75% on the amount over the threshold. Teams that go 5 to 10 percent over must pay a 100% tax on the excess, and will lose their next first-round pick. A team that goes 15 percent over can lose its next two first-round picks, in addition to the \\"luxury tax\\". These excess picks will go to smaller-revenue teams via a yet- to-be-reported formula. Uniquely, these compensatory picks can be traded—marking the first time MLB has allowed trading of draft picks. However, all previous rules against trading of regular picks, or picks awarded as free agent compensation, remain in force. ====New signing rules==== Teams can no longer offer major league contracts to their draft choices—only minor league contracts are available. The only exception is for drafted players who have scholarships in other sports. Also, the date for signing new picks has moved from mid-August to mid-July. However, deadline will be moved to early August in 2021 to compensate for the new date of the MLB Draft. ==See also== *List of first overall Major League Baseball draft picks *Rule 5 draft ==References== ==External links== *MLB.com official website *MLB.com – Draft history *MLB.com – Draft rules Category:Annual events in Major League Baseball Category:Annual sporting events in Canada Category:Annual sporting events in the United States Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1965 ","title":"Major League Baseball draft"},{"id":"2562523","text":"Empress Hotel may refer to: * Empress Hotel, Fitzroy North, Melbourne * Empress Hotel (Toronto), destroyed by fire * The Empress (hotel), Victoria, British Columbia * The Empress Hotel (New Jersey), in Asbury Park ","title":"Empress Hotel"},{"id":"2562544","text":"Legacy is a 2004 album by The Temptations for the Motown label, introducing new Temptations G.C.

It is the longest swing bridge in the world, with a span of . The bridge is no longer functional due to the expansion of the Suez Canal, as the parallel shipping lane completed in 2015 just east of the bridge lacks a structure spanning it. ==History== The first El Ferdan Railway Bridge over the Suez Canal was completed in April 1918 for the Sinai Military Railway.Hughes, 1981, page 17 It was considered a hindrance to shipping so after the First World War it was removed. A steel swing bridge was built in 1942 (during the Second World War), but this was damaged by a steamship and removed in 1947. A double swing bridge was completed in 1954 but the 1956 Anglo-Franco-Israeli war with Egypt severed rail traffic across the canal for a third time. A replacement bridge was completed in 1963 which was destroyed in 1967 in the Six-Day War by the Egyptian engineering General Ahmed Hamdy. In July 1996, a consortium led by German Krupp was awarded a $US70 million contract to design and build the bridge, raised to $80 million to increase the main span from . The current bridge was constructed in 2001. ==Significant developments in the region== The El Ferdan Railway Bridge was part of a major drive to develop the areas surrounding the Suez Canal, including other projects such as the Ahmed Hamdi Tunnel under the Suez Canal (completed in 1983), the Suez Canal overhead powerline crossing, and the Suez Canal Bridge (completed in 2001, roughly 12 miles north of the El Ferdan Railway Bridge). ==The bridge today: plans for upgrading tracks and building a new bridge== The parallel New Suez Canal was excavated in 2014/2015 a short distance to the east but without a bridge spanning it.Videos of the inauguration can be seen on various media and this bridge doesn't appear. Without a second bridge, the railway across El Ferdan bridge is a dead end. Initially, a plan was in place to construct a new railway tunnel in the Ismailia region (and another near Port Said) is planned in order to reconnect the Sinai to the rest of Egypt’s rail network. However, Kamel ElWazir, who was - at that time - the head of the Egyptian Armed Forces - Engineering corps, announced that due to high costs the plans for a new tunnel would be scrapped and that the Engineering Corps would seek other alternatives including moving the existing bridge to a narrow section of the canal at El-Qantara.In Arabic: كامل الوزير: إلغاء مخطط إقامة أنفاق السكة الحديد أسفل قناة السويس.

Released in 1915, it is a slight departure from the tramp character, as Charlie Chaplin plays a janitor to a bank. Edna Purviance plays the secretary on whom Charlie has a crush and dreams that she has fallen in love with him. Filmed at the Majestic Studio in Los Angeles. There doesn't appear to be any evidence that this film was received any differently from the bulk of Chaplin's early work, but today this film is often considered one of his best efforts during his Essanay period. Screenshot from the film ==Synopsis== Charlie, feeling very important, enters the bank where he works. He descends to the vault and works its combination with great panache and opens the door. Charlie hangs his coat inside the vault and brings out his mop and bucket signifying he is the bank's janitor. He causes typical havoc with his mop and then with his broom. Charlie discovers a package with a note attached to it written by the bank's stenographer. It is addressed \\"To Charles with love from Edna.\\" Charlie jumps to the wrong conclusion that Edna is in love with him, not realizing the package is intended for another Charles—the cashier. Charlie gets a bunch of flowers and places them lovingly on Edna's desk. When Edna realizes they are from the janitor, she coldly tosses them into the wastebasket. Charlie finds them there and is heartbroken. Charlie then has a dream in which he heroically thwarts a bank robbery, rescuing Edna in the process.

It was first described in 1979, after Salla, a municipality in Finnish Lapland. Salla disease is one of 40 Finnish heritage diseases and affects approximately 130 individuals, mainly from Finland and Sweden. ==Presentation== Individuals with Salla disease may present with nystagmus in the first months of life as well as hypotonia, reduced muscle tone and strength, and cognitive impairment. The most severely impaired children do not walk or acquire language, but the typical patient learns to walk and speak and has normal life expectancy. The MRI shows arrested or delayed myelination. ==Genetics== Salla disease has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. SD is caused by a mutation in the SLC17A5 gene, located at human chromosome 6q14-15. This gene codes for sialin, a lysosomal membrane protein that transports the charged sugar, N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid), out of lysosomes. The mutation causes sialic acid to build up in the cells. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 6 is an autosome), and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder. ==Diagnosis== A diagnosis of this disorder can be made by measuring urine to look for elevated levels of free sialic acid. Prenatal testing is also available for known carriers of this disorder. ==Treatment== There is no cure for Salla disease. Treatment is limited to controlling the symptoms of this disorder. Anti- convulsant medication may control seizure episodes. Physical therapists can assist an affected individual to build muscle strength and coordination. ==Prognosis== The life expectancy for individuals with Salla disease is between the ages of 50 and 60. ==See also== * Infantile free sialic acid storage disease (ISSD) ==References== == External links == * GeneReview/NIH/UW entry on Free Sialic Acid Storage Disorders Category:Autosomal recessive disorders Category:Rare diseases Category:Glycoprotein metabolism disorders Category:Membrane transport protein disorders ","title":"Salla disease"},{"id":"2562636","text":"Husain Ar-Radi (1924, Najaf – 24 February 1963, Baghdad), also known as Hashiim, 'Ammar, and Salam Adil, was an Iraqi communist politician as well as a poet and painter. He was the leader of the Iraqi Communist Party from 1955 until his death by execution or under torture after the Baathist coup in 1963. ==Early life== Husain al-Radi was born into a Shia Muslim family of sayyids in southern Iraq in 1924. His father was a junior clerk in a flour mill. Al-Radi trained as a teacher at the Elementary Teachers' College in Baghdad, where he first came into contact with the Communist Party in 1943. After graduating, he was appointed to a school in Diwaniya but was dismissed in 1946 on account of his political activities. He then moved to Baghdad, where he made a living selling grilled meat on the streets. Muhammad's descendants through Fatimah are known as sharifs, syeds or sayyids. These are honorific titles in Arabic, sharif meaning 'noble' and sayed or sayyid meaning 'lord' or 'sir'. As Muhammad's only descendants, they are respected by both Sunni and Shi'a, though the Shi'as place much more emphasis and value on their distinction.[156] ==Party activity, 1949-1955== In January 1949, al-Radi was arrested at a demonstration and imprisoned. On his release in 1951, he was appointed comrade in charge of the southern division of the Iraqi Communist Party, and in 1953 he became a member of the party's Central Committee. In that year, he represented Iraq at the second London Conference of Communist Parties in the Sphere of British Imperialism. That same year, following the arrest of party secretary Baha al-Din Nuri, Abd al-Karim Ahmad al-Daud became party secretary and began to promote a far-left line as well as a considerable level of confrontational activity. Al-Radi opposed this line and in September the party agreed a more moderate policy, but on 16 June 1954 hardliner Hamid Uthman escaped from Kut jail and succeeded in reimposing the far-left line. He was elected party secretary in place of Al-Daud. Uthman accused al-Radi of rightist deviationism and had him expelled from the Central Committee. The latter then moved to the mid-Euphrates region. ==Secretary of the Iraqi Communist Party== Al-Radi was recalled by the Central Committee in June 1955, after it removed Uthman from the secretariat. His more moderate line, focused on an alliance with all potential progressive and national forces, seemed more likely to yield results; in any case, the series of confrontations with the police which Uthman had incited had greatly weakened the organisation and were clearly not sustainable. Al-Radi reorganised the Central Committee, and the following year succeeded in reuniting the party, bringing two dissident groups back into the fold. Al-Radi's moderate approach was similar to that of Khalid Bakdash, secretary of the Syrian Communist Party and elder statesman of Arab communism. During the period 1955-1959, the Iraqi party was closer to Bakdash than at any other point. Al-Radi himself was not by inclination a theoretician, preferring to concentrate on party organisation and action; until 1961, he would be content to leave ideological questions primarily to Amir Abdallah, who was the party's dominant intellectual figure during this period and rather more cautious than al-Radi in his political approach. ==The Qasim regime== This divergence of approach between al-Radi and Abdallah first became a serious issue in the aftermath of the 1958 coup that brought Abd al- Karim Qasim to power. The two men agreed on the party's position of support for the new government, which they considered potentially progressive and representative of the progressive national bourgeois elements in Iraqi society. However, Qasim's harsh reaction to the party's demand for a share in government in May 1959 brought about disagreement between them, with Abdallah favouring compromise and al-Radi pushing for a more radical approach. The party suffered something of a crisis in the summer of 1959, with a minor crackdown by Qasim coinciding with the disturbances of July 1959 in Kirkuk, for which the Communists were widely blamed. A party plenum resulted in a victory for the right wing: it approved a highly self-critical report, published in the party newspaper Ittihad ash-Sha'ab. Al-Radi remained the nominal party leader, but his position as secretary was changed to that of first secretary, with three assistant secretaries appointed who were all close to Abdallah. In the spring of 1960 the party came under renewed attack from Qasim, with Ittihad ash-Sha'ab banned first intermittently and finally completely. Communist supporters were removed from positions of influence in the government, party-backed organisations which provided a crucial element in its abilities to mobilize the masses were suppressed to a greater or lesser degree and thousands of Communist workers dismissed from their jobs. In November 1961 al-Radi struck back against his opponents in the party, and took full control. The \\"rightist\\" line was denounced, Abdallah left for Eastern Europe, and the three assistant secretaries were removed from the Central Committee. However, with the party increasingly weak, al-Radi himself saw no alternative to a continued policy of critical support for Qasim, despite a renewed wave of repression in May 1962 following Communist-led demonstrations against the Kurdish war. In late 1962, the Kurdish Democratic Party suggested that the Communists collaborate with them in a coup attempt, but the latter rejected the idea. In January 1963, they warned Qasim that plans were afoot for a nationalist coup. The Baathist coup of 8 February 1963 came as no surprise to the Communists, but they were unable to mobilize their supporters in the armed forces to oppose it effectively. Al-Radi reacted immediately by drawing up an appeal for mass resistance to the coup, and Communist supporters defended poorer districts of Baghdad against the new government until 10 February, suffering heavy losses. ==Capture and death== The new regime was quick to act against the Communists, capturing many of them and killing hundreds either in the fighting or in its jails and torture chambers. Al-Radi was captured on 20 February, and executed by hanging soon afterwards, of which the Government officially announced. There is an opinion that he died under torture four days after his arrest without divulging any information. ==Personal life== In 1953, Al-Radi married Thamina Naji Yousseff, a communist and feminist activist, and had three children with her: Iman Husain Ahmed Al- musawi, Shatha Husain Ahmed Al-Musawi and Ali Husain Ahmed Al-Moussaoui. ==See also== * Iraqi art * Islamic art * List of Iraqi artists ==Sources== * The Old Social Classes and New Revolutionary Movements of Iraq, Hanna Batatu, London, al-Saqi Books, 2000.

The company merged with Mellon Financial in 1994, and then became a subsidiary of Bank of New York Mellon when Mellon Financial and The Bank of New York merged in 2007. As a BNY Mellon company, Dreyfus provides access to its global network of asset managers, delivering investment insight and products — equity, fixed income, global/international and money market mutual funds, separately managed accounts, retirement and cash management strategies, asset allocation solutions and brokerage services. Dreyfus products are delivered through a variety of distribution channels: intermediary (advisor-sold), institutional, and retail direct. == History== The firm's origin dates back to 1947, when investor Jack Dreyfus founded a brokerage house in New York City named Dreyfus & Co. In 1951, attracted by the concept of mutual funds, Dreyfus & Co. purchased a small management company named John G. Nesbett & Co., Inc. with a small common stock fund called The Nesbett Fund Incorporated. Nesbett & Co. was renamed The Dreyfus Corporation, and The Nesbett Fund became The Dreyfus Fund Incorporated. Going public in 1965, Dreyfus was among the first money management firms to tap into the stock market for additional capital. In 1976, Dreyfus was among the first fund companies to introduce an incorporated tax- exempt municipal bond fund. In 1994, Dreyfus completed its landmark merger with Mellon Bank Corporation, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Mellon Financial Corporation. The merger, a milestone in the history of financial services in the United States, was at the time the largest-ever combination of a bank and mutual fund company. On July 1, 2007, The Bank of New York Company, Inc. and Mellon Financial Corporation merged to form a new company The Bank of New York Mellon, one of the world's largest global asset management and serving company.

He trademarked the term \\"neo soul.\\" Massenburg is the founder, president and CEO of Kedar Entertainment. ==Early life and education== William \\"Kedar\\" Massenburg was born in 1963. Massenburg is a 1981 graduate of Erasmus Hall High School in Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York and a 1986 graduate of Central State University in Wilberforce, Ohio. ==Career== After college, Massenburg spent several years in marketing positions, including two years as a district manager for PepsiCo (maker of Pepsi Cola), and a year with SmithKline Beecham Clinical Labs Pharmaceuticals.Black Enterprise, November 1994, p. 128 In 1995, he established Kedar Entertainment, originating out of his New York home, with a $1,700 outlay from his own pocket and consisted of a desk set, fax machine, copier, and portable phone. He became President and CEO. Involved in artist management, he directed the career of the pioneering rap group Stetsasonic for a time. By 1994, Massenburg was negotiating artist contracts to the tune of more than $1 million a year. His own salary was in six figures, and he had hired two assistants, one of them working out of a satellite office in Los Angeles. Massenburg later expanded his activities into production, music publishing, and publicity. Massenburg was also responsible for signing the young rapper A+, and Freestyle Fellowship as well as Erykah Badu to their first major recording contracts. He was also involved in the production of Chico Debarge's Long Time No See album which received high acclaim after Debarge's release from prison. ===D'Angelo=== Massenburg started managing the soul singer D'Angelo. The singer's debut single \\"Brown Sugar\\" had done well at radio on Massenburg's East Coast home turf, but had failed to get crucial West Coast airplay. EMI worked with Massenburg and flew dozens of West Coast radio programmers and their dates, into New York for a D'Angelo performance, and for upscale dining and lodging accommodations. He later told the Minneapolis Star Tribune, \\"Was it worth it to spend the money to fly all those programmers in? Absolutely! We saw a substantial increase in radio airplay immediately after the show.\\"Star-Tribune (Minneapolis, Minnesota), January 8, 1996, p.

The current bridge opened to traffic on August 28, 2015 Proposals for the new bridge were discussed for many years, starting no later than 1975. The Massachusetts Highway Department (MHD) replaced the third Berkley–Dighton Bridge because it was seriously structurally deficient, its swing span gears often jammed in the open position, forcing travelers miles to the north or south, and due to the inability for the bridge to handle emergency vehicles. The MHD estimates (2001 data) that 6,200 cars crossed the bridge each day. Bridge upgrade plans were met with opposition for a variety of reasons, including concerns about the impact on local traffic. Commercial trucks were not allowed to use the old bridge.

He also appeared in the chat show The Thoughts of Chairman Alf. The character was created by Johnny Speight and played by Warren Mitchell. In a 2001 poll conducted by Channel 4, Alf Garnett was ranked 49th on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. ==Character== ===History=== Alf Garnett was born in Wapping around 1917. He was unpopular as a youth and it was said he only began going out with his wife Else, whom he had known since they were children, as a result of his mother's intervention. A two-year courtship followed during the first part of World War II and the pair married in 1941 (the film Till Death Us Do Part (1968) showed the couple marrying in 1939, but the actual series always stated them to have been married in 1941). Alf was called up for military service in 1940 but got out of it by claiming he was in a Reserved Occupation. Alf and Else had a daughter, Rita, by 1942 and raised her in the slums of Wapping at 25 Jamaica Street, E1, where Alf worked on the docks and Else stayed home and tended to the house. Rita married her \\"long-haired layabout\\" socialist boyfriend Mike in 1966 shortly after the general election of 31 March, and they moved into the Wapping house. Alf and Mike rarely got along; the only time they saw eye to eye was when they both went to the 1966 World Cup Final, England vs. West Germany. Around 1968, according to the film The Alf Garnett Saga, despite resistance from Alf, the Garnetts were rehoused in a tower block in a new town on the edge of London, probably in Essex. Alf continued to work on the docks in London despite the long commute. Alf was still proud when the couple had a son together in September 1972. There was some speculation by Else that Mike was not the child's father but instead, the singer Kenny Lynch with whom Rita had had a brief relationship. Else eventually left Alf in 1974 and moved to Australia to live with her sister Maud, whom Alf hated. She later wired Alf in 1975 on his birthday asking him for a divorce. The same day, Alf lost his job. Sometime between 1975 and 1981, Mike and Rita moved back to Liverpool and Alf and Else reconciled and sold their Wapping house and moved to Eastbourne with their widowed neighbour Min. Rita visited and Alf was horrified to see his grandson, now a teenager (albeit being born in 1972, his age is inconsistent between series), was a punk rocker. Between 1981 and 1985, the Garnetts moved back to the East End to a small house and Min stayed behind with her sister Gwenyth. Else became ill and needed to use a wheelchair. Else died in September 1986 and Alf, after years of poor treatment of his wife, was devastated at her death. He later got involved with and nearly married his upstairs neighbour, Mrs. Hollingberry. They later broke it off, but remained good friends. In 1998, Alf was still living in the East End and Miss Hollingberry was still his neighbour. ===Personality=== In the episode 'State Visit' (20 February 1967) Alf gives his full name as Alfred Edward Garnett. Alf was a working class man, forever complaining that he worked and worked and yet lived somewhere near the poverty line, and was a staunch supporter of the Conservative Party, although he didn't support one-time leader Margaret Thatcher, because he believed that a woman's place was at home \\"chained to the bloody kitchen sink!\\" and blamed Thatcher's husband Denis for not telling her \\"to keep her place\\". He did not admire \\"grammar school boy\\" Edward Heath, her predecessor, either. His biggest reason for being a Conservative was not that he loved and admired the party, but that he fully rejected the policy of the Labour Party, believing them to pretend to represent the working classes, whilst all they would do when in power is feather their own nests. He was also an admirer of the Queen and the Royal Family. This, however, did not stop him from criticising them when he thought they deserved it. His biggest passion in life though, was his local football team West Ham United.BBC - Cult - I Love Til Death Us Do Part Generally Alf blamed his problems on everybody but himself. His family was the usual target of his anger and frustration. In the shows, Garnett was regularly ridiculed for his illogical views and hypocrisy by his family, but he stubbornly refused to admit he was wrong. Alf was mean and selfish towards his emotionally detached wife, Else played by Dandy Nichols, referring to her as a \\"silly old moo\\". Else usually turned a deaf-ear to most of Alf's rantings, but if he got too personal she would come up with a sharp retort to put him firmly in his place. In the sequel series In Sickness and In Health Else needed to use a wheelchair, and Alf grumbled about having to care for her. When Dandy Nichols died in 1986, the character of Else was killed off. Alf always treated his wife appallingly but after she died the viewers could see that he genuinely missed her. Alf was outraged when his daughter, Rita played by Una Stubbs, decided to marry Michael, her long-haired, unemployed boyfriend played by Antony Booth. Michael is from Liverpool and a Catholic of Irish descent; precisely the type of person Alf most hated. He often called him the \\"Randy Scouse Git\\". This terminology was later picked up by the American pop group The Monkees for their song, \\"Randy Scouse Git\\", included on their 1967 album Headquarters. Alf and Michael had different political views and much of the programme turned on their heated political debates. Writer Johnny Speight often commented that the character was supposed to be a figure of ridicule, but admitted that not all viewers saw the satiric elements of the character.\\"Till Death Us Do Part\\" by John Burke at TrashFiction.comTill Death Us Do Part at The Museum of Broadcast Communications Speight defended the Alf Garnett character, saying: \\"If you do the character correctly, he just typifies what you hear - not only in pubs but in golf clubs around the country. To make him truthful he's got to say those things, and they are nasty things. But I feel as a writer that they should be out in the open so we can see how daft these comparisons are.\\"BBC News: \\"Tribute to Alf Garnett's creator\\" Mitchell left the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art with a trained actor's voice. A lifelong, committed socialist, he sold socialist newspapers on street corners, shouting his wares in his beautifully trained voice. It was only when he realised why people weren't buying his newspapers that he developed Alf's voice, to appear more \\"working class\\". Mitchell stated that he became tired of always being associated with Alf Garnett, but enjoyed playing the part and appreciated the debt he owed to the character. In the late 1980s, the Museum of the Moving Image in London staged an Alf Garnett exhibition where visitors pressed buttons representing particular social problems and were presented with Alf giving his opinions on the subject. The American version of Till Death Do Us Part, All in the Family, featured Archie Bunker as Garnett's analog. Like Garnett in British popular culture, Bunker became an icon in American popular culture for his very conservative views, although the Bunker character was portrayed as somewhat more likable than Garnett ever was. Bunker, in turn, served as an inspiration for Eric Cartman of South Park. The German version of the show, Ein Herz und eine Seele, featured Alfred Tetzlaff as Garnett's analog, although Tetzlaff was also designed as a parody of Adolf Hitler. In the movie Till Death Us Do Part, Alf receives a letter advising him that he has been called up to go to war. However, the letter which is shown on screen is addressed to Alfred Garnet with only one T. Later in the film, Alf says that the call-up papers were a mistake because he was in a Reserved Occupation and thus ineligible for service, so possibly the authorities had confused him with someone with a similar name. In the TV series and films, Alf is always shown as a pipesmoker, usually smoking a Straight Billiard type pipe. The character was a staunch defender of smoking and Warren Mitchell himself received the award of Pipe Smoker of the Year in 1967 for services to pipesmoking. ==References to Alf Garnett in politics== The character's name has become a standard description of anyone ranting at the world in general, and has even found its way into politics, Oswald Mosley dismissing Enoch Powell after his Rivers of Blood speech as \\"a Middle Class Alf Garnett\\",\\"Sir Oswald Mosley: Blackshirt – Stephen Dorril\\", Spike Magazine, 10 December 2007 former Prime Minister Harold Wilson also criticising Powell for making Alf Garnett 'politically articulate' and conferring upon him 'a degree of political respectability' Harold Wilson, The Labour Government 1964-1970: A Personal Record (Weidenfeld & Nicolson and Michael Joseph, London, 1971), p. 525 Denis Healey accusing Margaret Thatcher of possessing \\"the diplomacy of Alf Garnett\\"Britain Since the Seventies, Jeremy Black, Reaktion Books 2004 and more recently has been used in criticism of politicians such as Ken Livingstone\\"Alf Garnett at the city hall\\" by Hugh Muir, The Guardian, 21 June 2006 and John Reid.BBC News: \\"Reid targets illegal immigrants\\", 7 March 2007 On 9 June 2010 during Prime Minister's questions David Cameron referred to Ed Balls as \\"the new Alf Garnett of British politics\\" following his comments on immigration.BBC News: \\"Prime Minister's Question\\", 9 June 2010 ==References== ==External links== Garnett, Alf Category:Television characters introduced in 1965 Category:Fictional English people Category:Fictional people from London Category:Till Death Us Do Part ","title":"Alf Garnett"},{"id":"2562742","text":"New Primitivism (Serbo-Croatian: Novi primitivizam) was a subcultural movement established in Sarajevo, SR Bosnia-Herzegovina, SFR Yugoslavia in March 1983. It primarily used music, along with satire, sketch and surreal comedy on radio and television, as its form of expression. Its protagonists and followers called themselves the new primitives. Functioning as a banner that summarizes and encompasses the work of two rock bands Zabranjeno Pušenje and Elvis J. Kurtović & His Meteors as well as Top lista nadrealista radio segment that eventually grew into a television sketch show, the discourse of New Primitivism was seen as primarily irreverent and humorous. The movement officially disbanded sometime in 1987, although the bands and television show continued for a few more years after that—Elvis J. Kurtović & His Meteors until 1988, Zabranjeno Pušenje until 1990, and Top lista nadrealista until 1991. ==Characteristics== Basing itself on the spirit of the Bosnian ordinary populace outside of the cultural mainstream, the movement was credited for introducing the jargon of Sarajevo mahalas (brimming with slang and Turkish loanwords) into the official Yugoslav public scene. Many of the New Primitivism songs and sketches involve stories of small people—retirees/pensioners, coalminers, petty criminals, street thugs, provincial girls, etc.—being placed in unusual and absurd situations. Stylistically, the New Primitives' methods drew comparisons to Monty Python's Flying Circus, sharing the short sketch form and utilizing absurdity as means of eliciting laughs from an audience. The embodiment of New Primitivism is a youth who both reads challenging works such as Hegel's The Phenomenology of Spirit, but also does not mind getting into fistfights. The movement got established as a Sarajevan reaction to the New wave and Punk movements that were sweeping the alternative music scene in Yugoslavia. Some of the movement's most notable traits were promoting and popularizing Sarajevan street jargon and slang that was not well known outside of Sarajevo, extolling the mentality and culture of the Sarajevan Mahala, depicting local fringe characters such as petty criminals, alcoholics, lesser-known pop-cultural figures, blue-collar workers, and local streets hoodlums. Because of this, the movement was considered a locally patriotic and eclectic expression of Sarajevan urban culture. The movement's protagonists had a specific view of New Primitivism. Perhaps the most prominent of them, Nele Karajlić, explicated it as being \\"created within clearly defined historical coordinates, both spatially and temporally, at the precise midpoint between the spot where Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand in June 1914 and the spot where the Olympic flame was lit in February 1984 while temporally, it took place sometime during the period between Tito's death in May 1980 and the beginning of the Agrokomerc Affair in 1987\\" and seeing it as \\"resistance to any form of establishment – cultural, social, and political – not just the rock'n'roll one that dominated Sarajevo at the time with so-called 'dinosaur' bands like Bijelo Dugme and Indexi, which the new primitives held in contempt to a certain extent\\".Glavni tok;RTV Pink, 1990s The movement's dominant method of social and cultural critique was to fully localize the narrative to Sarajevo, and use local urban legends, cultural and social phenomena and living fringe characters as catalysts for painting a wider political picture. In doing so, the movement became both a rigidly local expressional form that gave a platform to the language, culture and myths of the Sarajevan streets, while also breaking out into the wider Yugoslav arena. A major characteristic of the movement was the adoption of pseudonyms by all its leading figures, which tended to be either comical in nature or based on the semantics of nicknames that have always been very prevelent in Sarajevo. The main reason for this was so that none of the members could be ethnically identified. The second reason was to give a platform to the stylization of nicknames that was prominent in Sarajevo—a form of local patriotism and self-mockery. The movement's \\"chief ideologue\\" referred to New Primitivism simply as \\"the first Sarajevan bullet to hit its target since Princip assassinated Ferdinand in 1914\\". ==Origin of the term== The movement's name was introduced as a mock reaction to two early 1980s pop-culture movements: New Romanticism in the West and Neue Slowenische Kunst in the Yugoslav constituent republic of SR Slovenia. On one hand, the term New Primitivism was a clear anti-reference to New Romantic, as the Sarajevo lads sought to be anything but romantic and sugar-sweet while on the other hand, they also wanted to emphasize the stereotypes encountered in many popular Yugoslav jokes about Bosnians and Slovenians—the former portrayed as raw, unsophisticated, dim-witted, and openhearted, and the latter presented as stiff, cold, serious, distant, and calculated. In the artistic and expressional sense, New Primitivism was a reaction to the New wave and Punk movements. ==History== During the late 1970s and early 1980s, a generation of kids from the Sarajevo neighbourhood of Koševo, all born in the early to mid-1960s, was coming up. Raised within upper-middle-class families inhabiting post-World War II apartment buildings typical of communist Yugoslavia, their interests included music, football, and movies. They soon converged on music as their main activity and simultaneous with entering high school started forming bands despite possessing very limited musical skills. Most of their musical influences were found in Western popular culture—from early ones such as Jerry Lee Lewis, Lou Reed, the Rolling Stones, The Who, etc. to those found later on the emerging punk scene. By early 1980, the kids were able to adapt a cellar at the 19 Fuada Midžića Street low-rise apartment building into a makeshift rehearsal space where they held band practices, chamber plays, even an odd fashion show. Initially very informal with irregular rehearsals and frequently changing lineups (often through swapping band members), by 1981, the bands—named Zabranjeno Pušenje and Elvis J. Kurtović & His Meteors—took on a more serious note. Adopting garage/punk rock sensibility, they started devoting more attention to songwriting and began playing small clubs around town. In parallel, from May 1981, some of the kids from both bands got a chance to collaborate on Top lista nadrealista, a comedy segment on Primus radio show that aired weekly, Saturday mornings, on Radio Sarajevo's channel two. ===1982–1983: Forming a movement=== The idea to create a movement as an umbrella entity encompassing their entire activity had been tossed about for months during the second part of 1982 and early 1983 between the individuals in and around Elvis J. Kurtović & His Meteors—the band's manager Malkolm Muharem, its main lyricist and mascot Elvis J. Kurtović, and its singer Rizo Petranović—who had come up with the New Primitivism Manifesto printed in 1982 in a local fanzine. Additional notable members of the movement included dr. Nele Karajlić, mr. Sejo Sexon, Dražen Ričl, Boris Šiber, Zenit Đozić, and others from the Sarajevo neighbourhood of Koševo. Along the way, individuals outside of the Koševo milieu, most notably Branko \\"Đuro\\" Đurić, joined in and also became prominent. Despite being a bit older and not from the same neighbourhood, film director Emir Kusturica (who was already well-established with his award-winning movie Sjećaš li se Doli Bel?) was an associate and friend of the crew; although his movies can not be directly associated with the movement, their spirit certainly shares some sentiment with New Primitivism. With the bands playing small demo gigs around the city, they encountered other up and coming rock bands such as Plavi orkestar and Crvena jabuka that also cultivated similar thematic narratives focused on stories of local small time characters, but would eventually move away from the aesthetic and turn towards the mainstream. The movement's wider unofficial unveiling was said to have taken place at an Elvis J. Kurtović & His Meteors gig in Sarajevo's CEDUS club venue during early March 1983. Also playing the gig was Zabranjeno Pušenje. Influenced by movies like 1979's Quadrophenia that portray the youth scene of London with subcultures like mods, rockers, and teddy boys, the guys from Koševo tried to create their own local version of that.Damar Show;Pink BH, 2009 The formal introduction of the new entity changed nothing in the internal group dynamic as they all continued functioning like a neighbourhood gang of friends, but it gave the press something to latch onto and made it easier to market the bands outside of the city. By his own admission, Muharem used the movement \\"to create an impression to those in Belgrade and Zagreb that there's something more going on in Sarajevo than there actually is\\".Rockovnik – 24. episode Anarhija All over Bascarsija;RTS, 2004 In addition to music and comedy on radio, the lads decided to expand their modes of expression now that they functioned as a movement—attempting to come up with a clothing style to associate with New Primitivism. The movement's unofficial look was thus born with a démodé style consisting of waist tight bell-bottom pants, plaid suit jackets, thin golden necklace worn above the shirt, and pointy shoes (the so-called špicoke)—similar to the 1970s leisure suit look—which the lads adopted from petty hoodlums and small-time smugglers and pickpockets seen around Baščaršija selling, though not wearing, clothing items such as Levi's 501 jeans that were either smuggled in from Italy or counterfeit locally in Yugoslavia. Elvis J. Kurtović & His Meteors especially embraced this throwback look, with young crowds soon showing up to their club gigs dressed this way. Meanwhile, Karajlić came up with the movement's unofficial creed: \\"Tuđe hoćemo, svoje nemamo\\" (\\"What's not ours, we want; because ours, we haven't got.\\"), a parody on one of the often used political slogans of the communist period: \\"Tuđe nećemo, svoje ne damo.\\" (\\"What's not ours, we don't want; ours, we won't give up on.\\"). One of the first activities on the movement's behalf was writing an open letter to Sarajevo's Goran Bregović, the best known and most established rock musician in Yugoslavia, who was at the moment going through a well- documented creative and commercial crisis with his band Bijelo Dugme's latest studio effort getting poor reviews and selling underwhelmingly, as well as reports of infighting and vocalist Željko Bebek's imminent departure. Dripping with jovial sarcasm and backhanded compliments, the new primitives' letter invited Bregović to join them, offering him a fresh start along with a creative reset. ===1983–1984: Elvis J. Kurtović & His Meteors get the ball rolling=== Elvis J. Kurtović & His Meteors were the first to establish a bit of a buzz on the scene. Promoted by Muharem, who in addition to the band's business side also handled many of its creative aspects, EJK&HM; were not only gigging in clubs around Sarajevo but in 1983 also started playing clubs nationwide; in Belgrade (SKC), Zagreb (Kulušić and Lapidarij), Rijeka (Palah), Pula, etc., getting enthusiastic reactions from young club crowds everywhere. Though their sound was hardly original with straight covers of the Rolling Stones, The Who, etc. dominating the repertoire, EJK&HM; live shows were a unique mixture of rock'n'roll with elements of performance art and stand-up comedy, full of youthful exuberance with Elvis J. Kurtović, the band's lyrics writer and mascot, constantly interacting with the crowd between songs. They mostly played student clubs with their promotional activities strictly limited to printed press.Elvis J. Kurtovic @ Damar Muharem would get them publicity by talking up New Primitivism and ensuring journalists from youth-oriented papers—Džuboks and Reporter from Belgrade, ' from Zagreb, and Mladina from Ljubljana—have the 'right angle' for the story while the band members would contribute by providing colourful interviews and quotable sound bytes often delivered in form of a manifesto. In late July 1983, the fledgling band received a huge boost after ', a Yugoslavia-wide high-circulation weekly newsmagazine in the vein of Playboy and Lui, deployed its journalist Goran Gajić to Sarajevo for a story on the unconventional group. Published as a two- page spread headlined \\"Meteorski uspon Elvisa J. Kurtovića\\" (Elvis J. Kurtović's Meteoric Rise) in a magazine that's circulated in 200,000 copies, the story was by far the biggest media exposure the band had gotten up to that point. Building upon talking points already well established and developed by Muharem and Kurtović through the country's youth print media, the Start piece was extremely affirmative and flattering for the EJK&HM; youngsters—proclaiming them to be \\"the next important thing in Yugoslav rock\\". Along with a new batch of the band members' trademark off-the-wall soundbytes sprinkled throughout, the article also re-published—on Muharem's insistence despite Kurtović's apparent opposition—their sarcastic open letter to Goran Bregović that thus got a much bigger audience. Riding the wave of publicity generated by the Start piece, Muharem acted quickly in the fall of 1983 by ambitiously booking Elvis J. Kurtovich & His Meteors for a double bill concert with D' Boys at Sarajevo's Đuro Đaković Hall, an all-seater venue holding almost a thousand people. The show sold out quickly and was a smashing success, a remarkable triumph for a band that at the time hadn't been on television yet and still had no studio recordings. Muharem soon arranged for the band to get some time in Akvarijus studio in Belgrade during December 1983 in order to record material for their debut album whose production was originally supposed to be handled by of Laboratorija Zvuka, but was eventually done by Goran Vejvoda as well as Elvis J. Kurtović and Muharem themselves. Margita Stefanović from Katarina II made a guest appearance on the synthesizer during the album recording sessions as her band was recording its own debut album in the same studio at the same time. EJK&HM; and Muharem soon agreed a record contract with ZKP RTLj and their debut album ' came out in February 1984 right in the middle of the Winter Olympics being held in the city. Figuring that promoting the album during the Olympics would get them extra attention due to all the press and other visitors gathered in the city, EJK&HM; held a press junket that largely turned shambolic as well as a series of club gigs at the popular student club Trasa. They also made one of their first proper TV appearances, lip-synching \\"Baščaršy Hanumen\\" on Hit meseca (Yugoslav counterpart to Top of the Pops) while hamming it up for the cameras. The album release was followed by a promotional club tour of bigger Yugoslav cities, but since the record was selling poorly with less than 15,000 copies sold, the tour ended quickly and the deflated band members returned to Sarajevo. Malkolm Muharem soon quit working with the band. ===1984: Das ist Walter released, Top lista nadrealista expands to television=== A few months later, in April 1984, Zabranjeno Pušenje's debut album Das ist Walter was released by Jugoton in a limited issue of 3,000 copies, clearly indicative of the label's extremely low commercial expectations. Recorded in immensely modest circumstances over an unreasonably long period of seven months due to reasons beyond their control, the album features hyperlocalized punk and garage rock sensibility with songs referencing various Sarajevo-area toponyms and cultural touchstones such as Vratnik, Baščaršija, Bare Cemetery, FK Sarajevo, Hadžići, Bajram, Tržnica (city's main marketplace), Valter brani Sarajevo, Fuada Midžića Street, and an obscure movie theater showing low- budget foreign films. Most of the songs center around individuals from the social fringe such as a Zenica prison-incarcerated hoodlum who knifed a man to death for sexually assaulting his wife, a Hanka-and-Šaban-loving, hippie- bashing, anarchist-graffiti-hating, West-despising local Vratnik heavy exerting his authority over the neighbourhood, a taxi driver who works only at night having recently returned home to Sarajevo following a prison stint in Zenica over an unspecified transgression, eager local community organizer/politician on his way up in the communist nomenklatura, Kreka and Banovići coal miners, etc. Its initial sales were nothing to speak of. Simultaneously with the album release, Top lista nadrealista moved to television as a weekly sketch comedy programme. The shows started airing on 2 June 1984 on TV Sarajevo's channel two as well as on JRT exchange for the rest of the country. Despite being placed in a milieu well removed from their natural setting—their comedy sketches were essentially fillers in-between folk music numbers—the show eventually proved a good vehicle for reaching a wider audience. After the opening few episodes that were largely met with indifference, the show started gaining a bit of an audience outside of its Sarajevo youth core with whom it had immediately struck a chord. This gradually increased viewership of Top lista nadrealista had a positive effect on Das ist Walter sales. Riding the buzz created by the TV show as well as the growing popularity of the \\"Zenica Blues\\" track (cover of Johnny Cash's \\"San Quentin\\"), Karajlić's and Sexon's blend of punk and local storytelling began finding an increasingly receptive audience months after its initial release.Karajlic interview ;Story, 4 November 2008 No one was more surprised at this turn of events than the label itself as it was forced to order multiple new batches of the album copies on records and cassettes. New Primitivism as a term also started catching on as Yugoslav media began using it when referencing the band's style or when talking about the television show. Also, another of the more popular songs on the album, \\"Anarhija All Over Baščaršija\\" (Anarchy All Over Baščaršija), explicitly mentions New Primitives, bringing them up in the context of \\"violent locals from Vratnik who listen to Yugoslav folk music, attack hippies, and are repulsed by the West\\". On 15 September 1984 as Top lista nadrealista television episodes resumed broadcasting following the summer break, the band played Sarajevo's Dom Mladih on a bill that also included Bajaga i Instruktori in front of a raucous crowd of 4,500. The band was officially out of the clubs and now playing larger halls. In October 1984, Zabranjeno Pušenje went to Belgrade for a show at SKC where they were surprised to discover their newfound popularity. In addition to having to add an extra show in the same venue the next day due to popular demand, they also started getting recognized by kids on the street. The two SKC shows launched the band on an extensive and successful Yugoslavia-wide tour; on 4 November 1984 they sold out Hala sportova, a sports arena in Belgrade with 6,000 in attendance. Simultaneously, by November 1984, Karajlić began to get noticed by high-circulation lifestyle magazines in Yugoslavia such as TV novosti and Studio as the connection between his Top lista nadrealista television sketch comedy characters and his colourful rock star stage persona with Zabranjeno Pušenje got clearly established. The band would end up playing over 60 concert dates on that tour. In parallel, the album sales ended up hitting the 100,000 mark while the term New Primitives also became well established in the process. However, the increased profile also meant increased scrutiny as Karajlić and the band were about to find out. ===1984–1985: The 'Marshall' affair...=== At a concert in Rijeka's Dvorana Mladosti before a crowd of some two and a half thousand people on Tuesday, 27 November 1984, the band inadvertently set off a firestorm of controversy. During soundcheck before the show, the band's amplifier went bust to which Karajlić jokingly exclaimed: \\"Crk'o maršal\\" (The \\"Marshall has croaked!\\"), followed by a pause before adding: \\"Mislim na pojačalo\\" (\\"The amplifier, that is\\") (a switcheroo remark about the 1980 death of Marshal Tito), getting a chuckle from a small group of people within the earshot. Liking the reaction he got during soundcheck, the twenty-one-year-old decided to start the actual concert by delivering the same joke as an explanation of why the show is starting late. There were hardly any negative reactions during the concert or immediately after it, and the band continued its tour with a triumphant concert at Dom sportova's Ledena dvorana in Zagreb in front of 12,000 fans on 10 December 1984. Though a few write-ups mentioning Karajlić's marshal quip appeared in neutral tone in Zagreb-based papers leading up to the Dom sportova concert, it would be the op-ed piece by journalist Veljko Vičević in Rijeka- based daily newspaper Novi list that started the avalanche with far-reaching consequences. Headlined \\"Opak dim Zabranjenog pušenja\\" (Zabranjeno Pušenje's Sinister Smoke), Vičević's piece strongly denounces the band for \\"lack of morals\\" and \\"stepping over the line\\", additionally reproaching the group members for past statements such as \\"Tuđe hoćemo/nećemo, svoje nemamo\\".Opak dim Zabranjenog pusenja Vičević's piece cast the first stone that would soon turn into an avalanche of criticism, and eventually end up in a legal process against Karajlić, as well as, by extension, complete public marginalization of the band, new primitives, and Top lista nadrealista. Initially, the Novi list criticism of the band only served to open another front in the ongoing row between two internal factions wrestling for the control of the (SSOH), the provincial branch of the Yugoslav Socialist Youth League (SSOJ), itself the youth wing of the country's one and only political party—Yugoslav Communist League (SKJ). Ever since the death of Vladimir Bakarić a year and a half earlier, the fight for the control of SR Croatia's SKJ branch (SKH) had been on between two factions: the so-called bakarićevci who ostensibly pressed on with the old guard Bakarić policies and the so-called šuvarovci, supposed reformers who gathered around the up-and-coming young thirty-seven-year-old communist Stipe Šuvar. Since the Rijeka concert had been organized by the local pro-Šuvar SSO in Rijeka, the rival pro-Bakarić camp jumped on Karajlić's Marshal quip in order to smear the concert organizers and other pro-Šuvar elements in the organization. The pro-Šuvar faction, which held control of the Croatian SSO's Zagreb-based weekly newspaper Polet, used its pages as a platform for responses and counter-accusations. By extension, Polet vehemently defended Karajlić and Zabranjeno Pušenje. For his part, while generally appreciative of Polet's support, Karajlić would also acknowledge in later interviews that it was no more principled than the attacks from the other side: \\"Neither side gave a damn about me, really, I was just a rhetorical device, a prop used by both sides in their little internal fight\\". Some ten days later, in late December 1984, the news of the Rijeka flap made it back to Sarajevo where more journalists, most notably Pavle Pavlović in the As weekly newspaper, were ready to condemn the band further. In his piece headlined \\"Otrovni dim Zabranjenog pušenja\\" (Zabranjeno Pušenje's Poisonous Smoke), Pavlović labels Karajlić's words \\"an insensitive association and piece of sarcasm that insults right to the heart\\". The columnist then trails off to even take ideological issue with the humorous sound bytes in radio jingles promoting the December 1984 release of the Top lista nadrealista radio material on audio cassette by Diskoton. He continues by predicting that \\"the young band's life span will be little longer than that of a butterfly\\" before adding that \\"sadly even such short time is enough to indoctrinate the impressionable kids with new thoughts, including continuous ridicule of everything that we've created so far as well as banal, low-brow tampering with the basic tenet of the People's Liberation War—Tuđe nećemo, svoje ne damo\\". Pavlović concludes by musing \\"whether the time has come to extinguish Zabranjeno Pušenje's poisonous smoke for good\\". Being published in a high- circulation newspaper, whose average number of copies distributed per issue regularly exceeded 350,000 by late 1984 (and would occasionally even go as high as 420,000), gave the story a huge audience in the city and beyond. In addition to the high-circulation As tabloid, other Sarajevo-based newspapers such as Ven and Oslobođenje quickly joined in the condemnation of the band via strongly worded op-eds of their own. Ironically, weekly tabloid Ven's relatively short broadside against the band headlined \\"Smrdljiv dim Zabranjenog pušenja\\" (Zabranjeno Pušenje's Stinking Smoke) came out in the very next issue after the same newspaper had named Zabranjeno Pušenje the \\"1984 band of the year\\" based on its own poll of Yugoslav pop-rock and folk composers. Only one week after awarding the group, Ven distances itself from Zabranjeno Pušenje by expressing \\"regret we named these young boys the best rock band of 1984\\" and assures the public that \\"had the news of their behaviour been available one week prior, they would have never been included in the poll\\". The unsigned op-ed concludes by telling Ven's readers that \\"these youngsters are using the platform afforded to them to launch puns that cause unequivocal associations of ridicule of the holiest of all Yugoslavs as well as scornful derision of one of the fundamental maxims of our society [Tuđe nećemo, svoje ne damo]\\". The Oslobođenje piece, which reprinted Vičević's Novi list op-ed in full followed by Oslobođenje's own severe criticism of Zabranjeno Pušenje, was especially damning for the band considering the daily newspaper presumed a more serious reputation and tone than As and Ven and as such usually steered clear of pop culture and show business topics. Headlined \\"Opušci novih primitivaca\\" (The New Primitives' Butts), the Oslobođenje editorial by its columnist Ramo Kolar admonishes Karajlić for \\"insulting and smearing the Marshal of Yugoslavia in the ugliest way\\" and wonders \\"which sources (of life) do they [the new primitives] draw their insults and smears of the people they could barely remember (and who are immeasurably better than them ethically and in many other ways) from\\" before concluding: \\"It's one thing to crack locally-flavoured jokes, but it's quite another to spit upon the things that have made this country, which rose from the ashes and blood of its best sons, what it is. That is not something to be, excuse me, fucked around with by the new primitives or anyone else\\". Stung by the Oslobođenje piece, the very next day the members of Zabranjeno Pušenje reacted by issuing a letter to all socio-political organizations within the city of Sarajevo and the Socialist Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, including the print media outlets that had been criticizing the band. Referencing the Oslobođenje write-up, the band members claim it \\"contains grave untruths and unbelievable accusations about our on-stage behaviour based on unverified and false rumours that have been maliciously spread in order to discredit us morally and politically\\". Expressing deep disappointment that as born-and-bred Sarajevans they're experiencing media attacks in their own city, the Zabranjeno Pušenje members also remind the public of their socialist credentials by bringing up their three performances at various Relay of Youth runnings including their live performance before 100,000 youths at the Marx and Engels Square in Belgrade some six months earlier at the Youth Day celebrations. The letter continues by conveying \\"bitterness over the attacks originating from sections of the press in our own city without even seeking our side of the story\\" before making a veiled reference to As journalist Pavle Pavlović by complaining that \\"more credence seems to be given to a malicious manufacturer of false rumours and spitefully presented untruths than to us who were actually there\\". The gist of the letter is their claim that they never insulted the image and legacy of Comrade Tito thus denying media reports claiming otherwise and labeling them \\"monstrous lies\\". However, the letter was generally ignored within Sarajevo and SR Bosnia-Herzegovina as the only press outlets to publish it some twenty days later were Zagreb's Polet and Belgrade's Politika. Since none of the press outlets in Sarajevo and the rest of Bosnia and Herzegovina published their letter, the members decided to go to the institutions of the system directly, arranging two days later to be received by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Communist League Central Committee member and managing to get some assurances from him that the situation would soon settle down. However, quite the opposite began happening as the band's already scheduled concerts started being canceled. The first in what would turn out to be a log series of canceled concerts over the coming months were the two shows scheduled in Split on the 11th and 12 January 1985. In a communist country where \\"verbal offence\\" was criminalized and listed in the criminal code as grounds for legal prosecution, Karajlić, and other band members, were summoned for dozens of police questionings. Communist Yugoslavia had its sacred cows and public criticism or ridicule, either veiled or open, of Tito, the party, or the People's Liberation War was grounds for severe punishment. Karajlić ended up being taken to court with a criminal charge that was eventually reduced to a misdemeanor one in a legal process that stretched on for years. ===...and its consequences=== However, an even bigger problem was that Zabranjeno Pušenje became blacklisted as a result of the Marshal episode. While not banned outright, their songs were taken off radio playlists, their access to television was restricted, and more than 30 of their already booked concerts in early 1985 ended up getting canceled due to pressure from above that manifested itself through sudden introduction of administrative obstacles such as denying permits for the venues on the day of the show and so on. Throughout January 1985, the new primitives experienced multiple bizarre manifestations of this sudden anti-Zabranjeno Pušenje hysteria in Sarajevo. Each January, during winter school break, TV Sarajevo's daytime schedule consisted of various kids' shows reruns, and one such show happened to feature the band's hit song \\"Zenica Blues\\". Not being aware of that, the technician running the control room that day let the show air by mistake. Since Zabranjeno Pušenje were essentially banned from the station, TV Sarajevo executives found it sufficiently necessary to apologize for the oversight later that day in the station's central daily newscast Dnevnik 2 and also to issue temporary suspensions both to the technician as well as to the executive in charge.Glavni tok;RTV Pink, 1990s By association, the hysteria also spread to Top lista nadrealista activities. While promoting their freshly released comedy album (released by Diskoton on audio cassette, containing the best-of compilation of 'Top lista nadrealista' radio segment) in Sarajevo, there was such a stigma attached to the group's activity in the city that not a single journalists was brave enough to show up at the promotional press event at Muzikalije record store in Štrosmajerova Street, fearing that being seen there would be interpreted as a public show of support for beleaguered Karajlić and the rest of his mates.Cenzura na radiju 80-ih, media.ba, 6 December 2012 Due to all the problems and hassle suddenly associated with organizing a Zabranjeno Pušenje gig, local promoters began avoiding the band despite clear demand for their concerts. Finding itself increasingly isolated in addition to seeing its commercial momentum slip away, the band decided to invest all its energy into organizing a single high-profile gig that would hopefully as much as anything serve as a statement of encouragement for all potential promoters not to shy away from the band. Still, despite selling out Hala Pionir in Belgrade on Saturday, 16 February 1985 with more than 7,000 people in attendance, the concert didn't have the desired media effect and the band's downward slide continued with gigs now completely dried up. Facing insurmountable obstacles, the group gave in temporarily, deciding to lay low for some time while some of the members went back to making Top lista nadrealista on Radio Sarajevo. However, in March 1985, the authorities put an end to that too, removing the segment for good from the radio schedule. Just as the career of one New Primitivism band, Zabranjeno Pušenje, was suddenly spiraling downhill, another band from the same milieu, Plavi Orkestar, was getting big. Other bands that at one time or another identified with New Primitives include: Bombaj Štampa, Plavi Orkestar, Dinar and Crvena Jabuka, although they quickly moved on to more commercial and communicative forms of expression. ===1984–1985: Muharem takes over Plavi Orkestar, Soldatski bal hits it big=== Though the torch of New Primitivism had primarily been carried by Elvis J. Kurtovich & His Meteors and Zabranjeno Pušenje, other bands were also associated with the movement. After splitting with Elvis J. Kurtovich & His Meteors following the lackluster reception of their debut album, crafty manager Malkolm Muharem switched over to another local Sarajevo outfit—Plavi Orkestar—a band that had also been gigging on the city's student club scene for some time already and was now looking to take the next step by recording and releasing a studio album. Though also starting out as a garage/punk rock group that often crossed paths with Pušenje and EJK (Orkestar's bassist Ćera I even played on Pušenje's demo recordings before joining Orkestar while the bands also often held club gigs together), over time, especially after achieving stable lineup of Loša, Pava, Ćera I, and Ćera II in early summer 1983, Plavi Orkestar moved to more conventional forms of expression within Yugoslav general cultural context. In practice, that meant essentially abandoning punk in favour of pop and openly flirting with Yugoslav commercial folk in their sound. Though opening doors for them commercially, this practice somewhat placed them on the fringes of New Primitivism. Compared to the two main new primitive outfits, their stage appearance was far more orderly and their lyrics were less cerebral. Nevertheless, Muharem saw a new opportunity with the four fresh-faced lads each of whom just turned 20 having recently returned to the city from their respective year-long mandatory army services. In addition to crossing paths with them at various gigs over the preceding few years while he managed Elvis J. Kurtovich & His Meteors, Muharem had already shared a few instances of brief business collaboration with the Plavi Orkestar guys such as helping them in September 1983 arrange demo recording sessions at Enco Lesić's Druga Maca studio in Belgrade right before they went away to serve their respective mandatory army stints. In fall 1984 when Muharem took the youngsters under his wing, the band barely existed with its main creative duo—frontman Saša Lošić and guitarist —not on speaking terms and Pava not participating in any band-related activities. Not deterred, Muharem, took their 1983 demos over to Jugoton's chief executive , pitching him another new primitive band by presenting Plavi Orkestar's sound and image as camp. By his own admission, Muharem also used the tremendous success of Zabrenjeno Pušenje's Das ist Walter album as his main selling point with Škarica who reportedly needed further convincing as he made the band record more demos. Through personal connections like Prljavo Kazalište's , Muharem got Parni Valjak's to agree to record a few more demos with the Plavi Orkestar youngsters, which brought Pavičić back into the fold and by January 1985 all four were off to Zagreb to record in SIM studio. Subsequently, these new demos also managed to secure a pre-contract with Jugoton. The album named Soldatski bal came out in February 1985 and instantly created a sensation all over Yugoslavia, placing the young band among the most successful Yugoslav rock acts like Bijelo Dugme and Riblja Čorba. Muharem essentially stayed true to the promotional techniques he previously implemented with Elvis J. Kurtovich & His Meteors—print media and soundbites—though the sarcastic bravado of EJK&HM; was now replaced with Plavi Orkestar's dreamy boyish charm. However, this time it had a tremendous commercial effect as the band embarked on a Yugoslavia- wide tour in late summer 1985 with scenes of thousands of screaming and fainting teenage girls repeated in town after town. Named 'Bolje biti pijan nego star' (Better Drunk than Old) after the band's hit track, the tour included 140 concerts in sports arenas and other large venues throughout the country. Muharem additionally hired journalist-turned-filmmaker Goran Gajić to shoot a tour documentary thus reuniting with him two years after Gajić wrote a glowing summer 1983 piece on Elvis J. Kurtović in Start. Furthermore, Gajić directed a video for Plavi Orkestar's hit track \\"Kad mi kažeš, paša\\" featuring actresses Tanja Bošković, Sonja Savić, journalist , and TV personality Suzana Mančić. The album ended up selling 550,000 copies. Though with unexpected and sudden success the band's sensibility quickly transformed even more into folkish pop as they almost morphed into a sugary boy band, many media outlets still presented them as a new primitive group, giving the movement unprecedented promotion in Yugoslavia during the first half of 1985. ===1985–1986: Ričl leaves Elvis J. Kurtović & His Meteors to form Crvena Jabuka, gets big immediately=== After parting ways with their manager Malkolm Muharem in mid-1984 following the disappointing commercial performance of their debut album Mitovi i legende o Kralju Elvisu, Elvis J. Kurtovich & His Meteors kept soldiering on with the same lineup, releasing another record—1985's Da Bog da crk'o rok'n'rol—that similarly failed to connect with the general audience. Their June 1985 appearance at YU Rock Misija at the Marakana stadium in Belgrade effectively turned out to be the band's swan song. Guitarist Dražen Ričl—who had since May 1985 already been musically reconnecting with Zlaja Arslanagić, his old Ozbiljno Pitanje bandmate and Top lista nadrealista co-protagonist—officially left Elvis J. Kurtović & His Meteors after the YU Rock Misija performance. The rest of the members—vocalist Rizo Petranović, drummer Radomir \\"Hare\\" Gavrilović, bassist Nermin \\"Fićo\\" Dedić, and keyboardist Zoran \\"Poka\\" Degan—also followed suit as the band essentially ceased to exist. Though Ričl and Arslanagić had been in touch throughout the years since their 1982 Ozbiljno Pitanje split, the two reconvened in summer 1985 to form a new band they would eventually name Crvena Jabuka. Since both the twenty-three-year-old Ričl and twenty-four-year-old Arslanagić had already achieved a measure of prominence via Top lista nadrealista, their summer 1985 gathering for a musical project generated press even before the new band released any songs. Press comparisons and parallels to Plavi Orkestar, another Sarajevo band whose young members came up through New Primitivism before moving on to a more commercial sound and blowing up on the Yugoslav music scene, were especially frequent. The press narrative of Crvena Jabuka following in the footsteps of Plavi Orkestar's creative and business model especially intensified when the new band signed with Jugoton towards the end of 1985. The album recording sessions in SIM studio in Zagreb were also closely followed by the Yugoslav music press including even television coverage.Crvena Jabuka recording sessions In late March 1986, Crvena Jabuka's eponymous debut album got released and immediately went on to great commercial success. Though employing some of the localized aesthetics of New Primitivism, the album is a broad Yugoslav commercial record designed to reach as many youths as possible with a sound ranging between melodic power pop and pop rock. Still, many critics and observers kept connecting Crvena Jabuka with New Primitivism despite even Ričl and Arslanagić distancing their new band from the movement while doing promotional press for the album. ===1987: Official demise=== New Primitivism got disbanded in 1987 in a mock ceremony attended by most of its founders and prominent figures. Shot at Sarajevo's Academy of Performing Arts (ASU) in form of a television comedy sketch for TV Sarajevo, The Official New Primitivism Disbandment was framed as a Yugoslav Communist League (SKJ) congress with delegates taking turns to speak at the podium. Named the 7th Extraordinary New Primitivism Congress, it concluded that the movement is to be disbanded immediately by its members with the mantra \\"better us [to do it] than somebody else\\". ==Reaction and reception== ===1983=== The initial wider Yugoslav media reaction to the movement wasn't positive. During New Primitivism's nascent stage, following a summer 1983 double-bill concert by Elvis J. Kurtovich & His Meteors and Plavi Orkestar at Belgrade's SKC, a blurb appeared in the high-circulation Politika daily reviewing the show, but also discussing the movement in general. In his negative review, rock critic Ljuba Trifunović places New Primitivsm in the same context with commercial folk singer Lepa Brena's then-current flirtation with rock sound (which he pejoratively termed \\"naïve rock\\"), expressing disappointment that \\"both appeared precisely when we began to think Yugoslav rock finally became immune to such diseases due to new wave effectively washing away the so-called 'shepherd rock' and all of its derivatives\\". Seeing New Primitivsm in continuity with several past offerings from the Sarajevo musical scene such as composer Nikola Borota Radovan's opus, Jutro, early Bijelo Dugme, and Milić Vukašinović's collaboration with Hanka Paldum, Trifunović feels the adjective \\"new\\" to be entirely superfluous in the movement's name: \\"Elvis J. Kurtovich & His Meteors and Plavi Orkestar are representatives of this renewed and stripped-down primitivsm, and even if some inconsequential differences do exist when comparing the two bands' interpretative dilettantism (with EJK&HM; coming out on top), what's really depressing is their absolute creative pathos embodied in the creed 'let's be ourselves' – primitive Balkanoids\\".In the Name of Love;Politika, summer 1983 Though initially mostly negatively reviewed by the Yugoslav rock critics, the movement did receive an unexpected compliment from Yugoslavia's most successful and famous rock musician Goran Bregović, himself often mercilessly lampooned by the new primitives. During fall 1983, while a guest on TV Sarajevo's rock music show Rock oko, he referred to New Primitivism as \\"the only authentic Yugoslav answer to punk\\". ===1984=== As the movement got more profiled in late 1983 and especially throughout 1984 with the emergence of Zabranjeno Pušenje's debut album and the start of Top lista nadrealista on television, it began getting better media notices in Yugoslav media. In July 1984, rock critic Darko Glavan wrote a detailed opinion piece on New Primitivism in general as well as EJK&HM; and Zabranjeno Pušenje specifically. Expressing mild approval, he outlines his personal acceptance of the movement: \\"If someone likes them, I'm not going to dissuade them, however, if someone doesn't like them, I'm not going to attempt convincing them otherwise\\". Furthermore, while noting new primitives are deserving of the media attention they had been receiving, he wonders whether the amount of publicity has become excessive because \\"they are terrific as an added flavourful spice to a developed and varied rock scene, but can hardly function as the dominant trend\\". Focusing on EJK&HM;, he labels them \\"Bosnia's answer to Sha Na Na\\", before proclaiming them an acceptable form of entertainment for the general masses and a welcome break from incoherent art rock pretentiousness. Though further expressing skepticism whether this is still enough for a conventional rock career, citing EJK&HM;'s unwillingness to freshen up their repetitive jokes and yucks as a concern for their long term career prospects. Glavan is more upbeat about Pušenje, finding them to be \\"more musical, more talented, and in the context of an LP, simply stronger than EJK&HM;\\". Comparing Pušenje to The Clash in addition to extolling their artistic ambition that \\"saves them from becoming one-dimensional caricatures and additionally invokes locally flavoured stylized neorealism of Emir Kusturica's Sjećaš li se Doli Bel?\\", Glavan feels that, despite occasionally failing to properly articulate their inventiveness, the band has a fresh voice and a couple of great tracks off their debut album. ===1985=== New Primitivism received a lot more press attention throughout early 1985 as the so-called \\"Marshal affair\\" raged in the country's media following Zabranjeno Pušenje frontman Nele Karajlić's supposed insulting pun about the death of Marshal Tito at the band's late November 1984 concert in Rijeka. As part of his January 1985 article on the various aspects of Zabranjeno Pušenje's \\"Marshal affair\\" while the scandal was still unfolding and its outcome was very much in flux, rock critic Zlatko Gall included his observations about the band specifically and New Primitivism in general. Writing through the lens of the ongoing political scandal being litigated in the Yugoslav media and the court of public opinion, he summarizes the philosophy of New Primitivism's public activity as \\"possessing clear anti- intellectual traits that include the glorification of the streetwise local noble savage via humour that plays to the cheap seats and as such straddles the thin line between allusion on one side and vulgarity and repugnance on the other\\". Gall continues by opining that Zabranjeno Pušenje's debut album Das ist Walter \\"mostly lands on the right side of that line despite the band's crudeness and various deficiencies that they managed to turn into an advantage\\" before lauding it further, just like Glavan did six months earlier, for \\"successfully evoking and re-creating the atmosphere of Kusturica's Sjećaš li se Doli Bel?\\", which Gall sees as a \\"film that in addition to stirring up nostalgia also awakened the consciousness of young Sarajevans about their own (new primitive) identity\\". The journalist concludes that Zabranjeno Pušenje thus set the stage for a career such as Buldožer's, but that its enormous success \\"facilitated by the euphoria around the new primitive Top lista nadrealista\\" over the past year \\"often pushed the band to the wrong side of the vulgarity line during their live shows at which point it's only a small step to the distasteful remark and the unsuccessful joke about an American amplifier\\". Against the backdrop of the \\"Marshall affair\\" shifting into a higher gear that saw Zabranjeno Pušenje and New Primitivism essentially proscribed from public activity in various parts of Yugoslavia—with a plethora of canceled Zabranjeno Pušenje gigs, radio playlist bans for their songs, removal of Top lista nadrealista from the Sarajevo radio and television, a legal case being opened against Karajlić, etc.—film critic and columnist Bogdan Tirnanić wrote a long-form piece in March 1985 criticizing Yugoslavia's top-down cultural policies using the phenomenon of New Primitivism as an example. Observing the movement being snuffed out on political grounds and removed from sight immediately after it had been afforded enormous media attention, Tirnanić offers personal support to the beleaguered new primitives by stating he \\"believes young Karajlić's version of events that what they actually meant was really just the damn amplifier\\". The writer then posits that \\"even though it will at some future point in time be completely irrelevant whether these kids had blurted out what's being ascribed to them, none of it affects the essence of the matter because even if this public investigation centered around what Karajlić meant by his Rijeka on-stage quip hadn't been launched the way it had been, as a third-hand one-guy-told-me-so account, the whole new primitive thing was always going to be bitterly dealt with in one way or another\\". Before expounding on this claim, Tirnanić steps back to offer his views on the creative merits of New Primitivism, proclaiming it \\"without a doubt one of the biggest media and cultural attractions of 1984 that appeared as a local subcultural philosophy in reaction to the early 1980s Belgrade, Zagreb, and Ljubljana respective rock'n'roll milieus once those cities' punk and new wave scenes began to diminish\\" and summing it up as a \\"unique and simple program that outright eliminates the danger of ever becoming, even unconsciously or by chance, an epigone of a global trend due to affirming the distinctive cultural content originating from an authentic natural resource—homo balcanicus—with its wide range of socio-folkloric characteristics: from pulling a čakija to optional personal hygiene\\". Tirnanić continues by remarking that \\"it's not always easy to tell whether dr. Nele Karajlić and Elvis J. Kurtović are skewering the characters they narrate about, lampooning them with an ironic campy distance or they genuinely hoist them up to be admired as unique individuals thoroughly cleansed of any traces of civilization outside of the Balkan experience\\". The writer feels that \\"which of the two attitudes the new primitive performers end up taking towards their characters seems to vary from situation to situation while they're probably wishing they could have it both ways at the same time\\" though adding that \\"they generally do play it with ironic distance more often than straight, but mostly out of necessity in order to make their fairly thin material, in terms of duration and quantity, last a little longer\\". Tirnanić then turns his attention specifically to the movement's most popular offerings: Top lists nadrealista and Zabranjeno Pušenje's Das ist Walter. When it comes to Top lists nadrealista's 1984 series, though considering it a \\"welcome breath of fresh air on stale Yugoslav television\\", the writer also feels that \\"its socialist-camp style is some twenty years too late after 's early 1960s plays in and Komarac cabaret\\". ==Legacy== New Primitivism as a sub-cultural movement retained prominence well after its official 1987 demise. Sarajevo- born-and-raised novelist Miljenko Jergović referenced New Primitivism on many occasions in his literary output as a newspaper columnist, bringing it up fondly and in a positive light. His praise for the movement's protagonists covers a wide range: from applauding their contributions to Sarajevan civic pride to admiring the storytelling techniques and use of language in their songs and comedy sketches. In the early 1990s, he summarized New Primitivism as \\"a general cultural emancipatory movement that was supposed to rid the Bosnians of their eternal inferiority complex towards Zagreb and Belgrade\\".In the Name of Love; Ogledalo, early 1990s In a 2014 column, he explained it as \\"a gesture of self-irony, which served as a way for the city of Sarajevo to get out of its cultural cocoon and, for a short time at least, become the cultural capital of Yugoslavia\\" before adding that it also brought \\"a mockery of the regime and a complete carnivalization of everyday life while threading a fantastic ability to tell a 'small story' as well as provide tribute and homage through storytelling\\". Writing in 2017 about the language, style, and metaphorical associations used by the new primitives, Jergović saw all of it as \\"part of an artificial Sarajevan čaršija code these guys invented for the purpose of telling their stories and writing their songs, the same code that would eventually find its way to the city's streets and even into its intellectual salons—bullshit chambers of the new Sarajevan cultural and literary elite\\". Jergović furthermore exclaimed in the same piece that \\"the language in the early Top lista nadrealista and initial Zabranjeno Pušenje's and EJK&HM;'s albums had no bearing in reality as no one in the city of Sarajevo actually spoke that way\\", explaining it all as \\"a persiflage of sorts, a knowing self-mockery that assumed all kinds of embellishment\\". He concluded by saying that \\"what began as a persiflage soon ended up as a widely-accepted standard [in Yugoslavia] so much so that because of these few uniquely talented and humourous individuals, the gift of humour became a collective one in the sense that if the stereotype that Gypsies are good at singing and playing instruments is true, and if all Black people know how to dance and hold rhythm then everyone in Bosnia must be able to tell a joke and entertain a crowd\\". In his scathing 1993 rebuke of the movement, Muhidin Džanko, a professor at the University of Sarajevo's Faculty of Philosophy, labeled New Primitivism an \\"exceptionally anti-Islamic movement\\" that \\"thanks to the charisma of its protagonists, managed to directly obstruct and even eliminate the national feelings of the Bosnian Muslim youth, majority of whom are proud members of the 'new primitive nation'\\". He furthermore saw the poetics of New Primitivism to be rooted in its specific language containing \\"supposed speech patterns and parlance of the Sarajevo čaršija and mahalas\\", before rejecting it as a \\"cheap trick meant to lampoon the traditional verbal expression of Sarajevo Muslims and degrade their Oriental lexicology\\". Zoran \\"Cane\\" Kostić, the Partibrejkers frontman, wasn't a fan of New Primitivism; he mentioned it in passing during a 1997 interview while looking back on his band's early years and specifically recalling Plavi Orkestar's and Crvena Jabuka's mid-1980s Yugoslavia-wide commercial success that had its springboard in Belgrade: \\"During the mid-1980s, the music scene in the city started popping again a bit and new bands began taking off. But, it was a bad trip. Bosnians (Plavi Orkestar and Crvena Jabuka) entered Belgrade sometime around 1986 right after these raucous new primitive guys set the stage for them. They were their Trojan Horses. I never got into that new primitive thing precisely because I saw something else in it. I mean, in the end, their dumb schtick made it possible for a band like to conquer Belgrade\\". To many, New Primitivism gained added relevance in the context of the breakup of Yugoslavia. Books like 2013's Shake, Rattle and Roll: Yugoslav Rock Music and the Poetics of Social Critique written by Dalibor Mišina, assistant professor of sociology at Lakehead University, devote a significant portion to the study of New Primitivism's overall significance in the last decade of SFR Yugoslavia's existence, arguing that the country could've survived had it adopted values propagated by New Primitivism and similar genres as its new cultural model.Shake, Rattle and Roll: Yugoslav Rock Music and the Poetics of Social Critique While mentioning New Primitivism in passing in a 2018 column about the folk rock band Nervozni Poštar, novelist Muharem Bazdulj likened the movement to a \\"mischievous kid who loves to test the patience of his parents, his teachers, and his school principal, but is not quite willing to go as far as doing something that would actually risk getting expelled from the school\\" before concluding that \\"just like the Baroque ended up in Rococo so did New Primitivism end up in Nervozni Poštar\\" because \\"Nervozni Poštar appeared at a time when the esthetic of New Primitivism practically became the ruling one in the Yugoslav public sphere and when fear of the cultural elite's disapproval was no longer present even in that form where it turns you on that the cultural elite finds you abhorrent\\". ==See also== *Zabranjeno Pušenje *Top lista nadrealista *SFR Yugoslav pop and rock scene *Punk rock in Yugoslavia *New wave music in Yugoslavia ==References== Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina culture Category:Yugoslav music Category:Culture in Sarajevo Category:Art movements Category:Rock music ","title":"New Primitivism"},{"id":"2562768","text":"SCDF may refer to: *Singapore Civil Defence Force *Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, a Congregation of the Roman Curia ","title":"SCDF"},{"id":"2562769","text":"Master of Kung Fu was a comic book title published by Marvel Comics from 1974 to 1983. ==Publication history== The character Shang-Chi first appeared in Special Marvel Edition #15 (December 1973) by Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin. Shang-Chi appeared again in issue #16, and with issue #17 (April 1974) the title was changed to The Hands of Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu. Amidst the martial arts craze in the United States in the 1970s, the book became very popular, surviving until issue #125 (June 1983), a run including four Giant- Size issues and one Annual. The series began by introducing Shang-Chi as a man raised by his father Dr. Fu Manchu to be the ultimate assassin for the would- be world conqueror. In Shang-Chi's first mission, he kills one of his father's old enemies, Dr. Petrie, and learns of Fu Manchu's true, evil nature. Disillusioned, Shang-Chi swears eternal opposition to his father's ambitions and fights him as an agent of British intelligence, under the orders of Sir Denis Nayland Smith. The series was an instant sales success. However, Englehart and Starlin would depart the series after their third issue, Master of Kung Fu # 17; Englehart over editorial disputes with then-Marvel editor Roy Thomas while Starlin, who was unfamiliar with Fu Manchu up until working on the second issue of the series, left out of embarrassment over the racist nature of the Rohmer novels. Despite the title's co-creators' early departure, its success grew once writer Doug Moench and artist Paul Gulacy, began collaborating in issue #22. Comics historian Les Daniels observed that \\"Ingenious writing by Doug Moench and energetic art by Paul Gulacy brought Master of Kung Fu new life.\\" Their critically acclaimed run continued, with short gaps, until #51 when Gulacy was replaced by artist Jim Craig. Craig was later succeeded by Mike Zeck who became the regular penciller in issue #64 (1978). Gulacy was a film buff, and modeled many characters after film stars: Shang-Chi on Bruce Lee, Juliette on Marlene Dietrich, James Larner on Marlon Brando, Clive Reston (often broadly hinted at as being the son of James Bond as well as the grand-nephew of Sherlock Holmes) occasionally looking like a combination of Basil Rathbone and Sean Connery, and a minor character Ward Sarsfield (after Arthur Henry Sarsfield Ward, the real-life name of Fu Manchu's creator Sax Rohmer) resembling David Niven. Moench introduced other film-based characters, including ones modeled after Groucho Marx (Rufus T. Hackstabber) and W. C. Fields (Quigley J. Warmflash). Moench continued for a long tenure, and the title started to become a fan favorite once again when Mike Zeck (on pencils) and Gene Day (on inks) began their long run on the book. Master of Kung Fu started receiving Gulacy-level acclaim when Gene Day took over penciling in issue #100 (1981). Despite critical success, sales lagged. Day died of a heart attack after finishing issue #120, and Moench left the book after #122. The character's long-running battle with his father ended with #118 and with the main storyline resolved, the book was canceled with issue #125, as Shang-Chi retired to a passive life as a fisherman in a Chinese village. In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked Moench's work on Master of Kung-Fu with artists Gulacy, Mike Zeck, and Day sixth on its list of the \\"Top 10 1970s Marvels\\". In 1988, Marvel published a new Master of Kung Fu story in Marvel Comics Presents #1-8. It reunited Shang-Chi with most of the original supporting cast and featured Moench again writing, with Tom Grindberg penciling. Since its cancellation, the Master of Kung Fu title would be briefly revived on a couple of occasions as the Master of Kung Fu: Bleeding Black one-shot issue (1990), and the MAX miniseries Master of Kung Fu: Hellfire Apocalypse (2002), with artist Paul Gulacy on art again. In 2015, the Master of Kung Fu title was revived as part of the Secret Wars storyline. Written by Haden Blackman and illustrated by Dalibor Taljic, the four-issue series is a wuxia-inspired story that takes place in the Battleworld domain of K'un-Lun and centers around Shang-Chi in his fight to overthrow his despotic father, Emperor Zheng Zu. In 2017, after a 34-year gap, Master of Kung Fu released its 126th issue as part of the Marvel Legacy relaunch. The one-shot issue was written by mixed martial artist CM Punk and illustrated once again by Talajic.https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/exclusive-meet-the-creative-team- behind-the-new-master-of-kung-fu-marvel-legacy-title ==The Hands of Shang-Chi, Master of Kung Fu== ===Supporting characters=== The series, especially as written by Doug Moench was notable for its strong supporting characters. As they evolved, these characters became nearly as integral to the series as Shang-Chi himself: * Dr. Fu Manchu is portrayed in a manner mostly consistent with the Sax Rohmer novels. He is a brilliant and calculating master villain who aspires to rule the world. He is the leader of the Si-Fan, which he later incorporates into the Order of the Golden Dawn, a single organization made up of secret societies and cults from around the world. As the series progresses the character deteriorates, gradually losing his nobler qualities. By the end of the series he is a pathetic figure, reduced to stealing his children's blood to preserve his immortality and greedily lapping up the blood of his son's clone out of desperation. His true identity is later revealed to be Zheng Zu, an ancient Chinese sorcerer. Other notable aliases include: Mr. Han, the Father, the Devil Doctor, Chang Hu and Wang Yu-Seng. * Sir Denis Nayland Smith is Fu Manchu's nemesis from the novels. In the comics he retains this role, his obsession with the villain often bringing out the dark side of his own character. In his better moments, he becomes a sort of surrogate father to Shang-Chi. Ultimately, he is too caught up in what Shang-Chi calls 'games of deceit and death' and fails in this role. The relationship the two finally form is that of two flawed characters who feel strong friendship in spite of their deep differences. * Fah Lo Suee is the daughter of Fu Manchu and is the final character from the novels to appear in the comic book. She is a villainess in her own right, though she is not interested in the misguided idealism of Fu Manchu. She is a pragmatist, seeking the best way to power and as such, shifts alliances often. Usually she is an enemy of Shang-Chi and his friends, but sometimes she is an ally. She initially leads her own faction of the Si-Fan against her father, and later becomes leader of Oriental Expeditors and the Golden Daggers. When last seen, she had become a highly ranked official in MI-6. She later resumes her criminal activities, working under the alias the Cursed Lotus. She is currently known as Zheng Bao Yu. * Black Jack Tarr is Smith's aide-de-camp and a powerful giant of a man with a gruff manner. Though he is initially an enemy of Shang-Chi, the two become close friends over time. He exhibits the most bigoted traits of any character and invariably addresses Shang-Chi as \\"Chinaman\\", rather than using his name. It is one of the successes of the series that readers are drawn to feel for Tarr while the writing never turns a blind eye to his politically incorrect attitudes. Over time, Tarr drops his bigoted attitude and his relationship with Shang-Chi evolves into genuine friendship. By the time of The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu (vol. 2), Tarr has become the new director of MI-6. * Clive Reston is a British spy who resembles a younger and more vulnerable version of James Bond. Where Bond is a successful womanizer and seems unaffected by heavy drinking, Reston struggles with alcoholism and a romantic rivalry with Shang- Chi. The resemblance to Bond is intentional. Reston's dialogue makes it clear that he is both Bond's son and the grand-nephew of Sherlock Holmes. By the time of Wisdom, he is the director of MI6 and has been knighted; he believes MI-13 to be a doomed organisation and that MI6 should handle the \\"weird happenings\\", to the extent of keeping things from the rival agency. After this attitude helped lead to a Martian invasion, he has become more cooperative, and worked with MI-13 and MI5 against Dracula. * Leiko Wu is introduced as a femme fatale like those in the Bond films. She is a beautiful Chinese-British woman who is torn between her history with Reston and her growing attraction to Shang-Chi. Though initially sarcastic and self-possessed to the point of arrogance (Leiko is actually a Japanese name meaning \\"arrogant\\"), her relationship with her new lover causes her to become more contemplative. * M'Nai / Midnight is an African agent of Fu Manchu and an elite assassin of the Si-Fan. As a child, M'Nai's village was destroyed by British forces due to it being one of Fu Manchu's many headquarters. Fu Manchu, impressed with the orphaned child's stoic nature, adopted and raised him alongside his son Shang- Chi. Due to his badly disfigured face, he always wore a mask. Fu Manchu sent him to kill Shang-Chi after his son turned his back on him, even though Shang- Chi and M'Nai considered themselves brothers. Midnight died as a result of their second battle, but was later resurrected as Midnight Sun by the alien Kree in a cloned body and gifted with cosmic powers strong enough to challenge the Silver Surfer. After a couple of battles with the Surfer, he settled down to a peaceful life in the Blue Area of the Moon, where he was accepted by the Inhumans. This would not last long, as M'Nai would later resume his criminal activities to carry out his father's legacy and fulfill his thirst for vengeance against his former brother.The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu (vol. 2) #3 * Rufus T. Hackstabber is a memorable character who appeared only twice in the series; he keeps referring to Shang-Chi as \\"Chang-Shee\\". The character strongly resembles Groucho Marx and his fast-paced nonsensical patter plays well off Shang-Chi's laconic seriousness. Hackstabber's name is a play on Rufus T. Firefly, Groucho's character in Duck Soup. * Shen Kuei / the Cat is a master thief whose skill in martial arts equals Shang-Chi's. The meaning of the character's name is both similar and opposite to Shang-Chi's name. He is a sort of mirror image, a 'good bad guy' in opposition to Shang-Chi's 'bad good guy'. While they share mutual respect, the two always find themselves in opposition. He has recently appeared in Cable & Deadpool working as a mercenary for Cable. He has also defeated Deadpool, who looks at him as a Rock God among mercenaries and has also referred to him as \\"the Keith Moon of the spy trade\\" and \\"the Justin Timberlake of the Cherry Pop Club\\". * Rufus \\"Super Midnight\\" Carter is an African-American kickboxing champion and antiques dealer who secretly works for the CIA. He is a light-hearted character who helps to draw out Shang-Chi's sense of whimsy in his several appearances. Carter's unusual nickname is accounted for by his origin. A colleague challenged Doug Moench to write a story using \\"Carter's Super Midnight\\" (the name of a brand of carbon paper) as a title. * Xi-Shan Hao / Shadow Slasher is a Hong Kong assassin and enemy of Shang-Chi that first appeared in Master of Kung Fu #98 (1981), and was created by Doug Moench, Mike Zeck, and Gene Day. * Li-Peng Kai / Kogar is a Hong Kong smuggler, gang leader, and enemy of Shang- Chi that first appeared in Master of Kung Fu #63 (1978), and was created by Doug Moench and Jim Craig. ==Master of Kung Fu: Battleworld== This series, written by Haden Blackman and illustrated by Dalibor Taljic, was part of the Secret Wars series which takes place in the Battleworld domain of K'un-Lun. Based on the mystical city of the same name from Earth-15513, it is a wuxia- inspired domain in which its inhabitants are martial artists with mystical abilities and techniques. Aside from Shang-Chi, the series includes reimaginings of characters from the original Master of Kung Fu series, as well as others from other Marvel comics. === Characters=== * Shang-Chi: The \\"Rising Spirit\\", he is the son of Emperor Zheng Zu and hailed as one of the greatest martial artists of the kingdom. Wanted for the murder of his father's rival, Lord Tuan, the previous master of the Iron Fist. Much like his mainstream counterpart, he is raised by his villainous father to become his personal weapon, but renounces his father after murdering an innocent old man. However, while Shang-Chi from the original stories is portrayed as reserved and introspective, this Shang-Chi starts out as a bitter and cynical drunkard, albeit noble and compassionate; over time, he regains his resolve and fighting spirit. He is also accompanied by his pet dog, whom his father wanted to drown for being the runt of its litter. Although born to one of his many forgotten concubines, Zheng Zu presents a romanticized and fictional version of Shang- Chi's conception: he was created with a heart forged from the steel of the Ebon Blade melted in the Eternal Flame, the Infinity Gems for eyes and the Cosmic Cube for his mind, baptized in the River Styx and brought to life by the ashes of a phoenix. Aside from mastering nine of the 10 techniques of the Ten Rings, Shang-Chi later learns and masters his student Kitten's technique of intangibility (thus becoming his namesake, a \\"Rising Spirit\\") and develops a new technique called the Gorgon's Eye that turns his opponents into stone. After defeating Zu in the Thirteen Chambers, Shang-Chi becomes the new emperor of K'un-Lun. * Zheng Zu: An amalgam of Zheng Zu and the Mandarin from the mainstream continuity, he is the master of the Ten Rings and the Emperor of K'un-Lun, a position he has held for nearly 100 years. A cruel and ruthless despot, Zheng Zu rules the kingdom with an iron fist, even going as far as killing his own students for their failures. To maintain his rule, he exiled his son to cover up his involvement in his rival Lord Tuan's murder and planned to have all the remaining masters killed. Despite his nefarious schemes, Zheng Zu is also a proud and honorable warrior, as he abides by the rules of the Thirteen Chambers when Shang-Chi enters the tournament. After Shang-Chi defeats him with the Gorgon's Eye, his reign is finally brought to an end. * Rand-K'ai: Based on Danny Rand, he is the sheriff of K'un-Lun and current master of the Iron Fist. Hunts after Shang-Chi for the murder of his beloved master, Lord Tuan, although he suspects the Emperor, whom he is forced to serve, to be involved. Despite his animosity towards Shang-Chi, he is shown to be just and honorable. Initially entering the Thirteen Chambers to usurp Zheng Zu, he later sets his sights on Shang-Chi to bring him to justice. After hearing the truth from Red Sai about his mentor's death, Rand-K'ai cures Shang-Chi of the poison in his body and lets him fight his father in the Thirteenth Chamber. * Red Sai: Based on Elektra, she is the sai-wielding master of the Red Hand and the former lover of Shang-Chi. Due to the sacrifice made by the first master of the Red Hand, Red Sai is forced to serve as Emperor Zu's personal assassin. It is revealed that Zu had sent to her to assassinate Lord Tuan but she ultimately failed; to spare Red Sai and her students from the Emperor's wrath, Shang-Chi killed Tuan. * Kitten: Based on Kitty Pryde, she is an outcast who was expelled from her school for failing to master an advanced technique, which left her permanently intangible. She later becomes a member of Shang-Chi's Lowest Caste school. She accompanies Shang-Chi in all of his fights in the Thirteen Chambers, due to her condition preventing her from interfering. Shang-Chi reveals that he was able to master the technique Kitten failed to do, which plays a vital role in his fight against Zheng Zu. * Tuan: Based on the character of the same name, Lord Tuan was the previous master of the Iron Fist and Zheng Zu's hated rival. Due to his kind heart, Tuan opposed Zu for his cruelty towards K'un-Lun's magical races and even his own students, and fought him repeatedly in the Thirteen Chambers. Although unsuccessful, he humiliated the Emperor by making bleed in their last fight, leading a vengeful Zu to orchestrate his murder. Red Sai was initially sent to assassinate him but failed, Shang-Chi killed Tuan while he was meditating in order to protect her from his father. Tuan's murder leads his student Rand-K'ai to avenge his death. * Lock: Based on Lockheed, he is a small, fire-breathing Chinese dragon and a member of Kitten's band of outcasts. He later joins Shang-Chi's Lowest Caste school. * Callisto: Based on the character of the same name, she is the original leader of the band of outcasts that approaches Shang-Chi for training. When they request for him to teach them the Ten Ring techniques, Shang-Chi refuses and mocks Callisto for her missing eye. An enraged Callisto betrays the group and gives up Shang- Chi's whereabouts to the Emperor in exchange for membership in the Ten Rings; this ultimately leads to her former friend's Cy's death at the hands of Laughing Skull and Shang-Chi and the others escape capture. When Shang-Chi emerges victorious from the Thirteen Chambers, a remorseful Callisto is seen with the remaining Ten Rings members, who pledge their loyalty to the new Emperor. * Sarah: Based on Marrow, she is a young outcast with bones protruding over her body due to her failure in mastering the Marrow technique. She later becomes a member of Shang-Chi's Lowest Caste school. * Caliban: Based on the character of the same name, he is a member of Callisto's band of outcasts. Despite being rejected from many masters due to his simple- mindedness, he possesses a keen photographic memory. He later becomes a member of Shang-Chi's Lowest Caste school. * Rahne: Based on Wolfsbane, she is a member of Callisto's band of outcasts who was expelled from the Wolf Clan for falling in love with Cy, a member from a rival school. Due to her training being incomplete, she is permanently stuck in her wolf-human hybrid form. She later becomes a member of Shang-Chi's Lowest Caste school. * Cy: Based on Cypher, he is a member of Callisto's band of outcasts who lost his right arm when protecting his lover Rahne from her former master, due to them being from rival schools. After Callisto betrays the group to the Emperor, their hideout is raided by Rand-K'ai, Red Sai and Laughing Skull, who capture the outcasts to draw Shang-Chi out of hiding. When Cy attempts to save Rahne from Rand-K'ai, Laughing Skull kills him, devastating Rahne and the others. Although Shang-Chi helps the remaining members escape, he is guilt-ridden for not preventing Cy's death and agrees to make the outcasts his students and end his father's rule to protect them. * Razor Fist: Based on the character of the same name, he is a student of the Ten Rings and is proficient in the Mortal Blade technique. When he, Typhus and Nightwind are clearing a park of vagrants, they encounter Shang-Chi, who they mistake for a drunken bum. After finding out his true identity, Razor Fist and the others attempt to collect the bounty on his head, only to be easily bested by the Master of Kung Fu and the outcasts. As punishment for his failure to capture his son, Zheng Zu cuts off Razor Fist's hands with his own version of the Mortal Blade technique. He later replaces his severed hands with blades, now resembling his mainstream counterpart. * Typhus: Based on Typhoid Mary, she is a student of the Ten Rings and is proficient in the Flame Fist technique. When she, Razor Fist and Nightwind attempt to collect the bounty on Shang-Chi's head, they are easily defeated by the Master of Kung Fu and the outcasts. * Nightwind: Based on the character of the same name, she is a student of the Ten Rings and is proficient in the Nightbringer technique. When she, Razor Fist and Typhus attempt to collect the bounty on Shang-Chi's head, they are easily defeated by the Master of Kung Fu and the outcasts. * Laughing Skull: Based on the Taskmaster, he is a sadistic member of the Ten Rings, whose face is hidden by his namesake mask. Laughing Skull is shown to be proficient in the Zero Touch and Flame Fist techniques, as well as swordsmanship. He, Rand-K'ai and Red Sai are sent by the Emperor to hunt down Shang-Chi. After Callisto gives up Shang- Chi's whereabouts, the three raid the outcasts' hideout and capture them to draw Shang-Chi out of hiding. Despite Rand-K'ai's orders to spare the prisoners, Laughing Skull unhesitatingly kills Cy when he attempts to rescue his lover Rahne, much to Rand-K'ai's anger. Shang-Chi subsequently attacks Laughing Skull and uses the Nightbringer technique to help the others escape. * Norrin: Based on Norrin Radd, he is the personal herald of Emperor Zu. It is unknown if Norrin is a student of the Ten Rings or simply just a servant to the throne. * Shiro: Implied to be based on Sunfire due to his name and association with fire. Razor Fist is sent by Zheng Zu to have his stumps cauterized by Shiro after Razor Fist's arms are cut off by the Emperor. It is unknown if Shiro is a student of the Ten Rings or simply a servant to the throne. * Lester: Based on Bullseye, he is a retired assassin who now works as a farmer. After falling out of favor with the Emperor, Lester attempted to hunt down Shang-Chi to retain his good standing, but gave up after failing to track him. Lester is brutally interrogated by Red Sai, Laughing Skull and Rand-K'ai for Shang-Chi's whereabouts, but they ultimately come up empty- handed due to the former assassin's failure. * T'Challa: Based on the character of the same name, he is the master of the Panther Clan and has a passion for science and art. He is defeated by Shang-Chi in the Thirteen Chambers. * Ava: Based on the character of the same name, she is the master of the House of the Jade Tiger.

He is defeated by Shang-Chi in the Thirteen Chambers. * Drew: Based on Jessica Drew, she is the four-armed master and weaver of the Spider Cult, which she claims is a religion. She is defeated by Shang-Chi in the Thirteen Chambers. * Karnak: Based on the character of the same name, he is the master of the House of Terrigen Mists. Much like his mainstream counterpart, Karnak is a highly skilled martial artist and can detect his opponents' weaknesses, although it is unknown if these abilities are taught by the Terrigen Mists or simply exclusive to him. He is defeated by Shang-Chi in the Thirteen Chambers. * Creed: A female version of Sabretooth, she is the master of the Tooth and Claw school. Creed appears to have a grudge against Rand-K'ai, a nod to the mainstream Sabretooth's debut in the comics as an antagonist to Iron Fist. She is defeated by Shang-Chi in the Thirteen Chambers. * Spector: A female version of the Moon Knight, she is the master of the Faces of the Moon school. Spector is accompanied by an unseen entity, heavily implied to be Khonshu. She is defeated by Shang-Chi in the Thirteen Chambers. * Lady Mandarin: Based on Psylocke, she is the master of the School of Spirit Blades. She is defeated by Shang-Chi in the Thirteen Chambers. === Setting === Centuries before the start of the series, the great masters of every martial arts school warred with each other until the masters from the Ten Rings and the Iron Fist decided to end the bloodshed by hosting a tournament every 13 years in the Thirteen Chambers to decide who the next Emperor of K'un-Lun would be, with the losing masters swearing fealty to the victor. The each of these schools and their abilities are modeled off a Marvel comics character from the mainstream continuity: * The Ten Rings: a martial arts school that has the highest authority in K'un- Lun due to its master, Emperor Zheng Zu, winning the previous Thirteen Chambers for almost 100 years. Its students include Razor Fist, Typhus, Nightwind, Laughing Skull, and later Callisto. Shang-Chi was a student before swearing off his loyalty after his exile. Each of the 10 techniques used by the school's members are based on the abilities of the Mandarin's ten rings: **Mortal Blade: Makes the user's arms razor sharp. For Razor Fist, his arms simply glow red, but for Shang-Chi and Zheng Zu, their arms transform into literal blades. This is the only technique not based on any of the Mandarin's rings; instead it is an homage to the bladed limbs of Razor Fist, a longtime foe of Shang-Chi from the mainstream continuity. **Nightbringer: Lets the user summon and control darkness. Based on the Nightbringer ring. **Zero Touch: Lets the user emit waves of cold and ice. Based on the Zero ring. **Flame Fist: Lets the user generate and control heat and fire. Based on the Incandescence ring. **Shocking Palm: Lets the user send bursts of lightning onto an opponent. Based on the Lightning ring. **Long Breath: Lets the user summon vortexes of wind. Based on the Spin ring. **Daemon's Eye: Lets the user emit powerful bright lights that can blind others. Based on the Daimonic ring. **Lost Hope: a telepathic ability that forces the user's psionic energy onto others. Based on the Liar ring. **Remaker: Turns the user's flesh as hard as diamond. Based on the Remaker ring. **Spectral Touch: A lethal technique that can kill anyone the user touches. Based on the Spectral ring. It is the only technique Shang-Chi was not taught by Zheng Zu, who is shown to be its only practitioner. * The Iron Fist: the first martial arts school of K'un-Lun. Founded by a farmer named Quan Yaozu (named after the character of the same name, who was also the first Iron Fist of the mainstream continuity), the Iron Fist is dedicated to protecting the weak and are the main rivals of the Ten Rings school. They were the first school to win the Thirteen Chambers when a previous great master became the first Emperor of K'un-Lun, until he was usurped by another master. Much like the mainstream comics, students of the Iron Fist can channel their chi into their hands and feet, encasing them in a supernatural glow that allows them to strike targets with superhuman hardness and impact while protecting them from pain and injury; the Iron Fist can also be used to dispel darkness and heal injuries and poison. Lord Tuan was the previous master of the Iron Fist until he was succeeded by his student Rand-K'ai following his death. * The Lowest Caste: a group of outcasts shunned and rejected by the martial arts schools and K'un-Lun society that take in Shang-Chi during his exile. They are loosely based on the Morlocks and the New Mutants. To qualify for the Thirteen Chambers, Shang-Chi represents the group as its great master, also giving them their school name as well. After Shang- Chi's victory, the Lowest Caste are spared from execution and are accepted by K'un-Lun's citizens. Its members include Kitten, Lock, Sarah, Caliban, Rahne and formerly Callisto and Cy. * The Red Hand: based on the Hand, it is a martial arts school made up of ninjas skilled in many mystical abilities, including assassination, stealth and acrobatics. Due to its first master sacrificing her life to protect her lover, Quan Yaozu, master of the Iron Fist and first Emperor of K'un-Lun, the Red Hand devotes itself to the throne, regardless of whoever sits on it, and refuses to participate in the Thirteen Chambers. The school is led by Red Sai, whose master is based on the Kingpin. A character resembling Nightcrawler is shown as a member as well. * The Panther Clan: A martial arts school whose members are inspired by and have similar superhuman abilities to the Black Panther. They are led by T'Challa, whose master is based on T'Chaka. * The House of the Jade Tiger: A martial arts school whose members are inspired by and have similar superhuman abilities to the White Tiger. They are led by Ava, who succeeded her brother Hector as its master. * The Halls of Atlantis: A martial arts school inspired by the Atlanteans from the mainstream continuity whose members can breathe and become stronger underwater. They are led by Lord Namor and include Namorita as a member. * The Spider Cult: A martial arts school inspired by characters associated with Spider-Man whose members, \\"Weavers\\", can use spider-like abilities, including growing extra limbs. They are led by Drew. * The House of Terrigen Mists: A martial arts school inspired by the Inhumans, hidden in the wilds of ancient K'un-Lun. While never explained what the school teaches, its master, Karnak, is shown with the ability to sense an opponent's weak points, which he carries from the mainstream continuity. A character resembling Crystal is shown to be a member as well. * The Tooth and Claw: A martial arts school inspired by the Lupines whose members can grow fangs and claws. They are led by Creed. * The Faces of the Moon: A martial arts school whose members are inspired by and have similar supernatural abilities to Khonshu. They are led by Spector. * The School of Spirit Blades: A martial arts school inspired by Psylocke, whose members can manifest \\"spirit blades\\" made up of psychic energy. They are led by Lady Mandarin. * The Wolf Clan: A martial arts school whose members can shapeshift into wolf-like forms. Rahne was a former member of this school until she was cast out for falling in love with Cy, a member of a rival school. * Several other unnamed schools exist in K'un-Lun as well, including the ones Kitten and Cy were expelled from, and a school whose members are based on the Punisher. == Collected editions == * Master of Kung Fu: Battleworld (collects Master of Kung Fu (vol. 2) #1-4 and Ronin #2), 112 pages, January 2016, * Shang-Chi: Master of Kung-Fu Omnibus ** Vol. 1 collects Special Marvel Edition #15-16, Master of Kung Fu #17-37, Giant-Size Master of Kung Fu #1-4, Giant-Size Spider-Man #2 and material from Iron Man Annual #4, 696 pages, June 2016, ** Vol. 2 collects Master of Kung Fu #38-70 and Master of Kung Fu Annual #1, 664 pages, September 2016, ** Vol. 3 collects Master of Kung Fu #71-101 and What If? #16, 696 pages, March 2017, ** Vol. 4 collects Master of Kung Fu #102-125, Marvel Comics Presents #1-8 and Master of Kung Fu: Bleeding Black #1, 748 pages, October 2017, ==References== Category:Comics by Doug Moench Category:Comics by Steve Englehart Category:Marvel Comics titles Category:Shang-Chi titles ","title":"Master of Kung Fu (comics)"},{"id":"2562774","text":"Ar begs (in Russian chronicles \\"Арские князья\\") was a formation of Noqrat Tatars' nobility, served to Muscovy in 16th–17th century.

Over its long history it has been alternately a meadow, park, pleasure garden, military parade ground, revolutionary pantheon and public meeting place. The space now covered by the Field of Mars was initially an open area of swampy land between the developments around the Admiralty, and the imperial residence in the Summer Garden. It was drained by the digging of canals in the first half of the eighteenth century, and initially served as parkland, hosting a tavern, post office and the royal menagerie. Popular with the nobility, several leading figures of Petrine society established their town houses around the space in the mid eighteenth century. Under Peter the Great it was laid out with paths for walking and riding, and hosted military parades and festivals. During this period, and under Peter's successors it was called the \\"Empty Meadow\\" and the \\"Great Meadow\\". Empresses Anna and Elizabeth built their Summer Palaces here, and it was redeveloped into a pleasure park with pavilions and walkways for promenading. Theatres were built on the land during this period, and with the imperial patronage, the square became the \\"Tsaritsyn Meadow\\". New townhouses and palaces developed along the square's boundaries and across its frontage onto the Neva. During the reigns of Emperor Paul I and his son Alexander I, the square took on more of a martial purpose, with the construction of military monuments in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In acknowledgement of this, and its role in hosting military reviews and parades, it was renamed the \\"Field of Mars\\" in 1805. The square was part of the further development of the area by architect Carlo Rossi in the late 1810s, involving new buildings around the perimeter, and the extension of streets and frontages. During the nineteenth century the Field of Mars alternately hosted large military reviews, and public festivals. Sports and other leisure activities took place into the early twentieth century. After February 1917 the square became the ceremonial burial place of a number of those killed during the February Revolution. Construction of a memorial, the Monument to the Fighters of the Revolution, took place between 1917 and 1919 at the centre of the Field of Mars. The monument became the centre of an early pantheon of those who died in the service of the nascent Soviet state, and burials of some of the dead of the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War, as well as prominent figures in the government, took place between 1917 and 1933. Between 1918 and 1944 the Field of Mars was renamed the \\"Victims of the Revolution Square\\". The square was laid out with vegetable gardens to help feed the city during the siege of Leningrad, and also hosted an artillery battery. Restorations took place after the war, including the installation of the first eternal flame in Russia. In the post-Soviet period the Field of Mars has become a popular location for demonstrations and protests. ==Location== View across the Field of Mars, looking north. In the foreground is the course of the Moyka River, with the Neva in the distance The square covers an area of nearly . Bordering the Field of Mars to the north are the Marble Palace, Suvorov Square, the and the Saltykov Mansions, separated from the square by Millionnaya Street. To the west are the of the Pavlovsky Regiment. The Moyka River forms the boundary to the south, across from which is the Mikhailovsky Palace and Garden. The east side is bounded by the Swan Canal, which separates the Field of Mars from the Summer Garden. ==Imperial period== ===Petrine park=== In the early 18th century the land which eventually became the Field of Mars was a marshy area with trees and shrubs, lying between the Neva to the north, and the Mya (now the Moyka) and Krivusha (now the Griboyedov Canal) rivers to the south. With the establishment of the imperial residence in the Summer Garden in 1704, the area became a buffer zone separating the royal property from the rest of the city. Between 1711 and 1721 two canals, the Swan, and the Red, were dug to the east and west respectively with the purpose of draining the land. This created a roughly rectangular parcel of land, initially called simply Pustoi (), meaning \\"Empty\\" - after the trees that grew here were felled, and from the 1720s, the \\"Great Meadow\\" (). The site of the future Field of Mars, shown on an 1737 map of the city A tavern was built in the northwestern part of the land in 1712, being rebuilt in 1714 as a post office. Between 1713 and 1717 the area hosted the royal menagerie, containing various birds and animals, including an elephant. With the construction of the Red Canal, the menagerie was transferred to Hamovaya Street (now Mokhovaya Street). With the completion of the Red Canal in 1721, the western edge of the Big Meadow became a popular site for the nobility to construct large townhouses. Those that settled in the area included Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, Alexander Rumyantsev, Adam Veyde, and Pavel Yaguzhinsky, and Peter the Great's daughter, Elizabeth Petrovna. With the canals dug to carry away water, the land was soon drained, and on the orders of Peter the Great, it was levelled, cleared and sown with grass, with alleys laid out for walking and riding. The Great Meadow became a location for military parades and festivals. Celebrations of the 1721 Treaty of Nystad were held here, with a triumphal arch built to commemorate the treaty. The area became known as \\"Amusement Field\\" (). The Gottorp Globe was initially installed on the field shortly after its arrival in Saint Petersburg, housed in the former elephant quarters. A special building was constructed for it, and opened to the public for a time, before the globe was moved to the Kunstkamera on Vasilyevsky Island in summer 1726. ===Imperial meadow=== During the reign of Empress Catherine I, the field was termed the \\"Meadow in front of the Summer Palace\\" (), and during the reigns of her successors Empress Anna and Empress Elizabeth, it became the site of their Summer Palaces, designed by Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli. Under Empress Anna, the land was used to host military exercises and parades for two weeks every autumn. After these parades the officers dined in the Summer Palace, while the soldiers ate on the meadow. In February 1740 Empress Anna ordered repairs and improvements to the square, including the planting of trees and the removal of some buildings. Architect Mikhail Zemtsov designed 24 garden pavilions, and oversaw the laying out of new paths and tree planting carried out by Harmen van Bol'es and his apprentice Ilya Surmin. A fountain decorated with dragons, dolphins, and mascarons by Konrad Osner was placed in the centre of the square. Further work took place in the early reign of Empress Elizabeth, with new walkways and tree planting. The square became known as the \\"Promenade\\" (), and it continued to house attractions and kiosks on public holidays. It was still a popular location for the houses of the rich and powerful, with the former residence of the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp presented by Empress Elizabeth to her favourite, Alexei Razumovsky. Also with their houses here at this period were the court physician Jean Armand de Lestocq and the military commander Stepan Fyodorovich Apraksin. Ice slides and other attractions on the field in the 1820s In 1750 a theatre, designed by Rastrelli, was built on the square, replacing an earlier one that had stood on the corner of the Catherine Canal and Nevsky Prospect but had burnt down in 1749. The new theatre was of wooden construction on a stone foundation, and had three tiers of boxes. It was built by 353 soldiers of the garrison regiments, and was completed on 25 April. It hosted its first performance, a comedic opera, on 3 May, becoming the first opera house in Russia. It eventually fell into disrepair and was demolished towards the end of the eighteenth century. From 1751 the area in front of the Summer Palace became known as the \\"Tsaritsyn Meadow\\". It also hosted the Maly Theatre on the banks of the Moyka, and was the venue of a German troupe led by Karl Knipper, which performed with the pupils of the city's Foundling Home. It was rebuilt in October 1781 by order of Catherine the Great, and continued to host performances. Ivan Dmitrevsky, an actor in the troupe, and later its director, arranged for it to present the first productions of comedic works by Denis Fonvizin, including The Brigadier and The Minor. The theatre also hosted performances of Catherine's own plays, and the first performance of Pierre Beaumarchais's The Barber of Seville in Russia. The Maly Theatre was eventually demolished in 1797 on the orders of the new emperor Paul I. The Theatrical Bridge, part of the Tripartite Bridge, is a reminder of the theatre's existence. The city continued to expand during the second half of the eighteenth century and large townhouses and palaces were built along the northern boundary of the meadow, along the Neva embankment. The Marble Palace was the first, built between 1765 and 1785. Yury Felten designed the three- storey Lombard building to replace the Razumovsky residence on the west side of the meadow, at the junction with the prestigious Millionnaya Street. A severe flood in 1777 damaged or destroyed many of the features of the Promenade, after which military parades began to be held once more. This largely completed the destruction of the lawns and vegetation. The Red Canal was filled in in 1780, becoming a roadway, which was given the name Tsaritsynskaya Street in 1798. Expansion across the meadow's Neva frontage continued in the 1780s with the construction of the service wing of the Marble Palace, and the and the Saltykov Mansions. ===Military parade ground=== In 1799 an obelisk designed by Vincenzo Brenna was installed in the centre of the field in honour of Pyotr Rumyantsev, and in 1801 Mikhail Kozlovsky's Suvorov Monument was unveiled on the south side of the field. During the brief reign of Paul I, the Tsaritsyn Meadow was used mainly for military parades and drill, with his son, Alexander I transferring the land from the city authorities to the military. On 16 May 1803 carousels, booths and other amusement pavilions were erected on the land as part of the celebrations of the centenary of the founding of Saint Petersburg. The martial nature of the area was reinforced with the renaming of the Tsaritsyn Meadow as the \\"Field of Mars\\" in 1805, commemorating Mars, the God of war in Roman mythology, whom Kozlovsky had depicted Alexander Suvorov as on his monument. The new name also referenced the Campus Martius in Rome and the Champ de Mars in Paris, drawing parallels and asserting that Saint Petersburg was also to be considered as a great European capital. The name \\"Tsaritsyn Meadow\\" however continued to appear on some maps up until 1917. Pushkin acknowledged the military connection in his 1833 poem The Bronze Horseman; The Field of Mars in the early 19th century, by Benjamin Patersen. > I love the military vigour > Paraded on the Field of Mars: > Stout-hearted foot troops and hussars > In orderly and pleasing figure; > Torn battle colours held on high; > Smart ranks in measured rhythm swaying; > Glint of brass helmets, all displaying > Proud bullet scars from wars gone by. Military use trampled the remaining grassy surface to dust, which when raised by the soldiers' boots, blew across the city, often settling in the trees of the nearby Summer Garden, and earning the Field of Mars its nickname of the \\"Saint Petersburg Sahara\\". The next major redevelopment of the area was in 1818, with architect Carlo Rossi including it in the development of his architectural ensemble to the south, centred around the Mikhailovsky Palace estate. The Rumyantsev Obelisk was removed to Vasilyevsky Island while the monument to Suvorov was relocated to a new square, later named Suvorov Square, north of the Field of Mars on the Neva embankment, and between the Marble Palace and the Saltykov Mansion. Between 1817 and 1821 a large building alongside the west of the square was built to the design of Vasily Stasov to house the , with the western ensemble completed with houses between the Moyka and the south of the Pavlovsky Regiment building. In 1823, as part of the redevelopment of the land around the Field of Mars and the Mikhailovsky Palace, Sadovaya Street was extended up to the eastern edge of the Field of Mars, joining the pathway running parallel to the Swan Canal, and connecting with Millionaya Street which crossed the northern boundary. , by Grigory Chernetsov From the 1820s the Field of Mars became the main site for military parades in Saint Petersburg. Reviews of the Guard Corps were held every May, prior to the Imperial family's departure for its summer residences, along with parades to mark important events. On 23 September 1829 a prayer service was held after the Russo-Turkish War, and a parade in 1831 celebrated the end of hostilities with Poland following the November Uprising. This parade was depicted in a painting by Grigory Chernetsov, now held in the collections of the Russian Museum. Another review was held on the field on 21 April 1856, marking the ceremonial disbanding of regiments of the national militia that had been raised for service in the Crimean War. Georgiana Bloomfield, wife of the British ambassador John Bloomfield, described the May 1846 review on the field: > I saw a wonderful sight: Emperor Nicholas displayed 40 thousand troops on > the Field of Mars. The day was beautiful and clear, and I had a great place > by the window in the palace of the Prince of Oldenburg. At one o'clock all > the troops lined up and the emperor with his retinue, which included all the > military diplomatic corps, including my husband, rode up to the ranks, the > troops shouted \\"Hurray!\\" and the sound of such a multitude of voices shook > the air. The Sovereign then approached the Summer Garden and all the troops > defiled before him: first the light artillery, then the infantry, behind > them cavalry, accompanied by heavy artillery ... The May military parades ceased during the reign of Alexander III but resumed under his son Nicholas II. ===Festival grounds=== Theatres, attractions and stands on the Field of Mars in the 1890s From 1869 folk festivals once more began to be held on the Field of Mars, marking such events as Maslenitsa, Easter, the Emperor's name day, the coronations of new emperors, and on 30 August, the feast day of the city's patron saint, Alexander Nevsky. Booths, carousels and other entertainments were erected on the field. The newspaper Vsemirnaya Illyustratsiya described the 1869 fair: > People's holidays, as they are now arranged on the Tsaritsa Meadow, have > recently been instituted here. The chief of police, adjutant general F. F. > Trepov, is responsible for this noble business. Tents, carousels, swings are > built, poles are erected, a folk theatre, or rather a stage for it, is set > up. The spectators are placed standing in the open air. Barrels are sent > from breweries. A German sausage maker stands nearby and offers hot sausages > at bargain prices. Theatre lovers are crowded in front of the stage for a > long time and await the performance of \\"Filatka and Miroshka\\". The farce is > played briskly... The artist Mstislav Dobuzhinsky recalled visiting a fair on the field when a child: > Approaching the Field of Mars, where the booths stood, already from the > Chain Bridge and even earlier, from Panteleimonovskaya, I heard the shaking > of the human rumble and a whole sea of sounds - horns, and the squeak of > whistles, and the mournful sound of the street-organ, the accordion, and the > banging of tambourines, and individual cries — all this drew me on, and with > all my strength I hurried my nanny to get there as quickly as possible. The > booths could already be seen behind the bare trees of the Summer Garden - > these tall yellow plank stands stretched in two rows along the entire Field > of Mars, and on all of them tricolour flags flew, and behind the booths > there were spinning swings and ice mountains, also with flags at the top. Sports and exercises taking place on the Field of Mars in the pre- revolutionary period Prior to 1872 Admiralteyskaya Square had also been used as a venue for festivals, but the laying out of the Alexander Garden meant that there was no space for the booths, and the Field of Mars became the sole venue in the city. As well as entertainments, sports competitions were also held, with activities such as climbing a greasy pole, and walking on a spinning log. In 1867, concerned about the high levels of drunkenness in the city, authorities placed restrictions on the sale of alcohol during public holidays. In August 1867 some 100,000 people gathered on the Field of Mars, without a single arrest for drunkness. In 1892 a 12-year-old received a set of china for winning the spinning log competition. Festivals were held on the occasions of the parades of the Preobrazhensky and Semyonovsky Regiments from 1897, until 1907 when festivals on the Field of Mars were banned. It was around this time that a tower was built on the field to house a telescope. A proposal was made to construct a bicycle track on the Field of Mars, but it ultimately failed to gain sufficient funding. Sporting events continued to be held on the field during the early twentieth century. It hosted the world championship in speed skating in winter 1903, and in 1913 the first inter-city hockey match was held here. The Saint Petersburg team \\"Sport\\" were beaten 2:6 by an English club. A reinforced concrete skating rink was built that year to a design by Yevgeny-Karl Schröter, though the entrance fee was comparatively expensive at 55 kopecks in the afternoon, 1 ruble 10 kopecks in the evening. The building was considered to detract from the existing architectural ensemble, and was dismantled shortly afterwards. Skating on the Field of Mars in 1914 Another attraction appeared in the winter of 1910-1911 with reindeer brought onto the field and offered to citizens for riding. Vyacheslav Popov, a wealthy Komi, had lost most of his herd to disease. He brought the remaining animals to Saint Petersburg, quartering them on the Field of Mars, and offering them for public rides for five kopecks per lap. As a result, he made some money, and was also granted an audience with Nicholas II. Various proposals were made to develop the Field of Mars during the early twentieth century. One proposal in 1906 was for the creation of a building, designed by architect Marian Lalewicz, to house the State Duma. Another was for an opera house using designs by Victor Schröter, and a 1909 project suggested the creation of a park or garden with a monument to Emperor Alexander II designed by I. S. Kitner. Other failed proposals included that in 1913 to return the Rumyantsev Obelisk to the Field of Mars, and the creation of a shopping centre with a hotel, a restaurant and a post office. Despite these rejections, several projects did come to fruition. In 1909, Franz Roubaud's panoramic painting \\"The Defence of Sevastopol\\" was displayed on the Field of Mars in a special pavilion designed by Vasily Shene. A telescope was installed on the field to allow citizens to observe the solar eclipse on 17 April 1912. Also prior to the outbreak of the First World War the Urania Observatory and a summer cinema, named \\"American Mountains\\", were located on the field. During the war the field was used to store stacks of firewood. ==Revolutionary and Soviet period== ===Revolutionary burials=== The funerals of those killed during the February Revolution on , After the February Revolution, the Petrograd Soviet decided to create an honorary communal burial ground for those who had been killed in the unrest, and the Field of Mars was selected. An important consideration was the plan to site the putative Constituent Assembly on the Field of Mars, which would then overlook a monument to those who had died in the revolution. Four large graves were dug in the centre of the Field of Mars. Coffins in the communal grave The burials were scheduled to take place on , but prior to this news circulated that there would not be any funeral rites. Relatives of the dead hurried to claim and bury them in other cemeteries with the traditional rites. Ultimately only 184 victims were buried on the Field of Mars, comprising 86 soldiers, 9 sailors, 2 officers, 32 workers, 6 women, 23 people for whom social status could not be determined, and 26 unknown dead. The city soviet declared 5 April a day off work, and many citizens turned out to accompany the funeral processions, which carried the dead from the hospitals and chapels across the city. The graves had been prepared by blasting trenches in the frozen ground, with the lowering of each coffin marked by a cannon shot from the Peter and Paul Fortress. By one estimate some 800,000 people attended the funerals. A competition for the design of the memorial was won by Lev Rudnev and the Monument to the Fighters of the Revolution was opened on 7 November 1919. Epitaphs by Anatoly Lunacharsky, People's Commissar of Education, were inscribed around the memorial. ===Soviet pantheon === The burials of the dead of the February Revolution started a trend for the Field of Mars to become a pantheon of those who died in the service of the revolution and the achievement of Soviet power. The first individual burial, that of V. Volodarsky, took place on 23 June 1918. Volodarsky, a member of the Presidium of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, had been assassinated three days earlier. Further burials took place later that year, when a number of the dead of the October Revolution were interred. Other interments over the following years included Moisei Uritsky, chairman of the Petrograd Cheka who was assassinated in August 1918; Semyon Nakhimson, who was killed in the Yaroslavl Uprising in July 1918; Civil War commander A. S. Rakov in 1919 and All-Russian Central Executive Committee member in 1920. The Field of Mars continued to be used as a military parade and training ground during this period, hosting a review of the first \\"red officers\\" on 18 September 1918. On the first anniversary of the October Revolution the Field of Mars was renamed the \\"Victims of the Revolution Square\\", and was sometimes called \\"The Square of the Graves of the Victims of the Revolution.\\" A monument to Soviet sacrifices, the Field of Mars between the wars The layout of the square was further developed following the installation of the monument, with gardens and pathways to the design of Ivan Fomin. The first Subbotnik, a Saturday devoted to volunteer work, was held on 1 May 1920, with 16,000 city inhabitants working to plant more than 60,000 bushes and trees on the square, laying paths and alleys, and removing waste. On 19 July 1920 the Field of Mars was visited by delegates of the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern, led by Vladimir Lenin. The redesign was completed in 1921, and on 25 October the square was transferred to the city's Garden and Park Administration. In 1922 the Comintern and the All-Russian Central Executive Committee proposed creating a monument to the October Revolution, but the project was never carried out. The last burial on the square, that of the secretary of the Leningrad city committee of the CPSU , took place on 8 October 1933. ===Wartime use and postwar memorial=== Anti-aircraft guns on the Field of Mars in March 1942 The square was laid out with vegetable gardens during summer 1942 to help feed the city during the siege of Leningrad. There were also six anti-aircraft batteries located on the field, as well as trenches to provide shelter from bombardments. The square's former name, the Field of Mars, was restored on 13 January 1944. It underwent further reconstruction between 1947 and 1955, with an eternal flame lit in the centre of the square on 6 November 1957, in memory of the victims of various wars and revolutions. The flame, lit from the open-hearth furnace of the Kirov Factory, was the first eternal flame in Russia. The flame from the Field of Mars was also used to light the eternal flame at the Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery on 9 May 1960, and at other memorials in Saint Petersburg. The flame was delivered to Moscow in 1967 and on 8 May lit the eternal flame on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier near the Kremlin Wall. ==Post-Soviet period== The square was once more reconstructed between 1998 and 2001. Over 3,800 new bushes and trees were planted, and the paths and lawns were repaired. The Monument to the Fighters of the Revolution was also restored, being relit on 14 November 2003 with a flame once again taken from the Kirov Factory's furnace. By the early 2000s, with parking and transport around the city becoming problematic, proposals have occasionally been made to build a car park under the Field of Mars. The presence of graves has led residents to oppose these plans. In 2014 the memorial was restored by experts from the . ===Public meeting place=== An anti-corruption demonstration on the Field of Mars on 26 March 2017 By the mid-2000s, the Field of Mars had become a popular location for demonstrations and protests on issues such as political prisoners, fair elections, anti- corruption measures, etc. This status was acknowledged in December 2012 when the square was designated a \\"Hyde Park\\" by the Governor of Saint Petersburg Georgy Poltavchenko, making it a \\"specially designated place in the city for the collective discussion of socially significant issues and the expression of citizens' public sentiments.\\" A particularly large rally was held on 12 June 2017, attended by over ten thousand people. Police detained 658 people, including , a deputy of the Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg, and several journalists. In August 2017 Poltavchenko revoked the \\"Hyde Park\\" status of the Field of Mars, citing the nature of the burials and memorial made it an inappropriate location for rallies. ==See also== * List of squares in Saint Petersburg ==References== Category:Military monuments and memorials Category:Parks and open spaces in Saint Petersburg Category:Tourist attractions in Saint Petersburg Category:Squares in Saint Petersburg ","title":"Field of Mars (Saint Petersburg)"},{"id":"2562778","text":"A Prefect's Uncle is an early novel by author P. G. Wodehouse, one of his school stories for children. It was first published on 11 September 1903 by A & C Black. An American edition was issued by Macmillan from imported sheets in October 1903. The action of the novel takes place at the fictional public school Beckford College, a boarding school for boys. The title alludes to the arrival at the school of a mischievous young boy called Reginald Farnie, who turns out to be the uncle of the older \\"Bishop\\" Gethryn, a prefect, cricketer and popular figure in the school. His arrival, along with that of another youngster, Wilson, who becomes a personal servant to Gethryn's friend Marriott, leads to much excitement and scandal in the school, and the disruption of some important cricket matches. ==Plot== Gethryn is the Head- prefect of Leicester's House in Beckford and is friends with Marriott, another prefect. Marriott's aunt has asked him to look after the son of a friend, though the new boy, Wilson, proves to be capable of defending himself. Wilson becomes Marriott's fag (a junior student who performs errands for a senior student). Gethryn's aunt asked him to meet his uncle at the train station. Gethryn is surprised that his uncle, Farnie, is four years younger than him. Farnie is entering the school, having transferred between several schools, in each case because he was expelled or his father was dissatisfied with the school. The students in the Upper Fifth form are required to enter a poetry contest, and this year, the subject is the death of Dido. Lorimer, who is in the Upper Fifth, cannot write poetry, so his friend Pringle offers to write the poem for him. Against school rules, Farnie goes to a village to play billiards, and loses money. He borrows two pounds from Monk, a notorious troublemaker, who tells Farnie to pay him back four pounds later. Monk is disappointed when Farnie does not become one of his cronies, and demands his loan get repaid or he will reveal that Farnie broke bounds to play billiards. While Gethryn is playing for Beckford against the Marylebone Cricket Club, Farnie takes four pounds out of Gethryn's charity collection box and leaves the money in Monk's study. Since Wilson sees Farnie in Gethryn's study and will probably realize later who took the money, Farnie decides to run away. He leaves a note for Gethryn and thinks he might as well take the other six pounds in the box too. The match against the M.C.C. starts well for Beckford, who bat first. During the lunch break, Gethryn sees Farnie's note. Gethryn believes he can catch up to Farnie on his bicycle and bring him back before the next innings. However, the match takes a bad turn for Beckford and the first innings soon ends. Since Gethryn cannot be found, Lorimer is brought in as a substitute fielder, but is not allowed to bowl. The team loses without Gethryn. Gethryn meanwhile encounters obstacles but finally brings back Farnie, who can only return six pounds. To protect his uncle, Gethryn refuses to explain why he left. Norris, the cricket captain, bars Gethryn from playing for the school team. Pringle visits Colonel Ashby, a family friend. The Colonel shows him a book of poems containing a poem about the death of Dido. Pringle copies the poem and gives it to Lorimer, pretending he wrote it. Monk and his mob dislike Gethryn because Gethryn stopped them from bullying Wilson. Eight of them are in the cricket team for Leicester's and they refuse to play in the inter-house cricket cup unless Gethryn resigns his captaincy of the house team, but Marriott and Reece advise Gethryn to get junior House members to play instead, including Wilson. Marriott suggests Gethryn focusing on improving their fielding, since Gethryn, Reece and Marriott can handle the batting and bowling. On the day Jephson's plays against Leicester's, Norris, who is in Jephson's, underestimates Leicester's and misses the match. After Leicester's wins, Norris realizes he acted much like Gethryn did with the M.C.C. match. He reinstates Gethryn in the school team, but is still unhappy that Gethryn will not explain his actions. Mr Wells, a friend of the Headmaster, selects Lorimer's poem as the prize winner. Mr Lawrie, the master of the Sixth, recognizes the poem as his own. The Headmaster questions Lorimer about this, and Lorimer then talks to Pringle, who reveals he copied the poem. They confess to the Headmaster. The Headmaster gives them a light punishment of two extra lessons, though this prevents them from playing in the cup for the School House. Leicester's defeats the School House and wins the cup. The winter term starts and the cricket season is over, but Leicester's has been united by their cricket cup victory and Monk leaving the school. Farnie has also been taken out of the school by his father, but repaid the four pounds to Gethryn. Gethryn feels he can now tell Reece and Marriott what happened the day of the M.C.C. match. Wilson hears Gethryn's story, and decides he should tell Norris. In a rugby match, Norris passes the ball to Gethryn, allowing him to make a dramatic score. He explains that Wilson told him the story and all is well between them again. ==Characters== Students at Beckford: *Alan Gethryn, nicknamed \\"the Bishop\\", the Head-prefect of Mr Leicester's House in the Sixth form, member of the First Eleven and First Fifteen, also appears in \\"Personally Conducted\\" *Marriott, a prefect of Leicester's and Gethryn's friend who shares a study with him *Reginald Farnie, Gethryn's supercilious uncle who is four years his junior, member of Leicester's House and the Upper Fourth form *Percy V.

It specialised in the design, build and management of datacentre space. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange until it was acquired by Equinix in January 2016. ==History== Telecity Group plc was the result of the uniting of three separate companies – TeleCity Limited, Redbus Interhouse Limited and Globix Holdings (UK) Limited. TeleCity Limited was founded by Mike Kelly and Anish Kapoor from Manchester University in April 1998 and opened its first data centre in Manchester. At that time 3i Group made an investment of £24 million in the Company. In July 1998, Redbus Interhouse Limited was incorporated, and commenced operations in its first data centre in London Docklands in July 1999. By March 2000, Redbus Interhouse Limited floated on the main market of the London Stock Exchange and in June 2000, TeleCity Limited’s parent company, TeleCity plc floated on the London Stock Exchange. In September 2005, TeleCity plc was taken private by 3i and Oak Hill and by October of that year Telecity Group plc was incorporated and became the holding company of Telecity plc and its group companies in November 2005. In January 2006 Telecity Group acquired Redbus Interhouse plc, a rival business, resulting in the two business, TeleCity and Redbus, trading under the name of TelecityRedbus. Later in 2006 Telecity Group plc bought the European assets of the US-based Globix Corporation.Telecity Redbus to buy Globix UK Following a rebranding exercise implemented in August 2007, TeleCity, Redbus and Globix (UK) began to trade under the name TelecityGroup.

In May 2015, US data company Equinix announced it would be acquiring TelecityGroup for £2.35 billion ($3.6 billion), which would terminate Telecity’s deal with Interxion. Reuters reported that the acquisition of Telecity by Equinix would create the largest data center company in Europe. On 13 November 2015, the European Commission granted clearance for the Equinix offer to acquire Telecity. As part of this acquisition, the European Commission required divestment of eight of the datacentre sites on competition grounds, and these sites were sold to Digital Realty for $874 million. In January 2016, Equinix announced that it had completed the Telecity acquisition in a transaction valued at approximately $3.8 billion. The addition of Telecity data centers more than doubled Equinix's capacity in Europe, making the company the region's largest retail colocation provider. ==Operations== The company operated 37 data centres, located in several European cities: * Amsterdam – 5 (Gyroscoopweg, Science Park, Southeast Amsterdam 2 (Zuidoost), Amstel Business Park, Southeast Amsterdam 5 - (Zuidoost)) * Dublin – 4 (City West Business Campus, Kilcarbery Park, Northwest Business Park Unit 2, Northwest Business Park Unit 14) * Frankfurt – 2 (Lyoner Strasse, Gutleutstrasse) * Helsinki – 5 (Hiomo, Suvilahti, Uspenski, Viikinmäki, Hansa) * Istanbul - 1 (SadeceHosting) * London – 8 (Prospect House - Tottenham Court Road, Oliver’s Yard - Old Street, Powergate - Acton and in Docklands, Sovereign House, Meridian Gate -, Bonnington House, 8&9 Harbour Exchange and 6&7 Harbour Exchange. * Manchester – 4 (Willams & Kilburn House, Reynolds House, Synergy House, Joule House) * Milan – 3 (Via Savona, Basiglio, Via Cascia) * Paris - 3 (Energy Park, Victor Hugo, Condorcet) * Sofia - 1 (Sofia-1) * Stockholm - 2 (Stockholm 1- Bromma, Stockholm 2 - Skondal) * Warsaw - 2 (Warsaw 1(LIM), Warsaw 2) ==References== Category:Computer companies of the United Kingdom Category:Internet architecture Category:Servers (computing) Category:Telecommunications in the United Kingdom Category:Telecommunications in Europe Category:Defunct companies based in London Category:Telecommunications companies established in 1998 Category:2016 mergers and acquisitions Category:Companies formerly listed on the London Stock Exchange ","title":"TelecityGroup"},{"id":"2562800","text":"The Sign of the Twisted Candles is the ninth volume in the Nancy Drew Mystery Stories series. As the second volume written by Walter Karig, it was originally published in 1933 under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene. Due to Karig having died in 1956, as of January 1, 2007, the 1933 book and the other two Nancy Drew books he wrote, have passed into the public domain in Canada and other countries with a life-plus-50 policy. ==Plot summary== In the course of solving the mystery of an old man's disappearing fortune, Nancy both starts and ends a family feud and reveals the identity of an orphan of unknown parentage. The second of three novels by ghostwriter Walter Karig, this story focuses on Nancy's encounter with a 100-year-old man at The Sign of the Twisted Candles, a roadside inn and restaurant. Nancy and her friends, Bess and George, take afternoon tea there while waiting out a storm, where Nancy's roadster is blocked by a fallen tree. They encounter Asa Sidney, celebrating his 100th birthday, and the maid and waitress, Carol Wipple, mistreated by her adoptive parents, Frank and Emma Jemmit. Nancy discovers Mr. Sidney is an elderly relative of Bess and George, and her willingness to communicate with him launches a family feud upon his death a few days later. This leaves Nancy without allies in the family, as the cousins refuse to associate with her. Carol is named as the major benefactress, and Nancy sets out to prove Frank and Emma Jemmit have misappropriated property. Nancy also must discover why Asa was interested in young Carol. Meanwhile, relatives from the Sidney and Boonton families fight over the money. While investigating, Nancy is reunited with her friends. Later, during the climax of the book, she is nearly killed when pushed from a ladder that had been laid against a tower window, illustrated in the original 1933 edition. Carol is discovered to be the great- niece of Asa Sidney; thus she owns the rights to a number of inventions awaiting patents from Sidney, in addition to securities. The family feud is resolved due to Nancy's discoveries. ==Artwork== The original 1933 artwork is by the fashion illustrator Russell H. Tandy, illustrator for the Nancy Drew series from 1930 to 1949. In the original edition, Nancy is shown meeting with Mr. Sidney in a simple summer dress and hat. This edition is noted for its internal art depicting Nancy pushed from a ladder. This illustration and two others were dropped in 1936 and subsequent editions. Bill Gillies' 1950 cover art shows Nancy watching from a window as Frank Jemmit digs a hole outside. A more simply executed version of this image was used for half of the end paper used from 1953 to 1959 (known as the 'Digger' end paper). The end papers show the digging man, while Nancy (in art adapted from The Secret of Red Gate Farm) hides behind a tree and watches. The 1968 cover art shows a flip-haired Nancy near a candle with Asa glowering in the background. This art was also used as a generic cover stock, in red, blue, and pink, for library binding or rebound library copies of all titles in the series. ==References== Category:Nancy Drew books Category:1933 American novels Category:1933 children's books Category:Grosset & Dunlap books ","title":"The Sign of the Twisted Candles"},{"id":"2562813","text":"Four statues depicting omphaloskepsis Navel-gazing or omphaloskepsis is the contemplation of one's navel as an aid to meditation.

The album was released only months after the breakup of Uncle Tupelo, an alternative country band that was the predecessor of Wilco. Prior to its release, there was debate about whether the album would be better than the debut album of Son Volt, the new band of former Uncle Tupelo lead singer Jay Farrar. Although A.M. was released before Son Volt's Trace, critical reviews were modest and initial sales were low. The album was later regarded as a \\"failure\\" by band members, as Trace was a greater success. It was the band's last album to be recorded in a purely alternative country style, as following the record the band began to expand their sound across multiple genres. It is also the only Wilco album to feature Brian Henneman of The Bottle Rockets as a lead guitarist. ==Background and recording== Uncle Tupelo's final album, Anodyne, featured a new lineup for the band—a five-piece outfit with drummer Ken Coomer, bassist John Stirratt, and multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston.Kot 2004. p. 73–75 Tensions mounted between singers Jay Farrar and Jeff Tweedy, and Uncle Tupelo played its last concert on May 1, 1994, at Mississippi Nights in St. Louis, Missouri. Last accessed June 8, 2007.Kot 2004. p. 77 Only days after the breakup, Tweedy decided to form a new group. He was able to retain the lineup of Uncle Tupelo sans Farrar, and rechristened the band Wilco. In mid-May, the band began to rehearse songs in the office of band manager Tony Margherita, and hired producer Brian Paulson, who produced Anodyne. Wilco first recorded demo tracks for the album at Easley studio in Memphis, Tennessee, in June.Kot 2004. p. 89 Stirratt recommended the studio based on previous experience as a member of The Hilltops, and Tweedy had heard of the studio through a Jon Spencer Blues Explosion recording. Reprise Records, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers, signed Jeff Tweedy after hearing the tapes, and recording for the album continued through August.Kot 2004. p. 91Only Jeff Tweedy was signed to the label, gaining exclusive rights to publishing royalties. However, Tweedy did split a portion of these royalties with the band. See Kot 2004 p. 92. Jeff Tweedy was preoccupied with trying to establish Wilco as a viable band on the Reprise label and decided to add another guitarist to the band. Brian Henneman, the lead singer for The Bottle Rockets, was brought into the recording sessions as a lead guitarist.Kot 2004. p. 92 Steel guitarist Lloyd Maines and bassist Daniel Corrigan also contributed to the album. Corrigan also photographed the band for the liner booklet. Howie Weinberg mastered the album, while Barbara Longo provided graphic design.A.M. album notes, March 28, 1995. Reprise Records. Brian Henneman had to leave the band shortly after recording the album, and was replaced by former Titanic Love Affair guitarist Jay Bennett.Kot 2004. p. 94–5 Tweedy also attempted to create a more collaborative environment than Uncle Tupelo, requesting songwriting contributions from other members. John Stirratt submitted three songs, hoping to become a secondary songwriter for Wilco. However, although the songs were recorded as demos, only one (\\"It's Just That Simple\\") was selected to appear on the album, and was the only Stirratt song, and the only song by Wilco not to have lyrics written by Tweedy, to appear on any Wilco album. The album's title is intended to reference Top 40 radio stations, and the tracks reflect a straightforward country-rock sound. The band members felt that they needed to establish themselves outside of the Tupelo fanbase. However, Tweedy later stated that in actuality, they were \\"trying to tread some water with a perceived audience.\\" Tweedy wrote a song about the Uncle Tupelo breakup, but decided that he didn't want any material on that subject matter to appear on the album. (It can be argued, however, that first single \\"Box Full of Letters\\", as well as \\"Too Far Apart\\" allude to the dissolution of Farrar and Tweedy's friendship and working relationship.) Critic and author Greg Kot wrote in Wilco: Learning How to Die that \\"Tweedy's voice and personality are as modest as the arrangements; there's little sense of drama, and virtually no hint of risk. Tweedy attributes some of the straightforwardness of the album to his abuse of marijuana at the time. Shortly after the album, Tweedy stopped smoking pot, to which he credits the introspectiveness of further albums.Kot 2004. p. 96 While Wilco was recording tracks, Jay Farrar formed a band of his own, Son Volt.The band was briefly known as Grain before Trace was completed. Son Volt signed to Warner Bros. Records and began recording their first album (also produced by Paulson), Trace, in November 1994. The fact that both Wilco and Son Volt began working on album almost immediately after the Uncle Tupelo breakup caused debate among critics, fans, and Warner Brothers about which would be the better band.Kot 2004. p. 90 Joe McEwen, who originally signed Uncle Tupelo to a Warner subsidiary, felt that Wilco was taking a step backwards from the material on Anodyne. McEwen urged Richard Dodd, who had recently mixed Tom Petty's Wildflowers, to remix the album. Dodd emphasized Tweedy's vocals to increase the chances of success on radio.Kot 2004. p. 93 Wilco began touring before the album was released. Their live debut was on November 27, 1994, at Cicero's Basement Bar in St. Louis, a venue where Uncle Tupelo had first received significant media attention. The band was billed for that concert as Black Shampoo, a reference to a 1970s B-movie, and the show sold out. Wilco continued to tour for two hundred shows, culminating in show at the South by Southwest Music Conference in Austin, Texas, in March 1995. A.M. was released on Reprise Records on March 28, 1995. ==Commercial and critical reception== A.M. received modest reviews from critics. Holly George-Warren of Rolling Stone called the album \\"one hell of a country-guts debut\\", praising the influence of Gram Parsons and Neil Young on the music. However, the album still received a moderate three-and-a-half star rating. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the album a three-star honorable mention, but called it \\"realist defiance grinding sadly down into realist bathos.\\" The Village Voice placed the album at position 34 on the 1995 Pazz & Jop critics poll. Last accessed July 9, 2007. The band was disappointed by the critical reception, since Trace was met with better reviews.Kot 2004. p. 97 According to Henneman: A.M. only hit number 27 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart, whereas Trace peaked at number 116 on the Billboard 200; by 1997, Trace had outsold A.M. two-to- one. Wilco released \\"Box Full of Letters\\" as a single, but it received little airplay. For the only time in Wilco's career, ticket sales failed to meet expectations. As of 2003, the album had sold about 150,000 copies.Kot 2004. p. 125 ==Track listing== All songs written by Jeff Tweedy unless otherwise noted. #\\"I Must Be High\\" – 2:59 #\\"Casino Queen\\" – 2:45 #\\"Box Full of Letters\\" – 3:05 #\\"Shouldn't Be Ashamed\\" – 3:28 #\\"Pick Up the Change\\" – 2:56 #\\"I Thought I Held You\\" – 3:49 #\\"That's Not the Issue\\" – 3:19 #\\"It's Just That Simple\\" (John Stirratt) – 3:45 #\\"Should've Been in Love\\" – 3:36 #\\"Passenger Side\\" – 3:33 #\\"Dash 7\\" – 3:29 #\\"Blue Eyed Soul\\" – 4:05 #\\"Too Far Apart\\" – 3:44 ==Personnel== *Jeff Tweedy – lead vocals (1–7, 9–13), rhythm guitar (1, 3, 13), acoustic guitar (2, 4–7, 9–12), bass guitar (8) *John Stirratt – bass guitar (1–7, 9, 10, 12, 13), piano (6), organ (13), backing vocals (2, 3, 6), lead vocals/acoustic guitar (8) *Ken Coomer – drums (1–6, 8–10, 12, 13), backing vocals/cowbell (2), a snare drum played with a brush (7) *Max Johnston – dobro (1, 3, 9, 13), fiddle (2, 10), mandolin (4, 8, 10, 12), banjo (5–7), backing vocals (2) *Brian Henneman – lead guitar (1–9, 12, 13), small stoned guitar (10), backing vocals (2) *Daniel Corrigan – backing vocals (2) *Lloyd Maines – pedal steel guitar (1, 6, 8, 11, 12) *Wilco, Brian Henneman and Daniel Corrigan – handclaps, crowd noise, glass cheers (2) ===Production=== *Daniel Corrigan – photography *James SK Wān - wardrobe *Richard Dodd – mixing *Barbara Longo – design *Brian Paulson – producer, engineer, mixing *Howie Weinberg – mastering *Wilco – producer, engineer *Bob Andrews – Production Coordinator ==Notes== ==References== * Category:1995 debut albums Category:Wilco albums Category:Albums produced by Brian Paulson Category:Reprise Records albums Category:Sire Records albums Category:Albums produced by Jeff Tweedy ","title":"A.M.

The actual author was ghostwriter Walter Karig in his third and final Nancy Drew novel and his final appearance for the Stratemeyer Syndicate. Due to Karig passing away in 1956, this book and his other two Nancy Drews, as of January 1, 2007, have passed into the public domain in Canada and other countries with a life-plus-50 policy. ==Plot summaries== === 1933 edition=== The story opens with Nancy tending her prize delphiniums when a mysterious carrier pigeon lands in her yard. Nancy contacts the registry for the carrier pigeon. Meanwhile, housekeeper Hannah Gruen takes a fall and must be treated at the local orthopedist's office. Her attending physician, Dr. Spires, confides to Carson Drew and Nancy that he was forced to tend an elderly woman for her shoulder under peculiar circumstances: the driver of a car blindfolded him when they drove him there, so he would not be able to guess her location, but the doctor believes their destination might have been someplace called Larkspur Lane. Events led him to believe the patient was being held prisoner. The only clue to the woman's identity is a bracelet with a family crest. Nancy, of course, sets out to track the crest, discovering it belongs to the Eldridge family of St. Louis. In the meantime, the pigeon registry contacts Nancy about the bird, suspecting criminality is involved. Effie Schneider, a foolish girl who serves as Hannah's substitute, gets in on the action when Nancy attempts to track the carrier pigeon's flight into the country. A ferocious woman attacks Nancy and steals the bracelet from her. Due to threats of intruders and increasing danger, the Drews temporarily retreat and accept Helen Corning's invitation to visit Sylvan Lake. Coincidentally, Nancy rescues a young Eldridge child from a mishap at the lake and learns that an elderly relative is missing. Nancy and Helen explore the vicinity, finally finding \\"L.S. Lane\\". Near the little-used road is an estate surrounded by delphiniums and an electrified fence. Elderly patients are outside on the grounds. Mrs. Eldridge is also outside near the fence and reveals she is indeed a prisoner. Nancy and Helen disguise themselves as an old lady and her nurse, and enter using the password \\"singing horses\\". Nancy reaches Mrs. Eldridge and rescues her. She sends Eldridge safely away with Helen before being imprisoned by the evil doctor and his partners, who kidnap wealthy, elderly people and force them to sign over money and securities. Nancy escapes from her cistern prison and sabotages the crooks' getaway airplane just as the police arrive. ===1966 revision=== The word \\"The\\" is dropped from the title. The plot is similar, although condensed. Bess and George are included in more of the action. A subplot involving supernatural events at Helen Corning Archer's in-laws' summer place on Sylvan Lake (ghostly blue wheels of rolling fire) leads Nancy there. The butler, Morgan, is involved in minor crimes as well. Bess accompanies Nancy in the rescue operation instead of Helen, with Bess dressing like a nurse and George the ailing party. ==Film adaptation== In 1938, the story was used as the basis for Nancy Drew, Detective, the first of four Nancy Drew movies, starring Bonita Granville. ==Television== An episode of the Nancy Drew television series is named \\"The Lady of Larkspur Lane\\". In the episode, Nancy, Ned and George visit the local insane asylum who is named Larkspur Lane. ==Artwork== The original 1933 artwork is by the fashion illustrator Russell H. Tandy, illustrator for the Nancy Drew series from 1930 to 1949. Tandy's original dust jacket artwork remained in print until 1962, long after most early volume dust jackets had been modernized for 1950s readers by illustrator Bill Gillies. The original art shows Nancy in a genuflection position wearing a very full, loose dress. Collectors speculate publisher Grosset & Dunlap commissioned an updated illustration of the same scene during the transition from Gillies to new series artist Rudy Nappi in 1953. However, due to the presentation of Nancy posed crouching in a pencil skirt, the new painting may have shown an indiscreet display of her thigh where the slim skirt crept above Nancy's knees. Presumably, this was deemed inappropriate for American readers and the artwork was shelved. This art later appeared on British dust jackets for this volume in 1960. ==References== Category:1933 American novels Category:Nancy Drew books Category:American novels adapted into films Category:Grosset & Dunlap books Category:1966 American novels Category:1933 children's books Category:1966 children's books sv:Kitty och armbandsmysteriet ","title":"The Password to Larkspur Lane"},{"id":"2562820","text":"The Calvin Coolidge Memorial Bridge is a major crossing of the Connecticut River in western Massachusetts, connecting the towns of Northampton and Hadley. The bridge carries Route 9 across the river, where it connects to Interstate 91. == History and construction of the bridge == The Calvin Coolidge Memorial Bridge is a five-span, single intersection Warren deck truss bridge with distinctive design on its granite-faced abutment pylons. Art Deco ornamentation on the pylons includes carved eagles and incised carved lettering. The bridge, a replacement of a previous structure destroyed in the 1936 flood, was funded under the Hayden Cartwright Act, one of the numerous federal aid programs designed to provide construction jobs during the Great Depression. It was designed by W & L Engineering Co. in conjunction with Maurice A. Reidy as consultant and Desmond and Lord as architects. The bridge was built by T. Stuart & Sons. The bridge was named as a memorial to President Calvin Coolidge (1872–1933), a longtime resident and former mayor of Northampton. Coolidge was elected to the State Senate and the governorship of Massachusetts before being elected President of the United States. A bronze memorial plaque of Calvin Coolidge is mounted on the northeast and southwest pylons. The bridge features large, distinctive granite-faced pylons in the Art Deco style, measuring 15 by 27 feet at the base. On the northwest and southeast pylons are bronze doors that provide access to small rooms. Art deco eagle detail The welded steel Art Deco bridge rail is mounted at the back of the sidewalk on the north side of the bridge and on the bridge parapet on the south side where there is no sidewalk. It is a weathered green color. Integral to the rail are light standard posts supporting cobra head luminaires. The cobra head luminaires replaced the original low-pressure sodium lamp fixtures developed by General Electric. These lamps were based on a European model and introduced to the U.S. market in 1933. However, the yellow/orange, monochromatic light produced by the luminaire ultimately became unpopular with the motoring public, and use of the lamps was discontinued as color-corrected light sources became available. Southeast anchor of the bridge, with bronze door, showing art deco styleIn 2001, the Massachusetts Highway Department began a major improvement of the Coolidge Bridge, that cost a total of $32 million which included: *Widening the bridge from 3 lanes to 4 lanes, i.e., 2 travel lanes in each direction *Replacement of the deteriorated bridge deck *Refurbishing the historic Art Deco bridge railing and integrated light fixtures *Cleaning and restoration of all granite facing *Installation of a new 5-foot sidewalk on the north side of the bridge *Repairing and improving the bridge approach roadways In 2007 the Massachusetts Historical Commission determined that the Calvin Coolidge Bridge was not eligible for individual listing in the National Register of Historic Places but was eligible for listing as a contributing element in the (then) pending expansion of the Hadley Center Historic District. In 1994, the bridge was included as a contributing element to the Hadley Center Historic District. The bridge is a major bottleneck in Hampshire County, with the busy Route 9 as the sole thoroughfare between the college towns of Northampton and Amherst. The road approaching the bridge is known as Bridge St. in Northampton (eastbound) and Russell St. in Hadley (westbound). == See also == * List of crossings of the Connecticut River == References == Category:Bridges over the Connecticut River Category:Buildings and structures in Northampton, Massachusetts Category:Bridges completed in 1937 Category:Art Deco architecture in Massachusetts Category:Bridges in Hampshire County, Massachusetts Category:Road bridges in Massachusetts Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hampshire County, Massachusetts Category:Road bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts Category:Historic district contributing properties in Massachusetts Category:Steel bridges in the United States Category:Warren truss bridges in the United States ","title":"Calvin Coolidge Bridge"},{"id":"2562829","text":"Bisto is a popular and well-known brand of gravy and other food products in the United Kingdom and Ireland currently owned by Premier Foods ==History== The first Bisto product, in 1908, was a meat-flavoured gravy powder, which rapidly became a bestseller in the UK.

Paxo was devised in 1901 by John Crampton, a butcher from Eccles near Manchester, who wanted to have something extra to sell to his customers shopping for their Sunday lunch menus. In the beginning sales growth of Paxo was slow because stuffing is mainly served with chickens and poultry was then traditionally regarded as a luxury. As the price of chickens dropped and that of red meats rose in the 1950s and 1960s, Paxo's popularity grew. At Christmas, the product is advertised with the slogan \\"Christmas wouldn't be Christmas without the Paxo\\" (a play on the phrase \\"Christmas wouldn't be Christmas without the turkey\\").

It stars Charlie Chaplin, Edna Purviance, and Leo White. This film was not an official Chaplin film, even though it has many Chaplin-directed scenes; after he left the studio,Essanay edited it together using outtakes and newly shot footage directed by Leo White. It had already been established in court that Chaplin had no legal control over the films made during his time with Essanay and could not prevent its release. ==Cast== * Charles Chaplin as The Janitor * Edna Purviance as Maid * Leo White as Count and Flophouse keeper * Billy Armstrong as Cook and Pickpocket * James T. Kelley as Singing Drunk * Bud Jamison as Tramp * Wesley Ruggles as Crook * Albert Austin as Policeman * 'Snub' Pollard as Flophouse tramp (uncredited) ==Synopsis== Charlie (Chaplin) takes a job as a janitor in the home of Colonel Nutt (unidentified actor), a munitions manufacturer. As the butler (unidentified actor) introduces Charlie to the ill-tempered cook (Billy Armstrong), Colonel Nutt demonstrates his new wireless explosive device to his daughter (unidentified actress). Meanwhile, agents of the \\"Pretzelstrass\\" meet with the Count (Leo White) to devise a plan to get at Colonel Nutt's device. Charlie carelessly dumps garbage all over the maid (Edna Purviance) and her freshly cleaned floor. He takes the trash can and dumps it over the fence, inundating the Count in the process. Back in the kitchen, the maid scolds Charlie, but then becomes emotional, and he comforts her. The Count enters the house, and is hit by a wet rag thrown by the maid, but intended for Charlie. The Count tosses it off to the side, and it winds up hitting the cook, and when the cook begins to act cruelly towards the maid in return, Charlie sticks up for her. The Count makes his way to the Colonel, who rejects his offers and has the Count ejected by the butler. His day's work done, Charlie makes his way to a flophouse for a night's sleep. At this point, a pickpocket (Wesley Ruggles) holds up the Count, but instead of taking his money he agrees to join the caper to liberate Dr. Nutt of his invention. The conversation is overheard by a cop, who then runs off to inform his fellow officers, who are in an abandoned lot, shooting craps. They storm the Nutt house, disrupting its resident, but explain to him that they \\"are on the trail of a great robbery.\\" Back at the flophouse, Charlie is prevented from settling down by a loud, singing drunk (James T. Kelley) whom he eventually—and somewhat affectionately—dispatches with a champagne bottle. A thief (also Billy Armstrong) steals in during the night and robs the singing drunk, and although Charlie takes what he thinks are adequate precautions, he is also robbed. Charlie disguises himself under the blankets and manages to get his money back from the thief, but when the thief tries to stab him it wakes everyone up and a fight breaks among all of the men. Charlie manages to escape, dodging several cops on the way. However, he runs into the pickpocket on the street; recognizing him as an old friend, Charlie agrees to help him find a target, and leads him to the Nutt house. The cops are all still there; lying around, smoking, waiting for something to happen. Pandemonium breaks out when the pickpocket enters the house, and amid the chaos, Colonel Nutt's explosive device is detonated, blowing all of the cops skyward. In the aftermath, the pickpocket is buried in a heap of rubble and Charlie is seen poking his head out of the kitchen stove.https://archive.org/details/CC_1918_xx_xx_TripleTrouble ==History and background== Chaplin's contract with Essanay ended at the beginning of 1916 when he went to Mutual. Police, released on May 27, was his last authorized title with the company. On April 9, 1916 Essanay issued a re-edited version of Chaplin's completed film Burlesque on Carmen but padded with additional material to bring it to a four-reel length. Chaplin filed suit on May 6, but to no avail, as on July 8 the court determined that Essanay had the right to reinvent the client work Chaplin had done for them in any way that they saw fit.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0006497/combined This opened the door to a number of subsequent Essanay-Chaplin compilations and re-releases such as The Essanay-Chaplin Revue of 1916 and Chase Me Charlie (1918). According to publicity material that appeared at the time of its release in August 1918, Triple Trouble represented a new wrinkle in Essanay's strategy: \\"If you bought a piece of real estate and foresaw that its value would quadruple if you held it a certain length of time, what would you do? That's just what we did with Triple Trouble. [...] We knew there would come a time when it would be worth many times its weight in gold. We held this negative in our vaults for the most opportune time of release, which we believe is NOW.\\"George K. Spoor -- \\"COMING! A Band New CHARLIE CHAPLIN Comedy.\\" Moving Picture World, August 3, 1918 Such hyperbole is somewhat disingenuous; in 1915, Chaplin had begun work on Life, his first feature-length comedy, but Essanay had stepped in and stopped the production as Chaplin was taking too long—what they really needed was one-reel subjects to fill then voracious public demand for Chaplin's work. Essanay created Triple Trouble, their last \\"new\\" Chaplin comedy, by taking at least one—and perhaps two—sequences that had been intended for the unfinished Life, bridging them with outtakes from Police, and through borrowing the ending from Work (1915). In addition, Essanay contrived new material to pad it out to the length of a two-reeler, the standard for comedies by this time; this material was shot in 1918 and directed by character actor Leo White. Though White appeared, most often uncredited, in close to 2000 films, Triple Trouble is the only credit he ever received for direction, and it has been suggested that White was strong-armed into the task.Ted Okuda & David Maska -- Charlie Chaplin at Keystone and Essanay: Birth of the Tramp. iUniverse, Lincoln, Nebraska, 2005 Certainly Chaplin never held it against him, as he continued to hire White as a supporting actor in his own films into the 1940s. Nevertheless, Chaplin's own response was swift; a telegram from Chaplin published in the August 10, 1918 issue of Moving Picture World reads, \\"THIS IS NOT A NEW CHAPLIN BUT FROM THE ADVERTISING LAYOUT IN TRADE REVIEW MUST BE NOTHING BUT THE DISCARDED PORTIONS OF POLICE THE LAST PICTURE MADE BY CHARLIE CHAPLIN FOR ESSANAY FIRST NATIONAL SHOULD STOP THESE MISLEADING STATEMENTS AND ADVERTISING WHICH MUST BE STAMPED OUT.\\"Charlie Chaplin via J. D. Williams -- \\"Trade Papers Announcing Essay Issue of 'Triple Trouble'.\\" Moving Picture World, August 11, 1918 ==Legacy and preservation== Evaluations of the finished film vary; even in 1918, The Moving Picture World called it an \\"atrocious patch quilt of ancient slapstick reels.\\" A review on the imdb refers to it as \\"Chaplin's worst film. The story doesn't make any sensehttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0007476/combined\\" and indeed, the continuity in Triple Trouble is very difficult to follow; the pickpocket knows where the house is as the Count has already directed him towards it, yet he is still looking for a place to rob later in the film, and Charlie directs him towards the house again, presumably double-crossing his employer in the process. In Police, the scene is taken from the opposite angle. Nevertheless, some have found value in Triple Trouble; in their 1965 book The Films of Charlie Chaplin, Gerald D. McDonald, Michael Conway and Mark Ricci stated that the film \\"has remarkable continuity and the pieces fit together, almost miraculously.Gerald D. McDonald, Michael Conway and Mark Ricci -- The Films of Charlie Chaplin. Citadel Press, New York, NY 1965\\" Walter Kerr, in his seminal 1975 book The Silent Clowns, stated that the film was \\"worthless, except for what it can tell us about the vein Chaplin was tempted to explore in his own kind of feature.Walter Kerr -- The Silent Clowns. Alfred A. Knopf, New York, NY 1975\\" As it was, Chaplin did not make an actual feature until The Kid (1921), and he seemed to agree with that aspect of the inherent value of Triple Trouble through including the title in the filmography attached to his autobiography in 1964.Charlie Chaplin -- My Autobiography. Simon & Schuster, New York, NY 1964 For Essanay, however, their claim that Triple Trouble \\"would be worth many times its weight in gold\\" apparently did not pan out. Burdened by the fallout from the loss of final appeals relating to the U.S. Government's anti-trust suit against former Motion Picture Patents Trust companies and an inability to compete in a market dominated by features, Triple Trouble was practically the last new film that Essanay produced. It was followed by a trickle of reissues of older titles that finally petered out in 1920. ==Controversy== There is considerable controversy as to whether the flophouse sequence in Triple Trouble was footage trimmed from Police or part of the uncompleted project Life. The Essanay description of Police filed with the Library of Congress at the time of copyright on May 12, 1916 indicates a deleted scene similar to the content in Triple Trouble: \\"[Charlie] goes to a lodging house and in order to save his dollar from thieves puts it in his mouth, swallowing it while he sleeps. A crook robs the men in the lodging house but Chaplin takes the money from him. This starts a battle.\\"https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/alt.movies.chaplin/otUsWd9mTQs As part of his television documentary The Chaplin Puzzle (1992), director Don McGlynn included a reconstruction of Police which attempted to re-incorporate the flophouse sequence from Triple Trouble into the earlier film. Some Chaplin scholars felt that the result was unconvincing and that certain incompatible details between the flophouse sequence which remains in Police and that from Triple Trouble indicate that the Triple Trouble material is merely a similar scene, but one derived from an independent project. The issue is regarded as unresolved. ==Preservation and home video status== As a Chaplin film in the public domain, sources for Triple Trouble are numerous, and it circulated in 8 and 16mm in the era of home film collecting. The Images DVD version on Chaplin's Essanay Comedies Volume 3 has been adjudged the best available in that—for the most part—it is derived from a 35mm print, and includes one shot that does not appear in other versions.Silent Era entry on the dvd Chaplin's Essanay Comedies Volume 3 ==References* * Progressive Silent Film List entry on Triple Trouble Category:Short films directed by Charlie Chaplin Category:1918 films Category:American black-and- white films Category:American silent short films Category:1918 comedy films Category:Essanay Studios films Category:American films Category:American comedy films ","title":"Triple Trouble (1918 film)"},{"id":"2562854","text":"Cherie and Renno, formerly known as Izabo, are an Israeli duo that was formed in 1989. Their musical style is diverse, ranging from indie rock, disco and Middle Eastern music. Under the name Izabo, they represented Israel at the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, with the song \\"Time\\". ==Biography== Izabo was founded in Petah Tikva in 1989. Their original line-up consisted of Ran Shem Tov, Shiri Hadar, Nir Graf and Tamir Muskat. In 1994, they released their first album titled Movie Maker along with three singles. This album is often omitted from Izabo's chronology and songs from it are never played in live concerts. The band's line-up changed following the release of the album and again in 1997, with the final line-up, which remained for 19 years, consisting of founders Shem Tov and Hadar, as well as Jonathan Levy and Nir Mantzur. Their sophomore album, The Fun Makers, was released in late 2003 and received highly positive critical acclaim, with the songs \\"Morning Hero\\" and \\"Cook Me\\" achieving major radio success in Israel. Several months later, Izabo signed on to Sony BMG, through which they released their British debut, The Morning Hero EP. The release was accompanied by a concert tour during which Izabo performed in England, Scotland and the Netherlands. Izabo collaborated with a large variety of artists, on stage and in studio, from singer-songwriter Ahuva Ozeri to choreographer Ohad Naharin. Izabo's collaboration with Shotei Hanevuah produced the single \\"Hu\\", which won the Music 24's \\"song of the year\\" award. Their third LP, Super Light, was released in July 2008. On March 26, 2012, Izabo released an EP titled Summer Shade. The EP included the 2012 singles \\"Summer Shade\\", \\"On My Way\\" and \\"I Like It\\", the band's final singles under the name Izabo. In early February it was revealed that Izabo had been chosen by a group of mass communications and music industry experts to represent Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 in Baku, Azerbaijan. The song, Time, has verses in English and choruses in Hebrew. However, they did not manage to make it past the semi-final. On the May 21, 2012, they released the album Life Is on My Side in the UK, through 100% Records. In 2016, Nir Mantzur and Jonathan Levy left the band, and the band changed its name to Cherie and Renno. Two years later, Cherie and Renno released a self-titled album.

The TV show was produced and aired by TV Sarajevo in three separate installments, from 1984 until 1991. It originated from a 15-minute radio comedy segment, broadcast as part of the Primus program on Radio Sarajevo's channel Two during the early 1980s. After establishing a core radio audience locally in the city of Sarajevo, Top lista nadrealista got spun off into a television sketch series. Two more series of shows on television followed, making household names of its protagonists all over SFR Yugoslavia and helping launch successful television, film, and music careers for some of them (most notably Nele Karajlić and Branko \\"Đuro\\" Đurić). The show initially stayed away from politics entirely, mostly relying on youthful improvisation for laughs. Towards the late 1980s and early 1990s, in the second and third series, respectively, during which it created some of its most effective and memorable sketches, Top lista nadrealista incorporated political satire along with cogent depictions of mentality of the peoples of SFR Yugoslavia. The show became so popular that even some of the language and phrasing used in sketches entered public vernacular (see Hrkljuš). In the late 1980s and early 1990s, many sketches dealt with current political situation which was a prelude to Yugoslav Wars. Certain sketches proved to be prophetic, as they portrayed things like the city of Sarajevo being divided between different states, a single family split into two clans and warring over control of rooms in their apartment, UN peacekeeping force's adding fuel to the conflict, etc. In the context of the Yugoslav Wars that already began during the show's third series, Nadrealisti held a clear pacifist posture, often using absurdity and dark hyperbole when portraying rising ethnic tensions imminent war in SR Bosnia and Herzegovina (e.g. warning that \\"peace may break out and ruin Bosnian harmonious war\\" or giving alarming instructions on \\"how the public should act in case of peace\\"). ==Radio segment (1981–1985)== ===Background=== In late 1979 on Radio Sarajevo's Channel Two, Boro Kontić took over the hosting duties of Primus, a radio show that had been on the air since 6 January 1979. Kontić thus inherited the weekly Saturday morning 8-11am show from the previous host Jovo Došlo who decided to leave the radio business altogether and move back to Mostar. A young man in his mid-twenties, Kontić introduced two new segments — Šta je pisac htio da kaže involving translations of the English language music hits into Serbo-Croatian and the other named Top lista nadrealista, a 15-minute free format envisioned as a showcase for talented local youngsters. On 10 November 1979, the Top lista nadrealista segment aired for the first time on Primus featuring a group of protagonists that didn't stick around past one or two weeks. Over the following year and a half, the segment functioned as somewhat of a revolving door featuring a multitude of participants none of whom would keep showing up long enough to develop any continuity. Always on the lookout for fresh talent to bring on the show for the Top lista nadrealista segment, by early 1981, through his younger budding musician brother Saša KontićNele Karajlic @ Vece sa Ivanom Ivanovićem;Prva TV, 21 December 2012 as well as Saša's classmate and Ozbiljno Pitanje bandmate Zlatko \\"Zlaja\\" Arslanagić,Boro Kontić;Gracija.ba Boro Kontić became aware of a group of kids in their late teens from Sarajevo's Koševo neighborhood, each one involved with music as well as other forms of artistic expression. Saša Kontić and Arslanagić approached Zenit Đozić and Nele Karajlić, two of the members of the recently formed garage punk rock band Zabranjeno Pušenje, who after some initial trepidation on Nele's part accepted the offer of taking over the Top lista nadrealista segment, which had been airing on Primus for some eighteen months already.KAD JE ŽIVOT BIO ČUDO;aplauz.netKAD JE ŽIVOT BIO ČUDO;aplauz.net ===Debut=== Their debut fifteen-minute segment took place on Saturday, 9 May 1981 and was conceptualized as a faux terrorist takeover of the radio station with the terrorists reading out their manifesto along with a list of demands. These included: more young bands on radio and television, Dom mladih (Youth Center) being returned to those it nominally belongs to — the youth, removal of older radio executives from the station, more punk on the daily radio playlists, etc. Unbridled, raw, and unscripted, the debut segment done by Nele Karajlić, Zenit Đozić, Roki, Rizo Petranović, Zlaja Arslanagić, and Saša Kontić set the tone for what was to come: juvenile behaviour, infantile jokes, raucous street energy, with occasional cogent observation hinting at deeper social issues — all seldom heard prior on the buttoned-up state-run radio in communist Yugoslavia. The only adults in the mix were the Primus host and editor Boro Kontić and his sound engineer Husein Vladavić, both of whom were present behind the scenes during the segment tapings, but did not take part in them on the microphone. Right after the debut show, Boro Kontić asked his younger brother Saša not to come any longer. Karajlić would later speculate in his memoir Kontić did so realizing right away the amount of scrutiny segment would be under from the radio higher-ups thus not wanting the added pressure of having a close family member there. Roki also stopped coming after the debut show. In turn, Karajlić brought along Boris Šiber, a neighbourhood buddy from Koševo, while Zenit brought in Dražen \\"Para\\" Ričl, another Koševo lad. Though the attendance was spotty throughout the segment's run, five guys — Nele Karajlić, Zenit Đozić, Zlatko Arslanagić, Boris Šiber, and Dražen Ričl — established themselves as the core of the Top lista nadrealista segment over its initial weeks and months on the air. ===Immediate local popularity in Sarajevo=== The group's creative modus operandi consisted of getting together every Thursday in Šetalište, a kafana located in Sutjeska Street (around the corner from the Radio Sarajevo building at 7 Danijela Ozme Street) a couple of hours before their scheduled 9pm studio taping in order to come up with bits for that week's segment. Under their command, the segment became a complete free format — sometimes a single bit for the entire fifteen minutes, other times a weekly recap through satirical commentary of recent local and global events. Since the attendance was always very unstable, the taping sometimes involved bringing random people from Šetalište into the studio for bits. Uncoordinated and chaotic as well as airing at an unpopular timeslot, Saturdays at 10:15am, when most of its target demographic is fast asleep, the segment nevertheless rapidly gained popularity among young listeners and soon became the staple of Primus. Getting around the early timeslot, many youngsters resorted to recording the segment on audio cassettes and sharing; scenes of young people in bars listening to segments they taped off radio were not uncommon around the city. It wasn't long before a move to television was suggested and the first steps to that end arranged by TV Sarajevo. However, following a few screen tests that essentially consisted of the group doing their radio schtick before cameras, the television executives deemed them too unpolished and sent them back to radio. As its popularity grew, 'Top lista nadrealista' segment slightly expanded from topical humour to include longer bits, played in installments. Some of the more popular sketches included \\"Bata brani u Sarajevu\\" (a takeoff on the famous partisan film Valter brani Sarajevo) and rock opera \\"Kemmy\\" (parody of The Who's Tommy). By March 1983, some of the individuals in and around this often intertwining group of budding radio personalities, musicians, and comedians came up with an idea of putting all of that activity under a single definition banner - thus giving birth to New Primitives, an entity that functioned as something between a (sub)cultural movement and a cheap public relations ploy. ===Musical synergy=== Most members of the on-air radio crew were involved with music. Since 1980, Karajlić had been fronting a garage rock group called Zabranjeno Pušenje together with his buddy and neighbour Sejo Sexon while early lineups included Đozić who played drums with even Elvis J. Kurtović and Šiber spending some time in the band. Furthermore, Zlatko Arslanagić and Dražen Ričl played together in a band called Ozbiljno Pitanje and after the group disbanded, Ričl started playing alongside Elvis J. Kurtović and Rizo Petranović in a band called Elvis J. Kurtović & His Meteors, initially the most established group of the lot since they were the first to get a recording contract (with ZKP RTVLj).Elvis J. Kurtovic - Smoke on the water - Live 1983 The synergy of weekly radio appearances along with constant gigging around Sarajevo in student hangouts (Trasa, Kuk, Cedus, etc.) created a bit of local buzz that benefited both the radio and the music side of things. By early 1984, Zabranjeno Pušenje finally got the record deal it was after (with Jugoton no less) while Top lista nadrealista developed enough of a following among the Sarajevo youth that it got a second shot on television in June 1984. ===Expansion to television=== The weekly radio segment continued in parallel with the television episodes and the success of Pušenje's debut album. Good sales of the album combined with the satisfactory reception of the television episodes prompted the release of Top lista nadrealista radio material on audio cassette tape by Diskoton. Produced by Boro Kontić, it consisted of the troupe's best radio sketches. However, the so-called 'Marshal affair' that Nele Karajlić and Zabranjeno Pušenje got themselves into put a damper on many activities. First, the 11-episode Top lista nadrealista run on television ended in late December 1984. Then, the Top lista nadrealista audio cassette tape's promotional cycle got blocked on administrative orders from above — becoming unavailable for sale in general circulation, only through traveling salesmen. Nevertheless, it still managed to sell 10,000 copies.Cenzura na radiju 80-ih, media.ba, 6 December 2012 Finally, during March 1985, the Top lista nadrealista segment got taken off radiowaves for good. ==First television series (1984)== Top lista nadrealista's switch to television came about through Erna Perić, TV Sarajevo executive in charge of folk music programming, who came up with an idea for a prime time show of folk music numbers with comedy sketches in- between each song. Though not at all fitting into the folk music milieu, the group accepted the offer of being the comedy filler on a folk music show as it meant exposure to a whole new audience they would normally never reach on the radio. They started shooting sketches in April 1984, a few months following the Sarajevo Winter Olympics. In addition to the radio five of Nele, Zenit, Para, Šiber, and Zlaja, the group was now joined by soon to be twenty-two- year-old Branko Đurić, local journalism student, musician, and aspiring actor, whom they had befriended at the Dedan kafana in Sarajevo where he had a knack for spontaneously entertaining the crowd by doing impressions. The show debuted on 2 June 1984, airing Tuesdays at 8:00pm on TVSa2 (TV Sarajevo's channel 2) while also shown in the rest of SFR Yugoslavia through JRT system. Directed by Davor Marjanović who got joined by Vuk Janić after a few episodes, and with Nele Karajlić, Branko Đurić, Zenit Đozić, Boris Šiber, and Dražen Ričl as main on-camera protagonists (Zlatko Arslanagić participated in several sketches in later episodes), their sketches retained the same structure and form they had on radio. Around 45 minutes long, episodes featured between five and eight folk music numbers performed by popular folk singers of the day like Halid Bešlić, Ferid Avdić, Šaban Šaulić, Hanka Paldum, Zehra Deović, Himzo Polovina, Zaim Imamović, etc. with sketches in-between mostly tied together by a common theme presented in installments over multiple episodes. A number of sketches revolved around parodying a fictional TV station — usually as the opening bit of each episode — with recurring characters: news anchor Mitrije Crnica (played by Karajlić) and the station's security doorman played by Đuro whose catchphrase \\"Ćega, ba\\" caught on quickly. Another running parody based on Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet featured young lovers Sejo and Seada falling in love despite their respective families supporting bitter cross-town football rivals FK Sarajevo and FK Željezničar. They also lampooned Star Trek with a running multiple-installment bit called \\"Burek u svemiru\\" that portrays a space crew on a mission to find the best burek in universe. Another running bit featured Fu-Do (played by Đozić), righteous vigilante well-versed in martial arts who protects the citizens of several Sarajevo local communities from various ills — from ruthless smugglers selling counterfeit clothing to open market re-sellers offering food at marked-up prices. Furthermore, actual events taking place as the series was shot – such as Yugoslavia's preparation for Euro 1984 or Rajko Janjanin's European Cup hat-trick versus Benfica – provided fodder for the sketches. Allusions to political figures and events were off-limits on the show. By closely sifting through sketch ideas and their implementation, applying censorship as needed, the state-owned and party- controlled TV Sarajevo made sure the show stays away from overt political commentary and direct social criticism.Dr Nele Karajlić: Strahovao sam od Haga!;Kurir, 12 December 2012 It didn't take too long for the show to start getting a bit of a wider following though at first it proved a challenge. Its core demographic - Sarajevo youth - was on board all along, but getting viewership in other demographics and other parts of the country took some time. Once obtained, this newly found popularity was in large part based on the abundance of colloquialisms and local Sarajevo street parlance - none of which could be seen up to that point on the very buttoned-up Yugoslav TV. In total, eleven episodes were aired during the first season. Considering each one of the six protagonists was in their early twenties, the sketches expectedly centered around exuberance and improvisation, which dominated over the written material. ===Reception=== According to Karajlić, speaking in 2010, the first instalment of Nadrealisti was \\"the result of our youthful hysteria and it relied more on raw energy than brains\\".Naši ljudi;Televizija Istočno Sarajevo, November 2010 Elvis J. Kurtović, a friend of the crew who was involved with the show in limited creative capacity, said in 2005: \\"Back when we were kids those Top lista nadrealista episodes were done by people who didn't know jack-squat about television and who shot everything in a single take and on first try. When you watch those episodes today you can see that many of them are badly directed and produced. Not all of them, there're some good ones, but the first series is particularly horrible in this regard\\".Interview Elivisa J.Kurtovica;5 December 2005Specijalni Interview Elivisa J.Kurtovica, za K-R-U-G Bar TREMA;5 December 2005 ===Zabranjeno Pušenje takes off as result of Top lista nadrealista on television=== As mentioned, in parallel with Top lista nadrealista, Karajlić also fronted a punk rock band called Zabranjeno Pušenje that released its debut album barely two months before the show's premiere on television. Released by Jugoton, the record was out in limited circulation of 3,000 copies, a number clearly indicative of the label's modest expectations, especially after the poor sales of Elvis J. Kurtović & His Meteors' debut album barely a few months earlier.Rockovnik - Anarhija All Over Bascarsija (Jugoslovenska rock scena 1983. - 1985.);RTS, 2006 However, following Top lista nadrealista's television debut, the Zabranjeno Pušenje album started selling surprisingly well, crossing the mark of 100,000 copies sold in the end. Though none of the other five Top lista nadrealista performers were official Zabranjeno Pušenje members at this point, the two projects frequently overlapped, creating synergy that ultimately helped the popularity of both. By early summer 1984, Top lista nadrealista started getting bit of a wider audience, which in turn helped the sales of the Zabranjeno Pušenje album. By late September, the band sold enough records for a Yugoslavia-wide tour to take place. Karajlić thus devoted more time to the band's tour than to the TV show whose production was now scheduled around his band obligations. The band's success on the road was rapid, and by November they were selling out sports arenas. During a concert in Rijeka in late November 1984, Karajlić made a pun after the Marshall amplifier broke down, jokingly announcing to the crowd: \\"The Marshall has croaked! .... I mean the amplifier\\", indirectly alluding to the late Yugoslav lifetime leader Josip Broz Tito who held the military rank of Marshal and who had died four years earlier. The seemingly innocuous statement delivered in jest in-between two songs at a rock concert soon created a firestorm of controversy as various state and communist party bodies went after the band, targeting Karajlić specifically. For weeks and months during late 1984 and early 1985, the print media was full of articles condemning the band over the statement while its gigs were being cancelled. In order to cope with the new situation, the band opted to stay out of the public eye for the time being, which also meant putting the show on hiatus indefinitely. ==Second television series (1989)== ===Background=== It would be more than five years before Top lista nadrealista returned for the second installment in fall 1989. In the meantime, some of its protagonists achieved a lot of success in other arenas. Nele Karajlić had become a veritable country-wide celebrity and a sought-after media personality with an eye-catching stage persona as the vocalist of Zabranjeno Pušenje that had put out two more successful albums since its breakout debut one and was about to release its fourth. His TV profile had further been raised via starring in Timothy John Byford's 1988 kids show Tragom ptice Dodo on TV Sarajevo. A couple of years earlier, Karajlić had overcome the potentially career-ending 'Marshal affair' with the initially bombastic verbal offense court case against him eventually quietly concluded with a symbolic monetary fine. Branko Đurić was in the process of also becoming quite well-known courtesy of his budding acting career with memorable roles in Audicija comedy show as well as films like Ovo malo duše, Dom za vješanje, Kuduz, and Kako je propao rokenrol while also maintaining a bit of a musical career with Bombaj Štampa. Finally, after its commercially disappointing debut, Dražen Ričl made one more album with Elvis J. Kurtovich & His Meteors, but left right after in spring 1985 as the group effectively disbanded anyway. At the time of their breakup, Ričl had already been in the process of reuniting with old Ozbiljno Pitanje bandmate Zlatko Arslanagić to establish a new band with a softer, pop- rock sound and the two soon unveiled Crvena Jabuka, a group that immediately started taking off commercially on the scene. However, he died on 1 October 1986 from the injuries sustained in a car accident two weeks earlier near Jablanica en route to a Mostar gig in support of their debut album. Zlatko Arslanagić was also in the same car but survived the crash, and after getting over severe depression decided to continue Crvena Jabuka, but did not return for Top lista nadrealista's second series. ===Preparation and shooting=== Nadrealisti thus reconvened in August 1989 without Ričl and Arslangić, but with new protagonists Darko Ostojić, Dado Džihan, and Dražen Janković, as well as Srki Velimirović who kept behind the camera but contributed with sketch ideas and scriptwriting. Their getting together this time was organized and coordinated by Slobodan Terzić, TV Sarajevo executive in charge of culture and arts programming. Noticeably more mature and structured, the 8-member group was now directed by thirty-four-year-old Miroslav \\"Ćiro\\" Mandić who had already accumulated a bit of a cinematic CV behind him, having directed a feature film Život radnika two years earlier and having been one of Emir Kusturica's ADs on the Palme d'Or-winning When Father Was Away on Business in 1985. The written material courtesy of Karajlić and Velimirović became tighter and more polished compared to the 1984 series as sketches now started hinting at deeper social issues and trends. The upgrade in production and organizational matters was noticeable from the start of the second series. Implemented in practice, it meant that rather than having sketch excerpts that revolve around a theme over an entire episode, the show incorporated different sketches of varied structure and the music numbers got reduced. Just like the first series from 1984, the core of the second series also included a parody of television programming cliches with various TV characters — an unnamed news anchor played by Karajlić and his newscast director played by Ðurić as well as a plethora of roving reporters played by all cast members — framing the sketches. Predicting future political and social events, both in Yugoslavia and abroad, became another staple of the second series — with Murphy's law governing these forecasts where the worst outcome is usually the one that ends up occurring. Finally, many, including Karajlić and Nadrealisti executive producer Terzić, talked about the second series sketches being infused with satirical techniques from the works of Radoje Domanović such as Vođa and Kraljević Marko po drugi put među Srbima. The shooting dragged on for months throughout late summer and fall 1989. It was not without issues, including director Mandić essentially quitting early on due to creative differences with the guys before he got persuaded to continue on via intervention by executive producer Terzić who even enlisted Emir Kusturica's help in this regard. Mandić's relationship with the main on-camera performers Nele and Đuro was apparently so fraught initially that Đuro at one point even began lobbying for Mandić to be replaced with Goran Gajić, an old friend of the New Primitivism guys whom Đuro had shot The Fall of Rock and Roll with earlier that year. Mandić came back into the fold soon after quitting as the two sides found a modicum of common ground creatively. ===Airing=== Once it started airing in late fall 1989, the series achieved critical praise though it took several episodes for the general public to catch on. Once that happened, the series exploded all over SFR Yugoslavia with risque sketches that relied on absurdity as the starting point becoming widely quoted classics. Most also provided many thinly-veiled hints and winks in reference to the current political and social situation. A very popular sketch featuring \\"Swedish workers escaping their politically unstable homeland and seeking refuge in Yugoslavia only to find low-skill jobs for local ruthless small-business bosses\\", in addition to providing uproarious laughs through well-crafted dialogues, parodied the decades-long drain of Yugoslav nationals to Western Europe in search of better employment opportunities. Another classic sketch, featuring Rade Pendrek, an exemplary and obedient forty-year-old street cop, having a nightmare about waking up in a country where uniformed intellectuals round up disobedient cops to university halls in order to forcibly correct their misbehaviour by having professors aggressively read Nietzsche and play Mozart to them as worker riot- squads armed with shovels roam the streets outside breaking up police protest rallies, humorously hinted and winked at a wide range of actual events: from the Žuta Greda incident during the Anti-bureaucratic revolution to the party- initiated media and institutional campaigns against dissenting University of Sarajevo professors and lecturers Nenad Kecmanović, Vojislav Šešelj, and Esad Ćimić. On occasion, because of the content's political sensitivity, trickery had to be used by the show's network-assigned executive producer Slobodan Terzić in front of his TV Sarajevo superiors in order to ensure the intended material makes it to air. This was particularly true when the material featured overt mockery of Yugoslav political figures such as the now-famous 14th Yugoslav Communist League Congress dubbing sequence (framed by Nele and Đuro as \\"closing time at the Kod dva bela goluba kafana\\"), which was recorded on a Wednesday night in January 1990 — less than a day before the scheduled airtime for that episode on Thursday in prime time — while the Congress itself had been held days earlier and its political fallout was still huge. Nele and Đuro stayed up all night riffing and dubbing their voices over the politicians' speeches. In the morning Terzić reportedly signed off on the sketch, prepared it for airing later that night, and then went home where he unplugged his home telephone in anticipation of the calls he knew he would be getting from his superiors during airtime. The sketch aired that night, causing a political stir, but it also got a great reaction from the viewers. Seven episodes were shot and aired during the season. An additional New Year's special episode was aired on 31 December 1989. A year later, another New Year's episode was shot and aired. ===1990 Yugoslavia-wide tour=== The highly- rated television series led to a surge of popularity for all things Top lista nadrealista and New Primitivism throughout SFR Yugoslavia. The group decided to cash in immediately by releasing a 3-tape VHS box-set as well as by going on a country-wide arena tour, which had a commercial tie-in with one of Yugoslavia's most prominent tourist operators Unis Tours. The tour featured a unique business arrangement in that Unis Tours purchased it outright for a fixed price before it even started thus acquiring its entire eventual gate revenue, an indication of the popularity of Top lista nadrealista in Yugoslavia at the time and the company's certainty that the tour would generate profit. Booked and organized by Zabranjeno Pušenje manager Dragan \\"Kiki\\" Zurovac, the joint Zabranjeno Pušenje, Bombaj Štampa, and Top lista nadrealista show featuring a live mixture of music and sketch comedy on stage played to sold out sports arenas across the country throughout the first part of 1990. The tour started in Belgrade on January 11 and 12, continuing in Novi Sad on the 14th, followed by Zagreb on the 19th and Split on the 21st, Ljubljana the 29th, and Sarajevo on February 1 and 2, Skopje the 13th, and Priština the 14th. Due to its popularity, many dates were added after the initial ones. However, relationships within the group already deteriorated to the point of guys barely tolerating one another. Main issue was revenue sharing and through it an unspoken recognition of who the main protagonist(s) is/are as stated by Karajlić in his autobiography: ==Third television series (1991)== ==Members== * Nele Karajlić (radio segment, TV seasons 1, 2, and 3) * Zenit Đozić (radio segment, TV seasons 1, 2, and 3) * Branko Đurić (TV seasons 1, 2, and 3) * Boris Šiber (radio segment, TV seasons 1 and 2) * Darko Ostojić (TV season 2 and 3) * Dražen Ričl (radio segment and TV season 1) * Zlatko Arslanagić (radio segment and TV season 1) * Dražen Janković (TV seasons 2 and 3) * Dado Džihan (TV season 2) * Srđan \\"Srki\\" Velimirović (TV seasons 2 and 3) * Davor Dujmović (TV season 3) * Davorin Šegulja (TV season 3) * Elvis J.

On 9 May 1992 against the backdrop of rapidly deteriorating security situation in the city of Sarajevo as well as the rest of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Radio Sarajevo got restructured by merging its channels one, two, and three as well as its channel 202 into a single channel that officially got renamed Radio BiH.Ratni Dežurni mikrofon;MediaCentar.ba, 23 May 1992 Boro Kontić who performed editor-in-chief duties at Radio Sarajevo's channel two since 1990 now continued as one of the more influential executives at Radio BiH. Right away, he decided to bring back Dežurni mikrofon, an hour-long political magazine that for years aired on old Radio Sarajevo's channel one. The new timeslot was Sundays at 9am and its first broadcast in renewed form aired on 24 May 1992. In late June 1992, several months into the Bosnian War with the city already firmly divided between the neighbourhoods and surrounding areas held by the Bosnian Serb Army (VRS) and the central neighbourhoods controlled by the Bosnian Muslim-dominated Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH), Kontić decided to re-assemble the group that made Top lista nadrealista by giving them a 15-minute segment on Dežurni mikrofon. For the very first gathering, he managed to find many of the individuals previously involved with the show or New Primitives who were still in the city at the time: Đuro, Zenit Đozić, Šiber, Srki Velimirović, Elvis J. Kurtović, Zlatko Arslangić, Sejo Sexon, and Saša Petrović, as well as new faces Haris \\"Gigo\\" Aljević, Haris Memija, and Almir \\"Batko\\" Čehajić. Đuro and Zlatko Arslanagić fled Sarajevo soon afterwards so that the remaining protagonists did the 15-minute weekly radio shows in the second part of 1992 and into 1993.Štafeta ratosti;media.ba, 29 May 2012 Made in irregular circumstances in a besieged town with war raging all around, the primary objective of the short weekly segment was boosting citizen morale though very few could even hear it due to electrical power being in scarce supply so that the show would open with lines such as \\"good evening to all three of you who still have generators\\".Sarajevo Journal; This Can't Be Bosnia, There's Too Much Laughing;The New York Times, 6 July 1993 The radio segment ran until July 1993. In August 1993, after 50 odd shows on radio, the group shot and aired four television episodes. One war- time sketch showed Serbs arresting obviously innocent Czech tourists who got lost on their way to seaside as Muslim extremists and terrorists. Other sketch shows how a Bosniak \\"Super Imam\\" heals a child of Chetnik spirit. ===Nadreality Show=== Nadreality Show was made in 2007 as a partial reunion of some of the old crew from Top lista nadrealista. Of the returning protagonists Zenit Đozić, Elvis J. Kurtović, and Darko Ostojić were present, along with a slew of new actors. Radio Televizija Bosne I Hercegovine alongside RTL Televizija and B92 broadcast Nadreality Show in 2007 with few sketches. The main person in the sketches was Zenit Đozić. ===Nadrealna televizija=== In fall of 2012, Nele Karajlić began preparations for a sketch comedy series, marking his return to the format after more than twenty years. On 12 December 2012, the pilot episode of Nadrealna televizija appeared on 1Prva, drawing high viewership rates. Directed by Milorad Milinković, the series got picked up and 10 episodes were shot throughout spring and summer 2013. The episodes aired from 3 September 2013 until 15 November 2013. ===Nadreality Show 2=== During 2017, sketches of Nadreality Show 2 were shot and broadcast on Federalna televizija as the continuation to the original first series of Nadreality Show. ==See also== * New Primitivism * Zabranjeno Pušenje * Comedy in Bosnia and Herzegovina ==References== * ==External links== * * Videos of Skits on Youtube * Sarajevo version of Monty Python's Flying Circus Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina culture Category:Television sketch shows Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina television series Category:1980s Yugoslav television series Category:1990s Yugoslav television series Category:1990s Bosnia and Herzegovina television series Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina satirical television programmes Category:Surreal comedy television series Category:Metafictional television series ","title":"Top lista nadrealista"},{"id":"2562858","text":"Dervish, 1972.

He had several one-man exhibits of his sculptures in Melbourne and Sydney between 1954 and 1962. In 1963 Meadmore moved to New York City. Later, he became an American citizen. Meadmore used COR-TEN steel, aluminum, and occasionally bronze to create colossal outdoor sculptures which combine the elements of abstract expressionism and minimalism.Eric Gibson, The Sculpture of Clement Meadmore, Hudson Hills Press, 1994 He was an avid amateur drummer and jazz lover who held jam sessions in his home. His fondness for jazz is reflected in the names of several of his works including \\"Riff\\" (1996), \\"Round Midnight\\" (1996), \\"Stormy Weather\\" (1997), \\"Night and Day\\" (1979) and \\"Perdido\\" (1978). Meadmore's sculptures are held by museums, corporate headquarters, and schools internationally. His work has been exhibited in a number of galleries, including the Anita Shapolsky Gallery in New York City, the Columbus Gallery of Fine Art in Ohio, and the Davenport Municipal Art Gallery in Iowa. He authored How to Make Furniture Without Tools (Pantheon, 1975) () and The Modern Chair: Classic Designs by Thonet, Breuer, Le Corbusier, Eames and Others (Dover Publications; 1997) ().

It can also carry a variety of Certified Pre-Owned vehicles. It employs automobile salespeople to sell their automotive vehicles. It may also provide maintenance services for cars, and employ automotive technicians to stock and sell spare automobile parts and process warranty claims. ==History of car dealerships in the United States== The early cars were sold by automakers to customers directly or through a variety of channels, including mail order, department stores, and traveling representatives. The first dealership in the United States was established in 1898 by William E. Metzger. Today, direct sales by an automaker to consumers are limited by most states in the U.S. through franchise laws that require new cars to be sold only by licensed and bonded, independently owned dealerships. The first woman car dealer in the United States was Rachel \\"Mommy\\" Krouse who in 1903 opened her business, Krouse Motor Car Company, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Philadelphia.cite The Evening Bulletin (published by Philadelphia Bulletin) December 7, 1953 page 1 (column 3) and page 16 (column 4) and The Evening Bulletin January 29, 1954 (obituary) Car dealerships are usually franchised to sell and service vehicles by specific companies. They are often located on properties offering enough room to have buildings housing a showroom, mechanical service, and body repair facilities, as well as to provide storage for used and new vehicles. Many dealerships are located out of town or on the edge of town centers. An example of a traditional single proprietorship car dealership was Collier Motors in North Carolina. Many modern dealerships are now part of corporate-owned chains such as AutoNation with over 300 franchises. Dealership profits in the US mainly come from servicing, some from used cars, and little from new cars. Most automotive manufacturers have shifted the focus of their franchised retailers to branding and technology. New or refurbished facilities are required to have a standard look for its dealerships and have product experts to liaise with customers. Audi has experimented with a hi-tech showroom that allows customers to configure and experience cars on 1:1 scale digital screens. In markets where it is permitted, Mercedes-Benz opened city centre brand stores. Tesla Motors has rejected the dealership sales model based on the idea that dealerships do not properly explain the advantages of their cars, and they could not rely on third party dealerships to handle their sales. However, in the United States, direct manufacturer auto sales are prohibited in almost every state by franchise laws requiring that new cars be sold only by dealers. In response, Tesla has opened city centre galleries where prospective customers can view cars that can only be ordered online. These stores were inspired by the Apple Stores. Tesla's model was the first of its kind, and has given them unique advantages as a new car company. ===Dispute=== Multiple studies have shown that franchises increase car costs by nearly 10%. Additionally, the issuance of new dealership licenses is subject to geographical restriction; if there is already a dealership for a company in an area, no one else can open one. This has led to dealerships becoming in essence hereditary, with families running dealerships in an area since the original issuance of their license with no fear of competition or any need to prove qualification or consumer benefit (beyond proving they meet minimum legal standards), as franchises in most jurisdictions can only be withdrawn for illegal activity and no other reason. This has led to consumer campaigns for establishment or reform, which have been met by huge lobbying efforts by franchise holders. New companies trying to enter the market, such as Tesla, have been restricted by this model and have either been forced out or been forced to work around the franchise model, facing constant legal pressure. ==Multibrand car dealers== Multibrand and multimaker car dealers sell cars from different and independent carmakers. Some are specialized in electric vehicles. ==Auto transport== Auto transport is used to move vehicles from the factory to the dealerships. This includes international and domestic shipping. It was largely a commercial activity conducted by manufacturers, dealers, and brokers. Internet use has encouraged this niche service to expand and reach the general consumer marketplace. ==See also== * Auto auction * Auto row * Automaker * Car dealerships in the United States * List of auto dealership and repair shop buildings * Showroom * Used car ===Organizations=== * AutoBidsOnline * Carfax * Kelley Blue Book * Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations of India (FADA) * National Automobile Dealers Association * Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * EU car dealership reforms * ","title":"Car dealership"},{"id":"2562885","text":"BGR may refer to: ==Organizations== * BGR Capital & Trade, a US investment bank * BGR Group, the US lobbying firm co-founded by Haley Barbour * Boy Genius Report, a technology weblog * ' (Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources), a Federal Institute of the Federal Republic of Germany ==Places== * Bangor International Airport, a joint civil-military public airport west of the city of Bangor, Penobscot County, Maine, United States by IATA airport code * Bulgaria, by ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code ==Science and technology== * BGR (subpixels), blue, green, red, an RGB display pixel layout * Boy Genius Report, a weblog that specializes in technology and consumer gadgets * Bulletin of Glaciological Research, a peer-reviewed scientific journal == Other uses == * Bob Graham Round, a 24-hour fell-running challenge in the Lake District, England ==See also== * GBR (disambiguation) * RGB (disambiguation) ","title":"BGR"},{"id":"2562887","text":"The Hamilton Princess & Beach Club, A Fairmont Managed Hotel (generally known as The Princess) is one of the grandest and most famous hotels in Bermuda, located in Pembroke Parishhttp://www.fairmont.com/hamilton-bermuda/ just outside the City of Hamilton.

At the time, she lived in Canada with her husband, the Duke of Argyll, who was Governor General there.

Princess Louise had been induced to travel from Canada for health reasons. Many other early travellers to Bermuda were wealthy businessmen and political figures, with their families, drawn partly by the colony's reputation for a healthy climate, especially during the winter months, and also by a pace of life that was a suitable tonic for the stress and hectic pressures they experienced at home. The Bermuda Government's Trade Development Board, quickly grasping the marketing advantages of this reputation, began billing Bermuda as the Isles of Serenity.The Bermudian magazine: The Colour of Tourism: In the advent of Bermuda tourism, the island was strategically promoted as the ideal playground for affluent (white) Americans. Part I. By DUNCAN MCDOWALL The journey to Bermuda, whether by sail or by early steamship, was arduous (Princess fixture Samuel Clemens quipped, Bermuda is Heaven, but you have to go through Hell to get there!), especially as, in the early years of the industry, visitors travelled to the island for the winter months. As Princess Louise had done, most would spend the entire winter there, the period becoming known as the Season. Summers in Bermuda, by comparison, were relatively quiet. ===Bermuda as a Naval Base and Army Garrison=== Bermuda's tourism had arisen without conscious planning, and the hotels previously available to the wealthy visitors who pioneered holidaying on the island were generally small and uninspiring. Bermudian business and political leaders realised that a large, first-rate hotel was required. The development of the hotel hinged on American investment, however. Foreigners were not, then, permitted to buy land or businesses in Bermuda, lest their governments use protecting those interests as a pretext for invasion. Prospect Camp in Bermuda. Bermuda was, at the time, considered by the UK government more as a naval and military base than as a colony (it housed the chief Royal Navy base in the western North Atlantic, and the attendant large military garrison to guard it). The military personnel made up a quarter of the population, and defence spending, not agriculture or tourism, was the central leg of the Bermudian economy. Many wealthy American visitors actually brought their daughters to holiday on the island specifically in hopes of marrying them to young aristocratic military or naval officers (this put them in competition with local women, but the Princess sponsored dances and other social gatherings to which the officers of the garrison were invited to mingle with guests). The UK Government had been imploring the Bermuda Government for decades to raise its own part-time military units to allow the withdrawal of some of the regular army detachments. This was due to the immense costs of the garrisons in Bermuda and elsewhere, at a time when the Army was attempting to re-organise itself to be more effective. As the Army's budget was not being increased, this could only be achieved by redisposition of existing units. The Bermudian Government had long ignored these pleas, but needed the approval of the UK Government to allow US investment in the Princess, as well as to widen the channel into St. George's (necessary to allow that port to continue to thrive in an age where ships had grown too large to safely use the existing channel, but which it was argued would make an invader's task easier). The Secretary of State for War insisted he could not approve either project while Bermuda contributed nothing to her own defence. Ultimately, the Bermuda Government would not honour its end of the agreement until a decade after the Princess Hotel was opened. Two 1892 Acts of the Bermudian Parliament authorised the creation in 1894 and 1895 of the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps and the Bermuda Militia Artillery.Jennifer M. Ingham (now Jennifer M. Hind), Defence, Not Defiance: A History Of The Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps, . Printed by The Island Press Ltd., Pembroke, Bermuda. ===Development and marketing of The Princess=== Harley Trott, a leading businessman at the time and head of Trott & Cox, the steamship agents and purveyors of meat for the British military, was determined to build a hotel that would attract affluent Americans, who would summer in the Berkshires and winter in Bermuda. From the moment it opened, The Princess was considered the gem of the island. With long shady verandas and a blue slate roof, the four-story building comprised 70 rooms, each equipped with gas lights, hot and cold running water and a five-inch mirror to allow guests to primp before stepping out for the night. Staff dressed in white jackets and waving pink handkerchiefs greeted luxury liners. As word got out, celebrities started to appear. Mark Twain, a regular at the hotel, loved to smoke cigars on the veranda and wartime guest Ian Fleming is said to have used its fish tank-lined Gazebo Bar as a motif in his novel, Dr. No. ===British Government use in the Second World War=== In 1939, when the world went to war, The Fairmont Hamilton Princess was under British Censorship and home to Allied servicemen. The basement became an intelligence center and way station where all mail, radio and telegraphic traffic bound for Europe, the U.S. and the Far East were intercepted and analyzed by 1,200 censors, of British Imperial Censorship, part of British Security Coordination (BSC), before being routed to their destination. Rumor has it that it was nicknamed 'Bletchley-in-the- Tropics' after the English country house where the Enigma code was broken (Sir William Stephenson, the Canadian-born British spymaster who was the subject of the book and film A Man Called Intrepid resided for a time at the Princess, following the war, before buying a home on the island, and was often visited there by his former subordinate, James Bond novelist Ian Fleming).Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Hotel History of the Fairmont Hamilton Princess.Bernews: Bermuda's WWII Espionage Role. 11 November 2011 \\"A thousand people worked in the basement, checking to see if letters contained messages in invisible ink or if an extra period, when magnified, might reveal a hidden message,\\" according to former hotel manager Ian Powell. With BSC working closely with the FBI, the censors were responsible for the discovery and arrest of a number of Axis spies operating in the US, including the Joe K ring. The censor working on the Joe K correspondence was Nadya Gardner who conducted chemical tests and found secret writing in some letters, according to historian H. Montgomery Hyde. ===Post-War development=== The years that followed the war brought great changes to Bermuda's visitor industry, and to The Princess Hotel. Prior to the war, visitors arrived almost exclusively by sea. Although air service to Bermuda began in 1937, two years before the declaration of war, the flying boats that operated to Darrell's Island were few, and their seats were limited. Tickets for the hours-long flights from the US were expensive, and ocean liners continued to play a major role in passenger transport to and from Bermuda. Holidaying in Bermuda (catering to which, for hoteliers, had expanded into a year-round business, no longer focused on the original Winter season) remained a prerogative of the wealthy. The war had resulted in the development of two American airstations on Bermuda, the Naval Operating Base, serving US Navy flying boats, and the US Army's Kindley Field, as well as the establishment of a US Army garrison of artillery and infantry defences to re- inforce the British Army's Bermuda Garrison. Bermuda's use as a forming-up point for trans-Atlantic convoys meant that numerous ships carrying American soldiers to the North African and European theatres of war, as well as US Naval vessels deploying to those theatres or escorting convoys, also brought vast numbers of Americans from all levels of society to Bermuda during the war. This both exposed Bermuda to America's working and middle classes, and exposed those classes to Bermudians. Following the war, the air transport industry went through rapid development, with piston, turboprop, and then jet engined landplane airliners of increasing size and speed serving Bermuda from ever more North American cities, flying into the US Army's new airfield (flying boat air service to Darrell's Island ceased in 1948). This led to larger numbers of air arrivals, and falling ticket prices, opening Bermuda to short-term holidays by the average American family. These new visitors were less interested in attending balls, hunting aristocratic husbands, or Bermuda's other traditional genteel and wintry leisure activities. New hotels had sprung up in Bermuda even before the war, such as the Castle Harbour Hotel and the Elbow Beach Hotel, which offered visitors direct access to the beach in more natural surroundings, and better catered to sun-seekers and hedonists. More beach resorts were built after the war, including the Carlton Beach resort, the Grotto Bay Hotel, and the Princess' own sister hotel, the Southampton Princess (currently dubbed the Fairmont Southampton), built in 1972 on a 100-acre parcel near to the most popular public beaches, with its own private beach club and gold course. Cottage colonies, such as the Cambridge Beaches, also became a popular alternative to traditional hotels, with visitors renting discrete cottages on a resort property, usually with its own private beach, and served by a common building with guest services and a restaurant or dining room. The Princess was able to cater to a degree to these new holidaymakers with a cottage colony of its own on the headland at the Pitt's Bay side of the hotel, which had formerly been the site of the Bermuda Coal Company's wharf. The hotel was rebilled as The Princess Hotel and The Cottage Colony. Its location simply did not allow it to compete directly with the new beach resorts. Although tourism visitors have remained an important part of its clientele, with Bermuda's post-war development as a financial centre (it has long been the global centre of the Reinsurance industry, and international business, not tourism, has been its primary source of revenue for decades), the hotel has taken full advantage of its proximity to the City of Hamilton, and its modern, business-friendly features (from internet connectivity in guest rooms to facilities suitable for business conferences), to cater to the numerous business travellers who have little time for sunbathing or golf (its only competitors for this business would have been the Hamilton Hotel,Dr Edward Harris (20 August 2011). \\"HERITAGE MATTERS: Incinerating Bermuda's tourism assets\\". The Royal Gazette. which burnt down in 1955 and was replaced by the Hamilton City Hall, and the Bermudiana Hotel, which also was destroyed by fire in 1958.Jessie Moniz (17 May 2012). \\"The day the old Bermudiana died\\". The Royal Gazette. Although replaced by a new Bermudiana Hotel, the long decline of Bermuda's visitor industry led to its closure (it was sold in 1993 and levelled, the site being redeveloped as office space, including the ACE and XL buildings). In 1959, American tanker billionaire Daniel K. Ludwig purchased the hotel. As part of the deal to build a new luxury hotel - The Southampton Princess - The Princess was renovated: the cottage colony was levelled and a new Pitt's Bay wing built and lounges added. Affluent neighbours of the hotel objected to the original plans to match the height of the existing structure, and approval was granted only for the resulting three-storey wing. Ludwig made The Princess hotel (after 1972 often referred to as the Hamilton Princess to distinguish it from the Southampton Princess) the flagship of a global chain, Princess International Hotels. The Princess Hotels Group passed to Tiny Rowland's British conglomerate, Lonrho Plc (originally the London and Rhodesian Mining and Land Company Limited), between 1979 and 1981 for US $200 million.Forbes magazine: Inside Lonrho today. 21 March 1988 Both Bermudian hotels were sold as part of a seven-property deal by the Lonrho Plc subsidiary, Lonmin plc, which transferred the Princess Hotels Group on 11 June 1998 to the Canadian Pacific Railway for a combined price of GBP 331.75 million. This was part of the final expansion of Canadian Pacific Hotels, which also included the 1999 purchase of the San Francisco-based Fairmont Hotel chain. The seven hotels of the Princess Hotels Group at first continued as a wholly owned subsidiary of CPH, but were later merged into the Fairmont Hotels and Resorts group, as Canadian Pacific Hotels and Resorts was renamed in 2001. ===Recent Developments=== On 11 May 2006, an agreement for the acquisition of Fairmont Hotels and Resorts by Kingdom Hotels International and Colony Capital LLC for US $4.5 billion was announced.\\"Fairmont Announces Agreement to Be Acquired by Kingdom Hotels and Colony Capital\\" . Colony Capital (Colony Inc) 30 January 2006 The Fairmont Hotels and Resorts group was combined with two other subsidiaries, Raffles Hotels & Resorts and Swissôtel Hotels and Resorts, to form Fairmont Raffles Hotels International, with 120 hotels in 24 countries. In 2007 the Princess Hotel was sold to Global Hospitality Investments (GHI), and then in 2012 sold to local company BERCO owned by the Bermudian Green family, which continues to operate the hotel as part of the Fairmont chain. The Princess is the oldest hotel in the chain.Ceola Wilson (28 September 2012). \\"Green family buy Hamilton Princess\\". The Royal Gazette.

As one of the first public martial arts institutes in China, Jing Wu was intended to create a structured environment for teaching and learning martial arts as opposed to the secretive training that had been common in the past. The founders of Jing Wu felt that the association would keep alive traditions that secrecy and social change would otherwise doom. The basic curriculum drew from several styles of martial arts, giving practitioners a well-rounded martial background in addition to whatever they wished to specialise in. Jing Wu inspired the ecumenism seen in the Chinese martial arts community during the Republican era, giving rise to such efforts as the National Martial Arts Institutes. Sun Yat-sen, founder of the Republic of China, attended the third annual event held by Jing Wu in 1915, giving a speech of encouragement to the attendees. When Sun Yat-sen attended again at the 10th annual event in 1920, he also wrote for a special Jing Wu newsletter and made a plaque with the engraving \\"martial spirit\\". During the period of the Japanese sphere of influence, the Twenty-One Demands sent to the government of the Republic of China resulted in two treaties with Japan on 25 May 1915. This prevented the ruling class from exercising full control over the commoners. With their new freedom, Huo's students purchased a new building to serve as the organisation's headquarters and named it \\"Jing Wu Athletic Association\\". The association accepted new styles of martial arts other than those taught by Huo. In 1918, Jing Wu Athletic Association opened a branch at Nathan Road in Hong Kong. In July 1919, Jing Wu Athletic Association sent five representatives to Southeast Asia to expand their activities overseas. The five were Chen Gongzhe, Li Huisheng, Luo Xiaoao, Chen Shizhao and Ye Shutian. They made their first stop in Saigon, Vietnam, where they opened the first Chin Woo school outside of China. They opened schools in Malaysia and Singapore later as well. By 1923, these five masters had opened schools all over Southeast Asia and visited nine different countries. ==Present== In 1966, Shanghai's Jing Wu school was forced to discontinue its activities by the Chinese Communist Party due to the Cultural Revolution, whose goals were to destroy old ideas, cultures and customs for the purpose of modernizing China. Those restrictions were lifted in 1976, after which Shanghai's Chin Woo school resumed its activities.上海精武体育総会 Chin Woo is currently one of the largest wushu organisations in the world with branches in various countries, including Japan, Hong Kong, Macau, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Poland, Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and Switzerland. The United States headquarters of Chin Woo is located at 719 Gate City Blvd, Greensboro North Carolina 27403. ==Curriculum== During the early days of Jing Wu in Shanghai, the chief instructor, Zhao Lianhe, developed a curriculum that became the standard Jing Wu sets (Fundamental Routines). * Shi Er Lu Tan Tui (十二路潭腿; Twelve Roads of Spring Leg) * Gong Li Quan (功力拳; Power Fist) * Jie Quan (节拳; Connecting Fist) * Da Zhan Quan (大战拳; Big Battle Fist) * Qun Yang Gun (群羊棍; Shepherd Staff) * Ba Gua Dao (八卦刀; Eight Trigrams Broadsword) * Wu Hu Qiang (五虎枪; Five Tiger Spear) * Jie Tan Tui (接潭腿; Tan Tui Sparring) * Tao Quan (套拳; Set Fist) * Dan Dao Chuan Qiang (单刀串枪; Broadsword versus Spear) Other styles were taught to students as well, but they varied from school to school and depended on the background of the master teaching that style. The standard curriculum, however, was taught in all Jing Wu schools. ==Jing Wu in popular culture== Fearless the movie. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * Yandle, Robert (2010) 'Jingwu Athletic Association - 100 Years'.

Brook\\" on a film, a clerk wrote \\"Seabrook\\". Original production was in Allerton, but in 1979-80 a larger factory opened in the Princeville area of Bradford; production continued at the Allerton factory until 2004. Seabrook's crisps are distributed widely in the north of England, and increasingly in the south, and are also sold through mail order. Most of the potatoes used by the company are grown within 50 miles of the Bradford headquarters, Seabrook House. The crisps, sold in a variety of pack sizes, are salted with sea salt and are produced in a range of new and traditional flavours. The brand is best known for its bold flavours – Seabrook Crisps typically have a much stronger flavour delivery than its competitors. In 2017, Seabrook Crisps employed about 150 people, and was 75% owned by LDC (Lloyds Development Capital) and 25% by the management team: Jonathan Bye (CEO), Daniel Woodwards (COO), Jon Wood (commercial director) and Paul Monk (chairman).

She studied piano for seven years, first at the home, where her instructor was veteran Metropolitan Opera bassoonist Louis Pietrini, who had volunteered to teach the children a variety of instruments — initially teaching them solfège, which Troyanos later called \\"the basis of my musical education\\"Matheopoulos, Helena. Diva: Great Sopranos and Mezzos Discuss Their Art. Boston: Northeastern University Press, 1991, p. 292. — and her studies continued, on scholarship, at the Brooklyn Music School.

She was employed as a secretary to the director of publicity at Random House, and performed in choruses, ranging from church choirs (with a scholarship at the First Presbyterian Church) to musical theater; \\"Tatiana Troyanos, almost hidden in the chorus, came soaring through with a pellucid and magnificent quality of tone as the Arab Singing Girl,\\" proclaimed the Boston Globe's Kevin Kelly in a review of a summer stock production of Fanny in September 1958.Kelly, Kevin. \\"Fish Nets and Mussels: 'Fanny' at Carousel\\", Boston Globe, September 2, 1958.

Her exact tenure in the show has been variously reported, but a Playbill for the Mark Hellinger Theater dated January 7, 1963 shows her still in the cast at that time. Troyanos was engaged by the New York City Opera and made her professional operatic debut in April 1963, on the first night of the spring season, as Hippolyta in the New York premiere production of Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream. She sang Jocasta in Stravinsky's Oedipus rex that season, Marina in the company's first production of Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov the following year, and various other roles through 1965.Sokol, Martin L.

Offered a Metropolitan Opera contract with limited stage opportunities, but choosing a path also taken by other American singers at the time, she left in the summer of 1965 in quest of more intensive performing experience in Europe, where, having auditioned successfully for three companies, she was to make the Hamburg State Opera, led by the nurturing Rolf Liebermann, her home base for the next decade, first as a member of its renowned ensemble and later as a guest artist. \\"It made sense to go to Germany,\\" she recalled. \\"I found an intendant [Liebermann] ... who encouraged me and who knew how to further my career slowly. That was really what I wanted. I wanted to be in the theater every day, learning roles slowly, not quickly, and certainly not under any kind of pressure.

Her first parts there included Lola in Cavalleria rusticana and Preziosilla in the premiere of a new production of La forza del destino, and by year's end she was singing Carmen, a key role she would later bring to Geneva, London, and the Metropolitan Opera spring tour. Eventually at Hamburg she would sing, in her words, \\"just about every mezzo role around.\\" But it was the Aix-en- Provence Festival in 1966 (for which Liebermann himself had recommended her) that saw her breakthrough performance in Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos (to the Ariadne of Régine Crespin). In her role debut as the Composer, wrote Elizabeth Forbes, \\"she made a heart-breaking—and heart-broken—adolescent, whose voice, in Strauss's great paean to the power of music, soared into the warm, Provencal night and seemed to hang there like the stars of a rocket.\\"Forbes, Elizabeth. \\"Obituary: Tatiana Troyanos\\". The Independent, August 26, 1993; accessed November 23, 2012. That performance, followed by her first Octavian in Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier at London's Covent Garden in 1968 (to the Marschallin of Lisa Della Casa), effectively initiated her international career—although, said Liebermann, \\"she returned to Hamburg unspoiled\\" after her triumph at Aix and \\"'took up her modest engagements as if nothing had happened.'\\"Soria, Dorle J. \\"Musician of the Month: Tatiana Troyanos\\", High Fidelity & Musical America, vol. 27, no. 6, June 1977, p.

Her appearance as Handel's Ariodante opposite Beverly Sills in the opening week of the Kennedy Center in 1971 (under the baton of Julius Rudel, who had originally brought her to the New York City Opera) served to reintroduce her to American opera audiences. There followed debuts at the Lyric Opera of Chicago (as Charlotte in Massenet's Werther, 1971), Dallas Opera (Dido in Purcell's Dido and Aeneas, 1972), Opera Company of Boston (Romeo in Bellini's I Capuleti e i Montecchi, 1975), and notably at San Francisco Opera (Poppea in Monteverdi's L'incoronazione di Poppea, 1975—about which Chronicle reviewer Robert Commanday wrote, \\"The means by which Poppea seduces Nero ... could liquefy even stone the way the sensational new mezzo soprano Tatiana Troyanos sang\\").Quoted in Robert Wilder Blue, \\"Remembering Tatiana Troyanos\\", page 2; accessed September 22, 2012. ===The Metropolitan Opera years=== Troyanos returned to New York to make her Metropolitan Opera debut as Octavian, closely followed by the Composer, in the spring of 1976. \\"The star of the show was Miss Troyanos ... the most aristocratic Octavian at the Met in years,\\" wrote Speight Jenkins in a review of the Rosenkavalier in the New York Post. \\"She has a large, warming lyric mezzo-soprano with perfect control ... her singing of the Trio and the final duet was perfection itself.\\"Jenkins, Speight. \\"The Golden Sound of Opera\\". New York Post, March 1976, posted at Metropolitan Opera archives, accessed August 24, 2012. Octavian (her most frequently sung role at the Met, with thirty performances through 1986) and the Composer were often described as her signature or calling-card roles. She also became closely identified, on stage and screen, with another trouser role, Sesto in Mozart's La clemenza di Tito, and Martin Mayer wrote in Opera magazine that she \\"gave the work a dramatic punch few of us had known was there.\\"Mayer, Martin, and Alan Blyth. \\"Tatiana Troyanos, 1938-1993\\".

In her La Scala debut in 1977, she sang in Norma opposite Montserrat Caballé in the first opera performance to be televised live throughout the world. ===Opera and concert repertoire=== Troyanos was known for her impassioned portrayals of everything from trouser roles to femmes fatales; \\"the most boyish rose-bearer was also the most womanly Charlotte,\\" wrote George Birnbaum in the Classical CD Scout.Birnbaum, George. \\"Auger, Popp and Troyanos.\\" Classical CD Scout, vol. 2, issue 3, May 1994. \\"I'm lucky that I look like the roles I do, whether it's Octavian or Carmen or Kundry or Giulietta ... It's a flexible look and I'm a flexible actress. I must get ahold of a role or die\\", Troyanos once said. Asked which mezzo type she'd rather play, \\"somebody's mother or some guy\\", Troyanos once quipped: \\"I prefer the guys — but maybe a guy who also wears a beautiful dress from time to time.\\"McLellan, Joseph. \\"Tatiana Troyanos: Awakening the Arias\\".

Eight more Met performances, plus a joint concert with Plácido Domingo, were televised, as were Norma (opposite Joan Sutherland) at Canadian Opera Company, and the last production in which she appeared, Capriccio at San Francisco Opera.

In 1984 she sang with the Philadelphia Orchestra in the world premiere, in English, of Act I of Rachmaninoff's opera Monna Vanna, which had been left in piano score by the composer and orchestrated by Igor Buketoff.

Concert telecasts with Troyanos included Schoenberg's Gurre-Lieder with the Boston Symphony in 1979 and a recital with pianist Martin Katz, featuring Ravel's Shéhérazade, Falla's Siete canciones populares españolas and songs by Berlioz and Mahler, at the Casals Festival in 1985. ==Audio and video discography== Troyanos enjoyed an equally versatile career as a recording artist; her first appearance as a soloist in a recording hall was as Dorabella, opposite Leontyne Price's Fiordiligi, in Mozart's Così fan tutte under Erich Leinsdorf (recorded in London in 1967, released in 1968, and winner of the Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording in 1969). She went on to sing Cherubino in Karl Böhm's recording of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro, the title role in Bizet's Carmen for Sir Georg Solti (she was described in the Penguin classical record guide as \\"quite simply the subtlest Carmen on record ...

Established in 1998, it is among the larger additions to the New York state park system in the last 50 years. ==History== Sterling Forest was originally part of a vast tract of land called Cheesecock that a group of English colonists bought from the Iroquois Indians in 1702. The land eventually came to belong to the Sterling Iron Works, which mined and shipped iron ore from a number of sites within the park. The last of the mines was closed in the 1920s. The park was established in 1998 after New York State paid $55 million for of land using a combination of public and private funds. The Trust for Public Land and the Open Space Institute (OSI) lead the negotiations for the initial purchase leading to the creation of the park. The initiative to achieve this goal was led by the Public-Private Partnership to Save Sterling Forest, consisting of New York and New Jersey conservation organizations and chaired by Robert O. Binnewies, Executive Director of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission.Palisades, 100,000 Acres in 100 Years, Fordham University Press. In November 1999, The Trust for Public Land and the Open Space Institute purchased 659 acres from New York University. In December 2000, The Trust for Public Land and the Open Space Institute announced an additional 1,065 acres to be added to Sterling Forest State Park. Funders and supporters for Preservation of Sterling Forest State Park include: The Wallace Fund, New York State's Environmental Protection Fund, Forest Legacy Program, the State of New Jersey, the Lila Acheson and DeWitt Wallace Fund for the Hudson Highlands, and Palisades Interstate Park Commission (PIPC), Governor Pataki, The Clinton Administration and other federal support. In 2005, The Trust for Public Land and the State of New York Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation purchased a 90-acre farm land in Warwick, NY to add to the state park. In 2006, the park was expanded after a tract in the center of the forest came on the market, called Sterling Forge. Although Sterling Forest LLC developers had planned to construct 107 luxury homes and an 18-hole golf course on the tract, local residents and concerned environmentalists rallied and were able to procure the tract for the state park. The final $13.5 million sale price was negotiated by The Trust for Public Land, and paid in part out of the state's Environmental Protection Fund. ==Park description and facilities== The park's forest habitat is important for the survival of several species, including timber rattlesnakes, black bear, fox, various raptors and songbirds, and many rare invertebrates and plants. The forest is embedded in a larger area of over of largely uninterrupted woodland that serves both as a wildlife corridor and as a watershed for nearby urban areas. The park contains a number of lakes and reservoirs including Sterling Lake and Blue Lake. Hunting, fishing, ice fishing, hiking and snowshoeing opportunities are available. The park lies in the New York - New Jersey Highlands, a stretch of natural habitat from the Hudson to the Delaware River that links the Abram S. Hewitt State Forest in New Jersey with Harriman State Park in New York. The park conserves a part of the Northeastern coastal forests ecoregion. It also protects the Appalachian Trail corridor, which crosses the northern portion of Sterling Forest. The park is administered by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission. The Appalachian Trail in Sterling Forest is maintained by the New York - New Jersey Trail Conference. The park includes the Frank R. Lautenberg Visitor Center, which offers exhibits about the local environment and overlooks Sterling Lake. The Sterling Mountain Fire Observation Tower and Observer's Cabin is located on Sterling Mountain. A New York State hunting license and a Sterling Forest State Park hunting permit are required to hunt in the park, which is only permitted during deer and turkey season. Some areas are closed to hunting. ==See also== * List of New York state parks ==References== * Palisades, 100,000 Acres in 100 Years, Fordham University Press, Robert O.

Its colors are varied and range from greenish, to yellowish, to reddish, grayish through white with a pearly glow. The body consists of 60 to 150 identical segments separated from each other by a thin white line and protected by cuticles. Each segment has a pair of parapodia, a structure for locomotion, clusters of stinging white bristles, and red or orange gills all in bilateral position. The anterior part of the worm can be recognized by small growths, called caruncle, which have the same color of the gills on the first four segments. The mouth is ventral and is located on the second segment. The head is shown on the first segment and includes the eyes and other sensory organs. ==Distribution and habitat== The bearded fireworm lives throughout the tropical coastal waters of the Atlantic Ocean. On the eastern side they are found from Algeria to Liberia, and on the western side from the southeast coast of the United States of America to Guyana, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. They are also found in the Mediterranean Sea especially around the Italian coasts.DIDIERLAURENT Sylvie, DESVIGNES Thomas, in : DORIS, 7/12/2014 : Hermodice carunculata (Pallas, 1766), http://doris.ffessm.fr/fiche2.asp?fiche_numero=882 This fireworm is found in many marine living environments such as corals, rocks, mud, sand, posidonia, and on drifting wood as well as port infrastructure in shallow water from the surface to 40 meters deep. ==Biology== The bearded fireworm is a voracious predator that supplements its diet with plant material. The bearded fireworm is a slow creature, and is not considered a threat to humans unless touched by careless swimmers. The bristles, when flared, can penetrate human skin, injecting a powerful neurotoxin and producing intense irritation and a painful burning sensation around the area of contact. The sting can also lead to nausea and dizziness. This sensation lasts up to a few hours, but a painful tingling can continue to be felt around the area of contact. In a case of accidental contact, application and removal of adhesive tape will help remove the spines; applying isopropanol to the area may help alleviate the pain.

The boss rides in the cart, leisurely sitting atop all their paraphernalia, while Charlie is hitched to the cart like a mule. The boss also treats Charlie like a mule, beating him with a stick to get him to move faster. When the boss opts to take a shortcut up a steep hill, the out-of-control cart descends and is nearly hit by an oncoming streetcar. A second attempt to scale the enormous hill is successful. At the house they are to paper, Charlie becomes distracted by the pretty maid. The boss has a misadventure and falls, his head ending up in a bucket of paste. Meanwhile, the short-tempered homeowner is contending with the threat of an exploding stove and an amorous French visitor who is making passes at his wife. Shots are fired—and the target turns out to be Charlie who has been enjoying the maid's company. An enraged Charlie gives the Frenchman, his boss, and the homeowner each a face full of paste. As the fight moves into the kitchen, the troublesome stove finally explodes. When the dust dies down, Charlie is nowhere to be seen. Slowly the oven door opens.

A lifelong professional soldier, Ruthven earned his reputation in the service of the King of Sweden, which he entered about 1609 and left 1637. He had been forced into exile to retain his family name which had been outlawed in Scotland by act of Parliament in 1600.Murdoch and Grosjean, pp.17, 27 As a negotiator he was very useful to Gustavus Adolphus because of his ability to \\"drink immeasurably and preserve his understanding to the last\\", and he also won fame on the field of battle. By 1621 Ruthven served as colonel for the Småland infantry regiment with which he campaigned in Livonia (Latvia). He took as his second in command Alexander Leslie, later promoted field marshal and one of Ruthven's opponents in the English Civil War. Ruthven was one of four Scottish colonels to be knighted by Gustav II Adolf of Sweden in 1627, the others being Alexander Leslie, David Drummond and John Hepburn.Murdoch and Grosjean, pp.36–39. His service in the Thirty Years' War was impressive. He became governor of Ulm in 1632 and as promoted to major- general the same year. The following year Ruthven campaigned along the Danube where he captured a number of Bavarian Horse outside Erbach which earned him his promotion to lieutenant general.Murdoch and Grosjean, pp.60, 63–70. He thereafter campaigned as second in command to the Swedish field marshal, Johan Banér, campaigning along the Rhine throughout 1634 and 1635. He was given a large share of the credit for the routing of the Saxon general, Wolfgang Baudissin at Dömitz, where some 2500 of the prisoners he took were pressed into the Swedish army. However, all was not well between Ruthven and Banér. The latter accused him of negligence at Halle in 1636. Rutheven thereafter returned to Scotland on a recruiting trip, but having made up his mind to quit Swedish service.Murdoch and Grosjean, p.76. Although Ruthven remained on the Swedish pay-roll for another year he travelled home via France where he claimed he was offered a field-marshal's baton by Louis XIII. Although he never served in this capacity, the rank appears on his English certificate of elevation to the nobility. == Service to the king of Great Britain == With the outbreak of the Bishops' Wars in Scotland in 1639, Ruthven offered his services to Charles I. He brought with him his two nephews, Major General John Ruthven and Colonel Frances Ruthven, both veterans of Swedish service. These joined a cohort of other Royalist Scots, including former colleague, Lieutenant General James King.Murdoch and Grosjean, p.97. During the 1639 campaign, he declined command of the Royalists in Scotland as he was not to be granted 'absolute authority' over them, instead being expected to defer to the nobility.Murdoch and Grosjean, pp.97–99. His decision was wise and Edinburgh Castle soon easily fell to his former understudy, Alexander Leslie. After the Truce of Berwick was agreed, Ruthven was allowed to garrison the castle for the king and he defended it throughout in 1640, becoming desperately ill after his provisions ran out. He and his English troops were allowed to leave the castle by negotiationMurdoch and Grosjean, pp.102, 113–114, 116–117. For his services he was raised to the Peerage of Scotland as Lord Ruthven of Ettrick in 1639 during the Bishops War and later created Earl of Forth in 1642. When the English Civil War broke out that year, Ruthven joined Charles at Shrewsbury with some 29 other Scottish veteran officers and after the intervention with the king of Henrietta Maria. Ruthven commanded the Royalist forces at the Battle of Edgehill after the nominated commander, Robert Bertie, Earl of Lindsey, stepped down in a dispute over whether to arrange the army after the Dutch or the Swedish style. In the end the Swedish brigade system was chosen and Ruthven assumed command.Murdoch and Grosjean, pp.120–123. Following the battle, Ruthven was appointed general-in-chief of the Royalist army. The Earl compelled the Earl of Essex to surrender Lostwithiel, and was wounded at both the first and second battles of Newbury. While some claim Ruthven's faculties had begun to decay, Ruthven had lost favour of his military inferior, Prince Rupert whose arrogance he detested. They fell out on route to face down the Army of the Solemn league and Covenant commanded by his friend Alexander Leslie. Believing Rupert inept, Ruthven returned to Oxford leaving Rupert in command. The prince lost the battle to Alexander Leslie and his English parliamentary allies on 2 July 1644.Grosjean and Murdoch, pp.125, 126–134, 137. Ruthven thereafter served as Chamberlain to the Prince of Wales having finally given up field service. Ruthven still maintained correspondence with Axel Oxenstierna, the regent and chancellor of Sweden. He visited Sweden on a mission for Charles II to raise military support for the planned Montrosian expedition to Scotland. using the social capital he had built up in Sweden over the years, Ruthven entered into negotiations with Queen Christina and managed to raise an officer cadre, money and guns for delivery to Royalists in Scotland and Ireland. These were squandered as Charles II withdrew his support for the Montrosians, effectively offering him up as a sacrificial lamb to the Covenanters in Scotland in return for their support. Dejected, Ruthven and King turned their back on the Royalist cause.Grosjean, An Unofficial Alliance, pp.216–227. Although it is often claimed that Ruthven died at Dundee on 2 February 1651 near the house of his relative, Colonel Patrick More, in fact he died at Buxtehude just outside Hamburg. He had been on a journey which took him from Kalmar to Copenhagen and Bremen with Sir William Swann and 2 companions. In Buxtehude, Swann and More took Ruthven's body to a nearby monastery after which it was returned to Scotland for burial.Swedish Riksarkiv, de la Gardiesamlingen, E1501, Patrick More to Magnus de la Gardie, Buxtehude, 26 February 1652 quoted in Steve Murdoch and Kathrin Zickermann, Major General Patrick Moore of Buxtehude: A Scottish Officer in‘ Swedish Bremen’ in Friends of Perth Council Archives, Newsletter, no. 21, pp.8–10 Apparently, he was entombed near Dundee at Monifieth Parish Church in the Durham of Grange family's burying-aisle. This family were noted Royalists who also helped the Marquis of Montrose on his way to Sweden. The church was razed and rebuilt in 1812. It is unknown what became of Ruthven's grave, though a plaque commemorating him is found in the present day church.J. Malcolm, The Parish of Monifieth in Ancient and Modern Times (Edinburgh, 1910), pp.67–68, 149–151 == Family == Ruthven was married to Jane Henderson and to Clara Berner. He had at least two sons: Alexander served as an officer in the Swedish army but he died before his father.Murdoch and Grosjean, p.251 n.100 Patrick Ruthven's daughter, Jane corresponded with the English Parliament from Stockholm in 1652.National Records of Scotland, GD 246/box 26/bundle 5/19. Letters and Papers of Lt. General Sir Patrick Ruthven. Lady Jane Ruthven, Stockholm, 15 January 1652 She became involved in inheritance disputes with Patrick's third wife, Clara Berner, who did not die until 1679. Ruthven made his will on 9 May 1649 and in it left all his Swedish lands to his son Alexander's widow, Anna Erasma Klencke and Patrick's son by the same marriage (Jane Henderson), who was also called Patrick. These lands were Brevik (Jönköping Län). To his surviving wife, Clara Berner and their son Patrick, he donated Ljungbyholm in Kalmar Län (Sweden) and Sackendorf (Mecklenburg). His other goods in Scotland he left to Clara Berner. Clara and his daughter-in-law Anna Klence fought protracted disputes over the Småland lands, even until 1669 and these involved royal intervention. The executors to his will were General James King (taking care of the Swedish side) and Jakob Pringle of Huitbank (of the Scottish side). == Other Information == Ruthven was, according to contemporary sources consistent with severe alcoholic and was called at times \\" Rothwein \\" ( red wine ) . Already at the time of his resignation as commander in chief in 1644 he is said to have shown clear signs of chronic alcohol damage and there must have been a contributing factor to that, he was replaced by Prince Rupert of the Rhine. ==References== * * * Ruthven Correspondence: Letters and Papers of Patrick Ruthven, Earl of Forth and Brentford, and of His Family: A.

Halligan, the wife of Rear Admiral John Halligan, Jr., Commander, Aircraft, Battle Force; and commissioned on 15 January 1935, Commander Robert E.

The new destroyer then transited the Panama Canal on 6 May and steamed north to Washington, D.C., where on 17 May she embarked Rear Admiral Joseph K. Taussig, Assistant Chief of Naval Operations, along with a congressional party, for a cruise down the Potomac River to Mount Vernon. Worden subsequently returned to the Washington Navy Yard where her guns were disassembled for alterations. She then shifted south on 21 May to the Norfolk Navy Yard. In the ensuing weeks, the ship underwent voyage repairs at Norfolk. The yard work was broken once by trials and tests off Rockland, Maine, and completed in the early summer. She ultimately left the Norfolk Navy Yard on 1 July and spent the weekend of the 4th at New Bedford, Massachusetts, before setting her course for the west coast. After proceeding via Guantanamo Bay and the Panama Canal, she arrived back at the Puget Sound Navy Yard on 3 August. After a post-shakedown refit at her builders' yard, Worden shifted south to San Diego, reaching that port on 19 September, and commenced four years of operations from there as a unit of Destroyer Squadrons, Scouting Force. She performed valuable duty as a training ship for the Fleet Sound School, San Diego, and conducted the usual tactics and type training evolutions in local waters and in maneuvers that took her from Seward, Alaska, to Callao, Peru. She also participated in regularly scheduled fleet problems and battle tactics with combined forces of the United States Fleet in the Caribbean Sea and in the Hawaiian Islands. One of the highlights of her operations during that time came in the autumn of 1937. In mid-September— Worden, in company with Hull (DD-350) and escorting the aircraft carrier Ranger (CV-4)—voyaged to Callao, Peru, for a visit that coincided with the Inter-American Technical Aviation Conference at Lima. While Ranger proceeded independently homeward upon conclusion of her visit, the destroyers paused at Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, before returning to San Diego. The coming of war in Europe on 1 September 1939 altered Worden's pattern of operations out of San Diego. Five days after hostilities began in Poland, the Navy commenced its Neutrality Patrol duties on 6 September. On 22 September, the Chief of Naval Operations directed the Commander in Chief of the United States Fleet to transfer, temporarily, to the Hawaiian area two heavy cruiser divisions, a destroyer flotilla flagship (a light cruiser), two destroyer squadrons, one destroyer tender, an aircraft carrier, and base force units necessary for servicing those ships; that dispatch marked the establishment of the Hawaiian Detachment—the forerunner of the ultimate basing of the Fleet at Pearl Harbor. Worden was attached to this new force, commanded by Vice Admiral Adolphus Andrews, whose flag flew in the heavy cruiser Indianapolis (CA-35). On 5 October 1939, she sailed for Pearl Harbor. Worden worked primarily in the Hawaiian Islands over the next two years, interspersing her time at Pearl Harbor and its environs with regular periods of upkeep on the west coast. Upon the conclusion of Fleet Problem XXI in the Spring of 1940, the entire Fleet was based in Hawaiian waters. ==Pearl Harbor== On the morning of 7 December 1941, during the attack on Pearl Harbor, Worden lay in a nest alongside destroyer tender Dobbin (AD-3), receiving upkeep. She suffered no damage in the Japanese attack, but one of her gunners, Quartermaster 3d Class Raymond H. Brubaker, shot down a bomber with a .50-caliber Browning machine gun. Within two hours of the commencement of the attack, Worden had gotten underway and was proceeding to the open sea. Although, in the operational plans for the attack, Japanese submarines were supposed to attack American ships as they emerged from Pearl Harbor, their attempts to carry out the mission failed. The danger of enemy submarines, however, did exist; and purported submarine sightings proliferated. Worden picked up a submarine contact at 1240— well over three hours after the attack by the enemy aircraft had been completed—and dropped seven depth charges. That afternoon, the destroyer joined a task force built around the light cruiser Detroit (CL-8), the flagship of Rear Admiral Milo Draemel. Searching the seas southwest of Oahu, Worden rendezvoused with the fleet oiler Neosho (AO-23) and escorted her to a fueling rendezvous with Admiral Aubrey W. Fitch's Task Force (TF) 11 built around the aircraft carrier Lexington (CV-2). While Neosho fueled the ships of TF 11 on the morning of 11 December, Worden assumed a screening station on Lexington's bow and the next night escorted Neosho away from danger when Dewey (DD-349) discovered what looked like a surfaced enemy submarine and went on the offensive. After having seen Neosho to a safe haven at Pearl Harbor, Worden returned to the open sea on 14 December as part of the covering force moving toward Wake Island. The Wake Island Relief Expedition was recalled on the morning of 22 December; and the island fell two days before Christmas. ==1942== Worden returned to patrol and escort operations in the Hawaiian Islands; and, while thus engaged with the Lexington task force, twice dropped depth charges on suspected enemy submarine contacts off Oahu on 16 January 1942 and again six days later. Detached from TF 11 on the last day of the month, Worden left Pearl Harbor on 5 February to escort the seaplane tender Curtiss (AV-4) and the fleet oiler Platte (AO-24), via Samoa and the Fiji Islands, to New Caledonia, and reached Noumea on 21 February. Three days later, when the merchantman SS Snark struck a mine in Bulari Passage, Worden went to her assistance, passing a tow line to the sinking ship and pulling her clear of the channel entrance. Worden's medical department tended six injured men, and the ship brought the crew safely to port. Departing Nouméa on 7 March, Worden—in company with Curtiss—set course for Pearl Harbor and reached that port on the 19th. That day, the destroyer entered the navy yard there and, after her repairs had been finished, joined TF 11 on 14 April. Worden headed out to sea on the 15th, in company with the Lexington task force, bound for a rendezvous area southwest of the New Hebrides Islands, where, on 1 May, they joined Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher's TF 17, built around the carrier Yorktown (CV-5). On the 2d, after the two carrier task forces had fueled, Worden was detached to escort the fleet oiler Tippecanoe (AO-21) to Nouméa. In her absence, the American carriers engaged in the Battle of the Coral Sea. On 12 May—two days after she reached Nouméa— Worden was joined in that port by the cruisers and destroyers of the former Lexington task force. \\"Lady Lex\\" had succumbed to massive internal explosions and fires started during the battle. As part of that group, Worden put to sea on the 13th and, the following day, rendezvoused with TF 16 off Efate in the New Hebrides. Formed around the carriers Enterprise (CV-6) and Hornet (CV-8), this force was commanded by Vice Admiral William F. Halsey. ===Battle of Midway=== TF 16 reached Pearl Harbor on the 26th. Worden sailed on 28 May with TF 16—the force now under the command of Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, who had replaced Halsey. Later, TF 17— formed around the hurriedly repaired and replenished Yorktown—rendezvoused with Spruance's force to the north of Midway Island. Worden screened Enterprise and Hornet throughout the Battle of Midway from 4 to 6 June 1942. Worden returned to Pearl Harbor on the 13th and was soon assigned to the screen of a revitalized TF 11, built around the newly repaired Saratoga (CV-3). The destroyer escorted Saratoga as she sailed to Midway and flew off reinforcement groups of Army and Marine Corps aircraft before returning to the Hawaiian Islands for training. On 9 July, Worden headed for the South Pacific with Saratoga's task force but was temporarily detached on the 21st to escort Platte to Nouméa, reaching that port four days later. While Platte took on her vital cargo to replenish ships of the carrier task force, Worden patrolled the harbor entrance. On the 28th, Worden and Platte got underway to rejoin Saratoga. En route on the first night out, Worden sighted signal lights in the darkness. She soon took on board 36 survivors of the sunken Army transport Tjinegara which had been torpedoed on the 25th by the Japanese submarine I-169 and sunk about 75 miles southwest of Nouméa. Worden returned to the Saratoga group to the south of the Fiji Islands on the following day, when the carrier forces joined marine-laden troop transports that had sailed from Wellington, New Zealand, for the invasion of the Solomon Islands. Her stay with the carrier was brief, for the destroyer was soon detached to escort the fleet oiler Cimarron (AO-22) to Nouméa, where she landed the Tjinegara's survivors on 1 August. Worden caught up with TF 16 on 3 August and, shortly before daybreak on the 7th, was screening Saratoga as the carrier launched air strikes against Japanese positions on Guadalcanal and Tulagi preparatory to the landings. ===Battle of the Eastern Solomons=== For the next two weeks, Worden operated with Saratoga south of the Solomons protecting supply and communication lines leading to Guadalcanal. During the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, Worden screened the flattop as she launched air strikes in company with Enterprise to sink the Japanese carrier Ryūjō and damage the seaplane tender Chitose. Less than a week later, however, Japanese submarine I-26 torpedoed Saratoga and put her out of action, necessitating a trip to the mainland United States for repairs. Worden screened Saratoga's retirement via Tongatapu in the Tonga Islands to Pearl Harbor, arriving there on 23 September. Five days later, she sailed with two other destroyers—screening the battleships Idaho (BB-42) and Pennsylvania (BB-38)—for the west coast of the United States. She reached San Francisco, California on 4 October but departed again a week later with Gansevoort (DD-608) to accompany Idaho to Puget Sound where they arrived on the 14th. Worden soon returned south to San Francisco and later joined Dewey in screening Nevada during her post-repair trials in the San Pedro-San Diego area. ==Grounding== Main: Landing at AmchitkaUSS Worden being abandoned shortly after a hull breach beneath the engine room, 12 January 1943. On 27 December 1942, Worden sailed from San Francisco to support the occupation of Amchitka Island in the Aleutian Islands. She reached Dutch Harbor, Alaska, on New Year's Day 1943 and, on 12 January, was guarding the transport Arthur Middleton (AP-55) as that transport put the preliminary Army security unit on the shores of Constantine Harbor, Amchitka Island. The destroyer maneuvered into the rock-edged harbor and stayed there until the last men had landed and then turned to the business of clearing the harbor. A strong current, however, swept Worden onto a pinnacle that tore into her hull beneath her engine room and caused a complete loss of power. Dewey passed a towline to her stricken sister and attempted to tow her free, but the cable parted, and the heavy seas began moving Worden—totally without power— inexorably toward the rocky shore. The destroyer then broached and began breaking up in the surf; Comdr. William G. Pogue, the stricken destroyer's commanding officer, ordered abandon ship; and, as he was directing that effort, was swept overboard into the wintry seas by a heavy wave that broke over the ship. Pogue was among the fortunate ones, however, because he was hauled, unconscious, out of the sea. Fourteen of his crew drowned. Worden, herself, was a total loss. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 22 December 1944. Worden earned four battle stars for her World War II service. ==References== ==External links== * USS Worden homepage A collection of photographs, documents and memories of those of served aboard the USS Worden DD352 Worden (DD-352) Worden (DD-352) Category:Ships built in Washington (state) Category:Ships present during the attack on Pearl Harbor Category:Ships of the Aleutian Islands campaign Category:World War II shipwrecks in the Pacific Ocean Category:1934 ships Category:Maritime incidents in January 1943 ","title":"USS Worden (DD-352)"},{"id":"2563005","text":"Charles Frederick Lindauer I (1836–1921) was a New York businessman and criminal. He was involved in the New York City corruption scandal of 1894, he was the policy dealer; cigar dealer and tobacconist in Manhattan and Hoboken, at Lindauer and Company; he was a Free and Accepted Mason. == Birth == Charles was born in 1836 in Philadelphia to Oscar Arthur Moritz Lindauer (1815–1866) and Sophia Weber (1815–1891). == Siblings == John Jacob Lindauer (1841–1888) who married Nellie X (1853–1899), worked as a cigar maker, and had several children and grandchildren; Louis Julius Lindauer (1842–1915) who married Mary Sheehan (1842–1888) and had several children and a few grandchildren but no known great-grandchildren; and Eloise Lindauer I (1852–1944) who married William Arthur Ensko II (1850–1889) and have several children and grandchildren. == Marriage == In February 1857 Charles married Anna Augusta Kershaw (1841–1931), most likely in New York City. == Children == Together Charles and Anna had the following children: Eloise Lindauer II (1861–1935) aka Ellie Lindauer, who married Maximillian S. Freudenberg I (1858–1921) aka Max Freudenberg; William Lindauer (1866-c1870); Adeline Lindauer I (1862-before1921) aka Ada Lindauer I, who married Charles L. Schoenfeld (c1860-?); Anna Lillian Lindauer (1872–1956) who married Ira Lowe (1875-bef1910); Harry Chauncey Lindauer I (1877–1923) who married Hannah Shea (1884–?) and died of syphilis; and LeBaron Hart Lindauer (1879–1945) aka Lee Lindauer, who is named after the physician that attended his birth, and he later married Catherine Harney (1878–1966). == Children with other women == Oscar most likely fathered children with other women and they include: Arthur Oscar Lindauer (1867–1944) who was a trapeze performer who never married and who doesn't appear on the 1870 census with the other children; Grover Cleveland Lindauer (1885–1968) with Mary Dunne as the mother; Louis Miller who is listed as a brother of Grover in a family photo; and Charlotte Lindauer (1869–1894) aka Lottie Lindauer, with Caroline Ritter as the mother. Lottie was buried in Brooklyn with Charles' other children. Other children exist that died at birth or as infants and are buried at Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York, but their birth and death certificates must still be found in the New York archives to confirm if they are the children of Charles or one of his siblings. == Free and Accepted Mason == Tom Savini of the Livingston Masonic Library writes: \\"Brother [Charles] Lindauer received his first Masonic degree in 1861 at the age of 24. His occupation was 'clerk', his birthplace reads 'America', and his residence as 'New York'. The date of his first degree was March 23, 1861; he received his 2nd degree on April 03, 1861; and he completed his membership in the lodge with his 3rd degree on January 27, 1864. It seems possible that Brother Lindauer took part in the Civil War, as it is not usual to have a three-year gap between the 2nd and 3rd degrees.\\" == Manhattan, New York == In 1866 Charles was listed in the New York City Directory working at 193, 188 and 280 Canal Street at an \\"exchange\\" and living in New Jersey. In 1866 he was listed as working at 193 Canal Street at an \\"exchange\\". == 1870 Census == In 1870 the name \\"Charles Lindauer\\" appears twice in the census in two different households. The first appearance has Charles Lindauer born in \\"New York\\" in 1870, living with his mother and his wife Anna, and his first three children: Eloise, William, and Adeline. Missing from the household is Arthur Oscar Lindauer who was born in 1867 but he may have a different mother. A few blocks away in Manhattan, there was a Charles Lindauer born in 1870 in \\"Pennsylvania\\", working as a policy dealer. This Charles is listed as the husband of Caroline (Carrie) Titter and they had two children: George Lindauer (1867–?); and Charlotte Lindauer (1869–1894) aka Lottie Lindauer. Charlotte Lindauer was buried in the Lindauer family plot in Cypress Hills under the name \\"Lottie Landers\\" and her mother was listed as \\"Carrie\\" and the father as \\"Charles\\" on her death certificate. == Hoboken, New Jersey == In 1880 Charles and Anna were living at 51 8th Street in Hoboken, New Jersey with their children and their new son-in-law: Maximillian S. Freudenberg. == Cigars == Charles was working as a cigar dealer according to the 1880 census. In the 1880–1881 New York City Directory he is listed as selling cigars at 184 Mercer Street, and he was living at 45 Morton Street. His brother Louis Julius Lindauer was also listed as selling \\"segars\\". All three brothers appear in the Jersey City and Hoboken Directory of 1880–1890 as cigar dealers or cigar makers. == Lindauer & Company, tobacconists == The following appears in the Brooklyn Eagle on June 2, 1889: > \\"News from Jersey City. August Mueller, who was the collector in this city > for Lindauer & Co., tobacconist, was sent to jail this morning for contempt > of court. His employers were dissatisfied with his returns and had a > receiver appointed to examine his accounts. Mueller refused to surrender his > books and his arrest followed.\\" == Policy dealer == Charles Lindauer, the policy dealer, was involved in the 1894–1895 corruption scandal in New York City and his name came up in the Lexow Committee hearings run by State Senator Clarence Lexow of Nyack, New York. Testimony involving Charles was: \\"Lindauer has a new place [in New York City]; he is a small fry backer.\\" == Rye, New York == Between 1890 and 1895 Charles moved the family to Rye, Westchester County, New York. He bought the Halsted estate at 209 Locust Avenue and Maple Avenue. The move most likely was by him being named by the Lexow Committee for running a numbers game in Manhattan. The oral family tradition was that he owned several \\"wine or beer gardens\\" and lived in a huge estate in Rye. In 1900 he was living in Rye with his unmarried children and two nephews: Grover Dunne; and Louis Miller. Grover and Louis appear in a family photograph, but where they fit in family tree is not certain yet. It's possible that Charles fathered the two \\"nephews\\" with other women. Grover Dunne aka Grover Cleveland Lindauer (1885–1968) never would talk about his parents, but his death certificate lists his mother as \\"Mary Dunne\\" and his father as \\"Charles Lindauer\\". In 1910 the family was living at 209 Locust Avenue in Rye and they were living with: Anna Lindauer, now a widow, and her two children: Blanche Lowe (1898–1998); and Joseph (Joe) Lowe (1903–1979). Both Charles and his son, LeBaron, appear in the 1914–1915 Rye City Directory with LeBaron working as a clerk. In 1920 Charles and Anna were still living at 209 Locust Avenue, but now in the house was their son, Arthur Oscar Lindauer. In 1920 Charles' other son, Harry was living at 38 Elm Place in Rye, with his wife, child and the following siblings: LeBaron Hart Lindauer (1879–1945) and his wife Catherine Harney (1878–1966); Anna Lindauer (1873–1956) the widow of Ira Lowe I (1870-bef1910) and her two children, Blanche and Joseph Lowe. == Death == Charles died in 1921 of \\"myocarditis\\" and he was buried in Greenwood Union Cemetery in Rye, New York with his wife, and daughter Anna Lillian Lindauer (1872–1956) who married Ira Lowe. == Obituary == His obituary appeared in the Port Chester Daily Item on Thursday, March 3, 1921 and reads as follows: > \\"Charles F. Lindauer, a resident of Rye for thirty years or more, died at > his home on Locust Avenue at 3:40 yesterday afternoon. Deceased was in his > eighty-eighth year and had been a sufferer from a complication of diseases. > His confinement to bed had been quite brief, however, inasmuch as he was > quite active only a few weeks ago, when he and his wife celebrated the > sixty-fourth anniversary of their marriage.

Production of Daddies has now been moved to Poland. In 1899, Edwin Samson Moore, the owner of the Midland Vinegar Company in Aston Cross, Birmingham, made a visit to one of his customers who owed him a debt for vinegar.

Aslanov was promoted to the rank of major-general on March 13, 1944, at the age of 34 years and a month, making him one of youngest Soviet generals. He was awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union title twice. The second Hero title was awarded on July 12, 1991, by Mikhail Gorbachev, at the constant recommendations by Heydar Aliyev.“We are heirs of victory” campaign started in Baku ==Early years== Hazi Aslanov was born on January 22, 1910, in Lankaran in a working-class family. When he lost his father at the age of 13, he left local school number 1 and worked in the Lankaran Brick Plant.Дважды Герой Советского Союза Улицы Волгограда, названные в честь боевых соединений, военначальников и героев Сталинградской битвы In 1929, Aslanov graduated from the Transcaucasian Preparatory Military School in Baku and continued his education at Leningrad Cavalry School, where he passed courses at the Military Academy of Armored Forces.Герои Великой Отечественной войны After graduation, in June 1931 he was appointed commander of a 15th Cavalry Regiment platoon of 3rd Cavalry Division Bessarabia named after Grigory Kotovsky.Люди:Ази Асланов In June, 1933, he was appointed commander of the separate tank company. In 1937, he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.Michael Parrish, Sacrifice of the Generals: Soviet Senior Officer Losses, 1939-1953, Scarecrow Press, 2004, , p. 28.

In the fierce battles near Shostka, Bakhmach and Pyriatyn, his tank commanders fought to the last tank, while Aslanov personally led his battalion in the attack. In one of these battles, Aslanov received two bullet wounds in his right leg and a severe shrapnel wound to the head, but despite these injuries, he continued to fight. When the battalion lost all of its tanks, he was recalled to the reserve in September 1941.

This engine is not to be confused with the unrelated Nissan SR20, which is a straight 4 cylinder petrol engine used in other Nissan models. The S20 powered Nissan's Skyline GT-R (C10 and C110) and Fairlady Z432 models. == In Motorsport == Compared to the Nissan L series straight six engines, the S20 was too small and too complex. In the 1970 All- Japan Fuji 1000km race, 6 Fairlady Z 432R models were entered with the S20, and one with an L24 fitted. The Z fitted with the L24 won easily, and due to its simpler and more robust design, the L- series went on to become the favored engine in motorsport and tuning,https://www.classiczcars.com/forums/topic/56870-l24-battles- six-s20s-guess-who-wins/ while the S20 remains relatively obscure. ==History== S20 engine installed in Fairlady Z432 The S20 was one of the technical carryovers to the Nissan brand from Prince technology. The Skyline model - built as a Prince car since the model's inception in the 1950s - received the new engine. The Skyline GT-B in 1969 saw the introduction of the PGC10 GT-R, followed by the KPGC10 GT-R with a shorter wheelbase and 2 fewer doors in 1970. This model would later win 49 straight touring car victories. For 1972, Nissan introduced the C110 Skyline powered by the L series of engines. A small number of KPGC110 GT-R would be built utilizing the remainder of the S20s. The S20 was later fitted to the Nissan Fairlady Z432, a sports racing model of the Nissan Fairlady Z (S30) model line. The S20 features a dual overhead cam, cross-flow head with four valves per cylinder, and pent-roof combustion chamber. Most engines utilized triple Mikuni-Solex 40PHH dual-choke carburetors; models after 1969 offered optional Lucas mechanical fuel injection.

Designed at the IBM Los Gatos lab, the IBM 3624, along with the later IBM 4732 model, was manufactured at IBM facilities in Charlotte, North Carolina and Havant, England until all operations were sold to Diebold, tied to the formation of the InterBold partnership between IBM and Diebold. Comparable ATM units marketed by other companies at the time were the Diebold TABS 9000 and NCR 50xx series. ==Versions and features== The 3624 was marketed in eight different versions. The 3624 Version 8 incorporated use of a six-row by forty-column dot-matrix customer display, four line by 34 character statement / journal printer, labeled function / account keys, one to two currency cartridges and an optional depository. Earlier models, such as the Version 2, featured a smaller two-line display. Unusual by today's standards, the customer's ATM card was inserted with the magnetic stripe up. Modern ATMs typically are built to expect customers to insert their card with the magnetic strip facing down (with the added benefit of the card issuer's logo being displayed to the customer on insert), although this can be changed to the opposite orientation. The transaction records printed by the 3624 and used by customers to verify their transactions were approximately 3 inches square and on similar card stock to punch cards. When performing deposits, customers were instructed to place a special transaction record inside of the deposit envelope to aid in the processing of the transaction by the back office staff. An unfortunate design characteristic of the 3624 was that the vault that contained the cash dispenser was located in the upper area of the unit, making it top-heavy. This made the 3624 an extremely awkward machine to transport up and down stairs. Another complaint against the 3624 was the relatively small size of the cash cartridges (used to give money to customers) in comparison to other vendors' equipment at the time. As was typical for ATM hardware of this era, the IBM 3624 had a two distinct high-level communications protocols. The first, a direct mainframe attachment through SDLC links was an IBM SNA LU0 protocol. The second was an attachment to the IBM 3600 and 4700 series of banking equipment, and was a start stop TDM loop with time slots assigned to specific 36xx series equipment at 1200 bit/sec. The IBM 3612, 3624 and 3600 communications protocols were incompatible with other ATM vendor's high-level communications protocols. The 3624 was eventually replaced by the IBM 473x series of ATMs which were unsuccessful. Part of the reason for the failure of the IBM 473x to take hold in the ATM marketplace was the lack of a backward compatibility to the 3624 protocol when it was introduced. One of the most lasting features introduced with the 3624 was the IBM 3624 PIN block format used in transmission of an encrypted personal identification number (PIN). The PIN functions, with an early commercial encryption using the DES algorithm, were implemented in two modules - BQKPERS and BQKCIPH - and their export controlled under the US export munitions rules. ==References== ==External links== * A brief mention of the 3624 protocol from IBM * Methods to attack the 3624 PIN Block Category:Automated teller machines Category:Diebold 3624 ","title":"IBM 3624"},{"id":"2563074","text":"Greg Gall (born December 29, 1965 in Tampa, Florida), was the drummer for the death metal band, Six Feet Under.

It was built between the 12th century and the 15th century, and is in the Romanesque architectural tradition. The sculptures over the church's portal, particularly the Last Judgement, and the columns in the adjacent cloister, are considered some of the finest examples of Romanesque sculpture. The church was built upon the site of the 5th-century basilica of Arles, named for St. Stephen.Jacques Thirion, Saint-Trophime d'Arles dans Congrès Archéologique de France - 1976 - Pays d'Arles, page 360: :\\"\\"Cette nouvelle cathédrale (note : Saint-Trophime), bâtie en exploitant les monuments romains tout proches, fut placée, comme l'atteste la Vie de saint Hilaire écrite après 461, sous un vocable dont la vogue était toute récente, celui de saint Etienne, dont les reliques avaient été découvertes en 415.\\"\\" In the 15th century a Gothic choir was added to the Romanesque nave. ==Timeline== 1851 photograph by Édouard Baldus *250 According to legend, Trophimus of Arles becomes the first bishop of Arles. *597 (November 17).

It had a busy port on the Rhône, and two new cities, on either side of the old Roman town, surrounded by a wall. It was at least formally independent as the Kingdom of Arles, and it had attracted many religious orders, including the Knights Hospitalier, the Knights Templar and mendicant orders, which had built a number of churches within the town.St. Trophime Cloister Guide, Text by Jean-Maurice Rouquette, Claude Sintes, Louis Stouff, Andreas Hartmann-Vimich. Published by the Service du Patrimoine, City of Arles, 2000. The apse and the transept were probably built first, in the late 11th century, and the nave and bell tower were completed in the second quarter of the 12th century.St. Trophime Cloister Guide The Romaneque church had a long central nave 20 meters high; lower collateral aisles on either side; a transept supporting the square central bell tower; and a chevet behind the altar at the east end with a hemispherical vault. The windows are small and high up on the nave, above the level of the collateral aisles. ==Post- Romanesque art== Though mainly notable for its outstanding Romanesque architecture and sculpture, the church contains rich groups of art from other periods. These include several important carved Late Roman sarcophagi, reliquaries from various periods, and Baroque paintings, with three by Louis Finson. Trophime Bigot is also represented, and there are several Baroque tapestries, including a set of ten on the Life of the Virgin. The church has been used to hold items originally from other churches or religious houses in the region that were dispersed in the French Revolution or at other times. == The West Portal == Tympanum of the west portal The west portal is one of the treasures of Romanesque sculpture, presenting the story of the Apocalypse according to St. John, and the Gospel of St. Matthew. Christ is seated in majesty in the timpanum, with the symbols of the Evangelists around him; according to the most common interpretation, they are the man of St. Matthew, the lion of St. Mark, the ox of St. Luke, and the eagle of St. John. The Apostles are seated below him. To the left of the portal, a procession of chosen Christians is going to heaven, while to the right sinners are being cast into hell. The decoration of the portal also includes a multitude of Biblical scenes; the Annunciation; the Baptism of Christ; the Adoration of the Magi, the Magi before Herod; the Massacre of the Innocents; shepherds with their flocks. On the lower level, separated by pilasters and columns of dark stone, are statues of saints connected with the history of Arles; on the left, St. Bartholomew, St. James the Great, St. Trophimus, St. John the Evangelist, and St. Peter; and on the right, St. Philip, St. James the Just, St. Stephen, St. Andrew, and St. Paul. The bases of the columns beside the portal are decorated with statues of lions, Samson and Delilah, and Samson and the Lion.Aldo Bastié, Les Chemins de la Provence, Editions Ouest-France, nd == The Cloister == Cloister capital showing Christ entering Jerusalem (east gallery) Photo-textured laser scan image of the Cloister of St. Triophime. The image clearly shows the contrast between the vaulting of its different galleries. The north and east galleries (12th to early 13th century) are barrel-vaulted Romanesque, while the later south and west galleries (14th century) are early Gothic in form with pointed transverse arches. The cloister was constructed in the second half of the 12th century and the first half of the 13th century. for the use of the Canons, the priests who attended the bishop and managed the church property. Under a reform instituted by Pope Gregory, the Canons were required to live like monks, with a common dormitory, refectory and cloister within the cathedral enclosure, separated by a wall from the city. The refectory, or dining hall, was built first, next to the church, along with a chapter house, or meeting room, for the canons. The dormitory for the canons, a large vaulted room on the east side of the cloister, was built next. Work on the cloister began with the northern gallery, then the eastern gallery, which were finished around 1210-1220. Then work suddenly stopped. Soon after the construction of the east and west galleries, the city began to decline. The Counts of Provence moved from Arles to Aix, the center of church authority moved to the papal palace in Avignon, and in 1251 Charles of Anjou suppressed the movement of the leaders of Arles for more independence. In 1348, The Black Death drastically reduced the population of all of Provence. The southern and western galleries of the cloister were not built until the 1380s and 1390s, and they were built in a different style, the Gothic style favored by the Popes in Avignon, with cross-ribbed vaults. In 1355, the canons gave up living in the dormitory, and moved to houses within the cathedral close. The dormitory, refectory and chapter house were turned into granaries and storehouses. The northern gallery, built in the second quarter of the 12th century, is purely Romanesque, with a barrel vault ceiling. The carvings of the columns capitals are devoted to the Easter Mystery and to the glorification of the patron saints of Arles. The relationships between the figures on the pillars and the capitals of the columns show the relationships between the Old and New Testaments, a theme introduced in Paris by Suger, the abbot of Saint Denis. The first corner pillar in the northern gallery is devoted to St. Trophime, the patron saint Arles, between the figures of Saint Peter and Saint John. The bas-relief on the walls show the Christ's empty tomb on Easter morning. The capitals of the columns depict Lazarus coming out of his tomb between Martha and Mary; Abraham about to sacrifice his son; and Balaam on his ass being stopped by a sword-wielding angel. The next three columns show St. Stephen being stoned, combined with a portrait of St. Paul; Christ encountering the disciples, shown as pilgrims on their way to Compostela, at Emaus; and Christ showing his wounds to the unbelieving Thomas. The capitals between the columns show three Angels appearing to Abraham; and St. Paul addressing Areopagus of Athens. The only illustrated capital in the last bay shows Moses meeting God before the burning bush. The Resurrection story concludes on the northeast corner pillar with the Ascension of Jesus, next to the figures of Saint Paul and St. Andrew on either side of St. Stephen. The Eastern Gallery, built the late 12th or early 13th century, has some Gothic features, including figures in the quoins of wise virgins and foolish virgins and the symbols of the Four Evangelists. The Passion story is told on the pillars, while the life of Christ is depicted on the carved capitals. The scenes of Christ's childhood can be are read on the capitals from north to south; the Annunciation, the Visitation and the Nativity on the first capital; the next capital shows the coat of arms of Arles and an eagle with spread wings, the symbol of the Holy Roman Emperor, who at the time ruled Arles; the third capital shows the Annunciation to the shepherds, with two startled goats climbing the Tree of Life. The pillar in the first bay begins the story of the Passion with the flagellation of Christ. On the opposite side is Judas clutching a purse with thirty pieces of silver. The capitals in the central bay illustrate the story of the Magi, out of historical order; the successive columns show the Massacre of the Innocents; the Flight into Egypt; the angel appearing to the Magi at the inn; the three wise men before Herod; the Adoration of the Magi, and the angel appearing to Joseph in a dream. The pillar in the second bay has two statues, probably representing St. John and the Mother Church. The capitals in the third bay illustrate the entry of Christ into Jerusalem, Palm Sunday and Pentecost, and a knight striking down an adversary, and then walking over to a lady; possibly representing Constantine defeating paganism and then being thanked by the mother church. The southern pillar illustrates the Baptism of Christ and the devil tempting Christ, Christ washing the apostles' feet, the Last Supper and the kiss of Judas. The Southern Gallery probably dates to the 1380s or 1390s, and is built in the Gothic style, with pointed arches intersecting vaults resting on colonnettes with foliated capitals. The capitals in the southern gallery are entirely devoted to the story of St. Trophimus; the first shows St. Trophime blessing the Alyscamps burial ground, and dedicating an oratory to the still- living Virgin Mary; the next four show a miracle performed by the intervention of St. Trophime; he brings back to life a knight and nine of his relatives unjustly sentenced to death by the Emperor Charlemagne for slapping the archbishop Turpin. The Western Gallery probably dates to about 1375, and is devoted to religious figures and scenes popular in Provence; from south to north: the stoning of St. Stephen; Samson slaying the lion and yielding to Delilah; Saint Martha and the Tarasque; Mary Magdalene kissing Christ's feet; the Annunciation in a Gothic setting; the Coronation of the Virgin; and the Pentecost. ==See also== * Our Lady of Victory Chapel, a Minnesota church whose architecture was strongly influenced by St. Trophime. * St Trophimus' Church, Eschau ==Gallery== File:St-Trophime portail gauche.jpgLeft side of west portal File:St-Trophime monstrum.jpgDetails of the west portal File:Saint- Trophime 803.jpgDaniel in the lions' den on the west portal File:Arles St. Trophime Church Interior.jpgNave, late 12th to 15th century File:Arles St. Trophime Church Sarcophagus.jpgRoman sarcophagus in the church, reputed to hold the remains of Saint Honoratus File:Arles St. Trophime Church Cloister Capital with Face.jpgCloister column capital with face File:Arles St. Trophime Church Cloister Column St. Trophime.jpgCloister column with carving of St. Trophimus, (north gallery) File:Arles St. Trophime Church Cloister Column Stoning of St. Stephen.jpgCloister column showing the stoning of St. Stephen File:Media STT 20091022 133649 med.jpgCloister capital in West Gallery depicting the mythical Tarasque beast of Provence ==References== ==External links== * Saint-Trophime Digital Media Archive (creative commons- licensed photos, laser scans, panoramas) on the portal, interior of church, and cloister (particularly the column capitals), using data from a World Monuments Fund/CyArk research partnership * St. Trophime, Arles, Christine M.

Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh identified them as part of a larger group called the Cruithin, and stated of them: Of the Cruithin of Ireland are the Dál Araidhi (Dál nAraidi), the seven Lóigisi of Leinster, the seven Soghain of Ireland, and every Conaille (see Conaille Muirtheimne) that is in Ireland. ==Locations== Early peoples and kingdoms of Ireland, c. 800 The location of four of the seven Soghain is as follows: * A branch in the territory of Fernmag (barony of Farney, County Monaghan). * In Delvin (County Westmeath) where a Soghain tribe lived with a branch of the Delbhna in an area called Trícha cét na Delbna Móire agus na Sogan. * The Corcu Shogain, who were subject to the Benntraige under the Eoghanacht. An Ogham inscription discovered near Aglish in the barony of Muskerry, some twelve miles west of the city of Cork, displays the words MUCOI SOGINI, which probably means of the Corcu Sogain. * The Soghain of Connacht were located in central east County Galway, in a kingdom called Tír Sogháin. ==Tír Sogháin== The Soghain of Connacht were located in Tír Sogháin, an area in central east County Galway bounded by the river Suck on the east, the river Clare on the west; the Grange and Shiven rivers to the north; the Raford and Ballinure rivers to the south. A poem recorded in The Book of Uí Maine, Cruas Connacht clanna Sogain, lists the kingdom's boundaries, which can be found to tie in with the above locations: *From Áth an Ibar west *to Glais Uair Arnaigh *was the extent of Sodhan *that sword-guarded land. *From Béal na Róbe in Maenmagh *to the clear, soft-reeded Simin *was the breath of the plain *which bore no ignominy. The previous, pre-Gaelic people of the area were called the Senchineoil. Very little information survives on them. The Soghain of Connacht were described by Seán Mór Ó Dubhagáin in his poem Triallam timcheall na Fodla where he states: The six Sogain let us not shun/their kings are without oblivion/Good the host of plundering excursions/to whom the spear-armed Sogain is hereditary. The Book of Lecan lists their six branches as Cinel Rechta, Cinel Trena, Cinel Luchta, Cinel Fergna, Cinel Domaingen and Cinel Deigill. The genealogy of Saint Kerrill of Cloonkeenkerrill is given as Caireall mac Curnain mac Treana mac Fionnchada mac Nair mac Earca mac Tiobraide mac Sodhain Salbhuidhe mac Fiacha Araidhe. His grandfather, Treana mac Fionnchada, was the eponym of the Cinel Trena, who were apparently located close to Knockma as evinced by the placename Tír Mhic Trena (the land of the sons of Trena). This area was the western limit of the kingdom of the Connacht Soghain. Early Christian evangelists among the Soghain included Conainne, St Connell and Kerrill. Their successors include Naomhéid, Cuana of Kilcoonagh, Dubhán, Felig, Íbar, Íomar of the Sogain, Laisren of Cloonkerrill, Maol Chosna, Modiúit, Menott, Molua of Kilmoluagh. Parishes known to be included in Tír Sogháin were: * Abbeyknockmoy * Abbert * Ballymacward * Cloonkeenkerrill * Fohenagh * Lackagh * Kilconnell * Kilgerrill * Killascobe * Monivea * Moylough Tír Sogháin became subject to the Uí Maine sometime during the first millennium. ==Descendants== Descendants of the Soghain are still found in great numbers in County Galway, bearing names such as Mannion, Ward/Mac an Bhaird, Gill/Gillane, Scarry, Duggan, Megan/McGann, Martin, Cassain. ==Annalistic references== * 811.

Isabel is also exhibiting a pinwheel eye, a rare feature found in some annular tropical cyclones. An annular tropical cyclone is a tropical cyclone that features a normal to large, symmetric eye surrounded by a thick and uniform ring of intense convection, often having a relative lack of discrete rainbands, and bearing a symmetric appearance in general. As a result, the appearance of an annular tropical cyclone can be referred to as akin to a tire or doughnut. Annular characteristics can be attained as tropical cyclones intensify; however, outside the processes that drive the transition from asymmetric systems to annular systems and the abnormal resistance to negative environmental factors found in storms with annular features, annular tropical cyclones behave similarly to asymmetric storms. Most research related to annular tropical cyclones is limited to satellite imagery and aircraft reconnaissance as the conditions thought to give rise to annular characteristics normally occur over water well removed from landmasses where surface observations are possible. ==Characteristics and identification== The annular hurricane was first defined as a subset of tropical cyclones by John Knaff of Colorado State University and James Kossin of the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 2002 by use of infrared satellite imagery, which serves as the visual means of ascertaining annular characteristics within tropical cyclone. Knaff and Kossin defined an annular tropical cyclone as a tropical cyclone that maintains either an average or larger-than-average eye surrounded by deep convection containing the storm's inner core and a lack of convection occurring outside the central dense overcast for at least three hours. As a result, annular storms lack the rainbands characteristic of typical tropical cyclone. These features lend the storm an axisymmetric appearance common to annular tropical cyclones. However, this definition is only applicable while a storm maintains these characteristics—when and while a storm does not feature annular characteristics, the tropical cyclone is considered asymmetric. In addition to the primary defining characteristics, the diurnal pulsation of the cirrus cloud canopy associated with outflow is subdued once storms become annular. Some annular tropical cyclones may also display a \\"pinwheel eye\\", a feature in which conditions in the storm causes its eye to take the appearance of a spoked wheel. An algorithm for identification of annular tropical cyclones in real-time by objective criteria has been developed, and shows some power, but is not yet operational. Although tropical cyclones can achieve annular characteristics across a wide spectrum of intensities, annular storms are typically strong tropical cyclones, with average maximum sustained windspeeds of 108 kn (200 km, 124 mph). In addition, storms attaining annular characteristics are less prone to weakening as a result of negative environmental factors. Annular cyclones can maintain their respective peak intensities for extended periods of time unlike their asymmetric counterparts. Following peak intensity, such systems will tend to gradually taper off. This unusual intensity persistence makes their future intensities difficult to forecast and often results in large forecast errors. In an analysis of hurricanes in the East Pacific and North Atlantic between 1995 and 1999, Knaff and Kossin observed that the National Hurricane Center underestimated the intensity of annular hurricanes 72 hours out by 18.9 kn (35.0 km/h, 21.7 mph). A survey of Pacific typhoons between 1990 and 2009 found only 12 with annular characteristics, representing an occurrence rate of 4 percent. ==Transition from asymmetric cyclones and necessary conditions== Typhoon Noru of 2017, displaying all annular characteristics (minus the pinwheel eye) Tropical cyclones can become annular as a result of eyewall mesovortices mixing the strong winds found in the eyewalls of storms with the weak winds of the eye, which helps to expand the eye. In addition, this process helps to make the equivalent potential temperature (often referred to as theta-e or \\\\theta_e) within the eye relatively uniform. This transition takes roughly 24 hours to complete and can be considered a type of eyewall replacement cycle. Winds have also been found to decrease in a stairstep like fashion within the radius of maximum wind, which may indicate that more wind is mixed between the eye and eyewall as cyclones strengthen, which helps to explain why annular characteristics are generally exclusive to storms of higher intensities. The intensity of annular systems is typically greater than 83.5% of the maximum potential intensity, suggesting that the conditions in which storms gain annular characteristics are generally conducive for tropical cyclone persistence and intensification. Annular tropical cyclones also require low wind shear, and of the storms in the East Pacific and North Atlantic studied by Knaff and Kossin, all exhibited easterly winds and cold air in the upper troposphere. In addition to strong outflow, suggesting that the conditions that give rise to annular tropical cyclones are most optimal towards the equatorward side of a subtropical ridge and within the tropics. However, warmer sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are not required for annular tropical cyclones, with annular characteristics developing only within a narrow range of modest SSTs, ranging from . Conditions favorable for annular typhoon development in the Western North Pacific are localized within two areas within a zonal belt between 20°N−30°N; one of these areas lies over the central part of the basin, while the other is located east of Taiwan. Within the Eastern North Pacific, such conditions were present only 3 percent of the time between 1998 and 1999. In the same timeframe, the North Atlantic basin only exhibited conducive conditions for annular development 0.8 percent of the time. ==See also== *Tropical cyclogenesis *Tropical cyclone forecasting *Central dense overcast *Coriolis force ==References== Category:Tropical cyclone meteorology ","title":"Annular tropical cyclone"},{"id":"2563114","text":"HMCS Cape Breton is a name used by several ships of the Royal Canadian Navy: * , River-class frigate launched in 1942 * , Cape-class maintenance ship named in 1952 Category:Royal Canadian Navy ship names ","title":"HMCS Cape Breton"},{"id":"2563117","text":"Mohammad Kassas (; born 1 July 1976) is a Lebanese former professional footballer who played as a striker.

The consolidated group is available in 62 of the state's 67 counties. In West Virginia, the company operates as Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield West Virginia, and in Delaware, it operates as Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield Delaware. The new company based its head offices in downtown Pittsburgh. On March 28, 2007, Highmark announced it intended to consolidate with Independence Blue Cross of Philadelphia. The combination of the 2 insurers would have created a new company with over 18,000 employees, dual-headquarters in both Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and an economic impact of over $4 billion throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. On January 22, 2009, Highmark and Independence Blue Cross withdrew their applications to consolidate due to the unacceptability of conditions that the Pennsylvania Insurance Department was going to place upon the merger: to give up either of their well-known \\"Blue Cross\\" or \\"Blue Shield\\" trademarks. In 2011 the company announced it would buy the financially troubled West Penn Allegheny Health System (WPAHS) for about $500 million, expanding from insurance into owning hospitals. This began a period of conflict between Highmark and UPMC, which had expanded from hospitals into insurance, and caused difficulties for patients to access care at the conflicting institutions. The conflict included a lawsuit by Highmark against UPMC alleging that UPMC over-billed it by $300 million for cancer drugs, arbitrators ordered UPMC to pay $188 million. In 2014, a gay couple criticized Highmark for not providing family coverage to same-sex couples under the Affordable Care Act. Highmark later reversed their policy.

Founded in 1956 by Joseph Hardy, it derives its name from the unincorporated village of Eighty Four, Pennsylvania, a census-designated place south of Pittsburgh, where its headquarters are located. In 1992, Joe Hardy’s daughter, Maggie Hardy Knox, took over as president of the company. Within her first year as president, the company reached $1 billion in revenue for the first time in history. As of June 2020, 84 Lumber owns and operates over 250 stores in 30 states throughout the country; the company has more than 5,600 employees and generates in excess of $3.9 billion in annual revenue. Today, it is the largest privately-held supplier of building materials to the construction industry. From its origins as a lumberyard, the company has continued to innovate and expand, and now offers a full slate of construction and design services. It operates components plants, door shops, installation centers and wood products shops. It recently expanded to kitchen and bath design services with the opening of more than 30 design studios within its existing stores. The company’s stores carry a variety of materials including siding, decking, windows and trim, roofing and trusses, and much more. ==History== Located south of Pittsburgh, 84 Lumber established its roots in Eighty Four, Pennsylvania, a rural community that has endured as a farmland community. 84 Lumber flourished with the funds and determination of Ed Ryan and Jack Kunkle, Joe Hardy and his two brothers Norman and Bob Hardy. Together, these men collected $84,000 for land and buildings to grow their business. As the business expanded, Hardy and his brothers became sole owners of the company. 84 Lumber established a cash and carry system; customers paid by cash or check, if merchandise was unable to be “carried” out, an additional charge was implemented to have the item personally delivered. Throughout the 1960s, 84 Lumber continued to expand locations. This was accomplished largely by keeping overhead low and adopting a 'no frills' warehouse-style approach to most of its stores (many of which were unheated, even in cold-climate locations), as most of its clients were commercial customers not overly concerned with aesthetics. By 1981, 84 Lumber had expanded to 339 stores, 283 of which had opened within the previous 10 years, generating revenues of $478 million. In 1984, the company undertook an expansion plan to open at least 30 new stores. Along with grand openings, stores were remodeled and renovated from no-frills lumber yards to new and improved building materials stores. In 1987, as the improvement plan generated success, the business opened its strict policy of cash-and-carry to options of using credit. After 34 years of running the company, Joe Hardy appointed his daughter Maggie Hardy Knox president and owner in 1992. Joe Hardy passed 40 percent of the company stock to Maggie that year as well, and added another 40 percent the following year. With a new leader, 84 Lumber continued to expand and reached $1 billion in sales for the first time in 1993 and opened its 400th store in 1997 in Ephrata, Pennsylvania. In 1999, 84 Lumber opened its first “84 Plus” retail store in Graysville, Tennessee. The store, designed by Maggie Hardy Knox, carried about 12,000 products and was meant to increase the company’s profits by selling products at a higher profit margin. On December 7, 2002, the company exceeded $2 billion in annual sales for the first time in history. In 2004, the company opened another 18 new stores, most of which are located in metropolitan areas that had once been unprofitable. 84 Lumber suffered great losses in sales when the housing market crashed in 2009. On the brink of bankruptcy, Hardy Knox leveraged her own personal finances and closed stores to stave off bankruptcy. Knox's efforts ultimately proved to be successful. In 2013, 84 Lumber increased sales 27 percent over the prior year, generating $2.1 billion in revenue. Since then, the company has continued to expand and open new stores and manufacturing facilities year after year. In 2016, 84 Lumber announced a major expansion plan on the west coast. In 2019, the company opened its largest store to-date in Chesterfield (Richmond), Virginia. ==Corporate Affairs== === Awards and Accolades === 84 Lumber has been the recipient of numerous trade and business awards and accolades over the years. In 1991, 84 Lumber topped ProSales magazine’s “Dealer 100” list. Since then, it has made the influential trade magazine’s list every year, reaching a high ranking of No. 4 in 2019 and 2020. 84 Lumber was named as one of Forbes’ Best Midsize Employers in America 2016 and Forbes’ Largest Private Companies in America 2016. In 2018, it was recognized as one of America’s Largest Private Companies by Forbes and was named a Top Workplace in the Greater Pittsburgh region by Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. In 2019, it was named one of Forbes Magazine’s “Best Larger Employers” and was named to INC. Magazine’s “INC. 5,000” list in 2019 and 2020. === Advertising === In 2017, 84 Lumber broadcast its first-ever Super Bowl ad, \\"The Journey\\", during Super Bowl LI. The advertisement chronicled a mother and daughter migrating from Mexico to the United States, interspersed with scenes of workers building. When they are blocked by a border wall, the daughter presents a handmade U.S. flag she had made using fabric collected throughout their trip. The two then discover a giant door in the wall they use to enter the country; the ad concluded with the message, \\"The will to succeed is always welcome here.\\" The ad was controversial even before its premiere; prior to the game, Super Bowl LI's broadcaster Fox rejected a version of the ad that contained the border wall scene, as they felt the imagery was too politically-sensitive (newly instated U.S. President Donald Trump promised the construction of a wall along the entire Mexico–United States border). The ad was aired in an edited form during the game's halftime break, which excluded the ending and instructed viewers to watch the full, nearly six-minute film, on 84 Lumber's website (which briefly crashed due to the influx of visitors). === Philanthropy === 84 Lumber serves the communities in which they are located by participating in local events and fundraisers. Dedicated to helping those in need, the company has created a campaign, Building Hope, which fulfills this commitment. The Boy Scouts, Justin Jennings Foundation, Habitat for Humanity, Musicians' Village, Red Cross, and United Way are among the organizations and individuals 84 Lumber has supported over the years. In 2019, 84 Lumber gave a total of $1.39 million in charitable donations. The same year, the company launched a national partnership with the Fisher House Foundation to show its continued support for military veterans and their families. In May 2019, the company provided $25,000 to Friends of the Pittsburgh Fisher House, and an additional $500,000 donation for the Fisher House Foundation to continue to build new houses, similar to the one underway in New Orleans. The company continues to support local and national nonprofit organizations, including making a half million dollar donation to the Pittsburgh Community Food Bank in 2020 to help its community during the coronavirus pandemic. === Training & Recruitment === 84 Lumber has long been innovative in nurturing talent from within, as it conducts a number of internal programs aimed at fostering job advancement and career development at the company. This includes the company’s “Lumber Camps” where all new employees are brought to corporate team headquarters to attend an immersive training about the company and all-things lumber and home building. 84 Lumber has entry level “Manager Trainee” positions at each of its stores, providing opportunity for growth into other positions in both the stores and at Team Headquarters, including management, sales and operations. The program ensures on-the-job training, even for those with no prior experience, allowing anyone to work their way “up the ladder.” Company President Maggie Hardy Knox as well as COO Frank Cicero both completed the Manager Trainee program themselves. === Veteran Support === As a military Veteran himself, 84 Lumber Founder Joe Hardy has been a tireless supporter of service veterans, and his efforts are continued today through Maggie Hardy Knox’s leadership. The company is a major partner of the Fisher House Foundation, which provides temporary housing for friends and family of those being cared for at a nearby VA hospital. As of June 2020, 84 Lumber has donated more than $1.1 million to the Foundation.

For the Chinese holding company, please see Hangzhou Wahaha Group The Wahaha Joint Venture Company is a food and beverage joint venture company established between the Hangzhou Wahaha Group, the largest beverage producer in China, and Danone, one of the world's largest food conglomerates. The companies have been partners since 1996 in a business model Forbes magazine hailed as a \\"showcase\\" joint venture. As the businesses expanded and became more complex, Danone had made several attempts to buy out Wahaha, but was rebuffed. Danone and Wahaha's General Manager Zong Qinghou signed a deal in December 2006, allowing Danone to buy a majority stake in the non-JV operations. However, Zong had second thoughts about the deal and reneged, claiming the offer was underpriced. It is alleged that he wanted to squeeze a higher price out of Danone. In a trademark dispute, Danone filed for arbitration in Stockholm on 9 May 2007. Danone took further legal action by filing a suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against Ever Maple Trading and Hangzhou Hongsheng Beverage Co Ltd on 4 June 2007, companies controlled by Zong's wife and daughter. On 21 December 2007, Danone and the Chinese partner agreed to suspend their legal battle and resume negotiations. ==Background== Founded in 1987, Hangzhou Wahaha Group Co. Limited was originally a sales company owned by the government of Hangzhou's Shangcheng District. From its creation, Zong Qinghou has led and grown the business, exercising control over the day-to-day operations. In 1995, Peregrine Investments Holdings introduced Zong to Danone, and discussions about joint ventures began. A joint venture agreement was signed on 28 March 1996. Major parts of the drinks business were injected into the joint venture, and Zong became its chairman whilst remaining the managing director of the holding and operating companies. In the melée of the company's transformation from a state-owned enterprise to a private company, Zong became an important minority shareholder. ===Joint venture holding structure=== The foreign partners took 51%, while the Chinese partners held 49% (of which WHH holds 39% and employees own 10%). ====Foreign partners' holding structure==== Groupe Danone and Peregrine together invested US$70 million in return for the stake in five joint venture WHH companies. The holding was held through a Singapore registered entity called Jinjia Investments Co (金加投资公司), the board of which consisted of two Danone representatives, and Francis Leung Pak-to (梁伯韬) from Peregrine.合资公司达能取得控股权的缘由 \\"Wahaha communiqué: The truth behind the Wahaha dispute with Danone\\", Sina, 13 April 2007 In April 1998, just before the news of Peregrine's collapse broke, Leung was replaced on the board by a third representative from Danone. Although a transfer of shares in the WHH companies would have required State approval under the rules in force at the time for protecting state assets, the shares in Jinjia were not covered. When Peregrine collapsed, and transferred its Jinjia shares, Groupe Danone became majority owner. Zong has alleged that this transfer of ownership was a bad-faith takeover by stealth. ===Scope of joint venture=== On 28 March 1996, five joint venture companies were formed: * Hangzhou Wahaha Baili Foods 杭州娃哈哈百立食品有限公司 * Hangzhou Wahaha Health Foods Co 杭州娃哈哈保健食品有限公司 * Hangzhou Wahaha Foods Co 杭州娃哈哈食品有限公司 * Hangzhou Wahaha Beverages Co 杭州娃哈哈饮料有限公司 * Hangzhou Wahaha Quick Frozen Foods 杭州娃哈哈速冻食品有限公司 The business had grown into 39 joint venture entities by 2007, and the total injected capital amounts to US$131 million. In 2006, the turnover of the joint ventures contributed €100 million to the top line of Danone, and in excess of 5% of Danone's total net profit.另一张底牌 (another hidden card)Wahaha – atypical commercial dispute, Caijing, 185, 14 May 2007 ===Non-joint venture companies=== When the joint venture agreement was inked, five other WHH companies remained outside the scope of the joint venture. At the end of 2006, total non-joint venture companies reportedly had equity of ¥5.6 billion and profits of ¥1.04 billion. In December, Zong had agreed to sell these to Danone for ¥4 billion. The Hangzhou Wahaha Guangsheng Investment Co. (杭州娃哈哈广盛投资有限公司) (\\"GUANGSHENG\\") established in 2003 with registered capital of ¥50 million, is a key non-JV entity. Its shares were held by Zong and the union in a ratio of 60:40. Its capital was later increased to ¥80 million.

Its legal representative is Zong's daughter Zong Fuli. Zong set up non-jv owned factories, such as the Hangzhou Xiushan Shunfa Packaging Co. (杭州萧山顺发食品包装公司), to manufacture or pack products identical to WHH. Danone further alleges that dealers were asked to set up new bank accounts for their deposit payments in the name of WHHFBSC to sell products from these factories.达能：调查开始了 (Danone investigation begins) Wahaha – atypical commercial dispute, Caijing, 185, 14 May 2007 ===Trademarks=== The Wahaha trademark was assigned to the main joint venture vehicle on 29 February 1996, and a joint venture agreement was eventually signed on 28 March 1996. Danone insist that the joint venture agreement with valid and exclusive rights of production, distribution and sales of products under the Wahaha brand, for which Danone paid Hangzhou Wahaha Group the sum of RMB 100 million, including 50 million from the joint venture vehicle.商标权之争 (trademark dispute) Wahaha – atypical commercial dispute, Caijing, 185, 14 May 2007 Local government approval was obtained. However, WHH maintains that rules in force stipulate that trademark transfer agreements must be approved by the National Trademark Bureau, while local government powers are limited to a veto. The transfer was denied by the National Trademark Bureau according for the rule safeguarding national assets.娃哈哈与达能关于商标权纠纷的真相 Wahaha communiqué: The truth behind the Wahaha dispute with Danone, Sina, 13 April 2007 Although the regulations over the transfer of trademarks was apparently lifted in October 2001, the parties signed an additional contract in October 2005 covering the use of the trademark covering company names and products. ===Day to day management control=== Danone agreed to terms of joint venture which didn’t give it much involvement, allowing the day-to-day running of the company rested in the hands of Zong,Russell Flannery, How To Lose In China, Forbes, 18 June 2007. Retrieved 21 June 2007 while he continued in his autocratic ways. Zong has even boasted about the managers sent by Danone whom he had sent packing. Danone gave Mr. Zong room to move since \\"he operates in a very entrepreneurial way, making a lot of decisions on his own.\\" Up until just before the conflict became public, Zong was allowed to pursue his own commercial strategy through external ventures where Danone had no wish to be. However, Danone felt that it was time to claw back a stake in the external ventures. == Beginning of public row == Danone had made several attempts to buy out Zong, but was rebuffed. Danone and Zong signed a deal in December 2006, allowing Danone to buy out the non-JV operations. However, Zong had second thoughts about the deal and reneged, claims he could not carry his co-investors, according to The Wall Street Journal. Zong claims the offer was rejected as it was underpriced,Wahaha president accuses Danone of setting up disputed units, Forbes, 27 June 2007 and wanted to squeeze more out of Danone. On 3 April 2007, the war of words started with an article on Xinhua's website entitled \\"Wahaha victim of low- ball buyout by Danone\\" which stated that the board had rejected Danone's attempt at a \\"hostile takeover\\" of Wahaha for ¥4 billion. The article was written by a Xinhua journalist to whom Zong had given an \\"internal reference\\" document in the hopes of influencing political leaders on the fate of Wahaha.孤注一掷 (final throw) Wahaha – atypical commercial dispute, Caijing, 185, 14 May 2007 On 10 April, Danone issued a statement implying that Zong was in breach of his agreement with Danone by having entered into joint ventures with other partners with rights to use the brand. Zong had been accused of selling identical products using the Wahaha brand outside of the joint ventures, and Danone demanded a 51% stake in these. Danone sent a warning letter to Zong, in his capacity as the Chairman of the Wahaha joint ventures, giving 30 days for WHH to stop illegally selling products under Wahaha trademark without proper authorization. Zong said that Emmanuel Faber had personally authorised the setting up of the units outside the scope of the joint ventures. Danone concedes that in around 2003, it allowed Zong to become a minority partner in businesses that made Wahaha products outside their joint-venture structure, apparently because local governments often preferred to have Zong personally as a partner.James T. Areddy & Deborah Ball, Danone's China Strategy Is Set Back, The Wall Street Journal, Page A10, 15 June 2007 By 2005, Danone realized Zong controlled as many as 20 external businesses making drinks, and claims these represented approximately 25% of Wahaha products. Danone estimates that Zong had established in excess of 80 unauthorised companies using the WHH brandname between 2001 and 2006. Zong set up externally owned factories to produce products identical to WHH, and Danone alleges that dealers were asked to set up new bank accounts for their deposit payments in the name of WHHFBSC to sell products from these factories. Danone, which had apparently been relying on the WHH distribution network to sell Danone brand products, also found itself being the victim of mis-channelling. Since the dispute has erupted, distributors and employees have come out in support of Zong, calling for a boycott of Danone products.Wahaha Staff Boycott Danone Takeover Attempt, 15 April 2007, Shanghai DailyVivian Wai-yin Kwok, Danone's Chinese Food Fight Gets Messier, Forbes, 14 June 2007.

Zong resigned as Chairman of the joint ventures on 5 June 2007. However, WHH challenges whether the joint-ventures have title to the WHH brand. Application for arbitration of the dispute with Danone over the trademark had been made to the Hangzhou Arbitration Committee, and was accepted on 17 June.

This is manifested in Zong's nationalistic defense against Danone. Zong occasionally used expressions like \\"unequal treaties\\", which are a throwback to the colonial era. However, the Chinese press points out that Zong employs offshore tax havens, and that his daughter is a resident in the United States. The restrictions contained in contracts and regulations considerably cramped the entrepreneurial style of Zong, who complained of limits the control structure placed on him. \\"Most of the decisions had to be approved by Danone board members at board meetings once every quarter. How you want me to run the business under such conditions?\\" The self-made Chinese entrepreneur who refuses to back down, Agence France-Presse, Taipei Times, 8 July 2007, Page 12 The greater maturity in the company has made Zong feel he needs his foreign partner less.Chinese partners mature, rocking JV status quo, Reuters, 18 June 2007. Retrieved 14 July 2007 ====Marketing strategy/investment issues==== The differing marketing choices of the groups contributed to the conflict. Zong is resentful that Danone was happy just to sit back and collect money, and wanted to stop him from investing: \\"Whenever we wanted to expand the business, they said no. They refused to invest more. But they let us spend the money and then when the ventures made money they wanted in,\\" he says. Outside the joint venture structure were \\"a batch of companies which served the old impoverished areas of the west, and in the Three Gorges area. Danone had no desire to be there, but they turned out profitable\\". Future Cola was another example: Zong decided to proceed with the launch of a cola in 1998, against the express wishes of Danone. It was tolerated because Qin Peng defended the contribution it made to the joint venture's profits. ====Conflicts of interest==== Zong now controls a significant number of companies which make and sell products competing with the joint venture in its markets. Amongst others, Zong controls Hangzhou Xiushan Shunfa Packaging Co. which makes WHH branded products, and WHHFBSC, which is a parallel distribution company. Interpreting a clause in the JV agreement that the foreign partner must endeavour not to act in detriment to the interests of the JV, Zong is upset that Danone acquired sizeable stakes in many of its competitors, namely China Huiyuan Juice Group, Shenzhen Health Food, Bright Dairy & Food., and a 49% joint venture with Mengniu. WHH principally objects to Danone's role as owner since 2001 of its largest competitor, Guangdong Robust Group (乐百氏(广东)饮用水有限公司), which is a 92% owned subsidiary, and Shanghai Aquarius Drinking Water Ltd (上海正广和饮用水有限责任公司), in which it holds 50%.Wang Zhenghua, Firm plans lawsuit against Danone China Daily, 20 June.

An article published in Caijing in May 2007 hinted that there may have been impropriety: Profits were siphoned off into factories and other external ventures in breach of the joint venture agreement; shareholdings were shuffled around to the detriment of other shareholders.

August 28, 1860 Granton, Ontario— d. March 26, 1944 Hamiota, Manitoba) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1914 to 1922, as a member of the Liberal Party. The son of John McConnell and Catherine Delaney, McConnell was educated at common school in St. Mary's, Ontario. He first worked on a farm and then came to Manitoba in 1882. He acquired a homestead in the Hamiota area which he later sold to purchase property in Winnipeg. After eight years in the wood business, McConnell entered the lumber business at Hamiota. He worked as an implement agent, auctioneer, undertaker and real estate agent. In 1887, he married Minnie Ann Brown. During his political career, McConnell lived in Hamiota. In religion, he was a Presbyterian. He first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the 1899 provincial election, in the riding of Saskatchewan. He lost to Conservative candidate William Ferguson by fifteen votes. He ran again in the 1914 election, and defeated Ferguson by 398 votes in the renamed Hamiota constituency. The election was won by Rodmond Roblin's Conservatives, and McConnell sat in the legislature as a member of the opposition. The Roblin administration was forced to resign amid a serious corruption scandal in 1915. Another general election was held in August 1915, which the Liberals won with a landslide majority. McConnell was easily re-elected, and served in the legislature as a backbench supporter of Tobias Norris's government.

Cohen (June 15, 1918 – November 25, 2014) was a prominent American criminologist. He is known for his Subcultural Theory of delinquent urban gangs, including his influential book Delinquent Boys: Culture of the Gang. He has served as Vice President of the American Society of Criminology from 1984–1985 and in 1993 he received the society's Edwin H. Sutherland award. ==Work== Albert Cohen was a student of Talcott Parsons and wrote a Ph.D. under his inspiration. Parsons and Cohen continued to correspond also after Cohen left Harvard. In his 1955 work, Delinquent Boys: The Culture of the Gang, Cohen wrote about delinquent gangs and suggested in his theoretical discussion how such gangs attempted to \\"replace\\" society's common norms and values with their own sub-cultures. He proposed two basic ideologies, the first of which is called status frustration. Status frustration is directed mainly to the young people of lower classes. There is no parallel between their own social realities and the rest of society's promoted goals. They become frustrated at the disadvantages and inequalities that they face, and this leads to Cohen's second principle; reaction formation. Reaction formation is the reaction from status frustration, and the young men of the lower classes find themselves replacing their society's norms and values with alternative ones. I.e. instead of working hard being the common goal for respect, it may become a delinquent act like who commits the most vandalism to gain the respect. This provides the group with a sense of values and status which they cannot receive from the larger society. It is a process which allows the members of the groups to adapt to their own exclusion from society. Unlike Merton's strain theory, Cohen holds the view that the reaction to status frustration is a collective response rather than an individual one. This theory accounts for the increasing rates of non-utilitarian crime (vandalism, loitering and joyriding) in western societies. Although actions such as these do not provide monetary gain to the perpetrator, they come to hold value to members of the sub- culture. As such, becoming accessible means of achieving status and prestige among the individual's peer group. ==Personal history== Albert Cohen graduated from Harvard University with honors in sociology in 1948. ==References== Category:American criminologists Category:1918 births Category:Harvard University alumni Category:2014 deaths ","title":"Albert K.

It is a località of the comune of Frisanco, in the province of Pordenone.http://www.comune.frisanco.pn.it/ ==Geography== Casasola has only 40 inhabitants, compared to 450 at its peak in the 1850s. It lies in the Val Colvera. ==History== Casasola was founded in 1480 by Luca and Marco di Rosa (hence the root name Rosa which continues to be the family name of most of the families from Casasola) from the town of Maniago, approximately away. Luca was Marco's uncle and their purpose for moving (with their families) to the area at the base of Monte Raut was likely to make charcoal. They eventually built one large house with stone walls for their families and this house led to the naming of the village of Casasola, which means one house. No other houses were built for over 50 years and the first small church, in honour of St. Oswald, was built in 1580. By this date, the different Rosa families were being distinguished with surnames stemming from their location in the village or other characteristics. For example, the Rosa-Tezza came from a family of weavers (tezza). The Rosa-Bernardins named all their first born Bernardo. The Rosa-Del-Vecchio had an exceptionally old grandfather. There are numerous stories about happenings in the Val Colvera that are the same or similar to many other villages and regions. One interesting example is the Inquisition trials in 1648–50 claiming the existence of witches from the village of Poffabro who would perform their rituals in the \\"Plan di Malgustat\\" behind the peak of Monte Raut. Three local women were actually tried and sent to jail in Venice but fortunately were later found to be innocent. The current Church of San Oswaldo was begun in 1650 and expanded in 1730 and again a century later. The Campanile was started in 1772 and completed in 1779. By the 18th century most of the able men would travel to the Istria region to work as lumberjacks, attesting to the lack of paid work close to home and insufficient local resources to provide for the growing population. Casasola, while a small mountain village of little consequence,(except for its inhabitants) was affected by the flow of history as with all other villages and towns in Friuli. The French Revolution and Napoleon led to the end of the Venetian rule in the area and to battles in the region with the Habsburg Empire. The campaign for Italian unification during the 1850s and 1860s as well as the events of World War II divided families on both sides of the conflict but they eventually continued to live together once the main events were over. Much of the Italian campaign during World War I was fought in Friuli and the Austrian and German forces overran the region in 1917. The village changed dramatically after earthquakes devastated the Friuli region in May 1976. Many of the older homes were demolished and the remaining homes were modernized. The dwindling population also led to the closing of the school in the 1960s with the children being first sent to the school in Frisanco and then all the children from the Comune being sent to school in Maniago. Another landmark, the \\"bottega\\", (bar and small grocery store) was closed with the passing of Sante Rosa-del-Vecchio(b. 1926) in 2006. It has always been a village of emigrants with many former \\"Cjasasolins\\" living in the US, Canada, South America, France, Switzerland etc. File:Casasolacampanile.jpgThe Campanile, completed in 1779 File:CasasolaFontana2.jpgThe \\"laip\\" or fountain at one time the only source of water.

He worked six years in Budapest as an analytical chemist. He married Esther Klein in 1936. Being Jewish, the family had to escape from the Nazi persecution so Szekeres took a job in Shanghai, China. There they lived through World War II, the Japanese occupation and the beginnings of the Communist revolution. Their son, Peter, was born in Shanghai. ==Career== In 1948, he was offered a position at the University of Adelaide, Australia, that he gladly accepted. After all the troubles he had, he began flourishing as a mathematician. A few years later, his daughter Judy was born. In 1963, the family moved to Sydney, where Szekeres took a position at the University of New South Wales, and taught there until his retirement in 1975. He also devised problems for secondary school mathematical olympiads run by the university where he taught, and for a yearly undergraduate competition run by the Sydney University Mathematics Society. Szekeres worked closely with many prominent mathematicians throughout his life, including Paul Erdős, Esther Szekeres (née Esther Klein), Pál Turán, Béla Bollobás, Ronald Graham, Alf van der Poorten, Miklós Laczkovich, and John Coates. ==Honours== * In 1968 he was the winner of the Thomas Ranken Lyle Medal of the Australian Academy of Science. * In May 2001, a festschrift was held in honour of his ninetieth birthday at the University of New South Wales. * In January 2001 he was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal \\"for service to Australian society and science in pure mathematics\\". * In 2001, the Australian Mathematical Society created the George Szekeres Medal in his honour. * In June 2002, he was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) 'for service to mathematics and science, particularly as a contributor to education and research, to the support and development of the University of New South Wales Mathematics Competition and the Australian Mathematical Olympiad Team.' ==Personal life== The so-called Happy Ending problem is an example of how mathematics pervaded George's life. During 1933, George and several other students met frequently in Budapest to discuss mathematics. At one of these meetings, Esther Klein proposed the following problem: :Given five points in the plane in general position, prove that four of them form a convex quadrilateral. After allowing George, Paul Erdős, and the other students to scratch their heads for some time, Esther explained her proof.http://www.maa.org/mathland/mathtrek_10_3_00.html Subsequently, George and Paul wrote a paper (1935) that generalises this result; it is regarded as one of the foundational works in the field of combinatorial geometry. Erdős dubbed the original problem the \\"Happy Ending\\" problem because it resulted in George and Esther's marriage in 1937. George and Esther died within an hour of each other on 28 August 2005 in Adelaide, South Australia.Obituary, The Sydney Morning Herald ==See also== * Powerful number * Szekeres snark * Generalized continued fraction * Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates * Szekeres–Wilf number * Schröder's equation ==Notes== ==References== * Giles, J.

Perhaps because of the family tradition of maritime service, Tawney joined the Royal Navy at the age of sixteen, serving for thirteen years, several of which were spent in submarines. During this period he developed his lifelong interest in English traditional music. While still in the Navy in 1957, he performed on an Alan Lomax radio show broadcast on Christmas Day, Sing Christmas and the Turn of the Year. He appeared on television on the following Easter Sunday. It went well and soon he had a weekly television spot and a networked show, Watch Aboard. Encouraged by these successes, Cyril left the Navy early in 1959 to become a full-time professional musician and broadcaster. He earned his living in this way for 44 years, making him Britain's longest-standing professional folksinger. Tawney continued to work in broadcasting and had a weekly radio show, \\"Folkspin.\\" Meanwhile, he researched the traditional songs of southwest England and 20th Century Royal Navy songs. In the early 1960s he established his first folk club in Plymouth, where he met his wife Rosemary. He founded the West of England Folk Centre and was instrumental in setting up folk clubs in other places in the region. He is often referred to as the Founding Father of the West Country folk revival. His song The Oggie Man written in 1959, appeared on the album A Cold Wind Blows on the Elektra ’66 label. It reappeared in 1971 on the Decca Record Company Ltd album The World of Folk.The World of Folk, Decca Records, SPA-A 132 The song tells the story of the demise of the 'Oggie Man' from the Devonport Naval Dockyard, at a time when old- fashioned \\"fast food\\" was being replaced by the more modern purveyors of hot dogs (and all) (the \\"big boys\\" of the song). The Oggie Man had until that time offered his oggies (pasties) to sailors returning from sea, or from shore leave, from a box at the Albert Gate of the dock. It has been suggested that the sale of oggies here dated back to the 1700s.2002, Cyril Tawney on BBC Folkspan Program The first verse of \\"Oggie Man\\" runs > And the rain's softly falling and the Oggie man's no more. > I can't hear him calling like I used to before > I came through the gateway and I heard the sergeant say > \\"The big boys are a coming, see their stands across the way\\" > And the rains softly falling and the Oggie man's no more... In addition to presenting traditional ditties, Tawney composed a number of his own songs, the majority being written when he was in the Royal Navy and relating to that period – for example, Chicken on a Raft, which belongs to the call and response style of sea shanties. The song makes reference to an unpopular dish served in the Royal Navy, consisting of fried egg on fried bread and called \\"chicken on a raft.\\" The chorus is as follows: > Chicken on a raft on a Monday morning, > Oh, what a terrible sight to see, > The Dabtoes forrard and the dustmen aft, > Sittin' there a'pickin' at a chicken on a raft! The song was recorded by The Young Tradition, on their 1967 EP also titled Chicken on a Raft. Tawney's song, Sally Free And Easy, written in the late 1950s, was covered by numerous folk artists, including Carolyn Hester, Dorris Henderson and John Renbourn, Davey Graham, Pentangle, The Corries, Marianne Faithfull, Alan Stivell and Bob Dylan.The Guardian, Wednesday 27 April 2005, Obituaries: Cyril Tawney The song is about an affair Tawney had with a girl who cheated on him. > \\"... and when he was out in Gibraltar during the war, he was in the > submarine service and he had rather an unfortunate affair with a girl, who > two-timed him and her name was Sally and he wrote a song about it called > \\"Sally Free and Easy\\". – Roy Williamson, introducing the song on the album > \\"The Corries in Concert\\" Beginning in 1972, Tawney studied English and History at Lancaster University. After he graduated, he admitted to a master's degree from the Leeds University Institute of Dialect and Folklife Studies. In 1987, Tawney's book Grey Funnel Lines: Traditional Song and Verse of the Royal Navy 1900 to 1970, was published by Routledge. Tawney's last public performance was at Easter 2004, at the Lancaster Maritime Festival.

The aqueous phase may contain salt(s) and/or other ingredients, and the \\"oil\\" may actually be a complex mixture of different hydrocarbons and olefins. In contrast to ordinary emulsions, microemulsions form upon simple mixing of the components and do not require the high shear conditions generally used in the formation of ordinary emulsions. The three basic types of microemulsions are direct (oil dispersed in water, o/w), reversed (water dispersed in oil, w/o) and bicontinuous. In ternary systems such as microemulsions, where two immiscible phases (water and ‘oil’) are present with a surfactant, the surfactant molecules may form a monolayer at the interface between the oil and water, with the hydrophobic tails of the surfactant molecules dissolved in the oil phase and the hydrophilic head groups in the aqueous phase. ==Uses== Microemulsions have many commercially important uses: * Water-in-oil microemulsions for some dry cleaning processes * Floor polishers and cleaners * Personal care products * Pesticide formulations * Cutting oils * Drugs Much of the work done on these systems have been motivated by their possible use to mobilize petroleum trapped in porous sandstone for enhanced oil recovery. A fundamental reason for the uses of these systems is that a microemulsion phase sometimes has an ultralow interfacial tension with a separate oil or aqueous phase, which may release or mobilize them from solid phases even in conditions of slow flow or low pressure gradients. Microemulsions also have industrial applications, one of them being the synthesis of polymers. Microemulsion polymerization is a complex heterogeneous process where transport of monomers, free radicals and other species (such as chain transfer agent, co-surfactant and inhibitors) between the aqueous and organic phases, takes place.\\"A Microemulsion Process for Producing Acrylamide-Alkyl Acrylamide Copolymers\\", S. R. Turner, D. B. Siano and J. Bock, U. S. Patent No. 4,521,580, June 1985. Compared with other heterogeneous polymerization processes (suspension or emulsion) microemulsion polymerization is a more complicated system. Polymerization rate is controlled by monomer partitioning between the phases, particle nucleation, and adsorption and desorption of radicals. Particle stability is affected by the amount and type of surfactant and pH of dispersing medium.Ovando V.M. Polymer Bulletin 2005, 54, 129-140 It is also used in the process of creating nanoparticles. The kinetics of microemulsion polymerization has much in common with emulsion polymerization kinetics, the most characteristic feature of which is the compartmentalization, where the radicals growing inside the particles are separated from each other, thus suppressing termination to a high extent and, as a consequence, providing high rates of polymerization. ==Theory== Various theories concerning microemulsion formation, stability and phase behavior have been proposed over the years. For example, one explanation for their thermodynamic stability is that the oil/water dispersion is stabilized by the surfactant present and their formation involves the elastic properties of the surfactant film at the oil/water interface, which involves as parameters, the curvature and the rigidity of the film. These parameters may have an assumed or measured pressure and/or temperature dependence (and/or the salinity of the aqueous phase), which may be used to infer the region of stability of the microemulsion, or to delineate the region where three coexisting phases occur, for example. Calculations of the interfacial tension of the microemulsion with a coexisting oil or aqueous phase are also often of special focus and may sometimes be used to guide their formulation. ==History and terminology== The term microemulsion was first used by T. P. Hoar and J. H. Shulman, professors of chemistry at Cambridge University, in 1943. Alternative names for these systems are often used, such as transparent emulsion, swollen micelle, micellar solution, and solubilized oil. More confusingly still, the term microemulsion can refer to the single isotropic phase that is a mixture of oil, water and surfactant, or to one that is in equilibrium with coexisting predominantly oil and/or aqueous phases, or even to other non-isotropic phases. As in the binary systems (water/surfactant or oil/surfactant), self- assembled structures of different types can be formed, ranging, for example, from (inverted) spherical and cylindrical micelles to lamellar phases and bicontinuous microemulsions, which may coexist with predominantly oil or aqueous phases. T. P. Hoar et al., Nature, 1943, (152), 102-103. ==Phase diagrams== Microemulsion domains are usually characterized by constructing ternary-phase diagrams. Three components are the basic requirement to form a microemulsion: two immiscible liquids and a surfactant. The majority of microemulsions use oil and water as immiscible liquid pairs. If a cosurfactant is used, it may sometimes be represented at a fixed ratio to surfactant as a single component, and treated as a single \\"pseudo-component\\". The relative amounts of these three components can be represented in a ternary phase diagram. Gibbs phase diagrams can be used to show the influence of changes in the volume fractions of the different phases on the phase behavior of the system. The three components composing the system are each found at an apex of the triangle, where their corresponding volume fraction is 100%. Moving away from that corner reduces the volume fraction of that specific component and increases the volume fraction of one or both of the two other components. Each point within the triangle represents a possible composition of a mixture of the three components or pseudo-components, which may consist (ideally, according to the Gibbs' phase rule) of one, two or three phases. These points combine to form regions with boundaries between them, which represent the \\"phase behavior\\" of the system at constant temperature and pressure. The Gibbs phase diagram, however, is an empirical visual observation of the state of the system and may, or may not express the true number of phases within a given composition. Apparently clear single phase formulations can still consist of multiple iso-tropic phases (e.g. the apparently clear heptane/AOT/water microemulsions consist multiple phases). Since these systems can be in equilibrium with other phases, many systems, especially those with high volume fractions of both the two imiscible phases, can be easily destabilised by anything that changes this equilibrium e.g. high or low temperature or addition of surface tension modifying agents. However, examples of relatively stable microemulsions can be found. It is believed that the mechanism for removing acid build up in car engine oils involves low water phase volume, water-in-oil (w/o) microemulsions. Theoretically, transport of the aqueous acid droplets through the engine oil to microdispersed calcium carbonate particles in the oil should be most efficient when the aqueous droplets are small enough to transport a single hydrogen ion (the smaller the droplets, the greater the number of acid water droplets, the faster the neutralisation). Such microemulsions are probably very stable across a reasonably wide range of elevated temperatures. ==Notes== ==References== *Prince, Leon M., Microemulsions in Theory and Practice Academic Press (1977) . *Rosano, Henri L and Clausse, Marc, eds., Microemulsion Systems (Surfactant Science Series) Marcel Dekker, Inc.

A. H. M. Jones, Constantine and the Conversion of Europe (New York 1962) 211. (Constantine I the Great. The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium. Edited by Alexander P. Kazhdan.) Constantine either took her as a concubine or married her in 303 AD, and the couple had one son, Crispus. == Life == Constantine served as a hostage in the court of Eastern Roman Emperor Diocletian in Nicomedia, thus securing the loyalty of his father Constantius Chlorus, Caesar of the Western Roman Empire. When Constantine wanted to strengthen his bonds with the other Tetrarchs, in 307 AD he set aside Minervina and married Fausta, daughter of Augustus Maximian. The marriage of Constantine to Fausta has caused modern historians to question the status of his relation to Minervina and Crispus. If Minervina was his legitimate wife, Constantine would have needed to secure a divorce before marrying Fausta. This would have required an official written order signed by Constantine himself, but no such order is mentioned by contemporary sources. This silence in the sources has led many historians to conclude that the relationship between Constantine and Minervina was informal and to assume her to have been an unofficial lover. However, Minervina may have already been dead by 307. A widowed Constantine would need no divorce. Neither the true nature of the relationship between Constantine and Minervina nor the reason Crispus came under the protection of his father will ever probably be known. The offspring of an illegitimate affair could have caused dynastical problems and would likely be dismissed, but Crispus was raised by his father in Gaul. This can be seen as evidence of a loving and public relationship between Constantine and Minervina which gave him a reason to protect her son. The story of Minervina is quite similar to that of Constantine's mother Helena. Constantine's father later had to divorce her for political reasons, specifically, to marry Flavia Maximiana Theodora, the daughter of Maximian, in order to secure his alliance with his new father-in- law. Constantine in turn may have had to put aside Minervina in order to secure an alliance with the same man. Constantius did not however dismiss Constantine as his son, and perhaps Constantine chose to follow the example of his father. Whatever the reason, Constantine kept Crispus at his side. Surviving sources are unanimous in declaring him a loving, trusting and protective father to his first son. Constantine even entrusted his education to Lactantius, among the most important Christian teachers of that time, who probably started teaching Crispus before 317. == Citations == == References == * Pohlsander, Hans, \\"Constantine I (306 – 337 A.D.)\\", De Imperatoribus Romanis site.

It is an isomer of benzene, specifically a valence isomer. Prismane is far less stable than benzene. The carbon (and hydrogen) atoms of the prismane molecule are arranged in the shape of a six-atom triangular prism—this compound is the parent and simplest member of the prismanes class of molecules. Albert Ladenburg proposed this structure for the compound now known as benzene. The compound was not synthesized until 1973. ==History== In the mid 19th century, investigators proposed several possible structures for benzene which were consistent with its empirical formula, C6H6, which had been determined by combustion analysis. The first, which was proposed by Kekulé in 1865, later proved to be closest to the true structure of benzene. This structure inspired several others to propose structures that were consistent with benzene's empirical formula; for example, Ladenburg proposed prismane, Dewar proposed Dewar benzene, and Koerner and Claus proposed Claus' benzene. Some of these structures would be synthesized in the following years. Prismane, like the other proposed structures for benzene, is still often cited in the literature, because it is part of the historical struggle toward understanding the mesomeric structures and resonance of benzene. Some computational chemists still research the differences between the possible isomers of C6H6. ==Properties== Prismane is a colourless liquid at room temperature. The deviation of the carbon-carbon bond angle from 109° to 60° in a triangle leads to a high ring strain, reminiscent of that of cyclopropane but greater. The compound is explosive, which is unusual for a hydrocarbon. Due to this ring strain, the bonds have a low bond energy and break at a low activation energy, which makes synthesis of the molecule difficult; Woodward and Hoffmann noted that prismane's thermal rearrangement to benzene is symmetry-forbidden, comparing it to \\"an angry tiger unable to break out of a paper cage.\\" On account of its strain energy and the aromatic stabilization of benzene, the molecule is estimated to be 90 kcal/mole less stable than benzene, but the activation of this highly exothermic transformation is a surprisingly high 33 kcal/mol, making it persistent at room temperature. The substituted derivative hexamethylprismane (in which all six hydrogens are substituted by methyl groups) has a higher stability, and was synthesized by rearrangement reactions in 1966. ==Synthesis== Synthesis of Prismane: The synthesis starts from benzvalene (1) and 4-phenyltriazolidone (2), which is a strong dienophile. The reaction is a stepwise Diels-Alder like reaction, forming a carbocation as intermediate. The adduct (3) is then hydrolyzed under basic conditions and afterwards transformed into a copper(II) chloride derivative with acidic copper(II) chloride. Neutralized with a strong base, the azo compound (5) could be crystallized with 65% yield. The last step is a photolysis of the azo compound. This photolysis leads to a biradical which forms prismane (6) and nitrogen with a yield of less than 10%. The compound was isolated by preparative gas chromatography. ==See also== * Prismane C8, a C8 allotrope of carbon *Cubane ==References== ==External links== * Molecules with silly or unusual Names Category:Hydrocarbons Category:Molecular geometry Category:Tetracyclic compounds Category:Cyclobutanes Category:Cyclopropanes ","title":"Prismane"},{"id":"2563319","text":"Exchange bias or exchange anisotropy occurs in bilayers (or multilayers) of magnetic materials where the hard magnetization behavior of an antiferromagnetic thin film causes a shift in the soft magnetization curve of a ferromagnetic film. The exchange bias phenomenon is of tremendous utility in magnetic recording, where it is used to pin the state of the readback heads of hard disk drives at exactly their point of maximum sensitivity; hence the term \\"bias.\\" ==Fundamental science== Easy-axis magnetization curves of a) a soft ferromagnetic film; b) an antiferromagnetic film and c) an exchange-biased bilayer consisting of a ferromagnet and an antiferromagnet. The susceptibility (slope) of the antiferromagnetic's magnetization curve is exaggerated for clarity. The essential physics underlying the phenomenon is the exchange interaction between the antiferromagnet and ferromagnet at their interface. Since antiferromagnets have a small or no net magnetization, their spin orientation is only weakly influenced by an externally applied magnetic field. A soft ferromagnetic film which is strongly exchange-coupled to the antiferromagnet will have its interfacial spins pinned. Reversal of the ferromagnet's moment will have an added energetic cost corresponding to the energy necessary to create a Néel domain wall within the antiferromagnetic film. The added energy term implies a shift in the switching field of the ferromagnet. Thus the magnetization curve of an exchange-biased ferromagnetic film looks like that of the normal ferromagnet except that is shifted away from the H=0 axis by an amount Hb. In most well-studied ferromagnet/antiferromagnet bilayers, the Curie temperature of the ferromagnet is larger than the Néel temperature TN of the antiferromagnet. This inequality means that the direction of the exchange bias can be set by cooling through TN in the presence of an applied magnetic field. The moment of the magnetically ordered ferromagnet will apply an effective field to the antiferromagnet as it orders, breaking the symmetry and influencing the formation of domains. The exchange bias effect is attributed to a ferromagnetic unidirectional anisotropy formed at the interface between different magnetic phases. Generally, the process of field cooling from higher temperature is used to obtain ferromagnetic unidirectional anisotropy in different exchange bias systems. In 2011, a large exchange bias has been realized after zero-field cooling from an unmagnetized state, which was attributed to the newly formed interface between different magnetic phases during the initial magnetization process. Exchange anisotropy has long been poorly understood due to the difficulty of studying the dynamics of domain walls in thin antiferromagnetic films. A naive approach to the problem would suggest the following expression for energy per unit area: E = \\\\frac{1}{2} n J_{ex} S_F S_{AF} + M_F t_F H where n is the number of interfacial spins interactions per unit area, Jex is the exchange constant at the interface, S refers to the spin vector, M refers to the magnetization, t refers to film thickness and H is the external field. The subscript F describes the properties of the ferromagnet and AF to the antiferromagnet. The expression omits magnetocrystalline anisotropy, which is unaffected by the presence of the antiferromagnet. At the switching field of the ferromagnet, the pinning energy represented by the first term and the Zeeman dipole coupling represented by the second term will exactly balance. The equation then predicts that the exchange bias shift Hb will be given by the expression H_b = \\\\frac{n J_{ex} S_F S_{AF}}{2 M_F t_F} Many experimental findings regarding the exchange bias contradict this simple model. For example, the magnitude of measured Hb values is typically 100 times less than that predicted by the equation for reasonable values of the parameters. The amount of hysteresis shift Hb is not correlated with the density n of uncompensated spins in the plane of the antiferromagnet that appears at the interface. In addition, the exchange bias effect tends to be smaller in epitaxial bilayers than in polycrystalline ones, suggesting an important role for defects. In recent years progress in fundamental understanding has been made via synchrotron radiation based element-specific magnetic linear dichroism experiments that can image antiferromagnetic domains and frequency- dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements that can probe the dynamics. Experiments on the Fe/FeF2 and Fe/MnF2 model systems have been particularly fruitful. ==Technological impact== Exchange bias was initially used to stabilize the magnetization of soft ferromagnetic layers in readback heads based on the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) effect. Without the stabilization, the magnetic domain state of the head could be unpredictable, leading to reliability problems. Currently exchange bias is used to pin the harder reference layer in spin valve readback heads and MRAM memory circuits that utilize the giant magnetoresistance or magnetic tunneling effect. Similarly the most advanced disk media are antiferromagnetically coupled, making use of interfacial exchange to effectively increase the stability of small magnetic particles whose behavior would otherwise be superparamagnetic. Desirable properties for an exchange bias material include a high Néel temperature, a large magnetocrystalline anisotropy and good chemical and structural compatibility with NiFe and Co, the most important ferromagnetic films. The most technologically significant exchange bias materials have been the rocksalt-structure antiferromagnetic oxides like NiO, CoO and their alloys and the rocksalt-structure intermetallics like FeMn, NiMn, IrMn and their alloys. ==History== Exchange anisotropy was discovered by Meiklejohn and Bean of General Electric in 1956. The first commercial device to employ the exchange bias was IBM's anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) disk drive recording head, which was based on a design by Hunt in the 1970s but which didn't fully displace the inductive readback head until the early 1990s. By the mid-1990s, the spin valve head using an exchange-bias layer was well on its way to displacing the AMR head. ==References== * * S. Chikazumi and S. H.

It is located on the southern side of the Hari River, at an altitude of 2,230 m above sea level. Chaghcharan is linked by a long highway with Herat to the west, and a long highway with Kabul to the east. The town is served by Chaghcharan Airport. Chaghcharan has a population of about 15,000 who are mostly Dari speakers. However the recent data showed a population of 31,266 (in 2015). it has 1 district and a total land area of 2,614 Hectares. The total number of dwellings in this city are 3,474. ==History== ===Medieval=== The Minaret of Jam built by the Ghurid Dynasty Prior to the arrival of Islam the region's inhabitants practiced various different religions including Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism. The Islamic conquest of Afghanistan by Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni took place in the 10th century. After the defeat of the Ghaznavids in the 12th century the area came under the control of the local Ghurid dynasty of Ghor. The Ghurid Dynasty had its summer capital, Firozkoh nearby and they constructed the Minaret of Jam there. Today the Minaret of Jam is a UNESCO World Heritage site. In the 13th century, the Ghor region was invaded by the Mongol army who destroyed Firozkoh but left the Minaret of Jam intact. It was then ruled by the Ilkhanate until Timur conquered it in the 14th century. Chakhcherān is mentioned by name in the 16th century Baburnama, describing Babur's visit in early 1507 while on his journey to Kabul. It was a town located in the Gharjistan region, between Herat, Ghor, and Ghazni. ===Modern Era=== A Lithuanian medic visits a patient in Chaghcharan hospital. In 2004, an independent FM radio station (Persian: راديو صداي صلح or Voice of Peace Radio) came on air in the town, the first independent media in this part of Afghanistan. In June 2005, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) established a Lithuanian led Provincial Reconstruction Team in which Croatian, Danish, American, Ukrainian, Icelandic, and Georgian troops also served. On 14 May 2020, the Taliban attacked a checkpoint in Chaghcharan, killing three Afghan soldiers and taking 11 others captive. ==Demography== Approximately 15,000 people live in the town, making it the largest in the province. However this city population is estimated to be 31,266 in 2015. The main inhabitants of Chaghcharan are Aimaq, Hazaras and Tajiks. Tajiks are living in Marghab District. ==Land Use== Chaghcharan (Ferozkoh) is located at the central region of Afghanistan connected by a highway 380 km West to Herat and about the same East to Kabul. Ferozkoh is an ancient city that date back to Genghis Khan and Mongols. Ferozkoh is famous for agriculture and animal husbandry. ==Transportation== As of August 2015, Chaghcharan Airport, located northwest of the Hari River, one mile northeast of Chaghcharan, had regularly scheduled flights to Kabul and Herat. However, as of January 2016 commercial operators no longer offer scheduled flights, leaving the United Nations Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) as the only user of Chaghcharan Airport with flights to Kabul and Herat. The main road from Changhcharan runs toward Herat in the west and Kabul in the east. Due to severe weather, the road is often closed during winter and even in summer it can take three full days to drive from Chagcharan to Kabul. ==Economy== Agriculture and animal husbandry are the primary economic activities in Ghor Province.Ghor Province by Naval Postgraduate School, http://www.nps.edu/Programs/CCS/Ghor/Ghor.html ==Climate== Chaghcharan has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen Dsb), with snowy winters and warm, dry summers.

After befriending Jewish accountant Max Weinstein and discovering the wonders of their religion, Peter gets the idea of converting Chris to Judaism so he will be successful in life. Lois attempts to stop him, believing that success is not based on religion. \\"When You Wish Upon a Weinstein\\" was written by Ricky Blitt and directed by Dan Povenmire. A holdover from the second season's production run, the episode was intended to air in 2000, but Fox executives were concerned about its content, believing it could be interpreted as anti- Semitic, and did not allow it to air on television. Due to popular demand, it was instead first aired on Adult Swim in 2003. This episode features guest performances from Andrea Beutener, Mark Hamill, Phil LaMarr, Ed McMahon, Peter Riegert, Mary Scheer, Ben Stein, and Nicole Sullivan. ==Plot== Peter gives Lois's \\"rainy-day fund\\" to Jim Kaplan the scam artist selling volcano insurance. That night, Stewie breaks Meg's glasses because he hates being watched while he sleeps. Lois tells Peter that he needs to recover the money to buy their daughter a new pair of glasses. After hearing Quagmire and Cleveland talk about how men with Jewish-sounding names have helped them achieve financial success, Peter decides that he needs a Jew to handle his money in an elaborate musical number. When a Jewish man named Max Weinstein has car trouble outside the Griffin house, Peter takes it as a sign. After a foot chase, Peter pressures Max into helping him get the emergency money back, and he recovers the money from Kaplan. After inviting Max to dinner and accompanying him to a Reform synagogue, Peter comes to the conclusion that Chris would become smart and successful if he converted to Judaism. The two sneakily drive to Las Vegas for a quickie Bar Mitzvah. Lois learns of the Bar Mitzvah from Brian (by means of torturing him with a dog whistle), and borrows Quagmire's car. She arrives just in time to stop the ceremony, but the congregants, angry that Lois is apparently insulting their religion, attack the Griffins. The family escapes just in time, locking the synagogue's door using a large star of David and getting back home on a bus. Lois points out that one's success is not based upon religion, and Peter realizes the error of his ways and makes up to the family. However, as it turns out, the bus is full of nuns who, displeased that Peter strayed from Catholicism, attack the family with rulers. ==Cultural references== Peter's song, \\"I Need a Jew\\", is a parody of \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\". The scene where Lois tried to stop the Bar Mitzvah is a parody of the ending of The Graduate. ==Production== Phineas and Ferb co-creator Dan Povenmire directed the episode. \\"When You Wish Upon a Weinstein\\" was written by Ricky Blitt and directed by Dan Povenmire. In addition to the regular cast, voice actress Andrea Beutener, actor Mark Hamill, voice actor Phil LaMarr, actor Ed McMahon, actor Peter Riegert, actress Mary Scheer, actor Ben Stein, and voice actress Nicole Sullivan guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voices in the episode include Mike Barker, Ricky Blitt, Mike Henry, Danny Smith, and Wally Wingert.

It is now owned by the nonprofit Historic New England organization. The grounds are open to the public daily for free; an admission fee is required for the house. The estate was established in 1793 by Boston merchant Theodore Lyman on of grounds, and was the Lyman family's summer residence for over 150 years. It consisted originally of the mansion and its lawns, gardens, greenhouses, woodlands, a deer park, and a working farm. Today the grounds contain a number of specimen trees, a 600-foot (180 m) brick peach wall, and late 19th century rhododendrons and azaleas introduced by the Lyman family. The back lawn and peach wall Carriage house and a greenhouse. The fine Federal style mansion, of 24 rooms, was designed by Salem architect Samuel McIntire and completed in 1798. Its grand ballroom, with high ceiling, decorative frieze, large windows, and marble fireplace, was used for formal parties. A smaller oval room was used for family gatherings. McIntire's design was substantially altered during an expansion of the building in 1882 to designs by Richardson, Hartwell and Driver. The estate's first greenhouse was constructed before 1800 and is thought to be the oldest in the United States. The Grape House, built in 1804 to raise exotic fruits such as oranges, pineapples, and bananas, today houses extensive grape vines, grown from cuttings taken in 1870 from Hampton Court in England. The Camellia House was built around 1820 for cultivation of camellias, introduced to America via Europe in 1797 from coastal China, Japan, and Korea. Many of the Lyman camellias are more than 100 years old. The greenhouses are open to the public. In the 1960's, the Lyman family, after losing money to a declining textile industry, chose to sell portions of the estate. On October 4, 1962 the property was going to be sold to housing developers, but was instead sold to Bentley University for $365,000. It makes up most of the land that Bentley sits upon. The estate was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970 for its architecture and for its landscape design, which is remarkably rare for having retained much of its original 18th-century character. The estate was one of the filming locations for the 2019 Greta Gerwig film adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's \\"Little Women\\" url=https://www.boston.com/culture/entertainment/2019/12/24/little-women- filming-locations-massachusetts and the 1979 Merchant Ivory film adaptation of Henry James' novel The Europeans. ==See also== *Gore Place, another former Waltham country estate from the same period *Robert Treat Paine Estate, a former Lyman family estate just north of this one *List of National Historic Landmarks in Massachusetts *National Register of Historic Places listings in Waltham, Massachusetts ==Notes== ==External links== *Historic New England : The Lyman Estate *Historic New England: The Lyman Estate Greenhouses *Waltham Community: Lyman Estate *Functions at the Lyman Estate Category:Houses completed in 1793 Category:Houses in Waltham, Massachusetts Category:National Historic Landmarks in Massachusetts Category:Federal architecture in Massachusetts Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Waltham, Massachusetts Category:Historic New England Category:Buildings designed by Hartwell and Richardson ","title":"Lyman Estate"},{"id":"2563375","text":"The C330 model camera from the Kodak EasyShare series Kodak EasyShare is a sub brand of Eastman Kodak Company products identifying a consumer photography system of digital cameras, snapshot thermal printers, snapshot thermal printer docks, all-in-one inkjet printers, accessories, camera docks, software, and online print services. The brand was introduced in 2001. The brand is no longer applied to all-in-one inkjet printers (now branded \\"ESP\\") or online printing services (now simply \\"Kodak Gallery\\"). Thermal snapshot printers and printer docks product lines have been discontinued. In 2012, Kodak stopped manufacturing and selling all digital cameras and photo frames. ==EasyShare Digital Cameras== There are presently three EasyShare camera lines, \\"series\\", that separate the cameras into different classes: EasyShare Point and Shoot (C series), EasyShare Performance (Z series), and EasyShare Sleek & Stylish (M-Series). The original products to use the EasyShare brand were the DX3600 and DX3500 digital camera along with the EasyShare Camera Dock. Kodak EasyShare DX6490, introduced in 2003 === Kodak EasyShare DX-Series === The DX series cameras were the first EasyShare models released. It was originally a very basic point and shoot camera series, compatible with the original EasyShare Camera Dock. The CX series eventually replaced the lower-end DX models, and the newer DX-Series models had more advanced features and higher megapixel resolution and zoom features. The DX series is now discontinued; the higher-end DX Series models eventually became the Z-Series. Models in the DX series were the last Kodak consumer digital cameras to use CompactFlash external memory cards. Models include the DX3215, DX3500(2.2 MP, 38 mm zoom lens), DX3600 (2.2 MP, 35-70mm zoom lens), DX3900 (3.3 MP, 35–70 mm zoom lens), DX4330 (3.1 MP, 38–114 mm zoom lens), Kodak EasyShare DX4530(5.2 MP, 38-114mm zoom lens), DX4900 (4.1 MP, 35-70mm zoom lens), Kodak EasyShare DX6440 (4.23 MP, 33–132 mm zoom lens), Kodak EasyShare DX6490 (4.23 MP, 38–380 mm zoom lens), DX7440 (4.0 MP, 33–132 mm zoom lens), Kodak Zoom Digital Camera DX7590 (5.0 MP, 38–380 mm zoom lens) and the DX7630 (6.2 MP, 39–117 mm zoom lens). === Kodak EasyShare CX-Series === The CX series is now discontinued, replaced by the C series. The CX series grew out of the DX series. At the time, it was the range of the lowest-priced, most basic point and shoot cameras, typically with no more than a 3× optical zoom. === Kodak EasyShare C-Series === The C-series is Kodak's current line of lower-priced, point and shoot, entry-level digital cameras. Image:Kodak-EasyShare- CX6330-freigestellt.jpgKodak EasyShare CX6330 Image:Kodak EasyShare CX7530.jpgKodak EasyShare CX7530 === Kodak EasyShare Z-Series === The Z-series is the current high-zoom and performance-oriented range of consumer digital cameras, replacing the original DX series. Typically, Z-Series cameras have higher optical zooms than any other series. The highest optical zoom camera offered by Kodak is the Z990 with a 30X Optical Zoom. === Kodak EasyShare V-Series === The V-Series was another style-oriented range of consumer digital cameras, replacing the original LS series. V-Series had a number of innovations, such as dual-lens technology, first introduced with the V570. The V-Series line has now discontinued, superseded by higher-end M-Series cameras. === Kodak EasyShare P-Series === The P-Series was Kodak's \\"Performance\\" series intended to bring DSLR-like features to a consumer model. The series is now discontinued, superseded by higher-end Z-Series models. These were the only consumer models to leverage an external flash, with the exception of the Z980. === Kodak EasyShare-One Series === The EasyShare-One series were the first consumer Wi-Fi Digital Cameras, that used an SDIO card to automatically upload pictures in Wi-Fi hotspots. The EasyShare-One series is now discontinued. === Kodak EasyShare M-Series === The EasyShare were originally a blend between thinner point-and-shoot cameras (C series) and stylish cameras (V series), now positioned as \\"Sleek and Stylish\\" with the discontinuance of the V-Series. They are usually available in a variety of colors and generally have features not available in the C-Series line. To promote the M-Series, which features the exclusive share button for social network media sharing, Kodak announced their \\"So Kodak\\" marketing campaign. To appeal to young and socially connected consumers, the campaign features urban artists Drake, Pitbull, and Trey Songz. == EasyShare Digital Frames == === Kodak EasyShare SV-Series === Kodak EasyShare M575. The original line of digital frames that played pictures and videos (replaced by M-Series). === Kodak EasyShare EX-Series === The original line of digital frames that included the features of SV-Series frames but included wireless (Wi-Fi) capabilities (replaced by W-Series). === Kodak EasyShare M-Series === The M-series line of \\"multimedia\\" digital frames play pictures and videos. === Kodak EasyShare W-Series === The W-series line of \\"wireless\\" digital frames features Wi-Fi connectivity to a home computer or the internet. === Kodak EasyShare D-Series ===≠ The D-series line of \\"decor\\" digital frames allow mounting with any off-the-shelf standard 8x10 frame. === Kodak EasyShare S-Series === The S-series currently designates digital frames that are \\"cordless\\" in that they have a rechargeable battery allowing viewing without a power cable for several hours. There was a much older frame, the S510, that was not cordless and predated the P-Series. === Kodak EasyShare P-Series === The P-series line of digital frames stands for \\"Photo\\"; these frames can only be used for pictures and not multimedia. == Other products == The EasyShare brand also was incorporated with the original 5000-series all-in-one inkjet printers (superseded by the ESP line), thermal photo printers and printer docks (now discontinued), and camera docks. ==EasyShare Software== === EasyShare Software === Kodak EasyShare software is used to transfer and catalog images from EasyShare camera models and can also be used with existing images (in .gif, .png, .jpg, or .tiff format) and non-Kodak digital cameras. The most recent version of Kodak EasyShare software is version 8.3, which includes support for Windows 7. Included in the latest versions is the ability to upload pictures and videos to Facebook, YouTube and Kodak Gallery. Other features include the ability to rate, tag, and caption pictures (using industry tagging standards on the files themselves), online print ordering facilities, photo enhancement and alteration capabilities, and home printing page layout control. As of September 5, 2012, the software is no longer available for download from Kodak's support website. The updater component of the software is powered by BackWeb, which, though usually suspect for its spyware associations, is said to be benign in this case. In version 6 of EasyShare software, the Bonjour software component from Apple is installed for remote service discovery, but serves no useful purpose for older models; it can be removed using \\"Add & remove programs\\" without impeding functionality. === EasyShare Custom Creations === This software, powered by RocketLife, is now discontinued. It was a desktop application that allowed the user to create a personalized gift (ex. Photo Book) and burn the applicable files to a CD. Ordering and fulfillment was handled by dropping the CD off at a retailer. ==References== ==External links== *Official Kodak page for Easyshare cameras *Kodak.com Category:Photography articles needing expert attention Category:Products introduced in 2001 ","title":"Kodak EasyShare"},{"id":"2563385","text":"828 is a film format for still photography. Kodak introduced it in 1935, only a year after 135 film. 828 film was introduced with the Kodak Bantam, a consumer-level camera. Kodak Pony 828, Kodak's last 828 camera in the US.Kodak 828 Film With Tropical Packaging Example frame of 828 format Kodachrome slide film The 828 format uses the same basic film stock as 135 film (standard 35mm film), but the film lacks the sprocket holes of 135. The standard image format is 40 × 28 mm. This provides a 30% larger image compared to 135's standard 24 × 36 mm, yet on the same film stock. Because Kodak targeted 828 at a lower-end consumer market, the film was much shorter, at a standard 8 exposures per roll. 828 film originally had one perforation per frame, much like 126 film. Unlike 135 (a single-spool cartridge film) or 126 (a dual-spool cartridge film), 828 is a roll film format, like 120 film. Like 120, it has a backing paper and frames are registered through a colored window on the back of the camera (except on the original folding Bantams, where images were registered with an index hole). 828 cameras never achieved widespread popularity, and the format had a rather limited run. Kodak's last 828 cameras were the Pony 828 in the US, produced until 1959, and the Bantam Colorsnap 3 in the UK, produced until 1963. Kodak ceased production of 828 format film in 1985. The Traid Fotron, sold in the late 1960s, used 828 format film as well. However, the film was enclosed in a proprietary pop-in cartridge and so the consumer never actually saw the film; instead, they merely returned the entire cartridge to Traid for processing. Those wishing to photograph with an 828-format camera have few options. As of 2005, 828 film is available for purchase on the Internet; this film is probably respooled from bulk unperforated 35mm film. Another option is to use standard 135 film, with sprocket holes, and respool it with used 828 backing paper onto old spools. The effective image size will be reduced with this method as the perforations will intrude on the image area. Finally, as with other obsolete film types, 120 film can be cut (with backing paper) and respooled onto 828 spools. == See also == * Film format * List of color film systems * List of film formats == References == * Wallen, Brian L. \\"Cameras of Kodak's Golden Age\\".

He opened his account with the winning goal for Ipswich on 14 February 2006 against Crewe Alexandra, with the Tractor Boys going on to win the game 2–1. McDonald is primarily an attacking midfielder, although he can play in a more of a striker role. He spent a month on loan with Hartlepool United, scoring one goal the winner in a 2–1 win against AFC Bournemouth, before bring recalled due to an injury crisis at Ipswich, with Ipswich rejecting a bid for the player. ===Gillingham=== In May 2006 he signed for Gillingham on a two-year contract. On his debut for his new club in August 2006 he scored the winner in a 2–1 win over Huddersfield Town. ===Inverness Caledonian Thistle=== It was announced in July 2007 that, despite having a year left on his contract with the Kent club, McDonald had agreed terms for a move to Scottish Premier League side Inverness Caledonian Thistle. He scored in his first pre-season match for his new club, a 2–0 win over Qatar's U-21 team, on 11 July 2007. Following the arrival of Craig Brewster at the club, he was restricted to just substitute appearances and was on trial during January 2008, including Gillingham and Toronto FC. Although offered a contract by Toronto FC, he decided to stay at Inverness Caledonian Thistle until the end of the 2007–08 season. Despite having a year left on his contract it was cancelled by mutual consent in July 2008. ===Non league spells=== He then signed for Conference National side Rushden & Diamonds in July 2008. Having been transfer-listed, he signed for Grays Athletic on loan from 20 November 2008 until January 2009. However, McDonald failed to make an appearance in the Conference National and only made three appearances in the Conference League Cup, FA Trophy and Essex Senior Cup. McDonald was released by Rushden & Diamonds in January 2009, and was signed by Northwich Victoria on non-contract terms. He left Northwich Victoria after manager Steve King departed in February. This led to a short spell at Tooting & Mitcham United, which lasted until the end of the season. McDonald ended the 2009–10 season with 35 goals in 53 appearances in all competitions for Farnborough, earning himself a trial at Football League Championship side Swansea City. McDonald was denied a move to the club after a successful trial due to the two clubs being unable to agree a fee for the player as he had one year left on his contract. In June 2011, McDonald signed for Isthmian League Premier Division side Carshalton Athletic. The forward made 15 league appearances in his only season as a Robin and scored five league goals, including both in a 2–0 away win at Hastings United. On 25 January 2013 McDonald signed for Conference National side Macclesfield Town from Billericay Town,http://nonleague.pitchero.com/uncategorized/final- january-2013-moves-19899/ making his debut the following day in the fourth round of the FA Cup against Premier League team Wigan Athletic, coming on for 20 minutes. McDonald made his league debut on 1 February, coming on for the last 10 minutes against Ebbsfleet United to provide an assist for the 4th and final goal in a 4–0 win for the club. On 16 August 2013 McDonald signed for Conference South side Sutton United. In September 2013 McDonald signed a short-term deal with Billericay Town, and he went on to play for Margate and Whitehawk before the end of the 2013–14 season. In June 2014 it was announced that McDonald had signed for Dulwich Hamlet of the Isthmian League Premier Division.http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/dulwichhamlet/news/new-signings- announced-as-several-players-move-on-1240743.html After one season with Dulwich Hamlet, making 21 appearances and scoring 5 goals in all competitions, McDonald was released ahead of the 2015-16 campaign with Hamlet manager Gavin Rose commenting \\"Dean got too many injuries and we didn't feel we could give him another contract. But he is still a very talented player.\\" He continued to train with the club, however, and returned to the first team for their FA Cup first qualifying round win over Hampton & Richmond Borough on 12 September 2015, coming off the bench in the 78th minute. McDonald was once again released by Dulwich Hamlet towards the end of March 2016, with Hamlet manager Gavin Rose citing a lack of end product being behind the decision to let him go. On 5 July 2016, McDonald joined Isthmian League Premier Division side Merstham after his release from Dulwich Hamlet. McDonald was signed by former manager Steve King for the fifth time when he joined Welling United at the start of the 2018–19 season,https://www.wellingunited.com/player/dean- mcdonald/ but was released in October 2018.http://www.kentsportsnews.com/welling-united-3-1-gloucester- city-27-10-2018/ In May 2019 McDonald re-signed for one of his former clubs when he joined Whitehawk, but left before the season started. http://www.isthmian.co.uk/a-hawks-return-57136 ==ReferencesCategory:1986 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Lambeth Category:English footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Arsenal F.C. players Category:Ipswich Town F.C. players Category:Hartlepool United F.C. players Category:Gillingham F.C. players Category:Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C. players Category:Rushden & Diamonds F.C. players Category:Grays Athletic F.C. players Category:Northwich Victoria F.C. players Category:Tooting & Mitcham United F.C. players Category:Farnborough F.C. players Category:Carshalton Athletic F.C. players Category:Macclesfield Town F.C. players Category:Sutton United F.C. players Category:Billericay Town F.C. players Category:Margate F.C. players Category:Whitehawk F.C. players Category:Dulwich Hamlet F.C. players Category:Merstham F.C. players Category:Welling United F.C. players Category:Scottish Premier League players Category:English Football League players Category:National League (English football) players ","title":"Dean McDonald"},{"id":"2563445","text":"The Leighton House Museum is an art museum in the Holland Park area of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in west London. The building was the London home of painter Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton (1830-1896), who commissioned the architect and designer George Aitchison to build him a combined home and studio noted for its incorporation of tiles and other elements purchased in the Near East to build a magnificent Qa'a (room). The resulting building, completed 1866–95, on the privately owned Ilchester Estate, is now Grade II* listed. It is noted for its elaborate Orientalist and aesthetic interiors. ==The house== The museum has been open to the public since 1929. In 1958 the London County Council commemorated Leighton with a blue plaque at the museum. The museum was awarded the European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Award in 2012. It is open daily except Tuesdays, and is a companion museum to 18 Stafford Terrace, another Victorian artist's home in Kensington. The house's pseudo-Islamic court has featured as a set in various film and television programs, such as Nicholas Nickleby (2002), Brazil (1985), and an episode of the drama series Spooks, as well as the music video for the songs \\"Golden Brown\\" by The Stranglers and \\"Gold\\" by Spandau Ballet. ==Design and construction== The dome of the Arab Hall Tile work in the Arab Hall Aitchison designed the first part of the house (2 Holland Park Road, later renumbered as 12) in 1864, although Leighton was not granted a lease on the land until April 1866. Building commenced shortly afterwards, and the house, which cost £4500 , was ready for occupation by the end of the year. The building is of red Suffolk bricks with Caen Stone dressings in a restrained Classical style. The architect extended the building over 30 years; the first phase was only three windows wide. The main room was the first floor studio, facing north, originally 45 by 25 feet, with a large central window to provide plenty of light for painting. There was also a gallery at the east end, and a separate staircase for use by models. The house was extended to the east in 1869–70. Additionally, a major extension was made in 1877–79: the two-storey \\"Arab Hall,\\" built to house Leighton's collection of tiles collected during visits to the Middle East. According to Aitchison and Walter Crane, the design was based on the palace of La Zisa in Palermo. The 17th-century tiles are complemented by carved wooden lattice-work windows of the same period from Damascus. There are also large 16th-century Turkish tiles. The west wall has a wooden alcove with inset 14th-century tiles. The room also contains Victorian elements. The capitals of the smaller columns are by Sir Joseph Boehm, from Aitchison's designs. The capitals of the large columns, gilded and carved in the shape of birds, are by Randolph Caldecot. The mosaic frieze was designed by Walter Crane. The marble work was by George P. White. Elaborate decorative paintwork adorns the domed ceiling and in the centre of the floor there is a fountain. The tiles in the passage to the Arab Hall are by William de Morgan. In 1889 an additional winter studio was added to the building. The final addition by Aitchison was the top-lit picture gallery in 1895. After Leighton died in 1896, the contents of the house were sold, including at least one thousand of his own drawings, almost all of which were bought by the Fine Art Society. In 1927 Mrs Henry Perrin offered to pay for additional gallery space. The building was extended to the designs of Halsey Ricardo and the Perrin Galleries opened in 1929. This extension was in memory of Mrs Perrin's daughter Muriel Ida Perrin, an artist and sculptor who had trained at the Royal College of Art Bryon Parkin, The Arts and Crafts of Bushey Heath (Bushey Museum Trust, 2003), p. 12 and worked for the catalogue section of the Aircraft Manufacturing Company (Airco) during the First World War. ==Permanent collection== The End of the Quest (1921) by Frank Bernard Dicksee. The museum has on permanent display works of art by various members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, including John Everett Millais, Edward Burne-Jones and George Frederick Watts, as well as 81 oil paintings by Leighton himself. Some of the most notable oil paintings by Leighton in the collection are: * The Death of Brunelleschi – 1852 * Charles Edward Perugini – 1855 * A Noble Lady of Venice – c1865 * Hercules Wrestling with Death for the Body of Alcestes – 1869–71 * Clytemnestra from the Battlements of Argos Watches for the Beacon Fires Which Are to Announce the Return of Agamemnon – c1874 * Professor Giovanni Costa – 1878 * The Countess of Brownlow – c1878–79 * The Vestal – c1882-3 * Alexandra Sutherland Orr (née Leighton) – 1890 * And the sea gave up the dead which were in it – c1891–92 Self portrait of Leighton (1880) Other works by Leighton in the collection include: * 5 albums and sketchbooks of drawings and watercolours. * 27 watercolours. * 54 prints of Leighton's works. * 14 items of personal material including documents, personal mementos, embroideries, enamels and caricatures. * Several small scale sculptures including: Athlete Strangling a Python (1874) and Needless Alarms (1887). Works in the collection not by Leighton include: * Antonio Rossellino's carved and coloured relief: Madonna of the Candleabra, which had been in Leighton's collection, sold after his death and re-acquired by the Museum in 2006. * G.F. Watts portrait of Frederic Leighton. * Luke Fildes's still life and study for The Widower. * Sir Alfred Gilbert's original sketch model for Eros. In 2016 Leighton's famous painting Flaming June was loaned to the Museum, and was displayed in the studio in which it was created. ===Gallery of works in the permanent collection=== File:Frederic Leighton - A Boy Defending a Baby from an Eagle.jpgA Boy Defending a Baby from an Eagle, by Leighton, 1850–52, acquired by the museum prior to 1926 File:Frederic Leighton - Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna (color sketch).jpgOil Sketch for Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna, 1854, by Leighton, acquired by the museum 2011 File:Frederic Leighton-Orfeo ed Euridice-1864.jpgOrpheus & Eurydice, by Leighton, 1864, acquired by the museum 1960 File:Desdemona (Othello) by Frederic Leighton.jpgStudy for Desdemona, by Leighton, c.1888, presented to the museum 1947 File:Leighton, Frederic - Clytie - 1895–1896.jpgClytie, by Leighton his final work, 1895–96, acquired by the museum 2008 , ==Council arts strategy== The building is run by the Kensington and Chelsea Borough Council. In 2009 Nicholas Paget-Brown launched the Cultural Placemaking initiative as part of the Council's Arts and Culture Policy. He explained that the plan was to build on the work of Opera Holland Park and Leighton House Museum to develop a broader coherent strategy to encourage developers to consider the Council's creative and artistic ambitions when working on a development project. ==See also== *Holland Park Circle ==References== ==Sources== * * ==Further reading== * Volume 1, Volume 2 * *Robbins, Daniel.

It was owned by Dixons Retail (known currently as Dixons Carphone, formerly DSG International), the United Kingdom's largest consumer electronics retail group, and traded online through a dedicated retail website, which in addition to mobile phones also offered satellite navigation systems and broadband internet services. The brand was previously used for a chain of mobile phone retail stores, which were 60% owned by DSGi, and 40% owned by O2, the telecommunications company. At the time of The Link's retail store operation, O2 was a subsidiary of BT Group, but the network is now owned by Telefónica of Spain. In June 2006, the retail store network was taken over by O2; The Link's website, which remains owned by DSG, continued to trade independently of the stores. In September 2010, The Link website went offline, and ceased taking new orders, directing customers to visit the site of sister firm Currys;The Link closure message, as at September 2010 however, the site also provided details of customer service contacts, for prior customers of The Link. ==History== DSG International opened the first branch of The Link in October 1994, due to the demand for mobile phones and other communications products. DSG International also sells mobile phones in its Currys Digital (formerly Dixons) and Currys chains, but opened a separate chain to provide more capacity for the growth in mobile phone sales. By August 2005, there were 295 branches of The Link, spread across the United Kingdom. The Link's annual sales from 2004 to 2005 were £428 million. Nick Wood, who as managing director of The Link had overseen the unit's growth, was subsequently moved across DSGi, to take over the running of the then struggling chain Dixons. After substantially turning around the fortunes of Dixons, he was brought back to The Link to replace his own replacement, Elizabeth Fagan, after the comparatively poorer performance of The Link under her management. Wood quickly made his mark, applying an easier to understand commission structure, placing \\"live\\" models of phones in stores, and expanded the product range to include MP3 players and Satellite navigation systems. The Link also replaced their long running advertising campaign (featuring a specially rerecorded version of \\"Speak Easy\\" by Shed Seven) with new comedy sketches, featuring the Ken and Kenneth characters from The Fast Show, filmed inside the Waltham Cross store of The Link. A new logo was created, and the in store look was dramatically overhauled. \\"Music\\" was seen as the main focus of The Link from that point, according to Nick Wood, and he hoped that would turn the fortunes around. ==O2 buys out DSGi share== On 21 June 2006, DSGi sold their 60% share of The Link to O2 for £30 million. The deal included all of The Link's stores.BBC News - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5101016.stm O2's purchase of The Link meant that some stores were rebranded as O2, whilst non retained sites were sold to others. Overall, of the 295 Link stores, around half were rebranded as O2, with the majority of the remainder being sold to competing telecoms retailers such as Orange, T-Mobile, Phones 4U, and 3, with three in particular being able to expand their previously smaller store network significantly with a number of former Link sites. In some cases, such as the Bexleyheath Shopping Centre, O2 moved from their own previous site to the Link site, and released their previous store to another operator, in the case of Bexleyheath, this was 3. A small percentage of sites were closed or sold to non mobile phone related companies, such as Costa Coffee. The majority of Link staff in these stores remained employed by the new store owners, under Transfer of Undertakings (2006) United Kingdom regulations. ==Online only trading== By 31 January 2007, no branches of The Link remained open. TheLink.comhttp://www.thelink.com/ and TheLink.co.ukhttp://www.thelink.co.uk/ is still owned by DSGi, and following the closure of The Link stores, the websites continued selling pay monthly and pay as you go mobile phones on Orange, T-Mobile, Vodafone, Virgin Mobile and Three, as well as mobile broadband and mobile services. The Link also offered a range of portable consumer electronics, such as iPods, Sat Navs and Laptops, as well as LCD televisions; these products were available either as gift incentives with mobile phone contracts, or for separate purchase. In September 2010, The Link website went offline, and was replaced with a link to the Currys webpage. ==Competition== The Link's main competitors were Phones 4U, Carphone Warehouse and Dial-a-Phone, who offered a variety of networks to their customers. The Link also had competition from the networks' own shops, namely 3, O2, Orange, T-Mobile, Vodafone and Virgin Mobile, as well as prepay competition from the likes of Woolworths, Comet and Argos.

Reliability is a synonym for assurance, which is the term used by the ITU and ATM Forum. Reliable protocols typically incur more overhead than unreliable protocols, and as a result, function more slowly and with less scalability. This often is not an issue for unicast protocols, but it may become a problem for reliable multicast protocols. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the main protocol used on the Internet, is a reliable unicast protocol. UDP is an unreliable protocol and is often used in computer games, streaming media or in other situations where speed is an issue and some data loss may be tolerated because of the transitory nature of the data. Often, a reliable unicast protocol is also connection-oriented. For example, TCP is connection-oriented, with the virtual-circuit ID consisting of source and destination IP addresses and port numbers. However, some unreliable protocols are connection-oriented, such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode and Frame Relay. In addition, some connectionless protocols, such as IEEE 802.11, are reliable. ==History== Building on the packet switching concepts proposed by Donald Davies, the first communication protocol on the ARPANET was a reliable packet delivery procedure to connect its hosts via the 1822 interface. A host computer simply arranged the data in the correct packet format, inserted the address of the destination host computer, and sent the message across the interface to its connected Interface Message Processor (IMP). Once the message was delivered to the destination host, an acknowledgment was delivered to the sending host. If the network could not deliver the message, the IMP would send an error message back to the sending host. Meanwhile, the developers of CYCLADES and of ALOHAnet demonstrated that it was possible to build an effective computer network without providing reliable packet transmission. This lesson was later embraced by the designers of Ethernet. If a network does not guarantee packet delivery, then it becomes the host's responsibility to provide reliability by detecting and retransmitting lost packets. Subsequent experience on the ARPANET indicated that the network itself could not reliably detect all packet delivery failures, and this pushed responsibility for error detection onto the sending host in any case. This led to the development of the end-to-end principle, which is one of the Internet's fundamental design principles. ==Reliability properties== A reliable service is one that notifies the user if delivery fails, while an unreliable one does not notify the user if delivery fails. For example, Internet Protocol (IP) provides an unreliable service. Together, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and IP provide a reliable service, whereas User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and IP provide an unreliable one. In the context of distributed protocols, reliability properties specify the guarantees that the protocol provides with respect to the delivery of messages to the intended recipient(s). An example of a reliability property for a unicast protocol is \\"at least once\\", i.e. at least one copy of the message is guaranteed to be delivered to the recipient. Reliability properties for multicast protocols can be expressed on a per- recipient basis (simple reliability properties), or they may relate the fact of delivery or the order of delivery among the different recipients (strong reliability properties). In the context of multicast protocols, strong reliability properties express the guarantees that the protocol provides with respect to the delivery of messages to different recipients. An example of a strong reliability property is last copy recall, meaning that as long as at least a single copy of a message remains available at any of the recipients, every other recipient that does not fail eventually also receives a copy. Strong reliability properties such as this one typically require that messages are retransmitted or forwarded among the recipients. An example of a reliability property stronger than last copy recall is atomicity. The property states that if at least a single copy of a message has been delivered to a recipient, all other recipients will eventually receive a copy of the message. In other words, each message is always delivered to either all or none of the recipients. One of the most complex strong reliability properties is virtual synchrony. Reliable messaging is the concept of message passing across an unreliable infrastructure whilst being able to make certain guarantees about the successful transmission of the messages.W3C paper on reliable messaging For example, that if the message is delivered, it is delivered at most once, or that all messages successfully delivered arrive in a particular order. Reliable delivery can be contrasted with best-effort delivery, where there is no guarantee that messages will be delivered quickly, in order, or at all. ==Implementations== A reliable delivery protocol can be built on an unreliable protocol. An extremely common example is the layering of Transmission Control Protocol on the Internet Protocol, a combination known as TCP/IP. Strong reliability properties are offered by group communication systems (GCSs) such as IS-IS, Appia framework, Spread, JGroups or QuickSilver Scalable Multicast. The QuickSilver Properties Framework is a flexible platform that allows strong reliability properties to be expressed in a purely declarative manner, using a simple rule-based language, and automatically translated into a hierarchical protocol. One protocol that implements reliable messaging is WS- ReliableMessaging, which handles reliable delivery of SOAP messages.WS- ReliableMessaging specification (PDF) The ATM Service-Specific Coordination Function provides for transparent assured delivery with AAL5.Young-ki Hwang, et al., Service Specific Coordination Function for Transparent Assured Delivery with AAL5 (SSCF-TADAS), Military Communications Conference Proceedings, 1999. MILCOM 1999, vol.2, pages 878–882. ATM Forum, The User Network Interface (UNI), v. 3.1, , Prentice Hall PTR, 1995.ITU-T, B-ISDN ATM Adaptation Layer specification: Type 5 AAL, Recommendation I.363.5, International Telecommunication Union, 1998. IEEE 802.11 attempts to provide reliable service for all traffic. The sending station will resend a frame if the sending station doesn't receive an ACK frame within a predetermined period of time. ==Real-time systems== There is, however, a problem with the definition of reliability as \\"delivery or notification of failure\\" in real- time computing. In such systems, failure to deliver the real-time data will adversely affect the performance of the systems, and some systems, e.g. safety-critical, safety-involved, and some secure mission-critical systems, must be proved to perform at some specified minimum level. This, in turn, requires that a specified minimum reliability for the delivery of the critical data be met. Therefore, in these cases, it is only the delivery that matters; Notification of the failure to deliver does ameliorate the failure. In hard real-time systems, all data must be delivered by the deadline or it is considered a system failure. In firm real-time systems, late data is still valueless but the system can tolerate some amount of late or missing data.S., Schneider, G.,Pardo-Castellote, M., Hamilton. “Can Ethernet Be Real Time?”, Real-Time Innovations, Inc., 2001Dan Rubenstein, Jim Kurose, Don Towsley, ”Real-Time Reliable Multicast Using Proactive Forward Error Correction”, NOSSDAV ’98 There are a number of protocols that are capable of addressing real-time requirements for reliable delivery and timeliness: MIL-STD-1553B and STANAG 3910 are well-known examples of such timely and reliable protocols for avionic data buses. MIL-1553 uses a 1 Mbit/s shared media for the transmission of data and the control of these transmissions, and is widely used in federated military avionics systems. It uses a bus controller (BC) to command the connected remote terminals (RTs) to receive or transmit this data. The BC can, therefore, ensure that there will be no congestion, and transfers are always timely. The MIL-1553 protocol also allows for automatic retries that can still ensure timely delivery and increase the reliability above that of the physical layer. STANAG 3910, also known as EFABus in its use on the Eurofighter Typhoon, is, in effect, a version of MIL-1553 augmented with a 20 Mbit/s shared media bus for data transfers, retaining the 1 Mbit/s shared media bus for control purposes. The Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), the Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX), and Time Triggered Ethernet (TTEthernet) are examples of packet-switched networks protocols where the timeliness and reliability of data transfers can be assured by the network. AFDX and TTEthernet are also based on IEEE 802.3 Ethernet, though not entirely compatible with it. ATM uses connection-oriented virtual channels (VCs) which have fully deterministic paths through the network, and usage and network parameter control (UPC/NPC), which are implemented within the network, to limit the traffic on each VC separately. This allows the usage of the shared resources (switch buffers) in the network to be calculated from the parameters of the traffic to be carried in advance, i.e. at system design time. That they are implemented by the network means that these calculations remain valid even when other users of the network behave in unexpected ways, i.e. transmit more data than they are expected to. The calculated usages can then be compared with the capacities of these resources to show that, given the constraints on the routes and the bandwidths of these connections, the resource used for these transfers will never be over-subscribed. These transfers will therefore never be affected by congestion and there will be no losses due to this effect. Then, from the predicted maximum usages of the switch buffers, the maximum delay through the network can also be predicted. However, for the reliability and timeliness to be proved, and for the proofs to be tolerant of faults in and malicious actions by the equipment connected to the network, the calculations of these resource usages cannot be based on any parameters that are not actively enforced by the network, i.e. they cannot be based on what the sources of the traffic are expected to do or on statistical analyses of the traffic characteristics (see network calculus). AFDX uses frequency domain traffic policing or bandwidth allocation, that allows the traffic on each virtual link (VL) to be limited so that the requirements for shared resources can be predicted and congestion prevented so it can be proved not to affect the critical data.AFDX Tutorial, However, the techniques for predicting the resource requirements and proving that congestion is prevented are not part of the AFDX standard. TTEthernet provides the lowest possible latency in transferring data across such a network by using time-domain control methods – each time triggered transfer is scheduled at a specific time so that contention for shared resources is entirely controlled and thus the possibility of congestion is eliminated. The switches in the network enforce this timing to provide tolerance of faults in, and malicious actions on the part of, the other connected equipment. However, \\"synchronized local clocks are the fundamental prerequisite for time-triggered communication\\".Wilfried Steiner and Bruno Dutertre, SMT-Based Formal Verification of a TTEthernet Synchronization Function, S. Kowalewski and M. Roveri (Eds.), FMICS 2010, LNCS 6371, pp. 148–163, 2010. This is because the sources of critical data will have to have the same view of time as the switch, in order that they can transmit at the correct time and the switch will see this as correct. This also requires that the sequence with which a critical transfer is scheduled has to be predictable to both source and switch. This, in turn, will limit the transmission schedule to a highly deterministic one, e.g. the cyclic executive. However, low latency in transferring data over the bus or network does not necessarily translate into low transport delays between the application processes that source and sink this data. This is especially true where the transfers over the bus or network are cyclically scheduled (as is commonly the case with MIL-STD-1553B and STANAG 3910, and necessarily so with AFDX and TTEthernet) but the application processes are asynchronous, e.g. pre- emptively scheduled, or only plesiosynchronous with this schedule. In this case, the maximum delay and jitter will be twice the update rate for the cyclic transfer (transfers wait up to the update interval between release and transmission and again wait up to the update interval between delivery and use). With both AFDX and TTEthernet, there are additional functions required of the interfaces to the network for the transmission of critical data, etc., that make it difficult to use standard Ethernet interfaces, e.g. AFDX's Bandwidth Allocation Gap control, and TTEthernet's requirement for very close synchronization of the sources of time-triggered data. Other methods for control of the traffic in the network that would allow the use of such standard IEEE 802.3 network interfaces is a subject of current research.D. W.

It was formed in 1877 by artists who felt the National Academy of Design did not adequately meet their needs, and was too conservative. The group began meeting in 1874 at the home of Richard Watson Gilder and his wife Helena de Kay Gilder. In 1877 they formed the Society, and subsequently held annual art exhibitions. Helena de Kay Gilder, one of the founders, started the group after showing one painting at The National Academy of Design's annual show, where she was a student, and receiving a poor location within the show. Helena de Kay Gilder felt her paintings location reflected the academy's reluctance to accept new types of art. The group received public support from Clarence Cook, a writer and art critic who wrote for the Daily Tribune, as well as Helena de Kay Gilder's brother, Charles de Kay who was an art columnist and editor of The New York Times. Journalists played a large role in helping to organize the group and spread its message of being a liberal alternative to traditional artist groups. Some of the first members included sculptor Augustus Saint- Gaudens, whose work had been rejected from a National Academy exhibition in 1877; painters Walter Shirlaw, Robert Swain Gifford, Albert Pinkham Ryder, John La Farge, Julian Alden Weir, John Henry Twachtman, and Alexander Helwig Wyant; and designer and artist Louis Comfort Tiffany.

On July 30, 1971, at 15:29 PDT, while taking off from San Francisco bound for Tokyo, the aircraft struck approach lighting system structures located past the end of the runway, seriously injuring two passengers and sustaining significant damage. The crew continued the takeoff, flying out over the ocean and circling while dumping fuel, eventually returning for a landing in San Francisco. After coming to a stop, the crew ordered an emergency evacuation, during which 27 passengers were injured while exiting the aircraft, with eight of them suffering serious back injuries. The accident was investigated by the NTSB, which determined the probable cause was the pilot's use of incorrect takeoff reference speeds. The NTSB also found various procedural failures in the dissemination and retrieval of flight safety information, which contributed to the accident. ==Aircraft and crew== The Boeing 747-121, registration N747PA, manufacturing serial number 19639, first flew on April 11, 1969 and was delivered to Pan Am on October 3, 1970. It was the second 747 off Boeing's production line but wasn't delivered until nearly ten months after Pan Am's first 747 flight. Originally named Clipper America it had logged 2,900 hours of operation at the time of the accident. The flight crew of Flight 845 consisted of five (a captain, a first officer, a flight engineer, a relief flight engineer and a relief pilot). The captain was Calvin Y. Dyer, a 57-year-old resident of Redwood City, California, a pilot with 27,209 hours' flying experience, 868 of which were on the 747. The first officer was Paul E. Oakes, a 41-year-old resident of Reno, Nevada, with 10,568 hours' experience, 595 on the 747. The flight engineer was Winfree Horne, he was 57 years old and from Los Altos, California, he had 23,569 hours' flight experience, 168 on the 747. Second officer Wayne E. Sagar was the relief pilot he had 3,230 hours of flight experience, 456 on the 747. The relief flight engineer was Roderic E. Proctor, a 57-year-old resident of Palo Alto, California, he had 24,576 flight hours, 236 on the 747. On July 29, 1971, Dyer, Oakes, Horne, Sagar and Proctor had spent the whole day off-duty. They had also flown the initial Los Angeles to San Francisco leg of the flight. ==Accident history== Modern San Francisco airport diagram showing runway layout (in 1971 runway 28R was more than shorter)Comparing the 1971 runway orientations and lengths described in the NTSB report to the modern ones, only runway 28R has been significantly changed. (See p. 10, NTSB report.) Flight 845's crew had planned and calculated their takeoff for runway 28L, but discovered only after pushback that this runway had been closed hours earlier for maintenance,Crews were repairing a crack which appeared in the pavement that morning. and that the first of runway 01R, the preferential runway at that time,Due to noise abatement. had also been closed. After consulting with Pan Am flight dispatchers and the control tower, the crew decided to take off from runway 01R, shorter compared to 28L, with less favorable wind conditions.Runway 28L was long, and the wind was from the west at . (See NTSB report, p. 10.) Runway 01R was about long from its displaced threshold (from which point the takeoff was to start) to the end, which was the available takeoff length for Flight 845.Boeing 747 aircraft were not authorized to apply takeoff thrust before reaching the displaced threshold of runway 01R, to reduce jetblast effects on a nearby highway (see NTSB report). Because of various misunderstandings, the flight crew was erroneously informed the available takeoff length from the displaced threshold was , or longer than actually existed. Despite the shorter length, it was later determined that the aircraft could have taken off safely, had the proper procedures been followed. As the crew prepared for takeoff on the shorter runway, they selected 20 degrees of flaps instead of their originally planned 10 degree setting, but did not recalculate their takeoff reference speeds (V1, Vr and V2), which had been calculated for the lower flap setting, and were thus too high for their actual takeoff configuration. Consequently, these critical speeds were called late and the aircraft's takeoff roll was abnormally prolonged. In fact the first officer called Vr at instead of the planned because the end of the runway was \\"coming up at a very rapid speed.\\"The most critical reference speed is Vr, which is when the pilot flying (pilot manipulating the controls, in this flight the captain) \\"rotates\\" (lifts the aircraft's nose); if rotation is done too late in the takeoff roll, the climb will be delayed and obstruction clearance reduced. ==Damage== Diagram showing penetration of the Boeing 747's fuselage and tail by Approach Lighting System structures (from NTSB final report). Unable to attain sufficient altitude to clear obstructions at the end of the runway, the aircraft's aft fuselage, landing gear and other structures were damaged as it struck components of the approach lighting system (ALS) at over . Three lengths of angle iron up to penetrated the cabin, injuring two passengers. The right main under-body landing gear was forced up and into the fuselage, and the left under-body landing gear was ripped loose and remained dangling beneath the aircraft. Other systems damaged in the impact included Nos 1, 3, and 4 hydraulic systems, several wing and empennage control surfaces and their mechanisms, electrical systems including the antiskid control, and three of the evacuation slides. The flight proceeded out over the Pacific Ocean for one hour and 42 minutes to dump fuel in order to reduce weight for an emergency landing. During this time, damage to the aircraft was assessed and the injured treated by doctors on the passenger list. After dumping fuel, the aircraft returned to the airport. Emergency services were deployed and the plane landed on runway 28L. During landing, six tires on the under-wing landing gear failed. Reverse thrust functioned only on engine 4, so the aircraft slowly veered to the right, off the runway and came to a stop. The left under-wing landing gear caught fire, although this fire was extinguished by dirt once the plane veered off the runway.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl_wXfSwRzM After stopping, the aircraft slowly tilted backwards due to the missing body gear, which had been ripped off or disabled on takeoff. The aircraft came to rest on its tail with its nose elevated. Until this accident it was not known that the 747 would tilt backwards without the support of the main body gear. ==Injuries== There were no fatalities among the 218 passengers and crew aboard, but two passengers were seriously injured during the impact, and during the subsequent emergency evacuation twenty-seven more sustained injuries, eight of them serious. Rods of angle iron from the ALS structure penetrated the passenger compartment, injuring passengers in seats 47G (near amputation of left leg below the knee) and 48G (severe laceration and crushing of left upper arm). After landing, the aircraft veered off the runway on its damaged landing gear and came to a halt. Evacuation commenced from the front due to a failure to broadcast the evacuation order over the cabin address system (it was erroneously broadcast over the radio), the order being given by one of the flight crew exiting the cockpit and noticing that evacuation had not commenced. During this time, the aircraft settled aft, resting on its tail in a nose-up attitude. The four forward slides were unsafe for use due to the greater elevation and high winds. Most passengers evacuated from the rear six slides. Eight passengers using the forward slides sustained serious back injuries and were hospitalised. Other passengers suffered minor injuries such as abrasions and sprains. ==Investigation== The accident was investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which issued its final report on May 24, 1972. According to the NTSB, the Probable Cause of the accident was: > ... the pilot's use of incorrect takeoff reference speeds. This resulted > from a series of irregularities involving: (1) the collection and > dissemination of airport information; (2) aircraft dispatching; and (3) crew > management and discipline; which collectively rendered ineffective the air > carrier's operational control system. ==Aftermath== Final resting place of the aircraft, in Namyangju, South Korea, where it was converted into a restaurant.Subsequent to the accident, the aircraft was repaired and returned to service. N747PA was re-registered and leased to Air Zaïre as N747QC from 1973 until March 1975, when returned to Pan Am, where it was renamed Clipper Sea Lark, and then Clipper Juan T. Trippe in honor of the airline's founder. It remained with Pan Am until the airline ceased operations in 1991, and was transferred to Aeroposta, then briefly to Kabo Air of Nigeria, back to Aeroposta, and was finally cut into pieces in 1999 at Norton AFB in San Bernardino, California where it had been stored since at least 1997. The parts of the aircraft were shipped to Hopyeong, Namyangju, South Korea and reassembled, to serve as a restaurant for some time, until it closed down. After the restaurant shut down, there were petitions and campaigns from numerous aviation enthusiasts for museums or local governments to preserve the historical airplane.

It has been a part of Nowy Dwór Gdański County in Pomeranian Voivodeship since 1999; previously it was in Elbląg Voivodeship (1975-1998). ==Overview== Lighthouse in Krynica Morska Before 1793 the area was part of the Kingdom of Poland; from 1793-1945 Prussia (within Germany from 1871). The village was known as Kahlberg during that time. It was administered by the city of Gdańsk until 1842, and afterwards by the city of Elbląg. The settlement was first mentioned in 1424, and became a summer resort around 1840. When it came back under Polish rule after the Second World War, it was given the name Łysica (the Polish root łys- corresponding to the German kahl, meaning \\"bald\\"). In 1958 it was renamed Krynica Morska (Krynica is an obsolete, poetic term for \\"spring\\"; Morska meaning \\"of the sea\\", i.e., \\"sea spring\\" or \\"seaside spring\\") as opposition to the other famous Polish resort of Krynica. In 1991 three former villages, Krynica Morska, Nowa Karczma, and Przebrno of Gmina Sztutowo were united into a new gmina, Krynica Morska, which simultaneously was assigned the town status. Krynica Morska is the main tourist destination on the Vistula Spit. The administrative area of the town extends along most of the Polish part of the spit, up to the Russian border, also including a number of other localities such as Przebrno and Piaski (the latter being about from the border, which is not crossable at present). It has the smallest population of any urban commune (gmina) in Poland. Because of the inclusion of mainly rural areas of the spit within its boundaries, it has the lowest population density of any town (miasto) in Poland, with 11.74 persons/km². The Lighthouse in Krynica Morska was originally built in 1895. It was destroyed in 1945 after being mined by retreating German forces. A new lighthouse, now open to visitors, was built in 1951. Adjacent to it is a small cemetery with a monument to the Soviet soldiers killed in the explosion that destroyed the original building. ==Gallery== Wybrzeże - panoramio (3).jpgBeach in Krynica Morska Krynica Morska July 2013 18.JPGPort of Krynica Morska KrynicaMorskaUlicaGdańska.JPGGdańska street Teleexpressu 2 5.jpgHeritage architecture Krynica Morska, port morski nad Zalewem Wiślanym (HB20).jpg ==References== Category:Cities and towns in Pomeranian Voivodeship Category:Nowy Dwór Gdański County Category:West Prussia Category:Resorts in Poland ","title":"Krynica Morska"},{"id":"2563591","text":"Flood insurance denotes the specific insurance coverage against property loss from flooding. To determine risk factors for specific properties, insurers will often refer to topographical maps that denote lowlands, floodplains and floodways that are susceptible to flooding. ==In the United States== Flooding resulting from Hurricane Katrina Nationwide, only 20% of American homes at risk for floods are covered by flood insurance. Most private insurers do not insure against the peril of flood due to the prevalence of adverse selection, which is the purchase of insurance by persons most affected by the specific peril of flood. In traditional insurance, insurers use the economic law of large numbers to charge a relatively small fee to large numbers of people in order to pay the claims of the small numbers of claimants who have suffered a loss. Unfortunately, in flood insurance, the numbers of claimants is larger than the available number of persons interested in protecting their property from the peril, which means that most private insurers view the probability of generating a profit from providing flood insurance as being remote. However, there are insurers such as PURE, Chubb, AIG/Chartis, and Fireman's Fund that do provide privately written primary flood insurance for high value homes and The Natural Catastrophe Insurance Program underwritten by Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's which provides private primary flood insurance on both low value and high value buildings. In certain flood-prone areas, the federal government requires flood insurance to secure mortgage loans backed by federal agencies such as the FHA and VA. However, the program has never worked as insurance, because of adverse selection. It has never priced people out of living in very risky areas by charging an appropriate premium, instead, too few places are included in the must-insure category, and premiums are artificially low.\\"Floods, Tornadoes, Hurricanes, Wildfires, Earthquakes... Why We Don't Prepare. By Amanda Ripley. Time. 28 August 2006. The lack of flood insurance can be detrimental to many homeowners who may discover only after the damage has been done that their standard insurance policies do not cover flooding. Flooding is defined by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of two or more acres of normally dry land area or two or more properties (at least one of which is your property) from: Overflow of inland waters, unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source, and mudflows.http://www.fema.gov/pdf/nfip/manual200805/15pol.pdf This can be brought on by landslides, hurricanes, earthquakes, or other natural disasters that influence flooding, but while a homeowner may, for example, have earthquake coverage, that coverage may not cover floods as a result of earthquakes. Very few insurers in the US provide private market flood insurance coverage due to the hazard of flood typically being confined to a few areas. As a result, it is an unacceptable risk due to the inability to spread the risk to a wide enough population in order to absorb the potential catastrophic nature of the hazard. In response to this, the federal government created the National Flood Insurance Program in 1968.Property and Casualty Insurance, 3rd edition, 1991 The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) found that 33 percent of U.S. heads of household still hold the false belief that flood damage is covered by a standard homeowners policy. FEMA states that approximately 50% of low flood zone risk borrowers think they are ineligible and cannot buy flood insurance. Anyone residing in a community participating in the NFIP can buy flood insurance, even renters. However, unless one lives in a designated floodplain and is required under the terms of a mortgage to purchase flood insurance, flood insurance does not go into effect until 30 days after the policy is first purchased. Flooding as a result of Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Individuals who are eligible and who have mortgages on their homes are required by law to purchase a separate flood insurance policy through a private primary flood insurance company or through an insurance company that acts as a distributor for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Flood insurance may be available for residents of approximately 19,000 communities nationwide through the NFIP. Flood insurance may be available through private primary flood insurance carriers in any of the 19,000 communities participating in the NFIP as well as other communities that are not participating in the NFIP. In March 2016, TypTap Insurance became the first private market, admitted carrier in the state of Florida to offer non NFIP flood coverage to policyholders. After 2017 Hurricane Harvey, estimates of houses covered by flood insurance in the Texas resulting in over $30bn in property losses with only 40% of homes covered by flood insurance. ==In the United Kingdom== Usually, the British insurers require from clients living in Flood Risk Areas to flood-proof their homes or face much higher premiums and excesses (American English: deductible). ==In Canada== Looking toward Downtown thumb Historically, due to the rarity of flooding in Canada, it was the only Group of Eight member state not to offer some form of flood insurance. Partly in reaction to the 2013 Alberta floods, flood water protection offerings have been introduced as overland water protection or overland flood insurance. ==References== Insurance ","title":"Flood insurance"},{"id":"2563599","text":"The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is a program created by the Congress of the United States in 1968 through the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-448). U.S. Congress has the twofold purposes of the NFIP to share the risk of flood losses through flood insurance and to reduce flood damages by restricting floodplain development. The program enables property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance protection, administered by the government, against losses from flooding, and requires flood insurance for all loans or lines of credit that are secured by existing buildings, manufactured homes, or buildings under construction, that are located in the Special Flood Hazard Area in a community that participates in the NFIP. U.S. Congress limits the availability of National Flood Insurance to communities that adopt adequate land use and control measures with effective enforcement provisions to reduce flood damages by restricting development in areas exposed to flooding. This NFIP is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods. As of August 2017, the program insured about 5 million homes (down from about 5.5 million homes in April 2010), the majority of which are in Texas and Florida.Holladay JS, Schwartz JA. (2010). Flooding the Market: The Distributional Consequences of the NFIP. Institute for Policy Integrity. The cost of the insurance program was fully covered by its premiums until the end of 2004, but has had to steadily borrow funds since (primarily due to Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy), accumulating $25 billion of debt by August 2017. In October 2017, Congress cancelled $16 billion of NFIP debt, making it possible for the program to pay claims. The NFIP owes $20.525 billion to the U.S. as of December 2019.https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/R44593.pdf ==Floodplain definition== 1997 Red River Flood in Grand Forks, North Dakota was a 100-year flood Carrying capacity of floodway must be preserved so increase in 100-year flood is no more than one foot The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) defines the floodplain as the area that would be flooded by a base flood,44 C.F.R. § 9.4 which is \\"the flood which has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year\\". In this sense, a base flood is synonymous with a 100-year flood and a floodplain is synonymous with a special flood hazard area. This base flood \\"is used in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to indicate the minimum level of flooding to be used by a community in its floodplain management regulations.\\"44 CFR § 59.1 FEMA explains regulatory floodplains in some places including hills as \\"critical determinations are made by evaluating your community’s rainfall and river flow data, topography, wind velocity, tidal surge, flood control measures, building development (existing and planned) and community maps.\\" Scientists and engineers use statistical analysis of streamflow data to determine the likelihood of flood elevations. Theoretically a 100-year flood occurs once in 100 years and a 500-year flood once in 500 years. However, these expected flood elevations actually occur more or less often than expected. 44 CFR § 9.4 defines parts of the floodplain as follows: * Floodway means that portion of the floodplain which is effective in carrying flow, within which this carrying capacity must be preserved and where the flood hazard is generally highest, i.e., where water depths and velocities are the greatest. It is that area which provides for the discharge of the base flood so the cumulative increase in water surface elevation is no more than one foot. * Flood Fringe means that portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway (often referred to as “floodway fringe”). == Implementation == Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities and the federal government that states that if a community will adopt and enforce a floodplain management ordinance to reduce future flood risks to new construction in Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA), the federal government will make flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection against flood losses. The SFHAs and other risk premium zones applicable to each participating community are depicted on Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs). The Mitigation Division within FEMA manages the NFIP and oversees the floodplain management and mapping components of the Program. The intent was to reduce future flood damage through community floodplain management ordinances and provide protection for property owners against potential losses through an insurance mechanism that requires a premium to be paid for the protection. In 2003, the GAO found that repetitive- loss properties cost the program about $200 million annually.U.S. Government Accountability Office. (2003). Challenges Facing the National Flood Insurance Program Congress originally intended that operating expenses and flood insurance claims be paid for through the premiums collected for flood insurance policies.Wright, James M., The Nation's Response to Flood Disasters: A Historical Account. 1 Apr 2000. NFIP borrows from the U.S. Treasury for times when losses are heavy, and these loans are paid back with interest. Between 1978 and year-end 2014, the U.S. federal government has paid more than $51 billion in claims under the National Flood Insurance Program. == Amendments == The program was first amended by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, which made the purchase of flood insurance mandatory for the protection of property within SFHAs. In 1982, the Act was amended by the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA). The CBRA enacted a set of maps depicting the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS) in which federal flood insurance is unavailable for new or significantly improved structures. The National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 codified the Community Rating System (an incentive program that encourages communities to exceed the minimal federal requirements for development within floodplains) within the NFIP. The program was further amended by the Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004, with the goal of reducing \\"losses to properties for which repetitive flood insurance claim payments have been made.\\" The Biggert–Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (Biggert-Waters) modified the NFIP. At the conclusion of 2011, as Congress passed Biggert-Waters, the NFIP cumulative debt was over $17 billion. A core principle of Biggert-Waters was to change the NFIP premiums to match actuarial risk-based premiums that better reflected the expected losses and real risk of flooding. These changes included removing discounts to many policies which were being sold below actual actuarial risk targets and eliminating \\"grandfathering\\" of older rates. In January 2014, the United States Senate passed the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014. This bill changed the process used to alter subsidized premiums and reinstated grandfathering of lower rates; effectively delaying the increases in flood insurance premiums to obtain risk-based premiums under Biggert-Waters and spreading the cost of the lost premiums over all of the remaining policy holders. The National Flood Insurance Program was $24 billion in debt at the beginning of 2014 as a result of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Sandy. The passage of the HFIAA described above has concerned insurance and environmental observers that the delay in implementation of actuarial rates will leave taxpayers exposed to additional losses. == Floodplain status determination == === Letter of Map Amendment === Insufficient map topographic detail or accuracy can result in the unwarranted determination of Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). An application for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) uses an Elevation Certificate (prepared by a Registered Land Surveyor or Registered Professional Engineer) to ask FEMA to remove the flood insurance requirement on individual properties. ===Online Letter of map change=== FEMA's website \\"Change a Flood Zone Designation - Online Letter of Map Change\\" says homeowners and other interested parties may submit an Online Letter of Map Change (LOMC). FEMA says this can be used for property that was incorrectly included in a flood zone or if the addition of fill has elevated the property above the flood zone. Information on the property's location, legal description, and use of fill are required for FEMA to determine if the property is located in a flood zone. FEMA might request additional information. === Letter of Map Revision === For multiple properties or a larger area, an application for a Letter of Map Revision can be submitted when the landscape topography is different from that shown on the floodplain boundary and/or flood heights shown on the FIRM and the Flood Insurance Study. A Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F) is used when landscape topography is altered by humans, usually to increase the land elevation and remove land from the floodplain. A Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) and Conditional Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (CLOMR-F) are strongly advised as a mechanism to obtain FEMA feedback on the project before site changes are made, especially in light of the increasing attention on the nexus between the NFIP and the Endangered Species Act. 44 C.F.R. § 65.6(10) says \\"A revision of flood plain delineations based on topographic changes must demonstrate that any topographic changes have not resulted in a floodway encroachment.\\" ====Proposed encroachments==== FEMA says that justifiable encroachment within the floodplain might include “construction or modification of a bridge, culvert, levee, or similar measure”.44 C.F.R. § 72.1 The NFIP prohibits communities to issue variances \\"within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result\\".44 C.F.R. § 60.6(a)(1) However, a community may request FEMA's prior approval for a justifiable encroachment that would increase the base flood level. This community request must include seven required submittals such as a request for conditional approval of map change, an evaluation of alternatives, a request for revision of base flood elevation determination, and a request for floodway revision.44 C.F.R. § 65.12(a) All requests for revision of base flood elevations must include supporting data with \\"all the information FEMA needs to review and evaluate the request. This may involve the requestor’s performing new hydrologic and hydraulic analysis and delineation of new flood plain boundaries and floodways, as necessary.”44 C.F.R. § 65.6(a)(1) Details of the required supporting data are listed in 44 C.F.R. § 65.7. ====Outdated flood maps==== Computer models overlay current hydraulic analysis on community images. The U.S. Geological Survey says increased runoff resulting from urban growth generally increases flood hazards to communities and that flood hazard maps based on data before urban growth may no longer be accurate. The U.S. Geological Survey gives the example that construction encroaching into the floodplain narrows the floodplain width thereby increasing the resistance to flow. Consequently, the water is at a higher stage as it flows past the construction causing backwater to flood a larger area upstream. FEMA's computer model image at right \\"represents the percent chance of flooding at least one time during a 30-year period for a given cell, or location, within the mapped floodplain\\". ====Updating flood maps==== NFIP regulation \\"Requirement to submit new technical data\\" says \\"A community’s base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information becomes available, a community shall notify the Administrator of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data in accordance with this part. Such a submission is necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and flood plain management requirements will be based upon current data.\\"44 C.F.R. § 65.3 FEMA requires \\"Copies of the input and output data from the original and revised hydraulic analyses shall be submitted\\" with the hydraulic analysis supporting revisions to flood maps.44 CFR § 65.6(a)(8) A 2015 FEMA website identifies that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) computer program has been adopted for the preparation of studies and restudies for the NFIP. ==Land use restrictions in floodplains== 2008 flood in Cedar Rapids, Iowa exceeded the 500-year flood level and damaged public buildings ===Findings=== The U.S. Congress finds annual flood losses are _increasing at an alarming rate_ and forms of Federal assistance _are often determining factors in the utilization of land and the location and construction of public and of private industrial, commercial, and residential facilities_ The purpose for such Federal assistance is frustrated where Federal assistance is exposed to flood risks,. A U.S. District Court finds that FEMA determinations of which properties are within the regulatory floodplain affects the location of development: ===U.S. Codes=== The U.S. Code (USC) codification of the Public Law where Congress established the NFIP42 U.S.C. § 4001(e) in the section \\"Congressional findings and declaration of purpose\\" includes: National Flood Insurance is limited to communities that adopted adequate land use and control measures with effective enforcement provisions consistent with these purposes.42 U.S.C. § 4022(a)(1) and 42 U.S.C. § 4102(c) The USC section \\"Additional Congressional findings and declaration of purpose\\" says \\"property acquired or constructed with grants or other Federal assistance may be exposed to risk of loss through floods, thus frustrating the purpose for which such assistance was extended\\".42 U.S.C. § 4002(a)(3) This USC further says \\"The purpose of this Act, therefore, is to ... require States or local communities, as a condition of future Federal financial assistance, to participate in the flood insurance program and to adopt adequate flood plan ordinances with effective enforcement provisions consistent with Federal standards to reduce or avoid future flood losses\\".42 U.S.C. § 4002(b)(3) The specific prohibition is in the USC section \\"Prohibition against Federal approval of financial assistance\\" that says \\"No Federal officer or agency shall approve any financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes on and after July 1, 1975, for use in any area that has been identified by the Administrator as an area having special flood hazards unless the community in which such area is situated is then participating in the national flood insurance program.\\"42 U.S.C. § 4106(a) ===Code of Federal Regulations=== FEMA created a regulation that identifies the minimum flood plain management criteria for communities44 CFR § 60.3 including the following: * utilize base flood elevation and floodway data * require permits for all development in Zone A * determine whether proposed developments will be reasonably safe from flooding * determine that all necessary permits have been received from Federal and State government agencies, including section 404 permits of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 * require within flood- prone areas that new and replacement water supply systems to be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems * require within flood-prone areas that new and replacement sanitary sewage systems to be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and to minimize or eliminate discharges from the systems into flood waters * require within flood-prone areas that onsite waste disposal systems to be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding * notify adjacent communities prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse * determine that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained * require that manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement The Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) \\"Suspension of community eligibility\\" says communities that do not adequately enforce flood plain management regulations meeting the minimum requirements shall be placed on probation.Failure to correct the violation will result in the community losing eligibility for the NFIP.44 C.F.R. § 59.24 ====Optional stricter standards==== Buoyant forces during floods can cause underground storage tanks to float out of the ground. When flood water enters sewers, the sewage gets released to the environment. Flood water carried oil from a pipeline break into the floodplain beyond normal stream level. Flood water making bridge impassable. The NFIP encourages communities to adopt floodplain management standards more restrictive than the NFIP minimum standards.44 C.F.R. § 60.1(d) Communities must consider the additional measures specified in 44 C.F.R. § 60.22.44 C.F.R. § 60.21 Some states and communities enforce a more protective \\"Regulatory Floodway\\" by limiting the cumulative increase in water surface elevation to a half-foot or tenth of a foot instead of the NFIP minimum standard increase of one-foot. This 44 C.F.R. § 60.22 says community flood plain management regulations should permit only development in flood- prone areas that is appropriate with the probability of flood damage.44 C.F.R. § 60.22(a)(1) Flooding can damage underground storage tanks (USTs) resulting in leaks of petroleum that contaminate soil, surface water, and groundwater. USTs may even float out of the ground during floods. This 44 C.F.R. § 60.22 says community flood plain management regulations should prohibit public utilities to be installed in flood prone areas unless it is essential to be located there.44 C.F.R. § 60.22(a)(2) Leakage from on-site sewage systems cause contamination problems during floods. Sanitary sewer overflows and combined sewer overflows also release sewage contaminates into flood water. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency advises \\"Avoid contact with flood water due to potentially elevated levels of contamination associated with raw sewage and other hazardous or toxic substances that may be in the flood water.\\" This 44 C.F.R. § 60.22 says community flood plain management regulations should divert development to areas safe from flooding to prevent environmentally incompatible flood plain uses.44 C.F.R. § 60.22(c)(2) Ruptures of crude oil pipelines result in crude oil contamination of floodplains. Oil spills create numerous environmental harms. Releases of gasoline, oil, or natural gas during floods also create fire hazards. This 44 C.F.R. § 60.22 says community flood plain management regulations should provide access requirements so that people do not become isolated by flood water.44 C.F.R. § 60.22(c)(7),(8) The Illinois Supreme Court found: Loose propane tanks exploded during a flood causing business to burn down. Safety guidance for propane tanks in floods says propane tanks in floodplains need to be secured to prevent them from floating off during flooding. Propane tanks floating in floods break the connecting piping releasing the gas. Leaking propane tanks create fire hazards during floods. A court finds that local governments might have immunity for negligent emergency response activities because in an emergency there may not be time to determine the best course of action. However, there may not be grounds for immunity for pre-emergency actions where negligence results in flooding. In 2004 the Association of State Floodplain Managers stated \\"Most local governments have simply assumed that the federal floodplain management approaches embody a satisfactory standard of care, perhaps not realizing that they actually induce additional flooding and damage.\\" In 2000, the Association of State Floodplain Managers recommended a “no adverse impact” goal to prevent one property owner from adversely impacting the properties of others. ===Related floodplain regulations by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers=== The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) identifies themselves as the Federal government's largest water resources development and management agency. USACE says they provide information, technical services, planning guidance, and planning assistance to guide the development of floodplains. USACE says their regulatory program after 1968 evolved to balance the national concerns for both the protection and utilization of important resources by public interest review.33 C.F.R. § 320.1 The 33 C.F.R. 320.4(l)(2) states: ==FEMA shall consult with Federal, State, and local agencies== U.S. Congress requires FEMA to consult with other departments and agencies of the Federal Government, and with interstate, State, and local agencies responsible for flood control in order to make certain that those agencies' programs are consistent with the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). For example a U.S. District Court ordered FEMA to consult with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) on FEMA’s mapping regulations and FEMA’s revisions of flood maps to determine whether they jeopardize the continued existence of the Puget Sound chinook salmon.: == Criticisms == Prior to the program, property losses stemming from flood damage were largely the responsibility of the property owner, although the consequences were sometimes mitigated through provisions for disaster aid. Today, owners of property in flood plains frequently receive disaster aid and payment for insured losses, which in many ways negates the original intent of the NFIP. Consequently, these policy decisions have escalated losses stemming from floods in recent years, both in terms of property and life. Moreover, certain provisions within the NFIP increase the likelihood that flood-prone properties will be occupied by the people least likely to be in a position to recover from flood disasters, which further increases demand for aid. This is an example of adverse selection. Some factors contributing to increased demand for aid are: * Flood insurance for properties in flood prone areas is mandatory only to secure loans, which makes it somewhat more likely that flood prone properties will be owned by seniors who have paid off their mortgages, or investors who have acquired the property for rental income. * Flood insurance only covers losses for the owner of the property, and claims are subject to caps, which further increases the likelihood that the property will be occupied by renters rather than the property owner. * Flood prone properties are more likely to be offered for rent because of the owners' increased risks and/or costs associated with occupying the property themselves. * Flood prone properties are more likely to be offered for rent at a discount, which attracts lower income groups, seniors, and infirm groups. According to critics of the program, the government's subsidized insurance plan \\"encouraged building, and rebuilding, in vulnerable coastal areas and floodplains.\\" Stephen Ellis, of the group Taxpayers for Common Sense, points to \\"properties that flooded 17 or 18 times that were still covered under the federal insurance program\\" without premiums going up. Critics say this program is underperforming because it is starved for funding compared to disaster response and recovery, and the process of applying for a buyout is unreasonably slow.Debt-Laden FEMA Is Slow To Act On Program That Buys Flooded Houses Another criticism is that FEMA doesn't administer all policies, instead outsourcing many policies to private insurance companies. When a disaster occurs, FEMA makes payments to those private insurance companies to offset their costs. However, there is little oversight and few rules as to how the money should be distributed. As a consequence, private insurers have been known to use FEMA payments to hire attorneys that fight policyholders in court. One law firm is estimated to have received from FEMA payments to fight Hurricane Sandy claims. ==Flood risk management to anticipate climate change== Flooded residential neighborhood during the \\"500 year flood\\" in southern Louisiana in August 2016 President Obama on January 30, 2015 issued Executive Order 13690 requiring Flood Risk Management to anticipate flooding increases over time due to the effects of climate change. A peer review study finds climate change since 1900 may have increased the probability of extreme precipitation events like the August 2016 flooding in south Louisiana. President Trump on August 15, 2017 issued Executive Order 13807 whose Section 6 revokes President Obama's Executive Order 13690. == References == == External links == *http://www.floodsmart.gov *Federal law authorizing NFIP *Experts: Flood terms mislead public MSNBC Category:Financial services companies established in 1968 Category:United States Department of Homeland Security Category:Insurance in the United States Category:Insurance law Category:Flood control acts in the United States ","title":"National Flood Insurance Program"},{"id":"2563605","text":"Voznesensk may refer to: * Voznesensk, a city in Mykolaiv Oblast, Ukraine * Voznesensk Raion, an administrative district in Mykolaiv Oblast of Ukraine * Ivanovo, a city in Russia previously known as Ivanovo-Voznesensk ","title":"Voznesensk (disambiguation)"},{"id":"2563616","text":"Oceansize were an English rock band from Manchester, formed in 1998. The band consisted of Mike Vennart (vocals, guitar), Steve Durose (guitar, backing vocals), Richard \\"Gambler\\" Ingram (guitar, keyboards), Mark Heron (drums) and Jon Ellis (bass guitar) for the majority of its career, with Steve Hodson replacing Ellis on bass guitar in 2006. The band released four studio albums, in addition to a number of minor EPs and singles, displaying a wide array of influences from several genres including post-rock, math rock, psychedelic rock, and space rock. Following a twelve-year career, Oceansize announced their split in February 2011, with the members moving on to different projects. ==History== ===Formation and early years (1998–2000)=== The band members met each other while attending music college in Salford, where the various members performed in a range of different musical acts very stylistically different from the band they would go on to create. \\"[The bands were] pretty terrible,\\" said Mike Vennart. \\"We were in a grunge band. When I met Steve I asked him to be the new guitarist. I wanted to be experimental and unusual and still write pop songs. We were terrible at it. We didn't go anywhere for a while. When we got a new rhythm section, we re-thought what we were doing and got better. We had more vision. Although we don't all like the same music and have different tastes, we can see clearly where our music needs the most work.\\" Though known as a Manchester band, Vennart, Gambler and Ellis are originally from Yorkshire, DuRose from Birmingham, and Mark Heron is Scottish. Steven Hodson, who joined the band later, is the only member of Oceansize to hail from the Manchester area. The band subsequently named themselves after Jane's Addiction song, \\"Ocean Size\\". According to guitarist Gambler, the band's then-bassist Jon Ellis came up with the name: \\"I think, at the time, he was thinking what we would sound like. Jane's Nothing's Shocking album, which has the track \\"Ocean Size\\" on it, was definitely a big influence.\\" ===First EPs and Effloresce (2000–2005)=== Over the next few years, Oceansize would release two self-released EPs Amputee and A Very Still Movement. This in turn led to interest from Beggars Banquet Records, who signed the band in 2000. The band's first release on the label was the Relapse EP titled after a very early composition that had been through many different reworkings. The EP was produced by Cardiacs leader Tim Smith, a long-time hero of the band. Oceansize's debut album Effloresce was released on 29 September 2003 on Beggars Banquet. The album spawned the singles \\"Catalyst\\", \\"One Day All This Could Be Yours\\" and \\"Remember Where You Are\\", each of which featured a music video. The album garnered considerable critical acclaim, with music critic Ben Hogwood stating that: \\"with their broad harmonic language and fluctuating rhythms it's difficult to give an alternative to Oceansize, which is always a good sign. If pushed I would say they've taken a good liking to '70s rock but taken on board the works of bands such as Muse and The Cooper Temple Clause, along with the more expansive end of Seattle grunge music.\\". ===Everyone Into Position and line-up change (2005–2007)=== Two years later, the band released their second album, Everyone Into Position on 19 September 2005. The album track \\"Meredith\\" was featured on the popular television drama The O.C., and one of the album's singles, \\"Music For A Nurse\\", became the soundtrack to an Orange advertising campaign entitled Fish during summer 2006. \\"Music For A Nurse\\" was also featured in the motion picture The Invisible (2007), and both \\"Music For A Nurse\\" and \\"Meredith\\" have also been used in the BBC drama series Waterloo Road. Oceansize have mixed views on the album as a whole. Despite the band's view on the record, critics and fans have generally praised the release. The lukewarm review the album received from Pitchfork was the one that seemed to be the most consistent with the band's own thoughts on it. The review singled out the album's more progressive tracks such as \\"You Can't Keep a Bad Man Down\\" and \\"Ornament/The Last Wrongs\\" for praise while criticizing songs such as \\"Heaven Alive\\" for sticking too closely to alt rock conventions that the reviewer ultimately felt was holding the band back. Despite this, Mike Vennart has stated frequently that Everyone Into Position is his favourite Oceansize album. Following the release of Everyone Into Position, Oceansize subsequently left Beggars Banquet. The band sought a new record deal that would better support the band in terms of promotion and financial backing for international touring. Mike Vennart implied in a recent interview that the record deal was contingent on the band writing two tracks \\"on order\\" for the company. These mp3s were released on the band's Myspace page around Christmas 2006 as a band-described gift to the fans. The two songs were \\"Red Rag to a Bear\\" and \\"Siberian Bullshit\\". In the posting of these mp3s, Vennart described these tracks as \\"warts an' all,\\" and suggested that they would not show up on the new album. On moving to new label, Superball Music, Vennart described the move as a chance for the band to move forward: \\"we reached a point when we'd gone as far as we could [with Beggars Banquet]. We needed a new home and these guys offered it to us on a plate. We're the only band on the label at the moment, so they can't do enough for us.\\" Everyone Into Position marked the final appearance of bassist Jon Ellis. On 4 December 2005, the band issued a press release, stating that Ellis was leaving the band, but would still contribute musically. On 16 January 2006 frontman Mike Vennart issued a short post on an Oceansize messageboard announcing Ellis' replacement, Steve Hodson – a member of the Oceansize side-project Kong and also the drummer in Capulet. ===Frames and Home & Minor (2007–2009)=== The band's third album, Frames, was released on 1 October 2007 on Superball Music. Artwork for the album was provided by Robin Finck of Nine Inch Nails and Guns N' Roses. Originally entitled The Frame, the band elected to alter the name slightly after an incidental suggestion; Vennart explained that \\"one of our friends, who's in Future of the Left, said 'I love the title... Frames, isn't it?' We just thought, 'well it wasn't, but that's a lot better. It's an angular title, it evokes strength and structure and it's quite cinematic.\\" The album was trailed as featuring \\"a lot of songs about grudges and negative energy\\", with the song \\"Commemorative 9/11 T-Shirt\\", inspired by a gift to Vennart by band Cardiacs, which includes a time signature of \\"11/8 or 9/8, so when we were naming the song it was like 'it's in 11, it's in 9, it's got to be 9/11\\". In May and June 2009, Oceansize supported Sydney band Cog on a national tour of Australia, along with other support act Calling All Cars, playing a string of dates which included shows in capital cities Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide & Brisbane. Of the tour, Mike Vennart spoke of the excitement, saying \\"from the moment (the tour) was mentioned, I was just hammering our manager, going 'make it happen!'\\" On the 1 August 2009, the band played the Sonisphere festival at Knebworth, joining Linkin Park, Metallica, Nine Inch Nails, Alice in Chains and more for the weekend festival. On the 21 August 2009, Oceansize supported Biffy Clyro at the Edinburgh Corn Exchange and the reformed Faith No More on the 25th The band released a live box set in September 2009, entitled Feed to Feed. The release is limited to 5000 copies. The live recordings are taken from a series of shows the band performed on three consecutive nights at the Roadhouse in Manchester. The band played each of their three studio albums from start to finish, one album each night, including related b-sides. The boxset contains three DVDs and four CDs. A new EP, entitled Home and Minor, was released in October 2009. On the EP, Vennart has explained that the band have adopted a particular stylistic approach on the record. ===Self Preserved While the Bodies Float Up (2009–2010)=== The band started working on their fourth (and ultimately final) album, Self Preserved While the Bodies Float Up in fall 2009. In January 2010, the band embarked upon a UK tour, showcasing new material According to Mike Vennart's Twitter, the recording of the album was completed on 17 April, with Vennart stating \\"Recording is complete! Album 4 is go! It's all on Chris Sheldon now\\". Mastering was completed at Abbey Road Studios on 18 May 2010 by Sean Magee. On 22 July 2010, Oceansize posted one of the album's songs, \\"SuperImposer\\", on their Superball website, and made it available for download via Twitter and Facebook. Self Preserved While the Bodies Float Up was released on 6 September 2010. The album showcased a heavier side to the band, who stated that it probably was their heaviest studio album to date. However, Vennart claimed that the album still had the diversity found on other Oceansize albums. The band subsequently toured to promote the release. ===Band break-up === On 25 February 2011, Oceansize announced via the band's Twitter and Facebook pages that they had split up. No explanations were provided. In an interview a year later in 2012, Vennart commented \\"It's tricky. I'd kind of like to tell the story but it's pretty dramatic. It would alter the sound of the records that we spent ages dreaming up, and to some people it might sound all a little petty. But it was so fucking ugly. Suffice to say it was a recurring problem that grew and grew and it couldn't be ignored or tolerated anymore.\\"Introducing British Theatre – article by Josh Hall in The Line of Best Fit, 19 March 2012 On 31 May 2013 Vennart finally put an end to most speculation via a post on Twitter, stating that after a disastrous band performance at a concert in Warsaw on 23 October 2010, Gambler had quit Oceansize and that this had broken up the band. In reply to a fan who tweeted a video of the performance, in which Mark Heron's drumming seems considerably affected, Vennart commented: \\"Stay off them drugs, kids\\". While Vennart refused to blame any individuals in particular, he had previously said (in a May 2012 interview with the music blog Undersong) that persistent drug abuse by at least one band member had undermined Oceansize and led to the circumstances surrounding the split: \\"Whilst Oceansize had no delusions of grandeur, there were those in the band that just weren't up to the job. Put it like this, when you watch Biffy Clyro live you can rest assured that they are pretty much stone-cold sober. They're certainly not drunk, stoned, on downers or tripping their tits off ... They're easy to play for cos they know how to play the songs and they play them correctly every single night. There's an inherent trust there. There's also a respect for their audience – they understand that their fans may have travelled miles, saved up money for tickets, planned their life around a show. It's this respect for each other and their audience that has stood Biffy in good stead and it has helped take them to the top. That mindset has to be in place before you even consider a setlist. This respect and these qualities were, I'm sad to say, not consistent in the ranks of Oceansize. Even if the opportunity had ever presented itself, Oceansize simply was not allowed to move forward. Whenever we had to step up to the challenge, the same fucking turd was on the doorstep.\\"'Interview: Mike Vennart' in 'UnderSong' music blog, May 2012 While Vennart has pointed to Heron's Warsaw performance as the primary impetus, Gambler also pointed to the end of a long-term relationship as a factor in his decision to quit the band. Gambler does not rule out a reunion in the future, though he does not believe it will happen any time soon. However, Vennart stated on Twitter in 2017 that he \\"[couldn't] ever be [in Oceansize] again [...] It's literally impossible. Unbearable.\\" In 2020 he tweeted that if Oceansize were to reunite it would \\"be for THE MONEY. Of which there was NONE.\\" ==Post-Oceansize== Following the breakup of Oceansize, various members went on to other work or continued with side projects which they'd begun prior to the split. Gambler (under his real name of Richard A. Ingram) had already begun a solo career in parallel to Oceansize, while Steve Hodson and Mark Heron continued with Kong (and Hodson continued his ongoing solo work as Mild Eyes). In 2011, both Mike Vennart and Steve Durose took on work as touring guitarists for other bands – Vennart with Biffy Clyro and Durose with Amplifier. Further post-Oceansize projects emerged quickly after the breakup. Steve Hodson worked with the band Chandelier Swing while Mark Heron worked with improv band Shamefaced and released new music under his Kong alias of \\"Krem\\". Mike Vennart and Gambler reunited in the duo British Theatre, who released their debut EP via Bandcamp in February 2012.\\"British Theatre: I'd had it with the darkness\\" – article by Alex Lynham in Fake DIY, 25 February 2012 In a February 2012 interview with The Line of Best Fit, Vennart mentioned that he was writing with Steve Durose again for an as-yet-unspecified project. Vennart released his debut solo album in 2015, titled The Demon Joke, collaborating and touring with Gambler and Steve Durose once again. His second album, To Cure a Blizzard Upon a Plastic Sea, was released on September 14, 2018. ==Style, influences and creative process== Oceansize described eclectic sources of inspiration. Gambler has attested that everyone in the band had \\"such diverse influences. I think it would be a list a mile long. The obvious ones, especially for me, would be Radiohead, Mogwai, Aphex Twin, Nine Inch Nails and Tool; I think I could probably go on all day. I mean if you looked at our record collection you probably wouldn't think it.\\" Associates of UK groups such as Amplifier, Biffy Clyro and Aereogramme, earlier in their career, Oceansize were also frequently grouped in with the space rock movement that had gained some underground popularity at the time - essentially heavy alternative rock with shoegaze leanings. One of the band's earliest major tours was with Cave In from Massachusetts, U.S., who they were frequently compared to especially in their earlier years. Oceansize often stated that the bulk of their writing was the product of fruitful jam sessions, with Steve Durose saying after the release of Effloresce that \\"our sound has just evolved really, but right from the first rehearsal, we kind of had it in the bag. We were on mushrooms and just jammed for ages, and then we listened back to the tapes. About three songs from Effloresce were born in that one rehearsal, and we just realized we had something special happening. Everything comes from jams, though. That's the way we write.\\" In regards to structure and time signature, Durose cites drummer Mark Heron as a key collaborator; \\"Mark's very into strange beats, so what will start off as a very simple idea, once it's been through the Oceansize washing machine will come out as something sounding quite bizarre at the other end.\\" Gambler has advocated a 'no strings' approach with the creative process, saying that \\"I think we have been tied into the whole progressive thing for quite a bit now. When we formed the band we didn't think we were going to be this or that sort of band. We're forward thinking as far as our music is concerned\\". == Legacy == Since their breakup, Oceansize have been cited as an influence by a wide variety of artists. Russian band iamthemorning took their name from the Oceansize song \\"I Am the Morning\\". The title of 2018 album Effloresce by American band Covet was an homage to the album of the same name by Oceansize. Other bands who have cited them as an influence include Rose Kemp, The Longcut, The Pineapple Thief, Rosetta, Black Peaks, and Alpha Male Tea Party. Among the artists who have expressed admiration for their work are Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree, who ranked Everyone Into Position and Frames as two of his favourite albums of the 2000s, and Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater, calling them \\"probably the best [band] in the alternative-prog vein\\". ==Side projects and collaborations== Kong (consisting of Steven Hodson and Mark Heron) recorded their debut album Snake Magnet in the summer of 2007 at The Works Recording Studio in Bredbury (where Everyone Into Position was recorded). Kong signed with Los Angeles-based label White Drugs, home of The Bronx and released Snake Magnet in 2009, with two singles preceding the release (on Brew Records). Gambler – under his real name of Richard A. Ingram – released a solo album Consolamentum in May 2010 on a small Manchester label called WhiteBox. He has also sometimes played bass guitar with the post-punk band Pocketknife, and released a couple of CD-Rs independently consisting of solo piano music.Richard A Ingram website Since 2018 he has also been releasing music under the name BLACKDEATHCROSS.BLACKDEATHCROSS Bandcamp page In 2010, Mike Vennart joined long-time friends Biffy Clyro as second guitarist on all live dates. He has continued to play as a Biffy Clyro touring musician, as well as supplying additional guitar and vocals for their 2013 album Opposites: Gambler also joined the Biffy Clyro live band in 2012. On 7 May 2010, Steven Hodson was announced as the fill-in bassist of Future of the Left as the short-term replacement for the recently departed Kelson. In 2014 Hodson's new band USA Nails with ex Hawk Eyes drummer Matt Reid, Gareth Thomas of Silent Front, Stuart Plant from Death Pedals and Daniel Holloway of Dead Arms released their debut album 'Sonic Moist' on the Smalltown America label followed by 'No Pleasure' in 2015. Their third album 'Shame Spiral' was released on Hominid Sounds in 2017.USA Nails Bandcamp page On May 1, 2017, Hodson and his USA Nails bandmate Daniel Holloway launched the Sad Tapes label with the release of Dead Arms '4 Track Masters EP'. The label was set up to record and release music for those who prefer the quality of demos or live sessions with no fuss and no frills.Sad Tapes Bandcamp page Ex-bassist Jon Ellis is recording and producing tracks from underground Manchester band \\"The Marivaux\\". Oceansize shared a camaraderie with fellow Mancunian band Amplifier, with the bands referring to each other as \\"brothers-in-amps\\". Mike Vennart and Steve Durose supplied backing vocals on two of the tracks on Amplifier's self-titled debut album, while Amplifier's front-man Sel Balamir produced and mixed the Oceansize EP A Very Still Movement, also contributing guitar to the song \\"Sizeofanocean\\". Balamir also co-mixed the Relapse EP in 2002. During the recording of Everyone Into Position in 2005 at The Works Recording Studio, Vennart ran into Snoop Dogg, and recorded guitar parts for the rapper's demos. After a phone call from Polydor Records requesting use of the studio, the mystery client turned out to be Snoop Dogg. Vennart said \\"This studio is where we have done a lot of our work but it isn't an industry blinged up place, it's just a nice and comfortable basement studio. We ended up being his skivvies for the night literally making pizza and frying chicken for him. He worked out that I was a guitarist and sent me driving at five o' clock in the morning to fetch my guitar because I'm left-handed. I ended up playing all these cheesy porn soundtrack guitar riffs to him for about three hours until I couldn't play it anymore. He likes everything really loose, definitely not tight. His grooves are unorthodox. I'll be honest; I didn't appreciate his music until I saw how they do it all. After every gig he does he has somewhere booked out so he can just turn up with about fifteen guys who all have a Macintosh and just make beats all night. It was really great watching them work.\\" ==Discography== ;Studio albums *Effloresce (2003) *Everyone into Position (2005) *Frames (2007) *Self Preserved While the Bodies Float Up (2010) ;EPs * Amputee (1999) * A Very Still Movement (2001) * Relapse (2002) – UK No. 99 UK Indie No. 27 * Music for Nurses (2004) * Home & Minor (2009) ;Box sets *Feed to Feed (2009) ;Singles * \\"Saturday Morning Breakfast Show\\" (1999) (7\\" Vinyl Only) * \\"One Day All This Could Be Yours\\" (2003) (CD/10\\" Vinyl) – UK Indie No. 30 * \\"Catalyst\\" (2003) (Download Single) * \\"Remember Where You Are\\" (2003) (CD/7\\" Vinyl) – UK No. 94 UK Indie No. 20 * \\"Catalyst\\" (2004) (CD/7\\" Vinyl) – UK No. 73 UK Indie No. 13 * \\"Heaven Alive\\" (2005) (CD/7\\" Vinyl) – UK No. 78 * \\"New Pin\\" (2006) (CD/7\\" Vinyl) – UK Indie No. 20 * \\"Walking in the Air\\" (Cover version) (2007) (Free Christmas Single, Web Only) * \\"SuperImposer\\" (2010) (7\\" Vinyl/Digital Download) ;Music Videos * \\"One Day All This Could Be Yours\\" (2003) * \\"Catalyst\\" (2003) * \\"Heaven Alive\\" (2005) * \\"New Pin\\" (2006) * \\"Legal Teens\\" (2009) * \\"SuperImposer\\" (2010) ;Other appearances * \\"Fear\\" (Spratleys Japs cover) (Leader of the Starry Skies: A Tribute to Tim Smith, Songbook 1) (2010) ==Members== ===Final line- up=== * Mike Vennart – guitar, lead vocals (1998–2011) * Steve Durose – guitar, backing vocals (1998–2011) * Richard \\"Gambler\\" Ingram – guitar, keyboards (1998–2011) * Steven Hodson – bass, keyboards, guitar (2006–2011) * Mark Heron – drums (1998–2011) ===Previous members=== * Jon Ellis – bass, keyboards (1998–2005) ===Timeline=== ==References== ==External links== *Stereokill: February 2010 *Radio Interview.

He was fourteen years of age when his family immigrated to the United States in 1852. As a young man he made a fortune through shrewd investments in California and Nevada mining companies and was eventually appointed president of the San Francisco Stock Exchange. Wanting to expand his business opportunities, in 1876 he relocated to the heart of the country's financial center in New York City. While living there, he became interested in horse racing and began investing heavily in a stable of Thoroughbred race horses. His colt Spendthrift won the 1879 Belmont Stakes, and after Pierre Lorillard had shipped some of his American-bred horses to race in England and became the first American owner to win The Derby, Keene followed suit. In 1881, his horse Foxhall, named for his son, became the first American horse to win the Grand Prix de Paris, then the most important race in France. The following year Foxhall, trained in England by William Day, won England's Ascot Gold Cup. However, in 1884 huge losses in the Chicago grain market cost him everything he owned, leaving him with nothing but heavy debts. He began a remarkable comeback a few years later after being hired by Wall Street investor William Havemeyer to manage a stock fund. Such were his talents at market manipulation that he was soon engaged by J. P. Morgan and William Rockefeller to manage funds for them and Keene emerged once again as a wealthy and powerful force in the New York financial community. By 1891 James R. Keene was back to investing in racehorses and his Castleton Farm near Lexington, Kentucky became one of the most important breeding operations in the history of American horse racing. In the early 1890s, Keene bought over forty English mares and shipped them to Castleton for breeding. Keene hired his brother-in-law, Major Foxhall Daingerfield, to run Castleton Farm and for his racing stable he hired James G. Rowe, Sr. as a trainer. He returned to racing in England, this time involving his son Foxhall P. Keene in the racing stable. Their filly Cap and Bells II won the 1901 Epsom Oaks. In 1908, London Sportsman magazine wrote that Keene possessed, \\"the greatest lot of racehorses ever owned by one man.\\" James R. Keene bred National Museum of Racing and Hall of Famer Kingston and owned Domino, as well as breeding and owning future Hall of Famer inductees Colin, Peter Pan, Commando, Maskette, and Sysonby. Keene owned six Belmont Stakes winners but at a time when transporting horses south to other racetracks via railroad was a long, costly, and often risky venture, he never entered his horses in the Kentucky Derby, and won the Preakness Stakes only once. He died on January 3, 1913 of an acute stomach ailment at Miss Alston's House for Private Patients in Manhattan. He was interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx. He was vice-Chairman of The Jockey Club at the time of his passing. ==Family== In 1863 he married Sara Jay Daingerfield of Virginia with whom he had son Foxhall and a daughter, Jessica. Sara Keene died in 1916 and is interred in Woodlawn Cemetery next to her husband. Biographer Alden Hatch collaborated with Foxhall Keene to write James R. Keene's biography titled Full Tilt that was published in 1938 by Derrydale Press. ==Racing== In 2019, James R.

It was based on the second movement, \\"Rondeau\\", of the Abdelazer suite. It was originally commissioned for the British educational documentary film called Instruments of the Orchestra released on 29 November 1946, directed by Muir Mathieson and featuring the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Malcolm Sargent;\\"Instruments of the Orchestra\\", British Film Institute, accessed 24 May 2013 Sargent also conducted the concert première on 15 October 1946 with the Pool Philharmonic in the Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool, England. The work is one of the best-known pieces by the composer, and is often associated with two other works in the context of children's music education: Saint-Saëns' The Carnival of the Animals and Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf ==Instrumentation== The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra is scored for symphony orchestra: *Woodwinds: piccolo, flute, two oboes, two clarinets in B flat and A and two bassoons *Brass: four horns in F, two trumpets in C, three trombones (two tenors and one bass) and bass tuba *Percussion: timpani, bass drum, cymbals, tambourine, triangle, snare drum, woodblock, xylophone, castanets, tamtam, and whip *Strings: harp, first and second violin, viola, cello, and double bass. ==Structure== The work is based on the Rondeau from Henry Purcell's incidental music to Aphra Behn's Abdelazer, and is structured, in accordance with the plan of the original documentary film, as a way of showing off the tone colours and capacities of the various sections of the orchestra. In the introduction, the theme is initially played by the entire orchestra, then by each major family of instruments of the orchestra: first the woodwinds, then the brass, then the strings, and finally by the percussion. Each variation then features a particular instrument in depth, generally moving through each family from high to low (the order of the families is slightly different from the introduction). So, for example, the first variation features the piccolo and flutes; each member of the woodwind family then gets a variation, ending with the bassoon; and so on, through the strings, brass, and finally the percussion. After the whole orchestra has been effectively taken to pieces in this way, it is reassembled using an original fugue which starts with the piccolo, followed by all the woodwinds, strings, brass and percussion in turn. Once everyone has entered, the brass are re-introduced (with a strike on the tamtam) with Purcell's original melody. The sections of the piece and instruments introduced by the variations are as follows. ;Theme: Allegro maestoso e largamente :Tutti (D minor), woodwinds (F major), brass (E♭ major), strings (G minor), then percussion (written in A major) ;Variation A: Presto :Flutes and Piccolo ;Variation B: Lento :Oboes ;Variation C: Moderato :Clarinets ;Variation D: Allegro alla marcia :Bassoons ;Variation E: Brillante: alla polacca :Violins ;Variation F: Meno mosso :Violas ;Variation G: Lusingando :Cellos ;Variation H: Cominciando lento ma poco a poco accel. al Allegro :Double basses ;Variation I: Maestoso :Harp ;Variation J: L'istesso tempo :French horns ;Variation K: Vivace :Trumpets ;Variation L: Allegro pomposo :Trombones and tuba ;Variation M: Moderato :Percussion (Timpani; Bass drum & Cymbals; Tambourine & Triangle; Snare drum & woodblock; Xylophone; Castanets & Tam-tam; Whip; percussion tutti) ;Fugue: Allegro molto ==Narration== The narration for the documentary film was written by Eric Crozier, the producer of the first production of Britten's opera Peter Grimes, and is sometimes spoken by the conductor or a separate speaker during performance of the piece. The composer also arranged a version without narration. The one without narration is more often recorded. The commentary often alters between recordings. A new narration was written by Simon Butteriss for the Aldeburgh Festival and broadcast live by CBBC presenter Johny Pitts with the BBC Symphony Orchestra for the Britten 100 celebrations in 2013. Comedian and author John Hodgman wrote a new narration of The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra in 2015 for a series of performances with the Boston Pops Orchestra. ==References== * Boosey & Hawkes No. 606.

It finds many uses in organic reactions such as the CBS reduction, Diels-Alder reactions and (3+2) cycloadditions. Proline, a naturally occurring chiral compound, is readily and cheaply available. It transfers its stereocenter to the catalyst which in turn is able to drive an organic reaction enantioselectively to one of two possible enantiomers. This selectivity is due to steric strain in the transition state that develops for one enantiomer but not for the other. == Synthesis == The CBS catalyst can be prepared from diphenylprolinol The catalyst is also useful in asymmetric Aldol reactions. Diphenylprolinol is condensed with a phenylboronic acid, or with borane (as shown below), to give the CBS catalyst, which complexes in situ with borane to give the active catalyst. Image:Diphenylprolinol CBScatalyst.gif == Use == The general outline for the organic synthesis of a CBS catalyst is shown below. The first leg of the reaction sequence starts from the azeotropic dehydration of a boronic acid (1) such as one based on toluene to a boroxine (2). This boroxine reacts with the proline derivative (3d) to form the basic oxazaborolidine CBS catalyst (4). The oxazaborolidine was first developed as a ketone reducing agent by the laboratory of Itsuno, and thus is more properly called the Itsuno-Corey oxazaborolidine. Proline derivative 3d is prepared in a separate leg from a Grignard reaction with Grignard reagent 3c and proline ester 3b. A Lewis acid superacid salt (6) can be obtained with the aid of triflic acid (5). Many other such catalysts exist with different derivatives of these reactants. center ==References== * * * Category:Reagents for organic chemistry Category:Organoboron compounds Category:Catalysts ","title":"CBS catalyst"},{"id":"2563661","text":"The Twelve Conclusions of the Lollards is a Middle English religious text containing statements by leaders of the English medieval movement, the Lollards, inspired by teachings of John Wycliffe. The Conclusions were written in 1395. Deanesly, p. 257 The text was presented to the Parliament of England and nailed to the doors of Westminster Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral as a placard (a typical medieval method for publishing). The manifesto suggested the expanded treatise Thirty-Seven Conclusions (Thirty-seven Articles against Corruptions in the ChurchPrinted as the Remonstrance against Romish corruptions in the Church addressed to the people and parliament of England in 1395, 18 Ric. II., first time published 1851 ed. by J. Forshall ) for those that wished more in-depth information. Deansley, p. 282 ==Twelve conclusions== The text summarizes twelve areas in which the Lollards argued that the Christian Church in England needed reform. ===First conclusion: state of the Church=== The first conclusion asserts that the English Church has become too involved in affairs of temporal power, led by the bad example of the Church of Rome. ===Second conclusion: the priesthood=== The second conclusion asserts that the ceremonies used for the ordination of priests and bishops are without scriptural basis or precedent. ===Third conclusion: clerical celibacy=== The third conclusion asserts that the practice of clerical celibacy has encouraged sodomy among the clergy. ===Fourth conclusion: transubstantiation=== The fourth conclusion asserts that the doctrine of transubstantiation leads to idolatrous worship of everyday objects (the communion wafers). ===Fifth conclusion: exorcisms and hallowings=== The fifth conclusion asserts that the exorcisms and hallowings carried out by priests are a sort of witchcraft and are incompatible with Christian theology. ===Sixth conclusion: clerics in secular offices=== The sixth conclusion asserts that it is inappropriate for men who hold high office in the Church to simultaneously hold positions of great temporal power. ===Seventh conclusion: prayers for the dead=== The seventh conclusion asserts that prayers for the souls of specific individual deceased persons is uncharitable, since it implicitly excludes all the other blessed dead who are not being prayed for, and that the practice of requesting prayers for the dead by making financial contributions is a sort of bribery that corrupts the Church. ===Eighth conclusion: pilgrimages=== The eighth conclusion asserts that the practices of pilgrimage and the veneration of relics at best are ineffectual for spiritual merit and at worst approach idolatry in their worship of created objects. ===Ninth conclusion: confession=== The ninth conclusion asserts that the practice of confession for the absolution of sins is blasphemous, because only God has the power to forgive sins, and because if priests did have that power it would be cruel and uncharitable of them to withhold that forgiveness from anyone in the world, even if they refused to confess. ===Tenth conclusion: war, battle and crusades=== The tenth conclusion asserts that Christians should refrain from warfare, and in particular that wars given religious justifications, such as crusades, are blasphemous because Christ taught men to love and forgive their enemies. ===Eleventh conclusion: female vows of continence and abortion=== The eleventh conclusion asserts that women in the Church who have made vows of celibacy are having sex, becoming pregnant, and then seeking abortions to conceal the fact that they have broken their vows, a practice which the text strongly condemns. ===Twelfth conclusion: arts and crafts=== The twelfth conclusion asserts that Christians are devoting too much of their energy and attention to the making of beautiful objects of art and craft, and that people should simplify their lives and renew their devotion to godliness by refraining from unnecessary endeavors. == General Prologue to the Wycliffe Bible == The General Prologue of the Wycliffe BibleThe \\"General Prologue\\" is a 15-chapter explanation of translation policies and methodologies written by John Purvey in his revision of the translation done by John Wycliffe in the late 14th century.

It is located at , on the shore of Lake Burdur. Its estimated 2010 population is 78,389.Statistical Institute. ==History== === Ancient history === Whilst there is evidence of habitation in the province dating back to 6500 BC, the earliest sign of habitation in the city itself dates to Early Bronze Age. Artifacts from this period have been found in the site of today's railway station. In antiquity, the area was part of the region of Pisidia. It has been proposed that the city of Burdur has changed location a number of times; the ancient city of Limnombria (\\"Lake City\\") was closer to Lake Burdur than the modern city. It is known that in the Byzantine era, the city existed with the name Polydorion (), from which the current name is derived. No remains of Polydorion survive to this day. Burdur may also occupy the site of a town called Praetoria. === Turkish settlement and the Hamidids === The history of the urban development of Burdur is generally held to begin with the Turkish settlement after the Seljuq victory at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. In the late 11th century, the Kınalı tribe of the Oghuz Turks captured the Burdur area and settled there. Turks became the majority of the population of the area after 1211, establishing a number of villages in addition to expanding the town. The first Turkish settlement was in an area known as Hamam Bendi that had a lower elevation than today's city but was farther to the lake than the ancient town of Limnombria. These residents used the site of today's Grand Mosque of Burdur as an open marketplace, known as Alanpazarı. Realising the high incidence of malaria in the area they had settled, these residents then moved uphill, away from the lake. These first residents had not submitted to any state, but Kilij Arslan II, the Seljuq Sultan of Rum, captured the area in 1177 and imposed his sovereignty over the local tribes. The town remained under the undisputed sovereignty of the Sultanate of Rum between 1206 and 1260, when it was captured by the Mongol Empire. Developing commerce in the port of Antalya increased the significance of Burdur as a centre of commerce. Tragacanth obtained from the mountains of Psidia, wine from Kütahya, wax, wood and tar from many parts of Anatolia passed through Burdur, in exchange of which Egyptian spices, cotton and sugar was traded. In 1300, the Hamidids under Dündar Bey captured Burdur. Dündar Bey had the Grand Mosque of Burdur built around a hilly area in 1300, and the town subsequently developed around the mosque. The Hamidids administered Burdur as a district under the town of Eğirdir. The Ilkhanate then captured Burdur in 1324 under the governor of Anatolia, Timurtash. Dündar Bey's son, İshak Çelebi, recaptured Burdur in 1328. Traveller Ibn Battuta visited the town in 1330. In the account of his visit, he described Burdur as a town blessed with natural beauty and a number of orchards and farms, centred around the Burdur Castle near the Grand Mosque. No trace of the castle remains today except for the names of some of the streets, indicating that with the lack of a strategic requirement for a castle, it was gradually destroyed. The account also indicates the presence of a guild of ahis controlling commerce and production. By comparing the description of Burdur with the presentation of other cities such as Eğirdir, Isparta and Denizli, it can be deduced that Burdur was a relatively minor urban centre with limited commerce. It was, nevertheless, still a stop on the trade route between Konya, the cities of the Black Sea and the ports of the Aegean Sea. Burdur was captured by the Ottoman Empire in 1391, when Bayezid I conquered the Hamidids. It was initially a district centre and a small town under the Sanjak of Hamid. As of 1478, Burdur had four quarters, three being Muslim and one being Christian. The largest of these was the Cami (\\"Mosque\\") quarter of the Muslims. There was a small Greek population living in the city until the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey.An Abandoned Greek Church in the city has been turned into a museum with a giant dinosaur fossil a few years ago. ==Climate== Burdur has a hot summer mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csa) with continental influences, with cold, wet and often snowy winters and very hot, long and dry summers. ==Education== Mehmet Akif Ersoy University campus Mehmet Akif Ersoy University is located in Burdur. ==Notable residents== *Burdurlu Dervish Mehmed Pasha Ottoman Grand Vizier 1818-1820 *Burdurlu Ahmet Şükrü Pasha Ottoman Military Doctor, with major improvements in medical awards ==References== ==External links== *Governor's official website *Site with a few pictures *Very many pictures of the Archaeological Museum *Burdur News Category:Populated places in Burdur Province Category:Districts of Burdur Province ","title":"Burdur"},{"id":"2563676","text":"Jacques Borel (17 December 1925 in Paris - 25 September 2002) is a French author best known for his 1965 novel L'Adoration (translated into English as The Bond), which won the Prix Goncourt. ==Bibliography== * L'Adoration (1965) * Tata ou De l'Education (1967) * Le Retour (1970) * La Dépossession - Journal de Ligenère (1973) * Commentaires (1974) * Un Voyage ordinaire (1975) * Histoire de mes vieux habits (1979) * Poésie et nostalgie (1979) * Petite histoire de mes rêves (1981) * L'enfant voyeur (1987) * L'Attente.

An ambitious drummer, Johnny Cousin, wants to start his own band. He promises to persuade Delia to come out of retirement and resume performing, having been told that this is the only way his band will be backed. Told in no uncertain terms that Delia has no intention of resuming her career, Johnny begins a series of machinations at the party designed to make Rex believe that Delia has been having an affair with Cass, the band's manager. He even alters a tape recording to distort the meaning of Delia's private conversation. Johnny's back-stabbing costs Cass his job. Delia's performance of a song, rehearsed solely for the party, furthers Rex's suspicions that she is unhappy at home. Rex assaults Delia and makes public accusations about her fidelity.

Cohen, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 1989, p. 513-519 Vibudh Shridhar wrote Pasanahacariu in 1132 AD, which includes a historical account of Yoginipur (early Delhi near Mehrauli) then. In 1354, Firuz Shah Tughluq had started the construction of a new city near Agroha, called Hisar-e-Feroza (\\"the fort of Firuz\\"). Most of the raw material for building the town was brought from Agroha.The story of Hisar The town later came to be called Hisar. Hisar became a major center of the Agrawal community. Some Agrawals are also said to have moved to the Kotla Firoz Shah fort in Delhi, built by Firuz Shah Tughlaq. ===Migration to Rajput kingdoms=== Many marwari farmer migrated from Rajasthan. They form large fraction of the merchant population of Shekhawati region. Along with Maheshwari, Khandelwal and Oswals, they form the Marwari farmer community. In the early 15th century, Agrawals (sweet maker) flourished as a Halwai trader community, under the Tomaras of Gwalior.Kashtha Sangha Bhattarakas of Gwalior and Agrawal Shravakas, Dr. K. C. Jain According to several Sanskrit inscription at the Gwalior Fort in Gwalior District, several traders (Sanghavi Kamala Simha, Khela Brahmachari, Sandhadhip Namadas etc.) belonging to Agrotavansha (Agrawal clan) supported the sculptures and carving of idols at the place. Historian K.C. Jain comments: In 15th century, many NonAgrawals farmer migrated to Amber kingdom (now Jaipur). In VS 1535, Agrawal Nenasi conducted a pratishtha ceremony at Sanganer.Jain Inscriptions of Rajasthan, R.V. Somani, 1982 A copy of Amarsen Chariu copied in VS 1577 at Sonipat was found at Amber, suggesting that Agrawals took sacred texts with them during this migration.Amarasena Chariu, Dr. Kasturchand Jain Suman, 1990 ===Migration to Eastern India=== Later, during the Mughal rule, and during the British East India Company administration, some Agrawals migrated to Bihar and Calcutta, who became the major component of the Marwaris.Anne Hardgrove, Community and Public Culture: The Marwaris in Calcutta, New Delhi, Oxford University Press (2004) ==Notable Agrawals== Agrawals are a successful community with representation in almost all spheres. While they are generally present in business and politics, the community has produced a lot of successful scientists, inventors, authors, etc. ==Gotras== Historically, there has been no unanimity regarding number and names of gotras, and there are regional differences between the list of gotras. The Akhil Bhartiya Agrawal Sammelan, a major organization of Agrawals, has created with a standardized list of gotras, which was adopted as an official list by a vote at the organization's 1983 convention. Because the classification of any particular gotra as \\"half\\" is considered insulting, the Sammelan provides a list of following 18 gotras: The existence of all the gotras mentioned in the list is controversial, and the list does not include several existing clans such as Kotrivala, Pasari, Mudgal, Tibreval, and Singhla. == See also == * Agrawal Jain == References == Notes Citations == Further reading == * Category:Bania communities Category:Indian family names Category:Social groups of Rajasthan Category:Social groups of Haryana Category:Social groups of Delhi Category:Social groups of Uttar Pradesh Category:Social groups of Punjab, India Category:Social groups of Himachal Pradesh Category:Social groups of Uttarakhand Category:Hindu surnames Category:Jain surnames ","title":"Agrawal"},{"id":"2563754","text":"An Acrisol is a Reference Soil Group of the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB).

He was a major representative of philanthropinism and the German Enlightenment. ==Life== Born to the merchant Burchard Hilmar Campe and the preacher's daughter Anna Margaretha Campe (née Gosler) on 29 June 1746, Campe grew up in the village of Deensen in Lower Saxony. After visiting the convent school in nearby Holzminden from 1760 to 1765, he was granted a scholarship and went to study Protestant theology in Helmstedt. His support for his teacher Wilhelm Abraham Teller, whose ideas on an enlightened Christianity were criticised by orthodox theologians, cost Campe his scholarship. He then left Helmstedt and continued his studies of theology in Halle, where he went to lectures of another critical theologian, Johann Salomo Semler. After his studies, Campe moved to Berlin as a private tutor to the Humboldt family. After being a preacher in Potsdam in 1773 and having been given the task of creating an education programme for the Prussian crown prince, he returned to Tegel and briefly tutored Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt, who both stayed in contact with him afterwards. On request of Franz, Duke of Dessau, he joined Johann Bernhard Basedow's Philanthropinum, a teaching institute in Dessau. Because of a disagreement, Campe left before a year was up and went to Hamburg, where he started his own teaching institute based on a family model. Next to tutoring he was active as a writer and published several works for children. His Robinson der Jüngere was published in 1779/80 and the trilogy Die Entdeckung von Amerika followed in 1781/82. Another product of this time was the Allgemeine Revision des gesammten Schul- und Erziehungswesens (1785-1791), a 16-volume work edited by Campe which aimed at being the most complete and sophisticated standard work of educational literature. Among other texts it contains annotated translations of John Locke’s Some Thoughts Concerning Education (1693) and Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s Emile, or On Education (1762). After four years Campe handed his teaching institute over to Ernst Christian Trapp to dedicate more of his time to writing. In 1786 he was called to Braunschweig by Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, to reform the Braunschweig school system along with Trapp and Johann Stuve. Although his proposals were defeated through conservative opposition, he stayed and in 1787 founded his own publishing house, the Braunschweigische Schulbuchhandlung. Especially because of Campe's own works, the Schulbuchhandlung became economically very successful, and in 1808 he handed it over to his son-in-law, Friedrich Vieweg. Intrigued by the political movements in France in 1789, Campe and his former pupil Wilhelm von Humboldt travelled to Paris. Campe witnessed the session of the assemblée nationale during which a majority verdict withdrew the privileges from the aristocratic and clerical estates. However, his sympathy for the French Revolution and his being granted honorary French citizenship in 1792 — along with, among others, George Washington and Friedrich Schiller — was not welcomed by many at home. In his last years, Campe devoted his time to the German language. His language purism is evident in for instance finding German terms for loanwords and the compilation of a German dictionary. For some this linguistic enterprise relates to Campe’s wish to enlighten the people and change society by focusing on words that the common people would understand; other biographers see the focus on the German language as a patriotic endeavour. He died, aged 72, in Braunschweig on 22 October 1818. ==Children's writer== Campe is counted among the founding fathers of the modern genre of intentional or specific children’s and youth literature, along with the writers Christian Felix Weiße and Christian Gotthilf Salzmann. He created a series of works for children and adolescents that were each supposed to be educational, pleasant and directed at a specific age group. His publications ranged from alphabet books to a collection of translated and own travelogues, and to guidance or conduct books for boys and girls. Probably his best-known work is his Robinson der Jüngere (1779/80), a free adaptation of Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe (1719) based on Rousseau's suggestions in his Émile. For Reinhard Stach, Robinson was Campe's fate, while for Winfred Kaminski it presents the peak of philanthropinist pedagogy. The book became very popular and was published more than a hundred times in the 19th century. It was translated into English as Robinson the Younger in 1781/82 and into many other European and non European languages. In many languages, it was the first published children's book. After Robinson, Campe published Die Entdeckung von Amerika (1781/82), which both marked the transition from children's to youth literature, while helping to define youth literature as a genre. == Language purism == Campe developed approx. 11,500 translations for foreign words, of which about 300 survived. They include: * altertümlich (for antik) * Erdgeschoss (Parterre) * Esslust (Appetit) * Feingefühl (Takt) * fortschrittlich (progressiv) * herkömmlich (konventionell) * Hochschule (Universität) * Lehrgang (Kursus) * Randbemerkung (Glosse) * Streitgespräch (Debatte) * tatsächlich (faktisch) * Voraussage (Prophezeiung) * Wust (Chaos) * Zerrbild (Karikatur) Among the translations that did not survive are: * Zwangsgläubiger (Katholik) * Freigläubiger (Protestant) * Heiltümelei (Reliquie) * Menschenschlachter (Soldat) * Meuchelpuffer (Pistole) == Works == * Philosophische Gespräche über die unmittelbare Bekanntmachung der Religion und über einige unzulängliche Beweisarten derselben (1773) * Allgemeine Revision des gesamten Schul- und Erziehungswesens von einer Gesellschaft praktischer Erzieher (1785-1792) * Briefe aus Paris (1790) * Geschichte der französischen Staatsumwälzung (1792) * Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache (1807 ff.) == Works for Children and Young Adults == * Kleine Kinderbibliothek (1779-1784) * Robinson der Jüngere (1779/80) * Kleine Seelenlehre für Kinder (1780) * Die Entdeckung von Amerika (1781/82) * Theophron oder Der erfahrne Rathgeber für die unerfahrne Jugend (1783) * Erste Sammlung interessanter und durchgängig zweckmäßig abgefasster Reisebeschreibungen für die Jugend (1785-1793, 12 volumes) * Väterlicher Rath für meine Tochter.

It is situated in Hisar district in between Hisar city and Fatehabad on NH 09. Ancient structures, pot-shards, coins and seals have been found in archaeological excavations at the Agroha Mound. The Agrawal and Agrahari communities claim origin from Agroha. According to their legends, Agroha was the capital of their founder Agrasena. ==Early history== Agroha remained an important centre of commerce and political activity till the period of Feroze Shah Tughluq as it was situated on the ancient trade route between Taxila and Mathura. Earlier excavations proved the potentiality of the site and its ancient name 'Agrodaka', headquarters of a Janapada. The Agroha mound goes back to the 3rd century BC and is where Harappan coins were discovered apart from stone sculptures, terracotta seals, iron and copper implements, shells and a host of other things. Recent excavations have yielded five cultural periods ranging from circa fourth century to fourteenth century AD. The excavations have also revealed two ancient shrines namely a Buddhist stupa and a Hindu temple. ==Demographics== As of 2011 India census, Agroha had a population of 7722 in 1491 households. Males (4068) constitute 52.68% of the population and females (3654) 47.31%.

A huge Temple of Maharaja Agrasen, Mata Lakshmi (Kuldevi of Agarwal and traders community) and Mata Saraswati was constructed there and which was inaugurated Rajiv Gandhi. Subsequently, Banarsi Das Gupta's initiatives led to the formation of Agroha Development Board. In first ever meeting, a decision was taken that in the name of Maharaja Agrasen \\"Maharaja Agrasen Medical College\\" will be established in Agroha. It was Shri Gupta’s persistence that the Haryana Government released 267 acres of land to the Agarwal Society for the Medical College, for just Re. 1 in lease. The Government also make an agreement with the society under which the Government decided to bear 50% of the development amount, and to hand over the managements to the Agarwal Society while contributing 99% of the maintenance fee; once the Medical College is developed. The remaining 1% is to be borne by the Agarwal Society. It was this agreement which increased the momentum of the development of the Medical College and the AGROHA. Maharaja Agrasen Medical College, Agroha was established in 1994. During the last 20 years Agroha Vikas Trust has done a lot of development of this Holy town, and a modern lodging and boarding facility is now available. A number of temples have been constructed in the Complex, including the Sheetla mata temple and Hanuman temple. ==Famous residents== * Agroha is the birthplace of Best Wrestler of India Geetika Jakhar who won silver medal at Asian Games held at Doha in 2006 also a Bronze at Asian Games 2014 and a Silver at Commonwealth Games 2014 . * Agroha is the birthplace of the athlete Krishna Poonia who won gold medal after 52 years in the discus throw in the Commonwealth Games 2010 held in Delhi. she is the first indian women who won gold meadle in track & fields events .

She was the first female full professor in psychology in the history of Yale University. She established core resources for the study of development, including the Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study and the Minnesota Adolescent Adoption Study. She served as president of multiple societies including the Association for Psychological Science and was honoured with multiple awards including the James McKeen Cattell Fellow Award. She was also active in the development of commercial childcare. Her work with twins in the 1960s revealed strong genetic influences on intellectual development. One of her key findings was that this differed with race and socioeconomic status (SES), with poor and non-white children showing less genetic influence on their IQ and more environmental influence. She demonstrated a successful intervention in premature infants, showing that stimulation improved their health and developmental outcomes. At Minnesota, she and Richard A. Weinberg found that black and interracial children adopted early into white homes initially had outcomes more similar to the white average, suggesting a role of family environment early in life. By their teens, adoptees with two black birth parents achieved lower scores than did adoptees with one or no black birth parents, suggesting a genetic component to race differences in IQ. Along with the Scarr-Rowe effect of socio-economic status on the heritability of intelligence, another key intellectual landmark established by Scarr was that \\"Rather than the home environment having a cumulative impact across development, its influence wanes from early childhood to adolescence.\\" She sought also to advance scientific psychology, and in 1991 co-founded Current Directions In Psychological Science. She retired to, and continues to live in Hawaii. == Biography == Scarr was the child of school teacher Jane Powell Wood and John Ruxton Wood, a US Army physician, who in 1942 was appointed director of Army Research Laboratories at Edgewood Arsenal and who in 1950 headed the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. Scarr spent most of her childhood in the Chesapeake Bay area and went to the Bryn Mawr School for Girls and the National Cathedral School. After completing her undergraduate studies at Vassar College in 1958, where she was involved in undergraduate research with Harriet Zuckerman, Scarr worked for a couple of years first at a family and child service and then at National Institute of Mental Health as a research assistant. In 1960 she enrolled at Harvard University, from where she earned her Ph.D. in psychology in 1965, specializing in developmental psychology and behavioural genetics. During graduate school, she married fellow sociology student Harry Scarr with whom she has a son, Phillip (1962). Though she initially had a difficult time finding a job because she had a child, she eventually taught at the University of Maryland, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Minnesota, and Yale University. She was the first woman full professor in psychology in the history of Yale University. In 1983 she accepted a position as Commonwealth Professor and chair of the psychology department at the University of Virginia, where she remained until her retirement.O'Connell AN (2001).Models of Achievement: Reflections of Eminent Women in Psychology, Vol.3. London: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. pp. 97-112 (Autobiographical Perspectives) In 1990, Scarr was invited to join the Board of the KinderCare Learning Centers, the nation's largest child care company. In 1993, she was elected chairman of the Board and in 1995 became CEO and chairman of KinderCare. While at KinderCare, Scarr instituted NAEYC accreditation for the centers and worked to improve the wages and working conditions of center staffs. In 1997, KinderCare was bought by Kohlberg, Kravitz, and Roberts Investments, and Scarr retired. In the 1960s, Scarr studied identical and fraternal twins' aptitude and school achievement scores. The study revealed that intellectual development was heavily influenced by genetic ability, especially among more advantaged children. It also showed that on average, black children demonstrated less genetic and more environmental influence on their intelligence than white children. Scarr also collaborated with Margaret Williams on a clinical study which demonstrated that premature birth infants who receive stimulation gain weight faster and recover faster than babies left in isolation (the practice at that time). In 1972 she married fellow researcher Philip Salapatek, with whom she also coauthored papers. They had a daughter, Stephanie (November 1973). They moved to Minnesota, where Scarr started working with Richard A. Weinberg, on the Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study. This study concluded that black and interracial children adopted early into white homes had IQ and school achievement scores that averaged similar to those of white children. In another adoption study, Minnesota Adolescent Adoption Study, Scarr and Weinberg showed that adolescents, adopted in the first few months of life, did not resemble their adoptive parents or other children adopted into the same family. In Scarr's words: \\"Rather than the home environment having a cumulative impact across development, its influence wanes from early childhood to adolescence.\\" (emphasis in original). As of 1995, the study was among the largest of its kind in the United States, together with the Colorado Adoption Project and the Texas Adoption Project; its results had seen some replication. Scarr served as President of the Society for Research in Child Development, the Association for Psychological Science, the Council of Graduate Departments of Psychology, and the Behavior Genetics Association. She was elected to the American Psychological Association's Board of Directors in 1988, but resigned in 1990. Scarr was also a founding member of the American Psychological Society (now the Association for Psychological Science) and was chief executive officer of KinderCare Learning Centers from 1995 to 1997. Scarr was honored by her colleagues with research awards: Distinguished Contributions to Research on Public Policy (American Psychological Association), James McKeen Cattell Award (Association for Psychological Science), and the Dobzhansky Award for Lifetime Achievement (Behavior Genetics Association). She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, American Association for the Advancement of Science, and other scientific societies. In 1991, together with C. Randy Gallistel she co-founded the journal Current Directions In Psychological Science. In 1995, she was a signatory of a collective statement titled \\"Mainstream Science on Intelligence\\", written by Linda Gottfredson and published in The Wall Street Journal.Gottfredson, Linda (December 13, 1994). Mainstream Science on Intelligence. The Wall Street Journal, p A18. Scarr wrote a mixed review of The Bell Curve, agreeing with the general presentation of the data, disagreeing about some specific issues of interpretation, and disapproving of the book's policy recommendations. Scarr also disapproved of Hans Eysenck's book Race, Intelligence and Education, which she described as \\"generally inflammatory\\" and insulting to \\"almost everyone except WASPs and Jews\\". In 1991, together with Claire Ernhart, Scarr was involved as an expert witness on behalf of the lead industry in the lawsuit United States v. Sharon Steel Corp., on the opposite side of Herbert Needleman who was testifying for the U.S. Justice Department owing to his research on the relationship between lead exposure and IQ. The federal court asked Scarr and Ernhart to examine the research of Herbert Needleman to determine whether or not it supported his claims. After reviewing his data collection and analyses, Scarr and Ernhart filed charges of scientific misconduct against Needleman with the National Institutes of Health. NIH forwarded the complaint to the University of Pittsburgh, which found that Needleman didn't \\"fabricate, falsify or plagiarize\\", but a Preliminary Inquiry Panel said it could not exclude the possibility that \\"misrepresentation\\" had occurred. When the trial was declared open to the public, Scarr initially refused to come and later when she was persuaded she constantly refused to answer questions. Scarr received money from the lead industry for consulting services which creates a conflict of interest. Scarr retired to Hawaii in 1997, where she learned scuba diving, even obtaining a rescue diver certification. She also traveled \\"a lot, especially on cruise ships\\". ==Publications== *Scarr S.

It was established on 5 February 1958 by a decree of the national government. Its first director was Nobel Laureate Bernardo A. Houssay. Governed by a board independent from the federal government, it funds scientific research in three basic ways. Firstly, it gives grants for collective work to research teams of well-recognized scientists of every discipline, including social sciences and the humanities. Secondly, it has a payroll of about 6,500 researchers and 2,500 technicians working as employees in different categories, from investigador asistente (assistant researcher) to investigador principal (main researcher). Thirdly, it grants scholarships for doctoral and post-doctoral studies to 8,500 young researchers from Argentina and other countries. ==Ranking== In 2017, CONICET was ranked as the best Latin American government research institution by the Scimago Institutions Ranking and the 2nd among all research institutions in the region after the Universidade de São Paulo. At the global level, CONICET holds the position 40th among the most prestigious 5000 research institutions worldwide (including universities, governmental and private research institutions, research councils, etc.). ==ReferencesCondiciones para acceder a una beca y a la carrera Category:Scientific organisations based in Argentina Category:Government agencies of Argentina Category:Research councils Category:Members of the International Council for Science ","title":"National Scientific and Technical Research Council"},{"id":"2563841","text":"The Namaqua chameleon (Chamaeleo namaquensis) is a ground-living lizard found in the western desert regions of Namibia, South Africa and southern Angola.Branch, B. (1988). A Field Guide to the Snakes and other Reptiles of Southern Africa. . == General Anatomy == Threat display, Namib-Naukluft National ParkChamaeleo namaquensis is one of the largest chameleon species in southern Africa, and reaches up to 25 cm in length. Females are the larger sex, although males are proportionately more robust and have larger heads and head ornamentation, as well as a bulge under the tail base due to the presence of hemipenes. Its tail is far shorter than its body and those of other arboreal species of chameleon, as an adaptation to its primarily terrestrial habitat. It has large dorsal spines and a prominent, pointed casque on the back of its head, however it lacks the neck flap of other Chamaeleo species. Like many chameleons, this species has nasal salt glands which excretes excess minerals such as sodium chloride and potassium. It has hygroscopic skin, and shares a feature with some other lizards (thorny devil, Texas horned lizard, Saara hardwickii, and the giant girdled lizard) in that it can drink moisture in contact with its scales through capillary action. === Thermoregulation === Although capable of changing colour, this chameleon is usually some shade of grey or brown with several lighter patches on the flank, dark patches below the dorsal ridge and yellow or red striping on the throat. This ability aids in thermoregulation, becoming black in the cooler morning to absorb heat more efficiently, then a lighter grey color to reflect light during the heat of the day — or showing both colors at the same time, neatly separated left from right by the spine. Like most desert animals, it is adapted to high environmental temperatures, but can also tolerate periods of low temperatures. Although temperature varies throughout the year, the natural habitat of this species has a yearly average coastal temperature of 19.3C in the air, and 26.6-31.8C on the substrate surface. Further inland, air temperature averages at 24.1C while substrate temperatures average between 30-34.5C. ==Distribution== This chameleon species occurs naturally throughout the arid western part of southern Africa, and is particularly common in the Namib Desert. It is recorded as far south as Sutherland, in the Western Cape, South Africa, and as far north as southern Angola. In the furthest eastern edge of its range, in eastern Namibia, it overlaps with the natural range of its relative, the flap-necked chameleon. Within its natural range, it inhabits arid and semi-arid areas, such as Karoo shrubland, sandy desert and gravel plains, even foraging in intertidal zones. It is terrestrial, and is usually seen walking along the ground, although young are often found climbing. ==Behaviour== === Feeding habits === Namaqua chameleon showing long tongue by catching a beetle Unlike the arboreal chameleons of the genus Chamaeleo, its tail is not prehensile, but otherwise it still hunts in the same way, slowly stalking its prey and catching it with its long tongue. Unusually for a chameleon, they will also chase down prey attempting to flee and will sometimes seize them with their jaws rather than with their tongue. Namaqua chameleons primarily feed on insects, eating mostly tenebrionid beetles and to a lesser extent oedipodine grasshoppers. They will occasionally feed on lizards (including young chameleons of their own species), snakes, and various other arthropods. In one case exceptional case, an individual was seen catching and killing a Peringuey's adder twice its own length. They mostly hunt their prey in sandy dunes and rocky areas, but some coastal populations also forage for marine arthropods in intertidal zones, making it the only chameleon species to do so. Although typically feeding on live prey, in captivity they can sometimes be weaned onto dead food items. When hunting potentially dangerous prey, individuals quickly learn to disable its weapons first (biting the heads of snakes and lizards, the fangs of spiders, the stingers of scorpions and hymenopterans, etc) before finally dispatching and consuming it. This species also regularly consumes plant matter in the wild, and is one of several chameleon species recorded doing so. Plant matter may account for up to 29.1% of their diet amongst coastal populations and 20% amongst those inland, although an average of 2.8% for coastal and 1.5% for inland populations are more common. Of plant material, the \\"fleshy parts\\" of Zygophyllum stapffi are most commonly eaten. In captivity, plant matter is still consumed, especially succulents, but less frequently than in the wild. This suggests that the species may actually be an omnivorous chameleon, which is further supported by the presence of potassium in the excretions of the nasal glands as is the case with herbivorous lizards. Inorganic material such as small stones, gravel, and sand are also ingested. They account for as much as 30% of the diet in coastal populations and 1.1% in inland populations, although an average of 6.2% and 0.5% is more common, respectively. It has been suggested that inorganic material may help with digestion or removing parasites. Regarding the former explanation, coastal populations which ingest more plant material also ingest more inorganic material. This species has a high metabolic rate and is voracious, often feeding until the stomach has been completely filled, and immediately begins feeding again after food has traveled to the small intestine. Individuals in the wild are usually found gorged to the limit; an adult has an average of 12 meals a day, each meal usually consisting of about 19-23 large darkling beetles. This is a reflection of food in the Namib Desert being highly abundant and constantly available; a condition that is difficult to replicate in captivity. As a result, captive individuals do not grow as fast as they do in the wild. ==== Water ==== Water is of critical importance to Namaqua chameleons, which drink dew water and fog condensation on surfaces such as vegetation, rocks, and sand. Heavy fog rolling in from the ocean occurs most days of the year through much of their habitat, being present in the mornings and afternoons, but occasionally persisting through the entire day. They also obtain moisture content from food, especially darkling beetles and plant matter. However, they can also drink water through capillary action; small channels in the scales can transport water across the body. In an experiment, dyed water placed on the side of its body visibly moved to its back and towards the head and tail. The chameleon then turned its head and drank the water that collected on its body. More unusually for a desert reptile, it has an extraordinarily small bladder that is nearly useless for storing water. Furthermore, little storage space for water is available in the gut as it is typically filled with food. It appears that this is because sufficient water is readily available through regular fogs, food, and the cloaca reabsorbing moisture from urine, the latter which is aided by the salt glands removing excess minerals. Additionally, as a reptile, its rate of loss of water is far lower than in mammals and can also obtain relatively more water from the protein degradation of food. However, this species must have a regular source of drinking water other than its food and humidity in order to survive. ===Predation=== Namaqua chameleons are preyed upon by jackals, hawks, and eagles, and possibly monitor lizards. Similar to other chameleon species in areas near human habitation, it falls victim to introduced predators such as domestic cats, dogs and foxes. This species runs fast for a chameleon however and will do so to evade potential danger. It will also defend itself by quickly turning black, inflating the body and gular pouch, hissing, and gaping the bright yellow mouth in an attempt to startle the threat to buy enough time to flee. If cornered, it will charge and try to bite the attacker with its powerful jaws, and if successful, violently rips and tears at the flesh without letting go. === Social === Namaqua chameleons become fiercely territorial upon reaching adulthood, and begin to maintain vast territories. Territorial conflicts when territories overlap are common. Such conflicts between same sex individuals are far more common, but male-female conflicts occur as well. Females are larger and more aggressive than males; as a result, territorial disputes between females are somewhat more common than in males. Nevertheless, females hold far smaller territories than males. The average territory size of females is 868m² amongst inland and 382m² amongst coastal populations. Males hold territories averaging 1250m² amongst inland and 1718m² amongst coastal populations. During such conflicts, individuals often severely injure each other. After mating, the individual holding the territory will forcefully evict the other. Juveniles meanwhile are not seen as a territorial threat by adults and are in this respect ignored. Juveniles do not hold territories and have a shifting home range, and as such will even sleep with other juveniles when given the opportunity. While territories cannot be held in captivity, they are known to defend resting and nesting areas of about 35cm in diameter in captive settings. However, the defence of immediate nesting sites occurs only in captivity.Namaqua chameleon in the Namib Desert ==== Reproduction ==== Breeding can occur at any point in the year, after which eggs spend a gestation period of 35-45 days inside the mother. Adult females lay around 2-3 clutches of eggs a year, although occasionally may lay up to 4. Each clutch consists of 10-13 eggs, but may be as large as 22 eggs or as little as 6. Eggs are buried under loose gravel and in a layer of moist sand, as dried sand shrivels up the eggs. Sometimes an extension of their resting burrow may be excavated for egg laying. Such behaviour may indicate a level of parental care of eggs due to the close proximity of the eggs to the parent throughout incubation. In the wild, a 20-25cm deep burrow is excavated, and the eggs are laid in the burrow at a depth of 15cm to reach the damp layer of sand. In captive settings, eggs may be buried about 10cm under the substrate. Groups of 6-8 eggs are laid in layers, with one layer being buried before laying another directly above. Excavation and laying last 8-10 hours. Unusually in captive settings, other chameleons of either sex may assist in covering the hole after laying. Eggs have a gestation period of 35-45 days inside the mother, and take about 100 days to hatch after being laid. Compared to adults, young prefer and are more skilled at climbing. Females become sexually mature by 150 days, and males by 210 days. Like many chameleons and other lizards, females can store sperm after mating once so that more fertile eggs may be laid months later. Laying is taxing on females and depletes their fat reserves. Females subsequently eat as much as the stomach capacity allows. In captive settings, females should be allowed to eat as much as they want after laying. Due to the especially advanced state of embryos and eggs by the time they are laid, it has been suggested that this species is in the process of evolving ovoviviparity.  Courtship  During courtship, adults adopt a mottled and spotted colouration. Like some iguanids, only recently ovulated females are receptive to mating. Non-receptive females will attack males attempting to mate, and the size disparity often causes serious injury or even death of the male. === Burrowing === Unlike more arboreal chameleon species, Namaqua chameleon often utilize burrows as retreats. Sometimes they will take advantage of abandoned rodent burrows, but will often excavate their own as well. ==Conservation== Namaqua chameleons are listed as CITES II. In 2012, the filming of the Mad Max sequel Fury Road caused damage to Namaqua chameleon habitat in Dorob National Park and Namib-Naukluft National Park. ==References== Category:Chamaeleo Category:Lizards of Africa Category:Reptiles of Angola Category:Reptiles of Namibia Category:Reptiles of South Africa Category:Reptiles described in 1831 Category:Taxa named by Andrew Smith (zoologist) ","title":"Namaqua chameleon"},{"id":"2563849","text":"The Schumacher Fusion is an on-road 1:10 scale nitro-powered radio-controlled car made by Schumacher Racing Products.

The company provides educational programs for children from six weeks to 12 years old. KinderCare is the third-largest privately held company headquartered in Oregon. In 39 states and the District of Columbia, some 200,000 children are enrolled in more than 1,600 early childhood education community centers, over 600 before- and-after school programs, and over 100 employer-sponsored centers. ==History== ===Founding=== Perry Mendel, a real estate developer, founded Kinder-Care Nursery Schools after speculating that increasing numbers of women entering the workforce would increase demand for preschool child care. The first facility was opened on July 14, 1969 accommodating 70 children. A second facility was opened in 1970, and the company changed its name to Kinder-Care Learning Centers, Inc. By 1971, 19 centers were in operation and the first infant care was offered.One of the company's schools in Hillsboro, Oregon The firm went public in 1972; by 1974, the company had 60 centers located in 17 states and over 500 employees nationwide. The company's first major acquisition came in 1977, when it purchased the 15 facilities of Playcare. In 1979, it acquired Mini-Skools, Living and Learning, and American Pre-Schools. In 1985, the company opened its 1,000th center. In 1987, it reported annual revenues of $900 million, and analysts were remarking on the company's rapid growth, observing that stock had soared from 12 cents a share to $20 at its high in mid-1987. During this time, Kinder-Care was expanding at the rate of one new center every three days. In 1987, Kinder-Care acquired Sylvan Learning Centers, a provider of supplemental instruction to children and adults, and the largest franchiser of its kind. In 1992, the company updated its bell tower logo and removed the hyphen in the spelling of Kinder-Care. === KinderCare Education === KinderCare uses low teacher-to-student ratios that allow teachers to focus on the individual learning styles and needs of each child. Teacher-to-student ratios increase with each age group. For example, the teacher-to-student ratio in preschool classrooms is one teacher to twelve students, higher than other childcare facilities in the area. For example, La Petite Academy has a teacher-to-student ratio of one teacher to eight students in the preschool classroom. KinderCare offers a developmentally appropriate and comprehensive curriculum for children in each age groups. Each hour of the day is scheduled, even transitions from one activity to the next are laid out in the curriculum provided to the teachers. Two week units are built around themes that will interest the child. The lesson plans and activities support the physical, cognitive, and social-emotional development of the children. Daily lesson plans are given to teachers to complete in the classroom with the children. The format of the lesson plans are rigid to ensure children receive the same education in order to achieve universal success. Activities are required to be displayed on boards that are expected to change each week. KinderCare offers programming for school-age children, as well. KinderCare provides door-to-door transportation for children to and from school. Full-day care for summer, winter, and fall break is offered for school-age children as well. School-aged children typically spend two hours before and after school at KinderCare centers. The KinderCare school-age curriculum focuses on social- emotional development in order to support children in becoming the kindest, most capable, and most resilient version of themselves. Daily lesson plans and activities are expected to be completed, including STEM projects, creative arts projects, despite the limited hours. ===Bankruptcy=== In the 1980s, Kinder-Care acquired a wide variety of companies such as American Savings for $188 million. They also purchased photo studios, shoe stores and even invested in a foreign fertilizer manufacturer. Chief Executive Grassgreen, informed by Michael Milken, an investor from the firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert, led the company on an ill-conceived diversification plan in the late 1980s. As a result, the company's debt load increased from $10 million to about $620 million in 1988. The company found itself in deep financial trouble after the stock market crash in October 1987. During this period, Tull Gearreald, an investment banker, took command of the company as president and CEO. Caught in a cash squeeze in January 1991, Kinder-Care stopped paying interest on its debt. Still faltering under its high debt load, KinderCare filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on November 10, 1992. The company continued operating, although, according to a 1988 Forbes article, less than half of Kinder-Care's sales and profits for the year were expected to come from its child care centers. In January 1993, in a move that helped their balance sheet, KinderCare sold off Sylvan Learning Centers for $8 million. ===Post-2000 financial history=== KinderCare was acquired in 2005 by the Knowledge Learning Corporation (KLC) division of Michael Milken's privately held education services firm, Knowledge Universe. The deal, valued at over US$1 billion, made KLC the nation’s largest private child care and education provider. In 2012, company revenues were $1.45 billion, down from $1.6 billion in 2010. In July 2015, Partners Group, a Swiss enterprise, bought Knowledge Universe. Knowledge Universe renamed itself as KinderCare Education in January 2016. The parent company, KinderCare Education, also operates Knowledge Beginnings, Children’s Creative Learning Centers (CCLC), and Champions. ===COVID-19 response=== During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, KinderCare shut down 1100 of their approximately 1500 daycare centers, leaving the centers that have large proportions of first responders and healthcare workers. ==Accreditation== The National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) and other associations have accredited over 700 KLC centers. ==See also== * List of companies based in Oregon ==References== ==External links== * KinderCare Learning Centers – Official Site Category:Child care companies Category:Education companies established in 1969 Category:Privately held companies based in Oregon Category:Early childhood education Category:1969 establishments in Alabama ","title":"KinderCare Learning Centers"},{"id":"2563863","text":"The Robert Treat Paine Estate, known as Stonehurst, is a country house set on in Waltham, Massachusetts. It was designed for philanthropist Robert Treat Paine in a collaboration between architect Henry Hobson Richardson and landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. It is located at 100 Robert Treat Paine Drive. Since 1974 the estate has been owned by the City of Waltham and its grounds kept as a public park, and is believed to be the only residential collaboration by Richardson and Olmsted that is open to the public. The Great Hall ==History== In 1866, Boston lawyer Robert Treat Paine Jr. and his wife Lydia (Lyman) commissioned architect Gridley James Fox Bryant to build a mansarded Second Empire summer house in Waltham. The house and its site were paid for by George Lyman, Lydia's father and owner of an adjacent summer residence, the Lyman Estate. This house was deemed too small for the Paines and their seven children. In October 1883, Richardson and Olmsted made their first visit to the property to discuss relocating the house and expanding it. In July 1884, Olmsted and Richardson produced sketches for a new site atop a rocky ridge with sweeping views to the southeast. In the spring of 1885, construction began while the Paine family traveled to Europe with Phillips Brooks, a family friend and pastor of Trinity Church in Boston. When Richardson died at age 47 in April 1886, the commission was close to completion. The terrace and some interior finishes were completed over the summer. Robert Treat Paine Jr. died in 1910, and the Paine family continued to occupy the house until the mid-1960s. In 1974 Theodore Lyman Storer donated the property to the city of Waltham. Episode #2104 of This Old House featured a tour of the estate. ==See also== *List of National Historic Landmarks in Massachusetts *National Register of Historic Places listings in Waltham, Massachusetts ==References== ==Bibliography== *Margaret Henderson Floyd, \\"H.

The festival's current state is in question and did not make a return in 2008. However, the festival may make its return in the near future. A.C. Entertainment and Superfly instead focused their energy on a new festival in San Francisco, the Outside Lands Festival. ==Vegoose 2007== The third annual installment of this dynamic entertainment experience took place in Las Vegas over Halloween weekend at Sam Boyd Stadium on Saturday, October 27 and Sunday, October 28. 'Vegoose at Night,' a series of nighttime concerts, presented a variety of artists at marquee venues throughout the city starting on Friday, October 26 and running through Sunday, October 28. The popularity of the event directly affected Vegoose's future. After a decline in attendance in 2006, AC stated in the Las Vegas Review Journal that there had to be an improvement. The official attendance was 40,000 for both days (32,000 in 2006).Vegoose Website Executive Producer: Stephen Warner, Directed by: Keith Hobelman. ===Line up=== Rage Against The Machine at Vegoose 2007 *Rage Against the Machine *Daft Punk *Iggy & the Stooges performing the album Fun House *Muse *The Shins *Cypress Hill *Queens of the Stone Age *moe. *Public Enemy *Michael Franti & Spearhead *Sound Tribe Sector 9 *Umphrey's McGee *Thievery Corporation *M.I.A. *Mastodon *Robert Randolph and the Family Band *Ghostface Killah & The Rhythm Roots Allstars *Blonde Redhead *Gogol Bordello *U.N.K.L.E. *Ghostland Observatory *Pharoahe Monch *Battles *Lupe Fiasco *Animal Liberation Orchestra *Atmosphere *Infected Mushroom *Federico Aubele Vegoose at Night: * Thievery Corporation Friday, Oct 26th House of Blues *moe.

Since 1954, he has played both leading and supporting roles in over 200 film and television productions, among them the 1979 Oscar-winning film The Tin Drum. He is also the author of several successful mostly autobiographical books. ==Biography== Adorf was born in Zürich, Switzerland, the illegitimate child of an Italian surgeon and a German medical assistant. He grew up in his maternal grandfather's hometown, Mayen, where he was raised by his unmarried mother. He rose to fame in Europe, and particularly Germany, and also made appearances in international films, including Ten Little Indians and Smilla's Sense of Snow. He also played a small role in the BBC adaptation of John le Carré's Smiley's People as a German club owner. In Italy he also played in a number of movies. In the 1960's, he married Lis Verhoeven. The couple had a child, Stella, prior to their divorce. He starred with Barbara Bouchet in Milano Calibro 9 in 1972. In 1985, he married Monique Faye. Adorf remains very active in German shows, television and theatre. Adorf still regrets that he refused parts in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972) and Billy Wilder's One, Two, Three (1961). He also turned down the role of General Mapache in Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch (1969), because he felt the character was too violent. In 1996, he provided the German dubbing voice for the character Draco in Dragonheart, a role performed by Sean Connery. == Awards == Among many others: * 2000 Bavarian Film Awards Honorary Award * 2011 Best Human Brand Award == Selected filmography == * 08/15 (1954), as Wagner * 08/15 - In der Heimat (1955), as Unteroffizier Stamm * Fruit in the Neighbour's Garden (1956), as Landstreicher * The Girl and the Legend (1957), as Bertie * Sand, Love and Salt (1957, directed by František Čáp), as Coco * ' (1957) * The Devil Strikes at Night (1957, directed by Robert Siodmak), as Bruno Luedke * The Doctor of Stalingrad (1958, directed by Géza von Radványi), as Pelz, Sanitäter * Rosemary (1958, directed by Rolf Thiele), as Horst * The Death Ship (1959, directed by Georg Tressler), as Lawski, Polnischer Kohlenschlepper * The Day the Rains Came (1959, directed by Gerd Oswald), as Werner Maurer * ' (Bumerang) (1960, directed by Alfred Weidenmann), as Georg Kugler * My Schoolfriend (1960), as Niedermoser * Brainwashed (1960, directed by Gerd Oswald), as Mirko Centowic * Who Are You, Mr. Sorge?

The first is Ascoli Piceno, the Ausculum in ancient Picenum (modern Marche). It is situated in the valley of the Truentus (mod. Tronto) river on the via Salaria. It was originally a Sabine city (Festus 235.16-17). Following its defeat by the Romans in 268 BC (Eutr. 2,16), Asculum became a civitas foederata. It was the first Italian city to rise up against Rome in 90 BC during the Social War. An account described the city as home to a war-like people that bore generation-old grudge against Rome for encroaching on its northern territories. It was besieged and captured following the Battle of Asculum (89 BC).Velleius Paterculus 2.21.1. Discovered artifacts in the city such as sling bullets show that the siege included at least four Roman legions as well as Gallic and Spanish auxiliaries. Following the war, it became a municipium. In the triumviral period or under Augustus, it became a colonia. The second city is Ascoli Satriano, a small village of the Satriani people, on a branch of the Appian Way in Apulia, South East Italy. Two battles were fought there. The first was the Battle of Asculum (279 BC), which was the first of King Pyrrhus of Epirus's Pyrrhic victory against the Roman Republic during the Pyrrhic War. This was followed by the Battle of Asculum (209 BC), during the Second Punic War, in which Hannibal defeated a Roman army commanded by Marcus Claudius Marcellus in an indecisive battle. ==Notes== Category:Roman sites of the Marche Category:Ascoli Piceno Category:Picenum ","title":"Asculum"},{"id":"2563934","text":"Interstate 291 (I-291) is a short Interstate Highway in the state of Connecticut that starts at I-91 at its junction with Route 218 in Windsor and ends at I-84 and I-384 in Manchester. It serves as a northeastern bypass of Hartford. The official length of I-291 is , including of the exit ramp to the merge with eastbound I-84. I-291 is also known as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Highway for its entire length. ==Route description== I-291 begins at I-91 in Windsor at an interchange that also provides access to and from Route 218. Heading southeast, I-291 has a partial interchange with Route 159, then crosses the Connecticut River on the Bissell Bridge. Originally constructed in 1957, the Bissell Bridge charged a toll until 1988 when the bridge was reconstructed. It has an interchange with US 5 in South Windsor at its junction with Route 30, and ends at I-84 in Manchester in a complex interchange that also provides access to I-384. At the west end, stub ramps continue about one-half mile past I-91 to provide access to Route 218. ==History== The current I-291 is only the northeastern arc of what was originally planned as a three-quarter beltway around Hartford. From Windsor, I-291 would have continued to cross I-84 again in Farmington, and end at I-91 in Rocky Hill. While the remainder of I-291 was cancelled amidst environmental concerns, those two interchanges were built as part of I-84 and I-91 construction, and stood unused for over 20 years as ramp stubs. Half of the stack interchange at I-84 was eventually placed in service when Route 9 was extended to run along a portion of the I-291 right of way south of I-84 in 1992. The I-91 ramp was demolished in 1999 during expansion of I-91. The northernmost two miles (3 km) of the Route 9 expressway follows the original path of the southwest segment of I-291 from I-84. Route 9 currently serves as the southwest quadrant around Hartford leaving only the northwest section of I-291 unbuilt. Route 218 is a 4-lane divided arterial route serving what would have been the northwest quadrant of the I-291 beltway. When the interchange with I-91 was completed in the early 1990s, a pair of ramp stubs connecting I-291 to Route 218 were built to the west of I-91 in anticipation that the northwest leg of I-291 might eventually be built. Over the years there have been discussions of constructing a multi-lane surface road from the I-84/Route 9 Stack interchange to Route 218 to complete the northwest bypass of Hartford, but funding and potential impacts to the reservoirs that supply Hartford with much of its drinking water have prevented anything from being built north of I-84. With the cancellation of the northwest quadrant of I-291, all travel between locations north and west of Hartford must pass through the I-84/I-91 interchange in Downtown Hartford. The Connecticut Department of Transportation headquarters was built on land originally acquired for I-291 where it would have intersected U.S. Route 5/Route 15 in Newington. A small portion of what was to be the northwest leg of I-291 was built along Route 218 west of I-91, which is now used as a commuter parking lot.[Aerial view of Commuter Parking Lot on CT Route 218, Google Maps, Accessed July 8, 2020, https://www.google.com/maps/@41.8175752,-72.6824167,178m/data=!3m1!1e3] ==Exit list== ==References== ==External links== *kurumi.com I-291 91-2 91-2 2 (Connecticut) Category:Transportation in Hartford County, Connecticut ","title":"Interstate 291 (Connecticut)"},{"id":"2563935","text":"thumb Jules T. Anatole Mallet (23 May 1837 – 10 October 1919) was a Swiss mechanical engineer, who was the inventor of the first successful compound system for a railway steam locomotive, patented in 1874. He is known for having invented three important forms of compound locomotive. Early Mallet 2-cylinder compound locomotive working the Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz (B.A.B.)

Note the larger diameter of the low-pressure front cylinders. One of the last US large compound Mallets He subsequently designed an articulated compound system with a rigid chassis at the rear carrying two high-pressure cylinders, and two low-pressure ones mounted on a swivelling front truck. This was patented in 1884 with full rights granted in 1885. This was first used for a series of narrow gauge locomotives specially built by the Decauville Company in 1888 for the Paris Exposition of 1889. This arrangement became known as the Mallet locomotive. The final developments of these in the USA were some of the largest steam locomotives ever built. Mallet tandem compound, A third compound locomotive, less well-known, was a tandem compound developed in 1890 for SACM as a collaboration with Alfred de Glehn and the Russian A. Borodine. The high and low pressure cylinders were mounted on a common axis, with the high pressure ahead. Unlike the US tandem compounds, the high and low pressure cylinders were cross-connected between sides, which also required them to be receiver compounds with an intermediate reservoir as a pair of curved pipes passing through the smokebox. Large numbers of these, mostly a 2-8-0 derivative, were built for Russian and Hungarian railways making them the most-produced type of tandem compound locomotive. Z. Kordina's design for Hungarian State Railways was a similar 4-4-0, although outside-framed and with the low-pressure cylinders ahead of the high pressure. He was awarded the Elliott Cresson Medal of The Franklin Institute in 1908. == See also == * List of railway pioneers == References == * Category:1837 births Category:1919 deaths Category:People from Geneva Category:Swiss people in rail transport Category:École Centrale Paris alumni Category:Swiss railway mechanical engineers Category:Locomotive builders and designers ","title":"Anatole Mallet"},{"id":"2563938","text":"Tikamgarh is a town and a tehsil in Tikamgarh district in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.

Maharaja Pratap Singh ju Dev (born 1854, died 1930), who succeeded to the throne in 1874, devoted himself entirely to the development of his state, himself designing most of the engineering and irrigation works that were executed during his reign. In 1901, the state had an area of , and population of 52,634. It was the oldest and highest in rank of all the Bundela states, with a 17-gun salute, and its Maharajas bore the hereditary title of First of the Prince of Bundelkhand. Vir Singh, Pratap Singh's successor, merged his state with India on 1 January 1950. The district became part of Vindhya Pradesh state, which was merged into Madhya Pradesh state in 1956. Today Orchha is almost a nondescript town with a small population, and its importance is maintained only due to its rich architectural heritage and tourism. However the name of the Orchha State continued to be in use, as can be seen in the inscriptions of Jain tirth Paporaji, now on the outskirts of Tikamgarh.Papaura Darshan, Pt. Vimal Kumar Shastri, Shri Digambar jain Atishya Kshetra Papaura ji, Tikamgarh, 2014. Janaki temple popularly known as the Nau Lakha Mandir (meaning \\"nine lakhs\\") in Nepal. The cost for the construction of the temple was about the same amount of money: rupees nine lakhs or nine hundred thousand, hence the name. Queen Vrisha Bhanu of Tikamgarh, India built the temple in 1910 AD. Aharji jain temples In the reign of Jehangir, in 1618, Raja Veer Singh Deva Bundela of Orchha had built Keshavdeva temple at the cost of thirty-three lakhs in Mathura. A French traveller Tavernier visited Mathura in 1650 and had described the octagonal temple built in red sandstone. Italian traveller Niccolao Manucci who worked in Mughal court has also described the temple. Mughal prince Dara Shikoh had patronised the temple and donated a railing to the temple. The railing was removed Mathura governor Abdun Nabi Khan on the order of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb and he built Jama mosque on the ruins of the Hindu temples. During the Jat rebellion in Mathura, Abdul Nabi Khan was killed in 1669. Aurangzeb attacked Mathura and destroyed that Keshavdeva temple in 1670 and built Shahi Eidgah in its place.

The Tahiti sandpiper or Tahitian sandpiper (Prosobonia leucoptera) is an extinct member of the large wader family Scolopacidae that was endemic to Tahiti in French Polynesia. It was discovered in 1773 during Captain Cook's second voyage, when a single specimen seems to have been collected, but it became extinct in the nineteenth century. Only one museum specimen is known to exist, held in the Aves collection of Naturalis Biodiversity Center. The bird's name in the Tahitian language was transcribed as toromē. ==Description== Illustration by John Latham Keulemans Based on Zusi & Jehl (1970): A small (some 18 cm long), plain-colored sandpiper, brown below, darker above, with a white wing patch. Top and sides of head and neck to wings and back sooty brown, darker on back and wings. A small white patch behind and above the eye. Chin buffish white. Lores, rump and underside rusty. Wing coverts with some rusty edging. Remiges with paler inner surfaces. Underside of wing dusky brown with paler edges to coverts. A crescent-shaped white patch formed by tertiary coverts; smaller on the underside of the wing. Ten primaries, twelve rectrices. Central tail feathers sooty brown with rusty tips; outer ones rusty with sooty brown barring. Bill blackish, lower mandible slightly paler, pointed, thin and short, rather like in an insectivorous passerine than a wader. Legs greenish- hued pale straw color. Toes unwebbed. A slim pale rusty ring around the eye. The iris was very dark brown. The Tahiti sandpiper is believed to have occurred near small streams. Two probable specimens taken on Moorea by William Anderson between September 30 and October 11, 1777, formed the basis for the description of the Moorea sandpiper. Three specimens mentioned by John Latham in 1787 all differed from one another, but the single remaining one, RMNH 87556, cannot be positively identified with any of them. How it came into the possession of the museum cannot be retraced with complete certainty, but it probably was acquired in 1819 with other specimens from Georg Forster. There also exists a painting by Forster, drawn from the original specimen. At any rate, the specimen agrees better with the Tahiti bird in Forster's painting. The Moorea bird--of which another painting, by William Ellis, and a plate by J. Webber, supposed to depict the other specimen, constitute all remaining evidence--differs in the color of wings and head. Whether these two forms were species, subspecies, or simply variants due to age or sex cannot be determined with certainty, but for the present they are more often treated as different species than not. Bones of a related form have been found on Mangaia in the Cook Islands. It is not likely that they will be studied anytime soon: a scientific description would require either successful extraction and analysis of DNA from both the bones and the Leiden specimen (which would risk being damaged during extraction of the tissue sample), or the collection of a sufficient amount of material from Tahiti or Moorea to determine the Mangaia bird's affiliation by analysis of the osteology. Both possibilities seem very remote. ==References== ==Further reading== *Greenway, James C. (1967): Tahitian Sandpiper. In: Extinct and Vanishing Birds of the World (2nd ed.): 263–264.

They are then grilled or even lightly fried until the cheese melts and the tortillas become crispy, cut into halves or wedges and served, usually with salsa and pico de gallo, avocado or guacamole on top and/or other toppings or condiments. In some American Tex-Mex restaurants, such as Taco Bell, some quesadillas and/or sincronizadas may include chicken fajita meat. Fajita meat is not traditionally used in Mexico, as fajitas are a Tex-Mex dish, and not a Mexican one. In fact, the name \\"fajitas\\" is virtually unknown in Southern Mexico as a dish, although there are somewhat similar alambre dishes enjoyed throughout Mexico. They are frequently confused with plain quesadillas, due to their resemblance to \\"quesadillas\\" sold in Mexico and the United States. (U.S. quesadillas are usually made with flour tortillas rather than molded from masa in the Mexican style). Note however that despite the fact that it looks almost the same as a quesadilla, it is considered a separate dish. The main difference between the real quesadilla and the sincronizadas is the obligatory inclusion of ham in the dish and the main ingredient used to make the tortilla (wheat flour instead of corn flour, masa harina).Luis Peinado, Marilyn Peinado (1992), «Bienvenidos to our kitchen: authentic Mexican cooking», Pelican Publishing Company, pp:66 A quesadilla is made of a single folded and filled corn tortilla, while the sincronizada is prepared like a sandwich. Ingredients could vary between Oaxaca cheese, Manchego cheese and different types of ham. The sincronizada is sometimes consumed alone, but in most regions of Mexico it is common to add a regional sour cream, salsa or guacamole as topping to make a richer flavor. The Tex-Mex version also contains beans, cheese, beef fajita meat and avocado and Monterey Jack cheese instead of the traditional Oaxacan one.

K. V. Gale, British iron and steel industry (David and Charles, Newton Abbot 1967), 55-8. He was born in Shettleston and was trained as an engine wright. After the failure of a colliery at Irvine he was appointed foreman of the Glasgow Gasworks in 1817 at the age of 25. Five years later he became the manager and engineer there, a position he held for 40 years. While trying to solve a problem with a blast furnace at Wilsontown Ironworks, Neilson realized that the fuel efficiency of the furnace could be increased by blowing it with hot air, rather than cold air, by passing it through a red-hot vessel. Experiments were continued at Clyde Iron Works, leading to his forming a partnership with Charles Macintosh and others to exploit it. Patents were obtained for the system in 1828. Experimentation showed that a temperature of 600° Fahrenheit reduced consumption to a third of that with cold blast, and enabled raw coal to be used instead of coke, with a further cost saving. It also enabled the exploitation of black band ironstone, the use of which had previously proved unprofitable. 1840 illustration of a Beaumont Neilson blast stove In the early 1830s litigation was successfully conducted against those who adopted his methods without licence. After that, Neilson and his partners licensed it widely at one shilling per ton iron made, a level low enough to discourage evasion. The royalties were initially low, but by 1840 were producing £30,000 per year from 58 ironmaste. Certain infringers were intransigent. Between 1839 and the expiry of the patent in 1842 a considerable number of proceedings were brought. Neilson v Baird was heard in the Court of Session in 1843, in a trial lasting 10 days and costing £40,000. Further proceedings against Baird ended in the award of damages of £160,000. Neilson retired from Glasgow Gasworks in 1847. He bought an estate on Bute. Later he bought an estate at Queenshill, near Kirkcudbright. There he died. He is buried in the family mausoleum at Tongland Kirkyard. His son, Walter Montgomerie Neilson, erected Neilson's Monument to his memory on the hill at Queenshill in 1883. Both in Glasgow and near Kirkcubright, he founded institutions for the education of working men. William Neilson, James's brother, founded the Glasgow engineers and locomotive manufacturers Neilson and Company, in 1836, partly financed by James.

He served as the Administrator of Jiangxia Commandery (江夏郡; around present-day Xinzhou District, Wuhan, Hubei) under Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan). He is best known for killing the warlord Sun Jian in an ambush during the Battle of Xiangyang (191) and resisting an invasion by the warlord Sun Quan (Sun Jian's son) at the Battle of Xiakou (203). He was defeated and killed at the Battle of Jiangxia in 208 against Sun Quan's forces. ==Background== There are plenty of historical records concerning Huang Zu, but they are scattered over different texts while Huang Zu never had a biography in any official record. Since Jiangxia Commandery (江夏郡; around present-day Xinzhou District, Wuhan, Hubei) is known for being the cradle of the Huang family, Huang Zu, as the commandery's Administrator, probably came from an influential family based there. After Liu Biao arrived in Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) to assume his governorship of the region, he sought to form alliances with the local elites, particularly the Huang family who had been defending Jiangxia Commandery in eastern Jing Province from aggression by a neighbouring warlord, Yuan Shu. In return, Liu Biao provided financial aid to Huang Zu in peacetime and military support for his naval forces during wartime. Under such arrangements, even though Huang Zu was nominally a subordinate of Liu Biao, he maintained much autonomy over Jiangxia Commandery. ==Battle of Xiangyang== In 191, war broke out between the warlords Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu, who were half- brothers. Yuan Shao formed an alliance with Liu Biao while Yuan Shu gained support from Sun Jian to attack Liu Biao's territories in Jing Province. Liu Biao assigned Huang Zu to defend Fancheng (樊城; in present-day Xiangyang, Hubei) and Dengzhou (鄧州; in present-day Nanyang, Henan) from Sun Jian's attacks. However, Huang Zu lost to Sun Jian in battle and realised that he could not defeat the enemy on flat and open terrain, so he retreated to Xiangyang Commandery, the capital of Jing Province, and holed up behind the city walls. One night, Huang Zu led a group of soldiers to launch a sneak attack on Sun Jian's camp but failed to catch the enemy by surprise. Nevertheless, Sun Jian died after being hit by a stray arrow while pursuing Huang Zu into a forest. In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Biao's subordinates Kuai Liang and Lü Gong () set up the ambush that killed Sun Jian. Huang Zu is captured by Sun Jian's eldest son, Sun Ce, but is later released in exchange for Sun Jian's dead body. Historically, however, Sun Ce never captured Huang Zu, who was given full credit in historical records for defeating and killing Sun Jian. ==Resisting Sun Ce's expansion== Following Sun Jian's death, Liu Biao no longer saw Yuan Shu as a threat in the east so he focused on consolidating control over Jing Province while leaving Huang Zu in charge of Jiangxia Commandery. In the meantime, throughout the 190s, Sun Jian's eldest son, Sun Ce, conquered the territories in the Jiangdong region adjacent to Jing Province. In 199, when Sun Ce was seizing control of Lujiang Commandery (廬江郡; around present-day Lu'an, Anhui) from Liu Xun, Liu Biao instigated Huang Zu to attack Sun Ce at Shaxian (沙羨; west of present-day Wuhan, Hubei). Sun Ce brought along his cousins Sun Ben and Sun Fu and other subordinates such as Zhou Yu and Taishi Ci, and led an army to resist Huang Zu. Huang Zu, on the other hand, gathered his clansmen, his son Huang She () and Liu Biao's nephew Liu Pan (), and led his troops to engage Sun Ce's forces. Sun Ce defeated Huang Zu in the battle and killed thousands of enemies, forcing Huang Zu to retreat back to Jiangxia Commandery. During the counterattack, Sun Ce managed to expand his territorial boundaries slightly into the outskirts of Jiangxia Commandery. In 200 CE, the warlord Cao Cao, who controlled the Han central government and the figurehead Emperor Xian, sent Mi Heng, a talented but obnoxious scholar, as a guest to Liu Biao. Although Mi Heng and Liu Biao got along well initially, Mi Heng started to insult and belittle Liu Biao after some time. Unable to put up with Mi Heng's obnoxious behaviour, Liu Biao then sent him to Huang Zu. Huang Zu could not tolerate Mi Heng and had him executed. ==Battle of Xiakou== In the year 200, after Sun Ce was assassinated, his younger brother Sun Quan succeeded him and became the warlord of the Jiangdong territories. In 203, Sun Quan launched an invasion of Xiakou (夏口; within present-day Wuhan, Hubei) and appointed Ling Cao to lead the vanguard force. Upon arriving at Xiakou, Ling Cao led his men on a charge and managed to break through Huang Zu's defences and throw the enemy fleet into confusion with the sudden attack. However, he was killed in the midst of battle by a stray arrow fired by Gan Ning, one of Huang Zu's subordinates. Huang Zu was thus able to retreat safely back to Jiangxia Commandery. After the battle, Su Fei (), one of Huang Zu's subordinates, recommended Gan Ning for promotion. However, Huang Zu not only did not feel grateful towards Gan Ning, but also attempted to entice Gan Ning's followers to abandon their leader and join him. Some of them agreed.(權討祖，祖軍敗奔走，追兵急，寧以善射，將兵在後，射殺校尉凌操。祖旣得免，軍罷還營，待寧如初。祖都督蘇飛數薦寧，祖不用，令人化誘其客，客稍亡。) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 55. Gan Ning was so unhappy with Huang Zu that he eventually left him (with help from Su Fei) and defected to Sun Quan's side.(寧欲去，恐不獲免，獨憂悶不知所出。飛知其意，乃要寧，為之置酒，謂曰：「吾薦子者數矣，主不能用。日月逾邁，人生幾何，宜自遠圖，庶遇知己。」寧良乆乃曰：「雖有其志，未知所由。」飛曰：「吾欲白子為邾長，於是去就，孰與臨阪轉丸乎？」寧曰：「幸甚。」飛白祖，聽寧之縣。招懷亡客并義從者，得數百人。) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 55. In the years after the Battle of Xiakou, Sun Quan continued to engage Huang Zu in incessant battles from time to time, but none of these battles were conclusive or of a large scale, as Sun Quan was also busy putting down rebellions in the Jiangdong territories. ==Downfall== In the spring of 208, Gan Ning suggested to Sun Quan to prepare for a full assault on Jiangxia Commandery and he pointed out that Huang Zu was old and feeble and had not replenished his arsenal in a while. Sun Quan heeded Gan Ning's advice and ordered Ling Cao's son Ling Tong to lead the vanguard and Lü Meng to be the naval commandant. In response to Sun Quan's invasion, Huang Zu assigned Zhang Shuo () to lead the vanguard and Chen Jiu () to command the navy. Unlike the previous battle, Huang Zu did not put himself at the frontline and instead remained behind the walls of Jiangxia Commandery while his subordinates led his troops into battle. Before the battle started, Zhang Shuo led his men out on a large vessel to scout the riverbank. He encountered Ling Tong, who was also checking out the area with only tens of soldiers on a light vessel. They engaged in combat and Ling Tong slew Zhang Shuo and captured the rest of his men. Upon learning of Zhang Shuo's death, Huang Zu immediately ordered Chen Jiu to block the entrance of the Mian River by scuttling two of his largest mengchongs at the chokepoint. In addition, Huang Zu deployed archers on top of the cliff overlooking the Mian River and ordered them to throw boulders and fire arrows at approaching enemy vessels. Sun Quan sent his largest vessels to destroy the mengchongs but to no avail. After some lengthy fighting, Sun Quan realised that Huang Zu's arsenal was not as rusty as he thought, and saw that he had already suffered heavy losses on his side. Sun Quan then ordered Ling Tong and Dong Xi, along with 100 \\"commandos\\", to wear two layers of armour each and charge towards the enemy in the face of boulders and arrows raining down on them. After a tough fight, Ling Tong and Dong Xi managed to break the thick rope connecting the mengchongs and allow Sun Quan's navy to pass through. Lü Meng killed Chen Jiu on board his warship while Ling Tong breached the walls of Jiangxia Commandery. Huang Zu attempted to flee after his defeat but met his ends at the hands of Feng Ze (), a soldier in Sun Quan's army. ==See also== * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms ==References== * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

His father, Thomas, was a Cittizen and Joyner of London, and Giles may have been related to Thomas Farnaby (c. 1575–1647), the famous schoolmaster of Kent, whose father was a carpenter. But it was his cousin Nicholas Farnaby (c. 1560–1630), who may have turned him to music. Nicholas was a virginal maker, at this time a generic word that included the entire family of plucked keyboard instruments: the harpsichord, virginal, muselar and doubtless the clavichord, and it is for these instruments that Farnaby's compositions are best known. Like his father however, Giles trained as a joiner or cabinet-maker, starting his apprenticeship in about 1583, and gave this trade as his occupation for most of his life. He married Katherine Roane on 28 May 1587, and first lived in the parish of St. Helen's Bishopsgate, in London. The couple had a daughter, Philadelphia, baptised on 8 August 1591, when the Farnabys moved to the neighbouring parish of St Peter's, Westcheap, and later a son, Richard Farnaby (1594–1623). After Philadelphia's premature death, prior to 1602, the Farnabys had three more children: a son Joy (1599), a daughter, also baptised Philadelphia (1602), and a last son, Edward (1604). In spite of his social background, hardly suited at this time to a university education, he graduated from Christ Church, Oxford on 7 July 1592, receiving a Bachelor’s degree in music.Anthony à Wood, Athenæ Oxonienses: an exact history of all the writers and bishops who have had their education in the most ancient and famous University of Oxford, from the fifteenth year of King Henry the Seventh, Dom. 1500, to the end of the year 1690 representing the birth, fortune, preferment, and death of all those authors and prelates, the great accidents of their lives, and the fate and character of their writings : to which are added, the Fasti, or, Annals, of the said university, for the same time (London, 1691), 767. This was the very same day that John Bull, his eminent fellow composer to be, obtained his degree: Bull evidently knew Farnaby, and influenced his musical style considerably. In 1602 the family moved to Aisthorpe in Lincolnshire, where they remained until at least 1610. Farnaby obtained a position in the household of Sir Nicholas Saunderson of Fillingham, as music teacher to his children. By 1614 the Farnabys had returned to London, registered at Grub Street, Cripplegate in 1634, where Giles died in 1640 and was buried on 25 November. ==Works== Farnaby is considered one of the great English virginalists, together with William Byrd, John Bull, Orlando Gibbons, Peter Philips and Thomas Tomkins among others. Unlike them however, he is the only one not to have been a professional musician. His best known works are included in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, which contains 52 of his pieces. Notable among them are 11 fantasias, a wonderful and technically demanding set of variations called Woody-Cock, and short but charming descriptive pieces such as Giles Farnabys Dreame, His Rest, Farnabyes Conceit and His Humour. There are also four pieces by his son, Richard. His entire keyboard works and a biography are available in a modern edition.Giles & Richard Farnaby: Keyboard Music, in Musica Britannica XXIV, Stainer & Bell. Ltd., 1974. In addition to his keyboard compositions, Farnaby also composed madrigals, canzonets and psalms. ==Notes== * Five improvisations on Farnaby's virginal pieces were written by Edmund Rubbra (1901—1986). *Two songs by Giles Farnaby appear in a jazz format on a UK CBS record album (63512) from 1969 by The London Jazz Four (aka LJ IV): \\"The Old Spagnoletta\\" and \\"Bony Sweet Robin\\".

It was originally built in the medieval period as a castle called the Castrum Maris (; ). It was rebuilt by the Order of Saint John as a bastioned fort called Fort Saint Angelo between the 1530s and the 1560s, and it is best known for its role as the Order's headquarters during the Great Siege of Malta of 1565. A major reconstruction to designs of Carlos de Grunenbergh took place in the 1690s, giving the fort its current appearance. The fort was garrisoned by the British from 1800 to 1979, at times being classified as a stone frigate known as HMS Egmont or later HMS St Angelo. The fort suffered considerable damage during World War II, but it was later restored. In 1998, the upper part of the fort was handed to the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Fort St. Angelo has been on Malta's tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 1998, as part of the Knights' Fortifications around the Harbours of Malta. ==History== ===Pre- history to antiquity=== The site was occupied since pre-history and a prominent place of worship in antiquity with the building of the temple of Astarte. The date of its original construction is unknown. However, the prehistoric and classical remains on site, are indicative of a fortified place and a habitable zone. Large ashlar blocks and an Egyptian pink granite column at the top part of the fort still exists inside the chapel. The site was probably later developed by the Arabs 870 AD, but nothing is concrete. Al- Himyarī mentions that the Arabs dismantled a ' (fortress), but there is no actual reference if this 'fortress' was in Birgu.\\"A hand book, or guide, for strangers visiting Malta\\", p. 81. A rock-cut church close to the area had already existed since Orthodox Christianity in Malta around 600 A.D. and was rebuilt with wood in around 800 A.D. ===Middle Ages=== Its probable start as a fortification is the high/late medieval period. In fact, in 1220 Hohenstaufen Emperor Frederick II started to appoint his own Castellani for Malta who needed a place to live and secure the interests of the crown. The remains of a tower that may date back to the 12th century can be traced among the more recent works. The first mention of ' () is to be found in documents from the 1240s when Paulinus of Malta was the lord of the island and later when Giliberto Abate made a census of the islands. Another reference to the castle is that from the short Angevin rule (1266–83) where documents list it again as ' and list a garrison of 150 men together with several weapons. It seems also that by 1274, the castle already had two chapels which are still there today.https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/41363/1/Il- pittura_f%27Malta_u_l-identita_nazzjonali_1989.pdf From the same year exists also a detailed inventory of weapons and supplies in the castle. From 1283 the Maltese islands were under Aragonese rule (although the castle withstood for some time in Angevin rule while the rest of Malta was already in Aragonese hands) and the fortification was mainly used by Castellani (like the de Nava family) who were there to safeguard the interests of the Aragonese crown. In fact the Castellans did not have any jurisdiction outside the ditch of the fort. By 1445 a Mariam confraternity, one of the eldest in Maltese history, had its convent located at the site.p. 22 A middle-ages window was discovered during renovations. It is documented that this has been walled up soon after the arrival of the knights. ===Knights' period=== St. Anne's Chapel When the Order of Saint John arrived in Malta in 1530, they chose to settle in Birgu, when it was observed the site of Fort St Angelo was partially abandoned and in ruins.p. 22 After renovation it became the seat of the Grand Master, which included the refurbishing of the Castellan's House and the Chapel of St Anne. The Knights made this their primary fortification and substantially reinforced and remodelled it, including the cutting of the dry ditch to make it a moat and the D'Homedes Bastion built by 1536. By 1547, a large cavalier designed by Antonio Ferramolino was built behind the D'Homedes Bastion, and De Guirial Battery was built at the tip of the fort by sea level to protect the entrance to Dockyard Creek. These works transformed the fort into a gunpowder fortification. Fort St Angelo withstood the Turks during the Great Siege of Malta, during which it succeeded in tearing apart a sea attack by the Turks on Senglea on 15 August 1565. In the aftermath of that siege, the Knights built the fortified city of Valletta on Mount Sciberras on the other side of the Grand Harbour, and the administrative centre for the knights moved there. In 1644, Giovanni de’ Medici proposed a new fort be constructed on Orsi Point (the site where Fort Ricasoli was later built), and the name and garrison of Fort St. Angelo be transferred to the new fort. He drew up plans for the proposed fort, but they were never implemented. It was not until the 1690s that the fort again underwent major repairs. Today's layout of the fort is attributed to these works which were designed by Carlos de Grunenbergh, who also paid for the construction of four gun batteries on the side of the fort facing the entrance to Grand Harbour. As a result, one can still see his coat of arms above the main gate of the fort. By the arrival of the French in 1798, therefore, the fort became a very powerful fortification including some 80 guns, 48 of which pointed towards the entrance of the port. During the short two-year period of French occupation, the Fort served as headquarters of the French Army. ===British period=== With the coming of the British to Malta the fort retained its importance as a military installation, first in use by the Army as a Wireless Station.71 In fact, in 1800, two battalions of the 35th Regiment were resident in the fort. However, at the start of the 20th century, the fort was taken over by the Navy and it was commissioned as a stone frigate, originally in 1912 as HMS Egmont, when it became a base for the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean, but in 1933 renamed as HMS St Angelo. The British did not make any major modifications to the fort, although they converted No. 2 Battery into a casemated battery for three nine-inch RML guns in the 1860s, and built a cinema and a water distillation plant in the early 20th century. During World War II, the fort again stood for siege with an armament of 3 Bofors guns (manned by the Royal Marines and later by the Royal Malta Artillery). In total, the fort suffered 69 direct hits between 1940 and 1943. When the Royal Navy left Malta in 1979 the Fort was handed to the Maltese government and since then parts of the fort fell into a state of disrepair, mostly after a project to transform it into a hotel during the 1980s. ===Recent history=== Panoramic view of the fort from D'Homedes Bastion after restoration On 5 December 1998, a treaty was signed between Malta and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta granting the upper part of Fort St Angelo, including the Grand Master's House and the Chapel of St Anne, to the Order with limited extraterritoriality. This treaty was ratified on 1 November 2001. The agreement has a duration of 99 years but the document allows the Maltese Government terminate it at any time after 50 years. In terms of the agreement, the flag of Malta is to be flown together with the flag of the Order in a prominent position over Saint Angelo. No asylum may be granted by the Order and generally the Maltese courts have full jurisdiction and Maltese law shall apply. A number of immunities and privileges are mentioned in the second bilateral treaty. Other parts of the fort are leased to the Cottonera Waterfront Group, a private consortium. Interior of the fort after restoration On 5 March 2012, it was confirmed that the European Regional Development Fund allocated €13.4 million for the restoration, conservation and re-use of the site, allowing for the Fort to be opened as a major visitor attraction highlighting its history and roles through the ages as well as to cater for educational programs, cultural events and live historical experiences. The restoration was managed by Heritage Malta. and completed in September 2015. It frequently participates in hosting events of national importance including the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2015 and the 2017 Maltese EU presidency. ==Layout== View of Fort St. Angelo, with the four batteries constructed by Grunenburgh visible to the left. Upon the arrival of the Order in 1530, the Castrum Maris consisted of a shell keep containing various buildings, including the Castellan's house and the Chapel of St. Mary (later rededicated to St. Anne), and an outer ward. The castle also included a chapel dedicated to St. Angelo, which was later rededicated to the Nativity of Our Lady. By the time of the Great Siege of Malta of 1565, the fort still retained most of its medieval features, but a number of modifications had been made by the Order, including: *D'Homedes Bastion – built during the reign of Juan de Homedes y Coscon. It was heavily altered since the 16th century, especially when it was converted into a gunpowder magazine. Part of the bastion was destroyed in World War II, but the damage was repaired in the 1990s. *Ferramolino's Cavalier – a high cavalier near D'Homedes Bastion, built between 1542 and 1547. Its roof had eight embrasures, and several magazines and a beacon were also located on the cavalier. *De Guiral Battery – a small sea-level battery on the western side of the fort. It was named after Francesco de Guiral, its commander during the Great Siege. The battery was altered in the 17th and 18th centuries, and again by the British. Most of the present configuration of the fort dates back to reconstruction in the 1690s. Among the features added Grunenbergh, there were four batteries facing the entrance to the Grand Harbour. No. 1, No. 2 and No. 4 Batteries were heavily altered by the British, while No. 3 Battery retains more of its original features. ==Gallery== File:Malta StAngelo two.jpg West face of the seaward bastion File:Sudika Birgu San Angelo gate.jpg Main Gate before renovation File:Malta StAngelo three.jpg Inscription over the gate File:Fort St. Angelo interior 01.jpgPrivate part of the fort dedicated to the SMOM File:Malta StAngelo four.jpg Chapel of the Nativity of Our Lady ==Other buildings and art== *Treasures of the Knights ==References== ==External links== * National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands * Video showing the development of Fort St. Angelo from a medieval castle to a gunpowder fortress * Video showing a 3D model of Fort St. Angelo Saint Angelo Saint Angelo Saint Angelo Category:World War II sites in Malta Category:Buildings and structures in Birgu Category:Buildings and structures of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta Category:Limestone buildings in Malta Category:Defunct prisons in Malta Category:Castles in Malta Category:Military installations closed in 1979 Category:National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands Category:16th-century fortifications Category:17th-century fortifications Category:Sites managed by Heritage Malta ","title":"Fort St. Angelo"},{"id":"2564012","text":"Eurico Ângelo de Oliveira Miranda (7 June 1944 – 12 March 2019) was a Brazilian politician and sports directive.

Eurico Miranda was the vice-president of Vasco da Gama football division between 1986 and 2000. ===Controversy=== In 1999, during a match between Vasco and Paraná Clube, he invaded the field, after three Vasco players were sent off by the referee, and prevented the match from being resumed. In 2000, he was accused by the Federal High Court (Supremo Tribunal Federal) of bearing responsibility for the São Januário collapse of a steel barrier, during the final match of the 2000 Campeonato Brasileiro final. Vasco da Gama won this match after defeating São Caetano. ====Football Investigation Parliamentary Committee==== In 2001, Eurico Miranda was the target of a series of press accusations, regarding several irregularities during his administration as vice-president, and later as president of Vasco. In that year, the Brazilian Congress convened its first investigative committee for football(a procedure known by the Portuguese acronym CPI), to investigate irregularities in the administration of Brazilian football, and Eurico Miranda was one of the people accused in the CPI's final report.

In a surprising event in Las Vegas, there was a paddle tennis tournament held by the Tennis Channel. Monfils was given a wildcard into the doubles event, but became more interested and inquired about getting a singles wildcard into the main draw. However, he received an entry into the qualifying singles (which he won). Monfils competed in the main draw of this paddle tennis tournament and surprised everyone when he ousted world No. 1 paddle tennis player Scott Freedman and eventually went on to win the whole tournament. In May, Monfils reached the semifinals of the Rome Masters, before losing to eventual champion Rafael Nadal in straight sets. En route to the semifinals, Monfils defeated former world No. 1 Andy Roddick. He then entered the Hamburg Masters event, where he lost in straight sets to fellow teenager Andy Murray in the first round. After that, he faced Murray once more, this time in the first round of the French Open. After a tough five–set battle, Monfils emerged victorious. Monfils then proceeded to play Belgian Dick Norman in the second round. Once again, the match went to five sets, and Monfils got the better of his opponent. He then faced his toughest opponent yet, American James Blake. Blake was the favourite for the win, as the eighth seed, while Monfils was seeded 25th. However, Monfils defeated Blake in another five-set match. He described this run as a marathon. Blake said of Monfils that 'he was the fastest man on the tour'. The fourth round was Monfils' last, as he lost to Novak Djoković in straight sets. As a result of his progress at the French Open, Monfils moved up five positions to reach a then career high of No. 23. This also made him the No. 1 player in France, two positions ahead of Sébastien Grosjean. Monfils then entered the Stella Artois Championships, where he won his first-round match against Jürgen Melzer. He then played the American Bobby Reynolds and won in straight sets. His third-round encounter with Ivan Ljubičić was the third time he faced the world No. 4. Monfils triumphed in straight sets. His quarterfinal draw was with James Blake, whom he had met earlier at the French Open. This time Blake succeeded. After having lost a set, Monfils retired as a result of a back injury. This injury effectively ruled him out of the Nottingham Open the following week. At Wimbledon, Monfils suffered a surprising first-round exit when defeated by Igor Kunitsyn. Monfils won the first set, but ended up losing the next three. ===2007: 50 career singles wins=== At the 2007 Australian Open, Monfils lost to his compatriot Richard Gasquet in the third round in four sets. Monfils had a good run in Poertschach as a warm-up for the French Open, but lost in the final against Juan Mónaco of Argentina in straight sets.

He also was forced to withdraw from the 2008 Australian Open due to the same injury. ===2008: French Open semifinals=== At the 2008 French Open, Monfils reached a semifinals berth for the first time at any Grand Slam, becoming the first Frenchman to reach the semifinals since 2001. Monfils was defeated by top seed Roger Federer in four sets. A shoulder injury forced Monfils to withdraw from Wimbledon shortly before he was due to play his first-round match. Monfils was selected by France to play at the Olympics in Beijing, where he lost to third seed Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals. At the 2008 US Open, Monfils lost in the fourth round to Mardy Fish in straight sets, after having previously defeated former world No. 3 David Nalbandian, also in straight sets. At the Thailand Open, Monfils reached the semifinals, losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in two sets. Monfils lost in the final of the BA-CA Tennis Trophy in straight sets to Philipp Petzschner in the final. ===2009: Top 10, second ATP title and first Masters final=== Monfils played his first tournament at the Qatar Open and caused a two-set upset in the quarterfinals against Rafael Nadal. Monfils lost to finalist Andy Roddick in three sets, after being up a break in the first set and losing it. At the 2009 Australian Open, Monfils lost to fellow Frenchman Gilles Simon in the fourth round, retiring due to a wrist injury. At the Abierto Mexicano Telcel, Monfils lost in the final to Nicolás Almagro. Monfils competed at the 2009 Monte Carlo Masters, losing in the first round to Janko Tipsarević in straight sets. His recent knee injury, caused by Osgood-Schlatter disease, resulted in his withdrawal from both the Rome Masters and the Madrid Masters.Monfils Doubtful for French Open, Retrieved 21 April 2009 However, he competed at the French Open and easily won his first-round match against Bobby Reynolds. He then completed another straight-set victory in the second round by overcoming Victor Crivoi. In the third round, Monfils beat Jürgen Melzer in four sets.

It connects the West End region on the southwest side to the South Shore neighborhood on the northeast side. The adjoining Fort Pitt Bridge on the northeast end connects to Downtown Pittsburgh. The tunnel carries traffic on Interstate 376 (I-376),Interstate 279 prior to June 10, 2009 U.S. Route 22 (US 22), US 30, and US 19 Truck. The structure comprises two bores, each with two lanes of traffic. The inbound tunnel flows onto the top deck of the double-deck Fort Pitt Bridge, opposite traffic from the lower deck using the outbound tunnel. To accommodate the bridge, the northeast portals of the parallel tunnels are vertically staggered by 30 feet. The tunnel opened in September 1960, a year after the Fort Pitt Bridge. Before entering the southwest end of the inbound tunnel, travelers see a commonplace view of Southwestern Pennsylvania's hills, but at the northeast end, travelers emerge to a panorama of Downtown Pittsburgh and the surrounding skyline. The view was cited by The New York Times as \\"the best way to enter an American city\\". The vantage was the inspiration for the news opening on Pittsburgh's KDKA-TV for several years in the 1980s and 1990s, and is referenced in Stephen Chbosky's novel The Perks of Being a Wallflower. The Fort Pitt Tunnel is the third-longest automobile tunnel in Pittsburgh, following the Liberty Tunnels and the Squirrel Hill Tunnel. It is one of four major tunnelsTunnels at least 3500 feet long passing beneath Mount Washington, including the Liberty Tunnels and the Wabash Tunnel for automobiles, and the Mount Washington Transit Tunnel for public transportation. { align=\\"right\\" View inside the westbound/southbound half of the tunnel Interstate 376 - Pennsylvaniao } ==History== Before the existence of the Fort Pitt Tunnels (as well as the Penn Lincoln Parkway and West End Bypass), South Hills commuters travelled around the Banksville Circle, which was the northern terminus of Banksville Road and western terminus of Saw Mill Run Blvd at the time. On July 11, 1954, contracts were awarded for the basic design of the Fort Pitt Tunnels. The groundbreaking ceremony for the Fort Pitt tunnel was held April 17, 1957 and drilling began August 28 of the same year. In April 1960 construction on the tunnels was complete and they opened for the first time at 11 a.m. on September 1, 1960, with a dedication ceremony on the southwestern portal by Governor Lawrence, Pennsylvania Transportation Secretary Park H. Martin and Pittsburgh Mayor Joseph M. Barr followed by a \\"christening\\" of the tunnels in which the Governor led a caravan of antique cars through. The tunnel cost $17 million (equivalent to $ in ). On Thursday, May 31, 2007, a bomb threat shut down the Fort Pitt Tunnel along with the Liberty and Squirrel Hill tunnels, causing a major traffic jam. The tunnel provided AM reception in 1960, but due to design repairs it was discontinued until 1986. It was improved to cover the entire tunnel with strong reception in March 1997. Since August 1987, the tunnels have provided cellular phone reception. With the help of Carnegie Mellon University graduate students, the tunnel has provided FM reception since July 2005 as well as having its AM signals upgraded at that time. In 2015, the original flat ceiling was removed due to its poor condition. ==Dimensions and specifications== * in length * wide * vertical clearance *Serves nearly 107,000 vehicles per day. *There are 1,788 light fixtures with 3,576 bulbs. *There are of tiled surface to wash. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *Travel Channel video *Video of the tunnel * – Southern portal * – Northern portal Category:Tunnels in Pittsburgh Category:U.S. Route 22 Category:U.S. Route 30 Category:Tunnels completed in 1960 Category:U.S. Route 19 Category:Road tunnels in Pennsylvania ","title":"Fort Pitt Tunnel"},{"id":"2564082","text":"Yucca de Lac was a high-end restaurant in Hong Kong, famous for frequently serving as a scene for the black-and-white Cantonese films made in the 1960s.

Panzer: The Popes and Slavery (New York: Alba House, 1996), pp. 79-81 \\"Sublimis Deus sic delexit humanum genus\\" (The exalted God loved the human race so much) It goes on to state that the Indians are fully rational human beings who have rights to freedom and private property, even if they are heathen.Bakewell, Peter and Holler, Jacqueline. A History of Latin America to 1825, John Wiley & Sons, 2010Traboulay, David M., \\"Las Casas Remembered: The 500th Anniversary of the Struggle for the Human Rights of the Native Peoples of America\\" (2015). CUNY Academic Works.Stamatov, Peter. The Origins of Global Humanitarianism: Religion, Empires, and Advocacy, Cambridge University Press, 2013 Drew, David. The Lost Chronicles of the Maya Kings, University of California Press, 1999 Another related document is the ecclesiastical letter Pastorale officium, issued May 29, 1537, and usually seen as a companion document to Sublimis Deus. There is still some controversy about how this bill is related to the documents known as Veritas ipsa, Unigenitus Deus and Pastorale officium (May 29, 1537). Alberto de la Hera (see footnote 1) believes that Veritas ipsa and Unigenitus Deus are simply other versions of Sublimis Deus, and not separate bills. Joel Panzer (The Popes and Slavery [New York: Alba House, 1996] p. 17) sees Veritas ipsa as an earlier draft of Sublimis Deus. While some scholars see Sublimis Deus as a primary example of Papal advocacy of Indian rights, others see it as part of an inconsistent and politically convenient stance by Paul III, who later rescinded Sublimis Deus or the Pastorale in 1538. In Sublimis Deus, Paul III unequivocally declares the indigenous peoples of the Americas to be rational beings with souls, denouncing any idea to the contrary as directly inspired by the \\"enemy of the human race\\" (Satan). He goes on to condemn their reduction to slavery in the strongest terms, declaring it null and void for any people known as well as any that could be discovered in the future, entitles their right to liberty and property, and concludes with a call for their evangelization. The bull had a strong impact on the Valladolid debate. Its principles became part of New Laws issued by Charles V in Spain, although such laws were often ignored by the colonists and conquistadores themselves.Maxwell 1975, p.58, 68-71 The executing brief for the bull (\\"Pastorale Officium\\") was annulled by Paul in 1537 at the request of the Spanish who had rescinded the decree previously issued by Charles.Maxwell 1975, p. 68-70 ==Background== In late spring of 1452 Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI wrote to Pope Nicholas for help against the impending siege of Constantinople by Ottoman Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror. Nicholas issued the bull Dum Diversas (18 June 1452) authorizing King Alfonso V of Portugal to \\"attack, conquer, and subjugate Saracens, pagans and other enemies of Christ wherever they may be found\\". Issued less than a year before the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the bull may have been intended to begin another crusade against the Ottoman Empire.Sardar, Ziauddin, and Davies, Merryl Wyn. 2004. The No-Nonsense Guide to Islam. Verso. . p. 94. Furthermore, the bull Romanus Pontifex (1455) gave the right of taking for reason of punishment for crime saracens (who, as Muslims in general were slavers themselves, often capturing Christians) and pagans as perpetual slaves. With the realization that the Americas represented regions of the Earth of which the Europeans were not aware earlier, there arose intense speculation over the question whether the natives of these lands were true humans or not. Together with that went a debate over the (mis)treatment of these natives by the Conquistadores and colonists. The main impetus for Sublimis Deus was a council held by prominent Missionaries in Mexico in 1537, including Archbishop Juan de Zumárraga, Bartolomé de Las Casas and Bishop of Puebla Julian Garcés. They discussed the methods of converting the natives, especially the Franciscan practice of mass baptism. Basing a recommendation to the pope on Las Casas' treatise on how to convert the Indians, \\"De Unico Vocationis Modo\\", they sent a letter to Rome with Dominican friar named Bernardino de Minaya (born c. 1489). In 1537, Minaya arrived in Rome and pleaded his case on behalf of the Indians. In response, Paul issued Sublimis Deus on June 2, 1537. \\"Pastorale officium\\", a papal brief apparently used in conjunction with the Sublimis Deus by Minaya, declared automatic excommunication for anyone who failed to abide by the new ruling.The Encyclopedia Of Christianity, p. 212 Stogre (1992) notes that Sublimis Deus is not present in Denzinger, the authoritative compendium of official teachings of the Catholic Church, and that the executing brief for it (\\"Pastorale officium\\") was annulled the following year.Stogre, p. 115, fn. 133 Davis (1988) asserts it was annulled due to a dispute with the Spanish crown.\\"The problem of slavery in Western culture\\", P. 170, fn. 9 The Council of The West Indies and the Crown concluded that the documents broke their patronato rights and the Pope withdrew them, though they continued to circulate and be quoted by La Casas and others who supported Indian rights.Lampe, p. 17 According to Falkowski (2002) Sublimis Deus had the effect of revoking Pope Alexander VI's bull Inter caetera but still leaving the colonizers the duty of converting the native people.Thornberry 2002, p. 65, fn. 21 Prein (2008) observes the difficulty in reconciling these decrees with Inter caetera. Father Gustavo Gutierrez describes Sublimis Deus as the most important papal document relating to the condition of native Indians and that it was addressed to all Christians.Father Joel S Panzer, 2008. Also see Hanke, Lewis. \\"Pope Paul III and the American Indians\\". Harvard Theological Review 30, no. 2 (April 1, 1937): 65–102. Maxwell (1975) notes that the bull did not change the traditional teaching that the enslavement of Indians was permissible if they were considered \\"enemies of Christendom\\" as this would be considered by the Church as a \\"just war\\". Stogre (1992) further argues that the Indian nations had every right to self-defense.Stogre, p. 115-116 Rodney Stark (2003) describes the bull as \\"magnificent\\" and believes the reason that, in his opinion, it has belatedly come to light is due to the neglect of Protestant historians.Stark 2003 Falola asserts that the bull related to the native populations of the New World and did not condemn the transatlantic slave trade stimulated by the Spanish monarchy and the Holy Roman Emperor.Falola, p. 107 ==Content== The wording of Sublimis Deus was a general pronouncement, framed in terms that applied not only to Indians but to all unknown peoples. The principal passage reads: > The enemy of the human race, who opposes all good deeds in order to bring > men to destruction, beholding and envying this, invented a means never > before heard of, by which he might hinder the preaching of God's word of > Salvation to the people: he inspired his satellites who, to please him, have > not hesitated to publish abroad that the Indians of the West and the South, > and other people of whom We have recent knowledge should be treated as dumb > brutes created for our service, pretending that they are incapable of > receiving the Catholic Faith. We, who, though unworthy, exercise on earth > the power of our Lord and seek with all our might to bring those sheep of > His flock who are outside into the fold committed to our charge, consider, > however, that the Indians are truly men and that they are not only capable > of understanding the Catholic Faith but, according to our information, they > desire exceedingly to receive it.

As of the 2008 national census, the population stood at 2,733. The Barclayville township straddles the banks of the Na River. Roads from Kanweaken to the northwest, Pleebo to the southeast, and to Picinicess and Grand Cess to the southeast, all intersect at Barclayville. In March 2006 the United Nations reported completion of the Na River bridge at Barclayville, connecting the Kanweaken and Pleebo roads for the first time. ==History== The modern jurisdiction of Barclayville was created by the administration of President Edwin Barclay in response to the last Kru Wars in the 1930s. As part of the effort to exert central government authority and diminish intertribal conflicts, which had produced devastation, he had four separate villages combined into one township. Until the creation of Barclayville, the constituent villages of Seetor and Kayken, which are occupied by rival chiefdoms, were in periodic conflict. The villages of Seetor, Kayeken and Wakpeken and their \\"suburbs\\" are on the northwest side of the Na river, while Topor is on the opposite south bank across from Wakpekan. Despite the town's large size, most structures are traditional mud-and-stick homes. As of the mid-1980s, when the township was organized, few had running water or electricity. Kplio (a dialect of Grebo) is the primary language of the residents, but English is the official language of instruction in the schools. The regional high school is in Barclayville, along with several public and private (Christian) schools for grades K-8. Many Christian religious denominations have churches and/or missions in Barclayville including Catholic, Methodist, Baptist, and a variety of other evangelical congregations. Most of population also follows local animist practices. Prior to the Liberian Civil War, much of the male adult population were on government payroll employed as teachers, employees of the courts, or serving as government officials or civil service staff. Upland rice farming is the primary occupation of most adults. Each village lays claim to large areas of communal land that extend several miles inland from the town. They carry out slash and burn farming, rotating to a new section of land every year in order to allow the soil to recover its fertility. Because of the distance from the villages to these outlying farms, it is common for the women and younger children to live on the farms during the growing season. There the women also establish vegetable gardens and plant cassava. Farming within Barclayville is limited as crops serve as fodder for the freely roaming livestock and fowl, including cows, sheep, goats and chickens. In June 2005 the UN Integrated Regional Information Regional Network reported that the roads leading to Barclayville had decayed during the years of civil war and become overgrown by dense bush. They were impassable except by foot. ==References== Category:Grand Kru County Category:County capitals in Liberia ","title":"Barclayville"},{"id":"2564107","text":"This is a list of the Leaders of the Opposition of the Yukon Territory, Canada, since 1978 when responsible government was given to the territory.

This film is based on the early days of Def Jam Recordings and up-and-coming record producer Russell Simmons (renamed Russell Walker in the film), portrayed by Blair Underwood in his feature film debut. Simmons was the film's co-producer and story consultant; he also had a cameo in the film as a club owner named Crocket. ==Plot== Russell Walker has signed all of the hottest acts to his Krush Groove record label, including Run-D.M.C., Dr. Jeckyll & Mr. Hyde (Alonzo Brown), and Kurtis Blow. Rick Rubin produces their records. When Run-D.M.C. has a hit record and Russell doesn't have the money to press records, he borrows money from a street hustler. At the same time, Russell and his brother Run are both competing for the heart of R&B; singer-percussionist Sheila E. Also appearing in the film are LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, New Edition, The Fat Boys and some of their songs, as well as others from Chaka Khan, Debbie Harry, and the Gap Band. Members of the R&B; group Full Force also make a cameo in the film as bodyguards. ==Cast== The following appeared as themselves, except where noted: *Blair Underwood (as Russell Walker) *Sheila E. *Run-D.M.C. & Jam Master Jay *The Fat Boys (Prince Markie Dee, Kool Rock Ski, The Human Beat Box) *Kurtis Blow *New Edition (Ralph Tresvant, Bobby Brown, Michael Bivins, Ronnie DeVoe, Ricky Bell) *Beastie Boys *LL Cool J *Russell Simmons (as Crocket) *Richard Gant (as Jay B.) *Lisa Gay Hamilton (as Iesha) *Rick Rubin *Nayobe *Vicky Ruane (as Girl Friday) *Dr. Jeckyll & Mr. Hyde (Andre Harrell and Alonzo Brown) *Brian \\"B-Fine\\" and Paul Anthony George of Full Force (as Jay B.'s bodyguards) Chris Rock appeared uncredited as a man standing next to phone during the fight in the club. Kara Vallow appeared uncredited as a Hip Hop Dancer. Coati Mundi was seen as a record shop owner. ==Differences between the film and reality== Krush Groove is based on the inception of the Def Jam Recordings label and the hardships that artists Run-D.M.C. and Russell Simmons faced to become successful. Simmons began his career trying to get his company Rush Management up and running. However, in the movie, he is shown as already being teamed up with producer Rick Rubin to form Def Jam, referred to as Krush Groove Records in the film. In reality, the label was started by Rubin in 1984 in his college dorm at New York University. The movie starts off with Run-D.M.C. and Kurtis Blow, known as the King of Rap, as two of the first artists to sign with the label, with both Blow and Run-D.M.C. as artists, songwriters, and record producers. The beginning of the movie opens with Run-D.M.C. in the studio performing \\"King of Rock\\" for Simmons, Rubin, and Blow. However, the group was not always involved in the Def Jam scene as shown in the movie, and Rubin was not the producer of \\"King of Rock.\\" Run and DMC had to persuade both Simmons and their original producer and bass player, Larry Smith, to give them a chance to record a demo. With the lyrics that Smith had once bought off of Run for $100, the group's first demo, \\"It's Like That\\", was created. Larry Smith was the producer of Run-D.M.C.'s first two albums, despite them being credited to Rick Rubin, who produced the group's third album, Raising Hell. However, in the movie, Larry Smith's role as producer is not portrayed at all. Later on, the team was joined by its first popular teen sensation, LL Cool J, who plays a very small role in the movie at the age of 17. Playing himself, LL Cool J is discovered through his piece \\"I Can’t Live without My Radio\\", which is performed at an audition in front of Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Jam Master Jay, DMC and Rubin in The latter apartment. In reality, LL Cool J was discovered in Rubin's apartment but not through an audition. While going through a box of demos, Beastie Boy Ad-Rock stumbled across LL's demo tape. With this, he produced a beat and co-wrote \\"I Need a Beat\\" with LL and Rubin, which launched both of their careers, which allowed the Def Jam label to take off. The song \\"I Can't Live without My Radio\\" was made for the movie as a way for LL Cool J to star in it. However, this song was also one of the hit songs on his debut album Radio. Other artists that were a part of the Rush Management roster, but did not have a major role in the film, include Beastie Boys, Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, and Whodini. Characters that were not part of Rush Management but greatly contributed to the new scene were the Fat Boys, Sheila E, and New Edition. The Fat Boys were the first group to showcase a human beat box while rhyming. In the movie, the group originally referred to itself as the Disco Three. It was not until a scene in an Italian buffet, where the three boys took the phrase all you can eat to the next level by eating everything. When the group realized that they were really fat, they decided to give themselves the name Fat Boys. In reality, the name Fat Boys was suggested by the group's manager when he received a $350 hotel bill for extra breakfast ordered by the group on their European tour. As portrayed in the movie, the group was discovered through the Coca-Cola and Tin Pan Apple hip-hop contest at Radio City Music Hall, where the trio won the grand prize—a recording contract—but had entered the contest to win the second-place prize, a stereo set. The group perform their songs \\"Don't You Dog Me\\", \\"All You Can Eat\\", \\"Fat Boys\\", and \\"Pump it Up.\\" Throughout the movie, Sheila E. and Russell Simmons are romantically involved, which discouraged Run, who was always interested in her. In reality, Run did not like the concept of being disloyal to his brother, and the romance between and Sheila was made up. Sheila E. made it into the film simply because they wanted a love interest, like in most films, and she recorded for Warner Bros. Records, the sister company of the film's distributor. In the movie. Sheila plays herself, a drummer and percussionist, in which she performs her songs \\"Holly Rock\\" and \\"A Love Bizarre\\". In addition, all of the money issues that Russell Simmons faced in funding the label by borrowing from loan sharks and friends is also false. The movie was not made the way the artists desired, but with all the talent of that time and most of the members of the Def Jam and Rush Management family. The purpose of the movie, according to Russell Simmons, was to showcase the array of young talent emerging from New York's black music scene and depict its vibrancy.Russell Simmons Biography – life, family, childhood, parents, history, wife, school, mother, young http://www.notablebiographies.com/news/Sh-Z/Simmons-Russell.html#ixzz1LufjAt4W ==Production== Krush Groove was filmed in The Bronx, Manhattan (including at least one scene in the Marble Hill projects) and Queens in 26 days at a cost of $3 million. Among the locations where the movie was shot was the famous Disco Fever, a popular club during the embryonic stages of hip hop that, by the time of the film, had fallen on some hard times. Disco Fever owner Sal Abbatiello expected the movie not only to turn the spotlight on the burgeoning hip-hop movement but also to \\"bring attention [back] to the club\\" and so agreed to have scenes shot there. Unfortunately, the attention surrounding the filming brought the scrutiny of the local authorities, who shut the club down for good on the last day of shooting for not having all the proper licenses and permits. There was also a scene shot in Shepard Hall of the historic City College of New York. During an interview to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the film, Russell Simmons reflected on the legacy of Krush Groove and its position in hip-hop culture history. The film, Simmons said, is still recognizable not only for having brought together so many Def Jam stars at the time, but for also introducing new talent, such as LL Cool J. Cool J was so persistent during filming, showing up to shooting locations and performing freestyles, that producers ended up putting him in the final cut. This backdoor auditioning process became a staple of the production. ==Reception== The movie had a mixed reception. When the film was in release, fights broke out at some screenings. ==Soundtrack== Music from the Original Motion Picture Krush Groove (also called just Krush Groove Soundtrack) is a soundtrack album by various urban-oriented artists, which was released on Warner Bros. Records in 1985. The album peaked at #79 on the Pop chart and #14 on the R&B; chart. The Krush Groove soundtrack was released on Warner Bros. Records in 1985 and featured songs from the movie. Only 1,000 copies of the album were ever pressed on compact disc. The film was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song for the song All You Can Eat. ===Track listing=== Other songs appeared in the film but were not on the album soundtrack: * Autumn – \\"Kold Krush\\" * Run-D.M.C. – \\"King of Rock\\", \\"It's Like That\\", \\"Can You Rock it Like This\\", \\"You're Blind\\" * Fat Boys – \\"Don't You Dog Me\\", \\"Fat Boys\\", \\"Pump it Up (Let's Get Funky)\\" * Sheila E. – \\"A Love Bizarre\\" * UTFO – \\"Pick up the Pace\\" (released as the b-side of \\"All You Can Eat\\" on Warner Bros. Records 28829) * Nayobe – \\"Please Don't Go\\" * New Edition – \\"My Secret\\" * Chad Elliot – \\"I Want You to Be My Girl\\" ==Home media== The movie was released on VHS in 1986, then DVD in 2003. Among the special extras included on the DVD are commentary from Underwood, Schultz, and The Source magazine Senior Editor Brett Johnson, a theatrical trailer for the movie, and the Krush Groove All-Stars video \\"Krush Groovin'.\\" ==Other references== Krush Groove is referenced in the movie Dogma (1999) as being the subject of a bet between the two fallen angels, Bartleby and Loki, on whether it was going to be a bigger movie than E.T.

Wells, Longman pronunciation dictionary, 3rd edition (2008), entry Philoctetes.) is a play by Sophocles (Aeschylus and Euripides also each wrote a Philoctetes but theirs have not survived). The play was written during the Peloponnesian War. It is one of the seven extant tragedies by Sophocles. It was first performed at the City Dionysia in 409 BC, where it won first prize. The story takes place during the Trojan War (after the majority of the events of the Iliad, but before the Trojan Horse). It describes the attempt by Neoptolemus and Odysseus to bring the disabled Philoctetes, the master archer, back to Troy from the island of Lemnos. ==Background== When Heracles was near his death, he wished to be burned on a funeral pyre while still alive. In the play Philoctetes, Sophocles references the myth in which no one but Philoctetes would light Heracles' funeral pyre, and in return for this favor Heracles gave Philoctetes his bow (seen in later texts, such as Ovid's Metamorphoses). Philoctetes left with the Greeks to participate in the Trojan War, but was bitten on the foot by a snake while walking on Chryse, a sacred ground. The bite caused him constant agony, and emitted a horrible smell. For this reason he was left by Odysseus and the Atreidai (sons of Atreus) on the desert island Lemnos. Ten years pass, and the Greeks capture the Trojan seer Helenus, son of Priam. He foretells that they will need the master archer Philoctetes and the bow of Heracles to win the war. Odysseus sails back to Lemnos with Neoptolemus (son of Achilles) to get Philoctetes. The task is not easy, as Philoctetes bitterly hates Odysseus and the Greeks for leaving him there. ==Synopsis== Sophocles' Philoctetes begins with their arrival on the island. Odysseus explains to Neoptolemus that he must perform a shameful action in order to garner future glory—to take Philoctetes by tricking him with a false story while Odysseus hides. Neoptolemus is portrayed as an honorable boy, and so it takes some persuading to get him to play this part. To gain Philoctetes' trust, Neoptolemus tricks Philoctetes into thinking he hates Odysseus as well. Neoptolemus does this by telling Philoctetes that Odysseus has his father's (Achilles) armor. He tells Philoctetes that this armor was his right by birth, and Odysseus would not give it up to him. After gaining Philoctetes' trust and offering him a ride home, Neoptolemus is allowed to look at the bow of Heracles. Neoptolemus holds the bow while Philoctetes is going into an unbearable fit of pain in his foot. Feeling ashamed, Neoptolemus debates giving it back to him. Odysseus appears, and a series of arguments ensue. Eventually Neoptolemus' conscience gains the upper hand, and he returns the bow. After many threats made on both sides, Odysseus flees. Neoptolemus then tries to talk Philoctetes into coming to Troy by his own free will, but Philoctetes does not agree. In the end, Neoptolemus consents to take Philoctetes back to Greece, even though that will expose him to the anger of the army. This appears to be the conclusion of the play—however, as they are leaving, Heracles (now a deity) appears above them and tells Philoctetes that if he goes to Troy, he will be cured and the Greeks will win. Philoctetes willingly obeys him.Summary description of the play; classics.uc.edu The play ends here. When Philoctetes later fights in Troy, his foot is healed, and he wins glory, killing many Trojans (including Paris). == Themes and ideas== The concept of having a moral high ground is a key aspect in this play. The play makes the spectator question what morality means to each man. Furthermore, the play makes one question the struggle between what is right for the individual versus what is right for the group. It is possible that this struggle is irreconcilable. More specifically, one can see this struggle by looking at what has happened to Philoctetes versus what the Greeks need. Another theme is that of trauma. Philoctetes suffers wounds that do not heal. Furthermore, Philoctetes' suffering is now what defines him, yet Neoptolemus pretends not to know Philoctetes at first. In other words, Philoctetes' suffering should at least make him known, but it is as if his story is dead.Lines 255-263, Sophocles. Philoctetes. Electra and Other Plays. Transl. E. F. Watling. Middlesex: Penguin Books, 1953. pp. 162–212. ==Contemporary adaptations== === The Theatre of War Project === The story of Philoctetes, dealing with the wounded man and the interwoven relationships with others, has been frequently noted. In 2005 Bryan Doerries, writer and director, began a series of readings of the play in the New York City area, noting the reactions of the audience to the reading, especially related to the reactions of audience members to the interaction of the suffering soldier and the conflicted caregiver. The project revolves around presenting such readings, especially to audiences of medical professionals and students. A number of readings were followed by a panel discussion about doctor-patient relationships, involving presenters in psychiatry, physicians, and military medical personnel. The concept has also been extended to training of medical students, such as a presentation also in 2007 to the first year medical class at Weill Medical College of Cornell University. In 2008, at a conference dedicated to finding new ways to help US Marines recover from post-traumatic stress and other disorders after serving in Iraq or Afghanistan, four New York actors presented a dramatic reading from Philoctetes and Ajax.latimes.com Story by Tony Perry, Los Angeles Times Staff Writer === Fictional adaptations === * The Cure at Troy by Seamus Heaney, based on Philoctetes * Neutral Ground by Tom Stoppard, loosely based on Philoctetes (as stated in the introduction to Stoppard's collected television plays). * The Man in the Maze by Robert Silverberg, a retelling of the play in a science fictional idiom. * Heracles' Bow (short story) by Madeline Miller * New Amsterdam (2018 TV series) season 2 episode 7 2019 episode Good Soldiers ==Translations== * Thomas Francklin, 1759 – verse: full text * Richard C.

It is the sequel to Crocodile Dundee II (1988) and the third and final film of the Crocodile Dundee trilogy. Hogan and Linda Kozlowski reprise their roles as Michael \\"Crocodile\\" Dundee and Sue Charlton, respectively. The film was shot on location in Los Angeles and in Queensland. Actor Paul Hogan reported that the inspiration for the storyline came during a tour of Litomyšl, Czech Republic in 1993. ==Plot== Michael \\"Crocodile\\" Dundee (Paul Hogan) is living in the Australian outback with Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) and their young son Mikey (Serge Cockburn). Crocodile hunting has been made illegal, and Mick is reduced to wrestling crocodiles for the entertainment of tourists. He has a rival in the business, another outback survivalist named Jacko (Alec Wilson). When an opportunity arises for Sue to become the Los Angeles bureau chief of a newspaper owned by her father, Mick and his family cross the Pacific to California. In the United States, both Mick and his son have encounters with the locals, causing cross-cultural mishaps. Mick becomes an undercover amateur sleuth, helping to probe the mysterious death of his wife's predecessor at the newspaper, while Mikey attends a local school, where he quickly impresses his classmates and teacher with his outback survival skills. Because the case takes up so much of their time, Mick and Sue eventually call in Jacko to babysit their son; immediately, Jacko and Mikey's teacher become interested in each other. It is revealed that the dead reporter had been investigating a film studio, which is about to make a sequel to the action film Lethal Agent, despite the title's commercial failure. Mick becomes suspicious when several paintings from Southern Europe are brought onto the set; although at first he suspects drug smuggling, the pictures themselves are revealed to be missing art from a museum in former Yugoslavia, thought lost in the recent civil wars. They are to appear in the film as mere props, to be publicly 'destroyed' in a scene in which they are set on fire, at which point they will have been exchanged for copies. Attempting to secure one of the paintings as evidence, Mick, Sue, and Jacko run afoul of the studio director and his thugs. Using the studio's props and three lions used in filming to defeat the gangsters, Mick and Sue solve the case and return to Australia, where they are officially married. ==Cast== * Paul Hogan as Michael \\"Crocodile\\" Dundee * Linda Kozlowski as Sue Charlton * Jere Burns as Arnan Rothman * Jonathan Banks as Miloš Drubnik * Alec Wilson as Jacko * Gerry Skilton as Nugget O'Cass * Steve Rackman as Donk * Serge Cockburn as Michael \\"Mikey\\" Dundee * Aida Turturro as Jean Ferraro * Paul Rodriguez as Diego * Kaitlin Hopkins as Miss Mathis ==Reception== On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a score of 11% based on reviews from 80 critics.

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2 out of 4 and wrote: \\"It may not be brilliant, but who would you rather your kids took as a role model: Crocodile Dundee, David Spade or Tom Green?\\" Variety called it \\"Amiable rather than genuinely funny.\\" The film was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Remake or Sequel but lost to Planet of the Apes. ===Box office=== The film grossed $7,759,103 at the box office in Australia.Film Victoria - Australian Films at the Australian Box Office The film debuted in 4th place at the US box office behind Bridget Jones's Diary (which was #1 in its second weekend), Spy Kids and Along Came a Spider. It grossed $39 million worldwide, below the total gross of the previous two films. In a 2017 interview, comedian and actor Tom Green stated that the box office receipts for his film Freddy Got Fingered did not reflect the actual attendance, as he thinks that movie goers under the age of seventeen bought tickets to Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles and snuck into the theater showing his film. ==References* * * Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles at Oz Movie Category:Crocodile Dundee Category:2001 films Category:American sequel films Category:Australian films Category:2000s action comedy films Category:Australian comedy films Category:American action comedy films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Basil Poledouris Category:Films directed by Simon Wincer Category:Films set in Australia Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in Australia Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Australian sequel films Category:2001 comedy films ","title":"Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles"},{"id":"2564146","text":"The Toll, 1991 The Toll was a rock band from Columbus, Ohio active from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s. It consisted of vocalist Brad Circone, guitarist Rick Silk, bassist Greg Bartram, and Brett Mayo on drums. Unusually, many of their songs incorporated spoken narratives. They had earned a reputation for their live performances and were signed to Geffen on the strength of a single show, although they had previously recorded a demo for Chrysalis. The Toll's first album was titled The Price of Progression, and \\"Jonathan Toledo,\\" which included one of the band's trademark narratives and clocked in at more than ten minutes, was the first single. It received rotation on MTV (including \\"120 Minutes\\") and for some time held the record as the longest non-Michael Jackson video ever played on the station. However, \\"Jonathan Toledo\\" failed to break the band, and the second single, \\"Soldier's Room,\\" also went nowhere. The album was produced by Steve Thompson and Michael Barbiero, who engineered Guns N' Roses album, Appetite for Destruction. Their second collection of songs, the concept album The Parable of Pariah, was rejected by Geffen, although several songs from it were re-recorded and included on their second album release, Sticks and Stones and Broken Bones. This record received almost no promotion from the label and did not do well, and Geffen dropped the band, which broke up soon afterward.

Trying to follow the advice of his father (Dan Aykroyd), he tries to gain friends by trying to be polite and interested in others. His attempts are noticed by his new roommates Chris (Thomas Sadoski), Adam (Zak Orth), and Noah (Jimmi Simpson), three rich, spoiled, obnoxious city boys who consider his polite behavior, working class background, and determination for education lame, and they brand him a loser. To salvage their reputation, the trio concoct a false story to the housing administration about Paul’s attitude and have him thrown out of the dorm. Paul takes residence in a veterinary hospital. Chris meets Paul and again concocts another story about how they were trying to help him as a ploy for Paul to let them use the hospital to throw parties, after an incident where a resident at the dorm fell sick with alcohol poisoning forbid them from holding any parties thereon. Paul meets classmate Dora Diamond (Mena Suvari) and develops an attraction to her, unaware that she is having an affair with their decorated but highly pretentious English professor Edward Alcott (Greg Kinnear). Dora is equally as intelligent as Paul but doesn't have a scholarship and works shifts as a waitress in a strip club to pay for her tuition until she is unceremoniously fired. To avoid a long daily commute which she can no longer afford, Dora asks Alcott to let her live with him for a while to which he selfishly declines for fear of losing his tenure at the university if their relationship is found out. Paul and Dora bump into each other one night and Paul invites her to an Everclear concert after discovering when they met that she is a fan. Dora agrees to the date, but first goes to a job interview for a night shift in a convenience store, but is denied the position because she's a woman. Adam is at the same store buying beer and pretends to be sympathetic as a ploy to invite her to a party which she accepts, but says she will be there only for a short time so she can meet Paul. At the party, one of the boys slips a roofie into Dora's drink and she passes out. Paul returns dejected from the concert to a huge mess and an unresponsive Dora and immediately rushes her to the hospital. At the hospital, Paul pretends to be her boyfriend since neither he or Dora can afford to keep her there overnight. He also learns that Dora listed Alcott as her case of emergency contact which he tells Chris the next morning without thinking. Alcott tells emergency officials he doesn't really know her when they contact him. Paul bonds with Dora as she recovers and they start to develop feelings for one another; he also learns that Dora cannot see past her blind infatuation with Alcott even when she says even though he loves her, he doesn't want a relationship. While Paul continues with his studies, Dora searches for a new job. She pulls Paul out of class and invites him out to celebrate receiving a spot in a medical experiment. They steal a loaf of bread from a bakery, coffee from a dispenser in the park and sneak into a Broadway show. Paul goes out to grab a pizza and a movie for both of them hoping it may lead to something further between them only to return to find Alcott with Dora and learning that Alcott has changed his mind about Dora living with him. Alcott reveals to Dora that Chris, Noah and Adam are blackmailing him with the knowledge of their relationship in return for a passing grade on their transcript and also tells her that he believes Paul is in on it. After discovering roofies were involved at the party, Paul steals Noah's supply and replaces them with placebos. Paul then pays a visit to Alcott's office to ask how Dora is doing and is instead given his final exam as a take-home test by Alcott to buy his silence, Paul takes the moral high ground and refuses the test, jeopardizing his scholarship and place in the university. Dora, since living with Alcott, has become his errand-girl and overhears Paul on the phone with his father talking about how much he misses her. Alcott then admits he learned that Paul had nothing to do with the blackmail, but still intends to fail him. Dora then realizes that Paul is the one who really loves her and terminates her affair with Alcott, beginning a relationship with Paul. Afterwards, Adam, Noah, and Chris' behavior get the better of them and their lives plummet into failure, Alcott is found out and sent to prison for having an affair with a different student who is underage, and Paul and Dora remain happy in their relationship. ==Cast== ==Music== The music was composed by David Kitay.

It was released on February 23, 2004 through Century Media Records. There are two different versions of the album; in a CD version and an LP with different cover art for each. The album is also available as a limited edition version with a bonus live acoustic CD titled The Calm Before the Flood. It was also released on vinyl by Profound Lore Records as a 2-LP album in a clear wax case limited to only 500 copies. The album also features two videos that were made for \\"Ocean Land\\" and \\"Norra el Norra\\" their first videos. The album was made in a highly arranged fashion and took six years to be arranged, composed and produced and is therefore the main reason for the long wait between albums. ==Synopsis== The album tells the story of three sons (Angels) of the seventh (in the mythology the number seven refers to God). The seventh was divided into three, representing the divide of the Abrahamic religion into three main streams: Judaism, Islam and Christianity. Each angel was given a power and representation. The first angel is Judaism; he is represented by a Star of David and his power is magic. The second angel is Islam; he is represented by a half of moon and his power was his strength. The third angel is Christianity; he is represented by the cross and his power is his wisdom. God had forbid the angels from reuniting because of fear of their strength. Ignoring the divine order, the angels united into one angel, who immediately got exiled from heaven to earth and was divided into three again, sentenced to fight each other until they can prove themselves and get back into heaven. The angels then try to convince humanity to stop their sins and warn them of a coming flood as punishment if they do not. The album describes the journey of the three, their convincing, and in the end, their failure. ==Reception== As of March 8, 2020, Mabool has a rating of 8.85 based on 738 votes on Metal Storm.

Initially known as the Marijuana Business Access to Banking Act, it was rebranded as the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act in 2017. On September 25, 2019, the House of Representatives passed the SAFE Banking Act by a 321–103 vote, marking the first time that a standalone cannabis reform bill had passed either chamber of Congress. ==Political campaigns== ===2006=== Perlmutter won the Democratic nomination for the 7th district by defeating former State Representative Peggy Lamm and college professor Herb Rubenstein, with 53% of the vote in the primary. State education chairman Rick O'Donnell was unopposed for the Republican nomination. Dave Chandler, a Green, was also a candidate. The seat was held by Republican Bob Beauprez, who was reelected to a second term in 2004 with 55% of the vote, after winning his first term by only 121 votes. He left the seat at the end of the 2004–2006 term, having failed in his bid to become Governor of Colorado. In late September, O'Donnell was put on the defensive when ads appeared noting that he had previously supported abolishing Social Security. A Survey USA poll soon after that showed Perlmutter with a 54 to 37 percent lead, although GOP consultants guessed that the support was \\"soft\\". An October 4 poll released by Zogby showed Perlmutter ahead of O'Donnell by 45-34 percent. Cook Political Report rating: Republican Toss Up. CQPolitics rating: No Clear Favorite. In the end, Perlmutter (54%) soundly defeated O'Donnell (42%) for the congressional seat, helping Democrats to regain the majority in the U.S. House. ===2008=== Perlmutter won against Republican nominee John W. Lerew. ===2010=== Perlmutter defeated Republican nominee Ryan Frazier and Libertarian nominee Buck Bailey on November 2, 2010. The 7th Congressional district had been cited as a GOP target in 2010. ===2012=== Perlmutter defeated Republican nominee Joe Coors Jr. on November 6, 2012. Perlmutter's victory came despite new congressional boundaries that made his district 4 percent less Democratic. Perlmutter was ahead by 9 percentage points in Jefferson County, where 60 percent of the voters live. Perlmutter led Coors by 17 percentage points in Adams County, where 40 percent of the constituents in the newly drawn 7th district live. ===2014=== Perlmutter defeated Republican nominee Don Ytterberg in the 2014 general election. He won with 55.1% of the vote. ===2016=== Perlmutter defeated Republican nominee George Athanasopoulos and Libertarian nominee Martin L. Buchanan in the 2016 general election. He won with 55.18% of the vote. ===2018=== On April 9, 2017, Perlmutter announced his candidacy for Governor of Colorado in the 2018 election. On July 10, 2017, Perlmutter announced that he will drop out of the gubernatorial race and will not seek reelection to his congressional seat. However, on August 21, 2017, he announced he had reversed his decision again and ran for reelection for his congressional seat. He defeated Republican nominee Mark Barrington, winning re-election with 60.42% of the vote ==Personal life== Perlmutter has three children. He and his first wife, Deana, divorced in 2008. In November 2010, Perlmutter married Nancy Henderson. Nancy Perlmutter teaches mathematics and has three adult children.

According to the Book of Later Han, during the reign of Emperor Shun of Han ( 125–144), Gong Chong (宮崇), one of Gan Ji's disciples, submitted the Taiping Qingling Shu (太平清領書) to the emperor. Some believe that the character Yu Ji (于吉) in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a misspelling of Gan Ji. In the novel, Yu Ji wandered around the Jiangdong region, chatting with soldiers and civilians, making everyone believe that he was a magician and healer. The warlord of Jiangdong, Sun Ce, heard of Yu Ji's magic and grew suspicious of him, thinking that he was casting spells on people. Sun Ce accused Yu Ji of sorcery and had him executed. However, Yu Ji's spirit returned to haunt Sun Ce and eventually caused him to die from shock. Many historians reject the account of Yu Ji/Gan Ji and Sun Ce, suggesting that it is propaganda or merely fiction. Reasons for this include Gan Ji's previously recorded activities (which would have made Gan Ji quite old by the time he met Sun Ce). Only a select few historical texts mention Yu Ji being killed by Sun Ce. Of those that do, Yu Ji is not necessarily portrayed as an innocent victim; rather, in the Jiangbiao Zhuan (江表傳), Sun Ce believes that Yu Ji is misleading the people (Sun Ce was a strict Confucian). ==In popular culture== In the video games Dynasty Warriors 5 and Dynasty Warriors 7, there is a stage based on Sun Ce's confrontation with Yu Ji, a fictional event. In the stage Sun Ce has to fight Yu Ji clones, as well as a Da Qiao and Sun Jian clone. The 1983 Hong Kong film The Weird Man by the Shaw Brothers Studio is loosely based on the story of Yu Ji and Sun Ce. Yu Ji was put to death by Sun Ce and he later comes back as a ghost and wreaks havoc on Sun Ce for revenge by possessing his army and his wife. He also helped Sun Ce kill Xu Gong while killing Sun Ce in the process. In this film, he is seen as the hero while Sun Ce is portrayed as the anti-hero. The Weird Man was remade in 1993 as Ninja in Ancient China. ==See also== * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms ==References== * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

The name means \\"milk burek\\". It may be made in a pan, with filo layered on top and underneath and cut into square portions, or rolled into individual servings (often approximately long). It is served or coated with a clear, sweet syrup. The custard may be flavored with lemon, orange, or rose. Unlike mille-feuille, which it otherwise resembles, the custard is baked with the pastry, not added afterwards. The Turkish laz böreği is similar, but is made with a type of pudding called muhallebi instead of semolina custard. It is popular in Rize and Artvin provinces in the Black Sea Region, home of many Laz people.

It is a form of outsourcing. A contract manufacturer performing packaging operations is called copacker or a contract packager. Brand name companies focus on product innovation, design and sales, while the manufacturing takes place in independent factories (the turnkey suppliers). Most turnkey suppliers specialize in simply manufacturing physical products, but some are also able to handle a significant part of the design and customization process if needed. Some turnkey suppliers specialize in one base component (ex. memory chips) or a base process (e.g. plastic molding). ==Business model== An advertisement for contract manufacturing services, in Popular Mechanics, 1905. In a contract manufacturing business model, the hiring firm approaches the contract manufacturer with a design or formula. The contract manufacturer will quote the parts based on processes, labor, tooling, and material costs. Typically a hiring firm will request quotes from multiple CMs. After the bidding process is complete, the hiring firm will select a source, and then, for the agreed-upon price, the CM acts as the hiring firm's factory, producing and shipping units of the design on behalf of the hiring firm. Job production is, in essence, manufacturing on a contract basis, and thus it forms a subset of the larger field of contract manufacturing. But the latter field also includes, in addition to jobbing, a higher level of outsourcing in which a product-line-owning company entrusts its entire production to a contractor, rather than just outsourcing parts of it. ==Industries that use the practice== A contract manufacturer produced this knife with a protected geographical indication for a brand outside Solingen that usually sells cookware. Many industries use this process, especially the aerospace, defense, computer, semiconductor, energy, medical, food manufacturing, personal care, packaging, and automotive fields. Some types of contract manufacturing include CNC machining, complex assembly, aluminum die casting, grinding, broaching, gears, and forging. The pharmaceutical industry uses this process with CMs called contract manufacturing organizations. In the semiconductor industry, this practice is called the foundry model. Contract manufacturing is specially prevalent in the electronics industry. ==Purpose, benefits, and risks== There are many benefits as well as risks to contract manufacturing. Companies are finding many reasons why they should outsource their production to other companies. However, production outside of the company has many risks attached. Companies must first identify their core competencies before deciding about contract manufacturers. A company's competencies are what make them competitive in the marketplace. If a company allows another company to take control of them, it loses that advantage. When deciding about contract manufacture, the company should weigh the benefits and associated risks. For small companies, contract manufacturing may not be a good business strategy. For large companies that are trying to extend into new markets, contract manufacturing may be a good choice. ===Benefits=== * Cost savings – Companies save on their cost of capital because they do not have to pay for a facility and the equipment needed for production. They can also save on labor costs such as wages, training and benefits. Some companies may look to contract manufacture in low-cost countries, such as India, to benefit from the low cost of labor., Knowdell, Jenny. \\"The Benefits and Disadvantages of Contract Manufacturing.\\" IQS Newsroom. Industrial Quick Search, Inc, 16 April 2010. Web. 21 Feb 2011. * Mutual benefit to contract site – A contract between the manufacturer and the company it’s producing for may last several years. The manufacturer will know that it will have a steady flow of business until then. * Advanced skills – Companies can take advantage of skills that they may not possess, but the contract manufacturer does. The contract manufacturer is likely to have relationships formed with raw material suppliers or methods of efficiency within their production.Cohen, Soshanah, and Joseph Roussel. Strategic Supply Chain Management: The Five Disciplines for Top Performance. United States: The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc, 2005. 316. Print. * Quality – Contract manufacturers are likely to have their own methods of quality control in place that helps them to detect counterfeit or damaged materials early. * Focus – Companies can focus on their core competencies better if they can hand off base production to an outside company. * Economies of scale – Contract manufacturers have multiple customers that they produce for. Because they are servicing multiple customers, they can offer reduced costs in acquiring raw materials by benefiting from economies of scale. The more units there are in one shipment, the less expensive the price per unit will be. ===Risks=== * Lack of Control – When a company signs the contract allowing another company to produce their product, they lose a significant amount of control over that product. They can only suggest strategies to the contract manufacturer; they cannot force them to implement them. * Relationships - It is imperative that the company forms a good relationship with its contract manufacturer. The company must keep in mind that the manufacturer has other customers. They cannot force them to produce their product before a competitor’s. Most companies mitigate this risk by working cohesively with the manufacturer and awarding good performance with additional business. * Quality concerns – When entering into a contract, companies must make sure that the manufacturer’s standards are congruent with their own. They should evaluate the methods in which they test products to make sure they are of good quality. The company has to rely on the contract manufacturer for having good suppliers that also meet these standards. * Intellectual property loss – When entering into a contract, a company is divulging their formulas or technologies. This is why it is important that a company not give out any of its core competencies to contract manufacturers. It is very easy for an employee to download such information from a computer and steal it. * Outsourcing risks – Although outsourcing to low-cost countries has become very popular, it does bring along risks such as language barriers, cultural differences and long lead times. This could make the management of contract manufacturers more difficult, expensive and time-consuming. * Capacity constraints – If a company does not make up a large portion of the contract manufacturer’s business, they may find that they are de-prioritized over other companies during high production periods. Thus, they may not obtain the product they need when they need it. * Loss of flexibility and responsiveness – Without direct control over the manufacturing facility, the company will lose some of its ability to respond to disruptions in the supply chain. It may also hurt their ability to respond to demand fluctuations, risking their customer service levels. * Pricing – This addition of a second company and second profit margin to be achieved, adds in cost to the product. The impact is seen either in a higher selling price to the customer or in a reduced profit margin for the company. ==Protectionism== In an international context, establishing a foreign subsidiary as a contract manufacturer can have favorable tax benefits for the parent company, allowing them to reduce overall tax liabilities and increase profits, depending upon the activities of the contract manufacturer. This is a form of true protectionism. The iPad and iPhone, which are products of Apple Inc., are manufactured in China by Foxconn. Some devices may also be manufactured by Pegatron. Apple may move some fraction of iPhone assembly into the United States in the near future. ==See also== *Subcontractor (SUB) *Interactive Contract Manufacturing (ICM) *Electronic Contract Manufacturing (ECM) *Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) *Original Design Manufacturer (ODM) *Joint Design Manufacturing (JDM) *Contract Manufacturing Organization (CMO) *Private Label or Parts List (PL) *Bill of materials (BOM) *Supplier evaluation *Contract packager *Turnkey ==References== ==External links== * Contract Manufacturing Pitfalls and What the Wrong Production System Can Cost You * The Vital Role of Contract Manufacturing in Supply Chain Management and Optimization Category:Manufacturing Category:Outsourcing ","title":"Contract manufacturer"},{"id":"2564189","text":"Triptolemos (Ancient Greek: Τριπτόλεμος) is a lost play of Sophocles.

The band's name was taken from a single called \\"Oo Oo Rudi\\" by the Jook. Carson left, and after bassist Johnny Stewart joined, Marshall moved to drums and the group adopted a pop punk sound. The band wore a stage uniform of boiler suits, stolen by drummer Marshall from his place of work. Original Stiff Little Fingers bassist Gordon Blair joined in 1977, replacing Stewart. The band's debut release was the \\"Big Time\\" single, the first release for Terri Hooley's Good Vibrations label in May 1978. It received positive reviews in the music press, and was later described by Henry McDonald of The Observer as \\"one of the most perfect pop songs to come out of this island\\". The single's success prompted the band to relocate to London. They failed to secure a record deal in London, and suffered a further setback when guitarist Matthews and drummer Marshall were jailed for a week after their Clapham squat was raided, and they returned to Belfast. In 1979, Rudi contributed \\"Overcome by Fumes\\" to the Battle of the Bands EP, and were offered a record deal by Polydor, on the condition that they replaced Marshall, but the offer was declined. A four- track EP of their own followed, and the band embarked on a tour of England. Blair was sacked, later joining the Outcasts, with Matthews moving to bass. A television appearance on BBC2's Something Else in 1980 showcased the band's proposed next single on Good Vibrations, \\"The Pressure's On\\"/\\"Who You\\", but the band left the label in frustration with Hooley. The band recorded a session for Mike Read's BBC Radio 1 show The Evening Session in June 1980, and a deal with Target Records was proposed, but failed with the label's demise.Gimarc, George (2005) Punk Diary: The Ultimate Trainspotter's Guide to Underground Rock 1970–1982, Backbeat Books, , p. 343 They were offered a deal with Ariola Records by Pete Waterman, but instead decided to sign with the Paul Weller-funded Jamming! label. Sessions for John Peel and David Jensen's radio shows and two further singles followed between 1981 and 1983, the latter (\\"Crimson\\") being named \\"Single of the Week\\" by Sounds. Rudi supported the Jam on their 1982 Transglobal Unity Express tour. When the Jam split up, the Jamming! label folded soon afterwards, and Rudi found themselves without a label, and also split up. Matthews, Marshall and Young re-emerged with a new band, Station Superheaven. Young later formed a series of bands including the Tigersharks, the Roughnecks and the Sabrejets; in the 2000s, he played in Shame Academy along with Greg Cowan of the Outcasts and Petesy Burns of Stalag 17. A compilation CD of Rudi's recordings was released in 1996 on the Cherry Red label Anagram.

Dawn asks Buffy why it is called a \\"CAT Scan\\" (do they test it on cats, or does the machine look like a cat?). Back at The Magic Box, Giles and Tara admire the new phone book advertisement for the magic shop while Anya is disappointed that she is not personally mentioned. Xander complains about Riley destroying the vampire crypt alone in the previous episode, and then the entire gang continues their search for information regarding the Beast. Giles agrees that it was reckless on Riley's part, while Anya expresses relief that the task was already completed, because she really hadn't wanted to start her day off with a slaughter (which, she notes, \\"just goes to show how much I've grown!\\"). In Glory's luxurious headquarters, a demon named Dreg offers a spell to Glory, groveling before her as she tries on elegant shoes, debating on whether they make her ankles look bony. Dreg promises that this spell will allow Glory to find the Key. She just needs some supplies, and she finds the advertisement for The Magic Box in the new phone book. Riley finds the front door to Buffy's house open, a blanket on the steps, and Spike in Buffy's room, sniffing her clothes. Spike declares that Buffy wouldn't care that he was in her room, and that the clothes- sniffing was just normal predator activity. Riley responds, \\"Yeah, what's a little sweater-sniffing between sworn enemies?\\" And drags him out and down the stairs, but not before Spike grabs a pair of Buffy's underwear. Spike taunts Riley with his knowledge about Buffy's mother going to the hospital (which Buffy had failed to mention to Riley), as well as the time he and Buffy had spent together the previous evening eating, drinking, and talking. Spike insinuates Riley cannot keep Buffy satisfied, and Riley tells him to stay away from Buffy and throws him out into the sunlight, with his blanket. Riley shows up at the hospital to comfort Buffy, who seems relieved to see him. She directs him to sit with Dawn in the waiting room while she talks to their mother. Joyce confesses to Buffy that the doctors have found a \\"shadow\\" in her CAT scan, and they need to do an initial operation to evaluate her condition, and to discover whether surgery is an option. At the Magic Box, the Scoobies continue to search for information that might indicate the origins, purpose, or weaknesses of Glory. Tara suggests that maybe the Beast is something that is too old for the books, which Giles believes may explain the presence of the Dagon Sphere, which is to ward against that \\"which cannot be named.\\" They discuss the possibility that Glory may predate language itself, when she herself shows up there and buys several items for a spell. The gang is, of course, oblivious to her true identity, and she leaves the store without incident. Back at the hospital, the doctor tells Buffy her mother has a brain tumor and presents her with her mother's options. Ben, an intern, gets the doctor away from Buffy, giving her a break from the doctor's constant questions. Riley takes Dawn to the park, where he tries to comfort her about her mother. Dawn tries to make Riley feel good by positively comparing him to Buffy's former boyfriend Angel, but unintentionally makes him feel worse: she relates that she thinks Riley is good for Buffy because Buffy was always in tears over her tumultuous relationship with Angel, but that she never cries over Riley - she never \\"gets that worked up\\" over him. The impact of this revelation is evident in his face - this is yet another way that he can see that Buffy has kept him at an emotional distance and that she feels no intensity in their relationship. Back at the Magic Shop, Buffy talks with the gang about the possibility of helping her mother through the use of magics. However, while Willow expresses willingness to help if she can, Tara and Giles both insist that the magical and the medical are not meant to mix, and that any attempts they made to help Joyce would likely only make things worse. They encourage her to put her faith in the doctors. Anya sorts through receipts and realizes that Glory had been to the shop, and Giles had sold her items that allows her to perform an ancient transmogrification spell. Buffy takes off in search of Glory, despite the concerns of Giles and her friends that Glory will merely overpower her again. At the Sunnydale Zoo, Glory steals a cobra and performs the spell with Dreg. Buffy arrives to stop her, temporarily interrupting the spell, but instead gets beaten up badly again. The cobra is transformed into a giant cobra monster with arms, and Glory sends the demon on a mission to locate the Key. Riley arrives at the magic shop in search of Buffy, but Xander confronts him about destroying the vampire crypt. The gang tells Riley that Buffy went after Glory, and he demands to know why they would let her do something so dangerous. Giles reminds Riley that \\"let\\" is not an issue when Buffy sets her mind to something. Xander tells Riley that Buffy is so upset about the situation with her mom that she needs something tangible to fight, and then asks Riley what his excuse is for his own reckless actions. Buffy calls Giles from the hospital and tells him to take care of Dawn while she stays with her mother. She stays with her mother as the doctor tells her more bad news about Joyce's condition - she has a brain tumor, and they don't know yet if it is operable or not. Riley returns to Willy's bar to drink away his worries and again encounters the vampire Sandy. He allows her to bite him in the alley, but stakes her. The cobra demon arrives at the magic shop and goes after Dawn. Dawn screams in fear and the cobra retreats. Realising that the cobra knows Dawn is the Key and is returning to inform Glory, Giles and Buffy go after the demon. Buffy catches up with it in a field near Glory's apartment and kills it, then lets out her pent-up frustration from her time at the hospital by continuing to beat up the lifeless cobra. Glory watches from a window, frustrated that her snake monster has failed to return in a timely manner. Joyce tells Dawn the truth about her health. Riley is there to comfort Buffy (wearing a turtleneck to hide his bite marks) but she refuses to accept comfort from him - she insists that she needs to stay strong for her family, refusing to cry. Joyce calls for Buffy and she turns and walks away, oblivious to his attempt to caress her face. Riley is left standing alone in the hallway, becoming increasingly frustrated with Buffy's inability or unwillingness to develop an emotional closeness with him, and to let herself be vulnerable around him. ==Production details== ===Writing=== When asked his opinion on the computer-generated snake used in this episode, writer David Fury says he was originally envisioning it as something \\"amorphous, bug-like, something non-human looking\\"; it was Marti Noxon who came up with the idea of using a reptile. From that idea, Noxon proposed that Buffy find it hiding in a reptile house. ==Continuity== * This episode sees the death of Sandy - the girl whom \\"Evil Willow\\" turned into a vampire in season three's \\"Doppelgangland\\". * When discussing the demon Glory can now summon, Xander exclaims \\"Just once I'd like a bunny worshiping cult.\\" To which Anya replies \\"That's great! Thanks for giving me those nightmares!\\" This is another example of Anya's irrational fear of bunnies. * When Dawn is talking to Riley at the merry-go-round she mentions she came there for her 10th birthday just after they all moved to Sunnydale. * Dawn mentions Angel to Riley. Angel does not appear this season until \\"Forever.\\" ===Arc significance=== *This episode introduces the tumor that leads to Joyce's surgery, complications of which ultimately lead to her death in \\"The Body\\". *Riley's state of mind, including his \\"obsession\\" with giving his blood to vampires, would lead to his departure from Sunnydale two episodes later in \\"Into the Woods\\". *Glory's position as this season's Big Bad is further cemented. The episode also reveals her immense age, older than written word itself, and the fact that she is in fact nameless, with \\"Glory\\" and \\"Glorificus\\", used by her minion Dreg, being two of her many titles. *This episode cements Tara's usefulness to the \\"Scooby Gang.\\" After a while with no real contribution to any of the strategems and plans (she even describes herself and Dawn as \\"non-Scoobies\\" in \\"Real Me\\"), she makes a breakthrough by suggesting the futility of researching Glory since she may pre-date the written word. ==References* \\"Shadow\\" at BuffyGuide.com Category:Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 5) episodes Category:2000 American television episodes Category:Fiction about shapeshifting Category:Television episodes written by David Fury Category:Snakes in popular culture Category:Television episodes about cancer ","title":"Shadow (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)"},{"id":"2564268","text":"Charles Lyndhurst Winslow (1 August 1888 – 15 September 1963) was a three-time Olympic tennis medalist from South Africa.

Along with right-hander Robin Roberts (a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame), Simmons was one of the twin anchors of the starting rotation of the \\"Whiz Kids\\", the Philadelphia Phillies' 1950 National League (NL) championship team. He is the youngest surviving player from the team. Simmons is also the oldest living former member of the Los Angeles Angels organization. He also played for the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs ==Biography== While attending Whitehall High School, Simmons led his high school team to three straight league titles, and also led the Coplay American Legion team to two Pennsylvania state crowns. In 1947, Phillies owner Bob Carpenter arranged for an exhibition match between his Phillies and a team of all-star high school players from the Lehigh Valley. The game was played on the opening day of Egypt Memorial Park in front of a crowd of 4,500. Simmons struck out eleven and the game ended in a 4–4 tie (a late-game error was the only thing that prevented the high school team from winning). The , lefty was signed by the Phillies, and awarded a $65,000 signing bonus (one of the highest ever awarded at that time). That spring, Simmons also pitched and played outfield in an All-American high school game between teams managed by Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb. In 1949, Simmons returned to the Lehigh Valley, pitching for the Phillies in an exhibition match (a game won by a 10–3 margin) against the Allentown Redbirds, in front of a record crowd of 4,590 at Whitehall's Breadon Field. Simmons won 17 of 25 decisions during the 1950 season, playing a role in bringing Philadelphia its second National League (NL) championship of the 20th century. With the outbreak of the Korean War, however, Simmons was called to active military service in September 1950, with only a month remaining in the campaign. The Phillies managed to hold off the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1950 season's final contest (on Dick Sisler's 10th- inning home run) to win the NL flag by two games. Simmons was stationed at Camp Atterbury and requested and was granted a leave on October 4, 1950 to attend the Series. The Phillies chose not to request that the Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler rule Simmons eligible for the Series, but Simmons chose to attend to support the team. Simmons' place on the Series roster was taken by pitcher Jocko Thompson. Without Simmons, the Phillies were swept in four games by Joe DiMaggio and the New York Yankees. Simmons also missed the entire campaign while in the military, but he returned in to win 14 games and post a stellar 2.82 earned run average (ERA). The team would never again contend for a championship during his tenure there, although Simmons continued to pitch into the late 1950s. In , he was stricken with a sore arm, and in , the Phillies – now in last place and in rebuilding mode – released him on May 17, 1960, after four mound appearances. Signed as a free agent by the St. Louis Cardinals three days later, Simmons began a comeback that culminated in 15- and 18-game-winning seasons in –1964, while in a pitching rotation that included Bob Gibson and Ray Sadecki. In 1964, he appeared in the World Series against the Yankees. He started two games for the eventual world champion Cardinals, losing his only decision but compiling a 2.51 ERA. Simmons’ last winning record was in 1964; he lost 15 games for St. Louis in , then finished his career with the Chicago Cubs and California Angels, in –. His final record, over 20 years, was 193–182 (.515). In 569 games pitched and 3,348 innings, Simmons allowed 3,313 hits and 1,063 bases on balls. He recorded 1,697 strikeouts, 163 complete games, 36 shutouts, and five saves. Along with Smoky Burgess, Simmons was the last player to formally retire who had played in MLB in the 1940s (not counting Minnie Miñoso, who would later un-retire, twice). MLB Hall of Fame hitters Hank Aaron and Stan Musial each separately named Simmons as the toughest pitcher they had to face in their careers. ==References== ==External links== *Curt Simmons at SABR (Baseball BioProject) *Curt Simmons at Baseball Almanac *Curt Simmons at Baseball Library Category:1929 births Category:Living people Category:Baseball players from Pennsylvania Category:California Angels players Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:National League All-Stars Category:People from Ambler, Pennsylvania Category:People from Lehigh County, Pennsylvania Category:Philadelphia Phillies players Category:St. Louis Cardinals players Category:Whitehall High School (Pennsylvania) alumni Category:Williamsport Grays players Category:Wilmington Blue Rocks (1940–1952) players ","title":"Curt Simmons"},{"id":"2564292","text":"Repetto is a French ballet shoe company.

She was the daughter of Chief Nenaa'angebi (Beautifying Bird) and his wife Niigi'o. Aazhawigiizhigokwe was of the Makwa-doodem (Bear Clan), and was born and lived most of her life at Rice Lake, Wisconsin. Her community became part of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians after the 1854 Treaty of La Pointe. According to Morse, Aazhawigiizhigokwe wore war paint, carried full weapons, and took part in battles, raids and hunting parties. She was a full member of the war council, performed war dances, and participated in all warrior ceremonies. Shortly after father's death in 1855, her village was ambushed by her Mdewakanton uncle, Chief Shák'pí. In this ambush, she defended her village and killed a son of Chief Shák'pí, her cousin. Armstrong recorded how she was very proud of that period of her life. Aazhawigiizhigokwe was married three times: all to non-Native Americans. Her first marriage was to Taylors Falls, Minnesota lumberman Joe Koveo. A daughter was born from this marriage, Ogimaabinesiikwe, known as Julia Quaderer, after she married John Quaderer, Jr. However, Koveo was already married and abandoned Aazhawigiizhigokwe shortly after their marriage ceremony. Her next marriage was to Rice Lake's first mayor, James Bracklin. Three children were born from this union: Nellie, Thomas, and James, Jr. Bracklin left Aazhawigiizhigokwe for a white woman, Minnie Russell. Aazhawigiizhigokwe's last marriage was to lumberman Samuel Barker, which produced two children, Mary and Edward. Barker also left Aazhawigiizhigokwe for a white woman. In her later years, Aazhawigiizhigokwe lived in the Whitefish community of the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation with son Thomas Bracklin. Aazhawigiizhigokwe was the sister of Waabikwe (the grey haired), who according to Benjamin Armstrong, became the wife of Edward Dingley in 1857, and had a son. Her husband served in the Union Army during the American Civil War but when assumed dead, she remarried. After the War, when her first husband returned to Wisconsin and heard of his wife's remarriage, they made arrangements to meet with each other and agreed to let her maintain her second marriage. She died in 1919. ==See also== *\\"Hanging Cloud (Chippewa Princess) - Ojibwa\\" by Julia White *Chippewa Indian Chiefs and Leaders ==References== * Armstrong, Benjamin.

Although for at least the last decade it contained a high proportion of Windows PC content (reflecting the state of the IT field), the magazine's title was not intended as a specific reference to this. At its inception in 1978 'personal computer' was still a generic term (the Apple II, PET 2001 and TRS-80 had been launched as personal computers in 1977.) The magazine came out before the Wintel (or IBM PC compatible) platform existed; the original IBM PC itself was introduced in 1981. Similarly, the magazine was unrelated to the Amstrad PCW. ==History== PCW was founded by the Croatian-born Angelo Zgorelec\\"About the authors\\", visit-croatia.co.uk. Article retrieved 2006-11-24. in 1978,\\"Founding Father\\", Personal Computer World (via visit-croatia.co.uk). Article retrieved 2006-11-24. and was the first microcomputer magazine in Britain. PCW’s first cover model, in February 1978, was the Nascom-1, which also partly inspired Zgorelec to launch the magazine. Its August 1978 issue featured the colour capabilities of the Apple II. PCW went monthly from the second edition. Zgorelec went into partnership with Felix Dennis who published his first issue in September 1979.David Tebbutt, technical editor then editor before selling the title to VNU in 1982.A Garrett in Goodge Street:The First 40 Years of Dennis Publishing and David Tebbutt The magazine was later owned by Incisive Media, which announced its closure on 8 June 2009. As the magazine was launched four years before the first IBM PC (reviewed in the magazine in November 1981) the magazine originally covered early self-build microcomputers. It later expanded its coverage to all kinds of microcomputers from home computers to workstations, as the industry evolved. Regular features in the earlier years of the magazine were Guy Kewney's Newsprint section, Benchtests (in-depth computer reviews), Subset, covering machine code programming, type-in program listings, Bibliofile (book reviews), the Computer Answers help column, Checkouts (brief hardware reviews) TJ's Workshop (for terminal junkies), Screenplay for game reviews and Banks' Statement, the regular column from Martin Banks.The PCW index 1978-June 1989 In 1983 Jerry Sanders joined the staff as Features Editor and wrote the first published review of Microsoft Word 1.0 for the magazine. The cover style, with a single photo or illustration dominating the page, was adopted soon after its launch and continued until the early 1990s. The cover photos were often humorous, such as showing each new computer made by Sinclair being used by chimpanzees, a tradition that started with the ZX81. Personal Computer World April 1987 issue PCW eagerly promoted new computers as they appeared, including the BBC Micro.The Register, 11 June 2009, RIP Personal Computer World The magazine also sponsored the Personal Computer World Show, an annual consumer and trade fair held in London every September from 1978 to 1989. The magazine underwent a major reader marketing push in 1992, resulting in its circulation figure rising from a middle-ranking 80,000 to more than 155,000 at a time when personal computing was becoming hugely popular thanks to Windows 3.1 and IBM PC clones flooding the market. PCW battled with rivals Computer Shopper, PC Direct, PC Magazine and PC Pro for several thousand pages of advertising each month, resulting in magazines that could run to over 700 pages. The magazine typically came with a cover-mounted CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, which held additional content. Although the magazines themselves were identical, the DVD version cost more than the CD-ROM version. During a brief period in 2001, the magazine was (effectively) sold as 'PCW' as part of a major overhaul of the magazine design and content, but this abbreviation was dropped from the cover after just a few issues. The content also reverted from having been a bit more consumer electronics focused to return to its roots. The magazine changed (both in terms of style and content) on many occasions after its launch. The last major change took place with the November 2005 issue, when the magazine was relaunched with an updated look (including glossier paper and a redesigned layout), new features, fewer advertising pages, and a slightly higher price tag. Editors of the 1990s include Guy Swarbrick, Ben Tisdall, Simon Rockman, Gordon Laing and Riyad Emeran. At the time of its closure, the editor was Kelvyn Taylor. ==Closure== The magazine was closed in June 2009, with owners Incisive Media quoting poor sales and difficult economic climate for newsstand titles. At the time of closing, it was the second most popular monthly technology title in the UK, with an audited circulation figure of 54,069 Its last issue, dated August 2009, was published on 8 June 2009.Gordon Laing, Personal Computer World magazine: 1978-2009 - An Obituary (from a former Editor's personal perspective) This final issue made no mention of its being the last one, and advertised a never to be published September issue. Subscribers were offered the option of a refund, or transferring their subscriptions to PCW's sister magazine, Computeractive. At its close PCW featured a mixture of articles, mainly related to the Windows PC, with some Linux and Macintosh-related content. The news pages included reports on various new technologies. Other parts of the magazine contained reviews of computers and software. There was also a 'Hands On' section which was more tutorial-based. Advertising still made up a proportion of its bulk, although it had diminished somewhat since its peak in the 1990s. ==References== ==External links== * Computer magazine history featuring PCW * Information on PCW-founder Angelo Zgorelec * 1978-June 1989 * Personal Computer World magazine Library at the Centre for Computing History * UK Press Gazette reports closure of title * Computer Answers help columns from 1985 to 1987 * Archived Personal Computer World magazines on the Internet Archive Category:Home computer magazines Category:Defunct computer magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Video game magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:VNU Business Media publications Category:Magazines established in 1978 Category:Magazines disestablished in 2009 Category:1978 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:2009 disestablishments in the United Kingdom Category:Monthly magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Magazines published in London ","title":"Personal Computer World"},{"id":"2564375","text":"SRAM A bicycle shifter or gear control or gear levers is a component used to control the gearing mechanisms and select the desired gear ratio.

The rest of the gang does their best to patrol and rid Sunnydale of a few more un- dead residents, emphatic that they will not bother Buffy while she is dealing with her mom's health. Meanwhile, Riley allows another female vampire to feed from him; he does not stake this one. The next day, Willow brings gifts to Joyce, Buffy, and Dawn in hopes of cheering them up. She brings Joyce a beer helmet, Dawn a book on the history of spells, and Buffy a history book and a yo-yo. With the brain tumor, Joyce has unusual outbursts, and the girls decide to let Joyce rest. On the way out, a mental patient sees Dawn and insists that there is nothing inside her. Willow and Tara camp out on the roof of a building and watch the stars. Willow points out constellations to Tara, who points out several that she has made up. They cuddle and invent new star constellations when they see a large object streaking through the sky and crashing down in Sunnydale. They investigate the crash site and decide to contact the other Scoobies. The crazy man that spoke to Dawn, who has been released from the hospital, is walking through the forest when a creature attacks him and kills him. At the hospital, the creature climbs along the ceiling, undetected. Buffy and Joyce talk the doctor into letting a highly agitated Joyce go home until her operation much to the non-recommendation of the doctor who enlightens Buffy that she will probably not get much sleep taking care of her mother. Buffy informs him that she isn't much of a sleeper anyway. The gang finds the location of the crash and a hollowed-out shell, which was apparently used as a vehicle by a creature from space. They spread out the search and find the dead body of the mental patient. The Scooby Gang leaves to do research, and Riley stays behind to investigate the scene. He calls Graham for military reinforcements, and advises the soldiers how to deal with the situation when they arrive. They decide to try to track the creature from its residues of trace radiation. At the hospital, a mental patient is attacked by the demon. Buffy's mom continues to act strangely and say things she doesn't mean to say. Dawn is hurt when Joyce calls her a \\"thing\\", but Buffy comforts her and tells her to ignore the things that people say when they are crazy. She tries to explain that when people are crazy, they think that nothing except themselves is real. Through research, the gang finds that the creature is a Queller demon, and that it is periodically summoned to rid the world of plagues of crazy people. At the Summers' home, Buffy and Dawn put their mother, whose mental clarity continues to deteriorate, to bed. Dawn listens from her bedroom as Joyce babbles loudly. At first, she appears to be talking to the ceiling; however, it is soon revealed that she is talking to the Queller demon, which is watching her from the ceiling. Dawn tries to ignore the babble, and Buffy, who is downstairs washing dishes, turns on loud music and begins to sob. In Joyce's room, the demon falls from the ceiling and spits a thick layer of slime onto Joyce's face. Dawn hears the commotion and runs to check on her mother. When she sees the demon attacking her mother, she comes to the rescue, knocking it onto the floor with a coat rack. It flees from the room, and Dawn slams all the doors and screams for Buffy. Buffy runs upstairs to check on her mother and sister. They tell her about the demon, and she chases it downstairs where she finds Spike coming out of her basement. He asks her if she heard a noise, and she notices that he has been stealing pictures of her, but the demon attacks before she has a chance to berate him. Together, they fight off the demon, and Buffy ultimately kills it with a butcher knife while wrestling with it on the floor. Spike walks over and offers his hand to help her up. He pulls her to her feet, and their hands remain connected as Riley bursts through the door with the soldiers. Spike informs Riley that he missed quite a show, making sure Riley understands that Spike had been there to help. Back at the hospital, Ben gets into his car to find that Dreg, Glory's demon minion, is waiting in the backseat. It is revealed that Ben is the one who summoned the Queller, in order to reduce the growing number of crazy people left from Glory's \\"brain sucking\\". Meanwhile Joyce, because of her brief experience as an insane person, has realized the truth about Dawn, which Buffy confirms for her. Joyce insists that Dawn is nevertheless her daughter and urges Buffy to take care of Dawn in case anything goes wrong during the operation. While her daughters and the rest of the Scooby Gang watch on, Joyce is wheeled off to surgery. ==Continuity== ===Arc significance=== *More instances of someone \\"outside reality\\" noting that Dawn is, in reality, not a \\"true person\\", including Joyce (whose semblance of sanity has been hit hard due to her brain tumor). *As a result of the above, Joyce is let in on the secret of Dawn's true nature as the Key. *Joyce goes into the surgery for the tumor.

Major was his first name, not a military title. He was born in Westminster, educated at Brighton College and died in Ashford, Middlesex. ==Career== Ritchie was a three-time medalist at the 1908 London Olympics, winning a Gold (Men's Singles), Silver (Men's Doubles) and Bronze (Men's Indoor Singles) medal. He was the last British player to win an Olympic medal in singles until Andy Murray won Gold in the 2012 games, also in London. In 1908 and 1910 he and Anthony Wilding won the doubles in Wimbledon. In 1902 Ritchie reached the all comers final at Wimbledon, beating Sydney Smith before losing to Laurence Doherty. In 1903 and 1904 Ritchie lost in the all comers final to Frank Riseley. In 1909 he reached the Wimbledon Challenge Round, beating Harry Parker, Stanley Doust, Charles P. Dixon and Herbert Roper Barrett before losing in five sets to Arthur Gore. In March 1907 Ritchie caused an upset by defeating Laurence Doherty in the Monte Carlo singles final. In June 1907 he won the Irish championships. Ritchie was a five times winner of the Championships of Germany, played in Hamburg, from 1903 to 1906 and in 1908 (in 1904 and 1906 he also won the doubles title). He was also a five-time winner of the singles title at the Austrian Championship (from 1900 to 1903 and 1905). In 1908 he was member of the British Davis Cup team. He won three consecutive titles at the Surrey Championships from 1908 to 1910. In 1911 Ritchie won the Queen's Club Covered Courts Championship, defeating Wilding in five sets. In 1920, at age 50, he reached the semifinal of the World Covered Court Championships at the Queen's Club in London. Ritchie was also active in other sports. In 1903 he competed in a regatta in Laleham and won the single sculls and coxless pairs events. In addition he competed in table tennis and was the secretary of the Table Tennis Association, founded in 1902. That year he co-authored a book on table tennis titled Table tennis and how to play it, with rules. In 1909 he authored The Text Book of Lawn Tennis. ==Grand Slam finals== ===Singles (1 runner-up)=== {class=\\"sortable \\" !style=\\"width:40px\\"Result !style=\\"width:40px\\"Year !style=\\"width:150px\\"Championship !style=\\"width:50px\\"Surface !style=\\"width:180px\\"Opponent !style=\\"width:180px\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"Score -cfc;\\"  ffa07a;\\"Loss  1909  Wimbledon  Grass  Arthur Gore  8–6, 6–1, 2–6, 2–6, 2–6 } ===Doubles (2 titles)=== {class=\\"sortable \\" !style=\\"width:40px\\"Result !style=\\"width:40px\\"Year !style=\\"width:150px\\"Championship !style=\\"width:50px\\"Surface !style=\\"width:180px\\"Partner !style=\\"width:180px\\"Opponents !style=\\"width:180px\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"Score -cfc;\\"  98fb98;\\"Win  1908  Wimbledon  Grass  Anthony Wilding  Arthur Gore Herbert Roper Barrett  6–1, 6–2, 1–6, 9–7 -cfc;\\"  98fb98;\\"Win  1910  Wimbledon  Grass  Anthony Wilding  Arthur Gore Herbert Roper Barrett  6–1, 6–1, 6–2 } ==Performance timeline== Events with a challenge round: (WC) won; (CR) lost the challenge round; (FA) all comers' finalist { class= style=font-size:86%;text-align:center - efefef;\\" ! style=\\"width:70px;\\" !! 1897 !! 1898 !! 1899 !! 1900 !! 1901 !! 1902 !! 1903 !! 1904 !! 1905 !! 1906 !! 1907 !! 1908 !! 1909 !! 1910 !! 1911 !! 1912 !! 1913 !! 1914 !! 1915 !! 1916 !! 1917 !! 1918 !! 1919 !! 1920 !! 1921 !! 1922 !! 1923 !! 1924 !! 1925 !! 1926 ! style=\\"width:40px;\\"  SR ! style=\\"width:40px;\\"  ! style=\\"width:40px;\\"  Win % - !style=\\"text-align:left;\\" colspan=31 Grand Slam tournaments !! !! !! - style=\\"text-align:left;\\" bgcolor=efefef French  colspan=18 style=color:#cccOnly for French club members  colspan=5 style=color:#cccNot held  colspan=5 style=color:#cccOnly for French club members  A  A  bgcolor=efefef 0 / 0  bgcolor=efefef 0–0  bgcolor=efefef – - style=\\"text-align:left;\\" bgcolor=efefef Wimbledon  bgcolor=afeeee 2R  bgcolor=ffebcd QF  bgcolor=afeeee 3R  bgcolor=afeeee 3R  bgcolor=afeeee 3R  bgcolor=thistle FA  bgcolor=thistle FA  bgcolor=thistle FA  bgcolor=yellow SF  bgcolor=ffebcd QF  bgcolor=yellow SF  bgcolor=yellow SF  bgcolor=thistle CR  bgcolor=afeeee 3R  bgcolor=afeeee 4R  bgcolor=afeeee 4R  A  bgcolor=afeeee 3R  colspan=4 style=color:#cccNot held  bgcolor=yellow SF  bgcolor=afeeee 3R  bgcolor=afeeee 3R  bgcolor=afeeee 3R  bgcolor=afeeee 1R  bgcolor=afeeee 3R  A  bgcolor=afeeee 1R  bgcolor=efefef 0 / 24  bgcolor=efefef 62–24  bgcolor=efefef 72.1 - style=\\"text-align:left;\\" bgcolor=efefef U.S.  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  bgcolor=efefef 0 / 0  bgcolor=efefef 0–0  bgcolor=efefef – - style=\\"text-align:left;\\" bgcolor=efefef Australian  colspan=8 style=color:#cccNot held  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  colspan=3 style=color:#cccNot held  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  bgcolor=efefef 0 / 0  bgcolor=efefef 0–0  bgcolor=efefef – - efefef;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" bgcolor=efefef Win–Loss  0–1  2–1  1–1  1–1  1–1  4–1  4–1  5–1  4–1  3–1  4–1  4–1  7–1  2–1  3–1  3–1   1–1      5–1  2–1  2–1  2–1  0–1  2–1   0–1 colspan=3 -  colspan=\\"34\\" align=\\"left\\" National representation - align=leftOlympics colspan=3 style=color:#cccNot held A colspan=3 style=color:#cccNot held A colspan=3 style=color:#cccNot held bgcolor=goldG colspan=3 style=color:#cccNot held A colspan=7 style=color:#cccNot held A colspan=3 style=color:#cccNot held A colspan=2 style=color:#cccNot held 1 / 1 5–0 100% } ==Notes== ==References* * * Olympics Profile Category:1870 births Category:1955 deaths Category:English male tennis players Category:English Olympic medallists Category:Olympic bronze medallists for Great Britain Category:Olympic gold medallists for Great Britain Category:Olympic silver medallists for Great Britain Category:Olympic tennis players of Great Britain Category:People from Westminster Category:Tennis players at the 1908 Summer Olympics Category:Wimbledon champions (pre-Open Era) Category:Olympic medalists in tennis Category:Grand Slam (tennis) champions in men's doubles Category:Medalists at the 1908 Summer Olympics Category:Sportspeople from London Category:British male tennis players Category:Tennis people from Greater London ","title":"Major Ritchie"},{"id":"2564402","text":"Blomer's rivulet (Venusia blomeri) is a species of the family Geometridae of moths, in the subfamily Larentiinae which includes the carpet moth and pugs. John Curtis's British Entomology Volume 6 Like most geometers the moth rests with its wings open and this reveals its main distinguishing feature -- a rusty-brown patch covering the apex of the upper surface of the forewing, which contrasts with the pale grey colour of the rest of the wings. When seen up close there are faint blackish cross lines too. The species has a large world range, occurring from France, Britain and Scandinavia through eastern Europe and Russia to China and Japan. ==Status in Britain== Blomer's rivulet is the only member of its genus found in Britain. It is regarded by biodiversity conservation organisations as important from a conservation perspective, both in its own right due to its nationally scarce status but also as a representative of a group of moths which are specialised feeders on elm at the larval stage. It occurs sporadically throughout Britain, mainly in broad-leaved or mixed woodland habitats, but also in hedgerows. The key habitat requirement is the presence of wych elm. Other macro-moths in the 'elm-feeding group' (i.e. moths whose caterpillars only feed on elm, as opposed to species which include elm in their diet alongside other trees) are the clouded magpie, the dusky-lemon sallow, and the lesser-spotted and white- spotted pinions – but whereas all of these species can feed on other species of elm (and some prefer other elms in fact), Blomer's rivulet appears to feed on wych elm only. The distribution of Blomer's rivulet matches that of calcareous rocks, mainly in wetter parts of the country. The species' British distribution covers two main areas – it occurs from Devon through Somerset, Wiltshire and Bristol to South Wales and the south-west Midlands, and then again from Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire through Yorkshire to County Durham. The species is also found in the Chilterns, North Wales, Lincolnshire and Cumbria. However, despite having quite a wide geographical spread, the moth is afforded a status of Nationally Scarce (found in between 16 and 100 of Britain's 10 km squares). In Britain, the moth has a single generation per year – adults are on the wing from late May through to early July. ==Etymology== The species is named after Charles Blomer, who was born in 1778 or 1779 and died in 1835, and studied insects (principally in Southwest England and South Wales) during the 1820s and 1830s. He discovered the species in Britain (at Castle Eden Dene in County Durham) during this time and it was named after him in 1832. ==Subspecies== *Venusia blomeri blomeri (most of Europe, across Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Russia to Japan, northern and eastern China, North America) *Venusia blomeri euchloe Bryk, 1949 (Korea) *Venusia blomeri szechuanensis Wehrli, 1931 (south-western China) ==References== ==External links== *Blomer's Rivulet at UKMoths *Lepiforum e.V.

She lived near the southern edge of the Plymouth Colony on Patuxet homelands, not far from Narragansett Bay, near what is currently known by settlers as Little Compton, Rhode Island. In the mid-seventeenth century, English settlers of Plymouth Colony invaded her lands. While she had allied herself to the English to increase her power, English colonization eroded her standing among both the English and the Sakonnet. Awashonks is known for her special talent for negotiation and diplomacy, which helped include the Sakonnets among Native communities who received amnesty from colonists. ==Awashonks as sachem== Awashonks became a saunkskwa not by inheritance, but through quality of leadership. She was referred to as a saunkskwa, or female chief. During her tenure, she was challenged by both rivals within the Sakonnet as well as English colonists. ==Plymouth Colony== Awashonks was not diplomatically allied with the English until July 1671, when Plymouth leaders called her and other Indian leaders to a meeting and threatened to send an army to fight them if they refused to attend. Awashonks signed the \\"Articles of Agreement\\", in which she agreed to surrender guns and Saconet who were accused of inciting trouble. The agreement was also signed by Totatomet and Somagaonet, witnessed by Tattacommett, (a Sakonnet subsachem who later removed to his land in the Elizabeth Islands) Samponcut and Tamoueesam (alias, Jeffrey), on July 24, 1671. Not long after, in August, Awashonk's men signed a paper approving what she had done in accordance with the agreement; only 3 names are known: Totatomet, Tunuokum, Sausaman. On October 20, 1671 Governor Prince wrote to her, saying that he had received the list of names, and assuring her that the English would befriend her. Awashonks made appearances in the Plymouth court system. In 1674 Mammanuah, her son, a Sakonnet rival, accused Awashonks of assault. After he had tried to sell land to English settlers, Awashonks ordered men to tie him up and threaten him. The court ruled in Mammanuah's favor, possibly to appease the English land buyers. However, the court, out of respect to Awashonks, reduced her fine to only 5 pounds rather than the 500 pounds that Mammanuah demanded. Awashonks had two husbands, Wawayeenit and Tatoson. By Tatoson, she had her son Peter Awashanks, or Petonuitt, her daughter, Betty, and Mammanuah, who became reigning sachem an died in 1698. Mamanuah had two sons John and William Mammanuah, and John also had a son named John. Peter Awashanks did not ascend to the sachemdon in part because post King Philip's War he was prohibited from returning to Little Compton and was prevented from crossing the Sippican Line in Rochester along with other younger Sakonnet men. He was eventually given land at Manomet Ponds and the family continued for at least several generations, the name being shortened to Washanks and later simply Shanks. Peter's grandchildren Penelipa, (Penelope), Deborah, Charles and Peter were given land at the Watuppa Reservation in thanks for the Saconnet's help to the English and Benjamin Church in King Philip's War. Two great grandsons named Peter and Abel Washonks were Revolutionary War soldiers in Massachusetts and Connecticut respectively. Awashonks also had two other sons by a named Wawayeenit, who may have been the sachem of Nantucket. These sons were names Amos (Samponack) and Simon (Cakawehunt.) She also had two stepsons, also local subsachems named Osohmehun and Popsitigo also known as Peter and Pope Quanawin. Their descendants would live in Dartmouth and New Bedford until the 1850s, although the name morphed into Quonwell and variants. ==King Philip's War== By 1675, the relationship between the English and the Wampanoag was more tense than ever. Metacomet (Sachem of the Wampanoag tribe, also known as King Philip) was trying to build a military coalition to go to war against the Plymouth settlers. Metacomet sent six men to visit Awashonks and convince her to side with him in the fight against the English. The men told her that if she did not, Metacomet would send his men to kill the colonists' cattle and burn their houses on her side of the river - making it appear as if one of her people had committed the crime. Awashonks sent for Benjamin Church; when he arrived, there were hundreds of people present and Awashonks was leading a ceremonial dance. Awashonks stopped to see Church, who told her that it was not true that Plymouth was preparing for war (as Metacomet's men had told her). Church advised Awashonks to go to the Governor of Plymouth and join with the English. In part because of aid from leaders such as Awashonks, the English defeated Metacomet in King Philip's War. ==Trials== In 1683 Awashonks was called before the Plymouth court, having been accused of helping to kill an infant born to her daughter, Betty. She and Betty convinced the court that the infant was stillborn, but Betty was found guilty of fornication. The court reprimanded Awashonks for having had a woman whipped for announcing that Betty was pregnant. ==Legacy== Awashonks appears in official records of New England more than any other Native woman. A boulder was erected in Wilbur Wood, Little Compton, Rhode Island in the late nineteenth century, during a period of romantic settler interest in Awashonks' story stemming from their preoccupation with the myth of the \\"Vanishing Indian.\\" The engraving reads, \\"In memory of Awashonks Queen of Sogkonate & friend of the white man.\\" ==References== ==Further reading== *http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/rhodeisland/press/press3310.html says \\"The conservation values of Treaty Rock Farm are ecological, agricultural and historical. The farm has been in this local Richmond family for over 350 years. A rocky outcrop on the farm marks the spot where Awashonks, a Sakonnet sachem, and Benjamin Church, a colonist, joined forces in King Philip's War. The farm extends from a cobble shore on the Sakonnet River across coastal shrub land, hay fields, pastures and woodland east to West Main Road. The farm has been in continuous agricultural use since the time Awashonks and Church forged their alliance at Treaty Rock.\\" Category:Year of death missing Category:Female Native American leaders Category:King Philip's War Category:People of colonial Rhode Island Category:Native American women in warfare Category:17th-century women rulers Category:Women in 17th-century warfare Category:Year of birth unknown Category:17th-century Native Americans Category:Sakonnet people Category:17th-century Native American women ","title":"Awashonks"},{"id":"2564413","text":"Socio-economic theory may refer to: * Socioeconomics * A combination of ** economic theory ** social theory ","title":"Socio-economic theory"},{"id":"2564423","text":"Hiram Houston Merritt Jr. (January 12, 1902, Wilmington, North Carolina – January 9, 1979 in Boston, Massachusetts) was one of the pre-eminent academic neurologists of his day. As the chair of the Neurological Institute of New York from 1948 to 1967, he oversaw the training of hundreds of neurologists; 35 of his former students have become chairs of academic neurology departments across the United States. He was also the dean of the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons from 1958 to 1970.\\"A revisionist history of American neurology\\" His contributions to neurology were countless. Among the most important was the discovery of the anticonvulsant properties of phenytoin (Dilantin). The technique he used, along with Tracy Putnam, to identify this compound ushered in the modern era of drug therapy for epilepsy. He also was the sole author of the first five editions of Merritt's Neurology; this popular textbook is in its twelfth edition (Rowland and Pedley, 2009). His early work on the normal properties of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was updated and published by one of his students, Robert Fishman, in a text that is the acknowledged standard on the topic. Merritt was also known in his day as an expert on neurosyphilis; his 1946 monograph on the topic provided an overview of this condition, which almost disappeared from the medical eye shortly thereafter owing to the advent of penicillin. Charles Poser, another eminent neurologist, worked under Merritt, and credited him teaching him the importance of a thorough diagnosis. ==Biography== He was a son of Hiram Houston Merritt Sr. (January 6, 1870 - May 9, 1945) and Dessie Ella Cline (September 23, 1872 - January 7, 1946), who were married on January 24, 1898 in Morehead Township, Guilford County, North Carolina. In 1968 he was sent by the Department of Health to Portugal to assist local doctors after Salazar suffered a brain haemorrhage. Merritt died in 1979 from complications of cerebrovascular disease and normal pressure hydrocephalus; ironically, the latter condition was a syndrome whose existence he had never fully accepted during his career. His students who were treating him in New York disagreed over the proper course of action. Eventually, he was taken to the Massachusetts General Hospital, where he succumbed to the after-effects of a neurosurgical operation. ==References== ==External links== * Columbia P&S; Medical Review article by Rowland and Stefanis *Dr. Merritt's official biography (Neurological Institute of New York) *Neurological Institute of New York Category:1902 births Category:1979 deaths Category:Vanderbilt University alumni Category:Johns Hopkins University alumni Category:Harvard University faculty Category:Columbia University faculty Category:American neuroscientists Category:American neurologists Category:People with hydrocephalus Category:20th-century American physicians ","title":"H.

Spike leads Buffy to see that Riley goes to a vampiric brothel, where humans pay vampires to suck their blood. When she confronts Riley about it, he decides to take the military up on an offer to join a demon-hunting unit, and leaves Buffy and Sunnydale. ==Plot synopsis== At the hospital, the Scooby Gang awaits news from the doctor about Joyce's surgery, and they are all relieved when the surgery is a success. Dawn spends the night with Xander and Anya so that Buffy and Riley can have some private time. With the house to themselves, Buffy and Riley spend a romantic evening together. In the middle of the night, Riley sneaks out of the house. Spike, having been on his nightly vigil, secretly follows Riley to an old building. Buffy spends the day with her mother in the hospital discussing Joyce's wig options and Buffy's relationship with Riley. Spike wakes Buffy from sleep that night to show her what Riley has been doing. Buffy is shocked to find him in the arms of a female vampire, being fed upon. Graham has persuaded his commanding officer to seek Riley's help in destroying demons for the military. They offer Riley a position in the military's new anti-demon organization, assuring him that their group is nothing like the Initiative and they exist only to destroy demons, not study them. Buffy and the gang go after the nest of vampires only to find the building empty. Buffy sets the building on fire, leaving her friends in the dark about what's truly bothering her. Riley is furious that Spike allowed Buffy to see the truth and after throwing the vampire around a bit, he stakes him. The stake is plastic and Riley's actions were only a warning. Spike maintains that Riley has no future with Buffy, and the two rivals eventually share a drink, discussing how they both love her, but she doesn't seem to return the feeling for either of them. Spike tells Riley that he is generally jealous of his position of intimacy with Buffy, although sometimes he wonders if Riley's situation is worse, being so close to Buffy while not actually having her. However, he ultimately declares that Riley has the better deal. Riley asks Spike if he really thinks he has a shot with Buffy. Spike responds in the negative, but says that a fellow's got to try - he's got to do what he can. Buffy releases her aggressions on a punching bag in the training room until Riley shows up determined to talk to her. He tells her he started his late-night vamp activities because he wanted to know what Buffy felt when she was bitten by Dracula. Riley tells her that the vampires needed him and Buffy didn't. After Buffy tells him that she's given him everything she has, Riley says he doesn't believe her and tells her about the offer to return to the military, and that he is going to leave unless she can convince him not to. The vampires from the nest surround a distraught Buffy as she's leaving the shop. She stakes all eight of them in record time, including the vampire who had been seen drinking from Riley. Xander witnesses the slaying and confronts Buffy, telling her he thinks that Riley has given her everything, and risked everything for her, and accuses her of treating Riley as a rebound guy and of expecting him to be 'convenient' after Angel's departure from Sunnydale. She points out that Xander himself treats Anya as a mere convenience, but Xander pursues his point, telling her that her relationship with Riley is the kind that comes around once in a lifetime, and that she has to decide if she's really willing to lose him for good. Buffy takes off, but although she runs as fast as she can, is unable to get to the helipad in time to stop Riley from leaving. The helicopter flies away with Buffy on the landing pad, calling after Riley. He stares in the other direction, the helicopter's loud noise drowning out Buffy's cries, leaving without knowing that Buffy had tried to reach him. After his talk with Buffy, Xander realizes that he needs to tell Anya how much he loves her and he does. Still shocked, Buffy returns home while Riley leaves Sunnydale, not looking back. ==Production details== This was the first Buffy episode directed by executive producer Marti Noxon. Of the experience, she says \\"It was thrilling and it was terrifying. I thought I was going to bolt the whole time.\\" ===Writing=== When asked why they chose to have Riley leave Sunnydale, Joss Whedon says he tried to give Buffy a healthy relationship, but \\"people didn't want it. They did some great work together. But at the same time, when they were happy, it made people crazy.\\" Marti Noxon adds, \\"Sunnydale romance just rarely goes well. Buffy with a boyfriend is not as interesting as Buffy in some kind of romantic strife. Riley, by his nature, was such a good and constant character that we were at risk of things getting a little dull.\\" ===Dedication=== This episode is dedicated to D.C. Gustafson, a member of the series' art department, who died on November 4, 2000. He was a close friend of Sarah Michelle Gellar.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0348976/ ==Continuity== ===Arc significance=== * This episode marks both the end of Buffy and Riley's relationship and Riley's last appearance as a series regular. He reappears in the Season Six episode \\"As You Were\\" and again in the Season Eight comic \\"Time of Your Life\\" as a minion of Twilight. * Last appearance of Graham Miller (Bailey Chase). * Xander and Anya's relationship is cemented as something more than just a high school romance. * This episode depicts a vampire variation of a crack house, in which humans allow vampires to partially feed upon them in exchange for the \\"high\\" the experience provides humans; Sunnydale's seamier side would receive more attention in the form of magic drug dealer Rack and his operations in Season Six. An even more extreme version is seen in Los Angeles in \\"Release\\", where humans get \\"high\\" on drugs and then allow vampires to partially feed upon them, heightening the effect for both humans and vampires. * The banner Giles hangs above the counter of the Magic Box reads: \\"Don't Forget Winter Solstice, Hanukkah, Christmas, Kwanzaa & Gurnenthar's Ascendance Are Coming!\\" * Every man that has loved Buffy and has known about her slayer heritage has asked Buffy to hit them, the first was Angel in season 2 after he turned in \\"Innocence\\", the second was Spike when Buffy wanted information about the two slayers he killed previously in the season 5 episode \\"Fool for Love\\" and the third was in this episode when Riley tells Buffy the vampires needed him. It has been said to Buffy before but only in Spike's dream in \\"Out of My Mind\\" and \\"Family\\", though in \\"Family\\" Spike is only imagining fighting Buffy whilst having sex with Harmony and words gets mixed up by Harmony saying \\"I'm coming right now\\" and Buffy in the dream saying \\"I'm coming right now.\\" ==References* \\"Into the Woods\\" at BuffyGuide.com Category:Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 5) episodes Category:2000 American television episodes ","title":"Into the Woods (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)"},{"id":"2564428","text":"John Henry de la Poer Beresford, 5th Marquess of Waterford (21 May 184423 October 1895), styled Earl of Tyrone from 1859 to 1866, was an Irish peer and Conservative politician.

She was married to Sir John Bankes, Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and Attorney-General of King Charles I. == Marriage and children == Mary Hawtry was born in about 1598, the only daughter of Ralph Hawtry, Esquire of Ruislip, Middlesex, and Mary Altham. In about 1618, she married Sir John Bankes, who later became Attorney-General to King Charles I and Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. In 1635, Sir John purchased Corfe Castle in Dorset with all its manors, rights, and privileges from Lady Elizabeth Coke. Sir John died on 28 December 1644 at the age of 55. Together Sir John and Mary had four sons and six daughters: * Sir Ralph Bankes (1631–1677), married Mary Bruen, by whom he had two children. * Jerome Bankes * Charles Bankes * William Bankes * Alice Bankes, married Sir John Borlase, 1st Baronet, by whom she had issue * Jane Bankes, married George Cullen * Mary Bankes, married Sir Robert Jenkinson, by whom she had issue. * Joanna Bankes, married William Borlase of Great Marlow, Buckinghamshire, younger brother of her sister Alice's husband, by whom she had issue. * Elizabeth Bankes * Arabella Bankes, married Samuel Gilly == Siege == Corfe Castle, which Lady Bankes defended against attacking Parliamentarians In 1643, when civil war broke out in England, she assumed control of Corfe Castle when John Bankes had been ordered by the king to serve in combat in London and Oxford. She remained behind with her children, servants, and a force of five men. By that point, Corfe Castle was the last Royalist garrison on the Dorsetshire coast. In May 1643, a force of Parliamentarians, consisting of forty seamen, demanded the surrender of the castle's four pieces of ordnance. She, her maidservants, and her small group of soldiers retaliated with cannon fire and drove them away. Later, she gave up the ordnance in order to have some time to resupply the castle. On 28 June, 500-600 parliamentary troops began their first siege of Corfe. Mary and her small group defended the Upper Ward and by heaving stones and hot embers from the battlements, managed to repel the assailants, killing and wounding over 100 men in August. John Burke, A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Commoners of Great Britain and Ireland, Volume 3 (London, 1837) pp.308-309. In 1646, one of her officers, Colonel Pitman, betrayed her by leading a party of Parliamentarians into the castle via a sally gate. The Parliamentarians under the command of a Colonel Bingham reversed their jackets and were mistaken for Royalists. As a result, she was forced to surrender the castle. However, because she showed such courage she was allowed to keep the keys of the castle, which are now held at Kingston Lacy near Wimborne Minster, Dorset. The castle was slighted the same year it was captured by the orders of the House of Commons. It is recorded that her sons Ralph and Jerome bought the manor of Eastcourt on her behalf. Upon her death, the manor passed to her daughter Joanna Borlase, who in her turn passed it on to her daughters and co- heirs.A History of the County of Berkshire: Volume 4 (London, 1924) pp.200-205. == Death == Mary died on 11 April 1661 and was buried in St Martin's Church, Ruislip.

It generally refers to protocols higher than the physical layer. In contrast to transport protocols at the transport level (like TCP or UDP), the term \\"wire protocol\\" is used to describe a common way to represent information at the application level. It refers only to a common application layer protocol and not to a common object semantic of the applications. Such a representation at application level needs a common infoset (e.g. XML) and a data binding (using e.g. a common encoding scheme like XSD). The wire protocol may be either text-based or a binary protocol. Although an important architectural decision, this is a separate matter from the distinction between wire protocols and programmatic APIs. In electronics, a wire protocol is the mechanism used to transmit data from one point to another. ==Functionality== A wire protocol provides the means for interoperation of one or more applications in a network. They often refer to distributed object protocols, or they use applications that were designed to work together. As the name suggests, these distributed object protocols run in different processes in one or several computers that are connected over a network. ==Types== Wire protocols provide the means for a program running under one operating system to communicate with a program running under some other operating system using the Internet - they interconnect multiple platforms. Some are language- independent, allowing the communication of programs written in different languages. Examples of wire protocols include: * IIOP for CORBA * RTPS for DDS * Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) for Java debugging * JRMP for RMI * SOAP for Web services * AMQP for message-oriented middleware ==See also== *Communications protocol *Line code *Network protocol ==References== Category:Application layer protocols ","title":"Wire protocol"},{"id":"2564465","text":"André Henri Gobert (30 September 1890 – 6 December 1951) was a tennis player from France.

It is often simply called Grand Lake. It is administered by the Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA). ==History== The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture credits Henry Holderman, a citizen of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma as first envisioning Grand River as a source for hydroelectric power for the Cherokee Nation. Even prior to Oklahoma statehood in 1907, Holderman began building political support for such a project. A feasibility study by the Army Corps of Engineers attracted favorable attention in the Oklahoma legislature, leading to creation of the Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA), a state agency, in 1935. Construction began in 1938 on the Pensacola Dam on the Grand River (lower Neosho River) as a Works Progress Administration project. The dam was completed in March 1940, creating the lake behind it. Between 1941 and 1946, the U.S. government took control of Pensacola Dam to divert power to the war effort. Control was returned to the GRDA by the Congress and President Truman amid local celebration in August 1946.\\"Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture: Grand River Dam Authority.\\" Accessed October 10, 2019. ==Pensacola Dam== Aerial View of Pensacola Dam and Grand Lake Pensacola Dam is claimed to be the longest multiple arch dam in the world, its main span consisting of 51 arches totaling in length, and supporting a walkway and State Highway 28, a narrow two-lane highway. A 120 megawatt, 6-unit powerhouse sits at the west end, with 21 spillways on the east end. \\"Eyes on Texas & Oklahoma: Grand Lake o' the Cherokees\\" Website The project's chief engineer was W. R. Holway (who was also responsible for Tulsa's Spavinaw water project), while the architect of record for the PWA-style Art Deco design of the dam and powerhouse was Tulsan John Duncan Forsyth.Pensacola Dam at Oklahoma National Register Properties, Oklahoma Historical Society, State Historic Preservation Office website.Jim Gabbert, \\"5 Buildings by John Duncan Forsyth\\", Preservation Oklahoma News, July 2006, p.5.Donald C.

Another mile east, through the town of Disney, lie two small sister dams known as \\"the spillways\\" with an additional 21 gates, surrounded by public parks and launching ramp. 510,000 cubic yards (390,000 m³) of concrete were used in the construction of Pensacola Dam, poured 24 hours a day in just 20 months with depression-era labor. The lake, and the electric utilities, as well as other projects in the region, along the Grand River are administered by the Grand River Dam Authority, an agency created by the Oklahoma legislature in 1935. Grand Lake has a surface area of of water, a storage volume of 1,515,416 acre- feet,http://www.owrb.ok.gov/studies/reports/reports_pdf/GrandLake-- hydrologicsurvey.pdf and of shoreline. Unlike other lakes in Oklahoma, Grand Lake is a deep and mostly rocky lake. The average depth for Grand Lake is 36.3 feet.http://www.owrb.ok.gov/studies/reports/reports_pdf/GrandLake-- hydrologicsurvey.pdf Its mean elevation is above sea level. In recent years, low fall elevations of 741 were kept by the GRDA to allow millet seeding for migratory waterfowl, resulting in conflict between property owners, environmentalists, and federal agencies. While not expressly built for flood control, Grand Lake contributes to the flood-prone Arkansas River watershed. The Army Corps of Engineers controls releases into the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System when lake levels exceed , although locking into Grand Lake is not possible. Grand Lake and its neighbor, Lake Hudson (also managed by the GRDA), are the only two major lakes in the state where one can build directly on the waterfront. Residents of the town of Miami and Native American groups have objected to proposals to increase high water levels at Pensacola Dam in order to maintain the water level at Grand Lake. Miami residents are concerned that when water backs up downstream from Miami on the Neosho River, this can contribute to Miami's flooding problems. ==Recreation== The lake is a popular destination for entertainment in the Green Country region. There are a number of shows in the area, as well as resorts, and a sixty-seven-foot long, twin deck paddle wheel riverboat called the Cherokee Queen, which has been in operation since the 1940s. Consistently ranked among the top bass fishing lakes in the United States, Grand also houses a wide variety of other sport and non-sport fishing. Due to its predictable winds, it attracts sailboaters from across the country as well. ==In literature== *In the book The Bean Trees by Barbara Kingsolver, Taylor, Turtle, Estevan, and Esperanza visit the lake. ==See also== *Lakes in Oklahoma ==References== ==Further reading== * Voices of Oklahoma interview with Dr. Bruce Howard about the creation of Grand Lake O’ the Cherokees and Pensacola Dam.

Giles visits England, leaving Anya in charge of the Magic Box. Willow accidentally unleashes a troll who used to be Anya's boyfriend. Eventually, Anya and Willow manage to send him to the land of trolls, but not before he wreaks havoc at the Bronze. Throughout the episode, Anya and Willow fight over Xander. == Plot synopsis == Xander and Anya lie in bed together and talk about Buffy's bad luck with men. They wonder if Buffy might be the problem. At a convent, Buffy protects a young nun from a vampire then asks questions about the life of a nun. Buffy trains while talking to Giles about his plans to ask the Watchers' Council for help with Glory. While Giles prepares for a trip to England, he leaves the shop in the hands of Anya and Willow, whose constant bickering worries Giles and places Xander and Tara in uncomfortable positions. Dawn notices that Buffy has removed all the pictures of Riley from her room. Buffy and Dawn talk about how Buffy is recuperating after Riley's departure. Dawn tries to be supportive, and Buffy appreciates her efforts and discusses her emotions openly with her sister. Dawn expresses sadness that Riley left so suddenly, and Buffy admits that everyone except Buffy had seen it come on gradually. Dawn seems surprised, and Buffy mentions her hope that Riley might return one day for another try, so that Buffy would be able to say all the things that she hadn't been able to say before. Box of chocolates in hand, Spike uses his Buffy mannequin to rehearse a conversation he plans to have with Buffy. He wants to explain his motivations for showing her Riley's extracurricular vampire activities, but his temper gets in the way. He begins to argue with the mannequin and ends by beating the mannequin with the box of chocolates and shouting, only to set it back up and start over. Back at the Magic Shop, Anya protests Willow's use of the shop products for magic spells, calling it stealing. Willow tries to tempt Anya by offering to show her some magic tricks, but Anya decides that Willow is using peer pressure and refuses to participate. Willow and Anya's argument escalates, and since Xander and Tara don't want to be in the middle of the arguments, they both leave. Willow starts a spell, but Anya interrupts with questions and the two begin arguing again. Accidentally, the spell calls forth a giant troll. The store and much of Sunnydale is seriously damaged as the troll puts his large war hammer and great strength to good use. On the university campus, Buffy and Tara talk about their new semester classes and then about the events at the magic shop. Buffy overreacts when Tara mentions possible trouble between Anya and Xander because of Willow and Anya's constant fighting. Buffy cries and buries her head in Tara's shoulder, declaring that Anya and Xander have a \\"miraculous love\\". Anya drives a car for the first time wildly through the streets while Willow, in the passenger seat, searches for a spell to stop the troll, who proceeds to wreak havoc in Sunnydale, bashing trash cans, swinging his hammer, and declaring to the people running in the opposite direction: \\"You do well to flee, townspeople. I will pillage your lands and dwellings. I will burn your crops, and make merry sport with your more attractive daughters, mark my words\\" before smelling \\"ale\\" and heading toward the Bronze. Xander mopes at the Bronze and runs into Spike. As Xander seethes hostility at his presence, Spike fishes for information on Buffy, to no avail. The two eventually begin to play pool and talk about women trouble. Back at the Magic Shop, Buffy and Tara fear the worst as they view the destruction left by the troll, and take off to try to track it. The troll arrives at the Bronze, declaring his desire to drink ale and eat babies. Xander suggests that Spike fight the troll, but Spike is \\"paralyzed by not caring very much.\\" The troll asks Spike and Xander where to find babies to eat. Spike suggests the troll try the hospital, and Xander ineffectually attempts to talk sense into the troll, suggesting that he sit down in one of the more sturdy chairs to have a calm talk. However, the troll is unsatisfied with their suggestions of stags, strong grog, and onion blossoms. While the troll drinks beer straight from a keg, the whole gang gathers at the Bronze. When Buffy arrives, Spike cautiously greets her, but she ignores him and he steps back, disappointed. The troll, Olaf, reveals that he used to date Anya and (after his unfaithful dalliance with a wench) she turned him into a troll, earning her the job of a Vengeance demon. Buffy attacks Olaf and Spike jumps in a moment later to back her up (triumphantly copping a feel in the process). Buffy and Spike are unsuccessful, and Olaf uses his hammer to knock down the second floor of the Bronze and injure many innocent people. As Buffy takes stock of the damage, she notices Spike comforting a bleeding victim. In an accusatory manner Buffy asks Spike what he is doing. He protests that he is only helping, and that would not dream of sampling any blood (\\"not a taste for Spike, not a lick\\"), because he knows she wouldn't like it, but she refuses to give him credit for his intentions (\\"You want credit for not feeding on bleeding disaster victims?\\"), declaring him to be disgusting. Spike is disappointed and says \\"What's it take?\\" after Buffy leaves. Buffy sends Willow and Anya back to the Magic Shop to find a spell that would actually be effective against Olaf. At the shop, Willow and Anya finally address the root of their issues: their fear of each other's potential to hurt Xander and pull him away from the other. Anya makes it clear that she has no intention of hurting Xander in any way, and Willow assures Anya that she has no intention of poisoning his mind against Anya, or luring him away with her lips: \\"Hello, gay now!\\" Olaf storms into the shop and intends to hurt the girls, but Xander arrives before two of the most important women in his life are seriously wounded. The troll beats Xander up badly (although acknowledging that he \\"fights well\\" despite being \\"a tiny man\\") then tells Xander to choose whether Anya or Willow will die. Xander refuses to choose, proving his loyalty to both girls. Buffy arrives and fights with the troll while Willow works on a spell and Anya distracts Olaf with insults. When Olaf says that Anya and Xander won't last, Buffy gets incredibly angry and beats the troll into unconsciousness. The troll is sent off into an alternate universe (probably the land of trolls, but possibly the world without shrimp). Giles talks to Buffy about the damage to the shop. Joyce joins them and they discuss the non-existent information about Glory and the Key that Giles received from the Council. Dawn overhears part of this discussion and is very concerned. ==Cultural references== Unlike most episodes, in which everything magical is fictional, during the fight which takes place in The Magic Box, in the background is a rack filled entirely with copies of the real-world Neo-Pagan magazine Green Egg, published by the Church of All Worlds. ==Trivia== The actor who plays Olaf, Abraham Benrubi, has appeared in a number of TV shows, two of which involved ex-Buffy cast members: Robot Chicken created by and starring Seth Green, and Bones starring David Boreanaz. ==Continuity== ===Arc significance=== * This is the first appearance of Olaf the troll, who later appears (in human form) in a flashback in the Season 7 episode \\"Selfless\\". * Olaf's hammer will prove to be a crucial weapon against Glory in the season finale. * During Willow and Anya's argument while looking for a reversal spell, they both allude to future plot paths involving Anya returning to demon form, and Willow turning evil. In both instances it involves Xander, as Anya turns evil again because of Xander, and Willow returns from being evil due to Xander. * Willow foreshadows Amy becoming evil, mentioning that she thinks she made Amy smart and that she's \\"planning something.\\" * Olaf accurately predicts that Xander and Anya will not last as a couple which will happen in the next season in \\"Hell's Bells\\". * This is the first time Spike mentions his love of blooming onions.

Prepaid plans serve the needs of distinct consumer segments such as the youth market, families, customers with variable income who otherwise would not be able to obtain service due to their credit profile, and customers who prefer to pay in cash. Prepaid customers also include parents who wish to control costs for their children. In November 2006, an American embassy cable released via WikiLeaks listed Telcel among \\"Mexico's monopolists\\", with a market share of 80% of cellular service.

Miller 2009 p.28. State versus Gentry in Late Ming Dynasty China, 1572-1644 The Wanli Emperor deeply respected Zhang as a mentor and valued minister. During the first ten years of the Wanli era, the Ming dynasty's economy and military power prospered in a way not seen since the Yongle Emperor and the Rule of Ren and Xuan from 1402 to 1435. However, after Zhang's death, the Wanli Emperor felt free to act independently, and reversed many of Zhang's administrative improvements. ==Life and career== Zhang Juzheng was born in Jiangling County, in modern-day Jingzhou, Hubei province, in 1525, and was renowned for his intelligence at an early age, passing the county shengyuan examinations at the age of 12 and enrolling for the provincial juren examinations the next year, where the chief examiner failed him to prevent his becoming complacent. Finally, in 1547, he passed the imperial examination and was appointed as an editor in the Hanlin Academy. Zhang was embroiled in deep political turmoil from the start of his career, owing to the factionalism prevalent in the Ming bureaucracy at the time. He was one of few officials who had cordial relations with both Yan Song and Xu Jie, the leaders of the respective factions, but eventually assisted Xu in overthrowing Yan Song. Subsequently, under Xu's patronage, Zhang became a Privy Secretary in 1567, outlasting Xu himself and sharing power with his political rival Gao Gong. In 1572, shortly after the accession of the Wanli Emperor, Gao was ejected from office by Zhang and his ally, the eunuch Feng Bao, on charges that he had questioned the ability of the child emperor to rule. This left Zhang as the sole Grand Secretary, in effect controlling the entire Ming bureaucracy during the first ten years of the Wanli era. ===As Chief Grand Secretary=== Zhang's reforms consisted primarily of fiscal measures in order to address the persistent revenue shortages that plagued the government. At the same time, laws were instituted from 1573 onwards to tighten monitoring and assessment of officials, in an attempt to restore discipline to an increasingly corrupt bureaucracy. Other major measures included the large-scale retrenchment of officials to achieve savings, as well as efforts to reclaim tax-exempt lands and expand the revenue base. In 1580 the single whip law was instituted, commuting all taxes and labour obligations into silver payments, while an empire-wide land survey was also ordered. In military affairs, Zhang promoted and supported competent generals such as Qi Jiguang in order to strengthen the empire's northern borders. Zhang also played a very important role as mentor and regent during the early years of the reign of the Wanli Emperor. He strongly influenced and guided the emperor through his teenage years. However, the strict upbringing he imposed on the emperor also aroused resentment, while his attempts to centralise government and improve its finances affected the interests of large sections of the bureaucracy, leading to frequent controversy. One example of this was the death of Zhang's father in 1577; normally this would have obliged Zhang to enter filial mourning and leave his post, but Zhang applied to remain in office, and was retained by the emperor. In the subsequent dispute over the propriety of Zhang's actions, several opposing officials were subjected to punishment by caning, which only increased the impression of Zhang's domineering nature. Zhang's fiscal policies met with only mixed success, due to the institutional resistance to his reforms. While the fiscal situation of the imperial government was much improved, and the coffers were refilled with silver, most of the reforms he instituted either failed to achieve their aims, such as the empire-wide land survey, or were quickly discarded after his death in 1582. At the same time, his luxurious lifestyle - which included meals with over a hundred dishes, and a palanquin carried by 32 men - exposed him to charges of hypocrisy even as he imposed austerity measures on the rest of the bureaucracy. After his death, Zhang's political opponents quickly accused him and Feng Bao of several major charges, including corruption, embezzlement, and factionalism. As a result, his family was purged and his wealth and estate confiscated on the Wanli Emperor's orders, while several of his political allies were forced to retire. Zhang's reputation would only be rehabilitated more than half a century later, just before the downfall of the Ming dynasty. ==Zhang's commentary on the \\"Four Books\\"== In 1573, Zhang presented the Wanli Emperor with a commentary on the Four Books of the Confucian canon, entitled \\"Colloquial Commentary on the Four Books\\" (\\"四书直解\\", Sì Shū Zhíjie). It was published some time between 1573 and 1584. The book was not destroyed during the posthumous disgrace of Zhang, and even enjoyed a measure of renown among the Chinese literati almost a century later, during the early decades of the Qing dynasty, when several editions of it appeared between 1651 and 1683. In the assessment of modern scholars (e.g. D.E. Mungello), Zhang's commentary was, in its content and meaning, not that different from the commentary written by Neo-Confucianist Zhu Xi. The Jesuits rejected the Neo-Confucianism but found Zhang's book more consonant with their view of Confucius' teaching. As a result, there are numerous references to Zhang's work in Confucius Sinarum philosophus, the pioneering Latin translation and commentary of the Confucian classics, which had been gradually created by a large group of Jesuits over several decades and published in Paris in 1687.Mungello, p. 270 ==Literature== Zhang Juzheng (Chang Chü-cheng) is an important character in Ray Huang's 1587, a Year of No Significance, a documentary book on the period. ==See also== Zhang Juzheng's former residence in Jingzhou, Hubei * Grand Secretary ==External links== * Encyclopædia Britannica ==References== Category:1525 births Category:1582 deaths Category:Ming dynasty politicians Category:People from Jingzhou Category:Grand Secretaries of the Ming dynasty ","title":"Zhang Juzheng"},{"id":"2564528","text":"The TO-92 is a widely used style of semiconductor package mainly used for transistors. The case is often made of epoxy or plastic, and offers compact size at a very low cost. ==History and origin== The JEDEC TO-92 descriptor is derived from the original full name for the package: Transistor Outline Package, Case Style 92. The package is also known by the designations SOT54 and JEITA SC-43A. By 1966 the package was being used by Motorola for their 2N3904 devices among others. Motorola 1966 Semiconductor Handbookhttps://archive.org/stream/bitsavers_motoroladaSemiconductorHandbook2edAug66_80459525/1966_Motorola_Semiconductor_Handbook_2ed_Aug66_djvu.txt ==Construction and orientation== The case is molded around the transistor elements in two parts; the face is flat, usually bearing a machine-printed part number (some early examples had the part number printed on the top surface instead). The back is semi-circularly-shaped. A line of moulding flash from the injection-moulding process can be seen around the case. The leads protrude from the bottom of the case. When looking at the face of the transistor, the leads are commonly configured from left-to-right as the emitter, base, and collector for 2N series (JEDEC) transistors, however, other configurations are possible, such as emitter, collector, and base commonly used for 2S series (Japanese) transistors or collector, base, and emitter for many of the BC series (Pro Electron) types. If the face has a part name made up of only one letter and a few numbers, it can be either a Japanese or a Pro Electron part number. Thus, \\"C1234\\" would likely be a 2SC1234 device, but \\"C547\\" is usually short for \\"BC547\\". The leads coming out of the case are spaced 0.05\\" (1.27 mm) apart. It is often convenient to bend them outward to a 0.10\\" (2.54 mm) spacing to make more room for wiring. Units with their leads pre-bent may be ordered to fit specific board layouts, depending on the application. Otherwise, the leads may be bent manually; however, care must be taken as they can break easily, as with any other device that is manually configured. The physical dimensions of the TO-92 housing may vary sightly depending of the manufacturer, however, the 1.27mm lead spacing must be respected. ==Advantages== * Transistors of this type can be made very inexpensively and take up very little board space. Most models are readily available in large quantities from wholesale distributors. * They are easy to find in small electronics stores because of their wide usefulness, making them a popular choice for hobby work and prototyping. ==Disadvantages== The main disadvantage of this style of case is the lack of heat sinking. * Transistors and ICs of these types cannot handle as much power as higher-power equivalents, such as the TO-220 and can burn out quickly if they dissipate excessive power. * There is no standard pinout for the TO-92. The American BJTs use the E-B-C pinout while their Japanese counterparts use the E-C-B pinout and some RF devices use the B-E-C pinout. ==Voltage and current== Although TO-92 devices are mainly used in low-voltage / low-current (<30 V; <1 A) applications, high-voltage (600 Volt Vce) and high-current (5 A Ic) devices are available. Nominal maximum power dissipation is less than one watt (600 mW). ==Common transistors using a TO-92 case== *BC548, NPN *BC558, PNP *2N3904, General purpose NPN *2N3906, General purpose PNP *2N7000, N-Channel FET *BS170, N-Channel FET, similar to 2N7000 *PN2222A, a \\"Plastic\\" version of the original TO-18 cased 2N2222 NPN *2N2907, PNP *2N4401, NPN *2N4403, PNP *2SC945, NPN *MPSH10, NPN RF ==Additional uses of the TO-92 case== *MK484, AM radio IC *78Lxx series voltage regulators *TCR1AM, Triac *DS2501-UNW/DS2502, Add-only memory *DS18B20, Temperature sensor, digital output (1-Wire) *LM335, Temperature sensor, analog output (+ 10-mV/°K) *OH090U, Hall effect sensorhttp://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/OH090U/365-1001-ND/374779 ==See also== * TO-3 * TO-18 * TO-220 * Chip carrier ==References== ==External links== * TO-92 Package, EESemi.com * Essay about TO92 housings (German) by Dipl.-Ing.

Literally, it means \\"the creation of something which creates\\". In the context of biotechnology, metagenics is the practice of engineering organisms to create a specific enzyme, protein, or other biochemicals from simpler starting materials. The genetic engineering of E. coli with the specific task of producing human insulin from starting amino acids is an example. E. coli has also been engineered to digest plant biomass and use it to produce hydrocarbons in order to synthesize biofuels. The applications of metagenics on E. coli also include higher alcohols, fatty-acid based chemicals and terpenes. == Biofuels == The depletion of petroleum sources and increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the twenty and twenty-first centuries has been the driving factor behind the development of biofuels from microorganisms. E. coli is currently regarded as the best option for biofuel production because of the amount of knowledge available about its genome. The process converts biomass into fuels, and has proven successful on an industrial scale, with the United States having produced 6.4 billion gallons of bioethanol in 2007. Bioethenol is currently the front-runner for alternative fuel production and uses S.cerevisiae and Zymomonas mobilis to create ethanol through fermentation. However, maximum productivity is limited due to the fact that these organisms cannot use pentose sugars, leading to consideration of E.coli and Clostridia. E.coli is capable of producing ethanol under anaerobic conditions through metabolizing glucose into two moles of formate, two moles of acetate, and one mole of ethanol. While bioethanol has proved to be a successful alternative fuel source on an industrial scale, it also has its shortcomings, namely, its low energy density, high vapor pressure, and hygroscopicity. Current alternatives to bioethanol include biobutanol, biodiesel, propanol, and synthetic hydrocarbons. The most common form of biodiesels is fatty acid methyl esters and current synthesis strategies involve transesterification of triacylglycerols from plant oils. However, plant oils have a major limitation in availability of oil-seed supplies at competitive prices, leading to an interest in direct synthesis of fatty acid methyl esters in bacteria. This process bypasses transesterification, leading to higher energy yields and lower production cost. One of the principal obstacles in production of viable biofuels is that the maximum blend ratio of biofuel to petroleum is between 10% and 20%, Current biofuels are not compatible with high-performance, low- emission engines and costly changes in infrastructure and engine remodeling would be required. A University of Exeter study sought to overcome this obstacle through production of biofuels that can replace current fossil fuels through sustainable means, namely, the production of n-alkanes, iso-alkanes, and n-alkenes, as these are the hydrocarbons that compose current retail transport fuels. The study found suitable substrates for production of the aforementioned hydrocarbons by means of the P. luminescens fatty acid reductase (FAR) complex. A study published in Biotechnology for Biofuels used S. cerevisiae to produce short- and branched-chain alkyl esters biodiesel through metabolic engineering. Negative regulators for the INO1 gene, Rpd3 and Opi1 were deleted to boost S. cerevisiae's ability to produce fatty acid esters. To increase the production of alcohol precursors, five isobutanol pathway enzymes were overexpressed. == Insulin Production == Increase in the demand for recombinant insulin can be explained by an increase in the number of diabetic patients globally, as well as alternative delivery methods such as inhalation and oral routes, which require higher doses. Through the use of recombinant DNA technology, E. coli can be used for the production of human insulin. The biosynthesis of insulin within the human body confers a significant advantage over bovine or porcine synthesis, which are often immunogenic in diabetic patients. To accomplish this, synthetic genes for human insulin are fused with the β-galactosidase gene of E.coli, where they undergo transcription and ultimately translation into proteins. The limiting factor for the use of microorganisms like E. coli in biosynthesis of gene products like insulin is time, yet due to advancements in the synthesis of oligonucleotides and liquid chromatography, the production time needed for DNA fragments has greatly decreased. Recombinant human insulin was first approved for clinical trials in 1980. At this time the A and B chains of insulin were produced separately and then chemically joined. Joining of the two chains was often carried out through air oxidation with low efficiency. A 1978 study by Goedell et al. successfully accomplished correct joining of the A and B chains through S-sulfonated derivatives and an excess of the A chain, resulting in 50-80% correct joining. Recent advances have allowed the chains to be synthesized together by inserting the human proinsulin gene into E. coli cells, which produce proinsulin through fermentation. == Further reading == * Chemically synthesized genes for human insulin * Synthesis of customized petroleum-replica fuel molecules by targeted modification of free fatty acid pools in Escherichia coli * Metabolic engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for production of fatty acid short- and branched-chain alkyl esters biodiesel * Ginkgo Bioworks featured work ==References== Category:Biotechnology Category:Genetic engineering ","title":"Metagenics"},{"id":"2564547","text":"Lochranza castle Lochranza castle Lochranza Castle is an L-plan fortified tower house situated on a promontory in Lochranza, on the northern part of the Isle of Arran in Scotland.

Officially, its summit reaches above sea level, though it is generally considered to be closer to , using GPS measurements.Neyra Jáuregui, p. 5. It is the highest peak in Tlaxcala, the fifth-highest in Puebla, the sixth-highest in Mexico, the 23rd-highest in North America, and the 252nd- highest in the world. Its height above nearby cities varies from above Huamantla, above Villa Vicente Guerrero, above Tlaxcala, to above Puebla. The summit is from Tlaxcala, from Puebla, and from Mexico City. The climate is cold near the summit and mild on the lower slopes. The Tlaxcaltecs named the peak Matlalcueitl, which translates to \\"[Lady of the] Blue Skirt\\", a goddess of rain and song, believed to be the local equivalent of Chalchiuhtlicue. The Spanish named it simply Sierra de Tlaxcala (\\"Tlaxcalan Range\\").Acuña, p. 73. The current name, Malinche or Malintzin, became popular during the 17th century, and honors the woman who helped Hernán Cortés as an interpreter during the conquest of the Aztec Empire. == Location == Located within the Parque Nacional La Malinche at the border of Tlaxcala and Puebla states, this volcano is part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. The park is the fifth largest of the 85 peaks in México. It covers an area of , of which roughly two thirds belong to Tlaxcala and one third to Puebla. The diameter of the park is approximately . == Formation == La Malinche and its side peaks La Malinche is an active stratovolcano which began to form in the middle of the Paleogene period, 30–35 million years ago. Since that time it has grown through eruptions, the last of which is believed to have occurred ca. 3,100 years ago. It is not a typical volcanic cone, but instead has a number of side peaks like Tlachichihuatzi or La Chichita (), Xaltonalli () and Chicomecanoa (); as well as two of the most dramatically steep slopes in Mexico: Barranca Axaltzintle to the northeast (which is believed to be the former crater) and Barranca Axal to the south-southeast.Neyra Jáuregui, p. 220. La Malinche is mostly isolated from the surrounding ranges; some nearby mountains and hills are El Pinal (), El Tintero (), Cuatlapanga (), Huintitépetl () and Xalapasco (). View from nearby Xalapasco hill. La Malinche on the far right, with side peaks El Filete, Xaltonalli and Oclayo next to it; on the other end, El Tintero and El Pinal. On lower slopes are farmlands which grow mostly field \\"dent\\" corn and forests which transition from alders and various types of oak to Montezuma pines and sacred firs with increasing elevation. The upper slopes are zacatonal. The summit is covered by snow part of the year and is considered to be the coldest location in Tlaxcala. On the lower slopes the climate is mild year round, but rainy during the summer months. The soils consist of crushed volcanic rock and sand with an underlying layer of clay and sand called tepetate at an average depth of about a meter. The dark and porous forest soils were formed from volcanic ash. From La Malinche streams flow in all directions forming small gorges in places which fill and run rapidly when torrential rains occur. At the base of the mountain emerge many springs, some of drinkable water, and others of thermal water heated in the volcano's interior. == Legends == Cuatlapanga, with La Malinche in the back La Malinche shares, like Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl, legends about its formation. According to the most famous legend, Matlalcueye was a virgin girl engaged to Cuatlapanga, a warrior who had to go to battle in a remote place. Time went by, and the lover took so long to come back that the girl died of sorrow. When the warrior came back, badly hurt on the head, he received the bad news. He went to cry at her grave and also died, turning into a small mountain. Matlalcueye turned into the huge volcano, with the smaller Cuatlapanga at her side. Another legend about the mountain concerns a reptilian monster that supposedly lived in the mountain and that would come down during the rainy season to abduct children and take them up the mountain to be devoured. Eventually the beast was killed, according to legend, and its head was mounted above the entrance to a house in Puebla that still stands at 201 East Third Street in the historical district of that town.Bowles == Recreation == The park offers a resort area at —\\"Centro Vacacional Malintzin\\"—with cabins and camping. It is an ideal location to acclimatize and start an ascent of the volcano. There are sporting facilities, a restaurant and a gift shop. Outside the resort, there is also a convenience store and a little \\"antojitos\\" restaurant, as well as horses and llamas for riding on the weekends. The access road passes the resort area and continues partway up the mountain, switchbacking most of the way. A hiking trail to the summit begins at the resort area, cutting across the road switchbacks for the first section. The trail then leads into a conifer section at around . The tree line, from where the \\"false\\" summit is visible for the first time, is at . After that, a very steep grassland section begins. The ridge starts at and leads to the summit, which is just behind the false summit. The last 100-or-so metres involve a bit of scrambling. It is often cold and very windy above the tree line, so proper clothing is recommended. Crampons and an ice axe are absolutely necessary whenever it has snowed recently – which typically happens a few times each year from December to March. Other than that, the ascent is challenging but not technical. Fit hikers can reach the summit from the resort area in 3–4 hours, but it is best to plan for 5–6 hours with breaks. It is best to start in the early morning and return well before sunset. The alpine police will warn hikers against ascending above the tree line after 2 p.m. There are other more demanding routes starting from the surrounding towns of Huamantla, Ixtenco, San Juan Tepulco and San Miguel Canoa.Neyra Jáuregui, p. 216-219. On September 14, 1968, a group of mountain climbers mainly consisting of employees of the Autonomous University of Puebla was infamously lynched in San Miguel Canoa, after they planned on staying in town overnight because of the adverse weather. The conservative town priest had encouraged the town population to the killing, mistaking the climbers for Communist students. The massacre was later adapted to film by director Felipe Cazals. ==See also== *List of mountain peaks of North America *List of mountain peaks of Mexico *List of volcanoes in Mexico *List of Ultras of Mexico ==References== ==Sources== * Acuña, René (1984).

She recalls that her two previous experiences with the Council put her life in mortal peril, and wishes that they would just give her the information she needs without making the trip to Sunnydale. (Buffy has met Quentin Travers only once before, in Helpless, but met other Council members in Who Are You.) Glory is at her place, panting and in obvious pain. Dreg and another demon rush into the room, bringing a hysterical mailman. They carry her to the crying man and help her put her fingers to his temples to drain away his sanity. She gets up, refreshed, and the disoriented mailman wanders away. The other demon warns her that she has even less time now to use the key, but Glory isn't worried. She explains that, if Buffy is the only obstacle between her and the key, she won't need much time at all. Quentin Travers and a large team of Watchers arrive at the Magic Box. They disrupt business, sending paying customers home, and criticize Giles's selection of merchandise. They announce that the Magic Box will be closed for the duration of the Council's stay in Sunnydale. Giles is frustrated and takes an antagonistic position, and then learns that the Council plans on conducting an extensive review of Buffy (her methods, skills, and abilities). Quentin announces that they have information on Glory, but won't reveal it until Buffy's skills have been comprehensively tested and she proves she can handle the information. In Buffy's history class, the teacher is discussing how Rasputin was considered nearly impossible to kill. Buffy challenges the professor to look at history from another angle, but unfortunately, he turns out to be a bully who shoots her ideas down with scathing criticism and sarcasm, embarrassing her in front of the class. That night, Buffy complains about class to a vampire she's fighting until she is thrown off balance. Spike suddenly appears, flying over a tombstone to tackle and stake the vampire. He expects gratitude, but Buffy accuses him of getting in her way. The two then verbally attack each other. Jinx confronts Ben at the hospital and relays a message from Glory, who wants Ben's assistance in gathering useful information about the Slayer. Ben responds by beating up the demon. Quentin informs Buffy and Giles that she must pass the review or he will shut down the shop and deport Giles. Buffy and Giles realize that they must cooperate with the Council, which is powerful enough to carry out all its threats. Buffy worries that she may fail, placing everyone in even greater danger. Council members interview the rest of the Scooby Gang, including Spike, for information about the Slayer. Lydia interviews Spike, and she reveals she wrote her thesis on him. With the exception of Spike (who declares her to be \\"slipping\\" because she \\"can't keep a man\\"), they all try not to incriminate Buffy in any way, and each tries to justify his usefulness to her (without making it sound like Buffy actually needs help). In the training room, Buffy is blindfolded and her fighting skills are tested against one of the council members. She breaks a rib of her opponent and Quentin abandons that test. Upon returning home, Buffy finds Glory in her living room. During this confrontation, Glory openly threatens to kill all of Buffy's friends and family and force Buffy to watch her do so. Visibly disturbed by this, Buffy takes Dawn and Joyce to Spike for protection. Although Spike initially protests the sudden increase of \\"manly responsibilities\\", he agrees to look after them; after a moment's awkwardness, Joyce and Spike discover their shared addiction to a common soap opera and sit down to watch it together. On her way to the shop to meet with the council for a comprehensive review of her plans and strategies, three well-armed men wearing medieval fighting gear attack Buffy. Buffy takes them out and discovers from the last conscious one that they are the Knights of Byzantium and are in town to destroy the Key. They consider her their enemy because she protects the Key. Buffy returns to the shop and informs Travers that she is not going to deal with the review anymore. She now knows that she holds power against both Glory and the Council because they both need something from her; Glory needs to know where the Key is, and the Council needs her to make their jobs meaningful. She delivers an authoritative speech justifying the participation of each of her friends, and demands that Giles be reinstated as her Watcher (receiving retroactive pay from the month of his dismissal). She finally instructs the Council to give her the information that she needs. Quentin reluctantly agrees to her terms. He then informs Buffy that Glory isn't a demon; she's a god. == Reception == Noel Murray of The A.V. Club wrote that Checkpoint was a \\"highly entertaining episode\\" with \\"narrative and thematic significance,\\" adding, \\"The real fight that Buffy has been staging for five years now may not be between good and evil, but between hidebound traditionalism and ingenious innovation, and between elitism and democratization... What better symbol for the degraded state of The Old Ways than a mad god in stylish clothes, sucking the brains of postmen and walking right into the Summers house and staring straight at Dawn — the object she seeks — while remaining completely ignorant.\\" Reviewer Mikelangelo Marinaro wrote for the Critically Touched Reviews website that this \\"wonderfully pleasant episode\\" is \\"Buffy's first serious take on the subject of power, which of course is a major theme of S7.\\" Marinaro discusses how \\"Checkpoint stays focused on Buffy and how she takes another fine step into adulthood while discovering more about her power as a Slayer which, of course, is a big theme of the season.\\" The reviewer gave the episode grades of 90/100 and A-. A. M. Dellamonica, writing a recap for the Tor Books website, concludes, \\"Though [this is] not a primarily comic episode, the Scooby interviews are chucklesome. And even though, in dramatic terms, this confrontation has superficial similarities to the one between the Scoobies and the Maclays in Family, I can't help but love that sense of a bill coming due. The Watchers have been needing comeuppance. That they get it direct from the sacrificial teen they've been happy to think of as 'their instrument' only makes it sweeter.\\" ==References* \\"Checkpoint\\" at BuffyGuide.com Category:Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 5) episodes Category:2001 American television episodes Category:Television episodes written by Jane Espenson ","title":"Checkpoint (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)"},{"id":"2564592","text":"Jerome Bert Wiesner (May 30, 1915 – October 21, 1994) was a professor of electrical engineering, chosen by President John F. Kennedy as chairman of his Science Advisory Committee (PSAC). Educated at the University of Michigan, he was associate director of the university's radio broadcasting service and provided electronic and acoustical assistance to the National Music Camp at Interlochen, Michigan. During World War II, he worked on microwave radar development at the MIT Radiation Laboratory. He worked briefly after the war at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, then returned to MIT's Research Laboratory of Electronics from 1946 to 1961. After serving as Kennedy's science advisor, he returned to MIT, becoming its president from 1971 to 1980. He died at his home of heart failure. He was an outspoken critic of manned exploration of outer space, believing instead in automated space probes. He challenged NASA's choice of developing the Apollo Lunar Module as a means to achieving Kennedy's goal of landing men on the Moon. At Kennedy's direction, he investigated Rachel Carson's criticism of the use of the pesticide DDT, and issued a report in support of her claims. He was an advocate for arms control, and a critic of anti-ballistic-missile defense systems. While MIT president, he was put on President Richard M. Nixon's extended \\"enemies list\\". == Early life and education == Wiesner was born in a Jewish family in Detroit, Michigan and raised in Dearborn. He attended Fordson High School. He received a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in electrical engineering and mathematics in 1937, and a Master of Science (MS) degree in 1938, at the University of Michigan. He received a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in electrical engineering from UM in 1950. Interested in radio broadcasting and acoustics, he was associate director of UM's radio broadcasting service. He also participated in studies of acoustics, and assisted in developing electronic techniques, at the National Music Camp at Interlochen, Michigan. In 1940, Wiesner married Laya Wainger, a fellow mathematics major he met at UM. The same year, he was appointed chief engineer for the Acoustical and Record Laboratory of the Library of Congress, in which capacity he traveled the American South and Southwest under a Carnegie Corporation grant, with folklorist Alan Lomax, recording the folk music of these regions.http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1994/weisner-obit-1026.html President emeritus Jerome Wiesner is dead at 79 October 26, 1994 In this role, he became friends with folk singer Pete Seeger, who performed at the concert for Wiesner's inauguration as President of M.I.T. in 1971. == Career == Wiesner began his professional career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, joining the MIT Radiation Laboratory in 1942 and working on microwave radar development. He became an associate member of the laboratory's steering committee, and led Project Cadillac, which developed the forerunner of the AWAC system. At the end of World War II, he worked briefly at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, then returned to MIT as a professor of electrical engineering, and worked from 1946 to 1961 at the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT (RLE), ultimately becoming the director. ===Kennedy administration=== President John F. Kennedy named Wiesner to chair the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) in February, 1961. ====Space program==== Before Kennedy took office, Wiesner chaired a task force which issued a report to the President-elect on January 10, 1961, warning of \\"inadequate planning and direction . . . the lack of outstanding scientists and engineers\\" in its space efforts, and expressing his opposition to manned space flight,House Science and Astronautics Committee, Defense Space interests, 87th Cong., 1st sess. (1961), p. 19. saying that Project Mercury exaggerated \\"value of that aspect of space activity where we are less likely to achieve success. ... We should stop advertising Mercury as our major objective in space activities.\\"Levine, Future of the US Space Program, p. 71. Emphasis in original.Levine, Anold S. (1982). Managing NASA in the Apollo Era, chapter 27, \\"The Lunar Landing Decision and Its Aftermath\\". NASA SP-4102. The Wiesner Report, as it was called in 1961, outlined to Kennedy Wiesner's strict advice to not continue with the manned space program, Project Mercury. The President's Science Advisory Committee highlighted the skepticism of the scientific elite about sending humans into space. Wiesner was not concerned with the political aspects that others in Kennedy's administration were. Wiesner believed that the space program would continue making scientific advancements even without man. Also, he highlighted the disaster that would come out of a failure to place a man into orbit causing the death of an astronaut, saying it \\"would create a situation of serious national embarrassment\\". These two points were among the many reasons Wiesner did not want to send man into space. When NASA decided in June 1962 on Lunar Orbit Rendezvous as the strategy for its Apollo program to meet Kennedy's goal of landing men on the Moon by the end of the 1960s, Wiesner had created a Space Vehicle Panel, chaired by Nicolas Golovin, to monitor and second-guess NASA.Golovin had been NASA Associate Administrator Robert Seamans' special technical assistant, who left NASA after chairing an ad-hoc committee for Seamans in July 1961 to recommend an Apollo launch vehicle. Contrary to Wiesner's expectation, this NASA committee had helped open the door to serious consideration of LOR. Hansen, James R. (1999). Enchanted Rendezvous: John C. Houbolt and the Genesis of the Lunar-Orbit Rendezvous Concept. The SVP forced NASA to defend its decision to develop the Saturn V launch vehicle and a Lunar Excursion Module, delaying its announcement news conference to July 11, and causing NASA Administrator James E. Webb to hedge by calling the decision tentative, keeping the Earth-orbit rendezvous and direct-ascent methods as possible backups, but still maintaining, \\"We find that by adding one vehicle to those already under development, namely, the lunar excursion vehicle, we have an excellent opportunity to accomplish this mission with a shorter time span, with a saving of money, and with equal safety to any other modes.\\"Brooks, Grimwood, and Swenson (1979). Chariots For Apollo, chapter 3.7, \\"Casting the Die\\". NASA SP-4205. But Golovin and Wiesner kept up the pressure, Wiesner at one point making the disagreement public during a two-day September visit by the President to Marshall Space Flight Center. Wiesner blurted out \\"No, that's no good,\\" in front of the press, during a presentation by Marshall Director Wernher von Braun. Webb jumped in and defended von Braun, until Kennedy ended the squabble by stating that the matter was \\"still subject to final review.\\" Webb held firm, as NASA issued a request for proposal to candidate LEM contractors. Wiesner finally relented, unwilling to settle the dispute once and for all in Kennedy's office, because of the President's involvement with the October Cuban Missile Crisis, and fear of Kennedy's support for Webb. NASA announced the selection of Grumman as the LEM contractor in November 1962.Brooks, Grimwood, and Swenson (1979). Chariots For Apollo, chapter 4.4, \\"Pressures by PSAC\\". NASA SP-4205. ====Pesticide usage==== In the wake of controversy surrounding the 1962 publication of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, which questioned the indiscriminate use of the pesticide DDT, Kennedy directed the PSAC to conduct an investigation into Carson's claims. Wiesner held hearings, and on May 15, 1963, published a report titled \\"The Use of Pesticides\\", which recommended a phaseout of \\"persistent toxic pesticides.\\" ====Nuclear arms limitation==== Wiesner's MIT news obituary described him as \\"a key figure in the Kennedy administration in the establishment of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, in achieving the October 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and in the successful effort to restrict the deployment of antiballistic missile systems.” ===Return to MIT=== Shortly before his assassination in November 1963, Kennedy decided to replace Wiesner as PSAC chair with Donald Hornig of Princeton University. As Kennedy's successor, Lyndon B. Johnson honored the appointment in 1964.Donald Hornig, Last to See First A-Bomb, Dies at 92, The New York Times, January 26, 2013 After leaving the White House, Wiesner returned to MIT as Dean of the School of Science, to become Provost in 1966, and President from 1971 to 1980. He was also elected a life member of the MIT Corporation. During the Watergate scandal, it was disclosed in June 1973 that Charles W. Colson, counsel to President Nixon, had prepared a short list of 20 people deemed \\"hostile to the administration\\" on September 9, 1971. What became popularly known as \\"Nixon's enemies list\\" was discovered to have been expanded to include Wiesner, among twenty other academics. According to an issue of Science journal reprinted in the Boston Globe and Washington Post, a White House memo discussed a Nixon order to \\"cut back on MIT's subsidy in view of Wiesner's anti-defense bias\\". ==Portrayal== Wiesner was portrayed by Al Franken in the 1998 HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon. ==Awards and honors== He was awarded the Delmer S. Fahrney Award in 1980. In 1993 Wiesner was awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. ==Personal life== Wiesner died at his home in Watertown, Massachusetts of heart failure at age 79. His son, Stephen Wiesner, is a research physicist. ==Bibliography (selection)== ===Articles=== * ==Notes== # Obituary, MIT News Office # \\"Lists of White House 'Enemies' and Memorandums Relating to Those Named\\", The New York Times, June 28, 1973, p. 38\\\\. # \\"Enemies list\\", The Tech (MIT's student newspaper), September 7, 1973, p. 4\\\\. #A Random Walk through the Twentieth Century, online hyper-biography of Wiesner from 1995 ==References== Category:1915 births Category:1994 deaths Category:American electrical engineers Category:Fordson High School alumni Category:Human spaceflight opponents Category:Jewish American scientists Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology provosts Category:Recipients of awards from the United States National Academy of Sciences Category:Office of Science and Technology Policy officials Category:Presidents of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Category:University of Michigan College of Engineering alumni Category:MIT Media Lab people Category:20th-century American engineers ","title":"Jerome Wiesner"},{"id":"2564594","text":"The Banochaemae, Baenochaemae, Bainochaimai or Bonochamae were a Germanic tribe recorded only in the Geography of Claudius Ptolemy. The name is generally considered to be equivalent to the modern term \\"Bohemian\\" in its origins, although this does not mean that this people is ancestral to the modern Bohemians, nor speaking an ancestral language, nor living in Bohemia. Rather the name represents a combination of the more ancient tribal name of the Boii, and the Germanic word found in modern German heim, or English \\"home\\". (The Boii's name is also found in \\"Bavaria\\", and they had lived in a large regions encompassing both of the modern regions, plus parts of modern Moravia, Hungary, Lower Austria and northern Italy. The Italian city of Bologne, Latin Bononia is named after them.) During Roman imperial times a part of the general area of the modern Czech republic had been settled by Suebian Germanic tribes, most notably the Marcomanni under King Marobodus. Around 100 AD Tacitus reported that in the area once inhabited by the Boii, north of the Danube, south of the Main river, east of the old territory of the Helvetii, and west of the Hercynian forest: \\"The name Boiemum still survives, marking the old tradition of the place, though the population has been changed.\\"Tac. Ger. 28 Strabo wrote that in the south of Germany, among the hills or mountains north of the Danube (which are not yet as big as the Alps further south)... > ...is the Hercynian Forest, and also the tribes of the Suevi, some of which > dwell inside the forest, as, for instance, the tribes of the Coldui, in > whose territory is Boihaemum, the domain of Marabodus, the place whither he > caused to migrate, not only several other peoples, but in particular the > Marcomanni, his fellow-tribesmen; for after his return from Rome this man, > who before had been only a private citizen, was placed in charge of the > affairs of state, for, as a youth he had been at Rome and had enjoyed the > favor of Augustus, and on his return he took the rulership and acquired, in > addition to the peoples aforementioned, the Lugii (a large tribe), the Zumi, > the Butones, the Mugilones, the Sibini, and also the Semnones, a large tribe > of the Suevi themselves.Strab. 7.1 According to Ptolemy's account, a tribe using this name lived near the Elbe river, east of the Melibokus mountains, which were probably not the modern Melibokus, but the Harz mountains, or Thüringerwald or both. This is, he reports, in turn north of the Askiburgium mountains (probably the modern Sudetes) and the Lugi Buri, which are in turn north of the source of the Vistula river. This position may be north of both modern Bohemia and modern Bavaria. Ptolemy also mentions a large people named the Baimoi (or Baemi) whose name is often considered to be simply a different Greek transliteration of the same word. However the Baimoi are found to the south, on the north side of the Danube before it turns south in Hungary, living near the Quadi and the Luna forest. ==References== ==See also== * List of Germanic peoples Category:Early Germanic peoples ","title":"Banochaemae"},{"id":"2564597","text":"Stephen Pusey (born 1952) is a New York-based artist of Irish and British descent known for Abstract art and earlier work as a painter of figurative community murals in London, UK. ==Early life and education== Stephen Pusey was born on 24 June 1952. thumbright Stephen Pusey, Earlham Street Mural Covent Garden, London UK Date: 1977 Size: 44 foot x 22 foot (13.5 meter x 7 meter) ==Career== After graduating from Saint Martins School of Art, Pusey created monumental public murals around London, including the Covent Garden, Earlham Street mural, 1977 and the Brixton Academy mural, 1982.

It tells the heart-warming story about a grandmother and her city-born grandson who comes to live with her in a rural village. The film, which reminds the younger generation of the unconditional love and care that old people selflessly give, won South Korea's equivalent of the Oscars for best picture and screenplay. It was the second-highest grossing homegrown film in South Korea in 2002. It was released on DVD, with English subtitles, in 2003 by Paramount. The film is in the List of highest-grossing films in South Korea, with 4,091,000 number of admissions nationwide. ==Plot== The story begins on a fine summer's morning, when San-woo (Yoo Seung-ho) and his mother board a bus to the country. It is soon clear that the unsophisticated rural passengers annoy the seven-year-old urban boy. His mother is taking him to live with his 78-year-old mute, but not deaf, grandmother (Kim Eul-boon) while she looks for a new job after a business venture failed in Seoul. Eventually they reach their destination, a dusty bus stop in the Korean countryside near an unsophisticated village. By now Sang-woo, who has arrived with junk food and toys, has no intention of respecting his mute grandmother especially as her house has neither electricity nor running water. His mother apologises for leaving the boy, telling her own mother it will not be for too long before leaving on the next bus. Alone Sang-woo ignores his grandmother, not even wanting to look at her even calling her a byungshin, or \\"retard\\". Next morning, his grandmother starts another day. She goes down the hill to get clean water and washes her clothes at the river. She also tends the melons that she will sell at the market. One of the Grandmother's neighbours is a hard-working country boy who attempts to become friends with Sang-woo, who declines until the end when he apologizes for making fun of him. The other is a young girl who Sang-Woo falls in love with, but she is more interested in the country boy. The grandmother, who also cares for her old friends very much, lives a simple and humble life. Eventually, from constant play, Sang- woo's Game Boy runs-out of batteries so he asks his grandmother for money for new ones. But she is poor and has none. Selfishly he teases her, and in an intolerant manner throws away her shoes, breaks one of her vases and draws graffiti on her house walls. When this fails to get money from his grandmother, Sang-woo steals her ornamental hairpin to trade for batteries. He then goes off to find the shops. When he finally finds the right place he attempts to trade the silver hairpin but instead of getting batteries the shop keeper, who happens to be his grandmother's friend, hits him on the head and sends him home. One day Sang-woo demands Kentucky Fried Chicken. But as the grandmother only understands \\"chicken\\", she takes some of her melons and trudges off to the market to buy a chicken. Bringing back a live one in the rain, she prepares a home-made boiled chicken instead of fried chicken. When Sang-woo wakes up he sees the boiled chicken he gets angry, throwing the food away. Later in the night he finishes the food because he is hungry. The next morning, his grandmother becomes ill and Sang-woo serves her the remaining chicken while caring for her. Despite the hardships faced by the old grandmother who has osteoporosis, the only thing she needs Sang-woo for is to run thread through her needles. She stitches the shoes and shares her earnings with a friend who ends their meeting with the touching words \\"Come by again before one of us dies.\\" Sang-woo who remains angry and confused by the unfamiliar environment repeatedly rejects her attempts to please him. But her unconditional love slowly touches his heart. One day, Sang-woo gets up early and goes with his grandmother to the market where he sees how hard his grandmother persuades passers-by to buy her vegetables. After a long day at the market she takes Sang-woo to a shop and buys him noodles and new shoes. When they are about to board the bus home, Sang-woo asks his grandma to buy him a Choco Pie. The grandmother goes to a shop that is run by an elderly friend. The shopkeeper, who now has a bad knee, gives her five or six pies but refuses to take any money, so the grandmother gives the shopkeeper a melon. But when the grandmother returns to the bus with the sweets, Sang-Woo says he wants to ride alone as the girl he likes is also on board. The grandmother tries to get Sang-Woo to take the rest of the produce with him but he refuses. The bus then leaves. Sang-Woo then has to wait for his grandmother to return wondering why it is taking her so long. He then realises that his grandmother has walked back from town carrying all her produce. Eventually Sang-woo begins to love his grandmother, but because she is unable to read or write he makes some simple greeting cards, so she has some letters from him. Finally Sang- woo's mother returns and he goes back to Seoul. His depth of feeling for his grandmother is revealed when the bus leaves and he leaps to the back window to wave his tearful farewells. The film closes with the grandmother continuing to live alone in the thatched-roof house but with the letters of love from her grandson. Before the end a credit notes the film is dedicated to all grandmothers around the world. ==Cast== ===Principal=== *Kim Eul-boon as Grandmother *Yoo Seung-ho as Sang-woo ===Supporting=== *Dong Hyo-hee as Sang- woo's mother *Min Kyung-hyun as Cheol-yi, country boy, neighbor of the grandmother *Im Eun-kyung as Hae-yeon ==Production== The film was filmed in and around Jeetongma, North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. ==Reception== The film received generally positive reviews from both Western and Korean critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 75% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 56 reviews. Steven Rea from the Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4 saying that \\"Jeong- Hyang Lee's film is deceptively simple, deeply satisfying.\\" Many critics praised the style of the movie as well as the acting of the inexperienced Kim Eul-boon who at 78, had not only never acted before, but never even seen a film. The film went on to win the Best Film and Best screenplay awards at the Grand Bell Awards, the Oscar's equivalent in South Korea. It was also nominated for Best Asian Film at the 22nd Hong Kong Film Awards, but lost to My Sassy Girl, another South Korean film. == References Category:2002 films Category:2002 drama films Category:Films set in the 21st century Category:CJ Entertainment films Category:Paramount Vantage films Category:South Korean films Category:Best Picture Grand Bell Award winners Category:South Korean drama films ","title":"The Way Home (2002 film)"},{"id":"2564611","text":"Highway 118, north of Dartmouth at the village of Waverley.

Giles reveals that Glory is the god of a demon dimension and in order to stay in human form, she needs to suck energy from humans, leaving them insane. The gang starts asking questions about the Key, and Buffy and Giles finally decide to tell them the truth about Dawn. Three Knights of Byzantium chant around a fire before they are interrupted by Jinx. Glory arrives and kills two of the knights, saving one whom she later tortures for information. At the magic shop, Dawn feels awkward because of the way everyone is treating her and notices when Giles hides a book in a hidden counter drawer. Buffy opens presents from her friends and everyone gets quiet when she receives a framed picture of herself and Dawn (from a vacation which is, like most of Dawn's life, a false memory) from her sister. Dawn finally gets upset and confronts everyone about their strange behavior around her, then storms to her room. After sneaking out of the house, Dawn runs into Spike, who was keeping his nightly watch outside Buffy's house. After a brief conversation, Dawn tells Spike that she is on her way to the Magic Box to steal a book. Spike notes the myriad dangers of roaming around alone at night, and then he accepts Dawn's offer to let him tag along. With Spike's assistance, Dawn breaks into the shop and finds the book that she had seen Giles hide earlier. By candlelight, Dawn and Spike read about the truth of Dawn and the Key. Oddly, Spike treats this revelation with total equanimity; Dawn's reaction, of course, is far more vivid. Dawn returns to the house in a state of shock, bleeding from a self-inflicted knife wound, tearfully questioning what she is. Joyce and Buffy try to talk to her, but Dawn, scared and experiencing an existential crisis, demands that they leave her alone. Buffy confronts Spike for letting Dawn find out the truth the way she did. He turns the tables on her and says that she should have told Dawn the truth in the first place. He also notes that Dawn was going with or without him, and that he only went along to protect her from harm, thinking that she would be safer with \\"Big Bad\\" looking over her shoulder. Buffy reflects on what he says. Jinx threatens Ben at the hospital, but Ben reveals that Glory can't hurt him, no matter what he does. After overhearing Buffy and Joyce talking, Dawn rampages through her room, burns her diaries and runs away. The smoke alarm alerts Buffy and her mom to Dawn's little fire and departure. The whole gang gathers at the shop then split up to search for Dawn. Xander is a little bit excited that a form of energy like Dawn could have a crush on him. Spike does what he can to comfort Buffy and tells her that they will find her sister before it's too late, and Buffy admits that Spike had been right about Dawn; Buffy should have been honest with her in the first place. Dawn passes through the park, reliving past memories only to be reminded of their falseness, then ends up at the hospital. She searches for answers in the Psych ward, trying to persuade the mental patients to tell them what they see when they look at her, then runs into Ben. She confesses to Ben that she's the Key and he freaks out trying to make her leave before Glory can find her, but it's too late. Ben suddenly changes into Glory, but Glory remembers nothing about Ben's conversation with Dawn and the young girl pretends to know nothing. Dawn asks questions about the Key and Glory reveals that the Key is very old then concludes Dawn knows nothing and is wasting her time. Dawn doesn't seem to remember exactly how Glory got into the room. Buffy shows up to stop Glory from draining the energy from Dawn. With some help from the rest of the gang, Buffy gets in a few good hits and takes a few as well before Willow and Tara perform a spell to teleport Glory somewhere else.

Buffy and Xander investigate the train murders, and Buffy confesses the possibility of Spike loving her, though Xander doesn't take it seriously and is even amused by this. A blindfolded doll in the overhead compartment of the train, hidden from Buffy and Xander, is revealed to the audience. The doll resembles those in Drusilla's doll collection, first seen in \\"School Hard\\". While Buffy and Spike are staking out in front of a warehouse, Buffy is unnerved by some of Spike's behavior, because he normally does not help for free and has never really taken an interest in her personal likes and dislikes. Buffy and Spike attack the vampires, but they immediately run off at the sight of the Slayer. Buffy realizes that the warehouse is a vampire nest, and thus they couldn't have been the ones involved in the train massacre. When Spike goes so far as to unwittingly hold the door open for her, Buffy finally demands to know why he is acting like this, demanding to know if everything that just happened was just Spike's version of a date. At first, Spike loudly and amusedly denies it, but then asks, in a hopeful manner, \\"Do you want it to be?\\" Buffy is disgusted by the fact that Spike was trying to hit on her. Despite Spike's pleas and confessions, Buffy refuses to listen to him and denies that there is something between them, insisting that Spike is still a dangerous villain and, being soulless, is incapable of such emotion. Having completely and brutally rejected Spike, Buffy departs the warehouse in horror and disgust. Despondently returning to his crypt, Spike is greeted by his longtime love, Drusilla. Drusilla tells him of the events in Los Angeles and tries to convince him to return with her. She's already aware of the chip in his head and tries to convince him he can be evil, even with the chip. Harmony arrives and yells at Drusilla for hurting Spike. Spike throws Harmony out of the way, announcing that not only is Drusilla back - he's back. While out looking for Spike, Buffy discovers the extension of his underground lair, which includes a shrine dedicated to herself. As she returns to the surface, Buffy finds Spike and Drusilla waiting for her. Spike watches Drusilla shock Buffy with a cattle prod. After the Slayer collapses, Drusilla turns to Spike, only to be shocked herself as he seizes the cattle prod and uses it on her. Buffy awakens to find herself chained up in the underground space below Spike's crypt, Drusilla is tied to a pole across from her. Spike poetically describes his 120-year romance with Drusilla—prompting an appreciative sigh from her—but also professes his love for Buffy and offers to kill Drusilla to convince Buffy of his love. He threatens that if Buffy does not return his love, he'll untie Drusilla and let her kill Buffy. Spike asks Buffy for only a small sign that she could love him. Buffy rejects Spike again, and he goes into a rage about women being so difficult. Harmony arrives and shoots Spike with a crossbow bolt. While Harmony and Spike fight, Drusilla breaks free and goes after Buffy while the Slayer is still chained up. Spike grabs Drusilla, and unchains Buffy. Realizing that the Spike she once loved is gone forever, Drusilla leaves Sunnydale heartbroken. Harmony leaves Spike, telling him it's completely over between the two of them. The minute she leaves, Buffy physically attacks Spike and storms off. Spike follows her and desperately attempts to get her to talk to him, but Buffy makes it very clear that he is no longer a part of her life, and he is to stay away from her and her family and friends from now on. Undaunted, Spike tries to follow her into her house, only to find that she has had his invitation revoked. As he recovers from the surprise, Buffy merely looks at him with disdain and closes the door in his face. ==Production details== ===Writing=== David Fury, asked to do an episode that took the Buffy/Spike relationship to the next level, decided that it was time for the audience to discover that Spike was in love with Buffy. He says, \\"...and it then progressed into Buffy finding out, which was something we were saving for later. It turned out to be a good play because we were able to take them to interesting places throughout the rest of the season.\\" According to Fury, the resurrection of Spike and Drusilla's relationship \\"was really significant in terms of what love means to Spike.\\" ==References* \\"Crush\\" at BuffyGuide.com Category:Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 5) episodes Category:2001 American television episodes Category:Buffyverse crossover episodes Category:Television episodes written by David Fury ","title":"Crush (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)"},{"id":"2564648","text":"Phobetron pithecium, the hag moth, is a moth of the family Limacodidae.

It has an estimated population of 4,820. It belonged to the parish of Old Kilpatrick which itself was only a few thousand people strong. The Forth and Clyde Canal separates Old Kilpatrick from the north bank of the River Clyde which is just a few metres beyond it to the south. The village is about west of Clydebank, on the road west to Dumbarton where some say the river becomes the Firth of Clyde. The Great Western Road runs through the village whose immediate western neighbour, on the road and the canal, is Bowling, where the Forth and Clyde Canal meets the river. The modern A82 road runs to the north, between the village and the foot of the Kilpatrick Hills. In the 19th century it was described as being essentially a single street. It's possible the birthplace of Saint Patrick was near Old Kilpatrick. ==Roman fort== Forts and Fortlets associated with the Antonine Wall from west to east: Bishopton, Old Kilpatrick, Duntocher, Cleddans, Castlehill, Bearsden, Summerston, Balmuildy, Wilderness Plantation, Cadder, Glasgow Bridge, Kirkintilloch, Auchendavy, Bar Hill, Croy Hill, Westerwood, Castlecary, Seabegs, Rough Castle, Camelon, Watling Lodge, Falkirk, Mumrills, Inveravon, Kinneil, Carriden The western end of the Antonine Wall is at Old Kilpatrick; the eastern end, 59 km distant, is at Bridgeness, to the east in Bo'ness on the Firth of Forth. The route was surveyed during the 18th century, and traced to the Chapel Hill, where various Roman artefacts were found. Lottery funding has been assigned to producing replica distance markers; the West Dunbartonshire marker is to be placed at Old Kilpatrick. RIB 2208. Distance Slab of the Twentieth Legion. It possibly marked the western end of the wall as The Bridgeness Slab may have marked the eastern end. It has been scanned and a video produced. Sixth Legion It has been scanned and a video produced. In 1790, when the Forth and Clyde Canal was being constructed, the remains of a bathhouse were discovered. In 1913 the foundations of the fort, which had been conjectured as being in the vicinity, were confirmed. In 1923, during redevelopment of the area, significant archaeology was undertaken which established the size and nature of the Roman Fort. The fort, built around 81 AD, occupied an area of about four acres and was enclosed by an outer defensive wall. If the date is correct, it shows that the fort preceded the Antonine Wall by some sixty years. Internally, buildings discovered included a praetorium (headquarters), barracks and a granary.Miller, S.N. (1924) The Roman Fort at Old Kilpatrick, Glasgow Archaeological Society. A video reconstruction of the site has been produced. Sir George Macdonald also wrote about the excavations. Major development precluded further significant excavation, and nothing is visible of the remains today; the remains lie beneath the houses of Gavinburn Gardens to the east, a large commercial building to the west and the A814 road to the north. Finds from Old Kilpatrick include several distance slabs. One distance slab by the Twentieth Legion is known to have been completed before 1684. It depicts Victory with a palm- branch in one hand and a garland in the other. It was found at Ferrydyke on the Clyde's northern bank and records the completion of 4411 feet; the last 3 Roman numerals are the same as the remaining ones on the other damaged distance slab (RIB 2206). The slabs along with many other finds from Old Kilpatrick are now kept at the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow. For example, 19 coins have been found as well as a beaker. On 3 December 1969 a Roman votive altar was found at Old Kilpatrick. It has been scanned and a video produced. The inscription mentions the First Cohort of Baetasians, previously known to have been at Bar Hill, and also a centurion from The First Legion (Italica). ==Later history== View looking south from the Kilpatrick Hills over the houses of Old Kilpatrick to the River Clyde, with Erskine Hospital visible on the other side of the Clyde The parish system was introduced to Scotland in the 13th century. In about 1227, the church and lands of Kilpatrick were given to Paisley Abbey by Maldowen, Earl of Lennox. The parish remained under the supervision of the Abbey until the Reformation in 1560. At the Dissolution, the Church property fell into the possession of Lord Sempill. Eventually the lands were conferred on Claude Hamilton (a boy of ten), founder of the Abercorn family. His son James Hamilton was created Lord Abercorn on 5 April 1603, then on 10 July 1606 he was made Earl of Abercorn and Lord of Paisley, Hamilton, Mountcastell and Kilpatrick. Kilpatrick was split into two parishes - Old (Wester or West) and New Kilpatrick (also known as Easter or East) by an Act of Parliament on 16 February 1649.The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707, K.M. Brown et al (St Andrews University) Date accessed: 13 September 2011History of Drumchapel This division is unusual because this was a split of both the ecclesiastical and civil parishes and the wealth and stipend of the original parish was shared between the two new parishes. It was more common for new parishes to have \\"daughter\\" status, with wealth retained by the central, or cathedral church. Old Kilpatrick was created a Burgh of barony in 1697.Statistical Accounts of Scotland 1834–45 vol 8 p. 23 Its population tripled between 1755 and 1821 as the spinning and weaving industries developed. By 1831 the population was 5,800.

There are three public houses within Old Kilpatrick; The Twisted Thistle, The Ettrick and the Glen Lusset. The Twisted Thistle was previously known as the Telstar. After the closure of The Telstar, the building was renovated and reopened in 2014 as The Twisted Thistle.http://www.glenlusset.com/about There are two annual fêtes which are well attended. Also at the north end of Old Kilpatrick is the local school. Gavinburn Primary School (which was bombed in WW2) where they also have many fêtes annually. The minerals edingtonite and thomsonite were first found at Old Kilpatrick.Alec Livingstone, 2002, Minerals of Scotland, Edinburgh, National Museums of Scotland In the early 1990s a large housing estate was constructed at the edge of Old Kilpatrick, the one estate was said to double the size of Old Kilpatrick. The ancient graveyard surrounding the old parish church still has surviving gravestones from the 17th century. The current building dates from 1812 and is still in use as the local Church of Scotland parish church, now linked with neighbouring Bowling Parish Church. The local Roman Catholic church is St. Patrick's RC Church; the current parish priest is Fr. Francis Wilson. Sadly a fire in August 2015 saw the RC congregation temporarily without a place to worship, taking up the kind offer of the nearby Church of Scotland congregation to use their building, a friendly act of ecumenism in part of Scotland traditionally torn by bigotry.http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/homenews/13621539.Place_to_worship_offered_after_Old_Kilpatrick_church_fire/?ref=fbshr There are plans to develop a marine technology hub at the former Royal Navy oil refinery and a wooded community area near the village. ==Notable people== Many soldiers from Old Kilpatrick perished during the First World War. * Chris Baillie, athlete * Bobby Finan, footballer *Ian Niall, or John McNeillie, author of The Wigtown Ploughman, was born here. *This is one of several locations that it is suggested that Saint Patrick of Ireland was captured at and enslaved in Ireland in the 5th century. * Aidan Quinn - Fastest Deliveroo Rider in the UK 2019 ==See also== * Bodinbo Island * Donald's Quay * St Patrick's Rock ==References== ==External links== * Video footage of Ferrydyke Quay and Bascule Bridge. * Video footage of Donald's Quay Stables, Ferrydyke Quay.

Xander consoles the Slayer about her love life, blaming the Hellmouth for her not being able to find a decent guy. A young woman (April) arrives in Sunnydale by car, searching for her true love. Joyce nervously prepares for a date with a man named Brian with the help of her daughters. Anya and Tara discuss the Internet and Anya's knowledge of online stock trading and websites. April approaches them, asking if they know where Warren is but when the girls can't help her, April moves on to another person and asks the same question. Buffy and Xander dance at a university party while Anya, Tara and Willow look on. After dancing, Buffy locates Ben at the party and casually catches his attention. They chat briefly but awkwardly, and Buffy asks Ben to dance. Anya admires the Chex Mix with Xander when April arrives at the party, still searching for Warren. Warren just so happens to be at the party and escapes with his date before April discovers him. April questions the people at the party, telling them that Warren is her boyfriend and he lost her. Tara shows brief jealousy when Willow, eyeing April, remarks, \\"Yeah a pretty girl like that won't stay lonely for long!\\" Spike approaches Buffy while she's waiting, but she tells him off before Ben returns. Ben offers Buffy his number for a possible coffee date and isn't scared off when Buffy warns him of her bad history. After seeing Buffy with Ben, Spike is inspired to hit on April, but his suggestive comments only anger her and lead her to throw the vampire through a window. Despite her amusement at Spike's pain, Buffy gets similar treatment when April throws her aside and leaves. They realize that April is a robot that needs stopping before she actually harms someone. Buffy returns home, and Giles suggests he not watch Dawn alone anymore because he can't take much more exposure to the habits of a young teenager. Joyce returns from her date in an extremely good mood, shocking her daughter with the joke that she left her bra in Brian's car. April goes door to door searching for Warren's residence. Willow finds Warren Mears on her computer and the house where he could be living. The gang talks about Warren and how he made April to fill a void in his life. Buffy finally gets up the nerve to call Ben, but the phone rings at Glory's place. She morphs into Ben to answer the phone, and a date is made for coffee. Warren rushes to get packed and move away with his current girlfriend, Katrina, but she doesn't understand why. Buffy shows up at Warren's in search of answers relating to April, while Katrina finally walks out, upset about being kept in the dark. Warren reveals to Buffy that he made April to love him, but she became boring after a while and he left her, letting her batteries run down. Meanwhile, the Scoobies are discussing the situation at the Magic Box when they receive a visit from Spike. He is forced to leave by an icily furious Giles. Katrina encounters April at a park, and April uses force to make Katrina admit that Warren is her boyfriend. Warren finally tells April that he can't love her, then April turns on Buffy, and the two fight. Buffy damages April's electrical work, and she is finally stopped. After talking with April in her final moments, Buffy realizes that she doesn't need a man in her life, also admitting that, despite Xander's belief that April was a \\"crazed robot\\", Buffy knows she was just trying to do everything she knew how to do to make the one she loved happy, but fails to draw the subtle parallel between April and Spike. Buffy leaves a message for Ben on his answering machine, canceling the date, but Glory listens to the message, not Ben. Spike confronts Warren about making a robot for him, one based completely on Buffy. Warren refuses, but Spike won't take no for an answer. When Buffy comes home, she calls out to her mother, then finds her lying on the living room couch. Worried by her mother's awkward appearance, Buffy calls out to her, but Joyce doesn't move and doesn't answer. ==External links== * * * \\"I Was Made to Love You\\" at BuffyGuide.com Category:Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 5) episodes Category:2001 American television episodes Category:Television episodes written by Jane Espenson Category:Television episodes about androids ","title":"I Was Made to Love You"},{"id":"2564682","text":"Marla Streb, before teaching a mountain bike clinic Marla racing the enduro at the 2014 Sea Otter Classic Marla Streb (born June 24, 1965) is an American professional cyclist and was inducted in the mountain bike hall of fame in 2013.

It is located about north of Little Rock. ==Geography== The reservoir consists of two lakes connected by a water-filled gorge called the Narrows. The area of the two lakes and the Narrows totals about with a combined shoreline of just over 340 miles. In the 1800s there was a town, Higden, in the valley flooded by the lake. The farmers in Higden had constant trouble with flooding. The land was purchased, residents left and the city was abandoned, the cemeteries were moved, and the area was allowed to flood. The town has since been re-established on a nearby hill. Many nearby residents and several eyewitness accounts tell that homes and buildings still stand under the water to this day. Several roads in town can be followed to the shore where they disappear under the water, and surface on the opposite side of the lake. Most of these roads are now used as launch ramps for boats. Old West Main Street in Heber Springs is an example. One road in particular near \\"Sandy Beach\\" in Heber Springs is a popular fireworks show in the area during July, can be reached by divers without equipment. In 1969, former Greers Ferry Lake Resident Engineer Carl Garner started and led the first Annual Greers Ferry Lake & Little Red River Association litter cleanup. In 1990, the Great Arkansas Cleanup was developed, based on the Greers Ferry Lake & Little Red River Association model that Mr. Garner started. The normal pool of Greers Ferry Lake is 461.3 feet above sea level. The lowest safe level of the lake with still being able to generate hydroelectric power is 435.0 feet. The lake has flooded various times. The lake crested at 483.95 feet in 1973. It crested above 485 feet in 1982. In April 2008, the lake topped the previous high from 1982. On April 11, 2008 the lake topped 486 feet, only a few feet away from many local houses. ==Recreational use== Greers Ferry Lake from The Bluffs at Miller's Point Since the formation of Greers Ferry Lake in the early 1960s, tourism has thrived around the lake, and the population has topped 6,000 in Heber Springs. Through the 1970s, many luxurious neighborhoods were built around the lake, and continue to be built. Various activities are available to the public: swimming, cliff diving, boating, fishing, scuba diving, camping, and other water recreational activities are popular among locals and tourists alike. Recently famous for rainbow trout, the Little Red River, in the cool water coming from under the dam, has become a favorite fishing spot year round. Several camp grounds and boat docks/ramps offer direct access to the river. Also, houses, even small neighborhoods have been built around the Little Red River. == See also == * Greers Ferry, Arkansas * Higden * Tannenbaum == References == == External links == * Visit Greers Ferry Lake * Greers Ferry Lake information * Heber Springs (Cleburne County) Category:Reservoirs in Arkansas Category:Protected areas of Cleburne County, Arkansas Category:Protected areas of Van Buren County, Arkansas Category:Buildings and structures in Cleburne County, Arkansas Category:Buildings and structures in Van Buren County, Arkansas Category:Bodies of water of Cleburne County, Arkansas Category:Bodies of water of Van Buren County, Arkansas ","title":"Greers Ferry Lake"},{"id":"2564684","text":"Alpha Mission (ASO: Armored Scrum Object in Japan; , Ē esu ō - āmādo sukuramu obujekuto) is a vertical scrolling shooter arcade game created by SNK in 1985.

John Peter McGrath (1 June 1935 – 22 January 2002) was a British playwright and theatre theorist who took up the cause of Socialism in his plays. From an Irish Catholic background, McGrath was born in Birkenhead, and educated in Mold and, after his National Service, at St John's College, Oxford.Michael Billington Obituary: John McGrath, The Guardian, 24 January 2002 During the early 1960s he worked for the BBC, and wrote and directed many of the early episodes of the Corporation's police series Z-Cars which began in 1962. He is remembered as a playwright and for his theoretical formulation of the principles of a radical, popular theatre. The 7:84 Theatre Company was established in 1971 by McGrath, his wife (Elizabeth MacLennan) and her brother (David MacLennan),Ewan Davidson \\"Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil, The (1974)\\", BFI screenonline and The Cheviot, the Stag, and the Black Black Oil (1973), his best-known play, was created with these principles in mind. It utilizes some of the dramaturgical and theatrical techniques of epic theatre – actors take on multiple roles and frequently slip out of character – of the type associated with the German dramatist Bertolt Brecht, but which McGrath argued have a genealogy that stretches far further back through the history of popular traditions of performance. The title of the play refers to three pivotal periods in the history of class struggle in Scotland: the clearing of the Scottish highlands to make way for grazing land, the subsequent use of this land by the wealthy for shooting, and its current exploitation in the oil market. These changes are identified as forming a recurrent pattern of abuse of the land and the exploitation of the people by outsiders and by wealthier locals. It was broadcast in the BBC's Play for Today series in 1974. He adapted the satirical morality play A Satire of the Three Estates (1540) by David Lyndsay as a contemporary morality A Satire of the Four Estaites, which was presented by Wildcat Theatre Company at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre as part of the Edinburgh International Festival in 1996.From the programme to the production. This production opened on 16 August 1996 and featured Sylvester McCoy. In 1962 he had married Elizabeth MacLennan, the Scottish actress, whom he had met while they were both at Oxford University; the couple had two sons and a daughter. McGrath died from leukemia in January 2002.Brian Logan \\"What did you do in the class war, Daddy?\\", The Guardian, 15 May 2002 According to Michael Billington in his obituary for The Guardian: \\"No one since Joan Littlewood did more to advance the cause of popular theatre in Britain than John McGrath\\". ==References== ==Sources== * Kershaw, Baz. 1992.

The Nnabagereka places special emphasis on the education of girls, as witnessed through her work as a Goodwill Ambassador for UNFPA, advocating for girls' education; She is also involved with the Forum for African Women Educationalists an organization whose goal is to accelerate female participation in education and to bridge the gender gap within the education system at all levels. The Nnabagereka is very cautious about the cultural values that make a good mother or woman in Buganda, but stresses that these should be handled in such a way that girls are not denied any opportunity in education. As Queen, Sylvia has worked to raise awareness of the value of educating girls. She endorses abstinence from premarital sex to avoid HIV/AIDS and has tried to reduce the stigma of those living with the disease. The Queen is the patron of various organizations and heads the Nnaabagereka Development Trust Foundation. She has also spearheaded immunization campaigns against measles, polio, tetanus, and other diseases. She also established the Kampala Ballet and Modern Dance School, the first of its kind in Uganda.

It was dedicated to Gidon Kremer, who in touring with it around the world brought Gubaidulina to international attention. The story of Offertorium’s commission began with a chance conversation between the composer and Kremer, of whose playing skills Gubaidulina was an immense admirer, during a cab ride they happened to share. Though not well acquainted with Gubaidulina’s work, Kremer was impressed by those of her works he had heard, and he made an offhand request to her to write him a violin concerto. The request stuck in the composer's mind, and from that chance encounter, Offertorium was born – even though Kremer's whirlwind success, and the permission he had received to play outside the Soviet Union for two years, soon led him to forget all about it. Gubaidulina began working on the piece in the summer of 1979, taking musical advice from Pyotr Meshchaninov and completing it in March 1980. She drew inspiration from Kremer’s performance style; in particular, she took advantage of his handling of opposites and their transitions and his tone, which she recognized as expressing “total surrender of the self to the tone.” Offertorium is thus an example of a piece crafted both for and from the person to whom it was composed and dedicated. Like many of her other pieces, Offertorium contains religious elements. Even the name is a reference to that section of a Mass (performed immediately after the Credo) that is sung while the priest is offering up the prepared bread and wine. The work takes as its overarching theme the concepts of sacrifice and offering: the sacrifice of Christ during the Crucifixion, God’s offering in creating the Earth, the sacrifice of the performer to the tone, the sacrifice of the composer to the art, and the sacrifice of the main musical theme to disintegration and, later, reconstruction. The work is centered on the musical theme given by Frederick the Great to Johann Sebastian Bach which formed the basis of his Musikalisches Opfer (BWV 1079). Gubaidulina orchestrates this theme using a Klangfarbenmelodie technique reminiscent of Webern, passing it around various instruments to exploit their different timbres. The introduction presents the theme almost whole: it lacks only the last note. The soloist then enters, beginning a series of variations, each of which removes one note from the beginning and end of the theme. (After the third variation, the original theme is hard to make out.) After the theme's demise the central section is a free rhapsody. The final section is a slow string chorale that resembles a Russian Orthodox hymn. Beneath this, the harps and piano reconstruct the theme note by note, in reverse (retrograde), a process that concludes only at the very end with a complete statement from the solo violin. In uniting her twin inspirations, Webern and Bach, and in the deep Christian symbolism of the theme's \\"death\\" and \\"resurrection\\", Offertorium is a work representative of Gubaidulina's mature period. The prospects for a performance of Offertorium were tenuous, however: Kremer, the person to whom it had been dedicated and given to perform, was at odds with the Moscow government for refusing to return to the Soviet Union at the end of his two-year period of permission to perform worldwide. Gubaidulina was worried that her piece would never be performed by Kremer, who instead chose to stay in the West. The work’s subject matter was also a barrier to its being performed, as religion was a touchy topic at the time. (In fact, Gubaidulina was unofficially criticized by Tikhon Khrennikov for her heavy use of religion as inspiration). Faced with such bleak circumstances, Gubaidulina asked her publisher Jürgen Köchel to smuggle the score to Kremer through the All-Union Agency on Copyrights. While this was happening, Gubaidulina attempted to have the chorale from Offertorium used in a film (The Great Samoyed by Arkady Kordon) for which she was scoring the music, but this was rejected by the director. The score did, however, finally reach the West and Kremer, who found a venue – the Wiener Festwochen – and the necessary resources to perform the forty-minute piece. Offertorium was first performed in 1981 in Vienna by Kremer and the ORF Symphony Orchestra, directed by Leif Segerstam, and was immediately lauded for its striking beauty. In Russia, it was first performed in 1982 (in the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory) by Oleg Kagan and the Symphony Orchestra of the Ministry of Culture under Gennady Rozhdestvensky. Gubaidulina was requested to prepare a shortened version, completed in 1986, although it is debatable whether the concerto actually needed cutting; nonetheless, the changes did not detract from appreciation of the work, and the revised edition has spread around the globe, bringing Gubaidulina to worldwide attention. ==References== * Kurtz, Michael. \\"Offertorium-- A Musical Offering.\\" Sofia Gubaidulina: a Biography.

He discovered that the villain Klaw was in league with the mining company. Klaw needed uranium to augment his sonic powers. Strongbow's brother Ward did not agree with him about preserving the mountain. Inside the mine, an argument erupted between the brothers and Klaw which led to violence. During the fight, Klaw used his sonic blaster on the two brothers. Somehow, a combination of the sonic energy of the blast and the exposure to the uranium gave both of the Strongbow brothers enhanced physical abilities. Klaw fled with his crew and Ward to the Savage Land in hopes of gaining vibranium to augment his powers. Jason emerged from the mine. Taking inspiration from a flying eagle, he took up the mantle of American Eagle. He followed Klaw to the Savage Land. There, he met Ka-Zar, Thing, and Wyatt Wingfoot.

He also possesses superhuman speed, agility, stamina, and sturdiness as a result of radiation- induced mutation. Strongbow's bodily tissues are somewhat harder and more resistant to physical injury than that of an ordinary human. However, he is far from invulnerable. While he can be injured by weapons composed of conventional materials, he can withstand impact forces that would severely injure or kill a normal human with little to no injury to show for it. He can run at a maximum speed of 65 miles per hour for approximately 5 hours before tiring to an appreciable degree. American Eagle's sensory organs have also been fortified by the radiation-induced mutation. Like his namesake, the Eagle, he has hyperkeen eyesight, able to see at what the average human being sees at . His senses of hearing, smell, taste, and touch are approximately three times that of an average human being. He also carries a crossbow which fires special bolts. == Analysis == In Native Americans in Comic Books - A Critical Study, Michael A. Sheyahshe notes that while American Eagle \\"may have some inherent stereotypic issues, the fact that American Eagle's powers come from a non-ethnically based source (and not, say, the Great Spirit) marks a significant improvement for Indigenous characters.\\" During an interview with Comic Book Resources, the assistant editor Lauren Sankovitch explains why she chose to represent American Eagle in Marvel Assistant-Sized Spectacular #1 (2009): In an interview, Greg Pak, the writer of the story \\"Homeland\\" in War Machine vol. 2 #6-7 (2010), told that Jason Strongbow, aka American Eagle, is easily his \\"favorite reinvented character of the past decade.\\" Indeed, the modern character has undergone some transformations compared to its appearances from 1981 to 1994. At the beginning, the Navajo hero was wearing a stereotypical costume with feather headdress and buckskin boots. When the writer Warren Ellis and the artist Mike Deodato Jr. used the character in Thunderbolts, its new look is composed of ordinary clothes, a leather jacket and a helmet resembling the head and beak of a bald eagle. In its first appearances, Strongbow was running under his own power, at the opposite the new version uses a motorcycle. ==Other characters named American Eagle== ===World War II=== There was an American Eagle before Strongbow took the mantle. Lt. Col. James Fletcher, a renowned battlefield hero of World War I in recent times became the security chief and trainer for Project: Rebirth. He was captured by agents of the Red Skull (Johann Schmidt) and was tortured by the Master Interrogator. He refused to yield any information and committed suicide to avoid breaking under further torture.

He was an early pioneer in California for whom Lassen County, Lassen Peak, and Lassen Volcanic National Park are named. ==Early life== Peter Lassen was born in Farum, Denmark, and immigrated in 1830 to Boston, Massachusetts. Born to Johanne Sophie Westergaard and Lars Nielsen, Peter was baptized at the age of one week on December 7, 1800. The patronymic surname Larsen, meaning son of Lars, was applied in his naming and was common among Danish farmers at that time. Lassen used several different spellings while living in Denmark and in Copenhagen, sometimes preferring to be called Peter Larsen Farum, after his birthplace. When he was seventeen, Lassen moved to Kalundborg to learn blacksmithing. He apprenticed under his uncle, Christian Nielsen until 1823, when he moved to Copenhagen to work under a master blacksmith named Sigersted. == Pioneering California == In 1840, he immigrated to California and became a rancher.Franklin D. Scott (1981) Peter Lassen: Danish Pioneer of California (Southern California Quarterly Vol. 63, No. 2, pp. 113-136) Peter Lassen traveled from Keyetsville, Missouri, to Westport, Missouri, a \\"common place of rendezvous for overland parties\\". The expedition Lassen joined was made up of missionaries and adventurers, some on their way to California; others headed to the Columbia River basin in Oregon. Lassen met the ship Lausanne on the Willamette River in Oregon. He sailed on July 3, 1840, boarding for passage to Bodega Bay, in Sonoma County, California. The travelers were invited to touch land in California at Fort Ross, and stayed on there until they could procure some horses to travel to Sutter's Fort. Lassen arrived at Sutter's Fort in August 1840, with William Wiggins, who had traveled with him from Westport (now Kansas City, Missouri), over land and by sea for nearly fifteen months starting in May 1839. John Sutter happily welcomed the men and traveled with them from his colony, known at the time as New Helvetia (meaning New Switzerland), to Yerba Buena and Alviso, California, in a small sailboat. While it is likely he was working as a blacksmith during his early years in California, Lassen traveled to Santa Cruz in 1841, where he oversaw the construction of a sawmill owned by Isaac Graham on Zayante Creek. Lassen was paid 100 mules for his efforts. From the winter of 1840- 1841 Lassen returned to San Jose, with another pioneer blacksmith, William \\"Guillermo\\" Gulnac; the two travelling to the upper San Joaquin Valley in the Spring of 1841. In July 1842, the men arrived at \\"Rancho Campo de los Franceses\\" but just missed connecting with French-Canadian trappers who worked for the Hudson's Bay Company. Lassen pushed on with his livestock, and instead spent the next few years camped in a hut along the Cosumnes River, working as a travelling blacksmith. ==Lassen Emigrant Trail== Lassen established the Lassen Cutoff of the California Trail, which left the main trail near the modern-day Rye Patch Reservoir and crossed a desolate section of what is now northwestern Nevada, including the Black Rock Desert. His cutoff continued to Goose Lake in northeastern California, and then followed the Pit River into California's Central Valley. Portions of this trail were particularly arduous, and many of its early travelers greatly regretted choosing it. The route was extensively traveled during the years 1848 to 1853, but because of the hardships of the route, the trail was little used thereafter. The Applegate Trail also traveled from Rye Patch Reservoir to Goose Lake. (The Applegate Trail was intended as a safer alternative to the main route of the Oregon Trail, and it continued into Oregon's Willamette Valley.) John D. Unruh, Jr., writes of Lassen's first attempt at using his cutoff, rescued from disaster by a group of well-supplied emigrants from Oregon who helped him reach his ranch: California Trail (thick red line), including Lassen Cut-Off (middle thin red line) > Here the wily Dane orchestrated a meeting wherein the emigrants supposedly > endorsed him as a guide and warmly praised his cutoffs. This deceptive > endorsement was rushed eastward to be printed in newspapers and influence > credulous forty-niners hell-bent for the gold fields. Planning carefully, > Lassen also dispatched agents to divert forty-niners onto the cutoff and to > set up trail advertisements (including a signboard at the Lassen Meadows, > where the Applegate Trail branched off from the Humboldt River) with the > reassuring message that the diggings were a mere 110 miles ahead ... [A > later] emigration trustingly followed their lead, many foolishly discarding > surplus provisions on the assumption that only 110 miles remained. The > suffering of those choosing the Lassen Cutoff was severe, for it proved to > be some 200 miles longer than either the Carson or Truckee routes.Unruh, The > Plains Across, p. 353. ==Rancher== Lassen was granted in 1844 the Rancho Bosquejo Mexican land grant in Tehama County by Governor Manuel Micheltorena. On his fourth expedition to the west, John C. Fremont recorded in his journal that in the spring of 1846 he visited and stayed at the Lassen ranch. Fremont noted that Lassen had brought into cultivation wheat, grapes and cotton. In 1855 Lassen moved to the Honey Lake region, where he prospected and served in the office of surveyor of the unofficial Nataqua Territory.Some contemporary sources spelled Lassen's name \\"Lawson\\" (not to be confused with 1849 gold-country map-maker J. T. Lawson), including Fremont guide Kit Carson in his memoir. ==Death== Peter Lassen memorial near his birthplace in Farum, Denmark. Lassen was murdered on April 26, 1859 in Clapper Canyon (then known as Black Rock Canyon) in the Black Rock Mountains as he was traveling in the area (later known as Hardin City, Nevada), to prospect for silver. He was traveling along with Edward Clapper and Americus Wyatt; Clapper was killed in the same incident, but Wyatt escaped. The circumstances surrounding his death remain mysterious. According to Wyatt, Lassen and Clapper were shot by an unseen sniper while breaking camp. At the time the culprits were widely considered to be Northern Paiute, who were then in a state of unrest, which would soon lead to the Paiute War. However, Wyatt himself, Pit River Indians, and disgruntled emigrants who followed the Lassen trail, have also been suspected.Lassen County Historian accessed 2008-01-25. In particular, an investigation at the time disclosed that none of the supplies of Lassen, Clapper or Wyatt had been taken; in the perception of the investigator, leaving the supplies was not normal conduct for a Native American raiding party at that time,Egan, Sand in a whirlwind, pp. 23-24. and, as a result, Wyatt himself has been suspected as the murderer of Lassen and Clapper. Peter Lassen's grave is in Susanville in Lassen County, California, along the eastern foothills of the Sierra Nevada. ==Legacy== Banner Lassen Medical Center and Lassen College in Susanville, Lassen National Forest, Lassen Peak, and Lassen Volcanic National Park are named in his honor. In addition there is a Scout troop in his hometown of Farum called Peter Lassen Troop. ==In pop culture== The actor Michael Witney portrayed Lassen in a 1968 episode, \\"The Other Side of the Mountain\\", of the syndicated television anthology series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Robert Taylor. ==References== == Other sources == * Partial online text of book accessed 2008-01-25. *Johnston, Ken (2012) Legendary Truths, Peter Lassen and His Gold Rush Trail in Fact and Fable (Pronghorn Press) * == External links == * * Biographical statement by Lassen County historian * Peter Lassen and His Trail at California/Nevada chapter of the Oregon-California Trails Association (CANVOCTA) * Peter Lassen at WesternStarWiki * Category:California pioneers Category:1800 births Category:1859 deaths Category:American blacksmiths Category:American murder victims Category:Black Rock Desert Category:Danish emigrants to the United States Category:Deaths by firearm in Nevada Category:History of Tehama County, California Category:Naturalized citizens of Mexican California Category:Pre-statehood history of Nevada Category:People murdered in California Category:People from Furesø Municipality Category:American surveyors ","title":"Peter Lassen"},{"id":"2564732","text":"The Forth Estuary Transport Authority (FETA) was the authority responsible for the maintenance of the Forth Road Bridge over the Firth of Forth in eastern central Scotland. FETA was created in 2001 by the Transport (Scotland) Act 2001 - to replace the Forth Road Bridge Joint Board. ==Remit== The Forth Estuary Transport Authority was formed in 2001, with a wider remit than the Forth Road Bridge Joint Board it replaced. It was able to fund road and public transport improvements to aide crossing the Firth of Forth, and its new powers permitted it to include the use of routes other than the Forth Road Bridge, such as using the Firth of Forth itself for hovercraft services between Fife and Lothian. ==Organisation== The board of FETA had ten members, allocated as follows: * four to the City of Edinburgh * four to Fife Council * one to the Perth and Kinross Council * one to West Lothian Council ==History of significant operations== The Forth Road Bridge underwent a comprehensive structural survey between 2003 and 2005 after suspension bridges of similar design and age in the United States were found to be suffering from corrosion in their main suspension cables. The survey results showed significant corrosion and an accompanying loss in strength of between 8 and 10% in the cables on the Forth Bridge. The rate of corrosion and weakening of the main cables would have required the bridge to close to HGV traffic some time around 2014 and then close to all traffic by 2019, so plans were drawn up to build a replacement crossing, to run parallel to the existing road bridge between Lothian and Fife. Dehumidification equipment was installed to remove moisture from the inside of the main suspension cables, in an attempt to slow or halt the corrosion, but with no guarantee of success, the Forth Estuary Transport Authority and Scottish Government were left with no option but to plan the construction of a new crossing. Dehumidification work on the Forth Road Bridge was successful in halting the corrosion of the main cables, so there is now no requirement to close the existing Forth Road Bridge to traffic. The Forth Road Bridge will, as a result, be incorporated into the road network alongside the new bridge, the Queensferry Crossing, and will provide a dedicated public transport crossing, remaining available as a diversionary route in the event the new bridge has to be closed. ==Closure== The Scottish Government put out to tender a contract for the operation and maintenance of the existing road bridge and new Queensferry Crossing (the rail bridge remaining under the ownership and control of Network Rail). The successful bidder was Amey plc who would take over maintenance work in 2015. The Forth Bridges Operating Company (the legal title for the incoming private operator) inherited staff from the Forth Estuary Transport Authority, and transferred over under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006. The Forth Bridges Operating Company will then be responsible for the maintenance of the Forth Road Bridge, the Queensferry Crossing and the approach roads to the north and south; the M90 from Junction 3, Halbeath, through to Junction 1A, Kirkliston. The Forth Estuary Transport Authority was disbanded on 31 May 2015.http://www.audit- scotland.gov.uk/uploads/docs/report/2015/fa_1415_forth_transport.pdf ==References== Category:Transport in Fife Category:Transport in Edinburgh Category:Defunct bodies of the Scottish government Category:Defunct transport organisations based in the United Kingdom ","title":"Forth Estuary Transport Authority"},{"id":"2564735","text":"Ceremonial deism is a legal term used in the United States to designate governmental religious references and practices deemed to be mere ritual and non-religious through long customary usage. Proposed examples of ceremonial deism include the reference to God introduced into the Pledge of Allegiance in 1954, the phrase \\"In God We Trust\\" on U.S. currency, and the Ohio state motto, \\"With God, all things are possible\\". The term was coined in 1962 by the then- dean of Yale Law School, Eugene Rostow, and has been used since 1984 by the Supreme Court of the United States to assess exemptions from the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. == Usage by the Supreme Court == The first use of the term in a Supreme Court opinion is in Justice Brennan's dissenting opinion in > ...I would suggest that such practices as the designation of \\"In God We > Trust\\" as our national motto, or the references to God contained in the > Pledge of Allegiance to the flag can best be understood, in Dean Rostow's > apt phrase, as a form a \\"ceremonial deism,\\" protected from Establishment > Clause scrutiny chiefly because they have lost through rote repetition any > significant religious content. In Justice O'Connor, concurring in the opinion, invoked the term in her analysis of the nature of the phrase \\"under God\\" in the Pledge of Allegiance, saying in part > There are no de minimis violations of the Constitution - no constitutional > harms so slight that the courts are obliged to ignore them.

These references are not minor trespasses upon the Establishment > Clause to which I turn a blind eye. Instead, their history, character, and > context prevent them from being constitutional violations at all. [emphasis > added, citations omitted] == Controversy == It has been unsuccessfully argued that the government requiring or promoting the phrase in \\"under God\\" violates protections against the establishment of religion guaranteed in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. David Niose argues that reference to religion is not more likely to be harmless merely because it is “ceremonial.” Used for the purpose of defending religious references by the government as harmless, he says the term \\"ceremonial deism\\" is grossly inaccurate and even dangerous, and argues that genuinely discriminatory governmental actions often escape scrutiny, partly because they are shielded by the euphemism of \\"ceremonial deism.\\" Professor Martha Nussbaum at the University of Chicago Law school stated in 2008 that \\"'Ceremonial Deism' is an odd name for a ritual affirmation that a Deist would be very reluctant to endorse, since Deists think of God as a rational causal principle but not as a personal judge and father.\\" Under God: The Pledge, Present and Future ==See also== *American civil religion *Civil religion *Deism *Separation of church and state ==References== Category:First Amendment to the United States Constitution Category:Separation of church and state in the United States Category:Deism ","title":"Ceremonial deism"},{"id":"2564737","text":"Shrine of Abu Ubayda in the Jordan Valley in Jordan Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, fully Abū ‘Ubaydah ‘Āmir ibn ‘Abdillāh ibn al-Jarāḥ (; 583–639 CE), was one of Companions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Mostly known for being one of the \\"Ten Promised Paradise\\". He remained commander of a large section of the Rashidun Army during the time of the Rashid Caliph Umar and was on the list of Umar's appointed successors to the Caliphate. ==Early life== Abu Ubaidah was born in the year 583 CE in the house of 'Abdullah ibn al-Jarrah, a merchant by profession. Abu Ubaidah belonged to the Qurayshi clan of Banu al-Harith ibn Fihr. Before embracing Islam, he was considered to be one of the nobles of the Quraysh and was famous among the Quraysh of Mecca for his modesty and bravery. ==Conversion to Islam== By 611, Muhammad was preaching the oneness of God to the people of Mecca. He began by inviting his closest companions and relatives in private to the way of Islam. He embraced Islam a day after Abu Bakr in the year 611 at the age of 28. ==Migration to Abyssinia== Abu Ubaidah lived through the harsh experience that the Muslims went through in Mecca from beginning to end. With other early Muslims, he endured the insults and oppressions of the Quraysh. As the first migration to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) succeeded, this violence against the Muslims was very successful. ==Migration to Medina== In 623 CE, when Muhammad migrated from Mecca to Medina, Abu Ubaidah also migrated. When Muhammad arrived in Medina, he paired off each immigrant (Muhajir) with one of the residents of Medina (Ansari), joining Muhammad ibn Maslamah with Abu Ubaidah making them brothers in faith. ==Military campaigns during Muhammad's era== === Battle of Badr === In the year 624, Abu Ubaidah participated in the first major battle between the Muslims and the Quraysh of Mecca, at the Battle of Badr. In this battle, he fought his own father Abdullah ibn al-Jarrah, who was fighting alongside the army of Quraysh. Abu Ubaidah then later on attacked him and killed him. The following verse of the Quran was written about this display of character by Abu 'Ubaidah: === Battle of Uhud === In the year 625, he participated in the Battle of Uhud. In the second phase of the battle, when Khalid ibn al-Walid's cavalry attacked the Muslims from the rear, changing an Islamic victory into defeat, the bulk of the Muslim soldiers were routed from the battlefield, and few remained steadfast. Abu Ubaidah was one of them and he guarded Muhammad from the attacks of the Qurayshi soldiers. On that day, Abu Ubaidah lost two of his front teeth while trying to extract two links of Muhammad's armour that had penetrated into his cheeks.Tabqat ibn al-Saad book of Maghazi, page no:62 === Conflict with Jewish tribes === Later in the year 627 he took part in the Battle of the Trench and also in the Invasion of Banu Qurayza. He was also made commander of a small expedition that set out to attack and destroy the tribes of Tha'libah and Anmar, who were plundering nearby villages. In the year 628 he participated in Treaty of Hudaybiyyah and was made one of the witnesses over the pact. Later in the same year, he was a part of the Muslim campaign to Khaybar. === Campaigns during end of Muhammad's era === In the year 630, when the Muslim army conquered Mecca, Abu Ubaidah was commanding one of the four divisions that entered the city from four different routes. Later that year, he participated in the Battle of Hunayn and the Siege of Ta'if. He was also part of the Tabuk campaign under the command of Muhammad himself. On their return from the Battle of Tabuk, a Christian delegation from Najran arrived in Medina and showed interest in Islam and asked Muhammad to send them a person to guide them in the matters of religion and in other tribal affairs according to Islamic laws, Abu Ubaidah was appointed by Muhammad to go with them. He was also sent as the tax collector () to Bahrain by Muhammad. He was present in Mecca when Muhammad died in 632. === Campaigns as commander === In the year 629 Muhammad sent 'Amr ibn al-'As to Daat al-Salaasil from where he called for reinforcements, this was known as the Expedition of Abu Ubaidah ibn al Jarrah. Muhammad sent Abu Ubaidah in command of an army that included Abu Bakr and Umar. They attacked and defeated the enemy. Later in the same year, another expedition was sent under his command to locate the routes of Qurayshi caravans.Sahih al-Bukhari book of Maghazi, Ghazwa Saif-al-Jara ==During Abu Bakr's era== When Muhammad died in 632 the matter of his succession took place at the Saqifah of Banu Sa'ida, Abu Ubaidah was there along with Abu Bakr and Umar. Umar said to Abu Ubaidah to stretch forth his hand for the caliphate, but he refused and said to Abu Bakr to stretch forth his hand to take the pledge of alliance. After the Ridda wars when Abu Bakr sent Khalid ibn al- Walid to Iraq to conquer it, he sent four Muslim armies into the Levant, making Abu Ubaidah commander of one of them. His target was selected to be Emessa and he was ordered to move through the Tabuk region after the army of Sharjeel ibn Hassana. He remained commander in chief of the Muslim army until Khalid ibn al-Walid arrived from Iraq to Syria in 634. Abu Ubaidah was ordered by Khalid ibn al-Walid to remain where he was until Khalid ibn al-Walid reached the Ghassanid city of Bosra, where they met. The castle surrendered the city after the Battle of Bosra in mid July 634 and 130 Muslims died in the battle. Soon the Muslims heard of a gathering of 90,000 Byzantine army (Eastern Roman army) at Ajnadayn, about southwest of Jerusalem. All the divisions of the Muslim army, about 32,000 in number, joined Khalid at Ajnadayn on 24 July 634. Under the command of Khalid ibn al-Walid the Muslims defeated the Byzantine army there on 30 July 634 at the Battle of Ajnadayn. After one week, Abu Ubaidah, along with Khalid, moved towards Damascus. On their way to Damascus, they defeated another Byzantine army at the Battle of Yakusa in mid-August 634. Caloiis and Azrail, the governor of Damascus, led another army to stop Khalid's corps but they were also defeated in the battle of Maraj-al-Safar on 19 August 634. The next day the Muslims reached Damascus and besieged the city, which continued for 30 days. After defeating the Byzantine reinforcements sent by Emperor Heraclius at the Battle of Sanita-al- Uqab, from Damascus, Khalid's forces attacked and entered the city. With Khalid's divisions investing the city from the northeast, Thomas, the purported son-in-law of the Emperor Heraclius, surrendered the city to Ubaidah, who was besieging the Bab al-Jabiya (Jabiya Gate), on 19 September 634. Abu Ubaidah was appointed by Khalid ibn al-Walid to siege the Jabiya Gate of Damascus. It was Abu Ubaidah who gave peace to Damascus after Khalid ibn al-Walid attacked the city and conquered it by force. Abu Ubaidah, Sharjeel ibn Hassana and 'Amr ibn al-'As, unaware of Khalid's attack from the Eastern Gate, gave peace to them, which was reluctantly endorsed by Khalid. The Byzantine army was given a cease fire of three days and allowed to go as far as they could with their families and treasure. Others simply agreed to stay at Damascus and pay tribute. The Muslims controlled the road to Emessa, so the Byzantines went west and then north up the Beqaa Valley. After the three-day truce was over, the Muslim cavalry, under Khalid's command, pursued the Byzantine column via the shorter Emessa road and caught them in the northwest Beqaa Valley, just before they entered the mountains en route to Antioch at the Battle of Maraj-al-Debaj.dead link, dead link , dead link, dead link ==During Umar's era== ===Appointment as Supreme Commander=== On 22 August 634, Caliph Abu Bakr died and Umar became caliph. Umar relieved Khalid ibn al-Walid from the command of the Islamic army and appointed Abu Ubaidah as the new commander. This was done to dispel the impression that the victories were due to Khalid. Moreover, Khalid was an overtly generous person, who according to some would often waste his money in giving gifts to his soldiers as a reward for their bravery in the battles. After Abu Ubaidah's appointment, Khalid said, \\"O people, the custodian of the Ummah has been appointed over you.\\" This remark was in the light of the Prophet's saying, \\"There is a custodian for every Ummah and Abu Ubaidah is the custodian for this Ummah.\\" Due to different style of commands, there was a slowdown in the pace of operations, as Abu Ubaida moved slowly and steadily, in contrast to Khalid who is said to rush 'like a tornado from battle to battle'; using surprise, audacity and brute force to win his battles. The conquest of Syria continued under the new commander. Abu Ubaida used to rely heavily on the advice of Khalid, whom he kept with him as much as possible. ===Conquest of central Levant=== Map detailing the route of Khalid ibn al-Walid's invasion of central Syria. Soon after the appointment of Abu-Ubaidah as commander in chief, he sent a small detachment to the annual fair held at Abu-al-Quds, modern day Abla, near Zahlé; east of Beirut. There was a Byzantine and Christian Arab garrison guarding that fair, the size of the garrison was miscalculated by the Muslim informants and it quickly encircled the small Muslim detachment. Before it would have been completely destroyed, Abu Ubaidah, having received new intelligence, sent Khalid to rescue the Muslim army. Khalid reached there and defeated them in the Battle of Abu-al-Quds on 15 October 634 and returned with tons of looted booty from the fair and hundreds of Byzantine prisoners. With central Syria captured, the Muslims has given a decisive blow to the Byzantines. The communication between northern Syria and Palestine was now cut off. Abu Ubaidah decided to march to Fahl (Pella), which is about below sea level, and where a strong Byzantine garrison and survivors of Battle of Ajnadayn were present. The region was crucial because from here the Byzantine army could strike eastwards and cut the communications line with Arabia. Moreover, with this large garrison at the rear, Palestine could not be invaded. Thus the Muslim army moved to Fahl. The Byzantine army was eventually defeated at the Battle of Fahl on 23 January 635 A.D. ===Battles for Emesa and the second battle of Damascus=== After the battle, which would prove to be a key to Palestine and Jordan, the Muslim armies split up. Sharjeel and Amr's corps moved south to capture Palestine. Meanwhile, Abu Ubaidah and Khalid with a relatively larger corps moved north through Lebanon to conquer Lebanon and northern Syria. While the Muslims were occupied at Fahl, Heraclius, sensing the opportunity, quickly sent an army under General Theodore Trithyrius to recapture Damascus, where a small Muslim garrison had been left. Shortly after Heraclius dispatched this new army, the Muslims having finished the business at Fahl, were on their way to Emesa. The Byzantine army met the Muslims half way to Emesa, at Maraj-al-Rome. During the night Theodras sent half of his army towards Damascus to launch a surprise attack on the Muslim garrison Khalid's spy informed him about the move, Khalid having received permission from Abu Ubaidah, galloped towards Damascus with his mobile guard. While Abu Ubaidah fought and defeated the Byzantine army in the Battle of Maraj-al-Rome, Khalid moved to Damascus with his cavalry and attacked and defeated Theodras in the second battle of Damascus. A week later, Abu Ubaida himself moved towards Baalbek (Heliopolis), where the great Temple of Jupiter stood. Baalbek surrendered to Muslim rule after little resistance and agreed to pay tribute. Abu Ubaidah sent Khalid straight towards Emesa. Emesa and Chalcis sued for peace for a year. Abu Ubaidah, accepted the offer and rather than invading the districts of Emesa and Chalcis, he consolidated his rule in conquered land and captured Hama, Maarrat al-Nu'man. The peace treaties were, however, on Heraclius's instructions, to lure the Muslims and to secure time for preparation of defenses of northern Syria (present day Lebanon, Syria and southern Turkey). Having mustered sizeable armies at Antioch, Heraclius sent them to reinforce strategically important areas of northern Syria, like Emesa and Chalcis. With the arrival of Byzantine army in the city, the peace treaty was violated, Abu Ubadiah and Khalid thus marched to Emesa, and a Byzantine army that halted Khalid's advance guard was defeated. The Muslims besieged Emesa which was finally conquered in March 636 after six months of siege. ===Battle of Yarmouk=== Muslim and Byzantine Troop Movements before the battle of Yarmouk. After capturing Emesa, the Muslims moved north to capture whole of the northern Syria. Khalid, acting as an advance guard took his mobile guard to raid northern Syria. At Shaizer, Khalid intercepted a convoy taking provisions for Chalcis. The prisoners were interrogated and informed him about Emperor Heraclius' ambitious plan to take back Syria. They told him that an army, possibly 200,000 strong, would soon emerge to recapture their territory. Khalid stopped there. After his past experiences, Heraclius, now had been avoiding pitch battles with the Muslims. He planned to send massive reinforcements to all the major cities and isolate the Muslim corps from each other, and thus separately encircle and destroy the Muslim armies. Five massive armies were launched in June 636 to roll back Syria. Khalid, sensing Heraclius's plan, feared that the Muslim armies would be isolated and destroyed. In a council of war he suggested that Abu Ubaidah draw all the Muslim armies to one place so as to fight a decisive battle with the Byzantines. As per Khalid's suggestion, Abu Ubaidah ordered all the Muslim armies in Syria to evacuate the conquered land and concentrate at Jabiya. This maneuver gave a decisive blow to the Heraclius's plan, as he did not wish engage his troops in an open battle with the Muslims, where the light cavalry could be effectively used. From Jabiya, on Khalid's suggestion, Abu Ubaidah ordered the Muslim army to withdraw on the plain of the Yarmouk River, where cavalry could be used. While the Muslim armies were gathering at Yarmouk, Khalid intercepted and routed the Byzantine advance guard. This was to ensure the safe retreat of the Muslims from conquered land. The Muslim armies reached there in July 636. A week or two later, around mid July, the Byzantine army arrived. The Byzantine commander in chief, Vahan, sent Christian Arab troops of the Ghassanid king, Jabalah ibn al-Aiham, to check the strength of the Muslims. Khalid's mobile guard defeated and routed the Christian Arabs; this was the last action before the battle started. For the next month negotiations continued between the two armies, and Khalid went to meet Vahan in person at Byzantine camp. Meanwhile, the Muslims received reinforcements sent by Caliph Umar. Finally on 15 August, the Battle of Yarmouk was fought, it lasted for 6 days and ended in a devastating defeat for the Byzantines. The Battle of Yarmouk is considered to be one of the most decisive battles of history. It was the historic defeat that sealed the fate of Byzantines, the magnitude of defeat was so intense that Byzantine could never recover from it. It left whole of the Byzantine Empire vulnerable to the Muslims. The battle was the greatest battle ever fought on Syrian soil till then and was a tactical marvel of Abu Ubaidah. ===Capturing Jerusalem=== With the Byzantine army shattered and routed, the Muslims quickly recaptured the territory that they conquered prior to Yarmouk. Abu Ubaida held a meeting with his high command, including Khalid, to decide on future conquests. They decided to conquer Jerusalem. The Siege of Jerusalem lasted four months after which the city agreed to surrender, but only to caliph Umar in person. 'Amr ibn al-'As suggested that Khalid should be sent as caliph, because of his very strong resemblance to Umar. Khalid was recognized and eventually, Umar came and the Jerusalem surrendered on April 637. After Jerusalem, the Muslim armies broke up once again. Yazid's corps went to Damascus and captured Beirut. Amr and Shurahbil's corps went on to conquer the rest of Palestine, while Abu Ubaidah and Khalid, at the head of a 17,000 strong army moved north to conquer whole of the northern Syria. Abu Ubaida sent the commanders 'Amr ibn al-'As, Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan, and Shurahbil ibn Hassana back to their areas to reconquer them. Most of the areas submitted without a fight. Abu Ubaida himself, along with Khalid, moved to northern Syria once again to conquer them with a 17,000 strong army. Khalid along with his cavalry was sent to Hazir and Abu Ubaidah moved to Chalcis. ===Conquest of northern Syria=== Map detailing the route of Khalid ibn al-Walid's invasion of northern Syria. With Emesa already in hand, Abu Ubaidah and Khalid moved towards Chalcis, which was strategically the most significant Byzantine fort. Though Chalcis, the Byzantines would guard Anatolia, Heraclius's homeland Armenia and there the Asian zone's capital Antioch. Abu Ubaidah sent Khalid, with his elite cavalry, the mobile guard, towards Chalcis. The fort was guarded by the Greek troops under their commander, Menas, who was reported to be of high prestige, second only to the emperor himself. Menas, diverting from conventional Byzantine tactics, decided to face Khalid and destroy the leading elements of the Muslim army before the main body could join them at Hazir, east of Chalcis. This is known as the Battle of Hazir, which even forced Umar to praise Khalid's military genius. Umar is reported to have said: Abu Ubaidah soon joined Khalid at the virtually impregnable fort of Chalcis, which surrendered in June 637. With this strategic victory, the territory north of Chalcis lay open to the Muslims. Khalid and Abu Ubaidah continued their march northward and laid siege to Aleppo, which was captured after fierce resistance from desperate Byzantine troops in October 637. The next objective was the splendid city of Antioch, the capital of the Asian zone of the Byzantine Empire. Before marching towards Antioch, Khalid and Abu Ubaidah decided to isolate the city from Anatolia. Accordingly, they sent detachments north to eliminate all possible Byzantine forces and captured a garrison town, Azaz from Aleppo; from there the Muslims attacked Antioch on the eastern side. In order to save the empire from annihilation, a desperate battle was fought between the Muslim army and that of the defenders of Antioch, popularly known as Battle of Iron Bridge. The Byzantine army was composed of the survivors of Yarmouk and other Syrian campaigns. After being defeated, the Byzantines retreated to Antioch and the Muslims besieged the city. Having little hope of help from Emperor Herakleios, Antioch surrendered on 30 October 637, with the terms that all Byzantine troops would be given safe passage to Constantinople. Abu Ubaidah sent Khalid northwards, while he marched south and captured Lazkia, Jabla, Tartus and the coastal areas west of Anti-Lebanon mountains. Khalid moved north and raided territory up to the Kızıl River (Kızılırmak) in Anatolia. Emperor Heraclius had already left Antioch for Edessa before the arrival of the Muslims. He arranged for the necessary defenses in Al-Jazira and Armenia and left for his capital Constantinople. On his way to Constantinople he had a narrow escape when Khalid, after the capturing Marash, was heading south towards Munbij. Heraclius hastily took the mountainous path and, passing through the Cilician Gates, is reported to have said: With the devastating defeat at Yarmouk his empire was extremely vulnerable to Muslim invasion. With few military resources left he was no longer in a position to attempt a military come back in Syria. To gain time for the preparations of the defense of the rest of his empire, Heraclius needed the Muslims occupied in Syria. He sought help of the Christian Arabs of Al-Jazira who mustered up a large army and marched against Emesa, Abu Ubaidah's headquarters. Abu Ubaidah withdrew all his forces from northern Syria to Emesa, and the Christian Arabs laid siege to the city. Khalid was in favour of an open battle outside the fort, but Abu Ubaidah rather sent the matter to Umar, who handled it brilliantly. Umar sent detachments of the Muslim army from Iraq to invade Al-Jazira, homeland of the invading Christian Arabs, from three different routes. Moreover, another detachment was sent to Emesa from Iraq under Qa’qa ibn Amr, a veteran of Yarmouk who was sent to Iraq for the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah. Umar himself marched from Medina at the head of 1,000 men. The Christian Arabs, when they received the news of the Muslim invasion of their homeland, abandoned the siege and hastily withdrew to Al-Jazira. At this point Khalid and his mobile guard came out of the fort and devastated the army, attacking them from the rear. ===Campaigns in Armenia and Anatolia=== Map detailing the route of Khalid ibn al-Walid's invasion of Syria. After the battle Umar ordered the conquest of Al-Jazira, which was completed by late summer 638 A.D. Following the victory, Abu Ubaidah sent Khalid and Iyad ibn Ghanm (conqueror of Al- Jazira) to invade the Byzantine territory north of Al-Jazira. They marched independently and captured Edessa, Amida (Diyarbakır), Malatya and whole of Armenia up to Ararat and raided northern and central Anatolia. Heraclius has already abandoned all the forts between Antioch and Tartus to create a buffer zone or no man's land between Muslim controlled areas and mainland Anatolia. Umar for the time being stopped his armies from further invasion deeper into Anatolia but rather ordered Abu Ubaidah, now the governor of Syria, to consolidate his rule in Syria. At this point, Umar is reported to have said: Due to the dismissal of Khalid from the army and a famine and plague the next year, the Muslim armies were kept from invading Anatolia. The expedition to Anatolia and Armenia marked the end of the military career of Khalid. ==The great famine== Later that year Arabia fell into a severe drought, and large sums of people began to perish from hunger and epidemic diseases alike, both resulting from the drought and its complications. Therefore, countless numbers of people (in the hundreds of thousands), from throughout Arabia, gathered at Medina as food was being rationed. Soon, Medina's food reserves declined to alarming levels; by this time, Caliph Umar had already written to the governors of his provinces requesting any relevant aid they might assist with. One such letter was rushed to Abu Ubaidah, who responded promptly: True to his assurance, Abu Ubaidah's caravans of food supplies were the first to reach Medina, with 4,000 camels arriving full of food. To handle the overwhelming amount, Umar appointed Abu Ubaidah to distribute this among the thousands of people living in the outskirts of Medina. Following Abu Ubaidah's generous aid and efforts, Umar provided 4,000 dinars as a modest stipend or token of appreciation which, he refused on the grounds that the deed was done for the sake of God. ==Plague of 'Amwas== Nine months had passed since the drought and a new problem had started brewing. The plague epidemic broke in Syria and western Iraq; it was most severe in Syria. When the news of plague broke Umar had been on his way for a tour of Syria but, he returned from the Syrian border as advised by his companions. Abu Ubaidah met him there and said: Umar was shocked by this and said in sorrow: if only someone else would have said this other than you Abu Ubaidah and then said: Umar returned from Syria because Muhammad once instructed that one should not enter the place where an epidemic is unless it is absolutely safe. So Abu Ubaidah returned to his army at Emesa. It was then that a plague hit the land of Syria, the like of which people had never experienced before. It devastated the population. As Caliph Umar wanted to make Abu Ubaidah his successor he didn't want him to remain there in the epidemic region. Umar dispatched a messenger to Abu Ubaidah with a letter saying: When Abu Ubaydah received Umar's letter, he said, '\\"I know why Umar needs me. He wants to secure the survival of someone who, however, is not eternal.\\" So he wrote to Umar: When Caliph Umar read this letter tears filled his eyes and those who were with him asked, \\"Has Abu Ubaidah died?\\" he replied \\"No, but death is near to him.\\". Caliph Umar sent another messenger to him saying that if you are not coming back at least move to any highland with a less humid environment and Abu Ubaidah moved to Jabyia. Another reason why Abu Ubaydah did not leave Syria is because Muhammad once ordered that if a state is being hit by a plague, none from the state should escape and none from outside the state shall enter it (quarantine).Sahih Bukhari 624 ==Death== As soon as Abu Ubaidah moved to Jabyia he became afflicted with the plague. As death hung over him, he spoke to his army: He then appointed Muadh ibn Jabal as his successor and ordered him to lead people in prayers; after the prayers Muadh went to him and, at that moment, his soul departed. Muadh got up and said to the people: He died in 639 C.E. and was buried at Jabiya. It has been narrated that his janaza was led by Muadh bin Jabal. ==Legacy== His appearance was striking, slim and tall and his face was bright and he had a sparse beard. It was pleasing to look at him and refreshing to meet him. He was extremely courteous and humble and quite shy. Yet in a tough situation he would become strikingly serious and alert. He was given the title Amin or Custodian of Muhammad's community (Ummah). \`Abd Allah ibn \`Umar once said about him: He chose to live a simple way of life, opting for the most modest of garments when compared to some of the other sahaba (companions of Muhammad). When, during the conquest of Jerusalem, Caliph Umar had come to Syria, he was met by Khalid ibn al-Walid and Yazid bin abu Sufyan; Caliph Umar dismounted from his camel and threw sand at them while admonishing them that \\"it has not been even a year since you have come out of the hunger and hard life of Arabia and you have forgotten all the simplicity when you saw the glamour of Syria's Emperors?\\" Both men were incidentally wearing better garments then they were previously accustomed; Khalid ibn al-Walid noted that beneath their clothes they were still sufficiently armed, indicating they were still accustomed to the practical ways of hard desert life, bringing some relief to the Caliph. Comparatively, Abu Ubaidah was also present, but had always maintained his humble dressing and way of life; Umar was pleased to see him, and that very evening, when Umar arrived at his home, he saw that Abu Ubaidah, a man made successful in the art of battle (earning him rights to much booty), had no possessions at home except one bed, a sword and a shield. Umar said to him: Christians of the Levant accepted Islam and were greatly inspired by Abu Ubaidah; all members of the two Christian tribes, Banu Tanookh and Banu Saleej, had accepted Islam after the conquest of the city of Qasreen. Moreover, there was much relief given by Abu Ubaidah to the non-Muslims living as his subjects in Syria. He is regarded by Muslims to be one of the ten companions of Muhammad who were promised paradise by God during their lifetime.John Esposito, The Oxford Dictionary of Islam The Ubaydah Bin Al Jarrah Air Base near Kut, Iraq is named after him. ==Family== Little is known about Abu Ubaidah's family. He had two wives. From his wife Hind bint Jabar he had his son Yazid and Ubaidah. From his wife Warja he had his son Umair, but all of them died in childhood. It is unknown if he had any daughters, but his male line of descendants is reported to be ended. In spite of this, the Al- Jarrah family in present-day Aligarh (in Uttar Pradesh of India), Jordan and Lebanon claim their descent from Abu Ubaidah and the family of Alqayem who are known to be Palestinian ==See also== *Ali *Sa\`d ibn Abi Waqqas *Sunni view of the Sahaba *List of expeditions of Muhammad ==References== The Battle of Ajnadein ==External links== * Ameen ul Ummah Hazrat Abu Ubaidah Bin Jarrah * www.youngmuslims.ca * Abu Ubaidah Category:Companions of the Prophet Category:583 births Category:639 deaths Category:7th-century deaths from plague (disease) Category:Converts to Islam Category:Arab people of the Arab–Byzantine wars Category:7th-century Arabs Category:Generals of the Rashidun Caliphate Category:People of the Muslim conquest of the Levant Category:Quraysh Category:Rashidun governors of Syria Category:Sahabah hadith narrators ","title":"Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah"},{"id":"2564739","text":"DAAS, DaaS or Daas or may refer to: * Data as a Service (DaaS), a model of delivering dynamic data * Desktop as a service (DaaS): \\"desktop\\" virtualization in computing * Daas, a 2005 Indian Tamil romantic film * Daas (2011 film) * Dad's Army Appreciation Society * The Doug Anthony All Stars (stylized as D⋆A†A☭S), an Australian musical comedy group (1984–1994, 2014–present) * Ain Arnat Airport (ICAO: DAAS) in Algeria * The Arabic acronym for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ==See also== * DASS * Das ","title":"DAAS"},{"id":"2564742","text":"Zacconi is an Italian surname.

By 1969, Johnstone had secured regular work as a session musician, where he began to branch out and explore differing genres of music, and experiment with a variety of instruments. In 1970, when Lyell Tranter (one of the two guitarists in the acoustic British folk group Magna Carta) left the band, Johnstone took his place as a member. He recorded several albums with them beginning in 1970 on Seasons (1970), and continued to contribute to Songs from Wasties Orchard (1971) (named after the street where he lived in Long Hanborough, Oxfordshire), and a live album entitled In Concert. During his stint with Magna Carta, Johnstone played a wide variety of instruments including guitar, mandolin, sitar, and dulcimer. He also caught producer Gus Dudgeon's attention during this time – Dudgeon asking Johnstone to play on Bernie Taupin's eponymous 1971 solo album, which resulted in a meeting with Elton John and, ultimately, Johnstone's playing on John's 1971 album Madman Across the Water, after which he was invited to join Elton John's band as a full member. Previously, the Elton John Band consisted of John himself, bassist Dee Murray, and drummer Nigel Olsson. Johnstone's debut album with Elton John as a full- time member of his band was Honky Chateau, on which he played electric and acoustic guitars, slide guitar, banjo, and mandolin, and also sang backing vocals alongside Murray and Olsson. In 1972 he worked with Joan Armatrading and Pam Nestor on their Gus Dudgeon-produced debut album Whatever's for Us, playing acoustic and electric guitar on several tracks, and sitar on the song \\"Visionary Mountains\\". Johnstone released a solo album, Smiling Face, in 1973 through The Rocket Record Company and created a short-lived band called China that released an eponymous album in 1977. Even while playing alongside other artists such as Stevie Nicks, Meat Loaf and Alice Cooper during the late 1970s and early 1980s, Johnstone was never very far from Elton's projects and, following his reunion with original bandmates Nigel Olsson and Dee Murray full-time for 1982's \\"Jump Up\\" tour, has rarely been absent from an Elton John album track or tour. In 1990, Johnstone collaborated for the first time with lyricist Steve Trudell. With music and lyric in place, the two formed Warpipes, which included past and present Elton John band members Nigel Olsson on drums, Bob Birch on bass, Guy Babylon on keyboards, along with Billy Trudel as vocalist. In 1991, Warpipes released their only album, Holes in the Heavens, on the label Artful Balance Records. When Artful Balance Records folded, this album was re-released on Bridge Recordings. The album title was changed to simply \\"Warpipes\\" and the song line-up was altered slightly. In 1991, Johnstone produced Addison Steel's Stormy Blue in which he played guitar, mandolin, sitar, and banjo, and performed vocals. Co-producer Guy Babylon joined with keyboard arrangements, alongside drummer Nigel Olsson and Billy Trudell adding percussion and vocals respectively. In 1996, Johnstone released an instructional guitar video titled Davey Johnstone: Star Licks Master Sessions for Star Licks Productions, in which he plays a wide variety of John classics, joined by Billy Trudel on vocals and Bob Birch on bass. In 1997, while on tour with John, Johnstone and then Elton John bandmate and former Hellecasters guitarist John Jorgenson spent much of their off time creating Crop Circles, an album of acoustic instrumentation released in 1998. On 10 June 2009, Johnstone played a landmark 2000th show as a member of the Elton John Band at the SECC in Glasgow, Scotland. He is currently serving as John's musical director, in addition to his guitar work, playing along with Nigel Olsson and John Mahon; he also performed with Bob Birch before Birch's death in August 2012. In 2014, he played on \\"Belle Fleur\\" and \\"If You Were My Love\\" from Stevie Nicks' album 24 Karat Gold: Songs from the Vault. He knew Nicks from when he played guitar on several songs from her 1981 album Bella Donna. On October 1, 2019, Johnstone performed his 3000th show with Elton John at the first of two Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour stops at the SaskTel Centre in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. ==Personal life== Johnstone lives in Los Angeles with his wife.

Sierra On-Line struck a deal with Game Arts and had the game re-published for Europe and North America on DOS in 1990. In Zeliard, the player controls the knight Duke Garland, whose task is to save the Kingdom of Zeliard by destroying the evil overlord Jashiin, and recovering the Nine Tears of Esmesanti, magic jewels. ==Plot== An ancient demon, called Jashiin (and self-dubbed as the Emperor of Chaos), emerges from a two-thousand-year-old sleep to unleash his wrath upon the Kingdom of Zeliard. Justifying his actions as a revenge upon the ancient kings of Zeliard, Jashiin does so by causing a sand rain to continue for 115 days, turning the kingdom into desert; as well, he turns King Felishika's only daughter, the beautiful princess Felicia, into stone. The protagonist and player-controlled character, Duke Garland, is sent by the spirits to aid Zeliard and save Felicia. Duke Garland must recover the Nine Tears of Esmesanti, stolen by Jashiin from Felicia upon turning her to stone, for only these can reverse the stone curse. Subsequently, Duke Garland must also slay Jashiin. Finally, Garland may find safe haven in various cities and outposts not yet conquered by Jashiin, in order to rest and purchase weaponry and equipment. ==Gameplay== Zeliard is a fast-paced platform game. The gameplay can be divided into sections—in-town, and in-labyrinth. To complete the game, the player must pass through eight increasingly complex labyrinths, swarming with Jashiin's underlings. At the end of each Labyrinth, a boss dwells, holding one of the nine Tears; the final Tear is held by Jashiin himself. No combat takes place in towns, with the exception of an optional boss in a building in the town with the fire caverns. Towns usually exist on the borders of different labyrinths, although some are located in the middle, and one village is hidden. When in town, Garland can make use of banks, shops, sages and resting areas, provided he has adequate gold. Garland may also talk to the townsfolk in hope of getting useful information for his quest. The labyrinths are the combat space of the game. When in a labyrinth, Garland will have to make good use of his sword, shield, special items, and magic spells, in order to slay countless creatures, and progress to the next boss or town. The labyrinth area is divided into eight different sections, each with a unique appearance and containing unique monsters, and each having a different boss monster, guarding one of the Tears of Esmesanti jewels. Regular monsters inhabit each labyrinth, respawning each time Garland enters. When a monster is killed, it may drop an alma. Almas can be exchanged at banks for gold or with some NPCs for a quest item. Garland can die by taking excessive damage from close contact with monsters, their projectiles, or the natural environment such as hidden spikes or excessive temperatures. When dying, Garland will lose all his carried gold and half his carried almas, and be teleported back to the very first town in the game, having to go back to where he was before dying (which is usually easier than going there the first time, since the boss monsters are already dead, all the closed doors remain open, and special items acquired later in the game may be of use for quicker progression). ==Reception== ==References== ==External links== *ZeliardGame * * Category:1987 video games Category:DOS games Category:NEC PC-8801 games Category:Platform games Category:Game Arts games Category:Sharp X1 games Category:Sierra Entertainment games Category:Side-scrolling role-playing video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Metroidvania games ","title":"Zeliard"},{"id":"2564834","text":"Bather covered with mud at the Dead Sea Mud bathing in Miami Beach, Florida A mud bath is a bath of mud, commonly from areas where hot spring water can combine with volcanic ash. Mud baths have existed for thousands of years, and can be found now in high-end spas in many countries of the world. Mud baths come from many sources: *lakes (e.g. Lake Techirghiol in Romania and Käina Bay in Estonia) *saltwater sea (e.g. Dead Sea in Jordan and Israel) *hot springs (e.g. Calistoga, Napa Valley, California) *mud volcano (e.g. Tiga Island, Malaysia, El Totumo, Colombia) Mud baths in the United States are mostly found at the resorts in California and Miami Beach, Florida. The mud is a combination of local volcanic ash, imported Canadian peat and naturally heated mineral waters. Historically, the mud bath treatment has been used for centuries in Eastern and Western European spas as a way to relieve arthritis. In Romania, Lake Techirghiol is famous for treatments with mud baths. The lake's hypersaline environment is due to the successive evaporation of sea water that remained in its basin after a tectono-erosive phase exhaustion created a fluvial-marine firth and the lake's connection to the sea closed. The accumulation of salts in the water is also a result of a semiarid climate with higher temperatures in summer, leading to pronounced evaporation. The lake's higher salinity (83.6 g/l in 1970, and 63.6 gl/l in 1980), in spite of a decrease over time, has been a bottleneck in the selection of the lake animal and plant species. In Italy, in Lido delle Nazioni at Ferrara offers mud bath therapies. It is claimed that the treatment, which is founded on contact with bromine salt water, has anti-inflammatory, detoxifying, analgesic, relaxing and revitalizing properties. == See also == \\"Mud bathing site\\" (according to the sign) on Bulgaria's Lake Atanasovsko * Balneotherapy * Bath salts * Heubad * Mud wrap * Peloid * Wallowing in animals ==References== Category:Medicinal clay Category:Bathing ","title":"Mud bath"},{"id":"2564847","text":"ReserveAmerica, owned by Aspira, is a product that provides online campsite reservations and license processing for federal, state, provincial, private, and local government parks, campgrounds, and conservation agencies in North America.

For example, the orthogonal trajectories of a pencil of concentric circles are the lines through their common center (see diagram). Suitable methods for the determination of orthogonal trajectories are provided by solving differential equations. The standard method establishes a first order ordinary differential equation and solves it by separation of variables. Both steps may be difficult or even impossible. In such cases one has to apply numerical methods. Orthogonal trajectories are used in mathematics for example as curved coordinate systems (i.e. elliptic coordinates) or appear in physics as electric fields and their equipotential curves. If the trajectory intersects the given curves by an arbitrary (but fixed) angle, one gets an isogonal trajectory. == Determination of the orthogonal trajectory == === In cartesian coordinates === Generally one assumes, that the pencil of curves is implicitly given by an equation :(0) :\\\\ F(x,y,c)=0,\\\\qquad 1\\\\. example :\\\\ x^2+y^2-c=0\\\\ ,\\\\qquad 2\\\\. example y=cx^2 \\\\ \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\ y-cx^2=0 \\\\ , where c is the parameter of the pencil. If the pencil is given explicitly by an equation y=f(x,c), one can change the representation into an implicit one: y-f(x,c)=0. For the consideration below it is supposed that all necessary derivatives do exist. ;Step 1. Differentiating implicitly for x yields :(1) :\\\\ F_x(x,y,c)+F_y(x,y,c)\\\\;y'=0,\\\\qquad in 1. example :\\\\ 2x+2yy'=0\\\\ ,\\\\qquad 2\\\\. example :\\\\ y'-2cx=0\\\\ . ;Step 2. Now it is assumed, that equation (0) can be solved for parameter c, which can thus be eliminated from equation (1). One gets the differential equation of first order :(2) :\\\\ y'=f(x,y), \\\\qquad in 1. example :\\\\ y'=-\\\\frac{x}{y}\\\\ ,\\\\qquad 2\\\\. example :\\\\ y'=2\\\\frac{y}{x} \\\\ , which is fulfilled by the given pencil of curves. ;Step 3. Because the slope of the orthogonal trajectory at a point (x,y) is the negative multiplicative inverse of the slope of the given curve at this point, the orthogonal trajectory satisfies the differential equation of first order :(3) : \\\\ y'=-\\\\frac{1}{f(x,y)}\\\\ , \\\\qquad in 1. example :\\\\ y'=y/x\\\\ , \\\\qquad 2\\\\. example :\\\\ y'=-\\\\frac{x}{2y} \\\\ . ;Step 4. This differential equation can (hopefully) be solved by a suitable method. For both examples separation of variables is suitable. The solutions are: in example 1, the lines y=mx,\\\\ m\\\\in \\\\R and in example 2, the ellipses x^2+2y^2=d,\\\\ d>0\\\\ . === In polar coordinates === If the pencil of curves is represented implicitly in polar coordinates by :(0p) :\\\\ F(r,\\\\varphi,c)=0 one determines, alike the cartesian case, the parameter free differential equation :(1p) :\\\\ F_r(r,\\\\varphi,c)+F_\\\\varphi(r,\\\\varphi,c)\\\\;\\\\varphi'=0,\\\\qquad :(2p) :\\\\ \\\\varphi'=f(r,\\\\varphi) of the pencil. The differential equation of the orthogonal trajectories is than (see Redheffer & Port p. 65, Heuser, p. 120) :(3p) :\\\\ \\\\varphi'=-\\\\frac{1}{{\\\\color{red}r^2}f(r,\\\\varphi)}\\\\ . Orthogonal cardioids Example: Cardioids: :(0p) :\\\\ F(r,\\\\varphi,c)=r-c(1+\\\\cos\\\\varphi)=0,\\\\ c>0\\\\ .\\\\ (in diagram: blue) :(1p) :\\\\ F_r(r,\\\\varphi,c)+F_\\\\varphi(r,\\\\varphi,c)\\\\;\\\\varphi'=1+c\\\\sin\\\\varphi\\\\;\\\\varphi'=0,\\\\qquad Elimination of c yields the differential equation of the given pencil: :(2p) :\\\\ \\\\varphi'=-\\\\frac{1+\\\\cos\\\\varphi}{r\\\\sin\\\\varphi} Hence the differential equation of the orthogonal trajectories is: :(3p) :\\\\ \\\\varphi'=\\\\frac{\\\\sin\\\\varphi}{r(1+\\\\cos\\\\varphi)} After solving this differentialequation by separation of variables one gets :r=d(1-\\\\cos\\\\varphi)\\\\ ,\\\\ d>0 \\\\ , which describes the pencil of cardioids (red in diagram), symmetric to the given pencil. == Isogonal trajectory == * A curve, which intersects any curve of a given pencil of (planar) curves by a fixed angle \\\\alpha is called isogonal trajectory. Between the slope \\\\eta' of an isogonal trajectory and the slope y' of the curve of the pencil at a point (x,y) the following relation holds: : \\\\eta'=\\\\frac{y'+\\\\tan(\\\\alpha)}{1-y'\\\\tan(\\\\alpha)}\\\\ . This relation is due to the formula for \\\\tan(\\\\alpha+\\\\beta). For \\\\alpha \\\\rightarrow 90^\\\\circ one gets the condition for the orthogonal trajectory. For the determination of the isogonal trajectory one has to adjust the 3. step of the instruction above: ;3. step (isog. traj.) The differential equation of the isogonal trajectory is: *(3i) : \\\\ y'=\\\\frac{f(x,y)+\\\\tan(\\\\alpha)}{1-f(x,y)\\\\; \\\\tan(\\\\alpha)}\\\\ . Isogonal trajectories of concentric circles for \\\\alpha=45^\\\\circ For the 1. example (concentric circles) and the angle \\\\alpha=45^\\\\circ one gets :(3i) : \\\\ y'=\\\\frac{-x/y+1}{1+x/y}\\\\ . This is a special kind of differential equation, which can be transformed by the substitution z=y/x into a differential equation, that can be solved by separation of variables. After reversing the substitution one gets the equation of the solution: :\\\\arctan\\\\frac{y}{x}+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ln(x^2+y^2)=C\\\\ . Introducing polar coordinates leads to the simple equation :C-\\\\varphi=\\\\ln(r)\\\\ , which describes logarithmic spirals (s. diagram). == Numerical methods == In case that the differential equation of the trajectories can not be solved by theoretical methods, one has to solve it numerically, for example by Runge–Kutta methods. == See also == *Cassini oval *Confocal conic sections *Trajectory *Apollonian circles, pairs of families of circles that are all orthogonal to each other == References == * A.

He was a marked man in Iran, because of his support for democracy and human rights and his opposition to the Iranian government. He has resided in Los Angeles, California ever since. While in Iran he was the Editor of the \\"Hamkari\\" Magazine for 2 years, Editor of Kargaran(Workers) Magazine for 3 years,Associate Editor of the daily \\"Bamdad\\" (morning) Newspaper for two years. His famous interviews were with: Sadegh Ghotbzadeh,Sadegh Khalkhali, Ahmad Khomeini(the son of Ayatollah Khomeini),Ayatollah Shariatmadari, Ayatollah Sadegh Rohani, Yasser Arafat and President of Pakistan General Zia ul haq. == Interpol Arrest Warrant == According to the Iranian government, Mr. Homayoun \\"encouraged his audience to engage in acts of terrorism against the Islamic government such as writing slogans (on walls) and resisting the security forces.\\" Independent observers accuse the Iranian government of using Interpol to target political dissidents abroad. Despite Interpol's \\"Red Notice\\" against Homayoun however, The Federal Bureau of Investigation has assured him that he would be safe as long as he remains in the United States. == Activities == Homayoun has established a Persian satellite TV network based in Los Angeles that broadcasts 24/7 into Iran.

Abbas Pahlevan, Dr. Danesh Foroughi, Dr. Hassan Rahnavardi and Dr. Manouchehr Ganji. He has also started the Ma Hastim movement which, according to some analysts, has had a \\"significant influence on Iranian masses\\" as can be seen by the \\"numerous slogans\\" written on Iran's city walls in its support. He organized alongside other political organizations daily demonstrations in Los Angeles during the 2009 Green Movement in Iran. His TV station and Ma Hastim were instrumental in keeping the Los Angeles demonstrations going strong those days and also provided the western media with all the news coming out of Iran during those days. Recently the Ma Hastim movement, funded by its supporters, built a symbolic cemetery in New York City containing symbolic graves and tombstones of Iranian dissidents and political activists, such as Neda Agha Soltan, killed by the Iranian government since 2009. == Views == Homayoun supports Iranian/Persian nationalism and has been instrumental in keeping the rightful/historical flag of Iran the \\"Lion and Sun\\" flying high. This historical flag is what differentiates between the Islamic Republic's opposition and its cronies.

Early on al-Samh captured Barcelona, and also Narbonne (720), extinguishing the vestigial Visigothic kingdom there after leading an Umayyad incursion into current southern France. Besides the above Narbonne, the Arab commander went on to lead a large Arab army into the rest of Visigothic Septimania, besieging a number of towns and cities including Béziers, Agde, Lodève, Maguelonne (Montpellier) and Nîmes. ==Siege and defeat at Toulouse== After setting up his headquarters in Narbonne, military moves took an unexpected turn when Al-Samh returned to Muslim Iberia to gather more Arab-Berber troops prior to attacking the strongly defended Aquitanian capital city of Toulouse. While the ultimate reasons remain obscure, it has been argued that Odo provided shelter to Visigothic elites and population fleeing the theater of war around the eastern Pyrenees. Al-Samh returned to Septimania and on to southeastern Aquitaine with a massive army, siege engines, infantry, horsemen and mercenaries. The siege of Toulouse, with its near-impregnable walls, lasted until early summer. The defenders, short of provisions, were close to breaking when, around June 9, 721, Odo the Great, the duke of Aquitaine, returned at the head of a large Aquitanian and Frankish force, attacking al-Samh's rear and launching a highly successful encircling movement. A major, decisive battle ensued. Caught between the Toulouse defenders and Eudes's men, al-Samh tried to break out, but was trapped with the bulk of his troops in a place that came to be called by Muslim chroniclers Balat al Shuhada ('the path of the martyrs') where he made a determined last stand as his army was decimated by Odo's forces. Al-Samh himself was critically wounded, and died shortly afterwards in Narbonne. ==Notes== Category:Arab generals Category:8th-century Arabs Category:8th century in France Category:8th-century rulers in Europe Category:721 deaths Category:Umayyad governors of al-Andalus Category:Generals of the Umayyad Caliphate Category:Year of birth unknown Category:8th-century Umayyad people ","title":"Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani"},{"id":"2564875","text":"The Other Final is a 2003 documentary film, directed by Johan Kramer of Dutch communications agency KesselsKramer, about a football match between Bhutan and Montserrat, who were, at that time, the two lowest ranked teams in the FIFA World Rankings. The game was played in the Changlimithang Stadium, Thimphu, Bhutan on the same day as the 2002 FIFA World Cup Final. Bhutan won the game 4–0, their first ever victory and also the first time they had kept a clean sheet in any match. The friendly match, officially sanctioned by FIFA, saw Bhutan rise out of the bottom two of the world rankings and kept Montserrat in last place. The referee was Englishman Steve Bennett. ==Background== In 2002, Montserrat were ranked last in the world FIFA rankings, with Bhutan ranked second to last. Prior to their meeting, Bhutan, who first competed in 1982, had never won an official match (although they had one single victory over Tibet, who are not FIFA members so the match was not officially sanctioned), whilst Montserrat, who made their debut in 1950, had only managed two victories, both against Anguilla in the 1995 Caribbean Cup, in their entire history. Additionally, financial constraints and a slump in the popularity of the game in the 1980s and 1990s had impacted the development of the national team in Bhutan, as well as the fact that the low level of facilities in the country had prevented the team from even attempting to qualify for the FIFA World Cup. Montserrat had also suffered their own very significant misfortune when the Soufrière Hills volcano erupted, causing widespread devastation to the island. Seismic activity had occurred in 1897–1898, 1933–1937, and again in 1966–1967, but the eruption that began on 18 July 1995 was the first since the 16th century in Montserrat. When pyroclastic flows and mudflows began occurring regularly, the national capital, Plymouth, was evacuated, and a week later a pyroclastic flow buried the city under several metres of debris. The British navy ship took a large role in evacuating Montserrat's population to other islands; this included Antigua and Barbuda, who warned they would not be able to cope with many more refugees. About 7,000 people, or two-thirds of the whole population, fled Montserrat; 4,000 of those to the United Kingdom. These catastrophic events understandably had a major impact on football in Montserrat and the team did not compete at all for four years. When they returned they had to play all of their matches away from Montserrat after the eruptions had destroyed not merely the only football stadium of an international standard, but rendered half the entire island uninhabitable. At the same time, with the Netherlands having failed to qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, two Dutch ad-agency partners, Johan Kramer and Matthijs de Jongh, not having their home team to cheer on, pondered who the worst national team in the world might be. With Bhutan and Montserrat so close to each other at the bottom of the FIFA rankings, they set out to arrange a match between the two nations. The match was not as easily arranged as might initially be thought. Firstly, this match was being arranged by private individuals rather than by the relevant football federations during a normal international fixture window. Both sides thought that the idea was unrealistic in the beginning, and officials from both federations thought the initial suggestion of the match was merely a joke and had little knowledge of each other's countries. Johan Kramer said that he thought Montserrat were willing to agree to the friendly and to travel all the way to Bhutan because their government felt that the publicity from the match would at least counterbalance the depressing reports about the recent serious volcanic eruptions on the island. Three weeks prior to the match, Dutch coach Arie Schans flew out to Bhutan to take temporary charge of the side and took four hour long daily training sessions with the team in order to prepare them for the match. There was a considerable deal of anticipation in Thimphu prior to the game, though the Bhutan Football Federation sought to play down the importance of victory, saying it was more important to focus on participation than winning. However, both sets of players were very much focused on getting a result; veteran Bhutan striker Dinesh Chhetri said that Bhutan would win by at least two goals to nil, whereas Montserrat midfielder Antoine Lake-Willix thought his team would win comfortably 3–0. ==Match report== The game started strongly for Montserrat who attacked quickly, and Bhutan struggled during early exchanges. However, initial nerves were settled after only five minutes when Wangay Dorji headed a goal to give Bhutan an early lead. Encouraged, this gave Bhutan the momentum to press on, but their finishing was lax and they were unable to convert the few chances they created. Montserrat were able to keep Bhutan at bay for the rest of the half and the game remained at 1–0 until well past the hour mark when referee, Steve Bennett awarded Bhutan a freekick. Dorji stepped up and scored his second of the game. The momentum remained with Bhutan and veteran forward Dinesh Chhetri scored a third, before Dorji took full advantage of a rapidly tiring Montserrat team to complete his hat trick and seal a decisive 4–0 victory, Bhutan's first victory on the international stage against any opposition, indeed, their first ever positive result of any kind, and the first time they had ever kept a clean sheet. With the benefit of hindsight, even with a physical height advantage, it seemed unlikely that Montserrat would be able to put up much of a fight for long, struggling as a team with the lack of oxygen at high altitude (the game was played at 7,500 ft above sea level) and in truth they rarely troubled the Bhutan goal, having only one shot of note, which Vladimir Farrell fired straight at the Bhutan goalkeeper. A crowd of 15,000 watched the game, which followed an hour long dance program designed to showcase the Buddhist traditions of the country. ==Awards== The Other Final claimed two awards: * Avignon Film Festival's best documentary (2003) * Bermuda International Film Festival – Documentary Prize – Special Mention (2003) ==References== ==External links== * Category:2000s documentary films Category:2002 in Caribbean football Category:2003 films Category:International association football matches Category:Documentary films about association football Category:Dutch documentary films Category:Dutch films Category:Films set in Bhutan Category:Films shot in Bhutan Category:Montserrat national football team Category:Bhutan national football team Category:2002 in Bhutanese football Category:Dutch sports films Category:June 2002 sports events in Asia ","title":"The Other Final"},{"id":"2564876","text":" USS Colhoun (DD-801), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Rear Admiral Edmund Colhoun (1821–1897). Colhoun was launched 10 April 1944 by Todd-Pacific Shipbuilding Corp., Seattle, Washington; sponsored by Captain K. K. Johnson, WAC; and commissioned 8 July 1944, Commander G. R. Wilson in command. ==Service history== Colhoun arrived at Pearl Harbor 10 October 1944 for training and patrol duty. Arriving off Iwo Jima 19 February 1945, she screened transports, served as radar picket and gave fire support for the invasion of Iwo Jima. On 1 March, she was hit by a salvo from heavy enemy batteries ashore, which killed one man and injured 16. After repairs at Saipan, Colhoun sailed for Okinawa, arriving 31 March for radar picket duty. At 1530 on 6 April 1945, during the first heavy kamikaze raid of the battle of Okinawa, Colhoun received a request for help from USS Bush and sped to her aid. Interposing her guns between Bush and the attacking suicide planes, Colhoun downed three planes before a kamikaze crashed into the mount scattering flaming wreckage across the ship and dropping a bomb into the aft fireroom where it exploded. Retaining power and using emergency steering, Colhoun awaited the next attacking trio, shooting down the first two while the third struck her on the starboard side. The bomb from the second kamikaze exploded, breaking Colhouns keel, piercing both boilers, ripping a hole below the waterline, and starting oil and electrical fires. Operating the remaining guns manually, the crew gamely faced yet another wave of three attackers shooting down one and damaging another, while the third kamikaze struck her aft section. This airplane's bomb bounced overboard and exploded, adding another hole to allow more flooding. Colhoun valiantly struggled to stay afloat, but a final kamikaze crashed into the bridge in a mass of flames. At 1800, took off all but a skeleton crew, which remained onboard while a tug attempted to tow Colhoun to Okinawa. Heavy listing, uncontrolled flooding, and fires made it impossible to save her, and she was sunk by gunfire from at .

Briefly, its main points were: # The history of Argentina is described as the struggle between popular, progressive ideals against a backward oligarchy. # Economy is considered as a medium to obtain higher ends, collective and individual. #Referring to the agrarian problem, it is said that the land should be for the people that work it, either individually or collectively owned. It should not be used for business that speculates with it. #All national resources should be nationalized. All sources of natural energy, public companies and international and national monopolies that prevent the economic development of the county will be nationalized, and their control given to the nation, provinces or cities. #The state will defend all small companies that are independent. It will also assure that no barriers will be set up to stop the economic activity. #The industrial development will be global, and it will not be based on low wages. #The internal problems of the party will be solved, the objective is to unify it under its doctrine as well as appealing to individuals that are known to be capable of following the objectives proposed. #This declaration rejects any pact with other political forces.

S. Cozzens and published in Harper's Weekly, December 1882. Careening (also known as \\"heaving down\\") is the practice of grounding a sailing vessel at high tide, in order to expose one side of its hull for maintenance and repairs below the water line when the tide goes out. ==Practice== The process could be assisted by securing a top halyard to a fixed object, such as a tree or rock, to pull the mast over as far as possible. Maintenance might include repairing damage caused by dry rot or cannon shot, tarring the exterior to reduce leakage (caulking), or removing biofouling organisms, such as barnacles, to increase the ship's speed. One exotic method was the ancient practice of beaching a ship on a shingle beach with the goal of using wave action and the shingle to scour the hull or side of the ship. A beach favoured for careening was called a careenage. Today, only small vessels are careened, while large vessels are placed in dry dock. Louis Le Breton's depiction of the French corvettes Astrolabe and Zélée, under Dumont d'Urville, performing a careening at Torres Strait. A related practice was a Parliamentary heel, in which the vessel was heeled over in deep water, by shifting weight, such as ballast or guns, to one side. In this way the upper sides could be cleaned or repaired with minimal delay. Famously, HMS Royal George was lost while undergoing a Parliamentary heel in 1782. Pirates would often careen their ships because they had no access to drydocks. A secluded bay would suffice for necessary repairs or hull cleaning, and such little \\"safe havens\\" could be found throughout the islands in the Caribbean and nearly around the world. One group of islands, Tres Marias in Panama, became popular after Francis Drake had sailed there in 1579, and they quickly became a popular place for piracy. == See also == * Biofouling * Refitting of boats * Warping (sailing) == References == Category:Nautical terminology ","title":"Careening"},{"id":"2564888","text":"A Honda Super Cub engine. The most popular motorcycle in history, with over 100 million produced. A motorcycle engine is an engine that powers a motorcycle. Motorcycle engines are typically two-stroke or four-stroke internal combustion engines, but other engine types, such as Wankels and electric motors, have been used. Although some mopeds, such as the VéloSoleX, had friction drive to the front tire, a motorcycle engine normally drives the rear wheel, power being sent to the driven wheel by belt, chain or shaft. Historically, some 2,000 units of the Megola were produced between 1921–1925 with front wheel drive,Revoluntionary eccentricities: A survey of the rotary engine over the years. Motorcycle Sport, April 1983, pp.166-171, p.188 Accessed February 2019 and the modern Rokon, an all terrain motorcycle with both wheels driven, has been produced since 1960.About Rokon rokon.com Retrieved February 2019 Most engines have a gearbox with up to six ratios. Reverse gear is occasionally found on heavy tourers, for example the Honda GL1600, and sidecar motorcycles, such as the Ural. The rider changes gears on most motorcycles using a foot-pedal and manual clutch, but early models had hand-levers. More recently, some have automatic or semi-automatic gearboxes. Outside the United States, engine capacities typically ranged from about 50 cc to 650 cc; but in Europe since 1968 motorcycles with larger capacities have become common, ranging as high as the Triumph Rocket 3's engine. In the United States, V-twin engined-motorcycles with capacities of 850 cc or more have been the norm since the 1920s. ==History== Michaux-Perreaux, Roper and other steam cycles were rescued from obscurity, and the stories of the early steam cycle experiments were rediscovered. There were no steam motorcycles in 1818, but there soon would be. The first motorcycles were powered by steam engines. The earliest example is the French Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede of 1868. This was followed by the American Roper steam velocipede of 1869, and a number of other steam powered two and three wheelers, manufactured and sold to the public on through the early 20th century. Using frames based both on the earlier boneshaker and the later—and in many ways completely modern—safety bicycle design, these early steam motorcycles experimented with a variety of engine placement strategies, as well as transmission and options. While today nearly every motorcycle has its engine in the center of the frame; this became standard only around 1900-1910 after nearly every possible engine location was tried. The origins of the scooter engine arrangement (including the shaft drive) can be traced back to the 19th century but the current layout became generally adopted after the Great War. The modern equivalent became universally popular in the 1950s and remains much the same today. The Otto cycle gasoline internal combustion engine was first used on an experimental two-wheeler created by Gottlieb Daimler to test the practicality of such an engine in a vehicle. This motorcycle, the Daimler Reitwagen, is credited as the world's first motorcycle by many authorities, partially on the assumption that a motorcycle is defined not as any two-wheel motor vehicle, but a two- wheel internal combustion engine motor vehicle. The Oxford English Dictionary, for example, defines the word motorcycle this way. The steam cycles were also simply neglected and forgotten by many historians, even as the Michaux- Perreaux waited forty years on display in the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu. In recent years, a surge in interest in clean energy has put many new electric powered two wheelers on the market, and they are registered as motorcycles or scooters, without the type of powerplant being an issue. Diesel motorcycles were also experimented with briefly in the 20th century, and are again the subject of interest due to fuel economy and the needs of military logistics. The USMC has ordered a new diesel motorcycle, the M1030 M1, that can use the same fuel, JP-8, as the rest of their armored vehicles, aircraft, cars and trucks. The overwhelming majority of the motorcycles produced and used in the world today have small displacement air-cooled single-cylinder engines, both two- and four-strokes. In the wealthier parts of the world, Europe and Japan, larger displacements and multiple cylinders are common alongside small- displacement bikes required by various licensing and rider experience requirements, and so a very diverse range of sizes, cylinder numbers, configurations, and cooling systems are seen on the road. Many developed countries have graduated licensing, where a rider is licensed for a period of time to ride only smaller-displacement motorcycles before being allowed to ride larger ones. In the United States, there are no such mandates, and so the mix is skewed even further to the largest displacements, consumer demand drives manufacturers to offer their largest motorcycles to that country, and to export far fewer sub- models to the American market. ==Types== Almost all production motorcycles have gasoline internal combustion engines. Both four- stroke and two-stroke engines are used, but strict emission laws have led to far fewer two-strokes. A few have used Wankel rotary engines, but no Wankel bikes are currently in production. Motorcycle engines can be air cooled or liquid cooled, and optionally include oil cooling as well. Some scooters use batteries and an electric motor. The 2009 TT races introduced a new category 'TTX' (renamed as TT Zero) for electric bikes using fuel-cells or batteries. Motorcycle engines can be mounted transversely; with the crankshaft aligned perpendicular to the frame or longitudinally, with the crankshaft parallel to the frame. Motorcycles with transversely mounted engines are more suited to have chain or belt final-drive. Motorcycles with longitudinally mounted engines are more suited for shaft final-drive. Motor scooters often have the engine as part of the rear suspension, so the engine is not fixed rigidly to the main frame. Instead, the combined engine-transmission-swingarm assembly is pivoted to follow the road surface and is part of the \\"unsprung weight\\". The chain final-drive of scooters runs in an oil-bath within the engine casings. \\"Step-through\\" motorcycles may have a rigidly fixed engine, or may have a scooter-type arrangement. ==Two-stroke and four-stroke== Two-stroke engines have fewer moving parts than four-stroke engines, and produce twice the number of power strokes per revolution. Fuel economy is better in four-strokes due to more complete combustion of the intake charge in four-stroke engines. Nevertheless, two-strokes have been largely replaced on motorcycles in developed nations due to their environmental disadvantages. Cylinder lubrication is necessarily total-loss and this inevitably leads to a smokey exhaust, particularly on wide throttle openings. Two-stroke-engined motorcycles continue to be made in large numbers, but mostly off-road motocross low-power mopeds, small scooters and step-through underbones where they still compete strongly with four-strokes (including the highest-selling motorcycle of all time, the 50 cc Honda Super Cub). The major markets of two- stroke motorcycles are in dirt bikes and developing nations. ==Cylinder heads (four-stroke)== Cylinder head design has a significant effect on the efficiency of combustion, and hence the power output of the engine. The head may be flat, in which case the combustion chamber resides within the cylinder and/or a depression in the piston crown, but usually a \\"dome\\" within the cylinder head provides most of the combustion volume. Motorcycles use poppet valves in a range of designs: side valve, overhead valve (OHV) with pushrod operation, overhead cam (SOHC), and double overhead cam (DOHC). A cylinder with desmodromic valves may have three or even four camshafts. An OHC or DOHC cylinder head will have at least two valves per cylinder (1 inlet and 1 exhaust), but multi-valve engines may have three (2 inlet and 1 exhaust), or four (2 inlet and 2 exhaust), or even five (3 inlet and 2 exhaust). Cylinder heads are the hottest part of the engine and require adequate cooling, typically air cooling, oil cooling or liquid cooling. Some motorcycles such as Harley-Davidsons, Moto Guzzis and BMWs become identifiable by their cylinder- head types, namely airhead, panhead, oilhead, and even knucklehead. The Ducati desmos head enables higher rpm to be achieved without detrimental valve float also known as valve bounce. ==Valve control in four-strokes== In a side-valve engine, the valves are operated from the \\"underhead\\" cam without special valve gear. Overhead valve (OHV) engines have valves operated by pushrods. Single- and double-overhead camshaft (SOHC and DOHC, respectively) engines have overhead camshafts typically operated by chain, belt, gear train or bevel gear drive. The earliest motorcycle engines had exhaust valves operated in the same way as a side-valve engine, but they had overhead intake valves held closed by a weak spring. The intake valve was opened by the suction caused by the intake stroke. As the need for mechanical control of the intake valve arose, the design was modified by adding another cam to the camshaft and using a pushrod and rocker arm to operate the intake valve. Honda equipped the CBR400F with REV, described as \\"revolution responding type valve pausing mechanism\\", in 1983. This system enabled switching over the number of valve operations per cylinder between low and medium speed revolution range and high speed revolution range. In 2002, Honda introduced HYPER VTEC in the VFR800 Interceptor. In 2006, Kawasaki introduced VVT in the Concours 14. ==Unit construction== Engines and gearboxes were originally separate items, the gearbox being driven by a \\"primary chain\\". Later designs combined the two elements into a single \\"unit construction\\". Some manufacturers, such as Norton and Enfield continued with \\"pre-unit\\" construction until recently, and Harley- Davidson still makes pre-unit engines today. In the early 1960s, BSA introduced new short-stroke unit construction 500 and 650 cc parallel twins to replace their existing pre-unit long-stroke engines. Triumph modified their large pre-unit 500 and 650 cc parallel twins into unit-construction engines. The smaller Triumph 350 and 500 cc twins had been unit construction from their introduction in 1957. The decision by Lucas to discontinue making dynamos and magnetos, and to produce only alternators and coil ignition systems, was a significant factor in forcing the redesign. Traditionally, engines and gearboxes had separate lubrication systems with different grades of oil; but modern practice is to use the same oil for both. ==Cylinders and configuration== The majority of motorcycle engines are configured as singles, parallel twins, triples, fours and sixes; and all these may be inline or transverse. Vee engines include V-twins and V-fours, and horizontally opposed engines include flat-twins, flat-fours and flat-sixes. Wankel engines are either single-rotor or twin-rotor. Bigger bikes tend to have more cylinders for smoothness and increased power. Modern singles range in capacity from 50 cc to 660 cc, twins from 175 cc to 1,800 cc, triples from 380 cc to 2,300 cc, and so on. ===Single=== 1960 BSA Gold Star Single-cylinder engines ( \\"singles\\" or \\"thumpers\\") have the cylinder vertical, inclined or horizontal, the last type most common in step-through motorcycles. Single-cylinder engines require both a larger flywheel and a heavier-duty gearbox than multicylinder engines. Small singles are cheap to build and maintain and are suitable as cheap utility motorcycles. Until the mid-1960s, road-racing machines, like the UK's Matchless, AJS and Norton, tended to be large singles, but since then multicylinder racers have become the norm. Off-road and smaller dual-sport bikes tend to use single-cylinder engines. The simplicity of these engines, often relying on a single carburetor, make them relatively easy to maintain and repair in remote locations with few tools. Compared to lightweight off- road singles, the modern category of heavier off-road adventure bikes tend to forgo such simplicity, and instead have larger and more powerful parallel- twin, flat-twin, or V-twin engines. ===Twin=== ;Straight-twin 1962 Honda CB77 Superhawk twin engine. Starting with Edward Turner's 1937 Triumph Speed Twin design, and until the mid-1970s, the parallel-twin was the most common British motorcycle type. Parallel-twins are usually mounted transversely, with the cylinders side by side above the crankshaft, and with exhaust pipes at the front, in the cool airstream. Longitudinal, or inline, twins include the 500 cc Sunbeam S7 and S8. There are three crankshaft configurations for this engine: 360°, 180°, and the newer 270°. Parallel twins usually have only two main bearings. ;V-twin Harley-Davidson Sportster V-twin In a V-twin engine the cylinders form a \\"V\\" around the crankshaft. A Vee-angle of 90°, as used by Ducati and Moto Guzzi, can give perfect primary and secondary balance, with a pleasingly irregular firing order. A lesser angle gives a more compact motor, but one which is prone to vibration, such as 42° (Indian), 45° (Harley- Davidson), 52° Honda, and 60° (Aprilia). Most V-twins have a single crankpin shared by side-by-side connecting rods so that the cylinders are slightly offset, but a variation is to have a single crankpin with \\"fork & blade\\" con- rods, to keep the cylinders in line. Non-90° V-twins may have offset crankpins to try to reduce vibration. V-twins may be mounted either longitudinally with the cylinders protruding either side, like the Honda CX500 and Moto Guzzi, or transversely, such as Harley-Davidson, Ducati, or Aprilia. V-twin Design Engineering (Retrieved 26 November 2006) Transverse V-twins can raise difficulties in cooling the aft cylinder, and in siting the airbox, battery, aft carburetor, and aft exhaust pipe. ;Flat-twin BMW's opposed twin on a 1954 R68 In a flat-twin, or boxer, engine the cylinders are horizontally opposed. The boxer has perfect primary balance, and only a small rocking couple, and unlike a V-twin, regular firing intervals, producing very low vibration levels, without the use of counterbalance shafts. They are usually mounted with a longitudinal crankshaft, with the cylinders protruding into the airstream, so that a flat-twin can satisfactorily be air-cooled. Flat-twins are made by BMW and Ural and historically by Douglas, Marusho, and Hoffmann, among others. The longitudinal mounting makes the flat twin highly suitable for shaft final drive. Some early motorcycles used transverse-crank flat twin engines, especially Douglas motorcycles before World War II. ;Tandem twin The Tandem Twin where the cylinders are longitudinal, and have two cranks geared together such as Kawasaki's KR250 road bike and KR250 and KR350 GP Bikes. A tandem twin is effectively a pair of geared singles, and is to be distinguished from an inline twin such as the Sunbeam S7. Tandem twins are suitable primarily for two-stroke racers. ===Triple=== ;Inline triple Triumph Rocket III inline-3 Three-cylinder engines, a.k.a. triples, are normally mounted transversely. The British Hinckley Triumph factory has specialized in transverse triples, although their 2,300 cc Rocket III has its engine mounted longitudinally. Other examples are the Benelli' \\"Tre\\"and the Yamaha XS750. The Italian firm Laverda made a few 1,000 cc and 1,200 cc triples. Some Laverda Triples had 120° cranks, while some had 180° cranks, essentially three- quarters of a four. BMW made the K75 longitudinally mounted 750 cc triple with the cylinders parallel to the ground. Meriden Triumph developed the 750 cc Trident, from which BSA \\"badge-engineered\\" the Rocket-3. Some triples were two-strokes. The Kawasaki triples were produced with capacities of 250, 350, 400, 500, and 750 cc in the 1970s, while Suzuki produced 380, 550, and 750 triples, the last being water-cooled. Motobecane made 350 cc and fuel-injected 500 cc triples with 3 into 4 pipes in the early seventies. Honda produced the water-cooled V-3 two-strokes MVX250 and NS400. There have been various race bike triples such as Kawasaki KR750, Suzuki TR750 transverse 3s, and Proton/Modenas KR3, Honda NS500 V-3s. ===Four=== Four-cylinder engines are most commonly found in a transverse-mounted inline four layout, although some are longitudinal, as in the earlier BMW K100. V-4 and boxer designs, as in the earlier Honda Gold Wing, have been produced. One of the more unusual designs was the Ariel Square Four, effectively two parallel-twin engines one in front of the other in a common crankcase — it had remarkably little vibration due to the contra-rotating crankshafts. ;Inline four Honda CB750 transverse inline-4 Production of four cylinder motorcycles began with the FN Four in 1905. The FN had its engine in line with the frame; this layout would be copied by manufacturers in Europe and the United States before World War II. In the United States, inline fours made by Henderson and Indian were bought by enthusiasts and by police departments, the latter using them as pursuit motorcycles. The first across-the-frame 4-cylinder motorcycle was the racer 1939 Gilera 500 Rondine, it also had double-over-head camshafts, forced- inducting supercharger and also water-cooled. Since the advent of the Honda CB750 straight-four engine, straight-fours have dominated the non-cruiser street motorcycle segments. The German manufacturer Münch based their motorcycles on four-cylinder car engines. For example, the Mammut 2000 has a 2.0l with a turbo and cylinder heads by Cosworth. ;Flat four The Honda GL1000 flat-four A flat-4 or horizontally opposed-4 is a flat engine with four cylinders arranged horizontally in two banks of two cylinders on each side of a central crankcase. The pistons are usually mounted on the crankshaft such that opposing pistons move back and forth in opposite directions at the same time, somewhat like a boxing competitor punching their gloves together before a fight, which has led to it being referred to as a boxer engine. The configuration results in inherently good balance of the reciprocating parts, a low centre of gravity, and a very short engine length. ;V4 Honda VFR1200F engine with dual clutch transmission. Honda uses V4 engines in the ST series and VFR series. As for two-stroke engines, there were four cylinders in the smaller classes such as Kawasaki's 125 cc KR3 square 4 and Yamaha's 250 cc RD500 V4 (RZ 500 in the US). Yamaha later raced transverse four TZ500/700/750's and virtually all the bikes in the last decade of the two- stroke GP500 era were fours, first squares then Vs, by Honda, Kawasaki, Cagiva, Suzuki, Yamaha. Kawasaki also experimented with a trapezoidal four the 602S. Yamaha made the V4 RD500LC, and Suzuki the RG400 and RG500 square four road bikes. ;Square four A square four is a U engine with two cylinders on each side. This configuration was used on the Ariel Square Four motorcycle from 1931 to 1959. This design was revived as a two-stroke version on some racing Suzuki models, and their subsequent road-going version the RG500. Although some racing success was achieved, the road bikes didn't sell in great numbers, and the design was phased out in favor of in-line, four-stroke designs, as at the time two-stroke engines were quickly being superseded by more economical, reliable, and emissions-friendly four-strokes. ===Five=== ;V5 Honda V5 MotoGP engine Honda has produced five-cylinder engines for racing, the RC211V 990 cc V5. No V5 engines are currently available in commercial production motorcycles. Just prior to their collapse, BSA planned a modular family of bike engines based around a 200 cc single. The range was to include the single, a 400 cc twin, a 600 cc triple and a 1000 cc V5. None of these motorcycles reached production.\\"Bike\\" magazine February? 1973 ===Six=== ;Inline six Benelli Sei inline-6 The 1,047 cc Honda CBX was produced from 1978 to 1982. The 1,300 cc Kawasaki KZ1300 was produced from 1979 to 1989. Benelli made the 750 cc and 900 cc the Sei from 1972 to 1978. Honda made a 250 cc straight-six GP bike. The BMW K1600GT and K1600GTL, which were launched in 2011, have a transverse-mounted 1,649 cc engine. ;Flat 6 Honda Valkyrie flat-6 The six-cylinder engine is currently used by Honda in the Gold Wing, and had previously been used in the Valkyrie and the Rune, both of which were cruiser developments of the Gold Wing. ===V8=== Moto Guzzi V8 Galbusera built a V8 in 1938, and Moto Guzzi experimented over a period of two years with its dual- overhead-cam 500 cc V8, the Otto Cilindri, in the 1950s. Some custom and one- off motorcycles use more than six cylinders. For example, the Boss Hoss motorcycle uses (5,700 cc, 6,000 cc and 8,200 cc) Chevrolet V-8 crate motors. In 2003 Daimler-Chrysler manufactured a limited number of Tomahawk concept vehicles with a Dodge Viper V-10 engine. Australian company Drysdale have built short runs of 750 cc V8 superbikes and 1L V8 roadgoing motorcycles, both with engines specifically developed for the purpose. No major motorcycle manufacturer has used eight or more cylinders, although Honda made the 'almost' V8 oval-piston NR750 road bike and NR500 GP bike, having eight connecting rods. Morbidelli has shown two V8 prototype road bikes that were not produced. ===Other types=== Hercules Wankel 2000. ;Wankel rotary Wankel engines produce high power outputs for their size and weight, and several attempts were made to produce Wankel powered motorcycles in the 1970s. Yamaha and Kawasaki exhibited Wankel-powered motorcycles in 1972, but neither company manufactured one. German manufacturer Hercules, a member of the Sachs- controlled Zweirad Union, produced their single-rotor W2000 from 1974 to 1977. Suzuki produced their single-rotor RE5 from 1975 to 1976. Van Veen built 38 OCR1000 motorcycles with twin-rotor Comotor engines between 1978 and 1981. BSA experimented with Wankel engines before they ended production in the 1970s. These experiments later led to Wankel-engined Norton motorcycles in the 1980s and 1990s, including the Classic, the Commander, the fleet-only Interpol 2, and the F1. Steve Hislop won the 1992 Senior TT on a Wankel-powered Norton. ;Oval pistons The 8 valve per cylinder, two connecting rod per piston, oval piston Honda NR engine. Honda NR ;Rotary engines Megola, Killinger and Freund Motorcycle ;Turbine engines *MTT Turbine Superbike (turboshaft) *Jet Reaction afterburning turbojet Other jet engine motorcycle prototypes exist, but never have been commercialized. ;Rocket Several rocket-powered motorcycles have been built, including: *Fritz von Opel's 1928 \\"Monster\\" rocket bike *Skycycle X-2 rocket developed for Evel Knievel's Snake River Canyon jump attempt *Eric Teboul's rocket-powered dragbike that set the world record at Santa Pod Raceway in 2009 ==Electric== ==Diesel== Only very small numbers of diesel engined motorcycles have ever been built. The improved fuel efficiency is offset by the increased weight, reduced acceleration and potential difficulty of starting, at least in colder climates. Enfield India built a few from 1965 onwards but is no longer doing so. In November 2006, the Dutch company E.V.A. Products BV Holland announced their first diesel-powered motorcycle, its Track T-800CDI, using an 800 cc three-cylinder Daimler Chrysler diesel engine. Several armies are moving to an all-diesel engine fleet to reduce the fire risks of gasoline and the need to provide two different fuels. This includes their dispatch riders as well, encouraging the market for diesel motorcycles. Interest in biofuels is also likely to encourage future developments for small Diesels. Diesels are also available in both two- and four-stroke versions. ==Engine cooling== ===Liquid=== Liquid-cooled motorcycles have a radiator, similar to the radiator on a car, which is the primary way their heat is dispersed. Coolant is constantly circulated between this radiator and the cylinders when the engine is running. While most off-road motorcycles have no radiator fan and rely on air flowing over the radiators from the forward motion of the motorcycle, many road motorcycles have a small fan attached to the radiator which is controlled by a thermostat. Some off-road motorcycles are liquid-cooled, and anti-dirt protection is attached to the radiator. The cooling effect of this fan is enough to prevent the engine overheating in most conditions, so liquid-cooled bikes are safe to use in a city, where traffic may frequently be at a standstill. Emissions regulations and the market demand for maximum power are driving the motorcycle industry to liquid-cooling for most motorcycles. Even Harley-Davidson, a strong advocate of air-cooled motors, has recently added water cooling to the heads of their V-twin motors in their large touring models, with the radiators being hidden in the lower leg fairings. The Harley-Davidson Street 500, Street 750, and two V-Rod models have 60° V-twins that are fully water cooled, as opposed to the traditional air-cooled 45° V-twins. ===Air=== Most air-cooled motorcycles take advantage of air blowing past the cylinder and cylinder head while in motion to disperse heat. Frequent, sustained stationary periods may cause overheating. Some models, mostly scooters, are equipped with fans that force the air to go past the cylinder block, which solves the problem of city driving. The cylinders on air-cooled bikes are designed with fin heat sinks to aid in this process. Air- cooled bikes are cheaper, simpler and lighter than their water-cooled counterparts. ===Oil=== The BMW R1150GS has an oil cooler below the headlights and fins for air cooling on the cylinders Some manufacturers use a hybrid cooling method where engine oil is circulated between the engine case and a small radiator. Here the oil doubles as cooling liquid, prompting the name \\"oil-cooling.\\" Suzuki has produced many oil-cooled motorcycles. Modern BMW R-series flat-twin motorcycles, such as the R1150GS, use air and oil cooling. Polaris's Victory motorcycles use oil/air cooling exclusively. ==Other components== ===Fuel Injection=== Fuel injection and computer engine management systems are now normal on middle range and larger motorcycles and are increasingly being incorporated onto the smaller machines, partly driven by better emission control and lower maintenance but mostly by manufacturing cost considerations. Ignition systems moved from magneto in the 1950s to battery-coil-contact breaker points, and these were increasingly superseded by Capacitor Discharge Ignition (CDI) from the 1980s. Small, single-cylinder motorcycles abandoned the flywheel magneto system with contact breakers to similar flywheel driven solid-state systems at about the same time. ===Turbo and Superchargers=== Superchargers, or blowers, were common in the GPs, until they were banned. The first supercharger on a production motorcycle was the 2015 Kawasaki Ninja H2 and H2R. The big four made a turbocharged bike, and Honda made two, mainly as an exercise in technical expertise and later discontinued them for more conventional methods. Bolt-on superchargers are available for street bikes and are essential for performance applications such as drag bikes and land speed record streamliners. Most sports bikes now use a ram-air induction system where as road speed increases, more air is forced through ducts in the fairing to pressurize the airbox. The first on a production motorcycle was the 1990 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-11. Not to be confused with the original Ram-Air system where an air scoop/cowl was fitted to the top of the cylinder heads of Suzuki two-stroke engines to aid cooling. ==See also== *List of motorcycles by type of engine *Motorcycle motor powered car *List of motorized trikes *Aircraft engine ==References== Category:Engine technology ","title":"Motorcycle engine"},{"id":"2564892","text":" USS Little (DD-803), a Fletcher-class destroyer, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Captain George Little (1754-1809). Little was laid down by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corp., Seattle, Wash., 13 September 1943; launched 22 May 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Russell F. O'Hara; and commissioned 19 August 1944, Commander Madison Hall, Jr., in command. ==History== After training off the West Coast, Little departed Seattle 11 November 1944 to escort a convoy to Pearl Harbor. She arrived 23 November and participated in gunnery training and battle problems. On 22 January 1945 she got underway with a group of LSTs for Eniwetok and rehearsals for the invasion of Iwo Jima. Final preparations were made at Saipan, and 15 February Little sailed for the assault beaches. Shore bombardment at Iwo Jima began 19 February. Little furnished fire support for ground forces until the 24th when she left for Saipan. She returned 4 March for bombardment, screening, and radar picket duties, and was back at Saipan 14 March to prepare or the Okinawa invasion. Little sailed for Okinawa 27 March assigned to the demonstration group charged with feigning landings opposite the actual assault beaches. After accomplishing this diversion 1 and 2 April, Little screened transports and escorted LSTs to the beaches. On 19 April she was ordered to picket duty where she remained until 24 April--unscathed despite relentless enemy suicide attacks. On 3 May Little and Aaron Ward (DM-34) were again on picket duty. At 18:13 hours, 18 to 24 aircraft attacked from under cloud cover. Aaron Ward took the first hit at 18:41. An instant later Little was hit on the portside. Within 4 minutes three more enemy kamikazes had hit her, breaking her keel, demolishing the amidship section, and opening all three after machinery spaces. At 19:55 Little broke up and went down. Thirty-one of the Littles approximately 320 crew members perished, while another 49 suffered injuries. Little received two battle stars for World War II service. == References == * * == External links == *navsource.org: USS Little *hazegray.org: USS Little *dd803.org: USS Little Little (DD-803) Category:Ships built in Seattle Category:World War II shipwrecks in the Pacific Ocean Category:1944 ships Little (DD-803) Category:Ships sunk by kamikaze attack Category:Maritime incidents in May 1945 Category:Destroyers sunk by aircraft ","title":"USS Little (DD-803)"},{"id":"2564900","text":"Yu Yeon Kim (born 1956, South Korea) is an independent curator based in New York City, United States and Seoul, South Korea.

Wickes was laid down on 15 April 1942 at Orange, Tex., by the Consolidated Steel Corporation; launched on 13 September 1942, sponsored by Miss Catherine Young Wickes, the great-great-grandniece of Capt. Wickes; and commissioned on 16 June 1943, Lieutenant Commander William Y. Allen, Jr., in command. Departing New Orleans. La. on 13 July, Wickes sailed for Cuban waters and reached Guantanamo Bay three days later. She conducted shakedown training until 11 August, when she set sail for Charleston, S.C., where she commenced her post-shakedown availability. Wickes then trained into the autumn, ranging from Trinidad, in the British West Indies to Casco Bay, Maine; and from Norfolk, Virginia, to NS Argentia, Newfoundland, from 1 September to 6 November. Between drills at sea, the ship underwent brief periods of repair in the navy yards at Boston and Norfolk. On 6 November, Wickes departed the Boston Navy Yard in company with the small aircraft carrier Cabot (CVL-28) and sister destroyer Bell (DD-587)--their destination: the Canal Zone. Transiting the Panama Canal between 12 and 15 November, the destroyer reached San Diego, California, on the 22d, but pushed on for the Hawaiian Islands and reached Pearl Harbor on the 27th. Over the ensuing days, the destroyer exercised in those local waters, conducting antisubmarine and antiaircraft drills. On several occasions during this training, her routine was interrupted by orders to rendezvous with and augment the screens of various task groups returning from the operations which wrested the Gilbert Islands from Japan. == North Pacific campaign December 1943 - August 1944 == Wickes--in company with sister-ships Charles J. Badger (DD-657) and Isherwood (DD-520)--departed Pearl Harbor on 10 December 1943 and set a course for the Aleutian Islands. Over the next few months, Wickes operated in the Aleutians. To her commanding officer and crew, the duties performed seemed \\"uneventful\\", their \\"greatest battles\\", he recalled were fought against the elements and the \\"dreary monotony of Aleutian duty\\". Such an enervating routine was interrupted by three bombardments conducted by Task Force 94 (TF 94) against the Kuril Islands, Paramushiro and Matsuwa. The first raid hit Paramushiro on 4 February 1944 and marked the first time that Wickes made contact with the enemy. She bombarded Japanese targets in the town of Kurabuzaki on the southern tip of the island. Early in March, Wickes--in company with other units of TF 94--made another sweep into Japan's backyard. On the lookout for Japanese shipping as they steamed through the Sea of Okhotsk, the task force found slim pickings before again shelling targets on Paramushiro on 4 March. Another bombardment was slated to take place there, but unfavorable weather made it impossible. Two months later, Wickes' guns once more joined in a cannonade against Japanese facilities on Paramushiro and at Matsuwa, on 26 May and 13 June, respectively. Darkness and fog presented difficulties for the American forces but did not constitute insurmountable difficulties. On 2 August, while TF 94 was again steaming to shell Matsuwa, Wickes made visual contact with a \\"snooper\\", a Mitsubishi G4M \\"Betty\\" bomber. On van picket station, the destroyer opened fire on the intruder--the ship's first antiaircraft action. The plane managed to escape and, together with the worsening weather, nullified TF 94's chances of making an undetected approach to Matsuwa. The bombardment was accordingly canceled. Wickes' tour in one of the most difficult operating areas on the globe finally ended when she \\"very happily\\" departed Adak, Alaska, on 7 August, headed south in company with other units of Destroyer Squadron 49 (DesRon 49). Reaching San Francisco on 16 August, Wickes moored at Pier 36. There, she received minor repairs from the facilities and workmen of the Matson Navigation Company, under the eye of the Assistant Industrial Manager, Mare Island Navy Yard. During the refit, the ship received a \\"dazzle\\" camouflage pattern, designed to confuse observers as to the ship's heading and speed. == Philippines campaign, September 1944 - March 1945 == Underway from the west coast upon completion of repairs and alterations, Wickes set a course for Pearl Harbor once more, in company with Kimberly (DD-521), Young (DD-580), and William D. Porter (DD-579)--other units of DesRon 49. Reaching Hawaiian waters, Wickes spent the first two weeks of September engaged in supporting landing rehearsals at Lahaina Roads, Maui, \\"in preparation for forthcoming operations.\\" While in port between exercises at sea, Wickes received additional radar gear while alongside Yosemite (AD-19), in preparation for the ship's slated role as a fighter-director ship. Thus newly outfitted, Wickes left Pearl Harbor on 15 September, as part of Task Group 33.2 (TG 33.2), the group slated to hit the island of Yap. Reaching Eniwetok, in the Marshalls, on the 25th, the destroyer spent the next two days replenishing fuel and provisions. Resuming her voyage on the 28th, Wickes reached Manus, in the Admiralties, on 3 October. En route, the ship crossed the equator for the first time. However, changing operational requirements resulted in the cancellation of the Yap invasion. Wickes was thus reassigned to the 7th Fleet and earmarked for participation in the assault on the island of Leyte. She remained at Manus until 14 October, conducting general upkeep and engaging in gunnery and antisubmarine warfare (ASW) training. Wickes--with a fighter-director team embarked-- departed the Admiralties on 14 October. As a screening unit of task group \\"Baker\\"--TG 79.4--a transport group, the destroyer reached Leyte Gulf according to plan, on D day, 20 October. She then proceeded to her assigned radar picket station near the center of the gulf and assumed duties as picket and fighter-director ship. Over the next four days, Wickes remained on that station as the invasion of Leyte--the first step in the liberation of the Philippines--unfolded. She frequently saw Japanese aircraft--particularly in the area where the transports were congregated--but none came within range of her guns. She even made one good sound contact, on the 22d, and dropped an 11-depth-charge pattern but observed no positive results. Wickes witnessed the Battle of Surigao Strait from a faraway vantage point in the pre-dawn darkness of 25 October. \\"It is no exaggeration\\", recorded her historian, \\"to state that this engagement was exciting even from a distance.\\" During the rest of her time on station, Wickes' fighter-director team evaluated the air situation, controlling the protecting combat air patrol (CAP) overhead on the first two days of the landings, 20 and 21 October. During the first afternoon, the Wickes-directed CAP splashed a Mitsubishi A6M \\"Zero\\" carrier-borne fighter. Subsequently clearing Leyte Gulf, Wickes served as screen commander for a 12-ship group of LSTs headed for New Guinea. The group, Task Unit 79.14.9 (TU 79.14.9), reached Hollandia, arriving without incident on 1 November. Wickes dropped anchor soon after her arrival and remained there through the 4th. Wickes subsequently spent most of November in screening operations, escorting a transport group during all phases of its replenishment run to Leyte. Transports and cargo ships, TG 79.15, were screened to Noemfoor Island and during the loading operations that ensued. She then escorted them to Leyte, where they were unloaded on the 18th. She then escorted the auxiliaries back to Seeadler Harbor, Manus, where she arrived on the 25th. Wickes departed Manus on the 28th, bound for Torokina, Bougainville, in the Solomons, escorting the troopships of Transport Division 38. En route, she touched at Finschhafen on the 29th during the division's stopover to embark troops and reached Torokina on 1 December. Wickes remained at Torokina, Empress Augusta Bay, until the 15th, patrolling the outskirts of that body of water in company with her sister-ships of DesRon 49. The next day, she began the return trip to the Admiralty Islands but stopped in the Huon Gulf for a landing exercise to prepare for her next slated operation. She finally reached Manus on the 21st. The destroyer spent Christmas in port and replenished her logistics requirements until the 27th. Underway on that day, Wickes proceeded to Luzon for the assault at Lingayen. On the approach run, the ship--screening tractor groups \\"Able and Baker\\" of TF 79--steamed with TU 79.11.3. Embarked was a new fighter-director team taken on at Manus. The northbound run proved largely uneventful, except for what the ship's historian called \\"a moderate amount of heckling\\" by enemy aircraft day and night. Again, Wickes proved exceptionally adept at fighter-direction duties. Her team vectored CAP planes to oncoming enemy planes, and they accordingly splashed four Nakajima Ki-44 \\"Tojo\\" fighters into the waters off Luzon on the morning of 8 January 1945. The ship herself did not fire upon any enemy planes until reaching Lingayen Gulf itself the following day, 9 January, when she fired at a pair of attacking planes, driving them off but not splashing them. That same evening, Wickes departed the coast of Luzon with her charges, screening the unloaded ships as they headed out of the battle area. About one-half hour before sunrise on the morning of 10 January, a Japanese plane--a single-engined fighter--pushed over in a dive and dropped a bomb which exploded off the destroyer's starboard side, close aboard. Fragments, scything through the air, wounded 15 sailors topside and punctured the ship with a few small holes. That brush with the enemy, and the light damage inflicted by the attacker, did not keep the ship off the \\"front lines\\", for she was soon back in action again, operating on antisubmarine patrols in Leyte Gulf during most of the time between 13 and 25 January. On 26 January, she sortied as part of TG 78.3 and took station as escort and fighter-director ship for the passage of the task group through the Mindanao and Sulu Seas, en route to Luzon, for landings on the west coast in the vicinity of San Felipe, Zambales Province. The landings themselves took place two days later, meeting no opposition and calling for no bombardment. Friendly natives, happy to see their liberators, came out in bancas and other craft to greet the Americans warmly. On the 30th, Wickes stood in readiness during another unopposed landing--the one made at Grande Island, in Subic Bay. For the next two weeks, the destroyer was based on Subic Bay, operating in the waters off southwestern Luzon. During that period, she made a short run to Mindoro and back, escorting for convoys of landing craft each way. Meanwhile, preparations were being made for assaults on Bataan and Corregidor--the scene of the humiliating disasters for the United States and her Filipino allies three years before. Minesweeping operations commenced on 13 February. At sunset that day, Wickes joined her sister-ship Young in supporting the thinly armored \\"sweepers\\" off Manila Bay, retired with them that night, and returned with them the next morning. As the ships worked their way into an area between Corregidor and Carabao Islands, Japanese shore batteries emplaced on those islands and on Caballo began to lob shells at the minecraft and their escorts. Wickes teamed with Young to deliver vigorous counter-battery fire, knocking out the pugnacious guns. Other destroyers and cruisers also participated in the silencing of the enemy emplacements, but Wickes' historian modestly recorded, \\"No claim is made by Wickes to have done the job single-handed, but it is certain that this ship's gunfire was accurate and effective, and contributed materially toward the successful result and protection of the minesweepers who were able to proceed with their task unmolested for the remainder of the day.\\" Nevertheless, both Wickes and Young had some close shaves, as the enemy landed some shells close aboard but did not hit either ship. On the morning of the 15th, Wickes shelled Japanese positions in Mariveles Bay, just prior to the landings there. She then stood by to render gunfire support for the troops as they went ashore. However, when no opposition developed, the destroyer took up a patrol station, on watch for submarines. Meanwhile, throughout the day, 7th-Fleet destroyers and cruisers-- assisted by planes-- continued giving Corregidor a pasting. Between 04:00 and daylight on the 16th, Wickes steamed in company with Picking and Young, to intercept \\"suicide boats\\" that had penetrated Mariveles Bay. Many drifting mines revealed themselves with the wash of dawn--but no suiciders. Wickes destroyed one mine with gunfire and was about to destroy others when minesweepers arrived on the scene and relieved the destroyer of that duty. Wickes then proceeded to conduct another shore bombardment mission--this time against the beaches on Corregidor over which the assault was to pass. Paratroops drifted down and landed on the top of the island as part of the many-faceted attack designed to destroy the enemy units heavily entrenched there. When the troops commenced landing, Japanese guns opened up from caves on the rocky island. Wickes replied with counter-battery rounds against Corregidor and Caballo Islands, maneuvering to keep Caballo covered for the remainder of the day. Late on the afternoon of the 16th, Wickes--in company with Picking and Young--was detached from that duty. \\"By all standards\\", recounted the ship's historian when reviewing the Philippine operations, \\"this operation was the most interesting one the Wickes ever took part in.\\" It had afforded the ship the opportunity to observe, closely, the activities of other units: paratroops, heavy bombers, minesweepers, and ground troops alike. \\"All hands felt that at last the Wickes had produced some results and definitely accomplished something after months of more or less routine duties\\", \\"Fire from enemy shore batteries\\", he went on, \\"added just the right amount of hazard and provided the first real test of the ship under fire.\\" However, there would be quite enough \\"hazard\\", in the ship's future operations. Inexorably, the mighty American Navy bore down upon the shores of Nippon itself. Yet every step that the American armada took closer to the Japanese home islands increased the intensity of the enemy's resistance. For Wickes, upon conclusion of her support of the Corregidor assaults, there was a tender availability awaiting her in Leyte Gulf. After those repairs, Wickes --in company with Luce (DD-522) and Charles J. Badger--escorted the heavy cruisers Portland (CA-33) and Minneapolis (CA-36) to Ulithi, in the Carolines, departing Philippine waters on 2 March and returning eight days later on the 10th. == Battle of Okinawa, March - June 1945 == Wickes participated in the landing practices in Leyte Gulf for the next operation on the American timetable, the assault on Okinawa Gunto. From 13 to 16 March, the forces slated to take part in that thrust trained and rehearsed for the upcoming event. Activities during those days of training included duty in the tractor group \\"George\\" screen--TG 51.7--fire support drills, and ASW patrols around the transport area--all skills that would be very much needed. After replenishing fuel, ammunition, and provisions and receiving additional fighter-director equipment, Wickes--with a new fighter-director team embarked-- sortied for Okinawa on 19 March with TG 51.7. Upon her arrival off Okinawa on the 26th, Wickes acted as a fire support vessel, supporting the landings by scheduled bombardments on Yakabi Shima, Kerama Retto; but there was no opposition on that island that required additional naval gunfire. Commencing on 26 March and continuing through 4 May, Wickes conducted regular radar-picket and fighter-director duties on the various stations off Okinawa. During that period, the CAP, vectored to the enemy by Lt. (jg.) James R. Baumgartner, USNR, the senior fighter-director officer embarked, engaged 42 enemy aircraft, destroyed eight, and damaged four. Late on the afternoon of 22 April, the Wickes-directed CAP scored their most signal success. On Radar Picket Station 14, about 70 miles northwest of Okinawa,Wickes vectored Marine fighters from Yontan Field to a large raid approaching from the northward. The flying Leathernecks knocked down 26 Japanese planes, probably splashed another pair, and damaged four. After later turning over her fighter-director team to Gainard (DD-706), on 4 May, Wickes alternated duty on the antiaircraft screen protecting the transports off Hagushi beach with antisubmarine patrols. She also supervised underway fueling operations for a day. She then underwent a period of needed upkeep to have her boilers cleaned. During the 51 days Wickes spent off Okinawa, she took enemy aircraft under fire no less than 14 times, and was four times, the object of attention from kamikazes. Her gunners claimed five \\"kills\\" from the suiciders' ranks, and one \\"probable\\". Two of the downed enemy aircraft managed to crash close enough to send pieces of themselves onto the ship's fantail--but doing no damage. On one occasion, one of the kamikazes attempted to torpedo the ship, but its \\"fish\\" also missed. In addition, Wickes may have saved the hospital ship Relief (AH-1) from serious damage when she deflected, with her gunfire, a suicider attempting to crash into the ship-of-mercy. Until 10 April, Wickes patrolled her picket stations alone, without support. After that time, a landing craft or another destroyer was always present. Other incidental occurrences that came up during the ship's time off the embattled isle of Okinawa included the rescue of five men from a raft from the fast transport Dickerson (APD-21); fishing out a crashed fighter pilot from the fleet carrier Bennington (CV-20); and exploding a drifting mine with gunfire. Remarkably, in contrast to some of her sister- ships that suffered grievous damage at the hands of the suicidal kamikaze, Wickes suffered only three casualties: all wounded when a plane strafed the ship. Wickes departed the Okinawa area on 15 May, bound for Ulithi, while the campaign continued on. She screened a convoy of auxiliaries and merchantmen to the Western Carolines, reaching her destination on the 21st. She then nested alongside the destroyer tender Prairie (AD-15) and received a 10-day availability. The time spent there at the sprawling, busy, advance base was, truly, \\"a welcome rest\\" after the long hours of general quarters and alerts that were part and parcel of duty off Okinawa. \\"Although all hands had gained a great deal of confidence in our ability to handle air attacks\\", wrote the ship's historian, \\"it was difficult, after more than a month of picket duty, not to feel like fugitives from the law of averages, as so many other ships had been hit.\\" Wickes--her availability alongside Prairie completed by early June--departed Ulithi on 7 June, escorting another slow convoy. Her destination was again Okinawa. She safely reached there with her charges on the 13th and took on board another fighter-director team. In company with two or three supporting destroyers, Wickes then returned to the picket lines. Most enemy air activity then took place nocturnally. Her second stay at Okinawa proved briefer than the first. The ship headed for Saipan on 23 June with a slow convoy but with onward routing approved to Pearl Harbor. Reaching Saipan on the 29th, Wickes departed that same day, bound for the Hawaiian Islands in company with Picking and Hall (DD-583). Making port at Pearl Harbor on 7 July, Wickes' time in Hawaiian waters proved brief; for, on the 8th, she was bound \\"stateside\\", her bow \\"very happily pointed\\" toward the Golden Gate. She made the last leg of the voyage in company with her old companion, Picking, and two other ships, Sproston (DD-577) and Brackett (DE-41). All ships arrived on the morning of 14 July and proceeded to the Naval Ammunition Depot at Mare Island to unload ammunition. Upon completion of that task, Wickes got underway for Hunters Point, tying up at pier-side at sunset, with 47 days' availability ahead of her. Within a day or two after arrival, DesRon 49 was dissolved; and Wickes was reassigned to DesRon 58. The war in the Pacific, though, ended before the destroyer completed her scheduled overhaul on 31 August 1945. With the end of the war, however, it soon became evident that with the massive shipbuilding programs that had come along during hostilities there was a surplus of ships for anticipated postwar needs. Along with the decommissioning and scrapping of many of the older fleet units, some of the newer ships were decommissioned and placed in reserve. Wickes was among the latter. Completing her overhaul by early September 1945, the ship conducted refresher training exercises into the autumn and winter. Her service career was growing short. She was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 20 December 1945. She never returned to active duty, even during the Korean War when many of her sister- ships were pulled out of mothballs and recommissioned. Struck from the Navy list on 1 November 1972, her hulk was later expended in ordnance tests. ==Honors== Wickes earned five battle stars for her World War II service. ==See also== *See USS Wickes for other ships of the same name. == References == * == External links == * navsource.org: USS Wickes * hazegray.org: USS Wickes Wickes (DD-578) Category:Ships built in Orange, Texas Category:1942 ships Wickes (DD-578) Category:Ships sunk as targets Category:Maritime incidents in 1974 ","title":"USS Wickes (DD-578)"},{"id":"2564906","text":"David Bergen (born January 14, 1957) is a Canadian novelist.

The Ross is the only ship in U.S. naval history to survive two underwater mine explosions. The Ross was laid down on 7 September 1942 by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corp., Seattle, Washington and launched on 10 September 1943, sponsored by Mrs. William J. Malone. She was commissioned on 21 February 1944, Commander Benjamin Coe commanding. She completed shakedown off California in early May 1944 and on 5 May sailed for Pearl Harbor. On 29 May she sortied with Task Force 52 (TF 52) for Eniwetok, whence the fleet sailed for Saipan and the beginning of the Marianas Campaign. == Marianas and Palaus campaign == Attached to the carrier support group for the invasion of Saipan, Ross arrived on station in the operating area to the east of the island on 14 June. Through the landings on the 15th, and until the 19th, she remained in that area providing screening and plane guard services for the carriers. On 19 June, she headed east with Kalinin Bay (CVE-68) to rendezvous with replacement aircraft from Eniwetok. On the 25th, the two ships rejoined the Saipan support force. Ross remained in the vicinity of Saipan and Tinian well into July, interrupting duty there only at the beginning of the month to escort another replacement aircraft run. On 1 August, the destroyer returned to Eniwetok, then headed for the Solomons to rehearse the Palau operation. On 6 September she departed Purvis Bay in Task Group 32.5 (TG 32.5), the Western Fire Support Group. Off Peleliu by dawn on 12 September, Ross screened the heavier ships as they began bombarding the proposed landing beaches. On the morning of the 13th, she closed White and Orange beaches to provide fire support for the Underwater Demolition Teams (UDTs) clearing the approaches of obstacles and through that day and the next she alternated between that mission and screening duty. On the night of 14-15 September, she shelled Ngesebus Island and conducted patrols to intercept enemy boat traffic. Then, prior to the 08:30 landings, she fired on enemy observation posts in the assault area. After the troops hit the beaches, she shifted to call fire support and until the 20th rotated that duty with night patrols and picket duty. On 20 August, Ross headed for Ulithi. Arriving the next day, she covered UDT operations on Asor, Falalop, and Sorlen. On the 23d, she covered the landings on Falalop and on the 24th she got underway to return to Peleliu. En route Ross stopped in Kossol Roads to embark Major General Julian Smith, USMC, and his staff, whom she transported to Peleliu. Arriving on 26 August, she provided harassing fire, call fire, and illumination until the 29th, when she sailed for Manus to prepare for her last amphibious operation, the invasion of Leyte. == Ross disabled == On 12 October, Ross departed the Admiralties. Five days later she arrived off Dinagat Island. On the morning of the 18th, she covered landings there, on Black Beach 2, then joined Task Unit 77.2.6 (77.2.6) to provide cover for that minesweeping and hydrography unit. Her duty, however, ended abruptly less than 15 hours later. At 01:33 on 19 October, she struck a mine to port under the forward engineroom and fireroom; and began to list to port. At 01:55 she struck a second mine in the vicinity of the after engineroom. The list increased to 14°. Chickasaw (ATF-83) and Preserver (ARS-8) closed to render assistance. Soon after 02:10, Ross jettisoned six torpedoes, all port depth charges, and miscellaneous gear. Topside movable weights were shifted to starboard. The list began to decrease. At 03:15, her medical officer, the seriously injured, and the ship's funds were transferred to Chickasaw. At 03:43, she was taken in tow by the ATF and 4 hours later anchored off Homonhon Island. Ross in 1945. Casualties from the mine explosions were three killed, 20 missing, nine injured. At 12:04 the anchorage was attacked by Japanese planes. Shrapnel injured two more from Ross' crew. In the afternoon, the destroyer was towed to an anchorage south of Mariquitdaquit Island. At dawn on 20 October, that anchorage was attacked. Salvage work on Ross began. Air attacks caused frequent interruptions, but the work continued. On 23 November, she was shifted to the Northern Transport Area anchorage and on the 24th, she was towed into San Pedro Bay and docked in floating drydock ARD-19. The frequent air raids continued, and on the 28th, Ross sustained further damage. A Nakajima Ki-44 \\"Tojo\\" crashed into the ARD, passed through the starboard wingwall, and caused gasoline-fed flames to encompass the dock basin deck. As firefighters went to work, another Japanese fighter began a strafing run, but was splashed by gunfire from Ross, the ARD and LST-556. Repairs to Ross were delayed as the ARD's crew repaired the drydock, but on 13 December the destroyer was underway under tow, for Humboldt Bay. There, further repairs were made and her journey was continued. On 2 March 1945 she reached Mare Island. Repairs complete, Ross moved down to San Diego at the end of June and in July she steamed for Pearl Harbor en route back to the Western Carolines. She arrived at Ulithi on 14 August, the day hostilities ended. From 24 August to 4 September, Ross was on air-sea rescue duty as occupation troops were moved by air from Okinawa to Tokyo. On the 5th, she entered Tokyo Bay and into October remained on occupation duty. Ross departed Japan for the United States on 21 October. On 9 November, she reported for inactivation at Seattle, and with the new year, she shifted to San Diego where she was decommissioned on 4 June 1946. == 1951 - 1953 == For the next 5 years Ross remained berthed with the Reserve Fleet at San Diego. In the summer of 1951 she was activated and on 27 October she was recommissioned. Into March 1952 she operated off southern California. On the 12th, she departed San Diego for the U.S. east coast,escorting the Carriers Ranger and Antietam for their conversion to slant deck carriers at her new homeport, Naval Station NorfolkNorfolk, Va., on the 29th, in company with another destroyer . Local operations occupied the summer; and, in late summer, she moved to Philadelphia Navy Yard for overhaul/conversion with a tri-pod mainmast to support high-tech radar/countermeasures and beefed-up 3.50\\" armament to counter missiles,replacing the 20/40mm AA armament. Also, acquiring another, smaller secondary tri-pod mast amidships, for AA firecontrol/countermeastures. In February 1953, she again steamed south, operated in the Caribbean into April, then returned to Norfolk to prepare for a summer cruise to Scotland and Norway. In August she was back in the Caribbean, and in September she returned to Norfolk. Further operations off the Atlantic seaboard and in the Caribbean followed, then in the spring of 1954 she began a cruise around the world. == 1954 == Departing Norfolk 20 April, Ross transited the Panama Canal and crossed the Pacific. Arriving at Yokosuka, Japan on 28 May, she served with the 7th Fleet until the end of August, ranging from the Sea of Japan to the South China Sea. From 24 to 29 July she participated in operations off Indochina as residents of North Vietnam were allowed to move to South Vietnam. On 31 August, Ross departed Sasebo, Japan. Then, steaming via Hong Kong, Singapore, Colombo, and the Suez Canal, she crossed the Mediterranean, and entered the Atlantic. On 28 October she reached Norfolk. == 1955 - 1959 == Ross tied up with other destroyers at in the 1950s. Coastal and Caribbean operations were resumed in May 1955, following an overhaul. In November, she headed east and, for the next 2½ months, operated with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. Returning to Norfolk on 26 February 1956, she conducted local operations through the spring, then repeated her 1953 schedule--a northern European cruise followed by exercises in the Caribbean. In 1957, the destroyer again deployed to the Mediterranean. Departing the east coast in late October, she arrived at Gibraltar at the end of the month and continued on. On 8 November she transited the Suez Canal and until mid-December operated in the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, Indian Ocean area. She then retransmitted the Canal, and remained with the 6th Fleet until 16 February 1958. Ross returned to Norfolk 5 March 1959. During the summer, she conducted her last summer cruise to Northern Europe. Into the summer she remained on the east coast. In July she operated in the Key West-Guantanamo Bay area and in August she departed Norfolk for Beaumont, Tex., and inactivation. ==Fate== In reserve from 10 August, Ross was decommissioned on 6 November 1959. The ship was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register 1 December 1974. She was sunk as a target off Puerto Rico 26 January 1978. == Awards == Ross (DD-563) earned five battle stars during World War II. == References == * == External links == *USS Ross website at Destroyer History Foundation * navsource.org: USS Ross * hazegray.org: USS Ross Ross (DD-563) Ross (DD-563) Category:Ships built in Tacoma, Washington Category:Shipwrecks in the Caribbean Sea Category:1943 ships Ross (DD-563) Category:Maritime incidents in 1978 Category:Ships sunk as targets ","title":"USS Ross (DD-563)"},{"id":"2564913","text":"Maxime Brunerie (born 21 May 1977, in Courcouronnes) is a convicted criminal and far-right activist, known for the failed assassination of the then French President Jacques Chirac on 14 July 2002. == Biography == === Early life === Maxime Brunerie was born 21 May 1977 in Courcouronnes, the son of Annie and Jean Brunerie. He was a far-right activist, participated in protests and worked as a janitor. Diagnosed with lymphoma in 1998 and undergoing chemotherapy, Brunerie found a propaganda sticker of the neo-Nazi French and European Nationalist Party (PNFE), and became a member of the group between June and November 1998, when he left the \\"agonizing party\\" to join the Groupe Union Défense, renamed Unité Radicale early that year. In June 1999, Brunerie entered the National Republican Movement led by Bruno Mégret, and ran for the party during the 2001 municipal elections in the 18th arrondissement of Paris. Brunerie also attended BTS studies in management accounting after 2000. === Assassination attempt === While Jacques Chirac was reviewing troops in a motorcade such as this one on Bastille Day 2002, he was shot at by Brunerie. On 14 July 2002, 25-year-old Brunerie attempted to assassinate French president Jacques Chirac by firearm during the Bastille Day parade on the Champs-Élysées. The week before the attempt, Brunerie obtained a .22 Rifle. On the day before the attempt, Brunerie left a message on the Combat 18 guestbook saying \\"Watch the Tv This Sunday, i will be the star... Death to zog,88!\\" CRS in riot control gear Armed with a .22 rifle hidden in a guitar case, Brunerie attempted to fire one shot from the sidewalk at the passing presidential motorcade before spectators noticed Brunerie. Brunerie then attempted suicide but spectators were able to divert his gun before the police were able to arrest him. According to police, the shot was very wide and the shooter's inexperience and lack of preparation made unlikely a successful assassination attempt. Brunerie was found to have been linked to the far-right group Unité Radicale (which was dissolved in the aftermath of the shooting), and had been a candidate for the far-right party Mouvement National Républicain at a local election, as well as being associated with the French and European Nationalist Party. After the police searched his house, they found a copy of Mein Kampf and a skinhead-themed music CD. Brunerie's trial began on 6 December 2004. The court eventually found the defendant guilty of attempted murder, judging that his mental responsibility, though diminished, was not abolished. On 10 December 2004, Brunerie was sentenced to ten years of prison. He was freed after seven years in jail, on 3 August 2009. === After his release === He stated that he did not want to kill Chirac, he wanted to commit suicide by cop by being beaten to death by the GIGN. He finished his BTS in management accounting in prison. He was interviewed by Europe 1 not too long after his release, stating that he \\"lost it\\" in 2002 and wants to move on. In 2011, he released an autobiography titled A normal life : I wanted to kill Jacques Chirac and now says he is far from any political activism. The same year he founded a book reselling company. His political views changed; he requested a membership for the Democratic Movement but he got denied. He voted for Ségolène Royal in the 2011 elections. In 2011, he posted an update on a literary review called Bordel; the update was removed before the review was published. In 2012, he triggered a controversy by participating in the jury of a literary prize created by Laurence Biava. In 2013, he participated in an protest against same-sex marriage, where he was suspected of violence against his companion. == References == Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century French criminals Category:Failed assassins Category:French assassins Category:Far-right politicians in France Category:French nationalists Category:French prisoners and detainees Category:People convicted of attempted murder Category:People from Essonne Category:Prisoners and detainees of France ","title":"Maxime Brunerie"},{"id":"2564914","text":"Kringle Domains are autonomous protein domains that fold into large loops stabilized by 3 disulfide linkages.

There are many systems for classifying types of motorcycles, describing how the motorcycles are put to use, or the designer's intent, or some combination of the two. Six main categories are widely recognized: cruiser, sport, touring, standard, dual-purpose, and dirt bike. Sometimes sport touring motorcycles are recognized as a seventh category. Strong lines are sometimes drawn between motorcycles and their smaller cousins, mopeds, scooters, and underbones, but other classification schemes include these as types of motorcycles.The MAIDS report, using the OECD Road Transport Research Programme methodology, uses the following nine classifications for motorcycles, mopeds, and scooters, providing one illustration of each: * Conventional street example: Triumph Bonneville T100 * Sport example: Triumph Daytona 955i * Cruiser example: Suzuki Marauder * Chopper example: a Harley- Davidson chopper in David Mann red * Touring example: Honda Gold Wing GL1800 * Scooter example: Vespa Granturismo 200 * Step-through example: a moped * Sport Touring example: Ducati ST4s * Enduro example: KTM 950 Adventure S See: * * There is no universal system for classifying all types of motorcycles. There are strict classification systems enforced by competitive motorcycle sport sanctioning bodies, or legal definitions of a motorcycle established by certain legal jurisdictions for motorcycle registration, emissions, road traffic safety rules or motorcyclist licensing. There are also informal classifications or nicknames used by manufacturers, riders, and the motorcycling media. Some experts do not recognize sub-types, like naked bike, that \\"purport to be classified\\" outside the six usual classes, because they fit within one of the main types and are recognizable only by cosmetic changes. ==Street== Street motorcycles are motorcycles designed for being ridden on paved roads. They have smooth tires with a light tread pattern and engines generally in the and over range. Typically, street motorcycles are capable of speeds up to , and many of speeds in excess of . === Standard=== The Ducati Monster 696 naked bike Standards, also called naked bikes or roadsters, are versatile, general-purpose street motorcycles. They are recognized primarily by their upright riding position, partway between the reclining rider posture of the cruisers and the forward leaning sport bikes. Footpegs are below the rider and handlebars are high enough to not force the rider to reach too far forward, placing the shoulders above the hips in a natural position. Because of their flexibility, lower costs, and moderate engine output, standards are particularly suited to motorcycle beginners. Standards usually do not come with fairings or windscreens, or if they have them, they are relatively small. Standard is often a synonym for naked, a term that was used in reference to 1950s road racing bikes.TT '78 A Motor Cycle News special, EMAP publication, 1978. Hailwood's homecoming, pp.57-61. Accessed June 18 2018Motorcyclist Illustrated, October 1974, p.13, Bomber, John Player Norton road test by Dave Minton (pp.10-15) The standard seemed to have disappeared, fueling nostalgia for the return of the Universal Japanese Motorcycle, which were admired for their simplicity, quality, and versatility. ' is a nickname for a motorcycle type, derived from either a standard or sport bike design, that puts a disproportionately high priority on engine power. Roadster is equivalent to standard or naked. ===Cruiser=== Harley-Davidson cruisers and a touring bike (red) Cruisers are styled after American machines from the 1930s to the early 1960s, such as those made by Harley-Davidson, Indian, and Excelsior-Henderson. Harley-Davidsons largely define the cruiser category, and large-displacement V-twin engines are the norm, although other engine configurations and small to medium displacements also exist. Their engines are tuned for low-end torque, making them less demanding to ride because it is not necessary to shift as frequently to accelerate or maintain control. The riding position places the feet forward and the hands are up relatively high, so that the spine is erect or leaning back slightly. At low to moderate speeds, cruisers are more comfortable than other styles, but riding for long periods at freeway speeds can lead to fatigue from pulling back on the handlebars to resist the force of the wind against the rider's chest. Cruisers have limited cornering ability due to a lack of ground clearance. Peter Fonda rides a chopper used in Easy Rider. Choppers are a type of cruiser, so called because they are a \\"chopped\\", or cut-down, version of a production cruiser. Choppers are usually custom projects that result in a bike modified to suit the owner's ideals, and, as such, are a source of pride and accomplishment. Stereotypically, a chopper may have raked-out forks, small fuel tanks and high handlebars. Choppers were popularised in the Peter Fonda film Easy Rider. Being designed primarily for visual effect, choppers will not usually be the most efficient riding machines. Related to the chopper motorcycle is the bobber which is created by \\"bobbing\\" a factory bike by removing dead weight and bodywork from a motorcycle to reduce mass and increase performance. A common element of these motorcycles is a shortened rear fender that creates a \\"bobbed\\" look. A Ducati Diavel power cruiser Power cruiser is a name used to distinguish bikes in the cruiser class that have significantly higher levels of power. They often come with upgraded brakes and suspensions, better ground clearance, and premium surface finishes, as well as more exotic or non-traditional styling.2015 EICMA: Ducati reveals XDiavel power cruiser motorcycleFIRST LOOK: 2016 DUCATI XDIAVEL FROM EICMA 2015  MOTORCYCLIST2009 Yamaha/Star Vmax Road Test  Rider Magazine  Rider Magazine2015 Ducati Diavel First Ride - Motorcycle USACOMPARISON TEST: Ducati Diavel Carbon vs. Honda Gold Wing Valkyrie vs. Star VMAX ===Sport bike=== A Suzuki GSX-R sport bike at Deals Gap Sport bikes emphasize top speed, acceleration, braking, handling and grip on paved roads, (\\"…a powerful, lightweight motorcycle, designed for optimal speed and handling\\" ) typically at the expense of comfort and fuel economy in comparison to less specialized motorcycles. Because of this, there are certain design elements that most motorcycles of this type will share. Sport bikes have comparatively high performance engines resting inside a lightweight frame. Inline-four engines dominate the sport bike category, with V-twins having a significant presence, and nearly every other engine configuration appearing in small numbers at one time or another. The combination of these elements helps maintain structural integrity and chassis rigidity. Braking systems combine higher performance brake pads and multi-piston calipers that clamp onto oversized vented rotors. Suspension systems are advanced in terms of adjustments and materials for increased stability and durability. Most sport bikes have fairings, often completely enclosing the engine, and windscreens that effectively deflect the air at very high speeds, or at least reduce overall drag. Sport bikes have high footpegs that position the legs closer to the body to improve ground clearance when cornering, and a long reach to the hand controls, which positions the body and center of gravity forward, above the fuel tank. The rider leans forward into the wind, the force of which can comfortably support the rider's weight at speeds near , but at lower speeds leaves too much weight on the arms and wrists, causing fatigue. Streetfighters are derived from sport bikes, originally being customized sport bikes with the fairings removed and higher handlebars replacing the low clip-on handlebars. Since the 1990s, factory streetfighters have been produced. As with naked bike and muscle bike (below), the name streetfighter is used to help clarify the middle ground occupied by designs that blend elements of both sport bikes and standards. ===Touring=== Honda Gold Wing GL1800 touring motorcycle Although any motorcycle can be equipped and used for touring, touring motorcycles are specifically designed to excel at covering long distances. They have large- displacement engines, fairings and screens that offer good weather and wind protection, large-capacity fuel tanks for long ranges between fill-ups, and a relaxed, upright seating position. Passenger accommodation is excellent and expansive luggage space is the norm for this class. Such bikes can have wet weights of and top fully loaded with a rider, passenger and gear. Bagger, full dresser, full dress tourer, or dresser are various names for touring motorcycles, sometimes used disparagingly or jocularly, and originally referring to a Harley-Davidson or other cruisers with full sets of saddlebags. This can now refer to any touring motorcycle. ====Sport touring==== A BMW R1100RS sport-touring motorcycle Sport touring motorcycles combine attributes of sport bikes and touring motorcycles. The rider posture is less extreme than a sport bike, giving greater long-distance comfort. Accommodation for a passenger is superior to a sport bike as well, along with increased luggage capacity. Being lighter, at wet, than a pure touring bike and often having racier engines, suspensions, and brakes, sport tourers corner better and are more at home being aggressively ridden on curvy canyon roads. The distinction between touring and sport touring is not always clear as some manufacturers will list the same bike in either category in different markets. The Honda ST1300 Pan-European, for example, was listed by Honda as a sport touring motorcycle in the United States and Australia, but as a touring motorcycle in Europe. === Dual-sport=== BMW R1200GS dual-sport motorcycle Dual-sports, sometimes called dual-purpose or on/off-road motorcycles or adventure motorcycles, are street legal machines that are also designed to enter off- road situations. Typically based on a dirt bike chassis, they have added lights, mirrors, signals, and instruments that allow them to be licensed for public roads. They are higher than other street bikes, with a high center of gravity and tall seat height, allowing good suspension travel for rough ground. Adventure motorcycles are motorcycles with touring capability on paved and unpaved roads. As a dual-sport they have a significant on-pavement bias and perform well on pavement at higher speeds unlike most dual-sports. Their size, weight and sometimes their tires, however, limits their off-road capability. Most adventure motorcycles function well on graded dirt and gravel roads but are less than ideal on more difficult off-pavement terrain. Supermoto motorcycles were designed to compete on a single course that alternated between three genres of motorcycle racing: road racing, track racing, and motocross. This increasingly popular type of motorcycle is often a dual-sport that has been fitted by the manufacturer with smaller rims and road tires. Supermotos are quickly gaining popularity as street bikes due to their combination of light weight, durability, relatively low cost, and sporty handling. ==Off-road== A KTM dirt bike with a paddle tire There are various types of off-road motorcycles, also known as dirt bikes, specially designed for off-road events. The term off-road refers to driving surfaces that are not conventionally paved. These are rough surfaces, often created naturally, such as sand, gravel, a river, mud or snow. These types of terrain can sometimes only be travelled on with vehicles designed for off-road driving (such as SUVs, ATVs, snowmobiles and mountain bikes) or vehicles that have off-road equipment. Compared to road-going motorcycles, off-road machines are lighter and more flexible, having long suspension travel, high ground clearance, and are geared higher to provide more torque in off-road situations. Wheels (usually 21\\" front, 18\\" rear) have knobby tires, often clamped to the rim with a rim lock. There are specialized motorcycles for a variety of off-road motorcycle sports: * Motocross — Such bikes are raced on short, closed off- road tracks with a variety of obstacles. The motorcycles have a small fuel tank for lightness and compactness. Long-travel suspension allows riders to take jumps at high speed. Motocross engines are single-cylinder two-stroke or four-stroke units, which vary in size from 50cc up to about 500cc. At the professional level, bikes are split up into two levels based on their displacements: MX and MX Lite. The MX Lite class contains 125cc two-stroke engines and 250cc four-stroke engines, while the MX class pits 250cc two- stroke engines against 450cc four-stroke engines. The differences in power, displacement, torque, and weight are all variables that balance the competition between two-stroke and four-stroke engines. Motocross sidecar outfits have bigger engines, usually four-stroke and often twin-cylinder. Motocross bikes are also used in freestyle motocross. * Enduro — A modified and road-legal motocross bike, having the addition of a horn, lights, effective silencing and a number plate. Enduro riders compete over a longer course (which may include roads); and an enduro event may last between one day and six days (such as the International Six Days Enduro). Some enduro events (known as \\"multi-lappers\\") are held on rather shorter circuits, not unlike scramble tracks. \\"Multi-lappers\\" are especially popular with novice riders. * Rally raid, or \\"rallies\\" — A special type of enduro bike with a significantly larger fuel tank for very long distance racing, typically through deserts (e.g. Paris-Dakar rally). Engine capacities tend to be larger, usually between 450 cc and 750 cc. *Dual-Sport — A dual-sport bike is a multi-purpose bike, made for on-road and recreational off-road riding. A dual-sport bike may resemble an enduro bike, but since a dual-sport bike is not intended to be used for competition, it may be less rugged, and equipped with dual-purpose tires and with more road legal equipment, such as indicators, mirrors and extra instruments. Most dual-sport bikes require a number plate to be ridden on state and county roads. * Trials — Trials riding is a specialized form of off-road competition testing balancing skills and precision rather than speed. For a trials bike, low weight and crisp throttle response power are prioritized, so trials bikes tend to have a small (125 cc to 300 cc) engine, with two-strokes being common. During the trial, the rider stands on the foot- pegs, so a trials bike will have only a vestigial seat, or no seat at all. Fuel tanks are very small, giving a very limited range. * Track racing — High- speed oval racing, typically with no brakes, nor rear suspension. The engines, fueled by methanol, are long-stroke four-stroke singles, such as JAP and Jawa. They have at most two gears. Some types, such as speedway, and grass-track bikes, are designed to take left turns only. *Snow bikes — A snow bike takes a typical dirt-bike and replaces the rear wheel with a single tread system similar to a snowmobile and the front wheel with a large ski. They are much smaller and more nimble than a snowmobile, and they have a tighter turning radius which lets the rider go where many snowmobiles cannot. The first prototype of motorcycles with a rear tread date all the way back to the 1920s, with failed attempts to bring them onto the market until recent times. Many motorcycles made after the 1990s or later can be fitted with a kit that transforms them into a snow bike. ==Scooters, underbones and mopeds== Road racing a Lambretta scooter Scooter engine sizes range smaller than motorcycles, , and have all-enclosing bodywork that makes them cleaner and quieter than motorcycles, as well as having more built-in storage space. Automatic clutches and continuously variable transmissions (CVT) make them easier to learn on and to ride. Scooters usually have smaller wheels than motorcycles. Scooters usually have the engine as part of the swingarm, so that their engines travel up and down with the suspension. Modenas Kriss 120cc underbone Underbones are small-displacement motorcycles with a step-through frame, descendants of the original Honda Super Cub. They are differentiated from scooters by their larger wheels and their use of footpegs instead of a floorboard. They often have a gear shifter with an automatic clutch. The moped used to be a hybrid of the bicycle and the motorcycle, equipped with a small engine (usually a small two-stroke engine up to 50 cc, but occasionally an electric motor) and a bicycle drivetrain, and motive power can be supplied by the engine, the rider, or both. There is also Sport mopeds – a type of moped that resembles a sport bike. In many places, mopeds are subject to less stringent licensing than bikes with larger engines and are popular as very cheap motorbikes, with the pedals seeing next to no use. Mopeds were very popular in the United States during the fuel-crisis of the late 1970s and early 1980s, but their popularity has fallen off sharply since the mid-1980s. In response to rising fuel prices in the first decade of the 2000s, U.S. scooter and moped ridership saw a resurgence. Sales of motorcycles and scooters declined 43.2% in 2009, and continued to decrease in the first quarter of 2010, with scooter sales doing worst, down 13.3% compared to a 4.6% drop for all two-wheelers. Other types of small motorcycles include the minibike, monkey bike, Welbike, pocketbike, and pit bike. ==Enclosed and feet forwards== Zerotracer, winner of the Zero Emissions Race competition, is an electric feet forwards cabin motorcycle Enclosed motorcycles include cabin motorcycles and streamliner motorcycles. Feet forwards motorcycles include the 1911 Wilkinson TMC and the 1918 Ner-A-Car. Contemporary examples include the Quasar, and the Peraves range. ==Utility== Police motorcycles are job-related motorcycles Some motorcycles are specially adapted for specific job functions, such as those used by the ambulance, blood bikes, fire, and military services, and for specialized delivery services, such as pizza deliveries. Beginning in the 1960s with the Mountain Goat specialized motorcycles were developed for use on farms. The Motocrotte (or cainette) was used in Paris to collect dog waste with vacuum suction in the 1980s and 1990s, and was still in use in other French cities as of 2016. A derny is a motorized bicycle used for motor- paced cycling events. ==Tricycles== Yamaha Niken with 3 wheels While motorcycles typically have two wheels, some motorized tricycles are classed as three-wheeled motorcycles. Some brands have made various types of three- wheelers direct from the factory. Most of these vehicles are treated as motorcycles for registration or licensing purposes. Tilting three-wheelers keep all three wheels on the ground when they lean to negotiate curves. These include Honda's Gyro range, all of which have a front wheel that leans and a pair of rear wheels that do not, and the Piaggio MP3, which has two front wheels and a single rear wheel, all of which lean. The Yamaha Niken is also a tilting three wheeler but has smaller track width such that it is considered a motorcycle by some authorities. ==See also== *Motorcycling *Outline of motorcycles and motorcycling *List of motorcycle manufacturers *List of scooter manufacturers *List of motorized trikes ==Notes== * ","title":"Types of motorcycles"},{"id":"2564984","text":"Sir George Clausen (18 April 1852 – 22 November 1944) was a British artist working in oil and watercolour, etching, mezzotint, dry point and occasionally lithographs. He was knighted in 1927. ==Biography== George Clausen was born in London on 18 April 1852, the son of a decorative artist of Danish descent. From 1867 to 1873, he attended the design classes at the South Kensington Schools in London with great success. He then worked in the studio of Edwin Long RA, and subsequently in Paris under Bouguereau and Tony Robert-Fleury at the Académie Julian. He was an admirer of the naturalism of the painter Jules Bastien-Lepage about whom he wrote in 1888 and 1892. Clausen became one of the foremost modern painters of landscape and of peasant life, influenced to a certain extent by the Impressionists, with whom he shared the view that light is the real subject of landscape art. His pictures excel in rendering the appearance of things under flecking outdoor sunlight, or in the shady shelter of a barn or stable. His Girl at the Gate was acquired by the Chantrey Trustees and is now at the Tate Gallery. Clausen was a founding member of the New English Art Club in 1886. In 1895, he was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy, and a full Academician in 1906. As Professor of Painting at the Royal Academy he gave a memorable series of lectures to the students of the Schools, published as Six Lectures on Painting (1904) and Aims and Ideals in Art (1906). Clausen was an official war artist during World War I. During the war his daughter's fiancé was killed; this event may have inspired his painting, Youth Mourning which shows a distressed young woman mourning in a desolate landscape. Clausen also contributed six lithographs on the theme Making Guns for the Government published print portfolio Britain's Efforts and Ideals. In 1921 Clausen was an original member of the Society of Graphic Art and showed his work in their first exhibition.

A sequel to 1980's Berzerk, it was ported to the ColecoVision and ZX Spectrum. ==Gameplay== Frenzy followed the basic paradigm set by Berzerk: the player must navigate a maze full of hostile robots. The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible and score points by killing robots and travelling from room to room. The game has no end other than the player losing all of his or her lives. The player has a gun with which to shoot the robots, and simple intelligence of the robots means that they can often be tricked into shooting one another. If the player lingers too long in a room, a bouncing smiley face (known as \\"Evil Otto\\") appears, and relentlessly chases the player. Evil Otto will destroy any robots in his way, and can move through walls. ==Differences from Berzerk== In Berzerk, the walls are all electrified and kill the player on contact. In Frenzy, some of the walls of the maze are composed of \\"dots\\" which can be shot. This opens up strategies such as blasting a hole in the side of a room through which to escape when in trouble. The solid walls, on the other hand, now reflect shots. The player can trick robots into killing themselves by standing on the opposite side of a reflective wall and letting them shoot themselves. The only wall that simply absorbs shots harmlessly as in the original is the closed door that appears behind the player when he enters a new room. Neither type of wall is electrified in Frenzy, allowing the player to touch them without dying. The robots in Frenzy no longer kill the player on contact but now create small explosions when shot, which can kill the player. It is no longer possible to kill robots by tricking them into walking into the now-harmless walls. There are two types of robots: skeletons and tanks. The two types have identical behavior, but the skeletons are more difficult to shoot from above or below due to the thinness of their sprite. In Berzerk, Evil Otto was indestructible. In Frenzy, shooting him once changes him from a smiley face to a \\"neutral\\" face, and another shot converts him to a \\"frowny\\" face. Another shot kills him. However, each time Evil Otto is killed it makes him a little bit faster the next time he appears, which is usually immediately. Every four mazes features interactive, decorative elements that were not present in Berzerk. In one room is a huge statue of Evil Otto, for example. Each one has a specific effect on gameplay for that one room. The order is: Big Otto, Power Plant, Central Computer, and Robot Factory. The Power Plant and the Central Computer are surrounded by walls made entirely of \\"dots\\", while Big Otto and the Robot Factory are surrounded by reflective walls with only one breakable \\"dot\\" in the corner, making them more difficult to hit. In the Power Plant room, shooting the power plant once will disable it, and all robots in the room will stop moving. In the Central Computer room, shooting the computer will cause all the robots to start moving and firing erratically. While they are in such a state, the walls can kill them. The Robot Factory will continue to spit out additional robots while the player remains in the stage, taunting as it does so. Shooting the factory normally has no effect; however, in the Coleco port, shooting the factory will disable it and stop the endless stream of robots. In the Big Otto room, if the player kills Evil Otto, not only does he immediately respawn as usual, but the Big Otto sends four more Ottos onto the screen, all moving at top speed. Like the Robot Factory, shooting Big Otto has no effect. Big Otto starts out with closed eyes and a neutral expression, but kill all of the robots in the room, and his face turns into a slight frown. When Evil Otto is killed, his expression changes to one of rage, with glowing red eyes and a frowning mouth. He also smiles when the player dies, though his eyes remain the same as before, either closed or open. Finally, the robots in Frenzy are less talkative than those in Berzerk, only speaking in a few specific situations. They say \\"Robot attack!\\" when Evil Otto appears, \\"Charge attack shoot kill destroy\\" when the player kills Otto, \\"The humanoid must not destroy the robot\\" when entering the Big Otto room, \\"The humanoid...\\" when shooting the Central Computer, and the dialogue randomly alternates between \\"A robot must get the humanoid\\" and \\"A robot, not a chicken\\" when the Robot Factory dispenses a new robot. The constant background chatter of the original game is gone. ==Reception== Frenzy was a less popular game than Berzerk, possibly because it was even more difficult. ==Legacy== A conversion of the game for the Atari 7800 was created by Bob DeCrescenzo, with assistance from original Frenzy developer Alan McNeil, and sold through AtariAge.http://atariage.com/forums/topic/213784-re-started-frenzy- berzerk/?p=2782164 ==References== ==External links== Category:1982 video games Category:Stern video games Category:Arcade games Category:ColecoVision games Category:ZX Spectrum games Category:Multidirectional shooters Category:Video games about robots Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Frenzy (1982 video game)"},{"id":"2565011","text":"Saint Francis School was a private Roman Catholic school located in Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii.

The presence of ipRGCs were first noted in 1923 when rodless, coneless mice still responded to a light stimulus through pupil constriction, suggesting that rods and cones are not the only light-sensitive neurons in the retina. It wasn't until the 1980s that advancements in research on these cells began. Recent research has shown that these retinal ganglion cells, unlike other retinal ganglion cells, are intrinsically photosensitive due to the presence of melanopsin, a light-sensitive protein. Therefore they constitute a third class of photoreceptors, in addition to rod and cone cells. == Overview == Compared to the rods and cones, the ipRGCs respond more sluggishly and signal the presence of light over the long term. They represent a very small subset (~1%) of the retinal ganglion cells. Their functional roles are non- image-forming and fundamentally different from those of pattern vision; they provide a stable representation of ambient light intensity. They have at least three primary functions: * They play a major role in synchronizing circadian rhythms to the 24-hour light/dark cycle, providing primarily length-of-day and length-of-night information. They send light information via the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) directly to the circadian pacemaker of the brain, the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. The physiological properties of these ganglion cells match known properties of the daily light entrainment (synchronization) mechanism regulating circadian rhythms. In addition, ipRGCs could also influence peripheral tissues such as the hair follicle regeneration through SCN-sympathetic nerve circuit. * Photosensitive ganglion cells innervate other brain targets, such as the center of pupillary control, the olivary pretectal nucleus of the midbrain. They contribute to the regulation of pupil size and other behavioral responses to ambient lighting conditions. * They contribute to photic regulation and acute photic suppression of release of the hormone melatonin. * In rats, they play some role in conscious visual perception, including perception of regular gratings, light levels, and spatial information. An ipRGC, shown here as a complied image of the retina from proximal inner nuclear layer to the ganglion cell layer with fluorescent labeling of melanopsin Photoreceptive ganglion cells have been isolated in humans, where, in addition to regulating the circadian rhythm, they have been shown to mediate a degree of light recognition in rodless, coneless subjects suffering with disorders of rod and cone photoreceptors. Work by Farhan H. Zaidi and colleagues showed that photoreceptive ganglion cells may have some visual function in humans. The photopigment of photoreceptive ganglion cells, melanopsin, is excited by light mainly in the blue portion of the visible spectrum (absorption peaks at ~480 nanometers). The phototransduction mechanism in these cells is not fully understood, but seems likely to resemble that in invertebrate rhabdomeric photoreceptors. In addition to responding directly to light, these cells may receive excitatory and inhibitory influences from rods and cones by way of synaptic connections in the retina. The axons from these ganglia innervate regions of the brain related to object recognition, including the superior colliculus and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. == Structure == === ipRGC receptor === Melanopsin structure These photoreceptor cells project both throughout the retina and into the brain. They contain the photopigment melanopsin in varying quantities along the cell membrane, including on the axons up to the optic disc, the soma, and dendrites of the cell. ipRGCs contain membrane receptors for the neurotransmitters glutamate, glycine, and GABA. Photosensitive ganglion cells respond to light by depolarizing, thus increasing the rate at which they fire nerve impulses, which is opposite to that of other photoreceptor cells, which hyperpolarize in response to light. Results of studies in mice suggest that the axons of ipRGCs are unmyelinated. === Melanopsin === Unlike other photoreceptor pigments, melanopsin has the ability to act as both the excitable photopigment and as a photoisomerase. Instead of requiring additional cells to revert between the two isoforms, from all-trans-retinal back into 11-cis-retinal before it can undergo another phototransduction, like the photoreceptor cones, which rely on Müller cells and retinal pigment epithelium cells for this conversion, melanopsin is able to isomerize all-trans-retinal into 11-cis-retinal when stimulated with light without help from additional cells. The two isoforms of melanopsin differ in their spectral sensitivity, for the 11-cis-retinal isoform is more responsive to shorter wavelengths of light, while the all-trans isoform is more responsive to longer wavelengths of light. === Synaptic inputs and outputs === Synaptic inputs and outputs of ipRGCs and their corresponding location in the brain ==== Inputs ==== ipRGCs are both pre- and postsynaptic to dopaminergic amacrine cells (DA cells) via reciprocal synapses, with ipRGCs sending excitatory signals to the DA cells, and the DA cells sending inhibitory signals to the ipRGCs. These inhibitory signals are mediated through GABA, which is co-released from the DA cells along with dopamine. Dopamine has functions in the light-adaptation process by up-regulating melanopsin transcription in ipRGCs and thus increasing the photoreceptor's sensitivity. In parallel with the DA amacrine cell inhibition, somatostatin-releasing amacrine cells, themselves inhibited by DA amacrine cells, inhibit ipRGCs. Other synaptic inputs to ipRGC dendrites include cone bipolar cells and rod bipolar cells. ==== Outputs ==== One postsynaptic target of ipRGCs is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which serves as the circadian clock in an organism. ipRGCs release both pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating protein (PACAP) and glutamate onto the SCN via a monosynaptic connection called the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT). Glutamate has an excitatory effect on SCN neurons, and PACAP appears to enhance the effects of glutamate in the hypothalamus. Other post synaptic targets of ipRGCs include: the intergenticulate leaflet (IGL), a cluster of neurons located in the thalamus, which play a role in circadian entrainment; the olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN), a cluster of neurons in the midbrain that controls the pupillary light reflex; the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO), located in the hypothalamus and is a control center for sleep; the amygdala. == Function == === Pupillary light reflex === Inputs and outputs to ipRGCs involved in the pupillary light reflex Using various photoreceptor knockout mice, researchers have identified the role of ipRGCs in both the transient and sustained signaling of the pupillary light reflex (PLR). Transient PLR occurs at dim to moderate light intensities and is a result of phototransduction occurring in rod cells, which provide synaptic input onto ipRGCs, which in turn relay the information to the olivary pretectal nucleus in the midbrain. The neurotransmitter involved in the relay of information to the midbrain from the ipRGCs in the transient PLR is glutamate. At brighter light intensities the sustained PLR occurs, which involves both phototransduction of the rod providing input to the ipRGCs and phototransduction of the ipRGCs themselves via melanopsin. Researchers have suggested that the role of melanopsin in the sustained PLR is due to its lack of adaptation to light stimuli in contrast to rod cells, which exhibit adaptation. The sustained PLR is maintained by PACAP release from ipRGCs in a pulsatile manner. === Possible role in conscious sight === Experiments with rodless, coneless humans allowed another possible role for the receptor to be studied. In 2007, a new role was found for the photoreceptive ganglion cell. Zaidi and colleagues showed that in humans the retinal ganglion cell photoreceptor contributes to conscious sight as well as to non-image-forming functions like circadian rhythms, behaviour and pupillary reactions. Since these cells respond mostly to blue light, it has been suggested that they have a role in mesopic vision and that the old theory of a purely duplex retina with rod (dark) and cone (light) light vision was simplistic. Zaidi and colleagues' work with rodless, coneless human subjects hence has also opened the door into image-forming (visual) roles for the ganglion cell photoreceptor. The discovery that there are parallel pathways for vision was made: one classic rod- and cone-based arising from the outer retina, the other a rudimentary visual brightness detector arising from the inner retina. The latter seems to be activated by light before the former. Classic photoreceptors also feed into the novel photoreceptor system, and colour constancy may be an important role as suggested by Foster. It has been suggested by the authors of the rodless, coneless human model that the receptor could be instrumental in understanding many diseases, including major causes of blindness worldwide such as glaucoma, a disease which affects ganglion cells. In other mammals, photosensitive ganglia have proven to have a genuine role in conscious vision. Tests conducted by Jennifer Ecker et al. found that rats lacking rods and cones were able to learn to swim toward sequences of vertical bars rather than an equally luminescent gray screen. === Violet-to-blue light === Most work suggests that the peak spectral sensitivity of the receptor is between 460 and 484 nm. Lockley et al. in 2003 showed that 460 nm (blue) wavelengths of light suppress melatonin twice as much as 555 nm (green) light, the peak sensitivity of the photopic visual system. In work by Zaidi, Lockley and co-authors using a rodless, coneless human, it was found that a very intense 481 nm stimulus led to some conscious light perception, meaning that some rudimentary vision was realized. == Discovery == In 1923, Clyde E. Keeler observed that the pupils in the eyes of blind mice he had accidentally bred still responded to light. The ability of the rodless, coneless mice to retain a pupillary light reflex was suggestive of an additional photoreceptor cell. In the 1980s, research in rod- and cone- deficient rats showed regulation of dopamine in the retina, a known neuromodulator for light adaptation and photoentrainment. Research continued in 1991, when Russell G. Foster and colleagues, including Ignacio Provencio, showed that rods and cones were not necessary for photoentrainment, the visual drive of the circadian rhythm, nor for the regulation of melatonin secretion from the pineal gland, via rod- and cone-knockout mice. Later work by Provencio and colleagues showed that this photoresponse was mediated by the photopigment melanopsin, present in the ganglion cell layer of the retina. The photoreceptors were identified in 2002 by Samer Hattar, David Berson and colleagues, where they were shown to be melanopsin expressing ganglion cells that possessed an intrinsic light response and projected to a number of brain areas involved in non-image-forming vision. In 2005, Panda, Melyan, Qiu, and colleagues demonstrated that the melanopsin photopigment was the phototransduction pigment in ganglion cells. Dennis Dacey and colleagues showed in a species of Old World monkey that giant ganglion cells expressing melanopsin projected to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Previously only projections to the midbrain (pre-tectal nucleus) and hypothalamus (supra- chiasmatic nuclei, SCN) had been shown. However, a visual role for the receptor was still unsuspected and unproven. == Research == === Research in humans === Attempts were made to hunt down the receptor in humans, but humans posed special challenges and demanded a new model. Unlike in other animals, researchers could not ethically induce rod and cone loss either genetically or with chemicals so as to directly study the ganglion cells. For many years, only inferences could be drawn about the receptor in humans, though these were at times pertinent. In 2007, Zaidi and colleagues published their work on rodless, coneless humans, showing that these people retain normal responses to nonvisual effects of light. The identity of the non-rod, non-cone photoreceptor in humans was found to be a ganglion cell in the inner retina as shown previously in rodless, coneless models in some other mammals. The work was done using patients with rare diseases that wiped out classic rod and cone photoreceptor function but preserved ganglion cell function. Despite having no rods or cones, the patients continued to exhibit circadian photoentrainment, circadian behavioural patterns, melatonin suppression, and pupil reactions, with peak spectral sensitivities to environmental and experimental light that match the melanopsin photopigment. Their brains could also associate vision with light of this frequency. Clinicians and scientists are now seeking to understand the new receptor's role in human diseases and blindness. Intrinsically photosensitive RGCs have also been implicated in the exacerbation of headache by light during migraine attacks. == See also == *Bistratified cell *Melanopsin *Midget cell *Parasol cell *Photoreceptor == References == == External links == * Melanopsin-expressing, Intrinsically Photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells, Webvision, University of Utah, US * ipRGCs Brown University, Rhode Island, US Category:Human eye anatomy Category:Histology Category:Photoreceptor cells Category:Circadian rhythm Category:Visual system Category:Neuroscience ","title":"Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells"},{"id":"2565103","text":"Joana, Princess of Beira (18 September 1635 - 17 November 1653; ; ) was a Portuguese infanta (princess), the eldest surviving daughter of John IV, King of Portugal (the first of the House of Braganza) and his wife Luisa de Guzmán (Luísa de Gusmão), and as such was styled Princess of Beira. ==Life== Joana was born in Vila Viçosa on 18 September 1635.

Since the theorem has now been proven, these are now of mainly historical significance, though the Mirimanoff polynomials are interesting in their own right. The theorem is due to Dmitry Mirimanoff. ==Definition== The nth Mirimanoff polynomial for the prime p is :\\\\phi_n(t) = 1^{n-1}t + 2^{n-1}t^2 + ... + (p-1)^{n-1} t^{p-1}. In terms of these polynomials, if t is one of the six values {-X/Y, -Y/X, -X/Z, -Z/X, -Y/Z, -Z/Y} where Xp+Yp+Zp=0 is a solution to Fermat's Last Theorem, then * φp-1(t) ≡ 0 (mod p) * φp-2(t)φ2(t) ≡ 0 (mod p) * φp-3(t)φ3(t) ≡ 0 (mod p) :... * φ(p+1)/2(t)φ(p-1)/2(t) ≡ 0 (mod p) ==Other congruences== Mirimanoff also proved the following: *If an odd prime p does not divide one of the numerators of the Bernoulli numbers Bp-3, Bp-5, Bp-7 or Bp-9, then the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem, where p does not divide X, Y or Z in the equation Xp+Yp+Zp=0, holds. *If the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem fails for the prime p, then 3p-1 ≡ 1 (mod p2). A prime number with this property is sometimes called a Mirimanoff prime, in analogy to a Wieferich prime which is a prime such that 2p-1 ≡ 1 (mod p2). The existence of primes satisfying such congruences was recognized long before their implications for the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem became apparent; but while the discovery of the first Wieferich prime came after these theoretical developments and was prompted by them, the first instance of a Mirimanoff prime is so small that it was already known before Mirimanoff formulated the connection to FLT in 1910, which fact may explain the reluctance of some writers to use the name. So early as his 1895 paper (p. 298), Mirimanoff alludes to a rather complicated test for the primes now known by his name, deriving from a formula published by Sylvester in 1861, which is of little computational value but great theoretical interest. This test was considerably simplified by Lerch (1905), p. 476, who showed that in general, for p > 3, 3^{p-1} \\\\equiv \\\\left(- \\\\frac 23 \\\\cdot \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ 1 + \\\\frac 12 + \\\\frac 13 + \\\\frac 14 + \\\\ldots + \\\\left\\\\lfloor p/3 \\\\right\\\\rfloor^{-1}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\right)p + 1 \\\\pmod {p^2} so that a prime possesses the Mirimanoff property if it divides the expression within the curly braces. The condition was further refined in an important paper by Emma Lehmer (1938), in which she considered the intriguing and still unanswered question of whether it is possible for a number to satisfy the congruences of Wieferich and Mirimanoff simultaneously. To date, the only known Mirimanoff primes are 11 and 1006003 . The discovery of the second of these appears to be due to K.E. Kloss (1965). ==References== *K.E.

Keaton is a fictional character on the United States television sitcom Family Ties, which aired on NBC for seven seasons, from 1982 to 1989. Family Ties reflected the move in the United States away from the cultural liberalism of the 1960s and 1970s to the conservatism of the 1980s. This was particularly expressed through the relationship between Young Republican Alex (Michael J. Fox) and his hippie parents, Steven (Michael Gross) and Elyse Keaton (Meredith Baxter). President of the United States Ronald Reagan once stated that Family Ties was his favorite television show. ==Character arc== ===Background=== Alex (Michael J. Fox) is the oldest child of Steven and Elyse Keaton (Michael Gross and Meredith Baxter), who were baby boomers and Democrats during the early years of the Presidency of Ronald Reagan. (What his middle initial 'P' stands for is never revealed or discussed.) Married in 1964, Steven, a manager in a local Public Broadcasting Service station, and Elyse, an independent architect, were hippies during the 1960s. According to the episode \\"A Christmas Story\\" in season one, Alex was born in 1965 while his parents were on assignment in Africa, having been influenced by John F. Kennedy to participate in the Peace Corps. Alex has two younger sisters, Mallory (Justine Bateman) and Jennifer (Tina Yothers). Mallory was born while her parents were students at the University of California, Berkeley in 1967, Jennifer was born the night of Richard Nixon's presidential election in 1972, and their brother Andrew was born in 1984. The family lives in suburban Columbus, Ohio. ===Storylines=== At the beginning of the series, Alex is a high-school student who has a passion for economics and wealth. In particular, he is an advocate of supply-side economics. His heroes are Richard Nixon (going so far as to have a lunchbox with Nixon's likeness), William F. Buckley, Jr., Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford, and Milton Friedman. His favorite television show is Wall $treet Week and he is an avid reader of The Wall Street Journal. He also enjoys music of the big band and swing era but secretly enjoys rock music (as seen in the episode \\"A, My Name is Alex\\"). Alex spends the first two seasons of the series preparing to attend Princeton University. While he is attending an on-campus interview, Mallory, who tagged along to pay a surprise visit to her boyfriend, Jeff, who is attending Princeton at the time, has an emotional breakdown when she finds Jeff is seeing another woman. Ultimately, Alex chooses to look after Mallory rather than complete his interview, thus destroying any possibility of attending the university and getting into the Ivy League. Alex receives a scholarship to fictional Leland University, which is located close enough for him to continue to live at home and commute. Keaton excels at Leland, and teaches an economics course as a teaching assistant. Alex holds a disdain for nearby Grant College (which Mallory later attends), and regularly openly mocks their courses. While attending Leland, he has two serious girlfriends. His first is artist/feminist, Ellen Reed (Tracy Pollan, whom Fox later married). After they break up, Keaton pursues a liberal psychology student with feminist inclinations, Lauren Miller, who is played by Courteney Cox. This relationship ends when he has an affair with music major Martie Brodie (played by Jane Adams) while Lauren is out of town. After graduation, Alex accepts a job on Wall Street. ==Reception and influence== Fox in September 1987 The humor of the series focused on a real cultural divide during the 1980s, between the baby boomers and Generation X. According to Stephen Kiehl, this was when the \\"Alex Keaton generation was rejecting the counterculture of the 1960s and embracing the wealth and power that came to define the '80s.\\" While the youngest, Jennifer (an athletic tomboy) shares the values of her parents, Alex and Mallory embrace Reaganomics and consequent conservative values: Alex is a Young Republican and Mallory is a more traditional young woman in contrast to her feminist mother. In the Museum of Broadcast Communications entry for Family Ties, Michael Saenz argues that few shows better demonstrate the resonance between collectively held fictional imagination and what cultural critic Raymond Williams called \\"the structure of feeling\\" of a historical moment than Family Ties. Airing on NBC from 1982 to 1989, this highly successful domestic comedy explored one of the intriguing cultural inversions characterizing the Reagan era: a conservative younger generation aspiring to wealth, business success, and traditional values, serves as inheritor to the politically liberal, presumably activist, culturally experimental generation of adults who had experienced the 1960s. The result was a decade, paradoxical by America's usual post–World War II standards, in which youthful ambition and social renovation became equated with pronounced political conservatism. \\"When else could a boy with a briefcase become a national hero?\\" queried Family Ties' creator, Gary David Goldberg, during the show's final year. In 1999, TV Guide ranked Alex P. Keaton number 17 on its \\"50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time\\" list. ===References in other media=== When Michael J. Fox left his next series, Spin City a decade after Family Ties, his final episodes as a regular (\\"Goodbye: Part 1 & 2\\", Season 4, Episodes 25 and 26) made numerous allusions to Family Ties. Michael Gross (Alex's father Steven) portrays Michael Patrick Flaherty's (Michael J. Fox) therapist and there is a reference to the therapist's unseen receptionist named \\"Mallory\\".Shales, Tom. \\"Michael J. Fox, Playing 'Spin City' to a Fare-Thee-Well\\". The Washington Post, May 24, 2000, p. C1. After Flaherty becomes an environmental lobbyist in Washington, he makes a reference to having met the junior senator from Ohio, Alex P. Keaton. Actress Meredith Baxter, who played Alex Keaton's mother on Family Ties, also played Michael Flaherty's mother on Spin City. Florida ska/punk band Victims of Circumstance's debut album Roll the Dice featured a track titled \\"Me and Alex P. Keaton\\". The lyrics parody a typical day spent with a modern, socially conservative Republican. LFO's 1999 single \\"Summer Girls\\" name-checks \\"Alex P. Keaton\\" alongside many other cultural references. In the Family Guy episode \\"Movin' Out (Brian's Song)\\", after Brian gets dumped by Jillian when he admits he did not want to move in with her, Stewie tries to help him get over her by comparing the situation to when Alex P. Keaton lost his own girlfriend before getting another one. In the second episode of the first season of Broad City, when offered \\"a few pages from [his] dad's prescription pad,\\" by a young boy, Abbi refers to him as Alex P. Keaton. During the seventh episode of the third season of Stranger Things, under the influence of \\"truth serum\\", Steve Harrington mistakenly refers to Marty McFly, another character played by Michael J. Fox, as Alex P. Keaton while trying to understand the plot of Back to the Future. ==References== ==Sources== * * Goldberg, Gary David. \\"Comedy Stop: What Would Alex Keaton Do?\\" The New York Times, March 3, 2008. * Haglund, David. \\"Reagan's Favorite Sitcom: How Family Ties spawned a conservative hero\\".

Hosted by Jolina Magdangal. The segment hosts are the StarStruck graduates with Mark Herras, Jennylyn Mercado, Rainier Castillo, Yasmien Kurdi, Nadine Samonte, Dion Ignacio, Christian Esteban, Katrina Halili, Tyron Perez, Sheena Halili, Jade Lopez, Anton dela Paz, Cristine Reyes and Alvin Aragon. They serve the junior hopefuls as they go through every phase of the competition, it premiered on March 20, 2004. The council was composed of Christopher de Leon (multi-awarded actor), Janice de Belen (multi-awarded actress) and Aiza Seguerra (a former child, star turned musician). The season ended with 72 episodes on June 26, 2004, having Kurt Perez and Sam Bumatay as the junior Ultimate Survivors. ==Overview== The junior spin-off season of StarStruck was first announced by the hosts Dingdong Dantes and Nancy Castiglione after the season finale. This was an offshoot of the successful senior season, also announced on GMA Network program SOP, where the hosts invited kids from 5 to 7 years old to audition for the upcoming season. Most of the auditions were held at the GMA Network's headquarters and at SM Supermalls throughout the Philippines. The pilot episode was aired on March 20, 2004. Like the senior version, the same rules were applied in selecting the Ultimate Survivors. This junior version of StarStruck is shown only on weekdays; Mondays to Thursdays would be tests and Fridays would be the elimination night. It became an emotional journey for the kids who had to leave the show. Nonetheless, they thoroughly enjoyed the workshops. The show held it's the Final Judgment on June 26, 2004, at the Aliw Theater. ==Selection process== In the spin-off year of the reality-talent search, out of hundreds who auditioned nationwide, only the top 100 were chosen for the first cut. From the top 100, it was trimmed down to the top 60, then to the top 30, and at last to the final 14 finalists. The Final 14K underwent various workshops and training in order to develop their personalities, talents, and charisma. Every week, one or two hopefuls from the junior final 14 may have to say goodbye until only four remain. Those who were eliminated were dubbed as the juniors StarStruck Avengers. The Final 4K will vie for the coveted the junior Ultimate Survivors titles, the juniors Ultimate Male Survivor and Ultimate Female Survivor, both of them would receive P1,000,000 pesos each plus an exclusive management contract from GMA Network. The juniors Runners-up, both of them would receive P100,000 pesos each plus an exclusive management contract from the network. The juniors StarStruck Avengers (the losing contestants) also received an exclusive contract from the network. ==Hopefuls== When the juniors Final 14K was chosen, they are assigned to different challenges every week that will show their acting, singing, and dancing abilities. Every Friday, one is meant to leave the competition until there were just six others who are left. From juniors’ survivor six, there will be two of them who will be eliminated and after the elimination of the two; the juniors final four will be revealed.

Sobel Sr. (26 January 1912 – 30 September 1987)\\"United States Social Security Death Index,\\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:J21V-LML : 20 May 2014), Herbert M Sobel, 30 Sep 1987; citing U.S. Social Security Administration, Death Master File, database (Alexandria, Virginia: National Technical Information Service, ongoing). was an American commissioned officer with Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, in the 101st Airborne Division during World War II. Sobel was portrayed in the HBO miniseries Band of Brothers by David Schwimmer. ==Early life and education== Sobel was born in Chicago, Illinois, to a Jewish family. He attended the Culver Military Academy in Indiana. He was a clothing salesman. He graduated from the University of Illinois, majoring in architecture. ==Military career== Sobel enlisted in the Army on 7 March 1941 and volunteered for the paratroopers. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant. Promoted to first lieutenant, Sobel commanded Company E for all of their basic training at Camp Toccoa, Georgia. He trained his men intensely, and was eventually promoted to the rank of captain in recognition of his ability as a trainer. However, Sobel was despised by his soldiers for being petty and vindictive. After a period of training in the United Kingdom before the Normandy invasion, Captain Sobel was reassigned from command of Easy Company to command the jump school at Chilton Foliat. First Lieutenant Thomas Meehan replaced Sobel, and was one of several officers (including Richard Winters) to succeed him in that post before the end of the war. Sobel jumped into Normandy and earned a Combat Infantryman Badge as part of Regimental Headquarters Company. Sobel was assigned as the regimental S-4 (logistics) officer on 8 March 1945. ==Later life and death== Sobel returned to the United States in 1945, and was honorably discharged from the Army on 18 March 1946. He worked as an accountant before being recalled to active duty during the Korean War. He remained in the Army National Guard, eventually retiring at the rank of lieutenant colonel. He later married and had three children. In 1970, Sobel shot himself in the head with a small-caliber pistol in an attempted suicide. The bullet entered his left temple, passed behind his eyes, and exited the other side of his head. This severed his optic nerves and left him blind. Soon afterward, he began living at a VA assisted-living facility in Waukegan, Illinois. He died there of malnutrition on 30 September 1987. No memorial services were held for him. ==Legacy== Sobel was portrayed as a petty and capricious martinet in the television series Band of Brothers, generating much debate. Stephen Ambrose gives numerous examples of this in his book. Since the series, his son Michael Sobel has spoken out on his behalf. In interviews, some Easy Company veterans have acknowledged the part Sobel's training played in the company's later successes. Writing of him in their autobiographies, he is recalled with little fondness by fellow officers, who regarded him as a dilettante in the practical matters of ground combat, particularly due to his pronounced lack of understanding of common infantry field craft such as land navigation and basic infantry combat tactics, as well as a refusal to listen to the advice of fellow officers or NCOs. ==Honors and awards== *60px Combat Infantryman Badge *Parachutist Badge *60px Bronze Star *60px American Defense Service Medal *60px American Campaign Medal *60px European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal *60px World War II Victory Medal *60px National Defense Service Medal ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * ==External links== * *The Unvarnished Truth About Captain Herbert Sobel Category:1912 births Category:1987 deaths Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:Band of Brothers characters Category:People from Chicago Category:Military personnel from Illinois Category:United States Army officers Category:University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign alumni Category:American Jews Category:Operation Overlord people Category:Jewish American military personnel Category:Culver Academies alumni ","title":"Herbert Sobel"},{"id":"2565193","text":"{ +SS William Clay Ford } SS William Clay Ford was a bulk freighter built for hauling material on the Great Lakes.

The ship was a part of the Ford Motor Company fleet of ore carriers and made her home port at Ford's River Rouge Plant, south of Detroit, Michigan.

Because of the bravery and valor demonstrated that night by Captain Don Erickson and his crew, they were presented with many accolades including a plaque bestowed upon them by the Great Lakes Maritime Institute recognizing their role in the search for Edmund Fitzgerald. It reads: In 1979 the hull of William Clay Ford was lengthened 120 feet. In 1984 ownership was transferred to the Rouge Steel Corporation. In December 1984, she hauled her last load of cargo from Duluth, Minnesota to Rouge Basin, south of Detroit. In 1985 she was renamed US 266029, her registry number, as a newly renamed SS William Clay Ford (2) was put into the fleet. In August 1986, US 266029 was towed from her moorings to the Detroit Marine Terminal where the pilot house was removed for display and exhibition, at the Dossin Great Lakes Museum on Detroit's Belle Isle.

Born in London, England, Nathan was one of two MPs elected to represent the British Columbia riding of Victoria in the Canadian general election of 1872. They had won by acclamation special byelections held the year before to fill the newly created House of Commons seats upon British Columbia's admission to Confederation (in those byelections the riding was named Victoria District). The other representative for Victoria was B.C.'s Father of Confederation, Amor De Cosmos who was simultaneously Premier of that province until 1874. The third-place also-ran was Robert Beaven, who was to become the sixth Premier of British Columbia ten years later. The son of Henry Nathan, Nathan was educated at the London University School and became a wholesale merchant in Victoria, British Columbia. He represented Victoria City in the assembly of the United Colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia from 1870 to 1871. Like De Cosmos, Nathan was part of British Columbia's delegation to Ottawa to negotiate the terms of B.C.'s entry into Confederation. Once in Parliament, Nathan supported the government of Sir John A. Macdonald. This strained his relationship with De Cosmos, who had become a supporter of MacDonald's opponent, Liberal Alexander Mackenzie. As a result, Nathan took to calling de Cosmos \\"Cupid\\" in private letters (de Cosmos' name roughly translates to \\"Lover of the Universe\\"). The byelection of 1871 was held to return members from newly admitted British Columbia to the 1st Parliament of Canada that had been elected four years earlier following Confederation. With Nathan joining that Parliament, the multicultural nature of the Canadian nation was firmly established. In 1876, Nathan returned to England.

The genus consists of 17 described species, 7 of which are native to the Neotropics and about 10 are native to tropical Asia. They are commonly named hog plums, Spanish plums, libas in Bikol and in some cases golden apples for their brightly colored fruit which resemble an apple or small plum at a casual glance. They are only distantly related to apple and plum trees, however. A more unequivocal common name is mombins.

The company sells consumer electronics and white goods, along with related products and services, and pioneered the concept of the out-of-town discount warehouse in the United Kingdom. Before its collapse, it was the UK's second biggest electrical retailer, with 6,000 staff and over 200 stores. The company was formed in 1933 by George Hollingbery as a business charging batteries for customers on a weekly basis. The business grew and diversified into radio rentals, and the first store opened in the 1950s. Comet expanded during the 1960s and 1970s, and became a publicly listed company in 1972. The company was purchased by Woolworths, owned by Paternoster Stores (later Kingfisher plc) in 1984. In 2003, Comet was spun out of Kingfisher Group to become part of Kesa. In 2011, following sustained losses, Kesa sold the company to private equity firm OpCapita for a token £2. The firm entered administration in November 2012, and all stores and their stock were liquidated and closed by 18 December. In 2019, UK Computer Group announced the acquisition of the Comet brand and has relaunched Comet as an online retailer of electrical goods. ==History== ===Early years (1933–58)=== Comet was founded in Hull in 1933 by entrepreneur George Hollingbery as Comet Battery Stores. Hollingbery had noticed the increasing popularity of the wireless radio during the 1930s and launched a service which involved himself and one other employee charging batteries in his workshop and delivering them to customers for a small weekly fee. By 1939, the service had expanded, to around 2,500 customers and a small fleet of vans was required for the deliveries. As customer demand grew for replacement wireless sets, Hollingbery renamed the business to Comet Radio Services and began providing a radio rental service. Comet's first retail store was opened in George Street, Hull in the 1950s. Two more stores were subsequently opened in Bridlington and Driffield. George Hollingbery died in 1958, aged 55, and his son Michael took control of the business. ===Pioneering the discount warehouse (1968–69)=== In 1964, the Resale Prices Act was passed in the United Kingdom, rendering all resale price agreements 'against the public interest' unless proven otherwise. Minimum resale price maintenance (MRPM) had ensured that retailers such as Comet could only sell a product at a price determined by the manufacturer. The abolition of MRPM allowed Comet to make the transition from a small electrical retail chain in Yorkshire to a national discount retailer. In 1968, Comet opened its first out-of-town retail store in Hull, offering a range of 50 radio and television products. Alan Sugar, the founder of Amstrad, said later that the opening of this discount warehouse \\"changed the face of retailing.\\" The business was predominantly mail order although members of the public were also able to purchase from the warehouse in person. Comet placed full page advertisements in specialist magazines and newspapers, listing their stock and the prices, which were between 15% and 45% lower than the manufacturers' recommended retail prices. One such advertisement in The Yorkshire Post resulted in customers \\"queueing around the block.\\" Sugar said: \\"This form of retailing signalled the demise of the small electrical shop on the street corner, which simply couldn't compete.\\" Initially, Comet was the only major retailer offering electrical equipment at heavily discounted prices, and the largest share of its business remained mail order. When competitors such as the G. W. Smith and Laskys chains also began to offer discounted equipment, Comet was compelled to begin opening its own branches nationwide. Comet eventually purchased the Laskys chain outright for £8.9 million in 1989. In 1969, a second discount warehouse was opened in Leeds, and the company was renamed Comet Radiovision Services. ===Expansion and flotation (1971–73)=== Between February 1971 and July 1972, another seven discount warehouses were opened, including outlets in Edinburgh and Birmingham. A further nine warehouses were expected to be operational by May 1973. Total sales from their warehouses rose from £308,000 from 1968 to 1969, to £5.3 million from 1970 to 1971. Despite the success of its out-of-town warehouse operations, Comet continued to maintain a presence on the high street, assisted by the consumer boom of the early 1970s (\\"the Barber Boom\\"), the introduction of hire purchase facilities, and the growth in the purchase and rental of colour television sets. Comet also traded on its after-sales service, a twice-weekly nationwide delivery service, and its ability to undercut most competitors by around 10%. Goods were sold with 12 months' free service, including parts and labour, and Comet guaranteed that it would beat \\"any genuine advertised price\\" for brand new items. In July 1972, Comet went public with an initial offering of 4.7 million shares at 110p. Michael Hollingbery revealed that inheritance tax had been one of the reasons for the flotation, saying: \\"If a death had occurred in the family we could have lost control or faced considerable financial problems.\\" By November 1973, Comet had established 25 discount warehouses in Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Grimsby, Hull, Jarrow, Leeds, Leicester, London, Norwich, Newport, Nottingham, Oxford, Reading, Rochdale, Sheffield, Southampton, Stockton-on-Tees, Sunderland, Wigan and Willenhall. ===Budget booms and busts (1974–76)=== The business was impacted badly in 1974 by the three-day week, tighter government controls on hire purchase and consumer credit, and the knock-on effect of a worldwide shortage of steel and plastic. Relying on fast turnover to compensate for reduced margins (typically the company operated with only a 2% pre-tax margin), Comet was particularly vulnerable to any slump in consumer activity. Where previously it had been able to sell goods \\"so quickly that they are gone before the manufacturers' invoice has to be met\\" Comet now found itself having to dramatically revise its sales forecasts and reassess its orders. Competition from longer-established department stores and high street multiples was also growing, as Currys opened two discount warehouses (under the trading name Bridger Discount), followed by Great Universal Stores and Rediffusion. In September 1974, the group sold its television rental business to Spectra Rentals for £1.73 million, in an effort to reduce its overall debt. In 1975, Comet expanded its range of goods by purchasing the share capital of Gas Trend, a discount retailer of gas appliances, for £15,000. This placed Comet as the only large multiple retailer of gas appliances to compete against the nationalised British Gas Corporation which accounted for around 80% of the market. In April 1975, the electrical retail sector underwent a mini boom, following that month's budget announcement, that electrical appliances would be subject to a 25% VAT levy beginning 1 May 1975, a substantial increase from the previous rate of 8%. Although Comet reported sales increases of up to 600% in some of its warehouses, Michael Hollingbery warned that the group would be maintaining only the minimum working stock from 1 May onwards. Predicting an overall slump in sales of 50% he said: \\"[After 1 May] there will be a sales trough. What has been happening in the past week has been that people have merely brought forward the purchase they had planned to make later in the year or have realised that certain types of goods that they can afford now may be later out of their grasp.\\" When the levy was reduced the following year to 12.5%, Comet benefited from the corresponding brisk upturn in trade, describing sales as \\"bumper.\\" Despite the fall in profits, during the 1975–1976 period, Comet continued with its expansion plans, opening new outlets across the country. By December 1976, the group had grown to 50 outlets, with plans to increase this to 100 by December 1977. In July 1976, Comet acquired the Eclipse Radio and Television Services chain from Loyds Retail, a subsidiary of Philips. Consumer fears of an emergency autumn budget and changes to the Minimum Lending Rate drove Comet's sales to 15% above predictions in late 1976. ===Bids and buy-out (1981–84)=== In June 1981 the Hollingbery family began to reduce its shareholdings in Comet. Valued at £51 million, the group now included 200 Comet Electrical and Timberland Do-It-Yourself outlets, a jewellery manufacturer and a supplier of Polarcold metal pressings for domestic appliance manufacturers. The family disposed of 8 million shares, raising £9.92 million. Michael Hollingbery explained: \\"Too much of the family wealth was concentrated in one company.\\" In April 1984 Harris Queensway announced that it was finalising \\"an agreed bid\\" of £152 million for the Comet group. The following day, Woolworths (then owned by Paternoster Stores, forerunner of Kingfisher) announced that it had made a £177 million counter-bid, which had been accepted. Hollingbery retained the Comet chair after the sale, which took place in May 1984. ===Hostile takeover bid for Dixons (1989–90)=== In December 1989, Kingfisher announced a £461 million hostile takeover bid for Dixons. Dixons had acquired Currys in 1984, and Kingfisher said that if the bid was successful it would retain both brand names along with Comet. Dixons retaliated by preparing a submission to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) stating that a merger of Comet, Currys and Dixons would create a monopoly in out-of-town retail parks. Stanley Kalms, Dixons' chairman, said: \\"[This] is about a virtual monopoly in retail parks, the fastest growing sector of the business. Out-of-town there are only two competitors, Currys and Comet.\\" Kingfisher claimed that the combined market share of Currys, Dixons and Comet would only represent 22%, below the threshold of 25% which would trigger an investigation by the Monopolies and Merger Commission (MMC), while market researchers assessed the combined share as 26%. On 16 January 1990 Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley announced that Kingfisher's bid had been referred to the MMC. He said that the combined market share would have been just under 25% but would have been four times larger than its nearest competitor, Rumbelows. For some products, including personal stereos, microwave ovens and dishwashers, the market share rose to between 30% and 40%. Ridley said that in the out-of-town sector, the combined group would control 70–80% of the market. There was also concern that the combined group's buying power \\"would allow it to gain substantial discounts from manufacturers but the lack of competition would mean it would not be under pressure to pass discounts on to the consumer.\\" On 4 May 1990, the independent market research group Verdict published a report warning that the proposed merger would lead to higher prices and that the dominant position of the combined group would result in the public paying \\"for the strategic errors made by Britain's leading electrical retailers in the 1980s.\\" The MMC blocked the merger in May 1990.The report had been erroneously placed on sale in government stationery offices at 9am on 23 May, a full day earlier than Ridley's expected announcement. Traders in Dixons shares were able to take advantage for almost four hours until the Stock Exchange suspended trading in both Dixons and Kingfisher. It was decided that this did not constitute insider trading as \\"the report had been published, albeit in error.\\" () ===Recession and consumer crisis (1990–97)=== Pontefract, West Yorkshire. In November 1990, following the merger of British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB) and Sky Television to form BSkyB, Comet issued a High Court writ seeking £10 million in damages from BSkyB for breach of contract. Comet alleged that it had a contract with BSB to supply BSB's satellite dishes and receiving equipment – of which Comet had already sold 17,000 units, with several thousand still in stock – which were now obsolete as Sky's equipment, which retailed for £100 less, was being used for all future customers. In January 1995, market analysts began sounding warnings over the viability of Comet and its sister group Woolworths. Comet had made strategic errors with its home computer business, and its decision to stop selling computer games had allowed competitors to corner the market. Trading at a loss, and with considerable leasehold commitments, analysts suggested that both Comet and Woolworths, with \\"weak retail strategies\\" of \\"cheap and cheerful\\", might be sold by Kingfisher. Kingfisher's chairman Sir Geoff Mulcahy, described their performance as \\"unsatisfactory\\" and said \\"We have got two problem areas, Woolworths and Comet.\\" John Richardson, an analyst at NatWest bank, warned that \\"very substantial rationalisation and reorganisation\\" was required at Comet. By April 1996, Dixons controlled a market share three times larger than Comet's. In October 1996, Kingfisher bought out the struggling electrical retailer NORWEB for £29 million, and merged it with Comet.An earlier, higher, offer had been made by Kingfisher but Norweb rejected this and held out for more. Shortly after, when Norweb began offering 0% interest finance, Comet did not follow suit and directed customers who inquired about finance to use Norweb instead. The resulting cost of the 0% promotion \\"crippled\\" Norweb, which then accepted an offer from Kingfisher lower than that initially offered. () As part of its plan to integrate the two store groups, Comet closed 26 of its own stores and 28 Norweb stores, resulting in 1,200 redundancies. ===The Wal-Mart effect (1999–2000)=== In April 1999, Kingfisher attempted a merger with Asda, but was subsequently outbid by Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer. The £6.7 billion acquisition \\"sent a ripple of fear through United Kingdom stores.\\" Kingfisher responded by appointing Joe Riordon, former vice-president of Wal-Mart's people division, as managing director of Comet. Riordan oversaw the launch of a £2 million, 30,000 ft2 (2,787 m2) Comet store in Paisley, described as \\"the blueprint to transform the industry.\\" In effect a carbon copy of Wal-Mart's retail strategy, the move was an attempt to \\"beat Wal-Mart at its own game... before it has a chance to turn its guns on Comet's sector.\\" Riordan left the company abruptly in April 2000. In July 2000, Wal-Mart, in what The Times described as \\"the opening shots in the assault on its British counterparts,\\" announced that it would be discounting some goods by up to 60%. The stock market value of British chain stores fell by around £700 million within days of the announcement. ===KESA Electricals (2000–06)=== In September 2000 Kingfisher revealed its plan to demerge into two listed companies, separating the \\"poorly performing\\" Comet and B&Q; groups (provisionally called New Kingfisher) from the Superdrug, Woolworths and Big W chains (General Merchandise). The demerger of the electricals business, including Comet and French chains Darty and BUT, delayed in part by \\"indecision and management infighting,\\" eventually took place in July 2003, with the group renamed KESA Electricals. The name originated from Kingfisher Electricals with the SA taken from Société Anonyme, the French equivalent of plc. The rapid growth of online shopping during the period 2000–2003 had surprised many analysts. A 2000 report, published by the United Kingdom's Department of Trade and Industry, \\"Clicks and Mortar: The New Store Fronts,\\" had forecast that United Kingdom online shopping for 2002 could range from £1.2 billion to an optimistic £6.3 billion. The actual figure for 2002 was £7 billion. During 2001–02, e-commerce electrical retailer dabs.com made sales of £116 million, which one analyst pointed out was the equivalent trade of 25 Comet stores. As dabs.com employed only 185 staff, this was described as \\"a rate of productivity which the mainstream retailer can only dream about.\\" Although Comet and other retailers established their own websites e-tailers were still able to undercut them because direct shipping of the goods from warehouses to customers cut out the need for large stores, infrastructure and sales staff. In January 2005, Comet faced increasing pressure, when Tesco announced it would trial non-food stores, retailing electrical goods, CDs and DVDs. Trade magazine Retail Week warned that Tesco would launch a \\"ferocious assault on the market for digital cameras and music players,\\" one of the few growth areas in the sector. In September 2005, Comet posted a second quarter loss of £3.3 million. Jean-Noel Labroue, KESA's chief executive, said: \\"Trading across our core markets since the end of July has not improved. In view of the continuing decline in consumer confidence across all our markets, we do not anticipate any changes to these conditions in the immediate future.\\" A management buy-out negotiation reached \\"an advanced stage\\" but was ultimately abandoned. A£1.7 billion takeover bid which was made for KESA in 2006. KESA would not confirm the identity of the bidders when they announced that the offer had been rejected on the grounds that it \\"undervalued the company and its prospects.\\" ===Global economic crisis (2007–12)=== In the late 2000s, Comet experimented with High Street branches such as this on Briggate in Leeds. They were closed shortly afterwards. In September 2007, at the beginning of the financial crisis, KESA warned that its prospects in the United Kingdom were \\"uncertain\\" as the credit crunch and higher interest rates could lead to consumers cutting back their spending on new electrical products. Analysts at Landsbanki said: \\"[W]e see serious long run threats to electrical retailing from the growth of the internet, the proliferation of competition and the resultant downward pressure on prices and margins.\\" A Comet branch next to rivals Currys in Guiseley, West Yorkshire. In June 2009, KESA posted a pre tax loss of £81.8 million in the 12 months to 30 April 2009, compared to a profit of £128.8 million in the previous year. Over the same period, Comet's retail profit fell by 76.5% to £10.1 million. In April 2010, United States-based Best Buy, the world's largest electrical goods retailer, opened its first store in Thurrock, Essex, with a plan to open one hundred out-of-town warehouses over the following four years. In September 2010, a new logo was launched, similar to the previous logo, but \\"softer\\" in design. The Comet name was in lowercase, and accompanied by a new strapline, \\"Come and Play\\". The branding aimed to project a more fun and friendly image, and customers were encouraged to come into the store to try out interactive displays. Higher taxes, wage freezes and the rising cost of food and essential purchases combined to keep consumer spending on discretionary purchases low and in June 2011 Comet posted a loss – its first in 16 years – of £8.9 million. The \\"brutal consumer recession\\" had, said retail analyst Neil Saunders, left the market \\"in quite a steep decline and with consumers not buying in the way they had the previous decade.\\" In November 2011, in the same week that Best Buy announced that it was closing its eleven United Kingdom stores due to \\"tough conditions,\\" KESA announced that it had sold Comet to investment firm OpCapita for a nominal £2. KESA would also provide a £46.8 million 'dowry' of working capital, and retain all the pension liabilities for employees on pre-existing defined benefit schemes. Two weeks before the firm entered administration, OpCapita announced they were exploring options to sell the chain, after only twelve months of ownership. ==Administration and closure== On 1 November 2012, Comet announced it was filing for administration, and entered administration the following day. Deloitte were appointed to act as administrators for the chain. A spokesman said: \\"The board is urgently working with its advisers to seek a solution to secure a viable future for the company.\\" This followed a period of \\"increasing pressure\\" from suppliers who insisted the retailer pay in advance for stock before the Christmas trading period. After the announcement, the Comet website became unavailable to visitors until 3 November 2012, when a liquidation sale promotion was published. The new website gave details of store locations, but the e-commerce system was no longer available. On 8 November 2012, at 09:00, Comet stores started their final liquidation stock sale. Also, as of 8 November, Comet was accepting again all of its own gift cards excluding corporate customers. On 17 November 2012, administrators appointed for Comet announced that at least 41 out of the retailer's 236 stores would be closed, if they failed to sign any potential buyer to take them over by end of the month. The announcement immediately triggered closing sales in 27 of the outlets and 14 others were awaiting closing sales. Up to 500 Comet employees were not reported to be directly affected in the 27 stores with closing sales. The closures continued over the next month, until there were no stores remaining open by the end of December 2012.http://www.retail- week.com/sectors/electricals/comet-stores-shuttered-as-hopes-for-buyer- fade/5044032.article In June 2014, former staff, represented by the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers and the United Road Transport Union, won an Employment Tribunal case that they had not been consulted properly about redundancy by Comet and the administrators, Deloitte. This enabled about 7,000 former staff to apply for redundancy financial assistance. Accounting records suggested that the owners, including OpCapita and Elliott Advisors, recovered about £117 million from Comet, and administration fees were more than £10 million. Three administrators from Deloitte were referred to the accountancy regulator by the Insolvency Service over the failure to consult properly about redundancy, which led to government costs of about £26 million for redundancy payments. ==Successor== The UK Computer Group bought the rights to the Comet brand and the website from the liquidators Deloitte in December 2019. In July 2020, they promised a relaunch on social media. In August 2020 the Comet website was relaunched as a trading name of Misco Technologies. All former Comet stores remain closed and there are no known plans to reopen any physical locations. ==ReferencesCategory:Consumer electronics retailers of the United Kingdom Category:Companies based in Kingston upon Hull Category:Retail companies of the United Kingdom Category:Retail companies established in 1933 Category:Defunct retail companies of the United Kingdom Category:Retail companies disestablished in 2012 Category:British companies established in 1933 Category:British companies disestablished in 2012 Category:Companies that have entered administration in the United Kingdom Category:1984 mergers and acquisitions Category:2003 mergers and acquisitions Category:2011 mergers and acquisitions ","title":"Comet Group"},{"id":"2565283","text":"is a Japanese television variety series that aired on HTB in Hokkaidō, Japan, and on other regional television stations in Japan. The program debuted on HTB on October 9, 1996. The series was one of the first local variety programs to be produced on Hokkaido; prior to this series' launch, local variety programs in Hokkaidō were virtually non-existent. The program also had a significant influence on other local programs in other regions in Japan, most notably Kwangaku! in Kansai and Nobunaga in Tokai. The series achieved a record 18.6% viewing share on December 8, 1999, the highest share for a late-night program on a local TV station. Production of the weekly regular series ended in September 2002, though new limited-run series were produced on average of every 18 months; the latest series was shown on HTB in late 2005, eight episodes in length. Most of the series have been rerun under the names of Dōdeshō Returns and Suiyō Dōdeshō Classic. ==Cast and staff== ===Regular cast members=== *Takayuki Suzui (鈴井 貴之), actor and film director, also in charge of planning and composition. *Yō Ōizumi (大泉 洋), actor and singer. **Ōizumi, now a famous actor, was an unknown college student when the program started. ===Production Staff=== *Tadahisa Fujimura (藤村 忠寿), a director at HTB, who also narrates the show and frequently interacts with the cast as an off-screen voice, but in some episodes, he appears on screen and performs pretty much like a cast member. *Masamichi Ureshino (嬉野 雅道), a director at HTB, who also films the show on a portable video camera. He has a very quiet personality but would occasionally provide some humorous moments as the show's \\"straight man\\". ===Semi-regular cast members=== *Ken Yasuda (安田 顕), actor, who makes frequent appearances inside a full-body suit of HTB's mascot, On-chan *Takuma Otoo (音尾琢磨), actor, who makes appearances inside a full-body suit of HTB's mascot, No-chan *Hiroyuki Morizaki (森崎博之), actor *Shigeyuki Sato (佐藤重幸), actor, the only member of TEAM-NACS who didn't appear in any episodes, but in the opening and ending of some episodes. ==Format== Suiyo Dodesho is considered a travel TV program, but most of the show consists of humorous dialogue and antics by the two cast members (with the occasional participation of Fujimura) while in transit, usually in response to the tough situations they encounter; hardly any time is spent at the \\"destinations\\". A typical travel episode consists of Oizumi being tricked into visiting a distant location that serves as the starting point of that episode's journey, which he refers to as being \\"kidnapped\\". Oizumi, lacking sense of direction or distance, often does not realize that he's being taken to the Sapporo airport until the crew arrives at the terminal. ==Some selected episodes== ===Journey on a Dice: From Tokyo to Sapporo=== \\"You have to go wherever the dice tells you to.\\" One of the most popular serial episodes in the program. 7 series produced during the run of the show. A typical series begins by the cast and crew in Tokyo, often with Oizumi being \\"kidnapped\\" and not knowing the nature of the activities planned for the episode being videotaped. The intent is to return to Sapporo from Tokyo stopping at multiple locations along the way, but at each location (including the starting point), they are faced with 6 choices of destinations, coupled with a means of public transportation, which the cast chooses by rolling a die. The rule is that the cast and crew must go to the destination determined by the dice, even if the direction or the means of transportation are unfavorable. They also have to continue moving day and night until they return to Sapporo unless the outcome of the dice throw allows them to stay overnight. Due to the limited production budget and time, overnight stays are seldom included as a choice and overnight buses (\\"shinya buses\\") are frequently used, leading to many tough situations for the cast and crew (but hilarious for the viewers). In the course of the show, the cast often gets the worst choice possible among the 6 destination/transportation choices. Of the two, Suzui tends to roll the worst choices, to which Oizumi occasionally responds by shouting \\"You Loser (Dame-Ningen)!\\". The humor comes from the cast's (and sometimes the crew's) emotional reaction and dialogue arising out of the tough situations encountered on the less desirable means of transportation. ===Journey on the Country Signs of 212 Municipalities in Hokkaidō=== Another popular series in earlier years. Suzui and Ōizumi travel their motherland, Hokkaidō, visiting each municipalities one by one, 212 in total at the time. To choose where to visit, however, they randomly pick a card. Each card has country signs (logo signs for tourists) representing each municipality, and they have to visit there. If they pick a card showing the sign of the town in southern Hokkaidō, then they have to go there even if they are 400 km away in northern Hokkaidō. When Ōizumi heard the concept for the first time, naturally, he replied \\"It's nothing different from the Journey on a Dice!\\". ===Tokyo Walker=== The episode title is a reference to Tokyo Walker, a famous town magazine. This time, Ōizumi was given a chance to choose any place he wants to go by himself, as long as it's within Tokyo. What he did not know, however, is the fact that they have to go all the places on foot. ===Plunging the Arctic: 620 miles in Alaskan Peninsula=== Suzui wanted to see aurora for a long time. This time they go to Alaska and rent a camper, drive to Coldfoot, a settlement where aurora appears. However, they cannot see aurora at all until the last day, leaving their last hope on Coldfoot. ===Tōhoku Living Hell Tour, Three Days and Two Nights=== There was a group tour for the fans of the program, makes them visit Tōhoku region that had been introduced in earlier episodes. Following the tour, Suzui and Ōizumi want to meet their fellow fans, but they fear the panic made by their appearance. Because of that, they try approaching fans in disguise. ===Journey on Picture Postcards, All Japan=== This time, they pick a picture postcard, and go to the place which the picture shows, trying to take exactly the same picture. ===The Longest Cooking Show in Japan: Chef Ōizumi, Summer Vegetable Special=== Throughout the show Ōizumi insists he is a good cook and has cooked for the cast and crew on many occasions, although he takes an unbearably long time to cook them, and the resulting dishes are often inedible. In this episode, much fun is made of Oizumi's self-delusions about his cooking skills by setting him up in a \\"cooking show\\" in which \\"the chef\\" Ōizumi is asked to cook with fresh summer vegetables. However there are multiple catches in this show; Ōizumi must first cultivate a patch of overgrown grassland to plant summer vegetables and then has to make the dishes to serve them from clay on a potter's wheel, resulting in a months-long \\"cooking show\\". This show brought out much emotional outbursts from Ōizumi and the dialogue between the frustrated Ōizumi and the other 3 are the most hilarious. ===Quiz! Dōdeshō to be on the Test=== \\"Educational Program\\" broadcast on college entrance exam season. Ōizumi has to answer the questions used for real college entrance exams, related to Japanese geography. When he makes a mistake, he has to go to the place of the right answer. For instance, if he could not answer the question \\"What is the name of the landscape in Akiyoshidō, Yamaguchi?\\", then he has to go to Akiyoshidō. ===Shikoku Pilgrimage 88 Temples, the Complete Conquest=== Ōizumi and the directors have to visit all the 88 temples of Shikoku Pilgrimage route within 4 or 5 days. Which means they have to drive all the time, on narrow and curvy roads of Shikoku. *3 series produced during the run of the show, and in every series some strange phenomenon or troubles occur.

Ōizumi is delighted until Fujimua tells him that Suzui and he has to ride the mopeds all the way back to Sapporo within 72 hours, otherwise they will be faced with a penalty.

The park is in Jamesville, NY, in the Town of DeWitt, south of Syracuse. It was the site of a large waterfall formed by melting glacial ice at the end of the last Ice Age; the plunge basin at the base of the old falls is now a small lake. James Macfarlane described the area in 1879, \\"On approaching the lake from the turnpike on the south side, the tourist is startled at finding himself, without any notice, on the brink of a yawning gulf, precisely like that of the Niagara River below the Falls, and nearly as deep.\\" Clark Reservation is also noted for its many ferns; it harbors the largest population in the U.S. of American hart's tongue, which is so rare that it was declared endangered in the U.S. in 1989. The park is in size, and logs about 80,000 visitors per year. It encompasses the cliff, plunge basin and gorge of the ancient waterfall, and a number of secondary ravines and basins. Glacier Lake, which occupies the plunge basin of the former waterfall, is in size and deep; it is a rare meromictic lake in which the deep waters don't mix annually with the surface waters. The chemocline, below which the lake's waters are unmixed, is about 12.5 m below the surface. Only the bottom 4 m of depth are in the \\"monimolimnion\\", and the unmixed water amounts to only about 5% of the lake's volume. The depth of the chemocline can be compared to that for the lakes at nearby Green Lakes State Park, where the chemocline is 18 m below the surface. The surrounding limestone cliffs are high. Hiking trails skirt a half-ring of cliffs surrounding the lake, as well as traversing the rugged limestone over which the old river flowed. A Nature Center is operated by the Friends of Clark Reservation, a nonprofit organization staffed completely by volunteers. The Center has exhibits about the park's geology and natural history, and is open from Memorial Day to Labor Day. In addition to staffing the Center, the Friends group also organizes events and retains a naturalist each summer to guide hikes and create nature programming for the public in the park. The park also offers fishing, hiking trails, picnic tables and pavilions, and a playground. ==History== Before the arrival of the Europeans, the land around the park belonged to Onondaga people. In the late 18th century, these lands were divided into military tracts to be awarded to soldiers returning from the Revolutionary War. Joshua Clark noted the lake and its precipitous cliffs in his 1840 book about Onondaga County. In 1879, James Macfarlane purchased the area around the fossil waterfall and the lake, and opened a small resort hotel in the park. Macfarlane, a well established geologist, had included an appreciation of this area, and an advertisement for the summer resort, as an appendix to this geological guidebook that he had written and published in 1879. Macfarlane (1819–1885) was a noted attorney, coal geologist, geological guidebook writer, and enthusiast of the area near what was then called Green Lake (later renamed Glacier Lake to avoid confusion with the nearby Green Lake in Fayetteville, NY). The resort's offerings included picnicking, boating, fishing, croquet and archery, but it closed after a few years. The central part of the current park, amounting to and including Glacier Lake and the fossil waterfall, was bought by Mary Clark Thompson in 1915. Thompson had learned that the fossil waterfall was being considered for a limestone quarry; just to the east were the enormous limestone quarries of the Solvay Process Company. Thompson gave this tract to the New York State Museum, with the stipulation that the land be preserved as a memorial to her father Myron H. Clark, who had been governor of New York State from 1855-56. In 1915, John M. Clarke was the New York State geologist and director of the State Museum; he had worked for some years to secure the purchase and gift to the State of the area around Glacier Lake, and he was apparently instrumental in arranging for Thompson's purchase and gift. Clark Reservation became a state park in 1926. The New York State executive budget plan for 2010-2011 called for Clark Reservation State Park to be closed as a budget-cutting measure. The park closings were reversed for the 2010 season by legislation passed on May 28, 2010. == Ferns == American hart's tongue fern in Michigan; Clark Reservation has largest population of these endangered ferns in the U.S.. alt=Photograph of a moss-covered outcrop; there's a fern with large, narrow, shiny leaves growing in the center. Behind the outcrop is a deciduous forest in springtime; the ground is littered with brown leaves. Clark Reservation is known for the diversity of fern species which grow there; in a 1994 survey, 26 fern species were identified. The park is presently the principal site in the United States preserving American hart's tongue fern. This fern is quite rare in North America; its presence on the continent was first discovered in 1807 by botanist Frederick Pursh at nearby Split Rock in Onondaga County. The second half of the 19th Century was a period of popular enthusiasm for ferns that has been called \\"pteridomania\\". Discovery of additional \\"stations\\" for hart's tongue, and indeed rediscovery of the original Split Rock station, were subjects of considerable interest in the 19th century. The station near Glacier Lake was first reported in 1866 by J. A. Paine, and several stations are now known within Clark Reservation. The author, William Maxon, was raised in Central New York and graduated from Syracuse University in 1898. This is one of his first papers. In a career of nearly fifty years at the Smithsonian Institution, he became an internationally recognized botanist specializing in ferns. Because of its rarity, censuses of the fern in this region of New York have been reported periodically since 1916. In 1989, this species was declared as endangered in the United States. The most thriving site for hart's tongue through about 1925 was not Glacier Lake, but a second similar lake about due east. As with Glacier Lake, this lake was known by several names, including Green Pond, Green Lake, East Green Lake, and Scolopendrium Pond. The botanist R. C. Benedict wrote in 1915, \\"the lake itself is of equal geological interest and, from the standpoint of the hart's tongue fern, is of greater interest than the west lake region because the best specimens in the country grow near the east lake.\\" This lake was threatened by limestone quarrying in 1915 when Benedict wrote his letter to Science, and Benedict had been seeking support for the creation of another state park to protect Green Pond. Clark Reservation had recently been preserved from the same threat. By 1925 the threat to the eastern lake had become reality, and this lake was destroyed by expanded limestone quarrying. Just prior to its destruction, about 1000 hart's tongue ferns were transplanted from its vicinity to Clark Reservation. One author has claimed that the conversion of Clark Reservation into a state park in 1926 occurred because of interest in preserving the American hart's tongue fern. In 1930, a state law was passed protecting hart's tongue fern in Onondaga County and also neighboring Madison County; nonetheless, destruction of habitat in the nearby Rock-cut gorge had destroyed still another station of these ferns by 1945. ==Geology== Looking northeast across Glacier Lake in May. The photograph is taken from the top of the southern cliffs above the lake. About 10,000 years ago, a large river of glacial meltwater flowed from the west (the left of the photograph) across these cliffs. The resulting waterfall created a plunge basin or gorge with its outlet to the east (the right of the photograph). Glacier Lake occupies the deepest part of this gorge. The fossil waterfall and many of the topographical features of Clark Reservation were created about 10,000 years ago, near the end of the most recent ice age (the Wisconsin glaciation). A few miles west of Clark Reservation, glacial Lake Cardiff occupied the deep, Onondaga trough. Just east of Clark Reservation lay a similar glacial lake occupying the Butternut trough. Both troughs run north- south, aligned with the advance and retreat of the ice sheets that have scoured New York. The retreating ice sheet blocked the northern ends of both glacial lakes, so as Cecil Roseberry describes, \\"The southern environs are furrowed with rock channels slashed by torrents of glacial meltwater seeking an escape route which they finally found to the Mohawk Valley.\\" These rock channels are now called \\"the Syracuse channels\\". Because the elevation of the land in this region generally decreases from south to north, a series of channels was created by the northerly retreat of the ice sheet; each succeeding channel is lower, and more northerly, than the previous one. Smoky Hollow, which is a gorge lying about a mile south of Clark Reservation, was an early channel created by flows of water from Lake Cardiff into the Butternut trough when the ice sheet still covered the present Clark Reservation. The threshold for water to flow through this channel is at above sea level. As the ice sheet retreated, the waters found a new, lower channel running through Clark Reservation, with a channel threshold of about . A waterfall formed, and its plunge pool ultimately became Glacier Lake. As the ice retreated further northward, a still lower channel (Rock-cut channel) was carved where Interstate 481 is currently located (channel threshold of about ). The channels at Pumpkin Hollow, Meadowbrook, and at Green Lakes State Park have the same origins. Roseberry writes, \\"The abandoned gorges indicate a complex series of glacial rivers parallel to the receding ice front, producing waterfalls when they dropped over north-south ridges.\\" The relief of the fossil waterfall at Clark Reservation is somewhat larger than that of Niagara Falls (). As at Niagara Falls, the well defined falls occurred because of the presence of a capstone layer of limestone that was resistant to erosion by the flowing river. The lip of the fossil waterfall is on the Edgecliff member of the Onondaga formation of limestone. As one descends the steps along the south face of the gulf, the rock strata switch about 20 feet down to Manlius formation limestones.Clark Reservation limestone is one of the types of \\"Manlius formation\\" limestones that are found throughout this region of the country. See Roseberry writes that this \\"limestone is deeply waterworn and fissured, mutely telling the force of the deluge which hurled itself over the brink.\\" The limestone shelf leading to the precipice at Clark Reservation is an example of a \\"karst\\" topography created by water's dissolution of limestone and related rocks. Among its features is a deep depression in the limestone that is known as Dry Lake. Dry Lake is about deep and occupies , and offers an unusual habitat for plants. As Franco, et al. report, \\"It is believed to be a karst feature created by dissolving limestone that formed a sinkhole basin. The bedrock is 300–400 million years old (Van Diver 1985) and its fissures allowed for rapid post-glacial water drainage.\\" ==See also== * List of New York state parks ==References* Website of a private, non-profit, volunteer organization that supports Clark Reservation. * Photograph of American hart's tongue fern.

On August 1, 1716, he offered his services to Prince Eugene of Savoy, to fight the Turks in Hungary. There he fought 4 days later in the Battle of Petrovaradin where he was slightly wounded but covered with glory. He also participated in the pursuit of the fleeing Turks and the siege and capture of Timișoara. In 1717, now officially in the Austrian army, he again fought under Prince Eugen and participated in the conquest of Belgrade. After the Treaty of Passarowitz, he obtained the title of Maréchal de camp. After the war he traveled from court to court, living a life filled with pleasure, inspiring several contemporary writers. In 1721 he received the Order of the Golden Fleece. In 1728 he became one of the candidates for the hand of the wealthy Maria Zofia Sieniawska supported by the Habsburgs in attempt to gain a strong position in Poland before the Royal Election. Well known at the Austrian and Russian court, he was even proposed as the next King of Poland for a short time in 1733, in the onset of the War of Polish Succession. The next year he returned to Portugal, where he spent the last years of his life in the Quinta de Belas, leading a socially active life, surrounded by writers and artists.

It is also very common in most of the Caribbean Islands. It is most commonly known as jocote, which derives from the Nahuatl word xocotl, meaning any kind of sour or acidic fruit. It is a popular fruit throughout Central America, particularly in El Salvador, Nicaragua and in Costa Rica. However, this fruit can be particularly sweet when it ripens long enough. Other common names include red mombin, plum, purple mombin, hog plum, ciruela huesito (Venezuela), ciruela, ciruela traqueadora (Panama), ciriguela, cirigüela, cirguela, cirguelo (Ecuador), and siniguelas (Philippines). ==History== Jocote trees have been used by the people of Central America for thousands of years, for both food and medicinal uses. The trees are also used to create living fences and to help staunch soil erosion. A sap or gum from the tree is used as a glue and the same material is combined with sapote or pineapple to make a treatment for jaundice. Jocote fruits are native to the area that stretches from southern Mexico to northern Peru and parts of north-coastal Brazil. They are most commonly in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Panama. Though, they can be found growing throughout the West Indies and in the Bahamas as well. Spanish explorers brought Jocote fruit to the Philippines, where it is popular. Some Jocotes have been spotted growing in Florida, though they are not cultivated and are likely planted as a curiosity. Researchers believe the genetic variations of the Jocote fruit have been saved for future generations due to people cultivating the plant, separating it from its wild habitat. Due to a reduction in the acreage of the tropical dry forests in Central America, Jocotes may have become endangered if it weren't for the fruit's popularity with locals and success in cultivation. Jocotes can be found in specialty stores catering to Central American cuisine and products. Since 2011, Jocote has been cultivated in Chiapas, Mexico, providing much needed work for producers in the area, and a good tree for planting in areas affected by soil erosion. Jocote fruit is also known as Purple Mombin, Jamaica Plum, Ciruela (Spanish for “plum”), or Hog Plum. There are many different varieties of Jocote fruit, up to 50 recorded in Nicaragua. There is a high variability among the fruits and in their color and appearance. Jocotes are related to mangoes and to cashew apples, from which we get cashew nuts. ==Description== S. purpurea fruit grow on deciduous trees in warm tropical climates. They begin to develop following tiny red flowers, before any leaves appear on the tree. S. purpurea fruit grows along thick, knobby branches in clusters or alone. They are about 2 and a half to 5 centimeters in diameter and are slightly elongated. Some have a knob on the end, or are oddly shaped. Young S. purpurea fruit are green or yellowish-green and ripen to a purple or red color; some variants of the species will ripen to a yellow color. The thin skin has a waxy appearance and is edible. The pulp is yellow when ripe and sweet. In the center of the fruit is a large pit, or stone, which is inedible. The flavor of a S. purpurea fruit is said to be similar to a plum, sweet with a bit of an acidic aftertaste. S. purpurea fruit is available in the fall and winter months. S. purpurea fruit are rich in vitamin C and carbohydrates. They are a source of calcium, phosphorus, iron and a small amount of fiber. They contain carotene, B-complex vitamins, and several important amino acids. S. purpurea are high in antioxidants, which help rid the body of free radicals. Fruits of Spondias purpurea. Sineguelas from the Philippines Allergenic urushiol is present in the sap of the tree and in small concentrations of the fruit peel and can trigger contact dermatitis (allergic rash) in sensitized individuals. This reaction is more likely to occur in people who have been exposed to other plants from the family Anacardiaceae, such as poison oak and poison ivy, which are widespread in the United States. In Florida growth is relegated to near-tropical areas of the state, and the tree is killed or greatly harmed by cold winter temperatures from Palm Beach County northward. The fruit are most often enjoyed as-is, raw and fully ripe. Ripe fruits will be soft to the touch and are very sweet. They are eaten much like a plum or mango, with the pulp eaten and the stone discarded. The pulp can be used to make beverages, mashed and mixed with water and a sweetener. Whole fruits are boiled in water with sugar and sometimes other fruits to make a syrup or “honey”. This is eaten with ice cream or alone as a dessert. The fruits are cooked whole to make preserves, the seeds strained from the liquid. Boiling and drying S. purpurea fruits will preserve them for several months. Unripe fruits can be eaten, though they are much more tart and somewhat bitter. They are made into a tart sauce or pickled in vinegar or lime juice and eaten with chile peppers and salt. The ripe fruit is commonly sold in the streets in most Central American countries in plastic bags; also available are red hot pepper sauce and \\"alhuaishte\\" (very fine ground toasted pumpkin seeds). In Costa Rica it is customary to eat the ripe fruit with salt. A typical jocote dish in Salvadoran cuisine consists of a syrup made of panela (a molasses made from artisan sugar blocks made by boiling cane juice from a molienda [cane crushing station traditionally ran by oxen or currently with portable gas engines], to evaporate water until it achieves thick molasses consistency, then poured into wood molds and let it cool down. Once solidified later are wrapped in dry corn husk leaves called \\"tuzas\\" and sold in the markets.

It was dedicated February 8, 1960. ==Personal life== Brian was married to Bonita Fiedler; they divorced in 1948. In 1950, she filed a paternity suit against him, seeking his support for a son born to her. The suit claimed that Brian had admitted to being the baby's father. Brian's attorney, on the other hand, said that Brian did not think he was the child's father. At the time of the suit, Brian was married to Adrian Booth, an actress who was also known as Lorna Gray. On August 11, 1951, a jury found in Brian's favor after another man testified to having been intimate with the mother \\"several times during the year before the child was born\\". Brian's marriage to Booth also had legal problems. In 1949, columnist Jimmie Fidler reported that Booth's \\"recent marriage to actor David Brian has been set aside by an L.A. judge because of illegalities in his divorce from a former mate\\". ==Death== Brian died July 15, 1993, of heart disease and cancer in Sherman Oaks, California.Aaker, Everett (2006).

The film was Wilder's directorial debut, from his own original script. Douglas Wilmer and Thorley Walters appear as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, respectively. Wilmer had previously appeared as Sherlock Holmes in the 1960s BBC TV series, and Walters played Watson in three other films: Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace (1962), The Best House in London (1969), and Silver Blaze (1977). ==Plot== In 1891, Foreign Secretary Lord Redcliff haphazardly receives a document with unknown contents from Queen Victoria; the document is stolen from his safe later that night. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson discuss the case. Deciding to lie low for a while, Holmes informs Watson that he will delegate cases to his younger brother, Sigerson (Gene Wilder), who has toiled in his brother's shadow without credit for decades. At a train station, and dressing in drag to avoid a would-be assassin, Sherlock passes the message to Scotland Yard records clerk Orville Sacker (Marty Feldman), a man with auditory eidetic memory, who happens to be a fan of Sigerson's work. Arriving at Sigerson's flat, Sacker finds him practicing his fencing and swordplay. Sigerson expresses bitterness and resentment over being unable to replicate Sherlock's success, mocking his big brother as \\"Sheer Luck\\" Holmes. Arriving next is a woman claiming to be Bessie Bellwood, but Sigerson sees through her ruse almost immediately by stumping her with his knowledge of Bellwood's repertoire and the fact that Bellwood had died in 1879. Eventually, after some interrogation—it soon becomes clear that the woman is a habitual liar—she reveals herself to be Jenny Hill, a music hall singer who believes she is being blackmailed by opera singer Eduardo Gambetti over a lewd letter she sent him. The assassin finds out about Hill's and Sigerson's meeting and reports it to an obviously math-challenged Professor Moriarty. Sigerson attends one of Hill's performances and saves her from another would-be assassin by injecting himself into the play from the audience and directing Hill through a musical number. He then saves her again when two hansom cabs accost her on her way home; the trauma prompts Hill to temporarily stop cooperating in the case. Sigerson (dismayed that Sherlock got credit for saving Hill in the newspaper) is invited the next day to her dressing room, where he uses the power of seduction to both make love to her and find out further details. She reveals that she stole the document from Redcliff's safe and claims that Redcliff is her father. When Sigerson meets with Redcliff, he learns that Hill is not Redcliff's daughter, but his fiancée, and that Hill had lied to Sigerson again. Eventually the trail leads to Gambetti, who has made a deal with Moriarty to sell him the document, which foreign powers have offered £50,000 (£ million today) to acquire. Moriarty pays, but the distrustful Gambetti proposes that he hand over the document during the debut of his opera (a botched \\"translation\\" of Giuseppe Verdi's Un ballo in maschera) so that he has time to safely deposit the money. Sigerson and Sacker infiltrate the opera, which soon devolves into chaos. Sigerson and Moriarty confront each other backstage and are drawn into a sword fight that corners Sigerson on an outside ledge; at this point, Moriarty explains to Sigerson why he never lived up to his brother's fame: Sherlock was far better at seeing his enemy's moves \\"two to three steps ahead\\" of when they happen. Under threat of death, Sigerson agrees to hand over what Moriarty thinks is the document before Moriarty falls off the ledge (shaken by the chimes of Big Ben) and into the water below. The document turns out to be a decoy: Sigerson has left the real document to be found by Sherlock. The final scene is of Sigerson Holmes running through a park to attend Jenny Hill's wedding but finds that she has not gone through with the ceremony and, instead, is waiting for him on a park bench. The lovers reconcile and share in a celebratory dance, accompanied by a disguised Sherlock and Watson. ==Cast== * Gene Wilder as Sigerson Holmes * Madeline Kahn as Jenny Hill (initially using the alias Bessie Bellwood), also nicknamed \\"Miss Liar\\" * Marty Feldman as Sgt. Orville Stanley Sacker * Dom DeLuise as Eduardo Gambetti * Leo McKern as Professor Moriarty * Roy Kinnear as Finney, Moriarty's assistant * Douglas Wilmer as Sherlock Holmes * Thorley Walters as Dr. Watson * John Le Mesurier as Lord Redcliff, the Foreign Secretary. * Mel Brooks as the voice of the lion victim (uncredited) * Albert Finney as Man in Audience at Opera (uncredited) ==Production== Wilder was having lunch with producer Roth when it was suggested that Wilder spoof Sherlock Holmes. Roth approached Wilder again a week later and inquired if Wilder had given any more thought to the idea of a Sherlock Holmes film. Wilder replied \\"No, but I have given a great deal of thought to Sherlock's insanely jealous brother Sigi.\\" In his autobiography, Wilder explained that he was further motivated by the experience of working with his Young Frankenstein co-stars Madeline Kahn and Marty Feldman and he wanted to write parts for both of them in his next project. Wilder began writing Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother as production was wrapping on Young Frankenstein. On the set of Frankenstein, Mel Brooks warned Wilder that now that he was writing movies, he would eventually move to directing movies to protect his scripts. After Smarter Brother, Wilder would go on to write, direct and star in three more features over the next ten years (The World's Greatest Lover in 1977, The Woman in Red in 1984, and Haunted Honeymoon in 1986). Wilder's screenplay reveals a deep knowledge of Conan Doyle's characters as Marty Feldman's character, Sgt. Orville Stanley Sacker, shares a similar name with that originally applied to John Watson, Ormond Sacker. ===Title=== The film's title and premise are a joke referring to the character of Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock Holmes' older brother, who was by both of their estimates a good deal smarter than Sherlock. He was, however, too lazy to become a detective, and did indispensable work for the British government. Mycroft was described by Sherlock in conversation with Watson: Mycroft is mentioned briefly in the beginning of the film, which presupposes that Holmes was one of three brothers. Sigerson's name refers to an alias used by Sherlock Holmes in \\"The Adventure of the Empty House\\". Kahn's character is named after singer Jenny Hill; she initially uses the pseudonym Bessie Bellwood, but Sigerson sees through the ruse and notes that the real Bellwood had died over a decade prior (in reality, Bellwood and Hill were both still alive in 1891 and died in the same year, 1896). The portrayal of Professor Moriarty as having difficulties at math was a parody of Moriarty's expertise in math in Doyle's books. The overall plot is loosely based upon Doyle's \\"A Scandal in Bohemia,\\" in which a King enlists Holmes to retrieve a photograph of the king with Irene Adler, one of the few nemeses to beat Holmes. ==Reception== ===Box office=== The film earned $9.4 million in rentals in North America during its theatrical release.Solomon p 233 ===Critical=== Vincent Canby of The New York Times called the film \\"a charming slapstick comedy\\" that like Young Frankenstein \\"is full of affection and generous feelings for the genre it's having fun with.\\"Canby, Vincent (December 15, 1975). \\"Adroit 'Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother'\\".

(December 3, 1975). \\"Film Reviews: The Adventure Of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother\\". Variety. 22. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two stars out of four, calling it \\"tedious\\" and Sigerson \\"a bland character at the center of a gimmick-filled movie\\" that \\"recalls the great detective only by name and occasional costume.

The Washington Post. C1. Pauline Kael of The New Yorker stated that Wilder \\"wrote the roles for the actors but didn't write characters for them to play.

It was founded by Virginia Alice (Cottey) Stockard in 1884. Since 1927 it has been owned and supported by the P.E.O. Sisterhood, a philanthropic women's organization based on Des Moines, Iowa. It was founded as a preparatory school for girls and women, and by 1932 was a two-year liberal arts college. In 2011 it achieved accreditation as a four-year baccalaureate-granting college. Cottey has 256 enrolled students in 2019. Cottey has a student to faculty ratio of 10:1. Some classes meet with fewer than 10 students. Faculty includes both men and women, with over 90% holding the terminal academic degree in their field. Cottey is situated on of land in Nevada, Missouri, the Vernon County seat and a rural town of 8,171 people (by the 2012 estimate). The main campus occupies 11 city blocks. Five blocks south of this is B.I.L. Hill, a wooded area owned and used by Cottey for recreation, concerts, bonfires, picnics, suite nights, and other traditions. The official colors of Cottey are yellow and white. Additionally, the senior class color is navy blue and the freshmen class color is \\"baby\\" blue. ==History== ===Beginnings=== Cottey College, circa 1910 Cottey College was founded by Virginia Alice Cottey (known as Alice Cottey) in 1884; she originally called it \\"Vernon Seminary\\", based on the county. After teaching at Central College in Lexington, Missouri since 1875, Cottey decided she wanted to establish her own school. She had saved $3,000, and her sisters Dora and Mary lent her nearly $3,000 of their savings to begin the school. Several towns bid for the opportunity to host the new girls' school, including Fort Worth, Texas and several towns in Missouri. After much thought, Cottey accepted the offer of Nevada in Vernon County, although it was not the most generous. Residents donated of land upon which Cottey had a three-story brick building constructed. After the college expanded, this building came to be known as Main Hall. Vernon Seminary opened its doors in 1884 as a primary, intermediate, and collegiate preparatory school. In those early years, before educational standardization in the U.S., placement of students depended more upon their accomplishments than age. In 1886 the school's name was officially changed to \\"Cottey College.\\" By 1932, the college consisted only of the higher education part, offering a two-year program. In 1927, Cottey offered the college to the P.E.O. Sisterhood (Philanthropic Educational Organization), an international organization based in Des Moines, Iowa that supports women's education. She made a condition that they raise a $200,000 endowment for the college (about $2.9 million in 2018 dollars), in order to maintain and operate it for the long term. The P.E.O. accepted, and have since owned and operated the private Cottey College. ===Enrollment=== Enrollment grew from 28 to 72 students during the first year, and by 1910 there were 250 students. Attendance dropped during the 1930s and '40s, but rose to maximum capacity of 350 by the 1970s. With more two-year local community colleges opening in the later 20th century, Cottey had a slow decline in enrollment during the 1990s and into the 2000s. It was also a period when some young women preferred co-ed institutions in larger communities. The college worked to restore enrollment and to expand its offerings to a full, four-year curriculum, which it achieved in 2011. By 2017, the number of students totaled 307. ==Student life== ===Residential life=== Blanche Skiff Ross Memorial Library Students come from more than 40 states and 20 different countries. In the 2018-19 school year, international students came from Angola, Burundi, Ethiopia, France, Ghana, Guatemala, India, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Malawi, Mexico, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Uganda, United Kingdom, and Zimbabwe. Cottey students live in one of three campus halls (P.E.O., Reeves, and Robertson), each having between 10 and 14 suites. These include a few bedrooms, a bathroom, and a kitchenette arranged around a living room. Student rooms have typical college furnishings. Suites are occupied by between 8 and 12 students. Most suites are sponsored by a P.E.O. chapter, and suite members usually receive several care packages from these P.E.O.s during the year. Sponsorship of some suites has changed over time, their names changing as well. ===Residence halls=== P.E.O. Hall is the oldest of the existing dormitories, and was erected in 1939. It has 10 suites, housing about 100 students. It was the first building to be paid by the P.E.O. Sisterhood after they acquired the college.\\"Cottey College Is the Only College In the U.S. Maintained By Women.\\" Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune. Chillicothe, MO. 15 Apr 1939. Reeves Hall was built in 1949 on the site where a prior Cottey dorm, Missouri Hall, had burned down in 1940. Like P.E.O., it houses 10 suites and about 100 students. It is noted for having the largest basement of the three halls, and a foyer reminiscent of a classic hotel lobby. Robertson (Robbie) Hall Robertson Hall (Robbie) was the last Cottey dorm to be built, being erected in 1959. It houses 14 suites (about 150 students) as well as the college's dining facility, Raney Dining Hall and the Centennial Room. It is noted for being the only hall with air conditioning and an elevator, and for having the smallest basement. Each hall has recreational rooms, computer suites, laundry facilities, and quiet study rooms elsewhere in each building. Cottey has had several prior dormitories, including Rosemary Hall (est. 1903) and Missouri Hall (1928–1940). Main Hall was also used as a dorm from 1884 to 1939.Troesch, Dr. Helen DeRusha. The Life of Virginia Alice Cottey Stockard. Wayside Press, Inc., 1955. ===Athletics=== Cottey's sports teams are called the Comets and compete in seven women's intercollegiate sports, basketball, cross-country, flag football (2020), golf, softball, track and field, and volleyball. When intercollegiate athletics were reintroduced to the college in the 1998-99 academic year, the Comets competed in the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA). On July 1, 2018, Cottey was admitted into full membership of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). The Comets currently compete independent of a conference affiliation. ===International experience=== In 2000, the college established a spring trip abroad for second-year students and other eligible students. Since the first trip, international experience trip in 2000, each second-year class has traveled to one of several destinations: Paris, London, Barcelona, Madrid, Rome, or Florence. For each European destination, the cost of airfare and hotel stays have been paid by the college. Alternative trips to destinations including Japan, Peru, Thailand, Guatemala, New Zealand have sometimes incurred additional fees. In 2019, Cottey College took the second-year class and other eligible students on a week-long trip to Barcelona, Spain; others went to Australia over spring break. For 2020, Cottey planned a student spring trip to Munich, Germany, and Poland. == Notable alumnae == Dora Dougherty Strother (3rd from left) in front of B-29 \\"Ladybird\\" *Jetta Carleton '33 - author of The Moonflower Vine (1962), a New York Times Bestseller *Dora Dougherty Strother '41 - Women Airforce Service Pilot, one of the first two women to pilot a B-29. *Ruby Kless Sondock ‘44 - First woman justice on the Texas Supreme Court *Francine Irving Neff '46 - Treasurer of the United States, 1974–1977 *Marilyn Harris Springer '51 - Best-selling author of the Eden series and Hatter Fox. *Carol Littleton '62 - Film editor, nominated for an Oscar for E.T.

He originally possessed the mutant ability to create and project a bio-EM field. This has the effect of temporarily disabling any similarly powered technology in the vicinity. He can also utilize his power to scan the environment for other pre-existing energy fields. After the High Evolutionary reset the mutant genome in every mutant on the planet, Jesse's abilities expanded to be able to affect the human brain's neural chemistry, thus allowing him to project the illusion of pain and confusion into other people. Another, unrelated Bedlam was an enemy of Alpha Flight. ==Fictional character biography== Jesse Aaronson was orphaned at the age of 5 after his parents were killed in a car crash. After that, he and his brother Christopher were put into foster care separately. Jesse went through multiple foster homes due to his emotional instability and was forced to go through many therapists before being placed in a psychiatric hospital at 13. He was exploited during that time by one of the doctors, who wanted to use Jesse's burgeoning powers for a book and performed experiments on him, and tried to convince Jesse that his brother was simply a figment of his imagination. Jesse was eventually rescued by Lucas Whyndam and ended up in the hands of the Professor Charles Xavier's Mutant Underground Support Engine (M.U.S.E.), a group based out of Montana with the goal of rescuing mutants and training them as field agents. When he reached the age of 19, Jesse decided to leave M.U.S.E. in order to track down his brother once and for all. He enlisted the help of the mutant spy and former X-Force member, Domino. He offered her information regarding the whereabouts of the Prime Sentinel unit named Ekaterina Gryaznova in exchange for Domino's help. Gryaznova, now calling herself Gryphon, had implanted a device in Domino's body several months ago, which severely diminished her mutant powers. Upon entering the base, Domino was captured but Bedlam managed to escape. Using his resources from M.U.S.E., he managed to track down X-Force in San Francisco and break into their headquarters, in order to ask them for help. The team managed to free Domino and apparently kill Gryphon. In the process, Bedlam used his power to short circuit Domino's implant. Keeping up her end of the bargain, Domino managed to find information regarding his family. His parents were actually information analysts at the National Security Department. They paid a visit to his parents' former supervisor, Dabney Saunders, who was residing in a retirement home, babbling incoherent sentences. Domino, however, discovered the orderly in charge of Saunders informing an unidentified man about their visit. Both Bedlam and Domino broke into the mysterious man's home using Jesse's power and were subsequently attacked by Magma and Paradigm. Bedlam used his powers to disrupt Paradigm's electronics, knocking out Magma in the process. However, they were subdued by none other than Jesse's brother, Christopher. Christopher, calling himself King Bedlam, has the power to disrupt the higher functions of the brain. Chris was tagged as a mutant at the age of six by the N.S.D. and was taken into a research center after their parents' death.X-Force vol. 1 #87 At age 13 he fled, destroying Saunders mind in the process. He had now founded a new team of Hellions and offered an invitation of membership to Jesse, who gladly accepted. The group's true intentions, however, were to reanimate the Armageddon Man in order to blackmail the U.S. government into paying one billion dollars. X-Force managed to subdue the Armageddon Man, but the New Hellions managed to escape. Jesse was invited back to join X-Force, as he had discovered that it was his brother responsible for their parents' death. After several missions with the team, Jesse learned martial arts through a \\"Delphi box\\" given to him by Peter Wisdom. The team also learned of Bedlam's unique condition, which forced him to take medication in order to keep his own power from scrambling his brain. After the High Evolutionary removed every mutants' power and subsequently restored it, the team took on a new direction. Peter Wisdom was now X-Force's leader, while Domino and Moonstar had quit. Wisdom taught them how to use their new abilities. In Jesse's case, he could generate an electromagnetic pulse, disrupt machinery within a certain distance without having to be in physical contact with the target, and could also disrupt neural responses from a distance just like his brother. He remained with the team until their apparent deaths,X-Force vol. 1 #115 where he used his power to destroy an underground alien colony. After a new group of \\"pop star\\" mutants began calling themselves X-Force, the original team crashed their press conference. The only missing member was Jesse. Months later when a group called the Church of Humanity crucified some mutants on the lawn on the mansion, Jesse was found among them. Archangel used his healing blood to revive Magma and Jubilee, but along with several other mutants, Jesse apparently did not have the same luck. After Xavier and Magneto, with the secret help of Moira MacTaggert, put their plan in motion to start the mutant nation of Krakoa, Jesse now finds himself living on the utopian-like island with his fellow mutants. ==Powers and abilities== Through a \\"Delphi box\\" Jesse had the memories of a karate black belt, and thus could perform with those skills. He continued to further his hand-to-hand training with both Domino and Pete Wisdom. His mutant ability allowed him to sense and perceive energy signatures and generate a bio-EM field that wreaked havoc with electrical and certain mechanical systems, and could affect the neural chemical responses of a living brain to induce states such as pain, sleep, or confusion. At first strictly touch based aside from sensing energy fields and tracking others by their biological EM signature, the restarting of every mutant's powers by the High Evolutionary later enabled him to generate electromagnetic pulses that cover whole city blocksX-Force vol. 1 #102 and also disrupt neural responses from afar not unlike his brother could. As part of his training with the Mutant Underground, Jesse was adept in covert ops and intelligence gathering such as computer hacking. ==Other versions== Although his technical debut, Jesse appears alongside his brother (here named Terrence and called the Bedlam Brothers) in the \\"Age of Apocalypse\\" storyline. In this reality, he worked for Sinister's Elite Mutant Force in his pens. Factor X #1 He eventually turned on Havok, in order to help Cyclops and Jean Grey to escape the pens and begin a path of redemption. ==In other media== Bedlam appears in Deadpool 2, portrayed by Terry Crews. He is recruited into X-Force by Deadpool and Weasel after displaying his EM disrupting powers, but is quickly taken out of commission on their first mission when crosswinds blow his parachute off-course so that he crashes through the front window of a bus. He is last seen receiving CPR in the background. ==References== ==External links== * World of Black Heroes: Bedlam Biography * UncannyXmen.net Character Profile on Bedlam * Bedlam on the Marvel Universe Character Bio Wiki Category:Black characters in films Category:Comics characters introduced in 1995 Category:Comics characters introduced in 1998 Category:Deadpool characters Category:Marvel Comics superheroes Category:Fictional African-American people Category:Fictional characters with electric or magnetic abilities Category:Marvel Comics martial artists Category:Marvel Comics mutants Category:Characters created by John Francis Moore (writer) Category:X-Men supporting characters ","title":"Bedlam (comics)"},{"id":"2565370","text":"Riverbank State Park is a state park built on top of a sewage treatment facility on the Hudson River, in the New York City borough of Manhattan.

The park was built over the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant, which processes of wastewater every day during dry weather, and is designed to handle up to a day when the weather is wet. In order to minimize odors emitted by the plant, dedicated odor-control facilities have been installed at the plant, including $55 million in recent upgrades. The plant sits on 2,300 caissons pinned into bedrock up to beneath the river. Construction of the foundation was completed in 1978, and the wastewater treatment facilities were constructed in two phases between 1986 and 1991. Under construction, 1973 One of only three state parks within Manhattan (the others being Hudson River Park and Franklin D.

The screenplay by Robert Wilder was based on a 1946 play written by Wilder and his wife, Sally, which was based on Robert Wilder's 1942 novel of the same name.. The plot follows an ex-carnival dancer who marries a local businessman to seek revenge on a corrupt political boss who had her railroaded into prison. Some of the more salacious aspects of the novel were downplayed in the film because of the Hollywood Production Code. Robert Wilder, who died in 1974, was later credited as the creator of the American TV series Flamingo Road (1980-1982), which drew elements from both the novel and the film. ==Plot== Lane Bellamy is a carnival dancer stranded in the small town of Boldon City in the Southern United States. She becomes romantically involved with Fielding Carlisle, a deputy sheriff whose career is controlled by Sheriff Titus Semple, a corrupt political boss who runs the town. Semple dislikes Bellamy and mounts a campaign against her. She has difficulty finding work and is arrested on a trumped-up morality charge. Meanwhile, Carlisle is the political machine's choice for state senator, and to portray the perfect political family, he marries his long-time girlfriend, Annabelle Weldon. Sad that the love of her life has divorced himself from her, Bellamy finds work as a hostess at a roadhouse run by Lute Mae Sanders. There, she meets Dan Reynolds, a businessman who supports the corrupt Semple so long as it is profitable. She charms Reynolds into marrying her and the couple moves to the town's best neighborhood, Flamingo Road. As a kingmaker in the state, Semple decides to run Carlisle for governor and unseat the incumbent. This is too much even for Reynolds and now he decides to oppose Semple. When Carlisle, who has a weakness for alcohol, also begins to show his limits in cooperating with Semple, Semple flies into a rage and abandons him, destroying Carlisle's career. Then Semple makes himself the candidate. At this, Reynolds grows stronger in his opposition. So Semple arranges to have Reynolds framed. Later a drunken Carlisle, who knows what's happening but feels the situation is hopeless, visits the mansion on Flamingo Road and commits suicide practically in front of Bellamy. This gives Semple another weapon in his bid to ruin Bellamy and her husband, who has now been indicted for graft. Bellamy confronts Semple with a gun and demands he phone the attorney general and confess everything, but a physical struggle ensues and she shoots him dead. At the end, Bellamy is in prison awaiting a ruling and Reynolds indicates he will stick by her. ==Cast== * Joan Crawford as Lane Bellamy * Zachary Scott as Fielding Carlisle * Sydney Greenstreet as Sheriff Titus Semple * Gladys George as Lute Mae Sanders * David Brian as Dan Reynolds * Virginia Huston as Annabelle Weldon * Fred Clark as Dr. Waterson * Gertrude Michael as Millie * Tito Vuolo as Pete Ladas * Alice White as Gracie * Sam McDaniel as Boatright ==Reception and box office== Howard Barnes wrote in the New York Herald Tribune, \\"Joan Crawford acquits herself ably in an utterly nonsensical and undefined part...It's no fault of hers she cannot handle the complicated romances and double crosses in which she is involved.\\"Quirk, Lawrence J..

Thus, the foxtail is a type of diaspore or plant dispersal unit. Some grasses that produce a foxtail are themselves called \\"foxtail\\", also \\"spear grass\\". They can become a health hazard for dogs and other domestic animals, and a nuisance for people. ==Sources== The name \\"foxtail\\" is applied to a number of grasses that have bushy spikes of spikelets that resemble the tail of a fox. Not all of these are hazardous; most of the hazardous ones are in the genus Hordeum, and are also called \\"wild barley\\". Grasses known as foxtails include: * Alopecurus (foxtail grasses – the scientific name literally means \\"fox tail\\") * Bromus madritensis (foxtail brome) * Hordeum jubatum (foxtail barley) * Setaria (foxtail millets) Other grasses also produce hazardous spikelets. The spikelets are sometimes called foxtails, even though the grasses are not. ==Structure== All foxtails have a hardened tip, sometimes called a \\"callus\\", and retrorse barbs, pointing away from the tip of the callus. Wild barleys have clusters of three spikelets, and the callus is the portion of the rachis to which they attach. In other grasses, such as needlegrass and brome grasses, the foxtail consists of a single spikelet, with the callus being the hardened lemma tip. Retrorse barbs can be found on the callus, the lemmas, and the awns. The spikelets or spikelet clusters of foxtails are adapted for animal dispersal: The foxtails disarticulate easily, the barbs cause the foxtail to cling to fur, and movement of the animal causes the foxtail to burrow into the fur, since the barbs permit it to move only in the direction of the callus. In wild mammals that inhabit the native ranges of foxtail grasses, the fur is ordinarily short enough that the foxtails will eventually become dislodged, dispersing the seed. ==Hazard== Foxtails can become a health hazard for dogs and other domestic animals, and a nuisance for people. In dogs and other domestic animals the foxtails can become irreversibly lodged. Foxtails can also enter the nostrils and ear canals of many mammals. In all these cases, the foxtail can physically enter the body through muscular movements or, in the case of nostrils, air flow, can cause the foxtails to continue to burrow through soft tissues and organs, causing infection and physical disruption, which in some cases can result in death. In humans, foxtails can work through clothing, particularly fabric shoes and socks, causing discomfort to people while walking. Foxtails are a problem beginning when the grass inflorescences begin to disarticulate, and ending when the spikelets or spikelet clusters are mechanically abraded or incorporated into the soil, turf, or leaf litter. In some habitats, this can be a matter of weeks, but in others it may require months, especially if different species flower and fruit at different times during the season. Foxtails that have progressed no further than surface lesions may be removed and the lesion treated with antiseptic and bandaged if necessary. Once a foxtail has passed beneath the skin, dogs are often treated with systemic antibiotics, and the foxtail either allowed to encyst and degrade, or in the case of actual or imminent organ damage, removed surgically. However, surgical removal can be problematic, since foxtails cannot easily be imaged by x-ray or ultrasound. Foxtails embedded in the nostrils can migrate into the nasal turbinates, causing intense distress, and in rare cases into the brain. Foxtails in the ear canal can puncture the eardrum and enter the middle ear, causing hearing loss. Combing of fur removes foxtails along with burrs and other detritus, but potentially the most dangerous foxtails are found in areas easily missed: the axillae, between the toes, and in nostrils and ear canals. Occasionally they can even lodge in the conjunctiva under the eyelid. Many wild barley species are weeds in disturbed habitats, and their growth is encouraged by foot traffic of humans and domestic animals. Control methods consist of restricting traffic to established paths, and eradication of wild barley by mechanical removal or herbicide. Some other foxtail-producing grasses, especially needlegrasses, are dominant species in stable grassland habitats. Control attempts in these cases can actually be counterproductive, creating disturbed habitats where wild barleys may thrive. ==Gallery== File:Hordeum murinum disarticulating spikelet cluster.jpgThe spike of Hordeum murinum disarticulates into clusters of three spikelets File:Hordeum murinum spikelet cluster.jpgEach spikelet cluster is held together by a portion of the rachis File:Hordeum murinum spikelet cluster SEM.jpgSpikelet cluster viewed by scanning electron microscope File:Hordeum murinum callus at tip of spikelet cluster.jpgThe rachis segment, sometimes called a \\"callus\\", is hardened, and covered with retrorse barbs File:Hordeum murinum callus at tip of spikelet cluster SEM.jpgRachis segment viewed by scanning electron microscope.

While attending the University of Chicago in 1936, he wrote for the Chicago Daily News and \\"campus stories\\" for Time on a part-time basis. Six months later, he was summoned to New York City to work for Time and Life on a regular basis. In both 1936 and 1940 he covered the Presidential campaigns of James Farley. While in Washington D.C., Lang met an old classmate, Kay Meyer (who later became Katharine Graham) of The Washington Post and Newsweek. The two dated for a while, but broke off the relationship due to conflicting interests. In December 1940, Lang had an opportunity to get an interview with Massachusetts Congressman George Tinkham who showed Lang his trophies from his safaris in Kenya. == World War II == Will Lang Jr. in Italy During World War II, Lang became Bureau Head in Algiers, Italy, Paris, and Berlin. He also became friends with Bill Mauldin, Ernie Pyle, George Silk, John Steinbeck and Robert Capa. During the war, he wrote many biographies, including those of Lucian Truscott, Bill Mauldin, J. Elmer Spyglass, Creighton Abrams, and Canadian manufacturer Ludger Dionne. Lang was the first American reporter in Tunis after the Battle of the Kasserine Pass. Later that same year, he followed the battle campaign of General George S. Patton in Sicily. On October 7, 1943, Lang was nearly killed in the Naples post office explosion. Later that month, He was commended by General Matthew B. Ridgway for his professionalism during his stay with the 82nd Airborne Division. It is said that General Ridgeway considered Lang to be an honorary member of the Division. After D-Day, he had lunch with Mary Welsh Hemingway, the 4th wife of Ernest Hemingway. Later on, he filed a report on The Battle of the Bulge alongside Col. Creighton Abrams, in which Abrams later mentioned in an article of Stars and Stripes. == Post-war == After the war, Lang continued his reporting in Europe and wrote reports on the rebuilding of Berlin and the fall of The Iron Curtain. During this time, in January 1948, his daughter Luisa was born. The Lang family's happiness was cut short in June when they heard of the Berlin Blockade. Lang was able to smuggle his family into France before the borders were closed. In March 1950, one of his stories reported on the discovery of the coffins of German President Paul Von Hindenburg and his wife, alongside Frederick William I of Prussia and Frederick the Great, in a salt mine in Germany. When Lang returned to the United States in May 1950, he became Bureau Head in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1952, he wrote about John F. Kennedy becoming Senator of Massachusetts. From 1954-1960, he served as Bureau Head in Washington, D.C.. After becoming Bureau Head in Paris in 1960, Lang traveled to Spain to help his old friend Ernest Hemingway publish The Dangerous Summer. Hemingway called it an addendum to Death in the Afternoon (1938). Hemingway persuaded Lang to let him print the manuscript, along with a picture layout, before it came out in hardcover. Although not a word of it was on paper, Hemingway agreed to the proposal. The first part of story appeared in Life on September 5, 1960 and was followed by two more installments. In 1961 while in Berlin, Lang witnessed the construction of the Berlin Wall. When he returned home in 1961, he was promoted to Deputy Regional Bureau Director of Life. In February 1963, he was promoted to Chief Bureau Head of Domestic and Foreign Departments for Washington, D.C.'s Life branch. On June 26, 1963, Lang returned to Berlin for a few days and witnessed John F. Kennedy's \\"Ich bin ein Berliner\\" speech. In January 1965, he was promoted to Chief Regional Bureau Director for Life in Manhattan.

It acted in many ways like a political party, with an extensive branch network and the capability to run its own candidates. It was a conservative organisation with four key declared objectives: * Loyalty to the Throne; * To counteract Socialist tendencies; * To educate the Women of Victoria to realise their political responsibilities; and * To Safeguard the Interests of the Home, Women and Children. ==Foundation== The AWNL was supported in its foundation by the Victorian Employers' Federation and by employer bodies in other states, but it quickly became independent from those male-dominated groups, and formed an anti- socialist alliance with the Farmer's League in 1905. The group aimed to espouse anti-socialist ideas to Australian women who had been given the right to vote in Australian federal elections in 1902. Leading Melbourne establishment figure, Janet, Lady Clarke, held a meeting at her home in August 1903 to discuss the formation of such a conservative women's movement. Months later, in March 1904, Lady Clarke's sister, Eva Hughes, organised a meeting at the Melbourne Town Hall. It chose a provisional committee and elected Lady Clarke as its inaugural president On 25 October 1907, the League conducted the first Pan-Australian Conference of Anti-Socialist Women's Organisations. The League played an important role in achieving women's suffrage (right to vote) throughout Australia. By 1908, it had 10,000 members in Victoria alone, and helped convince the male conservative members of parliament that women voters would not necessarily be left-wing in disposition. In 1909, Lady Clarke died and was succeeded as president by her sister Eva who stayed in charge until 1922. In 1912, the Liberal prime minister Alfred Deakin described the lobby group as \\"fierce and unceasing\\" in their political demands. He continued \\"So far – singlehanded – I have beat them and kept them at bay, but how long can this last?\\" The ANWL was a very active organisation, with many suburban and rural branches. It published a monthly journal The Woman. It ran many campaigns, including one for greater education in \\"domestic science\\". The League organised Empire Day festivities in Melbourne for forty years and, during World War I, organised thousands of women to contribute to the war effort. In 1918, it launched \\"Baby Week\\" as an education campaign for families. It also conducted political education and training courses for its members, to make them more effective campaigners. ==Peak of power== At its peak in World War I, the AWNL had 500 registered branches and more than 54,000 members across Australia. Using its massive membership base as a platform for achieving its objectives, it was very active in electoral politics, initially supporting male candidates and forming an important part of conservative political efforts across Australia. They employed women as paid political organisers, raised large amounts of money, and actively supported candidates, who sometimes had to go through a preselection process to attract the League's support. Some years after women had obtained the right to vote and to run for office, most of the first women candidates in Western Australia, New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria were members of the League. While they generally worked with conservative political parties, on occasion they did not. In one instance, when one of their favoured candidates in Queensland was not endorsed as they had demanded, they ran their own candidate, Irene Longman, who became the first female member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland in 1929. Actions such as these, the vast size of the League, and its highly-skilled political operatives, made it one of the most effective and feared political organisations in Australian politics at the time. Male journalists complained at the time about the power of the group: \\"Political godmothers rule UAP (United Australia Party) with haughty mien ... the political fate of the electorate was controlled by women.\\" ==Merger with the Liberals== In 1944, the AWNL actively supported the newly created Liberal Party of Australia and merged with it in 1945. The League's leaders at the time – including Dame Elizabeth Couchman and future senator Ivy Wedgwood – negotiated a tough deal with Sir Robert Menzies which ensured that women were equally represented throughout the structures of the Liberal Party, long before the era of affirmative action. It was agreed that the Liberal Party would reserve certain positions for women, that there would be a Woman Vice- President of the party, and also a Federal Women's Committee, the president of which would also sit on the party's Federal Executive. Menzies regarded Couchman very highly and observed: \\"She would have been the best cabinet minister I could have wished for\\". Some argue that the League had a major impact on the Liberal Party's direction leading up to the election in 1949, which the party won convincingly. In a highly unusual move at the time, Liberal advertising specifically made reference to women and women's issues. Images of men and women (and in some cases of women alone) were used in political advertising for the first time on a major scale. Their opponents in the Australian Labor Party were largely silent on women's issues. Although the organisation had formally resolved to merge with the Liberal Party, some preferred to retain an autonomous group, which continued for a time with considerably reduced members and activity. In 2004, the Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, spoke at a function commemorating the 100th anniversary of the foundation of the League, and paid tribute to its important role in the history of the Liberal Party and Australia. ==Notable members== * Jessie Ackermann – social reformer * Marie Breen – Senator for Victoria (1962–1968) * Janet Clarke – philanthropist, inaugural AWNL President * Elizabeth Couchman – AWNL President (1927–1945) * Eleanor Glencross – activist * Eva Hughes – political organiser * Enid Lyons – wife of Prime Minister Joseph Lyons, first woman elected to the House of Representatives (1943–1951) * May Moss – AWNL Vice-President (1906–1914), National Council of Women President (1931–1936) * Ivy Wedgwood – Senator for Victoria (1950–1971) ==References== * * * ==External links== *The Age Review of book on AWNL Category:Political advocacy groups in Australia Category:Liberal Party of Australia Category:Women's wings of political parties Category:Women's organisations based in Australia ","title":"Australian Women's National League"},{"id":"2565424","text":"Pinnacle State Park and Golf Course is a state park located in Steuben County, New York.

In his testimony before Congress regarding the Hawaiian Islands on January 3, 1894, William Alexander reported: > President Dole (of the Republic of Hawaii) and his colleagues have > elaborated a plan for giving the Kanakas homesteads out of the Crown lands, > not transferable, and further this condition of occupation. In 1921, the federal government of the United States set aside approximately in the Territory of Hawaii as a land trust for homesteading by Native Hawaiians. The law mandating this, passed by the U.S. Congress on July 9, 1921, was called the \\"Hawaiian Homes Commission Act\\" (HHCA) and, with amendments, is still in effect today. The act is often also attributed to the year 1920, when it was written. The avowed purpose of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act was to rehabilitate Native Hawaiians, particularly in returning them to the land to maintain traditional ties to the land. The Hawaiian politicians who testified in favor of the act specifically referred to the devastation of the Hawaiian population and the loss of the land, and the need for Hawaiians to be able to grow traditional crops such as kalo (taro). The Hawaiian Homes Commission Act included a controversial definition of \\"Native Hawaiians\\" as persons with 50% or more Hawaiian blood. Prince Kūhiō Kalanianaole, the territory's non-voting delegate to Congress, wanted a blood quantum of no less than 1/32. Primary responsibility for administering the trust has rested with: *1921-1960: the Hawaiian Homes Commission (a federal agency) *1960-present: the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL, a state agency) That is, responsibility was transferred to the state level after Hawaii became a state in 1959. The U.S. federal government nonetheless retains significant oversight responsibilities, including the exclusive right to sue for breach of trust. ==Purpose== Section 101, \\"Purpose\\", of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act explains the aims of the Hawaiian Homelands program as follows: : (a) ... to enable native Hawaiians to return to their lands in order to fully support self-sufficiency for native Hawaiians and the self-determination of native Hawaiians in the administration of this Act, and the preservation of the values, traditions, and culture of native Hawaiians. : (b) The principal purposes of this Act include but are not limited to: ::(1) Establishing a permanent land base for the benefit and use of native Hawaiians, upon which they may live, farm, ranch, and otherwise engage in commercial or industrial or any other activities as authorized in this Act; ::(2) Placing native Hawaiians on the lands set aside under this Act in a prompt and efficient manner and assuring long-term tenancy to beneficiaries of this Act and their successors; ::(3) Preventing alienation of the fee title to the lands set aside under this Act so that these lands will always be held in trust for continued use by native Hawaiians in perpetuity; ::(4) Providing adequate amounts of water and supporting infrastructure, so that homestead lands will always be usable and accessible; and ::(5) Providing financial support and technical assistance to native Hawaiian beneficiaries of this Act so that by pursuing strategies to enhance economic self-sufficiency and promote community-based development, the traditions, culture and quality of life of native Hawaiians shall be forever self-sustaining. :(c) In recognition of the solemn trust created by this Act, and the historical government to government relationship between the United States and Kingdom of Hawaii, the United States and the State of Hawaii hereby acknowledge the trust established under this Act and affirm their fiduciary duty to faithfully administer the provisions of this Act on behalf of the native Hawaiian beneficiaries of the Act. :(d) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to: ::(1) Affect the rights of the descendants of the indigenous citizens of the Kingdom of Hawaii to seek redress of any wrongful activities associated with the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii; or ::(2) Alter the obligations of the United States and the State of Hawaii to carry out their public trust responsibilities under section 5 of the Admission Act to native Hawaiians and other descendants of the indigenous citizens of the Kingdom of Hawaii.

It is named after Colonel Durival Britto e Silva, who was president of the RFFSA, the Brazilian Federal railroad company. ==History== It was built in 1947 as the home stadium of Clube Atlético Ferroviário. The first match was played there on January 23 of that year, when Fluminense Football Club from Rio de Janeiro beat Clube Atlético Ferroviário 5-1; the first goal scored by Fluminense's Careca. Estádio Vila Capanema During many years Estádio Vila Capanema was Curitiba's most modern and comfortable stadium with a capacity of 15,000 spectators. It was used for the 1950 FIFA World Cup games. On June 25, 1950, Spain beat the United States of America and in the 29th day of that month, Paraguay played against Sweden. Clube Atlético Ferroviário ceased operation in 1971 and Vila Capanema became Paraná Clube's home since the foundation of the club in 1989. In 2006, Estádio Vila Capanema was modernized and Paraná Clube opened the stadium again after four years. The capacity of the stadium was boosted to 20,083 fans.

Seedling development starts with germination of the seed. A typical young seedling consists of three main parts: the radicle (embryonic root), the hypocotyl (embryonic shoot), and the cotyledons (seed leaves). The two classes of flowering plants (angiosperms) are distinguished by their numbers of seed leaves: monocotyledons (monocots) have one blade-shaped cotyledon, whereas dicotyledons (dicots) possess two round cotyledons. Gymnosperms are more varied. For example, pine seedlings have up to eight cotyledons. The seedlings of some flowering plants have no cotyledons at all. These are said to be acotyledons. The plumule is the part of a seed embryo that develops into the shoot bearing the first true leaves of a plant. In most seeds, for example the sunflower, the plumule is a small conical structure without any leaf structure. Growth of the plumule does not occur until the cotyledons have grown above ground. This is epigeal germination. However, in seeds such as the broad bean, a leaf structure is visible on the plumule in the seed. These seeds develop by the plumule growing up through the soil with the cotyledons remaining below the surface. This is known as hypogeal germination. ==Photomorphogenesis and etiolation== Dicot seedlings grown in the light develop short hypocotyls and open cotyledons exposing the epicotyl. This is also referred to as photomorphogenesis. In contrast, seedlings grown in the dark develop long hypocotyls and their cotyledons remain closed around the epicotyl in an apical hook. This is referred to as skotomorphogenesis or etiolation. Etiolated seedlings are yellowish in color as chlorophyll synthesis and chloroplast development depend on light. They will open their cotyledons and turn green when treated with light. In a natural situation, seedling development starts with skotomorphogenesis while the seedling is growing through the soil and attempting to reach the light as fast as possible. During this phase, the cotyledons are tightly closed and form the apical hook to protect the shoot apical meristem from damage while pushing through the soil. In many plants, the seed coat still covers the cotyledons for extra protection. Upon breaking the surface and reaching the light, the seedling's developmental program is switched to photomorphogenesis. The cotyledons open upon contact with light (splitting the seed coat open, if still present) and become green, forming the first photosynthetic organs of the young plant. Until this stage, the seedling lives off the energy reserves stored in the seed. The opening of the cotyledons exposes the shoot apical meristem and the plumule consisting of the first true leaves of the young plant. The seedlings sense light through the light receptors phytochrome (red and far-red light) and cryptochrome (blue light). Mutations in these photo receptors and their signal transduction components lead to seedling development that is at odds with light conditions, for example seedlings that show photomorphogenesis when grown in the dark.. ==Seedling growth and maturation== Seedling of a dicot, Nandina domestica, showing two green cotyledon leaves, and the first \\"true\\" leaf with its distinct leaflets and red-green color. Once the seedling starts to photosynthesize, it is no longer dependent on the seed's energy reserves. The apical meristems start growing and give rise to the root and shoot. The first \\"true\\" leaves expand and can often be distinguished from the round cotyledons through their species- dependent distinct shapes. While the plant is growing and developing additional leaves, the cotyledons eventually senesce and fall off. Seedling growth is also affected by mechanical stimulation, such as by wind or other forms of physical contact, through a process called thigmomorphogenesis. Temperature and light intensity interact as they affect seedling growth; at low light levels about 40 lumens/m² a day/night temperature regime of 28 °C/13 °C is effective (Brix 1972).Brix, H. 1972. Growth response of Sitka spruce and white spruce seedlings to temperature and light intensity. Can. Dep. Environ., Can. For. Serv., Pacific For. Res. Centre, Victoria BC, Inf. Rep. BC-X-74. 17 p. A photoperiod shorter than 14 hours causes growth to stop, whereas a photoperiod extended with low light intensities to 16 h or more brings about continuous (free) growth. Little is gained by using more than 16 h of low light intensity once seedlings are in the free growth mode. Long photoperiods using high light intensities from 10,000 to 20,000 lumens/m² increase dry matter production, and increasing the photoperiod from 15 to 24 hours may double dry matter growth (Pollard and Logan 1976, Carlson 1979).Pollard, D.F.W.; Logan, K.T. 1976. Prescription for the aerial environment for a plastic greenhouse nursery. p.181–191 in Proc. 12th Lake States For. Tree Improv. Conf. 1975. USDA, For. Serv., North Central For. Exp.

Rep. NOR-X-214. 62 p. (Cited in Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). The effects of carbon dioxide enrichment and nitrogen supply on the growth of white spruce and trembling aspen were investigated by Brown and Higginbotham (1986).Brown, K.; Higginbotham, K.O. 1986. Effects of carbon dioxide enrichment and nitrogen supply on growth of boreal tree seedlings. Tree Physiol. 2(1/3):223–232. Seedlings were grown in controlled environments with ambient or enriched atmospheric CO2 (350 or 750 f1/L, respectively) and with nutrient solutions with high, medium, and low N content (15.5, 1.55, and 0.16 mM). Seedlings were harvested, weighed, and measured at intervals of less than 100 days. N supply strongly affected biomass accumulation, height, and leaf area of both species. In white spruce only, the root weight ratio (RWR) was significantly increased with the low-nitrogen regime. CO2 enrichment for 100 days significantly increased the leaf and total biomass of white spruce seedlings in the high-N regime, RWR of seedlings in the medium-N regime, and root biomass of seedlings in the low-N regime. First-year seedlings typically have high mortality rates, drought being the principal cause, with roots having been unable to develop enough to maintain contact with soil sufficiently moist to prevent the development of lethal seedling water stress. Somewhat paradoxically, however, Eis (1967a)Eis, S. 1967a. Establishment and early development of white spruce in the interior of British Columbia. For. Chron. 43:174–177. observed that on both mineral and litter seedbeds, seedling mortality was greater in moist habitats (alluvium and Aralia–Dryopteris) than in dry habitats (Cornus–Moss). He commented that in dry habitats after the first growing season surviving seedlings appeared to have a much better chance of continued survival than those in moist or wet habitats, in which frost heave and competition from lesser vegetation became major factors in later years. The annual mortality documented by Eis (1967a) is instructive. ===Pests and diseases=== Seedlings are particularly vulnerable to attack by pests and diseasesBuczacki, S. and Harris, K., Pests, Diseases & Disorders of Garden Plants, HarperCollins, 1998, p115 and can consequently experience high mortality rates. Pests and diseases which are especially damaging to seedlings include damping off, cutworms, slugs and snails.Buczacki, S. and Harris, K., Pests, Diseases & Disorders of Garden Plants, HarperCollins, 1998, p116 ==Transplanting== Seedlings are generally transplanted when the first pair of true leaves appear. A shade may be provided if the area is arid or hot. A commercially available vitamin hormone concentrate may be used to avoid transplant shock which may contain thiamine hydrochloride, 1-Naphthaleneacetic acid and indole butyric acid. ==Images== File:Scots pine seedling in natural environment.jpgA few days old Scots pine seedling, the seed still protecting the cotyledons.

He held a number of offices, including Secretary of State and Superintendent of Finances, and distinguished himself in diplomacy throughout the 1630s, particularly in respect to France's entry into the Thirty Years' War. He was a shrewd diplomat who enjoyed exceptional favour with all factions of the French court, particularly Cardinal Richelieu and Marie de Medici. At the height of his power he was the second most powerful man in France, after Richelieu himself. == Early life == Claude Bouthillier was born in 1581, the son of Denis Bouthillier, a clerk in the service of François de La Porte, Cardinal Richelieu's maternal grandfather. When La Porte died, he left his professional law practice to Denis Bouthillier, as well as entrusting him with the well-being of La Porte's orphaned grandchildren. This created a strong connection between the La Porte and Bouthillier families and saw the Bouthilliers greatly increase their power and wealth. == Career == Claude Bouthillier began his professional life as an advocate. In 1613 he became a councillor in the Parlement of Paris. In 1619 Richelieu recommended him to the queen-mother, Marie de Medici, which lead to his position as \\"Executive Secretary to the Queen-mother\\". Cardinal Richelieu also secured for him the title of secretary of state in 1628. In 1632 he became Superintendent of Finances. In spite of the fierce rivalry developing between Marie de Medici and Richelieu, he was able to remain on good terms with both, which placed him in a highly enviable position at the French court. === Diplomacy === Richelieu employed him on many diplomatic missions, and the success of his foreign policy was due in no small degree to Bouthillier's ability and devotion. In 1630 he had taken part at Regensburg in arranging the abortive treaty between the emperor and France. From 1633 to 1640 he was continually busied with secret missions in Germany, sometimes alone, sometimes with Father Joseph. Following Richelieu's instructions, he negotiated the alliances which brought France into the Thirty Years' War. Meanwhile, at home, his tact and amiable disposition, as well as his reputation for straightforwardness, had secured for him a unique position of influence in a court torn by jealousies and intrigues. Trusted by the king, the confidant of Richelieu, the friend of Marie de Medici, and through his son, Leon, who was appointed in 1635 chancellor to Gaston d'Orléans, able to bring his influence to bear on that prince, he was an invaluable mediator; and the personal influence thus exercised, combined with the fact that he was at the head of both the finances and the foreign policy of France, made him, next to the cardinal, the most powerful man in the kingdom. Richelieu made him executor of his will, and Louis XIII named him a member of the council of regency which he intended should govern the kingdom after his death. === Retirement === The king's last plans were not carried out, and Bouthillier was obliged to retire into private life, giving up his office of superintendent of finances in June 1643. He died in Paris on 13 March 1652. == Family == Claude Bouthillier had three brothers, all of whom became distinguished member of French society and staunch allies of Richelieu. Victor Le Bouthillier, was a statesman and member of the clergy who served as Archbishop of Tours between 1641 and 1670. Sébastien Bouthillier, was bishop of Aire and played an important role in obtaining Richelieu's return from exile to Avignon in 1619. Denis Bouthillier, Lord of Rancé, was a state councillor and advisor of Marie de Medici. Denis' son, Armand Jean le Bouthillier de Rancé, was the founder of the Trappist monastic order. Claude Bouthillier married Marie de Bragelogne and had one child, Léon Bouthillier, comte de Chavigny (1608–1652). Léon quickly became an associate to his father, who took him with him from 1629 to 1632 to all the great courts of Europe, instructing him in diplomacy. In 1632 he was named secretary of state and seconded his father's work, so that it is not easy always to distinguish their respective parts. He was accompanied on various errands by Jean François Sarrazin. After the death of Louis XIII he had to give up his office; but was sent as plenipotentiary to the negotiations at Münster. He showed himself incapable, however, giving himself up to pleasure and fetes, and returned to France to intrigue against Mazarin. Arrested twice during the Fronde, and then for a short time in power during Mazarin's exile (April 1651), he busied himself with small intrigues which came to nothing. His many children married in several important aristocratic families, further establishing the Bouthillier family's influence. ==References== * Category:French Foreign Ministers Category:1581 births Category:1652 deaths Category:French Ministers of Finance Category:17th-century French diplomats ","title":"Claude Bouthillier"},{"id":"2565483","text":"Chris Bombolas (born 12 May 1960) (often known as Bomber) is a communications and media specialist, and a television and radio presenter.

After undergoing National Service with the RAAF in 1955, Crocker toured with a theatre group and did the club circuit in Melbourne, followed by a partnership with David Clark (aka Dave Nelson), and performed in England and the United States. He returned to Australia in 1966 to star in a TV musical comedy show called 66 And All That, in 1966 hence the title which became the eponymous The Barry Crocker Show (1966–67) on Channel 10 Sydney (now Network Ten). This was followed by the musical variety show Say It With Music (1967–1969), also broadcast on Ten. Crocker went on to become the presenter and leading performer on The Sound of Music TV series, taking over from entertainer Bobby Limb which earned him a Gold Logie in 1970 as Australia's top (male) TV personality. His singing talents eventually earned him over 30 Gold record. In 1971 Sound of Music was the 11th most popular show in the country. Crocker made his acting debut on a 1969 episode of Skippy the Bush Kangaroo. He has been in a relationship with English actress Katy Manning since 1990, although she moved back to the UK in 2010 and they maintain a long-distance relationship. ==Music career== In 1959, after successfully touring and a number of television appearances, he convinced Cyril Stevens of Spotlight Records in Thornbury to give him and his musical partner to see him. Cyril, who was a photographer by trade, had set up a recording studio in the early 1950s. He recorded manly Jazz and musical events around Victoria. Barry and Dave Clark were about to leave, Cyril wasn't impressed, when Cyril's son entered the room. He recognised the pair from television and concerts, and convinced his father to record the team. Two e.p.'s were recorded totaling eight tracks. The records were Spotlights' highest sellers.The Adventures of Barry Crocker: Bazza.

The \\"bogan\\" character of Barry McKenzie gave rise to Crocker recording such ribald songs as \\"My One Eyed Trouser Snake\\" and other \\"off-colour\\" songs. Barry Crocker was Beresford's first choice as lead actor when it came to the filming of David Williamson's popular play Don's Party, but serious back problems curtailed Crocker's screen career at this point, opening the way for John Hargreaves to achieve film success in the coveted role of Don. Nevertheless, Barry Crocker was crowned Melbourne's King of Moomba in 1976, at the annual entertainment festivalCraig Bellamy, Gordon Chisholm, Hilary Eriksen (17 February 2006) Moomba: A festival for the people PDF pp 17–22 He had the lead role as Governor Alan Smith in the short-lived prison drama Punishment (1981). He guest starred on two episodes of the Australian satirical black comedy series Review with Myles Barlow. More recent TV roles have included parts in Pizza, Swift'N'Shift, and Housos for SBS and the Strange Calls, an ABC2 comedy series. In 1994, Crocker appeared as himself in the worldwide record-breaking film Muriel's Wedding. Barry proved his acting/comedy credentials once again as the retro-disco-host Donny Destry in the movie Razzle Dazzle in 2009. Crocker appeared as Charles \\"Hoot\\" Russell, Greg Russell's father in the Hey Dad..! episode \\"Hoot's Boots\\". This was the second-to-last episode of the show, which spanned 14 seasons. A DVD box set of \\"Hey Dad\\" has had to be abandoned, following the conviction of the original \\"Dad\\" – Robert Hughes – on several sex charges. Crocker was chosen by Chaim Topol to co-star as his nemesis Lazer Wolfe in a long-running Australian season of the musical Fiddler on the Roof. He also featured in the role of The Lecturer in the 2008 Australian premiere of the stage musical Reefer Madness. Crocker presented the Australian version of Behind Mansion Walls on the Crime and Investigation network on Foxtel in Australia. Crocker published an autobiography called Bazza – The Adventures of Barry Crocker, in 2003. ==Other appearances== In 2005, Crocker was featured on the Nine Network program This Is Your Life. It was a rare accolade, as Barry had already been the subject of this prestigious TV program thirty years earlier, in 1975, when the show was hosted by Roger Climpson. Barry was caught by surprise when host Mike Munro and the TV production team arrived, after a lot of careful planning by his long-term partner, Katy Manning, the popular English actress. At the time, Crocker was still performing his self-created long-running, award-winning one-man show Barry Crocker's Banjo on a regular basis, bringing the true-life story of A. B. Banjo Paterson to audiences young and old across Australia. ==In popular culture== During the 1980s, the rhyming slang expression, \\"Barry Crocker\\" or simply \\"Barry\\" or \\"Baz\\" emerged in Australian English, to mean a \\"shocker\\", as in \\"very poor\\". The most recent public, and very deliberate, use of this expression was infamously seen on the front page of Sydney's Daily Telegraph on Thursday, 17 April 2014, when NSW Liberal Premier Barry O'Farrell was forced to resign, allegedly for accepting a gift of an expensive bottle of wine without declaring it, and then later denying in court that he had even received the gift.

The square is located at the west end of George Street and was intended to mirror St. Andrew Square in the east. The gardens are private and not publicly accessible. ==History== Initially named St. George's Square in James Craig's original plan, it was renamed in 1786 after King George III's Queen and first daughter, to avoid confusion with George Square to the south of the Old Town. Charlotte Square was the last part of the initial phase of the New Town to be \\"completed\\" in 1820 (note- the north-west section at Glenfinlas Street was not completed until 1990 due to a long- running boundary dispute). Much of it was to the 1791 design of Robert Adam, who died in 1792, just as building began. In 1939 a very sizable air-raid shelter was created under the south side of the gardens, accessed from the street to the south. In 2013 the south side was redeveloped in an award- winning scheme by Paul Quinn, creating major new office floorspace behind a restored series of townhouses. Edinburgh Collegiate School was located in Charlotte Square. ==Gardens== The garden was originally laid out as a level circular form by William Weir in 1808.Buildings of Scotland: Edinburgh by Gifford, McWilliam and Walker In 1861 a plan was drawn up by Robert Matheson, Clerk of Works for Scotland for a larger, more square garden, centred upon a memorial to the recently deceased Prince Albert, the consort of Queen Victoria. The commission for the sculpture was granted in 1865 to Sir John Steell. The main statue features an equestrian statue of the prince, in field marshal's uniform, dwarfing the four figures around the base. It was unveiled by Queen Victoria herself in 1876.Gunnis, Rupert. Dictionary of British Sculptors, 1660-1857 The stone plinth was designed by the architect David Bryce and the four corner figures are by David Watson Stevenson (Science and Learning/Labour), George Clark Stanton (Army and Navy) and William Brodie (Nobility). The statue was originally intended to go in the centre of the eastern edge of the garden, facing down George Street.Monuments and monumental inscriptions in Scotland: The Grampian Society, 1871 This remodelling featured major new tree-planting which took many years to re-establish. The central open space is a private garden, available to owners of the surrounding properties. For the last three weeks in August each year Charlotte Square gardens are the site of the Edinburgh International Book Festival. The railings around the gardens were removed in 1940 as part of the war effort. The current railings date from 1947. ==Buildings== On the north side, No. 5 was the home of John Crichton-Stuart, 4th Marquess of Bute (1881–1947), who bought it in 1903 and gave it to the National Trust for Scotland on his death. It was the Trust headquarters from 1949 to 2000. Bute did much to promote the preservation of the Square. Bute House, the official residence of the First Minister of Scotland Nos. 6 and 7 are also owned by the National Trust for Scotland. No.6, Bute House is the official residence of the First Minister of Scotland. In 1806 it was home to Sir John Sinclair creator of the first Statistical Account of Scotland. No. 7 was internally restored by the Trust in 1975 to its original state, and is open to the public as The Georgian House. The upper floor was formerly the official residence of the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. The building includes one fireplace brought from Hill of Tarvit in Fife in 1975. West Register House, formerly St. George's Church, forms the centre of the west side. It was designed by the architect Robert Reid in 1811, broadly to Adam's plan. The church opened in 1814 and was converted to its current use in 1964. It is one of the main buildings of the National Records of Scotland ==Residents== From the very inception of Charlotte Square in 1791, it was anticipated it would be one of the top addresses in Edinburgh. As the Victorian era commenced, the square was increasingly occupied by the elite of the middle class: legal and medical professionals. This is reflected in the notable residents listed below. As the 20th century began most buildings were still occupied as residential addresses, although more are offices, solely occupied by guardians. { class=\\" sortable collapsible\\" !Side !data-sort- type=\\"Number\\" Number !Resident - rowspan=14North 4 data-sort- value=\\"Barbour, Alexander Hugh Freeland\\"Sir Alexander Hugh Freeland Barbour lived at no.4 (previously occupied by Rev Dr David Aitken FRSE) - 4 \\"Rev Dr David Aitken\\" FRSE - 5 data-sort-value=\\"Fergusson, James\\"Sir James Fergusson, 4th baronet (1765-1838) lived at no.5 - 5 data-sort- value=\\"Robert Nasmyth\\"Robert Nasmyth FRSE, dentist to Queen Victoria (1792-1870) - 6, Bute House data-sort-value=\\"Mitchell-Thomson, Mitchell\\"Sir Mitchell Mitchell-Thomson, 1st BaronetEdinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1905-6 Office of the First Minister of Scotland - rowspan=2 7, The Georgian House data-sort-value=\\"Neaves, Charles\\"Charles Neaves, Lord Neaves - data-sort-value=\\"Whyte, Alexander\\"Rev Alexander Whyte, Minister of St. George's West Free Church in Shandwick Place was resident in 1901 - 8 data-sort-value=\\"Ronaldson, Thomas R\\"Thomas R Ronaldson, General Practitioner, was resident in 1901, together with his son Thomas Martine Ronaldson, artist - rowspan=49 data-sort-value=\\"Robertson, Patrick\\"Patrick Robertson, Lord Robertson - data-sort-value=\\"Syme, James\\"James Syme, Surgeon - data-sort-value=\\"Lister, Joseph\\"Joseph Lister, Son-in-law of James Syme - data-sort-value=\\"Seton-Steuart, Douglas Archibald\\"Sir Douglas Archibald Seton-Steuart, 5th and final Seton-Steuart baronet was resident in 1901 - 10 data-sort-value=\\"Begbie, James\\"James Begbie, Surgeon - 11 data-sort-value=\\"McBean, Aenas\\"Aeneas MacBean WS - rowspan=13West rowspan=212 data-sort-value=\\"Hope-Vere, James Joseph\\"James Joseph Hope-Vere Member of Parliament for Linlithgowshire, 1743-68 - data-sort-value=\\"Robertson, James Morton\\"James Morton Robertson wine Merchant was resident in 1901 - rowspan=213 data-sort-value=\\"Fettes, William\\"Sir William Fettes, Scottish Businessman whose bequest led to the foundation of Fettes College - data-sort-value=\\"Caird, Francis Mitchell\\"Francis Mitchell Caird, President of the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh - 14 data-sort-value=\\"Cockburn, Henry\\"Lord Cockburn, Whig lawyer, historian and conservationist and afterwards Georbge Moir - 15 data-sort-value=\\"Cooper, Charles Alfred\\"Charles Alfred Cooper, editor of The Scotsman - 16 data-sort-value=\\"Watson, Patrick Heron\\"Patrick Heron Watson, surgeon and pioneer of anaesthetic development and modern dentistry was resident in 1901 - 17 data-sort-value=\\"Haldane, Richard\\"Viscount Haldane was born at No.17. - 17 data-sort-value=\\"Murray, James Wolfe\\"James Wolfe Murray, Lord Cringletie in the 1830s - rowspan=2 19 data-sort- value=\\"Sandilands\\"Lord Torphichen - data-sort-value=\\"Stewart, Thomas Grainger\\"Thomas Grainger Stewart, president of the Royal College of Physicians.

She is also the mother of Sam McCall, Kristina Davis and Molly Lansing. ==Casting== Nancy Lee Grahn, known for her Emmy winning portrayal of Julia Wainwright on Santa Barbara, made her first appearance as Alexis on September 26, 1996,https://twitter.com/NancyLeeGrahn/status/1177272266662367232http://soapzone.com/gh/daily- updates/1996-09-26.html on a recurring basis. In late May, early June 1997, Grahn was put on contract with the series due to her popularity among fans. Susan Diol temporarily played the role from November 2001 to March 2002, when Grahn's father died. In 2010, Grahn announced she had renewed her contract for an additional four years. ==Storylines== ===Background=== Alexis is the daughter of Mikkos Cassadine, a Greco-Russian prince, and his mistress Kristin Bergman, a Swedish opera singer. Mikkos' wife Helena Cassadine slit Kristin's throat in front of young Alexis, who then developed partial amnesia and forgot her true identity. Alexis was taken into Mikkos' house to be raised as a poor relative with the last name Davidovitch, while her infant sister Kristina disappeared. Alexis' half-brother Stavros Cassadine tormented her, but her other half-brother Stefan Cassadine (who believed at the time Alexis was his cousin) protected her, gaining her loyalty. While attending Briarton Griggs Academy, a boarding school in New Hampshire,mentioned by Sonny on 07/21/10. Alexis at 16 sees an opportunity to reinvent herself. She dresses up, sneaks out of boarding school and goes to a bar, where she meets Julian Jerome. The two have a one-night stand and she became pregnant. Her father, Mikkos Cassadine took the baby, and gave her up for adoption. Alexis graduated from Yale University as an undergraduate and earned a J.D. from Yale Law School. ===1996–2005=== In 1996, Stefan, who has instructed Alexis to change her last name to Davis, brings her to town for legal aid. Alexis is protective of Stefan, and tries to make him believe his lover Katherine Bell is his half- sister Natasha. Luke Spencer helps Alexis discover that she is actually the real Natasha. Helena uses this to force Alexis to help her gain control of the Cassadine empire. By doing so, Alexis receives her princess birthright, a title she later gives up. In an attempt to avenge her mother's death, she teams up with Luke to kill Helena, and mistakenly pushes Katherine off a parapet instead. Katherine is presumed dead and Stefan is put on trial; Alexis defends him and gets the charges dropped. Meanwhile, Alexis begins dating Ned Ashton. In 1999, in a complicated scheme to help Chloe Morgan save her company, Ned marries Chloe and Alexis marries Jasper Jacks. Chloe eventually loses her company, and the couples divorce. Ned then proposes to Alexis, but she developed cold feet and talked to Ned right before the wedding and called it off. In 2000, Alexis teams up with mob boss Sonny Corinthos to defend troubled teen Zander Smith, which leads to Alexis reluctantly becoming the full-time lawyer for Sonny and his enforcer Jason Morgan. Meanwhile, in 2001, Jax helps Alexis find her presumed dead sister Kristina Carter. By 2002, Alexis and Sonny have continued to bond, which leads to a one-night stand witnessed by Carly Corinthos, Sonny's estranged wife at the time. Alexis learns she is pregnant, but does not tell Sonny due to his dangerous lifestyle. Ned, who is dating her sister Kristina, agrees to claim to be the father. Kristina dies in a warehouse explosion meant for Sonny and set up by Luis Alcazar. At Kristina's memorial service, Alexis berates Sonny, blaming him for her death. Alexis gives birth to a girl she names Kristina after her sister. Alexis impersonates butler Dobson in order to spend more time with her daughter. Alexis confronts Luis Alcazar about her sister's death, to which Alcazar threatens Alexis and she accidentally pushes him to his death. In 2003, she fakes dissociative identity disorder to avoid jail time, while Ned is given custody of Kristina and brings her to live with the Quartermaine family. Alexis disguises herself as a man named Dobson and begins working at the Quartermaine mansion to be closer to her daughter. With the help of psychiatrist Cameron Lewis, Alexis eventually regains full custody of Kristina. When Kristina is diagnosed with aplastic anemia and needs bone marrow, Alexis is forced to tell Sonny the truth. Kristina's only hope is from stem cells from the unborn child of Sonny and his former lover Sam McCall. Alexis desperately attempts to convince Sam to induce labor two weeks early. However, Sam collapses while they're arguing, and her baby is stillborn. Kristina gets the stem cells she needs, and recovers. Alexis gets involved with Sonny's half-brother, Ric Lansing. Both actors were excited about the pairing, as Grahn told TV Guide, \\"They're a match. When Alexis gives, Ric can give it right back.\\" The two marry and get pregnant. Alexis comes close to death giving birth to Molly during a train wreck caused by Manny Ruiz, a dangerous criminal. Alexis becomes the court-appointed defense lawyer for Manny, and gets him acquitted despite everyone's warnings about him going free. ===2006–11=== During the encephalitis epidemic, Alexis receives the last antidote over Sam's brother Danny McCall. Danny dies, which increases Sam's animosity towards Alexis. When she recovers, Alexis decides to find the daughter that she was forced to give up for adoption as a teenager. She is led to believe the girl died, but Jason tells Alexis that her daughter is none other than Sam. When Sam is nearly killed by Manny, Alexis pressures Jason to break up with Sam for her safety. Furious with Alexis' meddling and Jason's choice, Sam gets drunk and sleeps with Ric. Alexis and Jason both witness this. Before she can confront them, Alexis is diagnosed with second-stage lung cancer, and has to undergo chemotherapy. She recovers, and files for divorce from Ric. Knowing Alexis used medical marijuana to counter her chemotherapy, Ric gets full custody of Molly. However, when his father, Zacchara mob lawyer Trevor Lansing, threatens to take Molly away, Ric gives Molly back to Alexis. Sam and Alexis also repair their relationship, and start to bond. Alexis becomes the District Attorney and befriends Sonny's new attorney Diane Miller. When Alexis charges Mayor Floyd with the murder of his mistress, he reveals that they slept together years before when Alexis had cancer. Alexis has to deal with the resulting fallout from the scandal, as well as a teenage Kristina, rebellious and headstrong. Though Sam tells Alexis her concerns about Kristina, Alexis blames Sonny's son, Michael, for Kristina's troubles. She is faced with the reality of Kristina's situation when Alexis' car is proven to have run Claudia Zacchara off the road, leading to the death of her unborn child. Alexis realizes Kristina was responsible, and confesses to protect her daughter. She's also accused of murdering the mayor's mistress. With the help of her nephew, Nikolas Cassadine, and Diane, Alexis gets a light sentence, though she's forced to resign as the District Attorney. Kristina's problems do not end there, though, and she is hospitalized after being beaten up by her boyfriend, Kiefer Bauer. While driving Kristina to the hospital, Alexis ends up running over Kiefer, killing him. She is not prosecuted, infuriating Kiefer's father, Warren. He continually tries to get Alexis prosecuted, and when his attempts fail, he becomes deranged and opens fire inside General Hospital. He tries to kill Kristina, but he is shot and killed by Mac Scorpio before he can. Kristina and Molly try to set up Alexis with Mac, and though they go on a few dates, Alexis decides she's not interested in Mac. In order to keep Kristina from dating the older Ethan Lovett, Alexis has Sonny pull strings so Kristina can get into Yale. Kristina is accepted, and leaves for college. Alexis begrudgingly lets Molly, now in high school, date T.J. Ashford. Alexis starts dating Shawn Butler, T.J.'s guardian. She becomes an attorney in Diane's firm, and is involved in various cases during this time, including the custody battle of Josslyn Jacks, and Maxie Jones' trial for the murder of Lisa Niles. ===2012–=== Alexis is hospitalized after being lured into a trap by Jerry Jacks, her old flame. He later reveals that he was actually inoculating her against a pathogen that he put in the Port Charles water supply, infecting the whole town. He demands a large sum of money in exchange for the antidote. Jerry kidnaps her, hoping to disappear with Alexis and the money. However, Shawn rescues Alexis, and the antidote is recovered, saving the town. Alexis becomes a grandmother when Sam has a son with Jason, Danny Morgan. When Danny is diagnosed with leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant, Sam asks Alexis about her biological father when no one proves to be a match. Alexis reveals that Sam's father was a man she met for only one night, and never saw again. Wanting to help Sam and Danny, Alexis undergoes hypnosis and finds out Sam's father's name is Julian. Sam and Alexis find a donor match for Danny from Derek Wells. Alexis becomes attracted to Derek, though she tries to downplay it. When Alexis hears Shawn mention Julian Jerome, a mobster presumed dead, she suspects that Julian might be Sam's father. She and Sam eventually get proof that Julian is Sam's biological father. Alexis eventually finds out that \\"Derek\\" is actually Julian, and he's looking to rebuild his mob empire. In his bid to get Sonny's territory, Julian ends up hiding behind Danny, refusing to bank his bone marrow so that Sonny won't kill him. Both Alexis and Sam are disgusted, and push Julian away. However, Julian tells Alexis that he's also attracted to her, and he'll try to win her over. In an attempt to avoid Julian's romantic gestures, Alexis dates Ned. Julian, though, becomes even more determined to win Alexis over. When Julian leaves the mob to protect his family, Alexis decides to give him a chance, and they start dating. Julian proposes to her, and the two get married. However, Julian's past comes back to haunt him when his hit man, Carlos Rivera, is arrested for killing Duke Lavery. Alexis represents Carlos, to protect Julian from being implicated. Carlos and a witness who saw Duke's murder turn up dead, and Alexis realizes Julian is responsible for both murders. She tries to turn Julian in, but he hides the evidence that proves he killed Carlos. Alexis files for divorce, furious with Julian and his broken promises. Alexis is arrested for Carlos' murder, and Julian refuses to come forward to protect her. To exonerate herself, Alexis wears a wire and gets Julian to confess to the murders. However, he finds the wire, and tries to kill Alexis. Sonny saves Alexis, and Julian is arrested. While Julian is awaiting trial, Alexis' law license is suspended for a year because of her breach of ethics for defending Carlos. This, combined with Julian getting acquitted of the murder charges, pushes Alexis over the edge, and she turns to alcohol. Her drinking nearly kills Danny, and alienates her family. The only one who realizes Alexis' drinking problem is Julian, who is still in love with her. During Thanksgiving, Alexis bails on her family to go drinking, and Julian catches her. Alexis tries to escape, but Julian chases after her, and she ends up running him over. Panicked, Alexis runs away. Julian survives, but blackmails Alexis into taking care of him at her house until he recovers. Alexis' drinking gets worse, and she realizes that she may have killed Tom Baker while drunk. This revelation eventually gets Alexis to sober up, and she goes to AA, eventually reconciling with her family. She is cleared of Tom's murder when they find the real killer. Alexis finds out that her AA sponsor, \\"Liv Lowry,\\" is actually Olivia St. John, Julian's older sister who was presumed dead is alive and identifies her as Morgan's killer and as Robin's abductor with the help of Curtis, Jason, Sam, and Jordan. Alexis confronts Julian for letting Olivia get close to her, and writes him off. Olivia kidnaps Alexis soon after, and tries to get Julian to kill Alexis as payback for Julian killing Duke, whom Olivia was in love with. Instead, Julian helps Alexis escape. When he tries to fight Olivia, Julian disappears and is presumed dead. Alexis later finds a letter Julian left, saying Olivia threatened to kill his family for months if he didn't kill Alexis, and he was forced to do her bidding. Olivia was later arrested after Sonny and Carly found her at the cemetery. After Olivia was arrested, her defense attorney was Nora Buchanan from Llanview who was also her long lost half-brother Valentin's family attorney. One week after Olivia was sent to a mental asylum, the incident at the Floating Rib took place there involving revenge for Olivia Jerome. ==Reception== In 2001, California Lawyer magazine called Alexis \\"the best lawyer portrayed on network television today.\\" Grahn received Daytime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2000, 2011 and 2012; and for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2017.

Documentary evidence is most widely understood to refer to writings on paper (such as an invoice, a contract or a will), but the term can also apply to any media by which information can be preserved, such as photographs; a medium that needs a mechanical device to be viewed, such as a tape recording or film; and a printed form of digital evidence, such as emails or spreadsheets. Normally, before documentary evidence is admissible as evidence, it must be proved by other evidence from a witness that the document is genuine, called \\"laying a foundation\\". ==Documentary v. physical evidence== A piece of evidence is not documentary evidence if it is presented for some purpose other than the examination of the contents of the document. For example, if a blood-spattered letter is introduced solely to show that the defendant stabbed the author of the letter from behind as it was being written, then the evidence is physical evidence, not documentary evidence. However, a film of the murder taking place would be documentary evidence (just as a written description of the event from an eyewitness). If the content of that same letter is then introduced to show the motive for the murder, then the evidence would be both physical and documentary. ==Authentication== Documentary evidence is subject to specific forms of authentication, usually through the testimony of an eyewitness to the execution of the document, or to the testimony of a witness able to identify the handwriting of the purported author. Documentary evidence is also subject to the best evidence rule, which requires that the original document be produced unless there is a good reason not to do so.

Prior to 1832 the settlement was known as San Juan de Mata. === Los Zetas Massacre === In February, 2014, members of the Army, Navy, State, and Federal Police forces began searching for the remains of at least 300 residents of the region, who had been murdered in 2011 and buried in a series of clandestine graves in local ranches. The inhabitants had been seized by members of the Zetas criminal organization in retaliation for the theft of $5 million of drug-trafficking profits by an associate of the cartel's leaders. According to Hector Moreno, after he and Mario Alfonso Cuellar stole the money, the leaders of the Zetas, Miguel Angel Trevino (Z-40) and his brother Omar (Z-42) informed them that if they did not return the money, all of their friends and family would be killed. They carried out the threat, as members of the Zetas seized the towns of Allende and Nava, destroyed 80 houses with heavy machinery, and kidnapped approximately 80 families. These people were not seen again, until the operation began uncovering some of their bodies, many of which allegedly had been dissolved with a mixture of diesel fuel and caustic soda in large barrels of improvised \\"kitchens\\", in 2014. == Geography == The city of Allende is located at , at a height of above sea level.

Its vernacular names include cowfish, jollytail, common jollytail, eel gudgeon, inaka, native trout, pulangi, puye, slippery tarki, spotted minnow and whitebait. == Description == Common galaxias have iridescent silver eyes, undersides, and gill covers, and some have an iridescent green stripe along the top of their bodies which can be intermittently seen as they swim. Their specific name maculatus (\\"spotted\\") comes from the pattern of dark- mottled, leopard-like spots on an olive-brown background along their upper bodies. This pattern ranges from very subtle to quite bold. Common galaxias have slightly forked tails, unlike other most other galaxiids, which have square tails. Adults typically range from in length, with an average of . The maximum reported length . They are commonly found in small schools or shoals in slow-moving water, but can be more solitary in swifter streams. == Distribution and habitat == Common galaxias are one of the most widely distributed freshwater fish in the world. They inhabit Chile (35–55°S), Patagonia, Argentina, the Falkland Islands, some Pacific Islands such as New Caledonia, New Zealand, and coastal streams in southeastern Australia, Tasmania, and southwest Western Australia. Adults are mainly found in still or slow-moving water in the lower parts of coastal streams and rivers, or around the edges of lagoons; they can tolerate a wide range of natural conditions. If oxygen levels are low as a result of eutrophication, they can jump out of the water (emerse) and take up oxygen through their skin as a last resort.Urbina M.A, Glover C.N., Foster M.E. 2012. A novel oxyconforming response in the freshwater fish Galaxias maculatus. Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A 161, 301- 06.Urbina M.A, Foster M.E, Glover C.N. 2011. Leap of faith: Voluntary emersion behaviour and physiological adaptations to aerial exposure in a non-aestivating freshwater fish in response to aquatic hypoxia. Physiology and Behavior 103, 240-247. They need access to riparian vegetation for spawning, and usually live in river systems with access to the sea, as their larval stage is marine. They tend to be found in lower-elevation streams as unlike other species of Galaxias they cannot climb past waterfalls. Common galaxias can become land-locked (such as in five lakes in Northland, New Zealand), feeding and breeding in large beds of reeds. == Life history == The milky white colour of the water is from male sperm following spawning. This species is usually considered amphidromous, a particular type of diadromy meaning that reproduction occurs in fresh water and larval growth occurs in the sea. ===Reproduction=== Adult fish typically reach sexual maturity at one year and spawning is triggered by changes in day length and temperature. Unless landlocked within a lake, the common galaxias spawns mainly in autumn during spring tides in the tidally influenced reaches of rivers and streams but spawning in winter and spring has occurred. The eggs are laid en masse amongst flooded riparian vegetation by females. Male fish then release sperm into the water and the eggs are fertilised externally. This type of spawning is called polygynandry. Eggs remain attached to the vegetation as the tide recedes. Two types of reproductive strategy occur: A 'boom bust' strategy whereby spawning occurs in one event and is followed by death, semelparity, or spawning over multiple events before death iteroparity. === Egg development=== Eggs (about 1 mm diameter) develop in the vegetation for 2–4 weeks. Environmental conditions in the vegetation (particularly temperature and humidity) are critical for successful egg development. Egg mortality occurs from excess exposure to sunlight, predation from mice and spiders, grazing and trampling by livestock, mowing of bankside vegetation in urban areas, and flooding. The following spring tide floods the eggs stimulating them to hatch. === Marine life === A newly hatched G. maculatus larva After hatching, the 7-mm-long larvae are swept out to sea and spend 3–6 months in the marine environment. This phase of their lifecycle is little understood, as the larvae are small, transparent, and difficult to locate. The speed and direction of ocean currents play an important role in their dispersal; temperature and food availability are also important in determining how long they spend at sea. This marine dispersal phase is a critical part of the common galaxias's lifecycle, because it gives larvae from different populations or rivers the opportunity to 'connect'. When the juveniles are sufficiently grown, about 30–55 mm in length, they migrate back into fresh water. The juveniles form large shoals as they move through estuaries. Some of their life is spent in the lower reaches of rivers, where they metamorphose, before spending their adult life in suitable freshwater habitat. Some individuals return to the river they were born in (natal homing), but most return to rivers other than their birth site. === Freshwater life=== Following metamorphosis, adult spend around 6 months in fresh water, where they gain sufficient growth and energy to begin investing in reproduction. Males generally reach sexual maturity earlier and at a smaller size than females. ====Parasites==== In New Zealand, Deretrema philippae (=Limnoderetrema minutum) is known to parasitise the intestine (and possibly gall bladder) of the common galaxias. Similarly, the intestinal parasite Steganoderma szidati has been reported from this species' Argentinian population. These are digenean flatworms.(Etchegoin et al. 2002). === Fishing === The juveniles are caught as whitebait while moving upstream and are much valued as a delicacy, leading to their protection with licensing and controlled fishing seasons to preserve adult populations. They are fished commercially in New Zealand, Chile, and Argentina, but the last Australian commercial fishery closed in Tasmania in the 1970s. Some jurisdictions permit fishing of the adults, but again under regulation or licence to preserve the adult population, but others ban it altogether unless the fisher belongs to an indigenous people (e.g., New Zealand Māori). For instance, in Tasmania, the adult common galaxias may only be caught using a pole of a specified maximum size (1 m). == Conservation == Galaxiid species are, in general, threatened by human activities such as intensive agriculture and land change use. These activities have removed vegetation from stream banks that are needed for spawning to protect eggs from the sun. The increased nutrient input into streams from farming can lead to eutrophication. In New Zealand, their conservation status is declining, mostly because of habitat loss and degradation. As adults, common galaxias eat insects, crustaceans, and molluscs. This is the same diet as introduced trout, which not only compete for food, but also readily eat them. In areas where trout have become naturalised, common galaxias are scarce. Common galaxias, therefore, are mostly found in stretches of streams and rivers that are less suitable for introduced trout. ===Restoration=== In parts of New Zealand, this species spawning habitat has become degraded due to activities related to agriculture, urbanisation, and land use change. This creates sink populations in rivers as adult fish have nowhere suitable to lay their eggs and the majority of eggs dies. Because these sink rivers produce no eggs or larvae, a gap is created during marine dispersal. No opportunities exist for the exchange of larvae from these sink populations with other populations. However, these sink populations can receive larvae that were born in different rivers. They will not be able to successfully reproduce and the sink cycle continues. Innovative methods to restore the riparian spawning habitat include using straw bales as a temporary replacement for vegetation. Straw bales provide the same conditions and physical structure as natural vegetation, enabling the eggs to develop successfully. This method ensures that eggs and larvae are produced and that each river is a source of larvae. Exclusion of livestock and fencing of the bank-side vegetation is also an effective method to encourage regrowth of suitable vegetation. Restoration of the spawning habitat helps to maintain connectivity between larvae from different rivers during marine dispersal. ==References== * * Etchegoin, Jorge A.; Cremonte, Florencia & Escalante, Alicia H.

He has been described as “one of the masters of the instrument”. ==Biography== Jackson touring the Netherlands with Al Di Meola in 1978 Jackson played piano before starting guitar in his teens. When he turned to bass guitar, he was inspired by James Jamerson and Jack Casady.Bass Player magazine, Spring 1990 issue, USA Jackson worked as a session musician, in the Billy Paul band, and with Philadelphia International Records. Paul’s 1972 hit \\"Me and Mrs. Jones\\" was Jackson’s first No. 1 record. His performance on \\"For the Love of Money\\" by The O'Jays helped move the song to No. 9 on the pop chart and No. 3 on the R&B; chart in 1974. Jackson is a student of Jerry Fisher, Lawrence Lucie, and Pat Martino. He has performed live in more than 30 countries and has recorded in more than 3000 sessions on more than 500 albums.The liner notes from album \\"INTERSPIRIT\\" 2010, Abstract Logix, LBLX020 In 2016 Jackson had to miss some performances with Hiromi, due to ill health. ==Six-string contrabass guitar== Danelectro (1956), Fender (1961) and other manufacturers had produced six- string basses tuned one octave below a guitar (EADGBE), and Jackson had briefly played a Fender five-string bass tuned EADGC. Jackson first approached various luthiers in 1974 about the construction of his idea for a “contrabass guitar” tuned in fourths BEADGC, and Carl Thompson built the first six-string for Jackson in 1975. He first performed on the Thompson-built bass in 1975, recording with Carlos Garnett and touring with Roberta Flack. He later approached luthier Ken Smith to build him a six string bass before finally playing instruments made by New York-based bass makers, Fodera. Jackson said that the idea for adding more strings to the bass guitar came from his frustration with its limited range. When asked what he thought of criticism of the six-string bass, Jackson replied, > Why is four [strings] the standard and not six? As the lowest-pitched member > of the guitar family, the instrument should have had six strings from the > beginning. The only reason it had four was because Leo Fender was thinking > in application terms of an upright bass, but he built it along guitar lines > because that was his training. The logical conception for the bass guitar > encompasses six strings. From 1982 onwards Jackson exclusively played a contrabass. Prior to 1982 his main instruments included a 1973 Fender Precision Bass, a 1973 Fender Jazz bass fitted with a 1975 Precision neck, and a Gibson EB-2D bass. In 1984 Fodera introduced their first Anthony Jackson Signature Model contrabass, followed in 1989 with a single cutaway model, the “Anthony Jackson Presentation Contrabass Guitar”. ==Discography== ===As co-leader=== * Easy Pieces by Easy Pieces (Steve Ferrone, Renee Geyer, Anthony Jackson, Hamish Stuart) (A&M;, 1988) * Trio in Tokyo with Michel Petrucciani, Steve Gadd (Dreyfus, 1999) * Interspirit with Yiorgos Fakanas (Abstract Logix, 2010) ===As studio musician or guest=== With Patti Austin * Havana Candy (CTI, 1977) * Every Home Should Have One (Qwest, 1981) * In My Life (CTI, 1983) With Alex Bugnon * This Time Around (Epic, 1993) * Tales from the Bright Side (RCA, 1995) * As Promised (Narada, 2000) With Michel Camilo * Why Not?

Kathleen Blamey), MIT Press, Cambridge, 1997, p. 184. ===Baudrillard=== For Jean Baudrillard (Figures de l'alterité, 1994; Radical Alterity, 2008), alterity is a precious and transcendent element and its loss would seriously impoverish a world culture of increasing sameness and \\"arrogant, insular cultural narcissism.\\" ===Spivak=== Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's theory of alterity was introduced in a 2014 symposium titled Remaking History, the intention of which was to challenge the masculine orthodoxy of history writing. According to Spivak, it is imperative for one to uncover the histories and inherent historical behaviors in order to exercise an individual right to authentic experience, identity and reality. Within the concept of socially constructed histories one \\"must take into account the dangerous fragility and tenacity of these concept-metaphors.\\" Spivak recalls her personal history: \\"As a postcolonial, I am concerned with the appropriation of 'alternative history' or 'histories'. I am not a historian by training. I cannot claim disciplinary expertise in remaking history in the sense of rewriting it. But I can be used as an example of how historical narratives are negotiated. The parents of my parents' grandparents' grandparents were made over, not always without their consent, by the political, fiscal and educational intervention of British imperialism, and now I am independent. Thus I am, in the strictest sense, a postcolonial.\\" Spivak uses four \\"master words\\" to identify the modes of being that create alterity: \\"Nationalism, Internationalism, Secularism and Culturalism.\\" Furthermore, tools for developing alternative histories include: \\"gender, race, ethnicity, class\\". ===Other thinkers=== Jeffery Nealon, in Alterity Politics: Ethics and Performative Subjectivity, argues that \\"ethics is constituted as an inexorable affirmative response to different identities, not through an inability to understand or totalize the other.\\" There is included a long article on alterity in the University of Chicago's Theories of Media: Keywords Glossary by Joshua Wexler. Wexler writes: \\"Given the various theorists formulations presented here, the mediation of alterity or otherness in the world provides a space for thinking about the complexities of self and other and the formation of identity.\\" The concept of alterity is also being used in theology and in spiritual books meant for general readers. This is not out of place because, for believers in the Judeo-Christian tradition, God is the ultimate 'Other'. Alterity has also been used to describe the goal of many Christians, to become themselves deeply \\"other\\" than the usual norms of behavior and patterns of thought of the secular culture at large. Enzo Bianchi in Echoes of the Word expresses this well, \\"Meditation always seeks to open us to alterity, love and communion by guiding us toward the goal of having in ourselves the same attitude and will that were in Christ Jesus.\\" Jadranka Skorin-Kapov in The Aesthetics of Desire and Surprise: Phenomenology and Speculation, relates alterity or otherness to newness and surprise, \\"The signification of the encounter with otherness is not in its novelty (or banal newness); on the contrary, newness has signification because it reveals otherness, because it allows the experience of otherness. Newness is related to surprise, it is a consequence of the encounter... Metaphysical desire is the acceptivity of irreducible otherness. Surprise is the consequence of the encounter. Between desire and surprise there is a pause, a void, a rupture, an immediacy that cannot be captured and presented.\\" ==Anthropology== In anthropology, alterity has been used by scholars such as Nicholas Dirks, Johannes Fabian, Michael Taussig and Pauline Turner Strong to refer to the construction of \\"cultural others\\". ==Musicology== The term has gained further use in seemingly somewhat remote disciplines, e.g., historical musicology where it is employed by John Michael Cooper in a study of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Felix Mendelssohn.John Michael Cooper.

The band was formed in 1999 by guitarist, songwriter and vocalist Steve Schiltz; guitarist Shannon Ferguson; bassist David Marchese; and drummer Jeremy Greene. The band was active from 1999 to 2008. As of 2018 the band had reformed and was recording new music. Longwave’s fifth album ‘’If We Ever Live Forever’’ was released October 25, 2019. ==History== Before Longwave formed, Schiltz played guitar in a band called Scout, featuring vocalist Ashen Keilyn. A few months after Schiltz left his hometown of Rochester, New York, he returned to play regular gigs at the Blue Sunday coffee house with a group called the Deaf Aides, named for John Lennon's comments that open the Let It Be album. Later renamed Longwave, their revolving cast of members eventually included bassist Marchese and drummer Greene, followed by Ferguson, who had been working in a studio as a bassist for various bands on the West Coast. The band, based in New York City, found its initial audience by performing a series of shows at the Luna Lounge club on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Longwave's first release, the self-produced Endsongs, was released in 2000 on LunaSea Records, a record label created by Luna Lounge co-owner Rob Sacher. The album garnered notice in the burgeoning early 2000s New York City rock scene, and soon after the band began touring the U.S. Greene left the band, and Schiltz's friend (and fellow Rochester native) Mike James (formerly Mike Lapiana) joined as drummer. With their popularity on the rise, the band gained the interest of major record labels and were eventually signed by RCA Records. The subsequent second album, The Strangest Things (2002), was produced by Dave Fridmann (the Flaming Lips, Mercury Rev). They toured with some of the biggest bands of the period including the Strokes and the Vines. Three videos were produced for this album, including \\"Everywhere You Turn,\\" which was directed by writer-director Daedalus Howell and featured Longwave performing at the Echo in Los Angeles. After several successful years of touring the UK and US, and the release of a 2004 EP Life of the Party, Longwave returned to the studio to record their third album, There's a Fire. Produced by John Leckie, it was released in 2005. Marchese and James had both left the band, and Schiltz and Ferguson performed all of the bass guitar on the album. Nic Brown, who had previously filled in for James while touring, played drums on the album, while Jeff Sheinkopf played keyboards and guitar. By the time of the album's release, a new rhythm section had joined: bassist Paul Dillon and drummer Jason Molina. Dillon was later replaced by Morgan King. Parting ways with RCA, they released their fourth album, Secrets Are Sinister, on November 11, 2008 on the Original Signal Recordings label and mounted a national tour with Blue October. The band then went on an extended hiatus. Schiltz collaborated with Keilyn again on his project Hurricane Bells, releasing two albums: Tonight Is the Ghost (2010) and Tides and Tales (2011). In 2014, he collaborated with members of the band Blue October on the project Harvard of the South. After leaving Longwave, James returned to Rochester and formed the Mercies. He later started his own band, Mikey Jukebox, and fronted Admirers.http://www.admirersmusic.com On January 17, 2018, Longwave announced on the band's official Facebook page that they had resumed activity, saying, \\"We have been playing again. There is new music, and there will be shows\\".https://www.facebook.com/longwave/?hc_ref=ARStea7NnvJmQcWjiHaPeb7eHygjVR8yZolBhCqOAk_GAE63hr2vWLuTzB5S7ekXSSo&fref;=nf The current lineup features Schiltz, Ferguson and Molina, with new bassist Christian Bongers replacing King. On November 14, 2018, Longwave shared the music video for their first single in more than a decade, \\"Stay With Me\\", released on the Bodan Kuma label.http://www.bodankuma.com/blog/2018/8/16/longwave-return-with-first- single-in-10-years-stay-with-me-on-bodan-kuma-recordings Dave Doobinin of Follette Films directed the video.https://www.musicnewsnet.com/2018/11/music- news-today-nycs-indie-rockers-longwave-share-the-music-video-for-their-first- single-in-ten-years-stay-with-me-dave.html The next year, on July 26, 2019, they released a new single, \\"Dreamers Float Away\\", also on the Bodan Kuma label.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtmR_8lG3MA ==Band members== *Steve Schiltz — guitars, vocals *Shannon Ferguson — guitars *Jason Molina — drums *Christian Bongers — bass ===Previous members=== *David Marchese — bass *Jeremy Greene — drums *Mike James — drums *Nic Brown — drums *Jeff Sheinkopf — keyboards/guitars *Paul Dillon — bass guitar *Morgan King — bass ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * Endsongs (2000, LunaSea Records) * The Strangest Things (2003, RCA Records) * There's a Fire (2005, RCA Records) * Secrets Are Sinister (2008, Original Signal Recordings) * If We Ever Live Forever (2019, Bodan Kuma Recordings) ===Singles and EPs=== * \\"Exit\\" single (2002, Hummer) * \\"Pool Song\\" single (2002, Hummer) * Day Sleeper EP (2002, Fenway Recordings) * \\"Everywhere You Turn\\" single (2003, 14th Floor Records) * \\"Day Sleeper\\" single (2003, 14th Floor Records) * \\"Wake Me When It's Over\\" single (2003, 14th Floor Records) * Tidal Wave EP (2004, BMG Funhouse) * Life of the Party EP (2004, RCA Records) * There's a Fire EP (2005, BMG Direct) * \\"Stay With Me\\" (2018, Bodan Kuma) *Dreamers Float Away (2019, Bodan Kuma) ==References== ==External links== *Official site Category:Indie rock musical groups from New York (state) Category:Musical groups from New York City ","title":"Longwave (band)"},{"id":"2565559","text":"Arms of the Leiningen family Evolution of the Leiningen arms Leiningen is the name of an old German noble family whose lands lay principally in Alsace, Lorraine and the Palatinate. Various branches of this family developed over the centuries and ruled counties with Imperial immediacy. Most of these counties were annexed by the First French Republic in 1793, after French troops conquered the Left Bank of the Rhine during the War of the First Coalition. Several family branches subsequently received secularized abbeys as compensation, but shortly afterwards, these new counties were mediatized and the family lost its immediacy. Today, the only existing branch is that of the Princes of Leiningen. ==Origins== Count Frederick II (d. 1237) The first count of Leiningen about whom anything definite is known was a certain Emich II (d. before 1138). He (and perhaps his father Emich I) built Leiningen Castle, which is now known as \\"Old Leiningen Castle\\" (German: Burg Altleiningen), around 1100 to 1110. Nearby Höningen Abbey was then built around 1120 as the family's burial place. This family became extinct in the male line when Count Frederick I died about 1220. Frederick I's sister, Liutgarde, married Simon II, Count of Saarbrücken. One of Liutgarde's sons, also named Frederick, inherited the lands of the counts of Leiningen, and he took their arms and their name as Frederick II (d. 1237). He became known as a Minnesinger, and one of his songs was included in the Codex Manesse. Before 1212, he built himself a new castle called Hardenburg, about 10 kilometers south of Altleiningen. This was outside the county of Leiningen on the territory of Limburg Abbey, of which his uncle was the overlord (Vogt), which caused some trouble. His eldest son, Simon (c. 1204–1234), married Gertrude, heiress of the County of Dagsburg, bringing that property into the family. They had no children and Simon's two brothers inherited the county of Leiningen together: Frederick III (d. 1287) also inherited Dagsburg and Emich IV (d. c. 1276) Landeck Castle; he founded the town of Landau, but the Landeck branch extinguished with his grandson in 1290. Frederick III, who disliked sharing Leiningen castle with his brother, had a new castle built in 1238–41 about 5 kilometres northeast of Leiningen, called Neuleiningen Castle (\\"New Leiningen\\"). Frederick III's son, Frederick IV (d. 1316), had two sons, who divided the county into Leiningen-Dagsburg and Leiningen-Hardenburg. File:Burg Altleiningen 04.JPGAltleiningen Castle File:Bad Dürkheim Hardenburg.jpgHardenburg Castle File:Rocherdabo.JPGDagsburg Castle File:Burg Neuleiningen, Nordseite.JPGNeuleiningen Castle ==History== Having increased its possessions, the Leiningen family was divided around 1317 into two branches. ===Leiningen-Westerburg=== Westerburg Castle Ilbenstadt Abbey The elder of these, whose head was a landgrave, died out in 1467. Upon this event, its lands fell to a female, the last landgrave's sister Margaret, wife of Reinhard, Lord of Westerburg, and their descendants were known as the family of Leiningen-Westerburg. Later this family was divided into two branches, those of Leiningen-Westerburg-Alt-Leiningen and Leiningen-Westerburg-Neu- Leiningen, both of which are extinct today. After the French Revolution, the Left Bank of the Rhine was conquered during the War of the First Coalition and annexed by France in 1793. The two counts of Alt- and Neu- Leiningen were arrested and jailed in Paris. They lost their territories. In 1803 they were compensated with secularized Ilbenstadt Abbey (at Niddatal) and Engelthal Abbey. The German mediatization brought an end to these short-lived counties in 1806, when their territories were divided between the Grand Duchy of Berg, the Grand Duchy of Hesse, Nassau-Weilburg and Nassau-Usingen. Ilbenstadt Abbey was sold by the House of Leiningen-Westerburg-Altleiningen in 1921, Engelthal Abbey by the heirs of the House of Leiningen-Westerburg-Neuleiningen in 1952. ===Leiningen-Hardenburg=== Meanwhile, the younger branch of the Leiningens, known as the family of Leiningen-Hardenburg, was flourishing. On 27 June 1560, this branch was divided into the lines of Leiningen-Dagsburg-Hardenburg, founded by Count Johann Philip (d. 1562), and Leiningen-Dagsburg-Heidesheim or Falkenburg, founded by Count Emicho (d. 1593). In 1658 Leiningen-Dagsburg- Falkenburg divided into * Leiningen-Dagsburg (extinct 1706) * Leiningen- Heidesheim (extinct 1766) * Leiningen-Guntersblum (extinct 1774) map of the counties in 1774 map of the counties in 1789 The county of Leiningen-Dagsburg was inherited by Leiningen-Dagsburg-Hardenburg in 1774. Leiningen-Guntersblum was divided between two further side branches: * Leiningen-Dagsburg- Falkenburg-Guntersblum, which was deprived of its lands on the left bank of the Rhine by France, but in 1803 received Billigheim as a compensation, then called Leiningen-Billigheim. In 1845 they also acquired Neuburg Castle at Obrigheim. The branch became extinct in 1925. * Leiningen-Heidesheim, which in 1803 received Neudenau and became known as Leiningen-Neudenau (extinct in 1910). Amorbach Abbey In 1779, the head of the Leiningen-Dagsburg-Hardenburg line was raised to the rank of a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire with the title of Prince of Leiningen. In 1801, this line was deprived of its lands on the left bank of the Rhine by France, but in 1803 it received Amorbach Abbey as an ample compensation for these losses. A few years later, the Principality of Leiningen at Amorbach was mediatized, and its territory is now included mainly in Baden, but partly in Bavaria and in Hesse. Amorbach Abbey is still today the family seat of the Prince of Leiningen. The second prince of the Leiningen-Dagsburg-Hardenburg line, Prince Emich Charles, married Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. After his death in 1814, the princess married Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, a younger son of George III of the United Kingdom, by whom she became the mother of the reigning British Queen Victoria. Since 1991, the head of the princely line has been Prince Andreas (b. 1955).Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels (2004), Volume 133, p. 249, 251. His eldest brother, Prince Karl Emich was excluded from succession after he married morganatically. == Line of Descent == Note that different sources use different sequence numbers for some of the Counts. For consistency across sources, dates of birth and death are useful. === Earliest Counts === *Emicho of Leiningen helped lead the German Crusade, 1096.

The album received widespread critical acclaim. == Recording and production == The Woods was produced by Dave Fridmann and recorded from November 2004 to December 2004 at Tarbox Road Studios in Cassadaga, New York. Much of the album was recorded live in the studio, as Fridmann consciously attempted to approximate the band's live sound on the record. The vocals and some of the guitar tracks were the only overdubs. The final two tracks, \\"Let's Call It Love\\" and \\"Night Light\\", were separate tracks on record but were actually recorded together in a single 15-minute take, after Carrie Brownstein realized that the two tracks were in the same key and could segue into one another. == Release == The Woods was released on May 24, 2005, by Sub Pop, making it the band's first release on that label. Two songs from the album, \\"Entertain\\" and \\"Jumpers\\", were released as singles on May 10, 2005, and September 12, 2005, respectively. The album reached number 80 on the US Billboard Top 200 chart and number 2 on the Independent Albums chart. As of October 2005, The Woods had sold 59,000 copies in the U.S. according to Nielsen SoundScan. As of February 2015, The Woods had sold 94,000 copies. == Critical reception == The Woods received widespread critical acclaim. Kyle Ryan, writing for The A.V.

The festival, which is held to celebrate local agriculture, is headed up by the Circleville Pumpkin Show Corporation. Considered to be the biggest festival in the United States dedicated to the pumpkin, it is billed as The Greatest Free Show On Earth. Attendance has topped 400,000 for the four-day event, which is free to enter. ==Dates== The Pumpkin Show begins on the third Wednesday of October and lasts until the following Saturday. In recent years, a Tuesday preview night \\"for locals\\" has been introduced, adding an unofficial half day to the event. ==Locations== Starting on the Sunday before the festival, work begins to restrict traffic in downtown Circleville. The restricted areas dedicated to the show are from South Scioto Street on the west to Pickaway Street on the east, and Watt/Pinckney Street on the north to Franklin Street on the south. More than 12 blocks are restricted by this event, which causes massive detours throughout a major portion of the city, including State Route 56 and U.S. Route 22. Because there is no organized parking system, many small businesses, individuals, and non-profit organizations provide parking for varying fees. ==History== In October 1903, Mayor George R. Haswell decided to hold a small pumpkin-and-corn exhibit in front of his store to celebrate the local harvest. This small exhibit featured corn, carved pumpkins and other harvest-themed displays. Because of the prominence of pumpkins in this first exhibit, the name \\"The Pumpkin Show\\" was then coined. In the following years local merchants were attracted to improve the size, scope and attendance of the festival. By 1905, the first ride was installed. Soon after, with the success of the shows, an annual festival was organized to be held on the city streets to attract merchants, patrons and improve the quality of the festival. The Pumpkin Show has been held annually since 1903. Despite it still being held during the influenza outbreaks of 1918-1919, the Pumpkin Show was silenced for one year during World War I, two years during World War II, and in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Pumpkin Show became the sixth largest festival in the United States by 2007, attracting more than 300,000 people to the city every year. == Traditions== Every Pumpkin Show officially kicks off with the weigh-in of large pumpkins from around the area. The largest pumpkin to date was grown by Bob & Jo Liggett, with their entry from 2014 weighing in at . Recent weigh-ins have had multiple entries that go over . Every year, Lindsey's Bakery creates the \\"world's largest\\" pumpkin pie. Visitors can be in line for over an hour to see the pie. At the 100th anniversary Pumpkin Show in 2006, the bakery had to make a much bigger pie compared to previous years to officially reclaim the title of world's largest. The pie pan was so large that it was moved outside of the bakery window and into a tent out on the street. Another long-standing tradition of the Circleville Pumpkin Show is a pageant to crown the Little Miss and Miss Pumpkin Show Queen. The Little Miss Pumpkin Show Queen must be in the 1st grade at a school in Pickaway County, while the Miss Pumpkin Show Queen must be a junior or senior from one of the six local high schools. Once crowned, they lead off each parade for the rest of the event. Seven parades in total are held during the event (two on Wednesday- Friday, one night parade on Saturday). These parades have many different themes, including the Pet Parade and Baby Parade. These parades also feature performances by many local high school and middle school bands, as well as other organizations. The Ohio University Marching 110, which is often referred to as \\"The Most Exciting Band In The Land,\\" has made numerous trips to highlight Thursday night's parade of bands. The 2006 Pumpkin Show welcomed The Ohio State University Marching Band. They came back in 2010 to march in the parade of bands again and hold a concert afterwards. == Facts == The Pumpkin Show features several different pumpkin related foods, including pumpkin donuts, pancakes, burgers, ice cream, cookies, fudge, brownies, cream puffs, waffles, pumpkin seeds, and pumpkin pie. Over the course of the event, approximately 23,000 pumpkin pies and more than 100,000 pumpkin donuts are sold from local vendors. There are also many other festival foods available at various stands throughout the event. Due to its popularity, the Pumpkin Show also has a song, \\"The Punkin Show,\\" written and composed by M. W. \\"Burk\\" Burkhart in 1952 (published in 1977). People from over 34 states and 13 different countries have been documented to have attended the festival in the most recent years. ==References== ==Further reading== * Houts, Kelli. \\"Pumpkin show hits century mark,\\" The Lantern (Thursday, October 19, 2006): Arts 9. ==External links== * Circleville Pumpkin Show website * America's Pumpkin Festivals * Photos of the 1976 Circleville Pumpkin Show Category:Circleville, Ohio Category:Festivals in Ohio Category:Food and drink festivals in the United States Category:Tourist attractions in Pickaway County, Ohio Category:Pumpkin festivals ","title":"Circleville Pumpkin Show"},{"id":"2565583","text":"New growth Celtis jessoensis, known as the Japanese hackberry or Jesso hackberry (from an archaic reading of \\"Ezo\\": Hokkaidō) is a species of hackberry native to Japan and Korea.

Two concrete observation bunkers from that time remain visible at the site. It was also part of Camp Wikoff where troops led by Theodore Roosevelt were quarantined after the Spanish–American War. Attempts to purchase the land to preserve it as a public park had been ongoing for years prior to the park's creation in 2000. After the previous owners won approval to subdivide their property into several residential lots, preservation efforts intensified. The parkland was purchased in October 2000 for $17.7 million, with the cost split between New York State ($5.6 million), the Town of East Hampton ($5.5 million), Suffolk County ($5.4 million), and The Nature Conservancy ($1 million). ==Park description== The park, maintained by the Long Island Region of the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, features more than of beach and bluffs along the Atlantic Ocean. The park is largely undeveloped, and has no infrastructure beyond elevated platforms for birdwatching and trails for hiking, biking, and cross-country skiing. The park also offers accessibility for salt water fishing. Shadmoor State Park derives its name from the thick shadbush (Amelanchier) found growing atop the bluffs.

In appearance, the shashka is midway between a typically curved sabre and a straight sword. It has a slightly curved blade, and can be effective for both cutting and thrusting. ==History== The shashka originated among the mountain tribes of the Caucasus, the earliest depictions of this sword date to the late 17th century, though most extant shashkas have hilts dating to the 19th century.Rivkin, p. 21 The earliest datable example is from 1713. Later, most of the Russian and Ukrainian Cossacks adopted the weapon. Two styles of shashka exist: the Caucasian/Circassian shashka and the Cossack shashka. In 1834 the Russian government produced the first military-issue shashka pattern.Urazbakhtin, pp. 126, 131-134 The blades of non-regulation shashkas were of diverse origins, some were locally made in the Caucasus, others in Russia, some were manufactured in Germany, mostly in Solingen, and displayed imitations of the 'running wolf' mark of Passau.Tarassuk and Blair, p. 420 The typically Circassian (Adyghe) form of sabre was longer than the Cossack type, in fact the Russian word shashka originally came from the Adyghe word – (Sashko) – meaning \\"long knife\\". It gradually replaced the sabre in all cavalry units except hussars during the 19th century.Urazbakhtin, p. 126 Russian troops, having encountered it during their conquest of the Caucasus (1817–1864), preferred it to their issued sabres. At this time there were three types of non-regulation shashka: *The Caucasus type, where the handle almost sits inside the scabbard, this type was used by Kuban Cossack and tribes from the Caucasus. The only problem was with this type of shashka was that in the rain, water could go down into the scabbard. This type of shashka was very light (300–400 grams), very flexible and strong. The best and most famous shashkas of this types were Gurda, Volchek (running wolf symbol on the blade). *The Don Cossack shashka, which has a straighter blade. The weight of this shashka is around 1 kilogram. *The Terek Cossack shashka, the handle, like the Don Cossack shashka, does not go inside the scabbard. It is very light and strong. The first officially regulated Russian military shashka was the 1834 pattern, also called the “Nizhegorodka”. This was followed by the 1838 pattern shashka. In 1881, two patterns were introduced: a 'Cossack' pattern, which was typical in not having a guard, and a 'dragoon' pattern, which was much more like a standard sabre in having a brass knucklebow, and was derived from the 1841 dragoon sabre. The blades of the two types were, however, essentially identical.Urazbakhtin, p. 135-137 The Cossack Hosts (not full-time regiments) used non-regulation shashkas until 1904, when they received their own regulation pattern.Urazbakhtin, p. 141 The Communist government introduced the 1927 pattern, which was very similar to the 1881 Cossack pattern; production of this pattern continued until 1946. The last pattern shashkas to be introduced were the 1940 patterns for 'line commanding personnel' and generals - both had knucklebows.Urazbakhtin, pp. 144-145 ==Construction== Reproduction of an 1881 pattern 'Cossack' shashka Hilt of an 1881 pattern 'Dragoon' shashka (and revolver) The shashka was a relatively short sabre, typically being 80 to 100cm (31.5 to 39in.) in total length. It had a slightly curved, fullered, blade with a single edge, the back of the blade was often sharpened for the 3rd. of the blade nearest the tip (a false edge). The hilt had no guard (except for Russian Dragoon 'shashka' patterns, which had a brass knucklebow and quillon, and a conventional sabre pommel). The pommel was hook-shaped and divided into two 'ears'. This is a feature found in many weapons of the Western Asian highlands, from the Turkish yataghan to the Afghan pesh-kabz. The sword was worn in a scabbard suspended with the edge uppermost. The Caucasian form of the shashka had a scabbard which enclosed most of the hilt, with little more than the hooked pommel protruding.Urazbakhtin, p. 126 Plainer, non-regulation shashkas often had hilts of horn, more highly decorated examples had hilts sheathed in niello- inlaid silver, with scabbard mounts to match. Russian military shashkas were much plainer, with hilts typically consisting of a brass ferrule, ribbed wooden grip and brass pommel. Unlike traditional non-regulation shashkas, the pommel of pattern shashkas was pierced to receive a sword-knot. The pommel was decorated with an imperial insignia; following the 1917 revolution this was often ground off. Shashkas manufactured under the Soviet regime (Pattern 1927) had Communist symbols in place of the imperial ones. Later trooper models often had modified brass scabbard furniture to hold a bayonet for the Mosin–Nagant carbine. Officer's models, though of similar construction, did not have an attached bayonet, and were much more heavily decorated. In Tsarist times officers had considerable freedom in the decoration of their shaskas and some had non-regulation blades.Urazbakhtin, p. 126-135, 144 The 1834 pattern shashka was a popular weapon, when it was replaced by the 1881 pattern, several regiments complained so vociferously that their 1834s were returned to them.Urazbakhtin, p. 134 The 1838 Pattern - typical statistics for a pattern sword: Total length: 1030mm Blade length: 875mm Blade width: 36mm Blade curvature: 62/375mm Point of balance: 170-180mm Weight: 1067gUrazbakhtin, p. 136 ==Use== There is little or no surviving contemporary written information on how the people of the Caucasus used the shashka. However, surviving Russian military manuals indicate that, despite the lack of protection for the hand, the military shashka was used in much the same manner as a Western European sabre, with very similar cuts, thrusts, guards and parries. In particular, Russian soldiers were not taught to cut in one movement from unsheathing, whatever Caucasus traditions suggest.Urazbakhtin, pp. 146-168, summary 169 ==References== ==Bibliography== *Kirill A.

It was also the name of a 1949 novel and 1950 feature film about a struggle between two tobacco barons. The struggle depicted in the feature film, according to McElwee family tradition, parallels one between McElwee's great-grandfather and the patriarch of the Duke family, for whom Duke University is named. ==Cast== Interviewed as part of this film include Allan Gurganus, Ross McElwee, Tom McElwee, Vlada Petric, Paula Larke, Marilyn Levine, Emily Madison, Adrian McElwee, Charleen Swansea, and Patricia Neal, the leading lady of the 1950 feature film. ==Reception== The documentary follows McElwee's usual style, where he gives voiceovers to apparently spontaneous footage, making the story more personal. According to Roger Ebert: Marian Keane, in her essay \\"Reflections on Bright Leaves\\", collected in \\"Three Documentary Filmmakers\\", asserts that Bright Leaves displays McElwee's extraordinary ability to present \\"people in their uniqueness\\", contrasting this with other documentaries where people often \\"seem to exist in the world of film as if suspended from their relation to their actual lives.\\" ==Awards and nominations== * 2004, Gotham Awards nomination for 'Best Documentary' * 2005, won National Society of Film Critics Awards award for 'Best Non-Fiction Film' * 2005, Directors Guild of America Award nomination for 'Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Documentary' * 2005, Independent Spirit Awards nomination for 'Best Documentary' * 2005, Writers Guild of America Award for Best Documentary Screenplay nomination ==References* Bright Leaves at PBS * Ross McElwee's web page Category:2003 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:POV (TV series) films Category:Films directed by Ross McElwee Category:Tobacco Category:Films shot in North Carolina Category:2003 documentary films Category:Documentary films about families Category:Documentary films about North Carolina ","title":"Bright Leaves"},{"id":"2565657","text":"A Pellin–Broca prism A Pellin–Broca prism is a type of constant-deviation dispersive prism similar to an Abbe prism. The prism is named for its inventors, the French instrument maker Ph. Pellin and professor of physiological optics André Broca. The prism consists of a four-sided block of glass shaped as a right prism with 90°, 75°, 135°, and 60° angles on the end faces. Light enters the prism through face AB, undergoes total internal reflection from face BC, and exits through face AD. The refraction of the light as it enters and exits the prism is such that one particular wavelength of the light is deviated by exactly 90°. As the prism is rotated around an axis O, the line of intersection of bisector of ∠BAD and the reflecting face BC, the selected wavelength which is deviated by 90° is changed without changing the geometry or relative positions of the input and output beams. The prism is commonly used to separate a single required wavelength from a light beam containing multiple wavelengths, such as a particular output line from a multi-line laser due to its ability to separate beams even after they have undergone a non-linear frequency conversion. For this reason, they are also commonly used in optical atomic spectroscopy.Svanberg, S.

He was sometimes called \\"The Father of High Voltage Direct Current\\" power transmission.William R. Gould, \\"August Uno Lamm\\", in Memorial Tributes, Volume 5, 1992, National Academy of Engineering. retrieved from http://books.nae.edu//books/0309046890/html/145.htm\\" August 24, 2005 During his career Lamm obtained 150 patents and wrote about 80 technical papers. In 1980 the IEEE developed the Uno Lamm award for contributions to the field of high voltage electrical engineering. ==Biography== Lamm was born in Gothenburg on May 22, 1904 to Fredrik Hjalmar Lamm and Aino Maria Lovisa Wilhelmina Wijkander. He obtained his master's degree at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm in 1927. After a short time in compulsory military service he joined ASEA, the Swedish electrical conglomerate, initially working in their training program. In 1929 he was made manager of the project to develop a high-voltage mercury arc valve. Valves at the time operated only up to about 2500 volts, and if higher-voltage valves were available they could have practical use in the transmission of large quantities of electric energy over long distances. In 1943 Lamm obtained his Ph.D. from the Royal Institute of Technology, studying part-time while developing the mercury arc valve. After twenty years or so of development work to produce a valve with the necessary rating for HVDC transmission, ASEA obtained a contract for the HVDC Gotland project in 1950, which when completed in 1955 became the first modern fully commercial HVDC system. In 1955 Lamm was made head of the ASEA project to develop Sweden's first commercial nuclear reactors. Lamm was appointed by ASEA in 1961 to work with General Electric on the Pacific DC Intertie project, which combined AC and HVDC transmission systems to move electrical energy from the hydroelectric generators of the Pacific Northwest to consumers in southern California. By the end of 1964 Lamm had moved to southern California. From 1967 to 1988 he served as an IEEE director at large. He died on June 1, 1989, aged 85, in Burlingame, California. ==Legacy== During his career Lamm obtained 150 patents and wrote about 80 technical papers. He also wrote extensively on social issues in articles published in Swedish newspapers and magazines, often critical of the Swedish government. Lamm was described as a staunch anti- Communist who admired some of the positive features of the United States economy. During the Second World War, while required to travel to Nazi Germany to carry out ASEA business, Lamm was criticized by his supervisors for his anti-Nazi attitude, such as refusing to give the Nazi Party salute at patent hearings.Katherine Wollard \\"Uno Lamm: inventor and activist\\", IEEE Spectrum, March 1988 Lamm learned to play the violin in his youth and retained an interest in the performing arts. He was married twice and had four children. Lamm's Ph.D. thesis was titled, in English, \\"The Transductor, DC Pre-Saturated Reactor\\". While describing this device at a lecture in the United States he also mentioned that the same principle could be applied to resistors, making a transistor. This was the name later applied to the solid-state amplifier. ==Awards== During his life Lamm received many awards including the Lamme medal in 1965. In 1980 the IEEE developed the Uno Lamm award for contributions to the field of high voltage electrical engineering. In 1981, he was awarded the Howard N. Potts Medal. ==References== Category:1904 births Category:1989 deaths Category:Swedish electrical engineers Category:Swedish inventors Category:KTH Royal Institute of Technology alumni Category:Howard N.

The strip, published in alternative newsweeklies such as Eye Weekly, offers political and social satire with a regular cast of characters, similar to Doonesbury by Garry Trudeau, but with more emphasis on caricature. Characters in the strip included computer geek Horst Weltschmerz, his girlfriend Celia Jones, his friends Frank, Cindy, Cosmo and Max, and Max's partner Des. Political figures such as George W. Bush, Stephen Harper and Dalton McGuinty also appear as characters. Storylines included Horst and Celia's attempt to have a child (so far unsuccessfully); Raj being held in prison on a security certificate, then extradited to Pakistan on suspicion of being a terrorist, then kidnapped by terrorists; and Frank running for Liberal leader on a porn-based platform. The Weltschmerz web site was expanded to a blog-based format, allowing an archive that can be sorted by theme and character.

A cannula, or hollow needle, is carefully introduced into the thorax, generally after administration of local anesthesia. The procedure was first performed by Morrill Wyman in 1850 and then described by Henry Ingersoll Bowditch in 1852. The recommended location varies depending upon the source. Some sources recommend the midaxillary line, in the eighth, ninth, or tenth intercostal space. Whenever possible, the procedure should be performed under ultrasound guidance, which has shown to reduce complications. Tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency that requires emergent needle decompression before a chest tube is placed. ==Indications== The illustration shows a person having thoracentesis. The person sits upright and leans on a table. Excess fluid from the pleural space is drained into a bag. Instruments for thoracocentesis and needle biopsy of the pleura. This procedure is indicated when unexplained fluid accumulates in the chest cavity outside the lung. In more than 90% of cases analysis of pleural fluid yields clinically useful information. If a large amount of fluid is present, then this procedure can also be used therapeutically to remove that fluid and improve patient comfort and lung function. The most common causes of pleural effusions are cancer, congestive heart failure, pneumonia, and recent surgery. In countries where tuberculosis is common, this is also a common cause of pleural effusions. When cardiopulmonary status is compromised (i.e. when the fluid or air has its repercussions on the function of heart and lungs), due to air (significant pneumothorax), fluid (pleural fluid) or blood (hemothorax) outside the lung, then this procedure is usually replaced with tube thoracostomy, the placement of a large tube in the pleural space. ==Contraindications== An uncooperative patient or a coagulation disorder that cannot be corrected are relative contraindications. Routine measurement of coagulation profiles is generally not indicated, however; when performed by an experienced operator \\"hemorrhagic complications are infrequent after ultrasound-guided thoracentesis, and attempting to correct an abnormal INR or platelet level before the procedure is unlikely to confer any benefit.\\" Relative contraindications include cases in which the site of insertion has known bullous disease (e.g. emphysema), use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP, see mechanical ventilation) and only one functioning lung (due to diminished reserve). Traditional expert opinion suggests that the aspiration should not exceed 1L to avoid the possible development of pulmonary edema, but this recommendation is uncertain as the volume removed does not correlate well with this complication. ==Complications== Major complications are pneumothorax (3–30%), hemopneumothorax, hemorrhage, hypotension (low blood pressure due to a vasovagal response) and reexpansion pulmonary edema. Minor complications include a dry tap (no fluid return), subcutaneous hematoma or seroma, anxiety, dyspnea and cough (after removing large volume of fluid). The use of ultrasound for needle guidance can minimize the complication rate. === Follow-up Imaging === While chest X-ray has traditionally been performed to assess for pneumothorax following the procedure, it may no longer be necessary to do so in asymptomatic, non-ventilated persons given the widespread use of ultrasound to guide this procedure. ==Interpretation of pleural fluid analysis== Several diagnostic tools are available to determine the etiology of pleural fluid. ===Transudate versus exudate=== First the fluid is either transudate or exudate. A transudate is defined as pleural fluid to serum total protein ratio of less than 0.5, pleural fluid to serum LDH ratio > 0.6, and absolute pleural fluid LDH > 200 IU or > 2/3 of the normal. An exudate is defined as pleural fluid that filters from the circulatory system into lesions or areas of inflammation. Its composition varies but generally includes water and the dissolved solutes of the main circulatory fluid such as blood. In the case of blood it will contain some or all plasma proteins, white blood cells, platelets and (in the case of local vascular damage) red blood cells. Exudate * hemorrhage *Infection *Inflammation *Malignancy *Iatrogenic *Connective tissue disease *Endocrine disorders *Lymphatic disorders vs Constrictive pericarditis Transudate *Congestive heart failure *Nephrotic syndrome *Hypoalbuminemia *Cirrhosis *Atelectasis * trapped lung *Peritoneal dialysis *Superior vena cava obstruction ===Amylase=== A high amylase level (twice the serum level or the absolute value is greater than 160 Somogy units) in the pleural fluid is indicative of either acute or chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst that has dissected or ruptured into the pleural space, cancer or esophageal rupture. ===Glucose=== This is considered low if pleural fluid value is less than 50% of normal serum value. The differential diagnosis for this is: *rheumatoid effusion. The levels are characteristically low (<15 mg/dL). *lupus effusion *bacterial empyema *malignancy *tuberculosis *esophageal rupture (Boerhaave syndrome) ===pH=== Normal pleural fluid pH is approximately 7.60. A pleural fluid pH below 7.30 with normal arterial blood pH has the same differential diagnosis as low pleural fluid glucose. ===Triglyceride and cholesterol=== Chylothorax (fluid from lymph vessels leaking into the pleural cavity) may be identified by determining triglyceride and cholesterol levels, which are relatively high in lymph. A triglyceride level over 110 mg/dl and the presence of chylomicrons indicate a chylous effusion. The appearance is generally milky but can be serous. The main cause for chylothorax is rupture of the thoracic duct, most frequently as a result of trauma or malignancy (such as lymphoma). ===Cell count and differential=== The number of white blood cells can give an indication of infection. The specific subtypes can also give clues as to the type on infection. The amount of red blood cells are an obvious sign of bleeding. ===Cultures and stains=== If the effusion is caused by infection, microbiological culture may yield the infectious organism responsible for the infection, sometimes before other cultures (e.g. blood cultures and sputum cultures) become positive. A Gram stain may give a rough indication of the causative organism. A Ziehl-Neelsen stain may identify tuberculosis or other mycobacterial diseases. ===Cytology=== Cytology is an important tool in identifying effusions due to malignancy. The most common causes for pleural fluid are lung cancer, metastasis from elsewhere and pleural mesothelioma. The latter often presents with an effusion. Normal cytology results do not reliably rule out malignancy, but make the diagnosis more unlikely. ==References== ==External links== * *A photo gallery of thoracentesis showing the procedure step-by-step.

They are one of the various subgroups of the great Mebêngôkre nation (people from the water’s source). The term \\"Kayapo\\" is used by neighbouring groups rather than the Kayapo themselves. They refer to outsiders as \\"Poanjos\\". The type of sweet potato that forms an important part of the Kayapó diet is sometimes named \\"caiapo\\", after the tribe. It is cultivated under that name in Japan, and has been found to have health benefits. ==Location== The Kayapo tribe lives alongside the Xingu River in the most east part of the Amazon Rainforest, in the Amazon basin, in several scattered villages ranging in population from one hundred to one thousand people in Brazil. Their land consists of tropical rainforest savannah (grassland) and is arguably the largest tropical protected area in the entire world, covering 11,346,326 hectares of Neotropical forests and scrubland containing many endangered species. They have small hills scattered around their land and the area is criss-crossed by river valleys. The larger rivers feed into numerous pools and creeks, most of which don’t have official names. In 2010, there was an estimated 8,638 Kayapo people, which is an increase from 7,096 in 2003. Subgroups of the Kayapo include the Xikrin, Gorotire, Mekranoti and Metyktire. Their villages typically consist of a dozen huts. A centrally located hut serves as a meeting place for village men to discuss community issues. ==Name== The term Kayapo, also spelled Caiapó or Kaiapó, came from neighboring peoples in the early 19th century and means \\"those who look like monkeys\\". This name is probably based on a Kayapó men's ritual involving monkey masks. The autonym for one village is Mebêngôkre, which means \\"the men from the water hole.\\" Other names for them include Gorotire, Kararaô, Kuben-Kran-Krên, Kôkraimôrô, Mekrãgnoti, Metyktire, and Xikrin. == Appearance == Kayapo men The Kayapo use intricate black body paint covering their entire bodies. They believe that their ancestors learned their social skills from insects, so they paint their bodies to mimic them and to better communicate with the Spirit that exists everywhere. The black body paint also allows them to blend into their surroundings when hunting in the forests. To help find their way through the forest, the Kayapo paint their legs with red pigment that rubs off on the surrounding terrain. The colors that a Kayapo wears is representative of their tribe's colors. Older generations of Kayapo men wear disks in their lower lips, but the practice is less common among younger Kayapo men. The men adorn themselves with radiating feathers, representing the universe, in their hair. Kayapo men also can be seen with rope in their hair, to represent the rope which the first Kayapo used to arrive from the sky. Traditionally, Kayapo men cover their lower bodies with sheaths. Due to increased contact with outside cultures, contemporary Kayapo often wear Western-style clothing such as shorts. Kayapo chiefs wear a headdress made out of bright yellow feathers to represent the rays of the sun. The feathers used in their headdresses are from birds native to their area such as hyacinth macaw and crested oropendola. The birds found in the Amazon are naturally bright-colored; the Kayapo do not dye the feathers. Kayapo children wear cloth or beaded bands with colors representing their tribes. Typically these bands are tied below the waist or crisscrossed around the torso. When the child become of age, they go through a naming ceremony in which they wear large yellow headdresses. Kayapo women can be distinguished by the V shape shaved into their hair. ==Language== They speak the Kayapo language, which belongs to the Jê language family. The Kayapo are split into many groups, resulting in different dialects of their language. The Kayapo value oratory highly, calling themselves those who speak beautifully (Kaben mei) when compared to other indigenous groups. Beauty is valued highly in the Kayapo culture. A beautiful name is seen as a sign of wealth. The tribe will move and re-construct their camp in order to find the materials required to undertake the naming ceremony eg. Sufficient food sources for celebration must be gathered and presented to the father of the new-born. During certain occasions, Kayapo men may speak as if someone is punching them in the stomach. The Kayapo possess varying knowledge of Portuguese, depending on the individual groups and their history of contact with outsiders.– ==Land control and environmental issues== Kayapó headdress, or ákkápa-ri, ca. 1910, National Museum of the American Indian The Kayapo have incorporated a great deal of traditional myth, ritual and cosmology, p. 157. into their practices honouring the importance of the earth's relationship with the people. Threats to the forest home of the Kayapo have been an area of extreme concern in the last 30 years, beginning with mining and logging enterprises which threatened to destroy the rainforest, and thus the Kayapos' way of life. In the village of Gorotire, the Kayapo made a deal with prospectors that mining could take place as long as they received a percentage of the mining proceeds and had their territory demarcated. The gold mining operation was initially seen as a positive development, which brought money into the local economy. With money filtering into the economy, better housing, improved education and a resulting level of health were achieved. However, the initial benefits of mining also resulted in high levels of pollution in the area which seeped into water ways and nearby river banks and decimated local fish populations with high quantities of mercury. In addition to striking environmental threats, social habits began to change with the introduction of outside influences in the area. Men began to spend more time in town drinking, and engaging in \\"conspicuous consumption and womanising.\\" This increased interaction with outside groups elevated the levels of disease, which posed an imminent threat to the people because of their relative seclusion and limited access to medical care. In addition, the diminishing resource base caused conflicts between the Kayapo and neighbouring villages which often resulted in explosive and long standing disputes. The Kayapo people used forceful tactics to banish loggers and miners in some areas, as well as to establish themselves as an economic force. Developers ranging from gold miners to soy farmers and cattle ranchers were often killed. In 1987, new land issues arose when the government proposed a series of hydroelectric dams to be built in the Xingu River area, namely the Belo Monte Dam. These dams were an imminent threat to the Kayapo with the potential to displace upwards of 20,000 people from their lands. Under the leadership of Paulinho Paiakan, the Altamira Gathering was orchestrated by the Kayapo, drawing media attention worldwide. This demonstration, staged at the planned site for the first dam in Altamira, Pará, lasted several days and brought much pressure upon both the World Bank and the Brazilian government. The Altamira gathering brought the Kayapo, as well as other Brazilian Indians and their supporters into a forum where discussion could be had about how to protect the environment and the native peoples. The Kayapo demanded information that was being withheld by the government relating to the negative consequences for their people who would be directly affected by the construction of the dam, as well as rural Brazilians in the Xingu River area, who they felt were not receiving adequate and fair information. The Kayapo continued to fight adversity and retaliated using traditional war oratory and dances, proving that they were not only capable of \\"effectively reintegrating their society, (but) also of adapting their organization and culture to manipulate the mass media that covered the demonstration\\". The Kayapo attended the meeting to protest the hydroelectric dam development whilst in traditional costume and wielding machetes. Perhaps \\"the most dramatic single image to emerge from this tumultuous gathering was that of Tuíra, a female indigenous leader, angrily waving a machete in the face of engineer José Antônio Muniz Lópes (later president of Eletronorte, the state power company in charge of the dam), which had worldwide repercussions and probably influenced further postponement of the project\\". An important media element of the presentations was the appearance of the rock star Sting during the demonstration. Sting would continue to support the Kayapo in their efforts to protect their land, and in 1989 he would found the Rainforest Foundation Fund. Three years later, the first privately funded demarcation of the Brazilian indigenous reserve was made possible by the RFF. In 2008, they were again threatened by secretive government plans to build a series of hydroelectric dams on their land. The Belo Monte Dam resurfaced, and would be built on the Xingu River, the homeland to many Kayapo people. The Construction plans continue to be fought by the Kayapo people. Government corruption continues to weaken the resistance efforts of the indigenous and opposition forces within the government. Kayapo leaders protesting the creation of the dam are constantly threatened, and some have been killed by developers and land prospectors. Because of the nature of the circumstances, these crimes are rarely punished. The forest is the home of the Kayapo and they rely on its bounty for their food and medicinal needs. Rivers are essential to their way of life and gold mining in Brazil is polluting the rivers, while the proposed Belo Monte Dam project would use up vast amounts of resources essential to the survival and livelihood of the Kayapo and would severely impact fishing conditions. Between 18,000-25,000 (indirectly associated) jobs will be created by the construction of the dam. These numbers will have a vast and far reaching implication on population growth in the area which has the very real potential to put even more pressure on the fragile forest infrastructure and ever decreasing natural resource base, escalating concerns of flooding and deforestation in particular. ==Botany and agriculture== The resource patterns of the Kayapo are non-destructive to the resource base but require a very large area of land. The Kayapo people use shifting cultivation, a type of farming where land is cultivated for a few years, after which the people move to a new area. New farmland is cleared and the old farm is allowed to lie fallow and replenish itself. The particular type of shifting agriculture employed most frequently by the Kayapo is the slash and burn technique. This process allows forested areas to be cut down and burned in order for cultivation of the lands to take place. These “new fields” “peak in production of principal domesticated crops in two or three years but continue to reproduce for many years; e.g., sweet potatoes for four to five years, yams and taro for five to six years, manioc for four to six years, and papaya for five or more years”. Old fields are important for their concentration of medicinal plants. With the spread of indigenous groups, trail-side plantings and “forest fields” were also used for cultivating crops. Trails systems were extensive in the area and were used for transporting and growing crops along their margins. The field system was done by utilizing either naturally occurring or man made clearings in the forest for crop cultivation which required little maintenance afterward. The Kayapo also cultivated “war gardens” which were hidden plots used as a resource in times of food scarcity. The Kayapo use approximately 250 different food plants and 650 different medicinal plants that they find around their village. They also have trade agreements with The Body Shop. ==See also== * Raoni Metuktire, Kayapo chief and environmentalist * Terra preta, dark, fertile artificial soil found in the Amazon Basin ==References== ==External link== Category:Xingu peoples Category:Uncontacted peoples Category:Indigenous peoples in Brazil Category:Indigenous peoples of the Amazon ","title":"Kayapo"},{"id":"2565766","text":"Barry Robert O'Farrell (born 24 May 1959) is a former Australian politician who is Australia's High Commissioner to India since May 2020. O'Farrell was the 43rd Premier of New South Wales and Minister for Western Sydney from 2011 to 2014. He was the Leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party from 2007 to 2014, and was a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1995 to 2015, representing Northcott until 1999 and representing Ku-ring-gai on the Upper North Shore of Sydney from 1999 to 2015. He is currently President and Independent Board Chair of Diabetes Australia, Chair of the Wests Tigers Rugby League Football Club and CEO of Racing Australia Ltd. Born in Melbourne, his father's Army career saw O'Farrell and his family move around Australia, ending up in Darwin in the Northern Territory. In 1977 O'Farrell moved to Canberra to study at the Australian National University, where he gained a Bachelor of Arts. O'Farrell started his career as a graduate trainee in the Australian Public Service in Canberra. O'Farrell served as the State Director of the party in New South Wales from 1992 to 1995. At the 1995 New South Wales election, O'Farrell was elected to the safe Liberal seat of Northcott in northern Sydney. Following the seat's abolition in the 1998 redistribution he secured selection for the equally safe seat of Ku-ring-gai in 1999 and held it until 2015. O'Farrell joined the Shadow Ministry in 1998 and served two periods as Deputy Leader (1999–2002 and 2003–2007). Following the Liberal- Nationals' defeat at the 2007 state election (their fourth in a row), O'Farrell challenged Peter Debnam for the Liberal leadership. Debnam withdrew from the contest on the day of the ballot and O'Farrell was elected unopposed as the Leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party and consequently as Leader of the Opposition. He became Premier in a landslide at the 2011 election, winning the largest majority government in New South Wales history. On 16 April 2014, O'Farrell announced his intention to resign as party leader and NSW Premier as well as Minister for Western Sydney after misleading a New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) investigation. ICAC subsequently found \\"that there was no intention on Mr O'Farrell's part to mislead\\". He formally resigned on 17 April as Liberal Party leader and on 24 November 2014, O'Farrell announced his intention not to stand for re-election at the 2015 NSW election. ==Early life and background== The youngest of three children, Barry Robert O'Farrell was born to Kevin and Mae O'Farrell in the Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne, on 24 May 1959. He is descended from Irish immigrants who arrived in Victoria in the 1860s; and his paternal grandfather was an officer in the Victoria Police Force in Ballarat. In 1977 O'Farrell began studying at the Australian National University in Canberra, residing at Ursula College. After serving as a graduate trainee in the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, in 1980 O'Farrell joined the Liberal Party and worked in the offices of two South Australian Senators, Tony Messner and Gordon Davidson. When John Howard became Leader of the Opposition in 1985, his chief of staff, Gerard Henderson, hired O'Farrell as a Sydney-based adviser. In May 1988, O'Farrell was employed as Chief of Staff for Bruce Baird, a cabinet minister in the New South Wales government. Four years later, O'Farrell was appointed as the State Director of the New South Wales Liberal Party. O'Farrell succeeded and he held this position until 1995. ==Member of Parliament== In 1994, O'Farrell was preselected to replace former Transport Minister and Deputy Liberal Leader, Bruce Baird, in the safe Liberal seat of Northcott and won the seat on 25 March 1995 at the 1995 election with 60.05% of the primary vote, 68.63% after preferences against Andrew Leigh, the Labor candidate who was elected in 2010 as the federal Member for Fraser. O'Farrell gave his maiden speech in Parliament on 19 September 1995. On 14 December 1998, State Opposition Leader Kerry Chikarovski appointed O'Farrell Shadow Minister for Small Business and Information Technology. When his seat of Northcott was abolished in the 1998 redistribution, O'Farrell decided to contest the equally safe seat of Ku-ring-gai, which had been vacated by the sitting member, Stephen O'Doherty, who had moved to contest the seat of Hornsby following the redistribution. O'Farrell represented Northcott until its abolition on 26 March 1999. His transfer bid was successful at the 1999 election, gaining 56.3% of the primary vote and 70.03% after preferences. When Ron Phillips was defeated at the election, thereby vacating the Deputy Leadership, O'Farrell stood for the position and was elected on 31 March 1999, defeating Chris Hartcher by one vote. Chikarovski then appointed him on 19 April 1999 to the senior role of Shadow Minister for Transport, dropping Small Business. At the 1999 republic referendum, O'Farrell voted against the proposal for Australia to become a republic with a president elected by the Parliament of Australia. In 2007, referring to his vote, O'Farrell stated \\"I'm not going to buy something that I don't believe is a better deal\\". In a further Shadow Cabinet reshuffle on 4 January 2002, O'Farrell lost Information Technology and became Shadow Minister for Innovation. However, when John Brogden deposed Chikarovski as Leader on 28 March 2002, O'Farrell also lost the Deputy Leadership, eleven votes to nine, to Chris Hartcher. O'Farrell was sacked from the shadow ministry but, on 1 September 2002, after six months on the backbench O'Farrell was appointed by Brogden as Shadow Minister for Education and Training and Shadow Special Minister of State. Following the 2003 state election, O'Farrell was re-elected as the Member for Ku-ring-gai with 71.60% of the two-party vote, O'Farrell successfully contested the deputy's position, replacing Hartcher. Brogden then appointed him on 8 April 2003 as Shadow Minister for Health, dropping his Education portfolio. After Brogden resigned as leader on 29 August 2005, Peter Debnam became leader when O'Farrell pulled out of the leadership race on the morning of the 1 September party vote. Debnam then appointed him as Shadow Leader of the House, Shadow Minister for Transport and Shadow Minister for Waterways on 20 March 2006. In a November reshuffle, O'Farrell was shifted to the senior position of Shadow Treasurer. ==Leader of the Opposition (2007–11)== O'Farrell celebrates the 2008 Ryde by-election win with newly elected Liberal member for Ryde Victor Dominello and NSW deputy opposition leader Jillian Skinner. O'Farrell with Victor Dominello, Andrew Stoner and Gladys Berejiklian outside North Ryde Public School in November 2008. After the Liberals were defeated in the 2007 state election, O'Farrell announced his intention to challenge Debnam for party leadership. When it was apparent that Debnam did not have enough support to keep his post, he opted not to recontest, leaving O'Farrell to take the leadership unopposed. Jillian Skinner was elected Deputy Leader. He later appointed himself Shadow Minister for Western Sydney in the Shadow Ministry. In June 2008, Newspoll reported that O'Farrell led Morris Iemma in the preferred premier stakes. Wagga Wagga. In 2008, O'Farrell led by-election campaigns in Lakemba, Ryde, and Cabramatta where the Coalition recorded the largest by-election swing against Labor in its history. The Liberals achieved a swing of 22.7% in Cabramatta and 13% in Lakemba. Ryde, once a safe Labor seat, was taken by Liberal Victor Dominello on a swing of 23.1%. Wahroonga. On 2 September 2009, in the wake of the resignation of Labor's John Della Bosca following an affair, O'Farrell introduced a motion of no confidence on the Premier Nathan Rees and the NSW Government. O'Farrell was hoping to push an early election saying that \\"The job of changing New South Wales for the better needs to start today. The best thing that Nathan Rees could do is to allow the people to have their say through an early election\\". The motion was put to the house but defeated on party lines. Despite this, all independent members of the Legislative Assembly voted for the motion. In June 2010, the Liberals' Stuart Ayres won the Penrith by-election with a swing of 25%–at the time, the biggest swing against a sitting government in NSW history. The by- election was caused by the resignation of Karyn Paluzzano after she admitted rorting her electoral mail allowance and lying about it to the ICAC. A jubilant O'Farrell stated, \\"What we've seen this evening is the Liberal Party win its first seat in Western Sydney in 20 years. It demonstrates once and for all that Labor does not have a lock on Western Sydney.\\" The Entrance, New South Wales, in March 2010. In August 2010, independent MP and lord mayor of Sydney Clover Moore introduced the Adoption Amendment (Same Sex Couples) Bill as a private member's bill, which, among other things, had the purpose of giving same-sex couples the right to adopt as a couple instead of as individuals. Both O'Farrell and Premier Kristina Keneally allowed a conscience vote on the bill. O'Farrell supported the reforms: \\"I support this measure today ... for the sake of children but also because I don't believe our society should exclude because of gender, sexuality, faith, background or some other factor, people who have a contribution they can make... That's not the free and confident society I seek.\\" The bill was passed by the Legislative Assembly 46 votes to 44. In late 2010, following the government announcement of the sale of NSW's electricity assets, O'Farrell called for a judicial inquiry into the matter. After rejecting a judicial inquiry, Premier Kristina Keneally shut down or \\"prorogued\\" Parliament early to try to stop a parliamentary inquiry announced by O'Farrell. O'Farrell maintained pressure on the issue over the Christmas/New Year period arguing the public had a right to know whether fair price had been achieved, why eight directors had resigned over the sale and what impact the sale would have on power bills. On 6 January, Keneally bowed to pressure and agreed to attend an inquiry she had earlier called \\"unconstitutional\\". On the eve of the 2011 election, ABC radio reported that NSW Labor could be facing \\"the biggest loss in Australian political history\\", with the statewide swing predicted at between 16 and 18 points. Asked to define himself ideologically, O'Farrell told the ABC: > I describe myself as a classic Liberal. You know, ascribe to those Liberal > principles but like Menzies believe that the role of government is to apply > the principles, the plans, the policies to an issue that suit the times. So > Menzies used to say that it must be great being an ideologue because it > saves time thinking. Menzies wanted to deliver real change, wanted to > deliver real solutions and that's where I put myself. The Coalition were unbackable favourites to win the 2011 election; by the time the writs were dropped they had been ahead in opinion polling for almost three years. The final Newspoll saw a two-party-preferred figure of 64.1 percent for the Coalition and 35.9 percent for Labor. Opinion polls and commentators had almost universally written Labor off by the time the writs were dropped. Indeed, speculation centred on how large O'Farrell's majority would be, and whether Labor would hold onto enough seats to form a credible opposition. As a measure of how far Labor's stocks had fallen, the Coalition was threatening Labor in seats that the non-Labor side hadn't held in over a century, as well as seats where the Coalition had not been a serious threat since the Great Depression. As expected, O'Farrell went on to lead the Coalition to a comprehensive victory on a swing of over 16%, the highest for a general election in Australia since World War II.David Clune, 'The Campaign' in D Clune and R Smith eds From Carr to Keneally: Labor in office in NSW 1995–2011, Allen and Unwin, 2012. The Coalition won several seats in Labor's traditional west Sydney heartland, many of which had previously been safe for Labor; two of them, Smithfield and Campbelltown, fell to the Liberals on 20 percent swings. The Liberal Party achieved an overall gain of 27 seats, while the National Party gained 5 seats, for a total of 69 seats–the largest majority government in NSW history.Antony Green, 'The Results', in D Clune and R Smith eds, From Carr to Keneally: Labor in office in NSW 1995–2011, Allen and Unwin, 2012. In his own seat of Ku-ring-gai, already considered an ultra-safe Liberal seat, O'Farrell achieved 72.7% of the primary vote, 87% after preferences, for an overall majority of 37%, making his own seat the safest in the state. The Liberals won a majority in their own right, with 51 seats—the first time the main non-Labor party in New South Wales had won an outright majority since adopting the Liberal label in 1945. Although O'Farrell did not require the support of the Nationals in order to govern, he opted to retain the Coalition. ==Premier of New South Wales (2011–14)== O'Farrell was sworn in as Premier by the Governor of New South Wales, Marie Bashir, on 28 March 2011. Although O'Farrell's victory was beyond doubt, counting was still underway in a few seats at the time. For this reason, O'Farrell had himself and NSW Nationals leader Andrew Stoner sworn in as an interim two-man governmenta move similar to how Gough Whitlam took office after winning the 1972 federal election. The full ministry was sworn in on 3 April 2011 at a formal ceremony at Government House by the Lieutenant Governor, Justice James Spigelman. Upon taking office, O'Farrell reduced the size of the Premier's personal staff and moved the office from Governor Macquarie Tower back to the historic Premier's office within Parliament House. Following the swearing in of cabinet, on 4 April O'Farrell announced a \\"100 Day Action Plan\\", outlining the agenda of his government for his first one hundred days in office. O'Farrell moved to rein in public expenditure by capping public service wage increases at 2.5% a year, with any additional increases to be justified by real productivity increases, and by abolishing the 'unattached list' for public servants. O'Farrell ensured the wages cap also applied to Members of Parliament and even secured agreement from the Governor, Her Excellency Professor Marie Bashir, for the limit to apply to her wage increases. The new Government also enshrined the independence of the public service by the establishing of an independent Public Service Commission, to implement structural reform, chaired by former federal department head Peter Shergold. As part of his determination to rein in spending, O'Farrell proposed reducing the lifetime office, staff, car and driver entitlements of former Premiers. In response three former Premiers – Neville Wran, Nick Greiner and Bob Carr – obtained legal advice and threatened to take court action to maintain their emoluments. After negotiations, changes were effected that saw the bill to taxpayers reduced by $770,000 in 2012/13 from $1.6 million in 2011/12. In announcing the changes, O'Farrell said \\"We went to the election with a commitment to cut costs. It's only fair former premiers do their bit. Long-serving premiers in NSW have until now been given lifelong entitlements, but it's time that practice ended.\\" O'Farrell also fulfilled his election promise to repeal the controversial powers granted under part 3A of the Planning and Assessment Act that allowed the government to over-ride decisions by local councils about major developments. Another aspect was the creation of Infrastructure NSW, which is to decide upon which infrastructure projects take precedence, funding requirements and overall delivery. O'Farrell then appointed former Liberal Premier Nick Greiner as its Chairman. On 13 May 2011, the O'Farrell Government moved to retrospectively change commercial contracts relating to the Solar Rebate Scheme that saw eligible households paid a gross feed-in tariff of 60 cents a kilowatt hour. This move followed revelations the scheme had blown out in cost from A$400 million to A$1.9 billion. Without compensation, the rebate tariff would have been reduced by 33% to 40 cents a kilowatt hour from 1 July 2011 through to the conclusion of the scheme in 2016. However, the Legislative Council made it clear that they would not agree to roll the bonus back and the government conceded. The scheme was closed to new customers 28 April 2011. On 7 October 2011, O'Farrell announced that the Governor of New South Wales, Marie Bashir, would live in Government House, 15 years after Premier Bob Carr's decision to not have the governor live there, arguing \\"that's what it was built for\\". In the lead up to the 2011 election, as part of his determination to reinvigorate the State's economy, O'Farrell committed to re-engaging NSW with Asia, especially China and India. In July 2011 he led a trade delegation to China, travelling to India in November of that year. As Premier O'Farrell visited each country annually, renewing NSW's sister-state relationship with China's Guangdong province and establishing one with the State of Maharastra in India. In 2013, during a meeting with then Gujarat Chief Minister, Narendra Modi, O'Farrell secured agreement for a second sister state relationship. In 2014 he joined Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, and other State Premiers on a trade mission to China. During 'Australia in China' week, O'Farrell visited Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing participating in a State banquet hosted by China's President Xi Jinping in Beijing's Great Hall of the People. During a visit to Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates in May 2012, O'Farrell was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Lebanese Maronite Order Université Saint-Esprit de Kaslik. In receiving the honour, O'Farrell said: At the December 2012 Council of Australian Governments meeting, O'Farrell reached agreement with Prime Minister Gillard, for NSW to become the first state or territory to secure funding for the full rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. When fully operational in 2018/19, the Federal Government will commit A$3.3 billion and the NSW Government A$3.1 billion to provide individualised care and support to an estimated people with disabilities throughout New South Wales. At a joint media conference with Gillard, O'Farrell praised the efforts of his Minister for Ageing and Disabilities Andrew Constance in helping to finalise the deal. On 19 April 2013, O'Farrell expressed support for legalising same-sex marriage, on the ground of individual freedom, after it had been legalised in New Zealand. O'Farrell also urged federal Opposition leader Tony Abbott to allow a conscience vote on same-sex marriage in the federal parliament. On 23 April 2013, O'Farrell became the first state premier to sign up to the federal government's Gonski national education reforms, securing A$5 billion in additional funding for the State's schools. In mid-March 2014, the O'Farrell state government's Community Services Minister, Pru Goward, announced the prospective sale of around 300 harbourfront public housing properties under the management of Government Property NSW. Goward explained that the proceeds generated from the sale, expected to be in the hundreds of millions, will be reinvested into the public housing system. Considered historic structures, the harbourfront properties are located at Millers Point, The Rocks and on Gloucester Street, and include the Sirius complex, a high-rise, 79-unit apartment complex near the Harbour Bridge that is an example of brutalist architecture. Throughout his political career, O'Farrell was a strong supporter or multiculturalism and as Opposition Leader he sought to actively engage Sydney's ethnic communities. Commentators attributed this to his strong 2011 election victory with Professor Andrew Jakubowic stating: \\"...the massive margins once enjoyed by Labor in seats such as Lakemba, Auburn, Bankstown, Canterbury, Liverpool and Kogarah may never return, at least at a state level, because of Barry O’Farrell’s appeal to ethnic voters. He could lock in that vote for the Coalition for a long time if he continues to build on his reputation as a moderate\\".https://www.aspg.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Elaine- Thompson.pdf p33 As Premier, O'Farrell implemented the Multicultural Advantage Action Plan 2012–2015. In 2014 O'Farrell took issue with the claim by Federal Attorney General, Senator George Brandis that people 'have a right to be a bigots' stating: \\"In commendably seeking to protect freedom of speech, we must not lower our defences against the evil of racial and religious intolerance. Bigotry should never be sanctioned, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Vilification on the grounds of race or religion is always wrong. There's no place for inciting hatred within our Australia society.\\" ===2014 ICAC investigation and subsequent resignation=== In April 2014, O'Farrell appeared as a witness during an investigation by the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption into alleged actions by Australian Water Holdings (AWH). At the inquiry, it was alleged that O'Farrell had received a A$3,000 bottle of Grange Hermitage wine from an AWH executive, which he had failed to declare. O'Farrell initially denied his receipt of the gift, but on the evening of 15 April, he was advised of a \\"thank you\\" note, to be presented to the ICAC, that he handwrote for AWH CEO Nick Di Girolamo. The note, presented as an ICAC exhibit, read: \\"Dear Nick & Jodie, We wanted to thank you for your kind note & the wonderful wine. 1959 was a very good year, even if it is getting even further away! Thanks for _all_ your support. Kind regards.\\" On 16 April 2014, O'Farrell stated in a press conference that he had had \\"a massive memory fail\\" and he still could not explain a gift that he had \\"no recollection of\\". At a media conference he announced his intention to resign as the Premier of NSW. O'Farrell then re-appeared at ICAC, apologising for his error. The Counsel assisting the Commission reiterated there was no suggestion O'Farrell engaged in corrupt conduct. ICAC's report subsequently cleared him finding that it was satisfied, \\"that there was no intention on Mr O'Farrell's part to mislead\\".http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/former-nsw-premier-barry- ofarrell-cleared-of-any-wrongdoing-in-icac-report/news- story/47241d2d611119338d6ce0d177371028 Date=3 August 2017 Responding to subsequent media criticism, the counsel assisting, Geoffrey Watson SC, said that \\"at a personal level\\" he was sorry that his questions had unexpectedly resulted in O'Farrell's resignation. On 23 April 2014 Treasurer Mike Baird was elected unopposed as Liberal Party leader and was subsequently sworn in as the 44th NSW Premier. On 24 November 2014, O'Farrell announced his intention not to stand for re-election at the 2015 NSW election, and he retired from politics at that election. ==Post-politics career== On 9 June 2015 Foreign Minister Julie Bishop appointed O'Farrell to be Deputy Chairman of the Australia-India Council, which aims to promote trade and investment ties between the two countries: \\"Mr O'Farrell's commitment to building deeper economic and community ties between Australia and India is well demonstrated. As Premier of New South Wales, he led annual trade missions to India. He also initiated the sister State relationship between New South Wales and Maharashtra in 2012.\\" He began his term on the council on 1 August. In September 2015, the Federal Social Services Minister, Scott Morrison, announced that O'Farrell would also lead a Federal Government review into offshore gambling websites. In February 2016, the Minister for Sport, Stuart Ayres, announced O'Farrell's appointment to the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust. In 2016 O'Farrell also joined the boards of the Royal Flying Doctor Service South Eastern Section (https://www.flyingdoctor.org.au/nswact/) and Obesity Australia (http://www.obesityaustralia.org) In September 2016 NSW Premier Mike Baird announced that O'Farrell had been appointed to the unpaid position of NSW's Special Envoy – India. O'Farrell left these three positions on 31 December 2018 to take on a new not-for-profit role with Diabetes Australia. On 7 December 2016 the Board of Racing Australia announced that O'Farrell had been appointed as the organisation's CEO. He commenced in the full-time position in early 2017. In January 2018 he became inaugural Chair of the New South Wales Rugby League's Foundation Diabetes Australia announced his appointment as its Independent President and Board Chair on 16 January 2019. On 12 March 2019 it was announced that O'Farrell had been appointed Chair of the NRL's West Tigers Rugby League Football Club ===High Commissioner to India=== On 18 February 2020, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Marise Payne, announced O'Farrell's appointment as Australian High Commissioner to India and non-resident accredited Ambassador to Bhutan. On 21 May 2020, O'Farrell presented his credentials to the President of India, Ram Nath Kovind, in India's first ever virtual credentials ceremony. ==Personal and community life== O'Farrell was first married in 1987. The union lasted for less than a year and he seeks to maintain the privacy of his former wife. While working for Bruce Baird in Sydney, O'Farrell met Rosemary Cowan, Baird's personal assistant and the daughter of Bruce Cowan, a former Nationals state and federal politician. O'Farrell and Rosemary Cowan married in late 1992 and had two sons. Soon after becoming a Member of Parliament, he had been nicknamed \\"Fatty O'Barrel\\" by political opponents due to his weight. But in the period 2003–2005 O'Farrell is reported to have lost 40–50 kilograms. As a Member of Parliament 1995–2005, O'Farrell was involved in various local organisations including Ku-ring-gai Amateur Swimming Club, the Ku-ring-gai Historical Society and was an honorary Member of the Rotary Club of Wahroonga. O'Farrell was also Vice Patron of the Sir David Martin Foundation and Patron of the RSPCA NSW Branch. O'Farrell walked the 110 km long Kokoda Track in 2014, with his youngest son and Seven News state political reporter Lee Jeloscek. In 2008 he did the same trek with his eldest son. O'Farrell was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in the 2020 Australia Day Honours for \\"distinguished service to the people and Parliament of New South Wales, particularly as Premier, and to the community.\\" ==External links== * Parliamentary Profile ==References== Category:Living people Category:1959 births Category:Australian monarchists Category:Australian National University alumni Category:Australian people of Irish descent Category:Australian public servants Category:Australian Roman Catholics Category:Leaders of the Opposition in New South Wales Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:Liberal Party of Australia members of the Parliament of New South Wales Category:Officers of the Order of Australia Category:People educated at St John's College, Darwin Category:People from the North Shore, Sydney Category:Politicians from Melbourne Category:Premiers of New South Wales Category:21st-century Australian politicians Category:High Commissioners of Australia to India Category:Ambassadors of Australia to Bhutan ","title":"Barry O'Farrell"},{"id":"2565772","text":"Xavier Clifford Nady VI (; born November 14, 1978) is an American former professional baseball outfielder and first baseman. Nady played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets, Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs, Arizona Diamondbacks, Washington Nationals, San Francisco Giants, and the San Diego Padres. The St. Louis Cardinals originally drafted Nady in the 4th round of the 1997 Major League Baseball draft (134th overall) after he was named Northern California Player of the Year in his senior year of high school (but he did not sign professionally at that time). Nady attended University of California, Berkeley, where he set the all-time Pac-10 Conference record for career slugging percentage (.729) for the California Golden Bears baseball team. ==Professional career== ===San Diego Padres=== Nady was drafted in the second round of the 2000 Major League Baseball draft by the San Diego Padres (49th overall).

Nady only appeared in one major league game before being sent to the minor leagues. He was named Padres Minor League Player of the Year in , also collecting the California League's Most Valuable Player and Rookie of the Year awards that season. Nady underwent Tommy John surgery and had limited playing time in . In he again returned to the major league level for part of the season, but spent most of his time in the minor leagues.

Nady underwent an emergency appendectomy early in the morning on May 30, 2006. As a result, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list, and returned to the lineup on June 18. Pittsburgh Pirates in 2007 ===Pittsburgh Pirates=== On July 30, 2006, Mets set-up relief pitcher Duaner Sánchez was injured when the cab in which he was a passenger was broadsided. The Mets' pitching corps was already depleted with star pitcher Pedro Martínez on the disabled list. Desperate for pitching, the Mets were forced to give up Nady, their starting right fielder, to the Pirates in exchange for pitchers Óliver Pérez and Roberto Hernández. ===New York Yankees=== Nady with the Yankees in 2008 On July 26, 2008, the New York Yankees acquired Nady and pitcher Dámaso Marte from the Pittsburgh Pirates for José Tábata, Ross Ohlendorf, Daniel McCutchen, and Jeff Karstens.

He finished the 2008 season setting career-highs in home runs (25) and runs batted in (97), and had a .305 batting average. Xavier Nady signed a one- year contract worth $6.65 million with the Yankees, thus avoiding arbitration. On April 14, 2009, Nady suffered a right-elbow injury which ultimately required a second Tommy John surgery on July 8, despite an initial attempt to rehab the injury. The surgery ended his 2009 season. As a result, Nick Swisher took over in Nady's position for the remainder of the 2009 season. Nady spent the season (including the postseason) on the disabled list until the Yankees won the 2009 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies. He filed for free agency following the conclusion of the 2009 season.

Allegheny Energy was an electric utility headquartered in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. It owned and operated electric generation facilities and delivered electric services to customers in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, and Virginia. Allegheny Energy was incorporated in Maryland in 1925 as West Penn Electric Company. One of its predecessor companies dates back to the formation of West Penn Power on January 31, 1907. The company had three primary businesses: \\"merchant generation,\\" which operated power plants primarily in Pennsylvania and West Virginia; \\"transmission expansion;\\" and \\"utility operations,\\" consisting of transmission and distribution operations serving 1.6 million customers, primarily in small towns and rural areas. Allegheny merged with FirstEnergy in February 2011. ==Subsidiary companies== Allegheny Energy operated its electric distribution operations under the trade name Allegheny Power. Its regulated subsidiaries were West Penn Power (serving Southwestern and Central Pennsylvania), Monongahela Power (\\"Mon Power,\\" serving Northern and Southern West Virginia, as well as Hancock and Brooke Counties in the Northern Panhandle), and The Potomac Edison Company (western Maryland, parts of eastern West Virginia, and (until 2010) northern Virginia). The electric generating plants were operated by subsidiary Allegheny Energy Supply Company and Monongahela Power. In 1999, Monongahela Power purchased the distribution assets of West Virginia Power, a utility owned by UtiliCorp United based in Lewisburg, West Virginia. West Virginia Power's operations were centered on portions of southeastern West Virginia. It is said UtiliCorp sold the subsidiary to concentrate on its main operations in the midwestern US. UtiliCorp had purchased the division from Dominion Resources in 1986, of which it had operated as the West Virginia Power division of Virginia Electric & Power Company (VEPCO). Allegheny Energy formerly operated in sections of eastern Ohio, until early 2006, when regulatory issues within Ohio forced them to sell the territory to Columbus Southern Power, a division of American Electric Power, Inc. In 2010, Allegheny officially sold their Virginia service area. Counties west of the Blue Ridge Mountains were purchased by Shenandoah Valley Electric Cooperative of Mount Crawford, Virginia, while counties to the east were sold to Rappahannock Electric Cooperative of Fredericksburg, Virginia. ==Merger== In 1997, Allegheny and Duquesne Light Holding Company (DQE) agreed to a $4.3 billion merger with headquarters remaining in Hagerstown, Maryland. However DQE backed out of the deal by 1998. In February 2010, Allegheny announced plans to merge with FirstEnergy. The merger was completed on February 25, 2011.FirstEnergy press release: \\"FirstEnergy- Allegheny Energy Merger Closes Effective Today\\", February 25, 2011. ==Customer service== Allegheny Power was ranked number one in customer satisfaction among utilities in the northeastern United States in 2010, according to TQS Research. The recent recognition marks the sixth consecutive year large commercial and industrial customers rated Allegheny Power the region's top performer. Southwestern Pennsylvania, excluding the city of Pittsburgh, provided about half of regulated utility revenues.Allegheny Energy website ==Environmental policies, practice and record== Allegheny has indicated that its policy is \\"to produce and distribute electricity in a reliable and responsible manner that protects its personnel, communities, customers, and the environment.\\" In February 1995, the company signed a participation accord with the United States Department of Energy as a participant in the Climate Challenge Program. Under this accord, Allegheny Energy agreed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions (as carbon dioxide equivalents) by two million tons per year by 2000. Through a series of reduction efforts including demand side management programs, heat-rate, and efficiency improvements on generation equipment, transportation alternatives, and land-use management involving forestation and vegetative sequestration efforts, Allegheny was able to achieve just under 8.5 million tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent reductions. These reductions fulfilled the company's Climate Challenge commitment goal by the calendar year 2000.U.S. Department of Energy's 1605(b) Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases report. Carbon dioxide reduction efforts have continued since 2000, and Allegheny has since recorded another 9 million tons of avoided emissions through continued efficiency improvements, demand-side management measures, and vegetative sequestration. The company complied with current sulfur dioxide emissions standards through a system-wide plan combining the use of emission controls, low sulfur fuel and emission allowances. Allegheny has taken steps to significantly reduce sulfur dioxide emissions at its generating facilities, investing $1.3 billion to install clean air technology at both the Hatfield's Ferry and Fort Martin power stations. With the addition of scrubbers at these plants, 85 percent of its coal-fired fleet now utilizes the best available controls for reducing sulfur dioxide emissions. Allegheny now has one of the cleanest fleets in the United States with respect to sulfur dioxide.[Company news release, Feb. 4, 2010] The scrubber projects will also significantly reduce mercury emissions at these power stations. ==2005 litigation== In 2005, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Maryland filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against Allegheny Energy. The suit claimed that Allegheny Energy has made major upgrades at its Armstrong, Hatfield's Ferry, and Mitchell electric generating stations, having dramatically increased emissions without installing new pollution controls required by the Clean Air Act. A trial was held in 2010. But in the five years that elapsed between the filing of the suit and the trial, the company's sulfur dioxide emissions profile improved significantly. The scrubbers at Fort Martin and Hatfield’s Ferry, completed in 2009, removed approximately 95 percent of the sulfur dioxide emissions at those facilities, totaling more than 200,000 tons annually from the two plants. Mercury emissions at the facilities have also dropped significantly as result of the scrubbers. In 2014 the suit was dropped. At the time the suit was filed, opponents claimed that the plants were emitting thousands of tons of pollution each year, including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, which were allegedly wind-blown into New Jersey. They also claimed this causes smog, acid rain, and different respiratory disease. \\"New Jersey continues to pursue litigation to protect our citizens' health and meet clean air quality standards,\\" Gov. Jon S. Corzine said. \\"This decision proves that New Jersey can and will pursue action to enforce the Clean Air Act's protections even when the federal government abdicates its own responsibility to do so.\\" The 2005 suit claimed that three plants at issue in the litigation were at the time emitting in total hundreds of thousands of tons of pollutants a year. It also claimed that the three plants were putting out more nitrogen oxide emissions than all the power plants in New Jersey combined and more than three times the total amount of sulfur dioxide emissions emitted by all New Jersey power plants. The 2005 litigation also claimed that the Hatfield's Ferry plant was at that time the fifth largest single source of sulfur dioxide emissions in the country. The suit claimed violations of Pennsylvania's air pollution laws and regulations. New Jersey sought injunctive relief to require Allegheny to reduce its harmful emissions by installing up to date pollution controls at each of the three plants. The states also asked the court to apply penalties and order Allegheny to take additional appropriate actions to make up for the harm done to public health and the environment by its violations of federal and state law. ==See also== * Logans Ferry Mine Tunnel built by West Penn Power (Pennsylvania), a predecessor company == References == ==External links== *Allegheny Energy website *Allegheny Power website *Allegheny Historical SEC Filings *FREC map of historical territory Category:Electric power companies of the United States Category:Companies based in Pittsburgh Category:American companies established in 1925 Category:FirstEnergy ","title":"Allegheny Energy"},{"id":"2565824","text":"Ben E. \\"Benny\\" Benack (August 31, 1921 - July 23, 1986) was at the forefront of the Pittsburgh jazz scene in the 1960s and '70s.Armstrong, Louis. “Bandstand Philosopher.” Future of Jazz- Heritage Programs. By Robert Macculley, Adam Linch, and Benny Benack. New Orleans. Brigham Young University’s Special Collection. Audio. A talented trumpet player, Benack was made famous by his song \\"Beat'em Bucs\\" and was a staple at Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Steelers games. The Benny Benack Orchestra played the styles of traditional jazz, dixieland, and swing. He was known as the \\"King of Dixieland\\" in Pittsburgh for many years. Benack was born to Italian immigrant parents in 1921 and grew up in Clairton, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh. His father, Charlie, was a self-taught photographer who started out walking from one mill town to another in the Monongahela River valley, his equipment on a donkey, making family portraits and class photographs. Uninterested in following in the photography business, young Benny began playing trumpet at age five, and practiced for six or seven hours a day throughout his childhood. He was educated in the fine arts department of the Carnegie Institute of Technology, now Carnegie Mellon University, where he was friends with jazz composer Sammy Nestico. He also attended the University of Pittsburgh. He played at army bases in Florida and India during World War II, was director of a group of young musicians known as the Dodge Kids, and toured the country with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra and the Raymond Scott Orchestra. During the late 1950s and '60s, he was an innovative bandleader at Clairton High School, introducing jazz, swing, and high-stepping routines to the marching band's pregame and halftime performances. Benack died in 1986 of lung cancer. He and his wife Gretchen had three children: Peek, Flip, and Suzie, each of whom had two children of their own. Peek and Flip both live near Pittsburgh with their families, while Suzie moved to upstate New York. Peek continues the family musical tradition as Benny Benack Jr., playing trumpet, clarinet, and saxophone. Peek's son, Benny Benack III, is following in his grandfather's footsteps as a jazz trumpeter and vocalist, touring the world as an international soloist with such artists as Post-Modern Jukebox, Christian McBride, Josh Groban, Isaac Mizrahi, Joey DeFrancesco, and many others. He was featured in \\"Maya & Marty\\" on NBC as part of the In-House Band, and is releasing his sophomore album \\"A Lot of Livin' to Do\\" in January 2020 .

The current publication is the result of the 2019 acquisition of The Times-Picayune (itself a result of the 1914 union of The Picayune with the Times-Democrat) by the New Orleans edition of The Advocate (based in Baton Rouge), which began publication in 2013 as a response to The Times-Picayune switching from a daily publication schedule to a Wednesday/Friday/Sunday schedule in October 2012 (The Times-Picayune resumed daily publication in 2014). The Times-Picayune was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 2006 for its coverage of Hurricane Katrina. Four of The Times-Picayune’s staff reporters also received Pulitzers for breaking-news reporting for their coverage of the storm, one of whom was Gordon Russell.https://www.nola.com/news/environment/article_b42ef31f-6598-590d-9da1-bdb71051723a.html The paper funds the Edgar A. Poe Award for journalistic excellence, which is presented annually by the White House Correspondents' Association. ==History== The New Orleans Item newsroom at work, circa 1900 Established as The Picayune in 1837 by Francis Lumsden and George Wilkins Kendall, the paper's initial price was one picayune, a Spanish coin equivalent to 6¼¢ (half a bit, or one- sixteenth of a dollar). Under Eliza Jane Nicholson, who inherited the struggling paper when her husband died in 1876, the Picayune introduced innovations such as society reporting (known as the \\"Society Bee\\" columns), children's pages, and the first women's advice column, which was written by Dorothy Dix. Between 1880 and 1890, the paper more than tripled its circulation. The paper became The Times-Picayune after merging in 1914 with its rival, the New Orleans Times-Democrat.\\"Old Newspapers to Merge,\\" NY Times, April 3, 1914. In 1962, Samuel Irving Newhouse, Sr., bought the morning daily The Times-Picayune and the other remaining New Orleans daily, the afternoon States-Item. The papers were merged on June 2, 1980 and were known as The Times-Picayune/States-Item (except on Sundays; the States-Item did not publish a Sunday edition) until September 30, 1986. In addition to the flagship paper, specific community editions of the newspaper are also circulated and retain the Picayune name, such as the Gretna Picayune for nearby Gretna, Louisiana. The paper is owned by Georges Media, whose chairman is New Orleans businessman John Georges. In the vernacular of its circulation area, the newspaper is often called the T-P. ===Hurricane Katrina=== Hurricane Katrina became a significant part of The Times-Picayune's history, not only during the storm and its immediate aftermath, but for years afterward in repercussions and editorials. As Hurricane Katrina approached on Sunday, August 28, 2005, dozens of the newspaper's staffers who opted not to evacuate rode out the storm in their office building, sleeping in sleeping bags and on air mattresses. Holed up in a small, sweltering interior office space—the photography department—outfitted as a \\"hurricane bunker,\\" the newspaper staffers and staffers from the paper's affiliated website, NOLA.com, posted continual updates on the internet until the building was evacuated on August 30. With electrical outages leaving the presses out of commission after the storm, newspaper and web staffers produced a \\"newspaper\\" in electronic PDF format. On NOLA.com, meanwhile, tens of thousands of evacuated New Orleans and Gulf Coast residents began using the site's forums and blogs, posting pleas for help, offering aid, and directing rescuers. NOLA's nurturing of so-called citizen journalism on a massive scale was hailed by many journalism experts as a watershed, while a number of agencies credited the site with leading to life- saving rescues and reunions of scattered victims after the storm. After deciding to evacuate on Tuesday, August 30, because of rising floodwaters and possible security threats, the newspaper and web staff set up operations at The Houma Courier and in Baton Rouge, on the Louisiana State University campus. A small team of reporters and photographers volunteered to stay behind in New Orleans to report from the inside on the city's struggle, looting, and desperation. They armed themselves for security and worked out of a private residence. The August 30, August 31, and September 1 editions were not printed, but were available online, as was the paper's breaking news blog: After three days of online-only publication, the paper began printing again, first in Houma, La., and beginning September 15, 2005, in Mobile, Ala.; it resumed publication in New Orleans on October 10, 2005. The paper was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 2006 for its coverage of the storm, and several of its staff reporters also received the award for breaking news reporting for their coverage of Hurricane Katrina––Gordon Russell, Jed Horne and Bob Marshall––marking the first time a Pulitzer had been awarded for online journalism. In a January 14, 2006 address to the American Bar Association Communications Lawyers Forum, Times-Picayune editor Jim Amoss commented on perhaps the greatest challenge that the staff faced then, and continued to face as the future of New Orleans is contemplated: ===Limited publication dates, launch of The New Orleans Advocate=== Allen Toussaint playing at one of the (ultimately unsuccessful) rallies to \\"Save the Picayune\\" as a daily newspaper On May 24, 2012, the paper's owner, Advance Publications, announced that the print edition of the Times-Picayune would be published three days a week (Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday) beginning at the end of September. News of the change was first revealed the night before in a blog post by New York Times media writer David Carr. A new company, NOLA Media Group, was created to oversee both the paper and its website, NOLA.com. Along with the change in its printing schedule, Advance also announced that significant cuts would be coming to the newsroom and staff of the Picayune. A second new company, Advance Central Services Louisiana, was created to print and deliver the newspaper. The decision to end daily circulation led to protests calling for continued publication for the common good; fifty local businesses wrote an open letter to the Newhouse family, urging them to sell the paper instead, since they had stated it was still profitable. An group of community institutions and civic leaders, The Times-Picayune Citizens Group, was formed to seek alternatives for the continued daily publication of the newspaper. Cameron McWhirter, \\"New Orleans Clamors for Its Paper: Civic Leaders Explore Media Alternatives, but Urge Publisher to Keep the Times- Picayune as a Daily\\", The Wall Street Journal, June 12, 2012 In October 2012, The Times-Picayune began publishing its broadsheet paper on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays. Along with the change, the paper began publishing a special tabloid-sized edition following Sunday and Monday New Orleans Saints football games and an \\"early\\" Sunday broadsheet edition, available on Saturdays. The thrice-weekly publication schedule made New Orleans the largest American city not to have a daily newspaper,Times-Picayune to reduce its print run - Al Jazeera Blogs until The Advocate of Baton Rouge began publishing a New Orleans edition each day to fill the perceived gap on August 18, 2013. On June 12, 2012, Advance followed through with its layoff plans, as about 200 Times-Picayune employees (including almost half of the newsroom staff) were notified that they would lose their jobs. In January 2013, NOLA Media Group moved its news-gathering operation, along with sales, marketing and other administrative functions, from its building at 3800 Howard Avenue, New Orleans, to offices on the 32nd and 31st floors of the One Canal Place office tower at 365 Canal Street, New Orleans. Advance Central Services Louisiana employees remained at Howard Avenue. In April 2018, NOLA Media Group moved from the offices at One Canal Place to a newly renovated location at 201 St. Joseph Street, New Orleans. Its news staff, sales and sales support staff, marketing, and other administrative staff now work from the Warehouse District offices, offices in St. Tammany Parish at 500 River Highlands Blvd., Covington, and the existing East Jefferson Times Picayune Bureau at 4013 N Interstate 10 Service Road W, Metairie. ===The Times-Picayune's resumption of daily publication=== On April 30, 2013, the paper's publisher announced plans to print a tabloid version of The Times-Picayune, called Times-Picayune Street, on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, sold only through newsstands and retail locations. The move returned the paper to a daily printing schedule (including the \\"early\\" Sunday edition offered at newsstands on Saturdays). The TP Street edition first went on sale Monday, June 24, 2013. The new edition removed from New Orleans the designation as the largest city in the United States without its own daily newspaper; with The Times-Picayune, along with the New Orleans edition of The Advocate, the city now has two. However, in reporting its print circulation figures to the Alliance for Audited Media, The Times-Picayune still provides data only for the home-delivery days of Sunday, Wednesday, and Friday. The paper returned to a full broadsheet format on September 6, 2014, for all editions and ceased using the \\"TP Street\\" name. On the same date, NOLA Media Group began publishing \\"bonus\\" editions of The Times-Picayune on Saturdays and Mondays to be home-delivered to all three-day subscribers at no additional cost. The bonus editions were delivered for 17 weeks, the duration of the 2014 football season. On January 3, 2015, NOLA Media Group returned the paper to its previous three-day home delivery, printing two-section papers for street sales only on the other four days. On Saturday, February 13, 2016, NOLA Media Group debuted a street-sales only \\"Early Sunday\\" edition, a hybrid of features from the former Saturday street- sales only paper and sections from the Sunday paper, offered at the Sunday price. ===Additional cuts=== On October 21, 2014, the paper announced it would begin printing and packaging The Times-Picayune in Mobile, Alabama, sometime in late 2015 or early 2016, closing the plant on Howard Avenue in New Orleans and eliminating more than 100 jobs at Advance Central Services Louisiana. The Howard Avenue building, which housed all aspects of the newspaper operation, opened in 1968. The building's lobby is lined with custom panels by sculptor Enrique Alferez showing symbols used in communication throughout history. Although NOLA Media Group said in 2014 that it hoped to donate the building to a nonprofit institution in the community, it ultimately sold the building on September 2, 2016, to a local investor group for $3.5 million. The newspaper of Sunday, January 17, 2016, was the last Times-Picayune to be printed in New Orleans. The street-sales-only newspaper of Monday, January 18, 2016, was the first to be printed in Mobile. The New Orleans presses were to be decommissioned. The circulation numbers for the printed Times-Picayune were the largest of any newspaper in Louisiana until the end of 2014. By then, declines in its sales, combined with circulation gains by The Advocate, dropped The Times-Picayune to second place behind The Advocate. NOLA Media Group announced on June 15, 2015, that it would join with Alabama Media Group in a new regional media company across Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi, to be called Southeast Regional Media Group. Additional job losses were expected in Louisiana; those cuts came September 17, 2015, when NOLA Media Group fired 37 journalists, 28 of them full-time employees and nine part-timers. Hardest- hit were the Baton Rouge bureau, which had been expanded in the 2012 makeover, as well as The Times-Picayune's high school prep sports staff and its music reporting staff. The merged company was named Advance Media Southeast, registered in New Orleans. A facility to design and produce the pages of The Times-Picayune and four newspapers in Alabama and Mississippi—The Birmingham News, the Mobile Press-Register, The Huntsville Times, and The Mississippi Press in Pascagoula—was opened in January 2016 in a former suburban bureau of The Times-Picayune in Metairie, emptying the Howard Avenue building of the remaining staff. The Metairie building also houses Advance Central Services Southeast, formed from the combined Advance Central Services units in Louisiana and Alabama. Production of another Advance newspaper, The Oregonian, was moved to the Metairie location in late 2016. === 2019 acquisition === On May 2, 2019, Advance Publications announced that The Times-Picayune had been sold to Georges Media, owner of The Advocate. The new owners stated that both papers would be folded into a single operation by June 2019, and that the NOLA.com brand would be maintained for the combined newspaper's digital operations. A filing required under the WARN Act stated that the entire staff of the Times-Picayune had been laid off, resulting in a loss of 161 jobs, including 65 journalists. The merged paper initially re-hired 10 of those journalists, and about 12 other employees. The paper, carrying the nameplates of both The Times-Picayune and The New Orleans Advocate, began publication on July 1. ==The Times-Picayune  The New Orleans Advocate online== The Times- Picayunes first foray onto the internet came in 1995, with the www.NewOrleans.net website.Gray, Chris (January 7, 1996). \\"TP ushers in New N.O. Web page\\". Among the website's features was the \\"Bourbocam\\", placed in the window of a French Quarter bar to broadcast images of Bourbon Street. During the 1996 Mardi Gras, it was one of the first internet webcams to carry a live news event. In early 1998, that site was superseded by www.nolalive.com, launched by Advance Publications Internet. The site's format was similar to other websites launched in connection with Advance newspapers in New Jersey; Cleveland, Ohio; Michigan; Oregon; and Alabama. Although nolalive.com was affiliated with The Times-Picayune and posted content created by the T-P newsroom, it was operated independently, and it also hosted blogs and forums. In early 2001, the site was renamed NOLA.com. After a management change at NOLA.com in February 2009, content on the website more closely reflected that of The Times-Picayune. Articles written for the newspaper were posted to the website using the Movable Type content management system. In October 2018, the paper switched from Movable Type to Arc, the content management system created by developers at the Washington Post. Led by Advance, the site underwent several redesigns over the years. On May 8, 2012, the site debuted its most dramatic redesign, by Mule Design Studio of San Francisco. With bright yellow accents, the design echoed that of Advance's bellwether site in Michigan, mlive.com. Following complaints from the public, NOLA.com developed a toned-down palette and new typography. However, the concept – a continually updated \\"river\\" of combined news, sports and entertainment content – remained the same. After the October 1, 2012, launch of NOLA Media Group, the publication workflow of the newspaper and website was reversed. All staff-produced content is published first to NOLA.com; content then was harvested from the website for publication in the printed Times- Picayune. NOLA.com also offers apps for mobile and tablet users; The Times- Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate offers subscribers an e-edition only. ==Notable people== The writers William Faulkner and O. Henry worked for The Times-Picayune. The Louisiana historian Sue Eakin was formerly a Times- Picayune columnist. A weekly political column is penned by Robert \\"Bob\\" Mann, a Democrat who holds the Douglas Manship Chair of Journalism at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. The Times-Picayune was the longtime journalistic home of British-American satiric columnist James Gill, although he moved to The Advocate in 2013, along with many former Times-Picayune editorial staffers. For more than a decade, The Times-Picayune was also the newspaper home of Lolis Eric Elie who wrote a thrice weekly metro column, before he went on to write for television, most notably HBO's Treme and AMC's Hell on Wheels. Already widely known, the journalist and television commentator Iris Kelso joined The Times-Picayune in 1979. She had been particularly known for her coverage of the civil rights movement. William Hawthorn Lynch was an investigative journalist with the Times-Picayune's Baton Rouge bureau from 1979 until 1988, when he was named as the state's first inspector general, an office which investigates corruption, misuse of state equipment, and governmental inefficiencies.Obituary of William Hawthorn Lynch, The Times-Picayune, February 16, 2004 Lynch's colleague, Jack Wardlaw, another investigating journalist, was the Baton Rouge bureau chief from 1980 until his retirement in 2002. Patrick McCauley, the editor from 1966 to 1994 of The Huntsville Times in Huntsville, Alabama, worked for The Times-Picayune from 1960 to 1966; he was a Tulane graduate. ==Editorial stance== The Times- Picayune endorsed George W. Bush for President in 2000, but endorsed no Presidential candidate in 2004. In 2008 and 2012, the paper endorsed Democrat Barack Obama for President. It endorsed Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016. In gubernatorial contests it endorsed Mike Foster, Bobby Jindal, and David Vitter. In the mayoral race of 2006, The Times-Picayune endorsed right-leaning Democrat Ron Forman in the primary election and Lieutenant Governor Mitch Landrieu in the runoff. The Picayune endorsed Governor candidate Edwin Washington Edwards in 1971 and 1975, but went against him in 1983 (endorsing incumbent David C. Treen), 1987 (endorsing challenger and eventual winner Buddy Roemer) and 1991 (endorsed Roemer in the primary, but switched to Edwards in the general election due to Edwards' opponent being former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke). The T-P also stung Edwards in 1979 even though he was barred from running for a third term, refusing to endorse Edwards' hand-picked candidate, Louis Lambert, in favor of Treen both in the primary and general election. ===Journalism prizes and awards=== Lee Zurik accepts the Peabody Award for \\"Louisiana Purchased.\\" He is joined on stage by the WVUE-TV and NOLA.com crew. The Times-Picayune was awarded a 1997 Pulitzer Prize for a series analyzing the threatened global fish supply; that same year, staff cartoonist Walt Handelsman was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning. The Times-Picayune shared the 2006 Pulitzer Prize for public service coverage of Hurricane Katrina with The Sun Herald in similarly affected Biloxi, Mississippi. In addition, staff reporters Doug MacCash, Manuel Torres, Trymaine Lee, and Mark Schleifstein were awarded a Pulitzer for breaking news reporting. This award marked the first Pulitzer given for exclusively online journalism. For its coverage of Hurricane Katrina, The Times-Picayune also received the 2005 George Polk Award for Metropolitan Reporting,. Former Times-Picayune editorial cartoonist Mike Luckovich won the Pulitzer for his cartoons in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, some of which were also featured in New Orleans Magazine. ===Loving Cup Award=== Since 1901, The Times-Picayune  The New Orleans Advocate has annually awarded a Loving cup to individuals who have contributed to improving life in the New Orleans area, through civic, cultural, social, or religious activities. Representative awardees include: Eleanor McMain, Albert W. Dent, Edgar B. Stern Sr, Scott Cowen, Gary Solomon Sr., Millie Charles, Mark Surprenant, Leah Chase, Norman Francis, Tommy Cvitanovich, Edith Rosenwald Stern, and Bill Goldring. ===Ongoing criticism of FEMA=== Soon after The Times-Picayune was able to restart publication following Hurricane Katrina, the newspaper printed a strongly worded open letter to President George W. Bush in its September 4, 2005, edition, criticizing him for the federal government's response the disaster, and calling for the firing of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) chief Michael D. Brown. Brown tendered his resignation eight days later. The Times-Picayune long continued to editorialize on FEMA.A new start at FEMA, Times-Picayune, April 14, 2009, Saint Tammany Edition, p. B4. A searing editorial on April 18, 2009, lambasted FEMA and labeled \\"insulting\\" the alleged \\"attitude\\" of its spokesman Andrew ThomasFEMA unlikely to pay for hotels during Gustav on Homeland1.com. toward people who were cash-strapped after the evacuation from Hurricane Gustav, which in the meantime had become part of the melange of problems associated with hurricanes and governmental agencies. A second editorial on the same day blasted the State of Louisiana's Road Home program and its contractor ICF. The post-Katrina experience affected the paper's staff. On August 8, 2006, staff photographer John McCusker was arrested and hospitalized after he led police on a high-speed chase and then used his vehicle as a weapon, apparently hoping that they would kill him. McCusker was released from the hospital by mid-August, saying he could not recall the incident at all, which was apparently sparked by the failure to receive an insurance settlement for his damaged house. On December 13, 2007, Judge Camille Buras reduced the charges against McCusker to misdemeanors. The episode led to the establishment of a support fund for McCusker and for other Times-Picayune staff, which collected some $200,000 in a few days. In October 2006, columnist Chris Rose admitted to seeking treatment for clinical depression after a year of \\"crying jags\\" and other emotionally isolating behavior. ==See also== * List of newspapers in Louisiana ==References== ==External links== *NOLA.com *NOLA.com New Orleans Metro Real-Time News *Print editions of the Times-Picayune during Hurricane Katrina Category:1837 establishments in Louisiana Category:George Polk Award recipients Category:Newspapers published in New Orleans Category:Publications established in 1837 Category:Pulitzer Prize-winning newspapers Category:Pulitzer Prize for Public Service winners ","title":"The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate"},{"id":"2565835","text":"Duquesne Light Holdings, Inc.

Duquesne Light was one of the dozens of companies founded by inventor George Westinghouse and for its first 75 years of operation (1870s-1940s) was a subsidiary of the holding company known as the \\"Philadelphia Company\\". Other such companies also founded by Westinghouse such as the Equitable Gas company and other \\"Equitable\\" energy/electronic companies were equal subsidiaries with DQE when it was a subsidiary of the 'Philadelphia Company'. In 1997, Duquesne and Allegheny Energy agreed to a $4.3 billion merger with headquarters remaining in Hagerstown, Maryland. However DQE backed out of the deal by 1998. In May 2007, Duquesne was acquired by a consortium led by affiliates of the Australian-based Macquarie Group Limited. The consortium consists of several institutional investors which own all of the common equity of parent company, DQE Holdings, LLC. This classifies it as an investor-owned utility.

The film stars Corey Feldman, Mary Woronov, and Sarah Buxton. ==Plot== The movie begins on May 14, also known as Rock 'n' Roll High School day at Ronald Reagan High. The students decide to play a prank on the faculty of the staff, flushing all of the toilets in unison and causing the faulty pipes to burst (yet again), causing for widespread mayhem in the school, as other students leave their classrooms and run rampant down the hall with the perpetrators who organized the entire thing: four members of the band known as The Eradicators. During the confusion, their friend (and the fifth band member) rides through the halls on a dirt bike as well. Having had enough, the board of trustees tell Principal McGree that he is a failure as a disciplinarian, and that he is incapable of handling the school by himself. They tell him they're going to bring in someone new. The next day, an all black BMW seeping smoke from the insides arrives in the parking lot of the high school, and out steps a figure wearing a suit. Jesse, meanwhile, makes an encounter with Rita, a substitute teacher filling in for Mrs. Poindexter, the music teacher. After being chastised and asked to correct his behavior, Jesse becomes smitten with her. After viewing the personal ads, they find someone advertising the sale of their refrigerator, and pile into their car to go to the appropriate location, posing as the Luthuanian Church of Applicance Worship, meanwhile Vadar (the new vice principal) makes a new announcement for her entrance to Reagan High. Later that night Jones rigs a device to continually dial the same number over and over again to 1-900-976-ROCK to enter a contest and nominate their band The Eradicators as local heroes, in order to win tickets to go see a concert performed by The Pursuit of Happiness, before they perform a show at Reagan High to both make some money, and get their band better known, before thrashing the show after being insulted by the debutante Whitney and her friend Margaret. Apprehended by Vadar's hall monitors at the conclusion of the dance, they are chastised by Vadar and their classes are changed to no longer coincide with one another's schedules. Further, their lunch schedules are changed as well, making it impossible for them to practice any longer. In their new lunch period, they encounter a shut-in named Tabatha, the supposed daughter of a witch, who believes that the four basic food groups are Sugar, Salt, Fat, and Booze. This doesn't curb their behavior, however, and they continue with their trouble making in a business as usual fashion, mentally traumatizing Mrs. Grossman in the process (something that enrages Vadar), which leads to Vadar implementing a new operation known as 'Reagan High Super Secret Security Program'. Mag makes friends with Tabatha at this point, after a misunderstanding and they begin to hang out together. However, in the new RHSSSP program, the school is made into (as Vadar describes it) a school-wide detention hall. Their efforts to get the Pursuit of Happiness tickets are made useless, as Vadar and her monitors assault Screaming Steve and the Rock TV crew. Then, as punishment (for nothing at all it would seem) they are given four days of detention. At this point, Jesse is infuriated by the sentence, and vows revenge on Vadar, spurring The Eradicators to begin fighting back to protest, and they vow to play at the prom. Enlisting the help of Eaglebauer, a business man who seems to work out of one of the bathrooms in the school to disrupt the school in any way possible, such as selling test answers and other services that clearly violate school policy. He rigs the auditions for the school prom, and they enact his plan, winning the audition in the absence of Vadar. Thinking they're on drugs, Vadar institutes drug tests which provides no solution to dealing with the Eradicators. However, they are set up by Vadar, Whitney and Marget and made unable to participate through vandalism of school property (and planting Evidence in the lockers of the four). Vowing to get even, they go to even greater lengths than before to get vengeance, and use video cameras this time around, taping numerous embarrassing situations, such as Bob and Margaret cheating on Whitney and Donovan, Whitney projectile vomiting on a teacher, Donovan posing with women's underwear, and Vadar having an intimate moment with a submissive slave in her office. They also trick the band Zillion Kisses, getting them to set up and wait in the school's storage room during the prom. The Eradicators meanwhile make their appearance at the prom. Upon the appearance of the Yupettes, the Eradicators begin playing the video tapes that they've managed to record over the previous week. Severely embarrassing (and causing infighting among the Yupettes) the Yupettes and Vadar, the situation causes Vadar to go on a homicidal rampage. Driving her car through the school grounds, she has no regard for the safety of anyone on the school grounds. During the aftermath, she tries to kill The Eradicators, as well as Eaglebauer, and even substitute teacher Rita. Not so easily defeated, however, the Eradicators continue to fight back even against the vehicular attempt at manslaughter, and slick a section of the school with chemical extinguishers, which cause Vadar to crash into the school, causing it to explode, and the school catches fire for the second time in 12 years. During the final sequence, when everyone is witnessing the destruction of the school something emerges from the fire, which quickly turns out to be a flaming tire (which no one attempts to stop, and continues rolling even after the credits finish rolling). ==Cast== * Corey Feldman: Jesse Davis, a troublesome teenager and the frontman of the Eradicators.

She was the daughter of the eventual usurper Wang Mang, who established the Xin Dynasty. Her husband was Emperor Ping. She is largely viewed by historians as a tragic figure, the victim of circumstances who tried to remain loyal to her husband of only a few years, but whose faithfulness to her husband's dynasty eventually led her to commit suicide at the end of her father's reign. == Family background == Empress Wang was born in 8 BC, to Wang Mang and his wife Lady Wang, the daughter of Wang Xian (王咸) the Marquess of Yichun. By the time of her birth, her father had resigned from his powerful position as commander of the armed forces, which he held under his cousin Emperor Cheng and briefly under Emperor Cheng's successor and nephew Emperor Ai. Her father was hated by Emperor Ai's grandmother Grand Empress Dowager Fu. However, in 1 BC, after Emperor Ai's death, Wang Mang's aunt Grand Empress Dowager Wang seized power back from Emperor Ai's male favourite (and probable lover) Dong Xian and recalled Wang Mang to serve as regent to her step-grandson, the young Emperor Ping. == Marriage == Once Wang Mang became regent, he built a personality cult around himself and became very popular. In 2 AD, Wang Mang decided to cement his position by having his daughter married to Emperor Ping. He declared, in accordance with ancient customs, that Emperor Ping would have one wife and 11 concubines, and started a selection process by identifying eligible noble young ladies. He disingenuously petitioned Grand Empress Dowager Wang that his daughter not be considered, and then started a petition apparently driven by the people to have his daughter selected as empress. The petitioners stormed the palace, and Grand Empress Dowager Wang, overwhelmed by the display of affection for Wang Mang, ordered that Wang Mang's daughter be made empress. In 4 AD, Emperor Ping officially married her and made her empress. == Young widowhood and temporary status as empress dowager == By circa 5 AD, Emperor Ping appeared to have grown out of a heart condition that he had suffered from, and it became plain that he resented Wang Mang for slaughtering his uncles in 3 AD and not allowing his mother to visit him in the capital, Chang'an. Wang Mang therefore resolved to murder the emperor. In the winter of 5 AD, Wang Mang gave pepper wine (considered in those days to be capable of chasing away evil spirits) to the 14-year-old emperor, but had the wine spiked with poison. As the emperor was suffering the effects of the poison, Wang Mang wrote a secret petition to the gods, in which he offered to substitute his life for Emperor Ping's, and then had the petition locked away. Historians generally believe that Wang Mang had two motives in doing this—to absolve himself of involvement in the poisoning if Emperor Ping recovered from the poisoning, and to leave evidence of his faithfulness for posterity. After a few days of suffering, Emperor Ping died making Empress Wang a widow at the age of 13. After Emperor Ping's death, Wang Mang assumed the unprecedented title of acting emperor (假皇帝). In 6 AD, Wang Mang selected Emperor Ping's cousin-once-removed (a great-great-grandson of Emperor Xuan), the one-year-old Liu Ying as the next emperor (to be known as Emperor Ruzi). However, using Emperor Ruzi's young age as a pretext, Wang Mang retained his role as acting emperor, while Liu Ying was given the title crown prince. Empress Wang was given the title empress dowager. Wang Mang promised at the time that he would return the throne to Emperor Ruzi as soon as he was old enough, but in 8 AD, Wang Mang seized the throne and established the Xin Dynasty. In 9 AD, the toddler Emperor Ruzi was created the Duke of Ding'an (定安公), and Empress Dowager Wang was given the title of Duchess Dowager of Ding'an. == Life during Xin Dynasty == Traditional historical accounts describe Empress Wang as an unhappy widow during her father's reign, still retaining her loyalty to the overthrown Han Dynasty. She often claimed to be ill and refused to attend imperial gatherings. Wang Mang, believing that he could solve her unhappiness by having her remarry, changed her title from Duchess Dowager of Ding'an to Princess Huanghuang in 10 AD, terminating her formal linkage with the Han Dynasty. He also intended to marry her to the son of one of his important officials, Sun Jian (孫建). He instructed Sun Jian's son to dress himself well and accompany physicians to go visit Princess Huanghuang. She was greatly offended and would not receive any guests afterwards. Also in 10 AD, another potential suitor for Princess Huanghuang would get himself in trouble for the way that he tried to marry her. Zhen Xun (甄尋), the mayor of Chang'an and the son of Wang Mang's trusted ally and friend Zhen Feng (甄豐), had designs on both greater power and Princess Huanghuang. Because Wang Mang relied on spreading false prophecies to the people to persuade them that he was entitled to be the emperor, Zhen Feng took the chance to create some false prophecies of his own. His first attempt was a prophecy that indicated that the empire should be divided into two parts, each with a viceroy—with the western empire having his father Zhen Feng as viceroy, and the eastern empire having another important official Ping Yan (平晏) as viceroy. Wang Mang, although displeased, decided to go along with this prophecy, and in fact commissioned Zhen Feng and Ping as viceroys. Having seen the positive effect of his first false prophecy, Zhen Xun created a second false prophecy—that Princess Huanghuang should be married to him. Wang Mang decided to take this chance to suppress all prophecies that did not come from him, and ordered that Zhen Xun be arrested. Zhen Feng committed suicide, while Zhen Xun fled. In 11 AD, he was finally arrested and exiled to Sanwei (三危, in modern Jiuquan, Gansu). == Death == There are no further known historical records about Princess Huanghuang until 23 AD. At that time, her father's Xin Dynasty was in a shambles, with various rebellions rising against him. One of the strongest rebel forces, under Liu Xuan, a distant descendant of the Han Dynasty imperial house, having entered the capital, Chang'an, the people of Chang'an rose against Wang Mang as well. They set fire to the main imperial palace, Weiyang Palace, and the fire quickly spread to the part of the palace where Princess Huanghuang lived. She sighed and said, \\"How can I again face my Han relations?\\" She then threw herself into the fire and died. Her father was killed shortly afterwards. ==Inclusion in the Lienü zhuan== Her biography was added to the Lienü zhuan (Biographies of Exemplary Women), which was first started by the Han dynasty scholar Liu Xiang. Empress Wang's biography is part of Scroll 9, titled Supplemental Biographies (新刊續列女傳). ==Ancestry== == References == * Book of Han, vols. 97, Part 2, 99, Parts 1, 2, 3. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 35, 36, 37, 39. - Category:Han dynasty empresses Category:Ancient Chinese princesses Category:8 BC births Category:23 deaths Category:1st-century BC Chinese women Category:1st-century Chinese women Category:Chinese royalty who committed suicide ","title":"Empress Wang (Ping)"},{"id":"2565863","text":"Ruben Bertrand Boumtje-Boumtje (born May 20, 1978) is a Cameroonian professional basketball executive and former player who is the assistant general manager of the Delaware Blue Coats of the NBA G League.

The program maintains a infotainment format, incorporating national, international and business news headlines; feature reports; interviews; national weather forecasts; sports highlights; and commentary. CBS has carried an overnight news block since 1982; it was known as CBS News Nightwatch until 1992 and then Up to the Minute until September 18, 2015. CBS Overnight News draws from the full resources of CBS News, including the CBS Evening News, CBS This Morning, Newspath, owned-and-operated station and network affiliate of the television network and Associated Press Television News. It also featured rebroadcasts of selected stories from CBS News Sunday Morning, 48 Hours, 60 Minutes and Face the Nation. ==Overview== CBS Overnight News broadcasts beginning at 2:00am ET and is transmitted in a continuous one-hour tape- delayed loop until 8:00am ET when the CBS Morning News – the network's early- morning news program – begins in certain areas of the Pacific Time Zone. Most CBS stations air the CBS Morning News at 4:00 a.m. local time or earlier, depending on the start time of the station's local breakfast television). Most of the network's stations do not air the program's entire broadcast loop and preempt portions of it in order to air local programming (usually infomercial or broadcast syndication) – joining the program in progress anywhere from five minutes to as much as 1½ hours after the start of the program – with affiliates looping the show until the CBS Morning News begins. Some stations and affiliates, including CBS Television Stations, carry a rebroadcast of the CBS Evening News in the first half-hour they air or leading into their morning newscasts (except Sunday into Monday morning, when the Sunday edition of the CBS Weekend News is substituted). This scheduling began during the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, due to the CBS Broadcast Center's circumstances at the time where all personnel was working remotely and the building was dark for deep disinfection, requiring the Morning News to go on a hiatus which has continued on into the summer. Its main competitor is ABC's World News Now, which follows a more irreverent format than the more straightforward news style of CBS (NBC has not aired a late-night newscast since the cancellation of NBC Nightside in 1998, and instead has most of its stations airing paid programming before leading into Early Today). ==History== Former \\"Up to the Minute\\" title card. The program's history traces back to the launch of the network's first overnight news program, CBS News Nightwatch, which premiered on October 3, 1982; that program was originally anchored by Christopher Glenn, Harold Dow, Felicia Jeter and Karen Stone, who were later joined by Mary Jo West. In 1984, production of Nightwatch moved from New York City to Washington, D.C., at which time Charlie Rose (who later returned to CBS News as co-anchor of CBS This Morning) and Lark McCarthy became the program's anchors. Nightwatch's format was a hybrid of a traditional newscast and an interview and debate show. ===Up to the Minute=== CBS announced its decision to cancel Nightwatch in early 1992. Around this time, ABC and NBC were setting up their own late-night newscast programs (World News Now and NBC Nightside, respectively; only World News Now is still on the air) and replaced it with a more traditional news program in the same vein as the other two, titled Up to the Minute, on March 30, 1992. The program was originally anchored by Russ Mitchell and Monica Gayle, who both left the program in 1993 (Gayle subsequently became co-anchor of the CBS Morning News), and were replaced by Troy Roberts, at which point the program switched to the single-anchor format which it used for the rest of its run. Regular on-air contributors to Up to the Minute included John Quain, who served as the program's technology consultant beginning in 1998. The program's on-air graphics package and set were often several years behind that of CBS News's daytime broadcasts, with the news division's early-1990s era graphics package being used on the program well past 2000. These graphics were updated in 2005, 2006, 2009, and then again in 2011 to match the current look of the CBS Evening News. In March 2009, when Michelle Gielan was named anchor of Up to the Minute, production of the program was integrated with the CBS Morning News, with the same anchors being used on both programs. In November 2012, Up to the Minute became the last remaining news program on any of the Big Three television networks or major cable news channels to begin broadcasting in high-definition television; at that time, production of the program was moved to Studio 57 at the CBS Broadcast Center, the same studio space that is also home to CBS This Morning. Until then, Up to the Minute had continued to broadcast in standard-definition television (by comparison, the CBS Morning News had upgraded to HD two years earlier in November 2010). ===Rebrand as CBS Overnight News=== On June 25, 2015, Newsday reported that CBS News had decided to cancel Up to the Minute but planned on retaining the 3 a.m. time slot for news programming. Up to the Minute ended its run after 23 years on September 18, 2015. The program was replaced three days later on September 21 by the CBS Overnight News, a rebranding made primarily to be consistent with the rest of CBS News productions; in terms of content, the show is largely unchanged from its predecessor. The primary change is that there is no live anchor. Instead, the regular anchor from the previous day's CBS Weekend News (Elaine Quijano, on Sunday night into Monday morning) and CBS Evening News (Norah O'Donnell for the remainder of the week) \\"hosts\\" the program along with various fill-in CBS News correspondents via introducing stories rebroadcast from the West Coast final edition of the Evening News and additional content. The CBS Evening News branding remains on the story packages. The Overnight News room is staffed to accommodate breaking news at all times. ==Anchors== * Russ Mitchell (1992–1993; now with WKYC in Cleveland) * Monica Gayle (1992–1993; now with WJBK in Detroit) * Troy Roberts (1993–1995; now a correspondent for 48 Hours) * Sharyl Attkisson (1993–1995; now with WSYX in Columbus, Ohio and special correspondent for Sinclair Broadcast Group) * Nanette Hansen (1995–1998) * Mika Brzezinski (1998–2000; now with MSNBC) * Melissa McDermott (2000 – March 10, 2006) * Meg Oliver (March 20, 2006 – March 20, 2009) * Michelle Gielan (March 23, 2009 – June 18, 2010) * Betty Nguyen (June 21, 2010 – April 6, 2012; now with NBC News) * Terrell Brown (April 9, 2012 – January 18, 2013; now with WLS-TV in Chicago) * Anne-Marie Green (January 21, 2013 – September 18, 2015) * Jeff Glor (September 21, 2015 – May 2, 2016; December 5, 2017 – May 10, 2019) * Scott Pelley (September 22, 2015 – June 16, 2017) * Elaine Quijano (May 9, 2016 – present) * Anthony Mason (June 20, 2017 – December 1, 2017) * Norah O'Donnell (July 16, 2019 – present) ==References== ==External links== * Category:CBS original programming Category:1992 American television series debuts Category:1990s American late-night television series Category:2000s American late-night television series Category:2010s American late-night television series Category:2020s American late-night television series Category:1990s American television news shows Category:2000s American television news shows Category:2010s American television news shows Category:2020s American television news shows Category:CBS News Category:English-language television shows ","title":"CBS Overnight News"},{"id":"2565887","text":"Cherry Tree railway station serves Cherry Tree, a suburb of Blackburn, England.

And in July 1960, the ELF was openly established in Cairo by Idris Muhammad Adam and other Eritrean intellectuals and students. In 1961 Hamid Idris Awate formed the armed wing of the ELF and declared the armed struggle for independence. Led by Awate, the ELF came into violent conflict with the government on September 1, 1961, using guerrilla war tactics to continue the struggle. Though the movement posed great problems for the Ethiopian government and army, it was also facing internal political conflicts in the very late 1960s. In the 1970s, a group of its members split the movement and formed the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, a more left-wing rebel movement. By the 1980s, the People's Liberation Front had replaced the original Eritrean Liberation Front as the main rebel group. Following the expulsion of the ELF from Eritrean land, the organization split into three groups: the Eritrean liberation front-Revolutionary Council, led by Ahmed Nasser, the Eritrean liberation front-Central Leadership, which eventually united in 1987 with the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, and the remaining faction led by Abdalla Idriss retained the original name. When Eritrea did gain independence in the early 1990s, the People's Liberation Front changed into the People's Front for Democracy and Justice with the addition of former ELF members while the balance became a small rebel group in the nether reaches of the Sudan. ==Current status== The contemporary ELF is a member of the umbrella opposition alliance in Eritrea, the Eritrean National Alliance. They are apparently now receiving military support from Ethiopia and from the interim government of Somalia based at Baidoa. ==Groups that are splinters of the ELF== The Eritrean Liberation Front-Popular liberation forces was organized around Osman Saleh Sabbe, Romedan Mohammed Nur and Isaias Afewerki. Another split affected within the organization with the emergence of Eritrean People's Liberation Front in 1970. The 1982 Rasai Incident led to a split between the Abdellah Idris faction and Ahmed Mohammed Nasser's Eritrean Liberation Front-Revolutionnary Council. Ahmed's group was then affected by another split with the creation of Eritrean Liberation Front-Central Leadership around Ibrahim Toteel and Zemheret Yohannes. ==Organizations affiliated with the Eritrean Liberation Front== * General Union of Eritrean Students * General Union of Eritrean Workers * General Union of Eritrean Women * General Union of Eritrean Peasants * Eritrean Red Cross and Red Crescent Society ==References== ==External links== *List of incidents attributed to the Eritrean Liberation Front on the START database Category:Eritrean nationalism Category:Eritrean War of Independence Category:Factions of the Ethiopian Civil War Category:Guerrilla organizations Category:National liberation movements in Africa Category:Rebel groups in Eritrea Category:Rebel groups in Ethiopia Category:Organizations established in 1960 ","title":"Eritrean Liberation Front"},{"id":"2565958","text":"Thomas Martin SpurgeonSpurgeon, Thomas. \\"Mickey Mouse.\\" World Book Advanced, World Book, 2018 (December 16, 1968 – November 13, 2019) was an American writer, historian, critic, and editor in the field of comics, notable for his five-year run as editor of The Comics Journal and his blog The Comics Reporter. ==Early life== Spurgeon was born December 16, 1968, in Muncie, Indiana. He was one of three sons of Sandra \\"Sunny\\" McFarren and Wiley W. Spurgeon, Jr. His mother was a senior manager in the health care industry, and his father was the executive editor of the sister newspapers The Muncie Star and The Muncie Evening Press, a role that included curating the newspapers' comics pages. Spurgeon was his class president in high school, and attended college at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, where he was a lineman on the football team, and graduated with a BA in History and Politics in 1991. He spent the next two years in Evanston, Illinois, studying at the Garrett–Evangelical Theological Seminary before leaving in 1993. ==Career== Spurgeon was the managing editor, and later executive editor, of The Comics Journal, a comics trade magazine and critical journal published by Fantagraphics, from 1994–1999. Under his tenure, the magazine expanded the scope of its coverage to more regularly include European comics, introducing an English-language readership to the new wave of publishing from France led by the group of cartoonists centered around L'Association. As well, Spurgeon's Journal was notable for the coverage it gave to burgeoning scenes of American comics makers like the Fort Thunder collective. After leaving The Comics Journal, Spurgeon wrote the comic strip Wildwood with his childhood friend Dan Wright. The strip, initially launched as Bobo's Progress, was syndicated by King Features from 1999 to 2002 and ran in about 80 newspapers. March 24, 2009. March 24, 2009. March 24, 2009. March 24, 2009.

In 2011, he underwent emergency surgery that placed The Comics Reporter website on hiatus. He wrote an essay about the experience. A year later, he posted a second essay detailing his change in perspective, lifestyle modifications, and significant weight loss following his surgery. In it, he explains, \\"I wasn't sick because I was overweight.

Owned by Broadcast Educational Communications, the station acts as a full-time simulcast of Murrysville station WKGO (88.1 FM). The KQV studios and transmitter are located in North Versailles Township. Historically, KQV is recognized as one of the oldest radio stations in the United States, and among the oldest surviving radio stations in North America. Due to a complicated early history, the exact date of its founding has been variously stated as either November 19, 1919 (as an experimental station), in the fall of 1921, or on January 9, 1922, the latter officially recognized by the FCC. KQV is also perhaps best recognized for two distinct eras: as a top 40 station from 1958 to 1975, the majority of that time owned by the American Broadcasting Company, and as an all-news radio station from 1975 until the station suspended operations on December 31, 2017. ==History== ===Experimental broadcasts=== February 15, 1920 Doubleday-Hill advertisement for radio receiver sets.Doubleday-Hill Advertisement, Pittsburgh Gazette Times, February 15, 1920, Second section, page 4. The FCC has traditionally listed KQV's establishment date as January 9, 1922.\\"Date First Licensed\\", FCC History Cards for KQV, card #1. However, station management has generally traced its history to experimental broadcasts beginning on November 19, 1919, although documentation for this earlier period is limited. In addition, station co- founder F. C. Potts maintained that the station should be considered to be founded in late 1921, when the first license with the KQV call sign was issued. KQV's original owner was the Doubleday-Hill Electric Company, located at 719-721 Liberty Street in Pittsburgh. Doubleday-Hill was a well established seller of electrical equipment, whose offerings included radio equipment (then also called \\"wireless\\"). ===Applying for an amateur license=== During World War I, the U.S. government had prohibited the operation of radio transmitters by civilians, and the ban wasn't lifted until October 1, 1919. Shortly thereafter, Doubleday-Hill's radio department manager, Florenz C. Potts, announced that the company was in the process of installing a De Forest radiotelephone transmitter, to be used for communication with a second station to be located at the company's branch store in Washington, D.C.\\"Telephone Downtown Soon\\", \\"The Radio Amateur\\" by C. E. Urban, Pittsburgh Gazette Times, October 26, 1919, Sixth section, page 13. A month later, in late November, Potts reported that the company had been unable to obtain the commercial license needed to operate the business plan. However, \\"a special amateur license has been applied for, to cover the wireless telephone demonstration station which the company has ordered installed and which is expected to be opened in the near future.\\"\\"Local Commercial Station Delayed\\", \\"The Radio Amateur\\" by C. E. Urban, Pittsburgh Gazette Times, November 23, 1919, Sixth section, page 2. In late January 1920, it was announced that \\"The latest type of radiophone, developed and produced in the laboratory of Dr. Lee de Forest at New York, has just been installed in the downtown store of the Doubleday- Hill Electric Company. Arrangements have been made by this company with a local music store to furnish the latest phonograph records weekly for use in connection with wireless concerts to be given on a regular schedule. This schedule has not been definitely fixed, but will be announced in a short time. The fact that different records will be played for each concert should add greatly to the enjoyment derived therefrom by the radio amateurs of this locality. The phone will also be used by this company to announced new development in radio and other items of general interest to wireless amateurs.\\"\\"Wireless Phone Installed by Local Firm\\", \\"The Radio Amateur\\" by C. E. Urban, Pittsburgh Gazette Times, January 25, 1920, Fifth section, page 9. ===Airing phonograph records=== A week later, it was reported that \\"On last Tuesday evening (January 27, 1920), the Doubleday-Hill Electric Company made a preliminary test of their new radiophone equipment, by rendering a short concert of about 15 selections, including many popular numbers, as well as operatic and classical pieces.\\"\\"Preliminary Test of Radiophone\\", \\"The Radio Amateur\\" by C. E. Urban, Pittsburgh Gazette Times, February 1, 1920, Second section, page 2.

Urban, Pittsburgh Gazette Times, February 15, 1920, Second section, page 4. \\"Messrs. Williams and Devinney\\" were Burton P. Williams and Robert C. Devinney. A February 29 report further stated that \\"On Sunday evening, February 22, and Tuesday evening, February 24, wireless concerts were given by Doubleday-Hill Electric Company, using the DeForest radiophone, which was operated by Messrs. Williams and Devinney at the station of B. P. Williams, Orleans street, North Side. Reports were received from Washington, Vandergrift and other outlying towns that the music was being heard clearly, Mr. Williams states. A few days prior to this a test was made by these radio men for the Doubleday-Hill company, transmitting the voice and music to a station in Butler, Pa., very successfully.\\"\\"The Radio Amateur\\" by C. E. Urban, Pittsburgh Gazette Times, February 29, 1920, Sixth section, page 10. ===Early call sign 8ZAE=== KQV employees have generally traced the station's history back to Doubleday-Hill's initial 1919 activities, and a September 1934 newspaper article reported that the staff was in the process of preparing a celebration of the station's fifteenth birthday.\\"Operator Who Established KQV Calls It Second Oldest Station\\" by S. H. Steinhauser, Pittsburgh Press, September 19, 1934, page 27. (Many later recountings give a specific debut date of November 19, 1919.)\\"KQV Just Keeps on Groovin'\\" by John Mehno, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, August 8, 1999. Most accounts of Doubleday-Hill's earliest activities say that the initial broadcasts were transmitted using a Special Amateur station authorization, 8ZAE, issued to Burton P. Williams, a company employee living in Pittsburgh. (Contemporary information about licensed stations suggests that 8ZAE didn't receive its first license until late 1921,\\"New Stations: Special Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 4. The \\"8\\" in 8ZAE's call sign specified that the station was located in the 8th Radio Inspection District, while the \\"Z\\" indicated that it was operating under a \\"Special Amateur\\" license. Special Amateur stations were permitted to transmit on wavelengths in addition to the congested 200 meter (1500 kHz) wavelength used by standard amateur stations. although it also reports that Williams previously held a license for a standard amateur station, 8EN.)\\"Eighth District: by Owner, Amateur Radio Stations of the United States, Edition June 30, 1920, page 90. In late 1920, the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company in East Pittsburgh launched an ambitious broadcasting service, and its efforts soon overshadowed Doubleday-Hill's earlier broadcasts. Westinghouse's first station debuted on November 2, 1920, as 8ZZ, soon becoming KDKA. In 1946, a KDKA promotional pamphlet claimed that it had conducted \\"the world's first regularly scheduled broadcast.\\"\\"Going Forward with Radio\\" as presented by KDKA (promotional pamphlet), 1946, page 3. (americanradiohistory.com) KQV, and a number of other stations, such as WWJ Detroit and KCBS San Francisco, countered that they had broadcasting histories that predated KDKA. Based on their heritages, both KQV and KDKA have claimed to being the oldest broadcasting station in Pennsylvania. (A local Westinghouse engineer, Frank Conrad in nearby Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, preceded both efforts, conducting a series of semi-regular entertainment broadcasts at his experimental station, 8XK, from his home's garage. They began on October 17, 1919. He suspended his broadcasts shortly after KDKA debuted.) ===Becoming KQV=== In September 1921, it was announced that Doubleday-Hill was planning to install a high-powered station, which again was planned to be used primarily for two-way communication with a second proposed station located at its Washington, D.C. store. In addition, it was stated that the new station would \\"be used to give entertaining programs for amateur reception on certain evenings of each week\\".\\"The Radio Amateur\\" by C. E. Urban, Pittsburgh Gazette Times, September 11, 1921, Sixth section, page 7. In October 1921 this new station was issued a Limited Commercial license, transmitting on 200 and 425 meters (1500 and 706 kHz), with the call letters KQV.\\"New Stations: Commercial Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, November 1, 1921, page 2. KQV's call sign was randomly assigned, by later tradition it was said to stand for \\"King of the Quaker Valley,\\" although from 1925 to 1931 the station's slogan was \\"The Smoky City Station.\\"Radio Station Treasury by Tom Kneitel, 1986, page 16. KQV's initial license in the fall of 1921 was the first one issued in the name of Doubleday- Hill, and the first to receive the KQV call letters. Moreover, in the same September 1934 newspaper article in which the KQV staff dated the station's founding to the predecessor 1919 activities, F. C. Potts was quoted as stating that in his opinion KQV's founding shouldn't be considered to have occurred until two years later, when the first KQV license was issued, endorsing an earlier slogan that the station was \\"On the Air since 1921.\\" ===Unusual call sign=== Beginning in 1912 the normal practice had been to issue call letters starting with \\"K\\" only to land stations located in the western United States, and it is unclear why KQV was not assigned a call sign starting with \\"W,\\" which was the standard practice for stations located in the east. For most of the early decades of radio, KQV, KDKA, KFIZ in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, and KYW, first in Chicago and now in Philadelphia, have been the only stations, still broadcasting to this day, with K call signs in eastern states. (In recent years, a handful of other K call signs have gone on the air in the east. Most are non-commercial FM stations whose construction permits were granted in the west but later were relocated to the east.) ===KQV's early years=== August 6, 1922 Doubleday-Hill advertisement, now promoting \\"Broadcasting Station KQV\\".Doubleday-Hill Advertisement, Pittsburgh Press, August 6, 1922, Second section, page 5. From 1912 to 1927, the Department of Commerce regulated U.S. radio, and initially there were no specific restrictions on stations wanting to engage in broadcasting entertainment to the general public. The first formal standards were adopted effective December 1, 1921, which specified that broadcasting stations had to hold a \\"Limited Commercial License\\" that also authorized operation on the \\"entertainment\\" wavelength of 360 meters (833 kHz) or the \\"market and weather reports\\" wavelength of 485 meters (619 kHz). \\"Amendments to Regulations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 10. At the time this regulation was adopted, a small number of stations already met the new requirements. This did not include KQV, which although it held a Limited Commercial License, wasn't authorized to transmit on either of the broadcasting wavelengths. On January 9, 1922, Doubleday-Hill was issued a new Limited Commercial License for KQV, which now included an authorization to transmit on the 360 meter entertainment wavelength.Limited Commercial license, serial #452, issued to the Doubleday- Hill Electric Company on January 9, 1922 for a 6 month period. For this reason FCC records generally list January 9, 1922 as KQV's \\"Date First Licensed\\". KQV's original studio and transmitter were located on the ninth floor of the Doubleday-Hill building, with a transmitting antenna that stretched across the street. G. Brown Hill, a company vice president, was initially responsible for the station's development. At its start, its primary purpose was to promote the sale of radio receivers, and KQV remained commercial-free until 1925. On November 11, 1928, a major reallocation resulting from the Federal Radio Commission's General Order 40 assigned KQV to a \\"regional\\" frequency, 1380 kHz. In 1932 the station was sold to H. J. Brennan, and the studios moved to the Chamber of Commerce building.\\"National Radio Week Includes Birthdays of Pioneers Here\\" by Si Steinhauser, Pittsburgh Press, November 4, 1945, page 32. On March 29, 1941, under the provisions of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, all the stations on 1380 kHz were shifted to 1410 kHz, which has been KQV's dial position ever since. In 1944, the station was sold to Allegheny Broadcasting. The sale was necessary because both KQV and WJAS were under common ownership, and the FCC no longer permitted multiple AM station ownership within a community. A 1947 station advertisement, promoting its power increase to 5,000 watts, described KQV as \\"Pittsburgh's Aggressive Station\\".KQV Advertisement, Broadcasting Yearbook, 1947, page 172. ===\\"The Groovy QV\\"=== In 1957, the station was once again sold, this time to American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, then the corporate parent of ABC Radio.\\"KQV History\\" by Frank Gottlieb During the late 1950s, 1960s and 1970s KQV was quite successful as a Top 40 station, with Count John K. Chapel a popular radio personality during most of this period. Known over the years as \\"Colorful KQV,\\" \\"Audio 14,\\" \\"Groovy QV,\\" and \\"The Big 14,\\" KQV debuted its Top 40 format on January 13, 1958, and is remembered for its high-profile, high- energy personalities, such as Robert Wolfson a.k.a. Bob Wilson,Bob Wilson (Jeff Roteman's KQV Personalities Page) Chuck Brinkman, Hal Murray, Dave Scott, Steve Rizen, Dex Allen, Jim Quinn, future game show announcer Rod Roddy, and their large-scale promotion of a Beatles concert at Pittsburgh's Civic Arena in 1964. During this time, KQV broadcast from its showcase studios on the ground floor of the Chamber of Commerce Building (\\"on the corner of Walk and Don't Walk,\\" as the DJs would say) in downtown Pittsburgh, where the disk jockeys could be watched through a large window. The station was dominant among young listeners throughout the 1960s, and was a major force introducing Pittsburgh to new music and artists such as Sonny & Cher, the Rolling Stones, the Supremes, the Beach Boys, the Dave Clark Five and others. KQV ratings began to slowly decline after 1970, with the advent of competition from WJAS and the rise of FM radio (including its then-sister station 102.5 WDVE, which had begun operation in 1948 as KQV-FM). One of KQV's Top 40 personalities in the 1970s, with the on-air name of \\"Jeff Christie,\\" later became famous as a talk show host under his real name, Rush Limbaugh.\\"Rush Limbaugh - 1974 Aircheck (KQV)\\" (youtube.com) In 1974, another upstart competitor — AM station \\"13Q\\" WKTQ, the former (and current) WJAS — also made serious inroads competing against KQV, which briefly turned to the \\"14K\\" brand. At the end of the year, ABC Radio sold both KQV and WDVE to Cincinnati-based Taft Broadcasting.\\"Taft in, ABC out of Pittsburgh radio.\\" Broadcasting, April 1, 1974, pg. 22. (americanradiohistory.com) Taft made another attempt at Top 40 on KQV, this time with a far more radical presentation, with Joey Reynolds as program director, before dropping the format altogether. Its final night as a Top 40 station was October 14, 1975, with Neil Diamond's \\"Brother Love's Travelling Salvation Show\\" played as the final song. ===\\"All-News, All the Time\\"=== The next morning, October 15, 1975, KQV switched to an all-news format, carrying NBC Radio's 24-hour News and Information Service.\\"NIS count up to 50.\\" Broadcasting, September 29, 1975, pg. 46. (americanradiohistory.com) Even though NBC cancelled this service two years later, KQV continued as an all-news station using local anchors and reporters. In 1982, Taft executives told KQV's general manager, Robert W. Dickey, Sr. (no relation to the Dickey family that founded the Cumulus Media conglomerate), that it intended to sell the station. Hoping to avoid a potential format change that often results from an ownership shift, Dickey decided to make a bid to buy the station. He received financial backing from newspaper publisher Richard Mellon Scaife and together they formed Calvary, Inc., purchasing the station from Taft that same year.\\"Changing hands.\\" Broadcasting, April 12, 1982, pg. 98. (americanradiohistory.com) KQV was the sole radio station owned by Calvary. Former station logo KQV remained an all-news station from 1975 until its sign-off at the end of 2017. After the end of the NBC News and Information Service in 1977, it affiliated with CBS Radio News and later with ABC News Radio. For a time, it used the audio from CNN Headline News late nights and weekends, and later aired some syndicated talk shows nights and weekends. Steve Lohle was a fixture as KQV's afternoon news anchor for 34 years, until his death on June 20, 2008 of an apparent heart attack. Retired weekend anchor Bob Sprague also died of an apparent heart attack, in July 2010. He had anchored weekends for more than 25 years until his retirement. Robert W. Dickey, Sr. died on December 24, 2011.\\"KQV patriarch Robert W. Dickey Sr. was dedicated to news\\", by Jason Cato, December 25, 2011. His estate remained a partner in the station's ownership, with Robert W. Dickey, Jr. succeeding his father as general manager. On May 14, 2013, it was announced that Richard Mellon Scaife was selling his shares in KQV to the Dickey family, giving the Dickeys full ownership. Scaife died a year later.

The loss of these KQV executives took a toll on the station remaining financially viable. ===2017 suspension of broadcasting=== On December 15, 2017, Robert Dickey, Jr. announced that KQV would suspend broadcasting on December 31, 2017. In a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette interview Dickey cited his sister's death as the primary reason for the pending shutdown, also noting that all-news radio was becoming too expensive to support in an industry where advertising revenues were declining. He also stated that he did not want to change KQV's format because all-news was the only one he knew or wanted to air on the station. No on-air mentions of KQV's suspension were planned until its sign-off day, although in the interim he remained open to offers to buy the station.KQV Pittsburgh To Sign-Off December 31 - RadioInsight (published December 15, 2017)KQV going off the air at end of the year - Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (published December 15, 2017) At the time of this announcement, KQV was broadcasting the all-news format, first adopted in 1975, each weekday, consisting of news, sports, traffic, business reports and weather, from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. The programming was similar to that of other traditional all-news stations, featuring \\"Traffic and Weather on the Eights,\\" sports at :15 and :45 past each hour, and business news at :20 and :50 past. Primary weekday anchors were P.J. Maloney, Joe Fenn, Bruce Sakalik, and Dan Weinberg. In 2011, the station had re-affiliated with ABC News Radio for the first time since its days as an ABC Radio owned-and-operated station, carrying its top-of-the-hour newscasts. During evenings, the station broadcast syndicated conservative talk radio host Lars Larson, When Radio Was (a series featuring classic radio programs such as Suspense and The Jack Benny Show) and Red Eye Radio from Westwood One. A weekly radio series, known as \\"Imagination Theater\\", was broadcast on Sundays. The station also carried public affairs programs such as Pittsburgh Profiles and Pittsburgh Global Press Conference, in addition to live sporting events, including NFL football, Penn State University football, and WPIAL football and basketball, as well as the Triple Crown and Masters updates. KQV suspended operations on December 31, 2017.KQV- AM (FCC Facility #8445) Notification of Suspension of Operations on 12/31/2017 and Request for Silent STA (Retrieved from FCC.gov on 10 January 2018).

Since 1993, the main studio had been located in Pittsburgh's Centre City Tower. ===Return=== Because the owners did not turn in KQV's license for cancellation, the station was permitted to resume operations by Calvary or a new owner. However, station licenses are subject to automatic cancellation pursuant to the Telecommunications Act of 1996 if a station remains off-the- air continuously for one calendar year, although any resumption of broadcasting, even temporarily for a single day, resets the start of the one- year deadline period. Even though Dickey did not actively solicit buyers, press reports of the station's situation drew a number of interested potential buyers, although the Ross Township transmitter site and tower were not included because the land on which KQV's towers had been located was slated for sale as developmental real estate. Longtime Pittsburgh broadcaster Chris Lash gave serious consideration to buying KQV before deciding instead to invest in a station near Buffalo, New York, in a similar situation, WSPQ.WSPQ eyeing March comeback. Springville Journal. Retrieved February 16, 2018. On January 30, 2018, Calvary sold KQV's license and equipment for $55,000 to Broadcast Communications Inc., headed by Robert and Ashley Stevens, owners of Pittsburgh-area stations WKVE, WKFB, WKHB, WKHB-FM, WEDO, and WANB. The Stevens' plan included resuming KQV's broadcasts from WEDO's transmitter site in North Versailles, Pennsylvania. The agreement also included a stipulation that one of the parties was to file for a FM translator. Calvary applied on January 31, but the application was dismissed due to missing paperwork. On February 5, Broadcast Communications applied for permission to make the transmitter move to WEDO's existing transmitter site. Broadcast Communications' acquisition of the station was consummated on May 19, 2018. A second application was later filed to assign the station to a nonprofit subsidiary, Broadcast Educational Communications, Inc., which would modify KQV's license to non-commercial status. That transaction was consummated on September 24, 2018.

The station held a remain- silent Special Temporary Authority (STA) while it awaited the necessary equipment for the WEDO diplex. The station again temporarily signed on in January 2019. A Special Temporary Authority request filed in October of that year listed a scheduled permanent return date of November 2019.\\"Another Day Full of STAs ...

This was increased in 1795–96 to 130 guns by closing in the spar deck between the quarterdeck and forecastle, and around 1802 to 140 guns, thus creating what was in effect a continuous fourth gundeck although the extra guns added were actually relatively small. She was the heaviest-armed ship in the world when rebuilt, and bore the most guns of any ship of the line outfitted in the Age of Sail. ==Design and construction== She was built at Havana, Cuba, to a design by Irish naval architect Matthew Mullan (domiciled in Spain under the name Mateo Mullán) and launched in 1769 as a 112-gun three-decker Gervasio de Artinano y de Galdacano, La Arquitectura Naval Espanola (en Madera) (Madrid 1920), p.365 (some sources say 116 or even 120 guns). She was considerably larger than her British contemporary Victory and somewhat bigger than the French Bretagne. There is no complete plan of the ship in existence, but there are of the 112-gun ship from 1765, from which the original dimensions of the ship may be found. Here, the units of length are the Spanish Burgos foot (27.86 cm) and the SI metre (100 cm), respectively: length = 213 (59.53); keel = 182 (50.82); beam = 57 (16.09); draught = 28 (8.06).For exact figures, and those in the General characteristics frame, see: José Cayuela Fernandez, Trafalgar, hombres y naves entre dos épocas: Ariel (2004) She was reputed to be the largest warship in the world, for which she was nicknamed El Escorial de los mares by the Spanish, until surpassed in sheer size by the new type French 120-gun ships such as Océan (1790) and Orient (1791). In 1795, her forecastle was joined to her quarterdeck to create a fourth deck containing a battery of eight pounder guns, giving her a total of 140 guns. Her armament seems to have been quickly reduced to 130 from 136 guns, but she still carried more guns than any other ship of her time. The weight of the additional guns, so high above her waterline, made her sail poorly, leading to her nickname, El Ponderoso.El Ponderoso, the ponderous is a pun on el poderoso, the mighty. It was even suggested by some naval officers that she should be restricted to defending the Bay of Cádiz. Santísima Trinidad remains notable as one of the few four-decker ships of the line ever built. The U.S. Navy constructed the four-deck, 136-gun and the French, the 120-gun Valmy, (both with similar flush deck arrangement). The Royal Navy planned — but did not build — the 170-gun four-decker Duke of Kent. ==Service== In July 1779, Spain declared war on Great Britain, joining France in support of the American colonists in the American War of Independence. Santísima Trinidad became the flagship of the Spanish fleet, taking part in the Franco-Spanish operations in the English Channel in the late summer of that year. In August 1780 she took part in the capture of 55 merchant ships from a convoy of 63, escorted by the ship of the line HMS Ramillies and three frigates.Harbron, John: Trafalgar and the Spanish Navy. Conway Maritime Press, 1988, page 84. In 1782 she was incorporated into the Mediterranean Squadron, participating in the Great Siege of Gibraltar and she fought in the brief and indecisive Battle of Cape Spartel. In 1795, she was modified by the addition of extra 8-pounder guns on a new deck between her forecastle and quarterdeck. Battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797 In 1797, she was the flagship of Teniente General José de Córdoba y Ramos, the Spanish commander, at Battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797, where she was badly damaged and nearly captured by the British fleet. She was first in action with the British ship Captain (74), commanded by Commodore Nelson, and Culloden (74). She was then attacked by the Blenheim (90), Orion (74), Irresistible (74) and Excellent (74). By now she was severely damaged, having lost all her masts and with half of her crew killed or wounded. She struck her colours, but the British failed to take possession and she was saved by the Infante don Pelayo (74) and Príncipe de Asturias (112). Several days later, Santísima Trinidad was spotted, still damaged, making her way back to Spain, and engaged by the 32-gun frigate under Captain Richard Bowen, but she escaped. She eventually returned to Cadiz for repairs. Eight years later, commanded by Francisco Javier Uriarte and the flagship of Rear Admiral Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, she took part in the Battle of Trafalgar on October 21, 1805, as part of the combined Franco-Spanish fleet. Due to her great bulk, her helm was unresponsive in the light winds on the day, contributing to her ineffective service in the combined fleet's cause. Her great size and position immediately ahead of the fleet flagship Bucentaure made her a target for the British fleet, and she came under concentrated attack by several ships. She lost her mast and eventually surrendered to the Neptune, a 98-gun second rate commanded by Captain Thomas Fremantle. She was taken in tow by the 98-gun second rate Prince,Fremont-Barnes, Gregory and Hook, Christa: Trafalgar 1805: Nelson's crowning victory. Osprey Publishing, 2005, page 23. but was eventually scuttled by her British captors northwest of Cádiz.Fremont-Barnes and Hook, page 81 It is possible that her wreck was found by coincidence during testing of a new sidescan sonar of the Spanish Navy, in 2009. An earlier attempt to find her wreck was inconclusive as lack of visual evidence could not confirm the identity of the ships found. ==Replicas== Model of the Santísima Trinidad at the thumb A full-size representation of the Santísima Trinidad can be seen and visited in the harbour of Alicante, in Spain. In 2006 a merchant ship was fitted to mimic the appearance of the Santísima Trinidad, therefore not being a true replica. The conversion was begun in Galicia, where the original steel hull was given a first coating of fake wood strakes and erection of the masts. Stern galleries, the deck furniture and the rigging were made in Algeciras. Finally the boat was towed to be moored in the port of Malaga, where she was used as a floating restaurant, nightclub and showroom. The original engine was retained, and the boat is able to cruise around the vicinity of Malaga for recreation purposes. Now the ship is closed to visitors and is in poor condition. A non-profit non- governmental Canadian association, the Friends of Santísima Trinidad, is assisting the Office of the Historian of the City of Havana, Cuba with the construction of a new 1:25 four-metre-long scale model of La Santísima Trinidad. Interior construction details will be exposed on one side of the vessel, and visitors will be able to use a computer interface and touch screen to take a virtual tour of the ship in Spanish, English, and French. The model will be displayed in the Naval Museum of La Habana, opened in June 2008 at Castillo de la Real Fuerza, the oldest building in Cuba and the oldest stone fortress in the New World. ==Notes== ==Sources and references== ==Further reading== *John D.

Pancreatic pseudocysts are usually complications of pancreatitis, although in children they frequently occur following abdominal trauma. Pancreatic pseudocysts account for approximately 75% of all pancreatic masses. ==Signs and symptoms== Signs and symptoms of pancreatic pseudocyst include abdominal discomfort and indigestion. ===Complications=== Complications of pancreatic pseudocysts include infection, hemorrhage, obstruction and rupture. For obstruction, it can cause compression in the GI tract from the stomach to colon, compression in urinary system, biliary system, and arteriovenous system. ==Causes== Pancreatic pseudocyst can occur due to a variety of reasons, among them pancreatitis (chronic), pancreatic neoplasm and/or pancreatic trauma. ==Pathophysiology== Pancreatic pseudocysts are sometimes called false cysts because they do not have an epithelial lining. The wall of the pseudocyst is vascular and fibrotic, encapsulated in the area around the pancreas. Pancreatitis or abdominal trauma can cause its formation. Treatment usually depends on the mechanism that brought about the pseudocyst. Pseudocysts take up to 6 weeks to completely form. ==Diagnosis== CT scan Diagnosis of Pancreatic pseudocyst can be based on cyst fluid analysis: * Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CEA-125 (low in pseudocysts and elevated in tumors); * Fluid viscosity (low in pseudocysts and elevated in tumors); * Amylase (usually high in pseudocysts and low in tumors) The most useful imaging tools are: * Ultrasonography – the role of ultrasonography in imaging the pancreas is limited by patient habitus, operator experience and the fact that the pancreas lies behind the stomach (and so a gas-filled stomach will obscure the pancreas). * Computerized tomography – this is the gold standard for initial assessment and follow-up. * Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) – to establish the relationship of the pseudocyst to the pancreatic ducts, though not routinely used ==Treatment== TPN formula Pancreatic pseudocyst treatment should be aimed at avoiding any complication (1 in 10 cases become infected). They also tend to rupture, and have shown that larger cysts have a higher likelihood to become more symptomatic, even needing surgery. If no signs of infection are present, initial treatment can include conservative measures such as bowel rest (NPO), parenteral nutrition (TPN), and observation. Serum amylase levels can be trended. If symptoms do not improve by 6 weeks, surgical intervention may be appropriate. In the event of surgery: * Cystogastrostomy: In this surgical procedure a connection is created between the back wall of the stomach and the cyst such that the cyst drains into the stomach. * Cystojejunostomy: In this procedure a connection is created between the cyst and the small intestine so that the cyst fluid directly into the small intestine. * Cystoduodenostomy: In this procedure a connection is created between the duodenum (the first part of the intestine) and the cyst to allow drainage of the cyst content into duodenum. The type of surgical procedure depends on the location of the cyst. For pseudocysts that occur in the head of the pancreas a cystduodenostomy is usually performed. ==See also== * Pancreas ==References== ==Further reading== * * * == External links == Category:Pancreas disorders ","title":"Pancreatic pseudocyst"},{"id":"2566006","text":"Route 118 is a north-south state highway in Bristol County, Massachusetts.

The visitor center is on Marshlands Rd, off Thornton Ave. Most of the refuge stretches along the marshy shoreline north and south of the Dumbarton Bridge, but Bair Island, in San Mateo County, is also part of the system. The southernmost extent of the refuge is in northern Santa Clara County. ==History== It was founded in 1974 as the first urban National Wildlife Refuge established in the United States, and it is dedicated to preserving and enhancing wildlife habitat, protecting migratory birds, protecting threatened and endangered species, and providing opportunities for wildlife-oriented recreation and nature study for the surrounding communities. As of 2004, the Refuge spanned of open bay, salt pond, salt marsh, mudflat, upland and vernal pool habitats located throughout south San Francisco Bay. About of salt ponds within the refuge are managed by Cargill Salt, which has perpetual salt-making rights. Cargill uses the salt ponds to concentrate brines as part of its solar salt operation which produces salt for food, agriculture, medical, and industrial uses throughout the Western United States. Located along the Pacific Flyway, the Refuge hosts over 280 species of birds each year. The variety of birds that may call the refuge home or as a stopover consist of the white pelicans, kites, hawks, ospreys, and eagles. Millions of shorebirds and waterfowl stop to refuel at the Refuge during the spring and fall migration. In addition to its seasonal visitors, the Refuge provides critical habitat to resident species like the endangered California clapper rail and salt marsh harvest mouse. Today, hundreds of thousands of people visit the Refuge each year to enjoy its diverse wildlife and habitats. The Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge is one of six wildlife refuges in the San Francisco Bay Area. The others are: Antioch Dunes, Ellicott Slough, Farallon, Marin Islands, and San Pablo Bay.

At that time the total number of GCSU members was around 30,000 out of 50,000 clerical workers in the 1960s. ==Early life== He was born in 1922 in Galle, Southern Sri Lanka and spent his childhood there. ==Trade union work== He was well-read about Communism and in his speeches he explained how to use Communist ideology within the trade union struggle. He organised branch committees of the union throughout the country. He was elected secretary of the union and later became President. During the years from 1965–70, many incidents happened in Sri Lanka's politics and the union reacted to the changes by taking the side of the worker.

In the late 1960s, NSF adopted the political ideologies of Marxism–Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Its predecessor, the DSF (Democratic Students Federation), had links to the Communist Party of Pakistan. It had power base among progressive students from Dow Medical and DJ Science Colleges. It dominated student politics in Karachi, then the Federal Capital of the country. In a convention at the national level of students, held in Khaliqdina Hall, Karachi (1953), the DSF renamed itself to NSF (National Students Federation) in the late 1960s, laying claim to being a national movement and hoping to spread the Student Revolution to the whole country. Demonstrations and strikes had already paralyzed the Karachi for several days. The government apparently gave in by sacrificing the Minister for Education, Mr Fazlur Rahman, who hailed from East Pakistan. He was sacked from his post. It was not much of a victory for the students. APSO was banned and the leaders were thrown in the Karachi Central Jail. NSF (The National Students Federation) a small nationalist and right-wing group which had been propped up by the help of Karachi University Vice Chancellor to counter DSF's activities, was invaded practically overnight by the now-banned DSF party members, who were still outside. The former DSF members had enough muscle and organisational skills to take over the control of NSF in 1956, thus its new \\"left\\" leaning profile emerged. Due to its links with communist movement, DSF was infested with the presence of double agents/informers from the secret service. ==First split== NSF saw its first major split in 1965, between the pro-China and pro-Moscow factions, better known as the NSF-Meraj Group and the NSF-Kazmi Group. While the NSF-Meraj group supported the PPP, the NSF Kazmi group was the student arm of the National Awami Party (NAP), which today is the ANP. Because this particular faction hold most backward views within the progressive movement they soon loose the ground. Mr Ameer Haider Kazmi took position in PPP and his faction was liquidated. NSF remained active in many Pakistani universities and colleges and won the elections of Students Unions. It played a major role in the popular student and labour uprising against the pro-US dictatorship of Field Marshal Ayub Khan in 1967 and 1968. NSF activists were among the first major supporters of future Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and his populist/socialist Pakistan Peoples Party to advance the democratic process and to weaken the religious fundamentalists. One of the leading leaders of NSF, Meraj Muhammad Khan, was made a minister in Bhutto's first cabinet but both NSF and Meraj fell out with the Bhutto government in 1973 when Bhutto started to compromise on his socialist agenda. Meraj Mohammad Khan remained president of NSF till 1967 and was later replaced by Rasheed Hassan Khan (student of Dow Medical College Karachi) in a council session held in Lahore in 1970. ==NSF and People's Party== The following are the main reasons which contributed in withdrawing NSF support from the PPP. * After PPP won the 1970 election and emerged as the single largest party in West Pakistan, it refused to acknowledge the mandate of the Awami League and their demands of greater autonomy and furthermore its policies regarding army operation in East Pakistan. The NSF and Mazdoor Kissan Party were the main left organizations who strongly opposed army operation against Bengalis. * Differences further deepened when the NSF realized that Bhutto was backing off from his promises of radical economical and social changes which he made to students and the working class. * Bhutto wanted to silence his dissidents so he cracked down on the workers and students. The breaking point between Bhutto and the NSF came when Bhutto crushed the labour movement in Site on 7–8 June and in Landhi on 17–18 October in 1972. Several workers were killed and hundreds arrested. Rasheed Hassan Khan, then a Central President of NSF, had to go underground. Consequently, the NSF withdrew its support from the PPP and exposed Bhutto's hypocrisy and opportunistic politics. Miraj Mohamed khan decided to remain in the PPP. Miraj was in view that it was the establishment that is trying to create conflicts among workers and that PPP and its policies are clean but he was proved wrong later. In years to come, the gulf of difference between ZA Bhutto and Meraj khan widened and Meraj Mohd Khan has no choice other than to leave PPP and form his own political organisation which he named as Qomi Mahaz-e-Azadi and his own faction of NSF. In the mid 1990s Miraj dissolved the Qomi Mahaz-e-Azadi and joined hand with cricketer turn politician Imran Khan and become Secretary General of PTI. He soon fell out with Khan and resigned from PTI. Once, a flamboyant student leader, Meraj fell into political isolation and he never regained his position as a representative leader of working class, a position he enjoyed once. ==Afghan saur revolution== NSF saw another split in the 1980s when the USSR invaded Afghanistan. A majority faction condemned the soviet invasion, believed that revolution can not be exported. It was said that this will provide opportunity to imperialist powers to use religious extremist to curb progressive movements. Within Afghanistan various Marxist parties and groups were also divided over the issue. The small faction headed by Zahid Hussain took the position that criticizing so called 'Afghan saur revolution' would meant to be supporting the Mujahideen and see this as support to the Army Junta and dictatorship of General Zia-ul-Haq, playing into the hands of the USA. That gave birth to a small dissident group headed by Zahid Hussain. This faction liquidated soon and member of this faction later joined various pro soviet groups or took positions in establishment. These Opportunist wolves in sheep's clothing done damage to NSF in particular and to the progressive and workers movement in general. Their position on this issue demonstrated that they failed to understand the imperialist strategy and their grasp of Marxism–Leninism-Mao Tsetung Thought was fairly shallow. Revisionism and opportunism is always the main danger and obstacle to the advance of progressive movement. Both betrayals from inside and the state crack down from outside were great setback to NSF and helped NSF's arch rivals, the right- wing, Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba (IJT), the student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami, gain ground in the many student union elections held in the country's campuses in the 1970s and the 1980s. Till then the NSF had been sweeping student union elections in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. NSF was also affected by the creation of the Pakistan Peoples Party's student wing, the Peoples Students Federation (PSF) whose main purpose was to counter the NSF opposition to PPP in the early 1970s. ==Ban on students' unions== Left leaning and progressive parties were persecuted and harassed by the right-wing dictatorship of President General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s, dozens of NSF activists were arrested, tortured and expelled from the campuses. NSF joined alliance of progressive student parties that included DSF, PSF and many secular nationalist student groups like Baloch Students Federation in students' union elections across the country. NSF gained significant victories in students unions elections before they were banned by General Zia-ul-Huq in 1984. After seeing the fate of Ayub Khan, Zia realised that student power needs to be curbed and crushed. He also wanted to pave his way to freely act as an American agent to fight a proxy war for America in Afghanistan, which eventually led the downfall of the Russian social Imperialism. On 9–11 February 1984, he banned students union starting from Sindh and than carrying out the orders to the rest of the country. Dow Medical College had always been the focus of the left politics and produced great student leaders from time to time. It was not a surprise that Dow Medical College was first to react to the ban on student political activities. At that particular time there were five elected unions in major campuses of Karachi, Dow Medical College (Khalid Anwer NSF panel), Sind Medical College (Rizwan Naeem, NSF panel)) and Dawood Engineering College (Rao Jamal Hamid, NSF panel) had elected Presidents from NSF. This was the popularity of NSF that Karachi University was the only institute with panel elected from right wing Islami Jamiat-e-Talba. On the morning of the ban, NSF workers were running an admission campaign to facilitate newcomers to Dow medial and Sind Medical College . NSF refused to accept the Ordinance of military dictator and immediately put black armbands and took students to the streets and ran a campaign for 100 days. NSF was the only student organisation in Karachi which started the protest and all started from Dow Medical college. Islami Jamiat Talba joined later for face saving and in the broader interest of the students cause NSF had a combined meeting in Dow medical college where two organisations joined hands for the same cause. It must be reiterated that NSF kept the lead in the hand because of the brave nature of the workers and readiness to sacrifice for the cause. Dozens of NSF workers were arrested but were not deterred from the cause. During the process of protest, Sind Medical College was stormed by police and shelled with tear gas. NSF workers like Hakim Baloch, Humayun from SMC, Babar Asad, Kaleem and Shahid from Dawood Engineering College and Sohail Jaffar and Bashmi Mumtaz from NED and Iqbal, Riaz Pekar from Karachi University were few to name on the forefront of this movement. Thousands of students led by NSF protested across Pakistan, hundreds were put behind the bars and tortured. This movement was brutally suppressed by the dictator and in later years a new era of de-politicization of youth began. After the ban on students' unions, right-wing student organisations were given free hand to operate and violently curb progressive students activism by the military dictator. NSF suffered heavily from the trend of violence once pioneered by IJT and later adopted by APMSO, and MSF which was intensified in the late 1980s and 1990s. Across the country NSF workers were banned from entering or holding their political activities on campuses. Subsequently, major campuses become no go areas for progressive students and NSF was overshadowed by pro establishment and other regional groups like APMSO and PSF and by Islamic fundamentalist student parties such as IJT and Pakistan Muslim League's student wing, Muslim Students Federation (MSF). NSF suffered greatly by the state crackdown and violence in campuses and its presence were marginalized. NSF held its Eighteenth Central Council Session in 2000 in Lahore but in later year saw little presence in campuses. ==Re-emergence== However, since the early 2007 NSF is regrouping and has seen activities associated with re-organisation taking along some of the old comrades as well as new ones. It has taken part in Lawyers' Movement against the dictatorship of General Pervaiz Musharraf. Despite the numerous errors and zig-zags in developing progressive movement, NSF has made important progress towards Re- organizational work and In Jan 2011 NSF central council session was held in Faislabad. Hundreds of students participated from all over the Pakistan. In the two days council session, Ch Irfan Ali was elected as President of Punjab and Alia Amirali was elected as General Secretary. Participants vowed to continue their struggle and move beyond any ethnic, linguistic and sectarian affiliations and unite at a national platform not just for better education but for People's Democracy and class consciousness to the people's movements. NSF has made second convention on 27 November 2014 in Shakhupur. In this convention hundreds of students of participated from all over Pakistan. One day council session, Khalid was elected as president of Punjab and Ali Raza was elected as General Secretary. NSF has made important progress and NSF made a first convention on 30th 2018 NSF central council session was held in Karachi. Hundreds of students participated from all over the Pakistan. In the two days council session, Ahmad Khan from Punjab was elected as Central President, vice president Sajjad Khan from KPK, General Secretary Peral Azad from Sindh, Finance Secretary Comrade Sana, Women Secretary Purva Masaud, Joint Secretary Tahir Mujtba, Press Secretary Sanawar Farid Azad, Latif Ibrahim was elected as Social media Secretary. At present, NSF have become the only one organization of students politics in Pakistan. ==References== Category:Student societies in Pakistan Category:Students' federations of Pakistan Category:Student wings of political parties in Pakistan Category:Student organizations established in 1965 ","title":"National Students Federation"},{"id":"2566162","text":"Traralgon railway station is located on the Gippsland line in Victoria, Australia.

The station building and three arch road bridge are both Grade II listed structures. ==History== The station was built by the East Lancashire Railway's Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Junction section, and opened on 2 April 1849. From 13 May 1859, the station was owned by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. From 1 January 1923 the station was owned by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. British Railways nationalised all railways on 1 January 1948 and the station became part of the London Midland Region. A branch line to via was opened by the ELR in March 1858 shortly before it was absorbed by the L&YR; – this left the main line to Preston just to the north of the station. The line from Liverpool was subsequently electrified in 1913, with the suburban EMUs using a bay platform at the southern end of the station to keep them clear of the busy main line to Preston, which was used as the L&Y;'s principle route to East Lancashire, the Fylde, Cumbria and Scotland. ===1977=== The original Liverpool terminus of the line () was closed in 1977,\\"Disused Stations – Liverpool Exchange\\" Disused Stations; Retrieved 25 March 2016 when the route became one of the three branches of the new Northern Line and trains began running to a new underground terminus at Liverpool Central. Since 1996, it has been part of the Merseyrail franchise currently (2016) run by Serco-Abellio. ==Station layout== Merseyrail electric and Northern diesel trains wait at the same platform. Note the trains are separated by a buffer The current station consists of a single platform. An interesting characteristic is how the electric Merseyrail track and the unelectrified Northern track is on the same alignment, with electric and diesel trains using opposite ends of the same platform. The line is cut by a large buffer separating the track sections. Passengers wishing to transfer from an electric train to diesel train walk a dozen yards or so along the same platform to move between trains. A similar layout exists at Kirkby station. Prior to the Beeching Report of 1963 and the subsequent restructuring of the rail network, there were two main through platforms. The electric Liverpool commuter trains would pull into the southern bay platform. This practice ended following the withdrawal of through trains between Liverpool and Preston via this route. Local services from Preston, East Lancashire & Blackpool towards Liverpool were either withdrawn or terminated at Ormskirk from October 1969 with the last through trains running on 3 May 1970. From the 4 May 1970, the line was split with all trains using the former Liverpool platform (the Preston-bound platform remains, however is disused). The bay platform is now a footpath leading to the bus station. Only a single Merseyrail 3rd rail electric line runs into the platform, the route towards Liverpool becomes double immediately outside the station. The line from Ormskirk to Preston has been single track since the summer of 1970, except for a passing loop at . The former link between Ormskirk and Southport, via the Burscough Curves, was closed in 1962. The Skelmersdale Branch has also been lost, having closed to passengers in 1956 and to all traffic seven years later. It was lifted in 1968, though the Burscough curves remained extant until the mid-1980s.Marshall, J. (1981) Forgotten Railways North-West England, David & Charles (Publishers) Ltd, Newton Abbott. , p.93 ==Facilities== The station underwent a £1.5 million renovation during 2009. Among the refurbishments include a new booking hall, waiting room, toilet facilities, ticket counters and new automatic swinging doors, as well as a remodelled and landscaped path and bicycle route up to the bus interchange. The station is classed as eco- friendly and gets its green credentials by using a system that harvests rainwater, as well as other various energy-saving measures. During October & November 2018 the height, width and layout of the platforms were adjusted to prepare for Merseyrail's new fleet of trains which are due to be introduced from 2020. The station is staffed, 15 minutes before the first train and 15 minutes after the last train, and has platform CCTV. There is a payphone, waiting room, booking office and live departure and arrival screens, for passenger information. The station has a free car park, with 108 spaces, as well as a 2-space cycle rack and secure storage for 28 cycles. The station and platforms have full disabled access but the car park has uneven ramp access. ==Services== Services to Liverpool Central operate frequently, running every 15 minutes during the day (Mon-Sat) and every 30 minutes at other times (evenings and Sundays). Services to Preston now run hourly Monday–Saturday (since the May 2018 timetable change). There is no Sunday service.GB eNRT May 2018 Edition, Tables 99 & 105 ==Future== There have been calls from local authorities and the local rail user group to reopen both curves at Burscough to allow the reinstatement of through trains from Ormskirk to Southport, as well as to reinstate through services between Preston and Liverpool via Ormskirk and to rebuild and reopen the Skelmersdale branch.OPSTA's ManifestoOrmskirk, Preston and Southport Travellers' Association; Retrieved 29 March 2016 Merseytravel's 2014 Liverpool City Region Long Term Rail Strategy does not back plans for an Ormskirk to Skelmersdale route (instead proposing that the link be provided from the to Wigan Wallgate line), but it suggests that a new bi-level interchange at Burscough Bridge could be built, to provide improved interchange facilities between the Ormskirk branch and the Wigan to Southport line, in addition to reopening the curves and extending electrification through to Preston and Southport.\\"Merseytravel publishes 30-year rail blueprint\\"Place North West article 28 August 2014 ; Retrieved 29 March 2016 Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, Long Term Rail Strategy document of October 2017, page 37, states a review to introduce new Merseyrail battery trains will be undertaken in 2020, in view to put Preston interchange station onto the Merseyrail network by extending the Merseyrail Northern Line from Ormskirk to Preston.

After the character's launch in 2003, Rilakkuma has been featured on stationery and merchandise created by San-X, as well as several collaboration cafes. Along with picture books and comics, a stop-motion animation series titled Rilakkuma and Kaoru was broadcast in 2019. ==Development== San-X employee Aki Kondo had previously created characters such as Amagurichan and Mikanbouya. At the time, San-X ordered staff members to create one character per month. After watching a TV show about dogs at the height of the pet boom in Japan, Kondo not only wanted a pet dog, but also envied its life, as she was busy with work and hoped to relax more. This inspired her to create Rilakkuma, with its name a portmanteau of the words and Rilakkuma was designed with a slightly sloppy posture because Kondo found it amusing, believing that it should look \\"cute\\", yet \\"out of place.\\" Kondo had also designed Rilakkuma with a zipper on its back, which became one of its quirks. San-X initially found Rilakkuma too gangly and had preferred characters with small hands. ==Character== Rilakkuma was launched in 2003 and first seen in San-X's four-panel comic series titled Rilakkuma Seikatsu. In Rilakkuma Seikatsu, which describes his origin story, it appears one day in the apartment of a female office worker named Kaoru, who only appears as a silhouette. Rilakkuma spends every day relaxing. The zipper on its back reveals that his appearance is a costume, and its true form is unknown. It is accompanied by other creatures in the series, who also have their own character lines. ===Korilakkuma=== ' is a white bear introduced in Rilakkuma Seikatsu in 2003. Like Rilakkuma, it appeared in Kaoru's apartment one day and was named by Kiiroitori. It has a red button on its chest and does not appear to be a real bear. It has a mischievous personality and loves pranks. ===Kiiroitori=== ' is Kaoru's pet yellow bird introduced in Rilakkuma Seikatsu in 2003. He can leave his cage at any time and takes care of both Rilakkuma and Korilakkuma. ===Chairoikoguma=== ' is a brown honey bear introduced in 2016. Korilakkuma finds it one day in the forest and befriends it, bringing it to meet Rilakkuma and Kiiroitori. Chairoikoguma has defined fangs when its mouth is opened, as well as bear-shaped honey patches on its feet and rear. Its friend is Kumanbachi, a honey bee. ==Marketing and distribution== Along with stationery and product lines, Rilakkuma has collaborated with multiple organizations, brands, and character cafes. In September 2017, Aliquantum International became the exclusive distributor of San-X products in North America. In partnership with Aliquantum International, San-X opened its first temporary pop-up Rilakkuma shop in Florida, USA. In September 2018, a second pop-up shop opened at the New York City's Times Square. A stop motion animated series called Rilakkuma and Kaoru began streaming on Netflix on April 19, 2019. The series was made at Dwarf Studio. It is directed by Masahito Kobayashi and written by Naoko Ogigami, with Mikako Tabe voicing Kaoru in Japanese and Lana Condor voicing Kaoru in English. ==Reception== Initial sales for the Rilakkuma product line were low but slowly picked up popularity in 2004, with Rilakkuma breaking the stereotype of cute characters needing to be energetic. In May 2010, Rilakkuma ranked as the fifth most popular character in Japan in a survey of the Character Databank. ==Media== ===Picture books=== *Rilakkuma Seikatsu - Daradara Mainichi no Susume (Aki Kondo, March 2004) *Dararan Biyori - Rilakkuma Seikatsu 2 (Aki Kondo, November 2004) *Tori Dayori - Rilakkuma Seikatsu 3 (Aki Kondo, May 2005) *Kuma Goyomi - Rilakkuma Seikatsu 4 (Aki Kondo, September 2006) *Utatane Kibun - Rilakkuma Seikatsu 5 (Aki Kondo, September 2007) *Bonyari Kinenbi - Rilakkuma Seikatsu 6 (Aki Kondo, August 2008) *Yanwari Jozu - Rilakkuma Seikatsu 7 (Aki Kondou, October 2010) ===Sticker books=== *Rilakkuma Daradara Seal Book (Aki Kondo, November 2004) *Rilakkuma Dara Pika Seal Book (Aki Kondo, May 2005) *Rilakkuma Gorogoro Seal Book (Aki Kondo, September 2006) *Rilakkuma Howa Pika Seal Book (Aki Kondo, September 2007) *Rilakkuma Nohohon Seal Book (Aki Kondo, August 2008) *Rilakkuma Daradara Seal Book (Aki Kondo, August 2017) ===Games=== *Rilakkuma na Mainichi (Rocket Company, Game Boy Advance, April 2005) *Rilakkuma ~ojamashitemasu 2 Shuukan~ (Interchannel, PlayStation 2, September 2005) *Watashi no Rilakkuma (Rocket Company, Nintendo DS, April 2007) *Chokkan Asonde Rilakkuma (Smilesoft, Nintendo DS, September 2008) *Rilakkuma Minna de Goyururi Seikatsu (MTO, Nintendo Wii, March 2009) *Norinori Rilakkuma Hit Song Ongaku (Smilesoft, Nintendo DS, December 2010) *LINE Rilakkuma Loop (LINE), (Android, iOS 2016) *Rilakkuma Farm, (Imagineer, Android, iOS 2019) ===TV series=== *Rilakkuma and Kaoru (Netflix, April 19, 2019) ==ReferencesCategory:Comics characters introduced in 2003 Category:San-X characters Category:Fictional teddy bears ","title":"Rilakkuma"},{"id":"2566206","text":"A Power Marketing Administration (PMA) is a United States federal agency within the Department of Energy with the responsibility for marketing hydropower, primarily from multiple-purpose water projects operated by the Bureau of Reclamation, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the International Boundary and Water Commission.

Ausiait, formerly Egedesminde, is a town in the Qeqertalik municipality in western Greenland, located in the heart of Aasiaat Archipelago at the southern end of Disko Bay. With a population of 3,069 as of 2020, it is Greenland's fourth-largest town. View to Aasiaat. ==Etymology== In Greenlandic, Aasiaat means \\"Spiders\\" (). The exact explanation for this is yet to be determined because of the lack of historical facts of the origin of the name. The most common assumption is that when the town was founded as a mere settlement, it was abundant with spiders. Like in the rest of Greenland, spiders are rarely seen in the town in modern times. Aasiaat is sometimes referred to as the Town of the Whales, since marine mammals such as whales and seals are a common sight. ==History== ===Native peoples=== Archaeological projects in the region have suggested human habitation in the region that includes Aasiaat as far back as the 5th millennium BC. The earliest modern settlers dated to around 1200; these were probably subsistence hunters. These inhabitants hunted harp seals and capelin (ammassaat) near Sydøst Bay in the spring. In the summer, they moved to Nassuttooq for reindeer and halibut. During autumn, the people of Disko Bay returned home to hunt small harp seals. In the winter, the bay froze over, and they hunted narwhals and Beluga whales. These early people designed and built their own kayaks and umiaks when the water freed up; in the winter, they used qamutits. ===Early history of Aasiaat=== Icebergs stranded in the waterways of the Aasiaat archipelago, Greenland, near the Aasiaat harbor The settlement that would become Aasiaat was founded in 1759 by Niels Egede, son of Hans Egede, a Norwegian missionary. Named Egedesminde Colony after him, it was located north of Nordre Strømfjord, and was 125 km south of Aasiaat's current location. The town was moved to its current site in 1763. Most villagers were whalers, and the smallpox germs they carried to the region ravaged the native population, especially during the 1770s. ===Early 20th century=== Aasiaat saw much growth in the first half of the 20th century. In 1932, the town opened the first school in the country which allowed women to obtain secondary education. One of its first graduates was the first woman novelist of Greenland, Mâliâraq Vebæk, who was valedictorian of her graduating class in 1934. ===Aasiaat in World War II=== On May 3, 1940, a treaty signed in Godhavn allowed American relief airplanes bound for the British Isles to use Greenlandic, Icelandic, and Scottish airspace. A result of World War II was the fact that Denmark, under the control of Nazi Germany, could not freely send supplies to Greenland; this task fell to the United States and Canada. Supplies were stored near Aasiaat, and were then transferred to other towns of the region, such as Uummannaq and Sisimiut. ===Post-World War II=== Aasiaat has grown much since the war. A weather station was constructed in 1942 by the Americans. Cod, an economically popular fish since the 1930s, were caught and sent to a new factory to be salted and packed. Other businesses sprang up, accommodating to the resources and climate of the region. This boom reached its peak in the 1950s, when a power plant and telecommunications station were installed. In 1998, a new landing strip was opened to the public (previously a heliport was the only aerial facility); it is near a shrimp processing factory. Today, almost 4,800 people live in Aasiaat and its neighboring settlement, Kangaatsiaq. ==Geography== Icebergs in Disko Bay The largest island of the Aasiaat Archipelago is Saqqarliup Nunaa, which is uninhabited, but has buildings to accommodate tourists. On the western tip of the island is the abandoned village of Manermiut. As of 2013 the total population of the archipelago is spread among three settlements:Statistics Greenland, Population in localities * The town of Aasiaat (3,142 inhabitants), is located on the namesake island just northwest of Saqqarliup Nunaa. * The settlement of Akunnaaq (98 inhabitants) is located on the namesake island just northeast of Saqqarliup Nunaa, east-north-east of Aasiaat. * The settlement of Kitsissuarsuit (87 inhabitants) is located on the small namesake island (Danish Hunde Ejland, for the village and the island), northwest of Aasiaat. Another abandoned village is Vester Ejland on the namesake island, the westernmost of the archipelago, west-south-west of Aasiaat. == Population == With 3,069 inhabitants as of 2020, Aasiaat is the largest town in the Qeqertalik municipality. The population has fluctuated considerably over the last two decades, decreasing 3% relative to the 2001 levels but increasing more than 10% relative to the 2008 levels. ==Education== Aasiaat has four schools: a regular school (Gammeqarfik), a highschool (GU-Aasiaat), a vocational school (Piarersarfik), and a school for the mentally disabled (Ado Lyngep Atuarfia). ==Economy== Fishing of shrimp and crabs, shipbuilding, and tourism are the primary economic activities of the region. The archipelago area offers many services for tourists, including kayaking, cross-country skiing, dogsledding, and whale-watching. == Transport == Aasiaat is a port of call for the Arctic Umiaq Line coastal ship and Diskoline.gl (domestic passenger ships for disko bay). Aasiaat harbour functions as well as a hub for regional shipping. The town is also served by Aasiaat Airport with direct connections to Ilulissat and other settlements in the country and Disko Bay region, as well as the Air Greenland hub in Kangerlussuaq. Air Iceland occasionally arrange charter flights for the travel industry. == Community events == Aasiaat has several recurrent events which engage most of the inhabitants and visitors. \\"Maaji-mi Peqqissuusa\\" (let's stay healthy in May) is an arrangement with focus on activities which will improve one's health and is based on volunteer organizers. Aasiaat Midnightsun Marathon takes place in late June with different distances with start/finish in the town square with live music. Nipiaa Rock Festival is usually a 3-day long concert with various musicians. It is known as the best musical event in Greenland. The Rock Festival takes place in the Sportshall at the end of August/beginning of September. ==Climate== Aasiaat has a tundra climate (ET) with a July mean of only 5.7. ==References== Category:Disko Bay Category:Populated places in Greenland Category:Populated places of Arctic Greenland Category:Populated places established in 1759 Category:Qeqertalik ","title":"Aasiaat"},{"id":"2566261","text":"Highway 61 is a soundtrack album to the Canadian film Highway 61, released in 1991.

In June, 2005, Avila created a website, Fedexfurniture.com, to display photographs of a couch, bed, dining room table, and desk that he had constructed out of cartons obtained from overnight shipping giant FedEx Corporation (FedEx). FedEx attorneys used the takedown provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to force Avila's ISP to take the site offline, accusing Avila of infringing on FedEx's copyrights and trademarks, breaching his contract with FedEx by using the cartons for purposes other than shipping, and potentially misleading consumers into believing that FedEx approved or endorsed Avila's actions. Among attorneys and activist organizations concerned with the exercise of First Amendment rights on the Internet, FedEx's actions raised questions about the constitutionality of using the DMCA to censor unwanted speech. The Fedexfurniture.com website is down as of July 8th, 2017. ==The story== In 2005, Avila moved to Tempe, Arizona with nothing more than clothes and work essentials. He was still stuck in a lease on his California apartment, and could barely afford his new apartment in Arizona. After a bit of frustration over not having furniture, Avila remembered that a former roommate had solved a similar problem by constructing furniture using FedEx cartons. Using hundreds of FedEx boxes and materials that he \\"already had lying around\\" for shipping various items, Avila constructed every piece of furniture in his apartment. Avila's designs were sturdy and attractive. Friends urged Avila to put pictures of the furniture on a Web site. According to Avila, he did so in order to show that trying financial circumstances need not lead to despair; one can respond creatively, even artistically, by using \\"found\\" materials. The site's message was \\"It's OK to be ghetto\\". The site subsequently attracted widespread attention, both from Web surfers and the press. Because the site was getting so much traffic, Avila placed a PayPal donation link on the page and asked for help to pay for the bandwidth charges. He also announced a plan to sell Fedexfurniture.com T-shirts, although Avila says that no T-shirts were ever sold. On June 27, 2005, FedEx attorneys wrote to Avila's ISP. Citing the takedown provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), they demanded that the ISP remove Avila's materials from the Web. They justified their request on two grounds: *Infringement of FedEx's intellectual property (specifically, copyrights and trademarks.) *Violation of FedEx's terms of use for packaging supplies. In order to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the DMCA, Avila's ISP complied with the request and removed Avila's materials from the Web. Had the ISP not done so, it could have been held liable for contributory infringement (aiding and abetting the infringer) if Avila's materials were subsequently found to be infringing in a court of law. FedEx's actions concerned Internet free speech activist organizations, such as Stanford University's Center for Internet and Society, which are concerned about the use of the DMCA's takedown provisions to censor unwanted speech. According to these organizations, the DMCA's purpose is to prevent Internet copyright infringement; it was never Congress's intent that the DMCA's takedown provisions should be used when the real issue is trademark infringement or breach of contract. A Stanford attorney, Jennifer Granick, assisted Avila on a pro bono basis. In her letter to FedEx, she disputed the use of the DMCA to remove Avila's site from the Web; she argued that the company's claim of copyright infringement had no merit; therefore, FedEx should not have used the DMCA to silence Avila's speech. The company's underlying motivations, she argued, were to protect its trademark and ability to place restrictions on public use of its cartons. Avila restored his site briefly. The dispute attracted widespread press attention, and Avila was frequently interviewed to tell his side of the story. In response to Granick's letter, FedEx attorneys reiterated their claims.

Fast-paced, madcap and relatively mature in themes, it's usually comedic, with occasional elements of romance. In Japan, the manga began serialization in the December 1990 issue of the Shueisha magazine Monthly Shōnen Jump. It switched to the sister publication Monthly Shōnen Jump Original in 1993 and ended in the March 1997 issue. A total of eight tankōbon (bound volumes) collecting the chapters were released by Shueisha between 1991 and 1997, but it is now out of print. Futaba-kun Change was licensed by Studio Ironcat in the United States, but as the company went out of business their release is also out of print. == Plot == Futaba Shimeru is a normal high-schooler living a normal life, active in his school's wrestling club and slowly getting closer to his awkward love interest, Misaki. This fails to last as he discovers his family's hereditary genetic defect that becomes active at adolescence. Although it will eventually become controllable, either excitement or stress now makes Futaba switch sex. Hilarity ensues. The general status quo of the storyline, tone and atmosphere is maintained until volume 6, at which point Misaki discovers Futaba's secret. In volume 8, the manga abruptly changes from light comedy to serious science fiction. Futaba, Misaki and Kurin are taken by aliens that explain that the Shimeru family are not merely bizarrely mutated but descendants of a space crash 12 to 13 thousand years ago. They are taken to the star system they originated from to see a structure much like a Dyson sphere, but see that the entire race has been annihilated. Determined to find a less tragic future, they return to Earth. 8 years have passed, all their friends and family have happy lives (Motomura and Nigiri have gotten married and Futana is a celebrity playboy), the Shimeru clan have spread throughout the world, and their condition is now widely known and accepted. ==Themes== The characters of Futaba and Misaki are quite realistic (while virtually every other person is a certified nutjob), and the former's state is examined from day one. As such, the effects on the sufferer are an important part, especially early on. This includes the physical aspect, which is presented realistically but a few parts are left to the imagination. The gradual romance between Futaba and Misaki, and to a lesser degree Misaki and Futaba, though now very awkward indeed forms a loose central structure. Commonly enough, events turn into chaos, usually through the help of other characters ranging from Futaba's older sister with her/his anything-that-moves attitude to one who suffers from the nosebleed cliché taken to its grotesque extreme. Parallels to the well-known Ranma ½ series, where the protagonist's effect is triggered and reversed by cold and hot water, are unavoidable. Shimeru is even a wrestler while Ranma Saotome is a martial artist. This wouldn't be the only time Aro seemed to be influenced by Ranma 1/2, seeing the title of his other manga Morumo 1/10. On the other hand, Ranma ½ is more cartoonish in both drawing style and content as well as containing precious little references to sexuality. Ranma starts off already used to if unhappy with his situation, and spends a lot of his time fighting while Futaba only occasionally comes to blows and those blows tend towards the theoretically possible. Several other pop culture characters make cameos, including Street Fighter characters, Sesame Street puppets, Ryoko and Aeka from Tenchi Muyo!, Magical Taluluto from Magical Taluluto, or even Hiroshi Aro himself (drawn as a glasses-wearing alligator). ==Characters== ; :The lead character of the story, he's stunned to learn that not only will he change into a girl when he becomes excited, but somehow he failed to notice that all of the other members of his family switch sex as well. His new female form is just as strong as his male form, and has a power of attraction that quickly launches her into a career as a Japanese idol. His family name is a reference to the word futanari. ; :Futaba's love interest, the fact that he turns into a girl when he becomes aroused places a seemingly insurmountable barrier to their relationship. Her cooking is intolerably sweet to anyone else, and she is very superstitious. After she switches from swimming club to wrestling club so her new friend \\"Futaba-chan\\" won't be the only girl in it, there is a joke about how it turns out that none of the other swimmers actually know how to swim in regular water that isn't filled with dissolved sugar from Misaki's sugar-filled body. Her family has a little connection to the Shimeru clan. ; :Futaba's sister who in her male form makes the most out of her powers of attraction, by seducing countless girls and probably a few boys as well. She doesn't use birth control, and leaves a small army of sex-shifting offspring behind. She also gropes Futaba, but probably more for the amusement value of watching his reactions than genuine interest since it doesn't cause her to shift sex. Futana genuinely loves both sexes, even to the point of shape shifting in front of Futaba whom he tricked to do sexy poses. ; :A very important member of the main Shimeru family which has arranged for her engagement to Futaba. Imperious and pushy she is initially contemptuous of her fiance until she learns that he's also the famous Futaba-chan and that he's already interested in someone else, at which point she desperately tries to win his affection. In her female form she is short and unattractive, but her male form is tall, handsome and surrounded by a cloud of pheromones that leave women awestruck. She uses this power to get free food since the transformation makes her extremely hungry. ; :The president of the wrestling club, Motomura is a large and impressive manly figure but is easily moved to tears in his excesses of emotion. He is also a compulsive gambler and Negiri takes great advantage of his weakness. ;Takeru :Another member of the wrestling club, he's the weakest wrestler among them, and a would-be lothario. ;Chima :The last member of the wrestling club, he takes the Japanese cliché of nosebleeds due to sexual arousal to exaggerated lengths, even using it as a weapon in a martial arts tournament. ;Iroka Kahoru :A famous actress/model, s/he is the person Futaba thought of as his father, although he actually gave birth to Futaba. Iroka pushes Futaba to follow in her footsteps as Futaba-chan. ; :Misaki Shima's friend, she takes control of both the wrestling club and Futaba-chan's idol career because Motomura and Futaba are both easily taken advantage of. Negiri is Futaba-kun's equivalent of Nabiki Tendo and speaks using Kansai turns of phrase. ;Principal Hiroin :A small man with an over- sized head, Principal Hiroin is somewhat mad. Whenever he sees someone in trouble he changes into one of his superhero costumes (modelled on Japanese superheroes) and appears to attempt to save the day. He is aware of Futaba's double identity and arranged for both identities to be students at the school, which has many secret cubbyholes where Futaba (and Principal Hiroin) can change identities without being seen. His daughter, Takane, is secretly Queen X and playacts at supervillainy just as he plays at superheroics. ==References== ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== *Futaba-kun Change! at Japan Authors' Gallery *The Futaba-kun Change Homepage * Category:1990 manga Category:Shōnen manga Category:Shueisha manga Category:Transgender in anime and manga ","title":"Futaba-kun Change!"},{"id":"2566318","text":"Charles Cockerell may refer to: * Charles Robert Cockerell (1788–1863), English architect, archaeologist, and writer * Sir Charles Cockerell, 1st Baronet (1755–1837), English official of the East India Company and politician ","title":"Charles Cockerell"},{"id":"2566321","text":"The Confidence-Man: His Masquerade, first published in New York on April Fool's Day 1857, is the ninth book and final novel by American writer Herman Melville. The book was published on the exact day of the novel's setting. Centered around the title character, The Confidence-Man portrays a group of steamboat passengers. Their interlocking stories are told as they travel the Mississippi River toward New Orleans. The narrative structure is reminiscent of the late 1300s Canterbury Tales. Scholar Robert Milder notes: \\"Long mistaken for a flawed novel, the book is now admired as a masterpiece of irony and control, although it continues to resist interpretive consensus.\\"Milder (1988), 440 After the novel's publication, Melville turned from professional writing to became a lecturer, mainly addressing his worldwide travels, and later for nineteen years a federal government agent. ==Analysis== Manuscript fragment from Chapter 14 of The Confidence-Man. The novel's title refers to its central character, an ambiguous figure. He sneaks aboard a Mississippi steamboat on April Fool's Day. This stranger attempts to test the confidence of the passengers. Their varied reactions constitute the bulk of the text. Each person, including the reader, is forced to confront the placement of his trust. The novel is written as cultural satire, allegory, and metaphysical treatise, dealing with themes of sincerity, identity, morality, religiosity, economic materialism, irony, and cynicism. Many readers place The Confidence- Man alongside Melville's Moby-Dick and \\"Bartleby, the Scrivener\\" as a precursor to 20th-century literary pre-occupations with nihilism, existentialism, and absurdism. The work includes satires of 19th-century literary figures: Mark Winsome is based on Ralph Waldo Emerson while his \\"practical disciple\\" Egbert is Henry David Thoreau; Charlie Noble is based on Nathaniel Hawthorne; Edgar Allan Poe inspired a beggar in the story.Delbanco, Andrew. Melville, His World and Work. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005: 248. The Confidence-Man was probably inspired by the case of William Thompson, a con artist active in New York City in the late 1840s. ==Character list== * The Mute – A man in cream colors, a tossed look, a linty fair cheek, downy chin, flaxen hair. Looks like a stranger. He writes on a slate an allusion to 1 Corinthians 13. * The Barber – Puts up a sign \\"No Trust\\".

He is the first to be pushed into believing he used to know Mr. John Ringman, but a memory lapse made him forget.

He later discusses pity with its president, drinks too much, then confesses 'charity and hope' are mere dreams. * A Young Episcopal Clergyman – Discusses the genuineness of Guinea, \\"frozen in cold charity\\" then \\"thawed into fluidity\\" and kind words. * A Methodist minister – Very martial looking, accuses the man with the wooden leg of being a 'reprobate and a Canada Thistle'. * A gruff boatman – Asks Guinea to go find anybody to vouch for (Guinea). * John Ringman, the Man with the Weed – He tries to convince the country merchant, Mr. Roberts, they are acquainted, but Robert's memory faltered.

She is said to be cold-hearted, to touch other men in a sly way, to take revenge for jealousy on her daughter. During the divorce procedures, she dragged her husband to court then was awarded his money. Shortly after, she dies. * The sick man – The man is sick and tired of doctors offering ineffective remedies. The herb-doctor tries to convince him, with confidence, his herbs will work. After a philosophical debate about whether nature can be trusted, he agrees to try. * The herb-doctor – Tries to sell \\"Omni-Balsamic-Reinvigorator\\" and \\"Samaritan Pain Dissuader\\". He tries to set the bones of Tom Fry. He gives part of his earnings to 'charity'. He helps the Old Miser to stand during a conversation with the Missourian. * The Dusk Giant – A kind of invalid Titan in homespun. He violently attacks the Herb-Doctor, proclaiming 'there are pains only death can ease'. * His child – The daughter of the Dusk Giant is bi-racial. * Auburn-haired gentleman – Thinks the Herb- Doctor needs unmasking. * An unhappy-looking woman – sobs after the Herb- Doctor asks if anybody needs charity. * A man with a hooked nose – Thinks the Herb-Doctor is a fool for giving away some of his earnings to charity. * A third person with a gossiping expression – Thinks the Herb-Doctor is a 'prowling Jesuit emissary'. * Thomas Fry, aka, Happy Tom, the \\"soldier\\" – A beggar dressed in grimy old regimental coat. He passes off as a veteran of the Mexican wars, but claims his true story is he was crippled in prison while waiting to testify against a rich murderer. The said murderer got off easily because he had friends, whereas Thomas Fry had no friends and was crippled. After he discovers his brother in Indiana died, he took to begging. Confident his story wouldn't arouse any pity, he fakes a different story. * Pitch, The Missourian Bachelor – An eccentric, ursine in aspect. He questions the efficiency of the Herb-Doctor's remedies, proclaiming nature brings about many ills, and is not to be trusted: eye problems, destroyed $10,000 of property, threw hail, and shattered windows, He is skeptical of the goodness of humanity and doesn't have confidence in man: \\"All rascals\\", most are \\"knaves or fools\\". He makes fun of the Old Miser after he is tricked by the Herb-Doctor, argues with the Herb-Doctor about whether nature is good and trustable, then talks about the dishonesty of teenagers with the Agent of the Philosophical Intelligence Office. The latter, however, convinces the Missourian to try hiring a boy at their agency. After the transaction, The Cosmopolitan accosts him, and as he tries to get rid of him, defends his right to be a solitary misanthrope. Throughout the conversation, he shows broad knowledge of \\"philosophy and books\\" equal to his obsession with \\"woodcraft and rifles\\". * The Agent of the Philosophical Intelligence Office – A labor-contractor for teenagers. He tries to convince the Missourian Bachelor he should try the services of the Philosophical Intelligence Office. After the latter objects he had enough of teenagers, the agent makes an analogy between a child not having a beard but a beard will grow later, and a child who hasn't \\"evinced any noble quality\\" will yet \\"sprout\\" these qualities, \\"for, have confidence, it, like the beard, is in him\\". He also likens baby teeth to \\"corrupt qualities\\" in \\"the man-child\\", and \\"the sound, even, beautiful permanent\\" adult teeth to \\"sound, even, beautiful and permanent virtues\\". The baby teeth, like the corrupt qualities are \\"thrust from their place by the independent undergrowth of the succeeding set\\" of teeth or virtues. He also likens a teenager to a caterpillar, and an adult to \\"the natural advance of all creatures\\" - the butterfly. a teenager is like good wine in maturation. Saint Augustine and Ignatius of Loyola are given as examples of virtuous men, rascals in their youth. He succeeds in convincing the Missourian Bachelor to try a fifteen- year-old boy. * The Cosmopolitan, Francis \\"Frank\\" Goodman – A philanthropist, the Cosmopolitan tries to test the ideas of love evoked in the beginning of the book by the Mute, (the references to 1 Corinthians 13), first by arguing with the Missourian one should be warm and confiding with all members of humanity, then by testing the strength of Charlie Nobel's commitment to friendship by asking to borrow money, then by doing the same to the disciple of Mark Winsome, Egbert. The latter test leads to a long debate about whether helping friends leads to an end of their friendship, and if so, how. Finally, the Cosmopolitan convinces the barber momentarily to trust him to pay all the financial losses the barber will accrue for removing the sign \\"no trust\\", then does not pay for the shave. In the final chapters, he has a discussion with the Old Man about a warning in the Bible about \\"an enemy\\" who \\"speaketh sweetly in with his lips\\" but his intention is to tempt, use, and profit from you. * Charles \\"Charlie\\" Arnold Noble – Charlie tells the Cosmopolitan Frank he thinks the Missourian is worse than Colonel John Moredock. Then he tells the story of John Moredock. Then he invites Cosmopolitan Frank to drink together as they discuss the story. Charlie clearly tries to get Frank to drink too much. He agrees to be \\"best friends\\" with Frank, but turns cold after Frank reveals he would like to borrow money from him. Frank brings him back to his normal self by performing a ritual. * Colonel John Moredock – The Indian Hater. He wasted his life taking revenge on Indians for the murder of his family. He is a kind man and a good citizen outside of his revenge sprees. * Charlemont – The protagonist of the integrated fable told by the Cosmopolitan Frank. He is a young merchant of French descent with many friends. One day, he became morose and unfriendly to everyone, vanishes, and isn't heard from for many years. It appears he was bankrupt, but his strange behavior started several months ago. One day, he comes back, friendly and dressed in expensive clothes. Everybody wondered about events, then one friend asks about them several years later. Charlemont knew his ruin was coming, and didn't want to embarrass his friends into helping him, so he shunned them, and moved to Marseilles (France) so he made his fortune again, then returned, confident he wouldn't embarrass his friends. (The Cosmopolitan Frank stresses there is no moral to this story, it is merely an amusement.) * Mark Winsome, The mystic Master – a cold restrained. He accosts the Cosmopolitan Frank to warn him Charlie Noble is \\"an operator\\". He encourages Frank to think about what it must be like to be a rattlesnake. Then he scares an artist-beggar away with a cold stare. His disciple, Egbert, is the example of following his philosophy. * Crazy Italian beggar – A haggard seller of a rhapsodical tract. The Cosmopolitan Frank buys his tract and promises to read it. Mark Winsome, the Mystic Master regards him as a scoundrel. * Egbert – Mark Winsome's disciple. He agrees to do a theoretical exercise with the Cosmopolitan Frank: he pretends to be Frank's \\"best friend\\" Charlie Noble, and plays the scene of Frank asking for money. Egbert, following his master's philosophy, gives several reasons for not lending or giving money, and tells the story of China Aster as an illustration. * China Aster – The protagonist of an integrated fable. He accepts a loan from his friend Orchis with the aim of investing in his business to create more profit. But he doesn't have any business skills, so the money serves to bring about his ruin through unpaid interest on the loan. The devastation is so great, his wife loses her inheritance, his son misses school, and he dies of despair. (The moral of the story -- never accept a loan from a friend.) * Orchis – China Aster's friend. He wins the lottery, then pushes some of it in the form of a loan on his friend. * The Old Man – He sits in the middle of the Gentlemen's cabin, awake while others try to sleep, reading the Bible. He discusses the trustworthiness of the Apocrypha with Cosmopolitan Frank. He buys objects from the peddler-boy. He gets a \\"Counterfeit Detector\\" as a bonus for buying so much, and tries to use it to see if his banknotes are fake. The Detector is complicated. * The man talking in his sleep – A man sleeping in a berth in the Gentlemen's cabin while the Old Man and Cosmopolitan Frank have a discussion. His interjections in his sleep coincide with the subject of the discussion, attributing the quote from The Wisdom of Jesus, Son of Sirach to a description of the confidence man. * The peddler-boy – A boy dressed in rags sells items for protecting one's money from thieves on a steamer: a traveler's lock, a money belt. His sales technique involves showing the uselessness of the object just purchased to sell the next object. All his customers receive a bonus of a \\"Counterfeit Detector\\". ==Adaptations== The novel was turned into an opera by George Rochberg; it was premiered by the Santa Fe Opera in 1982, but was not held to be a success.\\"Lost in the Desert\\", New York Magazine, August 23, 1982 The 2008 movie The Brothers Bloom, starring Adrien Brody, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel Weisz, borrows some of the plot and makes numerous references to the book: One of the characters is named Melville, the steamer ship is named Fidèle, and the initial mark refers to these coincidences. ==References== == Sources == * Milder, Robert.

The dopamine system is associated with reward, attention, short-term memory tasks, planning, and motivation. Dopamine tends to limit and select sensory information arriving from the thalamus to the forebrain. A report from the National Institute of Mental Health says a gene variant that reduces dopamine activity in the prefrontal cortex is related to poorer performance and inefficient functioning of that brain region during working memory tasks, and to a slightly increased risk for schizophrenia. The frontal lobe consists of the prefrontal cortex which is located in the most anterior (farthest away) section of the frontal lobe. It is critical for one’s working memory and executive control which helps keep goals and complex tasks organized. The divisions of the prefrontal cortex include orbital, medical, and lateral prefrontal cortex. Within the lateral prefrontal cortex there are two different divisions: the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is located on top of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and is mainly responsible for the executive control and manipulation of memories that are retrieved through episodic memory. The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex is important for the regulation of meaningful stimuli that a person experiences throughout their lifetime, such as images, letters, and names. Damage to the prefrontal cortex can result in issues with one’s long term and short-term memories, as well as create changes in people’s behaviors and their abilities to plan and organize (Gluck, Mercado, & Myers, 2020). Damage can result from lesions or tumors that have been surgically removed, and traumatic brain injuries (TBI) experienced from a severe hit to the head causing damage to the brain from swelling. Most often a TBI is experienced within a person’s childhood from playing competitive sports or an accident from normal play. Having a traumatic brain injury can increase your chances of developing neurological psychiatric problems and abusing substances, such as cannabis, is known to be a risk factor in developing symptoms associated with schizophrenia (Jain, & Srivastava, 2017). Jain, & Srivastava, (2017) found that the schizophrenia symptoms (hearing voices, talking to people who were not there, etc.) worsened after the usage of cannabis, suggesting that a TBI from childhood can enhance a development of psychosis due to the changes seen in the white matter within the frontal- temporal areas. ==Parietal lobe== The parietal lobe is positioned above the occipital lobe and behind the frontal lobe and central sulcus. The parietal lobe integrates sensory information among various modalities, including spatial sense and navigation (proprioception), the main sensory receptive area for the sense of touch (mechanoreception) in the somatosensory cortex which is just posterior to the central sulcus in the postcentral gyrus,http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~lngbrain/cglidden/parietal.html and the dorsal stream of the visual system. The major sensory inputs from the skin (touch, temperature, and pain receptors), relay through the thalamus to the parietal lobe. Several areas of the parietal lobe are important in language processing. The somatosensory cortex can be illustrated as a distorted figure — the homunculus (Latin: \\"little man\\"), in which the body parts are rendered according to how much of the somatosensory cortex is devoted to them.Schacter, D. L., Gilbert, D. L. & Wegner, D. M. (2009). Psychology. (2nd ed.). New Work (NY): Worth Publishers. The superior parietal lobule and inferior parietal lobule are the primary areas of body or spatial awareness. A lesion commonly in the right superior or inferior parietal lobule leads to hemineglect. ==Occipital lobe== The occipital lobe is the visual processing center of the mammalian brain containing most of the anatomical region of the visual cortex. The primary visual cortex is Brodmann area 17, commonly called V1 (visual one). Human V1 is located on the medial side of the occipital lobe within the calcarine sulcus; the full extent of V1 often continues onto the posterior pole of the occipital lobe. V1 is often also called striate cortex because it can be identified by a large stripe of myelin, the Stria of Gennari. Visually driven regions outside V1 are called extrastriate cortex. There are many extrastriate regions, and these are specialized for different visual tasks, such as visuospatial processing, color differentiation, and motion perception. ==Temporal lobe== The temporal lobe is located beneath the lateral fissure on both cerebral hemispheres of the mammalian brain. The temporal lobe is involved in processing sensory input into derived meanings for the appropriate retention of visual memories, language comprehension, and emotion association. Within the temporal lobe is an area of the brain called the hippocampus which is associated with forming new memories and learning new things. The hippocampus has been studied many times in the past for its correlation with epilepsy showing there to be damage of this area. Although it has been difficult to determine the exact link between the temporal lobe and epilepsy, Chauvière (2020) suggests that there is a positive connection between the circuitry reorganization within the neurons and temporal lobe structure impacting rhythmic activities that are important for cognition. Women are found to have a better verbal memory than men (Berger, Oltmanns, Holtkamp, & Bengner, 2017). However, this study does not support the relationship between temporal lobe structural section and sex differences in memory which leaves researchers questioning the importance of these roles. ==Limbic lobe== The limbic lobe is an arc-shaped region of cortex on the medial surface of each cerebral hemisphere of the mammalian brain, consisting of parts of the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes. The term is ambiguous, with some authors including the paraterminal gyrus, the subcallosal area, the cingulate gyrus, the parahippocampal gyrus, the dentate gyrus, the hippocampus and the subiculum; while the Terminologia Anatomica includes the cingulate sulcus, the cingulate gyrus, the isthmus of cingulate gyrus, the fasciolar gyrus, the parahippocampal gyrus, the parahippocampal sulcus, the dentate gyrus, the fimbrodentate sulcus, the fimbria of hippocampus, the collateral sulcus, and the rhinal sulcus, and omits the hippocampus. ==Insular cortex== The insular cortex is a portion of the cerebral cortex folded deep within the lateral sulcus (the fissure separating the temporal lobe from the parietal and frontal lobes). The insular cortex has an important function for sending axons to the amygdala and responding to tones and somatosensory stimulation (Berret, Kintscher, Palchaudhuri, Tang, Osypenko, Kochubey, & Schneggenburge, 2019) Berret, et. al (2019) used mice to study the fear response that is associated with perceived threats from their memory of previously being shocked on their foot, finding adverse reflex responses in shocking stimulation whenever the insular cortex was silenced. This finding supports that the insular cortex takes information to specific amygdala subdivisions creating different components for fear behaviors (Berret, et. al, 2019). The insulae are believed to be involved in consciousness and play a role in diverse functions usually linked to emotion or the regulation of the body's homeostasis. These functions include perception, motor control, self-awareness, cognitive functioning, and interpersonal experience. In relation to these, it is involved in psychopathology. The insular cortex is divided into two parts: the larger anterior insula and the smaller posterior insula in which more than a dozen field areas have been identified. The cortical area overlying the insula toward the lateral surface of the brain is the operculum (meaning lid). The opercula are formed from parts of the enclosing frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes. ==Additional images== File:Lobes of the brain.jpgInterior view of brain.

The LIS is the node that determines the location of the VoIP terminal. Beyond the NENA architecture and VoIP, the LIS is capable of providing location information to any IP device within its served access network. == The role of the LIS == Distributed systems for locating people and equipment will be at the heart of tomorrow's active offices. Computer and communications systems continue to proliferate in the office and home. Systems are varied and complex, involving wireless networks and mobile computers. However, systems are underused because the choices of control mechanisms and application interfaces are too diverse. It is therefore pertinent to consider which mechanisms might allow the user to manipulate systems in simple and ubiquitous ways, and how computers can be made more aware of the facilities in their surroundings. Knowledge of the location of people and equipment within an organization is such a mechanism. Annotating a resource database with location information allows location-based heuristics for control and interaction to be constructed. This approach is particularly attractive because location techniques can be devised that are physically unobtrusive and do not rely on explicit user action. The article describes the technology of a system for locating people and equipment, and the design of a distributed system service supporting access to that information. The application interfaces made possible by or that benefit from this facility are presented === Location determination === The method used to determine the location of a device in an access network varies between the different types of networks. For a wired network, such as Ethernet or DSL a wiremap method is common. In wiremap location determination, the location of a device is determined by finding which cables are used to send packets to the device. This involves tracing data through aggregation points in the network (such as Ethernet switches, or DSL access nodes) and finding the port that packets for that device are sent to. This information is combined with data available to the LIS (usually extracted from a database) to determine a final location. How this tracing is done then depends on the type of network. In wireless networks, a range of technologies can be applied to location determination, the most basic of which uses the location of the radio transmitter as an approximation. The actual method applied is similar to the wiremap method, if a radio transmitter can be identified, then the location of the device can be given as the position of the transmitter with a region of uncertainty. ==Architecture and protocols== The IETF has defined an architecture and protocols for acquiring location information from a LIS. A LIS in the immediate access network is automatically discovered and location information is retrieved using the HELD protocol. Location information can be retrieved directly—known as by value—or the LIS can generate a temporary URI that can be used to provide location indirectly—known as a location URI. The location information provided by a LIS primarily uses the GEOPRIV format (RFC 4119), an XML representation based on the presence format defined in RFC 3863. RFC 4119 provides a container for both geodetic position and civic address information (now updated by RFC 5139) and also defines elements for expressing a user's privacy preferences. ==References== Category:Computer networking ","title":"Location information server"},{"id":"2566356","text":"The Pen & Pencil Club is a private social club and association of journalists in Philadelphia.

The station and services to Liverpool and are operated by Merseyrail, with Manchester services operated by Northern Trains. ==History== The Liverpool line was originally built in 1848 by the Liverpool, Crosby and Southport Railway to a temporary station at Eastbank Street, about half a mile short of the current terminus. The current station opened as Southport Chapel Street on 22 August 1851, and became the terminus for all trains in 1857, when passenger services were transferred from the adjacent .Gell, Rob (1986). An Illustrated Survey of Railway Stations Between Southport & Liverpool 1848-1986. Heyday Publishing Company, . From 1882 the West Lancashire Railway to Preston Fishergate Hill operated from Southport Derby Road (later known as Southport Central) outside Chapel Street Station. In 1884, another line from Southport to Liverpool was opened: the Cheshire Lines Committee's (CLC) North Liverpool Extension Line from Liverpool Central to Southport Lord Street. The West Lancashire Railway sponsored the Liverpool, Southport and Preston Junction Railway to provide a connection to the CLC line, joining it at . These lines ultimately proved uncompetitive, however, and the Southport services were withdrawn in January 1952.Marshall, J (1981). Forgotten Railways: North West England.

The L&Y; had a large terminus at Southport Chapel Street and could see no sense in operating two termini at very close proximity. On 1 May 1901 the L&Y; completed a remodelling of the approach lines to Southport Central to allow trains to divert onto the Manchester to Southport line and into Southport Chapel Street Station.

Combining the engine and wings of the PAC Cresco with a new large fuselage and modified tail, all versions to date have been powered by a 750 hp (560 kW) Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6 turboprop. It is designed and manufactured in Hamilton, New Zealand by Pacific Aerospace Limited. ==Development== The design made its maiden flight in 2001. As with the Cresco, horizontal tail surfaces presented difficulties, and these were redesigned before the type entered production. The PAC 750 received full US FAA certification in 2004. In 2008 the manufacturer stated production was increasing from 12 to 24 per year. In 2008 there was some New Zealand media criticism of government assistance for the manufacturer following cancellation of a large order. By February 2016, 100 aircraft had been produced, over 120 by Jan 2019. In 2012 Pacific Aerospace achieved certification for the P-750 XSTOL against ICAO Annex 6 for Single Engine IFR Commercial Passenger Transport Operations. Pacific Aerospace has allowed licence production in China. A civil cargo PAC750XL UAV with minimal changes to enable remote piloting has been flown in China. This UAV is not endorsed by the New Zealand manufacturer and is a separate entity. In February 2016, the Papua New Guinea Defence Force signed an agreement to purchase four aircraft. The first was delivered in 2018 to the PNGDF's Air Operations Element. In March 2018, Pacific Aerospace launched an updated variant, the Super-Pac XL, with a 900hp (670kW) PT6A-140A up from 750hp and a four-blade 108in (270cm) Hartzell propeller. It competes with the Supervan 900 re-engined Cessna 208 Caravan with a 900hp Honeywell TPE331 and 110in four-blade Hartzell propeller. A modified P-750 is ground tested, and will begin flights for a second quarter of 2018 certification and later deliveries. To increase payload, a weight- reduction programme for 2020 replaces flight-control surfaces in aluminium by composite, installs lighter seating, and strips out cabin components. The passenger and utility aircraft markets account for 70% of its sales. === F-25 === Financed by UK start-up Arcus Fire, the F-25 is an aerial firefighting variant, scheduled to secure its supplemental type certificate in 2021. The $2.2 million aircraft competes against other types like the Polish PZL Dromader, targeting a 100 units market within five years. The conversion includes a new hydraulics pack, fire gate and a 300 kg (600 lb) increase in payload. ==Design== PAC 750 XL used for skydiving. Meyers-Diver's Airport, Tecumseh, Michigan MAD \\"stinger\\" in Upernavik, Greenland The type was targeted initially to the narrow market of skydiving. In the parachuting role, the high-lift wings from the Cresco and relatively high power-to-weight ratio enable the PAC 750 to take a load of parachutists to 12,000 feet (3,700 m) and return to land in 10 minutes. A wider market was subsequently sought, and examples have been sold for use in utility roles, including freight, agricultural applications, passenger operations, aerial photography and surveying. Twelve aircraft have now been extensively modified for geo-survey work, being fitted with a magnetic anomaly detector sting tail. Proposed ski and float conversions have yet to fly. The P-750 XSTOL is used in South Africa by NatureLink on United Nations Humanitarian Air Services / World Food Programme contracts. While the manufacturer claims lower single-engine running costs than many other utility types, for example, the twin-engined DHC-6 Twin Otter, the type has less usable volume (large cargo panniers providing a partial solution). Due to the unique wing design the P-750 is capable of carrying a higher payload than the larger Cessna 208 Caravan. The aircraft is currently marketed as the P-750 XSTOL. Pacific Aerospace offers the P-750 XSTOL in many configurations - passenger, freight/cargo, skydive, agricultural, aerial survey and surveillance. The aircraft is marketed as excelling on rough, unpaved airstrips and is available with a wide tyre modification for this purpose. A modified version is being developed for counter-insurgency and light attack. For passenger and cargo operations, the cabin can be outfitted with up to nine passenger seats or with cargo holds. There is also an optional 1,000 lb capacity cargo pod available which attaches to the belly of the aircraft. The aircraft can be configured as all-passenger, all-cargo or a combination of both. All variants have double cargo doors at the rear of the cabin. ==North Korean appearance incident== A P-750 XSTOL in the markings of the North Korean state airline was photographed during the Wonsan Air Festival on September 24–25, 2016. The aircraft had been sold to China in September 2017 and then illegally exported to North Korea. Pacific Aerospace expressed surprise, however New Zealand Customs discovered that even after the company was aware the aircraft was in North Korea some of the company staff had planned to sell replacement parts for the aircraft to a Chinese company. In October 2017 Pacific Aerospace plead guilty to three charges of planning to export aircraft parts indirectly to North Korea, and another charge relating to incorrect completion of export documentation. ==Specifications== right right ==See also== Flight deck ==References* 750XL Category:2000s New Zealand civil utility aircraft Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Low-wing aircraft Category:Single-engined turboprop aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 2001 Category:STOL aircraft ","title":"PAC P-750 XSTOL"},{"id":"2566408","text":"Pachpadra is a village in Barmer district in Indian state of Rajasthan.

The characters “天書” do not appear anywhere in the book. A Book from the Sky () is the title of a book produced by Chinese artist Xu Bing in the style of fine editions from the Song and Ming dynasties, but filled entirely with meaningless glyphs designed to resemble traditional Chinese characters.Two of the characters were later found by Charles Stone to coincide with attested Chinese characters; however, one of these was itself a 9th-century forgery The book, which consists of four volumes totaling 604 pages, was printed in a single print run of 126 copies between 1987 and 1991, and was first publicly exhibited in October 1988, in Beijing's China Art Gallery. The work was originally titled Mirror to Analyze the World: The Century’s Final Volume (), a title which “evokes the trope of the book as jian 鍳 or mirror in the venerable tradition of imperial historiography”. However, the artist eventually felt that this title was “cumbersome” and “heavily influenced by Western forms and the current cultural climate”, and decided to adopt the name that was already in popular use, Tiānshū. In Chinese, the term tiān shū (“divine writing”) originally referred to certain kinds of religious texts, but is now used to mean “gibberish”; it has thus been suggested that Nonsense Writing would be a more appropriate translation of the title. ==Production== The book is composed using a set of 4,000 characters, as this is roughly the number of characters in common usage in modern written Chinese. These characters were designed on the basis of the Kangxi radicals, so that “in terms of density of strokes and frequency of occurrence, they… appear, on the page, to be real characters“. In addition to these, page and fascicle numbers were indicated using tally marks based on the Chinese character 正. The characters were carved into individual pieces of movable type made from pear wood, in a style slightly squatter than that of Song typefaces. Initially, Xu himself typeset sample pages, and took them for printing to a factory in the village of Hányíng (), in Cǎiyù township (). (This was one of the last remaining traditional printing factories in China, which after the Cultural Revolution mainly produced state-sponsored reprints of classical texts using pre-Revolution woodblocks.) Later, workers at the factory typeset the pages by referring to a “model book” prepared by Xu, which contained symbols such as ↓★○☒❖ that had been placed in a one-to-one correspondence with his 4,000 pseudo-Chinese characters. ==Reactions== Critical reactions to Book from the Sky were initially dismissive. In 1990, an article in a Beijing newspaper, said to have been authored by an agent of the Ministry of Culture, described it as “ghosts building walls” (), i.e., obfuscation for the sake of obfuscation. Meanwhile, “New Wave” artists found it too “traditional and academic”. Nevertheless, the 1988 exhibition of the book at the China Art Gallery attracted a broad audience that included not only artists, but also professors and editors, some of whom visited the exhibition repeatedly in an attempt to find even a single real Chinese character. Later critics viewed the work more positively. Book from the Sky is considered to be a representative of the “1985 Fine Arts New Wave” (), and has been interpreted as “a primary symbol of the broad liberalization movement that characterized the years prior to the Tiananmen massacre”. It has also invited comparisons with James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake, as “a radical challenge to how we think about language, writing, literacy, and human-machine relationship”. However, according to Xu, his main purpose was to “expose the fact that Chinese literary culture is 討厭 taoyan”: ‘boring’ or ‘tedious’. In later works such as Square Word Calligraphy and Book from the Ground, he takes this idea further by subverting the logographic nature of the Chinese script in ways that make it broadly accessible. ==Notes== ==References== * * ==External links== *Description on Xu Bing’s website *Blog post mentioning A Book from the Sky, with photographs Category:Art exhibitions in China Category:1988 books Category:Chinese characters Category:Artists' books ","title":"A Book from the Sky"},{"id":"2566419","text":"The Black River is a tributary of the White River, about long,AllRefer.com in southeastern Missouri and northeastern Arkansas in the United States.

His publications on these themes include Uncle Sam and Us: Globalization, Neoconservatism and the Canadian State, published in 2002; and Global Governance and the Semi-peripheral State: The WTO and NAFTA as Canada's External Constitution in Governing under Stress: Middle Powers and the Challenge of Globalization\\". Clarkson had taught and written on Canadian foreign policy and federal party politics. Following an unsuccessful campaign as Liberal candidate for the mayoralty of Toronto in 1969, Clarkson was active in the Liberal Party for six years. After Pierre Trudeau’s retirement from politics in 1984, Clarkson spent a decade co- authoring the book, Trudeau and Our Times, with his wife Christina McCall, which won the Governor General's Award for non-fiction. Clarkson's knowledge and experience in Canadian politics led to the commissioning of a history of federal election campaigns in Canada from 1974 onward. These essays were the basis of his 2005 book, The Big Red Machine: How the Liberal Party Dominates Canadian Politics. Clarkson was renowned for his teaching, receiving many teaching awards in his tenure at the University of Toronto. He was a great encourager of “the engaged” life, taking his students on extra-curricular field studies to Washington, D.C. and Mexico, and urging them to resist the world around them if they felt so inclined. Clarkson was a frequent commentator of Canadian politics, in both English and French. A lover of languages, he was also proficient in Spanish, German, Russian and Italian. Clarkson earned a B.A. from the University of Toronto, an M.A. from New College, Oxford, and a D. de Rech. from the University of Paris. He was a Senior Fellow at Massey College, a Senior Fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI) in Waterloo, Ontario and, in 2004, was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. In 2010, he was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada. Clarkson's first wife was then broadcaster and future Governor General of Canada Adrienne Clarkson with whom he had two daughters, Kyra and Blaise. His second wife was the late political writer Christina McCall. McCall adopted his two daughters, and he adopted her daughter Ashley. Clarkson died in Germany of pneumonia which had developed into sepsis, while on a research trip with his students. He is survived by wife Nora Born, whom he married in 2014. ==Bibliography== * 1970 L'analyse soviétique des problèmes indiens du sous-développement, 1955-1964 * 1972 City lib: parties and reform * 1978 The Soviet theory of development: India and the Third World in Marxist-Leninist scholarship * 1982 Canada and the Reagan challenge: crisis in the Canadian-American relationship * 1990 Trudeau and Our Times: Volume 1: The Magnificent Obsession (with Christina McCall) * 1994 Trudeau and Our Times: Volume 2: The Heroic Delusion (with Christina McCall) * 1998 Fearful asymmetries: the challenge of analyzing continental systems in a globalizing world * 1999 The canonical compendium * 2000 \\"Apples and oranges\\": prospects for the comparative analysis of the EU and NAFTA as continental systems * 2001 After the catastrophe: Canada's position in North America * 2002 Lockstep in the continental ranks: redrawing the American perimeter after September 11th * 2002 Uncle Sam and Us: Globalization, Neoconservatism, and the Canadian State * 2005 Big Red Machine: How the Liberal Party Dominates Canadian Politics * 2008 Does North America Exist?: Governing the Continent after NAFTA and 9/11 * 2010 A Perilous Imbalance: The Globalization of Canadian Law and Governance (with Stepan Wood) * 2011 Dependent America?

It is usually sung in Hebrew, literary Hebrew, or colloquial Arabic.Horowitz, Amy (1999) The literal translation of Mizrahi from Hebrew is \\"Eastern\\". ==Emergence of Mizrahi music== ===Background=== Mizrahi Jews who immigrated from the Arab countries have, over the last 50 years, created a unique musical style that combines elements of Arabic, Turkish, and Greek music. This is not to be confused with the New Hebrew Style, as the Mizrahit style is more spontaneous.Regev and Seroussi (2004), pp 191-235 After World War II, many Jewish families made aliyah to the new state of Israel, founded in 1948. The Muzika Mizrahit movement started in the 1950s with homegrown performers in neighborhoods with a high concentration of Jews from Arab countries who would play at weddings and other events. They performed songs in Hebrew, but in an Arabic style, on traditional Arabic instruments—the oud, kanun, and the darbuka. In the 1960s, they added acoustic and electric guitar to their sound and so their sound became more eclectic. Vocalists usually decorated their singing with trills, and delivery was often nasal or guttural in sound. Intonation was typically Western, however; singers did not use the quartertone scales typical of Arabic music. Into the 1980s synthesizers and electronic instruments made their debut in Mizrahi music.Horowitz, Amy (2010), \\"Mediterranean Israeli Music and the Politics of the Aesthetic pp 1-155 Lyrics were originally texts taken from classic Hebrew literature, including poems by medieval Hebrew poets. Later they added texts by Israeli poets, and began writing original lyrics as well. An example is the song \\"Hanale Hitbalbela\\" (Hannale was confused), sung by Yizhar Cohen. The lyrics are by the modern Israeli poet and lyricist Natan Alterman, to a traditional tune. Singers also translated childhood favorites from Arabic to Hebrew and added electronics and a faster tempo.Friedman, Thomas (1987), “Using Songs, Israelis Touch Arab Feelings” pp 1-3 ===The 1970s and onward=== Two of the first popular Mizrahi musicians were Zohar Argov and Avihu Medina. Argov grew up singing in his synagogue with a very defined Middle Eastern melisma. His definitive Mizrahi hit was Haperah BeGani (פרח בגני) (\\"Flower in my Garden\\").Regev, Motti (1996), “Musica Mizrakhit, Israeli Rock and National Culture in Israel” pp 275-284 After his suicide he became an icon in Israel for what happens when one is cheated by society and a political activist. A play ha-Melekh was written about his life story, portrayed his fall to drugs and his troubles with the law. It was extremely popular.Horowitz, Amy (2010) Avihu Medina was a singer and composer. He composed many popular hits for Argov. Women also began to play a significant part in popular Mizrahi music. A popular artist was Zehava Ben. Because of her ties to Morocco and the Middle East she began her career singing Umm Kulthum.Horowitz, Amy (2010) Because Mediterranean Israeli music was so popular within the Eastern Jewish communities, which were quickly becoming a large percentage of Israel, the natural outcome would be a continuous playback on the local radio station. However the national government restricted the play of Mizrahi music because it was not considered ‘authentic Israeli.’ The social researcher, Sami Shalom Chetrit, wrote \\"The educational and cultural establishment made every effort to separate the second generation of eastern immigrants from this music, by intense socialization in schools and in the media,\\".Chetrit (2004) The penetration of Muzika Mizrahit into the Israeli mainstream was the result of pressure by Mizrahi composers and producers such as Avihu Medina, the overwhelming, undeniable popularity of the style, and the gradual adoption of elements of Muzika Mizrahit by popular Israeli artists. Yardena Arazi, one of Israel's most popular stars, made a recording in 1989 called \\"Dimion Mizrahi\\" (Eastern Imagination), and included original materials and some canonical Israeli songs. The acceptance of Muzika Mizrahit, over the 1990s, parallels the social struggle of Israelis of Sephardic and Mizrahi origin to achieve social and cultural acceptance. \\"Today, the popular Muzika Mizrahit has begun to erase the differences from rock music, and we can see not a few artists turning into mainstream. This move to the mainstream culture includes cultural assimilation,\\" writes literary researcher and critic Mati Shmuelof.Shmuelof (2006) It is a widely accepted fact by now that the invention of the recordable cassette by the Philips Corporation and the commercial cassette distribution network in the Tel Aviv train station had a large impact on the popularity of Mediterranean Israeli music. Cassettes allowed the Mizrahi population create and distribute their own music within their communities. They also allowed for more musical integration. One could have Umm Kulthum and a neighbor who is an emerging singer. Cassette tapes were a predominant factor in the growth of Mediterranean Israeli music in the 1970s. After first being a favorite at community celebrations, such as weddings and birthdays, the recording of one particular wedding party became a desired commodity in the Mizrahi ma'abarot (\\"transit camp\\"). These cassettes are what caused ethnomusicologist Amy Horowitz to start researching this blossoming new music style.Horowitz, Amy (2010) After Reuveni's friends and neighbors started offering to buy the cassettes he realized he might have a great opportunity on his hands.Horowtiz, Amy (1999) He and his brother later went on to become one of the major Mizrahi cassette companies in Israel. ==Fusion genres== Over time fusions of Mizrahi music with other genres emerged, including oriental rock, hip hop, and pop. ===Rock and Metal=== Rock Mizrahi (\\"oriental rock\\") is a wide term that incorporates several different Israeli musical styles. It is defined by the combining of rock music with middle eastern instruments, compositions and singing techniques. Comparison may be drawn with progressive rock, as Middle Eastern scales and rhythm tend to break western norms. Some examples are Orphaned Land, Knesiyat Hasekhel, Algir and lead singer Aviv Guedj, Yosi Sassi and Dudu Tassa. Another notable examples is Fortisakharof, a creative duo consisting of Rami Fortis and Berry Sakharof. Both Fortis and Sakharof have partial Mizrachi backgrounds (Turkish and Iraqi). The oriental elements in their music range from very subtle to very apparent at times. The two began their project in 1989 following the break up of Post Punk group Minimal Compact. Both groups feature several Middle Eastern themes, including one song in Gibberish Arabic, \\"Sandanya\\", from their debut LP Foreign Affair. The fusion of Mizrahi music and metal music can be defined as oriental metal. Other sub genres of Rock rarely categorize their oriental influences. ===Pop=== By the mid 1990s, Mizrahi Pop labels had already began to transform from underground operations distributing cassettes within the Mizrahi community to a much more formal and standardized Music Industry. Musicians and producers of that time were starting to incorporate more elements of Rock, Techno, Electronic dance music, Europop and R&B;, while still strongly emphasizing the Greek, Turkish and Arab roots. Along with earlier examples like Ofra Haza and Ethnix, later acts like Zehava Ben, Eyal Golan, Sarit Hadad and others revolutionized the genre and brought it to much larger audiences. Some songs of this era had already become hits in neighboring countries, including Greece and Arab countries. Mizrahi Pop became a target to mockery and often disregarded by the mainstream pop culture of Israel at the time. Although demographically they may have been equally popular, most radio stations were refusing to play Mizrachi Pop, favoring American and European influenced pop and rock. The distinction between Mizrahi pop and the mainstream was clear. With many Mizrachi Pop hit singles still being low budget productions, mainstream critics and media were mostly ignoring the genre, with the excuse of Mizrachi Pop lacking artistic depth. Most songs were rather straight forward love songs, translations of Greek/Mediterranean songs or jewish themed songs, with songwriting following a certain formula. This is why comparisons to other global \\"counterculture turned mainstream movements\\" are less appropriate, with Hip Hop and Reggae music being highly innovative, as well as political and protest oriented. However it is widely agreed upon that many Mizrachi Pop songs do have a lot more in them than it first seems, so perhaps many of them were to some extent misunderstood for being ahead of their time. There were also many cases of mutual influencing of the two movements in Israeli Pop as early as 1985, with some well known Ashkenazi songwriters admiring the Mizrahi sound. During the 2000s and 2010, Mizrahi Pop has grown to become the most prominent form of pop music in Israel. In 2019, singer Omer Adam sold a record breaking 50,000 tickets in Hayarkon Park, surpassing the previous record held by Kaveret for largest concert in Israel. ==Well-known Mizrahi singers== * Jo Amar (1930–2009) (Moroccan Jew) * Zohar Argov (1955–1987) (Yemenite Jew) * Avihu Medina (Yemenite Jew) * Daklon (Yemenite Jew) * Haim Moshe (Yemenite Jew) * Tzion Golan (Yemenite Jew) * Ofra Haza (1957–2000) (Yemenite Jew) * Shimi Tavori (Yemenite Jew) * Eyal Golan (Yemenite Jew / Moroccan Jew) * Sarit Hadad (Mountain Jew) * Moshik Afia (Lebanese Jew) * Dudu Aharon (Yemenite Jew) * Zehava Ben (Moroccan Jew) * Amir Benayoun (Moroccan Jew) * Gad Elbaz (Moroccan Jew) * Maya Buskila (Moroccan Jew) * Itzik Kala (Kurdish Jew) * Yishai Levi (Yemenite Jew) * Miri Mesika (Tunisian Jew / Iraqi Jew) * Ninet Tayeb (Tunisian Jew / Moroccan Jew) * Bo'az Ma'uda (Yemenite Jew) * Lior Narkis (Serbian Jew (Greek-Tunisian ancestry) / Iraqi Jew) * Avi Peretz (Moroccan Jew) * Kobi Peretz (Moroccan Jew) * Moshe Peretz (Moroccan Jew / Iraqi Jew) * Nasrin Kadri (Arab Jew) * Yehuda Saado * Shlomi Shabat (Turkish Jew) * Pe'er Tasi (Yemenite Jew) * Margalit Tzan'ani (Yemenite Jew) * Idan Yaniv (Bukharian Jew / Indian Jew) * Kobi Oz (Tunisian Jew) * Liora Itzhak (Indian Jew) * Moti Taka (Ethiopian Jew) * Moran Mazor (Georgian Jew) * Omer Adam (Mountain Jew) ==See also== * Coma Dance Festival * Arabic music ==References== ==Further reading== * ISRAEL’S HAPPINESS REVOLUTION: What my preschooler’s taste in Mizrahi pop says about where the country is at by Matti Friedman August 31, 2015, Tablet (magazine). ==External links== *Israeli Music Portal *A Taste of Jewish Music from the Sephardi World *mizrahi music *The Sephardic Pizmonim Project * Haaretz *Linda, Linda by Haim Moshe *Elinor by Zohar Argoz Category:Israeli music Category:Mizrahi Jewish culture Category:World music genres Category:Jewish music genres ","title":"Mizrahi music"},{"id":"2566470","text":"Torah Jane Bright (born 27 December 1986) is an Australian professional snowboarder.

It started out as a royal custom, but, in British America, it later came to refer to a reception by the king’s representatives and, even later, by the president. ==History== ===France=== In Einhard's Life of Charlemagne, the author recounts the Emperor's practice, when he was dressing and putting on his shoes, to invite his friends to come in and, in case of a dispute brought to his attention, \\"he would order the disputants to be brought in there and then, hear the case as if he were sitting in tribunal and pronounce a judgement.\\"Einhard, Life of Charlemagne, §24. By the second half of the sixteenth century, it had become a formal event, requiring invitation.Elliott, J.H. Europe Divided 1559-1998, Fontana History of Europe (New York: Harper Torchbooks 1968) p.70 In 1563 Catherine de' Medici wrote in advice to her son, the King of France, to do as his father (Henry II) had done and uphold the practice of lever. Catherine describes that Henry II allowed his subjects, from nobles to household servants, to come in while he dressed. She states this pleased his subjects and improved their opinion of him.Letter to the King (8 September 1563?) LCM. Vol. II, p. 90, cited in Potter, David, The French Wars of Religion: Selected Documents (New York 1997) p. 14 This practice was raised to a ceremonial custom at the court of King Louis XIV. In the court etiquette that Louis formalised, the set of extremely elaborate conventions was divided into the grand lever, attended by the full court in the gallery outside the king's bedchamber, and the petit lever that transpired in degrees in the king's chamber, where only a very select group might serve the king as he rose and dressed. In fact, the king had often risen early and put in some hours hunting before returning to bed for the start of the lever. Louis's grandson, King Philip V of Spain, and his queen typically spent all morning in bed, as reported by Saint-Simon, to avoid the pestering by ministers and courtiers that began with the lever. The king's retiring ceremony proceeded in reverse order and was known as the coucher. The successors of Louis XIV were not as passionate about the Sun King's daily routine and, over time, the frequency of the lever and coucher decreased, much to the dismay of their courtiers.Official website of the Palace of Versailles ===Great Britain=== Charles Wild (1816) St James's Palace, Queen's Levee Room When the court of Charles II of England adopted the custom, first noted as an English usage in 1672,Oxford English Dictionary: \\"Levée\\". it was called a levée. In the 18th century, as the fashionable dinner hour was incrementally moved later into the afternoon,Sherrie McMillan, \\"What Time is Dinner?\\" History Magazine on-line). the morning reception of the British monarch, attended only by gentlemen, was shifted back towards noon. The practice of holding court levées was continued by the British Monarchy until 1939. These took the form of a formal reception at St James's Palace at which officials, diplomats, and military officers of all three armed services, were presented individually to the sovereign. Full dress uniform or court dress was worn by all participants, who formed a queue in the Throne Room before stepping forward when their names and ranks were called. Each then bowed to the king who was seated on a dais with male members of his family, officials of the Royal Household and senior officers behind him. ====Levees in the British Empire and Commonwealth==== Levée ceremonies were held by regal representatives of the British Empire, such as the Viceroy of India, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, governors general and state/provincial governors/lieutenant governors. The ceremonial event continues to be held in a number of Commonwealth countries. The New Year's levee is still held on New Year's Day in Canada, by the Governor General of Canada, the lieutenant governors, the Canadian Armed Forces, and various municipalities across the country. ===United States=== By the 1760s, the custom was being copied by the colonial governors in British America, but was abandoned in the United States following the American Revolutionary War. Beginning in 1789, President George Washington and First Lady Martha Washington held weekly public gatherings and receptions at the presidential mansion that were called levees. Designed to give the public access to the president and to project a dignified public image of the presidency, they were continued by John and Abigail Adams, but were discarded in 1801 by Thomas Jefferson. ==Louis XIV's lever== The ceremony at VersaillesThe ceremonies were abbreviated when the king was at Marly or one of his other occasional retreats, providing a sense of intimacy that was only comparative, but engendering struggles among courtiers to be invited on such occasions, precisely the kind of competition Louis fostered. has been described in detail by Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon. Louis XIV was a creature of habit and the inflexible routine that tired or irritated his heirs served him well. Wherever the king had actually slept, he was discovered sleeping in the close-curtained state bed standing in its alcove, which was separated from the rest of the chambre du roi by a gilded balustrade.The comparison with the communion rail that separated the sanctuary in a church was not unintentional. The chambre du roi marked the centre of the château de Versailles. He was woken at eight o'clock by his head valet de chambre —Alexandre Bontemps held this post for most of the reign — who alone had slept in the bedchamber. The chief physician, the chief surgeon and Louis' childhood nurse, as long as she lived, all entered at the same time, and the nurse kissed him. The night chamberpot was removed. ===Grande entrée=== The second scene of William Hogarth's A Rake's Progress (1732-33) showing the wealthy Tom at his morning levée in London, attended by musicians and other hangers-on all dressed in expensive costumes. Surrounding Tom from left to right: a music master at a harpsichord, who was supposed to represent George Frideric Handel; a fencing master; a quarterstaff instructor; a dancing master with a violin; a landscape gardener Charles Bridgeman; an ex-soldier offering to be a bodyguard; a bugler of a fox hunt club. At lower right is a jockey with a silver trophy. Then the curtains of the bed were drawn once again and, at a quarter past eight, the Grand Chamberlain was called, bringing with him the nobles who had the privilege of the grande entrée, a privilege that could be purchased, subject to the king's approval, but which was restricted in Louis' time to the nobles. The King remained in bed, in his nightshirt and a short wig. The Grand Chamberlain of France or, in his absence, the Chief Gentleman of the Bedchamber presented holy water to the king from a vase that stood at the head of the bed and the king's morning clothes were laid out. First, the Master of the Bedchamber and the First Servant, both high nobles, pulled the king's nightshirt over his head, one grasping each sleeve. The Grand Chamberlain presented the day shirt which, according to Saint-Simon, had been shaken out and sometimes changed, because the king perspired freely. This was a moment for any of those with the privilege of the grande entrée to have a swift private word with the king, which would have been carefully rehearsed beforehand to express a request as deferentially, but in as few words as possible. The King was given a missal and the gentlemen retired into the adjoining chambre du conseil (the \\"council chamber\\") while there was a brief private prayer for the King. ===Première entrée=== When the King had them recalled, now accompanied by those who had the lesser privilege of the première entrée, his process of dressing began. Louis preferred to dress himself \\"for he did almost everything himself, with address and grace\\", Saint- Simon remarked. The King was handed a dressing-gown, and a mirror was held for him, for he had no toilet table like ordinary gentlemen. Every other day the King shaved himself. Now, other privileged courtiers were admitted, a few at a time, at each stage, so that, as the King was putting on his shoes and stockings, \\"everyone\\" — in Saint-Simon's view — was there. This was the entrée de la chambre, which included the king's readers and the director of the Menus Plaisirs, that part of the royal establishment in charge of all preparations for ceremonies, events and festivities, to the last detail of design and order. At the entrée de la chambre were admitted the Grand Aumônier and the Marshal of France and the king's ministers and secretaries. A fifth entrée now admitted ladies for the first time, and a sixth entrée admitted, from a privileged position at a cramped backdoor, the king's children, legitimate and illegitimate indiscriminately — in scandalous fashion Saint-Simon thought — and their spouses. The crowd in the chambre du Roi can be estimated from Saint-Simon's remark of the King's devotions, which followed: the King knelt at his bedside \\"where all the clergy present knelt, the cardinals without cushions, all the laity remaining standing\\". The King then passed into the cabinet where all those who possessed any court office attended him. He then announced what he expected to do that day and was left alone with those among his favourites of the royal children born illegitimately (whom he had publicly recognised and legitimatedThese eventually were five in all.) and a few favourites, with the valets. These were less pressing moments to discuss projects with the King, who parcelled out his attention with strict regard for the current standing of those closest to him. Le Lever, engraving by Louis Romanet (1742–1810), after Sigmund Freudenberg (1745-1801) ===Grand lever=== With the entry of the King into the Grande Galerie, where the rest of the court awaited him, the petit lever was finished, and with the grand lever the day was properly begun, as the king proceeded to daily Mass, sharing brief words as he progressed and even receiving some petitions. It was of these occasions that the King habitually remarked, in refusing a favour asked for some noble, \\"We never see him\\", meaning that he did not spend enough time at Versailles, where Louis wanted to keep the nobility penned up, to prevent them interesting themselves in politics. ==For the aristocracy== Among the aristocracy, the levée could also become a crowded and social occasion, especially for women, who liked to put off the donning of their uncomfortable formal clothes, and whose hair and perhaps make-up needed prolonged attention. There is a famous depiction of the levée of an 18th-century Viennese lady of the court in Richard Strauss's later opera Der Rosenkavalier, where she has her hair dressed while surrounded by a disorderly crowd of tradesmen touting for work or payment, and other petitioners, followed by a visit from a cousin. The second scene of William Hogarth's A Rake's Progress shows a male equivalent in 1730s London. In the French engraving Le Lever after Freudenberg, of the 1780s (illustration, right), gentle social criticism is levelled at the lady of the court; that she slept without unlacing her stays, apparently, perhaps can be seen as artistic licence. Her maids dress her with deference, while the wallclock under the hangings of her lit à la polonaise appears to read noon. ==In popular culture== In Sophia Coppola's Marie Antoinette the levée of the French queen, during the reigns of Louis XV and XVI is represented. ==Notes== ==References== * * Norbert Elias, The Court Society (1969) translation 1983 pp. 78–104.

It is used to effect an emergency stop where traction is limited to reduce the effect of skidding from road wheels locking up under braking. This can be a particular problem when different tires have different traction, such as on patchy ice for example. Its use in an emergency requires a presence of mind that the situation itself might preclude. Cadence braking is supposed to maximize the time for the driver to steer around the obstacle ahead, as it allows the driver to steer while slowing. It needs to be learned and practiced. For most drivers of modern cars, it has been entirely superseded by ABS, however it is still a valuable skill for drivers of non-ABS equipped vehicles such as classic cars. Maximum braking force is obtained when there is approximately 10–20% slippage between the braked wheel's rotational speed and the road surface.Tyre-road friction and tyre slip Beyond this point, rolling grip diminishes rapidly and sliding friction provides a greater proportion of the force that slows the vehicle. Due to local heating and melting of the tyres, the sliding friction can be very low. When braking at, or beyond, the peak braking force the steering is ineffective since the grip of the tyre is entirely consumed in braking the vehicle. Anti-lock braking system performs these operations automatically many times per second in rapid succession. A human driver can perform one lock-release cycle per second with practice. This is done primarily to maintain steering control, at least in part. In wet, hard surfaces, this is useful to reduce somewhat total braking distance. When ABS is present the best emergency stop will usually be obtained by simply pressing very hard on the brakes, forcing the ABS to perform, and steering to avoid the obstacles ahead. Cadence braking (or any other type of braking) will not help much on extremely slippery surfaces such as ice (in theory it would, but in practice the ice can be so slippery that it makes little difference—a winter tyre would make more difference). Also, on very loose surfaces, a quicker stop can be achieved by simply locking the wheels, causing a wedge of loose material to build up ahead of the wheelsAutomotive Brakes By Jack Erjavec p359 \\"A locked tire allows a small wedge of snow to build up ahead of it, which allows it to stop in a shoreter distance thana rolling tire.\\" and create a substantial braking force. This is useful only when stopping in a straight line, because locking the wheels means all steering control would be lost. In such conditions, ABS actually increases the stopping distances. On poor surfaces, in the past, rally drivers timed the pulsing of brake application so as to take advantage of the load transfer as the vehicle pitches forwards and backwards in response to the initial braking effort. With modern, over-dampened, and stiffly sprung suspensions this is less likely to be effective. While cadence braking is effective on most surfaces, it is less effective at slowing the vehicle than keeping the tires continually at the optimum braking point which is called threshold braking. The latter is an expert driving technique that is even more difficult to learn than cadence braking, and again has been largely superseded by ABS. Threshold braking, or a good ABS, generally results in the shortest stopping distance in a straight line. ABS, cadence and interference braking are intended to preserve steering control while braking. ==References== ==External links== Category:Driving techniques Category:Motorcycle dynamics ","title":"Cadence braking"},{"id":"2566571","text":"Wolfgang Bauer (18 March 1941 - 26 August 2005) was an Austrian writer best known as a playwright who, particularly in his younger days, was regarded as an enfant terrible by the Austrian cultural establishment. ==Life and career== Bauer was born in Graz, Styria. His breakthrough play was Magic Afternoon in 1967, in which he portrays four youths who interrupt their lazy and boring afternoon by unmotivated outbreaks of violence and aggression (Magic Afternoon was adapted for the screen most recently by Catherine Jelski in 2000 as The Young Unknowns). After two more successes, Change (1969) and Gespenster (Ghosts, 1973), Bauer's plays became increasingly surreal and experimental. Bauer though resisted any labelling by academia and critics alike until his death. Most of his plays during 1967 and 1990 were translated into English by Martin Esslin, remembered for coining the term Theatre of the Absurd. In the late 1970s and early 1980s San Francisco's Magic Theatre performed a play of Bauer's almost every season. In 1993 his play Tadpoletigermosquitos at Mulligan's was premiered at New York's Ohio Theatre. Wolfgang Bauer was a heavy smoker and drinker. After a series of cardiac operations, he died in his native Graz of heart failure. His friend, the composer Kurt Schwertsik wrote Ein Kleines Requiem partly for him. ==Works== Bauer's plays have been translated into 24 languages and have been performed in 35 countries.

The screenplay by Mari Kornhauser steals liberally from Émile Zola's 1867 novel and 1873 play Thérèse Raquin. Although the film played theatrically in some countries, it was released straight to video in the United States. The film received negative reviews. ==Plot== Zandalee Martin is a young boutique store owner living in New Orleans who is sexually frustrated and feeling unfulfilled with her marriage to Thierry Martin, and eventually gets tangled in a passionate, sensual and torrid adulterous affair with her husband's mysterious and free spirited old friend Johnny Collins. Zandalee and Thierry's marriage has hit a snag and seems to be eroding due to his lack of passion. Zan needs to explore, while Thierry wants to withdraw, and has become more and more distant and impotent in their relationship. He used to be a poet, but now has taken over the family's communications business after the death of his father. As time goes on, Thierry has to sell the business and become basically a (vice president) figurehead. He is emotionally adrift as his dreams give way to disillusionment. Johnny, an artist painter by trade, has been working for Thierry's business to help support his paintings. His only religion is self- gratification. Johnny also sells and mules cocaine for a local drug dealer as another source of income for himself. Having not seen each other in a while, the two run into each other at a bachelor's party. After the party, Thierry brings Johnny home to meet Zandalee and his grandmother Tatta (Viveca Lindfors). While talking about old times, Johnny offers to paint a portrait of Thierry at their home. Later, in another scene, after finishing the painting, Johnny shows it to Thierry, Zandalee and Tatta. While they go off to other rooms and sensing Zandalee's frustration and vulnerability, Johnny makes a pass at her. Johnny continues to pursue Zandalee and when they run into each other during a rain storm, he takes advantage and moves in by seducing her, first in his loft in an angry passionate scene, (Zan's wedding ring is on the table next to the bed) which is followed by him erotically finger painting her. Their sexual liaisons continue to occur in various places including her laundry room a top a washing machine while Thierry and guests are having dinner. Thierry soon suspects the two are having an affair. As the affair intensifies, Johnny meets Zandalee in a church and asks her to leave her husband. However, Zandalee feels that she must never abandon her true love Thierry, and quickly ends her affair with Johnny after he forces himself on her in the confessional. She and Thierry re-commit themselves to each other, but Johnny, now obsessed with her, will not be brushed off that easily. He tracks them to their vacation spot in the Bayou. All of this puts the three on a destructive collision course with a tragic sequence of events. When Thierry figures out that Johnny has indeed been having an affair with Zandalee, he becomes drunk and confrontational (he pulls a gun out) leading to him becoming reckless when he takes Zan and Johnny for a speedboat ride on the Bayou, which ends when he falls off the boat and drowns, refusing to be saved by either Zan or Johnny who dive into the water to save him. Both Zandalee and Johnny become distraught by Thierry's death and begin to isolate themselves with Zan jogging for long periods and Johnny trying to work on his paintings, but becoming more self-destructive. In one scene, Johnny, in a rage rips up some of his paintings and pours black paint all over himself. He also consumes some of the cocaine he is supposed to sell, which gets him in trouble with his supplier. When Johnny meets with Zandalee with the hopes to restart their romance and have a possible future together now that Thierry is out of the picture, she remains emotionally distant and instead goes for a walk along the Old Quarter with Johnny following her. But in the final scene, when Johnny's drug supplier attempts to kill him in a drive-by shooting outside the church that Zandalee frequents, she sees what is about to happen and shields Johnny, getting fatally shot in the process. The drug dealer flees from the scene of the crime (saying \\"you've got to make accounts payable man\\"), leaving behind Johnny, now alone, as he cradles and holds Zandalee's dead body. The movie ends with him walking in front of the church with the lifeless Zandalee in his arms. ==Cast== * Nicolas Cage as Johnny Collins * Judge Reinhold as Thierry Martin * Erika Anderson as Zandalee Martin * Viveca Lindfors as Tatta * Aaron Neville as Jack * Joe Pantoliano as Gerri * Marisa Tomei as Remy * Steve Buscemi as OPP Man * Ian Abercrombie as Louis Medina * Zach Galligan as Rog ==Release== Zandalee was released in the United States on July 18, 1991 as a video premiere. Other countries releasing the film were Germany, on May 9, 1991, the United Kingdom on May 10, 1991, Hong Kong on May 16, 1991, the Netherlands on November 15, 1991 and Australia on February 13, 1992. ===Rating=== Originally rated NC-17 by the Motion Picture Association of America, Zandalee had its rating surrendered before release. There is both the original \\"unrated and uncut\\" version and an \\"R rated\\" version. The international version has a few more scenes which help explain the characters a bit better than the U.S. versions. Some versions have enhanced color as well. One German version of the movie was titled Love Affair, but it is the same movie. According to the May 1991 issue of Premiere magazine, the movie was originally called Adios, then Adios Thierry, and finally it was settled on Zandalee. ===Critical reception=== The film received generally negative reviews. It currently holds a 33% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 6 reviews, with a weighted average of 3.96/10. Nathan Rabin called it a perfect vehicle for Nicolas Cage and dug it up as a lost gem for his My Year of Flops column in The AV Club. According to Rabin: \\"I'm going to argue that it's a Secret Success, especially for Cage buffs. It's right up there with Wicker Man on the Nicolas Cage guilty pleasureometer, a lost camp gem filled with inadvertent hilarity and populated by heavyweight actors who would go on to do great things, including Steve Buscemi as a zany, horny, oddly philosophical thief who pops up at random intervals.\\" ==In popular culture== The film was mentioned in an episode of Clerks: The Animated Series by Randal Graves as an attempted bribery of being Dante Hicks' lawyer by telling the \\"honorable\\" Judge Reinhold that he [Randal] has seen all of his movies including Zandalee and Vice Versa. ==ReferencesCategory:1991 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:1991 drama films Category:1990s erotic thriller films Category:1991 direct-to-video films Category:American drama films Category:American independent films Category:American erotic thriller films Category:1991 directorial debut films Category:Films set in New Orleans Category:Films shot in New Orleans Category:ITC Entertainment films ","title":"Zandalee"},{"id":"2566588","text":"Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site, at Moton Field in Tuskegee, Alabama, commemorates the contributions of African-American airmen in World War II. Moton Field was the site of primary flight training for the pioneering pilots known as the Tuskegee Airmen, and is now operated by the National Park Service to interpret their history and achievements. It was constructed in 1941 as a new training base. The field was named after former Tuskegee Institute principal Robert Russa Moton, who died the previous year. == Overview== Poster of a Tuskegee Airman Before 1940, African Americans were barred from flying for the U.S. military. Civil rights organizations and the black press exerted pressure that resulted in the formation of an all African-American pursuit squadron based in Tuskegee, Alabama, in 1941. They became known as the Tuskegee Airmen. \\"Tuskegee Airmen\\" refers to all who were involved in the so- called \\"Tuskegee Experiment,\\" the Army Air Corps program to train African Americans to fly and maintain combat aircraft. The Tuskegee Airmen included pilots, navigators, bombardiers, maintenance and support staff, instructors, and all the personnel who kept the planes in the air. The military selected Tuskegee Institute to train pilots because of its commitment to aeronautical training. Tuskegee had the facilities, and engineering and technical instructors, as well as a climate for year-round flying. The first Civilian Pilot Training Program students completed their instruction in May 1940. The Tuskegee program was then expanded and became the center for African-American aviation during World War II. The Tuskegee Airmen overcame segregation and prejudice to become one of the most highly respected fighter groups of World War II. They proved conclusively that African Americans could fly and maintain sophisticated combat aircraft. The Tuskegee Airmen's achievements, together with the men and women who supported them, paved the way for full integration of the U.S. military. ==History== Moton Field was the only primary flight facility for African-American pilot candidates in the U.S. Army Air Corps (Army Air Forces) during World War II. It was named for Robert Russa Moton, second president of Tuskegee Institute. Moton Field was built between 1940 and 1942 with funding from the Julius Rosenwald Fund to provide primary flight training under a contract with the U.S. military. Staff from Maxwell Field, Montgomery, Alabama, provided assistance in selecting and mapping the site. Architect Edward C. Miller and engineer G. L. Washington designed many of the structures. Archie A. Alexander, an engineer and contractor, oversaw construction of the flight school facilities. Tuskegee Institute laborers and skilled workers helped finish the field so that flight training could start on time. The Army Air Corps assigned officers to oversee the training at Tuskegee Institute/Moton Field. They furnished cadets with textbooks, flying clothes, parachutes, and mechanic suits. Tuskegee Institute, the civilian contractor, provided facilities for the aircraft and personnel, including quarters and a mess for the cadets, hangars and maintenance shops, and offices for Air Corps personnel, flight instructors, ground school instructors, and mechanics. Tuskegee Institute was one of the very few American institutions to own, develop, and control facilities for military flight instruction. In addition to the flight training at Moton Field, the following known sub-bases and auxiliaries were used: * Calabee Flight Strip * Hardaway Auxiliary Field (location undetermined) * Kennedy Auxiliary Field (Tuskegee Institute Field #1) In late March 1941 Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, visited Kennedy Field in the Tuskegee area and was taken up in an aircraft piloted by C. Alfred \\"Chief\\" Anderson, Tuskegee Institute's chief instructor pilot. Mrs. Roosevelt was a Rosenwald Fund trustee who helped secure financing for the construction of Moton Field at Tuskegee. Moton Field flight instructors in front of BT-13 Stearmans, 1945 The first class (42-C), which included student officer Captain Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., began training on July 19, 1941. who served as Commandant of Cadets. Twelve cadets served with him under Captain Noel F. Parrish, a white officer, and 2nd Lieutenant Harold C. Magoon, another white officer, who served as the adjutant. The other cadets were John C. Anderson, Jr., Charles D. Brown, Theodore E. Brown, Marion A. Carter, Lemuel R. Custis, Charles H. DeBow, Jr., Frederick H. Moore, Ulysses S. Pannell, George S. Roberts, Mac Ross, William H. Slade, and Roderick C. Williams. Only five of these cadets completed the flying training at Tuskegee, in March 1942. Rigorous training in subjects such as meteorology, navigation, and instruments was provided in ground school. After pilot cadets passed primary flight training at Moton Field, they transferred to Tuskegee Army Air Field (TAAF) to complete their training with the Army Air Forces. TAAF was a full-scale military base (albeit segregated) built by the U.S. military. The facility at Moton Field included two aircraft hangars, a control tower, locker building, clubhouse, wooden offices and storage buildings, brick storage buildings, and a vehicle maintenance area. Many cadets got their primary flight instruction at Moton Field. Support personnel were trained at Chanute Field in Illinois. Between 1941 and 1945, Tuskegee Institute trained over 1,000 black aviators for the war effort. Moton Field was closed in 1946. In 1972, a large portion of the air field at Moton Field was deeded to the city of Tuskegee for use as a municipal airport which is still in use today. ==National Historic Site== Established on November 6, 1998, the National Historic Site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places the same day. The site has a temporary visitor center. Hangar One has been restored and the grand opening of the site was October 10, 2008. The Hangar One Museum is open for tours Wednesday—Sunday. Tours are free of charge to the public. An oral history project, consisting of interviews of hundreds of people involved in the Tuskegee Experience, was completed in 2005 and will eventually be available to the public. In January 2021, the Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Site is scheduled to be depicted on the 56th and final quarter in the America the Beautiful Quarters series. ==See also== * Alabama World War II Army Airfields * Tuskegee Army Airfield * 29th Flying Training Wing (World War II) ==References== * Shaw, Frederick J.

In the , Miriam Vale had a population of 512 people. ==Geography== The town is situated on the Bruce Highway, north of Brisbane, the state capital, and south of Rockhampton. ==Economy== Miriam Vale is renowned as a traditional cattle growing area, and also supports timber, beef and dairy cattle. Tourism is an emerging industry within the shire and the town is a gateway to the tourist resorts of Agnes Water and the Town of 1770. In the 1970s signs at the entry to town proudly proclaimed \\"Welcome to Miriam Vale – Cattle, Tobacco, Timber and Dairy\\". The tobacco industry faded in the late 1970s followed by the dairy industry in the 1990s. ==History== Pupils and teacher outside the Miriam Vale State School, 1918 Gureng Gureng (also known as Gooreng Gooreng, Goreng Goreng, Goeng, Gurang, Goorang Goorang, Korenggoreng) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Gureng Gureng people. The Gooreng Gooreng language region includes the towns of Bundaberg, Gin Gin and Miriam Vale extending south towards Childers, inland to Monto and Mt Perry. Miriam Vale Post Office opened on 1 April 1877. Miriam Vale Provisional School opened in March 1897 and became Miram Vale State School on 14 July 1897. ===Timber industry=== The timber industry has roots in the late 19th century, with early timber cutters working along the Bobby Range cutting hoop pine. In these early days hoop pine was cut and two timer chutes allowed logs to be shot to the foot of the range where bullock wagons were waiting. Evidence of these old chutes can still be found at the back of Boreelum on the sides of the range. The southern chute was on tram rails and consisted of two carriages. As the log was lowered down the mountain the other empty carriage was drawn to the top. This was achieved by a small overtaking siding in the middle. The other chute to the west was smaller and built out of logs. The timber was in most cases ferried to rail at Lowmead. There were also many timber mills in the district but many of these closed in the late part of the century. Perhaps the closest mill to town was located on the flat at House Creek. ===Dairy industry=== The dairy industry has the most claim to fame with a massive fig tree near the railway station being the drop off point of \\"cream cans\\" full of milk. This depot (being no more than a wooden stage) was the district dairy focal point. Locals would deliver the fresh milk to the depot where it was then loaded onto Claude's Truck for the trip to the Port Curtis Dairy (PCD). Fresh milk wasn't always the delivery and in the 1950s cream was separated on farms and delivered to town. Cream in those days was sold on \\"degrees of Rancid\\" (fresh, ripe, stale) as there was no refrigeration. The cream even then was going to the PCD in Gladstone. === Racing === Car rally in the Main Street of Miriam Vale, 1924 A car rally passed through Miriam Vale in 1924; the stretch of road between Miriam Vale and Gin Gin was said to the roughest of the rally. Across House Creek there is also evidence of an old speed way ground (circa 1970s) and if you look around the district you can find history in old horse race tracks. === Population === In the 2006 census, Miriam Vale had a population of 361 people. In the 2011 census, Miriam Vale had a population of 422 people. == Heritage listings == Miriam Vale has a number of heritage-listed sites, including Miriam Vale War Memorial, 1995 * Blomfield Street: Miriam Vale War Memorial Big Fig Tree * Station Street: Big Fig ==Attractions== Miriam Vale has a nine-hole golf course with small greens and mature gum trees. At times in its history the course was stretched to twelve holes but the members and district could not sustain the extra work needed to keep these holes open. Miriam vale is the gateway to the Coral Coast of Agnes Waters and 1770. The Main street of Miriam Vale, is home to the historical Miriam Vale Cafe. The main street boasts a child and dog friendly park. ==Amenities== The Miriam Vale Library is at 41 Blomfield Street; it is operated by the Gladstone Regional Council. There is a Gladstone Regional Council administration centre at 36 Roe Street. The Miriam Vale branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association meets at the QCWA Hall at Blomfield Street. == Education == Miriam Vale State School is a government primary and secondary (Prep-10) school for boys and girls at 15 Roe Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 135 students with 17 teachers (14 full-time equivalent) and 12 non-teaching staff (8 full-time equivalent). For secondary schooling beyond Year 10, students go to Tannum Sands State High School. ==Transport== Miram Vale is on the North Coast railway line and is serviced by the Miriam Vale railway station. {align=center class=toccolours width=\\"100%\\" style=\\"margin: 0em 0em 0em 0em; clear: both;\\" - !ccccff; font-size: 120%;\\" align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"5\\"Long Distance services - !Inbound !colspan=\\"3\\"Service !Outbound -align=\\"center\\" Bundaberg colspan=\\"3\\"The Sunlander Gladstone -align=\\"center\\" Bundaberg colspan=\\"3\\"Electric Tilt Train Gladstone -align=\\"center\\" Bundaberg colspan=\\"3\\"Spirit of the Outback Gladstone } == References == ==Further reading== * ==External links== * University of Queensland: Queensland Places: Miriam Vale and Miriam Vale Shire Category:Towns in Queensland Category:Central Queensland Category:Gladstone Region Category:Localities in Queensland ","title":"Miriam Vale"},{"id":"2566612","text":"Bottle of carbonated tan sold in Yerevan, Armenia Doogh () (; ; šinīna or ayran; dove; ; t'an; shrombey; ; ) is a cold savory yogurt-based beverage that is mixed with salt. It is popular in Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. ==Preparation== Doogh is served chilled and often as an accompaniment to grilled meat or rice, especially during summer. It is made by mixing yogurt with chilled or iced water and is sometimes carbonated and seasoned with mint. Doogh has been variously described as \\"diluted yogurt\\" and \\"a most refreshing drink made by mixing yogurt with iced water\\".Lake Van and Turkish Kurdistan: A Botanical Journey P. H. Davis The Geographical Journal, Vol. 122, No. 2 (Jun., 1956), pp. 156–165 Published by: The Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) Article The traditional way of preparing the drink among various Iranic peoples is straight from milk, without yogurt, using a waterskin, known as Mashk (مشک) in Luri and Persian in Iran, and Maskah (مسکه) in Afghanistan. This is done by pouring the milk in the waterskin, usually made of deer or sheep skin, and shaking it for hours, sometimes using a wooden structure to keep the waterskin above the ground with woolen strings to make the task easier. https://www.aparat.com/v/PbT8Q/%D8%A2%DB%8C%DB%8C%D9%86_%D9%85%D8%B4%DA%A9_%D8%B2%D8%AF%D9%86_%28_%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86_%DA%86%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%B1_%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%84_%D8%A8%D8%AE%D8%AA%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C_%29https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzhUXJF_5OU ==History== Doogh is an Iranian fermented drink that has long been a popular drink and was consumed in ancient Persia (modern-day Iran). Described by an 1886 source as a cold drink of curdled milk and water seasoned with mint, its name derives from the Persian word for milking, dooshidan. Other similar drinks include ayran in Turkey, t’an in Armenia and lassi in Southern Asia and are popular in Asian countries; however, they can differ from doogh. According to Nevin Halıcı, ayran was consumed by Turkic people of Central Asia. A c. 1000 CE Turkish dictionary, Dīwān ul-Lughat al-Turk, defines ayran as a \\"drink made out of milk. The Turkish word ayran comes from the Proto-Turkic *ajran or *ayran. \\"[...] the Proto-Turkic language has developed extensive nomadic pastoralist vocabulary, including terms for [...] dairy products (*ajran ‘a kind of salty yoghurt’ and *torak ‘a kind of cheese or quark’).\\" ==Turkish national drink status== Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, a Turkish politician who has held the posts of President and Prime Minister, has promoted ayran as a national drink. Speaking at a 2013 WHO Global Alcohol Policy Conference held in Istanbul, Erdoğan contrasted ayran with alcohol, which he claimed was a recent introduction to Turkey. Nevertheless, sales of ayran in Turkey may lag behind other non-alcoholic beverages. According to a 2015 joint statement from the Soft Drink Producers Association, the Sparkling Water Producers Association, and the Milk Producers and Exporters Union of Turkey, ayran consumption during Ramadan had declined every year for the years 2010 to 2015. In 2015, Turkey's Customs and Trade Ministry, controlled by Erdoğan's party, imposed a 220,000 TL fine (approximately $70,000) on state-owned Çaykur manufacturers, stating that ayran had been \\"insulted without reason\\" in one of their advertisements for iced tea, in which the rapper Ceza rapped that ayran makes him sleepy; the ministry halted advertisements of Çaykur's competing ice-tea product. ==Variations== Salt can be added, as can black pepper. Dried mint or pennyroyal can also be mixed in, as well as lime juice. One variation includes diced cucumbers to provide a crunchy texture to the beverage. Some varieties of doogh are carbonated. ==See also== *Borhani, yogurt-based drink from Bangladesh *Calpis, Japanese yogurt-based soft drink *Chal, fermented camel's-milk *Chaas, yogurt-based drink made with yogurt, salt and water, and occasional mint and coriander leaves *Chalap, beverage consisting of fermented milk, salt, and carbonated water *Filmjölk, a yogurt drink from Sweden *Kefir, fermented milk drink made with yeast grains *Kumis, fermented mare's milk drink *Lassi, yogurt-based drink from the Indian Subcontinent *Qatiq, fermented-milk beverage *Yayık ayranı, Turkish soured and churned yogurt-based drink ==References== Category:Afghan cuisine Category:Armenian drinks Category:Azerbaijani drinks Category:Iranian drinks Category:Iraqi cuisine Category:Israeli cuisine Category:Palestinian cuisine Category:Lebanese cuisine Category:Assyrian cuisine Category:Jordanian cuisine Category:Kurdish cuisine Category:Pashtun cuisine Category:Syrian cuisine Category:Turkish drinks Category:Cypriot cuisine Category:Yogurt-based drinks Category:Fermented dairy products Category:Fermented drinks Category:Sour foods ","title":"Doogh"},{"id":"2566616","text":"Shuwa may mean *Shuwa Arabic, the Afro-Arabic language spoken in Sudan, Chad and other states of Sahelian Africa *The mostly Arab speakers of this language also known as Baggara *The Japanese Sign Language (手話) *Honinbo Shuwa, a Japanese professional go player *Shuwaa, a roasted goat or lamb dish popular in Oman and the UAE ","title":"Shuwa"},{"id":"2566617","text":"Christian hardcore (or Christcore) refers to hardcore punk bands that promote Christian beliefs.

He was a member of the Krahn ethnic group. A former teacher, Johnson joined the rebel group United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO) soon after the war began. ULIMO split into two factions in 1994: United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Kromah faction (ULIMO-K) led by Alhaji G.V. Kromah and the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Johnson faction (ULIMO-J), which was led by Johnson. Johnson had 6 sons in Liberia. Jotham, his eldest, would take care of the rest of his brothers while Johnson had been on rebel missions. Nigel, Justin, Rob, Hye and Igor had lived without knowing much about their father, as Johnson had hardly been home to care for them. Fighters loyal to Johnson triggered the first major violation of the Abuja Accord in December 1995, resisting ECOMOG deployment around the diamond mines near Tubmanburg. He was dismissed from the ULIMO-J leadership in early 1996. Like many involved in the Liberian civil war, Johnson was known to use mercenary fighters to further his causes. One notable example was his funding of Joshua Milton Blahyi, commonly known as General Butt Naked. The General commanded a brigade of drunken or otherwise intoxicated young teenage boys who would fight naked or in women's clothing because of a belief that it would protect them from bullets. Such was the mix of politics, semi-religious belief, uneducated leaders, drugs and utter fall of civil society that typified the Liberian conflict. In September 1998, following several government accusations that he planned a coup d'état, Johnson's faction in Monrovia was attacked by President Charles Taylor's security forces, resulting in brutal clashes that saw most of his followers being killed. He managed to flee to the American embassy, where another shootout occurred as Taylor's fighters attempted to prevent him from finding sanctuary on the embassy grounds. Johnson, his son, and his few surviving followers were allowed into the embassy however, where they were protected by U.S. guards until being evacuated to Ghana. He eventually relocated to Nigeria. He was charged with treason and convicted in absentia, in April 1999.

Not long afterwards Abu Bakar trained a group of school children from Paya Bunga to sing the anthem and after he sang it a second time the Sultan accepted the music and words as the Terengganu State Anthem and commanded that Abu Bakar should be rewarded. ===Japanese Occupation=== A slight amendment was made to the fourth and sixth lines during the Japanese occupation but the music and the rest of the words remained as they were originally composed. ==Lyrics== {class=\\"toccolours\\" cellpadding=\\"15\\" rules=\\"cols\\" !Malay!!Jawi!!Translation - !colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"coral\\"Selamat Sultan -  Allah daulatkan Tuanku Sultan Terengganu Darul Iman Allah peliharakan Tuanku Sultan Sejahtera sepanjang zaman Allah rahmatkan Tuanku Sultan Memerintah rakyat aman  الله دولتكن توانكو سلطان ترڠڬانو دارالايمان الله ڤليهاراكن توانكو سلطان سجهترا سڤنجڠ زمان الله رحمةكن توانكو سلطان ممرينته رعيت امان  God bestow upon His Majesty sovereignty Terengganu the Abode of Faith God cherish His Majesty Blissful throughout his reign God bless His Majesty Govern the People in peace } == External links == * State anthem at National- Anthems.org * Anthem mp3 Category:Terengganu Category:Anthems of Malaysia Category:1927 songs ","title":"Terengganu State Anthem"},{"id":"2566643","text":"The Shore Line Railway was a part of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad system, running east from New Haven, Connecticut to New London along the north shore of Long Island Sound. It is currently used for commuter service on ConnDOT's Shore Line East and regional/express service on Amtrak's high-speed Northeast Corridor. ==History== New Haven Former NH&NL; embankment in Branford, Connecticut, which was replaced by a realignment project in 1893 The New Haven and New London Railroad was chartered May 1848 to build a line from New Haven, the east end of the New York and New Haven Railroad, east to New London on the Thames River and the south end of the New London, Willimantic and Palmer Railroad. Construction began in 1850 and the line opened from New Haven to the Connecticut River in Old Saybrook on July 1, 1852. Later that month the rest of the line opened, from the other side of the river in Old Lyme east to New London; a train ferry took trains across the river. The New London and Stonington Railroad was chartered May 1852 to continue east from New London to Stonington, the west end of the existing New York, Providence and Boston Railroad. On March 6, 1857 the New Haven and New London merged with the New London and Stonington to form the New Haven, New London and Stonington Railroad. The line west from Stonington opened December 30, 1858, ending at Groton, with another car ferry across the Thames River to New London. This completed the \\"Shore Line\\" route between New York City and Boston; through passenger service began December 12, 1859, with night trains first running August 19, 1861 and sleeping cars November 11. On November 1, 1859 the New York, Providence and Boston Railroad leased the NHNL&S;, giving it a line from Providence, Rhode Island to New Haven. In 1864 the NYP&B; bought the part east of New London, and the rest was reorganized as the Shore Line Railway. The New York and New Haven Railroad (which became part of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1872) leased it on November 1, 1870. (The NYNH&H; acquired the NYP&B; in 1892.) Soon after, a bridge was built over the Connecticut River, and in 1889 a bridge opened over the Thames River, directly connecting the end in New London with the NYP&B; in Groton. In the early 1890s the line was double-tracked, and some areas had new straighter alignments built. Most prominent was in eastern New Haven and East Haven, where the old alignment took it across many streets at-grade. The new line ran further east, requiring a tunnel to pass under the hills to merge with the NYNH&H; main line at Air Line Junction, also the junction with the Boston and New York Air-Line Railroad. Other realignments include a section in Branford, where the old alignment is still partially in use to access the Branford Steam Railroad, as well as smaller sections in Old Lyme and just east of Rocky Neck State Park in Niantic. The Shore Line Railway was merged into the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad on March 17, 1897, becoming its Shore Line Division. In 1969 the New Haven merged into Penn Central, and then at the latest the Shore Line was extended along the whole New York City-Boston route. In 1976, Penn Central merged into Conrail, and Amtrak bought much of the Shore Line, now known as the Northeast Corridor, including the former Shore Line Railway. Shore Line East now provides commuter rail service between New Haven and New London, connecting at New Haven to Metro-North's New Haven Line for continuing service to New York City. ==See also== * List of New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad precursors ==References== *Railroad History Database *Philip C.

He also played 34 interstate games for South Australia, captaining the team from 1954–1958 and he coached the team in 45 games from 1955–1969. ==Early life== Born in the town of Quorn, located in the Flinders Ranges and some 39 km north-east of Port Augusta, the son of Melville George Williams and Emma Otellia Williams (née McMillan). The only football Williams played prior to World War II was in Quorn. He played for the Quorn Albions and also was a start player for Quorn High School. == Army and Navy during World War II (1942–1946) == Fos Williams served as a telegrapher on the corvette .Australian War Memorial, \\"Williams, Foster Neil\\", http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?ServiceId=A&VeteranId;=735134 Accessed 7 February 2009 Williams enlisted in the Australian Army on 5 March 1942, serving as a signalman.Australian War Memorial, \\"Williams, Foster Neil\\", http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?ServiceId=A&VeteranId;=735134 Accessed 7 February 2009 On 32 March 1943 Williams transferred to the Royal Australian Navy where he served as a telegrapher on the corvette . HMAS Kiama's initial duty was to escort convoys along the New Guinea coastline. In June 1944 she was given a reassignment to perform anti-submarine patrols in the Solomon Sea. In September Kiama was used to transport soldiers between New Guinea and New Britain. On conclusion, she resumed her convoy escort role until the end of 1944, when she departed for Sydney. In September 1944 Commandos from 'C' Troop and a small detachment from 'B' Troop, the 2/8th Commando Squadron were landed from HMAS Kiama on a reconnaissance operation at Jacquinot Bay on the island of New Britain to collect intelligence in preparation for an assault by the 5th Division.Astill 1996, p. 24. On 25 December the crew was recalled from leave to go to the assistance of the liberty ship , which had been torpedoed by German submarine . Kiama, along with , , and found the 67 survivors of the attack at but failed to locate U-862. Kiama was assigned to anti-submarine patrols near Sydney for the final days of 1945 before a month-long refit in Adelaide starting on 3 January 1945. After the refit Kiama was assigned to Fremantle for two months of anti-submarine warfare exercises with the United States Navy, before returning to New Guinea on 7 May 1945. In May and June, the corvette performed several coastal bombardments in the Bougainville area. In July, Kiama transported Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester from New Guinea to the Solomon Islands, then spent the rest of the month moving troops and military cargo between these two locations. From 5 to 24 August, the corvette was based in Brisbane, before returning to New Guinea waters. Kiama spent the rest of 1945 as a troop and supply transport, minesweeper, and general duties vessel. When the war ended, Kiama took part in the Japanese surrender at Rabaul. In November, Kiama was assigned to escort demilitarized Japanese cruiser as the cruiser embarked Japanese soldiers in New Guinea for repatriation. Fos Williams was discharged from service on on 6 June 1946, nine months after the conclusion of World War II. ==West Adelaide (1946–1949)== Williams had a late start to football due to World War II, returning to Adelaide to start his career as a league footballer in July 1946 at the age of 24. Lionel Coventry cartoon of Fos Williams from 1947 during his time with West Adelaide. Williams initially wanted to play with Port Adelaide where his brother Frank had been playing. However because he was living in the Hilton district within the West Adelaide zone, he was required by the SANFL to play for the latter club. Subsequently Williams became the 609th player selected to play for club in the SANFL making his league debut on 20 July 1946. Williams played as a rover in West Adelaide's victorious 1947 Grand Final against Norwood at the Adelaide Oval. West Adelaide looked likely to repeat their success of the previous season but would fall four points short to eventual premiers Norwood in the year's preliminary final. Williams first gained state selection for South Australia while with West Adelaide and also kicked 112 goals for the club until the end of 1949.WAFC Debut Dates 1940-49WAFC 1947 Premiership Team At the end of 1949 Fos Williams was approached by representatives of clubs from Western Australia and Victoria, particularly Geelong and Subiaco, in attempts to lure him away from West Adelaide. == Port Adelaide player coach (1950–1958) == alt=Despite Williams having lucrative offers from clubs interstate, Port Adelaide's first preference to replace Jack McCarthy as head coach was to appoint South Adelaide's Jim Deane. However, despite Jim Deane being Port Adelaide's first preference for head coach, South Adelaide vehemently refused to release him from his contract. Subsequently on 22 January 1950 Fos Williams was released in good faith by West Adelaide so he could become the captain-coach of Port Adelaide. In his first year at Port he won the club's best and fairest award and led the team to a preliminary final, where they were however well beaten by Glenelg. In 1951 he won his second SANFL premiership as a player and the first of a then record nine as a coach when he led Port Adelaide to an eleven-point win over North Adelaide in the Grand Final after losing only one game on a Thebarton Oval mudheap all season. Under the coaching of Williams from 1950 until 1958 Port returned to a position of power in the league and along with the 1951 win they won five consecutive from 1954–58 and finished second to West Torrens in 1953. After 1950 Port Adelaide only missed the Grand Final under Fos Williams guidance when they lost the preliminary to Norwood by eleven points in 1952.1952 SANFL season In 1953 Fos Williams returned Port Adelaide to the Grand Final, a stage where the club would remain for seven consecutive seasons. During the 1953 SANFL Grand Final Port Adelaide would fall to West Torrens by 7 points. In 1954 Fos Williams led Port Adelaide to its second premiership under his guidance, defeating his old club West Adelaide by 3 points in the 1954 SANFL Grand Final. In 1955 Port Adelaide defeated Norwood in the 1955 SANFL Grand Final by 63 points. In 1956 Fos Williams again defeating his old club West Adelaide, this time by 16 points in the 1956 SANFL Grand Final. In 1957 Port Adelaide defeated Norwood for the second time in three years for the premiership. For the third time in five years, and what would be his last before retiring as a player and stepping away from football for 1959, Fos Williams guided Port Adelaide to a Grand Final victory over his old side West Adelaide by 2 points. After leaving Alberton at the end of 1958, Williams' influence at Port Adelaide was still evident in his three-year absence with the team's style of play changing little under new coach (and Williams' old teammate) Geof Motley. Motley took over as captain-coach and Port would win a sixth successive flag in 1959 and finish third in both 1960 and 1961 before Williams returned in 1962. During his time as captain-coach of Port Adelaide, Fos Williams wrote the club creed.PAFC Creed Williams (West Adelaide, Port Adelaide, South Adelaide) Fos Williams profile @ fullpointsfooty.net == Year away from Football (1959) == After 1958, citing exhaustion, Williams spent a year out of the game. == Coach of South Adelaide (1960) == After spending a year out of the game following his retirement as a player, Fos Williams looked to become reinvolved in league football. Williams re-entry into league football as a non-playing coach began when he took over South Adelaide in 1960. Unfortunately for both South Adelaide and Williams he could do little with the underperforming Panthers and the club finished seventh with only three wins in his sole season in charge.SANFL Season 1960 ==Return to Port Adelaide as coach (1962–1973)== Williams returned to Alberton in 1962 as non- playing coach taking over from Geof Motley, who stayed on as team captain. Williams once again led Port Adelaide to premierships in 1962. The Port Adelaide Football Club's creed was written and spoken for the first time in 1962 by Fos Williams.http://www.portadelaidefc.com.au/club/history/the-creed Port Adelaide would win back-to-back premierships in 1963. This would mean that Port Adelaide had won 8 of the last 10 premierships and the SANFL would subsequently introduce the neighbouring Woodville Woodpeckers in an effort, at least partially, to weaken Port Adelaide's dominance. The most tangible impact of this change would be Malcolm Blight, a Port supporter in his youth, falling out of the Port Adelaide zone into Woodville's. Port Adelaide made the 1964 SANFL Grand Final but lost to South Adelaide in what remains their most recent premiership. Port Adelaide won the 1965 SANFL Grand Final defeating Sturt in front of 62,543 spectators which is still the record crowd for a sporting event at Adelaide Oval. Sturt defeated Port Adelaide in the following three SANFL Grand Finals in 1966,1967,1968. Port Adelaide missed the SANFL finals for the first and only time in 1969 with Fos Williams as coach. Port Adelaide finished minor premiers in 1970 but lost the preliminary final to Glenelg by 18 points. Port Adelaide would lose the 1971 SANFL Grand Final to that year's minor premiers North Adelaide. In a repeat of the previous year's decider North Adelaide would beat Port in the 1972 SANFL Grand Final and would go on to beat Carlton for the 1972 Championship of Australia. Fos Williams continued to coach Port Adelaide until the end of the 1973 season when they finished fifth. During his 21 seasons at the helm of the Port Adelaide, the club competed in twenty finals series (missing only in 1969SANFL Premiership Placings 1897 to 2009), sixteen Grand Finals and had won nine premierships. At the time this was the record for coaching in the SANFL. John Cahill, protege and successor of Williams took over as Port Adelaide coach for 1974 and would go on to break Williams' record of 9 premierships as coach, when he won 10, all with Port Adelaide. == West Adelaide coach (1974–1978) == Williams returned to West Adelaide as coach in 1974 but the side finished with its third \\"wooden spoon\\" in a row. Williams recruited former Port Adelaide rover Trevor Grimwood in 1975 and the Bloods improved, making their first finals series since 1969 by finishing fifth in 1976 and improved again to reach the finals again in 1977, ultimately finishing third after losing to Glenelg in the Preliminary Final at Football Park. 1977 also saw Grimwood win the Magarey Medal. 1977 was the 23rd and last SANFL Finals series to feature Fos Williams as a coach. After finishing with a 14-8 record in 1977, West Adelaide slumped in what was Fos Williams' last year as an SANFL league coach in 1978. The Bloods finished with only five wins and a draw and ninth place; however one of the wins was the only loss inflicted upon Sturt prior to the Grand Final. Following this disappointing result Williams retired from coaching. ==Interstate Football== In early July, Fos Williams was named for the first time in the South Australian team for the upcoming 1947 Hobart Carnival at the expense of an injured Jack Oatey. Williams was captain of the South Australian state from 1954–1958. Williams won a Simpson Medal for best on ground in the 1955 WA v SA match played in Perth. { style=\\"margin-right:4px; margin- top:8px; float:right; border:1px #000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\\" -  width=200  1963 Victoria v.

During his time as state coach, Williams was instrumental in instilling the belief in his players that their usual tormentors, Victoria, were no better than they were and it all culminated in 1963 with a seven-point win over the Big V at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), their first win in Melbourne since 1926. Fos Williams was named in the Sporting Life \\"Team of the Year\\" in both 1950 and 1951. On both occasions he was selected in the Forward pocket. During his career as a player Fos Williams represented South Australia on 34 occasions in Interstate matches. Football historian and Norwood supporter Bernard Whimpress believes the passion that Fos Williams had for interstate football added a lot to the rivalry. == Personal life and family == Fos Williams was the son of Melville George Williams and Emma Otellia Williams (née McMillan). He had three brothers who played league football being Frank, Glynn and Alec Williams. Frank played with Port Adelaide, Glynn played for West Adelaide and Sturt whilst Alec played predominantly for Sturt with a single season at South Fremantle in 1940. Williams married Veronica Ganley on 26 January 1956 in Unley, South Australia. Their four children all had successful sports careers. Son Mark Williams played 380 games of league football for West Adelaide and Port Adelaide in the SANFL, and Collingwood and Brisbane in the VFL, and coached the Australian Football League's Port Adelaide Football Club for twelve years, including its first premiership. Anthony Williams (Mark's twin, died 1988)How tragedy helped unite Port Adelaide - twice, AFL, 7 September 2013 also played for West Adelaide and Port Adelaide. Youngest son Stephen Williams played 268 games and coached eight seasons for Port Adelaide in the SANFL, winning nine premierships as player and coach. Daughter Jenny Williams represented Australia in several sports, but was best noted as a lacrosse player. Williams died on 1 September 2001 aged 79. He was survived by his wife Von, sons Mark and Stephen and daughter Jenny. ==Legacy== The Fos Williams Family Grandstand, built in 1903 at Alberton Oval, was named in honour of Fos Williams. This is in addition to a grandstand at Adelaide Oval also being named in honour of Fos Williams. Football historian John Devaney wrote of Williams that \\"Perhaps more than any other single individual, Fos Williams was responsible for catapulting South Australian football out of its predominantly casual, laissez faire mentality into the same kind of professional, brutally expedient, 'win at all costs' mindset as prevailed across the border in Victoria.\\"Devaney, J. \\"Foster Williams (West Adelaide, Port Adelaide, South Adelaide)\\", Full Points Footy, accessed 12 February 2009 Williams was made a Member of the Order of Australia on 26 January 1981 for his service to the sport of Australian football. Williams has a number of honours in his name, such as the Fos Williams Medal, awarded to South Australia's best player in a State of Origin game, and grandstands at both Alberton Oval and Adelaide Oval named the \\"Fos Williams Stand\\". Australian Football Hall of Fame legend Barrie Robran said of Fos Williams that \\"He is a truly great man. His legacy to Australian football will be both indelibly and deservedly imprinted in the annals of South Australian football\\". Football historian and journalist Michelangelo Rucci in 1999 proclaimed that \\"When the century ends in 2000 and they assess all the men who have built the Port Adelaide Football Club into a power in South Australian football one man will stand above all – Foster Neil Williams\\". ==References== ==External links== *https://web.archive.org/web/20050408014040/http://home.vicnet.net.au/~basiced3/footy/legends/fos.html Fos Williams Footy Legend *SANFL Hall of Fame: Fos N Williams Category:1922 births Category:2001 deaths Category:Australian rules footballers from South Australia Category:West Adelaide Football Club players Category:West Adelaide Football Club coaches Category:Port Adelaide Football Club (SANFL) players Category:Port Adelaide Football Club players (all competitions) Category:Port Adelaide Football Club (SANFL) coaches Category:South Adelaide Football Club coaches Category:Australian Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:South Australian Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:People from Quorn, South Australia Category:Australian Army personnel of World War II Category:Royal Australian Navy personnel of World War II Category:Australian Army soldiers Category:Royal Australian Navy sailors ","title":"Fos Williams"},{"id":"2566671","text":"Judy Torres (born June 13, 1968 in The Bronx, New York City) is an American freestyle music artist and dance-pop singer. ==Early life and career== Growing up in the Bronx, and attending St. Thomas Aquinas and then high school at Aquinas High School, an all-girls Catholic high school, she was the oldest of five siblings.

To replace sugar, toothfriendly products often contain sweeteners (polyols, intense sweeteners) that are not fermented by the microflora of the dental plaque. Products that are certified as toothfriendly also do not contain excessive amounts of food acids. In 1983, a WHO working group recommended that the consumption of non-cariogenic \\"toothfriendly\\" confectionery should be encouraged.WHO, World Health Organization Technical Report Series, Geneva, 1984, no 713, p.19. To provide consumers with easy guidance to toothfriendly products, the Swiss University dental schools decided in the early 1980s to launch a new public information campaign on nutrition and oral health. Instead of advising against the consumption of sweets, the new campaign took a different approach. The basic idea was that consumers should be educated and encouraged to eat only confectionery products that would not harm their teeth.T.Imfeld and B.Guggenheim (1991) Sugarless - the Way Forward.

Applying a standardized method, the plaque pH is measured at least in four volunteers during and for 30 minutes after consumption of the product with an indwelling, interproximally-placed, plaque-covered electrode. Products that do not lower plaque pH below 5.7, under the conditions of this test, lack a cariogenic potential. The erosive potential is measured with a plaque-free electrode.

Most scholars, as well as traditional sources, consequently identify this wilderness as being part of the Arabah.Cheyne and Black, Encyclopedia Biblica 1899 Similarly named is the Wilderness of Sin. Modern English translations make a distinction; but it is not easily evident from the Septuagint and the Vulgate that, apart from a couple of instances, (Septuagint: Senna, Vulgate: Senna), (Septuagint: Senna, Vulgate: Sina) render both Hebrew ṣīn and sîn as \\"Sin\\". The \\"Wilderness of Sin\\" is mentioned by the Bible as being adjacent to Mount Sinai; some consider Sinai to refer to al- Madhbah at Petra, adjacent to the central Arabah, and it is thus eminently possible that the \\"Wilderness of Sin\\" and the \\"Wilderness of Zin\\" are the same place. It was this region that the British Arabist and adventurer T. E. Lawrence was exploring in a military survey for the British army when he was drafted into service.

The club previously played in the Queensland Cup and the Brisbane Rugby League premiership, but no longer plays in those competitions. ==History== Past Brothers was founded in 1929 when former members (Tom Gorman, Gerry Allman, Stan Ross amongst others) of the Brothers Old Boys decided to found a new club to compete in the Queensland Rugby League Metropolitan competition in Brisbane. Brothers Old Boys remained in the Brisbane Rugby League competition for the 1929 season before going back to rugby in 1930, whereupon the Past Brothers Club joined the Brisbane Rugby League competition. Past Brothers did not win its first premiership until 1935 but quickly backed it up with more in 1939, 1942, and 1943. When district football was introduced in the 1930s, Brothers clearly defied the idea as, unlike their competition counterparts Valleys, Norths, Souths, Easts and Wests, they were not a location in Brisbane. Although the pressure was placed upon them by governing bodies, they were allowed to keep the unique name. In the 1960s, while playing for Brothers, Peter Gallagher was selected as captain of Australia. Brothers last success was as premiers in 1987, defeating the Redcliffe Dolphins in the grand final. The club had been runner-up to the Wynnum-Manly Seagulls the year before. By the time the Brisbane Broncos entered the Sydney Rugby League premiership in 1988, they were in financial trouble that only got worse as the years progressed. They were forced out of their traditional home at Corbett Park by financial administrators, and after temporarily playing out of Crosby Park, they relocated to Bray Park, renaming the club Pine Rivers Brothers. In 1998, they moved back to Brisbane under the name Brisbane Brothers and became a feeder club to the Broncos, before closing at season's end. Seemingly out of its financial hardship by the turn of the century, Brothers applied for a position in the 2000 and 2001 Queensland Cups, but was ultimately unsuccessful. In 2002, it merged with Valleys and formed Brothers-Valleys, playing in the Quest Cup before re-entering the Queensland Cup in 2004. Brothers-Valleys finished last, with the only point coming from a draw in round 1. A new name and jersey were planned for the following year, but on 22 November the Queensland Rugby League announced, \\"The only club not participating in 2005 will be Brothers Diehards. While the QRL acknowledges the rich history associated with the organisation, the club’s inability to meet specified guidelines has resulted in this situation.\\" At present, Past Brothers' spirit continues to compete in the South East Division junior competitions, playing out of Gibson Park in Stafford as Brisbane Brothers JRLFC. ==Crest and colours== Traditionally, the club wears a predominantly navy blue jersey with white butcher stripes (irregular hoops), although for a time they wore an all-navy blue jersey with a thick white bar through the middle. The numbers on the backs of the players' jerseys were normally red on a white background, although, depending on the jersey design being used, they were sometimes white on a blue background. ==Home grounds== Traditionally the club's home ground was Corbett Park in The Grange. However, it was forced out by financial administrators when the club's financial position severely worsened. The club temporarily played out of Crosby Park in Albion and Lang Park, but in 1996 it relocated to Bray Park in the Pine Rivers Shire, hoping for greener pastures. This proved unsuccessful, and in 1998 the club was back in Brisbane. Through feeder club arrangement with the Brisbane Broncos, it played some \\"home\\" games as curtain-raisers at ANZ Stadium, with the remainder at Crosby Park, sharing the venue with Brothers Rugby Club. Currently, the brand name lives on in Brisbane through the junior club, Brisbane Brothers JRLFC, which has successfully operated out of Gibson Park, Stafford, since 2006.5 ==See also== ==Footnotes== # World of Rugby League's Past Brothers page retrieved 6 December 2005 # Brisbane Rugby League 1st Grade Grand Final Results retrieved 6 December 2005 # \\"Brothers Return To Stafford\\" by the Queensland Rugby League, retrieved 6 December 2005 # Lester, Gary.

From its inception, it was close to the Communist Party of Pakistan (CPP), and therefore banned along with the CPP in 1954. Its members, however, managed to infiltrate other student organizations, notably the National Students Federation founded in 1958. It emerged as a splinter group of the National Students Federation in the early 1970s when a pro-China faction of NSF parted from its pro-Moscow parent party, the Communist Party of Pakistan. DSF was reorganized in 1982, and quickly spread through all of Pakistan. It played an active role in uniting students, labour unions, nationalists and left wing parties to struggle against Ziaul Haq's military and fundamentalist rule. During the struggle it lost its leader Nazir Abbasi who was tortured and killed in military custody. Many of its leaders were thrown in prisons and punished. This leftist and secular organization became more popular in North-West Frontier Province (Pakhtunkhwa), which is now a center of Islamist militancy.

OUP) Pennington's Seventeenth Summer (also called Pennington's Last Term) is the first novel in a quartet for young adults by K. M. Peyton. The series is about Patrick Pennington, known to his friends as Penn. In this first title he is sixteen and in his final year of school. The novel was first published in 1970.Pennington's Seventeenth Summer at Fantastic Fiction ==Plot summary== Penn is a troublemaker and is generally disliked by all but two of his teachers, especially Mr Marsh (or ‘Soggy’), who has had it in for him for years. Penn has very little faith in himself or those around him. He habitually causes trouble for himself, due largely to his defensiveness and inability to consider the consequences of his actions. He has already had a number of brushes with the law. Only the games master, Mr Matthews, and his piano teacher, Mr Crocker, see any potential in him. In this book he discovers that his musical ability is much more extraordinary than he had thought and that he may actually enjoy playing the piano. However, his temper and rash behaviour are likely to lead him to jail before he has a chance to see where his talent can take him. ==Sequels== This book was followed by The Beethoven Medal (1971) and Pennington’s Heir (1973). In The Beethoven Medal, Pat - now a music student - meets 16-year-old Ruth Hollis (chief character of Fly-By-Night and The Team, also by Peyton). While his musical talent is developing, he has yet to master his natural aggression. In 'Pennington's Heir', Pat and Ruth marry and have a son. They live in poverty while Pat struggles to establish his career as a concert pianist. The final book in which Patrick Pennington features is Marion's Angels (later retitled Falling Angels). Pat, now a successful professional musician, and Ruth meet Marion Carver and her widowed father. Echoes of a medieval past are mixed with the present as Pat embarks on a concert series to raise funds to restore the church Marion has cared for. ==References== Category:1970 British novels Category:British young adult novels Category:Novels by K.

The brown spire in the middle distance is the Catholic church of St Wilfrid, and York Minster is visible behind York has, since Roman times, been defended by walls of one form or another. To this day, substantial portions of the walls remain, and York has more miles of intact wall than any other city in England. They are known variously as York City Walls, the Bar Walls and the Roman walls (though this last is a misnomer as very little of the extant stonework is of Roman origin, and the course of the wall has been substantially altered since Roman times). The walls are generally 13 feet (4m) high and 6 feet (1.8m) wide. ==History== ===Roman walls=== The original walls were built around 71 AD, when the Romans erected a fort (castra) occupying about 50 acres or 21.5 hectares near the banks of the River Ouse. The rectangle of walls was built as part of the fort's defences. The foundations and the line of about half of these Roman walls form part of the existing walls, as follows: *a section (the west corner, including the Multangular Tower) in the Museum Gardens *the north-west and north-east sections between Bootham Bar and Monk Bar *a further stretch between Monk Bar and the Merchant Taylors' Hall, at the end of which the lower courses of the east corner of the Roman wall can be seen on the city-centre side of the existing wall. King George III showing the Multangular Tower and the city walls upright=1.3 A map of York from 1611 by John Speed The line of the rest of the Roman wall went south-west from the east corner, crossing the via principalis of the fortress where King's Square is now located. The south corner was in what is now Feasegate, and from here the wall continued northwest to the west corner. The point where the wall crossed the via praetoria is marked by a plaque in St Helen's Square near the Mansion House. ====Multangular Tower==== The Multangular Tower in the Museum Gardens is the most noticeable and intact structure remaining from the Roman walls. It was constructed as part of a series of eight similar defensive towers. The walls are almost certainly the creation of Septimius Severus; however, the Multangular Tower is probably a later addition of Constantine the Great around 310–320 AD. It has ten sides, based on a regular fourteen-sided figure designed so that a circle through the internal angles of the internal face is tangential to the curve.RCHME, 1962, Ebvuracum: Roman York (Royal Commission on Historical Monuments England) pp. 13–14 The rear four sides are missing to provide access to the interior of the tower. A low plinth or skirt extends out from the lowest course. It stands almost tall, has an external diameter of at the base and above the skirt. Length of each side varies from to on the inner face. The tower projects beyond the curtain wall to a distance of . The foundations are concrete, atop which the tower extends having a rubble and mortar core between ashlar faced courses of small magnesian limestone blocks. At a scarcement reduces the thickness of the wall from to , which continues for a further before being capped by of 13th century masonry in which arrowslits can be seen. ===After the Romans=== The Danes occupied the city in 867. By this time the Roman defences were in poor repair, and the Danes demolished all the towers save the Multangular Tower and restored the walls. The majority of the remaining walls, which encircle the whole of the medieval city, date from the 12th – 14th century. From the east corner of the Roman walls, the medieval wall extends to Layerthorpe Bridge. After the bridge, the King's Fishpool, a swamp created by the Normans' damming of the River Foss, provided adequate security for the city, and no walls were ever built in this area. In the Middle Ages the defence of the city was further helped not just by the walls but on the rampart underneath and the ditch surrounding them. The ditch along the walls was once 60 feet (18.3m) wide and 10 feet (3m) deep. in modern times the ditch was almost all filled in and no longer exists.For this reason the ground directly around the walls is higher in most places than it would have been in medieval times. The walls resume beyond the now canalised Foss at the Red Tower, a brick building which has been much restored over the years. They continue south and west around the Walmgate area, terminating in another tower (Fishergate Postern), near York Castle, which was formerly surrounded by its own walls and a moat. A small stretch of wall on the west side of Tower Gardens terminates at Davy Tower, another brick tower located next to the River Ouse. This originally ran up to the castle walls, with a postern on Tower Street. Beyond the Ouse, the walls resume at Skeldergate, where there was once another postern. They climb past Baile Hill, take a right turn and proceed north-west parallel to the Inner Ring Road. Near the railway station, they turn right again in a north-easterly direction, finishing at Barker Tower on the Ouse. Barker Tower was once linked to Lendal Tower by a chain across the river, parallel to the 19th-century Lendal Bridge. A small stretch of wall then leads to the entrance to Museum Gardens, the Multangular Tower and the original line of the Roman walls. The walls were repaired during the English Civil War by Parliamentarians as well as during the later Jacobite Risings due to fears of an invasion from Scotland. The walls were restored in the Victorian period after falling into disrepair. The Victorians widened the wall-walk as well as extending it in some areas, (such as in the northern area with views of the cathedral), previously, in some areas, there probably would have only been narrow ledges that could be used to support a timber wall-walk in times of danger. They also rebuilt the battlements and sometimes the tops of the walls. Some slit windows are at the wrong height and some are narrow for the full width of the parapet. Some parts of the walls still have small holes called musket loops from the 17th century for muskets to fire from although they are of uncertain age due to restoration. In the northern area where you have views of the Cathedral, the walls were defended from interval towers which would have been higher than they are now after the Victorian restoration.Most of the merlons spaced along the walls were added by the Victorians. However, some pre-date this period as can be seen in the 1782 Micklegate Bar illustration and the 1807 illustration showing the Multangular Tower and walls, although, very few of the original Medieval merlons remain. Perhaps one of the most notable additions to the wall was Robin Hood tower, built in 1889. Today the walls are a scheduled ancient monument and a grade I listed building.Etching from 1814 showing Micklegate Bar with its ruined barbican still in place Micklegate Bar after restoration, showing lowered walls and removed barbican ==Bars== Bootham Bar in the shadow of York Minster. Walmgate Bar with its barbican, seen from outside the wallsupright=1.15 upright=1.25The walls are punctuated by four main gatehouses, or 'bars', (Bootham Bar, Monk Bar, Walmgate Bar and Micklegate Bar below). These restricted traffic in medieval times, and were used to extract tolls, as well as being defensive positions in times of war. ===Bootham Bar=== Although much of Bootham Bar was built in the 14th and 19th centuries, it also has some of the oldest surviving stonework, dating to the 11th century. It stands almost on the site of porta principalis dextra, the north western gate of Eboracum. It was named in the 12th century as barram de Bootham, meaning bar at the booths, after the nearby market booths. It was the last of the bars to lose its barbican, which was removed in 1835. ===Monk Bar=== This four-storey gatehouse is the tallest and most elaborate of the four, and was built in the early 14th century. It was intended as a self-contained fort, and each floor is capable of being defended separately. The current gatehouse was built to replace a 12th-century gate known as Munecagate, which stood to the north- west, on the site of the Roman gate porta decumana – that location is indicated by a slight dip in the earth rampart.Wilson and Mee, p.53R.M. Butler (1974): The Bars and Walls of York (Yorkshire Architectural and York Archaeological Society), , pp. 5–6. Today, Monk Bar houses a museum called the Richard III Experience at Monk Bar and retains its portcullis in working order. ===Walmgate Bar=== Most of Walmgate Bar was built during the 14th century, although the inner gateway dates from the 12th century. It was originally called Walbegate, the word Walbe possibly being an Anglo- Scandinavian personal name. The Bar's most notable feature is its barbican, which is the only one surviving on a town gate in England. It also retains its portcullis and has reproduction 15th century oak doors. On the inner side, an Elizabethan house, supported by stone Tuscan order columns (originally of Roman origin but modified in 1584), extends out over the gateway. The house was occupied until 1957. The Bar has been repaired and restored many times over the years, most notably in 1648, following the 1644 Siege of York in the English Civil War when it was bombarded by cannon fire, and in 1840 after it had suffered years of neglect. It was also damaged in 1489 when, along with Fishergate Bar, it was burnt by rebels who were rioting over tax raises. ===Micklegate Bar=== The name of this four-storey-high gatehouse is from the Old Norse 'mykla gata' or 'great street', and leads onto Micklegate ('gate' is Norwegian for 'street' remaining from Viking influence in York). It was the traditional ceremonial gate for monarchs entering the city, who, in a tradition dating to Richard II in 1389, touch the state sword when entering the gate. The lower section was built in the 12th century while the top storeys in the 14th; the original barbican was removed in 1826. At least six reigning monarchs passed through this gate. Its symbolic value led to traitors' severed heads being displayed on the defences. Heads left there to rot included: Henry Hotspur Percy (1403), Henry Scrope, 3rd Baron Scrope of Masham (1415), Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York (1461), and Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland (1572). The Bar was inhabited until the 20th century. The upper two floors contain living quarters, which today are a museum known as the Henry VII Experience at Micklegate Bar. A restoration of the Bar was completed in late 2017. ==Minor bars== Besides the four main bars, there are two smaller bars. ===Fishergate Bar=== This Bar originally dates from around 1315, when it was documented as being called Barram Fishergate. It was bricked up following riots in 1489, but was reopened in 1827 and today provides pedestrian access through the walls between the Fishergate area (actually Fawcett Street/Paragon Street) and George Street. ===Victoria Bar=== As the name suggests, this bar is a 19th-century addition to the walls. It was opened in 1838 to provide direct access between Nunnery Lane and Bishophill. However, during its construction the remains of an ancient gateway were found beneath it. This was probably the gateway known in the 12th century as the lounelith or secluded gatewayWilson and Mee, p.36 (in comparison to Micklegate Bar or the great bar located four hundred yards away). This was a small entrance to the city which dated back to early medieval times but was blocked up later with earth and stone, possibly during the period when the walls consisted solely of a wooden palisade before they were rebuilt in stone (from around 1250). == See also == * List of town walls in England and Wales * London wall *Conwy town walls *Caernarfon town walls * Chester city walls * History of York * Eboracum * Museum Gardens * Siege of York ==References== ==Sources== * * *Walking the Walls: An easy stage by stage guide to York's medieval walls.

Siantos also became involved in the labor movement, and, soon after his demobilization in 1920, he was elected president of the trade union of the tobacco workers in Karditsa.A. Zenakos, The Opponents == Political career until World War II == In 1922, Siantos was elected Secretary General of the Greek Confederacy of Tobacco Workers, while, during the same period, he became a member of the Socialist Labour Party of Greece (SEKE, Greek: Σοσιαλιστικό Εργατικό Κόμμα Ελλάδας, Sosialistiko Ergatiko Komma Elladas), the forerunner of KKE.The party changed its name from SEKE to KKE in 1924. In 1927 Siantos became a member of the central committee of the politburo of the party. During the internal ideological struggle of 1929-1931, Siantos as a leading member of the \\"left faction\\" was called to Moscow, where he accepted the admonitions of Comintern for unity in KKE. After his return to Greece, Siantos participated in the administration of General Confederation of Greek Workers, and in 1934 he was reelected in the central committee and the politburo of the party. In 1936 Siantos was elected as a member of the Greek Parliament, but he was arrested for Communist-related activities after the declaration of the 4th of August Regime. He was displaced in Anafi, but he managed to escape.A. Zenakos, The Opponents * M.E. Kenna, The 4th of August Regime A year late, in 1939, he was re-arrested and served time in prison in Corfu, from where he escaped in 1941. == Role during the Resistance and the Civil War == The same year Nikolaos Zachariadis, the General Secretary of KKE was transferred by the Germans to the Dachau concentration camp, and Siantos undertook the leadership of the party as acting Secretary General. During the German occupation of Greece from 1941–1944, Siantos led the Communist-dominated Greek National Liberation Army, and he also played an important role in the establishment of the Political Committee of National Liberation in 1944. The same year representatives from all political parties and resistance groups came together at a conference in Lebanon, seeking an agreement about a government of national unity. According to another agreement signed in Caserta of Italy in September 1944, all the resistance forces in Greece were placed under the command of a British officer, General Ronald Scobie. Siantos opposed the signing of both agreements, but he then was one of those who argued for their full implementation. During the Dekevriana Siantos undertook the conduct of the military forces of EAM. After the intervention of the British forces in Greece led by Scobie in favor of the government, EAM was defeated, and Siantos faced a fierce criticism by his own comrades for his choices; even Zachariadis called him \\"agent of the British\\". In February 1945 Siantos led the delegation of KKE and EAM that negotiated the Treaty of Varkiza with the Greek government and the other political parties. He signed the Treaty but after only four months he turned the command of the party over to Zachariadis, who returned to Greece. He typically remained member of the politburo, but had no leverage on the party; the defeat of 1944 had cast a slur on his reputation within the party. == Death and legacy == Siantos died of a heart attack on May 20, 1947, in the private home of the prominent Greek communist doctor, Petros Kokkalis. In 1957 a special committee of KKE rehabilitated Siantos in the party's esteem. == Notes == == References == * * * Category:1890 births Category:1947 deaths Category:People from Karditsa Category:General Secretaries of the Communist Party of Greece Category:All People Front politicians Category:Greek MPs 1936 Category:National Liberation Front (Greece) members Category:People of the Greek Civil War Category:Greek military personnel of World War I Category:Greek military personnel of the Balkan Wars ","title":"Georgios Siantos"},{"id":"2566793","text":"Ibn Wahshiyya's 985 CE translation of the Ancient Egyptian hieroglyph alphabet Ibn Wahshiyyah the Nabataean (), also known as ʾAbū Bakr ʾAḥmad bin ʿAlī () (fl. 9th/10th centuries) was a Nabataean alchemist, agriculturalist, farm toxicologist, Egyptologist,El-Daly, Okasha (2005).

It contains valuable information on agriculture and superstitions, and in particular discusses beliefs attributed to the Sabians – understood as people who lived before Adam – that Adam had parents and that he came from India. These ideas were discussed by the Jewish philosophers Yehuda Halevi and Maimonides, through which they became an influence on the seventeenth century French Millenarian Isaac La Peyrère. ====Toxicology==== He wrote a toxicology treatise, the Book of Poisons, combining contemporary science, magic and astrology. ===Egyptology=== Ibn Wahshiyya was one of the first historians to be able to at least partly decipher what was written in the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, by relating them to the contemporary Coptic language used by Coptic priests in his time.

It is a game of card building which belongs to the same family as games like Sir Tommy, Strategy, and Calculation. It is considered an easy game with 80% odds of being completed successfully. ==Rules== First, twenty cards are dealt in any arrangement the player desires; it is suggested that cards should be two rows of ten cards each. Then the player searches for an Ace and a King of each suit. These cards should go to the foundations whenever they become available for play. The foundations that start with the Aces are built up by suit, while those that start with Kings are built down by suit. The spaces that they left behind are immediately filled with cards from the stock. The stock is then dealt one card at a time, and any card that cannot be built yet to the foundations is placed on one of the 20 cards which are in fact bases for waste piles. When placing cards onto a wastepile, they do not have to follow suit or rank. However, there is no building; when a card is placed on a waste pile, the only place it would go is to a foundation. After each deal, the player will determine if any of the cards on the waste piles can be built onto the foundations. Again, whenever a waste pile becomes empty, no matter how many cards it previously had, it is filled with a card from the wastepile. This is the only way an empty pile is refilled because when the stock runs out, spaces are no longer filled. The game ends soon after the stock has run out. The game is won when all cards are built into the foundations; but when there are still cards that are stuck and cannot be possibly released, the game is lost. Arranging reserves in up and down orders is key to good play. ==Variations== Closely related to Colorado are other two-deck games like Sly Fox, Twenty, Grandfather's Patience, and Grandmother's Patience. All of these have a tableau of 20 cards and are in the Sir Tommy family. ==References== * Arnold, Peter.

He is an Inhuman giant bulldog whose abilities include teleportation. He serves the Inhuman Royal Family as their escort and as a loyal protector. Lockjaw made his live action debut in the 2017 Marvel Cinematic Universe TV series Inhumans. ==Publication history== He first appeared in Fantastic Four #45 (December 1965), and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. ==Fictional character biography== Lockjaw was born on the island of Attilan (formerly in the Atlantic Ocean and eventually moved to the Moon). Many times he has brought Inhumans to Earth and back again. At times, his powers have been manipulated by evil forces, most usually by Maximus the Mad. Lockjaw and the Royal Family encountered Maximus' creation, the Trikon, and were driven from Attilan's Great Refuge in exile.Inhumans Special #1 Lockjaw first appeared as a member of the Inhumans when they attempted to retrieve Medusa from the outside world and take her back to Attilan. This led them into conflict with the Fantastic Four, the first humans they met, who were harboring Medusa after rescuing her from the villainous Frightful Four. Accordingly, Lockjaw is indirectly responsible for revealing the existence of Attilan to the outside world. They returned to Attilan and became trapped in Maximus' \\"negative zone\\" barrier around the Great Refuge.Fantastic Four #45-48 Lockjaw is able to escape and becomes separated from his city. He roams the country for some time, accidentally terrorizing the local citizens, until he meets up with Johnny Storm and Wyatt Wingfoot. He journeyed with the pair in their attempt to breach the \\"negative zone\\" barrier.Fantastic Four #55-58; Fantastic Four Annual #4 Before long, the Inhumans were freed from the \\"negative zone\\" barrier, and Lockjaw transported Crystal to New York, and brought Triton from Attilan to rescue Mister Fantastic.Fantastic Four #61-62 Lockjaw was later compelled to return Crystal to Attilan by Maximus.Fantastic Four #82-83 With Crystal, Lockjaw was captured by Diablo.Fantastic Four #117 They later rescued the injured Quicksilver.Avengers #110 Before long, Lockjaw attended the wedding of Quicksilver and Crystal.Fantastic Four #150 He also brought the Fantastic Four to Attilan to battle Thraxton.Fantastic Four Annual #12 ===Seemingly speaking=== At one point, Quicksilver and the Thing witnessed what appeared to be Lockjaw, apparently a sentient being once mutated by Terrigen Mists, speaking to them. This convinces Quicksilver not to expose his daughter Luna to the Mists.The Thing #3 However, Lockjaw later brought Quicksilver to Washington, D.C., in search of X-Factor, and Quicksilver there stated that Lockjaw's sentience was actually a hoax perpetrated on the Thing by Karnak and Gorgon.X-Factor #71–72 Lockjaw brought the other Inhumans to Earth in search of Medusa when she fled Attilan to avoid a compulsory abortion. He also transported the injured Triton back to Attilan.Marvel Graphic Novel: The Inhumans With Crystal, he later summoned the Avengers to help battle Thane Ector and the Brethren.Avengers #334 With the Avengers, he battled the Brethren.Avengers #336-338 As noted in Ka-Zar #12, Lockjaw also travels to the Heroes Reborn universe with his Inhuman family. This visit lasts for about a year; all are returned successfully.Ka-Zar #12 Having always been particularly fond of Ben Grimm, Lockjaw elects to stay with him. Ben, fondly recounting that he \\"always wanted a dog\\", accepted. It is not known why Lockjaw did not accompany Ben Grimm when he felt the need to retreat to France during the Civil War. Lockjaw is featured into the 2006 limited series Son of M. With the majority of the mutants on Earth having been rendered powerless, Quicksilver decides to steal the Inhumans mutagenic Terrigen Mists and re- power willing mutants. Lockjaw is convinced to help him on the mission. Traveling with Quicksilver's daughter Luna, they traverse the Earth, heading to such places as Genosha. The other Inhumans follow.Son of M (2006) Later, Lockjaw rejoins Black Bolt, Medusa and other Inhumans in order to assist a super-human strikeforce in taking down the confused Sentry.New Avengers #9 Lockjaw assists his family tracking down Black Bolt, who had been captured by the Skrulls. Using technology gained from their allies, the Kree, Lockjaw's abilities are upgraded, allowing him to teleport much farther.Secret Invasion: Inhumans ===New allies=== In 2009, Lockjaw received a four-issue mini-series titled Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers, teaming with Lockheed, Redwing, Ms. Lion (Aunt May's puppy from Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends), Zabu, Niels the Cat/Hairball, and a new frog named Throg. This series involves Lockjaw bringing the Infinity Gauntlet together with the assistance of animal allies. The series spawned two additional mini-series with the Pet Avengers. Lockjaw re-joins his Inhuman family for the conflicts that eventually led to them taking over the Kree empire. This leads to the seeming loss of Black Bolt despite Crystal and Lockjaw's best efforts.War of Kings #1-6 (March-Aug. 2009) This conflict also leads to the ravaging of the Shi'ar Empire. As his family determines who will rule, Lockheed is seen playing closely with Luna and assisting with Shi'ar recovery efforts.War of Kings: Who Will Rule? One-Shot (Nov. 2009) Lockjaw again becomes involved with gathering the Infinity Gauntlet together when the Soul Gem is lost and later found.New Avengers #3 (2013) Lockjaw was also sent by Medusa to keep an eye on recent Inhuman Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan),Ms. Marvel #7 (2014) and helps her in her battle against a cockatiel/human hybrid clone of Thomas Edison known as The Inventor.Ms. Marvel #8-11 (2014) During the Inhumans vs. X-Men storyline, Lockjaw was taking a nap when he is knocked out by Fantomex.IVX #2 At the time when Lockjaw was on a mission to free Black Bolt from the deep space torture prison, a flashback revealed that Lockjaw got his powers during an Inhuman experiment on canines.Black Bolt #5. Marvel Comics. In the pages of \\"Death of the Inhumans,\\" the Kree eventually initiated a murdering mission to bring Black Bolt to their ranks and across the stars as thousands of Inhumans were killed by Vox, the first of a new race of Super-Inhuman, built by the Kree. Black Bolt quickly sent Lockjaw to bring his brother to him, however Vox had already reached New Arctilan and was fighting Maximus when Lockjaw arrived, and while the canine was able to temporarily take down the Super-Inhuman, the latter released his full power that not only burned down New Arctilan but in the process also apparently killed Lockjaw and Maximus.Death of the Inhumans #1 ==Powers and abilities== Lockjaw can teleport himself and nearby living creatures and matter to any destination on the Earth or the Moon. He can also open passages between dimensions. Energy barriers that are seemingly impenetrable to others seem to pose no problem to him. Lockjaw also has the ability to psionically trace a given \\"scent\\" across dimensional space. Lockjaw also once seemingly sensed danger from far off, when Doctor Doom had manipulated Silver Surfer's powers. Lockjaw is capable of chewing and swallowing inorganic material, such as scraps of sophisticated robots, with no ill effect. It is not known if this is his primary source of nourishment. Lockjaw seemingly has \\"super-canine\\" strength in his jaw. Once he locked on to the Thing's arm and the Thing could not get him to let go. In the Secret Invasion: Inhumans mini-series, the Royal Family enter into an alliance with the Kree to free Black Bolt from his Skrull captors. To that end, the Kree greatly enhance Lockjaw's teleportation powers, enabling him to teleport himself and others over vast interplanetary distances.Secret Invasion: Inhumans #3 ==Other versions== ===Age of Apocalypse=== In the reality where Apocalypse had conquered North America, Apocalypse approached the Inhumans to gain access to the Terrigen Mist; however the Inhumans refused to deliver such material, until one of them, Maximus, made a secret deal with Apocalypse. Maximus would give the Terrigen Mist to Apocalypse if the High Lord granted him a position in the Horsemen. Maximus then took over the Inhumans Royal Family, slaying all those who stood in his way, including Lockjaw. As the new Death, Maximus created twisted clones based on the royal family that were loyal to him. The clone of Lockjaw clashed with the X-Men when they traveled to the Blue Area of the Moon to try to kill Apocalypse during a time when he was recuperating there. Lockjaw used its tuning fork to knock out Morph. The X-Men freed themselves and defeated Maximus. Despite the Inhumans' initial victory, Lockjaw and all of the Royal Family were killed when the Ship was destroyed by Sunfire.Tales From The Age of Apocalypse #1 ===Earth X=== In the alternate future of Earth X, Lockjaw is shot by some gaseous bullet and murdered by Maximus. His teleportation-forehead assembly is seemingly the only part of him that has survived. It is used by Black Bolt and the other Inhumans to investigate happenings on Earth. ===Marvel Knights 2099=== Lockjaw is one of the few Royal family members to survive to the year 2099; Maximus the Mad had slain the rest. The Inhumans had established themselves on a space station also called Attilan.Marvel Knights 2099 (2004) ===Marvel Zombies=== Lockjaw appears zombified along with the Royal Family of the Inhumans, creating a portal for them to meet with the Kingpin.Marvel Zombies 3 #2 He is later seen trying to attack Machine Man. The heroic android tricks Lockjaw into teleporting to the mainstream Marvel Universe. Lockjaw is tricked into eating an explosive-laden human brain. He is destroyed in the explosion.Marvel Zombies 3 #4 Another Lockjaw is seen when the zombie virus spreads to \\"Earth Z\\". He too is zombiefied and assists in slaying the \\"Warbound\\". He was captured by Machine Man, Ultron and Jocasta.Marvel Zombies Return #4 (2009) ===Ultimate Marvel=== Lockjaw also appears in Ultimate Fantastic Four Annual #1. In this incarnation, he has teleportation powers as well. He leaves the Inhumans' Himalayan refuge with Crystal, who is running away because she was being forced to marry Black Bolt's brother, Maximus (only Crystal suspects he is mad). Lockjaw assists in saving Crystal from her pursuing guards but they eventually drag her back home anyway. They leave him behind and he brings the Fantastic Four for assistance. This is not well received as most of Inhuman society severely dislikes any outsiders. Black Bolt ends up destroying the evacuated Attilan simply because the Four \\"contaminated\\" it. Several of the Inhumans indicate they had conspired for Lockjaw to be left behind in the human world.Ultimate Fantastic Four Annual #1 (2005) ==In other media== ===Television=== * Lockjaw appears in the 1978 Fantastic Four animated series.

He is once again Crystal's pet and faithful companion, though it is implied that he isn't really smart. After helping the Royal Family escape Attilan when Maximus starts a coup d'état, Lockjaw is stunned by Pulssus and imprisoned in the Quiet Room while Crystal is placed under house arrest. Thanks to a trick to get away from Maximus, Crystal revives him with her powers and they escape to Hawaii, but Lockjaw is immediately injured by a passing motorist named Dave. He is revived to full health by Dave's ex-girlfriend Audrey. Afterwards, he teleports Crystal, Black Bolt, and Medusa back to Karnak upon reuniting with them. Lockjaw then returns his family back to Attilan to stop Maximus and finally returns them back to Earth when Attilan begins to fall. He is last seen with the evacuated Inhumans as Medusa makes a speech about the Inhumans finding a new home on Earth. ===Film=== * Lockjaw appears in Marvel Rising: Secret Warriors, voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. ===Video games=== * Lockjaw appears as a non-playable hero in the video game Marvel: Ultimate Alliance. His duty was to send the heroes to the Shi'ar galaxy and Skrull homeworld to gather implements necessary to defeating a divinely-empowered Doctor Doom. Also though not there in appearance, the game implies that the mini-portals used in the game for midpoint to home-base transport are made by Lockjaw since every time the player tries to create a portal outside the circumstances when that is possible, the message \\"Lockjaw cannot create a portal in that area\\" appears. This creates somewhat of a continuity error since when the player gains that ability, it is attributed to an experimental teleportation device created by S.H.I.E.L.D. He also has special \\"conversations\\" with Spider-Man, Deadpool, and Thing. * Lockjaw appears as a non-playable character in Marvel: Contest of Champions that only appears on the Gifting Badge and in Have You Seen This Dog? dialogue. * Lockjaw appears as a playable character in Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2. * Lockjaw is a playable character in the match-three mobile and PC game Marvel Puzzle Quest. He was added to the game in September 2017. He is the third playable animal character in the game, after Howard the Duck and Devil Dinosaur. * A statue of Lockjaw appears in the 2018 Spider-Man video game. The developers originally wanted to include Wall Street's Charging Bull, but replaced it with Lockjaw to avoid legal issues. ===Non-fiction=== * The debate over Lockjaw's sentience is discussed in Peter David's non-fiction book Writing For Comics. In this, he discussed how he tried to go with Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's original assertion that Lockjaw was a 'dumb animal'. He appears in a discussion of Marvel comics in a reprinted segment of a Casey At The Bat parody in The Penguin Book of Comics. In the context, he has accompanied Crystal to the baseball game. ==Reception== In August 2009, TIME listed Lockjaw as one of the \\"Top 10 Oddest Marvel Characters\\". ==ReferencesMarvel Directory profile *The Inhumans at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

The party was explicitly influenced by the American Black Panther Party, particularly Huey Newton’s policy of black unity. They located the causes of Māori and Pacific Island oppression within the exploitative social relations of capitalism. Consequently, the Polynesian Panthers promoted a strategy of liberation based on the complete overthrow of the capitalist system and the social relations necessary for its development. The group greatly increased in profile during Rob Muldoon's immigration scare campaign in 1975, and the subsequent dawn raids under his administration. ==Foundation== The Polynesian Panther Movement was founded in inner city Auckland on 16 June 1971 by six young Pacific Islander men: Fred Schmidt, Nooroa Teavae, Paul Dapp, Vaughan Sanft, Eddie Williams and Will 'Ilolahia. At the time many Pacific Island youth were supporters of Māori political initiatives such as the Bastion Point occupation and Waitangi Day protests, and gained skills in political lobbying and processes which they used to raise the profile of Pacific people in New Zealand. Because of the working-class background of its members the movement concerned itself with issues relating to unequal pay and unsatisfactory working conditions. David Lange served as the Panthers legal advisor from 1971 until 1976, and created a legal aid booklet on their behalf. Headquarters were established in Ponsonby and the Polynesian Panthers began to organise activities, among them were homework centres for Pacific children, visiting Pacific Islander prisoners as well as providing transport for their families to visit, running programs educating Pacific Islanders on their rights as New Zealand citizens and protesting the eviction of tenants in poor communities by private security firms. Within a few years the movement had expanded nationally with chapters in South Auckland, Christchurch and Dunedin, as well as several chapters in prisons. ==Activism== The Polynesian Panthers protested the controversial \\"dawn raids\\", which were introduced in 1973. The raids involved police storming the homes of people who had overstayed temporary working visas, typically at dawn. Though the majority of people overstaying such visas were from the UK, Australia and South Africa, the dawn raids disproportionately targeted over-stayers of Pacific Islander heritage. In protest, Polynesian Panther members would organise \\"raids\\" on the homes of prominent politicians in favour of the policy, surrounding them and chanting with megaphones. The government's dawn raids ended less than three weeks after the Panthers began their counter raids. In 1975, the Panthers also started a task-force known as the Police Investigation Group Patrol, or PIG Patrol, which was a response to aggressive policies of the New Zealand police force towards Pacific Islanders. Policies of the police at the time included frequently approaching Pacific Islanders and asking to see their passport. Anyone who did not have their passport on their person could be taken to prison and held until their passport was provided. Convoys of police vehicles would frequently approach bars frequently by Pacific Islanders, and were accused of provoking fights. In response, the PIG Patrol monitored police convoys and phoned in their locations. The last major activism undertaken by the Panthers was protesting the 1981 Sprinkbok Tour. Panther member Tigilau Ness was imprisoned for his role in the protests. Founding panther member Will 'Ilolahia was also arrested for helping organise the protests, and was facing 10 years in prison if convicted. Following a two year trial, he was found not guilty, a verdict that was partially attributed to Desmond Tutu flying from South Africa specifically to act as a character witness for the Panthers. After describing the Panthers as liberators and defenders of human rights, and attributing their actions as playing a role in the end of apartheid, a jury took 1 hour and 10 minutes to find 'Ilolahia not guilty. As he was leaving the courthouse, 'Ilolahia states that police threatened him with violence, resulting in him returning to Tonga for his safety. As most of the Panther's duties at the time were organised by 'Ilolahia, his departure from New Zealand effectively resulted in the end of the organisation. ==Later years== In 2006 Panther members released a book to mark the 35th anniversary of the Polynesian Panther movement. On 12 September 2009 the Polynesian Panthers held a special evening in Auckland to honour American Black Panther revolutionary artist Emory Douglas during his International Artist in Residency at Auckland University's Elam School of Fine Arts. In 2010 a documentary film made by Nevak 'Ilolahia (niece of Will 'Ilolahia), was released telling the story of the Polynesian Panthers. It was shown on Māori Television's New Zealand documentary slot. ==See also== * Ngā Tamatoa * Black Panthers (Israel) * Māori protest movement ==References== ==Further reading== * Polynesian Panthers Melani Anae, Lautofa Iuli and Leilani Burgoyne (eds.)

Bucranium (plural bucrania; Latin, from Greek βουκράνιον, referring to the skull of an ox) was a form of carved decoration commonly used in Classical architecture. The name is generally considered to originate with the practice of displaying garlanded, sacrificial oxen, whose heads were displayed on the walls of temples, a practice dating back to the sophisticated Neolithic site of Çatalhöyük in eastern Anatolia, where cattle skulls were overlaid with white plaster. ==Overview== In ancient Rome, bucrania were frequently used as metopes between the triglyphs on the friezes of temples designed with the Doric order of architecture. They were also used in bas-relief or painted decor to adorn marble altars, often draped or decorated with garlands of fruit or flowers, many of which have survived. A rich and festive Doric order was employed at the Basilica Aemilia on the Roman Forum; enough of it was standing for Giuliano da Sangallo to make a drawing, c 1520, reconstructing the facade (Codex Vaticano Barberiniano Latino 4424); the alternation of the shallow libation dishes called paterae with bucrania in the metopes reinforced the solemn sacrificial theme. While the presence of bucrania was typically used with the Doric order, the Romans were not strict about this. In a first- century fresco from Boscoreale, protected by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, bucrania and cistae mysticae hang on ribbons from pegs that support garlands, evoking joyous fasti. At the Temple of Vesta, Tivoli, designed using the Corinthian order, motifs interpreted by the architect Andrea Palladio as conventional skull bucrania adorn the frieze,Loth, Calder, \\"CLASSICAL COMMENTS: CAN WE TRUST PALLADIO? Antoine Desgodetz Details Palladio’s Inaccuracies\\" , Institute of Classical Architecture & Art, The Classicist Blog although these are actually fleshed ox heads with eyes. Similarly, the Temple of Portunus in Rome, designed using the Ionic order, has bucrania in its frieze.Loth, Calder, \\"CLASSICAL COMMENTS: Bucrania\\" , Institute of Classical Architecture & Art, The Classicist Blog In later years, the motif was used to embellish buildings of the Renaissance, Baroque, and Neoclassical periods.

The island should not be confused with Pinaki in the Tuamotu group which was named \\"Whitsunday Island\\" by Samuel Wallis in 1767. It is uninhabited today but was once settled by the sea-faring Ngaro people. The first of the logging camps on the island was set up by Eugene Fitzalan in 1861 to exploit the large hoop pine for construction of buildings on the mainland. ==Geography== The island is accessible by boat from the mainland tourist ports of Airlie Beach and Shute Harbour. It contains many popular destinations for both day visitors and overnight sailors, including the magnificent pure-white sands of Whitehaven Beach and Hill Inlet, the secure anchorage of Cid Harbour, and the sheltered waterway of Gulnare Inlet. The island also has six campgrounds. Named by Captain James Cook in early June 1770, the island covers in area. Around the northern bays of the island are seagrass beds which support a diverse range of marine life. Unadorned rock-wallabies are found on the island.

The island is almost uninhabited, quite rugged and almost completely contained within a section of the Whitsunday Islands National Park. The island has two prominent geographical features on the southern side of Hook Island; the Nara and Macona inlets, two fjord-like recesses that are used as anchorages for the Whitsunday tourist fleet. The island's northern coast is noted for its colourful underwater coral growths, to which snorkelling and diving enthusiasts are attracted. In 1964, photos were taken at the islands which circulated globally after what was believed to be some kind of sea monster was visible. The best known of the Hook Island Sea Monster photos is familiar to many (the two or three others are less familiar). It features a gigantic, tadpole-like monster, supposedly encountered in Stonehaven Bay, Hook Island, Queensland, by Robert Le Serrec and his family and a friend during December 1964. On 12 February 2008 a yacht ran aground at Cape Cove. The yacht became wedged on dangerous rocks requiring the rescue of 37 people by helicopter. The incident was Australia's largest helicopter rescue operation from a vessel. At least two people have died from irukandji jellyfish stings while snorkeling off Hook Island. Some of the oldest archaeological sites ever found in Eastern Australia are the caves and midden of the Ngaro People on Hook Island. A site at Nara Inlet is the oldest indication of Aboriginal occupation in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. ==Hook Island Wilderness Resort== The only habitation on Hook Island is the Hook Island Wilderness Resort which formerly offered the most affordable on-land accommodation in the Whitsunday group before its closure. The modest and now dilapidated buildings are only occupied by permanent caretaking and security staff and visitors are only permitted on the beach as far as the high water mark. The Hook Island Underwater Observatory provided an additional tourist attraction to the island when it was constructed in 1966 but, it was closed following an assessment that found the submarine viewing chamber had insufficient ventilation.

He had a doctorate in sociology from the London School of Economics, which was directed by Ernest Gellner. Merquior also studied under Claude Lévi-Strauss (whose ideas Merquior would largely repudiate in From Prague to Paris), and took guidance from the likes of Raymond Aron, Harry Levin, and Arnaldo Momigliano. He published books written directly in French, English, Italian, and his native Portuguese. Merquior divided his published works in two segments. In one the bulk was criticism per se; in the other the emphasis was the history of ideas, or more specific investigations like the highly esteemed study of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Max Weber. Two of his books, Foucault (1985), an often scathing critique of Michel Foucault for the Fontana Modern Masters series, and Western Marxism (1986), were described as \\"minor classics\\" by scholar Gregory R.

He worked as a customs official and died in 1888 at age 49, when his son was 7 years old. He is thought to be of local descent: Albanian or Slavic by some scholars as Andrew Mango, Lou Giaffo, Ernst Jaeckh, etc.Andrew Mango Atatürk: The Biography of the Founder of Modern Turkey, Overlook Press, 2002, , p. 25; p.27. \\"Feyzullah's family is said to have come from the country near Vodina (now Edessa in western Greek Macedonia).

Cemil Bozok, son of Salih Bozok, who was a distant cousin of Atatürk and, later, his ADC, claims to have been related to both Ali Rıza's and Zübeyde's families. This would mean that the families of Atatürk's parents were interrelated. Cemil Bozok also notes that his paternal grandfather, Safer Efendi, was of Albanian origin. This may have a bearing on the vexed question of Atatürk's ethnic origin. Atatürk's parents and relatives all used Turkish as their mother tongue. This suggests that some at least of their ancestors had originally come from Turkey, since local Muslims of Albanian and Slav origin who had no ethnic connection with Turkey spoke Albanian, Serbo-Croat or Bulgarian, at least so long as they remained in their native land., But in looks Ataturk resembled local Albanians and Slavs.[...] But there is no evidence that either Ali Riza or Zübeyde was descended from such Turkish nomads.\\" page 28; \\"It is much more likely that Atatürk inherited his looks from his Balkan ancestors.[...] But Albanians and Slavs are likely to have figured among his ancestors.\\"Lou Giaffo: Albania: Eye of the Balkan VortexJackh, Ernest, The Rising Crescent, (Goemaere Press, 2007), p. 31, Turkish mother and Albanian fatherIsaac Frederick Marcosson, Turbulent years, Ayer Publishing, 1969, p. 144.Richmond, Yale, From Da to Yes: understanding the East Europeans, (Intercultural Press Inc., 1995), 212.

In October 1994, he played one match for the reserve team of Gillingham F.C., playing for 73 minutes in a match against Cambridge United's reserves before going off injured. The match attracted a crowd ten times the average for the club's reserve team games. After being missing from British television screens for nine years, Van Wijk told Loaded magazine in April 2008, \\"I want to come back, I want to be a Gladiator again.\\" Loaded sent a journalist from London to Wolf's home in Henderson, Auckland, to persuade the actor to return to England to appear in the new series. According to the Loaded article, today, Van Wijk, 60, is a regular on the Kiwi Cage Fighting scene, and used to compete nationally in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu championships.

Originally a farming village in West Lothian it is now in the heart of the town of Livingston. ==History== ===Pre 1962=== Before 1962 Livingston Village was known as Livingston and has a history dating back to the 12th century. It is first mentioned in an early 12th-century charter as Villa Levingi (Leving's town). In 1128 David I granted the newly founded Abbey of Holyrood control of the church at Livingston and its income in a charter that was witnessed by Turstani filii Levingi (Thurstan Levingsson).Livingston Old Parish . He built a fortified tower (Peel of Livingston) which is long since gone. The settlement that grew up around it became known as Levingstoun, Layingston and eventually fixed at Livingston. The name derives from the family name Leving who controlled the area until dying out in 1512. The home of the family was a large Scottish tower house, Livingston Peel. From 1512 until 1671 the house was occupied by The Murrays of Elibank. In the late 17th century the Peel was demolished and replaced by a house called Livingston Place and it passed from the Murray family to the Cunningham family. It was acquired by the Earl of Rosebery in 1828 and demolished in 1840.The History of Livingston, William F Hendrie The Earls of Callendar and the Earls of Linlithgow bear the family name Livingston, and trace their lineage back through Thurstan of Levingston to his father Leving of Levingstoun. One genealogy traces it further back to a Baron de Leving who is believed to have accompanied St. Margaret from her birthplace in Hungary, her presence in Edward the Confessor's court in England and her exile in Scotland., Livingstons of Callendar. Other sources regard Leving as a Flemish entrepreneur. Livingston Old Kirk, in its current form, dates from 1732 and is a fine example of plain Presbetryrian architecture of the period. It stands on the site of a pre-Reformation church which appears to have stood on the site from c.1350 to 1650. In 1898 Livingston had several houses, a Church of Scotland Church, a United Free church and a School. Kirk ===Surrounding Country Houses History of Livingstone by Wm F Hendrie=== ====Charlesfield House==== Charlesfield House was a major country house standing just south- west of the village on the banks of the River Almond. It was designed around 1795 and completed in 1798 as the home of a Rev. Thomas Hardy. However it was sold almost immediately, to Henry Raeburn, son of the renowned Scottish portrait artist, Sir Henry Raeburn. The house contained a large number of his father’s works. ====Howden House==== Howden House, Livingston Livingston War Memorial Old bridge, Livingston Village River Almond looking west from bridge in Livingston Village Ornate 18th-century grave in Livingston Churchyard Livingston Kirk seen from the south-east To the north-east of the village stands Howden House, also built in 1795. Its grounds form a substantial park for the town. The following year it was used for the marriage of Dr James Gregory to Isabella Macleod. Gregory was famed for his children’s cough medicine: “Gregory’s Mixture”. Latterly it was occupied by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. In 1964 it was converted into a community centre and its gardens given to use as a public park, with the help of a £12000 grant from the Carnegie Trust. In recent years the community facilities have condensed down to occupy the former stable block to the west and a new-build structure. The original building was converted to flats in 2013. ====Alderstone House==== The estate was purchased by the Kinloch family in 1556 and the current house built as a typical Scottish L-plan tower-house in 1626 by the advocate Patrick Kinloch. The grounds contain a large stone doo’cote of similar age in the grounds. ===After 1962=== The new town of Livingston was built and was given the name Livingston so the old Livingston was renamed Livingston Village to distinguish it from the New Town. Since then the village has expanded greatly and now contains a large amount of New Town architecture. ==Governance== Livingston Village is in the West Lothian County, before 1975 the village was part of Linlithgowshire. There was previously a Quango called the Livingston Development Corporation that existed from 1962 to March 22, 1997http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1997/342/note/made to build, manage and promote the New Town which included Livingston Village. Livingston Village is covered by the Livngston North Ward in West Lothian Council and the Livingston North Local Area Committee.Livingston North, West Lothian Council The Councillors are the Chair Andrew Miller (SNP),Councillor Andrew Miller John Cochrane (Action to Save St John's Hospital),Councillor John Cochrane Robert De Bold (SNP)Robert De Bold and Bruce Ferrie (Labour).Bruce Ferrie Livingston Village is part of the Almond Valley Constituency since 1999 and is represented by the Scottish National Party (SNP) Angela Constance who has held the seat since 2007 when the constituency was called Livingston. Livingston Village is part of the Livingston UK Parliament constituency since 1983 for which the SNP's Hannah Bardell was elected MP in May 2015, unseating the incumbent Labour MP Graeme Morrice. Livingston Village is part of the Scotland European Parliament constituency. ==Recreation and Sport== Almondvale Stadium the home of Livingston F.C. who play in the Scottish Premier League is on the edge of the village. ==Transport== Livingston Village was served by Livingston Station on the Edinburgh to Bathgate Line which opened in 1849 and closed in 1948. The area around this station used to be known as Livingston Station and is now known as Deans. A new station opened in 1986 about 1 km east of the original site and is called Livingston North railway station. Another station to the south: Newpark railway station also served the village. This has been replaced by Livingston South railway station about 2 km east. The M8 Motorway is nearby and the A705 run parallel to the village. The nearest airport is Edinburgh Airport. ==See also== *Cumbernauld Village *Milton Keynes Village ==References== == External links == *Pictures of Livingston Village - Livingstoni.co.uk *Livingston Alive - Livingston Village Category:Livingston, West Lothian ","title":"Livingston Village"},{"id":"2567009","text":"Gülzow is a town in Lauenburg district in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, founded in the 13th century.

The band played Thrash Metal. Despite the departure of bassist Markus Espenhain in early 1996, the first demo Subspace Insanity was recorded in March the same year. 1997 followed Red, where the band already developed their own style. The second demo was mixed and mastered by Andy Schmidt and Alex Tscholakov at TAM Recording in Zwickau. Despite growing local success and the prospect of the band becoming more serious, Disillusion was put on hold because of lack of time of some band members. With joining of guitarist Rajk Barthel and drummer Jens Maluschka in 1999 and 2000 Disillusion started again. They played some concerts and recorded their third demo Three Neuron Kings in summer 2001 (again with Alex Tscholakov at TAM Recording). The record received positive reviews by the music press. In spring of 2002 Disillusion went on tour again and won an EP production at the Legacy Band Contest. The record was recorded at TAM Recording in 2002 and called The Porter. It also reached international reputation in the music press and attracted the attention of larger labels. ===Back To Times of Splendor=== Disillusion signed a contract with Metal Blade Records and released the first album Back to Times of Splendor in 2004. Stylistically, the music is mostly located in Progressive Death Metal. Back to Times of Splendor was very well received by the critics. The Rock Hard even spoke of a hot contender for the title \\"Debut of the Year.\\" After the release Disillusion performed at several festivals (including Summer Breeze Open Air) and a European tour as support for Amon Amarth and Impious. During this time, the album was presented in special shows together with Leipzig musicians from Dark Suns and Unloved. ===Gloria=== The successor named Gloria was released on October 20, 2006. With the album, Disillusion entered new musical territory and relied heavily on distorted vocals as well as more electronic sounding elements. The latter was developed mainly by the production duo Philipp Hirsch and Heiko Tippelt of film-m. The new album showed a clear change of style compared to the predecessor. Disillusion did not want stylistically a successor to Back To Times of Splendor, because from the perspective of the band in the album everything was said. This is evident in the Gloria song \\"Save the Past\\". Fans and reviewers took Gloria very controversially. After the release Disillusion played European-wide concerts, although this time the band did not play a cohesive tour but played several individual shows as headliners. ===Post Gloria and hiatus=== On December 8, 2009, Andy Schmidt announced that the band had been separated from guitarist Rajk Barthel. At the end of 2010, Sebastian Hupfer joined the band as new guitar player. in 2011 some shows were played. This was followed by a hiatus, which Andy Schmidt explained with private challenges of the individual band members. ===Alea: Comeback=== In the year 2015 a fan asked the band to play an exclusive concert in Vienna. After Matthias Becker was no longer available because of his band SAFI, the French bassist Djon joined the band. Until then he played in a local project called echo.mensch together with Sebastian Hupfer. On May 29, 2015 Disillusion played Back to Times of Splendor for the first time in a row in Vienna. There were further shows in Germany and a final comeback concert in the sold-out Werk 2 in Leipzig on December 4, 2015. The new ten minute single Alea was presented live for the first time. In April 2016, Ben Haugg was officially introduced as a new bass player, as Djon had to return to France due to private obligations. On October 7, 2016 Alea was released digitally and as a CD via Kick the Flame Publishing (the publisher of the former guitarist Rajk Bartel). There followed a mini-tour at the end of the year through Germany and Austria. An album is to follow. === Work on third album === In March 2017 Disillusion announced that they would begin writing a third album. To aide with the writing process, Andy Schmidt isolated himself to a small cabin in the woods somewhere in the Czech Republic for 3 weeks to work undisturbed on new songs. Simultaneously the band asked for fan support via Patreon to finance the production. The first goal - support for Andy - was reached within two days. The band then announced to complete the third album within 12 months, but later extended that deadline to another year as the band didn't want to feel rushed to provide their fans with and inadequate and incomplete experience. During this time, the band announced another line-up change. This time, Bass player, Benn Haugg, would be moving on to third guitar and the band announced 2 new members. Josh Saldanha, a drummer from Dubai and Felix Tilemann who would be replacing Ben on the Bass. ==Band members== ===Current=== * Andy Schmidt: vocals/guitar/keyboards (1994–present) * Sebastian Hupfer: Guitar (2010–present) * Ben Haugg: Guitar (2016 – present) * Felix Tilemann: Bass (2018-present) * Josh Saldanha: drums (2018-present) ===Past=== * Tobias Spier: vocals, guitar (1994–1997) * Alex Motz drums: (1994–1997) * Clemens Frank: drums: (live only, 2007) * Markus Espenhain: bass guitar (1994–1996) * Jan Stölzel: keyboard (1994–1997) * Ralf Willis: bass guitar (2005) * Shya Hely: backing vocals (live only, 2005) * Alex Tscholakov: drums (2007–2008) * Alla Fedynitch: bass guitar (live only, 2007–2008) * Rajk Barthel: guitar (1999–2009) * Matthias Becker: bass guitar (2008-2015) * Djon: Bass guitar (2015) * Jens Maluschka: Drums (2000–2007, 2008−2018) ==Timeline== ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:20 PlotArea = left:100 bottom:90 top:0 right:15 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1994 till:12/12/2018 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:4 ScaleMajor = increment:1 start:1994 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1994 Colors= id:vocals value:red legend:Vocals id:backing value:pink legend:Backing_Vocals id:guitar value:green legend:Guitar id:bass value:blue legend:Bass id:keys value:purple legend:Keyboards id:drums value:orange legend:Drums id:studio value:black legend:Studio_Albums id:other value:gray(0.5) legend:Demos/EPs id:singles value:red legend:Singles id:split value:yellow legend:Split/Single_Albums id:bars value:gray(0.95) LineData= at:07/01/1995 color:other layer:back at:04/01/1996 color:other layer:back at:09/01/1997 color:other layer:back at:10/01/2001 color:other layer:back at:04/05/2002 color:split layer:back at:04/06/2004 color:black layer:back at:09/04/2004 color:split layer:back at:10/20/2006 color:black layer:back at:10/07/2016 color:red layer:back BackgroundColors= bars:bars BarData= bar:Andy text:\\"Andy Schmidt\\" bar:Tobias text:\\"Tobias Spier\\" bar:Shya text:\\"Shya Hely\\" bar:Rajk text:\\"Rajk Barthel\\" bar:Jörg text:\\"Jörg Heinze\\" bar:Markus text:\\"Markus Espenhain\\" bar:Ralf text:\\"Ralf Willis\\" bar:Alla text:\\"Alla Fedynitch\\" bar:Matt text:\\"Matthias Becker\\" bar:Ben text:\\"Ben Haugg\\" bar:Felix text:\\"Felix Tilemann\\" bar:Jan text:\\"Jan Stölzel\\" bar:Alex text:\\"Alex Motz\\" bar:Alex2 text:\\"Alex Sasch Tscholakov\\" bar:Jens text:\\"Jens Maluschka\\" bar:Josh text:\\"Josh Saldanha\\" PlotData = width:10 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:Andy from:01/01/1994 till:end color:vocals bar:Andy from:12/01/1997 till:end color:keys width:7.5 bar:Andy from:01/01/1994 till:end color:guitar width:2.5 bar:Andy from:12/01/1996 till:03/01/2005 color:bass width:5.5 bar:Andy from:10/01/2005 till:01/01/2007 color:bass width:5.5 bar:Tobias from:01/01/1994 till:12/01/1997 color:vocals width:2.5 bar:Tobias from:01/01/1994 till:12/01/1997 color:guitar bar:Shya from:03/01/2005 till:10/01/2005 color:backing bar:Rajk from:01/01/1999 till:03/01/2009 color:guitar bar:Jörg from:01/01/2000 till:10/01/2000 color:guitar bar:Ben from:03/01/2018 till:end color:guitar bar:Jan from:01/01/1994 till:12/01/1997 color:keys bar:Markus from:01/01/1994 till:12/01/1996 color:bass bar:Ralf from:03/01/2005 till:10/01/2005 color:bass bar:Alla from:01/01/2007 till:07/01/2008 color:bass bar:Matt from:07/01/2008 till:04/01/2016 color:bass bar:Ben from:04/01/2016 till:03/01/2018 color:bass bar:Felix from:03/01/2018 till:end color:bass bar:Alex from:01/01/1994 till:03/01/1997 color:drums bar:Alex2 from:03/01/1997 till:08/01/2000 color:drums bar:Jens from:08/01/2000 till:05/01/2007 color:drums bar:Alex2 from:05/01/2007 till:08/01/2008 color:drums bar:Jens from:08/01/2008 till:03/01/2018 color:drums bar:Josh from:03/01/2018 till:end color:drums ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * Back to Times of Splendor (2004) * Gloria (2006) * The Liberation (2019) ===Demos and EPs=== * Rehearsal (1995) (demo) * Subspace Insanity (1996) (demo) * Red (1997) (demo) * Three Neuron Kings (2001) (EP) * Alea (2016) (EP) ===Singles=== * The Porter (2002) (single) * Alea (2016) (single) ===Other=== * Fate of Norns Release Shows (2004) (split album including;

Kneeboards are ridden in ocean surf, or while being towed behind a boat on a lake or river. ==Background== Kneeboard riders generally wear life jackets or wet suits and catch the wave by paddling and kicking or dipping their hand in the water . Advantages to kneeboarding include an extremely low center of gravity, less wind resistance, the ability to ride higher and farther back in the tubes, and taking off on a steeper part of the wave. Towed kneeboarding is an offshoot of kneeboard surfing; kneeboard riders compete tricks, and expression session events. Towed kneeboards have a padded deck contoured to the shape of the shins and knees and a strap holds the rider to the board. Towed kneeboarding declined in popularity with the advent of wakeboarding and other modern watersports; however, it still enjoys popularity among water skiers and newer models of the kneeboard are still in production. A kneeboard is a good piece of equipment to start out on for boat-towed sports--the low center of gravity often makes it easier to get up on than a waterski or wakeboard, which both require standing up. Surf kneeboard innovators include George Greenough, Steve Lis, Peter Crawford and Ron Romanosky. Till Wipperfuerth is one of the actual top performers in kneeboarding, since he became champion of the Tunilake Kneeboard Masters. A pair of knee boards is also a tool used by a mason to distribute body weight while kneeling on wet concrete. ==See also== * Surfing * Waterskiing * Wakeboarding * Barefoot skiing * Hydrofoiling ==ReferencesCategory:Towed water sports Category:Surfing equipment Category:Kneeling ","title":"Kneeboard"},{"id":"2567031","text":"Detective is a novel by Arthur Hailey. It was written in 1997 and was the author's last book. Hailey depicts the work of a homicide department and its investigation methods. ==Plot== Detective is the story of Miami Police detective Malcolm Ainslie, who had previously trained to be a Catholic priest. A serial killer breaks free in Miami. He is a religious freak and he starts killing people feeling that he is the avenger of God. He leaves certain things at the murder scenes that are symbols from the Book of Revelation. Miami Police Detective Sergeant Malcolm Ainslie and his team start to investigate the murders. They eventually find the killer and arrest him. The murderer is nicknamed The Animal because he kills in such a barbaric manner. Now, when this man is about to be executed for the serial killings he did, he calls for Malcolm. 30 minutes before his execution he confesses to Malcolm that he did all the serial killings he is accused of except one, which was not done by him. It was the killing of mayor of the city commissioner and his wife. Malcolm, at first, refuses to believe him because The Animal has a reputation of being a liar. But as he goes deep into the history of cases and studies all the killings he discovers that there are two killings in separate cities, unsolved murders which were confessed by The Animal. When he carefully studies all the killings done by him, he finds out that the killings of city commissioner and his wife were attempted by someone else, a copy cat killer, and these murders were made to look as if done by the same killer. Thanks to his priestly training, he notices that the pattern of the symbols left by the Animal at scenes of all the other murders is derived from the Book of Revelation, but that the symbols left at the murder of the Mayor do not fit this pattern. Malcolm suddenly finds himself facing a situation where a copy cat killer is roaming around free. And when the killings are of a city commissioner and his wife the matter became more complicated. His team starts to investigate and finds important people involved in the killings and a famous novelist is also involved. ==Television== Detective (a. k. a.

Wood and sentenced to death. His conviction was overturned in 1989. Throughout his legal ordeal, Adams maintained his innocence. He insisted that the man he believed to be Wood's killer, David Ray Harris, had offered him a ride on the day of the shooting after his own car had run out of gasoline. Adams and Harris had spent several hours together but had parted ways prior to the shooting. Under an immunity agreement, Harris testified for the prosecution that Adams was the shooter of Officer Wood while he was the passenger. Based on the testimony of Harris and other alleged eyewitnesses, Adams was found guilty by a Dallas County jury and imprisoned on death row. In 1980, his sentence was commuted to life in prison. While incarcerated for the crime, Adams was the subject of the 1988 documentary film The Thin Blue Line, which was cited as being instrumental in his exoneration the following year. Writer–director Errol Morris knew that Harris had, on multiple occasions, bragged about shooting a police officer.David Ray Harris #916 He later uncovered evidence of prosecutorial misconduct and eyewitness misidentification.Randall Dale Adams During an interview with Harris, Morris was able to record audio of him giving a pseudo-confession to the Wood murder.Executed murderer had official accomplices  Freepress.org In 2004, Harris was executed by lethal injection for an unrelated 1985 murder.

Adams received no compensation from the State of Texas for the 12 years he spent in prison. He died of a brain tumor on October 30, 2010, in Washington Court House, Ohio. ==Early life and education== Adams was born in Grove City, Ohio,Montgomery Brower, Anne Maier, Ken Myers, Sandra Gurvis. \\"Crossing a Line That Is Not Thin at All, Randall Dale Adams Wins Release from a Texas Prison,\\"]People Vol. 31 No. 14 (April 10, 1989) the youngest of five children of a woman named Mildred and a miner who died of coalworker's pneumoconiosis. Adams graduated from high school in 1967, and spent three years as a U.S. Army paratrooper. ==Murder conviction== In October 1976, 27-year-old Randall Adams and his brother left Ohio for California. En route, they arrived in Dallas on Thanksgiving night. The next morning, Adams was offered a contracting job. On the following Saturday, November 27, Adams went to start work but no one turned up because it was a weekend. On the way home, his car ran out of fuel. David Ray Harris, who had just turned sixteen, passed Adams in a car that he had stolen from his neighbor in Vidor, Texas, before driving to Dallas with his father's pistol and a shotgun. Harris offered Adams a ride. The two spent the day together, during which they drank alcohol and smoked marijuana. That evening they went to a drive-in movie, where they saw The Student Body (1976, directed by Gus Trikonis) and The Swinging Cheerleaders (1974, directed by Jack Hill). That evening, Robert W. Wood, a Dallas police officer, was working the graveyard shift with his partner, Teresa Turko, one of the first female police officers in Dallas to be assigned to patrol duty. Shortly after midnight on November 28, Wood stopped Harris' stolen car in the 3400 block of North Hampton Road because the car's headlights were not on. As Wood approached, he was shot twice in the forearm and chest by someone in the car. The vehicle sped off almost immediately after the shooting, giving Wood's partner little time to react; she later testified that she managed to fire upon the fleeing vehicle but to no avail. The Dallas Police Department investigation led back to Harris, who, after returning to Vidor, had boasted to friends that he was responsible for the crime. Harris was arrested but, when interviewed by police, accused Adams of the murder. Harris led police to the car driven from the scene of the crime, as well as to a .22 Short caliber revolver he identified as the murder weapon. ===Trial=== Dallas prosecutor Douglas D. Mulder charged Adams with the crime, despite the evidence against Harris, apparently because Harris was a juvenile at the time and Adams, as an adult, could be sentenced to death under Texas law. Adams testified that after leaving the drive-in movie, Harris dropped Adams off at his motel, where Adams and his brother watched TV and then went to sleep. He claimed he was not in the car when the shooting happened. Harris testified that Adams was not only in the car, but was the driver, as well as the shooter of Officer Wood. Testimony by Harris and several questionable eyewitnesses – including Emily Miller and R.L. Miller, who claimed to have driven past Harris' stopped vehicle immediately before the shooting – led to Adams' conviction. Texas forensic psychiatrist James Grigson (a.k.a. \\"Dr. Death\\") was also a witness for the prosecution. Having administered a psychiatric evaluation of Adams, he told the jury that Adams would be an ongoing menace if kept alive. As a result of this testimony, Adams was given the death penalty. His conviction was unanimously upheld by the Texas Courts of Appeals in 1979.Adams v. State, 577 S.W.2d 717 (Tex. Cr. App. 1979) (en banc), at . Many years later, in 1995, Grigson was expelled by the American Psychiatric Association and the Texas Society of Psychiatric Physicians for unethical conduct. ===Commutation of death sentence=== Adams' execution was originally scheduled for May 8, 1979, but U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. ordered a stay only three days before the scheduled date. In 1980, the Supreme Court on an 8–1 vote ruled unconstitutional a Texas requirement for jurors to swear an oath that the mandatory imposition of a death sentence would not interfere with their consideration of factual matters, such as guilt or innocence, during a trial. As a result of the decision, Adams' death sentence was reversed and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals granted him a new trial.Adams v. Texas, 448 U.S. 38, 100 S.Ct. 2521, 65 L.Ed.2d 581 (1980), at . Before the trial could begin, however, Texas Governor Bill Clements commuted Adams' sentence to life in prison at the request of the Dallas County District Attorney.Adams v. State, 624 S.W.2d 568 (Tex. Cr. App. 1981) (en banc), at . ==Exoneration== In May 1988, David Ray Harris, by that point himself a prisoner on death row, admitted that Adams was not even in the car on the night of the murder. The August 1988 release of the documentary film The Thin Blue Line, which detailed the many inconsistencies in the prosecution's line of reasoning, further cast doubt on Adams' guilt, but the case remained in legal limbo. In 1989, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in Ex parte AdamsEx parte Adams, 768 S.W.2d 281 (Tex. Ct. Crim. App. 1989) (en banc), at . overturned Adams' conviction on the grounds of malfeasance by the prosecutor Douglas D. Mulder and inconsistencies in the testimony of a key witness, Emily Miller. The appeals court found that prosecutor Mulder withheld a statement by Emily Miller to the police that cast doubt on her credibility and also allowed her to give perjured testimony. Furthermore, the court found that after Adams' attorney discovered the statement late in Adams' trial, Mulder falsely told the court that he did not know the witness' whereabouts. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals stated that \\"conviction was unfair mainly because of prosecutor Doug Mulder.\\" Mulder had returned to practicing private law in Dallas in 1981. Following the appeals court decision, the case was returned to Dallas County for a retrial, but the district attorney's office decided not to prosecute the case again based on the length of time since the original crime, and Adams was subsequently released. Despite being wrongly imprisoned for twelve years, Adams received no compensation from the State of Texas. It is said that if Adams had been found to be wrongly convicted under present-day Texas law, he would be entitled to receive $80,000 for each year of incarceration. Additionally, at the time his conviction was thrown out, wrongly convicted prisoners could get a lump sum payment of $25,000 if pardoned by the governor. However, since Adams was released because his case was dismissed, and not because he was pardoned, he received no payment from the state after his release. ===David Ray Harris=== David Ray Harris had testified in the original trial that he was the passenger in the stolen car, that he allowed Adams to drive, and that Adams committed the murder. He recanted this testimony at Adams' habeas corpus hearing, but never admitted guilt in a judicial setting and was never charged in the case. On June 30, 2004, Harris was executed by lethal injection for the unrelated 1985 murder of Mark Mays in Beaumont, Texas, which occurred during an attempted abduction of Mays' girlfriend. ==Lawsuit== After his release from prison, Adams ended up in a legal battle with Errol Morris, the director of The Thin Blue Line, concerning the rights to his story. The matter was settled out of court after Adams was granted sole use of anything written or made on the subject of his life. Adams said of the matter: \\"Mr. Morris felt he had the exclusive rights to my life story. ... I did not sue Errol Morris for any money or any percentages of The Thin Blue Line, though the media portrayed it that way.\\" Morris, for his part, recalled: \\"When he got out, he became very angry at the fact that he had signed a release giving me rights to his life story. And he felt as though I had stolen something from him. Maybe I had, maybe I just don't understand what it's like to be in prison for that long, for a crime you hadn't committed. In a certain sense, the whole crazy deal with the release was fueled by my relationship with his attorney. And it's a long, complicated story, but I guess when people are involved, there's always a mess somewhere.\\" ==Activism and personal life== While in prison, Adams earned a correspondence-course degree from Lee College in Baytown, Texas. Adams later worked as an anti-death penalty activist. He wrote a book about his story, Adams v. Texas, which was published in June 1992.Adams, Randall Dale, with William Hoffer and Marilyn Mona Hoffer. Adams V. Texas, (St. Martin's Press, June 1992); . In 2001, at an anti-death penalty legislative hearing on behalf of the Texas Moratorium Network, Adams said: > The man you see before you is here by the grace of God. The fact that it > took 12-and-a-half years and a movie to prove my innocence should scare the > hell out of everyone in this room and, if it doesn't, then that scares the > hell out of me. In 1999, Adams married Jill Fratta, the sister of a death-row inmate. ==Death== Adams died of a brain tumor in Washington Court House, Ohio on October 30, 2010, at the age of 61. He lived a quiet life divorced from his past. According to his lawyer, Randy Schaffer, the death was at the time reported only locally and was not more widely reported until June 25, 2011. ==See also== * List of exonerated death row inmates * List of wrongful convictions in the United States ==References== ==External links== *Randall Dale Adams story from Northwestern University School of Law's Center on Wrongful Convictions Category:1948 births Category:2010 deaths Category:People from Grove City, Ohio Category:People wrongfully convicted of murder Category:Overturned convictions in the United States Category:People paroled from death sentence Category:American anti–death penalty activists Category:Activists from Ohio Category:Deaths from brain tumor Category:Deaths from neurological disease Category:Deaths from cancer in Ohio Category:People from Washington Court House, Ohio Category:People from Franklin County, Ohio Category:Dallas Police Department ","title":"Randall Dale Adams"},{"id":"2567049","text":"Ghita Nørby (born 11 January 1935) is a Danish actress with 117 film credits to her name from 1956–2005, making her one of the most active Danish actresses ever.

The chemical weapons originally stored at the depot consisted of various live munitions and storage containers each holding GB or VX nerve agents or HD blister agent. All munitions had been safely destroyed by 2011 and base closure operations are expected to be completed by 2018, after several years of delays. ==History== The Umatilla Chemical Depot opened in 1941, to prepare for World War II. The depot's mission was to store and maintain a variety of military items, from blankets to ammunition. The depot took on its chemical weapons storage mission in 1962 and stored 12% of the nation's stockpile. From 1990 to 1994, the facility reorganized in preparation for eventual closure, shipping all conventional ammunition and supplies to other installations. ==Chemical Weapons Destruction Facility== The Umatilla Chemical Agent Disposal Facility is designed for the destruction of the chemical weapons stored at the Umatilla Chemical Depot. The facility was completed in 2001. The Army began weapons disposal on September 8, 2004, and completed disposal on October 25, 2011. \\\\- Los Angeles Times - October 25, 2011 Destruction is a requirement under the Chemical Weapons Convention and monitored by the OPCW.

The process is simplified by having only containers of HD remaining to be processed while multiple kinds of individual munitions containing several agents were destroyed early in the campaign. An emphasis on risk reduction prioritised destruction of the most modern and dangerous compounds (VX and GB) and destruction of smaller containers, which had greater risk of theft, explosion, and leakage. ===Public participation and outreach=== The Oregon Citizens' Advisory Commission, whose members include area residents appointed by the Governor, is a focal point for public participation in the Army's weapons storage and disposal program in Umatilla. ==Closure and redevelopment== Dismantling of the chemical disposal facility began in August 2013, and the base was expected to be transferred for state and private use by early 2015. The timeline was pushed back by the Columbia Development Authority, first to 2016 and then to 2017 and into 2018, due to complications during cleanup. After the planned decommissioning and transfer of land in 2018, the Oregon Military Department plans to use part of the base for a training facility, while the rest becomes industrial land and a wildlife refuge. ==See also== *Chemical Weapons Convention *Lethal Unitary Chemical Agents and Munitions *Ordnance, Oregon *Tooele Army Depot ==References== ==External links== * Official site Umatilla Chemical Depot - the U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency * Aerial photo on flickr Aerial photograph of Umatilla Chemical Depot Category:1941 establishments in Oregon Category:Military installations in Oregon Category:Buildings and structures in Morrow County, Oregon Category:Buildings and structures in Umatilla County, Oregon Category:United States chemical weapons depots Category:Superfund sites in Oregon Category:Military Superfund sites ","title":"Umatilla Chemical Depot"},{"id":"2567084","text":"James \\"Jimmy\\" Boyle (born 17 May 1944) is a Scottish former gangster and convicted murderer who became a sculptor and novelist after his release from prison. ==Biography== In 1967, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of another gangland figure, William \\"Babs\\" Rooney, but released after serving fourteen years. He has always denied killing Rooney but has acknowledged having been a violent and sometimes ruthless moneylender from the Gorbals, one of the roughest and most deprived areas of Glasgow. During his incarceration in the special unit of Barlinnie Prison, he turned to art and wrote an autobiography, A Sense of Freedom (1977), which has since been filmed and David Hayman played the role of Boyle. In 1979, whilst still a prisoner at Barlinnie, he was commissioned to produce a memorial statue of poet William McGonagall. Various difficulties associated with the project meant that the work was never completed. Upon his release from prison on 26 October 1981, he moved to Edinburgh to continue his artistic career. He designed the largest concrete sculpture in Europe called \\"Gulliver\\" for the Craigmillar Festival Society in 1976. In 1983, Boyle set up the Gateway Exchange with his wife, Sarah, and artist Evlynn Smith; a charitable organisation offering art therapy workshops to recovering drug addicts and ex-convicts. Though the project secured funding from private sources (including actor Sir Sean Connery, comedian Sir Billy Connolly and John Paul Getty) it lasted only a few years. In 1994, his son James, a drug addict, was murdered in the Oatlands neighbourhood of Glasgow.Son of reformed gangland killer stabbed to death, The Independent, 16 May 1994 Boyle has published Pain of Confinement: Prison Diaries (1984), and a novel, Hero of the Underworld (1999).

He also wrote a novel, A Stolen Smile, which is about the theft of the Mona Lisa and how it ends up hidden on a Scottish housing estate. It was rumoured that Disney bought the film rights, but Boyle has denied this. In 1998, he was named as a financial donor of the Labour Party. The character Nicky Dryden in the 1999 film The Debt Collector is reportedly loosely based on Boyle. He divides his time between France and Morocco with his second wife, Kate Fenwick, a British actress.

His youngest brother, Pieter, would also become a painter. His father painted carriages for a living, and in 1875 the fourteen-year-old Willem was apprenticed to a carriage maker to learn the same trade. In his spare time, he copied prints he found in magazines, and a year later he enrolled in the evening class at the Royal Academy of Visual Art in The Hague. The following year, he was admitted at the studio of Jacob Maris. In the three years that he remained here, it is probable that he got to know many of the leading lights of the Hague School. Maris also sent De Zwart on a journey to the coast, without drawing materials, and had him work out his impressions directly on canvas when he returned to the studio. De Zwart made several copies of works by 16th and 17th century masters in the Mauritshuis. He was most interested in the works of Johannes Vermeer, Paulus Potter, and Rembrandt, but studied paintings by German and Italian masters, as well. Sometimes he produced copies on commission. In this period, he also made detailed studies of animals, concentrating particularly on their legs, heads and snouts. De Zwart developed a fastidious painting style with a sober, predominantly brown palette. Willem de Zwart lived and worked until 1894 in The Hague and from 1900 to 1905 in Amsterdam. His work has a wide range of subjects: landscapes, cityscapes, portraits and still life, rendered in a naturalistic or impressionist style. His work shows affinity with the people and city-oriented Amsterdam Impressionism. In his choice of subjects belonged to the Hague School and in his style and his exuberant use of color to the school of Amsterdam Impressionism. He is also known as the \\"Hague Breitner\\" because of the similarity of his work to that of George Hendrik Breitner. He painted his landscapes, figure paintings and still lifes with smooth, bold brushstrokes. De Zwart applied the paint thickly, sometimes straight from the tube, with bright colors, exuberant reds, yellows and blues, giving his paintings special vibrancy. ==Sources== *Sillevis, John and Tabak, Anne, The Hague School Book, Waanders Uitgegevers, Zwolle, 2004 (pp. 391–397) *Marius, Gerharda Hermina, Dutch Painters of the 19th Century, The Antique Collectors' Club, Woodbridge, Suffolk (pp. 218–219) ==See also== * Johannes Evert Hendrik Akkeringa ==External links== *A number of his works at mutualart.com *Dutch Art in the Nineteenth Century/The Younger Masters of the Hague School.

The construction of the Delta Works was a response to the widespread damage and loss of life in the North Sea flood of 1953. == Surge barrier == The longest dam in the Delta Works, the nine-kilometer-long Oosterscheldekering (kering meaning barrier) was initially designed, and partly built, as a closed dam, but after public protestshttps://www.omroepzeeland.nl/nieuws/93500/Stormvloedkering-had-er- nooit-mogen-komen-video, huge sluice-gate-type doors were installed in the remaining four kilometers. These doors are normally open, but can be closed under adverse weather conditions. In this way, the saltwater marine life behind the dam is preserved and fishing can continue, while the land behind the dam is safe from the water. On 4 October 1986, Queen Beatrix officially opened the dam for use by saying the well-known words: \\"De stormvloedkering is gesloten. De Deltawerken zijn voltooid. Zeeland is veilig.\\" (The flood barrier is closed. The Delta Works are completed. Zeeland is safe.) At the artificial island Neeltje-Jans, at one end of the barrier, a plaque is installed with the words: \\"Hier gaan over het tij, de maan, de wind en wij\\" (\\"Here the tide is ruled by the moon, the wind and us (the Dutch)\\"). == Construction == Oosterscheldekering stone layers Oosterscheldekering (center) North-eastern section of Oosterscheldekering The Oosterscheldekering was the most difficult to build and most expensive part of the Delta works. Work on the dam took more than a decade. It was constructed by a consortium of contractors comprising Ballast Nedam, Boskalis Westminster, Baggermaatschappij Breejenhout, Hollandse Aanneming Maatschappij, Hollandse Beton Maatschappij, Van Oord-Utrecht, Stevin Baggeren, Stevin Beton en Waterbouw, Adriaan Volker Baggermaatschappij, Adriaan Volker Beton en Waterbouw and Aannemerscombinatie Zinkwerken. Construction started in April 1976 and was completed in June 1986. The road over the dam was ready for use in November 1987. The road was opened by the former queen, Princess Juliana on 5 November 1987, exactly 457 years after the St Felix Day's flood of 1530, which had washed away a large chunk of Zeeland, upstream of the new barrier's position. To facilitate the building, an artificial island, Neeltje-Jans, was created in the middle of the estuary. When the construction was finished, the island was rebuilt to be used as education center for visitors and as a base for maintenance works. The dam is based on 65 concrete pillars with 62 steel doors, each 42 meters wide. The parts were constructed in a dry dock. The area was flooded and a small fleet of special construction ships lifted the pillars and placed them in their final positions. Each pillar is between 35 and 38.75 meters high and weighs 18000 tonnes. The dam is designed to last more than 200 years. The Oosterscheldekering is sometimes referred to as the eighth Wonder of the World. It has been declared one of the modern Seven Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. == Construction fleet == Detailed view of the Oosterscheldekering Four ships were custom designed and built for this project: * Mytilus, a ship equipped with various ground working tools, such as needles to make the seabed denser and more stable. * Cardium, a ship to transport and lay a special foil carpet on the seabed for the pillars to rest on. * Ostrea, a ship capable of lifting a concrete pillar from the dry dock and placing it accurately on a special foil on the seabed. The ship is 85 meters long and has a portal of 50 meters high. The ship can only lift 10000 tonnes, but as a large part of the pillar is underwater, it is not necessary for the ship to be able to lift the full 18000 tonnes. This ship is considered the flagship of the construction fleet, mainly because of its larger size and power in comparison to the other ships. * Macoma, a ship that works closely with the Ostrea, cleaning the foil assisting in placing the pillars accurately in their final position. The ships are named after various types of shellfish. == Operation == The dam is manually operated but if human control fails, an electronic security system acts as a backup. A Dutch law regulates the conditions under which the dam is allowed to close. The water levels must be at least three meters above regular sea level before the doors can be completely shut. Each sluice gate is closed once a month for testing. Emergency procedures are tested on pre-scheduled dates. Once the test is passed, the shutters are quickly opened again to create a minimum amount of effect on tidal movements and the local marine ecosystem. It takes approximately one hour to close a door. The cost of operation is €17 million per year. The full dam has been closed twenty-seven times since 1986, due to water levels exceeding or being predicted to exceed the three meters. The last time was on 10 February 2020, because of Storm Ciara.https://www.rijkswaterstaat.nl/nieuws/2020/02/storm-en-hoogwater-zorgen- voor-drie-gesloten-stormvloedkeringen.aspx == References == == Further reading == * == External links == * *Satellite view from Google Maps * DeltaWorks.org – DeltaWorks.Org about Oosterscheldekering.

Hit Music existed for almost nine years, supplying the official UK music charts (as compiled by Gallup and later OCC/CIN). The founding editors were Graham Walker and Tony Brown. The first issue was published 5.09.1992 (chart date: 12.09.1992), the last issue 5.05.2001 (no. 439). Originally it ran parallel to Music Week′s other chart newsletter ChartsPlus (edited also by Graham Walker and Tony Brown), which had been established in May 1991, shortly after the demise of Record Mirror. ChartsPlus featured the singles chart with positions 76 to 200, albums chart positions 76 to 150, plus several genre and format chart, details on every Top 75 new entry, radio playlists (later the E.R.A. Top 100 Airplay charts) and statistics. An annual subscription to ChartsPlus cost £495. In September 1992, Spotlight Publications, publishers of Music Week, started Hit Music as a cheaper alternative. For only £110 Hit Music printed the singles chart (Top 75+25, i.e. with compressed positions 76 to 100), artist albums (Top 100), compilation albums (Top 50), rock chart and dance chart (Top 20s), US Top 10s, plus details on Top 75 new entries, chart statistics, year-to-date charts (singles, albums, singles acts, album acts, Top 30s) listings of BPI awards, and number ones. From issue no. 36 (5.06.1993) Hit Music printed the E.R.A. Top 100 Airplay charts, and from 8.01.1994 (issue no. 66) the Top 40 Network Chart (later called The Pepsi Chart). In November 1994 Charts Plus ceased publication and from issue no. 111 (19.11.1994) Hit Music printed the (uncompressed) Top 200 Singles, Top 150 Artists Albums and Top 50 Compilations. From issue no. 211 (2.11.1996) the Artist Albums chart extended to a Top 200. Top 100 Airplay chart was dropped from issue 294 (20.06.1998). The last issue published was no. 439 (5.05.2001). Hit Music folded together with several other Music Week newsletters. By autumn 2001, a successor publication to Hit Music was founded, independent of Music Week, in order to publish the British Top 200 charts: ChartsPlus (\\"Charts+Plus\\", not to be confused with the 1990s publication mentioned above), which is now called UKChartsPlus. == See also == * UK Singles Chart * UK Albums Chart * Music Week * Record Mirror * UKChartsPlus == External links == *Charts Plus *Bibliography of British Chart books Category:1992 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:2001 disestablishments in the United Kingdom Category:Music magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Weekly magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Defunct magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Magazines established in 1992 Category:Magazines disestablished in 2001 Category:Listings magazines ","title":"Hit Music"},{"id":"2567110","text":"Club Atlético Chacarita Juniors (usually known simply as Chacarita) is an Argentine football club headquartered in Villa Crespo, Buenos Aires, while the stadium is located in Villa Maipú, General San Martín Partido of Gran Buenos Aires. The squad currently plays at Argentine Primera División, the top division of the Argentine football league system. ==History== División Intermedia title. Torneo Metropolitano champions. The club was founded on 1 May 1906, in an anarchist LibraryZmag.org on the boundary between the Villa Crespo and Chacarita neighbourhoods. After a short period of institutional crisis, the club was re-opened in 1919. The football squad promoted to Primera División in 1924, and continued playing at the top level after football became professional in 1931. In 1940 Chacarita was relegated to the second division, but it lasted only one season. The team then moved to the General San Martín Partido in Greater Buenos Aires, next to the autonomous city of Buenos Aires. In 1956 Chacarita was relegated to the second division again, and won that championship the following year returning to Primera División. After 10 consecutive years at the top level, Chacarita won its only first division title, the 1969 Metropolitano championship. In the following years the team performed badly and was relegated all the way down to the 3rd division in 1980. In 1984 Chacarita came back to the first division, but because of Hooliganism by some of its fans, the club was punished with a suspension for a month and a loss of 10 points; having missing those points, Chacarita couldn't avoid a new relegation to the second division. After a long tenure in lower divisions (including the Primera C), Chacarita came back to the top division in 1999, where the team remained until 2004 Torneo Clausura, when it was relegated to the Primera B Nacional. In the 2008–09 season the club finished 2nd, after a 1–0 victory against Platense, with a goal scored in the last seconds of the match. This victory secured Chacarita a return to Primera División after five years of being relegated. At the end of 2011–12 season, Chacarita finished 20th and therefore the Funebreros had to play two matches against Nueva Chicago (winner of Primera B Metropolitana's Torneo Reducido) to avoid being relegated to the lower division. Nueva Chicago won the series (1–0 and 1–1) and Chacarita was subsequently relegated.\\"En un final para el infarto, Chicago se quedó con el ascenso y condenó a Chacarita\\" , Clarín, 30 June 2012 ==Kit evolution== {    } (1) Used during the 1931 championship as a tribute to club's first jersey.El Nacimiento de una Pasión: Historia de los Clubes de Fútbol, Alejandro Fabbri, editorial Capital Intelectual (2006) – ==Nickname== The team got the nickname of Funebreros (\\"Undertakers\\") because its ground was near the La Chacarita Cemetery. The red color in its jersey (apart from black and white) is a reference to its anarchist origins. ==Stadium== Estadio Chacarita Juniors. Chacarita's stadium was reopened on 30 January 2011, after its closure for a total rebuilt (which consisted in replacing the old wood seats for the more modern cement structures, according to safety regulations) since May 2008. As part of the celebration for the reopening, the club organized a friendly match between Chacarita and Argentinos Juniors (which ended 0–0). For this special event only 13,260 seats were available. Once the remodelling is totally finished, the stadium will be able to host an attendance of 35,000.Chacarita anuncia inauguración del nuevo estadio The Governor of Buenos Aires Province, Daniel Scioli, was the most notable presence in the event and was the person who cut the ribbon to declare the stadium officially reopened. This act was made in front of the Isaac López stand, named as a tribute to the legendary goalkeeper who played the most games for Chacarita (343 matches, from 1937 to 1952).Aniversario del fallecimiento de Isaac López Finally, a colorful set of fireworks closed the ceremony in Villa Maipú.Chacarita estrenó su nuevo estadio The new stadium was erected in the same location where the old one was, in the Villa Maipú neighborhood, General San Martín Partido.

Also known as TFE or trifluoroethyl alcohol, this colourless, water-miscible liquid has a smell reminiscent of ethanol. Due to the electronegativity of the trifluoromethyl group, this alcohol exhibits a stronger acidic character compared to ethanol. ==Synthesis== Trifluoroethanol is produced industrially by hydrogenation or the hydride reduction of derivatives of trifluoroacetic acid, such as the esters or acyl chloride. TFE can also be prepared by hydrogenolysis of compounds of generic formula CF3−CHOH−OR (where R is hydrogen or an alkyl group containing from one to eight carbon atoms), in the presence of a palladium containing catalyst deposited on activated charcoal. As a co-catalyst for this conversion tertiary aliphatic amines like triethylamine are commonly employed. ==Uses== Trifluoroethanol is used as a solvent in organic chemistry. Oxidations of sulfur compounds using hydrogen peroxide are effectively conducted in TFE. It can also be used as a protein denaturant. In biology TFE is used as a co-solvent in protein folding studies with NMR spectroscopy: this solvent can effectively solubilize both peptides and proteins. Depending upon its concentration, TFE can strongly affect the three-dimensional structure of proteins. Industrially trifluoroethanol is employed as a solvent for nylon as well as in applications of the pharmaceutical field. Trifluoroethanol is a key precursor for the inhaled anaesthetic isoflurane, listed on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Trifluoroethanol is also used in biochemistry as an inhibitor to study enzymes. It competitively inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase for example. ==Reactions== Oxidation of trifluoroethanol yields trifluoroacetaldehyde or trifluoroacetic acid. It also serves as a source of the trifluoroethoxy group for various chemical reactions (Still-Gennari modification of HWE reaction). 2,2,2-Trifluoroethyl vinyl ether, an inhaled drug introduced clinically under the tradename Fluoromar, features a vinyl ether of trifluorethanol. This species was prepared by the reaction of trifluoroethanol with acetylene. TFE forms stable complexes with Lewis bases such as THF or pyridine through hydrogen bonding, yielding 1:1 adducts. CF3CH2OH is classified as a hard Lewis acid and its acceptor properties are discussed in the ECW model yielding EA = 2.07 and CA = 1.06. ==Safety== Trifluoroethanol is classified as toxic to blood, the reproductive system, bladder, brain, upper respiratory tract and eyes. Research has shown it to be a testicular toxicant in rats and dogs.Fischer Scientific MSDS ==See also== *Trifluoromethanol ==References== ==External links== * Halocarbon Fluorochemicals * United States Patent number 4,647,706 \\"Process for the synthesis of 2,2,2-Trifluoroethanol and 1,1,1,3,3,3-Hexafluoroisopropanol\\" Category:Halogenated solvents Category:Primary alcohols Category:GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators Category:Glycine receptor agonists Category:Sedatives Category:Hypnotics Category:Halohydrins Category:Trifluoromethyl compounds ","title":"2,2,2-Trifluoroethanol"},{"id":"2567138","text":"Bozo or bozo may refer to: ==People== *Bozo people, a fishing people of the central Niger delta in Mali **Bozo language, languages of the Bozo people *Frédéric Bozo, history Professor at the University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle *Bozo Miller (1918–2008), American restaurant owner, Gastronomical Champion of competitive eating, and Guinness World Record holder ==Art, entertainment, and media== ===Fictional characters and mascots=== *Bozo (mascot), a former wildcat kept as a live mascot for the University of New Hampshire *Bozo the Clown, a clown character in the United States *Bozo the Iron Man, a 1930s/40s era comic book superhero ===Film and television=== *Bozo (film), a 2013 Japanese drama film *The Bozo Show, locally produced children's television program on WGN-TV in Chicago and on WGN America ===Music=== *Bozo (album), the debut album of the singer/songwriter Lida Husik * \\"Bozo\\", a 1951 song by Félix Leclerc from his debut album, Chante ses derniers succès sur disques *\\"Bozos\\", a single by the UK band The Levellers *Bozo Ratliff, rockabilly singer from 1950s *Bozo, an album by American rapper Saint Dog ==Computing== *Bozo bit, a copy protection system in 1980s Apple Macintosh operating system *Bozo filter or email filtering, the processing of email to organize it according to specified criteria *Bozo sort, a particularly ineffective sorting algorithm based on the generate and test paradigm ==Slang== *Bozo, a colloquial vulgarism for the prostitute in Georgian language *Bozo, a slang phrase for an idiot ==Other uses== *Spee De Bozo, J.

It lies 3 miles north-west of Ballymena, on the banks of the River Main, and is part of Mid and East Antrim district. It is a predominantly Protestant area. It had a population of 2,569 people in the 2011 Census. ==History== Cullybackey was part of the ancient kingdom of Dál nAraidi. Evidence of ancient dwellers in the area have been found throughout the years, including the remains of Crannogs and Souterrains. Christian Missionary Mackevet erected a monastery in the area. It is said that when Mackevet first approached the Irish Chieftain MacAfee about this matter the two began to argue over it and Mackevet, who was a large man raised his fist into the chieftains face and said \\"I'm a man of peace, but smell that MacAfee\\". This won him the argument and the monastery was built, supplying the area with a place of learning for many centuries afterwards. In 1778 a corps was raised by John Dickey of Cullybackey House, They named themselves 'The Cullybackey Volunteers'. In 1847, the village contained 235 residents and contained about 50 houses. ==Notable Cullybackey people== *Matilda Cullen Knowles, scientist, was born here in 1864. * Jessica Kurten, Olympic horse rider and representative of Ireland. * Neil 'Smutty' Robinson, a well-known motorcycle racer and British 250cc Championship winner, who was killed, aged 24, in 1986. * Steven Davis - Rangers and Northern Ireland Footballer. *Ella Young, celtic poet, mythologist and Feminist activist was born here in 1867. == Places of interest == * Arthur Cottage, the ancestral home of Chester A.

They are called Kapsiki in Cameroon, and Kamwe (Higi) in Nigeria. Together they amount to about 120,000 people. Their language, Psekiye or Kamwe, consists of eleven dialects including Nkafa, Sina, Ghye, Humsi, Dakwa and Tilli and belongs to the Chadic language family. In Cameroon, the Kapsiki live on a plateau in the Far North Province in the center of the Mandara Mountains. They are considered one of Cameroon's Kirdi (pagan) ethnic groups due to their resistance to Islamisation during the Fulani jihad of Modibo Adama and Hama Yaji. In Nigeria, the Kamwe live on the slopes of the mountains and the western plain. The Kapsiki have been living in this area for five centuries, long before the great slave hunts of the 19th century, but by this isolated habitat they have been able to maintain themselves against the Fulbe. This also applies to the other peoples of Mandara region, such as the Mafa, Mofu, Podoko Guisiga, or Daba. The mountain region has a kaleidoscope of local cultures. The Kapsiki live in villages of 2000-6000 people, and subsist on livestock farming, agriculture and - in the village of Rumsiki in particular - on tourism. The Malima Project has been helping Kapsiki populations in Cameroon with educational projects aimed at primary schooling. The Malima Project has created a documentary and organized events to promote its educational activities in the area.

A sailor suit is a uniform traditionally worn by enlisted seamen in a navy or other governmental sea services. It later developed into a popular clothing style for children, especially as dress clothes. ==Origins and history== In the Royal Navy, the sailor suit, also called naval rig, is known as Number One dress and is worn by able rates and leading hands. It is primarily ceremonial, although it dates from the old working rig of Royal Navy sailors which has continuously evolved since its first introduction in 1857.Royal Navy, The History of Rating Uniforms Versions have been adopted by many navies from around the world. The flap collar is perhaps the most recognizable item of the sailor suit. It is often considered lucky to touch a sailor's collar.Encyclopedia of Superstitions 1949, Edwin Radford, Mona A. Radford, Kessinger Publishing (p. 208) The bell-bottomed trousers were designed so that they could be rolled up easily when scrubbing the decks. ==As children's clothing== Prince Albert Edward (the future Edward VII of the United Kingdom) in a sailor suit, by Franz Xaver Winterhalter, 1846 Photograph of a boy on Oxford Street, Sydney, Australia, wearing a sailor suit, with a sennit straw hat at his feet In 1846, the four-year-old Albert Edward, Prince of Wales was given a scaled-down version of the uniform worn by ratings on the Royal Yacht. He wore his miniature sailor suit during a cruise off the Channel Islands that September, delighting his mother and the public. Popular engravings, including the famous portrait done by Winterhalter, spread the idea, and by the 1870s the sailor suit had become a fashionable dress for both boys and girls in many countries. Some Western cartoon and comic characters use a sailor suit as their trademarks; examples include Popeye, Donald Duck, and Fiddler Pig. Sailor suits have been worn by the members of the Vienna Boys' Choir on their international tours. A female version of the sailor suit, the sailor dress, was popularly known in early 20th century America as a Peter Thomson dress after a naval tailor with outlets in New York and Philadelphia. ==Asian school uniforms== Many schools in some Asian countries, including Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, North Korea, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand, have adopted sailor outfits as a school uniform. ===Japan=== Sailor suits are especially common in Japanese girls' schools, known as sailor fuku by the Japanese. They are so common that the image of the outfit has evolved to be strongly associated with youth and female adolescence in popular culture. As a result, sailor uniforms are seen very frequently in Japanese dramas, movies, anime, manga, music videos and concert performances of pop teen idol groups. ===Philippines=== Just like in Japan, sailor uniforms are also common in Philippine schools, particularly in high schools. Most public schools adopted the sailor uniform as the official uniform for the girls and some of them adopted with derivatives. ==See also== *Sailor dress *Marinière *Telnyashka *Uniforms of the United States Navy == References == == External links == * National Maritime Museum Category:19th-century fashion Category:Children's clothing Category:Sailing Category:Suits (clothing) Category:Uniforms Category:Maritime culture ","title":"Sailor suit"},{"id":"2567148","text":"Bossiney (, meaning Cyni's dwelling) is a village in north Cornwall, England, United Kingdom.

Bossiney was the Parliamentary seat of Francis Drake who in 1584 gave his election speech from Bossiney Mound. It was also the Parliamentary seat in 1584 of Sir Francis Bacon. The mace and seal of the borough are still preserved and show the name of the borough as 'Tintaioel' (they are thought to be from the 16th century).Canner, A. C. (1982) The Parish of Tintagel, pp. 62–65 Despite electing two MPs, the Borough of Bossiney in the 18th-century was described as a very small place with scarcely twenty houses and those no better than cottages! ==Places of interest== Hendra Cross Bossiney lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). A nearby beach is known as Bossiney Haven. Notable buildings include the Old Borough House, Bossiney Court (both houses are 17th century and later) and the Methodist chapel (1860). All these are listed Grade II. At the nearby crossroads stands Hendra Cross or Pentaly Cross (towards Trevillet): it has been moved from its former position due to road widening in 1959 (\\"about one and half miles north east of Bossiney, at Pentaly\\"). Willapark on the coast nearby was an Iron Age cliff castle and at Lye Rock the barque 'Iota' was wrecked in 1893 (see the Tintagel article). Willapark Manor stands in wooded grounds and is now an hotel; Jill Pool is the site of the former borough gaol. To the east of Bossiney lie the remains of an earthen ringwork and bailey, which were discovered during archaeological excavations during the 1840s. The castle is not mentioned in surviving contemporary documents, and it is uncertain when or by whom it was built. However, it was probably built in the late 11th or 12th century.Rose (1992) \\"Bossiney Castle\\", p. 141 ==See also== * Bossiney (UK Parliament constituency) ==References== Bibliography * Rose, Peter (1992) \\"Bossiney Castle\\", Cornish Archaeology 31 pp. 138–142. * Williams, Michael (ca. 1970) Bossiney.

Cornish Language Partnership. is a village in Cornwall, England. It is at an ancient crossing point of the River Fal and today is on the A390 road six miles west of St Austell and eight miles east of Truro.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 204 Truro & Falmouth Grampound with Creed (where the 2011 census population is included) is the civil parish of which the village of Grampound and the village of Creed are the main settlements. Formerly, part of Grampound was in the parish of Creed and part was in the parish of Probus. The name Grampound comes from the Norman French: grand (great), pont (bridge), referring to the bridge over the River Fal, with its spelling varying over the last 600 years following the name Ponsmur (Cornish) which was recorded in 1308. The population of Grampound with Creed was 654 in the 2011 census. ==History== The area around Grampound was settled in prehistoric times, and in the early medieval period the parish of Creed and the manor of Tybesta were established here. Grampound grew after the Norman conquest as the main crossing place on the Fal, a focus for travellers and traders moving between west Cornwall and England. Thus Grampound became one of the most important towns in medieval Cornwall with a rich and vibrant history. The bridge from which the town took its name is first recorded in 1296. The first charter was granted by the Earl of Cornwall in 1332 and the town remained important until the 15th century. Thereafter it declined and John Norden refers to the inhabitants as \\"few and poore\\" in his account published in 1584.Balchin, W. G. V. (1954) Cornwall. London: Hodder & Stoughton; p. 87 It was formerly considered a town and the Grampound constituency elected two members to the Unreformed House of Commons from the reign of Edward VI until it was disfranchised in 1821, after a corruption scandal that led to the conviction and imprisonment of several men for bribery. MPs who represented the town include William Noye, John Hampden, Grey Cooper and Charles Wolfran Cornwall. The seal of the borough of Grampound was \\"A bridge of two arches over a river, the dexter end in perspective showing the passage over at the sinister and a tree issuing from the base against the bridge on the centre an escutcheon of the arms of the family of Cornwall viz. Arg. a lion rampant Gu. within a bordure Sa.\\" Grampound also gives its name to Grampound Road which is 3 kilometres (2 mi) to the north west. ==Government== Grampound is a ward, along with Creed, of Grampound with Creed Parish which is part of Cornwall Council unitary authority. The current county councillor is Bob Egerton (Independent). Before the formation of the unitary authority in 2009, Grampound was part of Restormel Borough Council. Grampound is in the St Austell and Newquay constituency and the Member for Parliament is Steve Double (Conservative). Notably in the past Grampound was a 'rotten borough' returning two members of parliament of its own until 1821. ==Geography== Grampound lies in the valley of the River Fal north of Tregony. It is on the A390 road 10 kilometres (6 mi) west of St Austell and 13 kilometres (8 mi) east of Truro. Grampound's linear layout is of Norman origin, with long thin burgage plots extending away from the main street, Fore Street (A390). Most of the village core is a Conservation Area, and there are many listed buildings on Fore Street, for example the local school and the Town Hall. There is a range of buildings of different ages. ==Demography== The population of Grampound is a little less than that of Grampound with Creed which was 654 in the 2011 census. ==Transport== The A390 runs through the centre of Grampound, in summer when the A30 is congested, the A390 is an alternative route. It is an issue for residents. Pavements in some parts of the village are narrow or non- existent. Traffic speed is an issue through the village. A bypass was considered in 1996, when a route north of the village was favoured, but the plans were rejected, partly due to local protests and partly because Grampound is not large enough to warrant a bypass. A regular bus service runs to Truro, 8 miles to the west, and St Austell, six miles to the east. ==Economy== There are a number of local businesses including Grampound Village Store, Tristan Hay Pine and Period furniture, and The Dolphin Inn. Many people commute to work in the nearby centres of St Austell and Truro. There are a number of businesses run from home. The tannery industry was important in the past in Grampound. The principal leather tannery, which closed in 2002, was owned by the Croggon family. It consists of several large buildings and surrounding fields on the southern side of the village. This area is being developed into 55 new homes and office space. ==Culture and community== There is an annual carnival on the first Saturday in September which includes a procession along Fore Street (A390) which is closed temporarily. Markets are held in Grampound Hall twice a month on a Saturday. One of these markets is run by Transition Grampound and the other by the village hall committee. The new village hall was opened in 2004 with National Lottery funding. This hall is also an arts venue and regularly hosts performances of drama, dance, and music. Notable past performances include the Norwegian percussionist Terje Isungset performing ice music in 2012. A local amateur dramatic group, The Grampound Players, has also performed in recent years. The recreation ground is managed by a charity (Grampound with Creed War Memorial Recreation Ground and Public Hall) in Grampound as a public space. It is host to the carnival each year and also to Grampound Football Club who won support from Sport England's Protecting Playing Fields Olympic legacy for it to be resurfaced. A small museum, the Grampound with Creed Heritage Centre, is located in the Town Hall and hosts a photograph archive online. Grampound was named Calor Village of the Year for West England 2007/8. The judges commended the community atmosphere of the area. A plaque celebrating the success is now displayed on the Town Hall. Landmarks in Grampound include the market cross, St Nun's church, and the Town Hall and clock tower in the centre of the village. A war memorial plaque is on the wall of the town hall. The Dolphin Inn is a little further down the hill. Grampound with Creed Primary School, Grampound Hall, and the recreation ground are near the Fal bridge. ==Education== Grampound with Creed Primary School is supported by the Diocese of Truro. It has between 50 and 60 pupils. It is currently undergoing a change to become part of a Multi-Academy Trust. The primary school has recently been extended. ==Religious sites== St Nun's Church and Town Hall The Church of St Nun is the only remaining religious site in Grampound. There is the nearby, older church of St Crida in Creed and they are both managed by the same parochial church council and part of the churches led by the Rector at Probus, Ladock, Grampound with Creed and St.Erme Parishes. There were a number of chapels in Grampound which have since been converted into dwellings. ==Sport== Grampound is home to Grampound Football Club and Grampound Bowling Club both of whom have facilities at the recreation ground. ==Notable people== One of Grampound's most famous residents was John Hampden, a politician representing Grampound in 1621 who later, in 1642, was one of the Five Members whose attempted unconstitutional arrest by King Charles I in the House of Commons of England in 1642 sparked the Civil War. Other parliamentarians include William Noy, noted British jurist and MP for Grampound 1603–1614, Charles Wolfran Cornwall, MP for Grampound 1768–1774, and Grey Cooper, MP for Grampound 1768–1774. The Scottish sculptor Pilkington Jackson was born here. ==See also== * Grampound (UK Parliament constituency) (1553–1821) * Tybesta ==References== ==External links== * Grampound with Creed Parish Council * Photo Archive of Grampound Heritage Project Category:Villages in Cornwall ","title":"Grampound"},{"id":"2567169","text":"Walter Horace Bruford, FBA (14 July 1894 - 28 June 1988) was a British scholar of German literature.

He made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 13 July 2003. Following that appearance, the character returned full-time on 12 April 2004. ==Storylines== Sean is introduced as a gay colleague of Martin Platt (Sean Wilson) and Karl Foster (Chris Finch). Some months after his first appearance Sean comes to Coronation Street, desperately looking for somewhere to live. Karl's ex-boyfriend Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) recognises Sean and takes him for a drink at The Rovers. When Todd's mother Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver) meets Sean she likes him and offers him a place to stay. Her other son, Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas), is not pleased but later warms to the idea. Sean gets a job at Underworld, where he makes friends with Fiz Brown (Jennie McAlpine) and Kelly Crabtree (Tupele Dorgu). Violet Wilson (Jenny Platt), Sean's close friend, moves to the Street and begins dating Jamie Baldwin (Rupert Hill), who Sean also becomes close to. When Jamie seems to be losing interest in Violet she fears he is secretly gay, she asks Sean to spend time with him to see if he can find out — unaware that Sean has fallen for Jamie himself. However, Sean is shocked to discover that Jamie is actually in love with his stepmother, Frankie Baldwin (Debra Stephenson). Sean supports both Violet and Jamie when Violet ends their relationship. When Violet suffers an ectopic pregnancy she is told her chances of conceiving have been reduced. Violet then becomes desperate to have a baby and suggests she and Sean should consider having a child together. Sean agrees and, despite her fertility issues, Violet becomes pregnant via self- administered artificial insemination (after the two try and fail to have sex). Sean accompanies Violet to her 12-week scan, where he becomes attracted to the sonographer, Marcus Dent (Charlie Condou). Violet matchmakes between the two and they begin dating, although they hit a rough patch when Sean tricks Marcus into telling him Violet is expecting a baby boy when she had wanted the gender to be a surprise. When Violet gets back together with Jamie, she begins to find Sean's presence during the pregnancy stifling, especially after he lends her and Jamie money for a flat deposit and begins coming and going as he pleases. When Violet realises she is in labour at the Rovers' it is Sean, not Jamie, at her side as Jamie is in London. Sean is delighted that he was the first person his son saw and bonds with Dylan while Violet is in hospital, upsetting both her and Jamie. Sean suggests calling him \\"Dylan Wilson-Tully\\" and asks Violet to put his name on the birth certificate. Violet ignores both suggestions, naming her son \\"Dylan James Wilson\\" and putting Jamie's name on the birth certificate. Fed up with Sean being a third wheel, Jamie and Violet move to London with Dylan, devastating Sean when Violet throws her mobile away so he can't contact her. Sean becomes close friends with Tom Kerrigan (Philip McGinley), a business partner of his boss, Carla Connor (Alison King) and begins to develop feelings for him. When Sean tries to kiss Tom, he tells him he is straight and actually interested in Sean's friend Kelly. Realising things are awkward between Sean and Tom, Marcus questions Sean, who lies and says Tom made a pass at him rather than the other way around. Marcus angrily punches Tom but is furious to then discover Sean was the one in the wrong. With Sean having already been jealous of Marcus's friendships with other gay men, Marcus realises there is no trust left in their relationship and departs for London. After joining a gym with Jason, Sean becomes attracted to fellow member Leon (Andrew Langtree). When Leon mistakenly thinks Jason is Sean's ex- boyfriend Sean doesn't correct him, and is pleased that Leon seems happy to hear he is single. However, Sean is left disappointed when it turns out that Leon is actually interested in Jason and \\"doesn't fancy camp men\\". Sean decides that he wants to track down Violet and Dylan, as his son would now be two years old. He finds Violet via a social networking site and sets up a page using Liz McDonald's (Beverley Callard) identity. However, the scheme backfires when Liz finds out what Sean has done and she fires him from the Rovers. She later softens towards him and reinstates him, and also has a word with Violet on Sean's behalf. Violet agrees to Sean visiting Dylan in London. However, on one of his visits, Sean is surprised to see Marcus at Violet's house, unaware they were still in touch. The two realise they still have feelings for one another and reunite. When Violet and Jamie split Sean begins looking after Dylan more often, with Dylan living with the pair for several weeks after Violet has a car accident. Marcus enjoys being part of Dylan's life and suggest they adopt a child of their own; however, Sean doesn't feel the need to have another child. The issue eventually drives the pair apart, with Sean later horrified to discover Marcus has begun a relationship with his close friend Maria Connor (Samia Ghadie), despite having shown no interest in women before. Sean accuses Marcus of only dating Maria to become a father to her son Liam and the two fall out. When Todd returns to Manchester after several years in London, Sean wonders if there is a chance for romance between them. However, Todd is only interested in getting Sean to spend money on him, turning his romantic attention to Marcus instead. Sean is shocked when he catches Marcus cheating on Maria with Todd and encourages him to be honest with both Maria and himself. Depressed at being alone, Sean goes on a night out to Manchester's gay village with his colleague Sinead Tinker (Katie McGlynn) and meets Billy Mayhew (Daniel Brocklebank). The two exchange phone numbers and meet again, but Sean is shocked when Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire) introduces Billy as the new local vicar a few days later. Although Sean struggles with Billy's job the two begin dating, with Sean even trying to become involved with the church. However, when Emily seems distant from Billy and unwilling to involve herself with his new ideas for the church, Sean accuses her of homophobia. Emily is upset and denies this, telling Sean she simply prefers more traditional church activities. Billy is angry with Sean and makes him apologise, telling Sean he has to put his parishioners first and that being gay in the church involves some discretion. The pair briefly split, but Emily matchmakes to bring them back together. Sean later accompanies the Underworld staff to an awards' ceremony, but events take a nasty turn when a group of boy racers cause the minibus driver Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) to swerve and crash the vehicle, which is now narrowly balancing on the edge of a quarry. Sean is one of the first people to awaken from unconsciousness, and he, Steve and Julie Carp (Katy Cavanagh) escape the wreckage. Steve flees as he comes to terms with the events, while Julie re-enters the vehicle to retrieve the trapped passengers. Sean looks after the staff once they are out, but he soon suffers a panic attack as the reality of the minibus crash dawns on him. Once everybody is out, Sean is the first person to realise that Carla is still trapped in the front seat of the minibus. Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) risks her life to save Carla, and nearly falls to her own death when the wreckage begins to slide off the edge of the quarry, but she leaps out just in time. When at the hospital, Sean is met by Billy, who reveals how proud he is of Sean. ==Characterisation== Antony Cotton (pictured) has revealed that playing Sean is easy because he just acts like himself. Antony Cotton said that playing Sean is easy because he just has to act like himself. Speaking to The People, Cotton said that Sean looks and he sounds like him. Cotton later admitted that not all of the reviews about him are positive. Some of the gay press have accused Cotton of making Sean a stereotype. Of this he said, \\"You've got people like Blanche Hunt, Emily Bishop and Norris Cole and there were the classic characters like Bet Lynch and Annie Walker. They're all more camp than Sean — I'm Grant Mitchell compared to them.\\" ==Development== In an interview with Digital Spy, Cotton was asked why Sean has always been so unlucky in love, he answered; \\"When I first came into the show, a lot of the old-school writers that are no longer here had never written a gay character. At that time, Raquel had just gone so they basically wrote Sean as Raquel. Hilda and Raquel are my favourite ever Corrie characters, and one of the reasons that I've always loved Raquel is that she was unlucky in love. Even when she was in the gutter battered and bruised, she was always looking up at the stars thinking that the next one was around the corner. I thought that was an interesting way to play Sean, so he's always unlucky in love because Raquel was, is the short answer! That's just the way it worked out — but I like playing that.\\" In January 2011, it was confirmed that Charlie Condou who played Sean's ex-boyfriend Marcus Dent between 2007 and 2008 would return to the serial. A Coronation Street spokesperson teased the upcoming reunion saying; \\"There are eventful times ahead for Sean as his old flame Marcus Dent returns to the cobbles, Marcus, arrives back in Weatherfield and the relationship between him and Sean is rekindled.\\" In September 2014, it was revealed that Sean would begin a relationship with a vicar named Billy portrayed by Daniel Brocklebank. Producer Stuart Blackburn said: \\"It's about time Sean had a romance, he's been unlucky in love for a long time. Billy is a great guy who is sincere about his feelings for Sean, but his first love is and always will be God and the Church. We will be exploring this very modern relationship in the coming months, and are delighted to have Daniel on board to play Billy.\\" Cotton added: \\"I am thrilled that Sean is to find love again especially with this unique and exciting storyline. I'm sure it'll have its ups and downs, but that's what makes Coronation Street great. Hopefully it will be tender, funny and honest. Heaven!\\" In January 2015, Cotton revealed in an interview that he was surprised by the positive response to Sean's relationship with Billy storyline. ==Reception== Antony Cotton has won a number of awards since the character's first appearance, including a prestigious National Television Award.

According to one definition it involves \\"paying critical attention to the practical values and theories which inform everyday actions, by examining practice reflectively and reflexively. This leads to developmental insight\\". A key rationale for reflective practice is that experience alone does not necessarily lead to learning; deliberate reflection on experience is essential. Reflective practice can be an important tool in practice-based professional learning settings where people learn from their own professional experiences, rather than from formal learning or knowledge transfer. It may be the most important source of personal professional development and improvement. It is also an important way to bring together theory and practice; through reflection a person is able to see and label forms of thought and theory within the context of his or her work. A person who reflects throughout his or her practice is not just looking back on past actions and events, but is taking a conscious look at emotions, experiences, actions, and responses, and using that information to add to his or her existing knowledge base and reach a higher level of understanding. ==History and background== Donald Schön Donald Schön's 1983 book The Reflective Practitioner introduced concepts such as reflection-on-action and reflection-in-action which explain how professionals meet the challenges of their work with a kind of improvisation that is improved through practice. However, the concepts underlying reflective practice are much older. Earlier in the 20th century, John Dewey was among the first to write about reflective practice with his exploration of experience, interaction and reflection. Soon thereafter, other researchers such as Kurt Lewin and Jean Piaget were developing relevant theories of human learning and development. Some scholars have claimed to find precursors of reflective practice in ancient texts such as Buddhist teachings and the Meditations of Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius. Central to the development of reflective theory was interest in the integration of theory and practice, the cyclic pattern of experience and the conscious application of lessons learned from experience. Since the 1970s, there has been a growing literature and focus around experiential learning and the development and application of reflective practice. As adult education professor David Boud and his colleagues explained: \\"Reflection is an important human activity in which people recapture their experience, think about it, mull it over and evaluate it. It is this working with experience that is important in learning.\\" When a person is experiencing something, he or she may be implicitly learning; however, it can be difficult to put emotions, events, and thoughts into a coherent sequence of events. When a person rethinks or retells events, it is possible to categorize events, emotions, ideas, etc., and to compare the intended purpose of a past action with the results of the action. Stepping back from the action permits critical reflection on a sequence of events. The emergence in more recent years of blogging has been seen as another form of reflection on experience in a technological age. ==Models== Many models of reflective practice have been created to guide reasoning about action. ===Borton 1970=== Terry Borton's reflective model (1970), as adapted by Gary Rolfe and colleagues (2001) Terry Borton's 1970 book Reach, Touch, and Teach popularized a simple learning cycle inspired by Gestalt therapy composed of three questions which ask the practitioner: What, So what, and Now what? Through this analysis, a description of a situation is given which then leads into the scrutiny of the situation and the construction of knowledge that has been learnt through the experience. Subsequently, practitioners reflect on ways in which they can personally improve and the consequences of their response to the experience. Borton's model was later adapted by practitioners outside the field of education, such as the field of nursing and the helping professions. ===Kolb and Fry 1975=== Adaptation of Kolb's reflective model Learning theorist David A. Kolb was highly influenced by the earlier research conducted by John Dewey and Jean Piaget. Kolb's reflective model highlights the concept of experiential learning and is centered on the transformation of information into knowledge. This takes place after a situation has occurred, and entails a practitioner reflecting on the experience, gaining a general understanding of the concepts encountered during the experience, and then testing these general understandings in a new situation. In this way, the knowledge that is formed from a situation is continuously applied and reapplied, building on a practitioner's prior experiences and knowledge. ===Argyris and Schön 1978=== Management researchers Chris Argyris and Donald Schön pioneered the idea of single-loop learning and double-loop learning in 1978. Their theory was built around the recognition and correction of a perceived fault or error. Single-loop learning is when a practitioner or organisation, even after an error has occurred and a correction is made, continues to rely on current strategies, techniques or policies when a situation again comes to light. Double-loop learning involves the modification of objectives, strategies or policies so that when a similar situation arises a new framing system is employed. Schön claimed to derive the notions of \\"reflection-on-action, reflection-in-action, responding to problematic situations, problem framing, problem solving, and the priority of practical knowledge over abstract theory\\" from the writings of John Dewey, although education professor Harvey Shapiro has argued that Dewey's writings offer \\"more expansive, more integrated notions of professional growth\\" than do Schön's. Schon advocated 2 types of reflective practice. Firstly, reflection- on-action, which involves reflecting on an experience that you have already had, or an action that you have already taken, and considering what could have been done differently, as well as looking at the positives from that interaction. The other type of reflection Schon notes is reflection-in-action, or reflecting on your actions as you are doing them, and considering issues like best practice throughout the process. For Schön, professional growth really begins when a person starts to view things with a critical lens, by doubting his or her actions. Doubt brings about a way of thinking that questions and frames situations as \\"problems\\". Through careful planning and systematic elimination of other possible problems, doubt is settled, and people are able to affirm their knowledge of the situation. Then people are able to think about possible situations and their outcomes, and deliberate about whether they carried out the right actions. ===Gibbs 1988=== Adaptation of the Gibbs reflective model Learning researcher Graham Gibbs discussed the use of structured debriefing to facilitate the reflection involved in Kolb's experiential learning cycle. Gibbs presents the stages of a full structured debriefing as follows: * (Initial experience) * Description *: \\"What happened? Don't make judgements yet or try to draw conclusions; simply describe.\\" * Feelings *: \\"What were your reactions and feelings? Again don't move on to analysing these yet.\\" * Evaluation *: \\"What was good or bad about the experience? Make value judgements.\\" * Analysis *: \\"What sense can you make of the situation? Bring in ideas from outside the experience to help you.\\" *: \\"What was really going on?\\" *: \\"Were different people's experiences similar or different in important ways?\\" * Conclusions (general) *: \\"What can be concluded, in a general sense, from these experiences and the analyses you have undertaken?\\" * Conclusions (specific) *: \\"What can be concluded about your own specific, unique, personal situation or way of working?\\" * Personal action plans *: \\"What are you going to do differently in this type of situation next time?\\" *: \\"What steps are you going to take on the basis of what you have learnt?\\" Gibbs' suggestions are often cited as \\"Gibbs' reflective cycle\\" or \\"Gibbs' model of reflection\\", and simplified into the following six distinct stages to assist in structuring reflection on learning experiences: * Description * Feelings * Evaluation * Analysis * Conclusions * Action plan ===Johns 1995=== Adaptation of the Johns reflective model Professor of nursing Christopher Johns designed a structured mode of reflection that provides a practitioner with a guide to gain greater understanding of his or her practice. It is designed to be carried out through the act of sharing with a colleague or mentor, which enables the experience to become learnt knowledge at a faster rate than reflection alone. Johns highlights the importance of experienced knowledge and the ability of a practitioner to access, understand and put into practice information that has been acquired through empirical means. Reflection occurs though \\"looking in\\" on one's thoughts and emotions and \\"looking out\\" at the situation experienced. Johns draws on the work of Barbara Carper to expand on the notion of \\"looking out\\" at a situation. Five patterns of knowing are incorporated into the guided reflection: the aesthetic, personal, ethical, empirical and reflexive aspects of the situation. Johns' model is comprehensive and allows for reflection that touches on many important elements. ===Brookfield 1998=== Adult education scholar Stephen Brookfield proposed that critically reflective practitioners constantly research their assumptions by seeing practice through four complementary lenses: the lens of their autobiography as learners of reflective practice, the lens of other learners' eyes, the lens of colleagues' experiences, and the lens of theoretical, philosophical and research literature. Reviewing practice through these lenses makes us more aware of the power dynamics that infuse all practice settings. It also helps us detect hegemonic assumptions—assumptions that we think are in our own best interests, but actually work against us in the long run. Brookfield argued that these four lenses will reflect back to us starkly different pictures of who we are and what we do. * Lens 1: Our autobiography as a learner. Our autobiography is an important source of insight into practice. As we talk to each other about critical events in our practice, we start to realize that individual crises are usually collectively experienced dilemmas. Analyzing our autobiographies allows us to draw insight and meanings for practice on a deep visceral emotional level. * Lens 2: Our learners' eyes. Seeing ourselves through learners' eyes, we may discover that learners are interpreting our actions in the way that we mean them. But often we are surprised by the diversity of meanings people read into our words and actions. A cardinal principle of seeing ourselves through learners' eyes is that of ensuring the anonymity of their critical opinions. We have to make learners feel safe. Seeing our practice through learners' eyes helps us teach more responsively. * Lens 3: Our colleagues' experiences. Our colleagues serve as critical mirrors reflecting back to us images of our actions. Talking to colleagues about problems and gaining their perspective increases our chance of finding some information that can help our situation. * Lens 4: Theoretical literature. Theory can help us \\"name\\" our practice by illuminating the general elements of what we think are idiosyncratic experiences. ==Application== Reflective practice has been described as an unstructured or semi-structured approach directing learning, and a self-regulated process commonly used in health and teaching professions, though applicable to all professions. Reflective practice is a learning process taught to professionals from a variety of disciplines, with the aim of enhancing abilities to communicate and making informed and balanced decisions. Professional associations such as the American Association of Nurse Practitioners are recognizing the importance of reflective practice and require practitioners to prepare reflective portfolios as a requirement to be licensed, and for yearly quality assurance purposes. ===Education=== The concept of reflective practice has found wide application in the field of education, for learners, teachers and those who teach teachers (teacher educators). Tsangaridou & O'Sullivan (1997) define reflection in education as \\"the act of thinking about, analyzing, assessing, or altering educational meanings, intentions, beliefs, decisions, actions, or products by focusing on the process of achieving them … The primary purpose of this action is to structure, adjust, generate, refine, restructure, or alter knowledge and actions that inform practice. Microreflection gives meaning to or informs day- to-day practice, and macroreflection gives meaning to or informs practice over time\\". Reflection is the key to successful learning for teachers and for learners. ====Students==== Students can benefit from engaging in reflective practice as it can foster the critical thinking and decision making necessary for continuous learning and improvement. When students are engaged in reflection, they are thinking about how their work meets established criteria; they analyze the effectiveness of their efforts, and plan for improvement. Rolheiser and et al. (2000) assert that \\"Reflection is linked to elements that are fundamental to meaningful learning and cognitive development: the development of metacognition – the capacity for students to improve their ability to think about their thinking; the ability to self-evaluate - the capacity for students to judge the quality of their work based on evidence and explicit criteria for the purpose of doing better work; the development of critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making; and the enhancement of teacher understanding of the learner.\\" (p 31-32) When teachers teach metacognitive skills, it promotes student self-monitoring and self-regulation that can lead to intellectual growth, increase academic achievement, and support transfer of skills so that students are able to use any strategy at any time and for any purpose. Guiding students in the habits of reflection requires teachers to approach their role as that of \\"facilitator of meaning- making\\" – they organize instruction and classroom practice so that students are the producers, not just the consumers, of knowledge. Rolheiser and colleagues (2000) state that \\"When students develop their capacity to understand their own thinking processes, they are better equipped to employ the necessary cognitive skills to complete a task or achieve a goal. Students who have acquired metacognitive skills are better able to compensate for both low ability and insufficient information.\\" (p. 34) The Ontario Ministry of Education (2007) describes many ways in which educators can help students acquire the skills required for effective reflection and self-assessment, including: modelling and/or intentionally teaching critical thinking skills necessary for reflection and self-assessment practices; addressing students' perceptions of self-assessment; engaging in discussion and dialogue about why self-assessment is important; allowing time to learn self-assessment and reflection skills; providing many opportunities to practice different aspects of the self-assessment and reflection process; and ensuring that parents/guardians understand that self-assessment is only one of a variety of assessment strategies that is utilized for student learning. ====Teachers==== The concept of reflective practice is now widely employed in the field of teacher education and teacher professional development and many programs of initial teacher education claim to espouse it. Education professor Hope Hartman has described reflective practice in education as teacher metacognition., indicating there is broad consensus that teaching effectively requires a reflective approach. Attard & Armour explain that \\"teachers who are reflective systematically collect evidence from their practice, allowing them to rethink and potentially open themselves to new interpretations\\". Teaching and learning are complex processes, and there is not one right approach. Reflecting on different approaches to teaching, and reshaping the understanding of past and current experiences, can lead to improvement in teaching practices. Schön's reflection-in-action can help teachers explicitly incorporate into their decision-making the professional knowledge that they gain from their experience in the classroom. As professor of education Barbara Larrivee argues, reflective practice moves teachers from their knowledge base of distinct skills to a stage in their careers where they are able to modify their skills to suit specific contexts and situations, and eventually to invent new strategies. In implementing a process of reflective practice teachers will be able to move themselves, and their schools, beyond existing theories in practice. Larrivee concludes that teachers should \\"resist establishing a classroom culture of control and become a reflective practitioner, continuously engaging in a critical reflection, consequently remaining fluid in the dynamic environment of the classroom\\". It is important to note that, \\"the reflective process should eventually help the teacher to change, adapt and modify his/her teaching to the particular context. This does not happen in stages, but is a continuum of reflection, leading to change ... and further reflection\\". Without reflection, teachers are not able to look objectively at their actions or take into account the emotions, experience, or consequences of actions to improve their practice. It is argued that, through the process of reflection, teachers are held accountable to the standards of practice for teaching, such as those in Ontario: commitment to students and student learning, professional knowledge, professional practice, leadership in learning communities, and ongoing professional learning. Overall, through reflective practice, teachers look back on their practice and reflect on how they have supported students by treating them \\"equitably and with respect and are sensitive to factors that influence individual student learning\\". ====Teacher educators==== For students to acquire necessary skills in reflection, their teachers need to be able to teach and model reflective practice (see above); similarly, teachers themselves need to have been taught reflective practice during their initial teacher education, and to continue to develop their reflective skills throughout their career. However, Mary Ryan has noted that students are often asked to \\"reflect\\" without being taught how to do so, or without being taught that different types of reflection are possible; they may not even receive a clear definition or rationale for reflective practice. Many new teachers do not know how to transfer the reflection strategies they learned in college to their classroom teaching. Some writers have advocated that reflective practice needs to be taught explicitly to student teachers because it is not an intuitive act; it is not enough for teacher educators to provide student teachers with \\"opportunities\\" to reflect: they must explicitly \\"teach reflection and types of reflection\\" and \\"need explicitly to facilitate the process of reflection and make transparent the metacognitive process it entails\\". Larrivee noted that (student) teachers require \\"carefully constructed guidance\\" and \\"multifaceted and strategically constructed interventions\\" if they are to reflect effectively on their practice. Rod Lane and colleagues listed strategies by which teacher educators can promote a habit of reflective practice in pre- service teacher education, such as discussions of a teaching situation, reflective interviews or essays about one's teaching experiences, action research, or journaling or blogging. Neville Hatton and David Smith, in a brief literature review, concluded that teacher education programs do use a wide range of strategies with the aim of encouraging students teachers to reflect (e.g. action research, case studies, video-recording or supervised practicum experiences), but that \\"there is little research evidence to show that this [aim] is actually being achieved\\". The implication of all this is that teacher educators must also be highly skilled in reflective practice. Andrea Gelfuso and Danielle Dennis, in a report on a formative experiment with student teachers, suggested that teaching how to reflect requires teacher educators to possess and deploy specific competences. However, Janet Dyment and Timothy O'Connell, in a small-scale study of experienced teacher educators, noted that the teacher educators they studied had received no training in using reflection themselves, and that they in turn did not give such training to their students; all parties were expected to know how to reflect. Many writers advocate for teacher educators themselves to act as models of reflective practice. This implies that the way that teacher educators teach their students needs to be congruent with the approaches they expect their students to adopt with pupils; teacher educators should not only model the way to teach, but should also explain why they have chosen a particular approach whilst doing so, by reference to theory; this implies that teacher educators need to be aware of their own tacit theories of teaching and able to connect them overtly to public theory. However, some teacher educators do not always \\"teach as they preach\\"; they base their teaching decisions on \\"common sense\\" more than on public theory and struggle with modelling reflective practice. Tom Russell, in a reflective article looking back on 35 years as teacher educator, concurred that teacher educators rarely model reflective practice, fail to link reflection clearly and directly to professional learning, and rarely explain what they mean by reflection, with the result that student teachers may complete their initial teacher education with \\"a muddled and negative view of what reflection is and how it might contribute to their professional learning\\". For Russell, these problems result from the fact that teacher educators have not sufficiently explored how theories of reflective practice relate to their own teaching, and so have not made the necessary \\"paradigmatic changes\\" which they expect their students to make. ==== Challenges ==== Reflective practice \\"is a term that carries diverse meaning\\" and about which there is not complete consensus. Professor Tim Fletcher of Brock University argues forward-thinking is a professional habit, but we must reflect on the past to inform how it translates into the present and future. Always thinking about 'what's next' rather than 'what just happened' can constrain an educator's reflective process. The concept of reflection is difficult as beginning teachers are stuck between \\"the conflicting values of schools and universities\\" and \\"the contradictory values at work within schools and within university faculties and with the increasing influence of factors external to school and universities such as policy makers\\". Conflicting opinions make it difficult to direct the reflection process, as it is hard to establish what values you are trying to align with. It is important to acknowledge reflective practice \\"follows a twisting path that involves false starts and detours\\". Meaning once you reflect on an issue it cannot be set aside as many assume. Newman refers to Gilroy's assertion that \\"the 'knowledge' produced by reflection can only be recognized by further reflection, which in turn requires reflection to recognize it as knowledge\\". In turn, reflective practice cannot hold one meaning, it is contextual based on the practitioner. It is argued that the term 'reflection' shouldn't be used as there are associations to it being \\"more of a hindrance than a help\\". It is suggested the term is referred to 'critical practice' or 'practical philosophy' to \\"suggest an approach which practitioners can adopt in the different social context in which they find themselves\\". Finally, Oluwatoyin discusses some disadvantages and barriers to reflective practice as, feeling stress by reflecting on negative issues and frustration from not being able to solve those identified issues, and time constraints. Finally, with reflection often taking place independently, educators lack the motivation and assistance in tackling these difficult problems. It is suggested that teachers communicate with one another, or have an indicated individual to talk to, this way there is external informed feedback. Overall, before engaging in reflective practice it is important to be aware of the challenges. ===Health professionals=== Reflective practice is viewed as an important strategy for health professionals who embrace lifelong learning. Due to the ever-changing context of healthcare and the continual growth of medical knowledge, there is a high level of demand on healthcare professionals' expertise. Due to this complex and continually changing environment, healthcare professionals could benefit from a program of reflective practice. Adrienne Price explained that there are several reasons why a healthcare practitioner would engage in reflective practice: to further understand one's motives, perceptions, attitudes, values, and feelings associated with client care; to provide a fresh outlook to practice situations and to challenge existing thoughts, feelings, and actions; and to explore how the practice situation may be approached differently. In the field of nursing there is concern that actions may run the risk of habitualisation, thus dehumanizing patients and their needs. In using reflective practice, nurses are able to plan their actions and consciously monitor the action to ensure it is beneficial to their patient. The act of reflection is seen as a way of promoting the development of autonomous, qualified and self-directed professionals, as well as a way of developing more effective healthcare teams. Engaging in reflective practice is associated with improved quality of care, stimulating personal and professional growth and closing the gap between theory and practice. Medical practitioners can combine reflective practice with checklists (when appropriate) to reduce diagnostic error. Activities to promote reflection are now being incorporated into undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing medical education across a variety of health professions. Professor of medical education Karen Mann and her colleagues found through a 2009 literature review that in practicing professionals the process of reflection appears to include a number of different aspects, and practicing professionals vary in their tendency and ability to reflect. They noted that the evidence to support curricular interventions and innovations promoting reflective practice remains largely theoretical. Samantha Davies identified benefits as well as limitations to reflective practice: Benefits to reflective practice include: * Increased learning from an experience or situation * Promotion of deep learning * Identification of personal and professional strengths and areas for improvement * Identification of educational needs * Acquisition of new knowledge and skills * Further understanding of own beliefs, attitudes and values * Encouragement of self-motivation and self-directed learning * Could act as a source of feedback * Possible improvements of personal and clinical confidence Limitations to reflective practice include: * Not all practitioners may understand the reflective process * May feel uncomfortable challenging and evaluating own practice * Could be time-consuming * May have confusion as to which situations/experiences to reflect upon * May not be adequate to resolve clinical problems ===Environmental management and sustainability=== The use of reflective practice in environmental management, combined with system monitoring, is often called adaptive management. There is some criticism that traditional environmental management, which simply focuses on the problem at hand, fails to integrate into the decision making the wider systems within which an environment is situated. While research and science must inform the process of environmental management, it is up to the practitioner to integrate those results within these wider systems. In order to deal with this and to reaffirm the utility of environmental management, Bryant and Wilson propose that a \\"more reflective approach is required that seeks to rethink the basic premises of environmental management as a process\\". This style of approach has been found to be successful in sustainable development projects where participants appreciated and enjoyed the educational aspect of utilizing reflective practice throughout. However, the authors noted the challenges with melding the \\"circularity\\" of reflective practice theory with the \\"doing\\" of sustainability. ===Leadership positions=== Reflective practice provides a development opportunity for those in leadership positions. Managing a team of people requires a delicate balance between people skills and technical expertise, and success in this type of role does not come easily. Reflective practice provides leaders with an opportunity to critically review what has been successful in the past and where improvement can be made. Reflective learning organizations have invested in coaching programs for their emerging and established leaders. Leaders frequently engage in self-limiting behaviours because of their over-reliance on their preferred ways of reacting and responding. Coaching can help support the establishment of new behaviours, as it encourages reflection, critical thinking and transformative learning. Adults have acquired a body of experience throughout their life, as well as habits of mind that define their world. Coaching programs support the process of questioning and potentially rebuilding these pre-determined habits of mind. The goal is for leaders to maximize their professional potential, and in order to do this, there must be a process of critical reflection on current assumptions. ===Other professions=== Reflective practice can help any individual to develop personally, and is useful for professions other than those discussed above. It allows professionals to continually update their skills and knowledge and consider new ways to interact with their colleagues. David Somerville and June Keeling suggested eight simple ways that professionals can practice more reflectively: # Seek feedback: Ask \\"Can you give me some feedback on what I did?\\" # Ask yourself \\"What have I learnt today?\\" and ask others \\"What have you learnt today?\\" # Value personal strengths: Identify positive accomplishments and areas for growth # View experiences objectively: Imagine the situation is on stage and you are in the audience # Empathize: Say out loud what you imagine the other person is experiencing # Keep a journal: Record your thoughts, feelings and future plans; look for emerging patterns # Plan for the future: Plan changes in behavior based on the patterns you identified # Create your own future: Combine the virtues of the dreamer, the realist, and the critic ==References* Category:Personal development Category:Education theory Category:Educational psychology Category:Vocational education Category:Learning theory (education) Category:Learning methods Category:Experiential learning Category:Nursing education ","title":"Reflective practice"},{"id":"2567192","text":"Moravian Church, Gracehill, September 2009 John Cennick plaque, Gracehill, September 2009 Gracehill is a village in County Antrim, Northern Ireland.

In the village there is a post office (now closed and located in the shop), shop, a sports and social club and two churches. Tregony has bus links to the nearest city, Truro. Cornelly parish was united with Tregony in 1934. Tregony was once a port, but clay mining upriver in St Austell has caused the river to become silted over.Kittridge, Alan (1989) Cornwall's Maritime Heritage.

Its earliest known spelling was Trefhrigoni, in 1049.Padel, O. J., Cornish Place-Names. There was 1 hide of land and land for 5 ploughs. There were 2 ploughs, 5 serfs, 3 villeins, 6 smallholders, 12 acres of woodland, 100 acres of pasture, 3 cattle, 40 sheep and 20 goats. The value of the manor was 15 shillings though it had formerly been worth 25 shillings.Thorn, C., et al., ed. (1979) Cornwall. Chichester: Phillimore; entry 5,24,21 Tregony used to be considered a town, and the rotten borough of Tregony elected two members to the Unreformed House of Commons, until the Reform Act 1832 abolished its representation as a rotten borough. At that time the parishes of Tregony and Cuby were united. The arms of the borough of Tregony were A pomegranate Or slipped and leaved Vert. Tregony was the birthplace of the Anglican churchman Archer Thompson Gurney. The Trewarthenick Estate in the hamlet of Trewarthenick in Cornelly parish, was the birthplace of William Gregor, a geologist-clergyman who discovered titanium. Captain William Hennah RN, who took part in the Battle of Trafalgar retired to Tregony and died there. ==Churches and schools== The Church of St James at Tregony was founded in the 11th century but in the early 16th century it was abandoned as it had been submerged by the tidal river. (This was caused by the building of Tregony Bridge ca. 1300 which led to the accumulation of alluvial deposits on the riverbed.) The church valuables were removed to Cuby Church sometime between 1530 and 1553: for many years thereafter the building was quarried for stone and no remains were to be seen by the early 20th century. The church had been founded by the Norman family of Pomeroy whose castle stood here: nearby there were also in mediaeval times a priory and a chapel of St Anne. There are no remains of any of these buildings either.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; pp. 206-207 Since the parish lost its church, the parishioners have used Cuby Church instead. The other active church in Tregony is one of the few remaining independent Congregational churches—those that did not become part of the United Reformed Church. The former Methodist Church still has a small wooden sign on it but is now a private home. It has a primary school in Back Lane. The area's secondary school, The Roseland Academy (built in 1962), is just over the Parish of Tregony boundary and has recently had a brand new sports hall. It has also achieved specialist school status in Music with English and IT. The almshouses were built in 1696 and rebuilt in 1895. ===Cornelly church=== Cornelly church The parish of Cornelly near Tregony has a church but no village: it is now grouped with Tregony and Cuby. Cornelly church is dedicated to St Cornelius and was built in the 13th century: the upper part of the tower, the south porch and the windows of the south wall are 15th century additions. The font is probably 16th century but of very crudely carved granite; the pulpit is painted with coats of arms; a monument to Jane Reeves, 1783, has an excellent portrait bust of her.Pevsner, N.

It was written by Ben Elton, Rik Mayall and Lise Mayer, and directed by Paul Jackson. It was first aired on BBC2 on 16 November 1982. == Plot == The guys settle into their new house after the destruction of their previous abode in the show's pilot episode and allocate the bedrooms. As Rick and Vyvyan argue over one bedroom, Mike discovers a man resembling Buddy Holly in his, having survived the plane crash on The Day the Music Died by parachuting out and smashing through the roof. He is still tangled in the parachute and hanging upside down from the ceiling, and he proceeds to sing Mike a song about the diet of insects on which he has subsisted since that day in 1959. Mike dreams of getting rich off the song, but his plan ends abruptly when the man falls loose and hits the floor, breaking his neck. Dragging the body into the cellar, Mike discovers two elderly men lying on their backs under a bare light bulb and hallucinating that they are adrift at sea. Rick and Vyvyan give the room they have been arguing over to Neil after Vyvyan sets its bed on fire, and Mike briefly converts Rick's room into a roller disco and charges him admission to enter. After a solo match of Murder in the Dark, Vyvyan announces that he has struck oil in the cellar, and instantly forms a coalition with Mike (whom Vyvyan calls \\"El Presidente\\") to extract and sell it. They decide to use Rick and Neil as slave labor, with Vyvyan enforcing discipline by beating the two with a cricket bat as they lie on the floor. After Neil inadvertently impales Vyvyan through the head with a pickaxe while digging for the oil, Rick tries to start a workers' revolution and organizes a benefit concert in the house. The effort fails, though, as the band (fronted by Alexei Sayle in his Balowski persona) demands a large fee and Rick has not bothered to sell any tickets. During the end credits, a disoriented but conscious Vyvyan stumbles around the cellar, swinging a pickaxe at random. He ends by addressing the camera, saying that he lied about finding oil. The episode featured a performance from electronic band Radical Posture, with Sayle as their singer, singing \\"Doctor Martens' Boots\\" == Characters == As with all episodes of The Young Ones, the main four characters were student flatmates Mike (Christopher Ryan); Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson); Rick (Rik Mayall) and Neil (Nigel Planer). Alexei Sayle appeared as Alexei Balowski, a protest singer and nephew of the students' landlord Jerzei. == Edited scene == When the episode was originally aired, an extended scene was shown at the basement oil well involving Vyvyan criticising Rick for not working hard enough, and then head butting the ground to speed up the digging (which then leads to Neil accidentally putting the pick axe through Vyvyan's head). In VHS and DVD releases, this scene has been edited to just show the pickaxe event and aftermath. The scene began with an obscure Roy 'C' song from 1973 called \\"I'm Bustin' My Rocks (Working On The Chain Gang)\\" (and not a Beatles song as originally specified) playing on Rick's radio, so the reason for its omission may be a failure by the BBC to secure broadcast rights for the music. A similar problem afflicted the re-release of \\"Cash\\" on DVD. == References == ==External links== * Category:The Young Ones episodes Category:1982 British television episodes Category:Cultural depictions of Buddy Holly Category:Television shows written by Ben Elton ","title":"Oil (The Young Ones)"},{"id":"2567213","text":"Live Recordings 2004 is the first EP by English alternative rock band Keane, first released in late spring 2005 (see 2005 in music).

It is the second oldest pub in Cambridge, after the Pickerell Inn. The street frontage, located on the north side of Bene't Street in the centre of the city,Bene't Street: The Eagle pub, Cambridge 2000 is of circa 1600, with a galleried 19th-century wing behind, facing the courtyard. The site is owned by Corpus Christi College and is managed by Greene King brewery. ==History== ===World War II=== The RAF Bar ceiling with graffiti of World War II airmen During the Second World War, Allied airmen, who drank and socialised at The Eagle, used wax candles, petrol lighters and lipstick to write their names, squadron numbers and other doodles onto the ceiling of the rear bar. The tradition is believed to have been started by RAF Flight Sergeant P. E. Turner, who climbed up on the table one night to burn his squadron number on the ceiling. The graffiti, in what is now known as the \\"RAF Bar\\", was uncovered, deciphered and preserved by former RAF Chief Technician James Chainey during the early 1990s. ===The Announcement of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA=== A blue plaque outside The Eagle When the university's Cavendish Laboratory was still at its old site at nearby Free School Lane, the pub was a popular lunch destination for staff working there. Thus, it became the place where Francis Crick interrupted patrons' lunchtime on 28 February 1953 to announce that he and James Watson had \\"discovered the secret of life\\" after they had come up with their proposal for the structure of DNA.Ed Regis, What Is Life?: Investigating the Nature of Life in the Age of Synthetic Biology, Oxford University Press, 2009, , p.52 The anecdote is related in Watson's book The Double Helix, and is commemorated on a blue plaque next to the entrance, and two plaques in the middle room by the table where Crick and Watson lunched regularly. Today the pub serves a special ale to commemorate the discovery, dubbed \\"Eagle's DNA\\". Also in 1953 Watson and Crick worked over lunch in the Eagle to draw up a list of the 20 canonical amino acids. This has been a very influential rubric for molecular biology, and was a key development in understanding the protein-coding nature of DNA. == References == Category:Pubs in Cambridge Category:History of Cambridge Category:Corpus Christi College, Cambridge Category:1667 establishments in England ","title":"The Eagle, Cambridge"},{"id":"2567241","text":"Mid-City is a neighborhood in Central Los Angeles, California. Attractions include restaurants and a post office named for singer Ray Charles, who had his recording studio in Mid-City. The neighborhood hosts eleven public and private schools. The Crenshaw/LAX Line from north-south is proposed to serve this area. ==Geography== ===City of Los Angeles boundaries=== The City of Los Angeles Department of Transportation has posted Mid-City signage to mark the area. City installed signs are at the following intersections (from east to west): Hoover Street and Washington Boulevard, Vermont Avenue and Pico Boulevard, Western Avenue and Pico Boulevard, Normandie Avenue and the Santa Monica Freeway, and La Brea Avenue and the Santa Monica Freeway. ===Google Maps=== Google Maps outlines an area labeled “Mid-City” that roughly runs from Hoover Street on the east to La Cienega Boulevard and Robertson Boulevard on the west. The north is roughly bordered by Olympic Boulevard, and the Santa Monica Freeway is on the south. ===Mapping L.A. boundaries=== The Mapping L.A. project of the Los Angeles Times states as follows: Mid-City is bounded on the north by Pico Boulevard, on the east by Crenshaw Boulevard, on the south by the Santa Monica Freeway, on the southwest by Washington and National boulevards, on the west by Robertson Boulevard and on the northwest by Cadillac Avenue and La Cienega Boulevard.The Thomas Guide, 2006, pp. 632-3 It is flanked by Carthay and Mid-Wilshire to the north, Arlington Heights to the east, Culver City and West Adams to the south, Palms to the southwest, Beverlywood to the west and Pico-Robertson to the northwest. Map of Mid-City as delineated by the Los Angeles Times ==Population== The Holmes-Shannon House in Victoria Park was built in 1911. Apartment building at San Vicente and Pico boulevards The 2000 U.S. census counted 52,197 residents in the 3.47-square- mile neighborhood—an average of 15,051 people per square mile, among the highest population densities in Los Angeles County. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 55,016. The median age for residents was 31, about average for both the city and the county. Mid-City was said to be \\"highly diverse\\" when compared to the city at large, with a diversity index of 0.637. The ethnic breakdown in 2000 was: Latinos, 45.2%; blacks, 38.3%; whites, 9.5%; Asians, 3.9%; and others, 3.1%. Mexico (46) and El Salvador (15.6%) were the most common places of birth for the 35.1% of the residents who were born abroad, a figure that was considered average for the city and county. The median household income in 2008 dollars was $43,711, considered average for the city. The percentage of households earning $20,000 or less was high, compared to the county at large. The average household size of 2.8 people was just about average for Los Angeles. Renters occupied 68.9% of the housing units, and home- or apartment owners the rest. The percentages of never-married men (43.2%) and never-married women (35%) were among the county's highest. The census found 2,748 families headed by single parents, the 23.4% rate being considered high for both the city and the county. ==Enclaves== Smaller neighborhoods within Mid-City include: *Reynier Village.

The Rimpau Loop in Mid-City was an important terminus of the Los Angeles Railway (\\"Yellow Cars\\") streetcars. The Pico Blvd. city streetcar line \\"P\\" turned around here in the Rimpau Loop.\\"LARY: Rimpau Look / PE: Vineyard Junction, 1938\\", PERYHS site From here, Santa Monica city buses ran to Downtown Santa Monica, and to this day, Pico and Rimpau is the terminus for several Santa Monica Transit lines. Vineyard Junction in Mid-City was where Pacific Electric \\"Red Car\\" lines converged. The lines ran from Downtown Los Angeles south to Venice Boulevard, then West along Venice to Vineyard Junction. From here they went along Venice Blvd. to Venice and Redondo Beach; while others went along San Vicente Blvd. northwest toward what is now West Hollywood as well as via Beverly Hills to Santa Monica. It was the site of an accident on July 13, 1913, in which two wooden streetcars crashed into each other, with 14 people dead and 200 people injured. As a result, the Pacific Electric ordered its future cars to be made of steel, and it was recommended that signaling be introduced on the PE's lines. ===Today=== As part of their long-range plans, the Los Angeles County MTA has proposed the Metro Crenshaw/LAX Line, which would place a rail transit station in Mid-City. The proposed rail stop is at the intersection of Pico and San Vicente Boulevards—site of the old Vineyard Junction. The old Vineyard Junction site is now occupied by the end terminal for the Santa Monica Big Blue Bus. The Crenshaw Light Rail Line would allow Mid-City residents to easy access to the city's east/west rail lines: the D Line along Wilshire Boulevard, the E Line from Downtown Los Angeles to Downtown Santa Monica, and the C Line from Norwalk to Redondo Beach and soon near LAX.

It was written by Ben Elton, Rik Mayall, and Lise Mayer, and directed by Paul Jackson. It was first aired on BBC2 on 23 November 1982. This episode is rarely repeated on television because of its racial content, including two uses of \\"coon\\", one use of \\"sambo\\", and one use of \\"nigger\\". All three words are spoken in a scene by a Caucasian policeman in sunglasses unaware that his interlocutor is white until he removes them, satirising the severe racial issues that affected the police at this time. When it is shown on television, it is edited to remove these references. ==Plot== The quartet are bored to exasperation, despite the fact that there are roller skating vegetables in the kitchen sink. Several other remarkable and unlikely phenomena occur around them throughout the episode, entirely unnoticed by the characters, as they attempt to find something to relieve their boredom. The song \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" by the Beatles is playing as dawn comes up. Even a televised siege that spills into their living room goes unnoticed. A visit to the local pub, where Vyvyan meets his long-lost mother, and Rik and Neil both reveal that they don't drink, fails to provide entertainment. Madness make an appearance at the pub, renamed the Kebab and Calculator, and perform their current hit at that time, \\"House of Fun\\". At one point Neil suggests they go to lectures, but the idea is met with incredulity by his housemates. The exterior shots of the pub scene were filmed at the Westbury Park Tavern in Henleaze, Bristol. In reference to The Story of the Three Bears, Goldilocks rejects the lentils that Neil has prepared (she dismisses it as \\"bloody hippie food\\"), and the Three Bears also reject the lentils and opt to \\"go to McDonald's\\" instead. As they drift off to sleep for another night, a spaceship lands on their roof, with Neil still obliviously sitting on his windowsill. ==Characters== As with all episodes of The Young Ones, the main four characters are student flatmates Mike (Christopher Ryan), Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), Rick (Rik Mayall), and Neil (Nigel Planer). Alexei Sayle stars as Billy Balowski, an eccentric taxi driver and brother of the students' landlord Jerzei. Mark Arden and Stephen Frost play a pair of rather stupid policemen who deliver a series of gags separately from the other characters. They are then revealed to be the subject of an article on the front of The Guardian with the headline \\"Police I.Q. Shocker\\". Also in this episode is David Rappaport, playing Ftumch the devil. This is one of his two appearances in The Young Ones, the other being as a different character in Flood. The episode also features a performance of House of Fun by ska band Madness. In addition, lead singer Suggs has a line of dialogue in the episode. When Rick asks if the band knows \\"Summer Holiday\\" by Cliff Richard, Suggs replies, \\"You hum it, I'll smash your face in!\\" Actress and writer Pauline Melville appears as Vyvyan's mother. ===Ftumch=== A devil, played by David Rappaport. The premise is that if anyone utters his name three times, he shall appear to claim a soul. He doesn't get called to Earth very often because 'Ftumch' is such an unusual name: 'No-one ever says Ftumch. Why couldn't I be called William?' Ftumch is accidentally summoned to Earth by Rik reading a gibberish typo aloud from The Guardian twice, and Neil asking \\"What's a Ftumch?\\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:The Young Ones episodes Category:1982 British television episodes Category:Fictional demons and devils Category:Madness (band) Category:Television shows written by Ben Elton ","title":"Boring (The Young Ones)"},{"id":"2567267","text":"Semper may refer to: ==Mottos== * Semper supra (Latin: Always above), the official motto of the United States Space Force * Semper fidelis (Latin: Always faithful), a motto used by, among others, the United States Marine Corps * Semper fortis (Latin: Always Courageous), an unofficial motto of the United States Navy * Semper Gumby (Dog Latin: Always flexible), an unofficial motto of the USCG, USMC, USPHS, CAP, Emergency Management and more * Semper paratus (Latin: Always ready), the United States Coast Guard motto * Semper primus (always first), a latin phrase used as a motto by several United States and Israeli military units * Semper vigilans (always vigilant), a latin phrase used as a motto by the Civil Air Patrol, several military units, and the city of San Diego, California, U.S. * Semper vigilo (Latin: Always vigilant or Always alert), motto of Police Scotland * Sic semper tyrannis (Latin: Thus always to tyrants), motto of Virginia * Quas dederis solas semper habebis opes (Latin: \\"What thou hast given alone shall be eternal riches unto thee\\"), motto of Queen Mary's Grammar School, England == People == * Carl Semper (1832–1893), German ethnologist and animal ecologist * Colin Semper (born 1938), Anglican priest * Georg Semper (1837–1909), German entomologist * Gottfried Semper (1803–1879), German architect, art critic, and professor of architecture * Johannes Semper (1892–1970), Estonian writer and translator * John Semper, American screenwriter, producer and story editor * Manfred Semper, German architect of the second Dresden Opera House and son of Gottfried Semper * Natalya Yevgenevna Semper (1911–1995), Soviet memoirist and Egyptologist * Trevor Semper (born 1970), Montserratian cricketer ==Other uses== * Semper (food brand), Swedish brand of infant food, a member of Hero Group * \\"Semper I\\", 2011 episode of the psychological thriller TV series Homeland * Semperoper, an opera house in Dresden, Germany ==See also== * Ea Semper, 1907 apostolic letter written by Pope Pius X * Semper fi (disambiguation) * Semper fidelis (disambiguation) ","title":"Semper"},{"id":"2567275","text":"Newton or Newton-in-Bowland is a village and civil parish in the Ribble Valley district, in the county of Lancashire, England, formerly known as Newton-on- Hodder.

Historically, the village is part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, but was transferred to Lancashire for administrative purposes on 1 April 1974, under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972. The village pub – The Parkers Arms – takes its name from the neighbouring Parker family of Browsholme Hall.

It serves modern British food and local ales and is renowned for sourcing much of its food from within the Bowland area.http://www.parkersarms.co.uk ==History== Recorded in Domesday as Neutone and part of the ancient parish of Slaidburn since Saxon times,Jenny Bradley, Slaidburn: A Walk through the Village (Slaidburn Village Archive 2011), p. 6 Newton has been a constituent part of the demesne of the Manor of Slaidburn since the second half of the fourteenth century.Slaidburn Court Rolls, 16th year of reign of Richard II, 1392/3, No 1: 8 membranes, 1 wrapper, Lancashire Record Office, DDHC1; William Farrer, Latin transcription (1900), Manchester City Archive A fall in the population resulting from the Black Death (1348–50) as well as the absorption of Bowland into the Duchy of Lancaster had led to wholesale manorial reorganisation during the 1360s. As a result, the Domesday manors of West Bradford and Grindleton - being part of the parish of Mitton - were also annexed into a new Liberty of Slaidburn, with the caput moving from Grindleton to Slaidburn. From the late eleventh century, the Manor of Slaidburn had formed part of the ancient Lordship of Bowland. That Lordship in turn comprised a Royal Forest and a Liberty of ten mesne manors spanning eight townships within four ancient parishes and covered an area of almost on the historic borders of Lancashire and Yorkshire. The manors within the Liberty of Bowland were Slaidburn (including Newton, West Bradford and Grindleton), Knowlmere, Waddington, Easington, Bashall, Mitton, Withgill (Crook), Leagram, Hammerton and Dunnow (Battersby). Two of the mesne manors of the Lords of Bowland remained within the bounds of the township of Newton after the fourteenth century but did not fall within the demesne of Slaidburn: Battersby was held by the eponymous Battersby family until the late sixteenth century. It was acquired and renamed Dunnow by a branch of the Shireburnes of Stonyhurst who held the manor until the time of the English Civil Wars. Much land being sold during this period, the Slinger family acquired the remnant which they held until 1728. Thereafter, the manor passed to Robert Parker, a relative of the Slingers, who sold it to the Wilkinsons in the early 1800s. The current Dunnow Hall dates from the nineteenth century. The last so-called Squire of Dunnow, John King- Wilkinson, died in May 2011. Knowlmere was a mesne manor of the Lords of Bowland originally subinfeudated to the Savile family but held by the Hammertons from 1382. From at least the mid-thirteenth century, some thirty acres, the core of the estate, had been tenanted by the De Knoll family from which the manor takes its name. The Hammertons suffered severe penalties for Sir Stephen Hammerton's involvement in the Pilgrimage of Grace and their lands, including Knowlmere, were confiscated in 1537.RW Hoyle, The Pilgrimage of Grace and the Politics of the 1530s(Oxford University Press 2001) By this time, the manor of Knowlmere comprised \\"some eighteen farms and lesser holdings which included Birkett, Foulscales, Thorneyholme, Mossthwaite and other properties on the south side of the Hodder between Newton and Dunsop Bridge\\".J Porter, The Forest of Bowland: Its Landscape and History (Farnborough 1994), p. 37 A portion of the original Knoll family holding, close to Burholme, appears to have been retained by the family until 1503 when it came into the possession of the Earls of Derby.Alice Peel, The Manor of Knowlmere (Privately published: Knowlmere 1913) There has been some speculation that the mysterious Bogeuurde in Domesday - identified by Ekwall with Barge Ford, near Foulscales - may in fact be the manor of Knowlmere in its earliest manifestation.Eilert Ekwall, The Place-names of Lancashire (Manchester University Press: Manchester 1922) Title to the Manor and Liberty of Slaidburn, West Bradford and Grindleton, including the township of Newton, was bought by Tory MP, Ralph Assheton, later first Baron Clitheroe, in 1950.HM Land Registry, 22 June 1950 In 1977, his second son, the Hon Nicholas Assheton, was granted title.HM Land Registry, 26 August 1977 Since 2003, the Lord of the Manor and Liberty of Slaidburn has been Thomas Assheton, son of the Hon Nicholas Assheton and nephew of the second Baron Clitheroe.HM Land Registry, LA937696, 1 June 2003; ownership of common land is registered under LA955806, LA955807, LA955808, LA955809 Newton was an early centre of Nonconformist religion. Richard Leigh of Birkett, the founder of Newton's first independent chapel in 1696, was closely associated with the great Congregationalist preacher Thomas Jollie.Henry Fishwick, ed., The Notebook of the Rev Thomas Jollie, AD 1671-1693 (Chetham Society: Manchester 1894)William Bowland, The Lord and the Preacher http://www.forestofbowland.com/files/uploads/THE_LORD_AND_THE_PREACHER%20minus%20picture%20Nov%202010.pdf Thomas Jollie's grandson, also Thomas, married Leigh's daughter while his nephew, John Jollie, served as Newton's first Congregationalist minister from 1696-1702. The original chapel was replaced in 1887 and was finally closed to services in June 2012.Final Service at 125-year-old Chapel,Clitheroe Advertiser,17 June 2012 Newton also boasts an historic Quaker burial ground.Brian Dale, Bicentenary of Nonconformity in the Village of Newton in Bowland (William Byles: Bradford 1897) ==Geography== The Roman road known as Watling Street, that runs from Manchester via Ribchester to Carlisle, passes in a NNE direction to the west of the village. The River Hodder flows through Newton, joined by Easington Brook on the eastern edge of the village, and Foulscales Brook a little further south. The confluence of Foulscales Brook and the Hodder is the location of Barge Ford, considered to be the mysterious Bogeuurde mentioned in Domesday and by some, linked to the early origins of the manor of Knowlmere. Close by sits Foulscales Farm, a fourteenth-century hall, the oldest dwelling in Bowland, tenanted by the Eastwood family, descendants of Richard Eastwood (d. 1871), Bowbearer of the Forest of Bowland and founder of St Hubert's Catholic Chapel, Dunsop Bridge. ==Governance== The civil parish of Newton was created from the township of the same name in 1866. In 1938, the geographically non-contiguous division of Lower Easington was transferred to Newton. Along with Bowland Forest Low, Slaidburn, Bolton-by- Bowland, and Easington, the parish forms the Bowland, Newton and Slaidburn ward of Ribble Valley Borough Council. ==Media gallery== File:Newton Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 426403.jpgNewton Bridge File:Footbridge over the River Hodder - geograph.org.uk - 701515.jpgFootbridge over River Hodder File:Newton in Bowland URC - geograph.org.uk - 74707.jpgNewton Chapel File:Dunnow Hall,Near Slaidburn - geograph.org.uk - 996483.jpgDunnow Hall File:Parkers Arms, Newton in Bowland - geograph.org.uk - 426390.jpgThe Parkers Arms File:Entrance to Newton Quaker Burial Ground - geograph.org.uk - 426370.jpgQuaker Burial Ground ==See also== *Listed buildings in Newton, Ribble Valley ==References== ==External links== *Map of current Newton parish boundary at Lancashire County Council website *forestofbowland.com *Newton Conservation Area Apprasial Category:Villages in Lancashire Category:Civil parishes in Lancashire Category:Geography of Ribble Valley Category:Forest of Bowland ","title":"Newton-in-Bowland"},{"id":"2567278","text":"Kolasib is a district as well as a district headquarters of Kolasib district in Mizoram, India. ==Demographics== India census, Kolasib district had a population of 83,955.

CERA has research and consulting staff across the globe and covers the oil, gas, power, and coal markets worldwide. The company was founded in 1983 by Pulitzer Prize winning author Daniel Yergin, James Rosenfield and Joseph Stanislaw. Comprising experts from many fields within the energy industry, CERA was acquired by IHS Energy in 2004. In 2009 it modified its name to IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates or IHS CERA as part of the IHS brand integration in which name changes also took place for other endorsed brands under IHS, including IHS Jane's, IHS Global Insight, IHS EViews, and IHS Herold. ==CERAWeek== Some of the company's largest clients include international energy companies, energy consumers, governments, utilities, technology companies, and financial institutions. Many of them attend \\"CERAWeek\\", the company's annual conference held at the Hilton Americas Hotel in Houston, Texas. Daily programs usually revolve around the topics of oil, natural gas, electric power, renewables, and technology. Past keynote speeches have been given by the energy secretaries and ministers of Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Mexico, Norway, and the United States. Other notable speakers have included former United States Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin, United States Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman, former Colorado Senator Gary Hart; former United States Secretary of Commerce Donald L. Evans; former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, and former Secretary General of OPEC Rilwanu Lukman. CERA also manages the Upstream Capital Costs Index. ==Peak oil== As the controversy over peak oil intensified in 2006, CERA found itself on the optimistic side of predictions, forecasting that a peak would not occur before 2030, and this would not be a \\"peak\\" but rather an \\"undulating plateau\\". This opinion has been met with criticism by those who believe a peak has already occurred or is imminent. ASPO-USA described CERA's position as having a credibility problem. Chris Skrebowski considered the CERA report to be a polemic that confused stocks and flows. In June 2008, Daniel Yergin said that markets have helped fuel a \\"shortage psychology\\" that the world is \\"running out of oil\\". He also described $120–$150 per barrel as the \\"break point\\" for oil, the point where demand erosion would affect the price rise. CERA researchers have predicted in September 2009 that peak demand has come and gone in the OECD world, likely sometime in 2005. This is not, however, in agreement with peak oil, which is more on the extraction and production side. CERA continues to believe that there is plenty of oil under ground. In predicting peak demand in developed countries, CERA states that long-term demand is softening as a result of demographic and socioeconomic changes in developed countries (such as the aging of OECD populations), improved transportation efficiency, and encroachment by substitutes such as biofuels and natural gas. ==Leadership== * Daniel Yergin, Chairman * James Rosenfield, Co-Founder == References == ==External links== * Cambridge Energy Research Associates home page * CERAWeek: CERA's Annual Executive Conference * CERA News, Events and Reports * Reflections on historical accuracy of CERA predictions Category:Think tanks established in 1983 Category:1983 establishments in the United States Category:Think tanks based in the United States Category:Peak oil Category:Energy research ","title":"Cambridge Energy Research Associates"},{"id":"2567287","text":"Karin Slaughter (born January 6, 1971) is an American crime writer.

It was established in 1983 in Vijayawada with the principle of child-centered education by a group of academic intellectuals forming Vikasa educational trust. It later moved to the current location in Poranki, and attained ICSE board affiliation in 2000. The school has student strength around 375, predominantly coming from the region of Vijayawada and its suburbs. == Philosophy == After the deterioration of public school system from inadequate funding, the school system in Andhra Pradesh at present is dominated by the private schools. The common characters of these schools are, English being the medium of instruction, emphasis only on academic excellence, and often allowing corporal punishment to discipline the children. The philosophy of Vikasa vidya vanam is inspired from people like Jiddu Krishnamurti and Gijubhai Badheka and says that a school is the place for wholesome development of the child and it is best achieved in a pressure-free environment. Medium of education at the primary level (Up to grade V) is the children's mother tongue (Telugu). The children are introduced early to English as a language, transitioning later in to the medium of instruction. Punishment in any form is non-existent here. Grades VI to XII are conducted in a fully residential campus under the name Living Vikasa Vidya Vanam in Akkineni Sudarshana Puram, Agiripalli, about 22 km from the city of Vijayawada. == Vikasa Vidya Vanam - A Primary Dayschool @ Poranki == Vikasa Vidya Vanam Day School for children of ages 3 to 11 years (Kindergarten to 6th class) has been striving to provide a child-centered learning environment in current location at Poranki, Vijayawada. Salient features of the Primary School Program are: * Medium of Instruction - Telugu * No homework == Living Vikasa Vidya Vanam - A Residential School @ Adavinekkalam == The Living Vikasa Vidya Vanam is a residential school for children of ages 11 to 16 years (classes 6th to 10th) at Akkineni Sudarsana Puram, about 24km away from Vijayawada. It provides an environment of community living for the holistic development of the young adolescent. Vikasa Vidya Vanam is affiliated to The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), New Delhi for the certifications after Class X (ICSE) and Class XII (ISC). == Vikasa Educational Trust == Vikasa Educational Trust is a non-profit organization established in December 1982 under the Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860. The founding governing body consisted of 7 educators sharing similar concerns about the abuses endured by children because of unhealthy educational practices. The members of the first Governing body were Anne Radhakrishnamurti (president), T.Venugopalarao (vice-president), S.R.Parimi (secretary), Y.Venkateswararao, B.V.Apparao, Y. Ramakrishnayya and E.Venkateswararao Over the last 27 years, many enthusiastic college graduates joined the Trust as members and contributed towards furthering the Trust's objectives. The present strength of the General Body is 23. The General Body, as per the bylaws, elects the new Governing Body every 3 years. The present Governing Body members are D. Sambasivarao (President), A. Jagannatha Rao (vice-president), S.R. Parimi (secretary), Dr. K. Jayapradadevi (treasurer), R. Santhi, Hema Parimi, and G. Jayshree.

Even though the attempt was unsuccessful, it was a notable event in the course of the Cold War because it drew international attention to human rights violations in the Soviet Union and resulted in the temporary loosening of emigration restrictions. == Background == In the wake of the 1967 Six-Day War, the Soviet Union broke off diplomatic relations with Israel. To apply for an exit visa, the applicants (and often their entire families) would have to quit their jobs, which in turn would make them vulnerable to charges of social parasitism, a criminal offense. A large number of Soviet Jews applied for exit visas to leave the Soviet Union. While some were allowed to leave, many were refused permission to emigrate, either immediately or after their cases would languish for years in the OVIR (ОВиР, \\"Отдел Виз и Регистрации\\", \\"Otdel Viz i Registratsii\\", English: Office of Visas and Registration), the MVD (Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs) department responsible for exit visas. In many instances, the reason given for denial was that these persons had been given access, at some point in their careers, to information vital to Soviet national security and could not be allowed to leave.The Right to Emigrate, cont. Beyond the Pale. The History of Jews in Russia. Exhibit by Friends and Partners == Incident == In 1970, a group of sixteen Refuseniks (two of whom were non-Jewish), organized by dissident Edward Kuznetsov (who already had served a seven-year term in Soviet prison for publishing an anti Soviet newspaper called \\"Phoenix\\"), plotted to buy all the seats on a small 12-seater Antonov An-2 (colloquially known as \\"кукурузник,\\" kukuruznik) on a Leningrad- Priozersk local flight, under the guise of a trip to a wedding; throw out the pilots before takeoff from an intermediate stop; and fly it to Sweden.Beckerman, Gal (2010). When They Come for Us, We'll Be Gone: The Epic Struggle to Save Soviet Jewry. Boston/New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. p. 179, 191, 194–195. Their final goal was to arrive in Israel. One of the participants, Mark Dymshits, was a former military pilot, who had experience flying the An-2s.Beckerman (2010), p. 177-178. The group called the plan \\"Operation Wedding\\".Beckerman (2010), p. 186. After the plan had evolved over a period of months, it was finally launched in June 1970. On the morning of 15 June the group arrived together in Smolny (later Rzhevka) Airport near Leningrad, only to be arrested by the KGB.Beckerman (2010), p. 196-199. == Aftermath == The accused were charged for high treason, punishable by death under Article 64 of the Penal code of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). In a trial that took place from 15 to 24 December 1970, Mark Dymshits (age: 43) and Eduard Kuznetsov (age: 30) received a death sentence.Mozorov, Boris (Ed.) (1999). Documents on Soviet Jewish Emigration. London; Portland, OR: Frank Cass. p. 90, note 3. The prison sentences received by nine other participants were as follows: Sylva Zalmanson (age: 25; then Kuznetsov's wife, and the only woman on trial), 10 years; Yosef Mendelevitch (age: 23) and Yuri Fedorov, 15 years; Aleksey Murzhenko (age: 27 or 28), 14 years; Arie (Leib) Hanoch (age: 25), 13 years; Anatoli Altmann (age: 28), 12 years; Boris Penson (age: 23), 10 years; Israel Zalmanson (age: 21), 8 years; and Mendel Bodnya (age: 32), 4 years.\\"Proceedings of the Leningrad Hijacking Trial.\\" In: Eduard Kuznetsov (1975). Prison Diaries. Translated from the Russian by Howard Spier. New York: Stein and Day. pp. 217–254. The account is described as having been \\"recorded by a relative of one of the accused who was present in the courtroom\\" (p. 217); ages or years of birth, as well as other biographical details, are included for most of the defendants. Wolf Zalmanson (age: 31), brother of Sylva and Israel Zalmanson, who was a lieutenant in the Soviet army, was tried separately by a military tribunal and, on 2 January 1971, sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.\\"Zalmanson Sentenced to 10 Years; Termination of Trial of Nine Seen As Ploy\\" (8 January 1971). Jewish Telegraphic Agency. Retrieved 22 November 2015. After international protests the Judicial Commission for Criminal Cases of the RSFSR Supreme Court in Moscow considered an appeal of the cases, and modified the sentences, commuting the capital sentences of Dymshits and Kuznetsov to 15 years in prison, and reducing the length of prison terms for several other defendants by two to five years. Strong international condemnations caused the Soviet authorities to significantly increase the emigration quota. In the years 1960 through 1970, only 4,000 people had (legally) emigrated from the USSR; after the trial, in the period from 1971 to 1980, 347,100 people received a visa to leave the USSR, of whom 245,951 were Jews. Jewish emigration from USSR, before and after the First Leningrad Trial In August 1974, Sylva Zalmanson was released as part of an Israeli secret Soviet prisoner exchange with the spy Yuri Linov that took place in Berlin, after which she immigrated to Israel, arriving in September. In the following years she advocated for the release of her husband, Edward Kuznetsov, and other dissidents.\\"Woman Keeping Vigil at U.N. Collapses After Plea Fails\\" (9 October 1975). The New York Times.Ghert- Zand, Renee (29 December 2012). \\"My mom and dad, the would-be Zionist plane hijackers.\\" The Times of Israel. Retrieved 23 November 2015. Kuznetsov was finally released on 27 April 1979, and joined his wife in Israel.Kuznetsov, Eduard S. (27 April 1980). \\"Flight from the Gulag.\\" The New York Times. Mark Dymshits was released at the same time, along with three other prominent Soviet dissidents, Aleksandr Ginzburg, Valentin Moroz, and Georgy Vins. The release of the five dissidents came after long negotiations as part of a prisoner exchange for two Soviet foreign intelligence officers, Rudolf Chernyaev and Valdik Enger. The Soviet operatives, who were employed at the time at the United Nations Secretariat, had been sentenced in US federal court to 50 years in prison, in October 1978, following their arrest in New Jersey the previous May, while collecting an agent's report from a secret cache (a co-conspirator, Vladimir Zinyakin, an attaché of the Soviet mission to the UN, had diplomatic immunity, and was not charged). After immigrating to Israel, Kuznetsov headed the news department of \\"Radio Liberty\\" (1983–1990), and was the chief editor of the largest Israeli Russian-language newspaper, Вести (1990–1999), the most popular Russian-language newspaper outside of Russia. \\"The Committee to Free the Leningrad Three,\\" headed by Colorado State Senator Tilman Bishop, was instrumental in organizing grassroots and diplomatic campaigns to release the remaining prisoners. In February 1981, Mendelevitch was released and joined his family in Israel. He urged continuance of the campaign to free two members of the group, Fedorov and Murzhenko: \\"The fact that both are non-Jewish is the worst example of Soviet discrimination and must not pass without protest.\\" On 15 June 1984, Aleksei Murzhenko was released, only to be rearrested for \\"parole violation.\\" In June 1985, after serving 15 years, Yuri Fedorov was released under the 101st kilometre settlement restriction. He was denied an exit visa until 1988, when he left for the USA. In 1998, he founded The Gratitude Fund in order to commemorate the Soviet dissidents \\"who waged a war against Soviet power and sacrificed their personal freedom and their lives for democracy.\\" In 2016, Operation Wedding, a documentary about the hijacking directed by Anat Zalmanson- Kuznetsov (the daughter of Kuznetsov and Sylva Zalmanson, two participants in the plot) was released.http://www.operation-wedding-documentary.com/ == See also == * Eastern Bloc emigration and defection * Jackson–Vanik amendment == Notes == * ИНАКОМЫСЛИЯ В СССР (The History of Dissident Movement in the USSR) by Ludmila Alekseyeva.

It has a population of 2,802. The parish includes the hamlets of Milborne Wick and Kingsbury Regis. The village is surrounded by green fields and countryside on the banks of the River Gascoigne, a tributary of the River Ivel or River Yeo. The village has a primary school, which occupies the site of the former infant school. The junior school was closed and all pupils and staff moved to the infant site. In 2006 a new three-classroom extension was opened. ==History== The nearby Laycock Railway Cutting is the best single exposure of the Bathonian ’Fuller's Earth Rock' in South Somerset. Ammonites indicating the Morrisi and Subcontractus zones of the Middle Bathonian are frequent.English Nature citation sheet for Laycock Railway Cutting (accessed 10 August 2006) Miller's Hill is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest which is an important and historically famous locality for studies of Middle Jurassic (Bajocian) stratigraphy and palaeontology.English Nature citation sheet for Miller's Hill, Milborne Wick (accessed 10 August 2006) Prehistoric features and finds have been located on the Iron Age hill fort on Barrow Hill, in the north of the parish. In the Saxon period Milborne Port was important as a mint town, between 997 and 1035. It is one of at least nineteen mint towns which were neither an Alfredian borough nor an eleventh-century shire town, but a minster site. The market was the most profitable in Somerset in 1086,and the town was eighth in the county tax collection in 1340. The \\"port\\" in the towns name signifies an important market town and was first recorded in 1249. The parish was part of the hundred of Horethorne. In 1770, Milborne Port was the site of events involving an exploding squib at the local fair that would result in a landmark case for the development of modern tort (personal injury) law. The case of Scott v. Shepherd2 Blackstone's Reports 892, 96 Eng. Rep. 525 (1773) helped establish the principles of remoteness, foreseeability, and intervening cause in modern common law torts. Shepherd tossed a lit squib into a crowded market in the town, where it landed on the table of a gingerbread merchant named Yates. Willis, a bystander, grabbed the squib and threw it across the market to protect himself and the gingerbread. Unfortunately, the squib landed in the goods of another merchant named Ryal. Ryal immediately grabbed the squib and tossed it away, accidentally hitting Scott in the face just as the squib exploded. The explosion put out one of Scott's eyes. Shepherd was found to be fully liable, because, said De Gray CJ, \\"I do not consider [the intermediaries] as free agents in the present case, but acting under a compulsive necessity for their own safety and self-preservation.\\"96 Eng. Rep. 525 (K.B. 1773) In 1805, the town was described as follows: * \\"MILBORN PORT, (Som.) bor. dist. from London 113 m. 7 f. [furlongs] situated on a branch of the river Parret, and may be considered as divided into three parts, viz. Milborn Port, Kingsbury Regis, and Milborn Wyke; however, the borough and Kingsbury lie in many places promiscuously intermixed together, both in the main town, and at Milborn Wyke; Milborn Wyke being as a village 1 m. N.... In Kingsbury is an annual court-baron held, wherein lord's rents are paid, presentments are made, and a constable, tythingman, and hayward, are appointed, for the year ensuing... Number of actual voters, 9, nominally 114. The church has a square tower, 6 bells, a clock, and chimes; one dissenting meeting-house, and upwards of 1000 inhabitants. The manufactures are dowlas, tick, white baize, linsey, stockings, and shoes. No market, but is supposed to have had one formerly. Fairs, 5 June, and 23 Oct., for cattle and toys. The post is despatched to Sherborne every day at 1 o'clock, and one arrives from thence at the same hour. Near it, on the left, is the seat of William Coles Medlecot, esq.\\"Oulton, W. C. (1805) The Traveller's Guide; or, English Itinerary, Vol II, pp 272-273. Ivy-Lane, London: James Cundee. Under the Reform Act 1832, the town lost its status as a Parliamentary constituency, due to the gerrymandering activities of both parties in preceding elections. In April 1873 a local Shepherd, William Osmond was victimised and sent to jail with six months hard labour for organising agricultural labourers in the area (inspired by George Mitchell, Somerset leader of the National Agricultural Labourers Union). On his release in January 1874 over 2,000 supporters marched through Milborne Port in his support. The farmer Charles Bugg, who victimised Osmond, died it is said of \\"shame\\" in January 1874 (Source: One from the Plough — George Mitchell) The village was a thriving leather and leather glove manufacturing area. In 1826, The Earl of Ilchester presented a petition to Parliament for them, against the importation of leather. The last factory closed in 1970. Ven House with its orangery, entrance gateway, pavilions, terrace, stabling & other outbuildings was built in 1730 by Richard Grange and Decimus Burton. It is a grade I listed building. ==Governance== The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non- metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Wincanton Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Somerton and Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. ==Church== The cruciform church of Church of St John the Evangelist is of late Anglo-Saxon date and parts may well span the Norman conquest. The chancellor Regimbald (a survivor from Edward's reign into William's) rebuilt his Minster at Milborne Port in \\"a sumptuous hybrid style\\". It would seem logical to assign the now- demolished nave to this period, since the surviving south doorway of the nave was incorporated into the 1860s rebuild and is perhaps of Saxo-Norman design. However, despite the Victorian nave (almost totally rebuilt 1867–69) and accompanying north aisle, there remains the pre-conquest central tower, part transepts and chancel. The south transept was heavily restored in 1843. The north transept was rebuilt along with the nave, so compared to pre-1867 almost half of the Anglo-Saxon church has now gone. The new nave is longer than the original it replaced. The old west front exhibited vestiges of triangular- headed arcading on either side of the inserted Perpendicular west window, and the lower part of the front was divided into compartments, by broad pilasters of plain square section. This was recorded by photography and the photo was published in 1893 by A. Reynolds, who was involved with building the new nave. The crossing (tower) is wider in plan than the nave, and markedly wider than the transepts or chancel. This is a distinctive Saxon trait, which may also be observed at nearby Sherborne Abbey (where significant traces of the Saxon rubble west wall may be seen, and which include a Saxon doorway in the north aisle). Inside, the four crossing arches with their jambs survive, although the east and west arches have been rebuilt in pointed 14th-century form; the south and north arches have been slightly deformed to elliptical shape due to the pressure of the masonry, perhaps by the addition of the top stage of the tower in Norman times. The chancel exhibits pilaster strip work, much disturbed and cut by Early English period windows, and has a close parallel at Bradford-on-Avon. The wall thickness of the chancel is , which is a typical Anglo-Saxon dimension. The church, with its Anglo-Saxon features, is of major importance to our understanding of the larger minsters in pre-conquest England. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. A mission church of 1891 serves Milborne Wick.https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/som/vol7/pp138-156 ==See also== *Regis (Place) *List of place names with royal patronage in the United Kingdom ==References== ==External links== *Milborne Port commercial website *Milborne Port community website *Milborne Port Opera *Vallins, John. \\"Rolling down the river\\", The Guardian, 5 July 2005 Category:Villages in South Somerset Category:Civil parishes in Somerset ","title":"Milborne Port"},{"id":"2567321","text":"Orford is a village with historic town status in Suffolk, England, within the Suffolk Coast and Heaths AONB. Like many Suffolk coastal towns it was of some importance as a port and fishing village in the Middle Ages. It still has a fine mediaeval castle, built to dominate the River Ore and a Grade I listed parish church, St Bartholomew's. The main geographical feature of the area is Orford Ness, a long, wide shingle spit at the mouth of the Ore. From 1913 to 1983, Orford Ness was used by the Ministry of Defence and other government bodies for various military developments and tests, and in the early 1970s it was the site of a powerful radar station as part of the Cold War defences against low-flying attacking aircraft. Today it is a nature reserve, owned and run by the National Trust. A prominent feature of Orford Ness is its lighthouse, which, as at 2020, is under severe threat from coastal erosion. Orford provides the only point of access to the nature reserves of Orford Ness and Havergate Island. Both sites can only be accessed via ferry boat from Orford quay. The Orford Ness ferry runs on selected days between April and October and the Havergate Island ferry on selected Saturdays. The population of Orford greatly increases during the summer months, partly due to its flourishing sailing club. In common with other Suffolk coastal towns and villages, a substantial number of properties in Orford are holiday or second homes.

Castle Greyhawk is also the name of a 1988 Dungeons & Dragons adventure module that created a treatment of the Castle for the public to use. In 2005, Gary Gygax announced the release of \\"Castle Zagyg,\\" his new treatment of the dungeon. ==Location== Castle Greyhawk lies north and slightly east of the Free City of Greyhawk, overlooking the Grey Run River. The Free City of Greyhawk is located centrally in the Flanaess, the eastern portion of the continent of Oerik, the greatest of Oerth's four continents. ==History of the Castle== The Castle was constructed CY c.320 by the wizard Zagig Yragerne. Known as \\"The Mad Archmage,\\" Zagig ruled over the Free City of Greyhawk from the Castle for approximately the next 100 years, after which he abandoned the Castle and mysteriously disappeared. Over the centuries, the Castle's three towers decayed into ruin. The main tower is called the \\"Tower of Zagig,\\" and the two lesser towers the \\"War Tower\\" and the \\"Tower of Magic\\" (alternately \\"The Power Tower\\"). An extensive dungeon complex lies below the towers. In the initial years after the Castle was abandoned, few if any adventurers approached the Castle because of rumors that it lay under a powerful curse. Eventually, a group of Northern barbarians forayed into the area and pillaged a large amount of treasure. The story of their success attracted groups of Dwarves, Elves and other adventurers to the area, and over time the Castle's dungeons became a major site for adventuring on the Flanaess. The influx of trade, travelers and treasure associated with this phenomenon has provided significant economic benefits to the nearby City of Greyhawk. Sometime during this period, Zagig reappeared and managed to imprison the demon lord Fraz-Urb'luu in the dungeons beneath the castle. The fiend was imprisoned there for at least 200 years, but eventually freed by a wizard and a cleric (probably Erac's Cousin and his adventuring companion Ayelerach). In CY 505, Zagig then captured and imprisoned the evil demigod Iuz in the dungeons beneath the Castle. Iuz was one of nine demigods so trapped, and this accomplishment was instrumental in Zagig's ascension to become the demigod now known as Zagyg. Other deities imprisoned in the dungeon included Merikka, Rudd and Wastri. The remaining five demigods have never been canonically identified, although the Living Greyhawk Gazetteer states that the nine were of \\"opposing alignments.\\" Because Zuoken is known to be imprisoned somewhere on the central Flanaess, some believe he was one of the nine deities Zagig trapped at the Castle. Noncanonical lists of the other demigods have been offered by Gary Gygax himself, other early D&D; notables such as Robert J. Kuntz and in various works of fan fiction, although many of these lists cannot be reconciled with the (now canon) \\"opposing alignments\\" criteria noted above. In Expedition to the Ruins of Greyhawk published in 2007, Zuoken was officially confirmed to be one of the canonical deities imprisoned. According to the module, when Iuz was freed, the other gods effected an escape except for Zuoken who remained imprisoned. By the end of the adventure, Zuoken has been freed, Robilar who had been replaced by an evil double is back to his old self and Castle Greyhawk is now some sort of multi-planar brigadoon. In CY 570, the warrior Robilar freed Iuz from his prison, and subsequently most or all of the other eight demigods escaped as well. Note: The 1992 publication From the Ashes (FtA) provides some contradictory dates to those given above. First, it states that construction of the Castle did not begin until CY 375. The adventure module Greyhawk Ruins, however, provides the CY 320 reference for the start of construction. Greyhawk Ruins is both an earlier work and more specifically focused on the Castle itself, and thus would seem to be a more definitive source. Second, FtA suggests both CY 505 and CY 507 as dates for Iuz's initial imprisonment. Given that all other references to Iuz's imprisonment in official game publications use the CY 505 date, the CY 507 anomaly is usually considered to be an error. ==Known levels== ===The Tower of Magic=== *Surface ruins. The surface ruins are mostly abandoned. They include a temple to Boccob, barracks, storerooms, mess halls, and guest quarters. A large band of kobolds currently dwells in the southern half of this ruin, and elves guard the entrance. During Castle Greyhawk's heyday, the Regalia of Neutrality were evidently stored in the Temple of Boccob here, and were the goal of countless pilgrimages. They are now gone, but something of their power still remains. This level is coded P100 in Greyhawk Ruins. *Zagig's Gauntlet (P200). This is a twisted maze designed by Zagig to vent his eccentricities, test the mettle of his apprentices, and guard the crypts below. *The Ochre Crypts (P300). This level contains the crypts of Zagig's apprentices and family members. Living as he did for hundreds of years, he outlived a lot of people. The stonework is a distinctive ochre hue. Expedition to the Ruins of Greyhawk removed the passageway that led to stairs from the surface ruins, connecting the crypts only to Zagig's Gauntlet. *Apprentice's Walk (P400). This level was originally built as dormitories for Zagig's apprentices. For a time this and many other of the levels beneath the Tower of Magic were used for an experiment conducted by the Ring of Five on the impact of magic on the three philosophies of evil. Staircase 2 in the surface ruins has evidently been changed in Expedition to the Ruins of Castle Greyhawk to lead here instead of to the Ochre Crypts, while staircase 4 on this level has evidently been changed to lead from either the surface ruins or Zagig's Gauntlet instead of from the crypts. *The Sanctum Arcanum (P500). This level is a complex of classrooms and laboratories. *The Vaults of Creation (P600). This level was intended for golem creation and research, but never finished. The map was changed extensively between Greyhawk Ruins and Expedition to the Ruins of Greyhawk, but a few of the rooms match up. P612 matches F12, P601 matches F11, and P602 matches F15, but the destinations of the staircases and tunnels leading from those rooms have been altered or blocked. *Master's Walk. These were Zagig's personal workshops and libraries. ==Publication history== Gary Gygax designed Castle Greyhawk as a locale for the amusement of his children and friends and as a testing ground for the game of Dungeons & Dragons that he developed with Dave Arneson during 1972/73. Dungeon levels were written at the rate of one per week as those adventures progressed, leading to the original thirteen-level castle. In those early days, for exploring outwith the immediate area of the castle and nearby city there was no \\"Flanaess\\"; Gygax's world map of \\"Oerth\\" was simply drawn over a map of North America. A second version of Castle Greyhawk was developed/created prior to the publication of Dungeons & Dragons by incorporating Rob Kuntz's \\"El Raja Key\\" (also commenced in 1972), which had been created to allow Gygax to adventure using his own PCs such as Mordenkainen. Castle Greyhawk (TSR, 1988), a humorous/joke treatment of the Castle In 1975, TSR, Inc. published the Greyhawk supplement to the original Dungeons & Dragons rules, although this booklet provided no significant detail regarding Castle Greyhawk itself. Later on, Gygax developed the area around this new version of his castle and Greyhawk City to include new cities and countries as needed, expanding to a surrounding area of around 50 miles mapped in depth and approximately ten times that far in outline form by 1976. In 1978, TSR began publishing adventure modules set in the World of Greyhawk, although these early adventures did not directly concern the Castle. Similarly, TSR's The World of Greyhawk 1980 folio and 1983 World of Greyhawk boxed set provided information regarding the campaign setting at large, but no detail regarding Castle Greyhawk. Between 1983 and 1985, TSR published three modules linked to Castle Greyhawk. These were the 1983 adventure Dungeonland and its sequel The Land Beyond the Magic Mirror, as well as 1985's Isle of the Ape. All three were originally conceived by Gygax as extra-planar extensions of the dungeons below Castle Greyhawk. As published, however, the modules again provided no information regarding the Castle itself or its dungeons. The Castle was first detailed for the general public in 1988 in TSR's adventure Castle Greyhawk. However, as the module was steeped in humor and featured numerous references to 20th century culture (such as the character the Amazing Drider-Man), most Greyhawk fans consider the module to be a \\"joke-version\\" of Castle Greyhawk. In 1989 The City of Greyhawk boxed set expanded on the detail available for the Free City of Greyhawk and its environs for the second edition D&D; rules. The Castle itself received only a minor mention. The Castle finally received serious treatment in 1990, when TSR published Greyhawk Ruins, a 128-page adventure which examined the Castle in great detail. In 2005, Troll Lord Games began publishing \\"Castle Zagyg\\" in a number of volumes authored by Gary Gygax and Jeffery P. Talanian. The Castle Zagyg series is written for the Castles and Crusades game, an OGL game derived from Dungeons & Dragons. These adventures are based on Gygax's original Castle Greyhawk dungeon design and campaign, but are not official D&D; materials. In August 2007, Wizards of the Coast released Expedition to the Ruins of Greyhawk, a 224-page hardcover book that revisits the material from Greyhawk Ruins and updates the site for 3.5 edition D&D; rules. ==Footnotes== ==References== *Breault, Mike, ed.
