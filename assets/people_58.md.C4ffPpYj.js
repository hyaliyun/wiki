Its culms are erect and long, with swollen nodes and hairy leaf sheaths. Leaf blades are long and 3 mm wide; they are stiff, leathery, and convolute. The inflorescence is a panicle in which each spikelet contains one fertile flower. Spikelets are lanceolate and 8.5 mm long. Upper and lower glumes have 1–2 mm long awns, and lateral lemmas have a 13–14 mm long awn, which is three-branched. The grass is a C4 plant. Aristida rufescens is one of the dominant species in the grasslands of the central high plateaus of Madagascar.

It stars Kim Yoon-seok and Ju Ji-hoon. It was released on October 3, 2018. The film was loosely inspired by the 869th episode of ', a South Korean investigation television program, which tells a real story that happened in Busan, where murders were never reported, bodies were never found, and investigations never happened. ==Plot== Kim is a widowed narcotics officer who meets with a potential informant named Kang. As they are talking at a restaurant, Kang is arrested by the homicide division for killing his girlfriend. He confesses to the murder and is put behind bars. A few months later, Kang contacts Kim from prison and claims that he has murdered six other people. However, he refuses to talk to the homicide detectives who he claims fabricated evidence against him to have him imprisoned. Kim agrees to find the real evidence in exchange for information on the remaining six bodies. Kim uncovers the actual evidence with Kang's information, proving the homicide detectives fabricated his case. As a result, the detectives are charged and Kang's sentence is reduced. In return, Kang provides information on the six remaining victims as promised. Of the six remaining victims, Kim first investigates the disappearance of Oh Ji Hee, a former swimmer who is forced to work at a nightclub to support her grandmother in the village. Kang claims he killed her one night after driving her away from the city while working there as a cab driver. Throughout his investigation, Kim is repeatedly told by people he questions about Kang that he is not to be trusted. Still, Kim perseveres. With much difficulty, Kang finds part of Oh's remains. However, when he is interrogated by Kim, Kang lies on record about Kim coercing him to make false statements and bribing him to do so. Furthermore, DNA results show that the remains are not Oh's. The prosecutor cannot indict Kang as the evidence against him is not convincing enough. Kim feels cheated and goes to his former mentor, Song for advice. Song advises Kim to stop pursuing Kang's case since the murderer is trying to make himself appear innocent in other crimes to overturn the sentencing for the crime he is serving time for at present. Kim also visits Kang's older sister, who reveals Kang killed their father when he was just a boy. She helped him cover up the murder. As a result, Kang grew up to become a serial killer who became responsible for many other deaths. Kim cannot bring this case to court since the statute of limitations has ended. With the help of his new partner, Jo, Kim start investigating a second victim, Hwang, who Kang claims he killed by pushing him down a flight of stairs. Kim and Jo look into old files of unsolved cases and find one matching Hwang's murder. The case is brought to trial but since there is only circumstantial evidence, Kang is not convicted of the murder. As a result, Kim is demoted and Jo is transferred to the narcotics division. While clearing his desk, Kim notices an IUD birth control implant in the crime scene photo of the unidentified remains. He then gets a list of all the women who had IUD implants around the time of the murder and discovers one reported missing woman, Park Mi Yong. Kim quickly learns that Park was Kang's girlfriend at the time. She came to the city with her young son. As he grew older, Park realized that her constant fighting with Kang was not healthy for her son. She tries to break up with Kang and this is when he kills her. Kim tracks down Park's son, who is a teenager now, and has him testify in court against Kang. Kang is finally sentenced to life imprisonment. ==CastMain=== *Kim Yoon-seok as Kim Hyung-min *Ju Ji-hoon as Kang Tae-oh ===Supporting=== *Jin Seon-kyu as Detective Jo *Heo Jin as Ji-hee's grandmother *Kwon So-hyun as Oh Ji-hee *Kim Jong-soo as Capt.

Yoon Min-sik from The Korea Herald praised the film and wrote, \\"It is a rare film with strong directing and acting that tells a compelling story with heart, mixed with suspense. The mystery tantalizingly teases viewers as they are sucked into the plot. Ju's portrayal of a psychopathic killer was surprisingly convincing and on-point. While his co-star Kim is as brilliant as expected.\\" Park Bo-ram from Yonhap News Agency also gave praise to the film, \\"The fierce interplay between the two main characters, portrayed by two rounded actors arguably both in the prime of their acting careers, forms the film's core, setting it apart from other crime films that play with cathartic action scenes or steel-strong images of police detectives.\\" === Box office === The film finished in second place during its opening day, grossing from 438,941 attendance, tailing Venom in the lead.

The family were also upset that the film only changed the story's timeline to 2012 (the actual murder case happened in 2007), and that some elements in the film bears great similarity to the actual case, such the convict's age and his murder method. In response to the controversy, the production crew released an official apology statement to the family on September 21, 2018, indicating they had been inconsiderate to the family and they will correspond with the family immediately. On September 27, 2018, the family member of another victim shared a post on his social media account and drew media's attention. The family member had appeared in the 869th episode of ' in 2012, where the program investigated the murder of his mother and other victims. He wrote the reasons why he appeared in that particular program, and also showed support for the release of Dark Figure of Crime, reasoning that the film will bring attention to unreported crimes. On September 28, 2018, the Seoul Central District Court held the first hearing between the production company and the victim's family to decide if the film will be banned from release. The court watched the film for about 50 minutes, focusing on the issues raised by the victims' families where they claimed the film had reenacted almost 99% of the actual crime methods, the locations, time, and the victims' wounds. The court announced their decision by October 1, 2018. On October 1, 2018, the families of the victims withdrew their application for the screening ban, after receiving a sincere apology from the production company and also having considered the film's intention to increase the awareness of unreported crimes. == Awards and nominations == {  !Awards !Category !Recipient !Result !Ref. - rowspan=238th Korean Association of Film Critics Awards Top 11 Films Dark Figure of Crime  rowspan=2 - Best Screenplay Kwak Kyung-taek & Kim Tae-kyun  - 3rd London East Asia Film Festival Best Actor Kim Yoon-seok   -  rowspan=439th Blue Dragon Film Awards  Best Film  Dark Figure of Crime  rowspan=4 - Best Leading Actor Ju Ji-hoon  - Best Screenplay Kwak Kyung-taek & Kim Tae-kyun  - Best New Director Kim Tae-kyun  - rowspan=15th Korean Film Producers Association Awards  Best Actor Ju Ji-hoon  rowspan=1 - rowspan=355th Baeksang Arts Awards Best Film Dark Figure of Crime   rowspan=3 - Best Actor Ju Ji-hoon  - Best Screenplay Kwak Kyung-taek & Kim Tae-kyun  - rowspan=224th Chunsa Film Art Awards  Best Actor Ju Ji-hoon  rowspan=2 -  Best New Director Kim Tae-gyun  -  rowspan=\\"5\\" 28th Buil Film Awards Best Film Dark Figure of Crime   - Best Director Kim Tae-kyun   - Best Actor Ju Ji-hoon   - Best Screenplay Kwak Kyung-taek & Kim Tae-kyun   - Best Cinematography Hwang Gi-seok   - } ==References* Dark Figure of Crime at Naver Category:Showbox films Category:2018 crime drama films Category:2018 films Category:Korean-language films Category:Drama films based on actual events Category:Crime films based on actual events Category:South Korean films Category:South Korean crime drama films ","title":"Dark Figure of Crime (film)"},{"id":"56746492","text":"Arun Jain (born 30 December 1959) is a Chennai-based Indian industrialist, investor and philanthropist. He is the chairman and managing director of Intellect Design Arena Limited, an IT software products company in the banking, financial services and insurance space which is listed in the National Stock Exchange as Intellect. He was also the founder, Chairman and CEO of Polaris Consulting and Services Ltd. (formerly known as Polaris Software Labs), an IT services company. On 4 March 2016, Virtusa Corporation acquired a majority stake in Polaris Consulting & Services Limited. Arun has also been appointed the Chief Mentor of the Centre of Excellence for FinTech set up by Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY), Govt. of India, Member of National Software Product Mission, strategic forum for implementation of National Policy on Software Products 2019 constituted by MeitY. He is a Governing Council Member of STPI and also a Member in the Advisory Council of TechNest,https://it.tn.gov.in/sites/default/files/2019-08/IT_e_24_2018_Ms_0-compressed.pdf an incubation facility provided by STPI-Chennai. He has held, and continues to hold, positions in CII, MMA, National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology (NIELIT) and the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce. == Career == After his graduation, Arun interned with Wang Laboratories in the United States following which he was offered permanent employment. However, he returned to India to set up what would become a global IT company. He began his entrepreneurial journey at an early age when, as a child, he set up a street-food stall in Delhi that was profitable and, later, as a college student when he helped raise funds for a charitable cause by organising a film show. After graduating, Arun, along with friends Vishnu Dusad and Yogesh Andlay started International Information Systems (IIS) in 1983 as a partnership firm with all three sharing key responsibilities: Vishnu Dusad took charge of marketing, Arun Jain became the chief operating officer and Yogesh Andlay, the Chief Technologist. In 1986, IIS was renamed as Nucleus Software Workshop Pvt. Ltd. At a professional level, his first major enterprise was the establishment of Nucleus Software Workshop in 1986. In 1993, he founded Polaris Software Lab with an initial capital of $250, which recorded a CAGR of over 100% during the seven-year period 1993–2000. Intellect Design Arena Ltd. is his fourth venture in pursuit of his vision to make India the IP capital towards the next growth wave for the IT Industry with a strong focus on products. An evangelist of Design thinking, Arun's brainchild – FinTech 8012, the world's first design center, in Chennai – dedicated to Financial Technology came into being. An avid practitioner, he also evangelises Design Thinking through public workshops, branded as UnMukt – a unique workshop where participants explore and immerse themselves in Design Thinking. UnMukt (meaning ‘free from bondage’) not only simplifies the learning process but also dispels the barriers to learning. === The Design Thinking Journey === During a press interaction in 2007, a journalist asked Arun Jain a question that sent him on a trail to discover the answer. The question was: “What do you ascribe your success to... what is your unique trait that drives growth and performance at Polaris?” At that time, he was reading a book that drew his attention to the fact that his company was naturally practising Design Thinking. In 2011, an IDEO TED Talk on Design made a deep impact on Arun. On reviewing his learning, he was convinced that his company was instinctively practising the science of simplification, which was close to Design Thinking. As soon as the connection between Design Thinking and his management training workshop (UnMukt) was made, there was a quantum leap in the way the company leveraged Design Thinking. === Design Thinking for Everyone === Arun Jain is a strong believer that Design Thinking is a life skill for the masses and is not limited to any field. That is why he not only created the World's First Design Center for Financial Institutions but also went on to establish the School of Design Thinking to this cause. He has led the curation of the curriculum for all the courses, workshops and programs for almost every section of society offered by the institutions he has built. Programs/Workshops conducted here include: * UnMukt: Preparing the Design Mind: A workshop aimed at teaching the basic principles of Design Thinking and understanding its applicability in today's world of ever-changing dynamics. * 10x Growth for Entrepreneurs: 10 mantras for 10x Growth. * Design Thinking for Educators: Enabling educators/teachers to apply Design Thinking at work. * Customer Centricity for Startups: Helping startup founders/entrepreneurs achieve the best business design for their organisation. === UnMukt: Preparing the Design Mind === UnMukt is a flagship workshop where participants explore and immerse themselves in the art and science of Design Thinking. It has evolved into a platform for design seekers to congregate, learn mutually and gain exposure to a Design Mind which is indispensable for Design Thinking. === World's First Design Center === To reinforce the value of Design Thniking, a 30,000 sq. ft. FinTech 8012, the World's First Design Center in Chennai, was inaugurated in 2013. Dedicated to Financial Technology, it is a testimony to Arun's – and the company's – commitment to Design Thinking. A second such center was created in Mumbai in 2015. The FinTech 8012 Design Center plays a vital role in bringing together the three pillars of financial organisations – Business, Technology and Operations – which are rarely aligned in their goals and help them focus on a common goal – the end-user. It enables the amalgamation of the three units’ goals to achieve good design through co- creation and collaboration. === School of Design Thinking === Incorporated in 2016 with a mission to create a Design Thinking movement in the country, School of Design Thinking (SoDT) is unique in its approach towards the very concept. With equal importance given to the ability of Design Thinking in solving complex problems, SoDT also focuses on ‘Preparing the Design Mind’ of people. Along with working on the critical elements of the human mind, the School of Design Thinking has also crafted a 5-step Design Thinking Process facilitated by various design tools to solve complex problems. == Personal life == Arun was born in a middle-class family of nine siblings (eight sisters and an elder brother). His father was an Accounts officer in the Govt. of India's Postal & Telegraph (P&T;) department. He completed his bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Delhi College of Engineering (now known as Delhi Technological University). == Philanthropy == Arun has had an early interest in social engineering: starting from fund-raising at a cinema to creating and supporting sustainable nation-wide projects. Among the initiatives he has created and led, in recent times, are: === Ullas Trust: Encouraging Academic Excellence === Ullas Trust was started in 1997 by Arun Jain, with an aim to integrate associates of Polaris, and later Intellect, with the larger community and enable them to enjoy the satisfaction of working with young minds in the country. The Trust is a joint initiative of the employees and the organisation. Its primary motive is to shape the thinking of young, adolescent minds (Grades 9–12) with specific focus on the economically- challenged sections (studying in Municipal, Govt. and Govt.-aided Schools) of society towards chasing their dreams and aspirations. Every year, Ullas selects over 1200 students through an entrance examination and these selected students, known as ‘Young Achievers’, are invited to a workshop called ‘CAN DO’ that publicly recognises their achievement/enrolment into Ullas, facilitates interactions with inspiring role models from public life, and plants the seed to 'Dream Big with Conviction!' === Mission Samriddhi: A Social Impact Enterprise === He is also the Founder of ‘Mission Samriddhi’, a social impact enterprise dedicated to holistic human development in India, through the design and development of projects that are sustainable and capable of scale to positively impact the larger population. Projects are currently supported in seven clusters including: Leadership Capacity Building, Farm-to-Fabric, Farm-to-Table, Scientific Agricultural Training, Education, Community Health and Grassroots Relief. The objectives of Mission Samriddhi are: Celebrate, Connect, Catalyse. === PoleStar Foundation: Celebrating Excellence in Journalism and Social Impact === The PoleStar Foundation, instituted in 1998, recognises, honours and celebrates the outstanding contribution made by Indian media professionals and social impact organisations through the eponymously-named PoleStar Awards. Awardees are selected by an independent and distinguished panel of jury members. For many years now, this annual award pays tribute to journalists and social impact enablers for their contribution and commitment to the nation and its people, and also for tirelessly acting as a catalyst in disseminating quality information and support to the world. == Awards and recognition == * Lifetime Achievement Award by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) at India's premier ICT Event, Connect 2016. * Visionary of India 2014–15 Award, at the Brand Vision India 2020 Summit & Awards. * Indo-ASEAN Business Initiative Award 2008 from the then Indian High Commissioner and currently India's External Affairs Minister, Dr. S.

Featuring dialogue in English and Korean languages, the film was released on December 26, 2018. ==Plot== Fearing a third world war situation, CIA agent \\"Mac\\" Mackenzie recruits Ahab, the captain of an elite mercenary company named Black Lizard to infiltrate a secret underground bunker located 30 meters below the Korean DMZ and take out a target. However, it is soon revealed the target is King, the Supreme Leader of North Korea. Along with his team, Ahab attacks the forces surrounding King and takes everyone hostage. However, as they're about to leave after killing the hostages, Ahab's man is attacked and despite Logan's requests to wait and request for a medevac, Ahab is ordered to move. Arriving at his room, Ahab finds himself taken hostage by a teammate who offers him a better deal after shooting both Logan and King. However, Ahab manages to acquire a gun and kills him, and then proceeds to the bathroom where he thinks King to be dead. He manages to set up the whole contact system there. Mac makes it clear that everyone dies if King does the same. However, Ahab is found to be crippled with an artificial right leg. Its being broken limits him from movement, and he orders his men to search for the doctor who came along with King. Using a motion camera, he manages to locate Dr. Yoon Ji- eui and his fellow members. His men save them from being attacked, while Yoon instructs Ahab to bring back King's heartbeat back. He tells him to transfer O+ blood into King's body, but finds the blood pouch useless. He then calls a wounded Logan to the bathroom and after injecting him, starts transferring blood from his body to that of the King despite of Logan's constant requests to not do so. Soon, the bunker is bombed, leaving Ahab and Yoon trapped, Logan dead and Ahab's army fighting the rivals. Ahab and Yoon manage to contact each other and the latter helps him with extracting a bullet from his thigh. However, Ahab ends up tearing an artery, following which he tapes up his wound and instructs Yoon to find the blood pouches. In the meanwhile, Ahab finds network on his phone and receives a call from Mac. He asks for backup but is shocked to learn that she's been stripped off her charges and a second bombing has been ordered. He's told that while he and King would be rescued with President McGregor's support, his team and the North Korean doctor would be eliminated. Ahab leads Yoon to the room where he finds blood pouches but is stopped by an agent who's attacked by the former. With his team slowly dying, Ahab and Yoon remain the only survivors being hunted for. They manage to meet at the bathroom where Yoon transfers his own blood to King's body upon finding the blood pouches destroyed. Another gunfight ensues when the rivals enter the bathroom but are then shot by the backup team sent by Mac. President McGregor declares Ahab as a hero who fought to rescue King from the enemies, and eventually wins public support. Ahab, King and Yoon are rescued and taken in a plane which is soon attacked. An unconscious Yoon falls out of the plane and Ahab jumps with a parachute, first saving King and then Yoon by holding him tight as they swiftly reach the surface. Both Ahab and Yoon survive, and the latter gives him a shoulder as they begin walking. ==CastProduction== Principal photography began on August 4, 2017, and wrapped on December 1, 2017. ==References *Official website * * *Take Point at Naver Movies Category:2018 films Category:2018 action films Category:South Korean action films Category:English-language films Category:Korean-language films Category:South Korean films Category:CJ Entertainment films Category:Fictional mercenaries Category:Films set in North Korea Category:Films directed by Kim Byung-woo ","title":"Take Point"},{"id":"56746537","text":"Amelia Sophie Johnson, (born 1972) is a British journalist.

The cases of Vaginitis emphysematosa are rare. The most important thing is that women never consult with the doctors for particularly Vaginitis emphysematosa but when they visit a doctor for some other reproductive health issue, they diagnose with the Vaginitis emphysematosa fortunately. Vaginitis emphysematosa is not common and Gynaecologists rarely know about it. Basically, this is characterised by gas- filled cysts in the mucosa of the vagina. Vaginitis emphysematosa is usually a self limited cystic disorder of the vagina. It is a very rare condition and has not much specific features to arouse clinical suspicion. The term Vaginitis emphysematosa has 'vaginitis' in it but it has been observed that inflammation is generally mild and absent. This is characterised by gas-filled cysts in the vaginal wall and does not imply life-threatening infection. == Symptoms and signs== Vaginitis emphysematosa occurs primarily in pregnant women, but there are some cases of non-pregnant women too. It is a rare, benign vaginal cyst identified in 173 cases. Women that have been affected were 42 to 65 years old. The cysts appear grouped but defined from one another, smooth, and can be as large as 2 cm. Symptoms included: vaginal discharge, itching, sensation of pressure, appearance of nodules, and sometimes a \\"popping sound\\". == Causes == The cause is unknown. Histological examination showed the cysts contained pink hyaline-like material, foreign body-type giant cells in the cyst's wall, with chronic inflammatory cell fluid. The gas-filled cysts are identified with CT imaging. The gas contained in the cysts has been analysed and consists of nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and sulphur dioxide. Treatment may not be required and no complications follow the resolution of the cysts. It may be associated with immunosuppression, trichomonas, or Haemophilus vaginalis infection.

The church was founded in the 19th century, though the present structure dates from the 1920s. ==Original church== A Catholic presence began in Treforest soon after the Great Famine in Ireland (1840s), when many Irish immigrants arrived in South Wales. At the time, there was no place of worship in Treforest, and spiritual needs were catered for by clergy travelling in from Merthyr Tydfil and Aberdare. A school was founded in , though Aberdare continued issuing baptismal certificates for the district until 1868. The first St Dyfrig's (the saint was first referred to by his Latin name of Dubricius) was opened on Bridge Street in 1868. At first, the school was annexed to it, but in 1884 it moved to a new location, where it remained into the early 1960s. ==Current church== Soon after the First World War, the original church was becoming too small for its congregation. In 1914, Senghennydd was partitioned from Treforest, with the congregants from the area transferring to the new All Souls Church in Senghenydd, though overcrowding remained a problem at St Dubricius', with worshippers sometimes obliged to sit outside the door. Work began on the replacement church on Broadway in 1926, and it was consecrated on 24 November 1927 by Archbishop Francis Mostyn. In the 1930s, the dedication was amended from Dubricius to Dyfrig. There was a reordering in the 1950s, when a new altar was installed. A life-sized crucifix and side-panels were added in 1999 by Penanne Crabbe. The church gained Listed status in 2001. The church is open during the week, and as the only Catholic church within easy distance of the University of South Wales' Treforest campus, it is often attended by students during term time. ==References== Category:Churches completed in 1927 Category:Grade II listed churches in Rhondda Cynon Taf Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1927 Category:Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cardiff Category:Religious organizations established in 1868 ","title":"St Dyfrig's Church, Treforest"},{"id":"56746642","text":"alpha-Galactosylceramide (α-GalCer, KRN7000) is a synthetic glycolipid derived from structure-activity relationship studies of galactosylceramides isolated from the marine sponge Agelas mauritianus. α-GalCer is a strong immunostimulant and shows potent anti-tumour activity in many in vivo models. == Immunostimulatory properties == α-GalCer is a potent activator of iNKT cells, and a model CD1d antigen.

Major League Baseball Advanced Media, No. 303630 (N.Y. Sup. Bronx Co. 2014), was a New York Supreme Court defamation case. Andrew Rector sued Major League Baseball, the New York Yankees, ESPN and their MLB announcers for broadcasting images of him sleeping at a game at Yankee Stadium between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox and allegedly making defamatory comments about him. Rector sued for $10 million for \\"defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress\\". The case was dismissed by Judge Julia Rodriguez, who ruled that the statements made were not defamatory. == Background == On April 13, 2014, Rector attended Yankee Stadium to watch the New York Yankees play the Boston Red Sox in a Yankees–Red Sox rivalry game. During the fourth inning, Rector was filmed by ESPN sleeping in his seat with the footage broadcast to viewers during their live coverage of the game. ESPN New York announcers Dan Shulman and John Kruk made a number of jokes about him when his image was placed on the stadium jumbotron. They initially commented that Rector was oblivious to the quality of MLB.tv that they had been promoting in commentary prior to Rector's image being broadcast and then made comments about Rector, questioning how he could sleep through a Carlos Beltran home run and stated that the person who sat next to him did not want to share his food with Rector. They also compared Rector's body size to Kruk's. MLB later posted the broadcast video of Rector sleeping online where it was covered by a number of media organizations worldwide. Rector filed a defamation lawsuit at the New York Supreme Court in The Bronx, New York against MLB, ESPN, the Yankees and the ESPN announcers for $10 million alleging that they subjected him to \\"an unending verbal crusade\\". Legal experts speculated that the challenge would not be successful owing to the statements causing emotional stress rather than damaging reputation and due to defamation cases historically being unsuccessful under New York State law. == Case == Rector alleged in his claim, which was reportedly full of typographical and grammatical errors, that the announcers had called him \\"a fatty cow\\", then used words such as stupor, unintelligent and stupid, and said that he was \\"not worthy to be a fan.\\" He also alleged that MLB.com had posted numerous memes, including one of him involved in a homosexual kiss and one with the caption of \\"Yankee's Fan cares not for your rivalry talk\\", that implied that he supported what was occurring in the images. He claimed that the MLB's posting of the video online \\"set the stage\\" for further defamatory comments from online viewers. The MLB's legal team filed a motion to dismiss on procedural grounds, as Rector had not stated a cause of action, and the statements in question had been loose and hyperbolic and not malicious defamation. The MLB, ESPN and the New York Yankees submitted CD copies of both the incident and the entire broadcast, which they stated showed that the statements alleged by the plaintiff were not made. In court, Judge Julia Rodriguez granted the defendants' motions. In her judgement, she stated that the CDs of the broadcasts showed that the announcers did not make the statements alleged in the complaint and that they had been made by other individuals on websites not run by the defendants. While she agreed that comments had been made about Rector's weight and his ability to sleep through a standing ovation, he was only shown and commented on for 31 seconds; the judge ruled the comments made did not meet the legal standard of defamation. She also stated that ESPN had not broadcast Rector unauthorized, as it was common practice for broadcasters at baseball games to show spectators. Judge Rodriguez stated that with regard to Rector's claim of \\"emotional distress\\", none of the alleged comments were attributable to the defendants and they could not be held responsible for alleged defamatory comments made by third parties on third-party websites, as there was no duty of care to protect him from those statements. As a result, the case was dismissed. == Aftermath == Following Rector's filing of the case being made public, news organisations criticized the action as frivolous litigation. Legal commentators stated that due to the media attention that the case brought, Rector probably ended up causing more damage to his reputation by bringing the case than the initial broadcast would have.

It was inscribed to the National Key Buddhist Temples in Han Chinese Area's list in 1983. ==History== Zhusheng Temple was first construction as \\"Mituotai\\" () during the Tang dynasty (618-907) by master Chengyuan (), the Third Patriarch of Pure Land Buddhism. In 779, Emperor Daizong of Tang inscribed and honored the name \\"Bozhou Daochang\\" (). During the Zhenyuan period of Emperor Dezong of Tang (785-805), the Tang emperor named the temple \\"Mituo Temple\\" (). Since Emperor Wuzong (814-846) of the Tang dynasty (618-907) believed in Taoism, he ordered to demolish Buddhist temples, confiscate temple lands and force monks to return to secular life. This was known as \\"Huichang Suppression of Buddhism\\" (). The temple was completely destroyed in the movement. During the period of Five Dynasties and Ten Reigns (930-960), King Wumu of Chu Ma Yin rebuilt the temple and named it \\"Baoguo Temple\\" (). During the Taiping Xingguo period (968-976) of Song dynasty (960-1279), Emperor Taizong of Song renamed it \\"Shengye Temple\\" (). In 1119, Emperor Huizong of Song believed in Taoism, he ordered to change the Buddhist temple to Taoist temple and named it \\"Shenxiao Palace\\" (). During the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368), Shengye Temple was enlarged burned, and rededicated several times. In 1635, during the late Ming dynasty (1368-1644), abbot Foding () renovated the temple. In 1705, in the 44th year of Kangxi period of Qing dynasty (1644-1911), Kangxi Emperor made an inspection trip in the south, Zhao Shenqiao (), provincial governor of Hunan, changed the temple to a Royal palace, but Kangxi Emperor didn't come here. In 1713, Kangxi Emperor gave the temple a set of Dragon-store (). In 1727, in the 5th year of Yongzheng period, Yongzheng Emperor renamed the temple \\"Zhusheng Temple\\" (), and has continued to this day. During the early Republic period (1911-1949), master Kongye () established a Tiantai school here. In 1929, master Lingtao () founded the Buddhist Institute of Mount Heng here. On May 7, 1937, Ye Jianying organised the Rescue Association of Mount Heng Buddhism and Taoism () here. After the establishment of the Communist State in 1956, the Buddhist Association of Mount Heng was set up here. During the Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards had attacked the temple, scriptures, historical documents, and other works of art were either removed, damaged or destroyed, many original Buddha statues and musical instruments of the temple had been lost, but the buildings and halls still intact. In 1979, according to the national policy of free religious belief, Zhusheng Temple was reconstructed and reopened. It has been designated as a National Key Buddhist Temple in Han Chinese Area in 1983. ==Architecture== Along the central axis of the temple stand five buildings including shanmen, Hall of Four Heavenly King, Mahavira Hall, Dharma Hall and Abbot's Room. ===Mahavira Hall=== The Mahavira Hall is the third hall in the temple. In the center of the temple enshrines the statue of Sakyamuni with Amitabha standing on the left and Bhaisajyaguru on the right. ==GalleryReferences Category:Buddhist temples in Hunan Category:Nanyue District ","title":"Zhusheng Temple (Hunan)"},{"id":"56746691","text":"Julie Salinger, née Braun (31 July 1863 – 16 September 1942) was a German liberal politician and one of the first female members of the parliament of Saxony. == Biography == Julie Salinger's Stolperstein in Dresden, Bayreuther Strasse 14 Salinger was born Julie Braun in Ortelsburg, East Prussia (Szczytno).

There were 1,060 confirmed cases of listeriosis during the outbreak, and about 216 deaths. It is the world's worst ever listeriosis outbreak. == Investigation of the origin == Prior to 2017, an average of 60 to 80 listeriosis cases were confirmed in South Africa per year. The outbreak was first identified by doctors at Chris Hani and Steve Biko academic hospitals in July 2017, who notified the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) about an unusually high number of neonatal infections. Interviews conducted by the authorities with people who contracted listeriosis indicated that processed cold meats, most notably polony, was the likely cause of the outbreak. The source of the outbreak at the Enterprise Foods facility was only discovered after nine five-year-old children from Soweto were brought to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in mid-January 2018. Samples taken from Enterprise and Rainbow Chicken polony products at the crèche the children attended tested positive for the strain of listeriosis causing the outbreak and led investigators to the infected production facilities. On March 4, 2018, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi announced that the disease was traced to the Enterprise processed meats factory in Polokwane. Environmental samples from the factory were found to contain the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes strain ST 6, the strain responsible for the outbreak. Additionally, further samples from another Enterprise factory in Germiston and from a Rainbow Chicken factory in the Free State tested positive for Listeria, although which strain these samples tested positive for is not yet known. == Impact == A range of processed meats -polony meats dyed pink to the right of the sign- for sale in a South African supermarket in Cape Town. A note states that all Enterprise and Rainbow Chicken products have been recalled. Laboratory-confirmed listeriosis cases started to rise in mid-2017 and peaked in December 2017, with 32 cases in a week. Gauteng was the province with the most cases, 58%, followed by Western Cape with about 13%. A report from the National Department of Health in July 2018 stated there had been 1,060 laboratory-confirmed cases of listeriosis, and 216 deaths. ===Reactions after cause was known=== Following the announcement, Tiger Brand's stock price on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange dropped by 7%, resulting in a R5.7bn (equivalent to US$438.69 million) reduction in total value. At a press conference the next day, Tiger Brands CEO Lawrence MacDougall denied responsibility, stating \\"There is no direct link between any of the deaths and our products.\\" When pressed by journalists, he refused to apologize. The South African government issued a recall notice of all products of RCL Foods Limited and Enterprise Foods and Rainbow Chicken facilities on March 4. Tiger Brands reportedly admitted to knowing about the presence of listeria in some of its products eighteen days before the government recall. On March 5, Botswana, Namibia, Mauritius, Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia suspended all imports of processed meat from South Africa. Kenya followed suit on the next day. In December 2018 the South Gauteng High Court granted a certification order opening up the process for class-action lawsuit against Tiger Brands for around 1,000 claimants. Each claimant might be eligible to seek between R100,000 and R2,000,000 in compensation for their losses due to the outbreak. ==References== Category:2010s disease outbreaks Category:2017 health disasters Category:2018 health disasters Category:2017 in South Africa Category:2018 in South Africa Category:Cantaloupe Category:Disease outbreaks in South Africa Category:Listeriosis Category:Food safety scandals Category:Polokwane Category:2017 scandals Category:2018 scandals ","title":"2017–2018 South African listeriosis outbreak"},{"id":"56746808","text":"The 2018 Elite One is the 58th season of the Cameroon top-tier football league.

The organization was baptized after Rigas Feraios, a national hero from the Greek War of Independence. EKON Rigas Feraios was the youth wing of the Communist Party of Greece (Interior) and formed the backbone of the party. Rather than being merely a front of the mother party, the Rigas Feraios youth organization exercised significant influence over the party. At its peak, EKON Rigas Feraios had some 15,000-17,000 members. The Rigas Feraios youth organization was established in 1967, shortly after the beginning of the Regime of the Colonels. It was the first illegal youth organization to emerge after the coup. The organization succeeded the now defunct Lambrakis Democratic Youth (DNL), the founders of Rigas Feraios had belonged to DNL. Rigas Feraios members were active in organizing resistance to the new regime, distributing leaflets and painting anti-junta graffiti around the country. By September 18, 1968 many Rigas Feraios organizers had been arrested by the junta. On October 29, 1968 the Rigas Feraios leadership was put on trial. The defendants were sentenced to jail, with sentences ranging from 5 to 21 years. A failed attempt to initiate low-scale armed struggle was launced in , with the formation of the 'Aris-Rigas Feraios' armed group. The Rigas Feraios organization aligned with the New Left, although influenced by Eurocommunism. As the Communist Party of Greece split in 1968, Rigas Feraios became increasingly tied to the Communist Party of Greece (Interior). Rigas Feraios, which took a critical stance of the Soviet Union, would now compete with the pro-Soviet Communist Youth of Greece (KNE) over the influence of the leftwing youth movement in the country. By 1972 Rigas Feraios was the largest youth organization, although KNE eventually outgrew it. EKON Rigas Feraios had a key role in organizing the November 1973 Athens Polytechnic uprising against the military junta. The student wing of EKON Rigas Feraios was known as 'Democratic Struggle- Democratic Unity' (DA-DE). In 1974 DA-DE won 14.6% of the national student vote, in 1975 16.42%, in 1976 17.52%, in 1977 20.94% and in 1978 in 16.7%. During the 1970s EKON Rigas Feraios underwent period of internal strife, which ended up in a formal split in 1978 as the minority wing formed the B Panelladiki. The influence of EKON Rigas Feraois declined towards the end of the 1970s. In 1979, DA-DE won 7.5% of the national student vote. In 1980 it obtained 8.9% and in 1981 10.1%. ==References== Category:Youth wings of communist parties Category:Youth wings of political parties in Greece Category:Rigas Feraios Category:1967 establishments in Greece ","title":"Greek Communist Youth – Rigas Feraios"},{"id":"56746859","text":"Nisar Wahdat (born 22 June 1999) is an Afghan cricketer.

Following their promotion in the 1993–94 season this was their fifth consecutive season in the highest tier of Swiss football. René C. Jäggi was the club's chairman for the third year.

It was originally described as a Tristachya species by Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck in 1841 and was transferred to Loudetia by Charles Edward Hubbard in 1934. The species is a perennial bunch grass, with culms erect and long. Leaves are mostly basal, with flat, convolute blades long and 2–5 mm wide. The inflorescence is a long panicle of spikelets, each containing one sterile and one fertile flower. The lemma carries a 25–50 mm long awn. Like all Loudetia species, L. simplex uses C4 photosynthesis and occurs in open habitats, often on poor shallow soils. It is a significant weed species. Two subspecies have been described: *Loudetia simplex subsp. simplex *Loudetia simplex subsp. stipoides In Madagascar, it is one of the dominant grassland species in the central high plateaus, where it occurs on leached, poorly drained soils and is quite fire-resistant. In Malagasy, it is known locally as horona, horo, berambo, kilailay, kirodrotra, or felika.

Right after beating Briggs, Ibragimov told me that he wanted to face a world champion in his next fight, in the end we contacted members of Ruslan Chagaev's team and agreed on everything\\", said the president of Seminole Warriors Boxing promotion company Leon Margules during the first pre-fight press-conference, \\"Both Sultan and Ruslan are true fighters. They are not interested in easy fights and title defenses against mandatory challengers. They want to unify belts and once again return prestige to the heavyweight division. I'm confident that the winner of this fight will eventually become the undisputed heavyweight champion\\". It was going to be the first heavyweight unification fight since 1999 and the third boxing event considered major for Moscow since WBC world heavyweight champion Oleg Maskaev defended his title against Okello Peter and heavyweight contender Alexander Povetkin faced fringe contender Larry Donald. On 31 July 2007, it was officially announced that the unification showdown was cancelled due to Chagaev suffering from an aggravation of gastric problems. It was later reported that Chagaev had been diagnosed with hepatitis B. Instead, former undisputed heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield agreed to step in as a last- minute replacement. In the build up, Ibragimov praised Holyfield for his legendary career: \\"I remember watching his legendary heavyweight fights of the 90s when I was young. Some of them were unforgettable, like those against Riddick Bowe. Of course [back then] I couldn't imagine that I would fight Holyfield one day.\\" He also added: \\"In the training camp, we put a lot of emphasis on defense. Holyfield is a dirty fighter who uses his head and elbows a lot.\\" For the fight, Holyfield weighed in at 211.5 pounds, his lightest since 1996. ==The fight== The beginning of the fight was tentative, with Ibragimov mostly staying on the outside and avoiding exchanges, keeping Holyfield at bay with fast combinations. By the third round, Ibragimov began to take control of the fight. In the fifth round, Ibragimov's in-ring dominance became more visible after he was able to hurt Holyfield with combinations to the head and body, and by the seventh the fight took on one- sided manner as Holyfield appeared to be unable to keep up with his younger foe. Holyfield had some success in the eighth, hurting Ibragimov with a counter body shot and a straight right hand. Ibragimov appeared to be unwilling to end the fight inside the distance in order not to walk into a game-changing counter punch. The championship rounds saw Holyfield unsuccessfully going for the knockout, as Ibragimov was able to effectively neutralize Holyfield's offense and hurt Holyfield with precise body shots. Ultimately, the fight went full twelve rounds, with Ibragimov being declared the winner by unanimous decision, successfully defending his WBO world heavyweight title. The judges scored the bout 117–111 (twice) and 118–110. ==Aftermath== Ibragimov would agree to face IBF champion Wladimir Klitschko in the first heavyweight unification bout since 1999, losing his title in a unanimous decision before retiring. Holyfield would spend more than a year out of ring before facing WBA champion Nikolai Valuev where he would be on the end of a controversial majority decision ending his hopes of beating George Foreman's record as the oldest heavyweight champion in history. ==Undercard== Confirmed bouts: ==References== Category:2007 in boxing Category:Boxing matches involving Evander Holyfield Category:World Boxing Organization heavyweight championship matches Category:Boxing in Russia Category:Sports competitions in Moscow Category:October 2007 sports events in Europe ","title":"Sultan Ibragimov vs. Evander Holyfield"},{"id":"56747006","text":"Frances Cecil, Countess of Exeter (2 December 1630 - 2 December 1669), formerly Lady Frances Manners, was the first wife of John Cecil, 4th Earl of Exeter.

Educated in Leipzig, he settled in the United States in 1935 and became an American citizen in 1942. Bomhard was the founder of Kentucky Opera which he managed and conducted from its inception in 1952 until his retirement in 1982. ==Early life== Bomhard was born in Munich, one of the three children of Johanna and Ernst von Bomhard, an industrial engineer. He was educated in law at the University of Leipzig but also received a diploma in music from the Leipzig Conservatory. There he met Leila Atkinson a Kentucky-born cellist who was to become his first wife. They settled in New York in 1935 where Bomhard studied conducting on a fellowship at the Juilliard School. In 1937 he took up a teaching position at Princeton University which included conducting both the university's orchestra and glee club. During his time at Princeton he composed three symphonies, a concerto for strings, and pieces of chamber, piano, and vocal music. He also supplemented his income by coaching singers and choral groups and teaching piano privately. Bombard became an American citizen in 1942 and served in the US Army during World War II. Leila died in 1945 after suffering severe mental illness which had confined her to a hospital. After the war, Bomhard studied at Columbia Teachers College, receiving his master's degree in 1947. However, he did not take up a formal teaching career. Instead he formed a small professional opera troupe called Opera for College (later renamed New Lyric Stage). The troupe travelled around the Eastern United States performing at colleges that had no opera departments of their own. He also composed incidental music for Margo Jones's regional theatre productions and served as composer-arranger for the Philharmonic Piano Quartet. ==Forging a career in opera== In 1949, Fletcher Smith, who had studied with Bomhard at Juilliard and was then head of the Voice Department at the University of Louisville, invited him to produce an opera to be performed by the students there. Bombard chose The Marriage of Figaro, and it proved to be a great success. Bomhard returned in 1950 and 1951 to produce Menotti's The Old Maid and the Thief and Puccini's Gianni Schicchi. Their box-office success following on from that of The Marriage of Figaro led him to disband his New Lyric Stage troupe and settle in Louisville where he and a group of Louisville citizens founded the Kentucky Opera Association in 1952. Later called Kentucky Opera, it was the city's first professional opera company and the twelfth oldest regional opera company in the United States. He soon formed a partnership with the Louisville Philharmonic Society orchestra for the fledgling company to produce and record five new operas in English commissioned by the orchestra. One of these was Peggy Glanville-Hicks's The Transposed Heads which premiered in April 1954 conducted by Bomhard. He wrote a German translation of the Transposed Heads libretto for a possible performance in Germany. She thought he looked like John Barrymore. They became lovers and travelled to Europe together in the summer of 1954. Glanville-Hicks broke off the affair the following summer. In her letter to him of 8 August 1955 she blamed the fact that she was more in love with him than he with her and his dalliance with the soprano who had created the role of Sita in Transposed Heads. Apart from 1960–61, when he took a leave of absence to work at the Hamburg State Opera, Bomhard managed Kentucky Opera continuously until his retirement in 1982. In the early years of the company when it had an annual budget of only $10,000 to produce three operas, Bomhard not only conducted the performances, but was also the stage director and répétiteur and designed and helped build the sets. He also travelled to New York to scout young singers who showed great promise but did not yet command high salaries. He brought the 26-year-old Tatiana Troyanos to Kentucky Opera to sing her first ever Carmen in 1964. In the 1960s and early 1970s Bomhard concurrently taught at the University of Louisville music school, produced an annual opera for Memphis Opera Theatre in Tennessee, and produced and hosted two cultural series for WAVE television and radio. ==Later years== In 1963 Bombard had married the mezzo-soprano Charme Riesley. She sang Cherubino in his 1949 production of The Marriage of Figaro at Louisville and performed with Kentucky Opera both before and after their marriage. She appeared in Ariadne auf Naxos in December 1981, Bombard's last production for the company, and in 1983 accompanied him to the opening of the Kentucky Center for the Arts, whose Moritz von Bomhard Theater was named in his honor. Charme died in 1984 at the age of 55 after a long illness. According to The Encyclopedia of Louisville, her death was \\"a blow from which he never really recovered.\\" In 1994, Bomhard left Louisville for Europe to be near his only remaining relatives, a niece and nephew. He settled in Salzburg, Austria in January 1995 and died there on 23 July 1996 at the age of 88. He is buried in the Von Bombard family tomb in Munich. ==References *Maestro, a KET television documentary on Bomhard: Part 1 and Part 2 (complete episodes) *Bomhard's letter to the New York Times of 27 April 1942, in which he describes the difficulties of young conductors trying to find a place for themselves in American musical life. *The Bomhard Fellowship in Music Composition, University of Louisville Category:1908 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Musicians from Munich Category:Music directors (opera) Category:Opera managers Category:German male classical composers Category:German classical composers Category:American classical composers Category:20th-century conductors (music) Category:German emigrants to the United States Category:20th-century male musicians ","title":"Moritz von Bomhard"},{"id":"56747084","text":"Egnasia accingalis is a moth of the family Noctuidae first described by Francis Walker in 1858.

The inner metallic cylinder is cloaked by outer metal plates. Sergei Anatolyevich Tretyakov () (born in 1956) is a Russian-Finnish scientist, focused in electromagnetic field theory, complex media electromagnetics and microwave engineering. He is currently a professor at Department of Electronics and Nanoengineering, Aalto University (former Helsinki University of Technology), Finland. His main research area in recent years is metamaterials and metasurfaces from fundamentals to applications. He was the president of the European Virtual Institute for Artificial Electromagnetic Materials and Metamaterials (”Metamorphose VI”) and general chair of the Metamaterials Congresses from 2007 to 2013. He is a fellow/member of many scientific associations such as IEEE, URSI, the Electromagnetics Academy, and OSA. He is also an Honorary Doctor of Francisk Skorina Gomel State University. == Education == Sergei Tretyakov has received the Engineer's degree and the Candidate of Sciences (PhD) degree in radiophysics from the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute, USSR in 1980 and 1987, respectively. In 1994 he was granted a Docent Diploma by the Ministry of Education of Russian Federation and in the following year he received Doctor of Sciences degree from St. Petersburg State Technical University, Russia. Tretyakov obtained his Full Professor Diploma in 1997 granted by the Ministry of Education, Russia. ==Career== Professional career of Sergei Tretyakov started in 1980 at Radiophysics Department of Leningrad Polytechnic Institute, where he had been an engineer and junior researcher until 1986. In 1986 he was promoted to the position of assistant professor and in 1989 to the position of associate professor. In October 1988, Tretyakov had a 10-months-long research visit to Helsinki University of Technology (from 2010, Aalto University) according to the exchange program between the Ministries of Education in Finland and Soviet Union. During following 8 years, Tretyakov was affiliated with both Electromagnetics Laboratory of Helsinki University of Technology where he worked with Ismo Lindell and Ari Sihvola and St. Petersburg State Technical University where he worked with Constantin Simovski. Tretyakov visited CEA Cesta (French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission research centre), also affiliated with the Laboratory of Wave-Material Interactions in University of Bordeaux, for 6 months in 1994 as a visiting scientist. In 1996, he was promoted to full professor position in St. Petersburg State Technical University, where he also became a director of Complex Media Electromagnetics Laboratory. From January 1999 until July 2000 Tretyakov was a visiting professor in Electromagnetics Laboratory of Helsinki University of Technology and in August 2000, he moved to the Helsinki University of Technology as a full professor of Radio Engineering. Later on, as a visiting professor, he visited the Abbe Center of Photonics in Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Germany during June – July 2013, and the Department of Photonics Engineering in Technical University of Denmark during January - April 2013. He educated 13 doctors of science. ==Research== Tretyakov has authored or co-authored more than 280 papers in refereed journals, 5 books, and 17 book chapters. Tretyakov's research career started with his diploma thesis under supervision of Prof. V.A. Rozov. The thesis was devoted to the problem of diffraction at an edge of dense planar arrays of metal wires, what is now referred as metasurfaces or two-dimensional metamaterials. During the doctoral studies, Tretyakov worked on ferrite-based anisotropic layered structures under supervision of Prof. M.I. Kontorovich. The first research visit to Helsinki University of Technology profoundly influenced his research interest, shifting it towards a novel and very promising direction of complex electromagnetic materials (now called metamaterials). From this time forth Tretyakov actively works in this research direction with the main contributions listed below. === Electromagnetics of chiral and general bianisotropic media=== Tretyakov made important contributions to research of bianisotropic media. Together with co- authors, he developed the general theory of electromagnetic waves interactions with bianisotropic materials and layers. Moreover, Tretyakov proposed and experimentally characterized first non-reciprocal bianisotropic scatterers of two types: so-called Tellegen scatterer (named after Bernard D. H. Tellegen who suggested gyrator as a circuit element with equivalent electromagnetic response) and artificial \\"moving\\" scatterer (a composite based on such scatterers emulate response of a truly moving medium). In 1997, Tretyakov and his colleagues demonstrated that chiral effects (optical rotation and circular dichroism) can be achieved even with an infinitely thin composite layer without broken mirror symmetry. This effect was subsequently named as planar chirality and independently discovered by the team of Nikolay I. Zheludev in 2003. ===Chiral nihility and negative refractive index === Possibility of existence of a backward wave medium, where electromagnetic waves propagate with anti-parallel phase and group velocities, was suggested by several scientists throughout the twentieth century: Arthur Schuster, Horace Lamb, Leonid Mandelstam, Victor Veselago, and others. However, due to the absence of materials with such properties in nature, wide interest to the backward wave media was generated only in the early 2000s, when the team of David R. Smith experimentally demonstrated first negative-index metamaterial. In 2003, Tretyakov and colleagues suggested an alternative way to achieve backward waves by using bianisotropic chiral materials. In this case, it is not required to engineer negative permittivity and permeability, instead, one should just ensure proper chiral response of the material. In the extreme case of so-called chiral nihility (when both relative permittivity and permeability are much smaller than the chirality parameter), two eigenwaves represent \\"forward\\" and \\"backward\\" circularly polarized waves with equal phase velocities. The existence of backward waves in chiral media was independently suggested by John Pendry in 2004. === Broadband cloaking of cylindrical objects === Inspired by the idea of transformation-optics based electromagnetic cloaking, Tretyakov's team developed an alternative realization of the same effect for cylindrical objects. In contrast to the previous designs, Tretyakov's cloaking device exhibits significantly increased bandwidth and lower amount of dissipation loss. Moreover, it does not require the use of exotic metamaterials with gradient permittivity and permeability, but, instead, is based on conducting plates with a simple geometry. === Strong spatial dispersion in wire media=== In 2003, Tretyakov's group demonstrated that a dense array of metal wires (wire medium), generally, exhibits strong nonlocal response (spatial dispersion), i.e. cannot be described by usual material parameters such as permittivity. The property of strong spatial dispersion enables the use of wire media for subwavelength imaging and transmission of images over long distances. === Superlensing === The concept of the superlens, introduced by John Pendry in 2000 as an extension of the work done by Victor Veselago, showed a theoretical possibility to achieve optical resolution well below the wavelength. In 2003, Stanislav Maslovski and Sergei Tretyakov showed that an alternative to Pendry’s device can be constructed using layers that impose the necessary boundary conditions at two parallel planes in free space. Later in 2004, Tretyakov with co-authors explored the necessary electromagnetic properties of the layers and confirmed the effect with experiments. === Constitutive parameters of metamaterials === By definition, metamaterials are realized as lattices whose periodicity is assumed to be much smaller than the wavelength. However, it is important that, though small, the periodicity is not negligible with respect to the wavelength. For this reason, if one formally introduces constitutive parameters for such regime, they will not be measurable response functions, and it will not be possible to use them for a sample of other dimensions or for a sample excited in another way. In other words, such formally introduced material parameters cannot satisfy the conditions of locality. In 2007, Tretyakov and colleagues explained the physical meaning of calculated material parameters, different from the meaning of the local constitutive parameters === High-impedance surfaces and metasurfaces === High Impedance Surfaces (HIS), also known as Artificial Magnetic Conductors (AMC), are artificial structures designed by applying special textures to a conducting surface. In a narrow band of frequencies, these structures have very high impendences which can be used as ground planes for novel low profile antennas and other electromagnetic structures. In 2008, Tretyakov and colleagues developed analytical formulas for the calculation of the grid impedance of electrically dense arrays of strips and square patches and their applications for HIS. Tretyakov also made an important contribution to clarify the role of spatial dispersion in the mushroom structure in 2009. This work demonstrated that, under some conditions, spatial dispersion is suppressed. More recently, he worked on modelling and applications of thin composite layers with engineered electromagnetic properties (metasurfaces), in particular, developing approaches to full control of reflected and transmitted waves. ==Awards and recognition== * Honorable Doctor, Francisk Skorina Gomel State University (Belarus) * President, European Virtual Institute for Artificial Electromagnetic Materials and Metamaterials (”Metamorphose VI”), International Association of European universities, 2007 – 2013 * General chair, International Congress Series on Advanced Electromagnetic Materials in Microwaves and Optics (Metamaterials), 2007-2013 * Founder and Chairman, St. Petersburg IEEE ED/MTT/AP Chapter, 1995-1998 * Deputy Member, URSI (International Union of Radio Science) Finnish National Committee, from 2006; Individual member of URSI since 2018 \\"Electromagnetics of bi-anisotropic materials: Theory and applications\\". * Coordinator, FP6 Network of Excellence Metamorphose, 2004-2008 * Fellow, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) * Fellow, the Electromagnetics Academy (USA) * Senior member, Optical Society of America (OSA) * Member, European Microwave Association * Member, Finnish Academy of Technical Sciences (Teknillisten Tieteiden Akatemia) * Member, Tenure-track Committee, Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, since 2011 * Member, Expert Advisory Group for Nanosciences, Nanotechnologies, Materials and New Production Technologies (European Commission, 7th Framework Programme), 2007 – 2011 * Member, European Microwave Conferences Management Committee, 2000-2002 * Steering Committee Member, European Doctoral Degree Programmes on Metamaterials EUPROMETA ==Important monographs== * \\"Analytical Modeling in Applied Electromagnetics\\" * \\"Electromagnetics of bi-anisotropic materials: Theory and applications\\" * \\"Modern Electromagnetic Scattering Theory with Applications\\" * \\"Electromagnetic waves in chiral and bi-isotropic media\\" ==References== Category:Metamaterials scientists Category:Living people Category:1956 births Category:People from Saint Petersburg Category:Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University alumni Category:Aalto University faculty Category:Russian scientists Category:Finnish scientists Category:Fellow Members of the IEEE Category:Finnish people of Russian descent Category:Naturalized citizens of Finland Category:Russian expatriates in Finland Category:Russian-speaking Finns ","title":"Sergei Tretyakov (scientist)"},{"id":"56747105","text":"The 2017–18 Texas A&M;–Corpus Christi Islanders women's basketball team represented Texas A&M; University–Corpus Christi in the 2017–18 NCAA Division I women's basketball season.

During the Hongzhi period (502-519) of Ming dynasty (1368-1644), a Buddhist temple was rebuilt by master Wu'ai (). During the Qianlong period of Qing dynasty (1644-1911), buildings and halls of Nantai Temple collapsed for neglect. In 1899, in the 25th year of Guangxu period, the reconstruction works started and lasted 5 years. In 1907, a Japanese Buddhist monk named donated 5,700 volumes of Buddhist scriptures and 32 palm leaf manuscripts to the temple. During the Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards had attacked the temple. 5,700 volumes of Buddhist scriptures and 32 palm leaf manuscripts were either removed, damaged or destroyed. Many original Buddha statues and musical instruments of the temple had been devastated. After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, according to the national policy of free religious belief, Nantai Temple was reconstructed and reopened. In 1981, a Thai Chinese couple Huang Zhangren () and Ouyang Yu () presented a gilt bronze Buddha statue to the temple.

Produced by Sternin and Fraser Ink and TriStar Television, the series features Drescher, Jacobson, Fraser, Sternin, Caryn Lucas and Diane Wilk as executive producers. Based on an idea inspired by Drescher's visit with a friend and The Sound of Music, the season revolves around Fran Fine, a Jewish woman from Flushing, Queens, New York, who is hired by a wealthy Broadway producer to be the nanny to his three children. Drescher stars as the titular character, Charles Shaughnessy as British-born producer Maxwell Sheffield, and the children – Maggie, Brighton and Grace – portrayed by Nicholle Tom, Benjamin Salisbury, and Madeline Zima.

They were designed for hauling passenger trains and were nicknamed \\"Mammoth\\". ==History== VE ordered six locomotives from the Cail rolling stock factory and they were delivered in 1860. They were numbered 37-42. In 1865 the locomotives passed to the Società per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia (SFAI), which renumbered them 703-708, and later (probably in 1869) 767-772. In 1885, at the creation of the great national networks, the locomotives passed to the Rete Mediterranea (RM) and took the numbers 3942-3947. In 1905, at the time of nationalization, only five units arrived at the FS, which registered them as Class 396 with numbers from 3961-3965. They remained in service until 1911. By then, they were obsolete and they were scrapped in 1912. ==Technical details== The locomotives were of simple design. The boiler pressure was 7 bar and they had two inside cylinders and Stephenson valve gear. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:0-6-0 locomotives 396 Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1860 Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Italy Category:Rete Mediterranea steam locomotives ","title":"FS Class 396"},{"id":"56747237","text":"Richard Lee \\"Rick\\" Simpson (born 5 July 1966) is a British Anglican priest.

She was born in St. Kilda, Melbourne, and has also lived in Western Australia and Queensland. Her paternal heritage is Scottish and Irish. Her maternal Aboriginal heritage is of the Trawlwoolway people of Tebrikunna, and her lineage has been traced to her ancestor, great-great-great-grandmother Dolly Dalrymple. == Education == In 1986, Gough completed a Bachelor of Arts (pre-history and anthropology) at the University of Western Australia, and in 1994, she completed a Bachelor of Fine Arts at the School of Art at Curtin University. In 1993, she moved from Perth to Tasmania to undertake her doctorate exploring her family history and heritage. Her thesis focused on reinterpreting the past via the artistic display of disparate objects which reframe narratives, completed at the University of Tasmania in 2001. ==Career== Gough's sculptural works have included the use of kitsch bric-a- brac sourced from op shops, often featuring racist or dated motifs. Using these relics in her art is about challenging and subverting their historical meanings. In 2001, her work, Driving Black Home (2000) contrasted with John Glover's colonial depiction of Tasmania, as part of the Australian Collection Focus series at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. The Gallery withheld Benjamin Law's busts of Woureddy and Trucaninny from the exhibition at Gough's request, noting their history as anthropological objects. In September 2001, she presented on the \\"Archaeology of nostalgia\\" at the Portraiture and Place symposium (jointly run by the National Portrait Gallery and the University of Tasmania). For the bicentenary of Federation, Gough was commissioned by the National Gallery of Victoria to create an artwork in response to Emanuel Phillips Fox's The Landing of Captain Cook. The resulting installation, Chase, a suspended ti-tree forest with symbolic red cloth, was reviewed by Gabriella Coslovich as sitting in an \\"...uneasy relationship...\\" in display alongside Fox's painting. Margaretta Pos reviewed the work as having stillness and menace, with a sense of \\"...redcoats in the shadows.\\" One of the Gallery's deputy art directors, Frances Lindsay, described the work as extending the narrative from the painting, to the unseen context of displacement of Aboriginal people. Gough's undertook a residency at Woolmers Estate in 2018, researching her familial connections to Norfolk Plains, Woolmers and Brickendon estates. A survey exhibition of her work entitled Tense Past: Julie Gough opened at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery in 2019. She worked as a curator of Indigenous art at the National Gallery of Victoria from 2003 until December 2004. She was a lecturer in visual arts at the James Cook University in 2005, and also has a part-time role at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery.

First invented by Wallace H. Coulter in 1953,W.H. Coulter, \\"Means for Counting Particles Suspended in a Fluid\\", United States Patent 2,656,508 the RPS technique is the basic principle behind the Coulter Principle, which is a trademark term. Resistive pulse sensing is also known as the electrical zone sensing technique, reflecting its fundamentally electrical nature, which distinguishes it from other particle sizing technologies such as the optically-based dynamic light scattering (DLS) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). An international standard has been developed for the use of the resistive pulse sensing technique by the International Organization for Standardization.International Organization for Standardization ISO 13319:2007, https://www.iso.org/standard/42354.html Fig. 1. Schematic diagram for resistive pulse sensing, in which particles, suspended in a weakly conducting fluid, flow through a nanoconstriction, and are sensed electrically by electrodes placed on either side of the nanoconstriction. Fig. 2. Line drawing of resistive pulse sensing time-based schematic data. A single particle passing through a constriction causes a momentary change in the electrical resistance, proportional to the particle volume. Construction and operation. The basic design principle underlying resistive pulse sensing is shown in Fig. 1. Individual particles, suspended in a conductive fluid, flow one-at-a-time through a constriction. The fluids most commonly used are water containing some amount of dissolved salts, sufficient to carry an electrical current. The salinity levels of seawater or of a wide range of concentrations of phosphate-buffered saline are easily sufficient for this purpose, with electrical conductivity in the mS-S range and salt concentrations of order 1 percent. Typical tap water often contains sufficient dissolved minerals to conduct sufficiently for this application as well. Electrical contact is made with the fluid using metal electrodes, in the best case using platinum or other low electrode potential metals, as are found in electrochemical cell constructions. Biasing the electrodes with an electrical potential of order 1 volt will cause an electrical current to flow through the fluid. If properly designed, the electrical resistance of the constriction will dominate in the total electrical resistance of the circuit. Particles that flow through the constriction while the electrical current is being monitored will cause an obscuration of that current, resulting in an increase in the voltage drop between the two electrodes. In other words, the particle causes a change in the electrical resistance of the constriction. The change in the electrical resistance as a particle passes through a constriction is shown schematically in Fig. 2. Theory of operation. The quantitative relationship between the measured change in electrical resistance and the size of the particle that caused that change was worked out by De Blois and Bean in 1970R.W. de Blois and C.P. Bean, \\"Counting and Sizing of Submicron Particles by the Resistive Pulse Technique\\", Rev. Sci. Instrum. 41, 909 (1970). De Blois and Bean found the very simple result that the resistance change \\\\Delta R is proportional to the ratio of particle volume V_p to the effective volume V_c of the constriction: \\\\Delta R = A \\\\frac{V_p}{V_c}, where A is a factor that depends on the detailed geometry of the constriction and the electrical conductivity of the working fluid. Hence, by monitoring the electrical resistance as indicated by changes in the voltage drop across the constriction, one can count particles, as each increase in resistance indicates passage of a particle through the constriction, and one can measure the size of that particle, as the magnitude of the resistance change during the particle passage is proportional to that particle's volume. As one can usually calculate the volumetric flow rate of fluid through the constriction, controlled externally by setting the pressure difference across the constriction, one can then calculate the concentration of particles. With a large enough number of particle transients to provide adequate statistical significance, the concentration as a function of particle size, also known as the concentration spectral density, with units of per volume fluid per volume particle, can be calculated. Minimum detectable size and dynamic range. Two important considerations when evaluating a resistive pulse sensing (RPS) instrument are the minimum detectable particle size and the dynamic range of the instrument. The minimum detectable size is determined by the volume V_c of the constriction, the voltage difference applied across that constriction, and the noise of the first-stage amplifier used to detect the particle signal. In other words, one must evaluate the minimum signal-to-noise of the system. The minimum particle size can be defined as the size of the particle that generates a signal whose magnitude is equal to the noise, integrated over the same frequency bandwidth as generated by the signal. The dynamic range of an RPS instrument is set at its upper end by the diameter of the constriction, as that is the maximum size particle that can pass through the constriction. One can also instead choose a somewhat smaller maximum, perhaps setting it to 70 percent of this maximum volume. The dynamic range is then equal to the ratio of the maximum particle size to the minimum detectable size. This ratio can be quoted either as the ratio of the maximum to minimum particle volume, or as the ratio of the maximum to minimum particle diameter (the cube of the first method). == Microfluidic Resistive Pulse Sensing (MRPS) == The original Coulter counter was originally designed using a special technology to fabricate small pores in glass volumes, but the expense and complexity of fabricating these elements means they become a semi-permanent part of the analytic RPS instrument. This also limited the minimum diameter constrictions that could be reliably fabricated, making the RPS technique challenging to use for particles below roughly 1 micron in diameter. There was therefore significant interest in applying the fabrication techniques developed for microfluidic circuits to RPS sensing. This translation of RPS technology to the microfluidic domain enables very small constrictions, well below effective diameters of 1 micron; this therefore extends the minimum detectable particle size to the deep sub-micron range. Using microfluidics technology also allows the use of inexpensive cast plastic or elastomer parts for defining the critical constriction component, which also become disposable. The use of a disposable element eliminates concerns about sample cross-contamination as well as obviating the need for time-consuming cleaning of the RPS instrument. Scientific advances demonstrating these capabilities have been published in the scientific literature, such as by Kasianowicz et al.,J.J. Kasianowicz et al.. \\"Characterization of individual polynucleotide molecules using a membrane channel\\", P. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93,13770–13773 (1996) Saleh and Sohn,O. Saleh and L.L. Sohn, \\"An artificial nanopore for molecular sensing\\", Nano Lett. 3, 37–38 (2003) and Fraikin et al.,.J.-L. Fraikin, T. Teesalu, C.M. McKenney, E. Ruoslahti and A.N. Cleland, \\"A high-throughput label-free nanoparticle analyzer,\\" Nature Nanotechnology 6, 308-313 (2011) These together illustrate a variety of methods to fabricate microfluidic or lab-on-a-chip versions of the Coulter counter technology. == References == Category:Microfluidics ","title":"Resistive pulse sensing"},{"id":"56747394","text":"Coat of arms of the Ceresara family.

The series was created by actress Fran Drescher and her-then husband Peter Marc Jacobson, and developed by Prudence Fraser and Robert Sternin. Produced by Sternin and Fraser Ink and TriStar Television, the series features Drescher, Jacobson, Fraser, Sternin, Caryn Lucas and Diane Wilk as executive producers. Based on an idea inspired by Drescher's visit with a friend and The Sound of Music, the season revolves around Fran Fine, a Jewish woman from Flushing, Queens, New York, who is hired by a wealthy Broadway producer to be the nanny to his three children. Drescher stars as the titular character, Charles Shaughnessy as British-born producer Maxwell Sheffield, and the children – Maggie, Brighton and Grace – portrayed by Nicholle Tom, Benjamin Salisbury, and Madeline Zima. The series also features Daniel Davis as Niles, the family butler, and Lauren Lane as C.C. Babcock, Maxwell's associate in his production company who is smitten with him. Several recurring characters also played a role in the sitcoms plotlines, many of whom were related to Fran. The opening sequence changed slightly in this season. Producer Kathy Landsburg was promoted to co-executive producer of the series as her producer credit was moved to the in-show credits, while the creator credits of Drescher and Jacobson, and the developer credits of Sternin and Fraser were added in its place.

His genealogy is Maol Mórdha son of Aodh son of Fearghal son of Seaán son of Cathal son of Eóghan na Fésóige.A Genealogical History of the O’Reillys by Eoghan O’Raghallaigh, Section 18, p. 89 Mulmore O'Reilly had four sons by his wife Honora- Émonn, Hugh O'Reilly (Archbishop of Armagh) (b. 1580, d. 1653), Fearghal and Domhnall. He also had an illegitimate son, Cathaoir. Mulmore died sometime between 1611 and 1637. He left his lands in Tawnagh to his son Émonn (Edmund) O'Reilly. Émonn had three sons, Aodh (Hugh), Cathal and Brian. An Inquisition held in Cavan Town on 12 September 1638 found that the said Edm’ Relly recently of Gortetowell in Co. Cavan, in his life, was seised of a poll of land called Tawnagh, and of a poll called Carrick in said county. The said Edmund died on 29 September 1637. Hugh O’Reyly, his son and heir has reached his maturity and now holds the land from the king in free and common socage. Catherine Newgent, alias Reily, was the wife of the said Edmund and the aforesaid Catherine is dower of the premises. At the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 Hugh O'Reilly still held the townland according to the Books of Survey and Distribution. Hugh O'Reilly had two sons, Émonn and Phillip. Hugh's son Émonn had one son Sémus. The aforesaid O’Reilly lands in Scrabby were confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652. In 1657 A list of the Papist Proprietors names in the County of Cavan, as they are returned in the Civill Surveys of the said County gave the names of 20 landowners whose property was confiscated in the barony of Tullyhaw. These included Hugh O'Rely whose lands were distributed as follows- In the Hearth Money Rolls compiled on 29 September 1663The Hearth Money Rolls for the Baronies of Tullyhunco and Tullyhaw, County Cavan, edited by Rev. Francis J. McKiernan, in Breifne Journal. Vol. I, No. 3 (1960), pp. 247-263 there were seven taxpayers in Gartetoill- Thomas Magawran of Gartetoill, John Graham of the same, Tirlagh McKelagher of the same, Hugh McBrien of the same, Owen McKelacher of the same, Edmond O Helicke of the same and Hugh McGawran of the same. The 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland as Skebby and Ranbeg and Gorteenboy with the proprietor as Lieutenant-Colonel Tristram Beresford and the tenants as William Chambers and others. A grant dated 3 November 1666 was made by King Charles II of England to the aforesaid Sir Tristram Beresford, 1st Baronet which included, inter alia, the lands of Scirbagh and Rendbegg. By grant dated 11 September 1670 from King Charles II of England to said Sir Tristram Beresford, the said lands of Scirbagh and Rendbegg were included in the creation of a new Manor of Beresford. Beresford then leased the land to John Graham who was in possession in 1676. In 1683 Robert Barry was the tenant. In 1696 Robert Saunders (Irish lawyer), one of the founders of the village of Swanlinbar, became the tenant. On 13 March 1706 Marcus Beresford, 1st Earl of Tyrone leased the lands of Scrabagh alias Sherefbagh to the said Robert Saunders, for a term of 99 years.. His son later sold his leasehold interest to Colonel John Enery of Bawnboy. Deeds, tenant lists etc. relating to Scrabby from 1650 onwards are available at- by searching for 'Derryvella'. The 1690 list of outlawed Irish Jacobites in County Cavan includes John Graham and Thomas Graham of Gortatole, gents.'Irish Jacobites' by J.G. Simms, in Analecta Hibernica, No. 22, 1960, p. 59. John Graham was probably the man named in the Hearth Money Rolls above or his son. The will of Philip Fitzpatrick of Gratetowel is dated 30 July 1735. The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as Skrebagh and Gortneyboy alias Rinbeg. A map of the townland drawn in 1813 is in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, depicts the townland as Scribogue or Scrabby.

In an interview, Choksi claimed that he is innocent and all allegations against him are false, baseless and motivated by political expediency. Choksi holds Antiguan citizenship, and is the owner of Gitanjali Group, a retail jewellery company with 4,000 stores in India. An arrest warrant for Choksi has been issued in connection with the alleged Punjab National Bank fraud case. He was allegedly involved in stock market manipulation in 2013. ==Early life== Mehul Choksi was born on 5 May 1959 in Bombay, the son of Chinubhai Choksi. He was educated at G. D. Modi College in Palanpur, Gujarat. His younger brother Chetan Chinubhai Choksi owned and operated a diamond company named Diminco NV, based in Antwerp, which had defaulted on a US$25.8 million payment to a subsidiary of ICICI Bank. In 2013, the bank litigated a lawsuit against Diminco NV, in commercial courts in Belgium and UK. ==Career== Choksi started his career in the gem and jewellery sector in 1975, and took over the leadership of Gitanjali Gems from his father in 1985, when it was focused on just rough and polished diamonds. Choksi owns Gitanjali Group, which includes Gitanjali Gems. Choksi is the maternal uncle of billionaire Nirav Modi. ==Large-scale fraud== In March 2018, a special PMLA court issued non-bailable arrest warrants (NBWs) against Choksi, and his nephews Nirav Modi and Neeshal Deepak Modi, owner of Firestar Diamonds. They are suspected of colluding with two employees of Punjab National Bank (PNB), the country's second-largest state-owned lender, in an alleged $1.8 billion fraud. At least six PNB staff and at least six employees of Choksi and Modi have been arrested so far. Choksi is a fugitive of Indian government. Choksi has protested his innocence in an open letter. On 6 March 2018, the CBI detained Vipul Chitalia, the Vice-President of Gitanjali Group of Companies and a key aide of Choksi. Chitalia was arrested at Mumbai airport and will remain in custody till March 2018. A designated PMLA authority held that 41 properties worth about Rs 1,210 crore, attached by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the name of Mehul Choksi and his associated firms, are money laundering assets and ordered that their attachment should continue. The central probe agency provisionally attached 15 flats and 17 office premises in Mumbai, a mall in Kolkata, a four-acre farm house in Alibaug and 231 acres of land at locations like Nashik, Nagpur, Panvel in Maharashtra and Villupuram in Tamil Nadu, in February 2018 under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in connection with the about US$2 billion alleged fraud at a Mumbai- based branch of the Punjab National Bank (PNB). On Monday, 17 June, told the Bombay High Court that he left India for medical check-up and not to avoid prosecution in the case. Choksi is currently based in the Caribbean nation of Antigua. ==Personal life== He has three children, including a son Rohan, and two daughters, Maitreyi and Priyanka, who married Akash Mehta, an Antwerp- based diamond merchant in December 2010. ==See also== * List of fugitives from justice who disappeared ==References== Category:Living people Category:Businesspeople from Mumbai Category:1959 births Category:Gujarati people Category:Fugitives wanted by India Category:Indian fraudsters ","title":"Mehul Choksi"},{"id":"56747629","text":"Jamboree was a British children's television programme that aired on CITV from 1998 until 2001.

Born with a misshapen right eye, Santos could see through his left eye without problem until an accident in 1981 led to it being struck by a golf ball. He lost the eye and had to rely on his near-sighted right eye with a contact lens. After the accident it was his brother who gave him the motivation to ski. Santos competed in the B2 events at Innsbruck in the 1984 Winter Paralympics but failed to win a medal. He was listed as a competitor for the Men's Downhill B3 in the 1988 Winter Paralympics but was unable to start. His real Paralympic successes came in Albertville in 1992 when he won gold in the Men's Giant Slalom B3 and Men's Super-G B3, the only B3 events that took place in alpine skiing. He returned two years later to the 1994 Games in Lillehammer, winning all four events in the expanded B3 program: Giant Slalom, Super-G, Slalom, and Downhill. In 1995, Skiing magazine described him as \\"the dominant blind skier in the world\\".

It was written by Ryota Furusawa and directed by Junichi Ishikawa. Legal High was a courtroom drama with comedic leanings featuring two main characters: Kensuke Komikado (Masato Sakai), a shrewd lawyer who has never lost a lawsuit, and Machiko Mayuzumi (Yui Aragaki), an up-and-coming lawyer with a strong sense of justice. Legal High also starred Kotaro Satomi, Junnosuke Taguchi, Eiko Koike, Katsuhisa Namase, Masaki Okada, Haru Kuroki, Ryōko Hirosue, and Masato Yano. ==SeasonsSynopsisSeason 1=== Machiko Mayuzumi (Yui Aragaki) is a bright up-and-coming lawyer who has a strong sense of justice and is passionate about protecting the meek. She starts her career defending a man who is charged with suspected murder and is being put under duress to confess to the crime. During the case, however, her boss Miki insists that Mayuzumi gets the suspect cleared of the charges, but Mayuzumi is unable to do so. However, Miki's secretary Kimie Sawachi informs Mayuzumi that there is a lawyer who has won every case so far in his career who could possibly help. With the will to succeed, Mayuzumi goes on a hunt to find the man. He is eventually found by Mayuzumi and is revealed to be Kensuke Komikado (Masato Sakai), a shallow man whose only desires are money, women and prestige. Despite all of his flaws, Mayuzumi is determined to win the case and asks Komikado if he can assist her in representing the defendant. ===Season 2=== Haruki Hanyu (Masaki Okada) worked as a prosecutor for Kensuke Komikado until he left and created his own law firm named Nexus which, coincidentally, is around the same time that Komikado (Masato Sakai) created his own law firm. Throughout the course of Season 2, the two rival law firms meet on opposite sides of the courtroom on numerous occasions. ==CastMain=== *Kensuke Komikado (Masato Sakai, child: Yuji Sakaguchi) is a lawyer from Kagoshima Prefecture who gathers powerful testimonies and creates strong arguments, making it difficult for his rivals to refute his logic or counter his arguments. He passed the bar exam despite graduating from a third-rate university. His father (a famous prosecutor in local Kagoshima) had disowned him as a son because of the dishonour of him attending such a lowly educational institute. Komikado loves wine and cigars. Komikado's credo is: there is no value in suspects' justice and human rights, nor warmth and reconciliation. The main point of a law case for him is to win. *Machiko Mayuzumi (Yui Aragaki, child: Hatakeyama Tsumugi) is a lawyer who is, according to Komikado Machiko, an \\"asadora\\" heroine with her attitude on justice and work ethics. She is from the Kanagawa Prefecture and the eldest daughter of a salaryman. She attended the Osaka Shoin Women's University attached elementary and junior high schools, graduated from a municipal co- educational high school, and gained her degree from the Waseda University Faculty of Law. She had left Miki Law Firm to transfer to Komikado Law Firm to learn the skills of Kensuke Komikado. She is Komikado's foil. ===Recurring=== *Kaga Ranmaru (Junnosuke Taguchi) works as a spy for Komikado, conducting illegal actions which include trespassing and infiltration. *Hattori (Kotaro Satomi) is the clerk of Komikado Law Firm. He is a man in his 60s, and seems to have knowledge of everything from martial arts to makeup. He is also a skilled chef. *Choichiro Miki (Katsuhisa Namase) is the former boss of Mayuzumi and the head of Miki Law Firm. He is the mortal enemy of Kensuke Komikado. *Kimie Sawachi (Eiko Koike) is the extremely intelligent secretary of Miki.

The sub-divisions of the townland are Cahran (Caothran = The Rowan Tree); Black Park; Pulbraddagh (Poll Braddach = Dangerous Quagmire). ==History== In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land.

The Studiolo was moved between 1519 and 1522 to the castello di San Giorgio. ==HistoryBeginnings=== Born in Ferrara and educated by some of the most notable humanists of the era, the sixteen-year-old Isabella arrived in Mantua on 12 February 1490 to marry Francesco II Gonzaga. She was given apartments on the main floor of the castello di San Giorgio, close to the Camera degli Sposi. Shortly after her arrival she selected two rooms in these apartments for private use. Badly-lit and with no fireplaces, these two rooms were in the San Niccolò tower - the upper one became her \\"studiolo\\" and beneath it her barrel- vaulted \\"grotta\\", accessed via a staircase and doorway decorated in marble. She was probably inspired by the Studiolo of the Palazzo Belfiore, designed for her uncle Leonello d'Este, and those in Urbino and Gubbio, both of which she could have got to know via her sister-in-law and close friend Elisabetta Gonzaga, wife of Guidobaldo da Montefeltro. Isabella used the studiolo for leisure pursuits, writing, study and correspondence as well as for displaying the highlights of her collections, initially only archaeological items but latter moving to contrast modern artworks with ancient ones. She loved music, poetry and art and was nicknamed the \\"tenth Muse\\". There were also several images of the muses in Mantegna's paintings for the studiolo and on the doorway into the grotta, which contained her antiquities. From 1492 she commissioned a series of allegorical, mythological and literary paintings for the studiolo from the most notable painters of the era, along with others praising the Este and Gonzaga families. She began in 1497 with Mantegna's 1497 Parnassus, followed in 1499-1502 by his Triumph of the Virtues. He also painted two trompe l'oeil bronze reliefs for the scheme, recorded in 1542 but now lost. Next came works by other artists such as Perugino's The Battle Between Love and Chastity (a literary subject) and Lorenzo Costa's Allegory of Isabella d'Este's Coronation and Reign of Comus. Comus was produced from an incomplete drawing left by Mantegna, who had died in 1506. Suggestions for the subjects came from her advisors, especially Paride da Ceresara. Her plan was to make the painters compete on identically-sized canvases, all with the same light source of the room's natural light and with foreground figures of the same size. Much correspondence between Isabella and Perugino survives, showing the difficult working process. He produced his work in Florence, but Isabella dictated its every detail via a drawing and even in the contract commissioning the work. Perugino was allowed to omit minor details but was absolutely banned from adding figures of his own invention or changing the brief. She continually sent her agents to check on his progress and when Perugino include a nude Venus rather than the clothed one she had specified in the brief, they reported back to her and she protested to the artist. Even when the painting was delivered in 1505, she said she would rather have had it done in oils, despite having specified tempera in the brief to match with Mantegna's style. The payment for Perugino's painting was only 100 ducats. ==Paintings for the Studiolo== File:La_Parnasse,_by_Andrea_Mantegna,_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpgParnassus (1497) by Andrea Mantegna File:Minerve chassant les Vices du jardin des Vertus, Mantegna (Louvre INV 371) 02.jpgTriumph of the Virtues (1499-1502) by Andrea Mantegna File:Perugino, lotta tra amore e castità 1.jpgCombat of Love and Chastity (1503) by Perugino File:Allégorie de la cour d'Isabelle d'Este, Costa (Louvre INV 255) 01.jpgAllegory of Isabella d'Este's Coronation (1505-1506) by Mantegna File:Le Règne de Comus, Costa (Louvre INV 256) 02.jpgThe Reign of Comus (1506-1511) by Lorenzo Costa. Many of the artists were working in other cities and sending their work to Mantua and so the different systems of measurement across the Italian city states made it difficult to make this plan work. At least once Isabella wrongly stated the light direction to the artists working for her and she often sent changed her mind about the subjects and compositions. Not all the artists were familiar with the mythological and allegorical themes she commissioned and many were put off by the work being shown alongside that of Mantegna, who began the series of paintings - for example, Giovanni Bellini was asked to produce a work and left free to choose his own subject, but he eventually declined the commission as he was not used to working to such a detailed brief. Isabella also tried and failed to commission paintings from Giorgione (who died too soon to accept her offer) and Leonardo da Vinci (despite repeated requests). Botticelli was available but on the advice of Gian Cristoforo Romano and Lorenzo da Pavia Isabella refused him in favour of Perugino. The two rooms became a must-see for dignitaries visiting the city, although many of the objects shown there were small and at risk of theft - after Charles III of Bourbon-Montpensier's entourage visited in 1509 it was found that some of the silverware had gone missing. === Second phase === Minerva, Giovanni Cristoforo Romano, detail from the studiolo of Isabella d'Este.

Appartamento di Isabella d'Este in Corte Vecchia. She dismantled the studiolo and moved it to these new rooms, which also included a \\"Nuova Grotta\\" or 'new Grotto', directly linked to the new studiolo. The rooms also included a 'secret garden', completed in 1522 and decorated with Ionic columns. The studiolo was paved with polychrome tiles from the workshop of Antonio Fedeli of Pesaro, originally bought by Francesco II Gonzaga for his residence at Marmirolo - once he had used those he needed, he sold the surplus to his wife to help her keep down the mice in her apartments. She had the sculptor Tullio Lombardo create her a new marble doorway from the studiolo to the grotto between 1522 and 1524. She also commissioned a new doorway for the entrance to the Studiolo from Gian Cristoforo Romano, with four bas reliefs, tondoes and multicoloured marble. Stefano L'Occaso, Il Palazzo Ducale di Mantova, p.128, Milano, 2002. The grotto itself contained wood-inlay panels from the earlier studiolo, produced in 1506 by Paolo and Antonio della Mola Stefano L'Occaso, Il Palazzo Ducale di Mantova, p.128-130, Milano, 2002.. In 1531 she added Allegory of Virtue and Allegory of Vice, both by Correggio, to the paintings in her studiolo. A 1542 inventory survives, giving some idea of how the paintings and objects were finally displayed on principals of harmony and symmetry but in a very high-density arrangement. File:Correggio_-_Allegory_of_Virtues_- _WGA05338.jpg \\"Allegory of Virtues\\" File:Correggio_-_Allegory_of_Vices_- _WGA05339.jpg\\"Allegory of Vice\\" === Dispersal === After Isabella's death the studiolo fell into disuse and in 1605 its paintings were moved to another part of the palace. Around 1627 Charles I of Nevers gave them to cardinal Richelieu, who took them to Paris and added them to Louis XIV's collection. After the French Revolution they thus entered the collection of the Louvre Museum. The other furnishings were sold off and are now split between several different museums. The pavement tiles were lifted and sold off separately and are now in several Italian and foreign museums, including the applied art collections at the Castello SforzescoImages here, here, here and here, the Louvre, the Museo Bardini in FlorenceImage here. and the Victoria and Albert Museum in LondonImages here, here and here. == Collections  Sculpture === She had a great passion for collecting ancient sculpture, limited only by her lack of money and the papal ban on exporting such sculptures from Rome. However, thanks to help from the knight of Malta Fra Sabba da Castiglione, she was able to acquire original ancient Greek sculptures from Nasso and Rodi and fragments of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus. A sarcophagus relief showing Hermes looking for Proserpina in Hades was built into the wall under the window of the studiolo. She paid art agents in the main Italian cities through whom she heard of opportunities for improving her collection. One of these was the sale of Michele Vianello's collections in Venice in 1506, at which she bought a late-antique onyx vase. She also acquired some alabaster heads looted from the palazzo Bentivoglio in Bologna, despite knowing their provenance. She forced Mantegna to sell her an ancient Roman bust of a woman in 1498 since it was said to resemble her and later, when he was old and sick, forced him to give her his favourite bust of Faustina the Elder in return for paying off his debts. When she heard that Gian Galeazzo Sforza was about to die and had left her part of his collection, she sent emissaries to Milan even before his death to safeguard the relevant artworks. Cameo, Ptolemaic, 3rd century BC, from Isabella d'Este's collection, now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum. Her modern artworks included Michelangelo's Cupid, of which she was particularly fond. It had been suggested to her as a possible purchase in 1496 - she initially declined it as only an imitation of an ancient work of art, but on learning it was by Michelangelo keenly sought to acquire it. It was then owned by the Montefeltro family of Urbino, but when Cesare Borgia overthrow them she acquired it from him. When the Montefeltro family was restored to power she refused to return it to them, despite being related to them. It was displayed beside an ancient sculpture of Cupid attributed to Praxiteles, inviting comparisons between modern and ancient sculpture. She acquired small bronzes by Pier Jacopo Alari Bonacolsi reproducing some of the famous statues of antiquity - one of these, Hercules and Antaeus, is now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. Her ancient sculptures also included busts, agate and jasper vases and bas reliefs. ===Other=== Isabella's collection also included medals, cameos (such as the noted Gonzaga Cameo), gems, classical coins, wooden-inlay panels and curiosities such as gilded cages, clocks and a 'unicorn's horn'. It also included objects she kept for sentimental reasons, such as a beechwood cabinet made by her brother Alfonso II d'Este in his spare time. == References  Bibliography (in Italian) == * Mauro Lucco (a cura di), Mantegna a Mantova 1460-1506, catalogo della mostra, Skira Milano, 2006 * Alberta De Nicolò Salmazo, Mantegna, Electa, Milano 1997. * Andrea Ciaroni, Maioliche del Quattrocento a Pesaro, frammenti di storia dell'arte ceramica dalla bottega dei Fedeli, CentroDi, Firenze 2004. * Stefano L'Occaso, Il Palazzo Ducale di Mantova, Milano, 2002. == External links == * * Category:Buildings and structures in Mantua Category:House of Este * Category:Gonzaga residences ","title":"Studiolo of Isabella d'Este"},{"id":"56747983","text":"The 2018 Uzbekistan Cup was the 26th season of the annual Uzbekistan Cup, the knockout football cup competition of Uzbekistan.

Ludovico III Gonzaga gave over his rooms in the \\"Corte Vecchi\\" to pope Pius II for the Council of Mantua in 1459 - that year, he commissioned Luca Fancelli to rebuild the castle as a palazzo rather than as a defensible castle. He also commissioned the frescoes of the castle's Camera degli Sposi. In 1490 the castle became the site of the studiolo of Isabella d'Este, remaining there until she moved it to the \\"Corte Vecchi\\" in 1519-1522. In 1496 the condottiero Paolo Vitelli was captured by Francesco II and imprisoned in the castle.

It was created in the 1960s, its main creators were Mieczysław Moczar and General Grzegorz Korczyński. The name comes from the Nazi occupation history of Moczar and Korczyński, when they commanded partisan troops and refers to the veteran ethos. == Establishment of the fraction == Mieczysław Moczar, as Deputy Minister and then Minister of the Interior, brought together a group of middle- and lower-tier state and party activists as well as former soldiers of the People's Army. Moczar and Korczyński also started to bring together young activists, mainly nationalist-oriented, deprived of opportunities for promotion as a result of blocking positions by the older generation. Those who did not participate in the fight against the German occupying forces due to their young age were called \\"patriots\\". Moczar also used the Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy to pursue his own goals, of which he was president since September 1964. Over time they gained support of members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Zenon Kliszka and Ryszard Strzelecki. Grzegorz Korczyński, Franciszek Szlachcic, Teodor Kufel, Jan Czapla, Mieczysław Róg-Świostek, Tadeusz Pietrzak, Colonel Marian Janic and others were associated with the fraction of partisans. At some point, the faction was also supported by then chief of the General Staff of the Polish Army, General Wojciech Jaruzelski. == Ideology == The \\"Partisans\\" preached a specific veteran ethos with elements of extreme nationalism (chauvinism). This chauvinism was directed mainly against Germans, Ukrainians, then also against Jews, following the course of the \\"natolinians\\", who were attributed a decisive role in Stalinist repression in Poland. In a more secretive manner they also directed their hostility towards the Soviets, opposing the communist partisan fighters to those who came to Poland with the Soviet army (in \\"greatcoats\\"). The faction presented itself as Communist nationalists. The basis for the ideology of \\"partisans\\" was provided by numerous publications concerning the fights conducted by communist partisans, especially \\"Barwy Walki\\" by Moczar himself. == Goals of the fraction == Officially, \\"partisans\\" proclaimed loyalty to Władysław Gomułka, while in unofficial contacts suggested replacing him with someone more energetic and younger. In fact, the objective pursued was to increase influence in the Polish United Workers' Party, which was combined with the desire to remove the older generation of activists, often of Jewish origin, from their positions. For this purpose, anti-Semitism and postulates of fight against cosmopolitanism, contrasted with patriotism, were used. The support from people of Jewish origin for Israel during the Six-Day War in 1967 and the participation of children of some opposition activists in the student protests were exaggerated to this end. The actions of the \\"partisans\\" were directed mainly against the remains of the \\"Puławianie\\" group. It is not entirely clear whether the \\"partisans\\" were planning to overthrow Gomułka or whether they wanted to secure Moczar's position as a second person in the party. The climax of the role of \\"partisans\\" was constituted by anti-Semitic purges in the party and state institutions after March 1968. == References == Category:Polish United Workers' Party ","title":"Partisans (PUWP fraction)"},{"id":"56748070","text":"Fodina stola is a moth of the family Noctuidae first described by Achille Guenée in 1852.

His father was arrested by the Soviet state in 1938 and executed. This would cause some difficulty for Nesis as he was the son of a person who had been executed as an enemy of the state. He initially wanted to study astronomy and he won an All-Union Competition in astronomy for schoolchildren but this career was not open to the son of an \\"enemy of the nation\\". He decided instead to become a marine biologist and in 1951 he enrolled in a course at the Moscow Technical Institute for Fisheries and Fishery Management in the Department of Hydrobiology, as this was not among the top ranked Soviet institutions his father's status did not bar him from entry. ==Career== After graduation Nesis was secured an appointment as a Junior Researcher at the Laboratory of Marine Biology in the Polar Research Institute of Marine Fisheries and Oceanography in Murmansk. His first spell at the Laboratory lasted from 1956 to 1960 and he returned from 1963-1966. He eventually became the Chief of the Laboratory and carried our research on the benthic fauna of the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans, especially the taxonomy and ecology of various groups of these animals. Between these tow periods in Murmansk Nesis enrolled at the Zoological Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences in Leningrad. Here he completed his Ph.D. and his thesis was called “The Bottom Fauna of Commercial Fishery Areas of the North Atlantic and the Atlantic sector of the Arctic as an Indicator of Productivity and Water Regime”. In 1966 he returned to Moscow where h briefly held a position with the Scientific Council on Hydrobiology and Ichthyology before moving to the P.P. Shirshov Institute of Oceanology of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Nesis worked here for the rest of his life in the Department of Nekton first as the Senior Scientist, then as the Principal Scientist and finally as the Leading Scientist. From the mid-1960s, the main focus of his research was on the taxonomy, zoogeography, ecology and evolution of cephalopods. In 1986, he was awarded a Doctor of Science degree for his book “Oceanic Cephalopods: Distribution, Ecology, and Evolution”. Nesis had come to be regarded as one of the world's foremost cephalopod workers by the mid 1970s and he was very prolific publishing around 460 scientific and popular publications and reviews, these included 6 books and 225 scientific papers on benthic ecology, cephalopod biology, marine zoogeography, ecology and evolutionary theory. He was the author of 43 papers about the ecology of bottom fauna. From this body of work some 274 publications, including all six of his books, 142 scientific papers and 45 popular science articles, were about cephalopods. He described 29 new cephalopod taxa, which included one new family. Nesis was also a productive free-lance author, writing circa 125 popular articles on biology for Soviet and Russian popular scientific publications. As well as that, he was the leading writer of biology abstracts for the Soviet/Russian Abstracts magazine of the Institute of Scientific Information writing at least 30,500 abstracts, averaging 70 a month. He also was Editor-in-Chief of Ruthenica, the Russian Malacological Journal that he helped found and he sat on the editorial boards of several other scientific journals. He was also an enthusiastic field biologist and he participated in over 30 research expeditions, both close to home in Russian waters and further afield in oceans around the world. Nearly 10 years of his life was spent at sea on expeditions, during which he collected and studied cephalopods and other animals as well as formulating new ideas. After each expedition he wrote an important contribution which advanced basic knowledge on the biology, taxonomy and faunal diversity of cephalopods of area studied during that voyage. The immense personal knowledge, his study of the many specimens collected on expeditions from around the world, and an extensive database of cephalopod literature enabled Nesis to write the world's first identification guide to the cephalopods. This book was first published in Russian in 1982 and was subsequently translated into English in 1987, was one of his principal accomplishments. He also authored a field guide to cephalopod larvae that covered 182 species. He was able to put his accumulated knowledge and experience into “Oceanic Cephalopods: Distribution, Life Forms and Evolution” which was published in 1985. This work in conjunction with his identification guides are still some of the main reference sources on the biology and identification of cephalopods. He died suddenly in Moscow on 8 January 2003 on his way home from work.

The schoolroom to the rear was built in 1864, while the church was re-pewed and re-lighted at the same time. The chapel suffered extensive damage in 1889 after a fire ignited due to a defect in the building's heating apparatus. Further expansion of the church was seen in 1928 when the two adjoining houses were purchased, demolished and replaced with a brick building. The church stored Weymouth's archives during World War II. ==References * Weymouth Baptist Church website Category:Buildings and structures in Weymouth, Dorset Category:Churches in Dorset Category:Grade II listed churches in Dorset Category:1814 establishments in England Category:Baptist churches in England Category:Churches completed in 1814 ","title":"Weymouth Baptist Church"},{"id":"56748605","text":"A hose bridge can be used by tram operators to avoid delays by not being able to cross over fire hoses. == History, particularly in Chicago == Hose bridge for electric tram lines When until the end of the 19th century a fire occurred in the down town district of Chicago, near one of the loops of the Chicago Surface Lines, all the lines of the company using that loop were in danger of being tied up for a long period. Crossover switches were placed on the trunk lines before they came to the loops but this provision was inadequate for the large number of cars. The street car tracks were more often blockaded by the loose lines than from the burning building or any other cause.Hose bridges for Chicago fires. In: The Street Railway Review. Vol. 7, 1898, p.387. The hose bridge used by the North Chicago Street Railroad Company for the trolley tracks resembled the bridges which were in service in many other cities. It consisted of a oak plank on either side bound with strap iron. Four semi- circular holes were cut to accommodate four lines of hose. Tie rods were spaced at intervals to hold the bridge to the proper gauge. The bridge was about over all and the inclines are such as to permit the cars to pass over it easily. Hose bridge in Chicago It has been a much more difficult problem to design a suitable bridge for the cable tracks. One, which has been perfected by Superintendent F. L. Fuller in 1898, used two tripods. The legs of the tripods were in length and consisted of tubing, into the interior of which was driven a wooden pole. The bridge proper was divided into two parts each . long. The floor was of plank and the rest of the bridge was constructed of light angle iron. The two halves fitted together and were held in place by two long pins. The bridge ready to be sent to the fire was transported by a horse cart. As soon as it was taken to the scene of operation the two halves were laid across the tracks and pinned together. The lines of hose, any number less than nine, were placed in the bridge and a tripod set on each side of the tracks. A block and tackle was attached to an eye bolt in the apex of each tripod and the bridge with its load of hose was drawn up to the proper height. This whole operation could be performed by three men in less than eight minutes. The particular advantage of this bridge was that the lines of hose when filled with water could be lifted into place, which would have been a very difficult thing to do with almost any other form. Two of these bridges were kept in a barn at the rear of the general offices. In the office was located a city fire alarm, and as soon as the gong sounds the location of the fire was determined. If the fire was a serious one, the wrecking wagon was sent to the barn and the bridges, which were suspended overhead, were let down into the wagon and quickly dispatched to the proper point. Although designed especially for cable cars the trolley cars passed under it by drawing down the trolley pole. As one fire was liable to blockade nearly all the cars of a system this bridge was estimated to save its cost many times over during one emergency. == See also == * Definition of hose bridge at Glossary of firefighting equipment == References == Category:Hoses Category:Tram transport ","title":"Hose bridge"},{"id":"56748610","text":"Gobio acutipinnatus is a species of gudgeon, a small freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae.

Svendsen directed the interactive performance, World Factory at the Young Vic in 2015. From July 2016 to June 2017, she was part of the Future Scenarios networked residency programme- a project designed to imagine different futures under the auspices of climate change. From October 2017 to July 2018 Svendsen worked as an early career fellow at Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities (CRASSH), moving to Lent Term in 2018. In 2017, she was a resident at the Attenborough Centre of Creative Arts. She is an honorary research fellow at Birkbeck Centre for Contemporary Theatre. == Works  We know not what we may be === Svensden is currently working on an installation entitled WE KNOW NOT WHAT WE MAY BE which appeared at the Barbican in September 2018 as part of its Art of Change season. Over the last 2 years there has been a series of research in public conversations where Svendsen has interviewed a series of experts asking the questions: ‘What is the best possible economic structure for responding to climate change and what would it be like to live in this future system?’. The information and ideas gathered from these interviews formed part of the installation. WE KNOW NOT WHAT WE MAY BE was produced by Artsadmin. === World Factory === World Factory is an interdisciplinary, interactive performance created by Zoe Svendsen and Simon Daw. The project explored global consumerism using the premise of the textile industry to illustrate the complex problems created by consumer demand. As part of their research for the performance, Svendsen and Daw travelled to China and commissioned the production of a shirt. They also interviewed Chinese factory workers whose testaments form part of the show. The show was first shown in 2015 at the Young Vic. It later toured in Brighton, Cambridge and Manchester. It formed part of the fabrications festival in 2017 at Brierfield Mills \\\\- produced by Artsadmin. === 3rd Ring out: rehearsing the future === This work was written and performed in 2010/2011 in several sites around the UK, including Edinburgh, Newcastle, Norwich, Ipswich and Greenwich.

The project has been funded by a recurrent financing campaign since September 7, 2016, and came in the wake of major scandals of misappropriation of public funds in Brazil, such as the Mensalão scandal and what was revealed in the Operation Car Wash investigations. The analysis began with data from the National Congress and then expanded to other types of budget and other instances of government, such as the Federal Senate. The project is built through collaboration on GitHub and using a public group with more than 600 participants on Telegram. The name \\"Serenata de Amor,\\" which means \\"serenade of love,\\" was taken from a popular cashew cream bonbon produced by Chocolates Garoto in Brazil. ==Modules== Throughout the development of the project new modules have been developed in addition to the main repository: * The main repository, serenata-de-amor, serves as the starting point for investigative work. * Rosie is the robot programmed to identify public funds expenses with discrepancies, starting with CEAP (Quota for Exercise of Parliamentary Activity); it analyzes each of the reimbursements requested by the deputies and senators, indicating the reasons that lead it to believe they are suspicious. * From Rosie was born whistleblower, which tweets under the name of @RosieDaSerenata, distributing the results found on social media. * Jarbas (Github repository) is a data visualization tool which shows a complete list of reimbursements made available by the Chamber of Deputies and mined by Rosie. * Toolbox is a Python installable package to support the development of Serenata de Amor and Rosie. Serenata de Amor ==History== Operation Serenata de Amor is an artificial intelligence project for the analysis of public expenditures. It was conceived in March 2016 by data scientist Irio Musskopf, sociologist Eduardo Cuducos and entrepreneur Felipe Cabral. The project was financed collectively in the Catarse platform, where it reached 131% of the collection goal paying 3 months of project development.Jovens criam robô que monitora despesas de deputados federaisSistema que fiscaliza gastos de deputados gera 680 denúncias na CâmaraJovens criaram bot capaz de monitorar despesas de deputados federaisRobô com nome de bombom promete recuperar R$ 1 bilhão por mês da corrupção Ana Schwendler, also a data scientist; Pedro Vilanova \\"Tonny\\", data journalist; Bruno Pazzim, software engineer; Filipe Linhares, a frontend engineer, Leandro Devegili, an entrepreneur and André Pinho took the first steps towards constructing the platform, such as collecting and structuring the first datasets. Jessica Temporal, data scientist and Yasodara Córdova \\"Yaso\\", researcher; Tatiana Balachova \\"Russa\\", UX designer; joined the project after the financing took place. The members created a recurring financing campaign, expanding the analysis of public spending to the Federal Senate. Donors make monthly payments ranging from 5 BRL to 200 BRL to maintain group activities. The monthly amount collected is around 10,000 BRL. ==Results== In January 2017, concluding the period financed by the initial campaign, the group carried out an investigation into the suspicious activities found by the data analysis system. 629 complaints were made to the Ombudsman's Office of the Chamber of Deputies, questioning expenses of 216 federal deputies. In addition, the Facebook project page has more than 25,000 followers, and users frequently cite the operation as a benchmark in transparency in the Brazilian government. One of the examples of results obtained by the operation is the case of the Deputy who had to return about 700 BRL to the House after his expenses were analyzed by the platform. The platform was able to analyze more than 3 million notes, raising about 8,000 suspected cases in public spending. The community that supports the work of the team benefits from open source repositories, with licenses open for the collaboration. So much so that the two main data scientists of the project presented it at the CivicTechFest in Taipei, obtaining several mentions even in the international press. The technical leader presented the project in Poland during DevConf2017 in Kraków. It was also presented in the Google News Lab in 2017. It was presented by Yaso, when she was the Director of the initiative, at the MIT Media Lab/Berkman Klein Center Initiative for Artificial Intelligence ethics, and at the Artificial Intelligence and Inclusion Symposium, an initiative of the Global Network of Internet & Society Centers (NoC). It was also presented both by Irio and Yaso at the Digital Harvard Kennedy School, over a lunch seminar, where the transparency of the platform and the main solutions found were discussed, so that the code and data are always available to verify its suitability. This infographic provides information about the first results of Operation Serenata de Amor, a project that analyzes open data on public spending to find discrepancies. The project was presented by Yaso to the House Audit and Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies in August 2017, and raised the interest of House officials who work with open data. The operation has been a source of inspiration for other civic projects that aim to work with similar goals. Participation of several team members in events throughout Brazil and abroad can be found on the Internet, such as presentation at OpenDataDay, held at Calango Hackerspace in the Federal District, Campus Party Bahia, Campus Party Brasilia, Friends of Tomorrow, XIII National Meeting of Internal Control, in the event USP Talks Hackfest against corruption in João Pessoa, the latter being also highlighted in the National Press. ==See also== * Internet activism * Open government ==References * Operation Serenata de Amor official website * Github repository Category:Technology in society Category:Artificial intelligence ","title":"Operation Serenata de Amor"},{"id":"56748873","text":"Vicimitra is a genus of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Mitroidea.MolluscaBase (2018).

The line started from the heart of the manufacturing center of Reading to the very pinnacle of Neversink. The physical conditions of the route proposed and demanded by travelers was enough to balk any one but a twentieth century engineer. For 12 miles the railway, by a series of curves and only one switch-back, in the path of the electric motor, followed a grade running from 3.4 to 6.4 per cent. After reaching the top the rail road wound its serpentine course down on the other side to Klapperthall Park, passing on its way numberless other pleasure resorts and picnic grounds, through the scenery effected by the valley of the Schuylkill River.Up a mountain on a wire.

The road began traffic during the summer of 1890; its equipment consisting of cars run by Edison No. 6, double reduction 15-horse- power street car motors. Since then, in view of the fact that the empty cars weigh 13 tons and often carry 100 passengers, all the new cars have two of the new 25-horse-power single reduction motors, which are giving excellent results. By 1891 there were in operation six long cars, each weighing about 13 tons. The cars used were of the Brill double truck pattern. Through the excellence of the motors and construction and the special oil boxes there was almost no noise. The power station was situated on the Schuylkill river, at the extreme end of the line. It consisted of two Edison 80-kilowatt generators, driven from counter shafting operated by two turbines. The weight of the cars, the type of rails, and character of the road bed, closely resembled a steam railway line, and indicated that the Edison General Electric Company did not intend to limit their operations to ordinary street car work, and encouraged the building of similar rail roads. == References == Category:Streetcars in Pennsylvania Category:Reading, Pennsylvania ","title":"Neversink Mountain Electric Railway"},{"id":"56749174","text":"Dominik Guláš (born 28 June 1999) is a Slovak footballer who plays for Nitra as a forward. ==Club careerFC Nitra=== Guláš made his professional debut for Nitra against AS Trenčín on 18 February 2018.

He played five seasons of college basketball for the Memorial Sea-Hawks of Atlantic University Sport (AUS) in Canada, winning conference honors each year. A 6-foot-9, 235-pound power forward and native of Kragujevac, Serbia, Curcic attended high school at First Kragujevac Gymnasium. Vasilije has one son born in 2018 named Nelson Vincent. == Early life == Curcic was born in the Serbian city of Kragujevac, where he attended First Kragujevac Gymnasium. In 2012, he took part in the postgraduate program at Luxembourg Basketball Academy (LBBA) for nine months. At LBBA, he helped draw attention from the Memorial University of Newfoundland, and on August 12, 2012, he committed to play with the Sea-Hawks under head coach Peter Benoite. == College career == As a first-year member of the Memorial Sea-Hawks, on February 2, 2013, Curcic was tabbed as athlete of the week by The Telegram after recording a total of 49 points, 15 rebounds, and six assists in two games against St. Francis Xavier. He was named to the Atlantic University Sport (AUS) All-Rookie Team. For his next two seasons, Curcic was named second-team and then first-team AUS All-Star. He earned second-team honors in the following year. In 2016–17, Curcic was sidelined for much of the season because of injury but finished with second-team AUS All-Star accolades. By the end of his college career, after leading Memorial in scoring for all five seasons, Curcic was considered one of the best players in program history. He left Memorial as its third all-time leading scorer. == Professional career == After graduating from Memorial, Curcic returned to Serbia to play professionally, but he was unable to find any satisfactory offers. On December 12, 2017, he signed with the St. John's Edge of the National Basketball League of Canada (NBLC). With the move, he reunited with Carl English, who he had trained with for several previous offseasons. On December 17, Curcic debuted for St. John's, with two points and one assist in nine minutes against the London Lightning. He recorded 11 points, seven rebounds, and two assists—all season-highs—in a win over the Niagara River Lions on January 21, 2018.

It is found in deep water at hydrothermal vents. ==Taxonomy== This species was collected by the marine biologist Craig McClain and first described by echinoderm specialist Christopher Mah in 2015, being named Paulasterias mcclaini in honour of its finder. Along with its sister species Paulasterias tyleri, also found at hydrothermal vents, it differed markedly from other known starfish species, so the new family Paulasteriidae in the superorder Forcipulatacea was created to accommodate the two species. They are the first starfish species known from hydrothermal vents. ==Description== P. mcclaini is a six-armed starfish with slender tapering arms. Larger specimens have a thick fleshy skin on the aboral (upper) surface, with spongy tissue underneath, which conceals the dermal plates. It is a pink starfish, covered with short spines. ==Distribution and habitat== This starfish was found as part of the assemblage of animals forming a community on the seabed at a deep sea hydrothermal vent in the Northeast Pacific off the coast of Washington and Oregon. It is found on rock, lava flows, mud and even clay. ==Ecology== Starfish are unable to cope with the hot, sulphurous, toxic environment of the hydrothermal vent itself but they are present in the cooler, cleaner water nearby. Hoff crabs live adjacent to the hydrothermal vent chimneys, with gastropod molluscs and then goose barnacles occupying zones further out. Beyond this is an assemblage dominated by sea anemones, and it is on these and on the goose barnacles that the starfish probably feed. ==References== Category:Asteroidea Category:Animals described in 2015 ","title":"Paulasterias mcclaini"},{"id":"56749632","text":"Harry Taylor (born 12 March 1924) was a British alpine skier.

Inspired by the real 1908 New York to Paris Race, which concluded shortly before its release, the film followed a group of racers through a hectic series of unlikely obstacles and adventures across North America, Russia, and Western Europe in a highly unreliable race car. Film scholars have noted parallels to earlier Méliès films, including The Impossible Voyage and An Adventurous Automobile Trip, and have commented on elements of racism in the scenario, but the film itself is currently presumed lost. ==Plot== In New York City, an automobile race to Paris is launched. A large crowd, including a Salvation Army brass band, sees off the six racecars, including a De Dion-Bouton driven by Georges Bourcier de Saint-Chaffray, a Motobloc, a steam automobile, and even a kitchen on wheels, where a black visitor is hurried out before the race begins. The cars speed over the precipices of the Rocky Mountains, where they navigate a rickety bridge over a torrent; though the De Dion-Bouton speeds easily over the bridge, it breaks under the weight of the next car, hurling it into the water. The other four cars, going too fast to be able to stop, follow it over the precipice. The De Dion-Bouton, now alone, continues its journey as far as the plains of California, where it suffers a breakdown just as it is being attacked by a group of Iroquois. The abducted travelers, about to be scalped, escape by getting their captors drunk on gasoline. They regain their car only to realize that, having used up their gasoline in the ruse, they cannot start the engine. Taking some feathered Iroquois headdresses to use as sails, they convert the automobile into a sail wagon and travel on the wind. The weather gets worse, and a cyclone carries the car into the sky. It flies over Canada and finally makes a crash landing on a frozen Alaska river. Finding a horse to pull the car, they reach a gold mining camp. In welcome, the miners take them on a tour of a glittering mine and give them two boxes of gold. The travelers set off again with sled dogs pulling their car. They make it as far as the Bering Strait before the dogs are tired out and can go no further. An ice avalanche sends the car into the sea, where a whale accidentally swallows it. The whale spits out the car on an ice field, where the travelers see a pack of polar bears approaching. Just when an attack seems imminent, it becomes clear that the bears come in peace, thinking the fur-covered travelers are bears as well. Humans and bears exchange hearty handshakes and conversation, until they notice that the airship Patrie is being blown toward them by the strong wind. The travelers make a dash for the airship, managing to fasten one of its guide ropes to the car. The airship carries the car to Siberia, where some poor serfs agree to pull the car over the ice. They pass through villages, where the travelers are greeted with welcome, vodka, and displays of ice skating. Reaching Germany, the travelers are still unable to make their car work, and call upon a caravan of Romani people to pull it onward for a while. At last, their car in shambles, carried along by a Paris coachman's nag, they reach the finish line at the Place de la Concorde, where the police chief Louis Lépine and the President of France have arrived to greet them. The travelers, distributing their souvenirs of the journey to the crowd, are carried in triumph through the streets of Paris. ==Production and release== The racers in the real 1908 race lining up in New York, with the De Dion-Bouton in front Throughout his film career, from 1898's Divers at Work on the Wreck of the \\"Maine\\" to 1912's The Conquest of the Pole, the pioneering filmmaker Georges Méliès drew freely on topical themes taken from current events; Mishaps of the New York–Paris Race is another example of this technique. The real-life 1908 New York to Paris Race, sponsored by Le Matin and The New York Times, set off on February 12, 1908. George Schuster was declared the winner on July 30 upon his arrival in Paris; Georges Bourcier de Saint-Chaffray, the racer sponsored by Jules-Albert de Dion of the De Dion-Bouton company, left the race in Siberia when de Dion decided to stop funding him. In addition to featuring Bourcier de Saint-Chaffray as the main character of the film, Méliès's scenario also namedrops the airship Patrie and, back in Paris, Louis Lépine, the Préfet de Police for the Paris Police Prefecture. One of Méliès's most successful films had been the 1905 comedy An Adventurous Automobile Trip. He returned to the theme of a madcap automobile journey with Mishaps of the New York–Paris Race. The plot of the film shows the influence of the earlier one, as well as of another successful Méliès film, The Impossible Voyage (1904). The film scholar Elizabeth Ezra, discussing the surviving scenario for the film, notes its racist overtones, citing the scene in which the kitchen-car is visited by a black man: \\"The very presence of an African is represented as one more 'mishap', a nuisance to be repelled\\". The real race used as Méliès's source returned to the screen in 1965, when it was adapted into the comedy The Great Race. The film was made mostly in Méliès's glass-roofed studios in Montreuil-sous-Bois; the second, tenth, and twenty-sixth scenes (titled \\"Les couriers,\\" \\"L'Alaska,\\" and \\"La place de la Concorde\\" in advertising material) were shot just outside, in the garden of Méliès's property. The film was released in July 1908 by Méliès's Star Film Company, and is numbered 1199–1217 in its catalogues. The film was advertised as being 380 meters long, which, at Méliès's preferred projection speed of 12 to 14 frames per second, is about 24 minutes. According to a 1912 film journal article, the film was included as an attraction in a 1908 Théâtre Marigny revue in Paris. Mishaps of the New York–Paris Race is currently presumed lost.Malthête & Mannoni 2008, p. 239. ==References * Category:Films directed by Georges Méliès Category:French films Category:French black-and-white films Category:French silent short films Category:1900s sports films Category:1908 short films Category:1908 films Category:French sports films ","title":"Mishaps of the New York–Paris Race"},{"id":"56749763","text":"Frankie Animal is an Estonian indie rock band formed in 2012. In the year of their foundation, Frankie Animal participated in the Estonian Youth Band (Noortebänd) competition, where they managed to win eight awards. In 2014 they released a debut EP Obsession, which peaked in digital streaming platforms. The band has performed at the Positivus Festival in Latvia, as well as in The Netherlands at Eurosonic Noorderslag. They were also the supporting act for Ewert and the Two Dragons during their 2015 tour in Germany. In April 2016 Frankie Animal released their first full-length album The Backbeat. Frankie Animal participated in Eesti Laul 2018 with their entry \\"(Can't Keep Calling) Misty\\". == Members == * Marie Vaigla (vocals, keyboard) * Jonas Kaarnamets (guitar) * Jan-Christopher Soovik (bass) == Musical career  2012-2014: Early years === The band gave its first public concert in the autumn of 2012. On October 25, they entered the Youth Band competition, where they reached the finals but were the runner-up in the end. Frankie Animal still managed to win eight special awards, including Raadio 2's, leading alternative radio in Estonia, favourite and audience’s favourite. In December 2013 they started recording their first EP Obsession, which was completed in collaboration with Ewert and The Two Dragons guitarist Erki Pärnoja. \\"There's both a rockier side and a softer, more melancholy side. Everything is balanced, the first half has more power and the other half is more peaceful with gloomy melodies,\\" explained Marie, the vocalist. In 2014 the band had their first big concert at the Positivus Festival in Latvia. They also performed at Intsikurmu, an Estonian music festival. Frankie Animal's first singles were \\"My Friend\\" and \\"Loveless man\\". === 2015: Eurosonic Noorderslag === 2015 was a significant year for the band as they had the opportunity to perform at the Dutch festival Eurosonic Noorderslag, which is known as a place to discover new artists. In addition, they took part in Ewert and The Two Dragons tour in Germany, where they were the supporting act at five concerts. It was a big stepping stone for them, as the band had always said how Ewert and the Two Dragons really inspired them to start a band themselves. ===2016: The Backbeat=== In April, Frankie Animal's first full-length album The Backbeat was released. Kaspar Viilup (Estonian Public Broadcasting) said: \\"Marie Vaigla's vocals are remarkably versatile, at one point as fragile as Karen O's solo projects and the next moment screaming-roaring as The Kills' lead vocalist Alison Mosshart. The guitar parts are also praiseworthy - Jonas Kaarnamets is one of the most talented Estonian guitarists of the new era. Their music really sounds unexpectedly big - even the ballads at the end of the album are bright and heart-wrenching rather than pretentious and cold. So there is definitely no lack of emotionality on this record - something that is a big exception in younger generation rock music, because the macho-posture and the \\"I'm-so-cool\\" image just obscure it. Frankie Animal has completely gotten rid of it.\\" === 2017-2018: Eesti Laul === In 2017 the band released three singles: \\"Nightlights\\", \\"Pretty Late\\" and \\"(Can't Keep Calling) Misty\\". With the latter, they took part in the Eesti Laul 2018 contest, where the winner represents Estonia in the Eurovision Song Contest. Frankie Animal placed seventh in the competition, but gained public recognition in the process. In May they collaborated with Jüri Pootsmann and released a single \\"Funny\\". === 2019-Present === In June 2019, Frankie Animal released a new single \\"Playful\\" under the label \\"Made in Baltics\\" (Sony Music), which became the most played song by Raadio 2 in July 2019. On 1 May 2020 they released a single \\"Restless\\". \\"It seems to me that with \\"Playful\\" and \\"Restless\\" we have found the direction we want to move musically with the whole album. Slightly pop, nostalgic and a reflection of us three. I feel that the connection between us is also getting stronger and that makes the music more complete,\\" says the band's guitarist Jonas Kaarnamets. == Discography  Studio albums === *The Backbeat (2016) === EPs === *Obsession (2014) === Singles === *My Friend (2014) *Loveless Man (2014) *The Backbeat (2016) *Nightlights (2017) *Pretty Late (2017) *(Can't keep calling) Misty (2017) *Funny (2018) *Playful (2019) *Restless (2020) == References  External links == * Official page: http://www.frankieanimal.com *Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/frankieanimal *SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/frankieanimal *YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/frankieanimal *Twitter: https://twitter.com/frankie_animal *Instagram: http://instagram.com/frankieanimal *iTunes: https://apple.co/2VXqwwX *Spotify: https://spoti.fi/2KxGOHF *Deezer: https://www.deezer.com/artist/5797840 *Shop: http://www.311.ee/frankie-animal Category:Estonian musical groups Category:musical groups established in 2012 Category:Eesti Laul contestants ","title":"Frankie Animal"},{"id":"56749775","text":"Pamela Rosenkranz (born 1979 in Uri, Switzerland) is a Swiss multimedia artist who uses light and liquid to demonstrate her concepts along with performance, sculpture, painting, and installation art. Her work explores ideas and concepts of what it means to be human, its ideologies, emptiness and meaninglessness, as well as globalization and consumerism. She is represented by Karma International, Zurich / Los Angeles; Miguel Abreu Gallery, New York; and Sprüth Magers Berlin, London and Los Angeles. == Education and Career == Rosenkranz graduated from the University of Zurich in 2005, and received her MFA from the Academy of Fine Arts, Bern, in 2010. In 2012, she completed an independent residency at the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam. Rosenkranz's aesthetic choices are often informed by her extensive research into fields ranging from marketing and medicine to philosophy and religion. Her use of use of glass, plastic water bottles, and liquid reflecting surfaces stems from her interest in physicality as evident in the 2015 exhibition Open Source: Art at the Eclipse of Capitalism. Shiny, reflective surfaces provide a way for Rosenkranz's work to establish physicality, and interact with their environments. The biological and medical implications of light are of importance to the artist, as light affects the human body. Water as a medium connotes purity and detoxification, however, more accurately the plastic bottles that deliver water harbor bacteria and colonies of hormones. Having collaborated with Robin Mackay and Reza Negarestani, Rosenkranz's work is often framed in relation to Speculative Realism. Her institutional solo exhibitions in Geneva, New York, and Braunschweig were covered in a 2012 monograph entitled No Core. == Exhibitions == While still a student at the Academy of Fine Arts, Bern, Rosenkranz participated in both the 5th Berlin Biennale and Manifesta 7, in Trentino, Italy. In 2010, the same year that she graduated with a master's degree, Rosenkranz exhibited solo at Centre d’Art Contemporain Geneve, and at Germany’s Kunstverein Braunschweig. Rosenkranz's first solo exhibition at Miguel Abreu Gallery in 2012, \\"Because They Try to Bore Holes,\\" collapsed art into its material elements. In 2015, Rosenkranz exhibited Open Source: Art at the Eclipse of Capitalism. Later that year, she represented Switzerland at the Venice Biennale with an immersive installation of immaterial elements titled Our Product. She exhibited Slight Agitation 2/4: Pamela Rosenkranz in 2017 at Fondazione Prada, Milan. In 2018, Rosenkranz debuted Amazon Spirits (Green Blood) at Karma International in Zurich to explore the intersection between the Amazonian rainforest and amazon.com, Inc. In her 2019 exhibition Evian Waters, Rosenkranz highlighted the chemical and natural components underlying notions of eternal youth and purity. == Bibliography == * * == References == Category:1979 births Category:Swiss women artists Category:Swiss installation artists Category:Women installation artists Category:Swiss contemporary artists Category:Living people Category:Women conceptual artists Category:20th-century Swiss artists Category:21st-century Swiss artists Category:21st-century women artists ","title":"Pamela Rosenkranz"},{"id":"56749787","text":"Guðmundur Guðmundsson (1 May 1920 - 9 January 2007) was an Icelandic alpine skier.

Angiotensin II is a naturally occurring hormone secreted as part of the renin-angiotensin system that results in powerful systemic vasoconstriction. The vasopressor effects of angiotensin have been studied since it was first isolated in the late 1930s. Vasopressors are defined as agents that combat vasodilatory shock by inducing peripheral vasoconstriction. Commonly used vasopressors include catecholamine (e.g., dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine) and non-catecholamine (e.g., vasopressin). but these agents are not always effective in reversing vasodilatory shock, and their use can be associated with significant side effects including limb ischemia and cardiac arrhythmia. Angiotensin II is as a treatment option that can increase blood pressure and allow catecholamine dose reductions. Angiotensin II must be administered as an intravenous infusion diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride prior to use. The recommended starting dosage of angiotensin II is 20 nanograms (ng)/kg/min via continuous intravenous infusion. Administration through a central venous line is recommended. Monitor blood pressure response and titrate angiotensin II every 5 minutes by increments of up to 15 ng/kg/min as needed to achieve or maintain target blood pressure. == Adverse effects == Angiotensin II treated patients are at an increased risk of thromboembolic events. There was a higher incidence of arterial and venous thrombotic and thromboembolic events in patients who received angiotensin II compared to placebo treated patients in the ATHOS-3 study [13% (21/163 patients) vs. 5% (8/158 patients)]. It is recommended that patients be on concurrent venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Other adverse reactions include thrombocytopenia, tachycardia, fungal infection, delirium, acidosis, hyperglycemia, and peripheral ischemia. Angiotensin II acts on Angiotensin receptor (AT1) on presynaptic adrenergic nerves → release of catecholamine → excessive catecholamine can be harmful as it can cause myocyte necrosis. ==Interactions== Angiotensin II receptor blockers, as their name implies, block the action of angiotensin II at its receptors and therefore may reduce its effects. ACE inhibitors, on the other hand, may increase its effects. on angiotensin II. == References  External links == * * Category:Antihypotensive agents ","title":"Angiotensin II (medication)"},{"id":"56749823","text":"Oluwatoyin Temitayo Ogundipe (born 31 May 1960) is a Nigerian academic, author and a Professor of botany.

The site contains remains of multiple humans who were buried in a freshwater pond 7,200 years ago. The pond, which was about above sea level at the time, was subsequently covered by the waters of the Gulf as sea levels rose. The site is about from the coast of Manasota Key, near Venice, Florida. The site was found in 2016 by a fossil hunter, who reported possible human remains. Archaeologists examined the site using non-intrusive methods, including magnetometry, sub-bottom profiling and side-scan sonar. The examination of the site revealed multiple burials in clusters. The burials were in what had been a layer of peat at the bottom of a freshwater pond. Wooden stakes were found associated with the burials. The peat had helped preserve the bones and the wooden stakes. Two of the stakes found at the site yielded radiocarbon dates of 7,200 years ago, early in the Archaic period in Florida. The burials at the Manasota Key Offshore site resemble those at the Windover Archeological Site, Little Salt Spring and other sites of the early Archaic period in Florida. The Manasota Key Offshore site is remarkable in its preservation even though it has been below sea level for close to 7,000 years. ==References== * * Category: Archaic period in North America Category: Archaeological sites in Florida Category:Underwater archaeological sites ","title":"Manasota Key Offshore"},{"id":"56749909","text":"The 1971 Scheldeprijs was the 58th edition of the Scheldeprijs cycle race and was held on 27 July 1971.

Launched in 1967, the vessel served in the anti-submarine role during the Cold War until 1992. The ship was then recommissioned as a testing platform for new weapons systems, including Aster, finally retiring in 2008. ==Design== The ships of the were authorised in the 1959/1960 Italian naval programme. The second ship in the class, Climene, was laid down in 1963 but was renamed Carabiniere in June 1965 prior to being launched in 1967. Carabiniere was the third vessel in Italian service to be so named. ===Armament=== As originally designed, Climene was to have armament based on the preceding . Optimised for anti-submarine warfare, the vessel was designed around a hangar for an Agusta-Bell AB.204 helicopter. Close-in anti-submarine defence was provided by six Mark 44 torpedoes launched from Mark 32 torpedo tubes complemented by a single-barrel Menon mortar mounted forward. An early drawing shows the hangar straddled by a pair of guns with a single gun mounted fore and aft to provide anti-aircraft defence. By 1962, the efficacy of the 40 mm was in doubt and the design was redrawn with three 76 mm guns, but even this was deemed insufficient. At launch, the vessel had no less than six single mounts. ===Propulsion=== The propulsion system used a combined diesel and gas (CODAG) system as first trialled on the destroyer San Giorgio. Two diesels and one gas turbine were allied per shaft with a hydraulic coupling to enable the vessel to either run on diesel power alone, at low speed, or diesels, at high speed, and gas turbines simultaneously. Two Tosi OTV-320 diesels were paired with each Tosi- Metrovick G.6 gas turbine to provide a maximum speed of on diesels alone and with all engines running. ==ServiceAnti-submarine frigate=== Carabiniere underway in the Mediterranean in 1979 Commissioned on 28 April 1968, Carabiniere served with the 1º Gruppo Navale d'Altura based at La Spezia. In 1973, when the school ship Amerigo Vespucci was inactive due to maintenance, Carabiniere was one of a number of Italian naval vessels used as a summer school cruise ship for students at the Italian Naval Academy. The vessel subsequently visited Istanbul, Odessa and Sevastopol alongside the destroyer . During the 1970s, the ship was updated. The helicopters were replaced by the more capable AB-212ASW and a SLQ-A ECM system was added. The ship was further upgraded in the 1980s. Hull-mounted sonar and the SLQ-747 ECM suite was fitted. ===Weapons testing ship=== On 1 April 1992, the ship was decommissioned and re-equipped as a testing platform for a new generation of Italian naval weapons such as Aster and MILAS. The gas turbine, Menon mortar, variable depth sonar and five 76 mm mounts, along with two fire control radars, were removed. Removing the gas turbines restricted the top speed to . Helicopter operating capability was also disabled. A SPY-702 search radar was installed along with Sylver missile launchers. The most obvious change was the installation of a large antenna midships for the EMPAR radar (also known as AN/SPY-790) which used the space previously occupied by the gas turbine exhaust. This combination of systems enabled Carabiniere to act as a testbed for PAAMS and SAAM-IT. Carabiniere re-entered service in 31 December 1994 as a dedicated test ship but retained the penant designation of a frigate. The vessel undertook successful live firing trials of both Aster 15 from Sylver A-43 launchers and Aster 30 from Sylver A-50 launchers. Carabiniere was finally decommissioned on 19 November 2008 in the presence of the Naval Chief of Staff Paolo La Rosa and Head of the Carabiniere Gianfrancesco Siazzu. ==References== Category:1967 ships Category:Alpino-class frigates Category:Ships built in Italy ","title":"Italian frigate Carabiniere (F 581)"},{"id":"56749926","text":"Ratna Bhagwandas Chawla is a politician of the Pakistan Peoples Party and the first Hindu woman elected to the Senate of Pakistan. == References == Category:Members of the Senate of Pakistan Category:Pakistani Hindus Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Pakistan Peoples Party politicians ","title":"Ratna Bhagwandas Chawla"},{"id":"56749931","text":"The Secretariat of Social Work of the Wife of the President of the Republic of Guatemala ( SOSEP) is the organisation in charge of promoting and implementing social programs that benefit children, families and the community in general.

Vance, a U.S. federal judge serving on the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. When Moody was executed by lethal injection in April 2018, he became the oldest death row inmate to be executed since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. == Background == Moody was born on March 24, 1935, in Rex, Georgia, and grew up in Fort Valley. He grew up as the oldest of three children and spent much of his time \\"tinkering with machinery\\". He graduated from Peach County High School in 1953, and held a multitude of military positions in the years to 1961. Following his departure from the military, Moody resumed his education. Taking classes at a small college, he considered becoming a neurosurgeon but he did not make good grades. He was later able to take some law school classes. After a psychiatric evaluation in 1967, he was characterized as harboring violent thoughts, and the doctor evaluating him, Thomas M. Hall, testified that he was constantly afraid that Moody might get into a situation that would end up in some sort of destruction toward society. On May 7, 1972, Moody's wife at the time, Hazel, opened a package she found in their kitchen. It turned out to be a homemade pipe bomb that exploded in front of her, tearing up her hand, thigh and shoulder, and sending scrap metal into her eye. She required six operations to deal with all of her injuries. Moody was tried for making the bomb with intent to send it to an auto dealer who had repossessed Moody's car, and on October 19, 1972, he was found not guilty of making the bomb, but was convicted of possessing it and sentenced to five years in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary. Moody and his wife were divorced shortly after his conviction. == Vance's murder and connected bombings == On December 16, 1989, federal judge Robert Vance was assassinated at his home in Mountain Brook, Alabama, when he opened a package containing a makeshift pipe bomb. Vance died instantly and his wife, Helen, was seriously injured. After an extensive investigation, Moody and his second wife, Susan McBride, were arrested on July 13, 1990. McBride was released on $250,000 bail within a week and later testified against Moody. Moody was charged with the murders of Judge Vance and of Robert E. Robinson, a black civil-rights attorney based in Savannah, Georgia, who had been killed in a separate explosion at his office two days later on Monday, December 18. Moody was also charged with mailing bombs that were defused at the Eleventh Circuit Court's headquarters in Atlanta and at the Jacksonville, Florida, office of Willye Dennis of the NAACP. It has been speculated that the bombings at the offices of both Robinson and the NAACP were meant to add a potential racial element to the killings to deflect attention away from Moody, who was described as being \\"anything but racist\\" by former associates and family members. Moody's killing of Vance and his attempted bombing of the Eleventh Circuit were motivated by the Court's refusal to expunge Moody's conviction for the 1972 explosion in his home, despite the fact that Vance was neither on the panel that made that decision, nor was he responsible for its decision. == Trial, death row, and execution == After an order was entered directing the recusal of all circuit and district judges within the Eleventh Circuit, Moody's trial for murder and related crimes was presided over by Judge Edward Devitt, of the District of Minnesota. After a successful prosecution by special prosecutors Louis Freeh and Howard Shapiro, Moody was convicted on all counts. He was sentenced to seven federal life terms. An Alabama state-court jury later convicted Moody of Judge Vance's murder; Moody was sentenced to death by electrocution in 1997.\\"Moody Lawyer Quits.\\" Associated Press at The Gadsden Times. B2. March 13, 1997. Retrieved from Google News (5 of 22) on March 3, 2011. \\"Moody, now at Holman Prison near Atmore, is serving seven federal life prison terms and was sentenced to death last month after the state trial in Birmingham.\\" He stayed on death row at the Holman Correctional Facility near Atmore, Alabama, from February 13, 1997. Moody was alleged to have attempted to run a Ponzi scheme from death row some time around 2015, according to an anonymous elderly Florida woman who claimed to have received a letter with a Holman Correctional Facility return address from Moody—although Moody was not known to have faced any disciplinary action as a result. On February 23, 2018, an execution date for Moody was set for April 19, 2018. He was subsequently executed on this date, at 8:42pm. Aged 83 years and 26 days at execution, he was both the oldest death row inmate in Alabama since James Hubbard was executed in 2004, and the oldest inmate executed in the United States in the post-Furman era, surpassing the previous record set by the execution of John B. Nixon Sr., who was executed in Mississippi in December 2005 at the age of 77 years, 8 months and 13 days. He declined to make a final statement and his last meal was Philly Cheesesteaks, Dr Pepper, and M&M;'s. == Popular culture == The case was featured in the episode \\"Deadly Delivery\\" of Forensic Files which first aired on October 29, 1998. It was also featured in the episode \\"Living in Terror\\" of The New Detectives, and in FBI Criminal Pursuit (Season 1, Episode 1 – \\"Murder By Mail\\"). == See also == * Capital punishment in Alabama * List of death row inmates in the United States * List of offenders executed in the United States in 2018 * List of people executed in Alabama ==References External links == * (6:43) Category:1935 births Category:2018 deaths Category:American people convicted of murder Category:Bombers (people) Category:People convicted of murder by Alabama Category:People from Clayton County, Georgia Category:People from Fort Valley, Georgia Category:People executed by Alabama by lethal injection Category:21st- century executions by Alabama Category:Military personnel from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:People executed for murder ","title":"Walter Moody"},{"id":"56750076","text":"Vesey Dawson, 2nd Earl of Dartrey (22 April 1842 – 14 June 1920), styled Viscount Cremorne between 1866 and 1897, was an Irish Liberal politician. ==Family and early life== Dawson was the eldest child of Richard Dawson, 1st Earl of Dartrey (then Lord Cremorne), and his wife, Augusta Stanley, daughter of Edward Stanley and Lady Mary Maitland.

She was an associate member of the Goat Island performance group from 1995 to 2009 and has served on the board of Belmont World Film. == Career == Zakari's studio practice freely combines research methodologies and artistic strategies borrowed from various disciplines such as photography, documentary, performance, storytelling, installation, graphic design and social interventions. According to her web site, Zakari draws upon contemporary social issues by making connections through personal narratives, history and popular culture. Combining her skills as a graphic designer and an artist, Zakari's work often culminates in the form of an artist's book. One of her early projects was a diary The Turk and the Jew on which she collaborated with her husband Mike Mandel while he lived in Pullman, Washington and she in Chicago, Illinois. They used the web as a means to communicate daily and further explore their cultural differences, then published the diary as an artists' book in 1998. The book webAffairs (2005) is a narrative, told in photographs and text, of Zakari's experience in virtual space. Using a pseudonym, she began a four-year-long performance and documentation of a webcam community where people meet to have virtual sex. The book comments on viewer's relationship to technology, the objectification of the body, personal surveillance tools and gender performativity. For fifteen years, Zakari and Mandel collaborated on a body of work about the conflict between secularist culture and the Islamist movement in Turkey. Their journey, which began in 1997, resulted in photographic images, video interviews and public performances. In 2010 they published an encyclopedic artists' book, The State of Ata (2010) followed later by a conceptual exhibition 7 Turkish Artists. Zakari and Mandel produced the book Lockdown Archive (2015) in response to the manhunt and lockdown of April 19, 2013, in their hometown of Watertown, Massachusetts. The couple designed and produced a series of commemorative porcelain plates \\"Shelter in Plates\\" depicting SWAT teams and heavy artillery near their home during the lockdown. == Collections == Zakari's work is in the permanent collections at Yale University Library, Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Getty Research Institute library, The Kinsey Institute Library, Institute of Network Cultures in Amsterdam and the Addison Gallery of American Art. == Exhibitions == She has had solo exhibitions in Boston, Baltimore, Atlanta, Los Angeles and also in Izmir and Ankara, Turkey.

Born to a Russian mother and a Chinese father, he was orphaned at a young age. Lin joined the Eighth Route Army to fight in the Second Sino- Japanese War before he turned 11. After the Second World War, he was trained as a fighter pilot and fought in the Korean War and the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis. He served as deputy commander of the PLA Air Force from 1985 to 1994 and attained the rank of lieutenant general in 1988. == Early life == Lin Hu was born on 26 December 1927 in Harbin, Heilongjiang province. His father, originally from Zhaoyuan, Shandong province, moved to Harbin. There he met Lin's mother, a Russian woman, who gave birth to three children. Lin was the middle child, with an older sister and a younger brother. When Lin Hu was just a few years old, his father froze to death in a winter night after falling asleep on a coal train. Soon afterward, his mother and brother both fell ill and died. Orphaned at a young age, he was adopted by a family surnamed Lin and was given the name Lin Gensheng (). His sister was adopted by a different family. == Wartime career== Lin Hu directing flights at Shantou Waisha Airport (1956) After the Japanese invasion of China, Lin joined the Eighth Route Army in October 1938 and fought in the Communist guerrilla base in the Yimeng Mountains of Shandong province, before he turned 11; he was renamed as Lin Hu (\\"forest tiger\\") by his superiors. In 1945, Lin became a member of the Communist Party of China. After the surrender of Japan at the end of the Second World War, the Communist Northeast Army took over a number of Japanese warplanes, pilots, and mechanics in the former Japanese puppet state Manchukuo, and established its first aviation school, the Northeast China Democratic United Army Aviation School (a predecessor of the PLA Air Force Aviation University). Lin was selected to receive pilot training at the school, from which he graduated in 1949. At the Founding Ceremony of the People's Republic of China on 1 October 1949, Lin piloted a P-51 Mustang fighter and flew across the sky over the Tiananmen in Beijing. During the Korean War, Lin was a deputy regiment commander of the People's Volunteer Army Air Force. He was credited with shooting down one and damaging another F-86 Sabre, the best jet fighter of the United States Air Force. After the end of the war, Lin was promoted to deputy commander of the 18th Division of the PLA Air Force based at the Shadi Air Base in Foshan, Guangdong. During the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958, he shot down two Taiwanese warplanes and damaged a third. ==Later career== Lin later successively served as deputy corps commander, deputy commander of a PLAAF command post, deputy commander of a military region air force, and deputy commandant of the PLAAF Command Academy. In 1985, he was promoted to deputy commander of the PLA Air Force, serving under Commander Wang Hai, and alongside Li Yongtai and Liu Zhitian, all Korean War veterans. He was awarded the rank of lieutenant general in 1988. He was also a deputy to the 7th and the 8th National People's Congress. He retired from active service in October 1994. In August 1997, Lin made his last flight with a Sukhoi Su-30 at the MAKS Air Show. He executed a series of aerobatic maneuvers including the Pugachev's Cobra, in cooperation with Anatoly Kvochur. In January 2002, Lin published the book Fight to Protect the Motherland's Airspace—A Retrospective of the Air Battles in the First Twenty Years of New China (), describing the PLAAF's defense operations between 1949 and 1969. == Death == Lin died in the evening of 3 March 2018, at the age of 90 (91 by East Asian age reckoning). He died on the same day as his friend and colleague, fellow Korean War veteran and PLAAF lieutenant general Yao Xian. They were born in the same year and graduated from the same aviation school. == Personal life == Lin Hu had a daughter named Lin Li (). == References == Category:1927 births Category:2018 deaths Category:People's Liberation Army Air Force generals Category:People's Liberation Army generals from Heilongjiang Category:PLA Air Force Aviation University alumni Category:Chinese people of Russian descent Category:Chinese military personnel of World War II Category:Chinese Korean War pilots Category:Delegates to the 7th National People's Congress Category:Delegates to the 8th National People's Congress Category:People from Harbin Category:Chinese military writers ","title":"Lin Hu (general)"},{"id":"56750196","text":"XHPMOC-FM is a radio station on 104.9 FM in Ciudad Cuauhtémoc, Chihuahua.

This is different from homology, which is the similarity of traits can be parsimoniously explained by common ancestry. Homoplasy can arise from both similar selection pressures acting on adapting species, and the effects of genetic drift. Homoplasy is the similarity in trait that is not parsimoniously explained by descent from a common ancestor. Most often, homoplasy is viewed as a similarity in morphological traits. However, homoplasy may also appear in other trait types, such as similarity in the genetic sequence, life cycle types or even behavioral traits. == Etymology == The term homoplasy was first used by Ray Lankester in 1870. The corresponding adjective is either homoplasic or homoplastic. It is derived from the two ancient Greek words (), meaning \\"similar, alike, the same\\", and (), meaning \\"to shape, to mold\\". == Parallelism and convergence == Parallel and convergent evolution lead to homoplasy when different species independently evolve or gain a comparable trait, which diverges from the trait inferred to have been present in their common ancestor. When the similar traits are caused by an equivalent developmental mechanism, the process is referred to as parallel evolution. The process is called convergent evolution when the similarity arises from different developmental mechanisms. These types of homoplasy may occur when different lineages live in comparable ecological niches that require similar adaptations for an increase in fitness. An interesting example is that of the marsupial moles (Notoryctidae), golden moles (Chrysochloridae) and northern moles (Talpidae). These are mammals from different geographical regions and lineages, and have all independently evolved very similar burrowing characteristics (such as a cone-shaped heads and flat frontal claws) to live in a subterranean ecological niche. == Reversion == In contrast, reversal (a.k.a. vestigialization) leads to homoplasy through the disappearance of previously gained traits. This process may result from changes in the environment in which certain gained traits are no longer relevant, or have even become costly. This can be observed in subterranean and cave-dwelling animals by their loss of sight, in cave-dwelling animals through their loss of pigmentation, and in both snakes and legless lizards through their loss of limbs. == Distinguishing homology from homoplasy == Homoplasy, especially the type that occurs in more closely related phylogenetic groups, can make phylogenetic analysis more challenging. Phylogenetic trees are often created by means of parsimony analysis. These analyses can be done with phenotypic, as well as genetic traits (DNA sequences). Using parsimony analysis, the hypothesis of relationships that requires the fewest evolutionary changes is preferred over alternative hypotheses. Construction of these trees may become a challenge when clouded by the occurrence of homoplasy in the traits used for the analysis. The most important approach to overcoming these challenges is to increase the number of independent (non-pleiotropic, non-linked) characteristics used in the phylogenetic analysis. Along with parsimony analysis, one could perform a likelihood analysis, where the most likely tree, given a particular model of evolution, is selected and branch lengths are measured. According to cladistic interpretation, homoplasy can be identified when the distribution of a trait cannot be explained by descent from a common ancestor on a preferred phylogenetic hypothesis - that is, the feature in question arises (or disappears) at more than one point on the tree. In the case of DNA sequences, homoplasy is very common due to the redundancy of the genetic code. An observed homoplasy may simply be the result of random nucleotide substitutions accumulating over time, and thus may not need an adaptationist evolutionary explanation. == Examples and applications of homoplasy == There are numerous documented examples of homoplasy within the following taxa: * Eusiroidea (Crustaceans and Amphipoda) * Urticaceae, * Asteraceae, * Polypodioideae (Selligueoid Ferns), * Ants * Merluccius capensis (Cape Hakes) * Tarantula spiders of the genus Bonnetina: nearly all morphological traits within this genus are homoplastic. Only sexual features were observed to not be homoplastic, suggesting that sexual selection may have been a driving force in the divergence of tarantulas. * gharials, with homoplasy between Tomistoma and true crocodiles, and between thoracosaurs and Gavialis. The occurrence of homoplasy can also be used to make predictions about evolution. Recent studies have used homoplasy to predict the possibility and the path of extraterrestrial evolution. For example, Levin et al. (2017) suggest that the development of eye-like structures is highly likely, due to its numerous, independently evolved incidences on earth. == Homoplasy vs. evolutionary contingency == In his book Wonderful Life, Stephen Jay Gould claims that repeating the evolutionary process, from any point in time onward, would not produce the same results. The occurrence of homoplasy is viewed by some biologists as an argument against Gould’s theory of evolutionary contingency. Powell & Mariscal (2015) argue that this disagreement is caused by an equivocation and that both the theory of contingency as well as homoplastic occurrence can be true at the same time. ==See also== * Convergent evolution * Heteroplasmy * Homology (biology) == References == Category:Biological concepts Category:Evolutionary biology Category:Phylogenetics ","title":"Homoplasy"},{"id":"56750326","text":"Casper Ehrenborg Casper Isaac Michael Ehrenborg (17 November 1788 – 16 September 1823) was a Swedish politician.

Livingston is an 1875 bronze sculpture of Robert R. Livingston, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, executed by the New York born sculptor Erastus Dow Palmer. The state is installed in the United States Capitol, in Washington, D.C., as part of the National Statuary Hall Collection. It is one of two statues donated by the state of New York.Architect of the Capitol Under the Direction of the Joint Committee on the Library, Compilation of Works of Art and Other Objects in the United States Capitol, United States Government Printing Office, Washington 1965 p. 211 ==History== In 1873, after receiving the commission to create the Livingston statue, Palmer moved to Paris to work on the statue. This was a departure from the usual tendency of American artists of the time to place themselves in Rome, a trend that was to accelerate in the coming years. There he worked on modeling and then casting his work before returning it and himself to the United States.Craven, Wayne, Sculpture in America, Thomas Y. Crowell Co., New York 1968 p. 165 In comparing this statue with others in the collection sculpture historian Wayne Craven noted, “The statue of Livingston, though slightly larger than life, is dwarfed by surrounding giants in marble and bronze, but few can approach it in quality. For many of the other statues, their inadequacies become all the more obvious as they increase in size, whereas the one of Livingston wears well.” Craven, Wayne, Sculpture in America, Thomas Y. Crowell Co., New York 1968 pp. 165–166 Webster in his biography and catalogue of Palmer's works reveals that the sculptor first produced a nude study of Livingston (with fig leaf) prior to executing the clothed statue, which was a common practice at the time.Webster, J Carson, Erastus D. Palmer: Sculpture-Ideas, University of Delaware Press, Newark, 1983 p. 230 In Paris, Palmer made two casts of the work, one bound for the Capitol, the other for the New York Court of Appeals in Albany. A plaster version was placed in Livingston Hall at the State University of New York at Albany. One of the two versions was exhibited at the Centennial International Exhibition in Philadelphia and was awarded a first class medal.James-Gadzinski, Susan and Mary Mullen Cunninghan, American Sculpture in the Museum of American Art of the Philadelphia Academy of the Fine Arts, Museum of American Art of the Philadelphia Academy of the Fine Arts and University of Washington Press, Seattle 1997 pp. 45–46 Since the Exposition was held in 1876 and the statue in Washington was unveiled in 1875, it is likely that it was the Albany statue or the Albany plaster that was shown in Philadelphia. ==See also== * 1875 in art ==References * Category:1875 establishments in Washington, D.C.

The alternative name derives from the local legend linking the house with Anne Boleyn and from its imposing appearance, notably the castle-like structure called Anne Boleyn’s Tower which lay immediately adjacent to Green Street. The house lay at the southern end of Green Street, from which it takes its name, a street which forms the boundary between West and East Ham. West Ham United's former Boleyn Ground was built immediately to the east of the House and took its name from the alternative name for the house. In its early years the club referred to their new ground as the Boleyn Castle with Boleyn Ground subsequently becoming the usual term. ==Origin, and the Boleyn Legend== The estate was formed in the early 16th-century, perhaps by Richard Breame (d. 1546) a servant of Henry VIII. The local legend is that Anne Boleyn lived there and Henry VIII came there to court her. There is no documentary evidence to support this belief. ==Description== Green Street House was a red-brick building, mostly of two storeys which originally comprised a great hall at right angles to the street with a long range at its west end and a kitchen block at the east end. South of the kitchen block was a staircase wing with a three-storeyed tower east of that. At the north end of the west range, fronting Green Street, was an arched gateway. In the late 17th-century the upper parts of the hall, the west range, the kitchen, and staircase wing were partly rebuilt. during the ownership of Sir Jacob and Sir Thomas Garrard. In the 18th-century a wing was added east of the tower, and a later addition was made east of the kitchen. Inside the house there was panelling of the late 16th- or early 17th-century, and the main staircase was of the same period. In the garden, south of the west wing, was a detached tower, Anne Boleyn's Tower, which overlooked the street and was the best-known feature of the house. This was an octagonal building of red brick with crenellated parapet and stair-turret. It was built about the middle of the 16th-century, and may originally have been balanced by another tower at the south-east corner of the garden. The upper part of the tower was rebuilt by William Morley about 1800. Until the 18th-century a room in the tower was hung with leather embossed with gold, but Morley's predecessor, Mrs. Whiteside, is said to have burnt these hangings and sold the gold. The sale catalogue of 1863 lists all the rooms in the house and its outbuildings, and describes the gardens, which contained several fine cedars. When the Roman Catholics bought the house they demolished the gateway and erected a range of buildings, including a church, along Green Street.Information in this section from BHO, except where stated http://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/essex/vol6/pp8-14 ==Owners and Tenants== It has been suggested that Breame was followed in the late 16th- and early 17th-centuries by the Nevilles whose monument is in St. Mary's church, East Ham. In the 1630s and 1640s the estate seems to have belonged to Sir Henry Holcroft (died circa 1651) a Parliamentarian prominent in Essex during the Civil War, and later to his widow. It was acquired about 1653 by Sir Jacob Garrard (Bt.), a London merchant of royalist sympathies who founded an apprenticing charity. Green Street House descended with the baronetcy until the death in 1728 of Sir Nicholas Garrard. Cecilia, widow of Sir Nicholas, retained it until her death in 1753, when it passed to his grandnephew Sir Jacob Downing, Bt. In 1755 Downing conveyed the estate, then comprising about 160 acres, to James Barnard or Bernard (d. 1759). Bernard appears to have been succeeded by Mrs. Whiteside, who was probably his daughter and the estate was partly broken up about this time. In 1788–1789, Maurice Bernard sold Green Street House and grounds, totalling 17 a., to William Morley. Morley, a London corn merchant, lived there until his death in 1832. The house was subsequently bought by Mr. Henry Lee, for his daughter Mrs. Sarah Morley, who was related to the former owner by marriage. In 1839 James Morley (not her husband but possibly her uncle), owned and occupied the house. The occupation of the site by the different Morley families led to the junction of Green Street and Barking Road, by the Boleyn Tavern, being known as Morley's Corner. In 1863, the house and grounds, then comprising 30 a., were advertised for sale. They do not appear to have changed hands then, but in 1869 they were bought from the Morleys by Cardinal Manning, for use as a Roman Catholic reformatory school.Children's Homes website includes OS map of 1896 and a drawing of Anne Boleyn's Tower http://www.childrenshomes.org.uk/PlaistowRfy/ After the reformatory was closed the southern part of the site was used for a Roman Catholic church and primary school. The house, after being used c. 1907–12 as a maternity home, was leased, with some adjoining land, to the West Ham United football club, which sub-let the house to the Boleyn Castle social club. The social club occupied the house until the Second World War.Information in this section from BHO, except where stated http://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/essex/vol6/pp8-14 ==Demolition== Like many stately homes at that time, the house became dilapidated, with bomb damage possibly a factorLink to National Archive War Damage reports http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C3727978, and as a result was demolished in 1955. ==Legacy== Until 2016, West Ham United played at the adjacent Boleyn Ground named after the House and the club's badge featured a stylised representation of the House. The ground's West Stand, redeveloped in 2001 included tower features as a stylised tribute to the club's badge and Green Street House itself. The Boleyn Ground was demolished after the 2015–16 season but the Boleyn Tavern, on the Morley's Corner junction with Barking Road remains. Several nearby street names reflect the presence of the House. Castle Street immediately to the south and the cluster of streets with Tudor themed names a little to the north. After West Ham United left the Boleyn Ground in 2016, archaeologists uncovered foundations of some of the buildings beneath the club’s former carpark.link to a summary of works archaeological works being carried out prior to redevelopment of the Boleyn Ground - includes background information and an OS map showing both the House and the football ground http://www.pre-construct.com/Contact/Images/Boleyn-Poster.PDF ==References== Category:East Ham Category:Former buildings and structures in the London Borough of Newham ","title":"Green Street House"},{"id":"56750508","text":"The 2018 Asian Alpine Ski Championships were the 27th Asian Alpine Ski Championships and took place from March 4–6, 2018, in Darbandsar Ski Resort, Darband Sar, Iran. ==Medal summaryMen=== { - Slalom    - Giant slalom    - Super-G    - Alpine combined    } ===Women=== { - Slalom    - Giant slalom    - Super-G    - Alpine combined    } ==Medal tableReferences *Results Alpine Ski Championships Asian Category:Asian Alpine Ski Championships Category:International sports competitions hosted by Iran Category:March 2018 sports events in Iran ","title":"2018 Asian Alpine Ski Championships"},{"id":"56750509","text":"Seaton railway station may refer to: In England: * Seaton railway station (Cumbria), on the Cleator and Workington Junction Railway * Seaton railway station (Devon) * Seaton railway station (County Durham), on the North Eastern Railway * Seaton Delaval railway station, also on the North Eastern Railway * Seaton railway station (Rutland) In Australia: * Seaton Park railway station in Adelaide, South Australia ","title":"Seaton railway station"},{"id":"56750513","text":"The 1993 Scheldeprijs was the 80th edition of the Scheldeprijs cycle race and was held on 21 April 1993.

The current plans for the new railway line involve the construction of of track between Espoo and Salo with maximum running speeds of per hour, allowing for a journey time of an hour between Helsinki and Turku compared to the current two hours. In 2017, the Finnish government provided €10 million in funding towards the planning and construction of the line, with half of this being eligible for European Union TEN-T funding. In April 2018, the Finnish Transport Agency awarded planning contracts for the line to three consultants: Sitiowise Finland for the Espoo to Lohja section of track, Pöyry for the Lohja to Suomusjärvi section, and Ramboll for the Suomusjärvi to Salo section. After the 2019 Finnish parliamentary election, new Prime Minister of Finland Antti Rinne's government confirmed its commitment to advancing the three planned Finnish high-speed rail lines; the ELSA-rata, a Helsinki-Tampere line, and the Itärata line from Helsinki to Eastern Finland. In September 2019, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment gave authorisation to the Ministry of Transport and Communications to establish the Turku One Hour Train Project Company to oversee the Helsinki–Turku high-speed rail line, and the Suomirata Project Company, which will manage development of the new Riihimäki–Tampere line. Following the Finnish government's request for investment in February 2020, the EU's Connecting Europe Facility approved €37.5 million in funding for the Helsinki–Turku high-speed rail project in July 2020, to form an integral part of the Trans-European Transport Network's Helsinki–Valletta Corridor. ==Route== The line is planned to branch from the Rantarata after Espoo railway station, connecting to Salo following the Finnish national road 1 corridor, through the municipalities of Vihti and Lohja. To complement the line and increase capacity, the track between Leppävaara and Espoo will be quadrupled as part of the Helsinki commuter rail services. Stations on the line are yet to be confirmed, although Lohja is expected to gain a station, being one of the largest Finnish municipalities without scheduled railway services. ===Objections=== In July 2019, residents of the Lukkarinmäki area of Salo have gathered a petition of 2,500 signatures against building the line through their neighbourhood, due to the potential need to demolish some properties. Alternatives proposed include building the line to avoid the neighbourhood or building a tunnel. ==Benefits== By reducing the journey time to 75 minutes between Helsinki and Turku, along with new stations in Vihti and Lohja, a further 1.6 million passengers are expected annually. Capacity will also be freed on the existing Rantarata railway line following the coast. ==Costs== The total construction cost of the ELSA-rata was estimated at €1.5 billion as of 2016, with planning costs of €40 million. In 2019 it was reported that the expected cost had increased to €2 billion. ==See also== * High-speed rail in Finland * List of railway lines in Finland * Rail transport in Finland * Rantarata ==References * Tunnin juna (in Finnish) Category:Railway lines in Finland Category:Proposed railway lines in Finland Category:5 ft gauge railways in Finland ","title":"ELSA-rata"},{"id":"56750680","text":"MV Miranda Guinness was a vessel in the Guinness shipping fleet.

The route was on Main Street, in Horseheads, until the Chemung Canal was reached; this canal had been abandoned as a waterway some years before the railway was built, and the towpath was subsequently owned by the railway company as its right of way. The line passed through a well-settled country and the villages of Pine Valley and Millport, and left the private right of way on reaching the town of Montour Falls. Then it proceeded through the main streets of Montour Falls, and along New York State Route 14 to Watkins Glen, and through Watkins Glen to the northern terminus at the lake. The road passed through two counties, Chemung and Schuyler, and directly to the entrances of Watkins Glen State Park at Watkins Glen and Havana Glen Park at Montour Falls. The terminus at Watkins Glen was on the shore of Seneca Lake adjacent to the depot of the Northern Central Railroad Co., and connected with the steam boat lines of the Seneca Lake Transportation Co. Seneca Lake is a fine body of water about long, and there are a number of summer resorts and cottages along its shores reached by the steamboats. When this route was projected, it was with many doubts as to the ultimate completion of the road, but the officials of the railway company after thoroughly examining the field decided to award the contract for designing, constructing and equipping the road to the American Engineering Co., of Philadelphia, which immediately prepared plans and specifications and commenced grading for the roadbed. The cuts were wide at grade line with side slopes of 1½ lo 1 and ditches for drainage at the base of the slope; the fills were made at the grade line after being allowed to settle along the private right of way. It was necessary to change the course of the Catharine River at four different points and wherever the river was adjacent to the fills they were protected from washing by oak piles driven apart parallel with the river, with willow mattresses placed between and behind the piling and backed by stone rip rap work. Wherever the line of road crossed the stream there were erected plate girder or through span steel bridges, which were furnished by the Berlin Bridge Co. and the Havana Bridge Co. The bridges were set on foundations of cut stone laid in Portland cement, none but dimension stones being placed in the faces of the walls. The track over all bridges had inside guard rails of the same section as the running rails, laid parallel to and from them. The bridges had fender pieces with notches on the underside to receive the ties; the fender pieces were held in place by bolts with washers on each end. Exposed parts of ties and also the notches were treated with two coats of red lead to prevent absorption of moisture.Elmira & Seneca Lake Railway Co. In: The Street Railway Review. Vol. 10, No. 9, 15 September 1900, p.515-518. == Rails == Typical bridge The rails were a 56 lb/yard (28 kg/m) T-section rolled by the Carnegie company. They were laid on ties 6x8 in. x 8 ft., of hewn oak and chestnut, spaced 18 in. on centers except at joints, where they are spaced 14 in.; the joints were suspended. The track was surfaced on a bed of 12 in, of creek gravel; stone ballast was filled in level with the tops of the ties, having the natural slope from the ends of the ties. The track was bonded with No. 0000 Morris protected stranded copper bonds, and cross-bonded every 200 ft. Ground plates were buried in the stream, wherever a crossing is made and connected to the track circuit by four No. 00 wires: four wires are used to guard against breakage. == Overhead lines == The overhead construction was with side poles except through the towns and villages, where the span construction was used. Side poles were in length, at the top, with seamless steel bracket arms supporting clips for suspension wire, having the overhead wire supported from an eyebolt attached to the top of the pole. All suspension and pull-off wire was stranded galvanized iron. The trolley wire was No. 00 grooved section, hung on insulators with the General Electric Co's, special mechanical clip for this pattern of wire. The feeder system consisted of 13 miles of No. 0000 solid copper wire, insulated in the towns and bare on the private way. It was hung on glass insulators supported by cross arms on the side poles. Lightning arresters were placed every and grounded on to track circuit. Telephone on pole The telephone signal system was furnished by the Novelty Electric Co., and consisted of a telephone at each of the sidings and terminals. There were also instruments at the power house and office so that a car at any siding could communicate with the power house or office, and with another car through the office, or the office could reach any car on the lines by ringing bells which are placed along the line, bridged in circuit, which notify the car that is wanted. Each telephone was numbered the same as the siding at which it is located, and the system was found to work very satisfactorily. The road was fenced for its entire length over the private right of way, nearly , with galvanized wire. The fencing was supported on iron posts every and had wooden end and brace posts; the grade crossings were protected by cattle guards made of triangular oak pieces. All farm crossings were put below grade through special cattle passes. == Depot == The car barn was located parallel to the railway near the power house. It was , and contained four tracks with a shop and the employees' room in the end nearest the power house; the building and pits were heated with exhaust steam from the power house, which was piped underground from the latter. The building and special work leading from it were lighted with enclosed arc lights; the pits and rooms were lighted with incandescent lamps. The sides of the pits were of brick and were built outside of and parallel to the tracks. The tracks were carried over the pits on trestles to allow space at the sides for light and ventilation. == Power house == Exterior of power house The power house was a brick building on a stone foundation laid in cement mortar. The roof was carried in steel trusses and covered with slate, with Ved tile trimmings. The floors of both engine and boiler rooms are of cement. Harrisburg 4-valve engines in the power house The engine room equipment comprised one 350-h.p. engine driving a 325-kW generator and one 250-h.p. engine driving a 225-kW generator; the two generators were Westinghouse. Both of these engines were made by the Harrisburg Foundry & Machine Works, of Harrisburg. Pa., and were of the type known as the Harrisburg four-valve self-oiling simple engine. This type was one of a complete series made by the company and has been specially designed to give satisfactory and efficient service under the following conditions: Steady, or if required, varying load; belted or direct connected to the generators; exhaust either free to atmosphere, or, if unavoidable, subjected lo back pressure; steam pressure from 70 to 100 lb; low-priced attendants; units from 75 to 700 h.p.; compact floor space; quiet operation; a water rate from 25 to 28 lb. per hour. The four valves were cylindrical in form and perfectly balanced under all conditions; the two steam valves had removable bushings which render repairs positively reliable. There were two eccentrics, one actuating the two steam valves and one the two exhaust valves, the motion being transmitted to wrist plates by in dependent rocker arms; this design was justified because the arrangement permits a rapid acceleration of the valve gear and secures sharp cut-off and release. The valve gear was made as simple as possible and close adjustment could be secured so that in operation there was no clattering or noisy vibration. The wrist plates and the wrist plate pin were made of a special steel, the pin being lined with adjustable sections of phosphor bronze. Lubrication of the pins was accomplished by means of compression grease cups on the outside end of each pin thus allowing the operator to force the lubricant into use without exposing himself in the least to the mechanism. The switchboard was of white marble equipped with Keystone and Weston instruments. A detector bell was provided which rang when a circuit breaker opened and continued sounding until the circuit was closed. All wiring from the generators to the switchboard was carried under the engine room floor. Adjoining the switchboard was the telephone booth and near it were a tool room, a dressing room and the office for the engineers. The steam piping, which was completed under the direction of Mr. A. C. Thompson, consisted of a main header with a branch for each engine turned from it and a Bundy automatic trap for returning hot water drippings to the boilers. In the boiler room were two 300-h.p. boilers, an American feed water heater and two Snow pumps. Coal storage pockets were directly in front of the boilers, and coal was deposited in the pockets through a steel-lined chute leading from a railroad siding parallel to the building and some above the pockets. Coal was thus unloaded into the storage pockets without cost for handling. The stack was high: it was of steel, brick lined, and titled with lightning rods. Water for the plant was secured by damming a branch of Catharine River and laying a pipe with natural gravity flow to a well in the boiler room. Analysis of the water showed it to be first-class for steaming purposes. The water dammed back being on the company's property, it was planned to be used as a resort for picnicking in summer and skating in winter. == Rolling stock == The car equipment consisted of 12 cars, four of them similar to that used for the formal opening of the line. Two of these four had smoking compartments, the other two had both baggage and smoking compartments. They were equipped with four G. E. 1.000 motors, K-11 controllers, Christenson automatic air brakes, and Wagenhals arc headlights. The interior was finished in cherry and mahogany; the seats were of the walkover pattern, covered with rattan. They were lighted with four five-light clusters of handsome design; these cars were fitted with electric push buttons. Of the other eight cars, six were open 15-bench cars and two closed cars; they were equipped with Westinghouse motors and G. E. K-11 controllers and had Syracuse changeable headlights. The cars were painted Pullman green with gold striping and each had the name of one of the towns on the route as well as the number. All cars had a tool box containing pliers, wrench, and trolley wire pickup for use in case of emergency repairs, or picking up broken trolley wire. == Inauguration == After the inspection and opening trip those present enjoyed an elaborate banquet at the Rathbun House, Elmira, as guests of the American Engineering Co. The people along the line of route have shown their appreciation by their generous patronage, the present equipment being taxed to its utmost capacity since the opening of the road. == Personnel == The officers of the Elmira & Seneca Lake Railway Co. were initially: *President, Gen. John E. Mulford, Montour F'alls, N. Y. *Vice- president, John Blair MacAfee, Philadelphia *Secretary and treasurer, C. I. Hathaway, Horseheads *Superintendent, C. F. Baldwin, Montour Falls *Assistant superintendent, C. I.. Furbay, Montour Falls. The employees of the company were uniformed in cadet gray; conductors' uniforms were trimmed with gold, the motormen's with silver and other employees' with black. All had cap badges with name of occupation and number in enamel. == Fares == The fare for the trip from Elmira to Watkins Glen was 35 cents one way; no reduction was made for the round trip. == See also == * Elmira and Lake Ontario Railroad == References == Category:Tram, urban railway and trolley companies Category:Streetcars in New York (state) Category:Defunct New York (state) railroads Category:Railway companies established in 1900 ","title":"Elmira and Seneca Lake Railway"},{"id":"56750727","text":"Patrick Alen Teixeira (born 5 December 1990) is a Brazilian professional boxer who has held the WBO light middleweight title since 2019. ==Professional career== Teixeira turned professional in 2009, winning his first 25 fights before facing Curtis Stevens on 7 May 2016 (on the undercard of Canelo Álvarez vs. Amir Khan), who stopped him in two rounds to win the vacant World Boxing Council Continental Americas middleweight title.

She was born Susan Lewis in Chicago, Illinois. She married architect Frank Williams in the 1960s and had her son David in 1969. She was a fraternal twin (Sandy, her sister was an animal rights activist). Williams got her MFA at New York University, where she initially studied painting, but then moved into three dimensional work. Her time was divided between San Miguel Allende in Mexico where she maintained a home and studio and Craryville, in upstate New York. In 2015, she died of cancer at home in Craryville with her son at her side; her husband, son, and three grandchildren (Anabelle, Dakota, Juliette) survived her. Williams was an AIR Gallery pioneer and co-founding member. She formed the gallery in 1972 with friend Barbara Zucker in order to increase the promotion of work by female artists. In addition to her sculptures, Williams worked in plexiglas creating furniture and producing standing lamps, tables and chairs that were sold and exhibited. The sculptures she showed early on at AIR were influenced by the furniture and were large, tall transparent plastic containers filled with newsprint. In 1963, Williams and Barbara Zucker met on Monhegan Island. During the 1960s, they shared an artist's studio on lower Broadway, Chinatown and Little Italy. For a brief period they worked to create sculptures and paintings that were mirrors of each other but all these works were destroyed. After leaving the AIR Gallery, Williams also designed silver jewelry for several years. Her late work is composed of graphic, black and white manipulated photographic images. ==References== Category:20th-century American women artists Category:2015 deaths Category:Artists from Chicago Category:New York University alumni Category:Year of birth missing ","title":"Susan Williams (artist)"},{"id":"56750756","text":"The Asian Alpine Ski Championships is an alpine skiing championship organized by the Asian Ski Federation for competitors from the Asian countries. ==List tournaments== {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - cccccc;\\" !width=30 # !width=50 Year !width=80Age Group !width=220Venue !width=200Date -  1  1991  Children  align=left Suzuran Kogen, Japan  align=left March 21–23, 1991 -  2  1992  Children  align=left Alpensia, South Korea  align=left January 29–30, 1992 -  3  1993  Children  align=left Otoineppu, Japan  align=left March 17–19, 1993 -  4  1994  Children  align=left Yabuli, China  align=left March 10–11, 1994 -  5  1995  Juniors  align=left Alpensia, South Korea  align=left February 26–28, 1995 -  6  1996  Children  align=left Inawashiro, Japan  align=left March 12–13, 1996 -  7  1997  Juniors  align=left Phoenix, South Korea  align=left March 3–4, 1997 -  8  1998   align=left Tottori, Japan  align=left Cancelled -  9  1999  Children  align=left Dizin, Iran  align=left February 18–19, 1999 -  10  2000  Children  align=left Mzaar Kfardebian, Lebanon  align=left March 3–4, 2000 -  11  2001  Children  align=left Yongpyong, South Korea  align=left March 2–3, 2001 -  12  2002  Children  align=left Owani, Japan  align=left March 8–9, 2002 -   2003  Children  align=left Dizin, Iran  align=left Cancelled -  13  2004  Juniors  align=left Dizin, Iran  align=left March 11–12, 2004 -  14  2005  Children  align=left Beidahu, China  align=left February 26–27, 2005 -  15  2006  Juniors  align=left Yomase, Japan  align=left March 16–17, 2006 -  16  2007  Children  align=left Yongpyong, South Korea  align=left March 7–8, 2007 -  17  2008  Juniors  align=left Mzaar Kfardebian, Lebanon  align=left February 23–24, 2008 -  18  2009  Children  align=left Mzaar Kfardebian, Lebanon  align=left February 14–15, 2009 -  19  2010  Juniors  align=left Shymbulak, Kazakhstan  align=left March 4–6, 2010 -  20  2011  Children  align=left Kangwon, South Korea  align=left March 4–5, 2011 -  21  2012  Juniors  align=left Dizin, Iran  align=left February 22–24, 2012 -  22  2013  Children  align=left Shymbulak, Kazakhstan  align=left February 27–28, 2013 -  23  2014  Juniors  align=left Dizin, Iran  align=left March 4–6, 2014 -  24  2015  Seniors  align=left Yongpyong, South Korea  align=left March 3–4, 2015 -  25  2016  Children  align=left Mzaar Kfardebian, Lebanon  align=left March 5–6, 2016 -  26  2017  Juniors  align=left Mzaar Kfardebian, Lebanon  align=left March 5, 2017 -  27  2018  Seniors  align=left Darbandsar, Iran  align=left March 4–6, 2018 } ==External links== *Official ASF site Asian Alpine Ski Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1991 ","title":"Asian Alpine Ski Championships"},{"id":"56750764","text":"Ogden Gavanski is a film producer from Canada who has worked on local and American productions.

However, after the Union army was driven out of Richmond in the disastrous Peninsular campaign, and the Rebel Army began to march on to Washington, Lincoln issued a call for three hundred thousand three-year volunteers. Young boys had many of the same motives for joining the military as their adult counterparts did. In the North, young boys felt a desire to set the South straight. In the South, young boys wanted to repel the North, whom they viewed as a hostile invader. A key difference between young boys’ and adults was their attitude towards slavery: in general, young boys on both sides had neutral feelings towards slavery. Thus, few were motivated to fight for it or against it. By and large, the most popular reason young boys joined the military in order to escape what they viewed as a dull life on the farms. Nearly all dreamed of coming home as heroes. Almost none imagined the conflict would drag on as long as it did. == Methods of enlistment == Although the official minimum enlistment age was 18, there were various ways boys got around this. First, the boys’ appearance often fooled recruiters. It is fairly common, especially for young teenage boys, to appear much older than they are. This trick was even easier during the chaos that often occurred at recruiting stations, when new units were hastily formed. Second, it was easy to lie about one’s age, especially given the fact that modern methods of identification (social security, driver’s license, computer databases) did not exist. Further, recruiters were anxious to fill recruitment quotas. So, even though they were required to certify on the enlistment papers that they judged the volunteer to be of lawful age, they often turned a blind eye to an underage recruit. Such recruitment passivity increased as the manpower on both sides dwindled and both sides were desperate for more help. One trick was to have an underage recruit write \\"18\\" on his shoes and truthfully reply to the recruiter \\"I am over 18.\\" Third, some underage boys were able to enlist with the endorsement of an adult. Ned Hutter, sixteen years old, joined the Confederate Army in Mississippi. His father vouched for Ned’s work ethic and shooting ability. The recruiter then accepted Ned into the unit. Despite such workarounds, many other boys joined the military legitimately by signing up for non-combat positions. Many such youths signed up as musicians (such as drummer, bugler, flautist). There were places for 40,000 such positions in the Union Armies alone. They often performed other tasks, such as carrying canteens, bandages, and stretchers, to assist surgeons and nurses with the wounded; relaying orders on the battlefield; and at least a few picked up rifles and participated in the fighting. == Conditions  Food === Perhaps the most common complaint of boy soldiers during the Civil War was the lack of food. This is because the process for keeping an army fed relied heavily on the delicately perfect timing of many factors, including gathering, loading, and transporting food. If any of these processes were delayed, or if any miscommunications occurred, it could be days or weeks before the army was fed. Hardtack was a staple food item, to the boys’ chagrin: \\"After we had been in the field a year or two the call, ‘Fall in for your hard-tack!’ was leisurely responded to by only about a dozen men.... Hard-tack was very hard. This I attributed to its great age, for there was a common belief among the boys that our hard-tack had been baked long before the beginning of the Christian era. This opinion was based upon the fact that the letters 'B.C.' were stamped on many, if not, indeed, all the cracker-boxes.\\" Other staples included pork, coffee, and bread. Starving boys often devised intricate ways to sneak out of their camps and forage for food. They found food by either gathering it from the local land, or stealing it from local farmers. In the Union Army, some soldiers initially objected to this practice as violating the Ten Commandments. But as the war wore on, it became evident that “such tender regard for Rebel property” strengthened the enemy and weakened the Union cause. Consequently, “conscientious scruples stepped to the rear, and the soldier who had them at the end of the war was a curiosity indeed.” Commanding officers forbade foraging, but often connived it and shared in the spoils. === Clothing === Clothing was a crude procedure for both armies, especially towards the beginning of the war. Once colors and patterns were agreed upon, uniforms were more easily standardized. However, young boys often found themselves in uniforms that were too big. Additionally, many boys continued to grow after being assigned a uniform, and many outgrew their uniforms. Some units did not have the resources to provide uniforms to young boys, so many had to wear their own clothes from home. As a result, many young boys often resorted to stealing uniforms from deceased soldiers, or bartered food and supplies in order to have their clothes tailored by locals. === Marching === Excitement over enlistment swiftly gave way to the boring routines of camp life and marches. \\"Day after day and night after night did we tramp along the rough and dusty roads ‘neath the most broiling sun with which the month of August ever afflicted a soldier; thro’ rivers and their rocky valleys, over mountains—on, on, scarcely stopping to gather the green corn from the fields to serve us for rations.... During these marches the men are sometimes unrecognizable on account of the thick coverings of dust which settle upon their hair, eye-brows and beard, filling likewise the mouth, nose, eyes, and ears.\\" === Death, injury, and capture === Young boys were not spared from the horrors of war that their adult counterparts faced, including violent deaths, injuries (and poor medical treatment), and appalling living conditions when captured. Young soldiers’ romantic illusions about military glory evaporated under the harsh realities of combat. They suffered hunger, fatigue, and discomfort, and gradually lost their innocence in combat. Every aspect of soldiering comes alive in their letters and diaries: the stench of spoiled meat, the deafening sound of cannons, the sight of maimed bodies, and the randomness and anonymity of death. The accounts of young Union prisoners at Confederate prison camps are especially harrowing. Sixteen-year-old Michael Dougherty was shocked by the sight of “different instruments of torture: stocks, thumb screws, barbed iron collars, shackles, ball and chain. Our prison keepers seemed to handle them with familiarity.” William Smith, a fifteen-year-old soldier in the 14th Illinois Infantry, was shaken by the physical appearance of prisoners at Andersonville in Georgia, a “great mass of gaunt, unnatural-looking beings, soot-begrimes, and clad in filthy trousers.\\" Michael Dougherty was the only member of his company to survive imprisonment at Andersonville Prison in Georgia. \\"No one, except he was there in the prison can form anything like a correct idea of our appearance about this time. We had been in prison nearly five months and our clothing was worn out. A number were entire naked; some would have a ragged shirt and no pants; some had pants and no shirt; another would have shoes and a cap and nothing else. Their flesh was wasted away, leaving the chaffy, weather beaten skin drawn tight over the bones, the hip bones and shoulders standing out. Their faces and exposed parts of their bodies were covered with smoky black soot, from the dense smoke of pitch pine we had hovered over, and our long matted hair was stiff and black with the same substance, which water would have no effect on, and soap was not to be had. I would not attempt to describe the sick and dying, who could now be seen on every side.\\" === Offences and punishments === Young boys also committed the same offenses as their adult counterparts, and their commanding officers did not spare them from punishment. Offenses included: * “Back talking” (i.e. addressing a superior with insolence) or refusal to follow military etiquette. * Drunkenness. * Absence from camp without leave. * “Turbulence after taps” (i.e. causing a commotion after lights-out). * Sitting while on guard * Gambling Punishments included: * Hard labor. * Carrying a log by oneself. * Forcing the offender to stand on a barrel for an entire day. * Confinement to the “guard-tent.” A veteran of the Civil War observed that this punishment “may not be though a very severe penalty; still, the men did not enjoy it, as it imposed quite a restriction on their freedom to be thus pent up and cut off from the rest of their associates.” * Confinement in a box. * Lashing the offender to a wheel. * Wearing a board describing the offense. * Being tied up by one’s thumbs. * “Drumming out of camp” (usually for cowardice). This punishment involved stripping the offender of his equipments and uniform, and marching him through the camp with a guard on either side, four soldiers behind, and a fife and drum corps bringing up the rear. This gave the rest of the army the chance to publicly humiliate the offender. * Death by firing squad (usually for desertion). Abraham Lincoln was so reluctant to approve the death penalty that he became famous (or, at least from the perspective of those in favor of the military's ultimate sanction, infamous) for his last-minute pardons and reprieves. Over time, Generals increasingly demanded executions be carried out before the President would have an opportunity to review it. == Notable examples == Elisha Stockwell, Jr. joined the Union Army at age fifteen. Since this was against his father’s wishes, he tricked his father by claiming that he was going to a Dutch dance. He told his sister he'd be back for dinner, but didn't return home for two years. He was in the Union Army for the entire duration of the war, participating in battles such as the Battle of Shiloh, the Siege of Vicksburg, and Sherman’s March to the Sea. He survived the war and wrote a memoir of his wartime experiences. His story is cited extensively in the awarding-winning children’s book, The Boys’ War. The most celebrated schoolboy performance of the war was the baptism of fire of the Virginia Military Institute Cadet Corps at the Battle of New Market. The corps was 215 strong when it reached the battle. The boys were eighteen or under (tradition has it that some were only fourteen). Washington and Lee University provided a company of sixty-four boys in the first days of the Civil War. Their average age was about seventeen, and their average weight was about 130 pounds. Of a total of sixty-five present in the two battles of Manassas, twenty-three were killed or wounded. In the forty battles in which it fought with the 4th Virginia Infantry, the company lost 100 dead or wounded, and forty-six captured, of a total strength of 150 from recruitments. ===Union=== Mancil V. \\"Manny\\" Root. Root was the youngest soldier in the Union Army on record. He was born in Ohio in 1854 and enlisted as a drummer boy at the age of 11, serving in the 36th Wisconsin Infantry. He died in Cedar Rapids, Iowa in 1929.Mancil Root William Black. The Civil War’s youngest wounded soldier on record, he was twelve when his left hand and arm were shattered by an exploding shell. Avery Brown enlisted 1861 age 8 as a musicianAvery Brown John Clem joined the 22nd Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment as a drummer boy at 11 years of age, (Murphy) and became a mounted orderly on the staff of George Henry Thomas. At the Battle of Chickamauga, he defiantly killed a Confederate colonel who ordered his surrender. For this, he was promoted to Sergeant. Clem went on to become a career soldier, retiring in 1915 with the rank of Brigadier General. George Penfield Bennett born 1852, enlisted in 1861 in New York, Company B, 1st Marine Regiment, at the age of 9 years and 7 days. Served on the ship his father commanded, the U.S.S. Cossack. He was a “powder monkey,” passing ammunition to the gunners from the magazine. During the battle of New Bern he was presented with a pony by General Reno for intrepidity on the battle field.

She was a member of the Communist Party and became notable for her left-wing activism which eventually led to her arrest in 1951. She was charged with forming a conspiracy to overthrow the government under the Smith Act of 1940 and spent a year in jail. The Immigration and Naturalization Service attempted to deport her, but their efforts were preempted by the 1957 ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States that the Smith Act was unconstitutional. ==Personal life== Rose Chernin was born as Rochelle Chernin in Chasnik, Russia, in 1901. She and three younger sisters migrated to Waterbury, Connecticut with her mother, Perle, in 1913. After finishing grade school, Rose entered Crosby Preparatory School, where she encountered socialist ideas in an activist newspaper. She later attended Hunter College, but dropped out to participate in political activism through the Russian Club. She married Paul Kusnitz in 1925, and moved to the Bronx where they had their first child, Nina, who would die of Hodgkin's disease in 1944. In 1940, Rose Chernin had her second daughter, Kim Chernin. Paul Kusnitz died in 1967. Rose Chernin died in Los Angeles of Alzheimer's disease in 1995. ==Political activities== Rose was active in local socialist causes including tenant advocacy and rent strikes. After becoming a US citizen in 1929, she joined the Communist Party in 1932, and her family briefly moved to Moscow, where she worked in publishing. She returned to America in 1934 after witnessing the arrest of fourteen communist activists under anti- organizing laws. The family returned to the Bronx. After the death of Nina, the family moved to California. In Los Angeles, Chernin began another round of tenant advocacy and other activist work, such as protesting the deportation of British communist writer Henry Carlisle. She would first be threatened with deportation after being accused of participation in the Young Communist League. She also participated in actions on behalf of migrant agricultural workers. ==Arrest and release== Rose Chernin founded the Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born in 1950. In July 1951 she was arrested for conspiracy to overthrow the government with bail set to $100,000. Under the Smith Act of 1940, advocacy for Marxism or Leninism was equated with advocating for the overthrow of the US government. She and other communists were arrested under the law. Chernin was sentenced five years in prison, and subpoenaed to identify conspirators to the House Un-American Committee, which she refused. She was threatened with denaturalization and deportation by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, but the process was abandoned for lack of evidence. In 1957, the Supreme Court overturned Chernin's conviction, deeming the Smith Act of 1940 unconstitutional. ==References== Category:1901 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Socialism in the United States Category:American activists Category:Communism in the United States Category:American Marxists Category:People with acquired American citizenship ","title":"Rose Chernin"},{"id":"56750933","text":"Paco Sanz may refer to: *Paco Sanz (actor), Spanish actor *Paco Sanz (footballer) (born 1972), Spanish footballer *Paco Sanz (sport shooter), Spanish sport shooter ","title":"Paco Sanz"},{"id":"56750936","text":"Volker von Alzey (right) in combat against the Bernese monk Islan.

He also participated in a Freedom Ride that started on May 17, 1961, and travelled from Nashville to Birmingham. In a 1985 interview with Blackside Inc., which produced Eyes on the Prize, Leonard elaborated his experience on the Freedom Ride. When the Greyhound bus arrived at the terminal in Montgomery, he recalled \\"the Klan [came] through with their guns and their robes and everything\\", but the Freedom Riders felt at ease because they were being escorted by police. As soon as they reached the terminal in Birmingham, he noticed the police had suddenly vanished and the terminal looked deserted and eerie. He said that after he noticed the police were gone, \\"all of a sudden, just like, whoosh, magic, white people, sticks and bricks [appeared]\\". The riders were trapped; the bus was surrounded. There was a debate about whether or not to exit the back of the bus so that, \\" ...it wouldn't be so bad,\\" or to exit the front of the bus and \\"...take what was coming [to them].\\" Jim Zwerg, a white rider, decided to exit the bus first before everyone else and receive the full brutality of the mob. Leonard believes that Zwerg saved him and the other blacks on that bus. He stated in the Blackside Inc. interview: \\"I think that's what saved me, Bernard Lafayette, and Allen Cason 'cause Jim Zwerg walked off the bus...and they [the white mob] pulled him in...it's...like they didn't even see the rest of us.\\" After exiting the front of the bus unrecognized, Leonard, Lafayette, and Cason escaped and headed to Fred Shuttlesworth's house in Birmingham to seek safety and shelter. == Personal life == Leonard married Joy Reagon, who was also a Freedom Rider. ==Other experiences in the movement== That same night, after participating in the Freedom Ride, there was a rally at Abernathy's church in Birmingham. All the members of the ride, including Leonard, Lafayette, and Cason, attended the rally. They were cautious because they had heard that the Ku Klux Klan was hunting them like wanted men even though \\"we [the riders] were the victims.\\" After hearing this, the riders went into the church to hide or disguise themselves. Someone suggested hiding in the choir, and \\"...[the riders] took off and ran up to the choir and put on little robes and started signing...[the Klan] came in and looked, didn't see [them], and they left.\\" On May 24, 1961, a few days after the previous Freedom Ride, Leonard and other riders boarded a bus to participate in another Freedom Ride headed for Jackson, Mississippi. There were a lot of police at Jackson's bus terminal. Leonard and the others were allowed to go through the white portion of the bus station, which was rare in Mississippi. After the black riders successfully walked through the white side of the station, the riders were told to continue walking straight into the police car and were escorted to jail. The next day, the riders were sent to court to be sentenced. When attorney Jack Young got up to defend the riders, the judge turned his body to face the wall behind him. When the attorney finished, the local judge turned back around and without a second thought banged his gavel and sentenced the men to 60 days in Parchman State Penitentiary.

She graduated from Baylor Female College with a Bachelor of Arts degree, and attended the New York School of Interior Decoration before receiving a Master of Arts degree from Columbia University in 1940. She began her teaching career as an assistant in her alma mater's art department in 1933; from 1924 until 1931 she was an instructor, and from 1932 until 1944 she headed the department. Upon retirement from the college she studied at the University of Pennsylvania, which led to her licensing as an occupational therapist in 1945. In that year she began work as a therapist at the Old Farms Convalescent Hospital in Avon, Connecticut, continuing for two years. In 1947 she took a position as chief occupational therapist at the Veterans Administration hospital in Temple, and two years later she moved to Houston to occupy the same role, remaining there until 1953. She was active in state and national associations for her profession. Lacy later returned to Temple, where she died. She is buried in that city's Hillcrest Cemetery, along with her husband, Floyd. == Artwork == Lacy was a member of numerous artistic organizations during her career, including the Southern States Art League and the Texas Fine Arts Association. In 1939 she was one of eight women who founded the Printmakers Guild, later called Texas Printmakers, to challenge the male-dominated Lone Star Printmakers; the others were Bertha Landers, Stella LaMond, Mary Lightfoot, Verda Ligon, Blanche McVeigh, Coreen May Spellman, and Lura Ann Taylor. From 1942 until 1944 she was president of the Texas Art Education Association. She exhibited her work widely, both in Texas and elsewhere in the United States, and in 1943 was the subject of a one-woman show of prints at the Dallas Museum of Art. A scholarship in her honor at her alma mater, today the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor, was established by former pupil Marjorie Hamilton Gillies. Three of Lacy's prints, the linocut First Monday of c. 1935–1940 and the lithographs Left Side of Tracks, of 1940, and the undated Summer Blankness, are in the collection of the National Gallery of Art; they are part of the donation made to the museum by Reba and Dave Williams of the Print Research Foundation in 2009. ==References== Category:1901 births Category:1994 deaths Category:American women painters Category:American women printmakers Category:20th-century American painters Category:20th-century American printmakers Category:20th-century American women artists Category:Occupational therapists Category:People from Temple, Texas Category:Painters from Texas Category:University of Mary Hardin–Baylor alumni Category:Columbia University alumni Category:University of Pennsylvania alumni Category:University of Mary Hardin–Baylor faculty ","title":"Lucile Land Lacy"},{"id":"56751000","text":"David Stavens is an American entrepreneur, scientist and co-founder and CEO of Nines, a Silicon Valley teleradiology practice. He was co-founder and CEO of Udacity and a co-creator of Stanley, the winning car of the second driverless car competition of the DARPA Grand Challenge. Stavens has published in the fields of robotics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. == Early life and education == Stavens grew up in Sioux City, Iowa and attended Princeton University, graduating with a B.S.E. in Computer Science, Magna Cum Laude, at age 19. He is an alumnus of Stanford University's Computer Science department for both M.S. and Ph.D. programs. His Ph.D. was advised by Sebastian Thrun. == Autonomous cars == Stavens was a co-creator on Stanford’s autonomous car team. The team built Stanley, the winner of the second driverless car competition of the DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005. Stanley has been on display in the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American History and National Air and Space Museum. Academic publications from the team (by Stavens along with Hendrik Dahlkamp, Adrian Kaehler, Sebastian Thrun, Gary Bradski) state that they applied self-supervised learning, to detect drivable surfaces in the desert for self-driving cars which led the vehicle to win the race. Stavens's publications state that they apply the concept of self- supervised learning to autonomous driving with the benefit of avoiding human intervention. His dissertation states that this self-supervised learning approach has the potential to improve human driving performance. . The Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab awarded Stavens a gold medal \\"For his groundbreaking contributions to the winning DARPA Grand Challenge vehicle....\\" The Stanford autonomous driving team ultimately joined Google as the foundation of Google's self-driving car team (Waymo). Stavens also made contributions to the 2009 NASA Mars Rover Mission. == Indoor WiFi maps == Stavens also worked on research at Stanford on indoor localization using WiFi signal strength measurements. The goal was to create a system capable of delivering GPS-quality localization indoors, where GPS satellites do not function. He and Jesse Levinson were winners of the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship in 2009 which provided $100,000 in funding for the research. He published the research along with Joseph Huang, David Millman, Morgan Quigley, Sebastian Thrun, and Alok Aggarwal, stating that it produced excellent results in practice. Joseph Huang went on to found an indoor localization start-up, WifiSLAM, that was acquired by Apple. == Online education == Stavens co- founded and was CEO of Udacity. Udacity helped popularize the concept of the offering college courses for free as Massive open online course's (MOOC), intended to make high-quality education accessible and nearly free around the entire world via Internet. As CEO, he grew the company to 160,000 students and 20 employees. Udacity was valued at $1 billion in 2015.

Mosley (1907-1969) was a self-taught photojournalist who extensively documented the everyday activities of the African-American community in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for over 30 years, a period including both World War II and the civil rights movement. His work was published widely in newspapers and magazines including The Philadelphia Tribune, The Pittsburgh Courier and Jet magazine. Mosley has been called a \\"cultural warrior\\" for preserving a record of African American life in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania, one which combats \\"negative stereotypes and false interpretations of African American history and culture\\". More than 300,000 of Mosley's photographs are included in the Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection at Temple University. Exhibitions of his work have been shown at the Philadelphia International Airport and the Woodmere Art Museum. ==Early life== John W. Mosley was born in 1907 in Lumberton, North Carolina. His father was a Baptist minister and a barber. Mosley played football in high school. He began teaching himself photography with a simple box camera in the 1920s. He studied at Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 1934, Mosley moved to Philadelphia as part of the Great Migration. There, he obtained a job as a professional photographer at Barksdale Photography Studio. He later had a darkroom and photographic studio at the Christian Street YMCA. ==Photography== Mosley flourished in his career as a photographer from the 1930s to the 1960s. He was known to photograph as many as four events a day, seven days a week. He traveled around Philadelphia on public transit, carrying his cameras and other equipment. Mosley shot in black and white film. He used a large-format Graflex Speed Graphic camera. and a medium-format Rollieflex. Proud of his heritage, Mosley chose to portray the black community positively at family, social, and cultural events that were part of daily life. He photographed individuals and families at weddings, picnics, churches, segregated beaches, sporting events, concerts, galas, and civil rights protests. During a time of racism and segregation, he emphasized the achievements of black celebrities, athletes, and political leaders. Among those he photographed were bandleader Duke Ellington, trumpeter Cootie Williams, basketball player Wilt Chamberlain, tennis player Ora Washington, Paul Leroy Robeson, Billy Eckstine, Billie Holiday, Martin Luther King, Jr., Cecil B. Moore, Marian Anderson, Eleanor Roosevelt, and President Richard Nixon, to name only a few. Locations he captured included Nixon's Grand Theatre at Broad Street and Montgomery Avenue; the Earle Theatre at 1049 Market Street; Chicken Bone Beach in Atlantic City, Glamour Row, and Club Harlem. The Pyramid Club was one of many centers of African-American culture and life in Philadelphia which he documented, working as the club's staff photographer for many years. He published an annual album of photographs for the club, the Pictorial Album of the Pyramid Club. He was also the official photographer of the First African Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia. Mosley was one the first black Americans to be a syndicated photographer. His work was widely published in East-coast African-American newspapers such as The Philadelphia Tribune the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin, and The Pittsburgh Courier and appeared in Jet magazine. ==Legacy== The Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection at Temple University contains more than 300,000 photographs taken by Mosley. Blockson's private collection of materials relating to the history and culture of those of African descent was one of the largest in the United States. Blockson acquired the Mosley photos from Clarence Still and Teresa Still Mosley, John W. Mosley's wife, in 1985. The curator of the Blockson Collection, Diane Turner, emphasizes the importance of Mosley's work in combating \\"negative stereotypes and false interpretations of African American history and culture in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania\\": Charles L. Blockson wrote a biography of Mosley's life, The journey of John W. Mosley (1992). The exhibition A Celebration of African- American Life in Philadelphia, 1930's - 1960's: Selected Photographs by John W. Mosley was shown at the Philadelphia International Airport in 2012. A retrospective of Mosley's work, A Million Faces: The Photography of John W.

Within the ecclesiastical order of the Eastern Orthodox Church, territory of Iraq traditionally belongs to patrimonial jurisdiction of the Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East. The Patriarchate has a diocese in Iraq, the Eastern Orthodox Archdiocese of Baghdad, headed since 2014 by metropolitan Ghattas Hazim.His Eminence, the Most Reverend Metropolitan Ghattas (Hazim) ==History== The early history of Eastern Orthodoxy in the region of Mesopotamia (within the territory of modern-day Iraq) was marked by frequent Byzantine-Sasanian wars, fought between the 5th and 7th century. During much of that period, major part of Mesopotamia was controlled by the Sassanian Empire (Persia). Official Persian religion was Zoroastrianism, while Christianity was occasionally tolerated or persecuted, depending on the current religious or political climate. Attitudes of Persian rulers towards their Christian subjects was affected mainly by current political relations with the Byzantine Empire, seen by Persians as the rivaling power with considerable and worrying influence on Christian communities within Persian borders. Since Byzantine government generally favored Eastern Orthodoxy over other Christian denominations, local communities of Eastern Orthodox Christians within the Persian borders were often treated with suspicion by Persian authorities, who were slightly more tolerant to other Christian communities. During that period, relations between different Christian groups in Mesopotamia were marked by frequent theological disputes and internal divisions. Religious and political pressure led to the decline of Eastern Orthodoxy in Mesopotamia. During that period, Eastern Orthodox patriarchs of Antioch, centered within the Byzantine borders, had great difficulties in maintaining ties with remaining Eastern Orthodox communities in Mesopotamia. By the time of the Arab conquest of Mesopotamia in the 7th century, Eastern Orthodoxy in that region was reduced to small minority. During the period of Arab and later Turkish rule in Mesopotamia, from the 7th century up to the end of the First World War, communities of Eastern Orthodox Christians in the region remained under ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch. After the creation of modern Iraq, legal position of Christian communities in the country was much improved. In 1969, Eastern Orthodox Christians in Iraq got a new and able leader, metropolitan Constantine Papastephanou of Baghdad, sent to them by the Patriarchate of Antioch.Memory Eternal: Metropolitan Constantine (Papastephanou) During his long tenure, internal organization of the Baghdad Archdiocese was much improved. On the other hand, later devastating wars ad conflict in Iraq greatly affected the entire population of the country, including Eastern Orthodox Christians and their religious institutions. In 2014, metropolitan Constantine retired and was succeeded by Ghattas Hazim as the new metropolitan of Baghdad. Since the territory of his Archdiocese were severely affected by previous conflicts, upon arriving in Baghdad new metropolitan was faced with many inherited problems, starting from the fact that over 90% of the Eastern Orthodox Christians in the country were still displaced, as a result of previous wars and internal conflicts in Iraq. Because of that, official seat of the diocese only formally remains in Baghdad, while administrative headquarters are located in neighbouring Kuwait, territorially also under jurisdiction of the Baghdad Archdiocese.Interview with Metropolitan Ghattas Hazim: 90% of Orthodox Christians in Iraq displaced ==See also== * Christianity in Iraq * Oriental Orthodoxy in Iraq * Persecution of Christians in Iraq * Human rights in Iraq * Freedom of religion in Iraq ==ReferencesSources== * * ==External links== * European Centre for Law and Justice (2011): The Persecution of Oriental Christians, what answer from Europe?

Pick was injured in 2010 while serving in Afghanistan, losing his right leg. As part of his rehabilitation he was encouraged to try various sports. He subsequently found success in world para-snowboarding events, including representing his country in the Winter Olympics in his sport and as a flag bearer. ==Biography== Pick is originally from Cambridge, United Kingdom. He lost his right leg in January 2010 while serving with the British Army in Afghanistan. He had joined the Royal Anglian Regiment straight after leaving school and was 18 when he stood on an improvised explosive device (IED). The explosion caused significant damage to his leg and doctors battled to save it until Pick decided in August 2011 to have it amputated below the knee. While recovering in hospital Pick watched snowboarding for the first time. The charity Blesma gave him the chance to try wakeboarding and snowboarding and he discovered his talent on the snow in Colorado. Pick was nominated by Blesma and subsequently won the Sporting Excellence prize at the Soldiering On Awards in 2017. ==Career== Pick won a silver medal in the banked slalom SB-LL2 event at the 2017 Para Snowboard World Championships held at the Big White Ski Resort in Canada, followed by two podium finishes at the World Cup in La Molina, Spain. He represented Great Britain at the 2018 Winter Paralympics, competing in Banked Slalom and SBX events alongside Ben Moore and James Barnes-Miller. Snowboarding was first added to the Paralympics in Sochi 2014, with 2018 being the first time that Great Britain has been represented. Pick describes his pride for being selected: \\"I feel honoured to be among the first British athletes competing in snowboard\\", as well as describing himself as the \\"least experienced snowboarder\\" in his category. Pick was chosen to carry the flag at the opening ceremony, leading the 17-strong team out in the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium.

Despite being discovered only 10 days after interstellar asteroid 1I/'Oumuamua, it was not announced until March 2018 (along with C/2018 C2 (Lemmon), which was believed to be another hyperbolic asteroid at the time) as its orbit is not strongly hyperbolic beyond most Oort Cloud comets. Based on the absolute magnitude of 10.6, it may measure tens of kilometers in diameter. As of August 2018, there is only 1 hyperbolic asteroid known, ʻOumuamua, but hundreds of hyperbolic comets are known. == Orbit == Although C/2017 U7's orbit is no longer bound to the Solar System, unlike ʻOumuamua, it is probably not an interstellar object. It had an inbound orbital period of roughly 800000 years. Its point of origin is inclined only 3.5 degrees from the galactic plane, but its aphelion points roughly to the Galactic anticenter, so if it did somehow originate from interstellar space with a typical Solar System velocity (which is highly unlikely) it would have been travelling on an unusual orbit directly into the galactic core from beyond the Sun's orbit around the Milky Way. A barycentric orbit of C/2017 U7, however, shows that it is only a very distant Solar System object, approaching as far as 16,000 ± 1,000 AU from the Sun, around the distance of the Oort Cloud. It had an inbound orbital period of roughly 740,000 years until the current approach to the Solar System, where perturbations show it on an extremely weak hyperbolic trajectory after leaving the planetary region of the Solar System. The barycentric eccentricity increases above 1 starting with an epoch of July 2022, reaching 1.0000088 once it gets beyond planetary perturbations. , C/2017 U7 is inbound from the Sun. C/2017 U7 makes closest approach to the Sun on 10 September 2019 at a distance of 6.4 AU (outside of Jupiter's orbit). Due to the orbital inclination, on 18 May 2020, the asteroid will be about from Jupiter, generating a peak heliocentric eccentricity at 1.003. 2017U7-skypath.pngPath across sky 2017U7-orbit.pngHyperbolic trajectory through solar system == Notes  References  External links == * Category:Hyperbolic comets # Category:Extended centaurs Category:Damocloids 20171029 ","title":"C/2017 U7"},{"id":"56751257","text":"Do What You Wanna Do is the fifth studio album by the Masters Apprentices, released in November 1988 on Virgin Records. It was the group's first album in 17 years since A Toast To Panama Red. ==Background== In the early 1980s there was a revival of interest in the Masters Apprentices due partly to rock historian Glenn A. Baker, who featured the band for his Rock & Roll Trivia Show on Sydney radio's Triple J, which in turn led to the release of a definitive compilation LP, Hands of Time by Baker's Raven Records in 1981. The classic Burgess, Ford, Keays and Wheatley line-up reformed in August 1987 for a \\"Back to the 1960s\\" special on the popular TV variety show Hey Hey It's Saturday. It marked the first time all four had played together since Wheatley had left in late 1971. They undertook a reunion tour during 1988 and released an album, Do What You Wanna Do, featuring new material and new versions of their earlier songs, from which they lifted the single \\"Birth of the Beat\\". ==Content== The album's first side contains new recordings of original material and two re-recordings of \\"Turn Up Your Radio\\" and \\"Because I Love You\\" (the band's most popular songs). The perennial \\"Because I Love You\\" also gained new prominence around that time via its use in a series of advertisements for a well-known brand of jeans; the revamped version of \\"Because I Love You\\" peaked at No. 30 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Singles Charts. Side B is live recordings taken from the 1988 reunion tour. ==Track listing== All songs written by Doug Ford and Jim Keays, except where noted. == Personnel == ;The Masters Apprentices * Doug Ford \\\\- acoustic guitar, electric guitar, vocals * Jim Keays \\\\- vocals, harmonica * Colin Burgess \\\\- drums, percussion * Glenn Wheatley \\\\- bass * Gavin Webb \\\\- bass on live recordings ;Other musicians * Massive Appendages \\\\- backing vocals * Adrian McNeil \\\\- sarod * Joe Camilleri \\\\- saxophone ;Production team * Producer \\\\- Peter Blyton * Engineers (studio) \\\\- Adam Quaife, Angus Davidson * Engineers (live) \\\\- Ernie Rose * Assistant engineer \\\\- Tony Salter * Mastering energineer \\\\- Alan Parsons ;Artwork * Millennium \\\\- artwork == References == ;General * Note: limited preview for on-line version. * * Note: Archived [on-line] copy has limited functionality. * Note: [on-line] version was established at White Room Electronic Publishing Pty Ltd in 2007 and was expanded from the 2002 edition.

This is approximately , by road, northeast of Kampala, the national capital and largest city of Uganda. ==Overview== In Uganda, obstetric fistula is a major public health problem with over 140,000 women living with fistula. At least 1,900 new cases of fistula are registered in the country, every year. The hospital sits on a piece of land, purchased with money from the Uganda Fistula Fund. The objective of the hospital is to provide health services for obstetric fistula and other child birth-related injuries. It is modeled after the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital, founded by Australian Obstetrician and Gynecologist, Catherine Hamlin. Terrewode, the Soroti-based non-profit, has been active against obstetric fistula in the Teso sub-region since 2002. More than 4,000 women have been supported by Terrewode in collaboration with the Uganda Ministry of Health, United Nations Population Fund, Amref Health Africa and Gender Health. ==Construction== The first phase of construction is budgeted to cost US$1.6 million (approx. USh5.8 billion), and expected to last eight months. The International Fistula Alliance is funding this phase. Gabikan Engineering Limited Construction Company was selected as the contractor for phase 1, consisting of the main hospital block. The second phase, consisting the out-patient clinic, maternity department and staff quarters, will follow after the first, allowing the hospital to provide obstetric services. ==Fundraising== In September 2017, the Speaker of the Uganda's parliament, received US$1 million from Ugandan diasporians, donated towards the construction of this hospital. ==See also== *Hospitals in Uganda *Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital ==References *Website of the Association for the Rehabilitation and Re-orientation of Women for Development (TERREWODE) Category:Hospitals in Uganda Category:Soroti District Category:Eastern Region, Uganda ","title":"Terrewode Women's Community Hospital"},{"id":"56751329","text":"Pavao Špirančić or Sperančić (c. 1400 – 1463) was a Croatian nobleman and the Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia from 1459 to 1463. In the sources he is often mentioned with the nickname Horvat. He was appointed as Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia by Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus. With Pavao's and Frankopan family's help, the king Matthias tried to consolidate his power in the areas southern of mount Velebit, where Republic of Venice and Ottoman empire posed threat. ==Biography== Pavao Špirančić was born in the first half of the 15th century in Croatia which was in that time under the rule of Hungarian king. In the 1459, he was appointed as Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia by Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus. Špirančić tried to gain support of Republic of Venice and make them an ally against Ottoman empire which posed great threat for his territories and Hungarian kingdom. His attempts were unsuccessful, mainly because of his conquest of city of Klis and surrounding towns and areas, which made him a threat for Venetians and some other Croatian nobles who had their possessions there. He was also perceived as a threat by Bosnian king, who went to the Venetians and proclaimed him as an enemy. He was appointed again as Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia in 1463, together with Stjepan III Frankopan. In the same year, neighboring Kingdom of Bosnia was conquered by Ottoman empire. Last Bosnian king Stephen Tomašević was killed and his wife Marija fled to the Croatian littoral where she was captured by Pavao who was enemy of her husband. As Pavao didn't get the help from Hungarian king, he was forced to ask Venetians for help. Later in the same year, his forces were defeated by Ottoman army and he was captured by the Ottomans where he died in captivity. Marija used that opportunity and fled to the Venetians. Pavao's wife Margareta was mentioned in the sources in the years after as \\"Banica\\" or \\"Princess of Cetina and Klis\\", but in 1466, Klis was taken by Croatian ban Ivan Thuz of Lak.

Instead the album artwork for Beyondless was released, and the audio was released on YouTube. == Critical reception == The track received widespread acclaim from contemporary music critics. John Norris of Billboard described the track as a \\"driving standout\\" on the album, and the music as \\"Tusk-worthy fanfare of horns\\". Norris overall described the song as a bold move from the band. Evan Rytlewski of Pitchfork called the horns and jazz influence of the song \\"splashy\\", and felt their performance was bombastic. Rytlewski felt the track allows Iceage \\"let their pheromones fly, flaunting their seductive new sound like it’s a brand new sports car\\". In a more mixed review, Stereogum's Gabriela Tully Claymore felt the song was a bit drawn out, but that Sky Ferreira's vocals were a welcome addition. ==References External links == * * Iceage - Pain Killer (feat.

Ren is a prominent, international advocate for children's brain cancer research and owner of a long-standing crane hire business in Townsville, North Queensland. After the death of his daughter Amy, from a brain stem cancer known as Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), Ren founded the independent Australian arm of The Cure Starts Now https://thecurestartsnow.org/get-involved/chapters/australia . In 2012 and 2017 Ren was nominated for Australian of the Year award in recognition of his efforts to fund research into holistic cancer cures, via targeting the most challenging paediatric brain tumours. He was awarded the Rotary International Harris Medal in 2012, Lauren Hill Full Court Press Award in 2017 and Pride of Australia Medal in 2018. == Early life == Ren's family are direct descendants of pioneering convict settlers, John WarbyJohn Warby and Sarah Bently. He is the first born of Ken and Marie (née McMahon) Pedersen in 1971, Ren's family owned Australia's second oldest continually operating hotel, The Royal Hotel, in Herberton, North Queensland. In 1975, following an unfortunate marriage breakdown, Marie moved to Atherton with her two sons. The family relocated to Ayr, North Qld, in 1978, where Ren completed school at St Francis primary school and later, Ayr High. Ren says his experiences at St Francis Primary School could only be described as \\"Humiliating... But the cruel, heartless teachers unwittingly created in me a resilience to brutality and an elevated empathy for children in need.\\" == Career == After successfully completing Senior, Ren immediately left home and became a qualified Horticulturalist with the Burdekin Shire Council. Moving to Townsville around 1990, Ren started a small landscape gardening business, before accepting an offer to experience professional Rugby League with the Canterbury Bulldogs, then Wests, soon after. Upon arrival in Sydney early February 1992, Ren also trialled for the famous Randwick Rugby Union club under the pseudonym of \\"John Keller\\" and was graded after scoring four tries in a single game during an Open club trial. The offer to play Union was declined. After serious knee and facial injuries and major operations in 1992 and 1993, Ren was convinced to re-establish first grade credentials with the NRL feeder club Newtown Jets. Although attaining solid employment in Sydney at Port Botany Container Depot,https://www.portauthoritynsw.com.au/port-botany/ Ren returned to Townsville by 1994, disillusioned with sitting in the stands from injury and fed up with \\"city life\\". After immediately gaining employment as a Stevedore in Townsville, Ren played centre in University's unsuccessful Grand Final tilt on 18 September 1994. Ren credits his greatest achievement in Rugby League as making two complete sets of six tackles in a single game against the Burdekin, earlier that same season. Ren retired from League soon after, but made a few, uninspiring attempts to rekindle past glories in early 2000s. Eventually making \\"A\\" Grade with Teachers Wests Rugby Union and University Rugby League sides in the early 2000s. The heart was strong, but the legs weary. Ceasing employment at the port in 2004, Patriot Crane HirePatriot Crane Hire was formed in 2005. Ren has travelled extensively and was married to Sharon (née Moretto) on 5 October 1996, in Central Park, New York City, U.S. They have three children, oldest Jack born in 1997 and Riley rattling the eardrums in 2012. The legacy of middle daughter, Amy Pedersen (2000–2009), has inspired a nation. Following the death of his beloved princess, Ren formed The Cure Starts Now (Australia) in efforts to honour a promise to Amy that he \\"Would never give up!\\" and give future brain tumour children, both in Australia and internationally, a shot at life. == Charity work == The Cure Starts Now was founded in 2007 by Cincinnati's Keith and Brooke Desserich with Ren Pedersen director of the independent Australian branch of this amazing international organization. * March 2009 – The Cure Starts Now (Australia) established by Ren Pedersen. * June 2009 – Board and formal structures implemented.

It was first observed on 5 February 2018 by the Mount Lemmon Survey conducted at the Mount Lemmon Observatory near Tucson, Arizona, in the United States. The discovery was announced on 4 March 2018 along with another hyperbolic object, A/2017 U7. Based on the absolute magnitude of 15.1, it may measure several kilometers in diameter. On 22 March 2018 it was determined to be a hyperbolic comet. == Orbit == Heliocentric eccentricity from 2000–2035 which is strongly influenced by Jupiter's 12 year orbital period. The path of A/2018 C2 across the sky with annual retrograde loops While near perihelion, A/2018 C2's heliocentric orbit is not bound to the Solar System, unlike ʻOumuamua, it is probably not an interstellar object. The heliocentric eccentricity drops below 1 starting with an epoch of July 2022, when it is 12.9 AU from the Sun, making the orbit bound to the Sun before it leaves the planetary region of the Solar System. The more stable barycentric orbit of A/2018 C2, shows that it is only a very distant small Solar System body, approaching as far as 20,000 ± 80,000 AU from the Sun, around the distance of the Oort Cloud. It had an orbital period of roughly 1 million years until the current approach to the Solar System, where perturbations will shorten the orbit drastically to 2,900 ± 1,700 AU, with an orbital period of 55,000 years. These numbers will become better refined as the observation arc becomes longer than 30 days. , A/2018 C2 is inbound from the Sun. A/2018 C2 makes closest approach to the Sun on 2 June 2018 at a distance of 1.9 AU (outside the orbit of Mars). Since this object out gassed generating a cometary coma while near the inner solar system, it was reclassified as a hyperbolic comet. ==NotesReferences External links == * Category:Hyperbolic comets # Category:Extended centaurs Category:Damocloids Category:Astronomical objects discovered in 2018 ","title":"C/2018 C2 (Lemmon)"},{"id":"56751441","text":"Edhie Baskoro Yudhoyono (born 24 November 1980 in Bandung, West Java) is a politician and member of House of Representatives, Indonesia.

The Citizens of Poland (, verbatim Citizens of the Republic of Poland, ORP) is an informal civic movement in Poland engaged in pro-democracy actions and anti-fascist movement, opposed to the actions of the government led by the Law and Justice (PiS) party. Citizens of Poland practice non- violent civil disobedience. Citizens of Poland organize protests against monthly gatherings lead by Jarosław Kaczyński, the leader of the Law and Justice party, ostensibly to commemorate the victims of the Smoleńsk airplane catastrophe, protesting against the claim it was a political assassination promoted during these meetings. During one of their demonstrations a Solidarity-era hero Władysław Frasyniuk was accused of assaulting a policeman and later detained. ORP were actively engaged in protests against unconstitutional justice reforms in July 2017. They block extreme right-wing rallies and demand delegalization of organizations promoting rasism and xenophobia. In January 2018 the movement addressed the opposition parties in Poland demanding open primary elections before regional elections of 2018. The movement established a network of support, ObyPomoc, for those prosecuted for pro-democracy or anti-fascist activities, arranging pro-bono legal aid. They collect and broadcast information on the police actions and cases against pro- democracy or anti-fascist activists. == History of the movement == On 5 February 2016, in front of the Presidential Palace in Warsaw, 4 people–Tadeusz Jakrzewski, Paweł Kasprzak, Paweł Wrabec and Tobiasz Budzyński–accused Andrzej Duda, President of the Republic of Poland, of having violated the constitution. They did this by holding up banners containing the words: \\"We hereby announce that Andrzej Duda is a liar and perjurer\\". They criticized the pardon granted by the President to Mariusz Kamiński, they appealed to the President to take \\"oaths from lawfully elected judges of the Constitutional Tribunal\\". Prior to this, they sent a letter entitled \\"We renounce obedience to a power which violates the Constitution of the Republic of Poland\\". The first counter-monthly demonstration of Obywatele RP was held on 10 March 2016. At that time, this was in the form of pickets organised alongside the monthly celebrations. On 10 March 2017, activists of the Obywatele RP Movement tried for the first time to block the Smolensk monthly. This was tied to the fact that the Polish Parliament (the Sejm) changed the Law on Assemblies, giving priority for reservation of a venue to cyclical events, such as the Smolensk monthlies. That is when 7 participants of the movement—Paweł Kasprzak, Tadeusz Jakrzewski, Paweł Wrabec, Wojciech Kinasiewicz, Monika Dąbrowska, Michał Korczak, Hanna Frem and Marek Madej-Sierski—sat on the street blocking the march. On 10 June 2017, Władysław Frasyniuk sat down together with activists from Obywatele RP on the route of the so-called Smolensk monthly. There was pushing and shoving by the police and in the end, police officers carried the counter-demonstrators on to the side. W. Frasyniuk later said in the media that \\"the policeman was rather aggressive\\" and that citizens have the right to demonstrate. The movement organises protests against organisations which propagate fascism and nationalism. On 26 February 2017, representatives of the movement, together with Antifa, protested against the march of the so-called Cursed soldiers, the participants of which held portraits of, among others, Romuald Rajs \\"Bury\\" who was responsible for committing murderous acts on the local civilian population. During the pilgrimage of Polish football fans to the Jasna Góra Monastery on 13 January 2018, about a dozen people from the Obywatele RP movement and Demokratyczna RP (Democratic Republic of Poland), unfolded banners with inscriptions \\"Christianity is not hatred\\", \\"Humanity is my Country\\" and \\"Here are the borders of decency\\". They were attacked by the football fans on the pastures surrounding the monastery. Obywatele RP together with Front Europejski (European Front) and Wolne Sądy (Free Courts) were architects of the \\"Europo, nie odpuszczaj\\" (Europe, don't give up) initiative, aimed at convincing the European Commission to take the Law on the Polish Supreme Court to the EU Court of Justice. The initiative involved demonstrations, petitions, and letters of support. == Goals and tasks == The movement adopted peaceful civil disobedience as a method of its actions. The movement runs a group called ObyPomoc (To Help)—people that provide legal support to the movement. ObyPomoc publishes periodical reports based on submitted information regarding court cases against the demonstrators. On 19 November 2017, during the press conference organised by representatives of Obywatele RP, the Warsaw Women’s Strike, Citizens in Solidarity in Action and ODnowa, activists presented a report \\"on the actions of State forces against persons objecting against the unconstitutional acts of those in power, the logging of the Białowieża Forest and the fascism in public life in Poland\\". In their opinion, the police is using excessive force against civilian people for their participation in legal protests, and does not react, inter alia, during the \\"Independence March\\" to people carrying banners bearing radical slogans. In January 2018, the movement approached the \\"coalition of democratic parties\\" demanding to hold \\"open primary local self-government elections\\": \\"We hear from some parties, social movements and media that »first, the PiS Party needs to be removed from power, and only after that, to deal with other matters«. We tell them today: we want democracy now! That is why we demand a coalition of »democratic« parties, and holding open primaries preceding the local self- government elections. Open, meaning such during which parties let the voters decide about the lists\\" – wrote P. Kasprzak in the Rzeczpospolita daily newspaper. == Foundation Free Citizens of Poland == Obywatele RP are a movement without formal structures. There is a foundation Wolni Obywatele RP (Free Citizens of Poland) established by core members of the movement, tied with Obywatele RP and gathering funds for some of their actions. Poland's interior ministry has filed an application to court to replace the board of the foundation, accusing it of \\"inciting unlawful activity\\". The hearing is in September 2018. == Participants == The informal leader of the Movement is Paweł Kasprzak. Other individuals connected with Obywatele RP are: Ukraine specialist Kinga Kamińska, journalists Piotr Pytlakowski and Wojciech Fusek. == Awards == The organization was awarded the 2017 Zbigniew Hołda Award. == See also == * Liberalism in Poland == References Category:Democracy movements Category:Politics of Poland Category:Political opposition organizations Category:Political organisations based in Poland Category:Protests in Poland ","title":"Citizens of Poland"},{"id":"56751483","text":"Scott L.

During the reign of Thrasamund, for unspecified reasons, the Vandals launched an expedition against Cabaon. Although not himself a Christian, the Moorish leader then decided, according to Procopius, to send spies on the backs of the Vandals to repair the damage that the Arian fanatics would cause to the buildings of the worship. The ensuing battle in an unknown place was a disaster for Thrasamund's troops, baffled by Berber tactics. In a pattern that would be repeated later, they took shelter behind a rampart of camels and fought on foot, essentially making use of ranged weapons that decimated the Vandals squadrons. The battle seemed to be a resounding success for the Berbers, but the immediate consequences were unknown because Procopius never mentioned Cabaon again, and no link was established between that battle and the long Moorish Wars later. The episode, however, had a rather rich historiographic posterity. The Byzantine compilers were fascinated by the paradoxical respect shown by Cabaon towards Catholic worship; the latter of which interested Evagrius, and led him to copy the passage from Procopius in his Ecclesiastical History. == References == Category:6th-century Berber people Category:Berber rulers ","title":"Cabaon"},{"id":"56751513","text":"Samuel Tefera (born 23 October 1999) is an Ethiopian middle distance runner.

The building was constructed for the Kawneer Manufacturing Company founder, Swedish born cabinet-maker, architect, inventor, machinist, and businessman Francis John Plym (1869–1940).

In 2006 he moved to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, returning to the State Department in 2009 as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Nonproliferation. Van Diepen was a major contributor to a 2007 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on the nuclear weapons program of Iran, which some said underestimated Iranian nuclear capabilities and which was criticized by neoconservatives as being politicized and reflective of former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell's preference for negotiation over confrontation with Iran over nuclear issues. The charges of politicization against Van Diepen and the other report authors were rejected by Vice President of the United States Dick Cheney and by Flynt Leverett. Until late 2011, Van Diepen spent two years as acting Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Non- Proliferation, but was never nominated to the post on a permanent basis due to doubts by the Obama presidency as to whether the United States Senate would confirm his appointment owing to continuing concerns by some Republican senators over the 2007 NIE.

The bridge connects Borgo Antico (Old Town) island to the Borgo Nuovo (new Town) peninsula. The canal was excavated in 1481 as part of the defenses of Taranto. A steel and wood bridge was first built across the canal in 1886. The present steel bridge was built in 1958. Officially titled the Ponte di San Francesco di Paola, the bridge has two swing spans that pivot near the banks of the canal to meet in the middle of the canal. When open, the halves are parallel to the embankment, leaving the width of the canal clear for passage. The bridge is a Taranto landmark. The canal is long and wide. The first bridge was hydraulically operated using water stored in the Castello Aragonese. The 1958 replacement was designed by the National Society of Savigliano and built in the former Tosi shipyard in Taranto. It was inaugurated on 10 March 1958 by Italian president Giovanni Gronchi. The new bridge is electrically operated from control stations on each embankment. The sequence of operation requires the Old Town span to open to 45 degrees first, then the New Town span opens 90 degrees, and finally the Old Town span opens to its full 90 degrees.

Originally pressed on the same disc as the game, Quake was otherwise commercially unavailable until its release on vinyl in September of 2020. Trent Reznor, the sole member of Nine Inch Nails at the time, also provided sound effects for the game. ==Recording and release== The collaboration between Nine Inch Nails and id Software occurred strictly due to a mutual admiration for each other's work; Reznor provided his services to Quake completely free of charge. A vinyl LP edition of the soundtrack was released in 2020. ==Composition and content== Aside from the first relatively driving track, Quake is a predominantly ambient soundtrack, and was Reznor's first experimentation with the genre. He would later go on to win an Academy Award for his ambient soundtrack work. The music on Quake has been described as dark, immersive, and intended to accentuate the game's oppressive tone. The music is often called \\"subtle\\", \\"disturbing\\", and \\"hair-raising\\". About the soundtrack, Reznor said, \\"it is not music, it's textures and ambiences and whirling machine noises and stuff. We tried to make the most sinister, depressive, scary, frightening kind of thing [...] It's been fun.\\" ==Critical reception== The Quake official soundtrack received positive reception, with many appreciating how the music builds upon the game's atmosphere. In his 1996 review of the game for GameSpot, Trent Ward wrote, \\"Simply put, this is the best soundtrack ever created for a computer game.\\" Ward went on to write about how the eerie sounds and unsettling background noises heighten the game's already tense atmosphere. Major Mike of GamePro said that \\"With harsh, rockin' guitar riffs, and creepy low-key synthesizers, the music goes perfectly with each level and thoroughly enhances the overall atmosphere.\\" Writing for Destructoid, Peter Glagowski said, \\"Not only did it show that the industry was moving beyond being targeted solely at children, but it pushed the action of its game into overdrive.\\" ==Track listing== All music written and performed by Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails. ===CD track listing=Vinyl release track listing=== Notes * Because the soundtrack is pressed onto the same disc as the game itself, track one is relegated to game data. * Quake's original packaging provided no official song titles.

A native of Winnsboro, Texas, where she was raised, Landers graduated from Sul Ross State Teachers College in 1931 with a bachelor's degree in art. She studied at the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center and at the Art Students League of New York, at the latter working under the tutelage of Reginald Marsh. Further lessons occurred under Olin Travis at the Art Institute of Dallas and with Henry Varnum Poor and Arnold Blanch. Long employed by the Dallas Public Library, she founded its audiovisual department in 1942. She began to be active in California in the 1930s, while still living in Dallas, and later settled in the state. In Escondido, in 1956, she founded Landers Film and Video Reviews; she died in San Diego. Landers belonged to a number of artistic organizations during her career, including the Southern States Art League, Southern Printmakers, and the Texas Fine Arts Association; she was a charter member of the National Museum of Women in the Arts. In 1939 she was one of eight women who founded the Printmakers Guild, later called Texas Printmakers, to challenge the male-dominated Lone Star Printmakers; the others were Lucile Land Lacy, Stella Lamond, Mary Lightfoot, Verda Ligon, Blanche McVeigh, Coreen Mary Spellman, and Lura Ann Taylor. During her career, she exhibited widely in Texas and California, showing work at venues elsewhere in the United States as well. In 1940 she held a one-woman show at the Dallas Museum of Art. That institution owns a gouache by her, Forgotten, as well as an etching and aquatint, Market Day, and nine lithographs. Four more prints, the 1946 screenprint Ad Infinitum and three lithographs are owned by the National Gallery of Art; they are part of the donation made to the museum by Reba and Dave Williams of the Print Research Foundation in 2009. The 1914 lithograph Mexican Funeral is held by the Library of Congress. Works by Landers may also be found in the collections of the San Antonio Museum of Art, Southern Methodist University, and the University of Texas. ==References== Category:1911 births Category:1996 deaths Category:American women painters Category:American women printmakers Category:20th-century American painters Category:20th-century American printmakers Category:20th-century American women artists Category:People from Winnsboro, Texas Category:Painters from Texas Category:Sul Ross State University alumni ","title":"Bertha Landers"},{"id":"56751778","text":"Hans Adlhoch (born 10 April 1935) is a German-born Canadian sport shooter.

The tour ran from July 18, 2017 to October 15, 2017, taking place in Japan, and commenced after the band served a series of opening acts for various bands from 2016 to 2017. == Background == After the conclusion of the Babymetal World Tour 2016: Legend Metal Resistance, the band supported Red Hot Chili Peppers, Metallica, Guns N' Roses, and Korn on their world tours as an opening act for several of their shows. On June 16, 2017, the band performed in a standalone headlining show in Los Angeles, to an audience of 4,000 people at The Palladium, where they debuted the live performance of the international exclusive song \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\". The tour has been subtitled in the band's lore as Metal Resistance Episode V. The first tour dates were announced on April 2, 2017 with shows subtitled Black Fox Festival, Red Fox Festival, Gold Fox Festival, Silver Fox Festival, and White Fox Festival, each with their requirements for attendance. Tickets were made available for pre-sale to \\"The One\\" members on April 1, 2017 and to Japanese audiences April 12, 2017. For international audiences, they were given out in a lottery from April 29 to May 9, 2017. On May 29, 2017, in response to tickets for the tour selling out, the band confirmed another leg, titled Big Fox Festival in Japan (stylized as BIG FOX FESTIVAL in JAPAN), adding four more shows. Tickets were made available to international audiences for presale on July 20, 2017, and via lottery on July 28, 2017 (with winners announced the following day). The first performances of the tour running from July 18 to July 20, 2017 were located at Akasaka Blitz, the same venue where Legend \\"D\\" was held over four years ago. During the tour, the band also took part in Summer Sonic Festival in Osaka and Tokyo on August 19 and 20, respectively. When asked for the reason for starting the tour, Su-metal explained that they set those events in music clubs to be able to see their fans up close, and Moametal said that she had wanted to perform in front of different audiences. == Controversy == According to the band, anyone who was unable to meet the requirements for attendance would be refused admittance to the show. The restrictions received a mixed response, with some considering it a potential innovation for concert tours in the future, or fascinating due to a potential culture gap. Others, particularly international audiences who won tickets via lottery, complained that it was unfair to be barred from shows due to not being in the correct age range. Fans have also found the age range set for the Silver Fox Festival, specifically for elementary school students and adults above the age of sixty, unusual. == Broadcast and recording == The shows on October 14 and October 15, 2017 were recorded and set to stream via Wowow on April 14, 2018. Five shows from The Five Fox Festival in Japan and one from Big Fox Festival in Japan have been recorded and released as \\"The One\\" fanclub-exclusive box sets in early 2018. == Set list == This setlist is representative of the show on August 30, 2017 in Osaka, Japan at Zepp Osaka Bayside.

It stars newcomers Shravan Mukesh and Varsha Bollamma. The film was released on 23 February 2018. ==Plot== Sarath (Sravan Mukesh), the only son of Prabhakaran (Sreenivasan) is madly in love with his childhood friend Shari (Varsha), the only daughter of their neighbor Sahadevan Nair (Mukesh). As they grow up it becomes difficult for Sarath to somehow convey his feelings to her, despite both of them meeting frequently. Moreover Shari's dad wants to marry her off to a \\"Nair\\" boy according to their tradition. Sarath is always accompanied by his friend Saiju (Gregory) and his too young uncle Avesh (Hareesh Kanaran). They spend most of the day at a garage owned by Sundaran (Dharmajan). Sarath observes that Varkey (Indrans), an aged worker in the garage is often visited by a drunkard man (Anil Nedumangad) who keeps coming to the garage for the sake of scolding Varkey, who always gives a deaf ear to it. No one knows the reason or relation between them. Later, Shari's parents arrange a bridegroom for her which saddens Sarath which leads to comical situations. It ends up with the three of them being caught by the police, though released later. Varkey is again scolded by the drunken man, and Sarath asks him why he is scolded. Varkey reveals that the drunken man was the one who liked Varkey's daughter a lot, and wanted to marry her. But Varkey objected, due to the guy being from a different religion. He also marries the girl off to a suitable family. But the girl got killed few days later, thus saddening both Varkey and the man. Hearing the story and also witnessing Shari accompanying her would-be home, Sarath is disheartened and attempts suicide by standing on a railway track. But he is stopped by his parents, and he discloses about his love to them for the first time. Prabhakaran says that they would have arranged for it had he told about it earlier. Now that it is too late, Sarath is advised by his father to forget everything. While at Shari's home on the day before the marriage, he unintentionally goes to Shari's room, where he sees objects from their childhood which she preserved. Upon meeting her, she confesses to him that she liked him a lot since childhood, but didn't talk about it as he apparently showed no interest. Now that both of them had confessed their liking for each other, Shari says its too late for both of them. She says it was Sarath's father who disapproved their marriage. Sarath meets Sahadevan, who makes it clear that he wasn't interested in their relationship right from their childhood, so he was the one who lied to her. Knowing all these, Prabhakaran decides to confront Sahadevan who brutally rejected his son. After Prabhakaran enters Sahadevan's room, Sarath's friends eagerly wait outside and see Prabhakaran coming out after sometime. He asks Sarath to be ready for his marriage the next day. The next day, to everyone's surprise, Sarath marries Shari in the same planned time. Sarath and his friends are eager to know how Prabhakaran made things possible. He reveals that it was Shari's master plan, by faking a suicide attempt if Sahadevan doesn't allow her marriage with Sarath. Thus Sarath realises how much Shari loves him, and confesses that his feelings were nothing before that of her. ==Cast== * Mukesh as K.P.

It was the 143rd running of the New Zealand Derby, and it was won by Vin De Dance. Vin De Dance was offered at the New Zealand Bloodstock Ready to Run Sale as a two-year-old, but was passed in. A sale was later negotiated for $70,000, with breeder Luigi Muollo retaining a share alongside new owners OTI Racing and the Kilted Taniwha Syndicate. The son of Roc de Cambes was sent to the Cambridge stable of Hall of Famer Murray Baker and his training partner Andrew Forsman. The team has won multiple New Zealand training premierships, and guided Mongolian Khan to victory in the 2015 New Zealand Derby. Vin De Dance made a winning debut at Pukekohe in early September, then was placed in two subsequent appearances at Te Rapa. He was sent to Melbourne, where he finished third at Flemington and fifth in the Moonee Valley Vase. Withdrawn from the Victoria Derby and given several months off to strengthen and develop, Vin De Dance returned with fourth and sixth placings over 1400 and 1600 metres in late January and early February. He moved into Derby contention with a fighting third in the Avondale Guineas. The fifth favourite for the Derby at $9.90, Vin De Dance was handy throughout the 2400-metre race and loomed as a major threat around the home turn.

The village Dihur Phonglo, which existed on the bank of the river of Mahur (Dihur) was named after Sambhudhan Phonglo. A tank known as Sambhudhan-ni-dikhor, meaning Sambhudhan's tank, also existed on the river. == Early life == Phonglo was born in Longkhor near Maibang in the North Cachar Hills of what is today the Dima Hasao District. He was born reportedly on the Falgoon Purnima of Indian almanac. His father was Deprondao Phonglo and mother Khasaidi. Phonglo had four younger brothers: Umakant, Ramakant, Ramcharan (alias Ramren) and Haisholong. Phonglo spent his childhood at Longkhor, later moving over to Gonjung. Afterwards, he moved to Saupra, a small village near Nanadisa. As a young man, he moved to Semdikhor, near Mahur, where he married to Nasadi. Phoglo was reportedly tall, of fair complextion, with black eyes and large ears. == Opposition to British == In 1832, the British took control of Southern Cachar, and in 1854 Northern Cachar. Instead of combining the two territories, they annexed them to the district of Nagaon. The territory was then placed under the charge of a Junior Political Officer with headquarters at Asalu. In 1866, the territory was distributed between the districts of Nagaon and Naga Hills. Thus, while parts of the Diyung Valley and the Kopili Valley had been given to the district of Nowgong, a large portion was joined with the newly created district of Naga Hills. The rest formed the territory of the North Cachar Hills comprising exclusively the hilly region. Phonglo opposed these moved. He felt that the British had no right to rule the people of Assam and that the territorial moves were intended to weaken them. Phonglo took the view that if the native people were going to lose freedom, then shouldn't they help the foreign power in consolidating its position. To lose freedom was to embrace slavery. It would not be worthwhile for them to live under the aliens as slaves, as hardships could be endured, but not slavery. == Insurrection == Phonglo decided to foment a rebellion against the British. He toured extensively in the North Cachar Hills, encouraging mass resistance, making contacts, and organizing followers. He was able to recruit a large number of youths to form a revolutionary force. Phonglo appointed Man Singh as his Principal Adviser and Molongthong a Subordinate Commander . Phonglo started training his insurgents in Maibang. Villagers voluntarily rendered their services to the training center. Recruits were brough to Maibang in batches of thirty to forty.

Officially called the Castel San Angelo, it was built on the site of older fortifications dating to Greek occupation in the third and fourth centuries BC. In 1481 the low ground in front of the fortification site was excavated to allow the passage of boats, and to create a moated defensive position. The present fortress was built for the then-king of Naples, Ferdinand II of Aragon in 1496 to reinforce the naturally low-lying link between the old town of Taranto on a peninsula, and the mainland. The seven- towered design is attributed to Francesco di Giorgio Martini of Siena. The fortress repelled an Ottoman attack in 1594, but it quickly lost its military significance with the advent of artillery. It was converted to an artillery platform and many interior spaces were filled in to provide a stable base for the guns. In 1707 under the Habsburgs it was converted to a prison however during the Napoleonic period it reverted to its original function as a military fortress. French generals Thomas-Alexandre Dumas and Jean-Baptiste Felix de Manscourt du Rozoy were the most illustrious prisoners of the castle having been taken prisoner in 1799 by the pro-Bourbon Sanfedismi when their damaged ship sought refuge at Taranto Harbour. At the time, Taranto was part of the Kingdom of Naples. In 1883 the San Angelo tower was demolished to allow construction of the Ponte Girevole, and two others were removed to allow the widening of the canal. Since 1883 the fort has been occupied by the Italian Navy. Beginning in 2003 the Navy began restoration and archeological work on the site, removing plasterwork and investigating fortification work dating back to the Byzantine era. The fort is open for tours. ==References * Castello Aragonese website in Italian * Archeological investigation of the Castello Aragonese Category:Taranto Category:Castles in Apulia ","title":"Castello Aragonese (Taranto)"},{"id":"56752108","text":"A trifecta is a type of horse racing bet.

Described in the press as a \\"genuine old-fashioned lynching\\", it is the only known lynching in Wake County, North Carolina. The lynching was commemorated on its anniversary, 2018. ==Events== The assault took place on October 30, 1918 while Ruby's husband, Leonidus \\"Lee\\" Rogers, a prominent farmer in the community, was 2 miles away in Rolesville for business. Ruby Rogers was home with her infant son. She later said that an African-American man entered her home, threatened her with a knife, and assaulted (raped) her before leaving the home. Mrs. Rogers was examined by a physician who confirmed the assault. Over the next few days, police brought at least three African- American men to Mrs. Rogers to review as suspects, but she did not identify any as her assailant. The three men were each released. Tensions in Rolesville continued to grow among the whites, and law enforcement had to avert a mob who tried to take one of the suspects. On November 5, local law enforcement received a tip that George Taylor, an African-American man, had visited a friend in the Rolesville area on the day of the assault. He was arrested in nearby Wilson, North Carolina and brought to the Rogers' farm. Initially, Mrs. Rogers denied that he was the assailant, but after asking him to repeat phrases she said were used in the attack, she confirmed that he was her attacker. Police placed Taylor in a motor vehicle and started to the county seat of Raleigh to begin processing the arrest. But before they left the Rogers property, they encountered four masked men carrying firearms. These men stopped the vehicle and dragged Taylor into nearby woods. Police found Taylor's body the next morning near the woods. He had been \\"badly gashed and tortured before death\\", shot more than 100 times, and hanged upside down by his feet from a tree. \\"His back and sides were sliced by knife after his death.” An inquiry followed to identify those involved in the lynching. More than 30 people were interviewed, both black and white. As was typical in lynching cases, no suspects were ever named and no one was ever charged. According to the Durham Herald, \\"the witnesses...are displaying either unparalleled ignorance of the doings in their community, or are champion forgetters.\\" == References == Category:Lynching deaths in North Carolina Category:1918 murders in the United States Category:1918 in North Carolina Category:November 1918 events Category:History of Wake County, North Carolina Category:People from Wake County, North Carolina ","title":"Lynching of George Taylor"},{"id":"56752123","text":"The Pat Lyddan House, located south of Mooresville, Kentucky on Kentucky Route 55, was built in 1853.

The conference was addressed by President Jorge Rafael Videla. == Common problems in water scarce countries == The amount of water available to an area is dependent on its climate and position in the global water cycle. Dominance of water-rich temperate countries has overlooked the fact that water is a finite resource. High water stress is a serious problem growing season is short and recurrent droughts make irrigation necessary for food supply to be attained. The increasing threat of famine and drought in Africa is cause for global concern. Major water problems occur in temperate zones due to ignorance or neglect. For example, water pollution has surpassed itself as a regional issue to a global issue. In tropical and sub-tropical climates, they face different problems. The tropical climate makes countries more vulnerable to floods, droughts, and land degradation (desertification). In other climates, such as humid, wet climates in Southeast Asia, supply large amounts of water into the ground. Human practices like irrigation have taken important nutrients from the soil and deplete the nature around it. Climate issues in different climates are much more far reaching to be more of a global concern.. == United Nations Water Conference == The United Nations Water Conference was the first intergovernmental meeting on problems ensuring adequate water supply for the future. Delegates from 105 countries, as well as intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, were also present. Its purpose was to avoid a water crisis at the end of the century. There was need for extensive improvements in food and crop yields. A set of ten resolutions were made directed at United Nations agencies, governments, and the international community overall. These ten resolutions including: assessment of water resources, community water supply, agricultural water use, research and development of industrial technologies, the role of water in combating desertification, technical co-operation among developing countries, river commissions in international river basins, institutional arrangements for international co-operation in the water sector, financing arrangements for international co-operation in the water sector, and water policies in the occupied territories. === Action Plan === At the United Nations Water Conference in 1977, the first Action Plan was created recognizing that, “all peoples, whatever their stage of development and social and economic conditions, have the right to have access to drinking water in quantities and of a quality equal to their basic needs.”  January 1992: International Conference on Water and Sustainable Development - Dublin.  Principal 4 of the Dublin Conference stated that, “it is vital to recognize the basic right of all human beings to have access to clean water and sanitation at an affordable price.”  June 1992: United Nations Conference on Environment and Development - Rio  Chapter 18 or Agenda 21 endorsed the resolution from the Mar del Plata Water Conference of 1977 saying that it was “the commonly agreed premise.”  September 1994: United Nations International Conference on Population and Development  The Programme of Action from the UN International Conference on Population and Development confirms that all individuals, “have the right to an adequate standard of living for themselves and their families, including adequate food, clothing, housing, water, and sanitation.”  November 2002: General Comment No. 15. The Right to Water  General Comment 15 of the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural rights (ICESCR) confirmed the right to water in international law. Within that the is, Article 11 allows for the right to an adequate standard of living, and Article 12 the right to the highest attainable standard of health. Article I.1 states that “the human right to water is indispensable for leading a life of human dignity. It is a prerequisite for the realization of other human rights.”  July 2005: Draft Guidelines for the Realization of the Right to Drinking Water and Sanitation.  These draft guidelines were intended to assist government policymakers, international agencies and members of civil society working in the water and sanitation sector to implement the right to drinking water and sanitation. These guidelines do not legally define the right to water and sanitation, but provide a guide for its implementation.  July 2010: UN General Assembly Resolution  UN Resolution formally recognizes the right to water and sanitation and acknowledges they are essential for human rights. The Resolution calls upon States and international organizations to provide financial resources and technology, especially to developing countries, to provide safe, clean, accessible, and affordable drinking water and sanitation for all Water is a human right for everyone to have.  Effectiveness of the Action Plan  For most UN conferences, there is a follow-up conference ten years later. While there was the Water Conference which main focus was the “Improved Efficiency in the Management of Water Resources” in 1987. They spoke on improving the use of financial, technological, and human resources. This small, inter-regional was not done on a bigger scale due to the lack of single UN-body in charge of implementing the Action Plan made at Mar del Plata. Many groups have complained that “many problems are still in need of suitable action.” Finally, thirteen years later the UN began implementing the Mar del Plata Action Plan in the 1990s. An assessment was done for the different economic regions in need of water where programs were required. Many programs they created were ignored until the 2000s, like serving every man, woman, and child with acceptable drinking water. There were many reasons the Action Plan was not successful. One such reason was the broadness with which it was written. For example, rather than referring to different countries who have different climates, they just referred to them as “countries.” On the country level, governments had to make tough economic decisions, prioritizing the most urgent problems. When the UN body allowed steering councils to make decisions on where to fix issues, they based their decisions on their budget plans. Finally, there was no timeline created on when these issues were going to be solved and the drought and famine problems have only gotten worse since 1977. the people are in the land of canaan. == Today == The Zaragoza Conference was held in 2012 in Rio de Janeiro was focused on “The Future We Want.” They talked about sustainability of natural resources, and the development of business, civil society, and governments\\". === Water Quality === WASH has widened the ambition of the water agenda to include water waste management and protecting ecosystem. Use of water is growing at twice the rate of population growth and ways to manage wastewater, treatment, and reuse. Wastewater can be collected, treated, and recycled to some extent. === Water Challenges === Today has expanded beyond water and sanitation to include hygiene, household, and beyond the household: Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH). It also addresses concern with safety, equality, and sustainability. Advances made have unequally distributed in many countries, especially Sub-Saharan Africa. WASH created the new 2015 objectives: # No open defecation # Basic access to drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene for households, schools and health facilities. # Increase the population without home access to safely drinking water and sanitation services. # Elimination of inequalities by population groups as to allow more access to services. === Implementation Challenges === Forty-six countries still have more than 50% of their population without improved sanitation and there are at least 800 million people still drinking water contaminated with feces. Disparities of water are at the base of all inequalities in poor countries. The Sustainable Development Goal for Water is in the range of the resources, the human and social capacities and the technologies available. These challenges can be combatted by increasing finance to allow benefits to come up in front while also improving the use of financial resources already available. The use of low-cost science and technology that will increase efficiency in water provision and use in industry, agriculture, and energy production. These technologies must be adaptable to the scale and capacity of local conditions. == References == Category:Water scarcity Category:United Nations conferences Category:1977 in Argentina Category:Diplomatic conferences in Argentina Category:Argentina and the United Nations ","title":"United Nations Water Conference"},{"id":"56752436","text":"Ricardo Adolfo (1917 – 25 May 2005) was a Filipino boxer.

Khải Định became King of Annam in 1916 the funding for the production of new cash coins was reduced by the Hanoi Mint which lead to the demand of the Vietnamese market for low value denominations to not be met, furthermore, after Hanoi reduced funding for the Thanh Hóa Mint, which until that time was producing enough low denomination cast cash coins to meet the market's demands, which caused most, but not all, of the production of cash coins at the mint to cease in 1920. In response a new committee was formed in Hanoi which ordered the creation of machine-struck Khải Định Thông Bảo cash coins, these are the first machine-struck four character Thông Bảo (通寶) coins in Vietnam with the reigning emperor's name as the French government had prior tried to introduce a Cochinchinese 2 sapèque coin that continued under French Indochina that weighed 2.05 grams and had a nominal value of piastre, later the colonial government of the French Protectorate of Tonkin had unsuccessfully tried to introduce a zinc milled sapèque produced by the Paris Mint with a nominal value of piastre from 1905 until 1906. Unlike the earlier attempts at producing machine-struck cash coins by the colonial French authorities the Khải Định Thông Bảo proved to be much more successful as the first series had a production of 27,629,000 coins while the second series greatly exceeded this with around 200,000,000 coins produced in Huế, Haiphong, and Hanoi.Đỗ Văn Ninh (1992), Tiền cổ Việt Nam, Nhà xuất bản Khoa học xã hội (in Vietnamese)Lục Đức Thuận, Võ Quốc Ky (2009), Tiền cổ Việt Nam, Nhà xuất bản Giáo dục (in Vietnamese) The Khải Định Thông Bảo continued to be produced long after the death of Emperor Khải Định under his successor Bảo Đại until it was phased out by the Bảo Đại Thông Bảo (保大通寶) in 1933.Dr. R. Allan Barker. (2004) The historical Cash Coins of Viet Nam. Because the machine-struck Khải Định Thông Bảo cash coins were heavier than the earlier milled 2 sapèques produced by the Paris Mint, they were likely valued at piastre. A number of the machine-struck cash coins were produced by Poinsard & Veyret Comptoirs D’Extrême-Orient in Hải Phòng, French Tonkin. The inscription \\"Khải Định Thông Bảo\\" was also used for non-cash coins produced under the reign of Emperor Khải Định for tiền (錢) and lạng (兩) coins made from silver and gold, respectively.Linh, Vietnamese in Vancouver Khải Định Thông Bảo .

Reproductive Health Services Supreme Court decision. They continued their work through 1998. == Mission and manifesto == Their goal as a collective was to empower women and to increase awareness of women’s issues through radical art. Sister Serpents' public manifesto stated: > “SisterSerpents proclaims an end to women’s acceptance of their own > oppression. SisterSerpents is fierce and uncompromising, refusing to plead > or gently persuade. We recognize and confront the misogyny that exists deep > within society…Our struggle hopes to bring the demise of the system that > allows for our brutalization… We involve ourselves with idea warfare, > instead of the physical and emotional violence which has so long been used > upon us… We bare our ideological fangs for the purpose of shocking… Our work > is done anonymously… SisterSerpents has no modesty.\\" Founding member Jeramy Turner stated, “The purpose of SisterSerpents is to use art as a weapon to battle against misogyny.” Members of the group were adamant that they were not a political organization; they sought to use art as a weapon for social change, but not in the context of being hired to make posters for political organizations. The work of Sister Serpents was described by some as \\"militant\\"; members of this group unabashedly sought to make men feel oppressed by encountering their art. == Members == The group worked anonymously, with loose membership and no affiliation with any formal institutions. In order to become involved, women had to agree that art was the main focus of the group's work, and that all artistic work created by the collective should aim to attack misogyny. Two of the only members who were publicly named were founding members Jeramy Turner and Mary Ellen Croteau. Their Chicago-based group expanded and by 1991 included chapters in San Francisco, Atlanta, Cleveland, Seattle, New York, and Hamburg, Germany. == Artwork == Sister Serpents used posters, art, and stickers to convey their feminist protest message. Many of their posters were created to be produced in multiples and wheat pasted in public spaces, out of a desire to make their message seen in the streets, and included messages such as \\"Rapists are the Boys Next Door.\\" One feminist pro-choice poster by the group was printed in Industrial Worker. Bright stickers included the \\"Tips for men\\" series, with messages such as “tips for men: don’t rape”. Stickers were created to be put over advertisements, with slogans such as “This sells rape. Don’t buy it.” and “Misogyny. Look it up. Stamp it out.” Sister Serpents also created a zine, MadWOMAN Magazine, that was distributed nationally. The group became immediately infamous for their first poster, which depicted a fetus (in the style of right-wing pro-choice posters) along with text including the phrases: “For all you folks who consider a fetus more valuable than a woman: Have a fetus cook for you; Have a fetus affair; Have a fetus clean your house.” Members explained this artwork directly: “Our poster points to the current fanaticism we call ‘fetus worship’, which preposterously elevates a fertilized egg to the status of ‘unborn child’ and relegates women to the role of parasitical host.” Their artistic influences included the Berlin-based Dada artists, whose photomontage style and ironic slogans are imitated in the work of Sister Serpents, and the style of the Surrealists. Many of their artworks provided commentary on Western art traditions, such as their re-creation of classical paintings of naked women which replaced the subjects with naked men, or a re-creation of Rodin's The Thinker which elongated the subject's head into a long penis. Several of artworks created by the collective are in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian’s Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum. The group created a logo of a winged snake, which was turned into a rubber stamp to be stamped in red ink on their posters. This logo was designed to be both a strong and humorous image; the group took their name and this logo from the primordial snake that did not die but that shed its skin to emerge into another life, and that has the ability to open peoples’ eyes to the knowledge of good and evil. == Exhibitions  Rattle Your Rage: Women's Views of Their Oppressors === March/April 1990, Chicago; June/July 1990, ABC No Rio, New York City. This exhibition included art by 32 artists from around the country. Some of the show’s artworks commented less on society and more directly on the art world and its underlying patriarchal assumptions. The opening in Chicago on March 16, 1990 included a screening of R.W. Fassbinder’s film “Bremer Freiheit”, followed by a panel discussion on the refusal of law enforcement to help women who are being assaulted by their partners. Panelists at this event included Lesley Brown, a woman who served time for the contract killing of her abusive husband; film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum; and curator Lynne Warren. The exhibition was described by reviewers as \\"unabashedly agitational\\", and criticism of the show from feminists targeted the fact that it focused heavily on issues of abortion and male oppression of women. === First Anniversary Show === July 1990, The Guild Complex/At the Edge of the Lookingglass, 62 East 13th Street, Chicago To celebrate their first birthday, members created a collaborative mixed-media installation which featured a huge man-eating snake hanging from the ceiling, a series of banners, and a dartboard encouraging visitors to “take aim at misogyny” while throwing darts at sexist advertisements. === Snakefest '91: Art Against Dickheads === February 1991, Artemisia Gallery, Chicago This exhibition at the women-owned Artemisia Gallery was a juried show featuring posters, performance, video, ceramics, sculpture, and painting. The call for art requested submissions by \\"angry women\\" that were humorous while also taking a strong political stance against the victimization of women. Works on display included “Sports Nuts (Koons Meets Oldenburg for the Playoffs) by Mary Ellen Croteau, “What Men Fear Most” by Jeramy Turner, “Pennaddition” and “No. 1705366: This man yelled sexual comments to a women” by Margeaux Klein, as well as “Get it Straight: Violence Hurts” by Carol de Press. Another poster in the exhibition read, “Men: stop raping us, stop beating us, stop killing us.” The exhibition also included a series of \\"Snake-outs\\", which were public events including film screenings, talks, and dramatic performances. === Art Against Dickheads: excerpts from Snakefest ’91 === March 1991, Midway Studio, Chicago Including work from the original Snakefest '91 exhibition, this selection of material showed a strong reaction to the fact that many art galleries and museums show naked women but not naked men; in response, this exhibition from Sister Serpents displayed a lot of penises. === Piss on Patriarchy, Piss on Passivity === Chicago, 1992. == Public response == Sister Serpents was accused of \\"reverse pornography\\" and came under fire from the American Family Association and the Heritage Foundation. These negative responses were viewed by collective members as proof that their art was necessary. ==Further reading== * \\"The Forgotten History of the Controversial Sister Serpents,\\" by Sarah Laskow, March 14, 2018.

He currently releases music under the moniker Current Joys. He also is the drummer and lead singer of the indie surf rock band Surf Curse. As an artist, Rattigan began releasing music as The Nicholas Project from 2011 to 2012, thereafter releasing music as TELE/VISIONS, releasing his debut album, Wild Heart, on January 2, 2013, as well as all of his music on Bandcamp. After 2015, Rattigan began performing as Current Joys, with his second studio album Me Oh My Mirror, released on February 16, 2015, reflecting the significant change in his style of music. He released his third album, A Different Age, on March 2, 2018. == Personal life == Rattigan was born in Henderson, Nevada but moved to Reno for education. Early in his career, he moved to Brooklyn, New York. He now currently resides in Los Angeles, California and Dallas, Texas. According to Rattigan, he taught himself guitar mostly through online guitar tabs for artists such as System of a Down and Flogging Molly. He also took drum lessons when he was eight years old. Rattigan has revealed that he suffers from a form of generalized anxiety disorder. == Career  2011 – 2015: The Nicholas Project, TELE/VISIONS, Franco Years, Devil Worship, and Surf Curse === Rattigan started individually writing and releasing music as The Nicholas Project, after an anonymous Myspace message inspired him to compose music. He self-released a slew of independently-produced recordings on Bandcamp from November 2011 to October 2012 under the moniker. As TELE/VISIONS, Rattigan self-released his debut album, Wild Heart, on January 2, 2013. Citing the name change as being influenced by Videodrome, Rattigan said to FORGE Magazine that \\"I was writing this song and my roommate had given me a drum machine, so I was like \\"This is perfect! I can start playing live shows!\\" and they were like \\"yeah but no one is going to book you with your name as the Nicholas Project\\" and they were right. In 2013, he and classmate Jacob Rubeck, who self-releases music under the moniker Gap Girls (Previously Casino Hearts), formed the band Surf Curse. This Surf punk (music genre) band would be their second major project after a small project named Buffalo 66. Through Big Joy Records, an independent label in Los Angeles, California, they released their debut album, Buds, in June 2013 and the extended play (EP) Sad Boys EP in October. Three EPs were released in 2013: Young Luv in January, No One Will Dance in February and Neon Gold in June. Also, from May to July 2013, Rattigan wrote for Noisey, a brand under Vice. An extended play, 2013, was released in January 2014. 2008–2010, a compilation album, was released as the final work under The Nicholas Project in May. A compilation of b-sides and unreleased tracks, B-Sides, Rarities and Demos, was released a month later. Rattigan wrote for Impose as an intern from September to October 2014. Found on his YouTube channel, Rattigan has performed under additional names, Franco Years and Devil Worship. Both of these projects can be found on Bandcamp. === 2015 – present: Current Joys and Danger Collective === In February 2015, Rattigan announced that the follow-up to Wild Heart was almost complete. The album, Me Oh My Mirror, was then self- released on February 16. In January 2016, the limited-edition zine Alabama (2000 Light Years) was announced for release in February. On March 6, 2016, the song \\"New Flesh\\" from Wild Heart was used in a short video titled \\"Flesh\\" on Vine by Internet celebrity Emma Greer, under her online alias GIBBERTON. The video was her last before her death from cancer twenty-one days later and caused a rise in interest towards the song. Two days later, Rattigan released a song, \\"Kids\\", and announced the name change to Current Joys instead of TELE/VISIONS, stating that \\"I no longer feel like it represents the music I want to make and there are too many conflicts with the band Television which present problems for future prospects.\\" To fit with the change, Rattigan re- released all of his music under the moniker on October. Rattigan, debuting as a music video director, produced and directed the music video for \\"123\\" by the folk punk band Girlpool in March 2017. In July, Rattigan released a second limited-edition zine entitled Days, which came with an unreleased five-song EP. He also collaborated with labelmate BOYO for a 4-track EP, Split, released by Danger Collective and Terrible Records on September 6. On January 8, \\"Become The Warm Jets\\" and \\"Fear\\" were released as the lead singles for A Different Age, his debut album on Danger Collective. The music video for \\"In a Year of 13 Moons\\" was released on January 30 as the third single. In February, the fourth single from the album, \\"My Nights Are More Beautiful Than Your Days\\", titled after the film of the same name, premiered on L.A. Record. The album was released on March 2. Within the same month, NPR included \\"Fear\\" in \\"The Austin 100\\", a playlist of songs from artists performing at SXSW.

It was published in 2010 by Bloomsbury Publishing, with 240 pages. Magic Under Glass and its 2012 sequel Magic Under Stone were adapted as a fantasy rock musical in 2017 by the Columbia Center for Theatrical Arts. == Plot summary == The story takes place in the kingdom of Lorinar that is in an ongoing war with a neighboring fairy kingdom. Nimira, the heroine, is a woman of aristocratic roots who works as a dancer in a foreign land after her mother's death and the disappearance of her father. She does not think twice when a handsome and mysterious magician, Hollin Parry invites her to live in his palace on the condition that she performs with a robot that can only be turned on with a silver key. She soon finds out that there is some evil magic in the mist and that the automation is Erris, a cursed fairy prince who is trapped in a robot body. Hollin's wife Annalie is trapped in an attic under the control of a sorcerer. Nimira and Erris fall in love and help to free Annalie from her curse. It is unknown what fate awaits them as they seek to free Erris from his automaton body. The sequel, Magic Under Stone, continues the tale of this duo in this magical land of twists and turns. == Background == Dolamore's inspiration for Magic Under Glass came from her interest in the Victorian era and automaton. Due, in part, to the influence of her favorite author Charlotte Brontë, Dolamore wanted to write a story that incorporated gothic and romance themes. It took her two months to write the first draft of the novel, which she then rewrote twice over the next two years. == Reception == Magic Under Glass, was met by generally positive reviews. Its publisher, Bloomsbury Publishing faced criticism due to perceived whitewashing by using a white woman on the cover to depict the heroine, Nimira who is described in the book as \\"black-haired and brown-skinned.\\" The author, Dolamore wrote that, although the plot is set in an imaginary kingdom, Nimira's character draws from Eastern European, Asian and Roma cultures. == Adaptations == Columbia Center for Theatrical Arts announced its intention to stage a musical adaptation of Magic Under Glass and Magic Under Stone, engaging author Dolamore as playwright, Michael Kline as composer and lyricist, Toby Orenstein as artistic director, and Ross Scott Rawlings as orchestrator and music director. Dolamore began writing the script in the Summer of 2015 and concluded it, with the assistance of Kline and Orenstein that December. The musical opened at Howard County Community College Smith Theater in Columbia, Maryland in July 2017. The costume designer, Kristen Clark exhibited the musical at the 2017 World Stage Design in Taipei, Taiwan. In November 2017, American Latino TV featured the musical in an episode, interviewing cast members and hosting a live performance of selections from the original score. == References  External links == * Category:2010 American novels Category:2010 fantasy novels Category:American gothic novels Category:American romance novels Category:American young adult novels Category:Romantic fantasy novels Category:Bloomsbury Publishing books ","title":"Magic Under Glass"},{"id":"56752834","text":"Cai Haojian (; born 24 October 1995) is a Chinese footballer who currently plays for Hubei Chufeng Heli in the China League Two. ==Club career== Cai Haojian entered South China University of Technology in 2013 after declining an invitation from Chinese Super League side Guangzhou Evergrande.

She won the 2016 Rencontres d'Arles Discovery Award for a series that explored albino persecution in sub-Saharan Africa. She was also recognized by the 2015 Uganda Press Photo Awards. == Early life and career == Sarah Waiswa was born in Uganda and is based in Nairobi, Kenya. She studied sociology and psychology, and is a self-taught photographer. Her portraiture project, \\"Stranger in a Familiar Land\\", explores the persecution of albinos in sub-Saharan Africa, in which they are hunted for the perceived magical powers of their body parts. The series sets an albino woman against a background of the Nairobian slums of Kibera, which represent the stormy outside world. The model's dreamlike pose in societal isolation reflects both the model's alienation and the photographer's hesitance towards her society. Waiswa developed the project to raise awareness after reading a newspaper article about treatment of albinos in Tanzania. Part of their shoot consisted of responding to the jeering throng. Aida Muluneh, the photographer who presented the award, described Waiswa's photography as reflecting her surroundings' complexities. While Sarah Moroz of i-D praised the clarity with which Waiswa presented the isolation of albino identity, as the model's lighthearted accessories defied an insurmountable air of rejection, Sean O'Hagan of The Guardian considered the otherwise \\"brave\\" effort \\"oddly overstaged\\". Waiswa's work explores what she calls a \\"New African Identity\\": how younger generations of Africans feel more expressive and less restrained by tradition than their predecessors. She also sought to counteract stereotypical depictions of Africa, often the result of foreign rather than native photographers. Additionally, many of her subjects are women. In 2016, Waiswa was working with photographer Joel Lukhovi on \\"African Cityzens\\", which records daily life in multiple African cities. They participated in a 2017 book that shows the Maasai people in truthful, quotidian context, rather than as stereotypical warriors. For Waiswa, the project consummated a search for information on a poorly documented ancient female deity. ==Awards== *2015: Uganda Press Photo Award's top creative prize and was a runner-up in its portrait and daily life categories *2016: Rencontres d'Arles Discovery Award *2017: OkayAfrica named her among Uganda's best emerging artists == References  Further reading == * == External links == * Category:Living people Category:1980s births Category:Ugandan photographers Category:Women photographers Category:21st-century photographers Category:Ugandan women artists Category:21st-century women photographers ","title":"Sarah Waiswa"},{"id":"56752878","text":"Restless Youth is a 1928 silent American melodrama film, directed by Christy Cabanne.

In her youth Matryona was a prostitute. Matryona Ivanovna Kiseleva was the spiritual daughter of John of Kronstadt. Kiseleva moved from Kronstadt to Oranienbaum in 1895, where the center of the sect's functioning moved after it, and she formed a community of women who lived under monastic discipline and worshiped at St. Andrew's Cathedral. She also attracted male followers from Saint Andrew's Cathedral of the sect consider Kiseleva a prophetess and called her «Theotokos» (bogoroditsa), «Porfiriia», «the porfiriia of the Tsar of Tsars», «Oranienbaum Mother of God». John's sectarians called «Jesus Christ — Tsar of Tsars». Other sectarians had names: Mikhail Petrov (; the «Archangel Michael») is a Yaroslavl peasant, Elizaveta Korchacheva (; «Solomoniia the Myrrh- bearer») is a former prostitute, Nazarii Dmitriev (; «John the Theologian») is a Novgorod peasant, Basilii Pustoshkin (; «Elijah») is landlord Kronstadt Hospice House, Nicholai Bolshakov (; «Enoch») is a bath attendant. Porfiriia Kiseleva is glorified by sectarians in special hymns in honor of her, for example: «Virgo is wise Porfira, You suffered for Christ, You had in oneself A high-valued Christ's stone» Ioannites depicted Matryona on icons, and the icons are rendered equal with the sacred images of worship. Porfiriia confessed to John of Kronstadt. She died of syphilis November 25, 1905. John of Kronstadt performed the funeral of Kiseleva. During the funeral service, instead of the prayers prescribed by the charter, they sang a prayer: «The Most Holy Theotokos, Save us!» The very place of Kisseleva's burial (in Oranienbaum) is the subject of special veneration of the sectarians, the things left after it and sand from the grave are of religious significance for them. After the death of John of Kronstadt, in 1912 the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church condemned the Ioannites and declared them a sect; Kiseleva was declared a main sectarian. The sect in official documents was named «Khlysts–Kiselevists» from the name of Porfiriia Kiseleva. The image of Kiseleva found reflection in art. Victor Protopopov wrote the play «Black Crows» in 1905. The play was a huge success on the stages of theaters and in theaters it was always a full house. In this play, John of Kronstadt was portrayed as a pseudo-healer, and his supporters - «Ioannites», led by Kiseleva, as fanatics-sectarians. The «Ioannites» rise in arms against the play that had exposed them. People's Artist of the USSR Ekaterina Korchagina- Alexandrovskaya, who played in those years in one of the Petersburg troupes, says: \\"In the «Black Crows», I played the role of a sectarian \\"Theotokos\\". Religious fanatics were furious, and often to me, \\"in order to avoid excesses\\", I had to return home after the performance, accompanied by guards, who protected me from sectarian attempts to crack down on me when leaving theater\\".Myron Chudnovtsev.

The kidnapping incident led to the withdrawal of the Philippines from the coalition and a deployment ban for Filipino workers seeking to work in Iraq. ==BackgroundSituation=== The Philippines was part of the Multi-National Force – Iraq, a United States-led multinational coalition participating in the Iraq War. At that time, there were 51 Filipino soldiers stationed in Iraq while about 4,000 civilians are working in the country, primarily under contract with military bases of the United States. The Philippine government has planned to withdraw its contingent from the coalition by August 2004. ===Abductee=== Angelo dela Cruz was an Overseas Filipino Worker or a migrant worker who served as a driver Saudi Arabian company before his kidnapping. He was working with the United States Army as part of his job. A native of Pampanga, dela Cruz at the time of his abduction was 46 years old and is a father of three children. Prior to working in Iraq, he worked in Saudi Arabia for 15 years. ==Kidnapping== Dela Cruz was kidnapped in Fallujah Angelo dela Cruz was kidnapped near Fallujah while transporting fuel from Saudi Arabia on July 7, 2004 and later appeared in a broadcast by Al Jazeera pleading for his life. The kidnappers of dela Cruz, identified themselves as members of the Khaled Bin Al-Walid Squadrons which is part of the militant group, Islamic Army of Iraq and demanded the Philippine government to withdraw its 50-person contingent from the United States-led multinational coalition in Iraq \\"as soon as possible\\". They demand that the Philippine contingent to be withdrawn from Iraq and that the Philippine government come up with a decision by July 10. The Philippines then confirmed that they will withdraw its contingent on August 20 and claimed that dela Cruz has been released and will be dropped off in a hotel in Baghdad. Al Jazeera reports that the militants have denied such claims. They set July 13, 2004 as the new deadline for an agreement with the Philippine government. They demand that the Philippine contingent to be withdrawn from Iraq by July 20. Following a five-hour cabinet meeting on July 12, then-Secretary Delia Albert of the Department of Foreign Affairs said that the Philippine government will not comply with the militants demands. At the day of the deadline, Al Jazeera reported that the militants has taken dela Cruz to a location where his \\"punishment\\" will be meted out. Dela Cruz reportedly requested the kidnappers a one-day extension so he could extend a message to the President of the Philippines and that his corpse be delivered to his country's government. The kidnappers later extended the deadline by 24 hours The Philippine government then agreed to comply with the militants demands. They announced that dela Cruz was released on July 17 though it was only in July 20 that dela Cruz was released by his captors. ==AftermathPhilippine withdrawal from the coalition=== The Philippine government publicly announced on July 16, 2004 that Philippine contingent will be withdrawn from Iraq \\"shortly\\". At the time of the announcement, the Filipino soldiers were already in Kuwait and were scheduled to be flown to Metro Manila by July 19. The government has withdrew its contingent a month earlier than planned. The move was criticized by the Philippines' allies. Then-Australian Prime Minister John Howard, while remarking that he does not want to be \\"harsh on a friend\\", describe the Philippines' move to withdraw its contingent earlier than planned as a \\"mistake\\" that would not \\"buy\\" the Southeast Asian country \\"immunity\\". He acknowledge the crisis resulting from the kidnapping incident as a \\"wretched state of affairs\\" and said that giving in to the militant's demands won't stop similar occurrence from happening again. Iraq and the United States also criticized the move. Then-White House spokesman Scott McClellan also expressed disappointment of the move which he says \\"sends the wrong signal to terrorists\\". Gen. John Abizaid of United States Central Command in reaction to the move said that if one \\"appease terrorism\\", one \\"will sooner or later fall victim to it or be taken over by it\\". The militant group then issued a web message to the Japanese government to withdraw its 500-person contingent from Iraq as well threatening them with \\"lines of cars laden with explosives\\" and urged Japan to \\"Do what the Philippines has done\\". ===Release of dela Cruz=== After Philippine compliance to the militant groups demands, dela Cruz was released. He was dropped off at the United Arab Emirates embassy in the Mansour district of Baghdad. Then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo hailed the releasing and dubbed dela Cruz as the \\"Filipino everyman, a symbol of the hardworking Filipino seeking hope and opportunity\\" and remarked that she will not regret her government's decision in handling the incident. The United States embassy in Manila congratulated the Philippines for the release without referencing the compliance of the Philippine government to the terms laid by militants. Pacific Strategies and Assessments, a firm based in the United States, said that the move of Arroyo's administration is to preempt possible backlash from the Overseas Filipino Workers community that identifies themselves with dela Cruz. The firm also said the move was to boost domestic public opinion for Arroyo who just won re-election in the 2004 presidential elections which was marred by controversy. ===Iraq worker deployment ban by the Philippines=== Shortly after the return of dela Cruz to the Philippines, the Philippine government issued a deployment ban of Filipino migrant workers to Iraq. The Department of Foreign Affairs then issued passports that explicitly mentions the ban. Iraq has urged the Philippines to lift its ban so that Filipino workers can be involved in the rehabilitation of the country. The ban was partially lifted in July 2013, allowing Filipinos except domestic workers to work in Iraq though Filipinos were still barred in working in the Anbar, Nineveh, Kirkuk, and Salahuddin Governorates. ===Post-kidnapping life of dela Cruz=== Then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo provided a new house for Angelo dela Cruz and his family at the Benjamin subdivision in Mexico, Pampanga and his eight children were provided with scholarship by Arroyo. He briefly worked in California, after he was brought in to the United States by his uncle. He returned to the Philippines after he was left bored due to being confined in an office workplace most of the time and found it unsustainable to remain unemployed in the United States. He also received a P200 thousand aid from the OWWA Regional Welfare Administration which he used to buy a jeepney. Dela Cruz, as of 2011, worked as a passenger van driver plying the Mexico- Angeles route. As of 2014, he remains as a van driver.

During his fifty-year writing career, Carter produced hundreds of magazine and newspaper articles, dozens of short stories, and 17 books including five novels. Many of his non-fiction books and articles popularized scientific ideas and discoveries or reported on medical advances. In the 1930s and 1940s, many of his articles appeared in popular magazines in Canada and the United States and three of his books were published by large commercial publishers in the United States and widely reviewed. He occasionally used the pseudonym Warren Desmond for popular fiction that he would otherwise would not have been able to sell in the United States due to McCarthyism. ==Early life== Carter was born in Saint John, New Brunswick to Gertrude and William R. Carter, members of the Salvation Army who had been sent from Britain first to Bermuda and then to Canada to work for the church. In 1912, the Carters became matron and superintendent, respectively, of the Provincial Detention Home for Juveniles in Winnipeg, where Dyson Carter would grow up and go to school. Carter suffered from osteogenesis imperfecta, which made his bones brittle throughout his life and often required him to be bedridden or walk with crutches, or later use a wheelchair.https://lh.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/lh/article/viewFile/5335/4530 ==Education== Carter received his Bachelor of Science in 1931 and his Master of Science degree in Chemistry from the University of Manitoba in 1933 and subsequently worked as a university lecturer, a researcher and an engineering consultant in addition to his writing career. ==Literary career== Carter wrote in a number of genres including popular science, health, socialist realist fiction, romance, and biography. His works included Sea of Destiny: the Story of Hudson Bay, Our Undefended Back Door (1940), a book that argued the Canadian north was susceptible to Nazi invasion and should be developed and militarized along the lines of the Soviet north in order to prevent such an eventuality, Night of Flame (1942), a novel set in a hospital that explored themes of class conflict, and Stalin's Life (1943), a hagiographical biography of Stalin. In the 1930s and 1940s, Carter's articles were published in popular magazines such as Saturday Night, Star Weekly, and Maclean's and in various American publications such as the pulp magazine Argosy. He was made a member of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society in 1941, but was essentially blacklisted by the popular media after 1945 when he made public his membership in the Labor-Progressive Party (as the Communist Party of Canada was known at the time). He had joined the Communist Party in 1931 but had kept his membership secret for over a decade. Many of his books were translated into Russian and other languages and distributed throughout the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries, and many of his articles were translated and carried in Soviet publications.https://reader.paperc.com/books/propaganda-and- persuasion/939419/ch01/__root__ ==Canadian-Soviet Friendship Society and Northern Neighbors== As well as being president of the CSFSS from 1949 to 1960, with Dorise Nielsen as executive secretary, and engaging in national lecture tours to promote friendship with the Soviet Union, Carter was editor and publisher of the Canadian-Soviet Friendship Society's newsletter, News- Facts About the USSR from 1950 to 1956 and of the glossy pro-Soviet magazine Northern Neighbours from 1956 to 1989. Carter's pro-Soviet writings never deviated from the party line, following its twists and turns. The invasion of Hungary in 1956 and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 were presented from the Soviet point of view. According to historian Jennifer Anderson, who researched Carter's life and work: \\"Dyson Carter eventually recognized the message did not correspond with reality, but not until Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of glasnost had made speaking openly about Soviet 'falsifications' possible. In 1990, Carter wrote that he had spent 40 years producing 'bullshit.'\\"https://curve.carleton.ca/system/files/etd/636d773d-b182-4454-9338-c07adffbfd23/etd_pdf/0fb7e7f30e99c6ea1040100565f4a6f1/anderson- propagandaandpersuasioninthecoldwarthecanadian.pdf Carter added: \\"I publicized so many Soviet 'achievements' that were total falsifications, that I consider my 'work' an exercise in political pathology.\\" He was awarded several honours by the Soviet Union including the Centenary Medal (1970), the Order of Friendship of the Peoples (1980) and the Order of the Union of Friendship Societies (1985). ==References== Category:Canadian communists Category:Canadian chemists Category:Canadian engineers Category:1910 births Category:1996 deaths Category:20th-century Canadian non-fiction writers Category:Canadian science writers Category:Canadian medical writers Category:Writers from Saint John, New Brunswick Category:20th-century Canadian journalists Category:Socialist realism writers Category:Canadian magazine journalists Category:Canadian male novelists Category:Soviet propagandists Category:People with osteogenesis imperfecta Category:20th-century Canadian novelists Category:20th-century engineers ","title":"Dyson Carter"},{"id":"56753100","text":"Papuacola lignicolor is a moth of the family Noctuidae first described by George Hampson in 1926.

It has a single thin, hollow, onion-like leaf and up to ten small green flowers. It differs from the other two onion orchids in New Zealand, (M. unifolia and M. parviflora) in being a much smaller plant with a more pointed dorsal sepal. == Description == Microtis oligantha is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, tubular leaf up to long. Between one and ten green or yellowish-green flowers up to are arranged along a flowering stem up to long. The dorsal sepal is broadly egg-shaped, long and hood-like. The lateral sepals are much shorter and narrower than the dorsal sepal and curve downwards. The petals are shorter than the lateral sepals and are mostly enclosed by the dorsal sepal. The labellum is oblong, up to long and curves downwards to be more or less parallel to the ovary. Flowering occurs from December to March. ==Taxonomy and naming== Microtis oligantha was first formally described in 1968 by Lucy Moore from a specimen collected on the edge of Lake Roundabout east of Ashburton and the description was published in the New Zealand Journal of Botany. The specific epithet (oligantha) is derived from the Ancient Greek words oligos meaning \\"few\\", \\"little\\" or \\"scanty\\" and anthos meaning \\"flower\\". ==Distribution and habitat== The small onion orchid grows in damp grassland and meadows in montane and subalpine parts of both the North, South and Chatham Islands. ==Conservation== Microtis eremaea is classified as \\"not threatened\\" in New Zealand. == References  External links == * Category:Prasophyllinae oligantha Category:Endemic orchids of New Zealand Category:Plants described in 1968 ","title":"Microtis oligantha"},{"id":"56753217","text":"APLL may refer to: * The Academy of Persian Language and Literature * An analog phase-locked loop * APL Logistics - a Japan-based freight and forwarding company ","title":"APLL"},{"id":"56753280","text":"Club Deportivo Cabecense is a Spanish football team based in Las Cabezas de San Juan, in the autonomous community of Andalusia.

The band was originally formed by friends from multiple bands that had dissolved in 2007 from the outer west Sydney suburb of Campbelltown, NSW. The current line up is composed of Mark Owen, Matt Harvey, Nathaniel D'Ugo, Mathew Kelly and Kieran Elliott. Their third album Departure Songs gained them widespread acclaim within the post-rock and metal scenes around the world. The band have reached notable success internationally for their emotional and energetic live performances and modern and thematic approach to the post-rock genre. They are currently released through Australian independent record label Bird's Robe Records, which is distributed through MGM in Australia and independently worldwide. Dunk!Records in Europe and Translation Loss in North America. == History  Early years, Crimea === The band was formed when Mark Owen approached Nathaniel D’Ugo to start a band with him after Nathaniel's former band Omeratá had broken up. From here they called upon friends Chris Torpy on vocals and the twin brothers Grant and Brendon Warner on guitar from another local band Sound The Mute to join. The idea was to create a huge and heavy sounding project that would act like a collaborative of musicians. The band's member line up has changed many times, at one point consisting of nine members. The band's name doesn't have a specific meaning. The early members wanted a name that creates an enigmatic feeling, evokes emotion and leaves interpretation up to the listener. The group often incorporates themes into their albums such as loss, grief and hope, space exploration, war and stories from history. They released their first record entitled Crimea - engineered and mixed by Magnus Lindberg of Cult of Luna in February 2009 at Sing Sing studios in Melbourne, Australia. This was released only on CD and independently by the band the following year. This record was inspired by poems written about the Crimean war and heroic infamous figures such as Florence Nightingale. === The Quietest Place on Earth === In 2010 the band went into the studio to record their second album The Quietest Place on Earth. Complications and member changes delayed the release of this record until 2012 when Grant Warner and Brad Garnam left the band and Matt Harvey (ex Omeratá) joined on guitars after receiving a last minute call from vocalist Chris Torpy, who asked him to come to a rehearsal. A short time after the band joined with Bird's Robe Records. The record was received well and was followed up with a handful of highly successful local shows including their sold out album launch and supporting American post-metal band Rosetta where the band debuted the new line up and songs. Lochlan Watt from Triple J and Dave Drayton from FBi Radio both mentioned the band in the best of 2012 in Drum Media's writers poll. In March 2013, their vocalist, Chris Torpy died by suicide, leaving the band to take a short break. Their first show without Chris took place on March 21, 2013 at the Annandale Hotel, opening for This Will Destroy You. On April 26, 2014 We Lost The Sea held a tribute and benefit show to raise awareness and money for suicide prevention and education surrounding depression and anxiety in association with beyondblue Australia. === Departure Songs === In 2015 the band recorded and released their third LP Departure Songs initially through Bird's Robe Records and Art As Catharsis Records in Australia. It was later released in Europe through Dunk!Records and in North America through Translation Loss Records. This record is their first all- instrumental album and was a slight shift away from their old dynamic. Heavily affected by the loss of Chris, Departure Songs is a concept album inspired by failed, yet epic and honourable individual journeys or events throughout history where people have done extraordinary things for the greater good of those around them, and the progress of the human race itself. Each song has its own story and is a soundtrack to that story with its own piece of art to illustrate the journeys within the songs. The artwork, made by guitarist Matt Harvey, helped wrap the theme of this record together with the music and found acclaim on its own merit with an article in Digital Arts Magazine (UK) and reaching over 42,000 views on Behance. Departure Songs was widely received and reached critical acclaim all over the world in the highly regarded post-rock scene and even breaking out of the boundaries to reach different audiences everywhere. Their song \\"A Gallant Gentleman\\", the main single from the album and featuring a Sydney girls school choir, has been featured on video projects, student films, and promotion for media brands and football clubs and most recently featured on the soundtrack for Ricky Gervais' show After Life released on Netflix in 2019. The final song on the album, Challenger - Part 1: Flight has been used for interpretative dance routines and over documentaries. One album stream on YouTube had more than 4.6 million views in June 2020. === Triumph And Disaster === In October 2019 the band released their fourth album Triumph And Disaster. ==Tours== The album Departure Songs generated enough buzz for the band to pursue extensive national tours of Australia. They were also invited to support post-rock and post-metal bands Baroness, Maybeshewill, This Will Destroy You, Caspian, Pelican, Earth, Jakob (NZ) and Japan's Mono and Boris on their Australian visits. Even being offered the support for Finnish cello-metal band Apocalyptica on their Australian tour. ===First Australian headline tour=== The band embarked on a nine date tour of Australia over the course of June and July 2016. The tour finished at a sold-out show at the Oxford Art Factory in Sydney where they played with the VOX youth choir from Sydney Philharmonia Choir. ===The Last Dive Tour=== In January 2017 the band did a 3 date east coast headline run to celebrate the end of the Departure Songs album cycle in Australia before heading to Europe. It also signified the last shows guitarist Brendon Warner would play with the band after deciding to leave to focus on studies. The Sydney Morning Herald listed the Sydney show at the Newtown Social Club as top 5 gig of the week next to artists like Nick Cave, PJ Harvey and Refused. Both the Sydney and Melbourne shows sold out. ===European Tour 2017=== In May 2017 the band embarked on their first ever overseas tour to Europe with their debut show at the Belgian post-rock festival Dunk! This was followed by 16 shows around the continent playing some shows to sold-out crowds such as A38 in Budapest and WERK-2 in Leipzig and ending with a huge sold-out show in Paris. Carl Whitbread (Lo!, Omeratá) came on board as their touring guitarist for this tour. The tour also included Sydney post-rock/prog bands Meniscus and Dumbsaint. ===TQPOE 5 year anniversary tour=== In December 2017 the group decided to tour in celebration of their second album The Quietest Place on Earth’s fifth anniversary. They felt that it was underrepresented when it was released and Chris had passed away so soon after its official release that there was only a handful of shows played during that time. Joining them to fill in on vocals for this tour was Jarrod Krafczyk (The Amenta, Omeratá) and former guitarist Brendon Warner filled in on third guitar. This tour also included a last minute support addition from Rosetta who were in Australia touring with sleepmakeswaves at the time. This tour is also when the band started working with Australian music booking agents Select Touring. ===China tour 2018=== On 22 March 2018 the band embarked on a 10 show tour of China managed by the touring company New Noise. This was their first tour to Asia and they played in front of their biggest headline crowd to date at Shenzhen B10 Live, concluding with a show at This Town Needs (formerly Hidden Agenda) in Hong Kong. One of the first shows after it re-opened after UK band This Town Needs Guns had issues with immigration the previous year. ==Record releases== The band have had multiple pressings done of their records. They are known for high quality artwork and multiple colour variations. Most notably is Departure Songs which has been pressed 3 times with a total of 9 colour variations. All current pressings have sold out. == Musical style and influences == The band's sound has changed over the years while the basis and heart of the music has stayed relatively the same. The loss of their vocalist made the band choose to release instrumental music whereas previously the band had been associated with post-metal, doom and sludge metal genres. They have always leaned towards thematic, long, atmospheric and heavy styles of writing and even with vocals there are many instrumental parts throughout their albums. The band has been referred to sounding like and being influenced by Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Mogwai, Cult of Luna, Explosions In The Sky and The Cinematic Orchestra. == Members  Current === * Mark Owen – guitar (2007–present) * Nathaniel D'Ugo – drums (2007–present) * Kieran Elliott – bass (2009–present) * Mathew Kelly – piano, keyboards (2009–present) * Matt Harvey – guitar (2012–present) * Carl Whitbread – guitar (2017–present) === Front of house === * Michael Taverner (2009–present) === Former === * Chris Torpy – vocals, samples (2007 – died March 2013) * Brendon Warner – guitar (2008–2016) * Grant Warner – guitar (2008–2012) * Bradley Garnam – guitar (2007–2012) * Jared Ryan – bass (2007–2009) == Discography  Studio albums === * Crimea (2010) * The Quietest Place on Earth (2012) * Departure Songs (2015) * Triumph & Disaster (2019) No. 41 Australia === Live albums === * Live at Dunk!Fest 2017 (2019) == References  External links == * Official website Category:Australian musical groups ","title":"We Lost the Sea"},{"id":"56753350","text":"Let's Get Physical is an American television sitcom created by Ben Newmark, Dan Newmark and Connor Pritchard.

Parallel to wenren are two terms, \\"shi\\"(Chinese:士), scholar, and \\"shen\\"(Chinese:绅), often defined as gentry or official. Candidates who achieved the lower degree were called shengyuan (Chinese:生员). Those who pass the second test could take the third test - known as the highest test, held in Beijing every three years. The people who pass this final test were jinshi () which is the highest level a literati may reach. == Qing educational system == The Qing education system is mostly derived from Confucianist. It includes \\"Four Books and Five Classics\\"(Chinese: 四書五經; pinyin: Sìshū wǔjīng). Generally, people begin their studies when they are very young and attempt to pass three tests throughout their lives. Scholars who pass the Imperial examination obtain the \\"Jinshi\\" degree and have a chance to make it into the central Government. == Literati life == Horizontal inscribed boards with the titles of the imperial exam winners: zhuangyuan 状元 (1st place)，bangyan 榜眼 (2nd)，tanhua 探花 (3rd). Qing Dynasty. Civil examinations mediated the classical discourse of \\"way learning\\" and literati into everyday lives. Tensions, which brought a few fame and fortune, left most dealing with disappointment. Literati often turned to religion and the manic arts to channel their responses to the competitive examination. Those who failed the civil examinations often mocked the selection process in popular novels, such as Wu Jingzi's (1701-1754) The Scholars, and vernacular stories by Pu Songling (1640-1715). Such narratives framed the examination process from the angle of the failures. Such works appealed to both elites and non-elites. Recorded dreams and auspicious events were manifested in nonofficial accounts of the examination candidates, which the public used for explaining their individual success or failure. Examination success usually meant career success, but what success meant in terms of careers changed dramatically from Ming to Qing. All but palace degree-holders were down-classed by the late Ming, while in the Qing even palace degree-holders frequently had to wait years to gain an appointment as a magistrate or prefect once they passed in the bottom tier. Social prestige, legal privileges and corvée labor exemptions kept most commoner families from competing in the examination market. The diminishing opportunities for examination success by the nineteenth century exacerbated human frailties. No earlier dynasty ever faced a demographic expansion commensurate with the Qing, from 250 million in 1650 to 350 million by 1800. ==See also== *Literary inquisition ==References== Category: Education systems Category:Qing dynasty ","title":"Qing literati"},{"id":"56753447","text":"Operation Pocahontas Forest was a security operation conducted during the Vietnam War by the U.S. Americal Division and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 2nd Division in the Quế Sơn Valley, South Vietnam from 6 to 31 July 1968. ==Background== At the beginning of July, Allied intelligence indicated that the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 1st Regiment, 2nd Division was operating near Hiệp Đức at the western end of the Quế Sơn Valley. General William B. Rosson ordered Major General Charles M. Gettys, commander of the Americal Division to secure the area. ==Operation== Operation Pocahontas Forest was launched on 6 July to search for the 1st Regiment and preempt a possible attack on Hiệp Đức. MG Gettys formed a brigade-size task force under the command of his deputy Division commander BG Howard H. Cooksey. Task Force Cooksey comprised the 4th Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment, the 4th Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, the 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, a mechanized platoon from Troop F, 17th Cavalry Regiment, a company from the 26th Engineer Battalion and four MIKE Force companies. The ARVN 2nd Division contributed a separate combat group comprising the 2nd and 4th Battalions, 5th Infantry Regiment, supported by an artillery battery. During the initial phase of the operation the Allied force located some supply caches around Hiệp Đức, but did not make contact with the 1st Regiment. On 11 July MG Gettys added the 5th Battalion, 46th Infantry Regiment, to Task Force Cooksey and on 21 July he added the 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment, but even this expanded force made little contact with the PAVN. ==Aftermath== The operation ended on 31 July, with PAVN losses of 127 killed while U.S. losses were 18 killed. While the Allied forces had not engaged the 1st Regiment directly, it had succeeded in keeping them away from Hiệp Đức and improved security in the Quế Sơn Valley to allow for pacification. ==References== Category:1968 in Vietnam Pocahontas Forest Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War in 1968 Category:History of Quảng Nam Province ","title":"Operation Pocahontas Forest"},{"id":"56753508","text":"\\"The Lost and the Plunderers\\" is the tenth episode of the eighth season of the post-apocalyptic horror television series The Walking Dead, which aired on AMC on March 4, 2018. It was written by Angela Kang, Channing Powell and Corey Reed, and directed by David Boyd. ==Plot== After burying Carl, Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and Michonne (Danai Gurira) gather their remaining supplies from Alexandria and abandon the community as walkers overrun it; Michonne tries to stop a fire from overtaking a gazebo Carl enjoyed, but Rick convinces her to let it go. On the road, Rick considers what Carl told him, and from his advice, heads to see Jadis (Pollyanna McIntosh) and the Scavengers, who had witnessed what happened at the Saviors' Sanctuary. Elsewhere, Enid (Katelyn Nacon) and Aaron (Ross Marquand) are taken to the Oceanside community as prisoners for killing their leader, Natania. Natania's granddaughter Cyndie (Sydney Park), after hearing Enid's pleas, decides to let the two live, but orders them to never return. Once escorted outside Oceanside, Aaron insists Enid get back to the Hilltop to let them know what happened while he will try to go back to Oceanside and convince them to help. Meanwhile, at the Sanctuary, Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) orders his men to seek out the Alexandria residents and instructs Simon (Steven Ogg) to go to the Scavengers with his \\"standard offer,\\" to kill one of them to bring the rest in line, reminding him that he values the people as resources to be saved otherwise. Just then, they receive a box sent by the Hilltop community with the message to \\"stand down\\", containing the reanimated body of Dean (Adam Fristoe), one of Simon's men. Simon, not pleased with Negan's approach and knowing the Hilltop has the rest of his 38 men in captivity, goes to the Scavengers' junkyard and accuses Jadis of going back on their deal with the Saviors, but gives her Negan's offer of returning to the original terms of their deal and giving over all their guns. Jadis agrees, but Simon does not believe Jadis is showing enough remorse and kills her two lieutenants, Tamiel (Sabrina Gennarino) and Brion (Thomas Francis Murphy), in cold blood. She punches him, causing Simon to then order his men to kill the rest of the Scavengers. After, Simon reports back to Negan that all went well, though he spots paint on his shoe from the scuffle with Jadis. By the time Rick and Michonne arrive at the junkyard, all of the Scavengers but Jadis have reanimated. They find Jadis alone, having dropped her aloof nature. She explains that she had been an artist before the outbreak, having used the junkyard for materials, but afterwards, she and the Scavengers saw the junkyard as a way to keep themselves isolated from the rest of the world while using the entire yard as their canvas. Rick, tired of Jadis' double-crosses, decides to abandon her as he and Michonne escape. Jadis lures the remaining walkers into an industrial shredder to protect herself, crying to herself as she watches her former friends be destroyed. As they drive away, Rick takes a moment to stop and read Carl's letters, including one he wrote to Negan. Inclined to contact Negan over walkie-talkie, Rick decides to inform him that Carl is dead and that his son wrote a letter to Negan, asking him to stop fighting. Negan receives the news, but Rick vows to keep fighting and kill Negan. Deeply saddened by Carl's death, Negan retorts that it was Rick's intense focus on his war with Negan that led to it and that Rick failed as both a leader and father. ==ReceptionCritical reception=== The episode received generally positive reviews from critics.

It was in the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Jessie on land with an estimated area of . Upon the proclamation of the District Councils Act 1887 on 9 December 1887, it was located within the jurisdiction of the District Council of Narracoorte. The source of the town’s name is not reported in official sources. An article in The Narracoorte Herald of 22 February 1929 does offer two possible opinions to the sources of the town’s name. The first was that \\"many South-Eastern people thought it was named after a sister of the late Mr. J. P. D. Laurie\\" who may have had \\"some influence with the Crown Lands Department\\" in respect to its name. The second was that it was named after \\"some other lady\\" on the basis of the views of \\"some other historians of nomenclature.\\" This lady could be Lady Jessie Blyth for whom the Hundred of Jessie was named. Lady Blyth was the wife of Sir Arthur Blyth, Commissioner of Crown Land and a former Premier of South Australia when the Hundred was proclaimed on 24 October 1867. Jessie is reported as being proclaimed on 28 April 1876 by one source while official sources such as the South Australian Government Gazette contain no mention of any proclamation. However, the government gazette does show that land within the town was available for purchase by November 1870 at the latest. A drawing of the Hundred of Jessie prepared in November 1872 by the surveyor-general’s office shows that the town had been located and that a layout of its allotments and streets had been prepared. The town is reported as being surveyed during May 1890. In September 1891, during the second reading of The Park Lands Resumption Bill in the South Australian House of Assembly, it was stated that the town allotments in the Town of Jessie all remained unsold and that there were \\"no occupants on town lots\\" while the \\"suburban lands\\" had been \\"nearly all sold.\\" On 24 January 1929, the town was declared by a proclamation under the Crown Lands Act 1915 to \\"ceased to exist\\" along with the closure of all roads within its boundaries. On 12 April 2001, the site of the ceased town was divided along the alignment of the Wimmera Highway with its north and south sides being allocated respectively to the newly created localities of Hynam and Laurie Park. ==References== Category:Ghost towns in South Australia Category:1929 disestablishments in Australia Category:Limestone Coast ","title":"Jessie, South Australia"},{"id":"56753681","text":"Nagadeba indecoralis is a moth of the family Noctuidae first described by Francis Walker in 1865.

His father was a butcher, and his mother started a horse-drawn garbage-trucking business. The business won the garbage removal contract for the city of Hoboken, and the lucrative contract remained with the family when McFeely served as mayor. ==Political career== In 1915, when Hoboken adopted a commission form of government under the Walsh Act, McFeely was elected to the original commission, serving as Commissioner of Public Safety. He succeeded Mayor Patrick R. Griffin as the Democratic leader of the city in 1926, allying himself with the powerful mayor of Jersey City and Hudson County political boss, Frank Hague. In 1930, he was named mayor by his fellow commissioners, filling the vacancy left by Gustav Bach, who had been appointed Hudson County clerk. McFeely's tenure as mayor was noted for rampant nepotism. He appointed his brother, Edward J. McFeely, to be chief of police. His nephew, Thomas F. McFeely, served as superintendent of the Hoboken school system. By the end of his time in office, dozens of other relatives were said to be on the city payroll, appointed to various positions. The family trash business maintained the city's garbage removal contract, continuing to use horse-drawn carts into the 1940s. In 1946, McFeely was indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiring with ten other city and police officials to oppress a group of Hoboken police officers who had sued for overtime pay due to them for working seven days a week during World War II. The defendants included his brother Edward, the chief of police, as well as two nephews, who served as deputy police chief and a police captain. McFeeley's attacks on the \\"rebel\\" police officers led to the formation of a Fusion ticket to oppose the mayor's Democratic organization in the 1947 election for city commission. McFeely and his Democratic machine were defeated by the Fusion ticket in May 1947, and Fred M. De Sapio succeeded him as mayor. McFeely's unexpected defeat contributed to Frank Hague's decision to announce his retirement from politics shortly thereafter. McFeely was scheduled to go on trial in the police case shortly after the 1947 election. However, trial was postponed several times due to illness. He was still under indictment when he died on August 8, 1949 at the age of 67. He never married. ==References * Bernard N.

It is of uncertain taxonomic status, the presence of remnant tentacles on spent females indicate that this species does not belong in the genus Gonatopsis and the differences between this species and Gonatus makodai have led to some authorities stating that G. okutanii is a junior synonym of Eogonatus tinro. However the World Register of Marine Species still recognises Gonatopsis okutanii as the valid name for this taxon. ==Description== Gonatopsis okutanii is a medium-sized species of squid with a gelatinous body, 5 teeth on the radula and long, thin arms. Arms II & III are very long and slender; and their length is at least equal to the mantle length. The arms have thick bases but become weak and narrow towards their tips. Arms I-III have 2 rows of hooks in the middle and 2 rows of small suckers while arm IV only has suckers. All the arms have 5-10 pairs of medial hooks or suckers which are spaced wide apart, the arm suckers have 7-9 teeth placed on the distal edge of their ring. All known specimens are spent females which have short, remnants of tentacles situated between the proximal ends of arms III and IV. They have very large eyes, a buccal membrane which has 7 lappets and there is in nuchal crest which has three or four indistinct nuchal folds on either side along its length. The radula has teeth in five transverse rows. The mantle is thick, soft, gelatinous and conical in shape with a mantle length which varies between 18 cm and 25 cm. The skin is dark purple in colour marked with \\"eye patches\\". It has short rhomboid shaped, narrow fins and a short tail. Tentacles are present on the subadult specimens described as Eogonatus tinro and these have a tentacular club lacking any hooks and with equal sized suckers arranged in numerous irregular rows. ==Distribution== Gonatopsis okutanii occurs in the North Pacific Ocean from Japan in the east to Alaska and Canada in the west. ==Habitat and biology== Gonatopsis okutanii is reported to have relatively large eggs up to 2.3 mm in length, compared to female body size. The male and female appear to copulate \\"head to head\\", and the adult females do not appear to die after their first breeding. They are caught at intermediate depths and spent females have been collected at depths of between 525m and 550 m and have been found in the stomachs of sperm whales. ==Naming== Some authorities treat Gonatopsis okutanii as a junior synonym of Eogonatus tinro and the two taxa were described in the same paper by Kir Nesis, G. okutanii was based on spent females, while E. tinro was based on young squid, however E. tinro has priority. ==References== Category:Squid Category:Molluscs described in 1972 ","title":"Gonatopsis okutanii"},{"id":"56753870","text":"The 12th Filmfare Awards South Ceremony honoring the winners of the best of South Indian cinema in 1964 is an event held on 1965.

CBS Sports HQ is co- headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut and Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Like its sister station CBSN, it is designed primarily as a digital-oriented service and is available for free on a multitude of platforms, including smartphones, tablets, computers, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, and Roku. It can also be accessed through the CBS Sports app for iOS and Android, Pluto TV and CBS All Access rather than traditional platforms such as television, broadcast or otherwise. The service is designed with younger audience in mind, allowing a viewer to get continuously updated information from the world of sports in a fast-paced format at any time of the day. It can be watched as a linear channel or as on-demand segments. The network carries eight minutes of advertising per hour and operates live, on average, 10 hours daily. ==History== CBS Sports HQ at the Georgia World Congress Center, 2019 Planning for the service began in early 2017. It was described early on as being the \\"CBSN for sports\\". CBS Sports HQ was launched on February 26, 2018, after success with CBSN and CBS All Access. Nick Kostos previewed the launch at 5pm and then Chris Hassel and Dalen Cuff kicked the broadcast off at 7pm that night. Speaking to investors after reporting fourth-quarter earnings in 2018, CBS Corp. CEO Leslie Moonves stated the company had garnered a combined five million subscribers to its “CBS All Access” streaming service and an over-the- top version of Showtime and expected to surpass its goal of 8 million subscribers by 2020. Meanwhile, CBSN saw streams rise by 17% in 2017 compared to the year-earlier period. In late 2018, headquarters operations and a studio dedicated fully to Sports HQ were established in Stamford, Connecticut, with \\"split daily operations of Sports HQ between Stamford and Fort Lauderdale\\". == Programming == CBS Sports HQ draws content from CBS Sports along with its various digital properties, such as 247Sports, SportsLine, CBS Sports Fantasy and MaxPreps to deliver live news reports, game previews, post-game analysis, highlights and in-depth statistical breakdowns to connected devices, without focusing on \\"loud arguments or bloated diatribes\\". CBS Sports HQ displays continuous information on a \\"R\\"-shaped ticker placed at the lower and right- sides of the TV screen, which isn't visible during commercial breaks. The lower third ticker contains scores, brief news alerts, the day's sports headlines and fixtures in an ESPN BottomLine-styled format. The right-side ticker predominantly features statistics, tables, and fixtures. CBS Sports HQ covers an extremely wide range of sports leagues, including those that CBS doesn't have rights to broadcast. Its programming includes recurring segments such as Morning Trends (the hottest sports stories in social media), At This Hour (five biggest stories of the hour), News in 90 (four or five biggest stories of the day) and HQ Refresh (the biggest stories and scores of the day). In contrast to CBSN, which carries some over-the-air CBS News programming on a time delay, CBS Sports HQ does not carry any longform content from CBS television or CBS Sports Network. Live sporting events are also absent from the network's programming. On March 11–13, 2020, some of CBS Sports HQ's programming was simulcast on CBS Sports Network due to the CBS Broadcast Center being closed for disinfection as a result of two employees testing positive for the COVID-19 virus. CBS Sports HQ was unaffected as it was not based from that location. == Anchors == * Tommy Tran - Anchor * Hakem Dermish - Anchor * Jenny Dell - Anchor * Jamie Erdahl - Anchor * Chris Hassel - Anchor * Casey Kiernan - Anchor * Julie Stewart-Binks - Anchor * Bill Reiter - Host of “Reiter’s Block” Many of CBS Sports Digital's writers and analysts will also contribute, including national college football writer Dennis Dodd; senior NFL columnist Pete Prisco; and college basketball columnist Gary Parrish. ==References * Category:CBS Sports Category:Internet properties established in 2018 Category:Internet television channels Category:2018 establishments in Florida Category:24-hour television news channels in the United States Category:Sports television networks in the United States Category:Companies based in Stamford, Connecticut ","title":"CBS Sports HQ"},{"id":"56753951","text":"Hasan Ferda Güley (1916 – 17 November 2008) was a Turkish military officer, politician, and former government minister.

He became a regular feature in the Guoan lineup in the 2019 season, featuring a total of 25 times and scoring 7 goals. He was favored by Roger Schmidt and was caped consistently from matchday 12 to matchday 19 in Guoan's Chinese Super League campaign. His performance earned him a spot in the Chinese national team. However, he briefly fell out of favor under Bruno Génésio, who replaced Schmidt toward the later half of the season. Wang eventually earned his way back to the match squad and scored twice as substitute in the last four games of the season. Wang was considered a lucky charm for the team by the Chinese media as four of his seven goals were scored after the 88th minute. ==International career== He made his debut for China national football team on 7 June 2019 in an friendly against Philippines, as an 80th-minute substitute for Yang Xu. ==Career statistics Club === . {   + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=2Club !rowspan=2Season !colspan=3League !colspan=2Cup !colspan=2Continental !colspan=2Other !colspan=2Total - !DivisionAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoals - rowspan=5Qingdao Jonoon 2014 China League One 1000colspan=2—colspan=2—10 - 2015 China League One 5020colspan=2—colspan=2—70 - 2016 China League One 12100colspan=2—colspan=2—121 - 2017 China League Two 20211colspan=2—colspan=2—213 - !colspan=2Total !38!!3!!3!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!41!!4 - rowspan=4Beijing Guoan 2018 Chinese Super League 16050colspan=2—colspan=2—210 - 2019 Chinese Super League 257203010317 - 2020 Chinese Super League 0000110011 - !colspan=2Total !41!!7!!7!!0!!4!!1!!1!!0!!53!!8 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !79!!10!!10!!1!!4!!1!!1!!0!!94!!12 } ===International statistics=== . {   - ! colspan=3  National team - !Year!!Apps!!Goals - 201910 - !Total10 } ==ReferencesCategory:1996 births Category:Living people Category:Chinese footballers Category:China international footballers Category:Footballers from Qingdao Category:Qingdao Jonoon F.C. players Category:Beijing Sinobo Guoan F.C. players Category:Chinese Super League players Category:China League One players Category:China League Two players Category:Association football forwards ","title":"Wang Ziming (footballer)"},{"id":"56754106","text":"The list of shipwrecks in November 1837 includes ships sunk, foundered, wrecked, grounded, or otherwise lost during November 1837. ==1 November2 November3 November4 November5 November6 November7 November8 November9 November10 November11 November12 November13 November14 November15 November16 November17 November18 November19 November20 November21 November22 November23 November24 November25 November26 November27 November28 November29 November30 NovemberUnknown dateReferences== 1837-11 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in November 1837"},{"id":"56754113","text":"Rema tetraspila is a moth of the family Erebidae.

Blind children received education in specialised schools, but initiatives for adults were few. The Maatschappij tot Onderstand der Blinden (K.M.B.S.) was the first Belgian organisation to offer financial support and vocational training to this group. It was located in Antwerp.Blindencultuur: de beleving van personen met een visuele beperking, by Jannes Vanmelle. University of Ghent. 2015. (Dutch) After the First World War, four different care associations for the blind were founded in Belgium within a timespan of five years. This was in part because of the large amount of war veterans that were blinded during World War I. In 1919, La Lumière was established. 1922 saw the foundation of Ligue Braille and Oeuvre Nationale des Aveugles. Their Flemish counterpart, Blindenzorg Licht en Liefde, was created in 1923. The initiative was established by two priests who taught at a school for the blind in Spermalie, a small hamlet in Bruges. They were led by seminary president Kamiel Callewaert.Licht en liefde voor onze blinden, vereeniging tot bescherming van de belangen der blinden (Kamiel Callewaert & Maurice Duyvewaardt), Bruges, 1925. (Dutch) == Development (1923-1933) == The main goal of Licht en Liefde was to offer support and braille literature to alumni of the Spermalie school for the blind. Volunteers transcribed pre- existing books into braille. This initiative later became the first Flemish braille library. A secondary goal was to establish a federation for individuals with a visual impairment in Flanders and Brussels, named VeBes. Over time, Licht en Liefde became an association which provided education, jobs, and entertainment for the blind and the visually impaired. The organisation was financially supported by donations, and by sales of a blindenbloempje (blind flower). The staff consisted solely of volunteers. == Consolidation and professionalisation (1933-2000) == From 1933 on, Licht en Liefde employed paid staff members. Regional service centers were set up in Flanders and Brussels. In 1938, Licht en Liefde built a residence for the blind and the visually impaired in Antwerp, which grew into an autonomous organisation named De Markgrave. In 1948, Licht and Liefde employed social workers who offered assistance at home. From 1955 on, initiatives such as books with large print, spoken literature, and low-vision assistance came to be. Sint-Rafaël, a school offering vocational training for those who had become blind at an older age rather than being born with an impairment, was founded in 1959 in Ghent. In 1957, a holiday home was built in Brasschaat. It was moved to Varsenare in 1969, and was turned into a day center in 1979. The headquarters of Licht and Liefde were also moved to Varsenare. They originally were located at Jeruzalemstraat in Bruges. == Literature for the blind == In 1964, Licht en Liefde was given the Visser Neerlandia award for their printed books for the blind. In 1981, the organisation procured an electronic braille printer, which was developed by KU Leuven. As time went by, the home computer became a revolutionary aid to the blind and the visually impaired. Therefore, Licht en Liefde took it upon itself to strive towards making the use of electronic equipment more accessible. This resolution has resulted in a project named BlindSurfer (2001), which was renamed AnySurfer in 2006.The BlindSurfer Project, in Web Accessibility: Web Standards and Regulatory Compliance by Richard Rutter, Apress, 2007. The Vlaamse klank- en braillebibliotheek, owned by Licht en Liefde, was fused in 2008 with Vlaamse luister- en braillebibliotheek. The current name of the resulting braille- and audiobook library is Luisterpuntbibliotheek. == Inclusion and networking (after 2000) == In the 21st century, the principle of inclusion became an established concept. This concept states that everyone should work towards making sure disabled individuals are able to fully partake in all aspects of society. Licht en Liefde strives towards this goal by employing volunteers, who are often blind or visually impaired themselves. Their input is an essential part of the expertise Licht en Liefde has built throughout the years. Licht en Liefde has set up a network through which it collaborates with organisations such as VeBes, Huis 45, and Sint-Rafaël. In 2008, a structural cooperation between Licht en Liefde and the Koninklijke Maatschappij voor Blinden en Slechtzienden (KMBS vzw) was established. This network included three new projects: * Vlaams Oogfonds: offers financial support to initiatives that provide help to the blind and the visually impaired. * Vlaamse Ooglijn: a voice over IP network and information exchange in which the internet is used to help the blind and the visually impaired. * Vlaams Oogpunt: stimulates the collaboration of organisations and projects regarding the blind and the visually impaired that complement and strengthen each other. == Sources == * * Category:Non-profit organisations based in Belgium Category:Blindness organizations Category:1923 establishments in Belgium ","title":"Licht en Liefde"},{"id":"56754168","text":"Jacobus Petrus (Kosie) Marais (22 June 1900 – 8 April 1963), was the son of Jacobus Petrus (Kowie) Marais and Catharina Elizabeth (Kitty) Eksteen.

As a child in school his brother Eksteen (Johannes Eksteen) and he had a workshop and laboratory on the farm. In the workshop they generated electricity. In the laboratory they experiment with gunpowder. In 1921 Kosie had to stop his studies at Stellenbosch University and had to farm as his father Kowie was ill. His father died in 1922. Eksteen and Kosie became owners of the farms Klipdrift and Wonderfontein. His sister Judith Maria Magdalena, helped on the farm too. She later married a de Wet.

This Company became part of Distell His brands has won awards and it's ranked as a brandy in South Africa and the world. It is still made to Marais's recipe. Today his brandy is still sold in South Africa and other countries. == Other activities  Archeology === Fritz Heese introduced Kosie to archeology. According to Major C.R Wolhuter, he and Kosie were the only two residents of Robertson, South Africa that were members of the Society to Promote Science. Kosie worked through the society as an archaeologist. He made contact with Henri Breuil. His theory was that tools made of stone that he found in the soil were older than the San people. He and Abbé Breuil took a trip to South West Africa and Bechuanaland. Breuil agreed with his theory.

By 1 December, the 1st Brigade had destroyed approximately 1,000 fortifications within the Zone. With the May Tao Secret Zone neutralized and Highway 1 secured, units from the 15th and 86th Engineer Battalions repaired or replaced 11 bridges, resurfaced the road and created a cleared zone of 100m on each side of the Highway.

The species has suffered a catastrophic reduction in range and distribution as a result of clearing for agriculture, then by urban expansion until only about four hundred plants remain in the wild. ==Description== Diuris basaltica is a tuberous, perennial herb tall with between three and seven linear, green leaves, each long and wide. There are up to three bright golden yellow to orange-yellow flowers, wide with a few dark streaks. The flowers often do not open widely and lean downwards. The dorsal sepal is long, wide and more or less erect. The lateral sepals curve downwards, long, wide. The ear-like petals are egg-shaped, long, wide with a green stalk, long. The labellum has three lobes, the lateral ones small, wedge-shaped and pimply. The middle lobe is broadly egg-shaped, long, wide with two widely separated ridges near the base and a central ridge extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs from September to October. ==Taxonomy and naming== Diuris basaltica was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones and the description was published in Australian Orchid Review. The specific epithet (basaltica) is a Latin word referring to the soils derived from basalt in which this orchid grows. ==Distribution and habitat== Little golden moths grows with kangaroo grass on eastern parts of the basalt plain to the west of Melbourne. The orchid once had a wider distribution on the volcanic plains of south-western Victoria but has suffered a catastrophic decline, firstly due to clearing of its habitat for agriculture and later by urbanisation. ==Conservation== Diuris basaltica only survives in three populations, the largest of which includes about 400 plants on private property. Only five plants are conserved in a reserve and another two plants occur in the third population on private land. The main threats to the species are habitat loss, disturbance to or destruction of plants, grazing, weed invasion and altered fire regimes.

Reinforcement is a process within speciation where natural selection increases the reproductive isolation between two populations of species by reducing the production of hybrids. Evidence for speciation by reinforcement has been gathered since the 1990s, and along with data from comparative studies and laboratory experiments, has overcome many of the objections to the theory. Differences in behavior or biology that inhibit formation of hybrid zygotes are termed prezygotic isolation. Reinforcement can be shown to be occurring (or to have occurred in the past) by measuring the strength of prezygotic isolation in a sympatric population in comparison to an allopatric population of the same species. Comparative studies of this allow for determining large- scale patterns in nature across various taxa. Mating patterns in hybrid zones can also be used to detect reinforcement.Daniel J. Howard (1993). Reinforcement: origin, dynamics and fate of an evolutionary hypothesis. In: Harrison, R. G. (eds) Hybrid Zones and the Evolutionary Process, Oxford University Press, pp. 46–69. Reproductive character displacement is seen as a result of reinforcement, so many of the cases in nature express this pattern in sympatry. Reinforcement's prevalence is unknown, but the patterns of reproductive character displacement are found across numerous taxa (vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and fungi), and is considered to be a common occurrence in nature. Studies of reinforcement in nature often prove difficult, as alternative explanations for the detected patterns can be asserted. Nevertheless, empirical evidence exists for reinforcement occurring across various taxa and its role in precipitating speciation is conclusive. == Evidence from nature  Amphibians === The southern brown tree frog, Litoria ewingi The two frog species Litoria ewingi and L. verreauxii live in southern Australia with their two ranges overlapping. The species have very similar calls in allopatry, but express clinal variation in sympatry, with notable distinctness in calls that generate female preference discrimination. The zone of overlap sometimes forms hybrids and is thought to originate by secondary contact of once fully allopatric populations. Allopatric populations of Gastrophryne olivacea and G. carolinensis have recently come into secondary contact due to forest clearing. The calls that the males make to attract females differ significantly in frequency and duration in the area where the two species overlap, despite them having similar calls where they do not. Further, the hybrids that form in sympatry have calls that are intermediate between the two. Similar patterns of reproductive character displacement involving acoustic displays have been found in Hyla cinerea and H. gratiosa, with greater female preference for conspecific males in areas of sympatry. Three species of true frogs (Lithobates sphenocephalus, L. berlandieri, and L. blairi) are temporally isolated in that their breeding seasons are spaced out in areas where they live in sympatry, but not where they live in allopatry. Selection against interspecific mating due to low hybrid fitness and low hybrid fertility has reinforced the observed character displacement of breeding times. The rainforests of northeast Queensland, Australia were separated into north and south refugia by climate fluctuations of the Pliocene and Pleistocene. About 6500 years ago, the rainforests reconnected, bringing the diverged, incipient populations of Litoria genimaculata into secondary contact. The species contact zones exhibit, \\"strong postzygotic selection against hybrids\\" and enhanced isolation from differences in mating call. An alternative to detecting reproductive character displacement in populations that overlap in sympatry is measuring rates of hybridization in contact zones. The frog species Anaxyrus americanus and Anaxyrus woodhousii have shown a decrease in hybridization from 9%–0% over approximately 30 years. A similar pattern was detected in the sympatric spadefoot toads Spea multiplicata and S. bombifrons have hybridized with decreasing frequency over a 27-year period (about 13 generations). === Birds === The small ground finch, one of Darwin's finches of the Galápagos The Ficedula flycatchers exhibit a pattern that suggests premating isolation is being reinforced by sexual selection. The pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) has brown females, brown males, and black-and- white males. The related collard flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis) has brown females and only black-and-white males. The two species exist in separate populations that overlap in a zone of sympatry. In the range of overlap, only brown males of F. hypoleuca exist and are thought to have evolved the brown plumage to prevent hybridization. Mating choice tests of the species find that females of both species choose conspecific males in sympatry, but heterospecific males in allopatry (see conspecific song preference). The patterns could suggest mimicry, driven by interspecific competition; however, song divergence has been detected that shows a similar pattern to the mating preferences. Geospiza fulginosa and G. difficilis males on the Galápagos Islands show a noted preference for conspecific females where they meet in sympatry, but not in allopatry. Other birds such as the dark and light subspecies of the western grebe show enhanced prezygotic isolation.J. T. Ratti (1979). Reproductive Separation and Isolating Mechanisms between Sympatric Dark- and Light- Phase Western Grebes. American Ornithological Society, 93(3), 573–586. It has been argued that reinforcement is extremely common in birds and has been documented in a wide range of bird species. === Crustaceans === Reproductive character displacement in body size was detected in sympatric populations of Orconectes rusticus and O. sanbornii. === Echinoderms === An example of gametic isolation involves the allopatric sea urchins (Arbacia) have minimal bindin differences (bindin is a protein involved in the process of sea urchin fertilization, used for species-specific recognition of the egg by the sperm) and have insufficient barriers to fertilization. Comparison with the sympatric species Echinometra and Strongylocentrotus of the Indo-Pacific finds that they have significant differences in bindin proteins for fertilization and marked fertilization barriers. Echinometra viridis, one of several species in the genus that produce fertile hybrids. Laboratory matings of closely related sea urchin species Echinometra oblonga and E. sp. C (the species is unnamed, dubbed C) produce fertile and viable hybrids, but are unable to fertilize eggs of the parent species due to divergence of the alleles that code for bindin proteins: an example of post-zygotic isolation. Populations in sympatry manifest this difference in bindin protein versus those in allopatry. Selection actively acts against the formation of hybrids in both nature (as no documented cases of hybrids have been found) and in the laboratory. Here, the evolution of female egg receptors is thought to pressure bindin evolution in a selective runaway process. This example of reproductive character displacement is highly suggestive of being the result of—and has been cited as strong evidence for—reinforcement. === Fish === In British Columbia, benthic and limnetic morphs of Gasterosteus aculeatus exist together in sympatry in some lakes, while containing only one morph in other lakes. Female benthic morphs in sympatric populations actively discriminate against limnetic males, resulting in low rates of crossing (some gene flow has occurred between the morphs) and low fitness hybrids. Both selection against hybrids and reproductive character displacement in egg fertilization is observed in Etheostoma lepidum and E. spectabile. === Fungi === A strong case of reinforcement occurring in fungi comes from studies of Neurospora. In crosses between different species in the genera, sympatric pairs show low reproductive success, significantly lower than allopatric pairs. This pattern is observed across small and large geographic scales, with distance correlating with reproductive success. Further evidence of reinforcement in the species was the low fitness detected in the hybrids create from crosses, and that no hybrids have been found in nature, despite close proximity. === Insects === Ethological isolation has been observed between some mosquito species in the Southeast Asian Aedes albopictus group, suggesting—from laboratory experiments of mating trials—that selection against hybrids is occurring, in the presence of reproductive character displacement. Female mate discrimination is increased with intermediate migration rates between allopatric populations of Timema cristinae (genus Timema) compared to high rates of migration (where gene flow impedes selection) or low rates (where selection is not strong enough). Distribution of the periodical cicadas in the U.S. The yellow area corresponds to the sympatric overlap of Magicicada neotredecim (blue) with Magicicada tredecim (red) Where the ranges of the cicada species Magicicada tredecim and M. neotredecim overlap (where they are sympatric), the pitch of M. neotredecim male calling songs is roughly 1.7 kHz compared to 1.1 kHz for those of M. tredecim, with corresponding female song pitch preference differences. In allopatric M. neotredecim populations, the mating call pitch is 1.3–1.5 kHz. The biogeography of the cicadas suggests that M. neotredecim originated after the retreat of the last glacial advance in North America. The song differences of Laupala crickets on the Hawaiian Islands appear to exhibit patterns consistent with character displacement in sympatric populations.Roger K. Butlin (1989). Reinforcement of premating isolation. In Otte, D. and Endler, John A. (eds) Speciation and its Consequences, Sinauer Associates, pp. 158–179, A similar pattern exists with Allonemobius fasciatus and A. socius, species of ground crickets in eastern North America. Males in sympatric populations of the damselflies Calopteryx maculata and C. aequabilis are able to discriminate between females of different species better than those in allopatric populations; with females of C. aequabilis in sympatric populations exhibiting lighter wing colors compared to allopatric females—an illustration of reproductive character displacement. Fifteen species of sympatrically distributed Agrodiaetus butterflies with pronounced differences in wing color pattern likely arose as a result of speciation by reinforcement. Phylogenetic patterns indicate the differences arose in allopatry and were reinforced when the distributions came into secondary contact.  Drosophila  Drosophila fruit fly Drosophila is one of the most studied species in speciation research. Dobzhansky and Koller were the first to study isolation between Drosophila species. Since then, other studies of natural populations such as the D. paulistorum races exhibiting stronger isolation in sympatry versus allopatry, or the enhanced isolation found in sympatric populations of D. mojavensis and D. arizonae in southwest America. Rare, sterile hybrids form between D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis, with sympatric D. pseudoobscura females discriminating against D. persimilis males; more so than allopatric populations. Other Drosophila research on reinforcement has been from laboratory experiments and is discussed below. On the east coast of Australia, D. serrata shares a zone of sympatric overlap with the closely relates species D. birchii. The species exhibits reproductive character displacement, with sexual selection operating on the hydrocarbons of the flies cuticle. Reinforcement appears to be driving their speciation in nature, supported by simulated experimental laboratory populations. === Mammals === The deer mice Peromyscus leucopus and P. gossypinus exhibit reproductive character displacement in mating preferences, with heterospecific matings taking place between the species. === Molluscs === Some gastropod shells, like those of Partula can coil in sinistral and dextral directions such as these, Neptunea angulata (left) and N. despecta (right) shells. Partula suturalis is polymorphic for shell chirality in that it has two forms: sinistral (left-handed) and dextral (right-handed) shells, unlike other monomorphic species on the island of Mo'orea which have only one form (with the exception of P. otaheitana). This polymorphic trait has a direct effect on mate choice and mating behavior; as shown in laboratory mating tests that opposite-coil pairs mate much less often. In areas where P. suturalis lives sympatrically with other sinistral and dextral Partula species, the opposite P. suturalis morph is typically present. Butlin succinctly describes one example of this unique pattern: > P. suturalis is sympatric with the dextral P. aurantia and sinistral P. > olympia, whose ranges abut but do not overlap; P. suturalis is sinestral in > the range of P. aurantia and dextral in the range of P. olympia and does not > normally hybridize with either species. However, where their ranges meet > there is a sharp transition in the coil of P. suturalis and in this > transition zone it hybridizes with both P. aurantia and P. olympia. The reversal in chirality to sinistrality must have evolved as an isolating mechanism, with patterns of reproductive character displacement suggesting speciation by reinforcement. Satsuma largillierti lives on the western half of Okinawa Island while Satsuma eucosmia lives on the eastern half. Both populations overlap in sympatry along the middle of the island, where the penis length of the species differs significantly in sympatry (a case of reproductive character displacement), but not in allopatry. A similar pattern in snails is found with Lymnaea peregra and L. ovata in the Swiss lake Seealpsee; with mating signal acting as the sympatrically displaced trait. The abalone genus Haliotis has 19 species that occur in sympatry and one that occurs in allopatry. Of the sympatric species, they all contain sperm lysin that drives gamete isolation, but the allopatric species does not. A similar pattern of sperm lysin differentiation is found in the mussel species Mytilus galloprovincalis and M. trossulus and has likely occurred within the last 200 years due to human-mediated distribution by ships. === Plants === Plants are thought to provide suitable conditions for reinforcement to occur. This is due to a number of factors such as the unpredictability of pollination, pollen vectors, hybridization, hybrid zones, among others. The study of plants experiencing speciation by reinforcement has largely been overlooked by researchers; however, there is evidence of its occurrence in them. In the Texas wildflower Phlox drummondii, cis-regulatory mutations of genes that code for anthocyanin pigmentation have caused genetic divergence of two populations. Hybrids (between P. drummondii and P. cuspidata) with maladaptive, intermediate characteristics are under-pollinated; increasing reproductive isolation through reinforcement. The maintenance of the ancestral flower color in the allopatric population is favored weakly by selection, where the derived color in the sympatric population is being driven by strong selection. Similarly, in P. pilosa and P. glaberrima, character displacement of petal color has been driven by selection, aided by pollen discrimination. Displacement in flower size has also been observed in the nightshade species Solanum grayi and S. lymholtzianum in sympatry as well as S. rostratum and S. citrullifolium. The bishop pine is divided into two populations distinguished by monoterpene, stomata, and alloenzyme differences; flowering time; and needle color: blue foliage in the northern population and green foliage in the southern populations in California. A small region exists where the species meet in a cline—sustained by selection due to a flowering time divergence, thought to represent reinforcement taking place. Similar patterns of both character displacement in sympatric populations of species have been documented in: * Agrostis tenuis * Anthoxanthum odoratum * Gilia * Costus plants: Costus allenii, C. laevis, and C. guanaiensis; C. pulverulentus and C. scaber * A unique case of post-zygotic instead of prezygotic isolation has been observed in both Gossypium and Gilia, suggesting that in plants, post- zygotic isolation's role in reinforcement may play a larger role. == Comparative studies == Prezygotic isolation in allopatric (red) and sympatric (blue) species pairs of Drosophila. Gradients indicate the predictions of reinforcement for allopatric and sympatric populations. Assortive mating is expected to increase among sympatric populations experiencing reinforcement. This fact allows for the direct comparison of the strength of prezygotic isolation in sympatry and allopatry between different experiments and studies. Jerry Coyne and H. Allen Orr surveyed 171 species pairs, collecting data on their geographic mode, genetic distance, and strength of both prezygotic and post-zygotic isolation; finding that prezygotic isolation was significantly stronger in sympatric pairs, correlating with the ages of the species. Additionally, the strength of post-zygotic isolation was not different between sympatric and allopatric pairs. This finding lends support the predictions of speciation by reinforcement and correlates well with another later study by Daniel J. Howard. In his study, 48 studies with observed reproductive character displacement (including plants, insects, crustaceans, molluscs, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) were analyzed. The cases met several criteria such as the trait in question serving as a reproductive barrier and if there existed clear patterns of sympatry versus allopatry. Out of the 48 candidates, 69 percent (33 cases) found enhanced isolation in sympatry, suggesting that the pattern predicted by reinforcement is common in nature. In addition to Howard's comparative study, he guarded against the potential for positive-result publication bias by surveying 37 studies of hybrid zones. A prediction of reinforcement is that assortive mating should be common in hybrid zones; a prediction that was confirmed in 19 of the 37 cases. A survey of the rates of speciation in fish and their associated hybrid zones found similar patterns in sympatry, supporting the occurrence of reinforcement.A. R. McCune and N. R. Lovejoy. (1998). The relative rate of sympatric and allopatric speciation in fishes. In D. J. Howard and S. H. Berlocher (eds) Endless Forms: Species and Speciation, Oxford University Press, pp. 172–185. One study in the plants Glycine and Silene; however, did not find enhanced isolation. == Laboratory experiments == Laboratory studies that explicitly test for reinforcement are limited. In general, two types of experiments have been conducted: using artificial selection to mimic natural selection that eliminates the hybrids (often called \\"destroy-the-hybrids\\"), and using disruptive selection to select for a trait (regardless of its function in sexual reproduction). Many experiments using the destroy-the- hybrids technique are generally cited as supportive of reinforcement; however, some researchers such as Coyne and Orr and William R. Rice and Ellen E. Hostert contend that they do not truly model reinforcement, as gene flow is completely restricted between two populations. The table below summarizes some of the laboratory experiments that are often cited as testing reinforcement in some form. {  +Laboratory studies of reinforcement !Species !Experimental design !Result !Year - Drosophila paulistorum  rowspan=\\"9\\" Destroyed hybrids Prezygotic isolation 1976 - D.pseudoobscura & D. persimilis  rowspan=\\"4\\" Prezygotic isolation; reproductive character displacement 1950 - Zea mays 1969 -  rowspan=\\"14\\" D. melanogaster 1974 - 1956 - No prezygotic isolation detected 1970 -  rowspan=\\"3\\" Prezygotic isolation 1953 - 1974 - 1971 1973 1979 -  rowspan=\\"3\\" Allopatric populations in secondary contact  1982 -  1991Lee Ehrman, Marney A.

Saravanan wanted to remake the film in Hindi. Deivapiravi star Sivaji Ganesan advised him against doing so, feeling it would not come well. Saravanan ignored Ganesan's advice, and remade the film in that language with the title Bindiya. Krishnan–Panju, the directors of Deivapiravi, returned to direct the remake. == Soundtrack == The soundtrack of the film was composed by Iqbal Qureshi. The song \\"Main Apne Aap Se Ghabra Gaya Hoon\\" attained popularity. == Release and reception == Bindiya was released on 29 December 1960.

(* 4 February 1916 in Budapest; † 1 July 1994 in Irving, Texas) was an American monk, historian and university professor born in Hungary. == Life and work == Julius (Gyula) Lékai was a student at the Cistercian school (Budai-Ciszterci-Szent Imre-Gymnasium) in Budapest and entered the noviciate at Zirc Abbey in 1934. He was ordained a priest in 1941 and completed his doctorate a year later at Budapest University. His Dissertation was an analysis of Hungarian historical research in the period 1790–1830. He taught at the Cistercian school (Gárdonyi Géza Ciszterci Gimnázium) in Eger until 1947. He also taught history at the Faculty of Laws at the Károly-Eszterházy University in Eger (1943–1944). During the Second World War he was a military chaplain for the Hungarian Army. He fled to the United States in October 1947; he became an American citizen in 1953. Lekai's first home in the USA was Our Lady of Spring Bank Abbey in Wisconsin; from 1953 to 1955 he lived in Buffalo, teaching at Canisius College, and as of 1955 he was in the Cistercian Abbey of Our Lady of Dallas. He was made prior there in 1969 and served as such until 1976. In sum he was Assistant Professor of History at Canisius from 1952 to 1956. 1956 he was made Associate Professor at the University of Dallas, advancing to full Professor in 1958 and teaching there until his retirement in 1986. Lekai's research addressed aspects of Cistercian history which were rarely covered before his time, such as Baroque abbeys in France immediately before the French Revolution and Cistercian involvement at great European universities, most notably in Paris. He was able to reshape common perceptions of urban monks and feudal abbeys by applying concentrated analysis of archival sources. His personal fate as a refugee had forced him to learn many languages, so that he had an overview of monastic research in all the major European languages. His general history of the Cistercian Order (subtitled in a manner typical for Lekai Ideals and Reality) was the standard work for decades, going into several reprints and translations. A stroke suffered in 1981 made him unable to speak or write until his death 13 years later. == Publications == *The White Monks.

As of September 2020, he is a member of the Italian Aspen Institute.executive Committee, aspeninstitute.it/ === Competitive Sports === In his youth, Alberto Quadrio Curzio, was a successful and talented alpine skier (in Bormio was trained by the Olympic champion Stefano Sertorelli). He was the only skier, along with Gustav Thöni, to win the Italian Junior Championships in all three disciplines in 1955. He decided to leave competitive skiing on the eve of the 1956 Cortina d'Ampezzo Winter Olympics to concentrate on his studies.Un secolo di turismo in Valtellina. Viaggio fra storia e attualità, Credito Valtellinese Electa, 2004, pag. 394. Mario Cotelli (Coach and Technical Director for the Italian National alpine skiing team in the seventies) wrote that A. Quadrio Curzio was the precursor of the “independent ski action technique” (later adopted by J.C.Killy) and the “push step technique” (later used by G.Thoeni) . == Scientific Contributions == His research has mainly focused on three streams of analysis: a) Theory of scarce resources and of structural dynamics, with significant contributions to the theory of rent and technical progress. Already since the second half of the 1960s, he has shown, through the use of multisector analytical methods, how changes in structural technologies and technical progress could depend both on income distribution with rents explicitly considered and on the achievement of a scarcity limit of some resource, or on the mix of the two mentioned elements. With other analytical methods, he also examined the role of investments in education on economic growth. b) Institutional and applied economics, with specific reference to the European and Italian economies, highlighting two types of factors for development: the relations between institutions, the society and the economy, on the one hand and on the other, the interactions among the various levels of subsidiarity (vertical and horizontal) as pillars of social liberalism. c) The history of political economic thought, with particular reference to Italy, starting from concepts on Enlightenment developed around Cesare Beccaria, from the second half of the 1700s and subsequent extensions, up to more recent times, identifying a stream of thought which unites civil progress (of institutionalist economists) with technical-scientific progress (of engineering economists) in creative and sustainable development. Regarding the more properly institutional and social aspects, he has given appreciable attention to subsidiarity and solidarity which find their roots also in Christian social thought. His scholarly works are mostly collected in a key bibliography and thoroughly examined in a Festschrift edited by Gilberto Antonelli, Mario Maggioni, Giovanni Pegoretti, Fausta Pellizzari, Roberto Scazzieri, Roberto Zoboli «Economia come scienza sociale. Teoria, istituzioni, storia. Studi in onore di Alberto Quadrio Curzio» called «Economia come scienza sociale. Teoria, istituzioni, storia. Studi in onore di Alberto Quadrio Curzio» - published by Il Mulino in 2012 with contributions from 32 of his colleagues (many of whom were once his students). A further Festschrift was dedicated to him in a volume edited by Mauro L. Baranzini, Claudia Rotondi, Roberto Scazzieri «Resources, Production and Structural Dynamics» entitled «Resources, Production and Structural Dynamics» - published by Cambridge University Press in 2015. This book contains contributions by Mauro L. Baranzini, Claudia Rotondi, Roberto Scazzieri, Luigi L. Pasinetti, D'Maris Dalton Coffman, Heinz D. Kurz, Neri Salvadori, Piercarlo Nicola, Albert E. Steenge, Carlo D'Adda, Faye Duchin, Heinrich Bortis, Kumaraswamy Vela Velupillai, Michael A.

Lastly, other scholarly contributions were assessed in «A compendium of Italian economists at Oxbridge» edited by Mauro L. Baranzini and Amalia Mirante «A compendium of Italian economists at Oxbridge» (Palgrave MacMillan, 2016). In it is an extremely effective evaluation, especially of his research in the first stream of analysis. == Publications == He has published more than 400 works, many in English – one book was translated into Chinese. The Econlit database contains more than 100 records of articles, works, and books either written or edited by Alberto Quadrio Curzio.

Except for a gap in Metro Manila and ferry connections, the highway is generally continuous. Most sections of N1 forms the Pan-Philippine Highway except for sections bypassed by expressways. ==Route description== N1 follows a route that runs from Laoag in Ilocos Norte to Zamboanga City via Bicol Region, Eastern Visayas and eastern parts of Mindanao. The highway connects most major regional centers on its route, and runs through different landscapes. The highway is mostly named Maharlika Highway, but other sections uses different names. ===Ilocos Region=== N1 begins at Laoag, at the endpoint of Manila North Road (N2) in front of the Ilocos Norte Provincial Capitol. The highway then runs as a principal city street named General Segundo Avenue, which passes through the city proper and through its outskirts. Approaching Bacarra, it becomes a rural highway, lined with a 69,000 volt power line that feeds power from the Bangui Wind Farm. At Bacarra, it bypasses the town center to the north and runs through a rural area and then enters Pasuquin, where it serves as a major municipal street. Between Bacarra and Burgos, it becomes a rural two-lane highway that closely parallels a transmission line from Burgos Wind Farm and passes through interspersed barangays along the South China Sea (West Philippine Sea) coastline. It soon climbs the mountains upon approach to Burgos, where the highway directly serves the town. The highway zigzags through the rough terrain, and overlooks the beach where Bangui Wind Farm lies. It then passes through Bangui, where it runs as a major street on the town center, crosses Bulu River and enters Pagudpud, which it bypasses. N1 runs through the foothills that mark the edge of the Northern Luzon Cordillera and runs close to the coastline of Bashi Channel, where the highway zigzags through the cliffs through the Patapat Viaduct, a viaduct that is required for the highway to pass the steep cliffs marking the northern edge of the Luzon Cordillera. ===Cagayan Valley=== In Cagayan province, N1 is known as the Bangag-Magapit Road from Aparri to Lal-lo and Cagayan Valley Road from Magapit Interchange in Lal-lo to Tuguegarao. It then enters the province of Isabela as Maharlika Highway. ===Central Luzon=== Nueva Ecija Bulacan San Rafael, Bulacan The highway soon enters Bulacan at San Miguel, where it begins on a straight route. It then enters the poblacion of San Miguel, which it bypasses, and the highway begins to curve through most of its length between San Ildefonso and San Rafael, where the route runs through rice paddies. It closely follows a transmission corridor between the San Miguel-San Ildefonso boundary and San Rafael, and a Meralco subtransmission line uses the highway on that portio. Plaridel Bypass Road intersects with Doña Remedios Trinidad Highway just before approaching the poblacion of San Rafael. The highway curves to the southwest near Baliuag, where the highway is known as Doña Remedios Trinidad Highway, while the old Cagayan Valley Road enters Baliuag. It serves as a bypass of Baliuag, with a flyover built on the intersection with another national road leading to Candaba. A Meralco subtransmission line follows the highway again up to Pulilan, where it leaves to follow Pulilan Bypass and Pulilan Regional Road. At Pulilan, it serves as a principal route through the town center. At Guiguinto, it crosses the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) along with an interchange. It soon crosses the original route of NLEX at Barangay Tabang, where it also crosses the Philippine National Railways right of way. N1 begins to follow MacArthur Highway, which serves as a major toll-free highway over southern Bulacan. It soon enters Balagtas, where it directly passes through its poblacion. It soon crosses the Bigaa River, where it passes through residential and industrial areas, and curves upon entrying Bocaue, where it bypasses the town center. A flyover restricted for use by light vehicles crosses Fortunato Halili Avenue to Santa Maria, and service roads serve as frontage and heavy vehicle routes. The highway then curves, then, runs through the residential barangays of Bocaue and soon enters Marilao and Meycauayan. ===Metro Manila=== Valenzuela to Pasay Entering Metro Manila, the highway follows MacArthur Highway over Valenzuela, which runs on a four to six-lane highway up to the Bonifacio Monument in Caloocan. N1 then turns east to follow the whole EDSA to Pasay. The whole road is notorious for congestion which cause delays as well as economic losses in the metropolis. EDSA runs through the central business districts of Metro Manila, most notably Araneta Center, Ortigas Center, and Makati Central Business District. The Manila Line 3 and the Manila Line 1 extension utilizes the center island of EDSA on most segments between Caloocan and Pasay. N1 ends below the EDSA Flyover at Roxas Boulevard in Pasay. A gap in the highway is filled by the South Luzon Expressway and Skyway between Makati and Muntinlupa. It would have been filled by Taft Avenue Extension, starting from EDSA, going southwards via Quirino and Diego Cera Avenues and ends at Maharlika Highway below Alabang Viaduct through Alabang- Zapote Road, if only they were not renumbered from N1. N1 was previously designated to Rizal, Taft, Quirino and Diego Cera Avenues and Alabang-Zapote Road, based on the old route numbering system (prior to 2014), before their N1 number designations were decommissioned and replaced with their respective route numbers. Muntinlupa N1 starts again below the Alabang Viaduct in Alabang, Muntinlupa, where it intersects with South Luzon Expressway (SLEX/E2/AH26), Alabang–Zapote Road, and Montillano Street (N142). The highway assumes the name Maharlika Highway, Manila South Road, or locally, National Road. It runs as a commercial artery through the city until the boundary with Laguna in San Pedro over the Tunasan River. ===Calabarzon=== San Pedro- Calamba N1 in Biñan N1 generally serves as a four-lane toll-free highway serving the suburban cities of northwestern Laguna alongside the toll South Luzon Expressway. Most sections of N1 between San Pedro and Calamba serve as commercial streets. It is mostly lined by high voltage sub-transmission lines owned by Meralco, which are placed along the highway for economic and accessibility reasons. Most of N1 is four lane with a painted median divider. It enters Laguna in San Pedro, where it serves as a major commercial street, with a maximum of four lanes. At Biñan, it intersects N65 in a traffic light intersection west of the poblacion. ===Bicol Region=HistoryIntersectionsBypassesLaoag Bypass Road=== The Laoag Bypass Road is a bypass that serves as an alternative route to Laoag International Airport. ===Felipe Vergara Highway=== Felipe Vergara Highway is a city- maintained bypass of Maharlika Highway over Cabanatuan. ===Plaridel Bypass Road=Baliuag Bypass Road=Tiaong Bypass Road=Candelaria Bypass Road=Sariaya Bypass Road=Zigzag Road=Lopez Bypass Road=Almeda Highway=Pili Bypass Road=Carlos P. Garcia National Highway (Davao City Diversion Road)=== The Carlos P. Garcia National Highway is a two-to-six lane road that bypasses N1 from Lanang to Bangkal.

It runs through western Luzon from Quezon City in the south to Rosario in the north. Map of the E1 expressway ==Quezon City to Mabalacat== The southern section of the E1 forms most of the North Luzon Expressway, a 4- to 8-lane limited-access toll expressway that connects Metro Manila to the provinces of the Central Luzon region in the Philippines. It was built in the 1960s and has a length of . The expressway begins in Quezon City at the Balintawak Interchange with EDSA as a continuation of Andres Bonifacio Avenue. It then passes through Caloocan and Valenzuela in Metro Manila, and the provinces of Bulacan and Pampanga in Central Luzon. It currently ends at Mabalacat and merges with the MacArthur Highway, which continues northward into the rest of Central and Northern Luzon. Originally controlled by the Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC), operation and maintenance of the NLEx was transferred in 2005 to NLEX Corporation, a subsidiary of Metro Pacific Investments Corporation (a former subsidiary of the Lopez Group of Companies until 2008). A major upgrade and rehabilitation was completed in February 2005, with the road now having similar qualities to a modern French tollway. It is also a part of the Asian Highway 26 (AH26) from Balintawak to Santa Rita exit, which continues the AH26 designation via N1 (Maharlika Highway). ==Mabalacat to Tarlac City== The central section of the E1 forms part of the Subic–Clark–Tarlac Expressway, a four-lane expressway built by the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA), a government owned and controlled corporation under the Office of the President of the Philippines. Started on April 5, 2005, the Subic–Clark–Tarlac Expressway (SCTEX) is the country’s longest expressway at . Commercial operations started on April 28, 2008, with the opening of the Subic-Clark Segment and Zone A of the portion of Clark-Tarlac Segment. The opening of Zones B and C of the remaining Clark- Tarlac Segment on July 25, 2008 signaled the full operations of the SCTEX. ==Tarlac City to Rosario== The northern section of the E1 forms the Tarlac–Pangasinan–La Union Expressway, a four-lane expressway currently under construction north of Manila, in the Philippines. It connects central to northern Luzon, with its southernmost terminal located in Tarlac City, Tarlac and its planned northernmost terminus currently slated to be at Rosario, La Union. The first section of the project, from Tarlac City to Pura, Tarlac, has been operating on a \\"soft opening\\" basis since October 31, 2013, and was ready for full operation in November 2013. Part of the second segment, which will take motorists up to Ramos, Tarlac, opened on December 23, 2013. The remaining section from Anao, Tarlac up to Rosales, Pangasinan, is projected for a mid-2014 opening, and the final section ending in Rosario, La Union, is slated for completion in June 2019.

In a game with tank controls, players control movement relative to the position of the player character. Pressing up (for example on a D-pad, analog stick, or cursor movement keys) on the game controller moves the character in the direction they face, down reverses them, and left and right rotates them. This differs from many 3D games, in which characters move in the direction players push from the perspective of the camera. The term \\"tank controls\\" comes from the steering mechanisms of old tanks, which had to stop completely before turning. Tank controls were common in 3D games in the late 1990s, such as Grim Fandango and the early Resident Evil and Tomb Raider games. Tank controls allow players to maintain a direction when the camera angle changes. Grim Fandango designer Tim Schafer chose the system as it allowed the developers to create \\"cinematic\\" camera cuts without disrupting the controls. Tank controls have received criticism for feeling stiff or cumbersome, and the remastered versions of Grim Fandango and Resident Evil include alternative control schemes. The system became less prevalent over time and free-roaming cameras became standard for 3D games. == References == Category:Video game terminology Category:Video game control methods ","title":"Tank controls"},{"id":"56754886","text":"Orites acicularis, commonly known as yellow bush, is an angiosperm endemic to Tasmania, Australia and is a member of the genus Orites within the family Proteaceae. The species was first described in 1810 by Scottish botanist Robert Brown in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London. == Description == Orites acicularis is a yellow-green coloured, woody, rounded shrub growing to approximately 1–1.5 m (3.28–4.92 ft) in height and 0.5–1 m (1.64–3.28 ft) in width, with many ascending branches. The leaves are of a conspicuous yellow-green colour; they are glabrous, sclerophyllous, approximately 10-35mm long, and rounded. They taper to a sharp point, which is typically more yellow than the rest of the leaf. The adaxial surface of the leaf has a shallow central groove, and the leaf margins are entire. Leaves attach to the woody stem by a 2–5 mm petiole. Flowering occurs in December, and presents upon a rachis which can be terminal or axillary. The perianth is homochlamydeous; it comprises four white-cream tepals with a groove running along the centre, and curling under to display the pink style. The immature fruit is a green similar to that of the leaves. The fruits are glabrous and oblong, with a elongated tip of reddish brown. When mature, the follicle is lignified and erect, approximately 15 mm long, and boat-shaped. The boat shape is due to the seeds having been released immediately upon maturity. == Habitat and distribution == Orites acicularis commonly occurs in Tasmanian sub-alpine mountain plateaus, heaths, and boulder fields with a geology of dolerite, granite, and diorite. Dolerite's slow rate of erosion results in shallow, low-nutrient soils with an abundance of rock fragments. In sub-alpine plateaus, depressions form in the boulder fields. There, vegetable and mineral matter accumulate, creating bogs or smaller areas of deep soil. Similarly, bolster heath impedes drainage, creating shallow peats. Other species of plants that commonly grow in this habitat include: Gleichenia alpina, Astelia alpina, Baeckea gunniana, Bauera rubioides, Orites revoluta, Richea sprengelioides, Tasmannia lanceolata, and Eucalyptus coccifera. == Adaptations to solar radiation == Orites acicularis has evolved a number of characteristics to assist with protection from solar radiation in excess of its photosynthetic requirements. Two such adaptations are its abaxial pseudohypodermis and its bundle sheath extensions. Bundle sheath extensions are formed when sclerenchyma and/or collenchyma cells around a bundle sheath extend to both the adaxial and abaxial epidermis layers of a leaf. The evolution of these bundle sheath extensions in species restricted to open vegetation in the family Proteaceae suggests that it is a recurring adaptation to provide protection against the high levels of solar radiation present. The Orites-type abaxial pseudohypodermis is defined as multiseriate, elongate sclerids forming a reticulum around the sub-stomatal cavities (Jordan et al. 2005) and acts as a further barrier to solar radiation that lies just below the cuticle of the plant. == Etymology == The specific epithet, , is derived from Latin and means \\"needle-shaped\\". == References == acicularis Category:Endemic flora of Tasmania Category:Plants described in 1810 ","title":"Orites acicularis"},{"id":"56754927","text":"The Second Pan-American Korfball Championship was held in Colombia from 2 March 2018 to 4 March 2018, with 6 national teams in competition.

She was a fierce supporter of women's rights and is known for having offered up her son's life in order to prevent a famine during the Mau Mau Uprising. == Early life == Ciokaraine was born in Gauki in 1909, the village situated in the Igembe region of the Meru district in central Kenya. After her parents passed away, she and her siblings were raised by their grandfather, Kabira wa Mwichuria, a well-known mundo mugo (medicine man). Ciokaraine was her grandfather's favorite and she accompanied him on his healing rounds. He treated people of all ages, and Ciokaraine was exposed to various situations notably involving women and children. == Defiance & Bravery == Early in 1954, during the resistance to the colonial settlers, a member of the Njuri Ncheke named Kibuti was dragged out of his home and killed by Mau Mau rebels during the Mau Mau Uprising, a war in the British Kenya Colony (1920–1963) between the Kenya Land and Freedom Army (KLFA), also known as Mau Mau, and the British authorities. This led to a ruling by British colonialists that accused the residents of Gauki of maintaining supply lines to the insurgents. They planned on moving the residents to Kiegoi, located in the Igembe South Constituency, to ensure they couldn't support the Mau Mau hiding in the nearby forests. Ciokaraine stood up bravely against the patriarchal Njuri Ncheke the senior chief of Igembe, M'Mruaa. He then ordered residents of Ithima and Akachiu to gather near the trade town of Maua and bring sacks and baskets with them. It was at this meeting that the colonial government took notice of Ciokaraine. At the gathering, the colonial authorities announced to the people that they were to uproot all edible food from their shambas (farms). Ciokaraine stood up defiantly and instructed the people, \\"The yams and bananas must not be uprooted.\\" The Senior chief was displeased with her disobedience and she was given direct orders to explain herself. She responded fearlessly and asked that, instead of destroying the food and potentially starving the entire region, the colonial forces must guard the yams and bananas and stop the Mau Mau from killing any more residents. \\"I am ready to sacrifice my son if that will stop the killing,\\" she stated. == Recognition == Her bravery changed the attitudes of the elders and started a system of \\"shamba-squatting,\\" where colonial forces occupied all farms close to the forests in order to prevent the Mau Mau from stealing the crops. A few weeks after the meeting, senior chief M'Muraa recommended Ciokaraine for the position of assistant chief. She was appointed the first female headman in April 1954 and held the position until she retired in 1959 after being involved in a car accident while on official duty. Ciokaraine survived the accident and remained active in her community after retirement. Her legacy continues and she is said to have been as famous as Cierume of the Mbeere and Wangu wa Makeri of the Gikuyu. == References == Category:1909 births Category:Year of death missing Category: People from Meru County Category:Kenyan activists Category:Kenyan politicians ","title":"Ciokaraine M'Barungu"},{"id":"56755001","text":"Wandia Gichuru is the CEO and co-founder of Vivo Activewear. == Early life and background == Wandia Gichuru was born in Montreal, Canada to a Canadian mother and a Kenyan father.

In 1964, awards were presented to Best Film in Tamil and Telugu apart from honoring the Best acting talent in Tamil cinema for the first time. Starting from 1967, awards were presented to Best Film in Malayalam cinema and the Kannada cinema was honored from 1970 onwards.

Between July 1963 and October 1990 he was in charge of the East German Statistical Authority (\\"Staatliche Zentralverwaltung für Statistik\\"). == Life == Arno Donda was born in Berlin. His father worked as a typesetter. He attended middle school in Rumburg and Berlin before transferring, in 1947, to an apprenticeship with the main office of the statistic office in the region that was, by this time, administered as the Soviet occupation zone. He left the school before attempting school final exams (\\"Abitur\\"), but by attending evening classes he was able to sit for and passed these exams in 1949 in Berlin as an external student, which opened the way to a university- level education. In 1947 he joined the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED), a new political party formed in the Soviet zone during April 1946, through a contentious political merger. The creation of the SED was presented as a way to prevent a repeat victory of right-wing populism by ensuring that the political left was unified. However, by the time the region was rebranded and relaunched, in October 1949, as the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) the SED was itself coming to be recognised as the ruling party in a new kind of one-party dictatorship. During 1949 Arno Donda obtained a job in the main office of the national Trade Commission, promoted to the position of \\"kommissarisches Leiter\\" by 1950, which was when he enrolled as a student at Berlin's Economics Academy (\\"Hochschule für Ökonomie\\" / HfÖ). He concluded his course in 1954 with a degree in Economics. Donda stayed on at the HfÖ, successively as an assistant, a chief assistant and a lecturer. He received his doctorate in economics in 1957. His dissertation concerned the relationship between retail prices and the cost of living. In 1959 he became Director of the Institute for Statistics at the HfÖ, retaining the position till his unexpected career switch in 1963. He obtained his habilitation (higher academic qualification) in 1962, becoming a professor as a result. This time his dissertation concerned the statistical reflection of the dynamics of performance and inputs in socialist retail trade in East Germany (\\"Die statistische Widerspiegelung der Dynamik von Leistung und Aufwand im sozialistischen Einzelhandel der DDR\\"). He was also appointed a member of the Bernau working group mandated to develop the so-called New Economic System of Planning and Management (\\"Neues Ökonomisches System der Planung und Leitung\\"/ NÖS). On 19 December 1962 Heinz Rauch, his wife, and two of his three sons were killed in a plane crash in Warsaw. Rauch was head of the East German Statistical Authority (\\"Staatliche Zentralverwaltung für Statistik\\") at the time. Despite being only 33, Arno Donda was appointed to take on the position. Reflecting the inherently political focus of the statistical authority, Donda took over Rauch's seat on the Ministerial Council between 1963 and 1967. He was also a member, between 1967 and 1990, of the Comecon standing committee for statistics. Between 1971 and 1990 he was a member of the International Statistical Institute, based in Leidschenveen- Ypenburg (den Haag)): while a member of that he became a founder member, in 1979, of the institute's commission for constructing a \\"Code of Ethics for Statisticians\\", which the institute subsequently accepted, by a resolution of its general assembly, on 21 August 1985. Despite the mutual suspicions arising from the Cold War tensions of the period, Arno Donda was widely respected in the international statistics community for his ability and integrity. Between 1980 and 1985 he served as vice-president of the Conference of European Statisticians: in 1987 he was its president. He also belonged to several other international academic institutions. On the domestic front, he became a corresponding member of the (East) German Academy of Sciences in 1979. == The Schürer report and the changes== Arno Donda was a co-author of the so-called Schürer report, presented on 30 October 1989. Other members of Schürer's team of economic experts included Ernst Höfner and Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski. The report comprised an \\"Analysis of the Economic Condition of the German Democratic Republic, with conclusions\\" (\\"Analyse der ökonomischen Lage der DDR mit Schlußfolgerungen\\"). It had been commissioned by the newly appointed Party Secretary Egon Krenz, for presentation to the Politburo. The analysis disclosed a catastrophic picture. The East German economy was over-indebted and had for years \\"been consuming itself\\" (\\"zehrt seit Jahren von der Substanz\\"). A far reaching economic reform programme was proposed, but in the view of the authors that would not be enough to avert looming national insolvency. The only remaining hope was massive additional loans from the German Federal Republic (\\"West Germany\\"). The winds of Glasnost had been blowing across from, of all places, Moscow since 1986 resonated strongly in the German Democratic Republic. Street protesters breached the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and it became clear that Soviet troops had no instructions to re-enact the brutal suppression of 1953 or 1968. As further changes unfolded during 1989/90 it turned out that the economic solution for the country would arrive not in the form of massive additional loans from the west, but as part of German reunification, which was formally enacted in October 1990. Donda successfully led the successful transition of the East German statistical authority towards integration with its formerly West German counterpart. Till December 1991 he held the title and office, \\"President of the General Statistical Service of the New Federal States\\". However, his task having been accomplished the Ministry officials informed him that they had no further use for his services. It was not an unusual experience after 1990 for former senior officials of the East German state, and a sense of injustice is evident in sources. Between 1992 and 1994 he was registered as unemployed. In January 1995 Donda was formally retired, reaching the age of 65 a couple of months later. Arno Donda died in Berlin. == Awards and honours == * 1964 East German Medal for Merit * 1969 Patriotic Order of Merit in silver * 1980 Banner of Labor == References == Category:1930 births Category:2008 deaths Category:People from East Berlin Category:Socialist Unity Party of Germany members Category:German statisticians Category:Recipients of the Patriotic Order of Merit in silver Category:Recipients of the Banner of Labor Category:Members of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin ","title":"Arno Donda"},{"id":"56755111","text":"Pellowski or Pelowski is a Polish masculine surname, its feminine counterpart is Pellowska or Pelowska.

The U.S. finance industry comprised only 10% of total non-farm business profits in 1947, but it grew to 50% by 2010. Over the same period, finance industry income as a proportion of GDP rose from 2.5% to 7.5%, and the finance industry's proportion of all corporate income rose from 10% to 20%. The mean earnings per employee hour in finance relative to all other sectors has closely mirrored the share of total U.S. income earned by the top 1% income earners since 1930. The mean salary in New York City's finance industry rose from $80,000 in 1981 to $360,000 in 2011, while average New York City salaries rose from $40,000 to $70,000. In 1988, there were about 12,500 U.S. banks with less than $300 million in deposits, and about 900 with more deposits, but by 2012, there were only 4,200 banks with less than $300 million in deposits in the U.S., and over 1,801 with more. The financial services industry constitutes the largest group of companies in the world in terms of earnings and equity market capitalization. However it is not the largest category in terms of revenue or number of employees. It is also a slow growing and extremely fragmented industry, with the largest company (Citigroup), only having a 3% US market share.The Opportunity: Small Global Market Share, Page 11, from the Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Strategic Decisions Conference – 6/02/04. In contrast, the largest home improvement store in the US, Home Depot, has a 30% market share, and the largest coffee house Starbucks has a market share of 32%. == Profitability == Government subsidy comprises a lion's share of the profits of the largest banks in the United States. Banks understood to be \\"too big to fail\\" take greater risks because they understand that if the risks go seriously wrong the institution is likely to be bailed out by the government. Also for this reason, such large banks borrow at lower interest rates because of the lower perceived risk of institutional failure. The value of the government subsidy to these larger U.S. banks in 2012 was estimated to be up to $70 billion.International Monetary Fund, 31 Mar. 2014, \\"IMF Survey: Big Banks Benefit From Government Subsidies\\" == Political power == In the United States, the financial sector has grown in recent decades and now constitutes a much greater share of the overall economy, as measured, for example, by its percentage of the gross domestic product.Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \\"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown\\", (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 60-61, 63. A leading group of U.S. financial sector firms comprises an oligarchy that has considerable ideological and political influence in the U.S. Congress and in regulatory agencies. This political power has been used to dismantle laws, for example, major portions of the Glass-Steagall Act that prohibited a single entity from engaging in both commercial banking (which entails taking deposits) and investment banking (which raises funds for corporations on stock exchanges through private placement and other avenues), and regulations that govern activities that entail risks to the economy.Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \\"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown\\", (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 133. This political influence in advanced economies like that of the U.S. is as effective in setting legislative and regulatory agendas to achieve greater profitability as bribery and kickbacks are in controlling state action in developing countries.Simon Johnson and James Kwak, \\"13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown\\", (New York: Pantheon Books, 2010), p. 120.

The meeting called for organizing local unions and meetings of intellectuals whose goal was to defend culture from fascism. The idea to organize such a Congress in Poland was the reply to that call. Besides, the Lviv Congress of 1936 was a political event implementing the recommendations of the 7th Comintern World Congress of 1935 on the organization of Popular Fronts. Well-known intellectuals such as Stepan Tudor, Yaroslav Halan, Oleksandr Havryliuk, Leon Kruczkowski, Kuzma Plekhatyi, Halina Górska, Adolf Berman and others took part in preparing the Congress. Lviv, as the venue of the Congress, was not chosen by chance. In the 1930s, the city became the center of Polish, Jewish and Ukrainian intellectuals, as well as the arena of class struggle. Spring of 1936 was a hot period for the working class in Lviv. In April massive clashes between city workers and the police turned into firefights. That time could be called one of the peak moments in the left-wing movement's history in Western Ukraine. The Anti-Fascist Congress became a link of this chain of events, and set the goal to express solidarity between intellectuals and workers. == Event == The event was held in the Tramway Workers' House, also known as the Red Fortress, a cultural club that was built at the expense of workers' donations and constructed by themselves in 1933. During the meeting, the Congress Hall was decorated with a portrait of Maxim Gorky, who along with Romain Rolland and Heinrich Mann were elected to the Honorary Presidium. The Congress was opened by the Polish communist Henryk Dembiński. The writer Wanda Wasilewska read out the Resolution of the Congress of Cultural Workers. Representatives of the striking workers and former political prisoners spoke at the congress. In breaks between sessions, the writers made speeches at the factories. According to witnesses, the workers made up the vast majority of the Congress guests. Among the participants, all main nationalities of the country - Poles, Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Jews - were represented. Some writers from the Ukrainian SSR were invited. During the Congress, the following reports were made: Culture and Fascism (by Henryk Dembinski, Stepan Tudor), War and the Future of Culture (by Leon Kruczkowski), Culture and Conditions of Human Labour (by Halina Krahelska), On the State of Literature, Theatre, Music, Journalism, Education (by Marian Czuchnowski, Yaroslav Halan, Wanda Wasilwska, Bronisław Dabrowski, Emil Zegadłowicz, Aleksander Dan). Speaking on the national question, the participants of the Congress expressed in favour of meeting all the cultural needs of the nationalities inhabiting the Polish state. The speakers demanded the opening of national schools, Ukrainian and Belarusian universities, and the equal rights of languages. Yaroslav Halan spoke particularly hotly about these issues. The Congress debunked the oppressive, pro-fascist policy of the government of the Polish Republic, condemned the oppression of the working masses by the capitalists, bourgeois nationalism, chauvinism, militarism. The resolution, unanimously approved, urged the intelligentsia of Poland, Western Ukraine and Western Belarus to participate in a nationwide struggle against Nazism, to stop the preparation of a war against the USSR, for the free development of science and culture. The Congress ended with singing The Internationale. The tone of the participants was revolutionary, some of them announced an imminent meeting «in a red Lviv». == Consequences == These political accents have caused a scandal. The Association of Railway Bookstores Ruch, which had a monopoly on the distribution of the press, issued a circular forbidding the distribution of communist newspapers - Chłopskie Jutro, Język Międzynarodowy, Kultura Wschodu, Lewar, Lewy Tor, Literatur, Oblicze Dnia and Przekrój Tygodnia - previously available in normal sales. For initiators and organizers of the Congress, it was not safe to stay in the city. Soon afterwards, its participants received a signal: «Leave Lviv». For instance, Yaroslav Halan had to move to Warsaw. Lviv became part of the Soviet Union following the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939. Years later, historians of the Communist Party of Western Ukraine regarded the Congress as a great success for their policies. == Bibliography == * Kongres Kultury Polskiej 1981, red. W.

The budget of the Swedish Air Force received the largest increase in funding, bumping its previous allowance of 11 million crowns to 28 million. A domestic aircraft industry was taking shape during this time, composed of Svenska Aeroplan AB (SAAB) and AB Svenska Järnvägsverkstädernas Aeroplanavdelning. The Navy and Coastal Artillery branches were slightly expanded and modernised. It was decided that certain Army infantry regiments were to be composed of one infantry and one armoured battalion each. At first, the Life Regimental Grenadiers (I 3) as well as the Skaraborg Regiment (I 9) were considered. In November, however, it was agreed that the Södermanland Regiment (I 10) would be reorganised instead of the Life Regimental Grenadiers (I 3). When Göta Life Guards (I 2) was disbanded in 1939, its armoured battalion was split into two battalions which were assigned to the Skaraborg Regiment (I 9) and the Södermanland Regiment (I 10). The Air Force was significantly expanded with six air wings. == Reorganisation == Reorganisation within the Armed Forces until the Defence Act of 1942: * General Staff was disbanded in 1937. * Defence Staff (Fst) was established in 1936. * Army Staff (AS) was established in 1936. * Air Staff (FS) was established in 1936. * The Fortification Branch was split in 1937 into three corps; the Engineer Troops, the Signal Troops and the Swedish Army Fortifications Corps === Army === * The number of Army Divisions was increased from four to six. ** I Army Division was established in Kristianstad. ** II Army Division was established in Östersund. ** III Army Division was established in Skövde. ** IV Army Division was established in Stockholm. ** Gotland Military Area was established in Visby. ** Troops of Upper Norrland were established in Boden. * Göta Life Guards (I 2) was disbanded in 1939. * Fortress Battalion of the Kronoberg Regiment (I 11 K) was disbanded in 1939. === Air Force === * The Air Group, Karlsborg. * The First Air Corps in Västerås is in 1936 reorganised into the Västmanland Air Force Wing (F 1). * The Second Air Corps in Hägernäs is in 1936 reorganised into the Roslagen Air Force Wing (F 2). * The Third Air Corps in Malmslätt is in 1936 reorganised into the Östgöta Air Force Wing (F 3). * The Fourth Air Corps in Östersund is in 1936 reorganised into the Jämtlands Air Force Wing (F 4). * The Flight Academy in Ljungbyhed in 1936 is reorganised into the Swedish Air Force Flying School (F 5). * Västgöta Air Force Wing (F 6) is established in 1939 in Karlsborg. * Skaraborg Air Force Wing (F 7) is established in 1938 in Lidköping. * Svea Air Force Wing (F 8) is established in 1938 in Stockholm. * Göta Air Force Wing (F 9) is established in 1940 i Gothenburg (following a 1940 amendment). * Scania Air Force Wing (F 10) is established in 1940 in Bulltofta (following a 1940 amendment). * Södermanland Air Force Wing (F 11) was established in 1941 in Nyköping (following a 1940 amendment). * Kalmar Air Force Wing (F 12) was established in 1942 in Kalmar (following a 1941 amendment). === Navy === * Gotland Coastal Artillery Corps (KA 3) was established in 1937 in Fårösund. * Älvsborg Coastal Artillery Detachment (KA 4) was established in 1939 in Gothenburg. == References  Further reading == * * * ==External links== * Category:1936 in Sweden Category:1936 in politics Category:Defence Acts of Sweden ","title":"Defence Act of 1936 (Sweden)"},{"id":"56755459","text":"The Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Nusantara or Museum MACAN is an art museum at Kebon Jeruk in Jakarta, Indonesia.

C. Handy's \\"The Memphis Blues\\" by several months. ==Biography== An African- American, Seals was born in Mobile, Alabama, around 1880. He first came to public attention in 1909 as the pianist at the Lyric Theatre in Shreveport, Louisiana. In 1910 his ragtime \\"coon song\\" \\"Shake, Rattle & Roll\\" (unrelated, except in title, to the later song by Jesse Stone) was published by Louis Grunewald & Co. in New Orleans. The same year, he directed and performed in shows in Houston and Galveston, Texas, where he partnered \\"Baby\\" Floyd Fisher, described as a \\"dainty little singing and dancing soubrette\\". Seals and Fisher were married, performed together as a duo, and in 1911 appeared in shows in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia, demonstrating their wide appeal.

The lyrics are similar to those in later recorded blues: \\"I got the blues, can't be satisfied today/ I got them bad, want to lay down and die/ Woke up this morning 'bout half past four/ Somebody knocking at my door/ I went out to see what it was about / They told me that my honey gal was gone/ I said, bub that's bad news/ So sing for me them blues.\\" \\"Baby Seals Blues\\", RagPiano.com.

It rapidly entered the repertoire of other vaudeville performers, including both Jelly Roll Morton and the yodeler Charles Anderson, who recorded the tune in 1923 as \\"Sing 'Em Blues\\". By late 1912, the tune had also been arranged for performance by bands, and by 1913 Seals was being noted as a \\"famous blues writer\\".

In comparison to the Qing porcelain the Ming porcelain was slightly dull because they did not use the same techniques as the Qing. The Qing were putting their porcelain in a higher temperature in order to creature a glossier finish. This was another selling factor to have variety of colors as well as having a glossier finish. Porcelain trade in Qing China was an important trade during the late Ming dynasty and throughout the Qing dynasty. The porcelain that was traded reflected a transition of creative influences that altered the way porcelain looked but its high demand in Europe. == Economy Trade == In the late of Ming dynasty there were many kilns created that led the Ming dynasty to be economically well off. The late emperors of the Ming dynasty like Jiajing and Wanli made sure there were more kilns created in Jingdezhen. There was also a further research and study on the type of materials and techniques in the creation for porcelain during Qing china. Since there was a high demand the Ming realized that there needed a proper allocation of funds and management to create a steady porcelain supply. Thus, these additional kilns and management would help the production of porcelain as well as the economical growth of the early Qing dynasty period. However, once the Ming Dynasty came to an end there was a suffering that occurred during the Qing dynasty when Jingdezhen became a prime location for political turmoil and military campaigns during the Taiping Rebellion. These invasions caused a temporary stalling in the creation for porcelain. Once the Qing dynasty sought to bring back porcelain in the trade they developed a more efficient way to transport the Porcelain goods. The Qing emperors like Kangxi helped to initiate a furthering of maritime trade which would help the growth of porcelain trade. By using the Yangtze River not only was porcelain materials cheaper to send but the final good could be transported to other regions that were not accessible. Kangxi furthered the trade for porcelain by allowing an organization of private maritime trade that allowed families who own private kilns. Once again the porcelain trade was thriving, and helped to boost the economy of the early Qing empire. == Qing Culture of Porcelain == There is a difference in the way the Qing porcelain was created and why it was thriving in the trading atmosphere. The Ming, prior to the overthrowing by the Qing, were using two color glazes for their porcelain. The two color porcelain was something that many connoisseurs from Europe sought after, but at one point were done buying. Once the Qing came into power and began to change the artistic aspect of the porcelain there were experiments and techniques to use five colors. Furthermore, the Qing focused on different artistic elements when producing their porcelain, like the use of color and putting porcelain at a higher temperature to get a glossier coat. Also, many of the private kilns were trusting their own potters to create freely, a creative freedom that would help to further the creative porcelain pieces. A more creative porcelain piece would bring more profit and boost to the Qing economy. There was a researching of what techniques were better in the production of these porcelain goods, and this would help to further the marketing aspect of business in Jingdezhen (the porcelain capital of China). The various use of kilns and the changes of temperature helped to produce a brilliance and assortment of porcelain that helped to thrive a part of the Qing economy. Emperor Kangxi's decisive decision to rebuild the kilns after the rebellion would help to provide an economic benefit to the Qing economy. The furthering of the color techniques would go long into the Kangxi emperor's time and would further showcase the Qing culture through the artistic prints and designs on the porcelain. This same coloring and technique process is still used in today's porcelain from the Qing time period because there has been no substitute to create the same color and appearance on porcelain. == Comparing Ming and Qing Porcelain == 283x283px This is a Qing plate and as seen above has a variety of colors and the hue of the white is much brighter than off the Ming dynasty plate. Also there is a glossier look because the Qing were using kilns at such a high temperature that it would help to not only create a glossy finish but the colors and whites would be more bright. ==See also== * Chinese ceramics * Chinese export porcelain ==References== Category:Qing dynasty art Category:Ming dynasty art Category:Chinese porcelain Category:Economic history of China Category:Industrial history of China ","title":"Porcelain trade in Qing China"},{"id":"56755557","text":"Charitodoronidae, known as mitre shells, are a taxonomic family of sea snails, widely distributed marine gastropod molluscs in the clade Mitroidea.MolluscaBase (2018).

It is on the left (south) bank of the Murray River about 7 km downstream from Loxton. It includes both flat land near the river and higher land away from it. The environment is dry, so vineyards and orchards are irrigated from the river. It lies on the Kingston Road from Loxton, at the junction with the Stott Highway towards Swan Reach. Pyap was first settled as a Village Settlement in March 1894 with 94 members and 187 children on 9,145 acres (3,700 ha) and a total population of 388. The founding chairman was A. H. Brocklehurst and the secretary J. W. Rawnsley. In about 1900 the government became tired of trying to keep the settlement going and when most of the village settlers abandoned the settlement, sold out lock, stock and barrel to a Mildura-Melbourne syndicate who appointed Mr. William Mitchell Plant as general manager. This firm continued to run the settlement with some success until 1913 when it eventually landed with C. J. DeGaris.

He founded and leads a Christian non-denominational evangelical church known as the Enlightened Christian Gathering. The church has headquarters in Pretoria, South Africa with branches in other African countries and around the world. Tens of thousands of people are attracted to the church every day. He describes the church as a Prophetic Ministry based on the principle that \\"God cares and loves people and wants to speak directly to them.\\" Bushiri also runs a global investment company, Shepherd Bushiri Investments, based in Sandton near Johannesburg, with interests in mining, real estate, an airline and other entrepreneurial enterprises. According to Bushiri, he ventured into business to support his family as he does not believe the church must support his family. ==History== Shepherd Bushiri grew up in Mzuzu, which is in the northern part of Malawi. His mother gave him the name Shepherd due to the complexities around his birth, acknowledging the Lord as her Shepherd. He travels around the world holding crusades and meetings focused on teaching, prophesy and healing. In August 2018, he was invited as a guest of honor at South Africa's National Day of Inter-faith prayer held at the Emirates Airline Stadium in Johannesburg, during which he offered prayers of reconciliation and unity. The event was attended by South African leading clergy and South Africa's Vice President David Mabuza. === Given name controversy === Claims that Bushiri was born Chipiliro Gama in The Citizen in February 2019; \\"an invoice mistakenly sent to Baloyi Attorneys did not use the popular name Shepherd Bushiri, and instead called him Chipiliro Gama.\\" A report in The Sunday Times newspaper for February 2019 stated that \\"Bushiri's father, Huxley, and mother, Cristina, a Zambian by birth raised him as Chipiliro Gama\\". In September 2019, Bushiri's spokesperson and communications director, Ephraim Nyondo, refuted the allegations. == Career == Shepherd Bushiri is now known as one of the wealthiest pastors in the world and one of the most affluent people in Africa. Bushiri is mentored by multimillionaire businessman and leader of Good News Church in UK, Prophet Uebert Angel. Bushiri is said to be the most celebrated and popular Spiritual Son of Prophet Angel. Angel has other Spiritual sons including, but not limited to, Africa- based Romeo Marom, Bulgaria-based miracle worker Maksim Asenov, leader of Imperial City Church, Isaiah Brian Sovi and South Africa-based Apostle Miz Tancred. ===Christian Gathering === The Enlightened Christian Gathering is reported as one of the fastest growing churches in Africa and the world. Bushiri is the founder of the Enlightened Christian Gathering (ECG). He has established and leads churches in South Africa, Malawi, Ghana, South Sudan and other countries. He has been interviewed for television by the BBC, and received coverage also in Al Jazeera, New African, Nigerian Tribune, and African Leadership magazine. On the night of 28 December 2018, three people died and nine others were injured during a stampede at the ECG Church caused by people trying to avoid a thunderstorm. Bushiri's spokesman Maynard Manyowa told media that \\"The ECG Church is not his [Bushiri's] church, it belongs to South Africa and South Africans.\\" Manyowa also said that the deaths were \\"not his [Bushiri's] problem, but a problem that the church must deal with.\\" Bushiri's services attract over viewers via his personally owned television station, social media and in-person attendees. His largest gatherings are held on New Year's Eve at FNB Stadium, South Africa with over attendees both in 2016 and 2017. The FNB Stadium is the largest stadium in Africa. His church gatherings have not always been well received with the one extreme protest being the destruction of \\"overflow tents\\" by arson in February 2020. === SB Investments === Shepherd Bushiri's company, SB Investments (Pty) Ltd, is an international investment company, based in Sandton near Johannesburg, with interests in oil, mining, real estate, transportation and the hospitality industry. On 20 February 2018, Bushiri launched one of his hotel investments, a multimillion-dollar property in South Africa. SBI has a special interest in supporting governments including economies of fragile state countries. In 2017 Bushiri was hosted by the Vice President of South Sudan – Dr James Igga, Reserve Bank Governor and Finance Minister during which a business deal was signed in the area of infrastructure and development. In 2018 Shepherd Bushiri was given the prestigious award and induction into the CEO Hall of Fame by the African Leadership Magazine. === Charity Work === Shepherd Bushiri has been involved in many charitable works around the world, including work in Malawi, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Botswana and South Africa. He formed a humanitarian organization called “Shepherd Bushiri Foundation” with Duncan Zgambo as the CEO, where he provides for the needy and less privileged. He provides charitable donations including livelihood support; educational support for orphans; humanitarian relief in the form of food subsidies. In 2017, he took maize to Lilongwe and spent K85 Million in Malawi Charity. He has invested in young people through his sports academy and through Major 1 Records which sponsors and show-cases up-and-coming music artists. On 18 July 2018, Nelson Mandela Day, Bushiri launched an Africa-wide school adoption program with donations to a local school. The event was attended by Senior Government Officials from the South Africa Ministry of Education.. In March 2019 Bushiri visited Alexandra, where a fire had burnt over 100 shacks. He said that he would donate R (equivalent to approx $) to emergency services \\"that should be used for the children in the area.\\". === Other === On 11 February 2020 it was reported by the Nyasa Times and Malawi24 that Bushiri announced that he would be selling maize in Malawi at a price of MK5 000 (US$6.85) per 50 kg (110 lbs), or US$124.55 per ton. The international price for corn futures (yellow maize) at the time of the announcement was US$150 per ton or US$7.50 per 50 kg. The local prices for maize sold commercially in Malawi were 3 to 4 times higher than that quoted by Bushiri, selling for as much as MK20 000 per 50 kg According to various reports thousands of people bought the cheap maize at various sites within Malawi. == Controversies  HIV/AIDS === Bushiri has been accused of making unproven claims of \\"curing HIV.\\" He countered that he has never performed a miracle in his life because only Jesus can. Nevertheless, due to claims of unproven miracles, Botswana temporarily banned him from entering the country before courts ruled the ECG church is allowed to continue operating in the country. Initially he was free to enter the country at will but now is required to apply for a visa every time he wants to enter Botswana. === Fees for public dinners === The fees charged to attend some of Bushiri's public dinners have been questioned. It was reported that he charged up to R for a seat at his table at a gala dinner held on 23 December 2017 at the Pretoria Showground, and N$ for entry to a dinner held in Windhoek, Namibia in January 2016. Bushiri in several news interviews categorically refuted the published extreme pricing claims for \\"so-called gala dinners\\" calling them \\"fabricated.\\" === Investment schemes === Allegedly, during a church service in March 2017, Bushiri announced that he wanted to make members of his church into millionaires. Congregants were then told via email to invest at least R100 000 in cash with him within the next two days and were promised a 50% return within 30 banking days. Those that could not bring cash with them to the church were sent banking details of a company, Rising Estates, the directors of which are Bushiri lieutenants, Willah Mudolo, Duncan Oduor Otieno and Kit Ching Catherine Kum. Almost two years later, the people who gave Bushiri money claim to have not received anything back. The investment scheme appears to be linked to Palambano Investments as six congregants from Bushiri's church claim they were told that the money they donated would be invested in Zambia in \\"gold minerals\\" as part of a Palamabo investment scheme. The congregants provided proof that the money had been paid into the ECG's First National Bank account. East London, Eastern Cape, police spokesperson Capt Mluleki Mbi confirmed that a case had been opened against Palambano Investments and its directors in response to a complaint by Nombeko Dwesini, one of Bushiri's congregants. === Paternity === It is alleged that in 2010 Bushiri impregnated a teenage Malawian woman, whom he met in 2007 in their home town, Mzimba. It is further claimed that he bribed her with a cheque for Malawian kwacha (about R) to have an abortion but that the cheque bounced. The woman subsequently gave birth in 2011 to a girl who \\"is the spitting image of Bushiri and it is widely known in the district that he is the biological father,” according to the father of the woman. The woman is now married and the family alleges that they \\"kept quiet out of fear.\\" The village that the woman and child live in broke the news before the family approached Bushiri. Bushiri claims that the cheque was stolen from him and that, on the day the woman claims he made her pregnant, Bushiri was at a police station dealing with an attempted hijacking. In 2018, the mother again tried to get maintenance via the courts but was unsuccessful. Family members of the girl claim that Bushiri admits to the allegations in private, despite his public denials and have demanded a paternity test. His lawyer, Terrence Baloyi, did not respond to emails, text messages and calls from City Press seeking comment. === Non-payment for clothing === Darlington Manyawu, a businessman based in Hong Kong, claims to have sold Bushiri clothing to the value of R but had not received payment for them. He claims that the clothing was given to Bushiri's spokesman, Maynard Manyowa on 28 June 2019 and Bushiri has subsequently been seen wearing the clothes at public church gatherings. Ephraim Nyondo, the spokesman for the Elightened Christian Gathering church, did not dispute the claim but stated that the matter did not concern Bushiri as it was between Manyawu and Manyowa. === Radio Veritas === The South African Catholic radio station, Radio Veritas, was reprimanded by the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa (BCCSA) for airing a one-sided programme laced with allegations against Bushiri on 1 December 2019. Bushiri had claimed that the broadcast was \\"malicious, damaging to his reputation, libelous, contained lies, was unfounded\\" and did not afford him the right of reply. The BCCSA noted that Veritaas Radio had contravened the broadcasting act in not presenting the opposing view from Bushiri. === Infidelity === On 20 February 2020 former deputy finance minister of Zimbabwe, Terence Mukupe, accused Bushiri of an adulterous affair with Mukupe's musician wife, Rachel, which resulted in the impregnation of Rachel. He claimed to have WhatsApp evidence of his wife and the preacher arranging to meet for \\"sex romps in Malawi, Pretoria and Rustenburg\\". He also claimed that Bushiri had taken R (approx $) from him to finance his church, Enlightened Christian Gathering. Bushiri responded to the allegations, saying that he had not left South Africa in the past 13 months and therefore could not have met with Rachel Mukupe. He also claimed that he had not used WhatsApp or iMessage for the past 3 years and hence could not have sent her the messages Terence Mukupe claimed to have found. Bushiri also said that he had engaged his lawyers in Zimbabwe to \\"urgently seek legal recourse.\\" Mukupe's response to Bushiri was that Bushiri had not used his own phone to contact Rachel and that Mukupe had paid for the tickets for Bushiri to travel. According to reports, \\"Mukupe's public spat with Bushiri has divided opinion among ZANU PF members over his psychological fitness to head the ZanuPF youth league.\\" On 3 March Rachel (known as Rachel J) responded to the allegations between Bushiri and Mukupe. In her statement, released via her family, it was stated that: # She was not married to Terence Mukupe although the man did live in her home and she had had children with him. # She looked after him and his 10 children. # Rachel had terminated their relationship because she had discovered that Terence Mukupe had once again impregnated Tracy Winterboer, the second child sired with the same woman during Rachel's relationship with Mukupe. # The claims of her impregnation by Bushiri are unbelievable since Mukupe's evidence shows that they met in 2018. \\"How is it possible for her to carry a pregnancy for two years?\\" they asked. On 4 March Rachel J's family demanded a paternity test be performed on the child to prove that he was not Bushiri's. On 6 March Rachel gave birth to a daughter she referred to as \\"Najah, Deborah, Makomborero.\\" No paternity tests had been conducted at that point. == Arrest == On 1 February 2019, Bushiri was arrested together with his wife by South Africa's Directorate for Priority Investigations (HAWKS) for fraud and money laundering. The Hawks said the case against the couple was linked to alleged offences of fraud and money laundering, as well as the contravention of South Africa's Prevention of Organised Crime Act (POCA), which had been committed from 2015. The contravention of the Act was in relation to Exchange Control Regulations relating to foreign currency of $. Bushiri and his wife were each granted R (approx $) bail after appearing in the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Pretoria on 6 February 2019. Among the bail conditions were that the couple remain in Gauteng and their travel documents remain with the state. If they needed to travel, they would need to get written permission from investigating officers. Bushiri and wife were also not allowed to make contact with any of the witnesses. On 28 August 2019 Bushiri's court case was postponed until 29 November 2019 to allow his legal team, including Terrence Baloyi and Barry Roux, to make representations to the National Prosecuting Authority. The case was subsequently postponed to 27 July 2020 for trial, at which time it was postponed to October 2020. In November 2019 application was made by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) for the forfeiture of a 1984 Gulfstream aircraft owned by Bushiri and hangared at Lanseria airport, north of Johannesburg. The NPA claimed that the aircraft had been procured with funds illegally obtained. Bushiri claimed that it was legitimately acquired in 2016 for $ (R). The application for forfeiture was not ready to go ahead and was removed from the court roll. == Personal life == Shepherd Bushiri enjoys football and chess. He is married to Mary Bushiri, an accountant who previously held a senior managerial position for an international development NGO, who now does business ventures and Christian ministry. The Bushiris have two daughters. ==References *Official Biography of Prophet Shepherd Bushiri *\\"Major One\\", Shepherd Bushiri Ministries *Prophet Shepherd Bushiri website *Enlightened Christian Gathering website Category:Living people Category:Malawian clergy Category:1983 births ","title":"Shepherd Bushiri"},{"id":"56755646","text":"María José Martínez Sánchez and Anabel Medina Garrigues were the defending champions, but none competed this year.

The tomb fresco in the church of Santa Maria Maddalena of Faenza. Born into a noble family in Milan, he studied law, philosophy and theology at the University of Pavia. After a short stay in Mantua, he decided to enter the Knights Hospitaller in 1505 aged only twenty- five. He later became their deputy procurator general. He was stationed on Rhodes until 1508, when he moved to Rome, where he cultivated a love of art and literature. He then decided to leave Rome's corruption and worldliness and between 1515 and 1519 set up home in Faenza, where he became commendatory abbot of the church of Santa Maria Maddalena on Borgo Durbecco - the church is thus still nicknamed the \\"Chiesa della Commenda\\" after him. He devoted himself to study, charity and patronage of the arts. He collected books, sculptures and artworks, founded a free public school for poor children and opened a pilgrims' hospice. In 1525 he promised to finance the restoration of the church's monastic buildings as a base for the Knights. In 1533 he commissioned Girolamo da Treviso to decorate the church's main apse with a fresco of The Madonna Enthroned between Saints Mary Magdalene and Catherine of Alexandria. In 1554 he also commissioned a monochrome fresco from Francesco Menzocchi, an artist from Forlì - it showed St Joseph presenting Castiglione himself, now an old man, to the Virgin Mary. He also had his tomb sited under Menzocchi's fresco and wrote the Latin epitaph for the tomb. ==Writings== *Il lamento pietoso del disgraziato Glonico pastore d'amore e di Delia crudele da lui sommamente amata, Venice, 1528. *Consolatoria, Bologna, 1529. *Ricordi, Venice, 1554 - 25 editions before 1613 ==Sources== * * ==External links== * Giulio Reichenbach, «CASTIGLIONE, Sabba da», in Enciclopedia Italiana, Roma, Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana, I Appendice, 1938.

Miller was born in 1928 in Pankshin, Plateau State. He was the last son in a family of five girls and three boys. Miller's upbringing exposed him to music at an early age. He developed interest in music when his father was posted to the Holy Trinity Church in Lokoja, for the first time in his life, he saw various musical instruments within the church and its adjoining school, instruments that were purchased or handed down by the colonial militia. Miller took interest in playing the church's musical instruments, at age nine, he was in the school's band and also sang during church services. ===Career=== He attended CMS Grammar School, Lagos where he was active in the school's band. While in school, he joined a Calabar Brass Band that played at street corners and in weddings. After graduation, he studied marketing and also played as a part-time member of Samuel Akpabot's band. He worked for Lever Brothers in Lagos and in the evenings played the trumpet or the cornet with Akpabots' band. When Akpabot traveled abroad, Miller formed a band with an hotelier, Laremi Cole called the West End Club after Cole's West End Hotel. However, working for Lever Brothers entailed that Miller traveled a lot, so when he was posted outside of Lagos, Miller introduced Victor Olaiya, a trumpeter and band leader in one of Bobby Benson's bands to join West End Club as band leader. They had a hit with the highlife song, Oni dodo, oni moi moi. Chris Ajilo, a band leader in England and his friend Sammy Lartey also joined the team. They played regularly at the hotel mostly for kicks, however the band was struggling financially. But when Benson later approached Ajilo and another bandmate, Samuel Lartey to form a new band, their exit caused disruption in the band and Miller had to regroup. Luckily, Miller wrote his first major hit Kusimilaya, the song's popularity coincided with the visit of Queen Elizabeth to Nigeria and Miller's song was performed during the queen's visit. He later composed Kusimilaya 2, teaming with Fela Sowande and Steve Rhodes for the arrangement. In 1956, he joined Nigerian Breweries and was posted to Kaduna, with Victor Olaiya, the leading band member, the band later became known as Victor Olaiya and the Cool Cats. While in Northern Nigeria, Miller visited a hotel that had three bands playing, one of the bands was called Universal Band, he became a mentor to the band's members. The band later changed their name to Sahara All-Stars, after a visit to the Lagos music scene. Miller worked for different corporations, in 1966, he worked for the Nigeria Port Authority in Lagos, there he formed the company's band, Harbours Dance Band. The new band regularly played at Island Club. In 1973, he organized the establishment of a music school in Kano. The governor of Kano, Audu Bako was a friend of Miller and had asked Miller for input in solving juvenile delinquency within the state, Miller suggested a musical school to train young adults how to play instruments. When the school opened in 1973, Miller was appointed its first director. In 1977, Miller was involved in the development of the music programme at FESTAC 77, during the festival's preparations, he was inspired to form a new band. In March 1977, after placing ads for players, he formed Bala Miller and the Music Pyrameeds of Africa. Originally a twelve piece band that later grew to become a 28 piece big band. The band was innovative for his use of hausa lyrics in highlife composition. In 1985, Miller had a variety show on NTA Network. ==References== Category:Nigerian musicians Category:1928 births Category:2003 deaths ","title":"Bala Miller"},{"id":"56755888","text":"Who Could Ask for Anything More?

Frank Pugliese and Melissa James Gibson returned as showrunners for the final season. The sixth season continues the story of recently-inaugurated, Democratic president Claire Underwood (Robin Wright), who faces new threats within and outside the White House following the death of her husband and former president Frank Underwood. Powerful elites, led by wealthy siblings Annette and Bill Shepherd (Diane Lane and Greg Kinnear), are attempting to manipulate and destroy her presidency, while Claire struggles to exert influence and escape her husband's shadow. The sixth season marks the first of the series without Kevin Spacey, who portrayed lead character Frank Underwood. Soon after production began in October 2017, Netflix fired the actor as a result of sexual misconduct allegations made against him. Production was halted for several months while the screenplay was reworked to exclude Spacey's character. As a result, the season was reduced to eight episodes, deviating from the 13-episode format of the previous seasons. ==ProductionUnannounced start and sudden shutdown=== Kevin Spacey was removed after sexual misconduct allegations were made against him. On October 11, 2017, The Baltimore Sun reported that House of Cards had been renewed for a sixth season and that filming would begin by the end of October 2017. On October 18, 2017, production of the sixth season of House of Cards appeared to be already in progress, without an official renewal announcement by Netflix, when a gunman opened fire near a House of Cards set outside Baltimore. Production company Media Rights Capital and Netflix stated that production on the show was not affected by the shooting. Production on the series was shut down on October 30, 2017, following sexual assault allegations towards Kevin Spacey by actor Anthony Rapp, who publicly stated that Spacey had made a sexual advance on him in 1986, when Rapp was 14 years old. Netflix announced its decision to cancel the series after the upcoming season, although multiple sources stated that the decision to end the series had been made prior to Rapp's accusation. The following day, Netflix and MRC announced that production on the season would be suspended indefinitely, in order to review the current situation and to address any concerns of the cast and crew. Robin Wright strongly opposed Netflix executives who wanted to cancel the season, as she was concerned about the 2,500 people who had been involved in the production at that time and were at risk of losing their jobs. On November 3, 2017, Netflix announced that they would no longer be associated with Spacey in any capacity whatsoever. ===Restarting production=== On December 4, 2017, Ted Sarandos, Netflix's chief content officer, announced that production would restart in 2018 with Wright in the lead, without Spacey's involvement, and revealed that the sixth and final season of the show would consist of eight episodes. House of Cards resumed production on January 31, and wrapped filming four months later, on May 25, 2018. The firing of Kevin Spacey significantly affected the production process, as showrunners Frank Pugliese and Melissa Gibson had to rethink the show and come up with a conclusion for the series in a limited amount of time, taking into consideration other contractual obligations of the cast and crew. In an interview with IndieWire, Pugliese and Gibson revealed that these changes did not represent a huge shift for many of the characters; it was the overall story that was mostly affected, which was initially intended to center on a struggle between Frank and Claire to own the White House. The showrunners also revealed that—even in his absence—Frank continues to have a big impact on the story, and noted that erasing him completely would have seemed disingenuous. In the wake of Spacey's firing, Wright leads the sixth season of House of Cards, with her character, Claire Underwood, having assumed the presidency at the end of the previous season. A number of returning cast members reprised their roles from previous seasons, while Alik Sakharov, who had helmed three episodes in season five, directed for the final season as well. New additions to the cast included Diane Lane and Greg Kinnear, who played Annette and Bill Shepherd, the sister-brother inheritors of an industrial conglomerate; said characters were inspired by the Koch brothers, as members of a family with the power to influence American politics. Joining them, Australian actor Cody Fern plays Annette's ambitious son Duncan Shepherd. Lane had been cast to play Claire's longtime friend prior to the firing of Spacey, with whom she had shot a number of scenes. However, as she told IndieWire, the writers \\"managed to find the same trajectory for [her] character in terms of what she means to Claire.\\" ==Cast and charactersMain=== * Robin Wright as President Claire (Hale) Underwood * Michael Kelly as Douglas \\"Doug\\" Stamper * Diane Lane as Annette Shepherd * Campbell Scott as Vice President Mark Usher * Derek Cecil as Seth Grayson * Cody Fern as Duncan Shepherd * Athena Karkanis as Melody Cruz * Jeremy Holm as FBI Assistant Director Nathan Green * Greg Kinnear as Bill Shepherd * Boris McGiver as Tom Hammerschmidt * Constance Zimmer as Janine Skorsky * Kristen Sieh as Press Secretary Kelsey Stewart * Patricia Clarkson as Jane Davis * Jayne Atkinson as Catherine \\"Cathy\\" Durant ===Recurring=== * Boris Kodjoe as Congressman, later Speaker of the House Brett Cole * Linda Marie Larson as Jennifer Baumgarten * Linda Powell as Secretary of State Marcy Siegerson * Chip Zien as Dr. Charles Rosen * Brian Keane as Ray Meyers * Susan Pourfar as Secretary of Homeland Security Nora Cafferty * Ron Canada as Judge Vincent Abruzzo * Lars Mikkelsen as President Viktor Petrov * Gregg Edelman as Stan Durant ===Guest=== * Chris Agos as USSS Special Agent Rick Bowman * Robert Newman as EPA Administrator * Joy Lynn Jacobs as U.S. Attorney * Lee Sellars as Governor of Ohio Roger Olmstead * Aaron Serotsky as Russell * Darwin Shaw as Rafiq Nasser * Sakina Jaffrey as Linda Vasquez * John Ellison Conlee as a hunter * Thomas Kopache as Earl Hanna * Marc Kudisch as Henry Mitchell * Willa Fitzgerald as 20-year-old Claire * Ali Collier as teenager Claire * David Corenswet as Reed * Kenneth Tigar as Walter Doyle ==EpisodesMarketing== season five were used to promote the final season, as the actress takes over lead duties following Spacey's firing. From March to October 2018, Netflix released various promotional material for the sixth and final season of House of Cards. On March 4, the first teaser premiered during the 90th Academy Awards ceremony. The teaser shows Robin Wright in the Oval Office as President Claire Underwood, declaring \\"We're just getting started,\\" followed by an intertitle reading \\"Hail to the Chief\\". On June 10, Netflix released two first-look images from the final season. The first photo shows Wright listening to director Alik Sakharov, and the second shows her looking straight at the camera. On July 4, the 242nd anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, a video message was posted on House of Cards official Twitter account, with President Claire Underwood saying, \\"Happy Independence Day... to me.\\" The message is followed by the hashtag #MyTurn. On August 7, Netflix announced that the season would be released on November 2, 2018, and unveiled key art. The poster pays homage to the promotional image for the first season of the series, as Wright strikes the Lincoln Memorial pose, like Kevin Spacey had done before her. On August 27, four images were published via a press release, which depict new cast members Diane Lane, Greg Kinnear and Cody Fern in their roles as members of the Shepherd family. A teaser trailer released on September 5, revealed the fate of Frank Underwood, portrayed by Spacey who was fired from the show, months after the conclusion of the fifth season. It is shown that Frank died in 2017, and has been buried next to his father in South Carolina. Claire visits her husband's grave and says, \\"I'll tell you this though, Francis. When they bury me, it won't be in my backyard. And when they pay their respects, they'll have to wait in line.\\" This speech mirrors the one Frank gives in the third season of the series, when he visits his father's grave. On September 27, Netflix released a new teaser trailer that presents several new and returning characters. Claire is shown dealing with the aftermath of her husband's death, and declaring that \\"the reign of the middle-aged white man is over.\\" On October 8, Netflix released the official trailer for the season, which revolves around Claire's power struggle, as she clashes with the American oligarchs and tries to forge her own path as President of the United States. On October 23, critics began publishing reviews on the season, based on advance copies of the first five episodes that they had received from Netflix, after they had signed a letter of agreement. ==ReceptionCritical response=== Prior to the official release date of the season, Netflix sent the first five episodes to a number of critics, to serve as advance screeners. On Rotten Tomatoes, the season has an approval rating of 69% based on 64 reviews, with an average rating of 6.11/10. The consensus reads, \\"House of Cards folds slightly under the weight of its labyrinthian ending – thankfully Robin Wright's commanding performance is strong enough to keep it standing strong.\\" On Metacritic, the season has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Kevin Lever of FilmEra wrote that \\"with Wright at the forefront of the show now, House of Cards shines as it did in its early years.\\" Lever described the production as \\"stellar\\" and the writing as \\"reinvigorated\\". He noted that the show still has the feel of previous years, but it works best when it focuses on Claire, instead of dealing with holdover pieces. David Zurawik of The Baltimore Sun wrote, \\"I love TV drama that speaks to the cultural moment the way this series does. And, as I have said over and over, #MeToo is a landmark moment.\\" Zurawik revealed that the season primarily focuses on gender issues; \\"the evil of patriarchy and the stench of misogyny\\". He stated that the episodes exceeded his expectations, and praised the performances of Wright, Lane and Kinnear. Christopher Hooton of The Independent described the episodes as \\"slightly banal\\". He expressed his disappointment at the new characters that were introduced this season, and commented that \\"Frank Underwood has left behind not only a power vacuum but an entertainment one.\\" Hooton noted that ever since Frank became president at the end of season two, the series has drifted directionless, and after watching the first five episodes of the final season, it still remains unclear what the show is actually about. Negative reviews include one by Tyler Coates of Esquire, who writes: \\"Kevin Spacey's absence haunts the final season of House of Cards. Just as the show wouldn't work without Claire Underwood, it doesn't exactly work without Frank.\\" Another by Sonia Saraiya of Vanity Fair writes: \\"House of Cards collapses – finally. Down a star and out of things to say, Season 6 flounders.\\" Jack Seale of The Guardian rated the season 2 stars out of 5 stating, \\"We still need to talk about Kevin. It's impossible not to miss Spacey's presence as Robin Wright struggles to make her mark and save Netflix's first big show.\\" The series finale in particular was met with largely negative reviews. Scott Von Doviak of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"C−\\", praising Wright's direction but criticizing the writing and the characterization of Claire during the final season. Kyle Fowle of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a \\"D\\" rating, saying the ultimate flaw of the season and the finale was the large focus on Frank and Frank's legacy. Emily VanDerWerff of Vox gave the finale a one-and-a-half star rating out of five, saying the season \\"saved the worst for last\\". ===Accolades=== For the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards, Robin Wright and Michael Kelly received nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series and Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, respectively. ==ReferencesCategory:2018 American television seasons Category:House of Cards (American TV series) seasons ","title":"House of Cards (season 6)"},{"id":"56755932","text":"Major John White was a native Irish soldier in the American Revolutionary War.

He was one of the first people to join the Guardia Civica formed in the province. During the First Italian War of Independence he took part in the first battle of Governolo. After the battle of Novara he joined Giuseppe Garibaldi in his defence of the Roman Republic and was seriously injured during the clashes at the Villa Doria Pamphilj. Following the Austrian Empire's amnesty in October 1849, Frattini returned to Mantua and quickly joined the Mantuan Insurrectional Committee, hiding its secret press in his home and bringing supporters of unification to Mantua from other cities in Italy Luigi Martini, Il confortatorio di Mantova negli anni 1851, 52, 53 e 55, Mantova, 1867.

His father, Warren, was an anthropologist and academic who founded the anthropology department at the University of Nevada, Reno. During his lifetime, Warren was acknowledged as a pioneer of the study of African art, particularly with his groundbreaking book, The Traditional Artist in African Societies (Indiana University Press, 1974). His mother, Kathleen, is a retired anthropologist whose scholarship focuses primarily on child psychology. When he was six years old, d'Azevedo traveled with his parents and sister to Liberia to live among the Gola people as his father conducted fieldwork for his dissertation.d'Azevedo, Erik, \\"'Vanya Da Dua' Glimpses of a Lost World; An American Boy in the Liberian Bush\\", CreateSpace, 2012. This experience, in addition to his father's ethnographic work on Native American Washoe culture of the Great Basin, had a profound impact on the development of Erik's worldview.Whittaker, Richard, \\"Culture Shock\\", Works & Conversations no. 9, October 2004 == Education == D'Azevedo initially attended the University of Nevada, Reno majoring in social sciences, although during this time he took a few art courses, notably with sculptor John McCracken, who encouraged him to leave Nevada for an art center like New York, Los Angeles, or San Francisco. While in Reno in the mid 1960s, he worked as a field crew member for archeological surveys in eastern Nevada.Fowler, Don D, \\"Archeological Survey in Eastern Nevada, 1966\\", Desert Research Institute, University of Nevada 1968. Following McCracken's advise, he returned to the Bay Area and went on to receive a Bachelor of Fine Art degree from the California College of Arts and Craft (now California College of the Arts) in 1974, and remained at the school for graduate studies, receiving a Master of Fine Art degree in 1976. At CCAC, he studied with leading Bay Area artists such as Franklin Williams, Judith Linhares, Roy De Forest, Arthur Okamura and Jay DeFeo, whose emphasis on resisting \\"the hierarchy of material,\\" resonated with him. He studied privately with DeFeo after leaving CCAC. == Artistic style and career == Early on in his career, d'Azevedo sought to break with the conventions of abstract painting in Western art by focusing on \\"process painting,\\" which encourages mindfulness and experimentation in place of traditional formalism. This approach allows for elements to develop organically, and has led to what he describes as \\"purposeful chaos\\", which references the theory established by art critic Morse Peckham in his 1965 book Man's Rage for Chaos. Peckham writes in opposition to the commonly held notion that artists seek to create structure. Expanding this idea, d'Azevedo believes that \\"chaos\\" is a direct reaction to the \\"rigidity and structure\\" of art history and its discourse. Reflecting on his own work in a 2004 interview, he notes that although his abstract painting might seem like visual chaos, it is in fact created with a sense of order. Experimentation is central to his work, leading him to use of a variety of media. His works range from paintings and sculptures that incorporate found objects to oil and acrylic paintings on canvas. Working with an emphasis on the spontaneity of \\"process,\\" he eventually arrived at a painting technique that resembles printmaking, as he first paints an image on polyurethane then transfers it in reverse to a stretched canvas. D'Azevedo refers to this technique as \\"blind painting\\" or an \\"indirect\\" method.Bruce, Chris & Shields, Kathleen, Withinsight: Visual Territories,\\" Western States Arts Federation, 1994. When asked about the possible influence of African art and visual culture on his work as a result of his early exposure to it as a child, he has said \\"If that influence is there, it comes out completely unconsciously\\". D'Azevedo has lived and worked in the East Bay for decades, maintaining studios in Emeryville, Berkeley, and Oakland from the mid 1970s until the early 2000s. He has exhibited in museums, galleries, and alternative art spaces since 1972, while he was still a student at the University of Nevada, Reno. === Notable Exhibitions === *University of Nevada, Reno, Sheppard Gallery, 1972 (Solo show) *Center Gallery, Reno, Nevada, 1972 (Group show) *Center Gallery, Reno, Nevada, 1973 (Solo show) *University of Nevada, Reno, Sheppard Gallery, 1973 (Group show) *\\"Surface and Image\\", Walnut Creek Civic Arts Center, 1976, curated by Phil Linhares *\\"Exhibition 86\\", Berkeley Art Center, 1986, juried by Peter Selz and Stephen Wirtz *\\"Small Works\\", California Museum of Art, Santa Rosa (1996) *\\"Far Out\\", University of Nevada, Reno, Department of Art (2012) === Public Collections === *University of Nevada, Reno Department of Arthttp://knowledgecenter.unr.edu/digital_collections/exhibits/far_out/azevedo.aspx, \\"Far Out: The University Art Scene, 1960-1975\\", Mathewson-IGT Knowledge Canter, Retrieved March 5,2018http://knowledgecenter.unr.edu/digital_collections/exhibits/far_out/images/dazevedo/dazevedo2.jpg *Oakland Museum of California *Farhat Art Museum, Beirut, Lebanon === Awards and teaching === In 1992, d'Azevedo received a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship, and was later awarded a Pollock-Krasner Foundation grant (2000).http://www.artistsconnect.org/dazevedo.htm, \\"Erik d'Azevedo: Painter\\", Artists Connect, Retrieved March 5, 2018 He taught painting at the San Francisco Art Institute in 2000, and was a guest lecturer in the literature department of St. Mary's College in Moraga, California earlier that year. == Writing == D'Azevedo was active in the Bay Area poetry scene beginning in 1984.

He rose to major in 1838 and colonel and head of Archduke Stephen's court in 1843. He was a favourite of Archduchess Sophie and was thus a strong influence on the young Archduke Franz Joseph. He was appointed to the Austrian Empire's privy council in 1847 and in August the following year became obersthofmeister to Franz Joseph. On 19 October 1848 he was made a major general and when Franz Joseph became emperor on 2 December the same year, he made Grünne his chief adjutant and head of his military chancellery. On 12 July 1850 he was promoted to Lieutenant Field Marshal. After Austro- Hungary was defeated in the 1859 Sardinian War, the people and the army mainly placed the blame on Grünne. The emperor wrote him a handwritten letter on 20 October 1859 dismissing him from his post as chief adjutant but making him a colonel and a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Stephen. Grünne also successfully petitioned the emperor to retain his role as captain of the gendarmerie guards. He gained promotion to Cavalry General on 22 November 1864 and on 23 August 1865 was put in command of No. 1 Uhlan Regiment. In 1865 he was made a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece and he also held the post of colonel-equerry until 3 November 1875, on which date he retired from it due to poor health. He spent the summer months of his retirement in Baden bei Wien in complete seclusion. In 1883 he was made a member of the Empire's Herrenhaus, but missed several meetings, again due to his health. He was still held in high esteem by the royal family and was visited at home by Franz Joseph, his son Crown Prince Rudolf and Rudolf's wife Stéphanie. In his later years he separated from his wife Caroline, Countess of Trauttmansdorff- Weinsberg, whom he had married in 1831, by private arrangement rather than by a legal decision. They had three daughters and two sons - Philip became a lieutenant and Rudolph a colonel. Grünne's funeral was held in the Frauenkirche, Maria die Glorreiche in Baden bei Wien (then the court church) and his body was then buried in the family vault at Dobersberg on 19 June 1884.http://austria-forum.org/af/AEIOU/Gr%C3%BCnne,_Karl_Ludwig_Graf ==References== category:1808 births category:1884 deaths category:Austro- Hungarian generals Category:Military personnel from Vienna category:Counts of Austria Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece of Austria Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary ","title":"Karl Ludwig von Grünne"},{"id":"56756353","text":"Carlos Adueza (born 12 February 1932) is a Chilean rower.

It is considered a classic play of Gujarati literature. It tells a story of a gardener who become king due to the circumstances. == Background and structure == Ramanlal was influenced by Kanta (1882), a Gujarati play written by Manilal Dwivedi, and decided to write a play. In 1895, he started writing Raino Parvat but stopped after writing the first act. He briefly worked on it in May 1909. He completed it around the end of 1913 and published it in 1914. Ramanbhai Neelkanth fused the tradition of Sanskrit drama with Shakespearean technique in Raino Parvat, the only play he wrote. It has 7 acts running into 36 scenes. The plot was inspired from the following couplet appearing in the Lalji Maniar Vesha of Bhavai, a traditional Gujarati folk play: == Characters == Principal characters are: * Parvatrai, king of Kanakpur * Lilavati, young queen of Parvatrai * Vinavati, daughter of Parvatrai and Lilavati * Manjari, Lilavati's maid * Sitalsinh, Parvatrai's bodyguard * Jalaka, a gardener woman who is secretly Amritdevi, queen of the predecessor king, Ratnadeep * Rai, a gardener who is secretly Jagdeep, the son of Ratnadeep * Durgesh, the chief of distant land * Kalyankam, a minister * Savitri, wife of Kalyankam * Kamala, daughter of Kalyakam and Savitri * Pushpasen, an army chief == Play == Ramanbhai Neelkanth === Act 1 === Parvatrai, the king of Kanakpur, is concerned about the age difference with his young queen, Lilavati. He is tempted to regain his youth through the rejuvenation treatment of Jalaka, a gardener woman. He enters her garden to see a demonstration but is mistaken for an animal and killed by Rai. Jalaka and the king's bodyguard, Sitalsinh, bury the king in the garden and claim that he is in seclusion for the six-month rejuvenation treatment, leaving his minister, Kalyankam, to rule. Jalaka had been promised one-quarter of the kingdom if the treatment worked. But since Parvatrai is dead, she reveals to Rai that they are Queen Amritdevi and Prince Jagdeepdev, wife and heir of King Ratnadeepdev who Parvatrai dethroned through treachery. Rai agrees to follow his mother's wishes though he is troubled by his conscience. === Act 2 === Kalyankam and the chief of the army, Pushpasen, discuss the state of affairs. Durgesh, chief of a distant region of the state, tries to revolt but Kalyankam shrewdly promotes him as a deputy minister under his close supervision. Durgesh tries to gain the secret of Parvatrai's treatment but Jalaka withholds the information. Rai is injured falling from a horse and brought to Kayahkam's home for treatment. Kalyankam and his wife, Savitri, arrange a marriage between Pushpasen's daughter, Kamala, and Durgesh. === Act 3 === Durgesh, Kamala and Rai travel in disguise to learn how people view the king's rejuvenation experiment. They meet a monk who is displeased with it. Then they come across a group of people wearing mirrors on their bodies who sing that Old Parvatrai removed the mirrors from the palace, and when he is young they want him to return the mirrors to the kingdom. The men in the street remark that they are more concerned with the king's heart than his body, as they want a good king whether old or young. Someone makes a disparaging remark about a woman, which enrages Kamala, dressed as a man, but Durgesh intervenes to stop her attack. After returning home, Rai and Durgesh vow to campaign against the low status of women in the kingdom. === Act 4 === Rai had agreed to act as the rejuvenated king. Sitalsinh secretly takes him to see important places and gain familiarity with Parvatrai's life. He is brought to spy on Lilavati's chambers, where she is eager to lovingly receive her husband. Rai realizes with some shock that becoming king means he will become Lilavati's husband, and feels this to be utterly immoral and unjust. After brief consideration, he decides to give up his right to become Parvatrai's successor. === Act 5 === Six months have passed and a royal procession moves through the streets. Savitri and Kamala try to compare the young king to the Parvatrai they remembered, but are surprised that the new king looks like Rai. He enters the Prabhapunj palace where Queen Lilavati lovingly welcomes him but he refuses her embrace. Rai reveals that he is Prince Jagdeep and explains what happened. Lilavati faints and Rai helps her regain consciousness, respectfully addressing her as queen mother. Unaware of this, Jalaka offers flowers for Lilavati's chambers and is brutally attacked by Lilavati, who curses her: \\"never ever shall ye be queen, and you shall meet death as malan [] with a broken heart like mine.\\" When Rai is crowned as king Parvatrai, he discloses to the court his real identity and asks the people and courtiers to decide the succession within a fortnight, during which time he will withdraw from the city. === Act 6 === Jagdeep is wandering when he saves a woman from a boat mishap on the riverbank. The woman is Vinavati, Parvatrai's daughter who has lived in seclusion since becoming a widow. She falls in love with Jagdeep at first sight and he is enamoured of her. Durgesh acts as a go-between and Vinavati's maid, Rekha, tells of her past history. Jagdeep kisses Vinavati's finger in place of a ring, as a token of his love, and departs. === Act 7 === Sitalsinh, with the help of Lilavati's maid, Manjari, conspires to persuade Lilavati to adopt his son as heir of the crown, but the scheme fails miserably. Jalaka has become despondent and ultimately dies. Jagdeep is elected as Pravatrai's successor and installed as king with Vinavati as the queen. == Criticism == Ramanlal Joshi noted that the handling of dramatic situations, characterization, dialogues, and depiction of lofty sentiments make this play a classical work. However, the play has been criticized for its long drawn-out sequence which is not suitable for the stage. Bipin Jhaveri wrote Raino Parvatni Samiksha (Criticism of Raino Parvat) which was an expansion of his Ph.D. thesis submitted in 1950. Anantrai Raval also published Raino Parvat: Vivechan (Criticism of Raino Parvat) in 1938, reprinted in 1957. Several critics noted that: \\"Ramanbhai Nilkanth, a follower of Prarthana Samaj, asserts his social reformer's signature by arranging Rai's marriage with Vinavati, a widow, in the last two acts which ultimately weakens its plot. == Performance history == Possibly on 14 March 1915, the play was first performed by Gujarati Amateurs Group of Grant Medical College under the leadership of Manubhai, son of Nanalal Dalpatram. The play was split in three acts and it included two songs and a shloka, written by Narsinhrao Divetia. The second performance was held in Ahmedabad in 1926 and was directed by Bapulal Nayak, a Mumbai based actor and director of Mumbai Gujarati Natak Mandali. Jaishankar Sundari played the role of Lilavati in it while the role of Rai was played by Bapulal himself. In 1948, under the guidance of Jaishankar Sundari and Jashvant Thakkar, the students of Gujarat Vidhya Sabha performed Raino Parvat for the centenary of the institution. In this performance, Vinodini Nilkanth, daughter of Ramanbhai Neelkanth, played the role of Jalka. == Adaptations == *Raino Darpanrai, a Gujarati play by Hasmukh Baradi, was adapted from Raino Parvat. *Jalaka, a three-act play by Chinu Modi, is based on the Raino Parvat character of the same name. == Further reading == * * == References  External links == * Category:Gujarati- language books Category:Indian plays Category:1914 plays Category:Plays set in the 20th century Category:Gujarati-language plays ","title":"Raino Parvat"},{"id":"56756522","text":"Portrait of Vitelli Paolo Vitelli (1461 – 1 October 1499) was an Italian knight and condottiero as well as lord of Montone.

Designed by George Fellowes Prynne, the bulk of the church was built in 1894-96. It has been a Grade II listed building since 1974, with the World War I memorial outside also designated Grade II in 2016. In their book The Buildings of England: Dorset, John Newman and Nikolaus Pevsner noted the church's \\"idiosyncratic but convincing design\\". ==History== St Paul's was built to serve the residents of Westham, which developed as a new suburb of Weymouth in the late 19th-century. A chapel of ease to All Saints was first erected to serve Westham in 1880. By 1892, the suburb's population had passed 2,000 and the existing church accommodation became inadequate. A meeting was held at Weymouth Guildhall in June 1892, chaired by the Bishop of Salisbury, which determined that a new church should be erected. A committee was formed to raise funds and a site opposite the church purchased for £655. In 1893, a limited competition was held for architects to send their designs for the church and that of George Fellowes Prynne was selected in favour of two other schemes. Enough funds had been raised to allow construction to begin in 1894, with Mr. W. H. Gooding of Exeter hired as the builder and Mr. R. Ramm as clerk of the works. The foundation stone was laid by the Countess of Hoyos on 9 May 1894. The ceremony was attended by the Bishop of Salisbury, the Weymouth Mayor and Corporation, members of the local clergy and the public. As further funds were required before the entire church could be built, the initial agreement was for enough of the building to be built to provide accommodation for 400 persons. As work progressed, problems emerged with the contractor when it was realised the church could not be completed by the time specified and contracted for. Work was temporarily halted but recommenced when Prynne took over the project himself, with Mr. C. Foad as clerk of the works. The contracted work was completed in 1896 and St Paul's was dedicated by the Bishop of Salisbury, the Right Rev. John Wordsworth, on 25 January 1896. It included two bays of the nave, north aisle, south transept, chancel, vestries and organ chamber, along with the permanent foundation of the whole church. A third bay of the nave, at the west end, was also erected as a temporary section. At the time, £5,600 had been spent on the church and land, £1,850 of which had still to be raised. In the following years, the committee continued to raise funds and the debt was reduced to £600 by 1900. In May 1900, a meeting was held at the Royal Hotel in Weymouth to discuss the proposed consecration of the church and the formation of a separate parish from Wyke Regis. The Bishop of Salisbury offered to consecrate the church on 18 October 1900 if the debt was reduced to £300 by the beginning of that month and if the architect of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners certified St Paul's \\"structurally sufficient\\" as a parish church. £450 was successfully raised and the Bishop of Salisbury consecrated the church on 18 October 1900.

In the late 18th century Trinidad was subordinated administratively to the intendant of Caracas. Machado's predecessor, military governor Rafael Delgado, had been dismissed for incompetence by intendant José de Abalos after a political affair. On March 31, 1781 Machado was appointed as Delgados successor. Delgado's mandate was affected by constant quarrelling with civil governor Martín de Salaverría about competences. This condition continued seamlessly during Machado's short term. In October 1783 the term of civil governor de Salaverría ended, and the Spanish government appointed José María Chacón as his successor. Chacón was supposed to be the first governor since 1779 to be civil and military governor in unison. Since Chacón had to travel to Trinidad first and didn't arrive until August 1784, Machado was appointed civil governor as well on October 18, 1783.Caribbean History Archives: In January 1784 (June 1784 according to a different source) Machado was dismissed by then acting intendant Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis, and Antonio Barreto was appointed governor of Trinidad until Chacón's arrival. Machado protested unavailingly against his dismissal. == References == Category:Governors of Trinidad and Tobago Category:Spanish period of Trinidad and Tobago Category:18th-century births Category:Year of death missing ","title":"Juan Francisco Machado"},{"id":"56756660","text":"The Lentorata (airport railway) is a planned railway line in Finland, designed to link Helsinki Airport to the long-distance Finnish railway network and to complement the current airport connection via the Ring Rail Line. ==History== The Lentorata has been included in the Finnish Transport Agency's plans since 2010. Following the opening of the Ring Rail Line in 2015, Helsinki Airport gained its first railway connection through the Helsinki commuter rail network. However, a need has also been identified for a rail link to long distance traffic, with support from Finavia, the mayors of Helsinki and Tampere and the chief executive of the state-owned national rail company VR Group. ==Route== The line is planned travel in a long tunnel under the airport and allow direct access from long-distance trains, as well as free the rail capacity taken up by long-distance traffic in the current main corridor (the Helsinki–Riihimäki railway) for the increasing local commuter traffic.

Led by the administrative de facto leader known as s1ege (l33tsp33k name for \\"siege\\"). The group's prime intent and focus is embedded on anti-governmental and organization cyber protests within current involvements of media speculation and real life happenings in 2016 to present. ==List of attacks on governments and organizationsEthiopian government=== In January 2016, GSH started its very first attacks by the defacing of Ethiopian government websites in response to the killing of nearly 500 students and activists by Ethiopian Security Forces during protests that became extremely violent was involved in the latter part of 2015 and then sparked again between August and October in 2016 Ethiopian protests. ===Donald Trump=== On May 21, 2016 GSH targeted Donald Trump's official website by launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks for what they saw as racist comments made towards refugees and Mexicans. Shortly after targeting Trump's official website GSH shut down Trump's hotel collection websites. ===Israeli Defense Force=== The group gained more notoriety after having successfully leaked data of the Israeli Defense Force on April 7, 2016. This was the day #OpIsrael was launched along with Anonymous, leaking the Database of Israel Defense Force posting thousands of IDF soldiers, border patrol, and Israeli Air Force personnel information online. ===Ku Klux Klan=== On April 23, 2016 GSH targeted the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan by taking their websites down in the protest of racism while Anonymous vs. KKK protests were happening in the state of Georgia, U.S.A. Ghost Squad Hackers did the same however, in a turn of events taking down Black Lives Matters official websitehttps://blacklivesmatter.com/ after claiming the organization fueled further racism. After encountering further opposition and confrontation between Anonymous activists and BLM group that led to GSH shutting down Black Lives Matter's websitehttps://blacklivesmatter.com/ over 100 times. Word was quick to spread as GSH and Anonymous were both put in spot light by the TV Series Mr. Robot in an article published online. ===Operation Icarus=== GSH and Anonymous worked in correlation together when \\"Operation Icarus\\" was first launched in February 2016. The op was aimed at attacking the central banking system which the attackers accused the banks with corruption and wanted to raise public awareness. This attack sparked the invitation of more hacking teams and affiliations of Anonymous to focus their attention towards that of the Central Banks in direct regards of further scrutiny and cyber attacks. Ghost Squad Hacker's leader s1ege claimed responsibility for the attacks which were carried out on the Bank of England email server and dozens of other banking websites including the New York Stock Exchange, Bank of France, Bank of Greece, Bank of Jordan and the Bank of South Korea, among others. s1ege went on to state that they want to \\"start an online revolution\\" to retaliate against the \\"elite banking cartels putting the world in a perpetual state of chaos.\\" Hundreds of banks were targeted in this operation and to this day the exact number of banks effected is unknown. ===Operation Silence=== Notoriety of the group continued to escalate as the heat was turned up during the month of June, 2016. After censoring of media coverage in regards to OpIsrael, OpSilencehttp://news.softpedia.com/news/anonymous-announces-opsilence-month- long-attacks-on-mainstream-media-504760.shtml was initiated targeting mainstream media outlets such as CNN and Fox News. A data dump was later leaked after hacking the United States Military personnel files and releasing information on close to 2,437 army personnel. The information contained in the link was uploaded to an onion link on the dark web along with a paste-bin link which contained credit card numbers and personal information on U.S. Army personnel. ===Baton Rouge City government website=== July 19, 2016 the sub domain of Baton Rouge City government websitehttps://www.brla.gov/ was hacked twice in one day by GSH after previously making news after attack towards both the KKK and BLM. These attacks however were targeting the City of Baton Rouge, Louisiana in protest against police brutality in which a city native Alton Sterling was shot and killed by Baton Rouge police officers on the 5th earlier that month. The Baton Rouge websitehttps://www.brla.gov/ was defaced along with a picture of Alton Sterling with a message that read, \\"Being black is not a crime! This is for the shooting of Alton Sterling, just because he's black does not mean he is a bad guy. You will pay. We are the justice. We are Ghost Squad Hackers. /R.I.P. Alton Sterling. === Afghanistan government and its officers=== Later in the same month GSH took over the official Twitter account of Afghanistan's Chief Executive Dr. Abdullah Abdullah in an effort to raise awareness against corruption and alleged drug deals between Afghanistan and the U.S. They also targeted the Afghan Public Credit Registry website by defacing it which also further allowed them access to several social media accounts including Dr. Abdullah's in which they tweeted, \\"Afghanistan Gov Hacked by GhostSquadHackers #CheifExecutiveOfficer Can you hear me now? twitter.com/afgexecutive. We found an exploit in the government server and pulled every login we could. We have more also but Dr. Abdullah was not using phone restriction and 2FA was not enabled\\". The attacks on the Afghan government continued relentlessly on the first of September after prior targeting of Afghanistan's Chief Executive Twitter account, GSH further assaulted the government by defacing twelve websites in one day all of which were affiliated with the Afghan government. This included the Afghanistan's Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Refugees and Repatriations, and the Afghan Attorney General's Office. Further assaults continued in hopes of raising awareness for Palestine as part of OpSilencehttp://news.softpedia.com/news/anonymous-announces- opsilence-month-long-attacks-on-mainstream-media-504760.shtml and OpIsrael after shutting down the Israeli Prime Minister and the Bank of Israel.https://www.hackread.com/ghost-squad-attacks-israeli-prime-minister- site/ ===Operation Decrypt ISIS=== The group's focus in 2017 shifted slightly towards targeting ISIS and removing them off the internet and social media completely. A multitude of accounts from Facebook, Twitter, and Telegram alike were hacked and added to an extensive list of ISIS removed. Further efforts by GSH later revealed bomb instructions and plans to be carried out by ISIS. s1ege stated \\"We really do not care about attacking the U.S. elections. They've already been hacked. We mostly hack ISIS\\" in an interview with CBS news in the year 2018. On February 12, 2019 s1ege released a massive leak on Islamic State Telegram and WhatsApp group's/channel's administrators. The leak included hacked phones/mobile devices, hacked Telegram accounts, hacked Facebook's, hacked Twitter accounts, credit cards, geolocation data, government issued ID cards, and IP logs belonging to the administrators. The group successfully infiltrated the Islamic state community on encrypted communication applications and exposed the administrators by using malware and exploits. The leak was published on mega.nz and Ghost Squad Hackers Official Twitter account.https://mega.nz/#F!bKYFiaxb!KkdI- OudR3tW4jLd4YEeLwhttps://ghostbin.com/paste/ez8te pic.twitter.com/RiVnxFr6cChttps://twitter.com/__s1ege/status/109853361015461068 One of the Telegram and WhatsApp Admins (Riffat Mahmood Khan) was a former taxi driver living in Auburn was linked to ISIS and accused of administering the group's encrypted messages. He traveled to Syria in support of the Islamic State in 2015. He returned from the conflict zone via Turkey six months later, and was promptly picked up by Australian Federal Police officers at the airport as he flew in, in September 2015. Video footage from the raids obtained by The Herald showed his wife and the children being led away from the home by uniformed police, while officers swarm on the Auburn home. He is believed to not have actually participated in the fighting in Syria, but spent time there with the radical group before returning and allegedly continuing his work for the Caliphate. The man remained involved with the Islamic State's encrypted online messaging and continued to take care of the WhatsApp and Telegram groups that the radical Islamic group uses to communicate internally and for recruiting. Documents leaked by GSH showed that several of the accused ISIS supporter's children were enrolled in local Islamic school Al Bayan. He attended South Granville mosque Al Noor, where some sources suggest he became radicalized. Images from his hacked phone exposed by GSH depicted the ISIS flag flying above Venice, explosions, blood-stained knives, children brandishing ISIS flags, a meme saying 'One bullet away from Paradise' and critically wounded soldiers. Leaked data from GSH showed one Belgian (Siraj El Moussaoui), known to be an ISIS supporter, had a video on his phone about how to most effectively behead someone. Siraj El Moussaoui tried in vain to join the Islamic State in 2016 and was arrested shortly after on suspicion of plotting an attack in Belgium. === 2020 Comeback === Ghost Squad Hackers made a comeback since the beginning of the COVID-19 period in a number of ways. There's been a large number of defacements to government sites as well as root ownership of an Indian Government server and also leaked data from the Australian government. Cited attacks in April 2020 included places such as Australia, India and various other governments. The Twitter feed of GSH has shared a multitude of alleged attacks on various government websites during the pandemic using hashtags associated with previous campaigns of #FreeJulianAssange. In June the group claimed responsibility for the hacking of other Indian government websites in protest against the internet ban in Jammu and Kashmir. GSH gave warning in a LiveWire interview saying “To the people of Jammu and Kashmir, we will support your efforts and continue to back you through this pandemic and tyrannical government's grip. If India's government is persistent, we will be more persistent and consistent. No region/state/ethnic group should not have access to the internet, not even limited access. These are basic civil rights and liberties.” The group defaced the European Space Agency (ESA) website https://business.esa.int in July of this year. GSH claimed the attack was just for fun. They explained that they exploited a server-side request forgery (SSRF) remote code execution vulnerability in the server, then they gained access to the business.esa.int server and defaced it. Having no interest in leaking any data their intent was solely to show the server was vulnerable. Within a week of hacking the business domain of the ESA they defaced the https://space4rail.esa.int website as well. Later in the month of July on the 27th GSH successfully targeted Idaho state websites servers locking agencies out of their own servers. Idaho Government websites targeted included the Idaho supreme court, Idaho court, Idaho Parks and Recreation, Idaho STEM Action Center, and were victims to the group. The sites were used to broadcast messages referencing Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, who was charged with violating the Espionage Act. The messages read “Free Julian Assange! Journalism is not a crime.” September 3, 2020 - GSH claimed responsibility for the breach of the Vermont Sheriff's Association, which resulted in a data leak of names, addresses, financial data and communications between/to various Vermont sheriffs. The leaked data was published in retaliation to the shootings of various individuals who fell victim to police brutality; including George Floyd, Jacob Blake, and Breonna Taylor. ==References== Category:Hacker groups Category:Hacking in the 2000s Category:Anonymous (group) Category:Cybercrime ","title":"Ghost Squad Hackers"},{"id":"56756686","text":"Rustam Adzhi (born 3 March 1973) is a Ukrainian wrestler.

Hundreds of his Q&A; interviews and libertarian op-ed columns written for the Pittsburgh Trib were nationally syndicated in the 2000s by CagleCartoons.com.

Steigerwald's research in libraries and on his own 11,276-mile road trip in 2010 proved that Steinbeck and his editors at The Viking Press had significantly fictionalized the account of his iconic journey.

However, some doubts remain, since Troilo's cousin Bernardo de' Rossi (bishop of Treviso) states that \\"the Rossi bastard was in the French camp\\", referring to Troilo I and his father Giovanni being the only members of the Rossi family not to fight alongside the Venetians at Fornovo. It is unknown whether \\"\\"bastard\\" accurately describes Troilo I as illegitimate or whether its usage is simply pejorative - Bernardo considered Troilo I as usurping the fiefdom of San Secondo from its legitimate heir, Bernardo's brother Filippo Maria. See Le signorie dei Rossi di Parma, a cura di L. Arcangeli e M. Gentile, Firenze 2008 p. 267, he was born in San Secondo. He took part in Louis XII of France's conquest of the duchy of Milan in 1500, during which many lands taken from his grandfather by Ludovico il Moro and ending up in the hands of members of the Sforza family were restored to him. However, it proved impossible to restore to him all the lands his family had controlled in the time of Pier Maria II and it was possibly as compensation for this fact that Louis made him marquess of San Secondo on 15 August 1502. Louis also made him a senator of Milan in 1505 and allowed him to accept the inheritance left him by his uncle Bertrando in 1502 in return for a payment of 8000 florins and the promise never to rehabilitate his cousin Filippo Maria, Troilo's bitter rival and the designated heir of Pier Maria II.

He restored the Rocca dei Rossi at San Secondo, rebuilding its bastions and towers, which had been demolished during the war with the Sforza, and expanding the defensive perimeter. He died there in June 1521, leaving the marquisate weak - his heirs were still in their minority and so the Rossi of Corniglio tried to take advantage of the situation with a force led by Filippo Maria and Bernardo, descendants of Guido de' Rossi, the son Pier Maria II had chosen to succeed himself. ==Marriage and issue== In 1503 he married countess Bianca Riario, daughter of Girolamo Riario, lord of Imola and sister of Giovanni dalle Bande Nere, pope Sixtus IV's nephew and pope Julius II's cousin.

A popular honeymoon destination for Japanese couples, the park's Peace Tower has generated controversy because of its place in Japanese history. ==Park description== Heiwadai Park is located in the Shimokitagata-cho region of Miyazaki City. It has an area of . The park houses the Miyazaki Shrine, which is devoted to Emperor Jimmu who by legend is from the Miyazaki region. ==History== The park was constructed in 1939 to commemorate the 2600th anniversary of Japan's Imperial establishment. The Hakko Ichiu tower, later renamed the Peace Tower, was built in 1940. When princess Takako Shimazu honeymooned there in 1960, the park became a favorite destination for Japanese newlyweds. Hibiya Park was designated Heiwadai's sister park in 1965, in a ceremony in which Heiwadai received doves from Hibiya. ==Haniwa Garden== Haniwa Garden The Haniwa Garden, in size, is located north of the Peace Tower. A central feature of the Haniwa Garden is more than 400 haniwa (terracotta clay figures) which are placed along paths within the garden. These are earthenware replicas of burial haniwa originally excavated at the site. These figures take the form of animals, boats, dancers, houses, and warriors. ==Peace Tower== Contemporary view of Heiwadai Tower A tower was constructed in 1940 to memorialize the installment of Japan's first emperor, Jimmu. The original name was Hakkō ichiu Tower, meaning \\"Eight World Regions Under One Roof,\\" a slogan of the Imperial Japanese Army. Designed by Jitsuzo Hinago, the tower was created from stones gathered from around the then-current extent of the Japanese empire at a cost of 670,000 yen. The writing \\"Hakkō ichiu\\" was removed after the Japanese defeat at the insistence of the U.S. military. The tower was the inception point for the torch relay of the 1964 Summer Olympics. Subsequent to the Olympics, which coincided with worldwide interest in the Japanese Imperial family, the local tourism association successfully petitioned the Miyazaki Prefecture to re-install the \\"Hakkō ichiu\\" characters. The tower has been a point of some controversy, as many Japanese citizens wonder how a structure created specifically to convey Japanese might during a period of conquest can now be a symbol for peace. Some people consider the lack of documentation regarding the militaristic genesis of the tower to subtract from the structure's re-imagined power as a symbol for peace. Other survivors of the period have stated that the tower allows the horrors of war to be passed down through generations. ==References== Category:Parks and gardens in Miyazaki Prefecture Category:1939 establishments in Japan ","title":"Heiwadai Park"},{"id":"56757086","text":"The 1971 World Table Tennis Championships – Men's Doubles was the 31st edition of the men's doubles championship.

It proved impossible to get her off and as waves poured over her and she filled with water he had Shamrocks masts cut away. They fell towards shore and the crew used them to scramble to safety. Still, two men died in the wreck. When the sun rose, Croke was able to see that Shamrock was about one and a half miles south of Cabo de Santa Maria. The location was approximately . The subsequent court-martial admonished Croke to be more careful in the future.

JobTeaser is a French company that provides recruitment solutions to companies for the recruitment of young talent and a free career center software to higher education institutions in Europe. It was founded by Adrien Ledoux and Nicolas Lombard in 2008. Its head office is in the 9th arrondissement of Paris. As of January 2018, over 700.000 students and 500 universities used the service across Europe. == History  Early steps === Adrien Ledoux and Nicolas Lombard created JobTeaser in 2008, with the aim of changing access to information about companies for young talents. From the beginning, they focused on students looking for an internship and recent graduates looking for their first job. The first goal of JobTeaser was to let companies make videos about them, their employees’ daily missions and their culture to help students in their career guidance. === First fundraising and business model changes === In 2013, JobTeaser created career centers that they implemented in French business and engineering schools. They used the institution’s branding and replaced its old career center with the JobTeaser platform. The first serviced institution was French business school ESSEC. The platform featured information about jobs and companies, as well as career advice and job and internship listings. JobTeaser used a two-sided market approach by equipping one market for free and getting revenue streams from another market. JobTeaser also launched a yearly “Employment Barometer”. In this report, they compared the jobs and industries that recruit the most and those that appeal to students and young graduates the most. At the beginning of 2015, JobTeaser received 3 million euros in funding from Seventure Partners, with the aim of becoming a European leader for recruiting young talents. Later in the year, the company signed their first university intranet with the Université de Nantes. === Second fundraising and European expansion === As part of their European expansion, JobTeaser opened an office in Munich, Germany. As of May 2017, they were active in France, Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, and Luxembourg. They serviced 90% of the CAC 40 companies. In May 2017, JobTeaser raised 15 million euros to speed up their international expansion. Their investors are Alven Capital, Idinvest Partners, Seventure Partners and Korelya Capital. Adrien Ledoux said that the funds would mostly be used for recruiting international business developers and expand beyond their active countries. == Features == JobTeaser has a public website, as well as career center platforms for each of their institutional partners. These partners can share private information with their students, such as extra job offers or on-campus events. On all platforms, JobTeaser offers video content about companies and jobs at these companies. The company’s revenue is based on paid deals with companies. Their main activity is multi-posting: a company can pay to target several Universities using the Career Center and post only once on the whole system, therefore saving time. == Corporate affairs  Human resources === In 2015, the company had 20 employees. At the end of 2016, the company had 70 employees. As of January 2019, the company has 200 employees. The company won the Great Place to Work award in November 2016. == Notes and references  See also == Category:French companies established in 2008 ","title":"JobTeaser"},{"id":"56757193","text":"Péter Majoros (born August 5, 1979 in Ózd, HungaryBiography on NLCafe.huBiography on starity.hu), known professionally as Majka, is a Hungarian rapper, songwriter and television host.

The company acquired Boston, Massachusetts-based Wired Puppy and Atlanta, Georgia-based Octane Coffee in 2017 and presently operates coffee shops under their brands. == History  Foundation and expansion === Revelator Coffee was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on October 9, 2013. The company was founded by Josh Owen, Emma Chevalier and Elizabeth Pogue, who served as president, creative director and director of operations, respectively. The company was officially announced in March 2014, with its corporate headquarters, including their roastery, in New Orleans, Louisiana. They initially planned to open four shops, one in New Orleans, another in Birmingham, Alabama and two in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to serve as pilot projects. In February 2015, Revelator Coffee announced that they were moving their corporate headquarters and roastery to a 10,000 square feet warehouse located in Birmingham.

The term is often applied to paintings that were frequently displayed in High Qing China during the New Year and birthdays.

Todd studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, but did not complete his degree, joining the Royal Navy instead in 1809. ===Navy career=== Todd began his career as a Royal Navy surgeon working in the Royal Naval Hospital at Plymouth. He later sailed to the East Indies and the Cape of Good Hope and was appointed surgeon on the flagship of Sir Robert Stopford aged only 23. While at the Cape of Good Hope aboard , he performed experiments on the electric ray (Torpedo sp), which were published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. Todd retired from the navy in 1816, and lived in Italy for 6 or 7 years. Following this he returned to his studies and completed two medical degrees, first at the University of Montpellier, then at the University of Aberdeen before ultimately settling in Brighton in 1829, where he developed a medical practice. ===Scientific Work=== While studying and then working as a physician in Brighton, Todd continued to publish papers on natural history, including work on fireflies in \\"The Luminous Power of Some of the Lampyrides\\" in 1827. In 1831 wrote \\"The Book of Analysis. A New Method of Experience\\", in order to encourage physicians and scientists to apply the Baconian method of inductive reasoning to medicine and the other natural sciences. Todd began experiments on healing using newts at the British Naval base in Naples, and continued when he moved to Brighton. He conducted a series of experiments on the newts and other animals such as worms to study the processes of healing and regeneration of wounds and amputated body parts. These were the first experiments that proved that nerves have a role in healing, and that amphibian limbs cannot regenerate if the nerves are cut. He observed the healing process microscopically and collaborated with histologist Charles Ager to produce over 3,000 microscope slides to illustrate his findings. These slides are amongst the earliest surviving examples of the use of Canada balsam as a mountant. Todd's research was not well known in the second half of the 19th century, but was the basis of many studies in the early 20th century, and more recently the importance of Todd's work has been acknowledged by medical historians. Todd died from Tuberculosis on 4 August 1840, in Hurst, Sussex. He was aged 50 or 51. After his death his large collection of microscope slides came to the attention of Richard Owen, who was then the conservator of the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons in London, but would later become the first director of the Natural History Museum. Owen was impressed by the quality of the slides and in 1841 he purchased 1,500 of them for £150 to use in the teaching of surgeons. The slides are considered to be important in the history of medicine, histology and microscopy and they remain in the College's collection today. ==Published works== * Some Observations and Experiments Made on the Torpedo of the Cape of Good Hope in the Year 1812.

He successfully invaded the Paramara kingdom of Malwa, and fought inconclusive wars against the Vaghelas and the Hoysalas. The Yadava inscriptions also credit him or his generals with several other victories, but these claims are of doubtful veracity. == Early life == Krishna was a grandson of the Yadava king Simhana, and succeeded Simhana presumably because his father Jaitugi II died before Simhana. An inscription dated 2 November 1248 was issued during the second year of Simhana's reign, and an inscription dated 25 December 1248 was issued during the third year of his reign. This suggests that Simhana ascended the throne in November or December 1246. In various Kannada inscriptions, Krishna's name appears as Kanha, Kanhara or Kandhara. == Wars == Krishna maintained the territory that he had inherited from his grandfather. The Yadava inscriptions credit him with several conquests. For example, the Munoli inscription describes him as: === Paramaras === The Paramara dynasty ruled the Malwa kingdom located to the north of the Yadava kingdom. By the time of Krishna's ascension, the Paramara power and prestige had declined because of invasions from the Iltutmish-led Delhi Sultanate. Krishna took advantage of this situation, and invaded Malwa sometime during the reign of the Paramara king Jaitugideva. The invasion must have happened in or before 1250, when the Yadava records first mention it. The Munoli inscription compares Krishna to Shiva (trinetra) and the Paramara king to the Madana (in Hindu mythology, Shiva incinerates Madana). The Mamadapur inscription also alludes to Krishna's victory over the Paramara king. The invasion does not seem to have resulted in any territorial annexation. === Vaghelas === Krishna also attempted an invasion of the Vaghela-ruled Gujarat (Gurjara) region. The Vaghela king Visala-deva had married a Hoysala princess: both these kingdoms were traditional rivals of the Yadavas, and the marriage may have provided additional provocation for Krishna's invasion. The conflict was probably limited to a few frontier skirmishes, which variously resulted in advantage for the Yadavas and the Vagehlas, and did not result in any significant territorial changes. Both Yadava and Vaghela records claim victory in this inconclusive conflict. The Yadavas' Paithan inscription and a eulogy by their court-poet Hemadri claim that Krishna destroyed the forces of Visala-deva. On the other hand, the Vaghelas' Dabhoi inscription claims that Visala-deva defeated Krishna. === Hoysalas === Krishna's general Chamunda claims to have \\"humbled the pride\\" of the Hoysala king Someshvara sometime before 1250. According to historian A. S. Altekar, this may be a reference to the Yadava success in a frontier skirmish. Historian T. V. Mahalingam theorizes that the Yadava forces were able to capture a part of the Hoysala territory, as attested by the discovery of Krishna's inscriptions in the present-day Chitradurga district. The Hoysala records claim victory for Someshvara. === Pandyans === Krishna's general Bichana, who was the viceroy of the southern part of Yadava kingdom, claims to have defeated the Pandyans sometime before 1253. Historian T. V. Mahalingam believes this to be conventional claim without any historical basis. According to historian A. S. Altekar, there may be some truth to this claim: the Pandyan king Jatavarman Sundara had invaded the Kakatiya kingdom, advancing as far as Nellore. It is possible that the Kakatiya king Ganapati, who ruled as a Yadava feudatory for several years, requested Krishna's help against the Pandya invasion, and Krishna dispatched Bichana to help him. === Cholas === The Munoli inscription of Krishna's general Chamunda states that Krishna defeated the Cholas, but this appears to be an exaggeration. === Kalachuris === The Munoli inscription states that Krishna captured the Kalachuri capital Tripuri. The Kalachuri kingdom had ceased to exist by the mid-13th century, and their former territory had practically turned into a no-man's land. it is possible that Krishna or one of his generals occupied Tripuri for a while. == Last days == Krishna's last inscription is dated May 1261. His son Ramachandra was probably not born or was not old enough to hold the title of yuvaraja (heir apparent) at the time of his ascension, or to ascend the throne at the time of his death. Krishna's brother Mahadeva, who was designated the heir apparent since at least 1250 and assisted the king in the administration, succeeded him in 1261. Mahadeva was succeeded by his son Ammana, but Ramachandra forcefully dethroned him and became the new king in 1271. == Administration == Simhana's generals and officers, such as Bichana and his elder brother Mallisetti, continued to serve Krishna. Mallisetti, who was a district officer under Simhana, rose to the rank of sarva-deshadhikari (viceroy) early in Krishna's reign. His son Chamunda-raya held the titles maha-pradhana and maha-matya since around 1250. Lakshmideva, a Gujarati Brahmin, was another important minister of Krishna, and claims to have helped consolidate the king's rule. His son Jalhana was a counsellor as well as a leader of the elephant force, and claims to have won several battles for Krishna. Jalhana also compiled or commissioned the compilation of the Sanskrit anthology Sukti-muktavali. His sons Ramachandra and Keshava held fiefs in present-day Satara district, and continued to serve the Yadavas after their father's death. == Religion == Krishna followed Vedic Hinduism, and one of his inscriptions describes him as Vedoddhara (\\"upholder of the Vedas\\"). 13th century Yadava court scholar Hemadri credits him with performing several ritual sacrifices and rejuvenating the weakened dharma. The Mahanubhava text Lila-charita states that Krishna had high regard for the Mahanubhava saints, he visited the sect's founder Chakradhara at Lonar. == Cultural activities == The literary works composed during Krishna's reign include: * Sukti-muktavali, a Sanskrit anthology containing selections of writings from celebrated poets: it was compiled or commissioned by Krishna's minister Jalhana * Vedanta-kalpataru, Amalananda's commentary on Vachaspati- mishra's Bhamati == References  Bibliography === * * Category:Seuna (Yadava) dynasty ","title":"Krishna of Devagiri"},{"id":"56757424","text":"Kannara may refer to: * Krishna I (r. c. 756-774 CE), Rashtrakuta king of present-day India * Krishna II (r. c. 878–914 CE), Rashtrakuta king of present-day India * Krishna of Devagiri (r. c. 1246-1260 CE), Seuna (Yadava) king of present-day India * Kannara, Thrissur, a village in Kerala, India ","title":"Kannara"},{"id":"56757431","text":"Gobio huanghensis is a species of gudgeon, a small freshwater in the family Cyprinidae.

She began studying architecture in 1922 at UCLA, but transferred to the University of California, Berkeley in 1923 after the program at UCLA was discontinued. She graduated in 1926 with her B.A., after which she continued with post-graduate studies for one year, receiving her master's in 1927.Horton, Inge. \\"Olive Chadeayne,\\" IAWA Newsletter, Fall 1993, V. 5, No. 1, p. 1. ==Career== Following her graduation, Chadeayne sought work at a number of Los Angeles- based firms, but found that few would consider hiring a woman. Eventually she was able to find work as a draftsperson at the firm of Pierpoint and Walter S. Davis. After their office closed during the Depression, she was able to find work in the mid-1930s with the architect and fellow UC Berkeley alumna Lilian Jeannette Rice. Based in the Rancho Santa Fe area, she specialized in residences and civic buildings in the Spanish Colonial Revival style. Following Rice's death from ovarian cancer in late 1938, Chadeayne completed several of her unfinished projects and closed the firm's office soon thereafter. She began to teach a House Planning course at Cornell University as part of the Home Economics curriculum, but returned to Burbank, California in 1942, where she worked as a production illustrator for the Lockheed Corporation for the rest of World War II. Chadeayne resumed her own practice following the war, while contracting with other firms. In 1951, she took a job with the large firm David, Mann, Johnson, and Mendenhall where she became experienced in writing specifications, which developed into her specialty for the remainder of her career. She retired in 1970, but continued to work on a part-time basis and shared her expertise through organizations like the Association for Women Architects and the American Institute of Architects. ==Notable projects== ;Buildings, designs *Entrance lobby, Pasadena Civic Auditorium, Pasadena, California (1932) *Burroughs Residence, La Jolla, California (1938) *Cramer Residence, Studio City, California (1945) *Stratton Store, Van Nuys, California (1946) *Bevis Residence, Patterson, California (1949 - 1953) *Theis Residence, Huntington Palisades, California (1950) *Theis Residence, Los Angeles, California (1950 - 1951) *Schiebel Residence, Pacific Palisades, California (1956) ;Buildings, specifications *U.S. Consulate in Singapore, Singapore *Bank of America Headquarters, 555 California Street, San Francisco, California (1966 - 1970) ==See also== * Lilian Jeannette Rice * List of women architects * The International Archive of Women in Architecture ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Horton, Inge S.

Smith, professor at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, in a 2014 op-ed for The Hollywood Reporter and in her 2016 TED talk. Together with the film executive Fanshen Cox DiGiovanni and the employment attorney Kalpana Kotagal Smith created a template for an inclusion rider. Inclusion riders became more widely known at the 2018 Academy Awards, when actress Frances McDormand said at the end of her Best Actress acceptance speech, \\"I have two words to leave with you tonight, ladies and gentlemen: inclusion rider!\\" McDormand had learned about inclusion riders only the week before the awards ceremony. Still, in June 2019, the New York Times reported that inclusion riders remained rarely used, even though studios pursued other diversity policies.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw. ==Geography== Moneynure is bounded on the north by Derry More townland, on the west by Arderry and Derryconnessy townlands and on the east by Prospect, Corlough and Tirnawannagh townlands. Its chief geographical features are Brackley Lough and small streams. Moneynure is traversed by minor roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 91 statute acres. ==History== The 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the name as Munenoore. In the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 24 February 1614, King James VI and I granted, inter alia, one pole of Monenoure to Phelim McHugh O'Reyly, Bryan McHugh O'Reyly and Cahir McHugh O'Reyly, the sons of Hugh Reyly, late of Ballaghaneo, County Cavan. Ballaghaneo is now the townland of Ballaghanea in Lurgan Parish, County Cavan, on the shores of Lough Ramor, so the O'Reillys were removed a long way from their home by the Plantation. Hugh Reyly was the great-grandnephew of the chief of the O'Reilly clan, Eoghan na Fésóige mac Seoain, who ruled from 1418–1449. The O’Reilly lands in Moneynure were confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 and were distributed as follows- The 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the proprietor as Captain Payne and the tenant as Daniell McConell.

His family moved from Poland to Cologne, West Germany, in order to escape communism. Boros earned a degree in communication design from the University of Wuppertal, Germany. He wrote his thesis on the aesthetic of the evil characters in James Bond. ==Career== Boros founded an eponymous advertising agency in Wuppertal. Boros has appeared in the ARTnews list of the top 200 collectors since 2006. In 2003, Boros and his wife purchased a former Second World War bomb shelter, the Reichsbahnbunker in Mitte, Berlin. The bunker was converted by Casper Mueller Kneer, who are responsible for White Cube in London. In 2008, Boros opened his gallery in the bunker. The gallery space of was designed by Realarchitektur, including the rooftop residential penthouse, and contained pieces that Boros had been collecting for over 30 years.

Entrance to the gallery is by guided tour only. Boros' bunker was built in 1943 by the architect Karl Bonatz on the orders of Adolf Hitler. After the Second World War, the bunker was used as a fruit warehouse, before later becoming a fetish nightclub, with a reputation for being the \\"most hardcore club in the world,\\" featuring techno music and frequent sadomasochism (S&M;) nights, or \\"raves and sex parties\\" according to ARTnews. ==Personal life== Boros is married to Karen Lohmann, and they live in Berlin, in a 550 sq metre (5920 sq feet) penthouse flat above their gallery. ==Controversy== Boros bought a building which was home to a children dancing school for twenty years.

In 1927 he was one of the best two-year-old colts in England when he won three of his five races including the National Breeders' Produce Stakes. In the following year he won the 2000 Guineas and the Great Yorkshire Stakes as well as finishing second in the Epsom Derby and fourth in the St Leger. After his retirement from racing he had some success as a breeding stallion. ==Background== Flamingo was a small but \\"beautifully made\\" bay horse bred in England by Sir John Robinson. As a yearling he was offered for sale and was bought for 1800 guineas by Jack Jarvis on behalf of Laurence Philipps, 1st Baron Milford. The colt was take into training by Jarvis at his Park Lodge stable at Newmarket, Suffolk. Flamingo was sired by Flamboyant, a top-class stayer who won the Doncaster Cup in 1921 and the Goodwood Cup in 1922. Flamingo's dam Lady Peregrine has a half-sister to Omar Khayyam and became a very influential broodmare whose other descendants have included Aloma's Ruler, Septimus and Cirrus des Aigles. ==Racing career1927: two-year-old season=== In the spring of 1927 Flamingo won the appropriately named Spring Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. He finished fourth behind Sunny Trace in the Windsor Castle Stakes at Royal Ascot in June and then took the Fulbourne Stakes at Newmarket in early July, winning \\"cleverly\\" by a neck. Later in July, at Sandown Park he was ridden by Charlie Elliott (jockey) the National Breeders' Produce Stakes which was then the most valuable two-year-old race in England. Starting at odds of 7/1 in a 21-runner field he won from Jack Mytton and Maret Girl with the favoured Pharamond unplaced. He finished second on his other start that year. Flamingo ended the season with earnings of £7328, making him the most financially successful juvenile in England, and was regarded with Fairway as one of the two leading contenders for the following year's Epsom Derby. He was described as a \\"dour fighter\\", but lacking in scope and room for improvement. In the Free Handicap, an assessment of the best two- year-olds to race in Britain he was assigned a weight of 122 pounds, making him the fourth-best horse of his generation behind Fairway, The Hermit II and Buland. ===1928: three-year-old season=== During the winter of 1927/8 Jack Jarvis was reported to be \\"intensely pleased\\" with the colt's progress. Flamingo began his second season by taking the Column Produce Stakes at Newmarket in April winning by a neck from Sans Changer, to whom he was conceding fifteen pounds in weight. On 2 May, Flamingo, ridden by Elliott, started at odds of 5/1 for the 120th running over the Rowley Mile. Despite sweating up before the start, he was always traveling well and won by a head from Royal Minstrel with O'Curry a length and a half away in third. After the race Elliott said, \\"I had the race won just when I wanted... when I shook him up he answered with the gameness I expected.\\" In the Epsom Derby over one and a half miles on 6 June Flamingo was strongly fancied although Fairway started favourite. In the immediate build-up to the race the colt had been afforded police protection to prevent his being targeted by \\"dopers and other evilly- disposed individuals\\". Flamingo broke well and disputed the lead with Sunny Trace with the pair going \\"hell for leather\\" and setting an extremely strong pace before the latter gave way, allowing Flamingo open up a clear advantage in the straight. He looked exhausted however in the last quarter mile and was overtaken by the 33/1 outsider Felstead who won by one and a half lengths. Later that month the colt was beaten when sent to France for the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp Racecourse. According to press reports he started favourite but became agitated and upset owing to his unfamiliarity with the French starting procedures and finished unplaced behind Cri de Guerre. Flamingo returned to the track in late August and won the Great Yorkshire Stakes over fourteen furlongs at York Racecourse carrying a weight of 135 pounds. On 10 September Flamingo contested the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse. Racing on unusually firm ground he came home fourth of the thirteen runners behind Fairway, Palais Royal and Cyclonic. ===1929: four-year-old season=== Flamingo remained in training as a four-year- old in 1929 with the Ascot Gold Cup as his objective but did not stand up to training and was retired from racing at the end of the year. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Flamingo an \\"inferior\\" winner of the 2000 Guineas. ==Stud record== After his retirement from racing Flamingo became a breeding stallion in England. The best of his offspring included Flyon (Ascot Gold Cup) and Flamenco (St James's Palace Stakes), Bao Dai (Prix du Petit Couvert, Prix La Haye Jousselin). Flamingo died on 7 November 1947. ==Pedigree== *Flamingo was inbred 3 × 4 to St Simon, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree. ==References== Category:1925 racehorse births Category:1947 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 9-h Category:2000 Guineas winners ","title":"Flamingo (horse)"},{"id":"56757769","text":"Léonor-Joseph Havin (1799-1868) was a French politician. ==Biography== He was born in Paris.

The tour, consisting of 147 shows worldwide, served as a conclusion of the band's three-and-a-half-decade-long career. ==Background== The tour was announced on January 22, 2018 through a video featuring a montage of press clippings, early posters and press photos spanning Slayer's entire career. It was announced at the expense of vocalist/bassist Tom Araya's desire of no longer wanting to tour and spend more time with his family. The first leg of the North American tour was announced the day after, which took place in May and June 2018 and included support from Lamb of God, Anthrax, Behemoth and Testament. The second leg of the North American tour was announced on March 5, 2018; this leg took place in July and August, and featured four out of five bands from the first leg (Slayer, Lamb of God, Anthrax and Testament) and Napalm Death as the replacement for Behemoth. On February 20, 2018, Slayer announced the first European date of the farewell tour; it was announced that they would headline the Secret Solstice Festival in Reykjavík, Iceland in June. A European leg of the farewell tour took place in November and December 2018, with support provided by Lamb of God, Anthrax and Obituary. Guitarist Gary Holt had to miss the last four dates of this tour so that he could take care of his father who was nearing the end of his life; he was filled in by former Machine Head and Vio-lence guitarist Phil Demmel. On June 24, 2018, Slayer was announced as one of the first five bands (alongside Manowar, Carcass, Mass Hysteria and Dropkick Murphys) confirmed to play the 2019 edition of Hellfest. This was the band's first show announced for 2019, and was said to be their last-ever show in France. Slayer also played a one-off show in Mexico at ForceFest in October 2018. Slayer continued touring into 2019; in addition to international festival appearances, they performed in areas that the tour had not yet visited, including South America, Australia and Japan; Anthrax was the supporting act on most of the dates. Slayer toured North America in May 2019, with Lamb of God, Amon Amarth and Cannibal Corpse as the opening acts. The final North American leg of the tour took place in November 2019, and included support by Primus, Ministry and Philip H. Anselmo & The Illegals. The band's final appearance in Chile on October 6, 2019 at the Santiago Gets Louder festival marked the first time two of the \\"Big Four\\" (Slayer and Anthrax) had shared the stage with one of the members of the \\"Big Teutonic Four\\" of thrash, Kreator. Megadeth – who had not shared the stage with Slayer and Anthrax since the series of \\"Big Four\\" shows in 2010-2011 – was initially scheduled to perform at the festival, but cancelled due to Dave Mustaine's illness and was replaced by Kreator. On how long the farewell tour would last, Exodus vocalist and Holt's bandmate Steve \\"Zetro\\" Souza indicated that it would \\"take a year and a half or two years to do the one final thing, but I believe it's finished. Everybody knows what I know; just because I'm on the outside, I have no insight on that.\\" Kristen Mulderig, who works with Rick Sales Entertainment Group, said that there would still be Slayer-related activities after the tour's conclusion. Despite being referred to as a farewell tour, the band's manager, Rick Sales, said that the tour was not a foreshadowing of their split, but an end of touring. Former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo did not attend the band's final show. After finishing the set from their final show at The Forum on November 30, 2019, the band and crew members hugged each other and took group photos, followed by Tom Araya bidding farewell to the fans. Guitarist Gary Holt expressed his gratitude towards the band members and then thanked the fans for making him feel welcomed since joining in 2011. ==Average setlist== This is the average setlist for the tour according to Setlist.fm. #\\"Repentless\\" #\\"Blood Red\\" #\\"Disciple\\" #\\"Hate Worldwide\\" #\\"Mandatory Suicide\\" #\\"War Ensemble\\" #\\"Jihad\\" #\\"Postmortem\\" #\\"When the Stillness Comes\\" #\\"Payback\\" #\\"Seasons of the Abyss\\" #\\"Black Magic\\" #\\"Dittohead\\" #\\"Hell Awaits\\" #\\"Chemical Warfare\\" #\\"Dead Skin Mask\\" #\\"South of Heaven\\" #\\"Raining Blood\\" #\\"Angel of Death\\" ==Tour dates== {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! width=\\"200\\" Date ! width=\\"200\\" City ! width=\\"200\\" Country ! width=\\"300\\" Venue ! width=\\"200\\" Opening acts ! width=\\"300\\" Tickets Sold/Available -

He also featured in twenty singles as a guest artist, and he entered the charts with more than seventy additional songs. Eminem's debut single, \\"Just Don't Give a Fuck\\", was released in 1998 and included in The Slim Shady EP, as well as in the rapper's second studio album, The Slim Shady LP, which featured a re-worked version of the song. The rapper's first song to enter the Billboard Hot 100 was \\"My Name Is\\", which was released in 1999 and became the most successful single from The Slim Shady LP. The lead single from Eminem's third studio album, The Marshall Mathers LP, was the song \\"The Real Slim Shady\\", which became his first entry in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100. The third single from the album, \\"Stan\\" featured vocals from British singer Dido, sampled from her song \\"Thank You\\". \\"Stan\\" was the album's most successful single outside of the States, while it failed to reach the top fifty in the rapper's home country. In 2002, Eminem released the singles \\"Without Me\\" and \\"Cleanin' Out My Closet\\" from his album The Eminem Show, as well as the single \\"Lose Yourself\\", from the 8 Mile soundtrack, which became the rapper's first number one song on the Hot 100 and remained on the top for twelve weeks. The song also reached the top of various national charts worldwide. In 2009, the song \\"Crack a Bottle\\", a collaboration with label- mates Dr. Dre and 50 Cent, became Eminem's second number one on the Hot 100 and broke the record for opening week download sales in the United States, with 418,000 copies sold in the first week. Recovery's singles \\"Not Afraid\\" and \\"Love the Way You Lie\\" featuring Rihanna, both released in 2010, became the rapper's third and fourth number one songs on the Hot 100; the latter also reached the top of various national charts worldwide. In June 2014, RIAA certified his song \\"Not Afraid\\" Diamond thus making Eminem the first artist with two digital Diamond awards by RIAA. In August 2013, Eminem released the single \\"Berzerk\\" which debuted number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and preceded his eighth studio album The Marshall Mathers LP 2. The album produced the singles \\"Survival\\", which was showcased during the Call of Duty: Ghosts reveal trailer, \\"Rap God\\", and \\"The Monster\\" featuring Rihanna. \\"The Monster\\" became Eminem's fifth No.1 single on the Hot 100, tying him with rappers Ludacris and P. Diddy for rappers with the most No.1 singles in the USA. In May 2014, Eminem was announced as the most streamed artist of all time on Spotify. As of November 2010, Eminem has four songs that have sold over three million downloads in the United States. Eminem has sold more than 42 million track downloads in the United States alone. == As lead artist == { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" border=\\"1\\" + ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:20em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:1em;\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"10\\" Peak chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:14em;\\" Certifications ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Album - !style=\\"width:3em; font-size:90%\\"US !style=\\"width:3em; font-size:90%\\"AUS Peak chart positions for singles in Australia: * All except noted: * \\"Old Time's Sake\\": * \\"Space Bound\\": * \\"Forever\\": * \\"Drop the World\\": * \\"Headlights\\": * \\"Detroit Vs.

Produced by Ekta Kapoor, the film was theatrically released in India on 26 July 2019. ==Plot== Bobby is a strange wealthy young woman living alone in Mumbai and working as a dubbing artist. In childhood, she had interfered in a fight between her parents, causing them to fall off the terrace to their deaths. When a producer touches her at work, she reacts by slicing his nose with a knife. She is then sent to an asylum. Her uncle manages her property and offers her house as a rental to a young married couple. Keshav is the husband to Reema. Bobby is obsessed with the couple and spies and stalks them constantly. Reema dies in a fire in the kitchen when a bottle of pesticide explodes. Bobby suspects Keshav and tries to get the police to investigate him but they find no evidence. She hallucinates Keshav threatening her and hits him with a chair in front of the police. She is put back in the asylum. It is revealed that she is imagining things; during electric shock treatment, she remembers that she threw the pesticide on the wife because she hallucinated a cockroach on her. Two years later, Bobby is taking her meds but not leaving her house. Her cousin in London arranges for Bobby to be an understudy in a re-imagining of the Ramayana that she is helping design. When Bobby meets her cousin's new husband, it turns out to be Keshav. Keshav warns his wife that Bobby is not stable but his wife does not believe him. Bobby starts to lose herself in the character of Sita that she is understudying. She believes Keshav is Raavan and it is up to her to defeat him. Keshav panics and reaches out to her old boyfriend, Varun, who confirms that she obsesses over things and had imagined him to be a criminal. He breaks into her house and finds boxes of photos with Bobby photoshopped in instead of Keshav's wife. A photo of Keshav's wedding to her cousin proves that Bobby knew beforehand that they were married. Keshav confronts Bobby. The next morning, he tells his wife that Bobby tried to kiss him, and she in turn tells his wife that he tried to rape her. When she later sees Keshav backstage, she grabs an ax and chases him, cutting a rope that sends a light falling. Afraid she has hurt someone, she goes on the run and gains three hallucinatory friends. They take her to a library, where she researches Keshav and thinks she has found evidence that he is a serial killer who takes on new identities and kills his wives. She returns to the house to confront him, dressed as Sita, ties up her pregnant cousin and when Keshav arrives, threatens him. Keshav tries to reason with her before revealing that he IS indeed a serial killer. He even killed his first wife, throwing the match on her after Bobby covered her in pesticide. Bobby fights him and she and her cousin are both saved when Keshav is burnt alive in the same manner in which his victims burned to death. At the end, she strides down the street in London surrounded by her hallucinations proudly declaring that she is what she is and will not change. ==Cast== *Rajkummar Rao as Keshav Kumar *Kangana Ranaut as Bobby Grewal *Jimmy Shergill as Shridhar Awasthi * Amyra Dastur as Reema Kumar (nee Agnihotri) * Amrita Puri as Megha Kumar *Kanika Dhillon as Sita * Brijendra Kala as Officer Ram Pandey * Satish Kaushik as Officer Durjan Deshmukh *Lalit Behl as Uncle *Hussain Dalal as Varun Bahl == Production  Filming === Principal photography of the film began on 16 May 2018, in Mumbai.

George while lyrics are written by Prakhar Varunendra, Kumaar, Tanishk Bagchi, Raja Kumari and Prakahar Vihaan. Background music scored by Daniel B George. ==Marketing and release== On 4 March 2018, producer Ekta Kapoor revealed the first two posters of the film on Twitter, each depicting the two leads - a cross-eyed Ranaut and Rao holding up his middle fingers to his eyes; Kapoor hinted at the theme of mental instability by captioning, \\"It's time to bring out the crazy in you... Because Sanity is overrated!\\" In an interview, writer Kanika Dhillon called the film a \\"quirky thriller\\" On 5 March, Balaji Motion Pictures released two more first look posters, depicting both lead characters at crime scenes. The following day, 6 March, another two posters for the film were released, with leads Kangana Ranaut and Rajkummar Rao posing in \\"quirky\\" and dangerous positions- a knife-wielding Ranaut in a water-filled bathtub surrounded by electronic gadgets at its edge, and Rao holding a butcher knife and cutting an apple, with blood seeping from his hand. On 11 October 2018, the producers released a new poster, a composite of the original two posters of a cross-eyed Ranaut and Rao holding up his middle fingers, to reveal the film's release date. Release date of the film is changed to 21 June 2019. Rao announced the new date on his Twitter account along with new poster of the film. The release date was further extended to 26 July 2019 on 7 May 2019 by Balaji Motion Pictures. The film promotions were also wrapped in controversy as the lead actress, Kangana Ranaut, apparently questioned a journalist for his personal remarks about her and also Rani of Jhansi. The incident took an uglier turn as the Entertainment Journalists' Guild of India decided to boycott Kangana Ranaut until she issued an unconditional apology. The producer of the film Ekta Kapoor issued an unconditional apology on behalf of her. In June 2019, the film's title was changed to Judgementall Hai Kya due to objections from Indian Psychiatric Society (IPS) which filed a complaint to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) claiming that the original title, Mental Hai Kya, trivialises mental health issues. The film has been certified with a runtime of 116 minutes by British Board of Film Classification and was released on 26 July 2019. == Reception  Critical response === On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 62% based on thirteen reviews, with an average rating of 6.67/10. Sreeparna Sengupta of The Times of India gave the film 3.5/5 stars, found Kovelamudi's narrative style as 'quirky and edgy'. Praising performance of Kangana Ranaut, termed it as \\"brilliant\\", as for Rajkummar Rao she felt that he fitted into 'his slightly macho, edgy persona like a glove'. Concluding she opines, \\"Judgementall Hai Kya keeps the element of suspense alive all the way till the end, as it pushes the envelope as a dark, psychological whodunit, with a social message weaved in that can’t be ignored.\\" Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost gave the film 2.5/5 stars, found the plot to be confusing and stated that the makers have done very poor research on mental health. The movie, at certain points, makes fun of issues that require serious attention. Psychological disorders are a concern and such toxic take can only push people back. The performances are great, especially that of Rajkumar Rao, who unfortunately is caught in between a poor script. Kangana's performance is also decent but she could have done better. Raja Sen of Hindustan Times gave 4/5 stars and felt that the slick, snappy looking comedy has more to offer, as a 'smart, significant satire'. Praising the performances he said, \\"This is a finely acted film, with superb performances from Amrita Puri, Satish Kaushik and Jimmy Sheirgill, not to mention Rao, but it rests entirely on Ranaut’s shoulders and she delivers both vitality and credibility.\\" Concluding he recommended to watch the film as 'carrying homilies on placards' and opined, \\"It is a film about malicious misdirection, and the validity of our narratives — especially those labelled incorrect. It’s okay to jump at a cockroach even if you’re the only one who sees it. A bug can be a feature.\\" Gaurang Chauhan of Times Now rating the film with 3/5 stars terms it as 'one of its kind film', praising the performances of lead of Ranaut and Rao and supporting cast of Hussain Dalal, Satish Kaushik and Brijendra Kala says, \\" This movie belongs to [Ranaut] and she simply nails it.\\" In conclusion, he opines, \\"Do give this one a try for its uniqueness, eccentricity, jaw-dropping moments, technical brilliance and Kangana Ranaut and Rajkummar Rao's phenomenal performances. Watch it.\\" Rajeev Masand of CNN- IBN stated, \\"While you admire the attempt at originality, you can’t help feeling frustrated at just how it all comes apart in the end.\\" He praised the performances, and termed Ranaut as solid. But, he felt that the film fell short of greatness because of a muddled script and gave 2.5/5 stars. ===Box office=== According to the Bollywood Hungama opening day collection of the film is 4.20 crore and the second day collection is 7 crore, whereas third day collection is 7.70 crore.

The array uses a combination of telephoto lenses to observe extragalactic objects. Its main purpose is to take images of ultra-low surface brightness galaxies at visible wavelengths of light. It is well suited for this purpose because its lenses have specially-coated optical glass that reduces scattered light. The telescope was designed by Roberto Abraham of the University of Toronto and Pieter van Dokkum of Yale University. It was commissioned in 2013 and initially had eight commercially available Canon EF 400mm f/2.8L IS II USM camera lenses. This was first increased to ten lenses, and was extended to two clusters of 24 lenses in 2016. The array is designed to accommodate the addition of lenses to increase its effective aperture with each additional lens. With 48 lenses, the instrument has the light gathering power equivalent to a 99 cm diameter refractor, with a focal length of 40 cm. Astronomers used the Dragonfly Telephoto Array to discover Dragonfly 44, a galaxy that is roughly as massive as the Milky Way, with 99.9% of its mass composed of dark matter. At the other end of the scale it was also used to discover NGC 1052-DF2 which measurements with other instruments initially suggested was a galaxy with very little dark matter. Further work indicated that NGC 1052-DF2 was closer to the earth than previous thought.

The planet was first discovered by the Kepler space telescope during its K2 “Second Light” mission and later observed by the HARPS-N spectrograph. It is classified as an Ultra- short Period (USP) and is confirmed to be terrestrial in nature. Its high density implies a massive iron core taking up between 30% and 50% of the planet's total mass. ==CharacteristicsMass, radius, and temperature=== Like the majority of known exoplanets, K2-141b was detected using the transit method, where a planet blocks a tiny fraction of its star's light as it passed between our line of the sight and its host. This method is only able to determine the radius of the planet, not its mass. However, K2-141b was also detected by the radial velocity method using the HARPS-N spectrograph. Therefore, its mass could also be determined along with its radius. The planet is classified as a Super-Earth, being significantly larger and more massive than Earth but not as large as the ice giants Uranus and Neptune. K2-141b has a radius of 1.51 , below the 1.6 threshold where most planets are expected to accumulate thick hydrogen and helium atmospheres, transforming them into Mini- Neptunes. The planet's mass confirms that it is rocky. It has a mass of 5.08 , which gives K2-141b a high density of 8.2 g/cm3, about 1.48 times the density of Earth. This high density implies a composition with a large iron core taking up about 30% to 50% of the planet's total mass. Despite its terrestrial nature, K2-141b is far from habitable. Its extremely close proximity to its host star has resulted in an equilibrium temperature of about . However, the actual temperature is probably much higher. The secondary eclipses of K2-141b indicate a dayside temperature of around , with a bond albedo no greater than 0.37, or a geometric albedo of about 0.30. Further observations are needed to distinguish between the two scenarios. ===Orbit=== K2-141b has one of the shortest known orbital periods of any confirmed exoplanet. One orbit takes just 0.28 days to complete – a mere 6.7 hours. Only a few planets, including those around Kepler-70, have shorter orbital periods. At this proximity, K2-141b is most likely tidally locked with its host star. It has a semi-major axis of 0.0074 AU, just 0.74% the distance between Earth and the Sun. ===Host star=== K2-141 is an orange main sequence star about 61 parsecs away in K2 Campaign 12, within the constellation Aquarius. It has a radius of 0.681 and a mass of 0.708 . It has a temperature of 4599 K and is between 1.6 and 12.9 billion years old. For comparison, the Sun has a temperature of 5778 K and is 4.5 billion years old. ==See also== *COROT-7b *Kepler-10b *Kepler-78b *WASP-47e ==References== Category:Exoplanets discovered by K2 Category:Exoplanets discovered in 2018 Category:Super-Earths Category:Pisces (constellation) ","title":"K2-141b"},{"id":"56758201","text":"Barrientosiimonas is a genus of bacteria from the family of Dermacoccaceae. ==References Further reading == * * * Category:Actinobacteria Category:Bacteria genera ","title":"Barrientosiimonas"},{"id":"56758202","text":"Andrzej Czarniak (11 November 1931 - 23 February 1985) was a Polish alpine skier.

Her father Szulim was a communist. In 1939, before World War II began, he had left to the USSR working as an activist and German teacher. He prepared an accommodation and intended to bring his family, but Stella's mother- Haya- was against leaving the country. In her diaries, Stella often emphasized with Polish patriotism of her mother, a common reason of conflict between her parents. Ultimately, their move to the USSR was thwarted by the German Invasion of Poland and train blockade by Wehrmacht. In December 1939 Stella's mother decided to move to the USSR because of the increasing anti-Semitic repressions. Both of them managed to get to border village of Sarnaki upon the Bug river. They got through to Łosice looking for shelter, where Stella's uncle was an inn-keeper before the War. Stella was placed in Łosice Ghetto at the age of 15. She was able to escape it during its liquidation on August 22, 1942. Majority of Jews from Łosice Ghetto, including Stella's mother, were killed in Treblinka. Stella survived the war hidden by more than twenty Polish families from Łosice and surrounding villages. She was baptized after World War II. She took her school leaving exam and in August 1948 she became a Carmelite Sister. She spent 24 years in the nunnery. In 1969 she moved to Israel after experiencing anti-Semitic prejudices even in religious community. She stayed in Haifa. She was expelled from the Carmelite nunnery for leaving. Then she became a nurse in a residential home. She helped a lot of Poles in finding a job, when large numbers of Polish emigrants shown in Haifa (what is confirmed by multiple statements). Nowadays, Stella is helping drug addicts, the homeless and ill, despite her advanced age. She is also an activist in organization \\"Women in Black\\" uniting Israeli and Palestinian women. Stella Zylbersztajn-Tzur is still Catholic, what she emphasizes in many interviews in Poland. == Credits == Stella contributed to awarding of 23 Poles that helped her during the war with title Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem.

It is a member of the family Gonatidae. It is an abundant species which is currently caught mainly as a bycatch by fishing boats targeting other quarry. It is an important prey species for many commercially important species of fish, as well as for marine mammals. ==Description== Gonatopsis borealis is a medium-sized squid. There are three morphs: large bodied, slender bodied and small bodied; these may be separate taxa, but this needs more research. The main characteristics which distinguish this species from closely related species are that it has transverse rows of seven teeth on its radula, rather short blunt-tipped arms which have four rows of suckers near their tips, and a muscular mantle. The muscular arms are 40-45% of the mantle length and some are longer than others, arms III have well developed aboral keels. Arms I to III have 2 middle series of hooks and 2 marginal series of suckers; arm IV has no hooks and four series of suckers. The development of hooks on the arms does not occur until the animal reaches a mantle length of 35 to 45 mm. There is no hectocotylus. The lose their tentacles at the paralarva stage. They have large eyes and a nuchal crest which has four longitudinal nuchal folds of skin on either side of it. The muscular mantle is cylindrical and tapers to a blunt posterior. The muscular fins are short (40 to 45% of the mantle length), wide (65 to 80% of mantle length) and rhomboid in shape. There is no tail. The skin on the mantle is dark reddish or purplish brown in colour and there are no photophores. Mature males grow to a mantle length of 270mm ML while mature females reach mantle lengths of 330mm. The paralarvae are distinguished by the pattern of chromatophores on the dorsal part of the head. This consists of three transverse rows of chromatophores with a single chromatophore in the front row, two in the middle row and three in the rear row. They also have 6-10 chromatophores in the dorsal surface of the mantle. ==Distribution== Gonatopsis borealis is found in the North Pacific Ocean, where its range extends from northern Japan at a latitude of roughly 37°N to 40°N through the Okhotsk Sea, Bering Sea all along the Aleutian Islands into the Gulf of Alaska, south along the western coast of North America to California, even reaching Baja California at a latitude of 20°N. The type specimen was taken off Hokkaido, some east of Kushiro. ==Habitat and biology== Gonatopsis borealis is an oceanic speciesand it is one of the most widely distributed and abundant species of the family Gonatidae. It can be found in cold temperate waters, where it can occur from the surface to the mesopelagic zone, even reaching into the bathypelagic zone. It undertakes a diel vertical migration, moving up the water column at night, and for forming very large aggregations between the Spring and the early autumn, especially in both the eastern and western parts of its range. The abundance of G. borealis is indicated by it accounting for up to 68% of squid catches in the Okhotsk Sea during the summer months. G. borealis is found in epipelagic, mesopelagic and bathypelagic depths from the surface to 1500m. It has a benthic habit at 200 to 1 375m, but it is most numerous in the midwater realm, with maximum abundance occurring at 300 to 500m, while only a few single specimens are caught below 1000 m (probably having been caught at much shallower depths while the open nets were retrieved through their zone of most abundance). Off California there were no specimens of any age recorded during the day at depth of less than 300m, and 90% of specimens collected during daylight were from 400 to 700m. By contrast, specimens occurred mainly at 100 to 500m, principally 300 to 400m at night. Smaller animals undertook the diel migration to the surface layers earlier than the larger ones. They also returned to depths sooner, possibly a behavioural adaptation to avoid the larger cannibalistic adults. This species preys on a diverse variety of pelagic crustaceans such as euphausiids, hyperiid amphipods and copepods, as well as fishes and other squid. They live for at least a year. Their predators include fish such as salmonids, walleye Pollock, pomfret, albacore and grenadiers, as well as the larger squid Berryteuthis magister and cannibalistic G. borealis. Other predators include seabirds, seals, sea lions, dolphins and toothed whales, such as sperm whale and pilot whales. ==Fisheries== Gonatopsis borealis is an abundant species. In the Sea of Ohotsk in the summer months there is estimated to be a biomass of this species ranging from 278,000 tonnes to 500,000 tonnes, with estimates of 209,000 tonnes in the western Bering Sea, 285,000 tonnes off the western Kamchatka coast, and 100,000 tonnes in waters around the Kuril Islands. The large morph of this species form the major part of any catch. It is caught as bycatch with jigs, and substantial numbers are caught in drift gillnets which are set to take salmonids and the neon flying squid (Ommastrephes bartramii). The meat of this species is said to be highly palatable, and as it is an abundant species it is thought to have a high potential to support fisheries. However, it is the principal prey for many of valuable species of fish, and this ecological role is perhaps more important to local fisheries than any development of a fishery to target this species. ==Taxonomy== Gonatopsis borealis differs from other members of the genus Gonatopsis in having seven rather than five rows of teeth on the radula. Kir Nesis proposed that it be placed in its own subgenus Boreoteuthis. Subsequently, this has been treated by some authorities as a separate genus. The generic status of G. borealis is yet to resolved, as is the taxonomic status of the three size morphs which have been recorded. In the Asiatic part of its range, two distinct populations are found, a more northerly population which matures at less than 180mm mantle length, and a more southern population found south of latitude 45°N to 47°N, which reached sexual maturity at larger than 220mm mantle length. The two populations are found sympatrically in the waters off the Kuril Islands. ==References== Category:Squid Category:Molluscs described in 1923 ","title":"Gonatopsis borealis"},{"id":"56758249","text":"Miran Savnik is a male former international table tennis player from Yugoslavia. ==Table tennis career== He won the golden medal in the Cadets category - individuals- at the European Youth Championship held in Vejle, Denmark in 1972.

It is based on the events related to Kelo v. City of New London, a U.S. Supreme Court case in which Kelo unsuccessfully sued the city of New London, Connecticut, for its controversial use of eminent domain. ==Plot== A small-town paramedic named Susette Kelo emerges as the reluctant leader of her working-class neighbors in their struggle to save their homes from political and corporate interests bent on seizing the land and handing it over to Pfizer Corporation. Ambitious academic Dr. Charlotte Wells, president of the fictional \\"Walthrop College\\" (in real life, Connecticut College President Claire Gaudiani) persuades the current governor (John G.

UKIE was originally founded as the European Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), and then later Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), before changing to UKIE in 2010. ==History== The association was founded in 1989, though then named as the European Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA). Around 2002, the organisation changed its name to Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association, reflecting that their primary concerns were video game development on the United Kingdom islands and not mainland Europe. In March 2010, members of the ELSPA voted to rename the association as UKIE, reflecting \\"the evolving and expanding nature of the industry, which the association exists to represent, and to encompass the new areas of activity that will be undertaken\\". The name was fully changed by September 2010. In 2011, UKIE proposed a merger with The Independent Game Developers' Association (TIGA), a UK trade association for video game developers, to consolidate the two organisations under one trade body to represent the entire UK games industry. However TIGA's board rejected the proposal. TIGA's stance remained unchanged when a merger proposal was raised once again in 2013. ==Activities== UKIE's primary goal is to represent the UK's video game industry, and as of December 2017, represented over 395 video game companies worldwide. The association provides strategy and advice for developers and publishers, collects and publishes retail date for UK video game sales, and lobbies and meets with members of the government to help establish policy related to video games. One of its more notable activities was to help petition the UK government to use the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) rating system rather than the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC). Prior to 2012, video games were exempted from being required to be rated by BBFC, unless they contained sexual content, nudity, or violence, though developers and publishers could voluntarily submit their works for review. Works that exceeded certain ratings could not be legally sold to minors. The ELSPA worked with the Video Standards Council (VSC), a government organization that was created to form a code of practice for how to inform consumers about content ratings in games and other video formats. ELSPA had recommended that as an industry standard, any game not needing classification by BBFC to be otherwise classified under the PEGI system, with the VSC helping to determine appropriating ratings. In March 2008, Dr. Tanya Byron published a report commissioned by Prime Minister Gordon Brown, colloquially called the Byron Review, describing potentially harmful effects of video games on children, a debate over how to better label video games arose, and recommended that parents need to be given more information than the BBFC's rating alone. ELSPA along with other concerned groups believed that the BBFC lacked the clarity needed for video game ratings; current CEO Mike Rawlinson also said that the BBFC ratings were developed for linear content, while PEGI's were better reflective of interactive content such as video games. In 2008, ELSPA started a large push to getting PEGI as the approved system, while in the interim petitioning the BBFC to color-code its ratings labels to approach the same color-coding used by PEGI. The UK Parliament passed the Digital Economy Act 2010 into law, and required by July 2012 to transfer the rating of video games from BBFC to the VSC (outside of games that contain strong pornographic content) and officially adapting the PEGI rating system, along with legal enforcement of selling mature titles to minors. The associate continued to work with the VSC to help establish how the PEGI rating should be displayed on packaging and other materials, and provide awareness to consumers and parents of the new change. UKIE has campaigned and lobbied for the availability of tax relief for the UK games sector for many years. In 2012, they offered recommendations to the government consultations based on responses and opinions from over 200 video games companies in the country. A tax incentive scheme was scheduled to be included in the March 2010 United Kingdom budget by the outgoing Labour government, however it was not finalised and introduced until 2014 when the European Commission approved the decision. The tax relief scheme allows video games developers and companies to claim back up to 20% of their production costs if the project meets certain conditions, resulting in an estimated £188 million per year for the UK games industry. In 2017, the European Commission granted an extension to the scheme for another six years until 2023. ==ReferencesSee also== * The Entertainment Software Association, a similar organisation for the North American video game markets. ==External links== * Category:Information technology organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Trade associations based in the United Kingdom Category:Video game organizations Category:Organizations established in 1989 Category:Video game trade associations ","title":"The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment"},{"id":"56758503","text":"Oleg Tamarin (1937-2005) was a Russian composer and violinist.

It is the type species of the newly erected genus Paulasterias, the only other member of the genus being Paulasterias mcclaini. ==History== Paulasterias tyleri was discovered during a deep sea research cruise organized by the National Oceanography Centre. It was the first starfish to be found living as part of a hydrothermal vent community and was not closely related to any known starfish species so that it was placed in a new family. Its nearest living relative lives in the Ross Sea on the other side of the Antarctic continent some two thousand miles away. ==Description== Paulasterias tyleri is a seven-armed starfish and is whitish or pale pink. It has a thick fleshy skin on the aboral (upper) surface, with spongy tissue underneath it. The skin is rough, bein clad with short spines. ==Distribution== Paulasterias tyleri is found at thermal vents in the East Scotia Ridge to the east of the southern tip of South America where the depth is about . ==Ecology== Starfish are unable to cope with the hot, sulphurous, toxic environment of the hydrothermal vent itself but they are present in the cooler, cleaner water nearby. Hoff crabs live adjacent to the hydrothermal vent chimneys, with gastropod molluscs and then goose barnacles occupying zones further out. Beyond this is an assemblage dominated by sea anemones, and it is on these and on the goose barnacles that the starfish probably feed. Other members of the community surrounding the vents include limpets in the genus Eclipidrilus and sea spiders in the genus Sericosura. However absent from these vents are the giant tube worms (Riftia pachyptila) which dominate other hydrothermal vents. ==References== Category:Asteroidea Category:Animals described in 2015 ","title":"Paulasterias tyleri"},{"id":"56758559","text":"Jón Karl Sigurðsson (born 11 April 1932) is an Icelandic alpine skier.

Trut and domestic Fox-1974 The domesticated silver fox is a form of the silver fox which has been domesticated - to some extent - under laboratory conditions. The silver fox is a melanistic form of the wild red fox. Domesticated silver foxes are the result of an experiment which was designed to demonstrate the power of selective breeding to transform species, as described by Charles Darwin in On the Origin of Species. The experiment explored whether selection for behaviour rather than morphology may have been the process that had produced dogs from wolves, by recording the changes in foxes when in each generation only the most tame foxes were allowed to breed.

Skunk cabbage (Symplocarpus foetidus) grows in the area. In 1835, several Concord entrepreneurs bought the property, the Ballard Haselton farm, in order to raise silk worms, and planted mulberry trees on the land. The silk farm failed after a few years, though the name is preserved in the road that runs past the entrance to the forest. The land was later bought by David Morgan and Mark Upton, who transferred it to the State of New Hampshire in 1917 for the use of the State Asylum.

Widdecke received the Navy Cross, the United States military's second-highest decoration awarded for valor in combat, for his actions during the Recapture of Guam in July 1944. He later commanded the 1st Marine Division at the end of Vietnam War. ==Early years and World War II== Charles F. Widdecke was born on May 11, 1919, in Bryan, Texas, the son of Henry A. Widdecke and his wife Josephine Baker. He attended high school in Dallas in 1937 and then graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in June 1941 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. While at university, Widdecke was named a Phi Beta Kappa and also enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve in May 1941. After graduation, Widdecke attended the Officer Candidate School at the Marine Corps School in Quantico. After completing his courses he was commissioned in the Marine Corps Reserve as a second lieutenant on November 1, 1941. He was then ordered to the Reserve Officer Course, also at Quantico. While he was on this course, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Widdecke then served as a recruiting officer in San Antonio, Texas, until April 1942, when he joined the 2nd Raider Battalion at San Diego under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Evans Carlson. He was also integrated in the regular Marine Corps during that time. With the activation of 22nd Marine Regiment under Colonel John T. Walker, Widdecke was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant and appointed commander of Headquarters Company of 1st Battalion. His unit subsequently sailed to Samoa, in the South Pacific, at the end of June 1942 and served as a jungle training unit until February 1944. During that time, Widdecke was promoted to captain and was appointed commander of 1st Battalion's Company C. The 22nd Marines were ordered to take part in the assault on Eniwetok Atoll on February 22 and Widdecke led his company ashore on Parry Island under heavy enemy mortar and machine gun fire. With his men, he participated in a headlong attack against the entrenched Japanese. For his gallantry in action, Widdecke was decorated with the Silver Star and also received the Navy Unit Commendation. After the battle, Widdecke and his regiment were ordered to Guadalcanal for rest and further training in April 1944. The 22nd Marines were now attached to the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade under Brigadier General Lemuel C. Shepherd. The 1st Brigade received orders to take part in the assault on Guam in July 1944. The regiment landed on Guam on July 21 as the left flank of the invasion force. Widdecke and his men secured a position on the beach in the face of strong opposition and prepared for the attack against the fanatic Japanese holding Orote Peninsula and its strategic airfield. Under his leadership, his company sustained the momentum of the subsequent attacks despite the bitterness of the action and the many casualties sustained by his Marines. With his company's advance disrupted by heavy machine-gun, rifle, artillery and mortar barrages, on July 25, Widdecke organized his men led them in a charge through heavy fire. The Japanese position was captured although Widdecke was himself seriously wounded. Widdecke was decorated with the Navy Cross, the second highest decoration in bravery and was ordered to the field hospital. His wounds required special treatment and he was evacuated to the United States for further hospitalization in September 1944. He remained in the Naval Hospital in San Diego until March 1945. ==Postwar career== After recovering from his wounds, for which he received a Purple Heart, Widdecke was promoted to the rank of major. He was subsequently attached to the Division of Reserve at Headquarters Marine Corps. He served under Major General William T. Clement until February 1948, when he was sent to Quantico to attend the Junior Course at Marine Corps School. On completing the course in August 1948, he sailed for Guam, where he was appointed assistant chief of staff for personnel within 1st Provisional Marine Brigade under Brigadier General Edward A. Craig. In April 1949, Widdecke was posted to Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, also at Guam, as assistant chief of staff for personnel. In June 1950, Widdecke was ordered back to the United States and appointed an instructor in the Tactical Operations Group, Marine Corps Educational Center, at Quantico. While in this capacity, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel in November 1951. Widdecke remained at Quantico and served as an instructor in the Tactics section, Senior Course from July 1952 to August 1953. This assignment ended, when he was ordered to the Army Command and Staff College at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas for regular courses. Widdecke graduated in June 1954 and immediately left for Korea, where he assumed command of the 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, 1st Marine Division. However, the armistice was already in effect and he took part only in the defense of Korean Demilitarized Zone. In January 1955, he was appointed commander of the Headquarters Battalion, 1st Marine Division. Two months later, he returned with the division to Camp Pendleton. His next duties brought him to Washington, D.C., in July 1955, when he was appointed assistant director of Marine Corps Institute and commanding officer of the institute's detachment. Widdecke remained in this capacity only until January 1956, when he was chosen by Commandant Randolph M. Pate as his Aide-de-Camp. He left Washington in July 1958 and returned to San Diego, where he assumed duties as the commanding officer of the 1st Recruit Training Battalion at Marine Corps Recruit Depot. Widdecke served later as executive officer of Recruit Training Command there and was promoted to the rank of colonel in July 1960. He left California in August 1961 in order to attend Army War College at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania. He graduated in June 1962 and also attended off-duty educational courses at George Washington University in order to complete a Master of Arts degree in International Affairs. He was then ordered to Panama and spent the next three years as head of the military assistance, plans and policy, Joint Staff of United States Southern Command under General Andrew P. O'Meara. During his time there, Widdecke was engaged in the administration of military and economic aid to South American countries and received the Joint Service Commendation Medal for this service. ==Vietnam War== Lieutenant General James W. Sutherland, center, commander of XXIV Corps, looks out from FSB Ryder with Colonel Edmund G. Derning, Jr., left, commander 7th Marines, and Major General Charles F. Widdecke, commander of the 1st Marine Division In August 1965, Widdecke assumed command of the 5th Marine Regiment at Camp Pendleton and supervised its deployment to Okinawa, Japan in early 1966. The 5th Marines were stationed in Japan until the end of May of that year, when Widdecke led them to Da Nang in South Vietnam. During July 1966, the commanding general of 1st Marine Division, Lewis J. Fields, planned and ordered Operation Colorado. The main objective of this search and destroy operation was to locate and destroy units of the 2nd North Vietnamese Division in the Quảng Nam Province. He later acted as chief of staff, Task Force X-Ray under Brigadier General William A. Stiles in the Chu Lai area and took part in combat with Vietcong and North Vietnamese troops. Widdecke served in Vietnam until the end of December 1966 and received the Legion of Merit with \\"V\\" Device and the Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Bronze Star for his service in Vietnam. Widdecke was posted to Honolulu, Hawaii, and appointed chief of staff, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific under Lieutenant General Victor H. Krulak. While in this capacity, Widdecke was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. In September 1968, Widdecke was transferred to the Headquarters Marine Corps in Washington, D.C. and relieved Major General Clifford B. Drake as director of Marine Corps Reserve. During his tenure, he was responsible for the administration of all reserve marine troops, which were used as reinforcements for combat units in Vietnam. He was also promoted to the rank of major general on August 7, 1969, and received his second Legion of Merit for his service in this capacity. However Widdecke was ordered back to Vietnam in April 1970, when the commander of 1st Marine Division, Edwin B. Wheeler, suffered serious injuries in a helicopter crash. Widdecke was appointed his substitute. Widdecke oversaw Operation Imperial Lake during September of that year with the task of destroying North Vietnamese troops in Que Son. During that operation the Son Thang massacre occurred, which has been referred to as the \\"Marine Corps My Lai.\\" Controversy arose when Widdecke reduced the sentences of the two convicted Marines from five years and life imprisonment respectively to one year of prison. He later led Operation Catawba Falls against communist forces in the same region. Following the operations in Quảng Nam Province in the fall-winter period of 1970, Widdecke began preparing 1st Marine Division for redeployment to the United States. The 1st Marine Division arrived at Camp Pendleton on April 30, 1971, where it was welcomed by President Richard Nixon and a crowd of 15,000 spectators. Following the President's speech, Widdecke turned over the command to Brigadier General Ross T. Dwyer and personally assumed command of I Marine Amphibious Force, which controlled Marine air and ground units on the West Coast. For his second tour of duty in Vietnam, Widdecke was decorated with Navy Distinguished Service Medal and several decorations from the Government of South Vietnam. Widdecke retired from the Marine Corps on July 1, 1971, after 30 years of military service. He died on May 13, 1973, while on a trip to La Paz, Mexico, only two days after his 54th birthday. He was survived by his wife and a brother, Henry August Widdecke Jr. who served in the United States Navy. ==Decorations== Here is the ribbon of General Widdecke: { - colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" -     -     -     -     - } {  - !1st Row colspan=\\"5\\" align=\\"center\\" Navy Cross colspan=\\"6\\" align=\\"center\\" Navy Distinguished Service Medal colspan=\\"5\\" align=\\"center\\" Silver Star - !2nd Row colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" Legion of Merit with Combat \\"V\\" and one \\" Gold Star colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" Joint Service Commendation Medal colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" Purple Heart colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" Navy Unit Commendation with one star - !3rd Row colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" American Defense Service Medal colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" American Campaign Medal colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with two 3/16 inch service stars colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" World War II Victory Medal - !4th Row colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" National Defense Service Medal with one star colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" Korean Service Medal colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" Vietnam Service Medal with four 3/16 inch service stars colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" National Order of Vietnam, Knight - !5th Row colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" Vietnam Distinguished Service Order, 1st Class colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Bronze Star colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" United Nations Korea Medal colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" Vietnam Campaign Medal } ==See also== *Recapture of Guam *1st Marine Division *List of 1st Marine Division Commanders ==References== : Category:1919 births Category:1973 deaths Category:People from Bryan, Texas Category:University of Texas at Austin alumni Category:Elliott School of International Affairs alumni Category:United States Army Command and General Staff College alumni Category:United States Army War College alumni Category:United States Marine Corps generals Category:American Marine Corps personnel of World War II Category:American Marine Corps personnel of the Korean War Category:United States Marine Corps personnel of the Vietnam War Category:Recipients of the Navy Cross (United States) Category:Recipients of the Navy Distinguished Service Medal Category:Recipients of the Silver Star Category:Recipients of the Legion of Merit Category:Recipients of the National Order of Vietnam Category:Recipients of the Gallantry Cross (Vietnam) Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Service Order (Vietnam) ","title":"Charles F.

Pinky Sharon Kekana is the Deputy Minister of Communications in South Africa. ==Life== Pinky Sharon Kekana is a South African politician, the current Deputy Minister of Communications, and the Secretary General of the Pan African Women’s Organisation (PAWO). She hails from Bela-Bela, located in the Limpopo Province. Her first job was as a secondary school teacher at Bela-Bela High School, after completing her Bachelor of Arts in Education and Teaching. It was her experiences as a high school teacher, that fueled her passion for South Africa's youth, education and her commitment to improving opportunities for young South Africans, from all walks of life. It was her interest in politics though, that led her to the African National Congress (ANC). She was elected to the Provincial legislature in 1999 and later re-elected in 2009. She has also served as: the Executive Mayor of the Waterberg District; the MEC of Limpopo Roads and Transport as well as MEC for Economic Development, Environment and Tourism. In 2014, she was elected as a Member of Parliament. In her role as a Member of Parliament, Kekana has been a part of a number of committees most notably the Standing Committee on Finance and the Ad Hoc Committee on the Filling of Vacancies in the Commission for Gender Equality. In 2015 she was elected into the National Executive Committee of the ANC Women's League and its National Working Committee. She was subsequently appointed as the Women's League Chairperson on International Relations and The Pan African Women’s Organisation (PAWO). In December 2017, she was elected by the ANC branches into the National Executive Committee, and in this capacity, she serves on several sub-committees of the ANC. In March 2018 she was appointed as the Deputy Minister of Communications by President Cyril Ramaphosa. In this role, Kekana recognises the vital importance of bridging the digital divide between people living, working and travelling in remote parts of the country with metropolitan cities. As South Africa moves rapidly towards the large-scale adoption of digitisation and the use of cutting-edge technology, through the current era of the 4th industrial revolution that is upon us, she believes that rural South Africans should have access to the same technological advantages to live, work, and play, as their city-dwelling counterparts. Her passion for connectivity and connection for the betterment of society, is known throughout her administration. Of all her roles, the only thing that she is more passionate about, than technology, is her commitment and absolute dedication to increasing the profile of women on the African continent through initiatives that promote women and equality broadly. As the Secretary-General of PAWO, she drives the agenda of African women on the continent, ensuring that more women can have access to opportunities that will benefit them and their local communities. Her long- term vision is to ensure that everyone, particularly women and girls, know a world where ‘women-firsts’ are no longer a precursor to any statement. ==See also== *African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights *Politics in South Africa *Provincial governments of South Africa ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Government ministers of South Africa ","title":"Pinky Kekana"},{"id":"56758994","text":"Whinney is a surname, and may refer to: * Bob Whinney (1909–1992), Royal Navy officer * Margaret Whinney (1897–1975), English art historian * Michael Whinney (1930–2017), Church of England bishop * Thomas Bostock Whinney (1860–1926), English architect ","title":"Whinney"},{"id":"56758995","text":"The 2018 Michelin Le Mans Cup was the 3rd season of the Michelin Le Mans Cup.

In 1933, he founded the Sentinel, an African-American newspaper in Los Angeles. He quickly built a reputation as an activist among the Black community in Los Angeles.

Washington also published reports to shed light on the discrimination and racism against African-Americans in Los Angeles. By 1974, it had a circulation of 50,000. ==Personal life and death== Washington married Ruth Brumell, a photographer.

He married Elizabeth de Windt, Vicomte Campt de Rastignac, daughter of John de Windt, in Paris, in 1821, and they had one child: Elizabeth Sarah Johnson (1825–1870). After Elizabeth's death in 1842, he remarried to Joanna Burn Smeeton in 1849, but she died five years later in 1854. Willes-Johnson again remarried in 1858, this time to Margaret Ann Pugh, daughter of David Pugh and Ann née Vaughan, and they had one child: Maud Felicia Frances Ann Johnson (1862–1919). ==Naval career== Entering the navy in 1807, Willes-Johnson became a first class volunteer serving on the Vestal under Captain Edwards Lloyd Graham for two years at Home and Newfoundland stations. Becoming a master's mate in 1809, he was then placed in charge of the merchantman Fortitude, deploying the ship at Lisbon and Cadiz. During his travels, he succeeded in a ruse de guerre, causing an enemy's armed vessel to sheer off despite not possessing a gun on board on the ship. Willes-Johnson then returned to England, where his arrival was received for three months on the Port Mahon sloop captained by Villiers Francis Hatton. In August 1810, he returned to the seas with Graham on the Pallas, heading for the coast of Norway where he aided in the capture of four Danish privateers and several merchantmen. Willes-Johnson and Graham then sailed together on the Southampton and Alcmène, the latter of which he went on to the Adriatic Sea where he was involved in a number of boat affairs. One such occasion in 1812 included capturing a Franco-Venetian trabaccolo, including four guns and 30 men, near Lessina Island after a conflict in which many of the enemy's crew were killed, while just four British were slain. Leaving the Alcmène in 1813, he joined the Pylades sloop with Captain James Erskine Wemyss, before he then became acting-Lieutenant of the Caledonia bearing the flag of the late Lord Exmouth. Willes-Johnson then went on half-pay in 1814, before returning to full pay in 1815. After this he sailed with the Boyne, visiting Naples, Marseille and the Barbary States, and Queen Charlotte, on which he participated in the bombardment of Algiers. He then had a short further period of half-pay, before being nominated in 1817 to be Flag-Lieutenant to the Impregnable at Plymouth where he remained until promoted to Commander in 1821. Then, in 1835, he joined Her Majesty's Coastguard for 3 years; and in 1841, he commanded the Wolverine on its voyage to China where he arrived towards the end of the First Opium War. Retiring from active service in 1842, he was made Captain Post in 1847, and a little Captain before retiring altogether in 1847. ==Writing== Willes-Johnson also wrote at least one literary work — A Journal of a Tour through parts of France, Italy and Switzerland, in the years 1823-4 — published in 1827. ==Political career== Willes-Johnson was elected MP for Montgomery at a by-election in 1861, caused by the death of David Pugh, and held the seat until his own death in 1863. ==References * Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for Welsh constituencies Category:UK MPs 1859–1865 Category:1793 births Category:1863 deaths Category:Royal Navy officers ","title":"John Willes-Johnson"},{"id":"56759546","text":"Ntime Skhosana is the current spokesperson for the current Deputy Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, Thabang Makwetla. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Ntime Skhosana"},{"id":"56759558","text":"Chris Nolan (born 1998) is an Irish hurler who plays as a left corner-forward for the Carlow senior team.

D. Sears, and Olga Grey. It was released on May 8, 1915. ==Plot== Success admonishing Might, with Evil (left) and Justice (background) In a prologue, the mythical figure of Ambition seeks to attain the position currently held by Success. Success has reached the pinnacle of his desire, and sits looking over his kingdom. Having achieved his success, Success decides to take a break and goes off with Pleasure, leaving Might in control of the land. Might, under the influence of Evil, along with Might's wife Extravagance, as well as by his daughter Vanity, begins to abuse the land's occupants, including Toil, Age, Strength, Innocence, Happiness, and Ambition. Spurred on by Evil, who says that Justice is blind and cannot see what he is doing, Might whips the laborers. However Justice is not blind, and she learns of the situation, informing Success, who returns and sets the situation right again. The first riot The final confrontation In current time, Nathaniel Crosby (who is the embodiment of Success in the prologue) is the sole owner of a prosperous factory. After receiving a letter from his general manager telling him that he needs to take a vacation, and can trust him to take care of things while he is away, he decides to take a holiday. Leaving his general manager, Sampson Rhodes (the personification of Might) in charge, he starts out on an extended pleasure trip. Rhodes is influenced by his wife (the personification of Extravagance) and Genevieve, his daughter (the personification of Vanity), to take advantage of his position to increase their wealth and social position. Rhodes lowers the workers' wages, so he can take a bigger cut of the profits. The workers retaliate by going on strike, and the police are called in to protect the plant. Tom Burke (the embodiment of Ambition) can no longer financially support his ill mother since he is striking. Neither can he go through with plans to marry David Lee's (the embodiment of Contentment), the foreman's, older daughter Happiness. Lee, along with several other laborers, become more and more discontent as the strike continues, and they eventually turn the strike into a riot. In the first assault several of the workers, as well as one of the policemen, are killed. As the violence continues to escalate, Rhodes realizes that it has gone beyond the abilities of the police to handle, and calls in the militia to put down the riot. However Rhodes secretary, Ruth Farwell (the embodiment of Justice), tracks down Crosby and tells him of the situation. When he is reticent to return, telling her that Rhodes can handle the situation, she explodes at him, letting him know that over a dozen have been killed in the riots and that their blood will be on his head. She then runs from the room, dropping one of her gloves. Rhodes returns to the plant in order to defuse the situation, but when Ruth recognizes him as he approaches the factory, the rioters turn their ire on him, beginning to beat him. Ruth, along with Burke, manage to get him away from the crowd and into a nearby boarding house. Recovering from his daze, he asks Ruth what is happening, she simply points out the window, where they can see the mob approaching the militia, which is standing in a line, weapons at the ready. They have been given the authority by Rhodes to fire on the crowd if necessary to protect the factory. Crosby rushes out of the room, followed by Ruth. In the ruckus which follows, Ruth is shot when she steps in front of a bullet meant for Crosby, fired by Lee. Crosby ends the riot by telling them men to come back to work at their prior wages, which is what they wanted. The militia is dismissed, and Crosby fires Rhodes. With the plant returned to its former status, Crosby goes to visit Ruth in the hospital where she has been convalescing. She assures him that she can return to work soon, telling him that she's been practicing her shorthand, showing him her pad and pencil. He asks her to take a letter for him, thanking someone for opening his eyes, and asking her to marry him. When Ruth asks him to whom she should address the letter, he takes out the glove she left behind when she came to tell him of the riots, and says simply, \\"To the owner of this glove\\". ==Cast list== * Arthur Paget as Evil * Charles Lee as Age * Otto Lincoln as Toil * Robert Edeson as Nathaniel Crosby, the Absentee/Success * A. D. Sears as Sampson Rhodes/Might * George Andre Beranger as Tom Burke/Ambition * Augustus Carney as David Lee/Contentment * Loretta Blake as Happiness * Mildred Harris as Innocence * Wahnetta Hanson as Genevieve Rhodes/Vanity * Olga Grey as Ruth Farwell/Justice ==Production== In early April 1915 it was announced that Cabanne was working on allegorical film titled The Absentee which he also co-wrote with Frank E. Woods. At one point during filming, Robert Edeson forgot that he was acting and broke up a mob during filming. However, the script had called for the mob to turn him back, so the scene had to be re-shot. Cabanne had completed filming by April 1915. On May 1, it was announced that the film would be released that week, on May 3. ==Reception== Variety gave the film a lukewarm review. They lauded Cabanne's direction as well as the script and plot, especially the mob scenes. However, they felt the movie was too slow, stating \\"... the film lags until the final reel.\\" The Saturday Evening Post gave the film a positive review, saying \\"It gives you a mental Turkish bath, then rubs your conscience down with a rough towel. It's a great picture to see. Full of very beautiful scenes —– interspersed with some that have prongs in them.\\" Motion Picture News gave the picture an overall favorable review, although they felt the epilogue in which all the resolutions are shown was too long. They particularly enjoyed the allegorical prologue, then projected into the main story: \\"Yet this knowledge furnished to the onlooker is by no means a dampener to his interest. It is most attractive to watch the development of the main plot after seeing the same characters in the allegorical prologue. It is fascinating to see the similarity of the abstract and the specific, as conceived by the authors and to note the truth of both versions of the themes.\\" Motography gave the film a positive review, being particularly impressed with the cinematography. Moving Picture World also gave the film a positive review, enjoying the symbolism employed by the allegory, although they did voice displeasure in the decision to have Evil as a real person, instead of simply a presence. They praised the teamwork of Woods and Cabanne, and gave good reviews to the entire cast, highlighting the work of Edeson and Gray. ==Notes== At least one source, Picture-Play Weekly, had notes different character names. They have John Marxham instead of Nathaniel Crosby; Alma Ward instead of Ruth Farwell; Robert Thornley instead of Sampson Rhodes; and Tom Carrol instead of David Lee. ==References External links == * * * Category:Films directed by Christy Cabanne Category:Mutual Film films Category:American silent feature films Category:American films Category:Films with screenplays by Frank E.

() is a 1989 Soviet two-part television children's musical film directed by Leonid Nechayev, based on the play of the same name by Georgy Polonsky, which in turn is loosely based on the fairy tale of William Thackeray The Rose and the Ring. ==Plot== The action takes place in the fairy- tale kingdom of Abidonia. Sixteen years ago King Henry II and Queen Emma, who ruled there, perished, and since then King Theodore, a former cavalry colonel, a great connoisseur and lover of horses, and his wife Flora have been presiding over the throne. Essentially, the country is ruled by Chancellor Count Daville and his wife Ottilia, the queen's sister. Their efforts in the country suppress any dissent. The daughter of the royal couple, Princess Albina, dreams of marrying a foreign prince and finally breaking out of the monotonous palace life, where her only company is the silent poet Patrick, who lost his parents as a child and was adopted by the queen. Patrick is in love with Albina and does not attempt to hide it, the girl does not take him seriously because of ignoble origins and dumbness. In turn, maid Marcella is in love with Patrick, but he is too preoccupied with his feelings for Albina. Penapia, Crown Prince of the neighboring kingdom of Penagonia arrives to Abidonia. It is obvious to everyone that the purpose of the visit is matchmaking. But the prince is followed by a string of failures: on his way to Abidonia, his motorcade falls into a predatory ambush, the guards surrender or run away, and the prince nearly dies. He is rescued by the wandering puppeteers Jacques and Martha. Jacques' father, Jean-Jacques Freckles, a friend of Henry II, the late King of Abidonia, under the rule of Theodore was exiled to the island of Tibia, where he died. Before expulsion Jean-Jacques managed to bury his props, and now Jacques and Martha dug up the chest with dolls belonging to Freckles. Penapia persuades rescuers to take him to the court of the Abidonian monarch, promising to ask the king for artists permission to perform in the kingdom. Upon arrival in the capital, the company is immediately seized by the police. Prince Penapia succeeds in getting interrogated by the king, whom the prince tells of the stallion Milorde which was stolen by bandits (it was to be given to Theodora if the matchmaking was successful). The king, a lover of horses, recognizes Penapia and accepts him at court. However, the king comes across a trunk from the cart of artists. Recognizing familiar dolls, which caricatured him and the chancellor, the king orders to cast the artists in the dungeon, and commands Marcella to covertly burn the props. Patrick finds Marcella and they do not have the heart to burn the dolls. They carry the chest to Patrick's room and there they find a dried blue rose in it. According to legend, the fragrance of the blue rose made anyone who breathed it speak the truth. Marcella puts the flower in a vase of water, in the hope that the rose will come to life. Meanwhile, a dinner begins in the palace in honor of the guest from Penagonia. Marcella brings the blue rose to the hall - the long-dried flower has suddenly revived. Moreover, the old fairy tale comes true - no one who smells the rose's fragrance can lie. Immediately strange things start to happen: Marcella confesses Patrick in love and rebukes Albina for callousness, Patrick is healed of dumbness, and King Theodore publicly admits that the Guards, led by Colonel Udilak, found the robbers who had stolen Milord, and took the magnificent horse that he now considers his property. Colonel Udilak comes to the king with an unheard-of request: he asks to release artists from prison, so that they can amuse the Guards who are celebrating the finding of Milord. Chancellor Daville, the only one who was not affected by the rose (because of a terrible allergic rhinitis that attacked him that day) is rushing about trying to maintain the status quo. He tries to reason with Udilak, threatens him, but neither Udilak nor guardsmen are afraid of the threatening chancellor anymore and ignore his orders. In the city, an uprising begins. Meanwhile, Theodore and Ottilia tell Queen Flora and Albina against their will that sixteen years ago King Henry II and Queen Emma were killed as a result of the conspiracy of Theodore, the Chancellor and Ottilia. Albina learns that Patrick is a prince, son of Henry and Emma. After learning the truth about the death of her sister and her husband, Queen Flora takes off her crown and leaves. Albina accuses the Chancellor and his accomplices that they tore Patrick away from her, immediately expressing the intention to marry her cousin. The Chancellor wants to stop the departing Albina, but the king stops him. Theodore, breathing in a magical fragrance, confesses that he does not want any power or honor, he regrets that he lost his family and dreams of a simple life. Jacques, Martha, Patrick, Penapia, Marcella and Albina return to the palace. Finally, the chancellor discovers the reason for the veracity which overcame everyone in the palace - Marcella tells him about the rose. In the last attempt to return everything back the chancellor shoots at the flower, but hits Marcella instead. Realizing that the game is lost, the chancellor commits suicide. It's clear to all that Marcella is mortally wounded. The prince sings her last song about hope, all present listen with tears in her eyes. Suddenly, Penapia's face expresses amazement: the rose on Marcella's breast gradually turns from blue to red. ==Cast== *Lidiya Fedoseyeva-Shukshina as Queen Flora *Vyacheslav Nevinny as King Theodore *Varvara Vladimirova as Princess Albina (voiced by Olga Mashnaya, vocals by Natalia Ostrovaya) *Igor Krasavin as Patrick (voice and vocals by Anatoly Tukish) *Svetlana Selezneva as Marcella, maid (vocals by Natalia Ostrovaya) *Regina Razuma as Ottilia, the wife of Count Daville (voiced by Larisa Udovichenko, vocals by Natalia Ostrovaya) *Albert Filozov as Count Daville, Chancellor *Artem Tynkasov as Prince Penapia *Elena Antonova as Martha Freckle (voiced by Elena Tsyplakova) *Vladimir Stavitsky as Jacques Freckle (voiced by Boris Shuvalov) *Anatoly Rudakov as Colonel Odilak (voiced by Viktor Bortsov) *Yuri Baginyan as Bald Footman (voiced by Leonid Nechayev) *Alexander Denisov as Ataman (vocals by Pavel Babakov) *Valentin Bukin as Tavern Owner (voiced by Mikhail Kokshenov) *Alexander Zanko as Hippocrates, Tavern Owner's son *Victoria Yablonskaya as Nika, a little girl ==References Category:Soviet films Category:Soviet fantasy films Category:Soviet musical films Category:1980s fantasy films Category:1980s musical films Category:Soviet television films Category:Films based on works by William Makepeace Thackeray Category:Russian children's fantasy films Category:1980s children's fantasy films Category:Films directed by Leonid Nechayev Category:Films set in a fictional country ","title":"Don't Leave..."},{"id":"56759697","text":"Daniel Turner (born July 22, 1983, Portsmouth, Virginia) is an American artist based in New York City. His media include sculpture, photography, video and drawing. == Early life and work == Daniel Turner studied painting and printmaking at Norfolk State University and received a B.F.A. from San Francisco Art Institute. Turner worked in construction and demolition before being employed as a security guard at The New Museum in New York City. He was hospitalized several times for psychosis resulting in an action titled, Burning an Entire Body of Work (2006) in which he burned all previous paintings to date. Turner now works primarily in sculpture often involving the creation or transformation of materials, objects and environments into architectural or ephemeral forms. His sculptures are often characterized by a specific response to site under a controlled set of processes. These elements are present in works where an entire waiting room is cast into a series of solid bars, a former psychiatric facility burnished to a darkened stain against a wall, or a cafeteria dissolved across the expanse of a floor. In 2017, Daniel Turner completed EMP Step a site responsive sculpture for the restaurant Eleven Madison Park, in New York City. The contents of the restaurant's kitchen were melted down and cast into a monolithic step that sits at the entrance of the restaurant. == Awards == * The Future Generation Art Prize Award, (shortlist) 2019. * The Pollock-Krasner Foundation Award 2018–2019. *The Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Fellowship Award 2009. *The Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Fellowship Award 2005. * The Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Fellowship Award 2004. == Residencies and teaching == Turner has participated in artist residencies including Hauser & Wirth, Bruton, England, Le Confort Moderne, Poitiers, France, Chinati Foundation, Marfa, Texas, and The Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, New York, NY.

It consists of at least eight separate plutons, the largest of which is the Main Donegal Granite. It was intruded at a late stage in the Caledonian orogeny about 400 million years ago (Ma). ==Extent and geometry== The Donegal batholith extends for about 75 km in a SW-NE direction from just west of the small town of Ardara to Fanad Head. The NW-SE extent is more difficult to determine as much of the Thorr and Fanad plutons lie offshore. ==Formation== The Donegal batholith was formed during the Early Devonian, towards the end of the Caledonian orogeny between about 418 and 397 Ma. It is interpreted to have been intruded along a major SW-NE trending sinistral shear zone. The space to allow the intrusion of such large volumes of granitic magma into the crust is thought to be a result of movement along the shear zone combined with the sinistral strike-slip reactivation of a major SSW-NNE trending fault, running approximately through the centres of the Ardara, Trawenagh Bay, Rosses and Thorr plutons. The chemistry and timing of the granites does not suggest that they are subduction-related. Subduction is thought to have ceased by the end of the Silurian (~419 Ma) and there is no evidence of significant involvement of mid-ocean ridge basalt or asthenosphere sources for the granitic melts. Break-off of the subducting slab following the end of subduction would lead to the upwelling of hot asthenosphere, causing melting of the overlying lithosphere producing lamprophyric magmas, underplating and injecting into the crust. The granitic magmas may be a result of either partially melting the lamprophyric underplate or by differentiation from the lamprophyric magmas. Further upwelling would lead to an increase degree of melting within the crust, contributing to a decrease in the amount of mantle component in the granitic melts. This is consistent with an overall change from more basic to more acidic with time observed in the plutons and a reduction of Barium and Strontium. ==Plutons== The batholith is made of at least eight separate granitic plutons. ===Main Donegal Granite=== This is the largest of the plutons, extending for 44 km and about 10 km across. Three main phases of intrusion are evident. The first phase is a fine-grained granodiorite, which was emplaced into the Dalradian country rock, followed by sheeted tonalites intruded into both the Dalradian and the granodiorite. These early phases were followed by the emplacement of a large volume of porphyritic monzogranites at a time when the granodiorite and tonalite had cooled sufficiently to fracture. ===Trawenagh Bay=== This pluton lies at the southwestern end of the Main Donegal granite. Three distinct types of granite are recognised, an outer biotite monzogranite inside which there is a body of biotite-muscovite monzogranite and in the centre is an aplitic biotite- muscovite microgranite. The intrusion is interpreted to have the form of a laccolith. The main part of the pluton shows only weak evidence of deformation. Studies of the anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility (AMS) have found evidence of consistent west-east linear fabrics, interpreted to result from westward flow of the magma into the Trawenagh Bay pluton from the Main Donegal granite. ===Thorr=== The Thorr pluton is one of the largest bodies in the batholith, covering an area of about 800 km2, although its precise extent is unknown as a major part of it lies offshore. ===Ardara=== The Ardara pluton has an almost circular outcrop apart from being elongated to towards the east. Most of the outer parts of the intrusion are made of a coarse-grained monzodiorite. Going into the centre of the pluton the next unit is a tonalite-granodiorite, with megacrysts. The central part is a coarse- grained granodiorite. ===Rosses=== The roughly circular Rosses pluton also has a concentric plan with an outer unit of medium-grained granite. Inwards this is followed over most of the outcrop by a coarser-grained granite, although it is not present to the south. Occupying most of the centre of the intrusion is a finer-grained granite, locally with the development of a small body of muscovite-rich granite. ===Barnesmore=== This pluton lies well to the south of other parts of the batholith and is not that well studied, partly due to a lack of exposure. Three main units have been identified, one of granodiorite and two of granite. The Barnesmore pluton is relatively enriched in Uranium and Thorium compared to other parts of the batholith. Locally the original biotite monzogranite is strongly altered to a rock with a syenite mineralogy, lacking in quartz, due to metasomatism. The intrusion has been dated as 397±7 Ma using Rb-Sr dating. ===Fanad=== The Fanad pluton is made up of three separate bodies, with a significant part of its extent being offshore. The main rock types are quartz monzodiorite and granodiorite. The intrusion has been dated as 402±10 Ma using Rb-Sr dating. ===Toories=== This pluton is only known from a few exposures of quartz monzodiorite and monzotonalite on islands off the Donegal coast and has been little studied. No radiometric dating has been carried out on this granite, although field relationships suggest that it postdates the Thorr pluton and was intruded before the Rosses pluton. It appears to have a similar internal structure to the Ardara pluton, suggesting it is another example of forceful intrusion. ==References== Category:Batholiths of Europe Category:Geography of County Donegal Category:Geology of Ireland Category:Devonian magmatism ","title":"Donegal batholith"},{"id":"56759768","text":"Filip Šnejdr (born 16 April 1995) is a Czech middle-distance runner specialising in the 800 metres.

It consisted of the non-profit education arm, EcoMom Alliance, and an affiliated e-commerce startup company co-founded by Jenny Orser and Chris de Tournay Birkhan. Its head offices were originally located in San Francisco before moving to Santa Monica. After an acquisition by Jody Sherman, and disagreements in management style, Pinkson was forced out and the company and the headquarters moved to Las Vegas. In 2011, the company's sales exceeded $1 million USD. However, due to several factors, including the suicide of Jody Sherman, and the company's low profit margins due to excessive discounting, Ecomom shut down in early 2013. Etailz Inc., formerly GreenCupboards, an e-commerce site specializing in environmentally friendly brands, acquired Ecomom in the same year. The website of Ecomom reopened in the early summer of 2013. ==Reasons for failure== Ecomom adopted a deep discounting policy which offered customers fifty-percent discount. As a result, Ecomom lost money every time it sold products because half the price was lower than the cost price. In addition, Ecomom did not limit these discounts, so repeat customers could take advantage of the 50% discount when shopping. Ecomom spent excessively on marketing its products, for example, the expenditure for search engine marketing was not proportional to the return of investment. Ecomom's management did not understand that the abuse of the offered discount would have a negative impact on the company when developing new audiences and markets. In addition to the low profit margins, Ecomom faced issues with investors. Rather than source income from a professional venture capitalist, Sherman received money in small chunks from wealthy individuals. This allowed him to run the business largely independently. However, due to the relative small stake of these investors in the company, none of them had a strong incentive to get closely involved and make the company a success. This further hurt Ecomom's viability as a business. ==References== Category:Online retailers of the United States Category:Internet properties established in 2007 ","title":"Ecomom"},{"id":"56759831","text":"Boyd in 2009 Sweet Caress: The Many Lives of Amory Clay is a novel by William Boyd, published by Bloomsbury in 2015. A fictional autobiography supposedly written by a woman, Amory Clay, born in 1908, it includes extracts from her diary, written on a Hebridean island in 1977, with flashbacks from her career as a photographer in London, Scotland, France, Germany, the United States, Mexico and Vietnam. The book also includes more than 70 photographs, collected by Boyd, most of which are attributed to her. Boyd describes it as a \\"whole life novel\\" in that it tells the story of the book's main character \\"from cradle to grave\\", a technique he also employed in The New Confessions (1987) and Any Human Heart (2002). The book is dedicated to Boyd's wife, Susan. ==Plot== Amory Clay lives alone in a cottage on a Scottish island where, in 1977, she is writing a journal about her life and career. Born in 1908, she is the eldest of three children in a middle-class family in Sussex. She excels academically at boarding school and was encouraged by her teacher to go to Somerville College, Oxford, but performs badly in her exams after her father, traumatised by his military experiences in the First World War, tries to commit suicide and to kill her as well. Apprenticed to her uncle, she works as a society photographer in London but then seeks more excitement in Berlin, where she frequents the underworld and takes photographs that, when she exhibits them in England, are viewed as scandalous. An American magazine offers her a job and she moves to New York, where she has affairs with her American boss and with a French diplomat who is also a writer. Back in London, where she runs an office for the American magazine, she covers a demonstration by Oswald Mosley’s fascists, in which she is attacked and badly injured. After spending the early part of the Second World War in New York, she returns to Europe as a war photographer covering the D-Day landings and accompanies Allied Forces as they sweep through France and Germany. She meets and marries a British officer, Sholto Farr, who is also a Scottish lord, and – unexpectedly, as she had thought the injuries she had received from Mosley's supporters had made her infertile – gives birth to twin daughters. Like her own father, her husband is haunted by memories of war. He drinks heavily, gambles, and loses much of the family fortune, before dying of a heart attack. Living in reduced circumstances, Amory returns to photography, seeks excitement as a Vietnam War photographer, then travels to California to search for one of her daughters, who has joined a hippy colony and religious sect, and with whom she is eventually reconciled. Looking back on her life and career, and in increasingly poor health, the 69-year-old Amory contemplates taking her own life. ==Publishing history and adaptations== Sweet Caress was published by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and the United States in hardback in 2015 and in paperback in 2016. It was published in Canada by HarperCollins in 2015. A French language edition, Les vies multiples d’Amory Clay, translated by Isabelle Perrin, was published by Éditions du Seuil in October 2015. A German language version, Die Fotografin: Die vielen Leben der Amory Clay, was published in Berlin in 2016 by Belletristik, in a translation by Patricia Klobusiczky and Ulrike Thiesmeyer. Barbara Flynn An unabridged audiobook version, narrated by Jilly Bond and lasting 15 hours and 9 minutes, was released in the United Kingdom by Whole Story AudioBooks in September 2015 and in Australia by W F Howes in October 2015. An unabridged audiobook version, narrated by Susan Lyons and lasting 15 hours and 44 minutes, was released in the United States by Recorded Books in September 2015. Abridged by Sara Davies and read by Barbara Flynn, Sweet Caress was serialised on BBC Radio 4's Book at Bedtime in 2015. ==Reception== Reviewing the book in The Observer, Elizabeth Day said that it \\"blends history and fiction to fine effect... Amory’s fictional voice never wavers. She can be tricky, contradictory and impulsive, but this only serves to emphasise her realness. She emerges from this novel as a rounded, complex, infernally beguiling human being... [Boyd] delights in blending artifice with naturalism – the text is punctuated by photos supposedly taken by Amory and by the occasional portrait, sufficiently blurred to remain just anonymous enough. Even the title of the book is taken from an invented quote lifted from a hypothetical novel written by one of the fictional characters. But the cleverness never overwhelms the narrative. Sweet Caress is an audacious, sweeping, rich layer cake of a novel, at once a textual hall of mirrors and a brilliant tale of a life well lived\\". \\"For William Boyd's war-photographer heroine, life is a series of accidents\\", according to Caroline Moore in her review of Sweet Caress for The Spectator. \\"Boyd’s representation of a certain sort of female voice is pitch-perfect\\" she said and \\"[f]or those who appreciate a novel in which emotional life is sensed at the edges of what is said, this is a masterly portrait. And the final chapters, in which Amory tries, with typical courage, to take ultimate control of her life, and then finds further courage to recognise the limitations of control, are superbly written and desperately moving\\". Justin Cartwright, also for The Observer, said that \\"Sweet Caress is a compendious and intelligent work, made authentic by Boyd’s extensive use of real dispatches and evocative photographs and his familiarity with makes of camera\\". Mary Hoffman, reviewing the book for The Independent, described it as \\"an utterly compelling read and Boyd's best novel since Restless\\". She concluded: \\"The effect of Amory is that of an interesting woman with a life well-lived, who is not content to sit back and be beautiful as an adored wife or mistress. She grasps every opportunity with both hands, wherever it leads her. Not a bad epitaph, and a tribute to Boyd's skill that we miss her like a friend when we, and she, reach the end\\". Trish Halpin, editor-in-chief of Marie Claire, described Boyd's novel as \\"[r]iveting – I’m sure this will be my book of the year\\". Geir Darge, for The Student, called Sweet Caress \\"bold and enthralling, humorous and heart- breaking\\". He said: \\"The reader cannot help but live alongside Amory from the tragedies of her younger years to the pensive isolation of her later life. His latest novel is yet more proof that Boyd has a gift for creating a perfect novel\\". Madeleine Keane, reviewing the book in the Irish Independent, said: \\"One of the great strengths of Sweet Caress is Amory – a complex character who, though not always likeable, is frequently admirable, not least in her desire to lead an interesting life\\". She recalled that \\"Boyd once said how he tried 'to make fiction seem so real you forget it's fiction'\\" and said that, in her view, \\"He mostly succeeds\\". She concluded: \\"Amory's gay uncle Greville invents a game (the early sections are pure Mitford), in which people are described in four adjectives. Sweet Caress is, like most of this writer's impressive body of work, vivid, poignant, compulsive and entertaining\\". Jon Michaud, writing in The Washington Post, was more critical, saying that \\"for all its surface drama and intrigue, 'Sweet Caress' remains a resolutely bland book, and Amory Clay’s life story never amounts to more than a string of diverting anecdotes, like a series of stories polished over countless retellings at parties. Boyd’s decision to go for panoramic sweep rather than detailed close-up often results in an unsatisfying cursoriness... A running gag between Amory and her uncle is that everyone can be summed up in four adjectives. Applying that notion to 'Sweet Caress,' I’d say, breezy, overlong, superficial and disappointing\\". ==Controversy== In the chapter on Amory Clay's experiences as a war photographer in the Vietnam War, she meets British soldiers who are operating undercover as Australians. Boyd said in 2017 that although he believed that the Ministry of Defence still denied it, he thought that \\"it is pretty much established now that British forces were fighting in Vietnam, disguised in the late 60s early 70s\\". ==References * Official website * Boyd answers questions from Foyles about Sweet Caress * Mudge, Alden: William Boyd, Photo op for the 20th century – BookPage interview, September 2015 * William Boyd talks about writing and about Sweet Caress in Richard and Judy Book Club podcast, Summer 2016 Category:2015 British novels Category:Bloomsbury Publishing books Category:Fictional diaries Category:Fiction set in 1977 Category:HarperCollins books Category:Novels about photographers Category:Novels by William Boyd (writer) Category:Novels set in Berlin Category:Novels set in California Category:Novels set in London Category:Novels set in Mexico Category:Novels set in New York City Category:Novels set in Paris Category:Novels set in Scotland Category:Novels set in Sussex Category:Novels set during the Vietnam War Category:Novels set during World War II ","title":"Sweet Caress"},{"id":"56759845","text":"The Howard-Dickinson House was built in 1855 and is located at 501 South Main in Henderson, Texas. This house was the first brick home built in Rusk County, Texas and is in the Italianate architecture style. In 1968, the Howard- Dickinson House was presented a Texas Historical Medallion and was recorded as a Texas Historic Landmark. Howard-Dickinson House, Henderson, TX James Logan Howard and Dave P. Howard, two brothers from Virginia, built the home and lived there for 50 years. Dave Howard, his wife Martha, their 9 children, and Dave’s bachelor brother Logan Howard lived in the house. At that time, the Howard brothers were well-known brick makers and carpenters in Henderson. They manufactured the bricks at the back of the house, and many of the houses still standing in Henderson were built from these Sam Houston, the first president of the Republic of Texas, was a frequent visitor to the house. He was a cousin to Martha Howard. Houston’s campaign trunk is displayed in the house. Mrs. Katie Dickinson purchased the home in 1905 and the Dickinson family lived there for about 50 years. During this time, they added the two-story wing located in the rear of the home. This section of the home was used in the 1930s as a boarding house for workers during the East Texas Oil Boom. By the 1960s the house was in need of repair and was given by the then owner, businessman Homer Bryce, to the Rusk County Heritage Association, a group formed to save the house. In 1967, after much fund-raising and restoration work, the house was restored and opened to the public as a living museum and meeting place for special events. Ghost tours are also given in the home. ==References== Category:Houses in Rusk County, Texas ","title":"Howard-Dickinson House"},{"id":"56759865","text":"The women's 5000 metres at the 2017 Asian Winter Games was held on February 22, 2017 in Obihiro, Japan. ==Schedule== All times are Japan Standard Time (UTC+09:00) {class = \\"\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! width=220Date ! width=50Time ! width=100Event -  Wednesday, 22 February 2017  14:45  bgcolor=ffffccFinal } == Records Results== { class=  !width=40Rank !width=40Pair !width=250Athlete !width=80Time !width=50Notes - 3 align=left  7:12.58  - 3align=left7:15.94 -  2 align=left  7:16.24  - 44 align=left  7:23.21  - 54 align=left  7:28.09  - 62 align=left  7:37.90 - 71align=left7:56.60 } ==References *Results Women 5000 ","title":"Speed skating at the 2017 Asian Winter Games – Women's 5000 metres"},{"id":"56759867","text":"Sam Nunberg (born June 21, 1981) is an American public affairs consultant based in Manhattan. He was a political advisor to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. In March 2018, Nunberg was subpoenaed by a grand jury for testimony and documents relating to the Special Counsel's Russia investigation. ==Early life and education== Nunberg was born to a Jewish family; his mother was a corporate attorney at Wachtell, Lipton and his father was a real estate attorney who worked with Trump attorney Gerald Schrager. He attended the Ramaz School an independent co-educational Modern Orthodox Jewish prep school in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. He graduated with a BA in History, with a senior thesis titled Re-Analyzing the Historiography of the Effects of Dollar Diplomacy, from McGill University in 2004, where he competed globally with the McGill Debating Union.https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-nunberg-78250617b He attended Touro Law Center on Long Island, New York, from 2007 to 2009, graduating in 2009, and was admitted to the New York state bar in 2013. ==Career== While volunteering for the Mitt Romney 2008 presidential campaign, Nunberg met and was recruited by attorney Jay Sekulow to volunteer at the American Center for Law & Justice in an attempt to stop the construction of the Park51 mosque. While volunteering there he met political operative Roger Stone, whom he has described as his mentor and \\"surrogate father\\". Nunberg began working for Trump, as a political and public affairs consultant, in 2011, after Trump decided not to run for president in 2012. Nunberg assisted in the writing of Trump's 2011 speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference. In February 2014 Nunberg was fired by Trump after he arranged a BuzzFeed interview that ended up being highly critical of Trump; the headline was \\"36 Hours on The Fake Campaign Trail with Donald Trump.\\" Nunberg was rehired in April 2014 and was Trump's first full time hire for the Donald Trump for President 2016 Campaign; he was let go in December for undisclosed reasons. In February 2015 he was once again rehired by Trump, as a communications adviser for the Trump campaign, but was let go, shortly thereafter, by then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Nunberg was rehired for a fourth time by the campaign in April 2015; between then and the beginning of July he was paid $85,139 by the campaign. Nunberg, along with Stone, helped prepare Trump for the first Republican debate, on August 6, 2015. Nunberg left the campaign in August, 2015 after continued tensions with Lewandowski. In March 2016 Nunberg endorsed Senator Ted Cruz for president, saying that Trump \\"does not have a coherent political ideology.\\" In July 2016 Trump sued Nunberg for $10 million, accusing Nunberg of violating a confidentiality agreement by leaking information to the New York Post. In a legal response, Nunberg said that Trump might have illegally funneled corporate money into the campaign. Trump and Nunberg settled their legal dispute in August 2016. ==March 2018 subpoena and media appearances== Mueller investigation On March 5, 2018, Nunberg spoke to multiple cable news outlets and newspaper reporters without the knowledge of his attorney. He said he had been subpoened by a grand jury to testify and provide documents relating to Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, including all his email exchanges with Donald Trump, Roger Stone, and eight other people. He insisted he did not intend to comply with the subpoena, saying \\"Let him (Mueller) arrest me!\\" He also had in-person interviews with CNN's Jake Tapper and Erin Burnett and MSNBC's Katy Tur and Ari Melber. He later backtracked, saying that he would cooperate fully with the subpoena, while expressing frustration at the large amount of documentation requested. On March 9, 2018 Nunberg testified before a federal grand jury for more than six hours, saying it was his, \\"duty as an American, whether I like it or not.\\" Regarding the Mueller investigation, when asked whether he believed that the special counsel may have something on Trump, Nunberg said, \\"I think they may.\\" He added: \\"I think that he may have done something during the election. But I don't know that for sure.\\" He also said \\"I have no knowledge or involvement in Russian collusion or any other inappropriate act\\" and that: \\"Donald Trump won this election on his own. He campaigned his ass off. And there is nobody who hates him more than me.\\" Regarding Trump's former foreign-policy advisor Carter Page, Nunberg said that he believed that Page did collude with the Russians.\\" ==See also== *Tax returns of Donald Trump ==References== Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:American Jews Category:Trump administration personnel Category:Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign Category:People associated with the 2016 United States presidential election Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Ramaz School alumni Category:McGill University alumni Category:Touro Law Center alumni Category:New York (state) Republicans ","title":"Sam Nunberg"},{"id":"56759869","text":"Christiaan Loedolff Fismer (born 30 September 1956) was the Deputy Minister of General Affairs and Deputy Minister of Justice under South African President Nelson Mandela, from 1994/5 to 1999. ==See also== *African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights *Constitution of South Africa *History of the African National Congress *Politics in South Africa *Provincial governments of South Africa ==References== Category:Justice ministers of South Africa Category:Nelson Mandela Category:Living people Category:1956 births ","title":"Chris Fismer"},{"id":"56759926","text":"Category D can refer to: * Category D pregnancy - Positive evidence of risk * Category D Prison * Category D, for an International Driving Permit * Category D village * Category D stations (DfT) ","title":"Category D"},{"id":"56759932","text":"Cornelius House may refer to: ;In the United States *Cock-Cornelius House, Locust Valley, New York *Cornelius House (Mooresville, North Carolina) *Benjamin Cornelius Jr. House, Forest Grove, Oregon *Stratton–Cornelius House, Portland, Oregon *Charles and Theresa Cornelius House, Neillsville, Wisconsin ","title":"Cornelius House"},{"id":"56759941","text":"Jonathan Sacoor (born 1 September 1999) is a Belgian sprinter specialising in the 400 metres.

At 11, he was spotted by Sporting CP while playing for a local team, but left a year later due to tiredness from the long journeys to Lisbon, and to concentrate on his education. After becoming national champion with Rio Maior, Reabciuk was invited to train with C.F. Os Belenenses in June 2015, having impressed in a match against them. He then moved to FC Porto in a similar circumstance in July 2016, where he signed his first professional contract of four years in 2017. On 26 November 2017, Reabciuk made his professional debut for FC Porto B in LigaPro, at home to Associação Académica de Coimbra. He played the first 67 minutes of the 2–1 defeat before being substituted for Musa Yahaya. The following 4 February, he scored a late winner as the team came from behind to beat neighbouring Leixões S.C. 2–1 also at the Estádio Dr. Jorge Sampaio. By 18 March, when he netted his fourth goal in ten appearances with one in a 3–0 home win over S.C. Covilhã, he was the team's top scorer for the season.

According to the introduction of \\"Comprehensive Study of the Kinki Region,\\" a publication of the National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics (NINJAL), titled \\"Subgroupings of the Kinki Dialects\\", the Awaji Dialect straddles the Central (typified by the pronunciation of the mora /se/ as [ɕe], use of the copula =ja, a distinction between the perfect and progressive aspects, and a migration of the monograde verb classes to the quadrigrade class) and Western Kansai dialect regions. The dialect shares many features with the dialects of the cities of Osaka, Kobe, and Wakayama, which is shares the Osaka Bay with, as well as with that of Tokushima Prefecture, which exercised control (as Awa Province) over Awaji Island during the feudal period. On the other hand, it bears little resemblance to the Banshū dialect, spoken right across the Akashi Strait from the island. ==Classification== Tasuaki Negita in A Study of the Awaji Dialect (1986, ) divides the Awaji dialect into Northern, Central, and Southern varieties, grouping the Northern Awaji dialect with that of the area of the former Kawachi and Yamato Provinces, Central Awaji with that of Izumi Province and Wakayama City, and Southern Awaji with that of Tokushima City. Yamamoto Toshiharu and Yuriko Iino in \\"The Dialects of Hyōgo: Their Distribution and Classification\\" (published in The Bulletin of Mukogawa Women's University, Vol. 10, 1962) instead divide the dialect into Northern Awaji, Sumoto, and Southern Awaji, and further subdivide Northern Awaji into Eastern and Northern sub-varieties. ==Intonation and pitch accent== :Where a gloss is given for either only Awaji dialect or standard Japanese, the other gloss is identical to the given one. The entire island uses a Keihan type (wordtone and accent) pitch accent system. Especially among the elderly and people living in remote areas, the traditional Keihan system (which has disappeared in Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe, and most of the rest of the Kansai Region) is still to be found. Yoichi Fujiwara noted in \\"Three Major Dialects of the Inland Sea Region\\" (part of Japanese Dialects of the Shōwa Period) that the vicinity of the former Ikuwa Village (now part of the Hokudan-chō Tsuna-gun area of Awaji City) had a H-L-H type intonation (e.g., dokomade it-temo (\\"wherever go.\\") would be pronounced dókòmádè ìttémò). Eiichi Murauchi tells us that one Mrs. Koi, an elderly women from Kamaguchi (now part of the Higashiura-chō Tsuna-gun area of Awaji City) had kíkìbín (\\"heel\\") and kátàkúmà (\\"piggyback ride\\") for standard Japanese kibisu and kataguruma, respectively, and Yoshiyuki Hattori observed in 1965 an elderly woman from the Kusumoto area (now also part of Higashiura-chō Tsuna- gun) who had tsúbàkúrò (\\"swallow\\") for standard tsubame. In general, north of Gunge (part of the Ichinomiya-chō Tsuna-gun area of Awaji City) and Shizuki (part of Tsuna-chō Tsuna-gun area of Awaji City), the prosodic system includes examples not only like these, which can be found throughout the country, but a somewhat different system, found nowhere else in Hyōgo Prefecture. ==Pronunciation== :Where a gloss is given for either only Awaji dialect or standard Japanese, the other gloss is identical to the given one. Awaji dialect speakers, like many other speakers of rural Kansai dialects, exhibit alternations between the phonemes /d/, /z/, and /r/, between /m/ and /b/, and /b/ and /w/. Other features shared in common with such dialects include diphthong assimilation, excrescence at a compound boundary, alternations between voiced and voiceless consonants, and various euphonic changes. To give an example of variant forms, the Sumoto variety has igok- (\\"move\\"), sabuk- (\\"cold\\"), osshe- (\\"teach\\"), kaaraa (\\"roof tile\\"), and ebesu (\\"provincial\\") for standard ugok-, samuk-, oshie-, kawara, and ebisu, respectively. In the Yura district of Sumoto, however, a very distinctive variety of Awaji dialect, termed Yura-ben (meaning \\"Yura dialect\\"), is spoken, characterized by rapid speech and frequent sound assimilations and omissions, making it very difficult to understand (in the rest of island, only the assimilation of the diphthong /ai/ to /æː/ is common). According to the Linguistic Atlas of Japan (a publication of NINJAL's Regional Linguistics Laboratory), elderly people in some sections of the former towns of Midori and Nandan (now both part of Minamiawaji City) still preserved the distinction between /kw/ and /k/ and /gw/ and /g/, lost in most of the rest of the country. In addition, the map indicates a preservation of the medieval pronunciation of the mora /se/ as [ɕe] in some parts of Nandan's Fukura district. In most Kansai dialects, when a mora other than the first of a word consisting of a consonant and a high vowel is followed immediately by a vowel or semivowel (whether word-internally or -externally), the consonant changes to one of the moraic phonemes /Q/ or /N/, the high vowel is deleted, and the vowel or semivowel becomes /j/; the resulting sequence of /QCj/ or /NCj/ may then be subject to further changes due to the regular process of palatalization common to all Japanese dialects. This process is exemplified by the famous realization sunmyos=shat-tara assha=de nisshakas=shuki=ni (\\"If you want to get to Sumiyoshi, catch the Nishi-Akashi-bound [train] at Ashiya,\\" lit. \\"Sumiyoshi= Ashiya= Nishi- Akashi==\\") for underlying *sumiyoshi=yat-tara ashiya=de nishiakashi=yuki=ni. In the Awaji dialect, however, this change can also affect the first mora of a word, resulting in forms like ssar- (\\"sit\\") and ssho (\\"salt\\") for standard suwar- and shio, respectively, and thus making the dialect a rare example of a Japanese variety that allows initial geminates. ==Grammar== :Where a gloss is given for either only Awaji dialect or standard Japanese, the other gloss is identical to the given one. Awaji dialect has the following features: * A migration of the monograde verbal class to the quadrigrade class, originating in the Sumoto area, is currently underway. For example, okira-n (\\"wake up.\\") and okire-ra-n (\\"wake up.\\") for standard Japanese oki-nak- (\\"wake up.\\") and oki-rare-nak- (\\"wake up.\\"), respectively. * A merger of the conclusive and adnominal for adjectival nouns. For example, kimama=na (\\"selfish=\\") for standard kimama=da. * Some speakers use the copulas =ja and =ya interchangeably. The copula =da is not used, but in Sumoto the particle =daa can be used to express the tentative mood. For example, a-n=daa (\\"exist.=\\") and sha na-i=dee=ka (\\"it can't be helped,\\" lit. \\"method exist-==\\") for standard ar-u=dar-oo (\\"exist.=\\") and sikata=dewa-na-i=ka (lit. \\"method==\\"), respectively. * The nominative particle =ga often fuses with the preceding noun. For example, am=yaa (\\"rain=\\") for standard ame=ga. * The sentence ending particle used to mark tag questions in Sumoto is =na, and =no elsewhere on the island. For example, yo-o oyog-u=naa (\\"good. swim.=\\") for standard yo-ku oyog-u=ne. * Up until the early Shōwa period, married women in Sumoto used the sentence-ending particles =zan and =kan. For example, e-e=zan (\\"good.=\\") for standard i-i=n=da=ne (\\"good.===\\"). ===Conjugation=== The -ba of the provisional form fuses with the base of the verb; for example, kak-ya (\\"write.\\") for standard kake-ba. Also, the r-row quadrigrade nonpast ending -r-u and the monograde nonpast ending -ru change to either /Q/ or /N/ when followed by some uninflected words and a few special verbs, giving forms like hashiz=zo (\\"run-=\\") and a-n=no=ka (\\"exist.==\\") for standard hashir-u=zo (\\"run.=\\") and ar-u=no=ka. == Speakers of the Awaji dialect are often lambasted for not using respectful language. It has been said of the regional character of Sumoto, that since social status and socioeconomic levels do not vary much, respectful language is scarce, that people from Awaji are often be heard to speak unreservedly to each other in the interest of fostering frankness among intimates, and that the use of such language may come off as cold or distant. But the Awaji dialect certainly does not lack respectful forms intrinsically. Although the dialect has its own rich inventory of such expressions, due to the diffusion of respectful forms from Standard Japanese on the island, they are in the process of disappearing. ===Respectful verbs and auxiliaries===  * + -nahar- (quadrigrade conjugation). Equivalent to standard + -nasar-. Also equivalent to related Osaka dialect + -har-. * + -tsuka. Equivalent to standard + -kudasa-i. Derived from Middle Japanese tukapasa-re-yo (\\"send.\\"). Also used in the Shikoku dialects. Equivalent to related San'yō dialect + -tsukaasa-i. * + -tsukahar- (quadrigrade conjugation). Equivalent to standard + -kudasar-. A composite of the above two. * + -nas-i-ta. Equivalent to standard + -nasar-e-ta. * + -hairyo. Equivalent to standard + -kudasa-i. Also used in the Shikoku dialects. * + -okure. Equivalent to standard + -kure.  * ang-yo. Equivalent to standard age-mash-ō. * + -t-ang-yo. Equivalent to standard + -t-age-mash-ō.  * + -mash-o. Equivalent to standard + -mash-ō. * =desse. Equivalent to standard =des-u-yo. Also used in Osaka dialect. * omas- (quadrigrade conjugation). Polite equivalent for the verb ar- (\\"exist\\"). Also used in Osaka dialect. * + -n-se. Equivalent to standard + -mash-ō. Nushima women's language. An example of an ancient form preserved on an outlying island. ===Other types of respectful language=== In polite language, the forms a-z=ze (\\"exist.=\\") and a-k=kana (\\"exist.=\\") are preferred to a-z=zo and a-k=ka (\\"exist.=\\") for standard ar-u=yo and ar-u=ka, respectively. Also, the choice of the honorific prefix go= or o= is governed by the same rules as in the standard language, so kigen=ya e-e=ka (\\"Are [you] in a good mood?\\", lit. \\"mood= good.=\\") becomes go=kigen=ya o=yoroshi-i=kana (lit. \\"=mood= =good-=\\"), for standard kigen=wa i-i=ka and go=kigen=wa o=yoroshi-i=kana, respectively. Of course, when in Standard Japanese a speaker would attach the suffix -san to a person's name, in Awaji dialect the suffix -han is used instead, just as in the Osaka dialect. ==Vocabulary== :Where a gloss is given for either only Awaji dialect or standard Japanese, the other gloss is identical to the given one. ===Influence from surroundings=== The variations of the island's regions are such that it is difficult to talk of a single, unified Awaji dialect. The lineages of Kobe and Osaka, Kii, Awa are mixed together in the vocabulary and grammar of the dialect. To take the standard mi-na-i (\\"see.\\") as an example, the Kobe/Osaka forms mii-hen and mi-yahen are found in the vicinity of the former Tsuna District and in the Aiga and Nakagawa sections of Sumoto City, the Kii forms mi-n and mi-yan are found in Sumoto's Yura and Nada neighborhoods, the Nada neighborhood of the Nandan-chō Mihara-gun section of Minamiawaji City, and on Nushima, and the Awa form mi-yasen (all \\"see.\\") is found in the rest of the former Mihara District and within the original boundaries of the City of Sumoto, and there are even areas of Sumoto and southern Goshiki where the Kobe/Osaka and Awa forms are found in free variation. One place where the vocabulary is relatively average or even meager is the island's largest city, Sumoto, in the so-called \\"Sumoto Dialect\\" spoken within the old boundaries of the city. Conversely, it is within the very same city, in the Yura neighborhood, where what may be the island's most characteristic variety, the aforementioned Yura Dialect, is spoken. In most Kansai dialects, the word aho (\\"idiot\\") is seen for standard baka, and the Awaji dialect is no exception, but in Hokudan one also find chage (realized [tɕaŋe]) with the same meaning. The form kichanak- (\\"dirty\\") is common for standard kitanak-, and particularly in northern region the form chanak- or the alternative word yosowashik- are also found. The dialects of Kyoto/Osaka/Kobe, Wakayama, and Okayama have retained the word senchi (\\"restroom\\"), replaced in the standard language by benjo, and in Awaji this has become sencha; the dialects of Sumoto's Yura and Nada sections also have the forms hako and nbako. Throughout Hokudan and in parts of Higashiura expressions reminiscent of those of the Kawachi dialect, such as yo-o ki-ta=noo ware (\\"welcome,\\" lit. \\"good. come.= you\\") and sonna koto s-uk=ka re (\\"don't do that,\\" lit. \\"that sort of thing do.= you\\") for standard yok-u ki-ta=nee, omae=wa (lit. \\"good. come.=, you=\\") and sonna koto s-uru=kai, omae=wa (\\"that sort of thing do.=, you=\\"), respectively, can be seen. The reason that Awaji shares forms and vocabulary with such geographically distant regions as Settsu, Izumi, and Kawachi is that from ancient times a bilateral trade of goods and culture flourished, and the activities of the Nojima and Mihara fisherman (groups that once inhabited the island and that are mentioned in the earliest chronicles of Japan), who moved between Naniwa and Yamato, is noted in the historical record. As for the connection to Awa, the island was during the Edo Period ruled over by the Tokushima Domain. ===A dialect at the center of the Inland Sea=== As the Seto Inland Sea has from time immemorial served to connect Kyushu and the Kinai by sea, it has played a very important role in Japanese history. New words from the capital area leaving Honshu for the West first had to stop over in Awaji. Through absorbing all of this new vocabulary so quickly, the island, along with others in its vicinity such as Shōdo and Shimada and Ōge in the Naruto Strait, constituted a remarkable dialect sprachbund (an area where dialects share linguistic features, in this case vocabulary, because of extensive contact despite not necessarily being closely related). For standard takenoko-gasa (a type of conical hat made from weaving together bamboo sheaths, lit. \\"bamboo shoot.hat\\"), we find words such as taiko-gasa and taiko-bachi disseminated throughout the Seto, and the word chinchiro (\\"pinecone\\") for standard matsukasa, pervasive in mainland Kansai, has also spread to Awaji and the islands in the open sea around the Naruto. Under the influence of this state of affairs, Awaji Island has had a strong tendency to be isolated on the periphery. Examples of vocabulary items found only on the island are hotoke=no uma (\\"praying mantis,\\" lit. \\"buddha. horse\\"), for standard kamakiri (\\"praying mantis\\"), hi=ater-i ame (\\"sunshower,\\" lit. \\"sun=expose. rain\\") for standard hi=der-i ame (lit. \\"sun=shine. rain\\"), and hidari=ete (\\"left-handed,\\" lit. \\"left=forte\\") for standard hidari=kik-i (lit. \\"left=effective.\\"). In addition to these Awaji-specific forms, the dialect also has forms found in other places, such as iari (\\"ant\\") for standard ari, also found in Kyushu, and even as new words develop or are taken in from elsewhere, there is a still a tendency to preserve the old forms. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Hyōgo's Dialects and Regional Speech Styles.

Originally a segment of the Calle Real, it is now a four-lane undivided arterial designated as a component of Manila's Radial Road 2 network. It runs parallel to Roxas Boulevard and its extension, the Manila–Cavite Expressway (Coastal Road). The northern section in Parañaque is known as Elpidio Quirino Avenue, while the southern section in Las Piñas is Padre Diego Cera Avenue.

Press of Mississippi, 2017, pp.145-146 or Birmingham, Alabama, Anderson was an active vaudeville performer by 1909, when he played in Memphis, Tennessee. He shared bills with Bessie Smith on several occasions, and by summer 1913 was known for his comedy and his performances of blues songs and \\"lullaby yodels\\", called by one reviewer \\"the Male Mockingbird\\". Anderson regularly performed as a female impersonator, in costume as an archetypal \\"mammy\\", and performed songs including \\"Baby Seals Blues\\" and W. C. Handy's \\"Saint Louis Blues\\". Ethel Waters, long regarded as the first performer of the latter song, stated that she had first heard it sung by Anderson in Baltimore in 1917. Lynn Abbott and Doug Seroff, \\"\\"They Cert'ly Sound Good to Me\\": Sheet Music, Southern Vaudeville, and the Commercial Ascendancy of the Blues\\", American Music, Vol. 14, No. 4, New Perspectives on the Blues (Winter, 1996), pp.421-422 He also toured in Ontario, Michigan, and elsewhere. In 1923, Anderson recorded Seals' blues for Okeh Records, as \\"Sing 'Em Blues\\", with piano accompaniment by Eddie Heywood Sr.. Blues scholars Lynn Abbott and Doug Seroff commented on the performance: \\"Capturing the full range of Anderson's folk-operatic tenor voice in a remarkable rendition of the first published vocal blues song, this record survives to demonstrate an unabashedly comical resolution of \\"high\\" and \\"low\\" art, a positive realization of \\"colored folks opera.\\" Anderson recorded a further six songs for Okeh in 1924, and at his final recording session in 1928 recorded \\"Saint Louis Blues\\" as well as \\"I Got Those Crying Yodelin' Blues.\\" \\"Charles Anderson (vocalist)\\", Discography of American Historical Recordings. Retrieved 5 March 2018 Although a favorite with black vaudeville audiences at the time, Anderson has tended to be dismissed as a curiosity by later critics because of his high voice and clear diction, which Abbott and Seroff say \\"conflict with modern tastes and stereotypes.\\" Anderson is thought to have died in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, after 1937. ==References== Category:1883 births Category:1930s deaths Category:American blues singers Category:Vaudeville performers Category:Musicians from Birmingham, Alabama Category:20th-century American singers ","title":"Charles Anderson (vocalist)"},{"id":"56760121","text":"Ana Oncina in 2017 Ana Oncina (born 1989) is a Spanish-born freelance comic book illustrator and author whose work is particularly known in Spain, Italy and France.

Ruff was acquitted of all charges against him during the Doctors' Trial.

Originally published in September 1920 in the journal New Youth (新青年), it was later included in his first collection of short stories, A Call to Arms (吶喊). A Chinese boatman hears news of the abortive Manchu Restoration of July 1917 and fears that he will be executed as he had abandoned the queue after the fall of the Qing dynasty. At the same time his neighbour, who has kept his, exults. ==Background== A Chinese man wearing a queue In 1644, after the conquest of China by the Manchurian Qing dynasty, Han Chinese males were forced on pain of execution to adopt the queue, a Manchurian hairstyle consisting of shaving the forehead and wearing the rest of one's hair in a long plait. On the other hand, during the Taiping Rebellion, the revolutionaries would execute anyone who wore the queue as a presumed Qing loyalist. After the last emperor Puyi abdicated in 1912, the Republic of China was established and the queue was widely abandoned. In July 1917 the Qing loyalist Zhang Xun attempted to restore Puyi to the throne, but the revolt collapsed in a fortnight. Given the primitive communications infrastructure in China, this news took longer to spread to rural and remote areas. ==Synopsis== The boatman Sevenpounder (七斤) comes back to his village one night, bringing the news to his family that \\"the Emperor has returned to the Dragon Throne\\". He worries, as people in town had shaved off his queue during the revolution. Meanwhile, the innkeeper Zhao arrives. Zhao is renowned as the greatest scholar for ten miles round, as he reads the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Zhao had only coiled up his queue, and has now let it down. Mrs Sevenpounder notices that he is wearing his special gown which he only does when an enemy has met with misfortune. Zhao bears Sevenpounder a grudge, and taunts him that he will be now be executed. Trusting in Zhao's scholarship, Mrs Sevenpounder gives up all hope and curses her husband for having shaven off his queue. Another neighbour remembers that Mrs Sevenpounder did not object when her husband stopped growing his queue, and an argument breaks out. A fortnight later, Mrs Sevenpounder notices that Mr Zhao has coiled up his queue again, and is not wearing his gown. The Sevenpounders relax, as it seems the emperor is not coming back after all. They begin binding their daughter's feet. ==Notes * Full text of 風波 in Chinese at Wikisource Category:1920 short stories Category:Chinese Republican era short stories Category:Works by Lu Xun ","title":"A Storm in a Teacup (Lu Xun)"},{"id":"56760301","text":"Makhubung is a small suburb along National Road R49 in the country of South Africa, situated near the border of the larger town of Mahikeng. ==See also== *Economy of South Africa *History of South Africa ==References== Category:Populated places in North West (South African province) ","title":"Makhubung"},{"id":"56760325","text":"Euhybus is a genus of hybotid dance flies in the family Hybotidae.

By 2012, first contacts were initiated between the Renewed Ecumenical Catholic Church of Guatemala (', ICERGUA) and representatives of Syriac Orthodox Church in North America, and within a year full communion was achieved.

It follows three sisters and a brother, adopted as infants into separate families across North America, who meet together for the first time. == Summary == The reunion emerged from decades of searching by Betty Ann Adams, the eldest of the family. Removed from their young Dene mother's care as part of Canada's infamous Sixties Scoop, Betty Ann, Esther, Rosalie and Ben were four of the 20,000 Indigenous children taken from their families between 1955 and 1985, to be either adopted into white families or to live in foster care. The documentary follows the siblings as they reunite in Banff, Alberta. As the four siblings piece together their shared history, their connection deepens, bringing laughter with it, and their family begins to take shape. == Filming process == In 2014, Betty Ann Adam, a reporter at The StarPhoenix, approached Hubbard about documenting her planned reunion and her intentions to direct the project. Hubbard pitched the idea to the National Film Board (NFB) and the response was immediately supportive. However, the NFB made it a condition that Hubbard be director. Adam agreed in order to be more emotionally and physically present for the upcoming reunion. In an article for The StarPhoenix, she emphasised the importance of having a director who had a similar lived experience of forced removal and adoption into a non-Indigenous family during the Sixties Scoop. Adam said, \\"It was perfect to have a director who had that same experience in her lived experience. We knew that would inform her approach toward the story, that she would understand certain things about what we were going through.\\" This responsibility for holding space and minimal interference was central to the filming. Despite the circumstances of the reunion taking place in a small cabin and it being a two-camera shoot, Adam says Hubbard was able to shoot the film without distracting the family from the connections they were there to make. \\"For us, things probably went as smoothly as they could. I think that's because she was taking care of things behind the scenes so they didn't interfere with our experience,\\" Adam says. == Reception == Reception of the documentary has been positive. It has featured in many festivals including the 2017 Talking Stick Festival, Edmonton International Film Festival, and the Toronto International Film Festival. Patrick Mullen of Point of View reviews the film as \\"relevatory\\" and \\"a family reunion doc like you've never seen.\\" Gateway Online calls this film a \\"triumph,\\" writing in their review, \\"Birth of a Family reminds viewers of a painful past that many First Nations peoples had and continue to trudge through.\\" Canada's documentary films festival described the film as a \\"raw emotion, a heart-wrenching combination of pain and joy, shown by the siblings throughout the film is as moving as anything I have seen on film. Their willingness to lay bare their experiences and feelings is inspiring, and while their story is devastating to watch it acts as a reminder of the resilience of the First Nations people who, against all odds and despite every effort to destroy them, continue to persevere.\\" === Awards === {  !

To do this, Belcourt pursues the secondary claims that indigeneity is a zone of biological struggle and that the reserve is something of a non-place calibrated by affects the groups under the sign of misery.

Encouraged by her childhood friend, Lara (Alice Borges), she decides to participate in a casting test in Rio de Janeiro. After losing her wallet and having a little quarrel with Lara, Kika finds herself at the bus station alone and without a penny in her pocket. The teacher is then approached by a nice grandmother, Vozinha (Dirce Migliaccio), who invites her to board the Stromboli, a bus that is taking her granddaughter (Raquel Bonfante) and six other children to do a math test in Rio. Kika becomes friends with the two while waiting for the departure of the bus. Beginning with a TV report in which Lara and Pandora (Betty Lago), a powerful TV producer, are asking for information about their whereabouts. Frightened, and fearing the police presence at the bus station, Kika accepts a magic cookie offered by Vozinha, the effect of which makes her a child again. And so, as Kikinha (Letícia Botelho), joins the group of Stromboli. The pilot Olavo (Luan Assimos), MP9 (Gabriel Lepsch) and Batata (Victor Andrade) are also on the bus, and the patrons Glorinha (Maria Clara David), Thayane (Gabrielly Nunes) and Vanessa (Isabela Cunha). But the engine pifa and the troupe are forced to spend a night at a roadside hotel - run by the hard-nosed Elói (Marcelo Adnet). It is there that the characters will live their most entertaining adventures and some of them will know a little more about themselves. The story unfolds amid positive messages about ecological issues, the background of the novel between Kika and the environmentalist Ricardo (Carlos Casagrande). On a symbolic journey that does not always need to tread real roads, Kika learns that, rather than arrival, one must be aware of the paths chosen. And also that it is important to believe in the signs that life offers so that the true dream of each person is realized. == Cast == * Xuxa Meneghel as Kika * Letícia Botelho as Kikinha (kika children) * Carlos Casagrande as Ricardo * Alice Borges as Lara * Raquel Bonfante as Juju * Dirce Migliaccio as Deolinda * Betty Lago as Pandora Raquel * Marcelo Adnet as Elói * Sergio Loroza as Jeandro * Isabella Cunha as Vanessa * Maria Clara David as Glorinha * Gabrielly Nunes as Thayane * Luan Assimos as Olavo * Victor Andrade as Batata * Milton Gonçalves as school principal * Letícia Spiller as mother of Kikinha * Ilana Kaplan as tia Memélia * Gabriel Lepsch as Maicon Pereira (MP9) * Gilberto Torres as dad of Glória ==ProductionBackground and conception=== Xuxa Meneghel, who is the owner of the highest average audience in the resumption of Brazilian cinema (2.5 million per film) and accumulated box office, created her new feature film Xuxa en Sonho de Menina, the 17th of her career. grossing R$6 million reais. This is the first cinematographic partnership of Xuxa Produções with Conspiração Filmes in the making of feature films (the producer has already signed the DVD Xuxa Só Para Baixinhos 7 (2007). The co-production is from Globo Filmes and Warner Bros.. The actress and host already has more than 35 million viewers since 1983, the year of her film debut. In 1988, the host starred in her first feature (Super Xuxa contra Baixo Astral). Its biggest box office is Lua de Cristal (1990): 5 million viewers. The idea of producing a film with this content came from the very personal experience of Xuxa. When she was 10 years old, Xuxa dreamed of having a blue bird. Although she had heard from her mother that, unfortunately, that was not possible, she did not give up on the dream and continued to believe, until one day a real blue bird came through her window and became part of the family. The event - a landmark in the life of the host - is used as a starting point for Sonho de Menina, which deals precisely with one of Xuxa's greatest convictions: the importance of believing in dreams for them to come true. Xuxa explained the concept of the film. The screenplay by Flavio de Souza, responsible for the plot of other films of the hots, such as Xuxinha e Guto contra os Monstros do Espaço (2005), Xuxa e o Tesouro da Cidade Perdida (2004) and Xuxa Abracadabra (2003). His text came to life through the eyes of director Rudi Lagemann, the \\"Foguinho\\", invited by Conspiração Filmes especially for the project. He explained the concept of the film. ===Cast=== The role of Kikinha, the children's version of the protagonist, was Leticia Botelho, who had already participated in the feature films Ouro Negro (2006) and Fica Comigo Essa Noite (2006), as well as presenting the program Janela Janelinha on TVE Brasil. To accomplish the scenes, Leticia had an intense preparation with the director and Xuxa, who had to observe to capture both the gestural and the way of speaking of the hots. \\"Staying with Xuxa, playing with the little rocker and the kids was a lot of fun,\\" says the young eight-year- old actress. I find it harder in the scene where you do not speak, but you have to record the expressions, because you can not open your mouth to speak. You have to speak with your face,\\" he continues. The cast also includes Betty Lago (in the role of Pandora Raquel, a powerful TV producer), Ilana Kaplan (Aunt Memelia, who takes care of the children on the trip), Alice Borges (Lika, Kika's best friend), Sérgio Loroza the driver Jeandro) and Marcelo Adnet (Elói, the hotel's doer). And with special guest appearances by Dirce Migliaccio (the grandmother of one of the girls on the tour), Letícia Spiller (mother of Kika as a child), Milton Gonçalves (director of the school where she works) and Alexandra Richter (a casting producer). In the children's cast, the film star Maria Clara David, who previously had participated in commercials and TV shows, such as Zorra Total, Sob Nova Direção and Linha Direta, by Globo TV, stand out. She plays Glorinha, a girl who is pressured by her parents to pursue a future that is not exactly what she dreams for herself. \\"The movie talks about it too. You have to think about whether you're running after the right dream or if that's not just the dream your father or mother wants for you, \\"says Xuxa. Carlos Casagrande lives Ricardo, the romantic couple of Xuxa, and leads the environmental message of the film. He plays a biologist and environmental secretary for Quimera, a fictional city where people are ecologically conscious and take care of everything not to attack the planet. \\"Xuxa is a very calm person. It's very nice to work with her\\" says Casagrande. For the actor, the director Foguinho has a lot of patience and tranquility to deal with children. \\"His sensitivity is very great. He passes everything he wants from the actor in a very clear way. First, it makes you feel comfortable doing what you have in your head, and then it shapes.\\" ===Filming=== Most of the scenes from \\"Xuxa en Sonho de Menina\\" were filmed on location in the capital and in the interior of the state of Rio de Janeiro, with only two days of filming in studio. Places known to Cariocas, such as the Glauce Rocha Theater in the Center, and the Lage Park, in addition to the Hotel Le Canton in Teresópolis, were redecorated and served as a setting for history. The Jockey Club, located in the South Zone of Rio, was transformed into a bus station and, to look like a small town terminal, only a small part of the central hall in which the betting bag occurs was used. It is at this point in the film that the transition from reality to the dream happens and vice versa. In this way, the space had to be decorated in two different ways, in order to distinguish both universes. \\"We created two versions for every road sign, real-world signs were more facetious, square, and dreamy,\\" says Art Director Daniel Flaksman. It was a mansion in Alto da Boa Vista that received the main scenes of the film, with the purpose of generating the \\"cartunesca\\" atmosphere of Hotel Paratodos. \\"The hotel is the greatest setting in terms of concepts because we had to change the facade, the reception, the dining room, the staircase, the corridors and the rooms,\\" says Flaksman. Each of the rooms was ornamented with strange objects ordered in an improbable manner. The idea was to bring in \\"visual jokes\\" so that the environment would indeed look like a dream. \\"We put a picture upside down, a giant log book ... it has a wall with several clocks, the pointers do not walk and each one sets a different time. Why do not they walk? Because time stands still, \\"he explains. One day after the filming began, director Rudi Lagemann already felt the usual apprehension that precedes the beginning of the production of a feature film. \\"We are anxious, in a hallucinatory rhythm of preparation, an immense team of artists and technicians rehearsing, designing choreographies, making costumes, constructing scenarios to arrive at this magic hour that is to enter the set and we can say the blessed word: 'Action!' \\"Said the director, at the time, noting that filming is, in all its aspects, a moment of great pleasure. \\"I feel privileged. I love filming, solving typical shooting problems, exchanging ideas, directing actors, choosing camera angles. It's very enjoyable to get along with good-humored and intelligent people, and the movies provide that.\\" Preparing the cast during pre-production helped make sure everyone was tuned in to shoot the scenes. Xuxa participated actively in the trials. \\"I really like essays because we exchange ideas with them and consistently build the dramatic tempo of a cinematic narrative. Adults and children rehearsed with Xuxa. These rehearsals were marked by fun and professionalism and all contributed to characterize their characters and give internal rhythm to the scenes\\" says Foguinho. The Xuxa em Sonho de Menina set was marked by the daily presence of many children. In addition to the children cast, on many occasions children of team members were invited to watch the footage. This made the environment a relaxed place, which eventually infected the adults. \\"We have become a little brat, having fun as they have fun,\\" confirms actor Serjão Loroza. \\"I really like being in touch with the kids because they bring new energy to the set,\\" adds Dirce Migliaccio. At the time of the scenes, however, the work was taken very seriously. \\"We used to play every day and rehearsal was messy all the time, but at the time of the scene it was full concentration,\\" says Maria Clara David, who plays Glorinha. After four weeks on the set, he was sure that the work was well done, despite the short time to meet the schedule. For the director, the professionalism of his team and the serenity of Xuxa were determining factors for the good environment of filming. \\"The great difficulty was the meager time for preparation and filming. The team was able to transform, with creativity and talent, such difficulty in quality differential \\", praises. \\"What could become a tense process has become something pleasurable. And much of this is due to the playful and peaceful spirit of Xuxa\\". he adds. ===Special effects=== The visual effects were elaborated and executed by the post-production team of Conspiração Filmes, in partnership with Megacolor, under the supervision of Cláudio Peralta and Adenilson Muri Cunha, two specialists in the area. \\"We have already begun the process knowing what scenes we would play in the story. Our main job was to print a magical and fanciful character at specific points in the film. They are subtle and beautiful effects, pleasant for both adults and children\\", says Peralta. ===Musical Production=== Ary Sperling signs the musical production and soundtrack of the film, whose theme \\"Sonho de Menina (Eu Acredito)\\" is a partnership between him and Vanessa Alves, who have participated in other projects of the presenter, such as the DVD Xuxa Só Para Baixinhos 7 . \\"The song was based on the script and the elements that Xuxa asked were: talking about imagination, the power to believe in things and run after your dreams, paying attention to the signs. It seems like an obvious thing, but a lot of people do not realize the circumstances of life\\" summarizes Ary. ===Release=== The press conference of presentation of the film occurred on December 14, 2007, The premiere took place on December 11, 2007, in São Paulo and December 19, 2007 in Rio de Janeiro. The site teaser developed by the agency RMG Connect, the site allows the Internet users to check the teaser trailer, some photos, the synopsis and the technical file of the film. The film was released on December 21, 2007. ==ReceptionCritical response=== The site Cine Dica gave an average score of 34 points to the movie. The audience surveyed by Filmow gave the film an average of 2.1 votes. The Adorocinema audience gave the film four and a half stars out of five, and an average of 3.5 points. In a poll conducted by The Enemy, the film was voted worst of the year, with more than 52% of the audience vote. Diego Benevides writing for Cinema com Rapadura, gave the film only a 1 note, defined Xuxa em Sonho de Menina, as one more unsuccessful onslaught from the children's film presenter, writing that \\"The story of Flávio de Souza has more quality than the lousy Xuxa Gêmeas, but still makes a point of highlighting the TV hots as a child. There is always the moment when Xuxa equals the public, whether in the way of dressing or telepathy with a teddy bear named Bebeto. Xuxa is already in her forties and the main reason for the failure in its televising or cinematographic attacks is to remain in the usual.\\" He praised the adult cast of the film, however, considered them to be \\"in a story that no character is deepened, other than Xuxa herself or her miniature, the nice Leticia Botelho.\\" To the critic \\"all the technical aspects are regrettable, but the soundtrack and the sound can be shameful. In addition to the invariable songs that accompany the heroes in the story, the audience has yet to witness the constant use of 'toin' BGs and such 'grace-making' stuff in the story. It even seems that the technical team is doing one of those pictures of the children's program of Xuxa, without the slightest responsibility of having a cinematic posture.\\" A critic of Cineclick, compared Sonho de Menina, with the previous film of Xuxa, Lua de Cristal (1989), for having as an intention to transmit to the viewers \\"messages of realizing the dreams, but now the presenter wants to give a new learning to the\\" little ones: to want, power and achieve. It is the formula of success.\\" He defined the film's script as \\"autobiographical, with stories from Xuxa's past, seasoned with fiction.\\" He praised the performance of Letícia Botelho, writing that she has a \\"sweet and sweet way that enchants.\\" But she criticized the script for the film, stating that \\"What could signal a change of style in a production starring Xuxa is not happening, as Xuxa em Sonho de Menina retains the characteristics of her previous films. that is not found in this production, the pattern of the previous ones is followed: adventure, a light novel, children and a hideous villain.\\" The Cine Gospel site criticized the film's performances, writing that \\"they are all pretty bad, taking away from the always excellent veteran Dirce Migliaccio.\\" The actress children are not good enough and Xuxa plays, as always, Xuxa. He praised the production for representing a breakthrough in Xuxa's film career, writing that unlike his predecessors, \\"it does not bring fashionable singers as pseudo-actors, and the audience is largely spared from traditional musical numbers.\\" The site defined the story as puerile by writing that it can even reveal its superficiality if we think it is aimed at children. But according to him the children deserved more. Luiz Joaquim writing for the Cinema Escrito, said that there is something nice in \\"Sonho de Menina\\", unlike his recent work for the movies. \\"The fact that it is an urban story with few fantastic elements has made it closer, and therefore easier, in a good way.\\" For the author, the ecologically correct galan interpreted by Carlos Casagrande, \\"has no narrative function, only to be beautiful.\\" but he praised the performance of Sergio Loroza, as the driver of the Stromboli bus. Writing that \\"Despite the weight, Segio transits light through the entire film.\\" Writing for the Omelette, Marcelo Forlani wrote that \\"In the movie, Xuxa dreams of being an actress, but in real life she has given up.\\" Mariane Morisawa from Terra, gave the film three stars, writing that the film \\"is funny and reminds us in some moments of the presenter's trajectory, but misses mixing ecological messages with messages about dreams\\". ===Box office=== Xuxa em Sonho de Menina was a box office failure, conquering a smaller audience than all the films starring the TV hots since Xuxa Requebra (1999), accounting for meager 309,174 box offices. The bad performance of the films of TV hots recorded in recent years is the result of the separation between Xuxa and Diler & Associados. Xuxinha e Guto contra os Monstros do Espaço (2005), an animated film that had the special participation of the presenter in flesh and blood, was until then the lowest income of the brand, with 596,218 spectators. The latter, Xuxa Gêmeas (2006), garnered just over a million box offices.

In 2015, Adams publicly predicted Trump's victory. Adams later cited his research into the field of persuasion as the basis for his claim. He wrote Win Bigly to analyze Trump's tactics and offer guidance to improve readers' communication skills. He describes people who, like Trump, are skilled at convincing listeners as \\"master persuaders\\". He posits that when debating an issue, facts are only important when they can impact at an emotional level. ==Reception== Florida Today described the subject matter as \\"something of great value in today’s media-saturated environment\\", and Publishers Weekly thought Win Bigly was \\"highly readable\\" and handled in a skillful and humorous manner. Politico, however, found the book to be \\"an oxygen-free cubicle into which is piped a barking infomercial for the president\\".

Copland, later Dean of the Faculty of Commerce at Melbourne University. He joined the Tasmanian Education Department and taught there for a few years before accepting an appointment to teach (and coach football) at St Peter's College, Adelaide, while continuing his studies at the University of Adelaide. In 1925 he received his Bachelor of Commerce from the University of Tasmania, and in the same year won the University of Adelaide's Tinline Scholarship. He went to Cambridge University, where he studied under Keynes, and graduated MA and MSc. From 1929 to 1931 he was a research fellow of the Rockefeller Foundation, and admitted to the prestigious Keynes Club. His work won him a Wrenbury Scholarship in 1930 and the Adam Smith Prize in 1932. In 1931 he was appointed Lecturer in Economics at the University of Edinburgh. He was in 1937 appointed Professor of Economics at Swansea University, being highly commended by John Maynard Keynes, then at King's College, Cambridge, and by D. H. Robertson, of Trinity College, Cambridge. He was appointed to the Chair of Economics, University of Adelaide, in November 1938. In 1942 he was seconded to the wartime Commonwealth Rationing Commission as an economic adviser, and appointed temporary lieutenant-colonel in the Australian Army to provide economic advice. He was a member with Sidney Crawford and half-a-dozen diverse people of influence in the liberal South Australian think tank \\"Common Cause\\", which discussed post-war reconstruction. In 1945 he left Adelaide for Belfast, where he had been appointed Professor of Economics, and Dean of the Faculty of Economics at Queen's University, Belfast.

Both Ames' father and maternal grandfather, Joseph Bushnell (1831–1918), came from old New England families and became wealthy during the Pennsylvania Oil Rush. Ames' great- grandfather was the Pittsburgh industrialist Daniel Bushnell. After Elias Ames' death of pneumonia in 1891 at age 39, Joseph's mother moved the family to Morristown, New Jersey, where her children had a privileged upbringing in the town that was then known as an \\"inland Newport.\\". Ames attended St. Mark's School and the Stevens Institute of Technology, graduating from the latter in 1901. Ames then worked as a mechanical engineer in Morristown, New Jersey for a time, until he quit that profession and began writing. ==Career== Ames wrote over a dozen novels, primarily Westerns, during the 1910s and 1920s. Some of his works, including the posthumously published The Bladed Barrier, included fantasy themes. While Ames' books were set in the Western United States (the famous Pete, cow-puncher - A Story of the Texas Plains, is one example), it is unclear whether he ever travelled there extensively. His novel Shoe-Bar Stratton was made into the 1922 Western film Catch My Smoke, directed by William Beaudine and featuring actors Tom Mix and Lillian Rich.

The estate was the former residence of industrialist George Vail. Today the home is preserved as a historic site. Ames' brother Peter Ashmun Ames, to whom Joseph dedicated his 1921 novel The Emerald Buddha, was an American intelligence officer and a member of the Cairo Gang.

His doctor prescribes rest and good food, in addition to medication, to get him back to health. Without money his wife, Joan Templeton, is further threatened with eviction by their landlord, who suggests that there are relatively easy ways for a pretty young woman to make money. With no other alternative, Joan seeks out a wealthy benefactor, who she has an affair with in exchange for enough money to see her and Ned by, and Ned back to health. Once he regains his health, he begins to become successful, and the couple returns to the United States, where his career really begins to take off. Helen Cartwright is impressed by his work, and convinces her father, James, to have his portrait done by Ned, and become his patron. When James realizes that Helen is in love with Ned, he also understands that the only thing standing in the way of his daughter's happiness is Joan. He uses his influence to add to Ned's success, as well as driving a wedge between Ned and Joan, who begin drifting apart, each thinking the other no longer cares. Ned and Helen begin to draw close to one another. As a way to drive the final spike in her marriage, James approaches Joan and offers her a large sum of money to divorce Ned. Joan refuses, but James and her both realize that it was James who was her rich benefactor in Paris.

In the model, the one-dimensional materials are resulted from spiral growth of a graphene ribbon, like an ivy growing on a tree in nature, resulting in a helically opened, tube-like structure. Lee et al. suggested unique \\"nodal morphology\\" as evidence for the helix model for SWNTs, which prevails in high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images reported since 1993. The helix model for SWNTs is supported by strain energy calculation. The strain energy of the helical growth of a zigzag or armchair graphene ribbon is just about a quarter that of seamless cylindrical SWNTs. This calculation suggests that the growth of seamless SWNTs may be energetically prohibitive and uncompetitive with the structure proposed here under the conditions of conventional chemical vapor deposition processes. The model addresses previous experimental evidence in the literature, diverse electron diffraction patterns, HRTEM and STM morphologies as well as inconsistencies in the measured mechanical and electrical properties of SWNTs. Electrical property of SWNTs can be regarded as a (zigzag) graphene nanoribbon which is a conductor. In the mode, the chirality is not a necessary condition for the growth of SWNTs and the observation of chirality (or semiconducting properties) in the literature may be the result of an erroneous interpretation of the distortion of the graphene helix. Based on spiral growth model, further works were carried out to investigate the mechanical properties (evaluation of tensile process by stress distribution). Recently, Park et al. reinterpreted SWNTs to be a graphene helix via Raman spectroscopy, showing that the typical Raman spectrum for SWNTs is the signature of their helical structure with density functional theory simulation and structure analysis for hydrogenated and dehydrogenated SWNTs samples. They demonstrated that the G- mode at ~1570 cm-1 is unique to opened tubular graphene structures (i.e., graphene helix) of ~2 nm in diameter. They also demonstrate that D mode of ~1350 cm-1 is originated from edge defects of opened SWNTs revealing strong Eigenvectors, which is absent in concentric tubes. They also showed that the analysis for the Raman spectra of SWNTs is consistent with general understanding on Raman analysis of carbon materials . ==References== Category:Carbon nanotubes Category:Carbon forms ","title":"Graphene helix"},{"id":"56761350","text":"Alice Blue Gown is a popular song written by Joseph McCarthy and Harry Tierney.

In 1813-14 she played an important role in the captures of Cuxhaven and Glückstadt. After the war she became a survey vessel, and then a quarantine ship. She was delivered to the Coast Guard in 1833 as a watch vessel and was re-designated WV18 in 1863. She was sold in 1867. ==Wartime service== Commander Andrew Pellet Green's commission as commander was dated 1 February 1812. He commissioned Shamrock in November. Shamrock initially served on the Downs station. In April 1813 she was placed under the orders of Captain M'Kerlie of the Heligoland squadron. Green sailed Shamrock to Cuxhaven where he took command of a squadron comprising , , , , and gun-boats No.s 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 10. The British vessels had come to support the Russian troops under Colonel Alexander Radlinger, who were besieging the town. Captain Arthur Farquhar in arrived at Cuxhaven from Bremerlehe on 28 November to take command of the squadron that Captain Greene had gathered. The two key French positions were the forts Napoleon and Phare. While the gunboats fired on Phare, the British landed a number of guns and established a battery of six 18-pounders, two 32-pounders, and two 6-pounders. Before the battery could start firing on the 30th, the French surrendered both forts. The French surrendered 26 heavy guns, two 13\\" mortars, and a blockhouse with a garrison of three hundred men and officers, all of whom became prisoners of war. On 11 November 1813 Commander John Marshall assumed command of Shamrock He joined her off Cuxhaven. Green was appointed to command , but delayed, remaining with Farquhar as a volunteer. He was made a knight of the Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order and the Swedish Order of the Sword for his services at Cuxhaven.Marshall (1829), Supplement, Part 3, pp.250-52. Marshall received orders to proceed further up the Elbe with the gun-boats. The flotilla's objective was to watch the French at Gluckstadt until the arrival there of the Swedish troops under the Baron de Boyé. From late December 1813 Farquhar's squadron, comprising Desiree, Hearty, Blazer, Piercer, Shamrock, Redbreast, and eight gun-boats (the seven from Cuxhaven plus No. 12), supported Swedish forces under the command of General Baron de Boye against the Danes in the attack on the town and fortress of Glückstadt at the Elbe river during the War of the Sixth Coalition. The British arrived on 23 December and by 25 December had erected a battery of two 32-pounder guns. (They had landed six but the poor quality of the roads meant that only two were in place.) To support the bombardment on the next day, Farquhar sent in the gunboats and the brigs, whose armament he had reinforced with two 18-pounders each from Desiree. The bombardment continued to the 28th. Glückstadt having failed to surrender, Farquhar established three more batteries, one of two 18-pounders, one of four 32-pounders, and one of the two 13\\" mortars captured at Cuxhaven. An English rocket brigade under Lieutenant Amherst Wright contributed to the bombardment. These batteries commenced bombarding the town on 1 January 1814, keeping it up for the next two days. On 4 January Farquhar sent in a flag of truce, and after negotiations, the governor surrendered on 5 January. British casualties overall were light; none were from Shamrock. The Swedish troops arrived on 5 January 1814 and four days later Marshall entered the harbour at Gluckstadt where he took possession of the Danish flotilla of one brig and seven gunboats. Marshall then was despatched to Kiel to establish the squadron's claims to the enemy's vessels, stores, etc. captured on the Elbe. When the ice broke up, Shamrock moved to Cuxhaven where she remained. However, her only Lieutenant, James Edgecombe, took command of six gunboats and assisted at the blockades of Hamburg and Haarburg.Marshall (1829), Supplement, Part 3, pp.390-3. Marshall received promotion to post captain on 7 June 1814.United Service Magazine (1850), p.479. He was made a Companion of the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath, Knight of the highest Russian Military Order of St. George, and knight of the Swedish order of the Sword. On 15 July 1816 there was a first payment of £5000 in prize money to the navy for the capitulation of Glückstadt. In 1847, the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Gluckstadt 5 Jany. 1814\\" to all surviving claimants from the action. Commander Christopher Askew commanded Shamrock from June 1814 on the Irish station. She was paid off into ordinary in October 1815 at Plymouth. ==Post- war== Between November 1816 and February 1817, Shamrock underwent fitting at Plymouth for a survey vessel. Commander Martin White commissioned her in May for surveying in the Channel. She proceeded to survey the coasts of England, Ireland, Jersey, and Guernsey. On 22 October 1820 Shamrock was caught in a gale at St Helen's Pople, Scilly.This may have been St Helen's Pool, a sheltered anchorage just south of St Helen's, Isles of Scilly. She had to cut away both her masts.Lloyd's List №5538. Commander Martin left Shamrock in 1828. She was at Woolwich in 1829 where between September 1830 and 1831 she underwent fitting as a quarantine ship. ==Coast Guard== The Admiralty delivered Shamrock in March 1833 to the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard then used her as a watch vessel at Rochester, Kent.

Her drawings, paintings, and sculptures focus on the representation of people, either in portraiture or as figures who embody aspects of her inner experience. She has been praised for her ability to articulate complex and profound emotion in her work. Among her art media are paint (oil and acrylic), ink, marker pen, papier-mâché, clay, and wood. She was a performance artist in the 1980s, and she plays guitar and violin. Alper is represented by Rosamund Felsen Gallery. Alper is the subject of the documentary film Heaven Is a Traffic Jam on the 405 (2016), which won the Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject) in 2018. ==Early life and education== Alper was born into a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York in 1959; she was the second of four children, and the only girl. When she was age two, her family moved to Los Angeles, where she has lived ever since. As a child, Alper had a phobia of touching others and of being touched, for fear that her touch was poisonous. By age four or five, she was drawing prolifically, and she found that drawing relieved her anxiety. Alper's parents hired visual artist Dorothy Cannon to tutor her in art. The lessons were in Cannon's home: a creatively decorated and inspiring place filled with music. For her students, Cannon read aloud nonsense verse by Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear. She worked with a variety of media, and introduced Alper to papier-mâché (a medium Alper was still using 50 years later). They made a mask together, and Alper continued making masks until she shifted her subject to people and the human form. Alper later attended an alternative school in Highland Park. In 1974, she began to learn puppet-making from marionettist Harry Burnett. Burnett, who was then in his mid-seventies, was spending his winter years teaching such skills to children, the elderly, and the disabled. \\"I made really intricate marionettes that took me months to finish,\\" Alper recalls. \\"I wanted to have control over something and I had control of my marionettes—but, oddly enough, I never played with them. I always gave them away shortly after I finished them.\\" In 1976, Alper enrolled at Immaculate Heart College, a Catholic private college in Los Angeles, but she was distressed by the way the nuns treated her. In 1978 she transferred to Los Angeles City College, where she continued her education in art until 1983. In the mid-1980s, when Alper was 27, she suffered a mental breakdown and lost the ability to speak, write, or think in words. Eventually she was able to communicate by rearranging pre-printed words. In 1994, faced with crippling depression, Alper opted for electroconvulsive therapy, which left her with some parts of her brain permanently damaged. Through all the changes in her life, Alper remained close to her first art teacher, Dorothy Cannon, until Cannon's death in 1999. When Cannon died, Alper was at her bedside holding her hand. Some years later, she studied with painter and professor Susanna Maing of Occidental College. She also approached Bolivian- American painter Tom Wudl. Alper had an upcoming show, and was feeling very anxious about it. She was also afraid that she had lost her creativity. \\"Tom promised me that we are creativity itself, and that he could help me find that in myself again,\\" Alper said. Wudl invited her to study under him at no charge. Since then, she has worked with Wudl for several years. Among Alper's art media are oil and acrylic paint, papier-mâché, clay, ink, and marker pen. When she eventually tired of papier-mâché, she began to study wood carving. She plays guitar and violin, and reports that all of her family members were musical. Her mother, she says, also aspired to be a painter, but hid her paintings from her children. ==CareerTeaching=== Alper taught alongside her mentor, Cannon, off and on from 1976 to 1995. In the late 1970s she was a teaching assistant at Area H Alternative School, one of the first alternative schools in Los Angeles. In 1986 she taught art on a voluntary basis to terminally ill teenagers at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. It was around this time that she met Marc Sirinsky, who was directing a theatre group called Imagination Workshop. His wife, Catherine Coulson (the \\"Log Lady\\" of Twin Peaks), became one of her students, and also a good friend. \\"I got to know Mindy… when I came to have her help me draw a log, and we really connected,\\" Coulson explains. During a period in 1992 when Alper lost the power of speech, Coulson acted as an intermediary to help her answer questions for an interview with Kristine McKenna. At the time of the interview, Sirinsky was working on a play intended to adapt Alper's drawings for the stage. Susan Arnold, a film producer and casting director, also met Alper through the Workshop. When she was producing Benny & Joon (1993), she arranged for Alper to help Mary Stuart Masterson prepare for her role as a mentally ill young woman who falls in love with a mime artist. Alper ceased giving private instruction in 2001. In 2006, she was a visiting artist at the California Institute of the Arts, for the benefit of an experimental drawing class there. ===Exhibitions=== From 1982 to 1989, Alper was active in the theatre: first as a member of a performance art and comedy group called the Love Machine, and then with the Buttersticks, a performance art troupe that she co-founded. In 1984, her papier-mâché work was featured in the journal Fiberarts. She has exhibited her paintings and sculpture in several community venues around Los Angeles. After an exhibition at Random Gallery of Highland Park in 1988, she returned for a solo show in 1994, called \\"Drawing on the Wrong Side of the Brain\\", followed by a few group shows in the late 1990s. Among her other solo shows are Raddack Gallery in 1987, and Sincere Technologies Gallery of Oakland in 1989. Rosamund Felsen Gallery of Los Angeles, which has represented her since 2006, hosted shows for her in 2006, 2007, and 2013. The 2006 and 2007 shows demonstrated Alper's drawings in ink and marker pen. In 2013, she exhibited alongside abstractionist painter Marcia Roberts. Alper's exhibit featured more than 20 pieces, including papier-mâché sculpture and ink drawing. In 2016 the gallery closed its space on Santa Fe Avenue in Downtown Los Angeles, and has operated as a website since then. The gallery's final group show, Celebration (2016), included three untitled Alper drawings in ink and marker pen. ===Illustration=== Chamber musician Jay Hosler is the nephew of Dorothy Cannon, Alper's mentor, and has known Alper since she was about five years old. When he and fellow musician Peggy Harrison began writing children's literature together, Alper agreed to illustrate their first story: a chapter book called Norm and Burny: The Black Square. The Black Square was published in 2013, and it includes 23 drawings. Its sequel, The Girl with the Gold Coin (2014), is also illustrated by Alper. In the books, Norm is a 12-year-old boy who goes on adventures with his (somewhat wiser) canine companion, Burny. ==Content== Alper's work is representational. While she sometimes paints or sculpts portraits, much of her output comprises line drawings and paintings that are expressive of her emotional state, or which evidence the workings of the unconscious. Her figures are human (or humanoid), and sometimes anthropomorphic. Cannon recalled that, as a child, Alper had \\"an unusual capacity for dipping into her subconscious and doing drawings from that point of view\\"; she described Alper's memory as \\"photographic\\". Journalist and art curator Kristine McKenna esteemed Alper's work from early childhood as \\"remarkably sophisticated in their technical polish and psychological complexity\\". Writing in 2018, film critic Richard Brody was impressed by Alper's ability to capture powerful emotion and potent memories with such precision and sincerity. He found her portraits to be \\"brilliant [and] moving\\". During a ten-year period when she lost the power of speech for long stretches, her work changed: \\"I was very prolific with my drawing,\\" Alper says, \\"and I think that I was telling more complete stories—maybe because I so desperately was trying to communicate.\\" ==Documentary== While studying at Tom Wudl Studio in the 2010s, Alper caught the attention of B. J. Dockweiler, a fellow painter and classmate. Dockweiler was fascinated by Alper's work and disposition. Dockweiler's husband, Frank Stiefel, was equally intrigued when he met Alper at a group show and saw some of her pieces. He talked with Alper occasionally, as they attended some of the same art openings. He asked if he could film her as she worked on one of her newest pieces: a monumental bust of her therapist, Shoshana Gerson. After a few months of filming, Stiefel interviewed Alper on camera; five more interviews followed, and Alper's story emerged. The film, Heaven Is a Traffic Jam on the 405, premiered at the Austin Film Festival in 2016, where it won the Jury Award and the Audience Award in the \\"Documentary Short\\" category. The Jury Award qualified the film for an Academy Award nomination. At the 90th Academy Awards in 2018, it won the Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject). ==NotesReferences== * ==Further reading== * Category:1959 births Category:American women painters Category:Artists from Brooklyn Category:American women sculptors Category:20th-century American women artists Category:21st-century American women artists Category:Jewish American artists Category:Living people Category:Los Angeles City College alumni Category:Artists with disabilities Category:Sculptors from New York (state) ","title":"Mindy Alper"},{"id":"56762268","text":"The Triflers may refer to: *The Triflers, 1920 silent American film directed by Christy Cabanne *The Triflers, 1924 silent American film directed by Louis Gasnier ","title":"The Triflers"},{"id":"56762287","text":"Nalchar (Vidhan Sabha constituency) is one of the 60 assembly constituencies of Tripura a Northeastern Indian state.

Formerly a puppeteer, she is the author of the children's series The Grimstones, which won the APA Book Design Awards ‘Best Designed Children’s Series in 2013. ==Life and career== She was born in Melbourne, the eldest of eight children, being nicknamed Asphyxia by one of her brothers when she was a teenager. Being the eldest and creative from a young age, she took it upon herself to create magical words of mystical creatures in which she enrolled her younger siblings and cousins to be a part in. She attended a hearing school, and didn’t learn Auslan until she was 18, as her parents wanted her to have a high standard of education, and were not satisfied with the standard of the education for the deaf. As a child, she had dreams of being a ballerina, but they disintegrated once it became clear her deafness prohibited this as a professional career, and after the Australian Ballet School turned her down because of her deafness. Instead, once she left school, she turned to circus, joining Circus Oz, specialising in the trapeze and hula-hoops. Here she discovered she could incorporate her deafness into her work rather than trying to hide it, realising it could enhance what she did. One of the ways she did this was by signing karaoke, which was a big success with her audiences. Towards the end of her career in Circus Oz, Asphyxia discovered puppetry through Sergio Barrio, a master puppeteer, whom she discovered when overseas touring with Circus Oz, and begged him to teach her his craft. She then leapt into it whole heartedly, learning how to make her own puppets and sets for them. After some experimentation, she ended up with a gothic family which she named ‘The Grimstones’. She then left the circus to travel around Australia performing with her puppets, which was a big success, and captivated children and adults alike. After a couple of years of touring with her puppet family, Asphyxia got a call from the publishers Allen and Unwin, who told her that someone had thought that ‘The Grimstones’ would make a great book. She embraced the idea, as she had always had aspirations to be an author, entering her first book when she was 12 in the St Kilda Writer's Festival where it won first place! In February 2012 she published the first of four, 'Hatched'. The next three in the series ‘Mortimer Revealed’ (April 2012), ‘Whirlwind’ (December 2012) and ‘Music School’ (December 2013) soon followed. Asphyxia currently lives in a small cottage she built herself when she was just 22, with her partner and son. She enjoys painting and other forms of artwork, which she shares with the world through her online blog. She is focused on raising her son, and living sustainably, and owns chickens and other animals. ==WorksLiterary works=== *Hatched: The Grimstones 1 (February 2012) *Mortimer Revealed: The Grimstones 2 (April 2012) * Whirlwind: The Grimstones 3 (December 2012) * Music School: The Grimstones 4 (December 2013) * The Grimstones Collection (July 2015) == References == Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Writers from Melbourne Category:21st-century Australian women writers Category:Deaf writers Category:Australian puppeteers Category:Australian women children's writers Category:Australian children's writers ","title":"Asphyxia (author)"},{"id":"56762317","text":"Frederick Arthur Laws (21 July 1877 – 1 April 1954) was a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Wellington in New Zealand from 1897 to 1910, and one match for Hawke's Bay in 1898.

The dorsal sepal is erect or bent upwards, long, wide. The lateral sepals are greenish, linear to lance-shaped, long, wide and turn downwards, more or less parallel to each other. The petals are erect or curved backwards, have a dark brown stalk long with a blade long and wide. The labellum is egg-shaped, long and wide with side lobes long and about wide. There are two parallel ridge-like calli about long near the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from October to December. ==Taxonomy and naming== Diuris brevifolia was first formally described in 1922 by Richard Sanders Rogers who published his description in Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia. The specific epithet (brevifolia) is derived from the Latin words brevis meaning \\"short\\" and folia meaning \\"leaves\\". ==Distribution and habitat== The short-leaved donkey orchid grows in a variety of habitats including heath, forest and woodland but is most common around the edges of swamps and river flats. It only occurs to the south of Adelaide and on Kangaroo Island. ==Conservation== There has been a large decline in the distribution and abundance of this donkey orchid in recent years and is listed as \\"endangered\\" in South Australia. The main threats to the species are incompatible land use and infrequent fire. ==References== brevifolia Category:Orchids of South Australia Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Plants described in 1922 ","title":"Diuris brevifolia"},{"id":"56762818","text":"Humayma, also spelled Humeima, is the modern name of ancient Hawara.HUMEIMA Copyright 2002.Ghazi Bisheh , 2018. 2018.\\"Humayma\\" in Discover Islamic Art, Museum With No Frontiers.

It was started as an attempt at the military light utility truck market (the \\"jeep\\" market segment). The vehicles in the series are greatly reminiscent of the FMC XR311, and is in turn reminiscent of the Humvee (U.S. Army HMMWV). The series expanded into the luxury sport utility market, and its primary production run was the Lamborghini LM002, which sold over 300 units. It is considered the pioneer of the luxury sport utility market, all other comparable vehicles being utility rather than luxury. This chassis family existed from 1977 through 1993. ==Models== * Lamborghini Cheetah, prototype military light truck (1977) US-Italian joint venture * Lamborghini LM001, prototype offroad truck (1981) * Lamborghini LMA002, offroad truck concept vehicle (1982) * Lamborghini LM002, production model offroad utility truck (MY1986-MY1993) generally with the powerplant of the Lamborghini Countach * Lamborghini LM003, prototype military light truck (1987) * Lamborghini LM004, prototype ultraluxury offroad truck ==Successors== Several successors to the Lamborghini Militaria were mooted. In 1997, MegaTech, then owners of Lamborghini, initiated a project to create a new vehicle in the luxury SUV segment as successor to the LM002, codenamed LM003 (though this model number was already previously used), it would be called the Borneo or Galileo; and be similar to a Range Rover; as an Indonesian joint venture with Timor. The vehicle was designed by Nori Harada's team at SZ Design (formerly Zagato), which also built a mockup. In 2006, Lamborghini again tried to resurrect its SUV segment, with the Lamborghini Lagartijo (LM005). This would use the powerplant from the Lamborghini Murcielago in a chassis similar to the LM002. In 2010, Lamborghini, then owned by the Volkswagen Group, started the LM00X project that would become the Urus, with an Audi Q5 platform and Audi S7 V8 Turbo. In 2012, they unveiled a concept car, the Urus; which was similar to a Porsche Cayenne and Bentley Bentayga. The Urus concept vehicle would evolve into the 2019 production SUV Lamborghini Urus. ==References * LAMBO Cars, Off Road Line Up ==See also== * Lamborghini Urus (MY2019-onwards), the successor to the original Lamborghini SUV. * Toyota Land Cruiser * Toyota Mega Cruiser, civilian and military jeep * Land Rover Range Rover, civilianized derivative of military jeep * Mercedes-Benz G-Class (Geländewagen or G-Wagen), civilianized military jeep * Hummer H1, civilianized military jeep (the Humvee) Category:Luxury sport utility vehicles Category:Military light utility vehicles Category:Off-road vehicles Category:Cars introduced in 1977 Category:Cars introduced in 1986 Category:1990s cars ","title":"Lamborghini Militaria"},{"id":"56762846","text":"Melvin Brown (March 5, 1932 – September 13, 2018)Herald Democrat was an American football coach and former player.

Behind him is a white background on which fragments of words, blurred, can be seen \\"Waterloo\\" is a post conservative American commentator David Frum made to his blog, FrumForum, on March 21, 2010. Earlier in the day the United States House of Representatives had passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), clearing the way for President Barack Obama to sign the sweeping health care reform into law. Frum took his title from an earlier prediction by South Carolina Senator James DeMint that the ACA would be a \\"Waterloo\\" for Obama and his presidency if Republicans could prevent its passage, much as they had done with Bill Clinton's similar efforts, which purportedly led to Republicans taking majorities in both houses of Congress in 1994. Frum called the bill's passage a Waterloo for Republicans, none of whom had voted for the bill or contributed to its passage in any way. But while their anger over that, he conceded, might indeed rally their base to retake Congress once again in that fall's elections, he counseled, the circumstances of the defeat did not augur well for the party's long-term prospects. Despite the ACA's deep unpopularity among Republicans, Frum warned that they would never be able to repeal it since its reforms were more popular with Americans than most Republicans acknowledged. He was specifically critical of talk radio hosts and Fox News for inflaming Republican opposition to the point that party leaders who otherwise wanted to do so were averse to cooperating with Obama and congressional Democrats who had sought the bill, since it was in those outlets' interest for government to remain dysfunctional no matter which party was in charge. The post became the most-read in FrumForum's history, drawing over a million views and crashing the site's servers. Many of the conservative outlets that had urged non-cooperation with Democrats on the ACA, such as The Wall Street Journals editorial page, were in turn critical of Frum. Within a week, he was asked to leave his fellowship at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), an influential conservative think tank, over the post. While some of his critics noted that he had barely been present there for the previous three years, Frum maintains his dismissal was in response to the anger he had aroused among conservatives. Some other critics called Frum's complaints about extremist rhetoric and efforts to enforce ideological orthodoxy among conservatives hypocritical in light of his own writings earlier in the decade, particularly a 2003 National Review cover story that attacked paleoconservatives, including many by name, as \\"unpatriotic\\" for, among other things, their refusal to support the Iraq War. After winning control of the House that fall, and the Senate in 2014, Republicans passed bills repealing the ACA, which eventually became popularly known as Obamacare, many times, none of which ever had the votes to overcome a veto. In 2017, after the election of Republican Donald Trump, the House passed the American Health Care Act, a bill intended to \\"repeal and replace\\" Obamacare, but the Senate never considered it. Almost seven years after his original post, Frum wrote that even though it was \\"my suicide note in the organized conservative world\\" he stood firm in his prediction, and urged Republicans to take a more cooperative role in health care reform. ==BackgroundHistorical politics of the American healthcare reform debate=== Since the beginning of the 20th century, progressives and later activists from the liberal and leftist side of the political spectrum had sought the establishment of universal health care through a mandatory government-run health insurance system or other programs. While these initiatives had often failed because most Americans who did have such insurance were accustomed to receiving it through their employers, the idea gained more traction with the public during the Great Depression, leading President Franklin D. Roosevelt to propose such a program as part of the New Deal. However, opposition from the American Medical Association (AMA) led to health-related provisions being removed from the Social Security Act prior to its 1935 passage. Harry Truman, Roosevelt's successor, included plans for universal health coverage in his 1949 Fair Deal program, which again failed in the face of AMA opposition. Shortly afterwards the Internal Revenue Service ruled that employer contributions to health-insurance plans for their employees was a tax-deductible business expense, making those plans the primary means of health care coverage for most American workers in the private sector. Reformers' attention thus turned to groups less likely to have access to that coverage, such as the poor and the elderly; Medicaid and Medicare, created in 1965 as part of the Great Society initiatives of another Democratic president, Lyndon Johnson, met the respective needs of those parts of the population. Opponents of national health insurance, and later Medicaid and Medicare, had attacked those proposals as \\"socialized medicine\\" and, after the onset of the Cold War, begun linking them to communism, arguing that even with limited programs there was not only a slippery slope from the government paying doctors to telling them how to do so, those programs themselves were the leading edge of a greater encroachment on all political freedoms. In the 1960s, those opponents began to include not just physicians but members of a nascent conservative movement, who believed that government had become too large and intrusive, not just in health care but in all aspects of life. In 1961 Ronald Reagan, who was elected governor of California five years later, released a recording of a speech he gave against further government involvement in health care, in which he warned that Medicare would be followed by \\"other federal programs that will invade every area of freedom as we have known it in this country until one day ... we will awake to find that we have socialism.\\" In 1964, Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, who had won his party's nomination with strong support from the conservatives, suggested that once Medicare was in place there would be programs for other benefits. \\"Having given our pensioners their medical care in kind,\\" he asked, \\"why not food baskets, why not public housing accommodations, why not vacation resorts, why not a ration of cigarettes for those who smoke and beer for those who drink?\\" Bills to introduce universal coverage continued to be introduced in Congress, primarily by Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy, but failed. Republican presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald Ford were opposed to all but the most modest expansions of existing programs, and Kennedy and his allies could not reach agreement with their successor, Democrat Jimmy Carter, later in the decade, on a plan even though he supported the idea in principle. Reagan defeated Carter in 1980; while he was not opposed in principle to universal coverage, he believed it should not be provided by national insurance, and Congress did not seriously consider any proposals for it under either his administration or that of his successor George H.W Bush. In 1992 another Democrat, Bill Clinton, was elected President. He had made securing universal coverage a campaign promise, and shortly after taking office began having his staff put together a bill to that effect. Opposition to the bill arose again from the industry and conservatives. Their arguments now included not just the cost of the program and the tax increases that might be necessary to fund it, or its impracticability, but a generally libertarian principle that the state should not be involved in providing citizens health care at all. Leonard Peikoff, heir to the estate of influential novelist Ayn Rand, who had promoted a philosophy of maximum individualism through her work, reiterated her argument in a speech to opponents that those unable to afford their own healthcare costs could and should rely on charity or the free market rather than make any claim on the labor of health care professionals through the government. There were nevertheless some Republicans in Congress who believed the problems with health care were real and that the country would benefit from addressing them. But conservative strategist Bill Kristol counseled Republicans to oppose the Clinton plan without reservation rather than work with the administration, primarily for long-term political reasons. If the plan passed, he warned, \\"[i]t will revive the reputation of the party that spends and regulates, the Democrats, as the generous protector of middle- class interests,\\" he warned. \\"And it will at the same time strike a punishing blow against Republican claims to defend the middle class by restraining government.\\" The bill ultimately died without even a committee vote, and Republican opposition to it was cited as a key reason the party retook control of the House in 1994 for the first time in 40 years, as well as the Senate, having made those elections a \\"referendum on big government\\". Opposition to big government and increased entitlement spending on health care did not prevent Republicans from adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare under the administration of George W. Bush in 2003. But when Democrat Barack Obama succeeded Bush in 2008, on a campaign promise of universal health care, Republicans once again united in opposition when Democrats, who had retaken the majority of both houses in 2006, began working on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Arthur C. Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a leading conservative think tank, cast the effort to block the ACA as a fight for the essence of American capitalism in the face of encroachment by European social democracy. Obama reached out to moderate Republicans for support, but none of them would reciprocate, fearful of possible primary challenges from the Tea Party, as the populist movement that arose in backlash to Obama's election and in particular the health care reform effort became known. Republicans believed that if they could prevent the passage of the ACA, they could damage the Obama presidency sufficiently enough to not only recapture Congress as they had done during Clinton's first term, but set the stage for a Republican victory in the 2012 election. In July 2009, a few months into the debate on the bill, South Carolina Republican Senator James DeMint said that it would be the new president's \\"Waterloo\\" if he failed to deliver and disappointed his base. The party leadership in Congress thus decided to oppose the ACA outright and not offer any amendments or work with the Democratic majority in any way, although some members were willing to do so. ===David Frum=== After getting degrees from Yale and Harvard Law School, the Canadian-born Frum became part of the conservative movement in the mid-1980s, serving as editor of The Wall Street Journals right-leaning editorial pages and later writing a column for Forbes. He aligned himself with the neoconservative faction of the movement, supporting an activist American foreign policy that confronted certain repressive foreign regimes. Frum was not afraid to criticize other factions, as he did in his 1994 memoir Dead Right, where he suggested that the movement should pay less heed to social conservatives and strict supply-side economics advocates. Frum was particularly repulsed by paleoconservatism, in which he saw strong antisemitic elements, defeatism, and a willingness to abandon core tenets of conservatism such as governmental restraint in favor of nationalistic or racialistic agendas. In a 1991 article in The American Spectator, he attacked Patrick Buchanan, a former Reagan speechwriter who would later challenge incumbent president George H.W. Bush for the Republican nomination, along these lines. After a stint as a speechwriter in the George W. Bush administration, he wrote another, broader critique of paleoconservatives in National Review, excoriating them for their eagerness to blame American Mideast policy for the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and opposition to the Iraq War, as well as the faults he had previously identified. In 2003, Frum accepted a fellowship at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a leading conservative think tank, and continued to write for National Review and other conservative publications. Four years later, after some disagreements with NRs other writers over the direction conservatism was taking, he began planning to leave to start a new website to reassert moderate Republicanism, which he hoped could be appealing to younger readers who were \\"often repelled by today's mainstream conservatism\\". In 2009 he launched it, first as New Majority, but within a year changed it to FrumForum to avoid confusion with other similarly- named organizations. During 2009, as the House debated the Affordable Care Act, Frum dissented from the blanket opposition of his conservative colleagues in and out of power. He argued that the bill, which included some ideas originally advanced by conservatives as alternatives to the 1993 Clinton plan and then used by Republican Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney for his state's universal coverage plan, offered some hope for conservatives who wanted to control the large increases in spending and taxation that might otherwise result from a plan fashioned purely by liberal Democrats. He also reminded Republicans that Democrats remembered 1993 as well as they did, and had the votes to pass a bill this time and, indeed, would. These efforts, Frum later recalled, increasingly alienated many of his longtime friends in the conservative movement. ==Post== alt=A man in a suit and tie sits at a wooden desk with two pieces of paper spread out in front of him. Behind him is a group of similarly dressed men and women; he is flanked by two young boys On March 21, 2010, the House passed the ACA as amended by the Senate. No Republican in either the House or the Senate had voted for it. The House vote was tantamount to passage, after more than a year of debate and deliberation; Obama would sign it into law two days later. That evening, Frum posted \\"Waterloo\\" to FrumForum. Nine years later he recalled writing the whole post in a half hour, in anger, as a cathartic response to accusations that he had sold out conservative principles He agreed with the general consensus among conservatives that it was their \\"most crushing legislative defeat since the 1960s.\\" However, while he agreed that it was possible that Republicans could retake their congressional majorities in that year's elections as a result, he was not entirely certain. The economy was slowly improving from the Great Recession that had begun two years earlier, and the benefits of the ACA would be reaching swing voters. But more problematically, Frum warned, \\"[t]his healthcare bill is forever.\\" And the fault for that, he continued, was largely conservatives' and Republicans' for refusing to compromise or negotiate. The notion that defeating the ACA would not only restore Republican control of Congress but consign Obama to a single term, he said, overlooked that Obama had been elected with 53% of the vote to Clinton's 42%, and that Democrats remembered the electoral consequences of the 1993 plan's failure. \\"[Again], we went for all the marbles, [but this time] ended with none.\\" Given the ACA's debt to ideas that had originated with conservatives, Frum wrote, Republicans could have certainly worked with Democrats to craft the ACA in some directions more amenable to conservatives, particularly given Obama's hope for a plan with bipartisan support. But they had missed their opportunity. The tax increases and Medicaid expansions Republicans had most strongly opposed were now law. alt=A group of people near a street corner in the background, seen from above head level. At the left one holds up a black-on-white sign saying \\"Obama Lies, Grandma Dies\\". Portions of other signs are visible and part of a Gadsden flag hangs from above the top of the image And even as Republicans promised that they would repeal the bill, Frum warned them they would never be able to due to the ACA's many popular features. \\"We followed the most radical voices in the party and the movement, and they led us to abject and irreversible defeat.\\" Those voices were the conservative talk radio hosts and Fox News panelists who had gotten their listeners and viewers to so fervently oppose the ACA that Republicans in Congress who had wanted to work with Democrats and possibly prevent those provisions from becoming law, had, instead, been too afraid of their supporters' anger to even attempt to do so. \\"How do you negotiate with somebody ... whom your voters have been persuaded to believe wants to murder their grandmother?\\" he asked, referring to the supposed \\"death panels\\" opponents alleged the bill would provide for, that would decide who could get lifesaving care. \\"The real leaders are on TV and radio\\" Frum charged. He noted how popular conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh had said he wanted Obama to fail, which he allowed was honest enough on Limbaugh's part, but accused Limbaugh of wanting the same fate for Republicans, since if they succeeded in governing effectively, the radio host's audience would be happier, and not need to listen to Limbaugh and those like him. The \\"conservative entertainment industry\\", had won as the party they professed to support had lost. \\"For them, it's mission accomplished. For the cause they purport to represent, it's Waterloo all right: ours\\", Frum concluded. ==Reaction== Traffic to FrumForum had previously peaked at around 25,000 unique visitors per day. \\"Waterloo\\" drew a million, eventually crashing the servers and making it impossible to view. However, writers at the editorial pages of Frum's former employer, The Wall Street Journal, were able to read it and post within a few hours an editorial accusing him of \\"peddling bad revisionist history that would have been even worse politics\\". On the other side, the White House Press Secretary's office tweeted the next morning a link to the post calling it a \\"very interesting analysis and VERY MUCH worth a read\\". ===Dismissal from AEI=== alt=A man with stubbly facial hair, glasses and slightly balding hair, seen from slightly below, stands before a thin microphone wearing a dark jacket, white shirt and dark tie against a dark background On the next morning, Frum got a call from AEI president Brooks. Frum was told that his fellowship, which paid him $100,000 a year with little responsibility on his part, was being terminated. He was offered the opportunity to stay on as an unpaid fellow, but declined. On the Wednesday following \\"Waterloo\\", Frum posted to his blog his letter accepting that his position at AEI had been terminated, implying that the decision had followed his discussion with Brooks. Frum did not blame Brooks himself for his dismissal, rather pressure from AEI's donors. \\"I think Arthur took no pleasure in this\\", he told Politico. \\"I think he would have avoided it if he possibly could, but he couldn't.\\" He reiterated one of the themes of \\"Waterloo\\", that the conservative movement's intelligentsia were in thrall to the passions of its base. \\"[T]he elite isn't leading anymore. It's trapped.\\" Bruce Bartlett, a George H.W. Bush administration official who had similarly lost a position at another conservative think tank, the National Center for Policy Analysis (NCPA), in 2005 after publishing a book critical of some Bush Administration policies, including the expansion of Medicare to prescription drug coverage, supported Frum's contention that pressure had been brought on AEI to conform to an ideological line. He told readers of his blog that Frum had, a few months prior, asked him if he had noticed any AEI scholars making any public comments about the ACA. When he said he had not, Frum speculated that they had been told to remain silent since \\"they agreed with too much of what Obama was trying to do.\\" Bartlett later clarified that while AEI's blog had published comments on the ACA, none of them were written by anyone at the institute who was known to specialize in health care. In their conversation, Frum had merely noted this, suggested that AEI was \\"punching below its weight\\" on the issue, and merely speculated that donor pressure might be leading its experts to remain silent in the debate. Some other conservatives differed with Frum's assessment of the reasons for his departure. They pointed out that even by Frum's own account, he had rarely even come into his office at AEI in three years, letting mail and packages pile up outside its door. Charles Murray, another AEI fellow, wrote on National Reviews group blog, The Corner, at what he believed to be the cost of his friendship with Frum, that Frum's account of the events that led to his departure was \\"beyond self-serving. It is a calumny against an organization that has treated him not just fairly but generously.\\" Murray called Frum's suggestion that donor pressure influenced AEI's employment decisions \\"fantasy\\". Frum had been \\"invisible\\" at the think tank for the previous three years, making only three posts to the group blog during that time and not participating in any other activities to further AEI's mission of spreading conservative thought. \\"Being a scholar at a think tank (or any institution) is not just a matter of acknowledging your affiliation in your books and op-eds.\\" He speculated that Frum's departure had more to do with his increasingly tenuous association with AEI than anything Frum had posted on his own blog. On the liberal website Salon, Gabriel Winant found Frum's story found it unlikely that AEI's donor base was composed of the \\"small-town, middle-class Republicans\\" such as those whose representatives in Congress had been most vehemently opposed to the ACA. However, he split the difference. Brooks' offer to Frum to continue at the think tank without pay did support Frum's contention that donors had expressed frustration with having to continue funding his increasing divergence from the conservative movement's steadfast opposition to the administration's healthcare reform efforts. Other commentators from outside mainstream conservatism, and on the left, were not entirely sympathetic to Frum. The American Conservative, an organ associated with the paleoconservatives whom Frum had denounced in National Review five years earlier, noted the irony of \\"[Frum] himself, now being purged\\", as did liberal commentator Matthew Yglesias. Winant too recalled that \\"Frum and his allies weren't just trying to drum some unsavory types out of the movement. They were also working at making it impossible for a Republican to oppose the party line on the crucial issue of the day.\\" In The Nation, Eric Alterman made no mention of Frum's 2003 piece. But he noted that Frum \\"ma[de] ... an extremely inconvenient martyr for liberals\\" due to his past enthusiastic support and justification for the Iraq War. However, Alterman agreed that his ostracism had come for \\"stating the obvious: that perhaps GOP leaders had screwed up their healthcare fight because they were listening to the wrong people.\\" Tunku Varadarajan In a lengthy response to \\"Waterloo\\" in his blog on The Daily Beast, Tunku Varadarajan, another former Wall Street Journal editorial page editor, sounded many of the same themes as Frum's other conservative critics. \\"I especially don't want lectures about excessive rhetoric from the man who wrote An End to Evil\\" he wrote, also citing Frum's 2003 attack on paleoconservatives as the sort of rhetoric he was now critical of. \\"Passionate 'extremism' is part of any political debate, and the more of it the better.\\" He derided Frum as a \\"polite-company conservative\\" who attacked his ideological compatriots to curry favor with Washington liberals; in that context he called Frum's post \\"paradigmatic\\". Varadarajan also disputed many of Frum's assertions that Republicans had mishandled the ACA to their long-term political detriment. He agreed that the bill would probably never be repealed, but countered that the unyielding Republican opposition was vital to maintaining the party's core principles of minimal governmental involvement in the economy and low taxation, especially after the passage of the Medicare prescription drug benefit. Not only would that principled opposition yield future electoral success, Varadarajan noted, it had affected the course of the ACA's passage when Republican Scott Brown unexpectedly won the Massachusetts special election to replace Ted Kennedy after his death, costing Senate Democrats the 60th seat they needed for cloture votes to prevent filibusters and forcing an expedited vote to pass a version of the bill that some of the party's liberals were not completely satisfied with. Responses from Frum and wife Frum responded to Varadarajan two days later on FrumForum, mostly taking issue with the \\"polite company conservative\\" characterization of him. He suggested Varadarajan's impression of the Washington insider culture Varadarajan accused Frum of seeking to ingratiate himself with was at odds with reality. That milieu \\"ceased to exist a generation ago, if it ever existed at all.\\" The idea that a conservative would inherently prefer the company of liberals betrayed an inferiority complex, Frum said. Varadarajan knew the truth about Washington, Frum wrote, and did not have to appeal to an outsider's imagination \\"from some Allen Drury novel\\". From their common experience of the Journals editorial page, Frum continued, Varadarajan should also have been well aware of which direction the stronger economic and social pressures on aspiring conservative intellectuals came from. He asked Varadarajan if, during his time there, he had been more afraid of: Frum's wife, Danielle Crittenden, defended her husband in a post to FrumForum. Without going into specifics or naming anyone, she decried the \\"dishonest slurs on his character and integrity by people who know him, and in some cases have known him for many years—truly ugly suggestions that David is motivated by cynicism or sycophancy, or both.\\" Sounding the same theme as her husband's original post, she admonished conservatives for becoming what they had once deplored: \\"The thuggish demagoguery of the Limbaughs and Becks is a trait we once derided in the old socialist Left. Well boys, take a look in the mirror. It is us now.\\" A day after Murray's suggestion that Frum had been fired by AEI for his increasing absence there, Frum posted a response to that as well, calling Murray's post \\"especially unpleasant\\". In Frum's account of his meeting with Brooks, the timing of which did not seem to him to be coincidental, the AEI president had denied to him that his vocal dissent from the hardline conservative opposition to the ACA had any relation to his action and felt bad about having to make the decision. But, Frum also said, Brooks told him \\"donors were becoming much more specific about where they wanted their money to go.\\" \\"Was I terminated for under-productivity?\\" Frum asked. \\"If you'll believe that, you'll believe anything.\\" He told readers he had, during his time at AEI, written three books, over a thousand newspaper and magazine articles as well as delivering many lectures and writing profusely online. He had also written speeches for politicians, and worked on a presidential campaign, without pay. Frum had also taking a leading role in opposing Harriet Miers' nomination to the Supreme Court. \\"Does AEI seriously suggest that it fired the man who led the battle that made possible Samuel Alito's confirmation to the Supreme Court because I didn't pick up my snail mail often enough?\\" Frum's response to Murray's suggestion that he had been uninvolved in the behind-the-scenes work of AEI offered further proof that politics had been behind his dismissal. At the 2009 AEI World Forum conference, which he had attended, Lynne Cheney took him to task for his increasing criticisms of Limbaugh. He had not been invited to the 2010 event despite, he claimed, getting several distinguished international guests to attend. Lastly, Frum argued, Murray was being personally hypocritical in some of his statements. He noted that Murray likewise admitted to not being present much at AEI either, due to the long commute from his Burkittsville, Maryland, home. \\"If that's a firing offense, I'll see him at the soup kitchen.\\" In a later update Frum also called out Murray for taking him to task for his minimal posting to the AEI blog on National Review's group blog. ==Since 2010== Seven years later, Frum described \\"Waterloo\\" as \\"my suicide note in the organized conservative world.\\" He has, however, said both at the time and two years later that he still considers himself a conservative. While he has not written for, or appeared on, any conservative media outlet since then, he has continued to write political commentary, merging FrumForm into The Daily Beast in 2012, and as a regular contributor to The Atlantic since 2014. He has on several occasions revisited \\"Waterloo\\". ===After 2010 election=== alt=A black-on-yellow sign saying \\"No deal! We want repeal!\\" Later in 2010, after Republicans retook control of the House. Many celebrated; some sent Frum emails taunting him with the apparent repudiation of his prediction that March. At CNN, Frum shared his response \\"Enjoy the moment, fellas. You are only at the beginning of the pain of discovering how right I was.\\" Frum argued that Republicans, tacitly acknowledging that they would never be able to repeal the ACA, now colloquially known as Obamacare, would instead resort to \\"a series of stunts\\", such as repeal votes, refusals to fund the gradual implementation of the law, votes to repeal curbs on future growth of Medicare that they would sell as \\"cuts\\" to the program, and hearings publicizing problems with the law's implementation with those adversely affected appearing as witnesses. Focusing on those problems, however, would allow the Democrats and the administration to point out that Republicans could have perhaps averted them by participating in the process, Frum wrote. \\"[A]t the end of two years, the law will still be there, more or less intact,\\" Frum predicted. Republican leaders in the Senate understood this, he noted, and were banking their hopes on retaking control of that house as well as the White House in 2012. But Frum doubted they could win enough Senate seats for a repeal vote to overcome a filibuster, and accused Republicans, as he had several months earlier, of caring more about the issue's efficacy in winning votes than actually changing the law. \\"As is, we're getting a bad trade: Republicans may gain political benefit, but Democrats get the policy,\\" Frum concluded. \\"That was my warning in March 2010. This election does not discredit that warning. It confirms the warning.\\" ===Before 2012 presidential election=== In late 2011, as the first primaries for the next year's presidential election were approaching, Frum revisited \\"Waterloo\\" in a long essay in New York elaborating on his criticisms of the direction the Republican Party had taken. He reiterated his arguments in the original post, telling readers that although the \\"cadre of sinister billionaires\\" they might imagine controlling the party did, to some extent, actually exist, they were merely financing the party's move in the direction Fox, talk radio and other conservative media had long been pushing it in. \\"In funding the tea-party movement, they are actually acting against their own longer-term interests, for it is the richest who have the most interest in political stability\\". Frum doubted that the Supreme Court would rule against Obamacare in a case then pending, as conservatives at the time had been hoping. \\"Such a decision would be the most dramatic assertion of judicial power since the thirties, and for that reason alone seems improbable\\" (Ultimately the Court upheld the programNational Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, ). And without that, any expectation that a Republican House, Senate and president could repeal Obamacare was a \\"mirage\\". After recounting his—and Bartlett's—expulsion from their respective institutions for their ideological apostasy, saying they were not the only ones to whom this had happened, he updated the reader on what had happened since then. While the loss of his AEI position did not affect him too much economically since he had other sources of income, he could not speak for others. \\"The message sent to [them] ... was clear: We don't pay you to think, we pay you to repeat.\\" Even before \\"Waterloo\\", he recalled, his vocal criticism of Limbaugh had effectively blacklisted him from Fox, and his volunteer speechwriting for one of that year's Republican presidential candidates had been kept a closely guarded secret within the campaign. The following June, after telling The Nation that he planned to vote for Mitt Romney in the election, Frum again defended \\"Waterloo\\". In a decade, he said, \\"when every conservative in Washington says the things I said, they will still blame me for saying them. And furthermore, they will always begin saying them with the phrase, 'Look, I have no regard for David Frum. I'm no David Frum.'\\" ===After 2016 presidential election=== alt=A hand-lettered sign saying \\"Save the ACA\\" held up by a woman standing in profile to the left. It blocks her facial features from view In 2014, Republicans recaptured the Senate; two years later, Donald Trump won was elected President on the Republican line. For the first time since the ACA had passed, Republicans had the political power to repeal it, legislation Trump had promised to sign while campaigning. But, in March 2017, two months after Trump took office and seven years after \\"Waterloo\\", House Republicans' effort to \\"repeal and replace\\" Obamacare, the American Health Care Act of 2017 (AHCA) appeared to have foundered due to a lack of consensus among Republicans as to what form a replacement should take. A month earlier, The Washington Monthly had recalled \\"Waterloo\\" and said that Frum was \\"[t]he one conservative who saw this coming.\\" Writing in The Atlantic that week, Frum recalled how many times since 2010, as Republicans won more and more elections, he had been asked if he was still sure Obamacare would never be repealed. The failure of the AHCA, he said, vindicated him as many Americans had benefited from Obamacare and Republicans had not offered them any alternatives. More than that, Frum argued, enough of the American public had come to accept the core principles of Obamacare since its enactment as to put Republicans in the minority of American public opinion on the issue. He again called on Republicans to take a more proactive role in shaping the future of American healthcare. Frum did not go so far as to say healthcare was a right, but called the United States' failure to ensure its citizens adequate coverage \\"a severe, unjustifiable, and unnecessary human wrong.\\" Making universal coverage a reality, Frum wrote, would accomplish many things conservatives would be proud of—increasing entrepreneurship as people would be more likely to leave their jobs and start business without the fear of losing their health insurance, improving the life expectancies of the white working-class voters who increasingly made up the Republican base, and reducing employment discrimination against workers more likely to incur higher healthcare costs, such as women and the elderly. Most importantly, Frum concluded, Americans would be less alienated as their country would finally have \\"joined the rest of the civilized world\\" in recognizing the importance of providing healthcare to all its citizens. ==NotesReferences *\\"Waterloo\\" at the FrumForum Category:Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Category:Conservatism in the United States Category:March 2010 events in the United States Category:2010 documents ","title":"Waterloo (blog post)"},{"id":"56763292","text":"Ali Asgar Lobi is a Bangladesh Nationalist Party politician and the former Member of Parliament from Khulna-2 and former president of Bangladesh Cricket Board. ==Career== Lobi was elected to Parliament in 2001 as a candidate of Bangladesh Nationalist Party from Khulna-2 in a by election.

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds an approval rating of 87% based on 103 reviews, with an average rating of 8.35/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \\"Anchored by Jurnee Smollett-Bell and Jonathan Majors' heroic performances, Misha Green's Lovecraft Country is a thrilling take on Lovecraftian lore that proves the Elder Gods aren't the only thing that goes bump in the cosmos.\\" On Metacritic, the series has a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Writing for The A.V. Club, Shannon Miller lauded the show's ability to balance Lovecraft's more problematic political views with \\"an appreciation for [his] unparalleled vision\\". Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com pointed to the show's use of genre storytelling \\"to peel back layers of American history to reveal the systemic problems underneath it\\", while also describing it as \\"marvelously entertaining\\". Hugo Rifkind of The Times described the show as \\"brutal and righteously furious\\". Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips, in reference to earlier, less successful attempts at adaptation of Lovecraft's works, said the show \\"succeeds where others have not\\" and commended the show on its themes, despite calling the five episodes available for early review \\"uneven\\". The New York Times' Mike Hale credited Green's \\"impressively seamless job... in wielding the cultural metaphors\\" as part of the show's strength. In a review for The Dispatch, Alec Dent praised the show's success at \\"examin[ing] racism in America’s past through an unexpected genre,\\" calling it a good reminder that \\"oftentimes true evil takes a normal guise\\". In a more critical review, Daniel D'Addario of Variety wrote that \\"the violence of Lovecraftian horror is so extreme [...] that even the most evil impulses of humanity seem an inadequate counterweight\\". ==NotesReferences * Category:2020 American television series debuts Category:2020s American drama television series Category:2020s American horror television series Category:2020s American supernatural television series Category:Adaptations of works by H.

Missouri's Class 1 United States Senate seat was also up for election on November 6, 2018. The primary elections for this race were held on August 7, 2018.

In California, the police may arrest a person: * for a misdemeanor crime if the police have probable cause and personally witnessed the crime occur in front of them or the police have a signed arrest warrant from a judge * for a felony crime if the police have probable cause that the person committed a felony, a statement from someone who witnessed the felony, or the police have a signed arrest warrant from a judge If the police are claiming that they have an arrest warrant, the defendant can demand to be shown it. If the police do not have the warrant with them at the time, they can still make the arrest, but they must show the warrant to the defendant \\"as soon as practicable.\\" === Citation instead of Arrest === Alternatively, instead of arrest the police may choose to issue a citation (i.e. \\"notice to appear in court\\") if the police believe the risk of the defendant not showing up to court for arraignment (see next section below) is low. The effect is the same as arrest, but the defendant does not have to be handcuffed and taken to jail and instead remains free as long as they go to their arraignment. If the defendant fails to appear in court for their scheduled arraignment, the judge will most likely issue an arrest warrant and the police will then go into the community, find the defendant, and take them into custody. === Search === After being arrested, the defendant may be searched by the police. If the police would like to search a person or their property before making an arrest, they must have probable cause to do so or a signed search warrant from a judge. A search warrant is different from an arrest warrant. === Interrogation === If the police want to interrogate the defendant, they must first read the Miranda warning to the defendant, advising them of their rights. The defendant does not have to answer any questions of the police. === Pre-Trial Custody === Upon arrest, the police will take the defendant to the local (city or county) pre-trial jail. This differs from state prison. Prison is for defendants that have been convicted of a crime after a trial and are now serving their sentence. After taking the defendant to jail, the police may decide to release the defendant with a notice-to- appear in court for their arraignment. The police cannot release the defendant on bail before the arraignment because the judge is required to set the bail amount. == Arraignment == After arresting the defendant, the police are required by law to bring the defendant to court within 48 hours (excluding court holidays) for the arraignment hearing. The arraignment is a very short court hearing. At the arraignment, the judge will: # Read what charges the District attorney has filed in court against the defendant (e.g. \\"You have been charged with violation of Section 243 of the Penal Code, Battery.\\") If the DA decides not to file charges against the defendant, then the defendant is set free. The judge may ask the defendant if they waive their right to hear the charges. If the defendant agrees to waive their right to hear the charges, the judge won't read what the defendant has been charged with. # Set the amount of money required for bail. By paying the bail bond, the defendant is released from jail, and the court will eventually provide the bail money back to the defendant as long as they continue coming to court. Bail is required to ensure the defendant will come back to court if they are released. When there is either a public safety risk (e.g. accusations of violent crime) or a risk that the defendant won't show up to court (e.g. the defendant has a history of not showing up to court), the judge will deny bail and require the defendant to stay in custody. Bail is initially set according to the bail schedule but can be adjusted depending on individual circumstances, such as income. It is also possible that the judge will allow the defendant to leave jail without any bail (i.e. \\"released on recognizance\\") if the judge has strong confidence the defendant will show up to court and has no threat to the local community. The judge will also consider if the defendant has any local ties to the community. For this reason, it may be helpful if the defendant's family and/or friends attend the arraignment so the judge may take their presence into consideration. # Inform the defendant of their rights, including their right to a Criminal defense lawyer. If the defendant cannot afford to hire a defense attorney, the judge will refer the defendant to the public defender. The public defenders are criminal defense lawyers who are paid by the state of California. # Ask if the defendant would like to plead guilty, not guilty, or no contest. The defendant can ask to enter a plea later so that they don't have to decide right away. The district attorney will frequently offer a plea bargain. == Preliminary examination == If the defendant was charged with a felony, they have a right to a preliminary examination. If the defendant was charged only with a misdemeanor, they have no right to a preliminary examination but may make a motion (i.e. a request) for one. At the preliminary examination, the defendant and the criminal defense attorney can challenge the legality of the arrest. For example, they can claim the police did not have probable cause to arrest the defendant. If successful, the defendant is set free. == Pre-trial  Setting the Date for Trial === Defendants in California have the following statutory Speedy Trial rights. * To have their trial begin within 60 days of their arraignment if charged with a felony * To have their trial begin within 30 days of their arraignment if charged with a misdemeanor and they are in custody of the police (i.e. in jail) * To have their trial begin with 45 days of their arraignment if charged with a misdemeanor and they are out of custody of the police (i.e. out of jail) These rights exists for several reasons. Most importantly, they exist to ensure defendants do not stay in jail for months and years waiting for a trial. Defendants are frequently asked if they would like to waive their speedy trial rights. To waive a right means to give it up. One reason why the defendant may want to waive their speedy trial rights is so that they can have time perform their own investigation by an independent third-party which may produce different results from the investigation done by the police. The results of the third-party investigation can then be presented at trial to the jury. === Discovery === Discovery is the process of exchanging documents between the District Attorney and the Defense Attorney that may contain evidence. In California, the District Attorney is required to turn over everything they plan to present at trial at least 30 days ahead of time, as well as any evidence that might help the Defendant show that they are innocent (see Brady disclosure). The Defense Attorney is not required to give incriminating evidence to the District Attorney, but must also turn over whatever they plan to present at trial at least 30 days ahead of time. === New Public Defender === If the Defendant is having a problem with the Public Defender and would like a new one, they can tell the court they are making a \\"Marsden motion.\\" The court will then have a special hearing, called a Marsden hearing, where the District Attorney is not allowed to be in the room. There, the Defendant can explain how the Public Defender is not being helpful and the judge can decide if the Defendant should be given a new attorney. === Self- Representation === A defendant may choose to act as their own attorney by making a Faretta motion. This should be done as early as possible because making such a motion close to the trial date gives cause for the judge to deny the motion. == Trial  Jury Selection === Jury selection is a lengthy process in which the District Attorney and the Defense Attorney take turns asking questions to potential jurors. Both sides can disqualify jurors that they think won't help them. The process ends when both sides find 12 jurors plus one standby juror that they both accept, or both sides run out of juror challenges. Each side can disqualify 10 potential jurors each without giving a reason to the judge. After 10 challenges, they have to show good cause (i.e. give a reason) to continue disqualifying potential jurors. === Opening Statements === Since the Defendant is assumed innocent until proven guilty, the District Attorney has the burden of proving their case, so they make the first opening statement that summarizes the evidence they will present at trial. They summarize their point of view of what happened and why they believe the jury should find the defendant to be guilty of the crimes charged. The Defense Attorney can then make their opening statement, or choose to reserve their opening statement until the District Attorney rests their case. === Prosecution's Case === The prosecution calls all the witnesses one by one. Witnesses are not allowed to sit in the courtroom, and must wait outside until they are called to testify on the stand. Each time the District Attorney calls a witness for Direct examination, the Defense Attorney is allowed to ask questions as well of the same witness as part of Cross-examination. After the District Attorney has called all their witnesses and presented all of their evidence, the District Attorney announces they rest their case. This means they are finished explaining why they think the defendant is guilty. The prosecution must prove their case beyond reasonable doubt. This means the evidence must be so convincing that there is no doubt left in the minds of the jury that the defendant is guilty and that the only way for them to doubt the evidence is to make \\"unreasonable\\" assumptions. (i.e. maybe aliens from Mars put the murder weapon in the defendant's car.) It is the highest standard of proof used in American law. === Defense's Case === The Defense Attorney then calls all of their witnesses. The Defense Attorney can call new witnesses as well as witnesses that the District Attorney called. After the Defense Attorney asks questions to the witness as part of Direct examination, the District Attorney can also ask them questions as part of Cross-examination. The Defense Attorney's strategy will be either to undermine the District Attorney's claims (i.e. say that the DA has failed to prove their case by poking holes in their theory and undermining the credibility of the witnesses and evidence) or to present an \\"affirmative defense\\" (i.e. actively prove the Defendant is innocent by introducing their own evidence, such as a video showing the Defendant was out of town when the crime happened.) The Defense Attorney could also do both. === Defendant's Testimony === The defendant has the absolute right to take the stand as a witness to testify (in self-defense) or not testify (avoid self-incrimination) at trial. The defendant's decision on this issue is of such importance that it cannot be overridden by a competing interest. (i.e. No matter what arguments are made by the DA or even the defense attorney, the defendant's choice to testify or not testify must be honored.) === Closing Statements === Each side then summarizes what happened during the trial and their final thoughts as to why the jury should vote guilty or not guilty. === Jury Deliberation === The jury is sent into a private room where they deliberate. All 12 jurors must vote guilty in order to convict the defendant. === Verdict === After the jury reaches a verdict, they return to the courtroom and the court clerk announces the verdict. == Sentencing == If the verdict is guilty, the judge gives the sentence for the crime. Criminal sentences can include any of the following, depending on the particular crime: *Fine *Restitution *Restraining Order *Imprisonment *Death === Probation === After deciding on a sentence, the court may also put the defendant on probation, especially if it is the defendant's first criminal conviction, the crime itself was not very serious, and the defendant's behavior indicates they have learned from the experience. When granted probation, the imposition of the sentence on the defendant is suspended and the defendant does not have to pay the fine or become imprisoned as long as they comply with the terms of their probation as set by the judge. Probation terms may include obligations to perform community service. If the terms of the probation are violated, the court can then impose the original sentence. == Appeal == In California, criminal defendants have the right to appeal both felony and misdemeanor convictions. If the defendant is convicted of a misdemeanor, they have the right to be released on bail pending the outcome of their appeal. Misdemeanor appeals are heard by the Appellate Division of the California Superior Court. Felony appeals are heard by the California Court of Appeal. Appeals from judgements of death are heard by the California Supreme Court. == References  External Links == * California Rules of Court for Criminal Proceedings California Category:Law enforcement in California Category:Crime in California ","title":"Criminal procedure in California"},{"id":"56763461","text":"Helichrysum milfordiae, Milford everlasting, is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family Asteraceae, native to South Africa.

The makers of the film were briefly engaged in a tussle over the naming rights of the film with the team of Kadhalum Kadandhu Pogum (2016). Both films were referred to by the media as Ka Ka Ka Po, a phrase taken from a popular dialogue from Chimbu Deven's Imsai Arasan 23rd Pulikecei (2006). Though both films had different expansions of the phrase, director Vijay stated that he was apprehensive that his film might suffer due to the confusion. Both films later released without any problem. For the film, Sakshi Agarwal underwent special training for stunt sequences, and also featured in a song, where she appeared in nine different get-ups. The song shoot for each look happened at different locations including Malaysia, Puducherry, and Hyderabad. The makers cast thirty three comedians in the film to play small roles. The film's lead actor Keshavarajan Latchumanasami, who was debuting with the stage name of Kesavan, died in an accident in November 2015, before the release of the film. == Soundtrack Release== The film opened to negative reviews from critics, with a reviewer from The Times of India stating \\"with a story which has almost no scope to keep the viewers entertained, the flimsy narration and sluggish making rubs salt into our wounds.\\" The critic added \\"what is even more disappointing is the spectacle of a myriad talented comedians making ineffective appearances at regular intervals — all of them being wasted in inept roles\\". == References  External links == * Category:Indian films Category:2016 films Category:2010s Tamil-language films Category:Tamil-language films Category:Indian comedy films Category:2016 comedy films ","title":"Ka Ka Ka Po"},{"id":"56763714","text":"Commodore Babru Bhan Yadav, MVC (14 September 1928 - 22 January 2010), also known as B.B.

The Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Health confirmed that, \\"The Bill uses “assisted dying” to refer to both euthanasia and assisted suicide. Euthanasia refers to a patient being administered a lethal drug by a medical practitioner. Assisted suicide refers to a patient receiving lethal drugs at their request, which they take by themselves.\\" ACT New Zealand MP David Seymour entered it into the member's bill ballot on 14 October 2015. The bill passed its first reading on 13 December 2017, with 76 votes in favour, 44 opposed; its second reading on 26 June 2019, with 70 votes in favour, 50 opposed; and its third reading on 13 November 2019, with 69 votes in favour, 51 opposed. A binding referendum will be held in conjunction with the 17 October 2020 general election on whether the Act should come into force. If the majority vote in favour of the Act, it will come into force 12 months after the official result is declared. If the majority vote against the Act (or there is a tie) and another referendum is not held, the Act will expire on 16 November 2024, five years to the day after it received the royal assent. ==Contents of the billEligibility for assisted dying=== Anyone may request assisted dying, but a person may receive it only if an attending medical practitioner and an independent medical practitioner confirmed that the person meets all of the following eligibility criteria: * They must be a citizen or permanent resident of New Zealand. * They must be aged 18 years or over. * They must suffer from a terminal illness that is likely to end their life within 6 months. * They must be in an advanced state of irreversible decline in physical capability. * They must experience unbearable suffering that cannot be relieved in a manner that they consider tolerable. * They must be able to make an informed decision about assisted dying. An \\"informed decision\\" is defined using the following criteria: **They must understand information about assisted dying. **They must retain information about assisted dying in order to make the decision. **They must use or weigh up information about assisted dying when making their decision. **They must communicate their decision in some way. ===Process of assisted dying=== A person who wishes to have an assisted death must inform an attending medical practitioner. The medical practitioner must complete a prescribed form after talking to the patient about the prognosis of their illness; the irreversible nature of assisted dying and its impacts; and alternative options for end-of- life care. The doctor needs to encourage the person to discuss their wish with others, but the doctor also needs to tell the person that they don't have to discuss it with anyone. The attending medical practitioner needs to \\"do their best to ensure that the person expresses their wish free from pressure from any other person\\". The doctor must do this by talking with other health practitioners who are in regular contact with the person and with family members approved by the person. If this doctor (or a nurse practitioner) suspects that a person \\"is not expressing their wish free from pressure from any other person\\", the process must be stopped. The person must confirm their request by signing and dating a prescribed form in the presence of this practitioner. The second part of the form may be signed by someone else if the person cannot write for any reason. Once the form has been completed the attending medical practitioner, and following that an independent medical practitioner, must confirm whether the person meets the eligibility criteria. If one or both medical practitioners are unsure about the person's mental competency, a psychiatrist must confirm whether the person is competent. specialist appointed by the SCENZ Group (Support and Consultation for End of Life in New Zealand Group). If eligible, the person can choose the date and method of administration of the lethal dose of medication. Once the medication has been administered the attending medical practitioner must complete a prescribed form notifying the registrar at the Ministry of Health that an assisted death has occurred. The registrar must then forward the form to a review committee. === Comparison with other jurisdictions === * The End of Life Choice Act allows assisted suicide and euthanasia, like Canada and Western Australia, The US laws allow only self-administration of the lethal dose (assisted suicide). Victoria allows euthanasia only if the person is unable to administer it themselves. * The person needs to initiate one request, which is confirmed in writing. The nine US assisted suicide laws, based on Oregon's Death With Dignity Act, require three requests: an oral request, a written request and a second oral request. * No independent witnesses are required when the request is confirmed in writing. In contrast, two witnesses are required in addition to the medical practitioner in Victoria (Australia), Western Australia, Canada, and the nine US assisted suicide laws. * No witness is required when the attending medical practitioner or nurse practitioner asks the person whether they still wish to receive the dose at that time. In Victoria a witness is required at this point. * No witness is required when the attending medical practitioner or nurse practitioner provides or administers the lethal dose immediately afterwards. In Victoria a witness is required at this point. * No cooling-off period is required before the lethal dose is prescribed. Hawaii requires a waiting period of at least 20 days between the first and third request. The other eight US laws require at least 15 days between the first and third request. Victoria and Western Australia require at least nine days. Canada requires at least 10 days. Oregon's law was changed in 2019 to allow the waiting period to be waived if the person is expected to die within this period. In Canada and Victoria the waiting period is also waived if the person is expected to die or lose mental competency within this period. * Only one person, the attending medical practitioner, needs to confirm that the person is making a voluntary request. In Oregon, both doctors need to verify \\"that the patient is capable, acting voluntarily and has made an informed decision\\". The other eight US laws have similar requirements. * Physical residence in New Zealand is not required. The US and Australian assisted dying laws require citizenship or permanent residence as well as ordinary (physical) residence. * Coercion by someone other than a medical practitioner is not an offence. Coercion is a punishable offence in Oregon and similar US laws. ==Legislative historyFirst Reading=== {  style=\\"width:40%;\\" + Voting at first reading (13 December 2017) - ! style=\\"width:20%;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Party !! style=\\"width:10%;\\" Voted for !! style=\\"width:10%;\\" Voted against - (56)  CCFFCC;\\"   FFAEB9;\\"  - (46)  CCFFCC;\\"   FFAEB9;\\"  - (9)  CCFFCC;\\"   — - (8)  CCFFCC;\\"   — - (1)  CCFFCC;\\"   — - ! colspan=2 Totals ! 76 ! 44 } ===Justice Select Committee=== Written submissions to the Justice Select Committee on the End of Life Choice Bill were received until midnight on 6 March 2018.

From Labour, Allan, Russell, Rurawhe, Whaitiri and Wood changed from voting for to voting against, while Williams voted for having previously opposed the bill. From National, Guy, Hipango, Tolley and Walker changed from for to against, while Collins and Yule decided to reverse their opposition. Five National MPs had entered Parliament since the first reading but had no net effect on the result- Willis (for) replaced Joyce (against) which was cancelled out by Bidois (against) replacing Coleman (for). ===Committee of the Whole House=== The Committee of the Whole House started on 31 July 2019. An amendment by David Seymour that limited eligibility to only those with a terminal illness was agreed to. Other amendments put forward by opponents of the bill were rejected. The End of Life Choice Bill was debated again on 21 August 2019. Parliament voted to accept Seymour's second round of amendments by a vote of 69 to 51. Key amendments include prohibiting a health practitioner from initiating any discussion about assisted dying, giving employment protections for any doctor, nurse, or psychiatrist who objects to taking part in the process on any ground, and a provision for doctors and nurses to stop the process if they suspect any pressure is being applied on the person seeking assisted dying. The amendments by MPs opposed to the bill including National MPs Maggie Barry, Paulo Garcia, Simeon Brown, and Chris Penk were defeated during the debate. Penk's proposal to have tighter provisions against coercion including getting a \\"sign-off\\" from a specialist panel was defeated by 71 to 49 votes. MPs also voted 70 to 50 in favour of the End of Life Choice Bill being given a third and final reading later. Proposed referendum On 23 October 2019, the New Zealand Parliament voted by a margin of 63 to 57 to amend the End of Life Choice Bill to include a binding referendum on whether the End of Life Choice Act 2019 should come into force. New Zealand First Member of Parliament Jenny Marcroft proposed an amendment to include a referendum on the grounds that euthanasia \\"directly affected the fabric of society\\" and that \\"temporarily empowered politicians... alone should not decide on the bill.\\" In response, Labour Member of Parliament Louisa Wall criticised NZ First for placing MPs who supported the bill but opposed the referendum in an \\"untenable position.\\" She also accused NZ First of using the proposed referendum as a bargaining chip for securing the party's support for the third reading of the End of Life Choice Bill scheduled for November 2019. {  style=\\"width:40%;\\" +Parliamentary vote on Jenny Marcroft's amendment for a referendum on the End of Life Choice Bill - ! style=\\"width:20%;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Party !! style=\\"width:10%;\\" Voted for !! style=\\"width:10%;\\" Voted against - (55)  CCFFCC;\\"   FFAEB9;\\"  - (46)  CCFFCC;\\"   FFAEB9;\\"  - (9)  CCFFCC;\\"   — - (8)  CCFFCC;\\"   — - (1)  CCFFCC;\\"   — - (1)  CCFFCC;\\"   — - ! colspan=2 Totals ! 63 ! 57 } === Third Reading === On 13 November 2019, the End of Life Choice bill passed its third reading 69 votes in favour and 51 votes opposed. The Bill is being prepared for royal assent. In return for New Zealand First's support of the bill through its third reading, the Bill will be decided by the public in a binding referendum at the 2020 New Zealand general election. The End of Life Choice Bill was also amended to only allow a person with \\"a terminal illness that is likely to end the person's life within six months\\" to request euthanasia. While Seymour disagreed with the legislation, he supported the amendment in order to maintain the support of the Green Party and several other MPs for a third reading. {  style=\\"width:40%;\\" + Voting at third reading (13 November 2019) - ! style=\\"width:20%;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Party !! style=\\"width:10%;\\" Voted for !! style=\\"width:10%;\\" Voted against - (55)  CCFFCC;\\"   FFAEB9;\\"  - (46)  CCFFCC;\\"   FFAEB9;\\"  - (9)  CCFFCC;\\"   — - (8)  CCFFCC;\\"   — - (1)  CCFFCC;\\"   — - (1)  CCFFCC;\\"   — - ! colspan=2 Totals ! 69 ! 51 } ==See also== *Euthanasia in New Zealand *Legality of euthanasia ==References * End of Life Choice Bill - text of the Act * End of Life Choice Bill on New Zealand Parliament website Category:2017 in New Zealand law Category:2018 in New Zealand law Category:2019 in New Zealand law Category:Proposed laws of New Zealand Category:Euthanasia in New Zealand ","title":"End of Life Choice Act 2019"},{"id":"56764182","text":"One Night (Norwegian: En natt) is a Norwegian drama TV series about two people meeting for the first time on a blind date, and follows them to the end of the date.

Having begun dancing at his mother's school at the age of nine, Simpson has been highly successful in local and international competition. He is one of the few Australians to win a title at Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne (the Irish Dancing World Championships), and has also performed professionally. == Personal life == Born in Canberra in 1994 to Irish dancing teacher Monica Simpson, Simpson grew up with his father, mother and sister. He played soccer and rugby league as a child during his education at Marist College, taking up Irish dance only after being \\"bribed\\" by his mother and sister into taking classes. He is currently studying a double degree in finance and economics at Australian National University. == Competitive career == Simpson took classes at his mother's Simpson Academy of Irish Dance from the age of nine. He won seven age group titles at the ACT Championships, as well as winning his section at the Australian Irish Dancing Championships in 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2017. In 2009, he competed at Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne, the World Championships of An Coimisiún Le Rincí Gaelacha, for the first time, placing third in his section. He returned in 2010 and 2013, placing third and fourth respectively. In 2013, after finishing his secondary education, Simpson spent a gap year in Belfast, Northern Ireland, training and competing with former world champion dancer Gerard Carson at the Carson-Kennedy Academy. That year, in addition to Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne, he competed in a number of other major international championships, including the All Scotland Championships and All Ireland Championships. After placing third at Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne in 2014 and second at the North American National Championships the same year, Simpson returned to Carson in Ireland for six weeks at the end of 2014. After a period of intense training, Simpson won the men's 20-21 years championship at Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne 2015 in Montreal, Canada, becoming only the sixth Australian to win an individual title at the World Championships. Simpson returned to the Worlds in 2017 after spending time as a professional dancer, placing third in the open age men's competition. His preparation for competition, though restricted by his university studies, had expanded to four dance classes a week in addition to a strength and conditioning program, totalling some 20 hours a week. == Performance career == In late 2015, following his competitive success, Simpson was approached by producers for the Australian tour of Irish dance show Lord of the Dance. He successfully auditioned along with another local male dancer, and was immediately flown to Adelaide to join the tour, which left Australia for Broadway shortly afterwards. == References == Category:Performers of Irish dance Category:1994 births Category:Australian male dancers Category:Competitive dancers Category:Living people ","title":"Conor Simpson"},{"id":"56764440","text":"The Kerala Women's Commission is a statutory body constituted under Section 5 of The Kerala Women's Commission Act, 1990.

With no formal training, he became a versatile and accomplished actor, and his roles included several Shakespearian parts; he was the first actor in the country to play Hamlet and King Lear. ==Early years in Australia== Knowles was born in England in 1810. His father John Knowles, a Wesleyan minister, \\"was induced to let his son indulge his natural disposition for travel and adventure\\"; Knowles was an early emigrant to the Swan River Colony (later Perth). The colony experienced difficulties and in April 1830 he arrived in Hobart Town, where he was a tutor of drawing and languages.\\"The late Mr Conrad Knowles\\" The Australian Daily Journal, 4 June 1844. He later moved to Sydney, where distant relatives lived. The Theatre Royal opened in 1832 and, although he had no theatrical experience, he became an actor at the theatre. He was unwilling to lose the friendship of his Wesleyan relatives, and at first appeared as Mr Cooper, but eventually he left the Methodist church. From the second season he used his own name; he was acting manager, and played melodramatic, tragic and comic roles. He played major Shakespearian roles; he was Australia's first Hamlet and King Lear. He was a favourite with Sydney audiences. Although he was criticized for not closely studying his parts, it was acknowledged that he played many roles and had managerial duties. He had a relationship with Harriet Jones, an actress who had appeared in Sydney since 1826; from 1839 she was usually known as Mrs Knowles. In May 1837 he sailed for England to join his brother's legal firm; he returned, for his health, in October 1838. Having seen William Macready and other notable actors in London, his subsequent acting was more refined. ==Rival theatres in Sydney== In 1838 the Royal Victoria Theatre opened in Sydney, and Knowles performed there, in 1840 becoming stage manager. He wrote a play, Salathiel, a dramatization of Leila; or, The Siege of Granada by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, and it was produced in 1842, being performed twice. In 1842 the Olympic Theatre, an elaborate tent created by Luigi Dalle Case for his circus performances, opened in Hunter Street. Knowles and Harriet moved there, and Knowles soon became manager After a few months they returned to the Victoria Theatre, where there was a new leading player with a professional background, F. Nesbitt McCrone. In May 1843 he moved to the Royal City Theatre, a small theatre in Market Street opened by Joseph Simmons, an actor- manager; however it closed after a few weeks.Sydney's lost theatres Dictionary of Sydney. Retrieved 5 March 2018.Australian Olympic Theatre Dictionary of Sydney. Retrieved 5 March 2018. ==Final year== Later that year Knowles, in Melbourne, opened a temporary 500-seat theatre, The Pavilion, in Bourke Street. On 4 September he produced Othello, the first Shakespeare play performed in the colony.Stanley Wells, Editor. Shakespeare Survey, volume 35. Page 31. Cambridge University Press, 2002. Knowles died on 19 May 1844, after a short illness. An obituary commented that since he began his acting career, \\"he has laboured... to advance the interests of the profession, of which he was so distinguished an ornament, with credit to himself and gratification to the play-going public, who have now to regret the loss of a sterling actor, and an accomplished but unfortunate gentleman.\\" ==References== Category:1810 births Category:1844 deaths Category:19th-century Australian male actors Category:Australian male stage actors Category:Male actors from Sydney ","title":"Conrad Knowles"},{"id":"56764596","text":"Elma Ann Bellini (November 11, 1954 - March 4, 2018) was an American judge who served on the New York Supreme Court. ==Background== Bellini was born in South Fork, Pennsylvania on November 11, 1954.

The suite consists of orchestrations of earlier short pieces for piano composed between 1908 and 1911. == Composition == The original piano pieces were created during Bartók's journey around Romania and Hungary, when he started collecting and arranging folk music that further transformed his somewhat Lisztian early style into the style he came to develop. Therefore, many of the compositions from this period were either based on folk music or created from scratch with a reasonable resemblance to folk music. However, neither money nor widespread fame would be plentiful in his lifetime, as he had to struggle with a moderate opposition in his country to his modern style and some of his major works, such as The Miraculous Mandarin, being banned for years. From the 30s onwards, Bartók started arranging some of his piano music for orchestral concert performance with the expressed intent of making money out of it. This was the case of his Transylvanian Dances, arranged from his Sonatina, and this set, which takes five pieces from works created two decades earlier. The set was completed in August 1931 in Mondsee. Pieces 1, 2, 3 and 5 were premiered in Budapest by the Budapest Concert Orchestra under Massimo Freccia on January 24, 1932. The first complete performance of the whole suite took place two years later, in November 26, 1934, with Heinrich Laber conducting the Philharmonic Society Orchestra. It was eventually published by Editio Musica Budapest in 1983 and arranged for wind quintet by Christopher Sears in 1985. == Structure == The suite consists of five movements and has a duration of 12 minutes. The movement list is as follows: Even though all of the pieces sound like original folk melodies, only the last one in the set uses genuine folk material. The suite follows a common practice by Bartók: using a slow central movement surrounded with two scherzos. The score calls for two flutes and piccolo, two oboes, two clarinets and bass clarinet, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, two trombones and tuba, timpani, xylophone, triangle, side drum, snare drum, cymbals, bass drum, harp, and a string section. == References  External links == * * Score hosted at Issuu by Casa Ricordi Category:Orchestral suites Category:1931 compositions Category:Compositions by Béla Bartók Category:Arrangement ","title":"Hungarian Pictures"},{"id":"56764679","text":"The Samuel J.

Players take on the role of a leader in an alternate-history late 19th century, in which they must build and maintain a city during a worldwide volcanic winter, managing resources, making choices on how to survive, and exploring the area outside their city for survivors, resources, or other useful items. The game features several scenarios to undertake, each with their own stories and different challenges. The game was initially released for Microsoft Windows in April 2018, but was later made available for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in October 2019. The game received generally positive reviews upon release and sold over 1.4 million copies within a year of its release. == Gameplay == The player character starts out with a small group of survivors that consists of workers, engineers, and children, and several small caches of supplies with which to build a city. From there players harvest coal, wood, steel and food in order to keep their society warm and healthy in the midst of constantly fluctuating temperatures. Weather conditions and political turmoil can cause citizens to not want to work as hard. In most scenarios save for 'On the Edge' the entire city is centered around the generator, a coal-reliant steam engine that produces heat in a circular radius, which can be extended and intensified throughout the game, requiring greater coal input. The game emphasizes the need to prioritize buildings depending on the heat they require; houses and medical facilities will require close placement to the reactor, lest the player face outbreaks of frostbite and illness. While houses can be insulated better throughout the game, medical facilities will need to be kept above -20°C, or face being inoperable. Workplaces will also need to be insulated, which can be achieved through gathering posts or steam turbines, or completely circumvented with the introduction of machine labor, or \\"Automatons\\". The player has the option to use laws to regulate the productivity of their society at the cost of possibly raising discontent, e.g. allowing child labour or forcing temporary 24-hour shifts, but also laws to develop better healthcare like prosthetics or extra rations to the sick. In most scenarios, the player also has the option to increase the citizens support either by \\"Order\\" which includes buildings and laws to enforce security, or by \\"Faith\\", which includes buildings and laws that implement a religion. These 2 paths can be continued to the point of fanaticism, with the \\"Order\\" path leading to a Militaristic Autocracy, while the \\"Faith\\" path leads to a total Theocracy. With the final law on either path, the Captain is proclaimed absolute ruler, and the hope mechanic is replaced with a constant value. In addition, the city executes one \\"Unbeliever\\", and the Player can choose to do so again should they wish to lower discontent. Adopting any of the last 3 laws of both paths will lead to the \\"Fanatic\\" ending, should the city survive, where the game remarks how Humanity crossed the line, and forsake its values in the quest for survival. 11BitStudios have mentioned multiple times that the Law system was designed to force players between the choice of survival or retaining humanity, creating a moral dilemma the game is based around. Technology is another gameplay feature, with the ever colder environment forces the city to adapt with better insulation, stronger reactors, better industrial output and more efficient machinery. Building a workshop structure allows the player to research technology and buildings that will make the city more efficient. The city can also construct a beacon to scout the surrounding frozen wasteland for additional survivors and resources. ==Plot== The game is set in an alternate 1886 where the eruptions of Krakatoa and Mount Tambora, the dimming of the Sun, and other unknown factors caused a worldwide volcanic winter. This in turn led to widespread crop failure and the death of millions. This event roughly lines up with the historical 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, a volcanic event that led to global cooling. In response to this, several installations called \\"generators\\" were built by the British Empire and United States in the coal-rich North, designed to be city centers in the event that dropping temperatures force mass migration from the south. In all scenarios, the player (known by the denizens of their city as \\"the Captain\\") is the leader of a city around a generator, and will have to manage resources to ensure the city's survival. The game launched with three scenarios, each with different backgrounds and storylines. Three additional scenarios were added as DLCs, one free to all players and two as part of the Season Pass. Endless Mode was also introduced in a later patch that eschews narrative elements to focus on surviving for as long as possible while weathering intermediate storms. ;A New Home In the main scenario, the player is the leader of a group of explorers who fled the cold and the hunger of London in an expedition to find supposed massive coal reserves in the North. Instead, the group gets separated from the main expeditionary party and discovers a massive heat generator in a giant sheltered crater and settles there, establishing the city of New London. The player begins to face the issue of the people's dwindling hope as they find out, through exploration, a city similar to theirs called Winterhome has been destroyed, leaving few survivors. The player has to make hard decisions in order to help the people find their purpose and stay hopeful, as well as prevent an uprising by those who wish to return to London. The player later also has to prepare enough supplies to make sure the city survives the ever decreasing temperature, starting at -20C, and slowly decreasing, with some spikes, to an average of -70C. After a certain time, and the conclusion of the Londoners Arc, refugees will arrive, warning of a \\"Great Storm\\" incoming, acting as an Endgame. The player will have to stockpile resources, collect refugees, and recall scouts and outposts before the Storm arrives. Coal mines become effectively inoperable due to the cold, the generator struggles to heat the people, frostbite becomes rampant, and hope falls as the temperature falls to -120C in the eye of the storm. Surviving the storm with at least one citizen will result in a \\"victory\\", though the consequences may vary. It is suggested that the severity of this storm, and its seemingly huge scale, means that New London is the last city on Earth. ;The Arks In the second scenario, the player is tasked as the leader of a group of scholars from Oxford and Cambridge responsible for establishing a self-operational city for the purpose of preserving seeds and plants from around the world from the volcanic winter. They settle around a generator located in an ice crevasse. During the gameplay, the player will be presented with the issue of a neighboring city struggling with resources, and will have to make a choice whether or not to help them prepare for the incoming storm. ;The Refugees In the third scenario, the player is set as the leader of a refugee group who have taken over a generator reserved originally for a large group of wealthy lords. The people had intended the city to be a place where everyone is equal, but in time the people will begin to divide into two separate social classes. The player will also have to deal with constant waves of refugees seeking shelter in the city, including the overthrown lords. The player will have to decide to accept them or reject them while also minding the limited resources they have access to. ;The Fall of Winterhome Released on September 19, 2018 as a free DLC, this scenario takes place just prior to the main scenario and centers around the city of Winterhome. Through ineffective management by a neglectful leader, resources ran dry and the city fell into anarchy and rioting. Hundreds die in the fighting, starvation, and cold. The player is tasked to rebuild what is left of the city and its residents, but after getting things under control, the player learns that the city's generator is damaged beyond repair, and has only a few days to put in practice an evacuation plan before the generator explodes. ;Endless Mode Introduced in Frostpunk's 1.3.0 patch, Endless Mode is a highly customizable scenario where players endeavor to build a city to survive for as long as possible. Unlike all the other scenarios, there is no major story or quest objective beyond surviving each winter storm as they come and the scenario only ends when the player loses (either the generator is destroyed or all the people die). Players can choose between two primary sub- modes and one of several different maps, each with different challenges players have to take into account while planning their city. The Endurance sub-mode features fewer available resources and harsher weather while the Serenity sub-mode grants the player most of the earlier technologies and enjoys shorter blizzards. An additional Temporary Hazards setting will also randomly plague players with severe setbacks that inhibit some aspect of their city for a limited time. ;The Rifts Released on August 27, 2019 as a DLC included in the Season Pass, The Rifts add a new map to Endless Mode and a new building - \\"The Bridge\\" - to cross over canyons. ;The Last Autumn Released on January 21, 2020 as a DLC included in the Season Pass, The Last Autumn is a prequel scenario set just before the onset of the global winter. The British Empire has created the Imperial Exploration Company to scout across the Atlantic Ocean to Canada for sites to construct generators; the player is the overseer of one such location, \\"Site 113\\", for the intended evacuation of Liverpool. While constructing their own generator, the player will also be called to investigate the loss of contact with Sites 107 and 120 (destroyed by shoddy workmanship and a syndicalist revolt, respectively), leaving the player's construction site as Liverpool's last hope. If the player takes too long in construction, they risk being fired by the IEC and sent home, ending the game. As the scenario progresses, the first snow begins to arrive and the sea freezes, cutting the site off from the supply ships, and the player must continue to work on the generator and wait out the freezing weather until an icebreaker can arrive to take them home to England. The scenario includes new technology trees and resources, new buildings (including a telegraph station, labour unions, and docks), new Books of Law to determine societal changes moving forward, and new threats to the settlement, including toxic gas leaks and worker strikes. The DLC also includes \\"The Builders\\", a new sub-mode for Endless Mode, which involves rebuilding a destroyed generator in winter conditions. ;On The Edge The final DLC content of the Season Pass, released on August 20, 2020, On The Edge is a sequel to the main scenario, including new challenges and game mechanics. The player is the leader of \\"Outpost 11\\", set up by a scouting party from New London near an abandoned army warehouse uncovered by the Great Storm. The outpost is forced to satisfy increasing demands for resources in exchange for food, reaching the point where the workers revolt and declare the outpost's independence from New London. Unlike other scenarios, the outpost has no generator (forced to rely on coal-fired braziers for heat, similarly to the later stages of The Last Autumn) and limited ways to produce resources locally, so they must must depend on trade with other settlements they make contact with to make ends meet. Later in the game, the outpost is informed that New London is in a severe crisis and must choose to provide aid and save the city, or leave it to its fate and prepare for a wave of refugees. The DLC also includes the option of including outposts and trading in all sub-modes of Endless Mode, along the option of triggering random events that will hinder the city's progress. == Development == The game was announced in August 2016. The developers were initially targeting a release in late 2017, but it was delayed until 24 April 2018. The game was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in October 2019. The game was developed using 11Bit Studios internal game engine named Liquid Engine. ==Reception== Frostpunk received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", according to review aggregator Metacritic. It was nominated for \\"Best Strategy Game\\" at the Game Critics Awards, for \\"Best Visual Design\\" and \\"PC Game of the Year\\" at the 2018 Golden Joystick Awards, and for \\"Best Strategy Game\\" at The Game Awards 2018.

He was the founder of the Panax Corporation and Global Communications, and the owner of \\"over seventy newspapers across the United States.\\" His ties to the apartheid-era South African government drew attention from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Michigan State University community, but his 1986 charges were dropped due to a five-year statute of limitation. He filed for bankruptcy upon his retirement. ==Early life== John P. McGoff was born in 1925. He spent his early years with his family, including six siblings, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where his father was a steel worker. During World War II, he served in the United States Army both in Italy and Africa. He graduated from Michigan State University in 1950. ==Career== McGoff began his career in media by working for MSU's radio station, WKAR-FM. He purchased his own radio station in Lansing, Michigan in 1958. He subsequently founded the Panax Corporation and Global Communications, and became the owner of \\"over seventy newspapers across the United States.\\" His newspapers took a decidedly conservative stance, promoting free enterprise. McGoff attempted to purchase The Washington Star in 1974 but his bid failed, and did his 1977 bid for the Oakland Tribune. McGoff was described as \\"a major apologist for the white supremacist government in South Africa\\" by the Detroit Free Press in 1975. He served as a founding member of the board of The Citizen, a South African newspaper with a pro-apartheid stance founded in 1975. In 1983, McGoff was accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission of purchasing The Sacramento Union for $6 million and acquiring a $1.3 million in the United Press International Television News via a \\"$11.3 million no- interest loan from South Africa.\\" His $500,000 donation to MSU for the dedication of a theatre in honor of his wife was returned after members of the MSU community objected to his ties to the apartheid regime the following year. In November 1986, he was charged on suspicion of being an \\"unregistered foreign agent for South Africa since 1974.\\" By December 1986, the charges were dropped by Federal District Judge Charles Robert Richey due to a \\"five-year time limit\\" as McGoff had cut his ties with the South African government in 1979. McGoff \\"filed for personal bankruptcy\\" in 1995 after the buyer of one of his newspapers, The Macomb Daily, failed to pay him. ==Personal life, death and legacy== McGoff married Margaret Ewert and they had five children.

Main Street in Lapeer, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. ==History== Columbus Tuttle arrived in Lapeer in 1853, and soon after constructed a house at this location. He founded a planing mill in Lapeer some time before 1860. The mill originally served the local market, but as Lapeer grew and the railroads were built through, Tuttle expanded to supply a wider market. As the lumber industry dwindled in the 1880s, Tuttle retooled his mill and began to produce finished and ornamental products. In 1890, Tuttle decided to construct a new home on this lot, and hired Daniel Wadsworth to build this house. Tuttle lived here until his death, after which the house was owned by Frank R. Cutting, another local lumberman. In 1948, the house was converted to doctor's offices. ==Description== The Columbus Tuttle House is a wooden Queen Anne structure with irregular massing on a stone foundation. It has multiple gables, and an exterior ornamented with sunburst panels, decorative shingling, fanlights, and stepped windows. The front facade has a slightly projecting bay; a porch, enclosed in 1905, abuts the projecting bay.

Factoran (G.R. No. 101083), often alternatively titled Minors Oposa v. Factoran or Minors Oposa, is a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippines which recognizes the doctrine of Intergenerational Responsibility on the environment in the Philippine legal system. The case is a contributor to the development of international environmental law. == Background and history == The Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and his predecessors have granted timber license agreements (TLA) to various corporations to cut the aggregate area of 3.89 million hectares for commercial logging purposes. Petitioners, through their parents, sought to make the DENR Secretary stop issuing licenses to cut timber, invoking their right to a healthy environment pursuant to Sections 15 and 16 of Article II of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines. The petitioners further asserted that they \\"represent their generation as well as generations yet unborn.\\" They further claimed that the Secretary committed grave abuse of discretion in granting TLAs to cover more areas for logging than what is available. Respondent, on the other hand, filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint had no cause of action against him and that it raises a political question. The Judge of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati sustained the dismissal and ruled that granting of the relief prayed for by petitioners would result in the impairment of contracts which is prohibited by the Constitution.JUAN ANTONIO, ANNA ROSARIO and JOSE ALFONSO, all surnamed OPOSA, minors, and represented by their parents ANTONIO and RIZALINA OPOSA, ROBERTA NICOLE SADIUA, minor, represented by her parents CALVIN and ROBERTA SADIUA, CARLO, AMANDA SALUD and PATRISHA, all surnamed FLORES, minors and represented by their parents ENRICO and NIDA FLORES, GIANINA DITA R.

THE HONORABLE FULGENCIO S. FACTORAN, JR., in his capacity as the Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, and THE HONORABLE ERIBERTO U. ROSARIO, Presiding Judge of the RTC, Makati, Branch 66, respondents; G.R. No. 101083; 224 SCRA 792; July 30, 1993. == Decision  Doctrine of intergenerational responsibility === The Court did not agree with the arguments of the respondent. The complaint focuses on one fundamental legal right — the right to a balanced and healthful ecology which is incorporated in the Constitution. It carries with it the duty to refrain from impairing the environment and implies, among many other things, the judicious management and conservation of the country's forests. Section 4 of E.O. 192 expressly mandates the DENR to be the primary government agency responsible for the governing and supervising the exploration, utilization, development and conservation of the country's natural resources. Such policy is also substantially re-stated in the Administrative Code of 1987. Both E.O. 192 and Administrative Code of 1987 have set the objectives which will serve as the bases for policy formation, and have defined the powers and functions of the DENR. Thus, right of the petitioners to a balanced and healthful ecology is as clear as the DENR's duty to protect and advance the said right. The Court found no difficulty in ruling that they can, for themselves, for others of their generation and for the succeeding generations, file a class suit. Their personality to sue in behalf of the succeeding generations can only be based on the concept of intergenerational responsibility insofar as the right to a balanced and healthful ecology is concerned. Such a right, as hereinafter expounded, considers the \\"rhythm and harmony of nature.\\" The Court further elicited that every generation has a responsibility to the next to preserve that rhythm and harmony for the full enjoyment of a balanced and healthful ecology. == Aftermath == After the decision, the Philippine government had inventoried the remnant old growth forests and restricted logging in those areas. The case is recognized in its contribution in the development of international environmental law. In 2008, Antonio Oposa, a Filipino Lawyer, was awarded y Center for International Environmental Law for his contributions to the development and implementation of international environmental law in his native country and internationally. ==References== * alt= This article incorporates text from Philippine Supreme Court documents, which are in the public domain.

They do not only leak the entered digits, but also the order at which they were entered. Analysis of heat traces using computer vision can yield even more accurate results compared to visual inspection by the naked eye. A thermal attack (aka thermal imaging attack) is an approach that exploits heat traces to uncover the entered credentials. These attacks rely on the phenomenon of heat transfer from one object to another. During authentication, heat transfers from the users' hands to the surface they are interacting with, leaving heat traces behind that can be analyzed using thermal cameras that operate in the far-infrared spectrum. These traces can be recovered and used to reconstruct the passwords . In some cases, the attack can be successful even 30 seconds after the user has authenticated . Thermal attacks can be performed after the victim had authenticated, alleviating the need for in-situ observation attacks (e.g., shoulder surfing attacks) that can be affected by hand occlusions. While smudge attacks can reveal the order of entries of graphical passwords, such as the Android Lock Patterns, thermal attacks can reveal the order of entries even in the case of PINs or alphanumeric passwords. The reason thermal attacks leak information about the order of entry is because keys and buttons that the user touches first lose heat over time, while recently touched ones maintain the heat signature for a longer time. This results in distinguishable heat patterns that can tell the attacker which entry was entered first. Thermal attacks were shown to be effective against plastic keypads, such as the ones used to enter credit card's PINs in supermarkets and restaurants , and on handheld mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets . In their paper published at the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2017), Abdelrahman et al. showed that the attack is feasible on today's smartphones.

The process of compressing air raises its temperature and concentrates atmospheric contaminants, primarily water vapor. Consequently, the compressed air is generally at an elevated temperature and 100% relative humidity. As the compressed air cools, water vapor condenses into the tank(s), pipes, hoses and tools that are downstream from the compressor. Water vapor is removed from compressed air to prevent condensation from occurring and to prevent moisture from interfering in sensitive industrial processes. Excessive liquid and condensing water in the air stream can be extremely damaging to equipment, tools and processes that rely on compressed air. The water can cause corrosion in the tank(s) and piping, wash out lubricating oils from pneumatic tools, emulsify with the grease used in cylinders, clump blasting media and fog painted surfaces. Therefore, it is desirable to remove condensing moisture from the air stream to prevent damage to equipment, air tools and processes. The function of removing this unwanted water is the purview of the compressed air dryer. There are various types of compressed air dryers. These dryers generally fall into two different categories: primary, which includes coalescing, refrigerated, and deliquescent; and secondary, which includes desiccant, absorption, and membrane. Their performance characteristics are typically defined by flow rate in Standard Cubic Feet per Minute (SCFM) and dew point expressed as a temperature, (sometimes referred to as Pressure Dew Point.) == Applications == Water contamination is an inherent byproduct of compressing atmospheric air. Because of this phenomenon, compressed air systems usually benefit from the addition of a compressed air dryer located on the output of the air compressor and/or at various locations throughout the distribution system. In most cases, the output of the compressor is processed through a primary dryer or system dryer. In cases where higher quality air is required the output of the primary dryer is further processed through a secondary dryer or polishing dryer. ==Characteristics== * A regenerative desiccant dryer typically delivers a dew point of between −40 °C (−40 °F) and −73 °C (−100 °F) * A refrigerated dryer delivers a dew point not lower than approximately 2 °C (35 °F) * A deliquescent dryer delivers a dew point suppression that fluctuates with air temperature. Typically this suppression is 11 °C (20 °F) below the compressed air temperature. == Coalescing filters == Schematic representation of a two-stage coalescing filter set. Coalescing filters aren’t actually filters, rather they operate more as a consolidation element. The idea behind these devices is that the compressed air is forced through gaps or porosity within an otherwise solid element. These gaps and/or porosity are microscopic and small enough that water vapor wets to the internal surfaces. The liquid water that forms during the wetting process is forced through the media and drips down into a trap. The dry air travels up to and out of the discharge port. There are two basic types of coalescing elements. The first type utilizes a cast material that is dominated with an internal microscopic lattice. The air is forced to flow through the lattice which, in turn, allows the water vapor to wet to the internal surfaces. The second type is generally referred to as a stacked plate element. In this case, fine discs are stacked with microscopic gaps between them. The air is forced to flow through the gaps which, in turn, allows the water vapor to wet to the internal surfaces. In principle, a coalescing filter is an ideal way to separate water from the compressed air stream. Practically speaking, this is not the case. Coalescing elements are extremely sensitive to oil and particulate contamination and therefore would be better placed as a second stage dryer. However, the dew point performance of a coalescing filter places it in the primary category of compressed air dryers. In order to use coalescing filters as primary dryers, they are typically set-up in pairs. The first filter has an element with larger gaps that are designed to remove oil from the stream. The second filter uses a finer element that is intended to remove water vapor. Because of the sensitivity of the elements, coalescing filters are not particularly common. One area where these filters have found acceptance is with dental compressors. The way that dental compressors are designed and used makes a two-stage coalescing filter an almost ideal solution for water contamination in these systems. == Refrigerated dryers == Basic schematic of a Freon-based refrigerated compressed air dryer Illustration of a typical commercial Freon-based refrigerated compressed air dryer Rotary-screw air compressor equipped with a Freon-based refrigerated compressed air dryer Sectional illustration showing the internals of a JT type compressed air dryer. Two-stage air compressor equipped with a JT type refrigerated compressed air dryer. Refrigerated dryers are the most common type of compressed air dryer. They remove water from the air stream by cooling the air to approximately 3 °C (38 °F) and effectively condensing out the moisture in a controlled environment. 3 °C (38 °F) is the realistic lower limit for a refrigerated dryer because a lower temperature runs the risk of freezing the separated water. They are typically specified as primary dryers and generally produce air quality that is appropriate for approximately 95% of all compressed air applications. Refrigerated dryers employ two heat exchangers, one for air-to-air and one for air-to-refrigeration. However, there is also a single TRISAB heat exchanger that combines both functions. The compressors used in this type of dryer are usually of the hermetic type and the most common gas used is R-134a and R-410a for smaller air dryers up to 100 cfm. Older and larger dryers still use R-22 and R-404a refrigerants. The goal of having two heat exchangers is that the cold outgoing air cools down the hot incoming air and reduces the size of compressor required. At the same time the increase in the temperature of outgoing air prevents re-condensation. Some manufacturers produce \\"cycling dryers\\". These store a cold mass that cools the air when the compressor is OFF. When the refrigeration compressor runs, the large mass takes much longer to cool, so the compressor runs longer, and stays OFF longer. These units operate at lower dew points, typically in the 1.5 °C - 4.5 °C (35 °F – 40 °F) range. When selected with the optional \\"cold coalescing filter\\", these units can deliver compressed air with lower dew points. Non- cycling dryers use a hot gas by pass valve to prevent the dryer from icing up. Some manufacturers produce \\"cold coalescing filters\\" that are positioned inside of the air dryer at the point of the lowest air temperature (the point at which maximum condensation has occurred)., Refrigerated dryers are generally manufactured in one of two different ways, Freon based units and Joule-Thomson based units. === Freon-based refrigerated compressed-air dryers === These dryers derive their cooling from a closed cycle refrigeration system based around one of three commercial refrigerants, R-22, R-134a or R410a. The refrigeration system these dryers use is similar to home and commercial air conditioning systems. The schematic shown to the right illustrates a typical Freon-based refrigerated compressed air dryer. Freon-based refrigerated compressed air dryers generally consist of a heat exchanger that is similar to a water cooled after cooler. Instead of using water as the coolant, liquid CFC fills the shell of the heat exchanger. The liquid CFC is maintained at a pressure that allows it to boil at 3 °C (38 °F). After the CFC boils, the vapor is drawn through the suction line into a compressor, which compresses the CFC to a high pressure and high temperature. The high pressure/temperature CFC is cooled in the condenser and relaxes into its liquid state. The liquid is reintroduced into the heat exchanger via the metering device and a closed refrigeration cycle is formed. When the compressed air passes through the heat exchanger, it is cooled to the temperature of the boiling CFC. As the compressed air is cooled, it loses its ability to retain moisture and the water vapor condenses onto the inside of the exchanger tube. Variations on this basic design include units equipped with reheating exchangers, which are intended to improve efficiency. In these cases, the cooled compressed air is reheated by the incoming air. Refrigerated compressed air dryers typically have a Remaining Oil Content of 6 mg/m3.KONAN  Air Cleaning System Refrigerated compressed air dryers with internal cold coalescing filters are rated to leave the remaining oil content as low as 0.008 mg/m3, which is far less than coalescing filters that are downstream of air dryers, because the cooled compressed air is reheated by the incoming air. Larger refrigerant dryers have air-to-air heat exchanger between warm incoming air and chilled outgoing air. Cooled oil and water fogs coalesce much better in a coalescing filter at the cold temperatures than one in the warmer oil and water vapors located downstream of the air dryer air-to-air heat exchanger.SPX  HES Series  Compressed Air Coalescing Filter Performance  {  + style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Type !! scope=\\"col\\"  LOCATION !! scope=\\"col\\"  Solid Particles, microns !! scope=\\"col\\"  PPM !! scope=\\"col\\"  mg/m3 !! scope=\\"col\\"  Temperature, typical - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Cold  Inside  0.01  0.006  0.008SPX  HES_Series Page 5, Column 2, Paragraph 3, last sentence  36 to 42 deg F - ! scope=\\"row\\"  General Purpose  After  1.0  0.4  0.5BCAS  The Filtration and Drying of Compressed Air, Best Practices  Page 19 (26 of 67)  75 to 100 deg F - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Standard  After  3.0  3.6  4.0SPX  HES_Series Page 5, Column 2, Paragraph 3  75 to 100 deg F - } Coalescing Filters collect liquids and aerosols, not vapors, see the Mechanical Coalescers section at Coalescer.

These units are designed to allow excessively hot compressed air to be effectively dried. Compressed air temperatures in excess of 38 °C (100 °F) are very common in Southern climates, mining operations, steel mills, shipboard, etc. In areas and applications that demand operations in elevated ambient temperatures, high temperature dryers are a necessity. Cycling dryers (also known as thermal mass dryers) utilize a thermal mass, usually a tank of water, to store the energy produced by the refrigeration system. The temperature of the water controls the refrigeration system through a thermostat. The compressed air passes through the thermal mass via a water cooled heat exchanger. The value of this type of configuration is that they normally produce more consistent cooling results. === Joule–Thompson (JT) based refrigerated compressed air dryers === JT type dryers are units that utilize the compressed air stream as their refrigeration element. High pressure compressed air (150~175 PSI) is fed into a pressure reducing valve on top of the dryer. The output of this valve (90–120 PSI) is directed into an expansion chamber which is surrounded with porous walls. As the air expands to a lower pressure, it becomes cold (based on the Joule- Thomson Effect) and its ability to retain moisture is reduced. The moisture is released from the air in the form of fog. The fog laden air then passes through the porous walls of the chamber. The micro-droplets of water that make up the fog wet to the porous material and collect until they form droplets that can be affected by gravity. The water then drops into a trap and the dried air travels up to and out of the discharge port. The drawback of the JT Dryer is that it can only be used with two-stage compressors. This is because a two-stage compressor derives its efficiency by pumping to a high pressure (150–175 PSI.) This pressure is inappropriate for the shop floor and must be dropped to (90–120 PSI.) The JT Dryer takes advantage of this pressure drop to remove moisture from the compressed air stream through the inherent refrigeration based on the Joule-Thompson effect of the expanding air. Leveraging this pressure drop allows a JT dryer to produce the same relative dew points that Freon-based dryers produce. == Deliquescent dryers == Deliquescent dryers typically consist of a pressure vessel filled with a hygroscopic medium that has a high affinity for water vapor. Practically speaking, these dryers are Schematic representation of a deliquescent compressed air dryer. typically a large pressure vessel that is filled with salt crystals. When water vapor comes in contact with the salt, it attaches and dissolves the media, or deliquesces. As liquid water builds on the salt crystals, brine is formed, which drains down and collects in the bottom of the vessel. Periodically, the brine must be drained and similarly, the media must be refilled. Typically, deliquescent dryers will produce a dew point suppression of 10 °C to 14 °C (18 °F to 25 °F). On the plus side, these dryers are very simple, have no moving parts and do not require electrical power. However, they do not perform well with high temperature air streams and/or in high ambient temperatures. They are disproportionately large units which are filled with a corrosive substance. Their size and corrosive nature can present problems with any system that uses them. Because of this, these dryers are typically used only in specialty applications. Common applications often involve remote, hazardous, or mobile work sites. Deliquescent dryers are used for removing water vapor from compressed air, natural gas, and waste gases such as landfill gas and digester gas. The performance of a deliquescent dryer, as measured by outlet dew point, is highly dependent on the temperature of the air or gas being processed, with cooler temperatures resulting in better performance == Desiccant dryers == Schematic representation of a twin tower desiccant compressed air dryer. Desiccant dryers, sometimes referred to as absorption dryers, operate by absorbing water vapor into a porous media with a high affinity for water. These types of dryers are also referred to as absorption systems or getters. Because these dryers get and hold the water, they are minimally effective as a first stage dryer. If a desiccant is used in this role, the media quickly becomes saturated and the effectiveness of the dryer is negated. Desiccant dryers are best applied in a second stage or polishing role. They are usually used down-stream from a refrigerated dryer or some other primary dryer. When applied as a second stage dryer, they can easily and reliably produce dew points in the sub zero range. Desiccant dryers are typically supplied in two patterns, “Single Canister” and “Twin Tower” units. Single canister units have the outward appearance of a filter housing. However, they are filled with a granular media that must be periodically replaced. The media can be regenerated by baking it at a high temperature in accordance with the manufacturers’ recommendations. Single canister desiccant dryers are typically installed in point-of-use applications. When applied as a second stage dryer, they can easily and reliably produce dew points in the sub-zero range. A variation on the single canister desiccant dryer is the Toilet Paper filter. These types of filters provide the same basic function as a desiccant dryer except they use an ordinary roll of toilet paper as their absorption media. When the toilet paper becomes saturated, it is removed and replaced with a fresh roll. The popularity of these filters is primarily based around their low cost, convenience and effectiveness. Surprisingly enough, these types of filters are very effective in point-of-use roles. Twin Tower, or regenerative desiccant dryers, have two vertical tanks filled with media. The compressed air is passed through a pressure vessel with two \\"towers\\" filled with a media such as activated alumina, silica gel, molecular sieve or other desiccant material. This desiccant material attracts the water from the compressed air via adsorption. As the water clings to the desiccant, the desiccant \\"bed\\" becomes saturated. When the media in the first tank becomes saturated, the air stream is automatically redirected through the second tank. The first tank is then heated while a portion of the dried air, referred to as the purge air, is back flowed through the tank and vented to atmosphere. This process dries, or regenerates, the media in the first tank and makes it ready for the next redirect. One of the most significant drawbacks of twin tower desiccant dryers is their use of the purge air. Typically, a twin tower desiccant dryer uses some 15 to 20% of its capacity to regenerate the opposite tank, making these dryers inefficient and costly to operate. The task of the desiccant is to bring the pressure dew point of the compressed air to a level in which the water will no longer condense, or to remove as much water from the compressed air as possible. A standard dew point that is expected by a regenerative dryer is −40 °C (−40 °F); this means that when the air leaves the dryer there is as much water in the air as if the air had been \\"cooled\\" to −40 °C (−40 °F). Required dew point is dependent on application and −70 °C (-94 °F) is required in some applications. Many newer dryers come equipped with a dew dependent switching (DDS) which allows for the dryer to detect dew point and shorten or lengthen the drying cycle to fulfill the required dew point. Oftentimes this will save significant amounts of energy which is one of the largest factors when determining the proper compressed air system. The regeneration of the desiccant vessel can be during three different methods: * Heatless \\"pressure-swing\\" drying, which uses part of the dry compressed air coming from the other vessel to dry the desiccant in the vessel being regenerated at lower pressure. 17-20% purge rate * Heated dryer, which uses a hot air blower, so there is no loss of compressed air. >7% Purge Rate. * Heat of compression, which can only be used with an oilfree compressor. == Membrane dryer == Schematic representation of a membrane type compressed air dryer. Membrane dryer refers to a dehumidification membrane that removes water vapor from compressed air. Membrane dryers operate on the principle of migration. The compressed air to be dried is passed over a membrane that has a high affinity for water vapor. The water vapor builds on the membrane and migrates through to the opposite or low pressure, side. A dry cover gas is flowed across the low pressure side and absorbs the water on the membrane. After absorbing the water, the cover gas is discharged to the atmosphere. The cover gas is generally taken from the output of the dryer. The membrane is typically a series of small tubes collected in a bundle within an outer housing. Some dryers are non-porous, which means they only permeate water vapor. Non-porous membranes' drying power is only a function of flow rate, pressure. The sweep flow is strictly controlled by an orifice and is not a function of temperature. Porous membranes are modified nitrogen membranes and pass air as well, usually changing the composition of the compressed air by reducing the oxygen content. The only maintenance required is changing the prefilter cartridge twice a year. The performance of porous membranes are dependent on temperature as well as operating pressure and flow. Membrane air dryers depress the incoming dew point. Most dryers have a challenge air dew point and pressure specification. So if the inlet dew point is lower than the specified challenge air then the outlet dew point is even lower than specified. For example, a dryer could be rated at a -40 °C (−40 °F) dew point with a challenge of 21 °C (70 °F) dew point and 100 psig. If the incoming air has an inlet dew point of only 0 °C (32 °F), the outlet dew point will be somewhat less. Pressure also plays a role. If the pressure is higher than the rated specification then the outlet dew point will be lowered. This lowering of the outlet dew point is due to the longer residence time that the air has inside the membrane. Using the spec above, an operating pressure of 120 psig will yield a lower outlet dew point than specified. The extent of the improvement is dependent on the nature of the membrane and could vary among manufacturers. Membrane air dryers are designed to operate continuously, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Membrane air dryers are quiet, reliable and require no electricity to operate. If set up and operated properly, membrane dryers can produce extremely low dew points. For this reason they are very common in laboratories, medical facilities and specialty manufacturing environments where limited amounts of high quality compressed air is required. They are usually set up as a point-of-use dryer and provide the best service when used in a second or third stage role. The delicate nature of the equipment and how it is used makes them generally unsuitable for more mainstream or industrial applications. Membrane air dryers are used in pneumatic components, spray painting, laser plenum purge, air bearings, air spindles, medical equipment, air guns and pneumatic brakes for vehicles and trains. ==References Books === * Elliott, Brian S.

She entered the family business as a saleswoman of second-hand dresses, serving theatres in London, and as a result met the actress Gertrude Lawrence, who introduced her into London society. Her lovers, prior to her marriage, included Tom Mitford and American millionaire Stephen \\"Laddie\\" Sanford. She met Browne, then Viscount Castlerosse, when he was working in London, and married him mainly for his social position. They were married on 16 May 1928, and she was thereafter styled Viscountess Castlerosse, becoming familiarly known in society as Doris Castlerosse. Soon afterwards she embarked on an affair with Randolph Churchill, son of the future prime minister. The viscount and viscountess were childless, and divorced in 1938, with Robert Heber-Percy, a well-known homosexual whom she was allegedly trying to \\"cure\\", named as co-respondent. Her other lovers included society photographer Cecil Beaton, and possibly Winston Churchill himself. Churchill's former private secretary, Jock Colville, revealed his knowledge of the affair with Churchill in a 1985 interview with Correlli Barnett, stating that Churchill had met Doris on holidays in the South of France at a villa owned by actress Maxine Elliott. Doris was one of many women whose portraits were painted by Churchill. However, Churchill's biographer Andrew Roberts has rejected the idea that they had an affair. In 1940, Doris went to the United States, where she found it difficult to resume her earlier career as a courtesan. In 1942, she obtained Winston Churchill's assistance to return to the UK. On her return she was met by her ex-husband, who, according to some sources, hoped to make a fresh start in their relationship. In debt and no longer socially in demand, she died of an overdose of sleeping pills at the Dorchester Hotel, in London’s Park Lane.

This is achieved through continuous monitoring and adjustment of tribosystems, resulting in increased machine efficiency and lifetime. == Definition == Tribotronics refers to the combined use of tribology and electronics to control tribological systems. Tribotronic systems are designed to improve efficiency, reliability and lifetime of machine elements by active control of tribosystem inputs (such as force, torque, rotational speeds, etc.), outputs (such as motion, changes in energy, etc.) and losses (such as friction, wear, vibrations, etc.). This is in contrast to traditional tribological and mechatronic systems, where losses are seen as a function of system inputs rather than desired set-points. While the term was originally coined with a particular emphasis on the control of tribological losses, it is increasingly used to describe any active system that combines tribological and electronic components, irrespective of the process variables and set-points of the control loop. == Design of tribotronic systems == One way to design tribotronic systems is to build control loops around passive machine elements (such as gears, fluid bearings and rolling-element bearings) in order to create active machine elements. Relevant process variables (tribosystem inputs, outputs, losses and structure) of the control loop may include: * flow rates of lubricants or other pressurized fluids * physical properties of lubricants and pressurized fluids, such as viscosity and density * the molecular composition and ordering of lubricants and pressurized fluids, both in the bulk fluid as well as close to contacting surfaces * dynamics of the mechanical system * mechanical properties of the contact bodies, such as stiffness and hardness * properties of contacting surfaces, such as surface energy, surface charge, electrical resistance, surface texture, surface geometry and surface roughness * progression of surface wear * friction losses == References == Category:Tribology ","title":"Tribotronics"},{"id":"56765083","text":"Slug (stylised as SLUG) is the solo musical project of Ian Black.

It was redefined as P. béii in 2010 after its Ribosomal RNA was characterized, revealing it to be a relative of the genus Symbiodinium. Symbiodinium is a well-studied endosymbiont of deep water invertebrates, protists and foraminifera, found especially alongside reef-dwelling organisms. ==Ecology== The P. béii contains a single straight elongated apical vesicle with a row of small knobs, eight latitudinal series of amphiesmal vesicles, and a Type E eyespot. When not living as a symbiont the species is able to enter a motile stage. Like Symbiodinium, P. béii is a member of the Suessiales order, which lack thecal armored plates. P. béii is hosted by at least four foraminifera: G. ruber, G. conglobatus, G. sacculifer and Orbulina universa. ==See also== *Globigerina bulloides ==References== Category:Dinoflagellates ","title":"Pelagodinium béii"},{"id":"56765309","text":"Alexander Kincaid Mackenzie (1768-1830) was a 19th-century Scottish merchant who served as Lord Provost of Edinburgh from 1817 to 1819. ==Life== The grave of Alexander Kincaid Mackenzie, New Calton Burial Ground He was born in Edinburgh in 1768.

Genesee Street in Lapeer, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. ==History== Phineas and Enoch White were two of Lapeer's original pioneering settlers. Jay White, one of their descendants, was born in 1869. This house was apparently constructed for him and his wife, Emma Gale, in 1899 or 1900, when the couple was in Hanover, Germany, serving as US Consul. It was then sold to George H. Cary, the owner of the Marshall Hotel and Livery. A later owner was Raymond T. Carpenter, a clothing merchant. ==Description== The Jay White House is a two-story brick and shingle residence. It is a unique and individualized architectural style, with primarily Romanesque Revival influences. The roof of the house is steeply pitched in the front, running upward from above the front entrance between two side towers. The recessed front entrance porch is reached through a wide but shallow arch, framed with split fieldstones. The massive, squat towers are topped with conical roofs and copper finials. The first floor level is clad in brick, which changes to shingles on the upper portions of the side facades. The windows in the house are all double-hung with the upper sash one-half the height of the lower. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Lapeer County, Michigan Category:Romanesque Revival architecture in Michigan Category:Houses completed in 1899 ","title":"Jay White House"},{"id":"56765331","text":"\\"Roxy Roller\\" is a song written and originally recorded by Sweeney Todd in 1975 with Nick Gilder on vocals. It was written by Jim McCulloch and Nick Gilder. In total four versions of the song were released in 1976: * the original one at London Records, cat. no. L 2590, released in Canada only, * a solo version recorded by Nick Gilder released at Chrysalis Records in various countries outside Canada in 1976, * a version by Sweeney Todd with newly recorded vocals by new lead singer Clark Perry on London Records, cat. no. 5N-240, released in various countries outside Canada. * a version by Sweeney Todd with newly recorded vocals by new lead singer Bryan Adams on London Records, cat. no. 5N-244, released in the U.S. only. ==Canadian success story== The original version did chart big in Canada, entering during May 1976: the song spent three consecutive weeks at number one in Canada during June and July of 1976. By that time Gilder and McCulloch both had already left the band to pursue a solo career. The song is ranked as the fifth biggest Canadian hit of 1976. \\"Roxy Roller\\" won a Juno Award for the band. ==USA reception== At first the song didn't catch up with the American public, and Gilder took a chance recording a solo version of the song (released at Chrysalis Records) which however did have a simultaneous release date as the rush release of Sweeney Todd's newly recorded version on which new singer Clark Perry sang lead vocals. Chrysalis Records which had contracted Gilder demanded on his behalf as songwriter imported copies of the original Sweeney Todd's version as well as the newly recorded version to be withdrawn from the market in the U.S. Record stores duely took both singles released by the incarnations of Sweeney Todd from the shelves. However, the two re-recorded versions of \\"Roxy Roller\\" did chart on the Billboard Hot 100. The first cover version with vocals by Clark Perry peaked at #90 and at #97 in the Cash Box Top 100 in late August of 1976. A second re-recorded version which had vocals by Bryan Adams peaked at #99 in mid-September 1976. Obviously these confusing conditions did prevent any of the four versions of \\"Roxy Roller\\" to get enough promotion hence attention in the U.S., at a time when glam rock sounding songs were quite popular. ==Chart historyWeekly charts=== ;Nick Gilder original {  - !Chart (1976) !Peak position - Canada RPM Top Singles  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1 } {  - !Chart (1977) !Peak position - Australia (Kent Music Report)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"29 } ;Clark Perry re-record {  - !Chart (1976) !Peak position - U.S. Billboard Hot 100Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955–1990 -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"90 - U.S. Cash Box Top 100 align=\\"center\\"93 - } ;Bryan Adams re-record {  - !Chart (1976) !Peak position - U.S. Billboard Hot 100Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955–1990 -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"99 - } ===Year-end charts=== ;Gilder {  - !Chart (1976) ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Rank - Canada  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"5 - } ;Perry {  - !Chart (1976) ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Rank - US (Joel Whitburn's Pop Annual)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"466 } ;Adams {  - !Chart (1976) ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Rank - US (Joel Whitburn's Pop Annual)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"525 } ==Cover versions== * \\"Roxy Roller\\" was covered by Suzi Quatro in 1977.https://www.discogs.com/artist/227475-Suzi- Quatro?subtype=Singles-EPs&filter;_anv=0&type;=Releases&page;=2 * The song was covered by Jaded Past in 2014. ==References(Clark Perry vocals) * (Bryan Adams vocals) Category:1975 songs Category:1976 singles Category:1977 singles Category:Bryan Adams songs Category:Nick Gilder songs Category:Songs written by Nick Gilder Category:London Records singles Category:RPM Top Singles number-one singles ","title":"Roxy Roller"},{"id":"56765349","text":"The Hamburg Cove Site is a prehistoric archaeological site in Lyme, Connecticut.

This species is restricted to the western North Pacific in the seas around the Japanese Archipelago. ==Description== Gonatopsis japonicus is a squid with a slender, muscular mantle. It is relatively large with thin fins and a long, pointed tail. The head is wider than the opening of the mantle. It has robust arms that are armed with heavy hooks. These arms are of different lengths, the longest being just over half the length of the mantle. There are five rows of teeth on the radula. Tentacles are absent in adults. It is a large species that grows to a mantle length of 620mm. ==Distribution== Gonatopsis japonicus is restricted to the western North Pacific in the Sea of Japan north to the southern Okhotsk Sea and it may also occur off the eastern coast of Japan. It has also been reported from the Kuril Islands east to the central and eastern Bering Sea. ==Habitat and biology== Gonatopsis japonicus appears to mature at a relatively small size of approximately 150 mm in mantle length, and this is indicated by the development of hooks on the arms and the drak pigmentation of the beak. This species can be found from the epipelagic zone down into the mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones, with specimens having been taken from midwater at depths from near the surface to 1000m and from the sea bed at depths from 400m to 2000m. In the Sea of Japan this species was most abundant in the upper 140 m, and its abundance rapidly declined with increasing depth. The regular capturing of juveniles and young adults in the surface layers suggests that this species is an active vertical migrant, it further suggests that its ontogenetic descent takes place relatively late in its life cycle. Most of the specimens taken up to now have been immature or they were newly mature. In the Okhotsk Sea measurements of mature and pre-spawning males from the mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones gave mantle lengths which ranged from 278mm to 478mm, while immature and maturing females mantle lengths ranged from 398mm to 582mm. The largest specimen taken had a mantle length of 620mm. As the squid matures the muscle tissues in its body become increasingly gelatinous. ==Human use== Gonatopsis japonicus is not utilised by humans. ==References== Category:Squid Category:Molluscs described in 1969 ","title":"Gonatopsis japonicus"},{"id":"56765529","text":"Anton Rabie is a Canadian billionaire businessman, the co-founder and co-CEO (with Ronnen Harary) of toy company Spin Master.

A number of Romilii are known from inscriptions. ==Origin== The Romilii claimed descent from Romulus, the legendary founder and first King of Rome. Scholars have long disputed the historicity of Romulus, but from the morphology of the nomen Romilius, it seems probable that Romulus was an authentic cognomen; Romilius belongs to a large class of gentilicia formed using the suffix -, which were typically derived from surnames ending in the diminutive suffix -ulus.Chase, pp. 122, 123. The first of this family mentioned in history was Romulius Denter, said to have been appointed praefectus urbi by Romulus himself.Tacitus, Annales, vi. 11. That the Romilii were patricians is inferred from the fact that Vaticanus was consul in 455, while the plebeians were excluded from the consulship until the lex Licinia Sextia of 367 BC; and from his election to the first college of decemvirs, all of whom are supposed to have been patricians. However, historians have long suspected that some of the consuls in the years preceding the Decemvirate were in fact plebeians, and that the consulship was not formally closed to the plebeians until after the decemvirs had been overthrown. A similar objection has been made with respect to the decemvirs; while plebeians are not supposed to have been included in the first college, it has been argued that some of the decemvirs bore plebeian names.Cornell, The Beginnings of Rome, pp. 252–256. Since the Romilii vanish from history for several centuries after the time of the decemvirs, it may not be possible to prove whether the Romilii were patrician or plebeian. The Romilii mentioned in imperial times may well have been plebeians; but most patrician gentes eventually acquired plebeian branches, often descended from freedmen or newly enfranchised citizens, who assumed the nomina of their patrons. ==Praenomina== The only praenomina associated with the Romilii known from history or inscriptions are Titus, Lucius, and Gaius, all of which were common throughout Roman history. ==Branches and cognomina== Denter, the cognomen assigned to the first praefectus urbi, referred to someone with prominent teeth, while Rocus, from raucus, designated someone with a loud, deep, or hoarse voice.Chase, pp. 109, 110. Vaticanus belongs to a class of surnames derived from a person's place of origin or residence, in this case the Mons Vaticanus, a hill at Rome.Chase, pp. 113, 114. Pollio, the surname of a Romilius who lived in the time of Augustus, was derived from the occupation of the bearer, a polisher of arms or armour.Chase, p. 111. ==Members== * Romulius Denter, said by Tacitus to have been appointed the first praefectus urbi, in the time of Romulus. * Titus Romilius T. f. T. n. Rocus Vaticanus, consul in 455 BC, together with his colleague, Gaius Veturius Geminus Cicurinus, defeated the Aequi at Mount Algidus; but they were subsequently prosecuted and fined for depositing all of the booty in the public treasury, reserving none for their soldiers. In 451, he was a member of the first college of decemvirs, and helped to draw up the first ten tables of Roman law.Livy, iii. 31, 33.Dionysius, x. 33 ff., 56.Fasti Capitolini, ; 1904, 114.Broughton, vol. I, pp. 42, 45, 46 (and note 2). * Romilius Pollio, an elderly man who had reached the age of one hundred, and was asked the secret of his longevity by Augustus. Romilius replied that he drank honeyed wine, and applied oil to his skin.Pliny the Elder, xxii. 24. s. 53. * Romilius Marcellus, a centurion serving in the twenty-second legion in Germania in AD 69, was put to death as one of the supporters of Galba.Tacitus, Historiae, i. 56, 59. * Lucius Romilius O[...]poh[...], a soldier stationed at Rome in AD 70, serving in the century of Tiberius Julius Primigenius.. * Romulius Euhemerus, named in an early third century inscription from Rome.. * Lucius Romilius, head of a college of scribae at Rome.Centocelle II, p. 435. * Romilia C. l., a freedwoman buried in a family sepulchre at Rome.. * Gaius Romilius C. l.

It was broadcast on CBS from June 10, 1948 until February 1, 1953, and was described by one author as \\"a program that consistently produced the highest levels of production quality and value.\\" Beginning on February 8, 1953, the program underwent changes of title, host, and format. It was broadcast as The Hallmark Hall of Fame until March 27, 1955, still on CBS. ==Playhouse format== Hallmark Playhouse began as a summer replacement for Radio Reader's Digest, which Hallmark had also sponsored. Company officials decided to keep it for the fall of 1948 and drop its predecessor. An article in the trade publication Billboard reported that Hallmark executives preferred not to continue sharing product identification with Reader's Digest. The new show broadcast adaptations of works — some obscure and some well-known — from drama and literature. ==Personnel== James Hilton was the host of Hallmark Playhouse. Hollywood stars often had leading roles in episodes. Among those starring were Ethel Barrymore, Ronald Colman, Joan Fontaine, Gregory Peck, and Jane Wyman. Frank Gast was the announcer. Lyn Murray provided the music. Dee Engelbach and Bill Gay were the producers. Writers included Jack Rubin and Jean Holloway. == Episodes == In the reference work On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio, radio historian John Dunning wrote that host Hilton would choose material to be adapted for the broadcasts: \\"Hilton announced plans to 'ransack' the past and search out never-before-broadcast tales from the 2,000-year history of written literature.\\" That goal was missed, however, at the beginning; \\"The Devil and Daniel Webster\\", by Stephen Vincent Benét was the program's premiere episode, and it had already been presented on radio by Columbia Workshop. \\"The Story of Silent Night\\", presented in 1946 was cited by John V. Pavlik in his book, Masterful Stories: Lessons from Golden Age Radio. \\"History comes alive,\\" Pavlik wrote, \\"through the production's rigorous research, splendid dialogue, and beautiful orchestrations, including acoustical guitar and song, especially as sung by a children's group.\\" He added that the episode's musical arrangements and orchestrations \\"underscore the extraordinary resources, intellectual capital, and pure talent that went into creating a program such as the Hallmark Playhouse ...\\" Other stories adapted for the program included \\"Penny Serenade\\", Pride and Prejudice, The Citadel, and Parnassus on Wheels. ==Hall of Fame== Unlike the focus on classical literature and drama of its predecessor, Hallmark Hall of Fame featured stories about people from America's past. Subjects of episodes included Lee de Forest and Mary Todd Lincoln. ===Personnel=== Lionel Barrymore was the host of Hallmark Hall of Fame. Frank Goss was the announcer, and Bill Gay directed. ===Critical reception=== In the September 15, 1951, issue of Billboard, Bob Francis reviewed the opening episode of the 1951–1952 season of Hallmark Playhouse, an adaptation of J. M. Barrie's Quality Street that starred Deborah Kerr. Francis wrote, \\"The air adaptation was exceedingly well put together, keeping the story line clear and retaining the quaint flavor of the original Barrie lines.\\" He also commended the program's advertising, writing that Hallmark commercials \\"were well-spaced and timed — dignified attention-getters without distracting from the interest in the story.\\" ===Recognition=== In 1952, Hallmark Playhouse was among the winners of Radio Honor Medals from the Freedoms Foundation. == References  External links == *Log of episodes of Hallmark Hall of Fame from The Digital Deli Too *Log of episodes of Hallmark Hall of Fame from Jerry Haendiges Vintage Radio Logs *Log of episodes of Hallmark Hall of Fame from radioGOLDINdex *Log of episodes of Hallmark Playhouse from Old Time Radio Researchers Group *Log of episodes of Hallmark Playhouse from radioGOLDINdex *Episodes of Hallmark Playhouse from Old Time Radio Researchers Group Library *Episodes of Hallmark Playhouse from Zoot Radio *Episodes of Hallmark Hall of Fame from Dumb.com *Episodes of Hallmark Hall of Fame from Old Time Radio Researchers Group Library Category:1948 radio programme debuts Category:1955 radio programme endings Category:1940s American radio programs Category:1950s American radio programs Category:CBS Radio programs Category:Anthology radio series ","title":"Hallmark Playhouse"},{"id":"56765766","text":"Alberto Palatchi (born 1949/1950) is a Spanish billionaire businessman, and the former owner of the wedding dress company Pronovias. ==Career== In 1964, Palatchi inherited a store from his parents.

Sims's Living London (1901)Sims, George R. (1901) Living London. Ayahs' Home, 26 King Edward Road, Hackney, c. 1900London City Mission, 1900. Former locations of the Ayahs' Home (arrowed) at King Edward's Road, Hackney, on a 1948 map1948 Ordnance Survey map, Digimap, 8 March 2018. The Ayahs' Home, London, provided accommodation for Indian ayahs and Chinese amahs (nannies) at the turn of the 20th century who were \\"ill-treated, dismissed from service or simply abandoned\\" with no return passage to their home country. The Home also operated like an employment exchange to help ayahs find placements with families returning to India. It was the only institution of its type in Britain with a named building. ==Background== Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the East India Company was abolished and its powers transferred to the British Crown under the Government of India Act 1858. This resulted in a large number of British families travelling between the two countries. Many of these families employed local servants as they were cheaper than British staff. Among them were ayahs, the most highly prized being the sophisticated \\"Madrassi ayahs\\". Some ayahs were experienced travellers and advertised their services in newspapers.\\"Four women\\" by Caroline Bressey in Travelling ayahs were seen as \\"honest, clean, capable nurses and made good sailors\\". The British public were captivated by the picturesque ayahs shown in paintings and books. The ayah would accompany the British family back to England, either on the seasonal trips to escape the Indian summer or on retirement of the colonial official. These journeys were more frequent after 1869 with the introduction of steam-powered ships and regular passenger services such as those provided by P&O.; The journey was shortened by 4,500 miles after the Suez Canal opened in 1869, with the effect that up to 140 travelling ayahs visited England every year with their employing families, memsahibs and children. Some may have had a sense of adventure, but they were vulnerable to the whims of their erstwhile employers. Without official contracts or guarantees for return passages, some ayahs then had their employment terminated or were abandoned, forcing them to live in squalor or to beg. Others found alternative employment to pay for return journeys or stayed in Britain.Homes for Indian nannies. British Library. Retrieved 8 March 2018.

Evidence from the India Office gives a foundation date of 1825; however, it has also been said to have been founded in 1891 by Mr and Mrs Rogers at 6 Jewry Street, Aldgate. It appears to have been closed prior to 1891 due to administrative inadequacies, but, in response to the lobbying of a committee of white British women, the foreigners' branch committee of the London City Mission (LCM) took it over and prevented its permanent closure. Around 1900, the Home moved to 26 King Edward Road, Mare Street, Hackney, and in 1921, requiring more space, it moved to the larger 4 King Edward Road. The new home was opened by Lady Chelmsford, wife of Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford, the former Viceroy of India. ==Early years== Regarded as a \\"symbol of empire\\" and a \\"home from home\\", around 100 ayahs stayed at the Home each year. The residents were mainly nurse-maids from India and other countries including China, Java and Malaya. Socio-political changes created variations in numbers, with a higher occupancy during the Indian summer when many British families returned to escape the heat. The home was almost unoccupied from November to March. It was busier during the First World War when sea travel was banned for women, with a resulting increase in the number of stranded ayahs. After the Armistice of 11 November 1918, 223 Ayahs were recorded at the Home as families rushed back to England at the first opportunity. The number of occupants was less during the depression of the 1930s. The length of stay varied from weeks to months. Despite the lack of any testimonies from the ayahs, it is known that they were typically older women, used to childcare responsibilities and able to fit into both the English and Indian worlds. Life in the Home was an amalgamation of oriental and western tradition, with Indian food, the playing of pachis, embroidery and outings to places of interest such as Westminster Abbey, the Houses of Parliament and Buckingham Palace. The Home generated income by the resale of the ayah's ticket, public donations, fundraising events and the sale of handwork done by the ayahs. A deficit in finances by 1917, when the war prolonged occupancy, led the Home's administrator to apply to the India Office for assistance. Initially hesitant, by 1928 the office was making an annual contribution to the Home. ==Matron's testimony== In 1910, Mrs Dunn, the matron of the Home, gave evidence to the Committee on Distressed Colonial and Indian Subjects of the India Office. Dunn described how the system depended on the ayah's return ticket. The employer who released the ayah from duties once in Britain typically purchased the ayah's return ticket, which was transferred to the Home. The ticket was then \\"sold\\" to a family wanting the ayah's services; the Home used the money from the sale to pay for the ayah's accommodation until she departed. According to her evidence, the Home had been established by a committee of women who had realised there should be a shelter for abandoned ayahs in England.Ayahs' Home. Making Britain, Open University. Retrieved 27 March 2018. Among the evidence that was given by Mrs Dunn and also recorded in correspondence between the Home and the India Office was of an ayah who was brought to England from Bombay by a British woman in 1908, who, in the usual manner, released her to Thomas Cook and Son in order to transfer her employment. Re-employed by the Drummond family of Edinburgh who had pledged her return to India, she was abandoned at London's King's Cross Station, leaving her with one pound after two weeks work. The ayah arrived at the Thomas Cook office, which then directed her to the Home. Not in the custom of taking in destitute women, Mrs Dunn successfully obtained compensation from the India Office. ==Missionary activity== The Strangers' Home, Limehouse, where Joseph Salter also worked The Home was a converting station for missionaries to introduce the ayahs to Christianity. \\"Foreigners' Fetes\\" were frequently organised by the Foreigner's Branch Committee of the LCM, which was supported by Christian missionaries. Religious services were held daily, hymns were taught and religious \\"chats in the bedroom\\" which the matron felt were \\"productive of much good\\", were part of daily life at the Home. This all principally stemmed from the perception of ayahs as \\"child-like\\". Demonstrating a \\"domestic ideal and moral framework\\", the parlour of the Home was depicted in Alec Robert's Living London article \\"Missionary London\\", with a group of women looking busy sewing and reading.\\"Viewing the Early Twentieth- Century Institutional Interior Through the Pages of Living London\\" by Fiona Fisher in Expressing Christian charity for the benefit of the ayahs' welfare and the British empire, the Home encouraged the ayahs to show gratitude and loyalty.

He remained in post for a decade, although the nature of the job evolved and there were changes of title in 1948 and again in 1952 when he became, formally, the French ambassador to the Saarland. Subsequently, he became a government minister during the early years of the Fifth Republic. Gilbert Grandval was the alias Hirsch-Ollendorff used from approximately 1943 while working with the Resistance. Subsequently, he was authorized permanently to substitute the Grandval name for the family name with which he had been born, both on his own account and on behalf of his father. The authorization came from a decree signed on 25 February 1946 by the President of the postwar provisional government, and officially transcribed at the appropriate town hall on 12 March 1948. == Life  Provenance and early years === Yves Gilbert Edmond Hirsch was born at his parents' home along the Rue La Boétie in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. Edmond Hirsch (1873-), his father, was a book dealer who expanded the family business to include a publisher of school books. Gilbert's grandfather, Henri Hirsch (1829-) had also been a book dealer. The Hirsch family traced their origins back to Strasbourg, but after the frontier changes of 1871 they were given and took up the option of retaining French citizenship, which meant leaving Alsace. His mother, born Jeanne Ollendorff (1880-), was the daughter of Paul Ollendorff (1851-1920), another book dealer, and a publisher who numbered Guy de Maupassant among his authors. It may have been on account of the name recognition than the Ollendorff family enjoyed that while he was still a child the family took to using the family name Hirsch-Ollendorff. Gilbert Hirsch-Ollendorff was born into a Jewish family but with the post-revolutionary French state deeply committed to \\"Laïcité\\" he seems to have been able to carry his religion lightly: at some stage he converted to Roman Catholicism. Nevertheless, as Gilbert grew up the family was part of the city's Jewish intellectual community: their social circle included the family of Léon Blum, who also traced his family origins back to Alsace. He received his schooling at the prestigious Lycée Condorcet, close to the family home. In compliance with his family's wishes he then embarked on the study of medicine. That study was interrupted between 1924 and 1926 when he was required to perform military service. He never returned to medicine. Instead he used his contacts to find work with Saint-Gobain, a major manufacturer of chemicals and glass-based products. He rose quickly through management ranks to become a sales director with the fertilizers division, based in Lyon. During the 1930s, like many upwardly mobile young executives, he obtained a pilot's license, apparently from motives which were, at the time, purely recreational and social. === War and resistance === France declared war on Germany, in response to the German- Soviet invasion of Poland, in September 1939. Gilbert Hirsch-Ollendorff was by now an experienced pilot. He was almost immediately conscripted into the Air Force and given the rank of \\" lieutenant\\". He was deployed in a reconnaissance squadron and later as a fighter pilot in northern France. The German invasion was launched on 10 May 1940 and ended six weeks later in France's military defeat on 22 June. The southern half of France was placed under the administration of an (initially semi-autonomous) puppet government while the northern half of the country was placed under direct military occupation. Gilbert Hirsch-Ollendorff was demobilised and on 17 August 1940 returned to work in the chemicals business. Général de Gaulle's famous rallying speech was transmitted from London on 18 June 1940, and during the same month Hirsch- Ollendorff made contact. He became a member of the Ceux de la Résistance (\\"Those of the Resistance\\" / CDLR) group in 1941. Although, in the first instance, he retained doubts about the Resistance, one of his early assignments involved finding more recruits for it. From 9 June 1942, threatened with Gestapo persecution, he \\"disappeared underground\\". In November of that same year he became the CDLR's head of military organisation in the area designated by the movement as \\"Region C\\", which comprised eight eastern departments including three - those comprising Alsace-Moselle - that for historical and linguistic reasons the Germans were treating as fully integrated parts of the German state (Gau Baden-Elsaß and Gau Westmark). Most of the rest of \\"Region C\\" was defined by the Germans as the \\"Forbidden zone\\" \\"Zone interdite\\", subjected to tighter military control and a more punitive régime in respect of the civilian population than most of occupied France. On 6 August 1943, while on a trip to Paris, he was arrested by German occupation troops. He was released two days later \\"for lack of evidence against him\\". After this his commitment to the Resistance was evidently total. He used a range of cover names: \\"Chancel\\", \\"Pasteur\\", \\"Berger\\", \\"Planète\\" and \\"Grandval\\". He was seen to be acquiring enhanced leadership potential, with an intimate appreciation of the organisation's structures and hierarchies. Additional military responsibilities arrived in due course along with promotion to the rank of colonel. Within resistance circles Grandval (as he increasingly came to be known among comrades) was identified, like his direct superior in the resistance organisation, General Kœnig, as a committed de Gaulle loyalist. Another senior resistance member in the region with whom he worked on the national directorate of the CDLR was the future prime minister, Michel Debré. France's liberation arrived from the west, with Paris freed during the final part of August 1944. The Provisional Government under Charles de Gaulle established itself in Paris on 25 August 1944. In Lorraine the important city of Nancy was liberated by the Third United States Army a month later. It is claimed that two days before the American army entered the city itself Grandval with his resistance forces had already extinguished the last remnants of the German military presence, but the truth of the matter is hard to pin down. There certainly was an ongoing fractiousness between Grandval and US military officers whom he came across during his subsequent career. De Gaulle visited the city on 25 September 1944 and personally greeted local resistance leaders including Grandval, on whom he conferred the Order of the Liberation. It was Grandval's first encounter with the General whom over the previous four years he had known only as a familiar voice emerging through the crackling of radio waves. Grandval could now style himself a Companion of the Liberation. In 1946 he was also made a Knight of the Legion of Honour. On 25 September 1944. at de Gaulle's insistence, André Diethelm, the Minister for War in the new government, appointed Grandval as military commander of the 20th Military Region (i.e. the Nancy region). He gained valuable experience, reconfiguring the local resistance era \\"Forces of the Interior\\" into appropriate postwar military structures, and also rebuilding the underpinnings of civil society which during the occupation years had fallen into the hands of now discredited Vichy officials. With something approaching postwar normality appearing on the horizon, Grandval let his family know that he was preparing for a return to civilian life and the world of business. That was not to be, however. === Saar protectorate === With the western two thirds of Germany after May 1945 divided into four military occupation zones, de Gaulle's plans for Grandval involved appointing him military governor in Baden-Baden, as \\"right-hand\\" to General Kœnig, with whom he had already worked very closely during the closing months of the war. Grandval was not interested in such a political-diplomatic posting, however. Plans were then developed for him to be offered the military governorship of the Saarland, a highly industrialised region with a unique political and economic status, where it was felt that Grandval's hands-on experience of the industrial sector could be particularly valuable. The region's mines were seen by the French government as a valuable source of future war reparations. Grandval took some persuading, and indeed sought the advice of his old family friend Léon Blum. However, he accepted and on 30 August 1945 was appointed as France's Military Governor (\\"Délégué Supérieur\\") of the region, taking up his posting on 7 September 1945. His mandate from the head of the French government was to establish a special administrative dispensation, as far as possible with the consent of the population. Looking ahead, it was hoped that in the event of another referendum on the matter, voters in the Saarland might be persuaded to back union with France in preference to a return to a German state. Grandval expected to remain in post for a few months, at most half a year. As early as March 1945, in a telephone call, the Minister for War, André Diethelm, had impressed on Grandval the importance the French president attached to establishing a significant French military presence in the Saar region. De Gaulle had backed up his wish by sending two battalions of the 26th Infantry Regiment towards the Saar and Palatinate regions. These had found their movements held up by the Americans, but on 10 April, when he inspected French troops at Scheidt, Grandval was able to report back that \\"the Americans were there, but the French were there too, as Général de Gaulle wished\\". In persuading the American commanders on the ground to comply with the government level decisions concerning French military administration being applied in the French military occupation zone, he exercised a range of political and human negotiating skills, and he was also able to see to it that for the important coal mines to be restarted, it would be necessary for the Americans military personnel to relinquish control in favour of specialists from the French Mines Commission. Despite the military nature of his posting, Grandval's preoccupations were increasingly with tangible fundamentals of the region's civilian economy: coal, steel and reconstruction. During a brief visit in May 1945, prior to his appointment he had determined that these were the most urgent concerns. Industry had to be restarted to boost the desperately depressed regional economy and restore people's livelihoods. That would also ensure war reparations to France (chiefly in the form of brown coal). He invited the Paris government to entrust him with doing what was necessary, and that is what happened. At the end of 1947 a new constitution was implemented in the Saarland. Preparation of the constitution had involved extensive wrangling between the wartime allies, but the appointment of Gilbert Grandval as High Commissioner, following the abolition of the post of Military Governor for the region, provided an element of continuity. His reports to Paris went now not to the Ministry for War but to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. His main task was to ensure that the (now democratically elected) regional government passed no resolutions or laws that might endanger the region's autonomy (in relation to West Germany) or jeoparise the economic customs union with France. building designed for the purpose by Georges-Henri Pingusson His title changed again on 25 January 1952, when the French government appointed Grandval as Ambassador and Head of the French Diplomatic Mission to the Saar Protectorate. By this time, with cold war tensions intensifying on the far side of Germany, the French government, taking its lead from western allies, was developing a more collaborational relationship with the western occupation zones of Germany which had been relaunched, in May 1949, as the German Federal Republic (\\"Bundesrepublik Deutschland\\" / West Germany). Despite his new title, Grandval was still mandated to appeal against any new changes in law proposed by the regional government, if he thought the autonomous relationship of the region in relation to West Germany, or its customs union with France, were challenged. In 1954 he moved his ambassador's office to a modernist concrete building designed for the purpose by Georges-Henri Pingusson. Grandval's ten-year stay in Saarbrücken was by now entering its final phase: it is not known whether he ever took the opportunity to move his family home from Schloss Halberg, on the southside of the city, where the Grandvals had lived since 1946, to the massive concrete building in the city centre. On 25 January 1955 the West German ambassador in Paris, Herbert Blankenhorn (who was known to be a close confidant of Chancellor Adenauer) agreed with Georges Henri Soutou, France's deputy cabinet head, that Grandval's Saarland posting should end three months before the Saar Statute referendum, scheduled for October of that year. It was widely (but wrongly) anticipated that voters would back a settlement that gave the region autonomy under the auspices of the Western European Union, while retaining its postwar economic and customs union with France. Grandval's successor would be Eric de Carbonnel, a career diplomat and a less forceful personality. A valedictory reception was held on 30 June 1955, featuring a moving speech by Grandval himself. His mission, he said, had been \\"one of the most uplifting tasks that could be given to any Frenchman\\" (\\"eine der erhebendsten Aufgaben, die heute einem Franzosen gestellt werden können\\"). === Towards the Fifth Republic === There followed a brief posting as French Résident général in Morocco. This appointment had become public knowledge because of an article in Der Spiegel back in April 1954. The Sultan had fiercely objected on account of Grandval's presumed Judaism. The posting nevertheless went ahead, formally with effect from 20 June 1955. However, Grandval resigned after fifty-five days over \\"differences\\" with the policies of the French government led by Edgar Faure. In September 1958 he was appointed to a government position as Secretary of State for the French merchant navy, in succession to Maurice-René Simonnet. He remained in this post for more than two years: the period was one of significant transition. Gilbert Grandval, like many of his generation, retained a deep personal and political loyalty towards Général de Gaulle, who during this period returned to power and inaugurated the \\"Fifth Republic\\". Grandval saw himself as a \\"lefwing Gaullist\\" and was a founder member of a new political party, the Democratic Labour Union (\\"Union démocratique du travail\\" / UDT) which was a slightly incongruous (and, as an independent party, short- lived) alternative to the mainstream Gaullist Union for the New Republic (\\" L'Union pour la nouvelle République\\" / UNR) party. The UDT was notable for containing \\"strong personalities\\", but gained little traction with the electorate. On 14 April 1962 he was appointed Secretary of state (junior minister) for Overseas Trade in the new government under Prime Minister Georges Pompidou. That appointment was of short duration, however, since on 15 May 1962 he entered Pompidou's cabinet, taking over from Paul Bacon as Minister of Labour. A new government took over on 8 January 1966, putting an end to Grandval's ministerial career. There now came a return to the private section in July 1966 when he became president of the venerable Messageries Maritimes shipping company. He retired from the position in 1972. After his departure from government, Grandval remained politically engaged. In 1971 he became chair of the \\"Union Travailliste\\", a new breakaway faction within the Gaullist political family of little long-term significance. == References == Category:French Ministers for Work and Social Security Category:Grand Officiers of the Légion d'honneur Category:Recipients of the Croix de Guerre 1939–1945 (France) Category:Recipients of the Resistance Medal Category:Commanders of the Ordre du Mérite Maritime Category:Recipients of the Ordre des Palmes Académiques Category:Companions of the Liberation Category:Lycée Condorcet alumni Category:People from Paris Category:1904 births Category:1981 deaths ","title":"Gilbert Grandval"},{"id":"56765838","text":"Mt Maria College Petrie is a Catholic co-educational secondary college located in Petrie, a suburb in Queensland, Australia.

The land mine in Altena's driveway was discovered, disarmed and removed. For their own safety, Marc de Borchgrave and his family were sent to Whistlefield Farm, which was owned by Archie Dalgluish and his family, while their family home was being repaired. Having been alerted to the de Borchgraves' new location through sympathetic farmworkers, guerrillas from the original cadre requested permission from ZANLA to carry out another attack. After ZANLA's area commanders in Centenary had been consulted, a raid on the second target (Whistlefield Farm) was planned. ==The Raid== At about one o'clock on the morning of 23 December, the insurgents reconnoitred Whistlefield Farm and shelled the structure with mortar fire. An RPG-7 was aimed into the bedroom in which de Borchgrave was sleeping. The rocket hit the window frame and lightly wounded the tobacco farmer, his nine-year-old daughter Anne, and de Borchgrave. The ZANLA cadres then retreated and hid themselves. News of the second attack reached Second Lieutenant Ian Buttenshaw and Sachse around midnight, and they deployed immediately, but having discovered a mine near Altena they disembarked from the vehicles 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) from Whistlefield and made the final approach on foot. Anne was evacuated by helicopter as the RLI and SAS secured the area for the night. The next morning, on 24 December 1972, two tracking teams arrived at Whistlefield to assist Buttenshaw and Sachse in a 360-degree search: one was from the SAS, and led by Ron Marillier, while the other was a British South Africa Police (BSAP) team including tracking dogs. The security forces searched for tracks while also investigating reported sightings. The tracks of the ZANLA fighters were discovered on 27 December on the western side of the farm and the trackers asked Buttenshaw and Sachse to bring the vehicles carrying the heavy equipment around to meet them. On the way the truck carrying Buttenshaw ran over a mine with one of its rear wheels, causing it to detonate. Buttenshaw himself, who was sitting on the bonnet of the vehicle, was thrown clear but Corporal Norman Moore and Trooper Pete Botha, sitting in the back, were not as fortunate, taking the brunt of the blast. Captain Gordon Holloway, behind the wheel, and Trooper Rod Boden in the passenger seat went into severe shock but were ultimately unharmed. Moore, on the other hand, died two days later from his wounds, while Botha survived but lost both legs. In their haste, Nhongo's cadres had not attempted to conceal their tracks as they headed west, towards the Musengezi river—Buttenshaw's pursuant RLI men therefore realised how quickly the guerrillas were moving and sped up their chase. The Rhodesians stopped for the night in a rocky area near a stream, replenished their scanty water supply and continued at dawn. About half an hour after setting off they crossed a vlei to discover a recently vacated guerrilla camp. \\"The fire was still burning and the food still warm,\\" Buttenshaw writes. \\"From the abandoned kit a hurried departure appeared evident.\\" Support was summoned from the SAS, who were tasked to set up stops along the Musengezi to the west. Buttenshaw's men reached the top of the Musengezi valley to see Rhodesian helicopters dropping the SAS soldiers at regular intervals along the river, as well as the ZANLA cadres, who were moving straight towards one of the SAS stops. The stop opened fire and killed some; the rest of the guerrillas scattered and ran. Buttenshaw's RLI men were then withdrawn from the follow-up for a day and a half and placed in stop positions. The chase was temporarily taken over by the SAS under Lieutenant Chris Schulenburg before Buttenshaw's men returned on 30 December 1972. Soon after setting out that morning they discovered an unarmed, wounded ZANLA fighter who had been shot in the arm by the SAS in the initial contact two days earlier. He had hidden himself after being abandoned by his comrades, and since then had lost a great deal of blood. After two years of patient preparation, the farm attacks by ZANLA near Centenary marked the effective start of its \\"Second Chimurenga\\" against the Rhodesian government. ==Aftermath== The effectiveness of ZANLA's adopted Maoist tactics was demonstrated in particular by the element of surprise they were now able to use against the security forces, and by the ability they had achieved to melt seamlessly into the local population between strikes. The rural black people in the north-east of the country were now, almost totally subverted and intimidated\\" by ZANLA and provided the guerrillas with food, shelter and manpower. Rather than having the tribesmen actively volunteer information about insurgent movements and locations, as had happened during previous infiltrations, the Rhodesian Security Forces now met an increasingly silent and sometimes hostile welcome from the rural blacks. More farm attacks took place over the following weeks, during December 1972 and January 1973, leading the security forces to set up Operation Hurricane in northern Mashonaland. This counter-insurgency operation would continue right up to 1980. \\"It was the start of a whole new ball game,\\" writes Lieutenant-Colonel R. E. H. Lockley. \\"The war proper had started.\\" Six huts and a mosque in the farmworkers' compound were torched during the skirmish, although accounts differ on who started the fire. ==ReferencesNotes=Bibliography=== * Category:Battles and operations of the Rhodesian Bush War Category:Conflicts in 1972 Category:December 1972 events in Africa Category:1972 in Rhodesia ","title":"Attack on Whistlefield Farm"},{"id":"56765860","text":"The world record progression of the men's speed skating big combination as recognised by the International Skating Union: {  !#!!Name!!times (500 -

It became a popular movement but was tainted by accusations of Communism. ==History== Common Cause was founded in 1943 as a vehicle for a number of idealistic community leaders of diverse backgrounds to discuss the post-war economic and social future of South Australia. Charter members were: *Professor K. S. Isles (chairman) *A. A. Angrave (secretary of Plasterers' Union) *Dr. A. R. Callaghan (principal of Roseworthy College) *Sidney Crawford (chairman of C.M.V. Motors) *Charles Duguid (medical doctor and advocate for Aboriginal advancement) *Tom Garland (secretary of the Gasworkers' Union) *Rev. Guy Pentreath (head of St. Peter's College) *Professor G. V. Portus *Alex M. Ramsay (economist) *W. A. Sams (State organiser for the Shop Assistants' Union and executive member of the Communist Party) *Gilbert Seaman (statistical and research officer of the Commonwealth Treasury Department.) *A. B. Thompson (president, United Trades and Labour Council) *John W. Wainwright (Auditor-General, South Australian Government) *D. R. Watson (hairdresser) The idealistic aims of the organisation found favour with a large section of the community, disenchanted by the Great Depression and tired of the war and looking forward to a future of industrial peace and prosperity. A. J. Hannan of Medindie (the Crown Solicitor) was a prominent critic, accusing it of being either a Communist front organisation or susceptible to takeover by Communists by virtue of its open membership and support by the Union movement. Rev. E. S. Kiek of Parkin College made a passionate defence of Common Cause, and was supported by large number of ministers of religion who were also members. At its first Annual General Meeting K. S. Isles, was re-elected president; vice presidents elected were A. B. Thompson and G. V. Portus; hon. treasurer L. J. Mulroney; minute secretary Maurice Brown; executive council Sidney Crawford, A. A. Drummond, Mrs. Fairbank, T. Garland, Mrs. K. S. Isles, J. H. Knight, and Dr. J. Lugg. They had a meeting room on Waymouth Street. The organisation helped found a kindergarten and community centre at Nuriootpa, a town with a well-developed community spirit, and where the aims of Common Cause were particularly welcomed. In 1944 Common Cause published a booklet A Township starts to live : the valley of Barossa : South Australia's new community. Crawford, a prime mover in its foundation, retired shortly after. Isles resigned as president on the eve of his departure for London on Army business. Common Cause disbanded in 1949.Susan Marsden, 'Crawford, Sidney (1885–1968)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/crawford-sidney-9859/text17443, published first in hardcopy 1993, accessed online 9 March 2018. == References == Category:1943 establishments in Australia Category:1949 disestablishments in Australia Category:Organisations based in Adelaide Category:Think tanks based in Australia ","title":"Common Cause (South Australia)"},{"id":"56765886","text":"Thomas Flohr (born 17 March 1960) is a Swiss businessman, founder and chairman of VistaJet, a private jet charter company, amateur racing driver and former billionaire.

The Blast, an Eastern Division team in the Major Arena Soccer League, play their home games at SECU Arena in Towson, Maryland. The team is led by owner Edwin F. Hale, Sr. and head coach Danny Kelly. The Blast entered the season as defending champions as they defeated the Sonora Suns in the Ron Newman Cup finals in April 2017 for the second consecutive season. Following a 6-5 victory on February 10 over the Milwaukee Wave, Baltimore clinched a playoff berth in the Eastern Division for the 2018 Ron Newman Cup playoffs. The Blast then clinched the regular-season Eastern Division championship after an 8-7 overtime win over the Florida Tropics on February 24. The Blast finished the regular season 17-5 and defeated Syracuse, Milwaukee and Monterrey in the postseason, successfully defending their title en route to the team's tenth championship (including one won by the original Blast franchise). William Vanzela received the MASL Final MVP. ==History== Launched in July 1992 as the Baltimore Spirit, an expansion team in the second National Professional Soccer League for the 1992–93 season, the team replaced the original Baltimore Blast which folded earlier in 1992 when the first Major Indoor Soccer League shut down. Ed Hale, an owner of the original Blast, bought the Spirit in July 1998 and changed the name to Baltimore Blast. In 2001, the team was a founding member of the second MISL. When that league shut down in 2008, they co-founded the National Indoor Soccer League which, one season later, became the third MISL. After the 2013-14 season, Baltimore was one of three teams that left the MISL, leading to the league's collapse. Along with five other former MISL teams, the Blast joined the teams of the Professional Arena Soccer League, which was then rebranded as the Major Arena Soccer League. The MASL Eastern Division for the 2017-18 season remains unchanged from the previous season, consisting of the defending MASL Ron Newman Cup Champion Baltimore Blast, former MISL club Syracuse Silver Knights, former PASL club Harrisburg Heat, and the Florida Tropics. ==Off-field moves== The Blast announced in August 2017 that they would move from the Royal Farms Arena to the SECU Arena on the campus of Towson University, beginning in the 2017-2018 MASL season. The move will be the first time the Blast franchise will play home games in an arena other than the Royal Farms Arena. ==ScheduleRegular season=== {  - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:40px;\\" Game ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:60px;\\" Day ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:110px;\\" Date ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:60px;\\" Kickoff ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:180px;\\" Opponent ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:180px;\\" Results ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:250px;\\" Location ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:80px;\\" Attendance - ! style=\\"width:120px;\\" Score ! style=\\"width:60px;\\" Record - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#cfc;\\" ! 1 Friday November 10  7:35 PM  Cedar Rapids Rampage W 8–7  1–0  SECU Arena 3,733 - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#cfc;\\" ! 2 Friday November 17  7:35 PM  Syracuse Silver Knights W 7–6  2–0  SECU Arena 3,521 - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#fcc;\\" ! 3 Saturday November 18  7:35 PM  Florida Tropics L 4–5  2–1  RP Funding Center 2,356 - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#cfc;\\" ! 4 Friday December 1  7:35 PM  Ontario Fury W 8–5  3–1  SECU Arena 3,800 - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#cfc;\\" ! 5 Saturday December 2  6:05 PM  St. Louis Ambush W 5–4  4–1  SECU Arena 2,923 - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#cfc;\\" ! 6 Sunday December 10  3:05 PM  Florida Tropics W 10–1  5–1  SECU Arena 3,429 - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#cfc;\\" ! 7 Friday December 15  7:35 PM  Florida Tropics W 7–6  6–1  RP Funding Center 1,741 - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#fcc;\\" ! 8 Saturday December 16  7:05 PM  Harrisburg Heat L 5–6 (SO)  6–2  Farm Show Large Arena 1,316 - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#cfc;\\" ! 9 Saturday December 30  7:05 PM  Kansas City Comets W 5–3  7–2 Silverstein Eye Centers Arena 4,009 - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#cfc;\\" ! 10 Sunday December 31  3:05 PM  Cedar Rapids Rampage W 3–2  8–2  U.S. Cellular Center 1,820 - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#cfc;\\" ! 11 Saturday January 6  6:05 PM  Harrisburg Heat W 4–3 (OT)  9–2  SECU Arena 3,725 - style=\\"text- align:center; background:#cfc;\\" ! 12 Friday January 12  7:05 PM  Syracuse Silver Knights W 5–4 (OT)  10–2  Oncenter War Memorial Arena 1,747 - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#cfc;\\" ! 13 Friday January 19  7:35 PM  Kansas City Comets W 15–8  11–2  SECU Arena 3,041 - style=\\"text- align:center; background:#cfc;\\" ! 14 Saturday January 20  6:05 PM  Harrisburg Heat W 12–5  12–2  SECU Arena 3,554 - style=\\"text- align:center; background:#cfc;\\" ! 15 Friday January 26  7:35 PM  Harrisburg Heat W 4–2  13–2  Farm Show Large Arena 1,439 - style=\\"text- align:center; background:#cfc;\\" ! 16 Saturday February 3  6:05 PM  Syracuse Silver Knights W 8–7 (OT)  14–2  SECU Arena 3,800 - style=\\"text- align:center; background:#cfc;\\" ! 17 Saturday February 10  1:05 PM  Milwaukee Wave W 6–5  15–2  UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena 3,476 - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#fcc;\\" ! 18 Friday February 16  7:35 PM  Cedar Rapids Rampage L 5–6  15–3  U.S. Cellular Center 1,826 - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#fcc;\\" ! 19 Saturday February 17  7:05 PM  Milwaukee Wave L 1–5  15–4  UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena 5,974 - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#cfc;\\" ! 20 Friday February 23  7:35 PM  Milwaukee Wave W 9–6  16–4  SECU Arena 3,242 - style=\\"text- align:center; background:#cfc;\\" ! 21 Saturday February 24  6:05 PM  Florida Tropics W 8–7 (OT)  17–4  SECU Arena 3,631 - style=\\"text- align:center; background:#fcc;\\" ! 22 Sunday March 4  4:05 PM  Syracuse Silver Knights L 4–6  17–5  Oncenter War Memorial Arena 3,007 } ===Post- season=== {  - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:140px;\\" Game ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:70px;\\" Day ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:70px;\\" Date ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:60px;\\" Kickoff ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:170px;\\" Opponent ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:220px;\\" Results ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:240px;\\" Location ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:80px;\\" Attendance - ! style=\\"width:160px;\\" Score ! style=\\"width:60px;\\" Record - style=\\"text- align:center; background:#cfc;\\" !

Some scholars believe that the species is a hybrid of Juglans regia and Juglans mandshurica. Currently, it is a threatened tree species. Historically, Ma walnut was originally distributed in the Northern Taihang Mountains of Hebei Province, so it was called Hebei walnut (河北核桃). This species is mainly distributed in some mountainous areas of Hebei Province, Shanxi Province, Beijing and Tianjin in China. ==Morphological characteristics== Ma walnut, whose scientific name is Juglans hopeiensis Hu, is a plant belonging to the genus Juglans of the family Juglandaceae. The plant can reach up to 2.5 meters high and often grow in high mountains. Its bark is gray-white with longitudinal cracks. ==Discovery and Naming== In 1930, Zhou Hanfan discovered this new species in Banjiegou, Xiakou Village, Changping County, Hebei Province (now part of Beijing). Subsequently, one strain of the species was found in each of Jixian, Mentougou, and Lianhua Mountain. In 1934, the new species was first described by the Chinese botanist Hu Xiansu (better known as H. H. Hu) in his paper entitled \\"Notulae systematicae ad Florem Sinensium V\\". He originally indicated that the species was known locally as \\"Mahetao\\" (i.e. Ma walnut) and was once quite commonly cultivated, but it subsequently became less popular. In 1981, several plants of Ma walnut were found again in Bancheng District, Lishui County, Hebei Province.

COMELEC is a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippines about the validity of the cityhood laws of sixteen municipalities in the Philippines. The case clarifies the requirements for the conversion of a Municipality into a Component City. The Court in its final decision ruled that the cityhood laws of the sixteen municipalities in the Philippines are constitutional. == Background and history == In the Eleventh Congress, 57 bills seeking the conversion of municipalities into component cities were filed before the House of Representatives. However, Congress did not act on the 24 out of the 57 municipalities. In the Twelfth Congress, Republic Act No. 9009 was enacted revising the Local Government Code (LGC) by increasing the income requirement to qualify for conversion into a city from ₱20 million annual income to ₱100 million locally generated income. In the thirteenth Congress, 16 of the 24 municipalities filed their individual cityhood bills. Each of the cityhood bills contained a common provision exempting the particular municipality from the ₱100 million income requirement imposed by RA No. 9009. These cityhood bills lapsed into law on various dates after President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo did not sign them. Petitioners filed to declare the Cityhood Laws unconstitutional for violation of Section 10, Article X of the 1987 Constitution, as well as for violation of the equal protection clause. Petitioners also pointed that the wholesale conversion of municipalities into cities will reduce the share of existing cities in the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) because more cities will share the same amount of internal revenue set aside for all cities under Section 285 of the Local Government Code.League of Cities of the Philippines v.

X of the Constitution requires that such exemption must be written into the LGC and not into any other laws. The Court stated that the Cityhood Laws violate sec. 6, Art. X of the Constitution for they prevent a fair and just distribution of the national taxes to local government units. It further held that the criteria, as prescribed in the LGC, must be strictly followed because such criteria are material in determining the “just share” of local government units (LGUs) in national taxes. On March 31, 2009, the Court, by a vote of 7-5, denied the first motion for reconsideration.League of Cities of the Philippines v. COMELEC.(Resolution) G.R. No. 176951; March 31, 2009 The second motion for reconsideration was denied on April 28, 2009.League of Cities of the Philippines v. COMELEC.(Resolution) G.R. No. 176951; April 28, 2009 On December 21, 2009, the Court, by a vote of 6-4 reversed its November 18, 2008 decision and declared the Cityhood Laws as constitutional. It ruled that based on the deliberations of the Congress and the intent of the same was that the then pending cityhood bills would be outside the pale of the minimum income requirement of ₱100 million that Senate Bill No. 2159 proposes; and that RA 9009 would not have any retroactive effect insofar as the cityhood bills are concerned. It also held that the conversion of a municipality into a city will only affect its status as a political unit, but not its property as such, it added. Furthermore, it stressed that respondent LGUs were qualified cityhood applicants before the enactment of RA 9009 for to impose on them the much higher income requirement after what they have gone through would appear to be indeed unfair. Thus, the imperatives of fairness dictate that they should be given a legal remedy by which they should be allowed to prove that they have all the necessary qualifications for city status using the criteria set forth under the LGC of 1991 prior to its amendment by RA 9009.League of Cities of the Philippines v. COMELEC.(Decision) G.R. No. 176951; December 21, 2009; J. Velasco Jr. On August 24, 2010, the Court, with a vote of 7-6 granted the motions for reconsideration of the petitioners and reinstated its November 18, 2008 decision. It Court reiterated its November 18, 2008 ruling that the Cityhood Laws violate sec. 10, Art. X of the Constitution which expressly provides that: > “no city…shall be created…except in accordance with the criteria established > in the local government code.” It stressed that while all the criteria for the creation of cities must be embodied exclusively in the Local Government Code, the assailed Cityhood Laws provided an exemption from the increased income requirement for the creation of cities under sec. 450 of the LGC. It further held that: > “The unconstitutionality of the Cityhood Laws lies in the fact that Congress > provided an exemption contrary to the express language of the Constitution…. > ...Congress exceeded and abused its law-making power, rendering the > challenged Cityhood Laws void for being violative of the Constitution.” Finally, it ruled that limiting the exemption only to the 16 municipalities violates the requirement that the classification must apply to all similarly situated.League of Cities of the Philippines v. COMELEC.(Resolution) G.R. No. 176951; August 24, 2009; J. Carpio On February 15, 2011, the Court reversed its own decision for the fourth time, declaring the Cityhood Laws as constitutional.League of Cities of the Philippines v. COMELEC.(Resolution) G.R. No. 176951; February 15, 2011; J. Bersamin On April 12, 2011, the Court upheld its ruling with finality that the Cityhood Laws are constitutional. The Court ratiocinated that: > “We should not ever lose sight of the fact that the 16 cities covered by the > Cityhood Laws not only had conversion bills pending during the 11th > Congress, but have also complied with the requirements of the LGC prescribed > prior to its amendment by RA No. 9009. Congress undeniably gave these cities > all the considerations that justice and fair play demanded. Hence, this > Court should do no less by stamping its imprimatur to the clear and > unmistakable legislative intent and by duly recognizing the certain > collective wisdom of Congress.” Hence, the 16 municipalities were finally converted into component cities. == Aftermath == The League of Cities of the Philippines finally recognized the sixteen newly converted cities in the country, called as the “League of 16,” as its official members on July 19, 2013. ==See also== * League of Cities of the Philippines ==References== * alt= This article incorporates text from Philippine Supreme Court documents, which are in the public domain.

The railway was a major factor in developing Hunstanton as a seaside resort and residential community. The company was allied to the West Norfolk Junction Railway which built a line connecting Heacham, south of Hunstanton, to Wells-next-the-Sea that was not a financial success. The companies amalgamated in 1874 to form the Hunstanton and West Norfolk Railway, and in 1890 the company was sold to the Great Eastern Railway. The Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, acquired an estate at Sandringham, Norfolk, and Wolferton station was used by the Royal Family and visiting heads of state. Hunstanton developed a thriving holiday trade, and day trip excursions became popular. After 1950 decline set in, and the Wells line closed to passengers in 1952; Hunstanton through trains to and from London ended in 1960 and further decline resulted in closure in 1969. ==Promotion and construction== In 1846 efforts were made to promote Hunstanton as a seaside resort, and by the mid 1850s businesses were keen to attract visitors. The East Anglian Railway subsidised two omnibus services to Hunstanton from Lynn even though the town had a population of fewer than 500 people in 1861.D I Gordon, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 5: the Eastern Counties, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1977, The northern part of the Lynn and Ely Railway reached King's Lynn, known locally as Lynn, in 1846.Leslie Oppitz, Lost Railways of East Anglia, Countryside Books, Newbury, 1999, reprint 2000, Lynn was 16 miles from Hunstanton and a railway connection was projected. A Parliamentary Bill for the line from Lynn to Hunstanton gained Royal Assent on 1 August 1861. The Lynn and Hunstanton Railway was incorporated, with authorised capital of £60,000. The terminus at New Hunstanton, south of the old centre was where development was possible.Cecil J Allen, The Great Eastern Railway, Ian Allan Ltd, Shepperton, fifth edition, 1968G W J Potter, The Great Eastern Railway in West Norfolk, in the Railway Magazine, June 1910 The engineer for the line was John Sutherland Valentine. Finance was raised and the first sod was cut on 13 November 1861. Construction over the relatively flat terrain was completed in ten months within budget.Stanley C Jenkins, The Lynn and Hunstanton Railway and the West Norfolk Branch, The Oakwood Press, Usk, second edition 2011, ==Opening== Hunstanton railway station The Board of Trade inspection, required for passenger operation, took place in September 1862, and the line opened for traffic on 3 October 1862. The line was worked by the Great Eastern Railway for 50% of receipts. The Times reported: > Railway Intelligence... Lynn and Hunstanton: This line was opened for > traffic on Friday. The first train started at a little after noon, and > conveyed the directors, contractors, and officers of the company, > shareholders and others, to the number of about 150. A luncheon was served > at the Hunstanton terminus. The line is 15 miles in length from the junction > with the East Anglian division of the Great Eastern [Railway] at Gaywood > [immediately north of King's Lynn], and its cost amounted altogether to only > £80,000. The late Mr. L'Estrange, the proprietor of Hunstanton [Estate], > sold the land for about miles of the line at its agricultural value, and > took the price in shares... > The Wolverton [Wolferton] station is on the estate of the Prince of Wales > (through which the line runs for nearly three miles), and is to be enlarged > at the expense and for the accommodation of his Royal Highness. The > Hunstanton terminus is near the verge of the cliffs. The line is worked by > the Great Eastern Railway Company.The Times (newspaper), 6 October 1862 Wolferton signal boxThe Sandringham Estate had been purchased in February 1862 for the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII. The company was successful and a shareholders' meeting in August 1864, reported receipts of £3,500, and the profit after expenses was £1,372. A dividend of 4.5% was declared; by 1865 dividends of 6% were being distributed. ==Extending to Wells== Snettisham railway station The line's success led businesses to consider whether the North Norfolk coast, eastwards from Hunstanton, could be opened up by a railway. Plans were made for a nominally independent company to build the West Norfolk Junction Railway, a lightly constructed line feeding into the Lynn and Hunstanton Railway, possibly a tramway alongside public roads. A conventional railway was made, and the West Norfolk Junction Railway obtained Royal Assent on 23 June 1864. The line ran from Heacham, the first station south of Hunstanton, to the terminus of the Wells and Fakenham Railway at Wells. It was 18 miles long, and the authorised capital was £75,000. The new company could run trains to Hunstanton and Wells Harbour. The Great Eastern Railway subscribed £30,000 and agreed to work the line for 50% of gross receipts.Stanley C Jenkins, The Wells-next-the-Sea Branch via Wymondham and Dereham, The Oakwood Press, Usk, second edition 2011, Construction was swift and on 8 January 1866 the Prince and Princess of Wales had a semi-private journey several months before the official opening when they travelled to Holkham Hall to visit the Earl of Leicester. The first Board of Trade inspection refused consent to open he line because of shortcomings in the signalling arrangements. After they were rectified, the line opened 17 August 1866. Wells-next-the-Sea railway station The line curved sharply north at Wells to use Wells and Fakenham Railway station on the line that had opened in 1857. Another platform was provided for West Norfolk trains. Triangular junctions were planned at Heacham and Wells, but although a west curve formation was made at Wells, no track was laid, and no work was done at Heacham. At Heacham the line faced away from Hunstanton. There were generally four trains each way between Wells and Heacham, five on Saturdays and market days. In the earliest days passenger trains ran from Lynn to Wells via Hunstanton, passing Heacham twice; but soon most services terminated at Heacham apart from one through working to Hunstanton, which continued northwards after reversal at the junction. Goods services consisted of one return working between King's Lynn and Wells. The financial crisis in 1866 following the failure of Overend, Gurney and Company's bank and an outbreak of cattle plague in North Norfolk hit the company's income: receipts amounted to £1,355 for the final quarter year of 1866, and no dividend was paid. After the financial success of the Lynn and Hunstanton line, this was a disappointment but the course of the line, which was some distance from the coast and the towns and villages situated on it, militated against its use for goods and passenger purposes. ==Amalgamations== An excursion train from Coalville to Hunstanton, entering King's Lynn station in 1956 The West Norfolk Railway was allied with the Lynn and Hunstanton Railway, and they amalgamated by Act of 8 June 1874, becoming the Hunstanton and West Norfolk Railway. The Lynn and Hunstanton main line was relatively successful but smaller railways became more fragile in the latter decades of the 19th century, and on 1 July 1890 the Lynn and Hunstanton Railway was sold to the Great Eastern Railway for £160,000 and £5,000 for legal expenses. ==Growth from 1890== In the final years of the century, Hunstanton developed as a holiday resort, not only for holiday stays, but many wealthy business people lived there and travelled to London for business. Golfing stays at Hunstanton became popular and from 1905, a Sunday restaurant car express from London was provided specifically for golfers. As traffic developed, the track was doubled over the southern part of the line and completed between King's Lynn and Wolferton in 1898. The Royal Family spent a lot of time at Sandringham. Royal trains reversed at King's Lynn where operation by local engines and crews took over. In London they ran to St Pancras station over the Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway line. Liverpool Street station was not used because royalty entering the City of London required ceremonial procedures, which were not always expedient. Between 1884 and 1911, 645 royal trains used Wolferton station. Ordinary express passenger trains ran to St Pancras, or conveyed coaches for St Pancras that were slipped at Tottenham Hale or detached there. In the 1930s, Sunday excursions, particularly Sunday schools, and long distance holiday trains became dominant. West Norfolk trains terminated at Heacham, not usually running through to Hunstanton. There was no runround facility at Wells and after disembarking the passengers, the engine propelled the coaches back up the gradient, and after shunting the engine, the coaches were run down to the station by gravity. Pullman cars were run on some trains from 1921, but were not popular. From 1929, a day excursion train from London, the Eastern Belle, ran to different seaside destinations from day to day, and typically visited Hunstanton every two weeks on a Tuesday. In 1937 Hunstanton station was enlarged. Its four platforms were lengthened, and accommodation for passenger stock and locomotives was extended. After World War II there was heavy holiday traffic on the line, especially on Sundays, when a one way system was operated: nearly all incoming trains ran in the morning and all outgoing trains in the afternoon and evening. From 1949 a named train, The Fenman ran from Liverpool Street to Hunstanton. Heacham also began to develop as a holiday destination. ==Decline after 1950== Poor passenger business on the West Norfolk line resulted in closure to passengers; the last passenger trains ran on Saturday 31 May 1952; but a special Pilgrims' train ran from Kettering to Walsingham on 29 June 1952. Heavy flooding in early 1953 caused the line to be breached at Holkham. The line was not reinstated as it was only open to goods traffic; the stub from Heacham to Burnham was retained for goods traffic, but was closed after 28 December 1964. The 1953 floods engulfed a train on the main line north of Heacham on 31 January 1953; the train was stranded, and the line was not repaired until 23 February 1953. On the main line, diesel multiple units were introduced from 3 November 1958, and through trains from Liverpool Street to Hunstanton were withdrawn in November 1960, the branch passenger service was operated as a shuttle from King's Lynn. Operation as a basic railway was brought in from 6 June 1966 in an attempt to contain costs. Hunstanton station was reduced to a single platform from 12 February 1967 and reductions in operating facilities followed when the one engine in steam system was instituted from Wolferton to Hunstanton on 5 March 1967. King's Lynn to Wolferton was reduced to single track on 2 April 1967 when the line was worked as a single section and a no-signalman key token instrument was placed at Hunstanton.. Despite this an investment of £25,000 was made that year in the shape of automatic half-barrier level crossing gates. All freight was withdrawn on the line in 1964. The line closed on 5 May 1969.Neil Burgess, Norfolk's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing Ltd, Catrine, 2016, ==Topography== Main line: * Lynn; opened 27 October 1846; relocated 27 August 1871; renamed King's Lynn 1911; * Salters Road Junction; connection to the Alexandra Dock branch; * Gaywood Junction; former divergence of the Lynn and Fakenham Railway; * Wootton; opened 3 October 1862; renamed North Wootton July 1869; closed 5 May 1969; * Wolverton; opened 3 October 1862; renamed Wolferton 15 July 1863; closed 5 May 1969; * Dersingham; opened 3 October 1862; closed 5 May 1969; * Snettisham; opened 3 October 1862; closed 5 May 1969; * Heacham; opened 3 October 1862; closed 5 May 1969; * Hunstanton; opened 3 October 1862; closed 5 May 1969; * Heacham; above; * Sedgeford; opened 17 August 1866; closed 2 June 1952; * Docking; opened 17 August 1866; closed 2 June 1952; * Stanhoe; opened 17 August 1866; closed 2 June 1952; * Burnham; opened 17 August 1866; renamed Burnham Market 1 June 1883; closed 2 June 1952; * Holkham; opened 17 August 1866; closed 2 June 1952; * Wells; opened by Wells and Fakenham Railway 1 December 1857; renamed Wells-on-Sea 1 July 1923; renamed Wells-next-the-Sea 1 January 1957; closed 5 October 1964.M E Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England Scotland and Wales—A Chronology, The Railway and Canal Historical Society, 2002 ==References External links == * 1962 John Betjeman film of Kings Lynn to Hunstanton journey Category:Rail transport in Norfolk ","title":"Lynn and Hunstanton Railway"},{"id":"56766218","text":"Barrientosiimonas humi is a bacterium from the genus of Barrientosiimonas which has been isolated from soil from the Barrientos Island in the Antarctica. ==References== Category:Actinobacteria Category:Bacteria described in 2013 ","title":"Barrientosiimonas humi"},{"id":"56766221","text":"Richard Alan Kayne is an American billionaire private equity investor and the majority owner of Kayne Anderson Capital Advisers, which he founded in 1984 and has $26 billion in assets under management. ==Biography== Kayne was born to a Jewish family, the son of Ida and Jerry Kayne.

This attack was planned to commence at exactly the same time as the attack by the Air Force on the camp at Westlands Farm (or Freedom camp as it was called by the insurgents belonging to the ZIPRA). * Phase 3: The third, and final, phase of the operation would involve an attack by the Rhodesian Light Infantry, the RLI, on another ZIPRA base located near the Great North Road, approximately 15km north of Lusaka. The camp was referred to as the CGT-2 (Communist Guerrilla Training Camp) by the Rhodesians. ==The Operation== Led by Squadron Leader Chris Dixon, who identified himself to Lusaka Airport tower as \\"Green Leader\\", a Rhodesian Air Force group flew into Zambia at very low altitudes (thereby avoiding Zambian radar) and took control of the country's airspace for about a quarter of an hour during the initial assault on Westlands Farm, informing Lusaka tower that the attack was against \\"Rhodesian dissidents, and not against Zambia\\", and that Rhodesian Hawker Hunters were circling the Zambian airfields under orders to shoot down any fighter that attempted to take off. The Zambians obeyed all of Green Leader's instructions, made no attempt to resist and temporarily halted civil air traffic. The Security Forces used the Rufunsa airstrip in eastern Zambia as a forward base against the guerrillas' bases. ==Aftermath== During the course of Operation Gatling the RSF suffered only minor casualties during the three-day operation, and afterwards claimed to have killed over 1,500 ZIPRA cadres, as well as some Cuban instructors. A further 1,348 were wounded and 198 were missing- after the end of the operation- during the course of the three day operation. In addition to those losses ZIPRA Logistics Officer Mountain Guru was captured by the security forces. Where as in comparison only one member of the SAS had been killed, the SAS trooper in question who had been killed during the operation killed was Jeff Collett. Three other members of the security forces were wounded during Operation Gatling. Two out of the three men wounded were helicopter pilots, Mark Dawson and Roelf Oeloffse, who sustained injuries when their Alouette K-Car was hit by cannon fire causing it to crash. Dawson suffered injuries to one of his legs and Roelf sustained injuries to his back. In total the Rhodesians only suffered four casualties and lost one helicopter during the operation. ==ReferencesBibliography=== * * * Category:Battles and operations of the Rhodesian Bush War Category:1978 in Zambia ","title":"Operation Gatling"},{"id":"56766371","text":"The English Open was a professional golf tournament on the European Tour from 1988 to 2002.

There were quotas brought in to limit the number of competitors (particularly from the United States and Canada), which are highly competitive in the two events. for the 2010 Olympics the quota system limited the competition for men and women's freestyle skiing (moguls, aerials, and ski-cross) to 180 athletes. Irrespective of international ranking, each country could only have eighteen athletes, and a maximum of ten men or ten women. With the addition of slopestyle and half-pipe in the Sochi Olympics in 2014 the quotas were increased to 282 total athletes, 26 per country, and 14 per gender. This resulted in countries having to limit their participation, despite having eligible athletes. For example, Canada could have sent 33 participants based on international ranking, however they were limited to 26 quota spots. For the 2018 Winter Olympics, the number of athletes participating remained the same, but the number of quota spots increased to a maximum of thirty per country. ===Snowboarding=== Snowboarding has a similar quota program to freestyle skiing, with 26 spots available per country. For the 2018 Winter Olympics the only country to fill all of its quota spots was the United States. ===Bobsleigh=== For the 2018 Winter Olympics, a maximum of 170 athletes could compete, and a maximum of three teams per event, with the host nation allotted at least one space. ==References== Quota Category:Quotas ","title":"Olympic quota allocation system"}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function F(s,a,o,c,u,t){const m=p("PoemCard");return i(),n(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Life Quotes🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",I,[(i(!0),n(h,null,y(t.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(i(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),t.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>t.loadMore&&t.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const L=d(R,[["render",F]]),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/58.md","filePath":"people/58.md"}'),H={name:"people/58.md"},N=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[C(L)]))}});export{x as __pageData,N as default};
