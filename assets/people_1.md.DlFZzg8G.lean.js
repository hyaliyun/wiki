Warren was convicted (in 1995) due to his confession to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. In 2003, Warren again confessed to the bombing, saying that he acted alone. This second confession followed the decision by the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted, to drop their investigation of the case. During testimony at a July 2004 lawsuit (filed by the widows of the victims), Warren blamed poor security, his union (now part of the CAW union Judge Sends Two Yellowknife Miners To Jail) and the company that owned the mine, Royal Oak Mines Incorporated, for provoking him. He claimed that a simple screen and padlock over a broken window would have dissuaded him, and that he was only capable of the bombing because strike- breakers had been \\"dehumanized\\" by his union. He also claimed that \\"(his) termination resulted in the deaths of nine men.\\" He became eligible for parole in 2010, applied for day parole in mid-March 2014, and was granted after a hearing on June 17, 2014.

Complications ensue when Darcy becomes pregnant just before graduation and decides to keep her baby. This movie is noted for being Ringwald's final \\"teen\\" movie, and is cited as one of her most mature performances, particularly in a scene where Darcy is suffering from postpartum depression after the birth of her child. ==Plot== In Kenosha, Wisconsin, Darcy, editor at her high school paper, and her steady boyfriend Stan are in their final year of high school and already have been accepted at good colleges. Before Darcy goes to the University of Wisconsin to study journalism, she will go on a trip to Paris with her mother for her graduation present, while Stan will go to Caltech to study architecture. With the help of Darcy's best friend Lila, Darcy and Stan spend a weekend together and Darcy becomes pregnant. They announce the pregnancy to their families at Thanksgiving. Neither Darcy's single parent mother Donna nor Stan's Catholic parents are very supportive. Respectively, they urge the young couple to have an abortion or give up the baby for adoption. Darcy plans to have an abortion, but does not go through with it, much to Stan's relief. At Christmas, the kids announce their plans to keep the baby, causing a break between them and their parents. They rent a decrepit apartment and marry to the cheers of their friends, despite the fact that without parental consent the marriage is not legal. At the urging of her high school guidance counselor, who explains that other girls will want to emulate her and become adolescent mothers themselves, Darcy drops out of high school but works toward her GED. Prom is interrupted by Darcy's water breaking. Although baby Thea (short for Theodosia) is healthy, Darcy suffers from post-partum depression, unable to even hold her daughter, and Stan struggles to pay the bills on a part-time job salary. Only when Darcy hears an intruder (who turns out to be Stan's father) and picks up her baby protectively does she break from her depression. Without telling Darcy, Stan sacrifices his Caltech scholarship because there is no married housing at the school for undergraduates. Stan and Darcy‚Äôs relationship starts to crumble with fights. Although Stan takes a second dead-end job, the bills pile up, and the couple finally moves in with Donna, which alienates Stan and Darcy, and causes Stan to drink heavily. Local neighborhood girl Michaela informs Darcy of the scholarship deception so she enlists Stan's best friend Chris in a plan to ensure he take the scholarship and go to college after all. The plan entails throwing Stan out and annulling the marriage. Stan has a bad reaction to the news and later in the night goes into a rage outside their house. Stan reconciles with his parents, but is heartbroken over the split with Darcy, who does not change her mind but becomes visibly angrily at her mother's cold attitude. At Darcy's night school graduation, Stan arrives to inform Darcy that he has applied for scholarships to the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison for them both. Darcy lets slip her role in the Caltech deception with Chris, and Stan chases after her as she drives away. Darcy finally tells Donna that Stan is a good man, that she loves him and Donna can either embrace them as an entire family or watch them live their lives without her. They reconcile intending to go forward with their plans to attend college in Madison in the fall. ==Cast== * Molly Ringwald as Darcy Bobrucz * Randall Batinkoff as Stan Bobrucz * Kenneth Mars as Mr. Bobrucz * Miriam Flynn as Donna Elliot * Conchata Ferrell as Mrs. Bobrucz * Sharon Brown as Lila * John Zarchen as Chris * Pauly Shore as Ryan * Michelle Downey as Michaela * Patricia Barry as Adoption Official * Janet MacLachlan as Miss Giles * Jaclyn-Rose Lester as Mary Bobrucz (as Jaclyn Bernstein) * Matthew Licht as Leo Bobrucz * Ren√©e Estevez as Marnie * Darcy DeMoss as Elaine ==ProductionFilming=== The film is set in Kenosha, Wisconsin and was partially filmed there. Primary location work took place in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The film had a number of titles while in production, possibilities including \\"Maybe, Baby\\" (by which it is known in some overseas territories) and \\"For Keeps?\\", before settling on the final question mark-less version. John Zarchen suffered a life-threatening head injury while driving in Hollywood. He survived a brief period of being comatose, and actually returned to the film, although director John Avildsen, due to his medical absence and disgusted with the actor's disregard for the opportunity and the production, greatly cut down his role. This movie also marks the film debut of Pauly Shore, who appears in a small role as another friend of Stan. The musical score features a lullaby-like version of the song \\"Be My Baby\\", sung by composer Ellie Greenwich. ===Casting=== Actor Adam Silbar was originally cast in the lead role of Stan but, for unknown reasons, the role was later re-cast with Randall Batinkoff just weeks before the first day of production. Author and casting director Paul G. Bens, Jr., then an actor, was one of the two finalists to replace Silbar. The role ultimately went to Batinkoff. ==ReleaseCritical reception=== Rotten Tomatoes aggregate score gave the film an 18% rotten rating based on 11 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review saying, \\"The movies of Molly Ringwald have been responsible for a revolution in the way Hollywood regards teenagers. Before Ringwald (and her mentor, John Hughes) there were only horny teenagers, dead teenagers, teenage vampires and psychotic crackups. Now teenage movies are working their way through some of the aspects of the normal life of American teenagers, and in 'For Keeps,' Ringwald plays a popular high school senior who gets pregnant and gets married.\\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times said, \\"Most of For Keeps is entirely predictable, but that should do little to diminish its interest for audiences of high-school age. Here again, Miss Ringwald is the very model of teen-age verisimilitude, and she's most impressive in making even the most hackneyed situations seem real. In fact, she's so good she's almost a problem. Mr. Batinkoff, while pleasant, is no real match for her, and the glowering parents who make their kids' lives miserable for a time are no real threat. There is the feeling that Miss Ringwald's Darcy can triumph over anything. But perhaps that's just what Mr. Avildsen had in mind.\\" Judge Brian Pope gave a positive review saying, \\"Pretty but approachable, smart but funny, cool but sweet, Ringwald represented everything most high-school girls wanted to be: the girl next door who always got the guy without compromising her values. Small wonder she is still regarded as an icon of 1980s teen cinema. It wasn't until Ringwald began dipping her toes into slightly more adult roles that she lost her footing. Take 'For Keeps', for instance. This movie dared to suggest that even a popular honors student is capable of making wrong decisions that result in life-changing consequences. More crucially, Ringwald suggested to her fans that the qualities they found so endearing in her aren't always adequate substitutes for natural maturity. Perhaps that was a bitter pill for her fans to swallow, but it's not such a bad message, and, more than 15 years after its release, 'For Keeps' isn't such a bad movie.\\" David Nusair gave a more negative review saying, \\"For Keeps takes a potentially intriguing subject (two teenagers attempting to start their lives together) and piles on cliche after cliche, until it's about as compelling as an afterschool special.\\" ===Box office=== In January 1988, the film debuted at #4 at the box office (behind Good Morning, Vietnam, Three Men and a Baby, and Moonstruck). Grossing $17,514,553 domestically, the film is a box office success given its estimated budget of $10 million. ===Home media=== On March 23, 2004 the film was released on DVD. ==ReferencesCategory:1988 films Category:1980s teen comedy-drama films Category:American teen comedy-drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Bill Conti Category:Films directed by John G.

The airport is named after former Fort Worth Mayor Henry C. Meacham.Meacham Field History Texas State Historical Association The airport covers 745 acres (301 ha). ==History== Civilian training school students and instructors at Meacham Field in 1942. Meacham Airport was purchased by the city of Fort Worth on July 3, 1925, named Fort Worth Municipal Airport. In 1927 the airport was renamed Meacham Field after former Fort Worth Mayor Henry C. Meacham. Meacham was Fort Worth's airline airport until April 1953 when major carriers moved to Amon Carter Field (later Greater Southwest International Airport). The January 1953 OAG shows 50 weekday airline departures from Meacham, 33 of which headed for Dallas. None of the others flew nonstop north of Wichita Falls, west of Midland, south of Austin or east of Dallas. Since 1953 Meacham Airport has been used for corporate aircraft, commuter flights, and student pilot training. It was renamed in 1985 to Fort Worth Meacham Airport and in 1995 to Fort Worth Meacham International Airport. Since 1953 seven airlines have tried scheduled passenger flights from Meacham; none lasted more than a couple of years. * Tejas Airlines (1979‚Äì80) flew Fairchild Swearingen Metroliners to Austin, Houston, Corpus Christi, San Antonio, and Laredo * Metro Airlines (1979‚Äì81) flew DHC-6 Twin Otters * Fort Worth Airlines (1984‚Äì85) flew NAMC YS-11s * Exec Express Airlines (1987‚Äì88), later Lone Star Airlines, flew Dornier Do 328s * Mesa Airlines (1997‚Äì98) flew Canadair CRJ regional jets In April 2006 low-cost carrier Skybus Airlines expressed interest in operating out of the airfield as it started operations in 2007, but it folded before the repeal of the Wright Amendment in 2014.The Airline News April 7, 2006 On 16 April 2008, the American Airways Hangar and Administration Building, constructed at the airport in 1933, was added to the National Register of Historic Places. On 15 January 2015, the airport advisory board voted to permanently close runway 9/27 to make room for additional hangars. The runway had been closed for about a year due to deteriorating pavement. In 2018, city officials and company founder David Neeleman hinted that a proposed low-cost carrier, tentatively named Moxy, may operate from Meacham starting in 2020. City aviation director Bill Welstead denied holding discussions with Moxy but confirmed that Frontier Airlines and Allegiant Air were interested in serving the airport. Although the city has recently spent millions of dollars on several projects to improve airport facilities for general aviation, Welstead claimed that the city was not actively planning to build adequate terminal parking for passengers, which he said would be necessary before commercial airline service could begin. ==Current operations== Several companies operate aircraft services at the airport, including a division of the U.S. defense contractor Alliant Techsystems (ATK) and Texas Aviation Services . An aviation museum (open weekends and by appointment during the week) is located in Hangar 33S on the airport's south side, at the end of Ellis Street. The terminal building houses several ATK employees, some Fort Worth city departments (mainly Aviation and Housing Development), a branch of Enterprise Rent-A-Car, and several aviation related businesses. The Civil Air Patrol operates two squadrons at Meacham, the Fort Worth Senior Squadron, and the Phoenix Composite Squadron. There are three FBOs operating on the field: American Aero, Cornerstone Flight Center and Texas Jet. ===Airlines and destinations=== At one time Fort Worth Airlines had its headquarters at the airport.\\"World Airline Directory.\\" Flight International.

The pilot and sole occupant suffered minor injuries. * 6 March 1984: The right-hand engine of a Piper PA-23-250, registration number N777RG, failed on takeoff after a touch-and-go landing. Although another runway aligned with the takeoff runway was only ahead, the pilots did not attempt to reach it, and instead executed an immediate forced landing in a nearby open field. The aircraft was destroyed but the two pilots, who were the sole occupants, were not injured. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators found the fuel selector in the OFF position for the right-hand engine, causing fuel starvation. The accident was attributed to the improper fuel selector position, poor judgment by the pilots, and failure to understand and follow proper emergency procedures. * 25 June 1989: A Cessna 152, registration number N24795, rolled to the left and stalled after controllers advised the pilots to go around due to shifting winds. The ensuing crash and post-crash fire destroyed the aircraft and killed the two pilots. The accident was attributed to \\"The inadvertent stall of the airplane by the pilot. Factors contributing to the accident were the pilot's disregard of the weather advisory, the unfavorable windshift, and the thunderstorm outflow.\\" * 20 November 1996: A Piper PA-28R-200 Arrow, registration number N1394T, crashed into power lines on final approach while performing an Instrument Landing System approach at night in low visibility. The aircraft was destroyed and the two pilots were killed. The accident was attributed to \\"the pilots' continued descent of the aircraft below decision height. Factors contributing to the accident were the fog, the dark night illumination, one of the pilot's impairment due to use of marihuana, and both pilots' fatigue.\\" * 27 February 1998: A Douglas A4D-2 Skyhawk, registration number N21NB, BuNo 145011, overran Runway 34R on landing and was substantially damaged; the pilot suffered minor injuries. On approach to the airport, the pilot told controllers that he was experiencing engine surges and a \\"total system failure.\\" The pilot lowered the landing gear using the emergency extension procedure, but the engine surged again, causing the aircraft to touch down at a higher speed than intended, and the pilot was unable to stop the aircraft on the runway. The accident was attributed to \\"A total hydraulic system failure for an undetermined reason.\\" The aircraft, painted in Royal Australian Navy colors, was later restored and placed on static display at the Air Zoo at Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport. ==References== ==External links== * http://www.skymavs.com/ * http://www.skymavs.com/pilot-training * Fort Worth Meacham International Airport * Epic Helicopters LLC * Civil Air Patrol, Phoenix Composite Squadron Category:Airports established in 1925 Category:Airports in Fort Worth, Texas Category:Airports in Tarrant County, Texas ","title":"Fort Worth Meacham International Airport"},{"id":"2201002","text":"Hannah Jones is a British female dance music vocalist, who scored Three Top 5 hits on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in the late 1990s.

He was drafted by the New England Patriots in the fourth round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He played college football at Fresno State. Sanders also played for the Atlanta Falcons and Arizona Cardinals. ==College career== After graduating from Monache High School, Sanders attended Fresno State University, where he played for head coach Pat Hill, a former assistant under Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, then coach of the Cleveland Browns. As a freshman in 2002, Sanders was a first-team freshman All-American selection by the Football Writers Association of America and an All-WAC honorable mention. He started every game at strong safety for the second straight year in his 2003 sophomore season, earning first-team All-WAC honors. In his junior season in 2004, Sanders again earned All-WAC honors in what would prove to be his final season at Fresno State. ==Professional careerNew England Patriots=== Sanders was drafted by the New England Patriots in the fourth round of the 2005 NFL Draft (133rd overall). He was subsequently signed by the Patriots in July 2005. He played in 10 games as a rookie in 2005, starting twice. In a Week 14 game against the Buffalo Bills, Sanders returned an interception late in the game 39 yards for a touchdown. Sanders started five of the 16 games he played in during the 2006 season, filling in for an injured Rodney Harrison. During the 2007 season, fellow safety Eugene Wilson lost his starting spot to Sanders, who went on to start 15 games in the regular season and Super Bowl XLII. He started 14 games in 2008, missing two games in December due to an injury. In March 2009, Sanders agreed to terms with the Patriots on a three- year contract. It was reported that Sanders turned down more money elsewhere to return to the Patriots. During an August 2, 2009 press conference, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick spoke of Sanders: Sanders started the first game of the 2009 season before losing his job to Brandon McGowan in Week 2. He suffered a shoulder injury in Week 4 and missed the team's Week 5 game. He regained his starting job in Week 14, and started the final four games of the season as well as the Patriots' playoff loss to the Baltimore Ravens. He finished the season with 48 tackles. In 2010, Sanders opened the regular season as a starter in the Patriots' base defense following the demotion of Brandon Meriweather, and started two of the first three games. After Meriweather returned as a starter in Week 4, Sanders was the team's third safety until he filled in for an injured Patrick Chung in Weeks 8 and 9. In Week 10, Sanders did not start but was named AFC Defensive Player of the Week after intercepting a Ben Roethlisberger pass and returning it 32 yards for a touchdown in a win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. In the next game against the Indianapolis Colts, Sanders made a game-saving interception at the Patriots' 6-yard line with seconds remaining when he picked off quarterback Peyton Manning's throw as the Colts offense (already in field goal range) was poised to score and either tie the game or take the lead with a touchdown. Sanders finished the 2010 season with 58 tackles, three interceptions, and one forced fumble in 15 games played (nine starts). He was released by New England on August 29, 2011. ===Atlanta Falcons=== On August 30, 2011, Sanders signed with the Atlanta Falcons. ===Arizona Cardinals=== Sanders signed with the Arizona Cardinals on April 4, 2012.James Sanders says he‚Äôs signing with Cardinals ==References== ==External links== * New England Patriots bio Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:People from Porterville, California Category:Players of American football from California Category:African- American players of American football Category:American football safeties Category:Fresno State Bulldogs football players Category:New England Patriots players Category:Atlanta Falcons players Category:Arizona Cardinals players ","title":"James Sanders (American football)"},{"id":"2201041","text":"The Fatty Knees fibreglass sailing dinghies were designed by Lyle Hess (1912‚Äì2002).

The area around the beach is very developed, featuring many residential high rises and shopping centers.\\"Top 5 Beaches to Visit in Busan\\" Retrieved October 11, 2019 ==Film and television== Haeundae is popular in South Korean media as a setting or filming location due to being one of South Korea's most famous beaches and affluent communities. The district was the setting of the movie Haeundae, a South Korean disaster movie based on the relatively unlikely scenario of an immense tsunami hitting the city of Busan. Haeundae has been featured in numerous K-Dramas, with the beach and Dongbaekseom Island being used as a filming location for Seoul Broadcasting System's 2008 drama Star's Lover. The island was the location for the scene where Lee Ma-ri, played by Choi Ji-woo confesses her love for Kim Chul Soo, played by Yoo Ji-tae; and the couple takes a walk on the beach. In 2012, KBS2 broadcast a drama, Haeundae Lovers, using Busan and the district as a backdrop. Much of the story takes place in Cheongsapo, a coastal community in the district east of Haeundae Beach. Hauendae is home to the Busan Cinema Center, the location of the annual Busan International Film Festival, which features 5 inside theaters and 1 outside theater. == Food of Haeundae == Haeundae is also a popular culinary destination, boasting both traditional and foreign cuisines. Many restaurants sell dwaejigukbab (pork rice soup), one of Busan's signature dishes. The market has a wide array of seafood available, notably eel. Gumsu-Bukkuk, South Korea's most famous puffer fish stew restaurant, has its original location in Haeundae. Additionally, visitors can buy seafood from food trucks that line the beachfront. Haeundae has a relatively large expatriate population (in Busan) and foreign cuisines are relatively popular, including Indian, Brazilian, and American. High-end cuisine can be found in many of Haeundae's hotels, as well as in Centum City and on Dalmaji Hill. ==Administrative divisions== Administrative divisions Lighthouse at Haeundae Beach Haeundae-gu is divided into 7 legal dong, which altogether comprise 18 administrative dong, as follows: * U-dong (2 administrative dong) * Jung-dong (2 administrative dong) * Jwa-dong (4 administrative dong) * Songjeong-dong * Banyeo-dong (4 administrative dong) * Bansong-dong (3 administrative dong) * Jaesong-dong (2 administrative dong) ==Notable people== * Jeung Eun-ji (Singer) * An Jae Mo (Actor) * Kang Seung-yoon (Singer) ==Sister cities== * Para√±aque City, Philippines == Gallery == File:View of Eastern Haeundae, Including Dalmaji Hill.jpgDalmaji Hill File:View of the Haeundae Skyline.pngMarine City ==See also== * Busan * Busan International Film Festival * Centum City * List of Korea-related topics * Geography of South Korea ==References== ==External links== * Haeundae-gu website (in English) * Haeundae tour website (in English) Category:Districts of Busan ","title":"Haeundae District"},{"id":"2201062","text":"Azza Transport Company was a cargo airline based in Khartoum, Sudan.

Calderone began to dabble with turntables and other DJ-related equipment at the age of 15. A decade later, in 1991, music mogul Seymour Stein signed both Calderone and his partner Gene LaFosse (they collaborated on a short-lived techno act called Program 2) to a contract deal with Sire Records. Shortly after the release of their first album, the group disbanded and Calderone took a self- imposed exile away from the music industry.Straight Outta Brooklyn If Madonna Calls DJs Should Listen Victor Calderone Did & His Remixes Helped Propel Him to Global DJ Status from DJ Times date November 1999.Victor Calderone Biography, Residentadvisor.net During the time he removed himself from the club music industry, Calderone worked in the restaurant business but eventually was encouraged to work on new projects including his first solo record, \\"Give It Up\\". Calderone later returned to #1 for two weeks in 2001 with \\"Are You Satisfied?,\\" featuring vocals by Deborah Cooper. Further inspired by New York's then-thriving club scene, Calderone landed gigs at many major events in the city. Calderone obtained residencies at both the Roxy in New York and Liquid in Miami Beach. He then met and commenced a successful relationship with Madonna in 1998. Impressed by Calderone's innovative vision and style, he was commissioned to remix \\"Frozen\\", the first single released from her Ray of Light album. Since 1998, he has remixed eleven other singles for Madonna: Ray of Light, Sky Fits Heaven, Skin, Beautiful Stranger, American Pie, Music, Don't Tell Me, What it Feels like for a Girl, Die Another Day, Hollywood. Following up on Madonna's recommendation, Sting selected Calderone to remix his song \\"Desert Rose,\\" the second single from his 1999 Brand New Day album. The British singer did not only hire Calderone to remix the single, which was something he had never done before with his music, but even returned to the studio with him to re-record the vocals to match the remixed song's new dance-oriented rhythms. The song spent 80 weeks on the Billboard dance chart including nine consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart. Besides his work with Madonna and Sting, his credits as remixer includes work for such artists as Beyonc√© Knowles, Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson, and Sarah Brightman, amongst others. He has also collaborated with other house music producers‚Äîincluding Mac Quayle and most notably Peter Rauhofer, the first Grammy Award winner in the Dance Music category. Their joint effort, known as The Collaboration released a popular multi-CD set and several hit single tracks. After a long string of successful albums and singles, Calderone established his Evolve brand in 2005 as a way to coalesce his numerous residencies around the world, including Montreal, Tel Aviv, Bulgaria, and a monthly residency at New York's Pacha. With the Evolve brand now taking off globally, clubgoers have quickly begun to equate the word with joy-inducing, risk-taking sets that shatter musical boundaries and the conventions of what a DJ set ‚Äúshould‚Äù be. ===Personal life=== Calderone resides with his wife Athena, and their son in Brooklyn. == Discography  Albums === * 1999: E=VC¬≤ * 2001: E=VC¬≤, Vol. 2 * 2003: Resonate * 2004: Statrax Unmixed, Vol. 1 * 2007: Evolve === Singles/EPs === * 1997: \\"Give It Up\\" * 1997: \\"Beat Me Harder\\" * 1997: \\"The Price of Love\\" * 1999: \\"Give It Up 2000\\" * 1999: \\"In Front (Wan It)\\" * 2001: \\"Are You Satisfied?\\" * 2002: \\"The Drive\\" * 2003: \\"Deep Dark Jungle\\" * 2004: \\"Resonate\\" * 2010: \\"Boarding Pass / Terminal B\\" * 2010: \\"Homegrown\\" * 2011: \\"Pleasure Grip\\" * 2012: \\"The Journey Begins\\" (With Nicole Moudaber) * 2015: \\"Burden\\" * 2015: \\"Requiem\\" (on the compilation A-Sides Volume III) * 2015: \\"Roll EP\\" === Selected remixes === * \\"Soak Up the Sun\\" - Sheryl Crow * \\"Precious\\" - Depeche Mode * \\"Emotion\\" - Destiny's Child * \\"Survivor\\" - Destiny's Child * \\"Heaven's What I Feel\\" - Gloria Estefan * \\"Push It\\" - Garbage * \\"Strict Machine\\" - Goldfrapp * \\"Audience\\" - Ayumi Hamasaki * \\"Insatiable\\" - Darren Hayes * \\"Naughty Girl\\" - Beyonc√© Knowles * \\"Work It Out\\" - Beyonc√© Knowles * \\"Independent Women\\" - Destiny's Child * \\"American Pie\\" - Madonna * \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" - Madonna * \\"Die Another Day\\" - Madonna * \\"Don't Tell Me\\" - Madonna * \\"Frozen\\" - Madonna * \\"Hollywood\\" - Madonna * \\"Music\\" - Madonna * \\"Ray of Light\\" - Madonna * \\"Sky Fits Heaven\\" - Madonna * \\"What It Feels Like for a Girl\\" - Madonna * \\"Lola's Theme\\" - Shapeshifters * \\"Everytime\\" - Britney Spears (unreleased/leaked in 2005) * \\"Never Gonna Fall\\" - Lisa Stansfield ==See also== *List of Number 1 Dance Hits (United States) *List of artists who reached number one on the US Dance chart ==References== ==External links== * Official website * * Victor Calderone at Discogs Category:Club DJs Category:American DJs Category:Remixers Category:Living people Category:American dance musicians Category:American house musicians Category:Musicians from Brooklyn Category:New York City nightlife Category:DJs from New York City Category:1967 births Category:Electronic dance music DJs ","title":"Victor Calderone"},{"id":"2201071","text":"Music For Nations is a British independent record label focusing mainly on rock and metal. It was a subsidiary of the larger label distributor Zomba Records, which was a division of BMG and later Sony Music Entertainment. Launched in 1983 by Martin Hooker, Music For Nations established itself as a European leader in the rock and metal world, with early signings like Tank, Exciter, Metallica (who had three gold albums while on MFN), Slayer and Megadeth paving the way. As Music For Nations grew, the company expanded its operation to include not just licensed acts from the US, but its own signings. It released albums by artists including Paradise Lost, Opeth, Anathema, Cradle of Filth, Testament and countless other metal bands. As well as the traditional metal bands Music For Nations went on to sign up and coming UK bands such as Tigertailz who had a top 40 album while signed to Music For Nations. In 2004, the label closed down. The company's catalogue ‚Äî which had also previously included titles from artists as varied as Lost Horizon, Tigertailz and Frank Zappa ‚Äî was transferred to parent company Zomba Records Group. In December 2011, The End Records signed a distribution deal for 50 of Music For Nations' catalog albums. In February 2015 Music For Nations relaunched through Sony's commercial department, with plans to reissue albums from their catalogue including Anathema, Paradise Lost, Opeth, Spiritual Beggars, Cradle of Filth and others. They also intend to, in the spirit of the label's original purpose, sign original heavy talent for singles, EPs and compilation albums. In October 2017, Music For Nations signed two newcomers, metalcore band Bury Tomorrow and ambient rock band Blanket. In June 2018, American metalcore band Killswitch Engage joined Music For Nations' UK roster; the band's forthcoming album will be marketed by Metal Blade Records in the United States, and internationally through Columbia/Sony. ==Roster== * Acid Drinkers (1990‚Äì1992) (Subsidiary label - Under One Flag) * Agent Steel * Alaska * Amplifier * Anathema * Anthem * Anthrax * Apes, Pigs & Spacemen * Apocalypse * Astroid Boys (Subsidiary label - Under One Flag) * Baby Tuckoo * Battleaxe * Bury Tomorrow * The Beyond * Candlemass * Chrome Molly * Cradle of Filth * Creation of Death (1991‚Äì1992) (Subsidiary label - Under One Flag) * Darkmoon * Dispatched * Dead Potatoes (2003‚Äì2006) * Dearly Beheaded (1995-1998) * Dragon (1990-1991) (Subsidiary label - Under One Flag) * Drive She Said * Earthshaker * Entombed * Exciter * Exodus * The Exploited (Subsidiary label - Rough Justice) * Freak of Nature * Godflesh * Hed PE * Hellion * Helstar * InMe * Killswitch Engage * Legs Diamond * Lost Horizon * Loudness * Lowfive * Manowar * Eric Martin * Meanstreak * Megadeth * Mercyful Fate * Metallica * Mike Tramp * Milk Teeth * Mindfunk * Nightshade * Nuclear Assault * Onslaught * Opeth * Paradise Lost * Simon Phillips * Q5 * Ratt * Rio * The Rods * Rogue Male * Rox * Sarc√≥fago (1985‚Äì1986) * Savatage * Sirrah (1995‚Äì1999) * Spiritual Beggars * Jack Starr * SugarComa (2001‚Äì2003) * Sugarcreek * Suicide Squad * Surgin * Tank * Testament * Thrasher * Tigertailz (1990‚Äì2005) * TKO * Tyketto * Turbo (1990‚Äì1991) (Subsidiary label - Under One Flag) * Robin Trower * Twelfth Night * Tygers of Pan Tang * Venom (1989‚Äì1992) (Subsidiary label - Under One Flag) * Virgin Steele * W.A.S.P. * Wolf Spider (1990‚Äì1991) (Subsidiary label - Under One Flag) * Waysted * Wendy O.

From 17 July 1950 to 20 October 1950, Suisun and the squadron were assigned to the United States Seventh Fleet and monitored military activities of the People's Republic of China in case of a Chinese intervention in the Korean War. With that assignment over, Suisun spent ten days in Hong Kong for a leave and upkeep period, then sailed for the United States on 2 November 1950, via Okinawa and Pearl Harbor. She arrived at Whidbey Island on 27 November 1950 and moved to San Diego on 1 December 1950.

Each song is a prayer to one of the nine NavagrahƒÅs (\\"planets\\" of Hindu mythology). The songs titles, rƒÅga (musical scale) and tƒÅ·∏∑a (rhythmic pattern) are listed below: * S≈´ryam≈´rtƒì Nam≈çstutƒì (on Sun or Surya, in RƒÅga SaurƒÅ·π£h·π≠ram, TƒÅ·∏∑a Chatusra Dhr≈´va) * Chandram Bhaja MƒÅnasa (on Moon or Chandra, in RƒÅga AsƒÅvƒìri, TƒÅ·∏∑a Chatusra Ma·π≠ya) * AngƒÅrakam ƒÄshrayƒÅmyaham (on Mars or AngƒÅraka, in RƒÅga Sura·π≠i, TƒÅ·∏∑a R≈´paka) * Budham ƒÄshrayƒÅmi (on Mercury or Budha, in Raga NƒÅ·π≠akuranji, TƒÅ·∏∑a Misra Jhampa) * B·πõhaspatƒì TƒÅrƒÅpatƒì (on Jupiter or B·πõhaspati, in RƒÅga A·π≠hƒÅnƒÅ, TƒÅ·∏∑a Tisra Tripu·π≠a) * Shrƒ´ Shukra Bhagavantam (on Venus or Shukra, in RƒÅga Paraju, TƒÅ·∏∑a Khanda A·π≠a) * DivƒÅkaratanujam Shanaishcharam (on Saturn or Shani, in RƒÅga YadukulakƒÅmbh≈çji, TƒÅ·∏∑a Chatusra ƒíka) * SmarƒÅmyaham SadƒÅ RƒÅhum (on RƒÅhu, in RƒÅga RƒÅmapriya (RƒÅmaman≈çhari), TƒÅ·∏∑a R≈´paka) * MahƒÅsuram Kƒìtumaham (on Kƒìtu, in RƒÅga Shanmukhapriya (ChƒÅmaram), TƒÅ·∏∑a R≈´paka) The set comprises all seven soolƒÅdi tƒÅ·∏∑as. The last two (on RƒÅhu and Kƒìtu) were most likely composed by followers of Dƒ´kshitar, to complete the set of nine even though the signature used in the song is that of Dikshitar (guruguha). Legend: It is said that Tambiappan, a disciple of MuttuswƒÅmi Dƒ´kshitar was suffering from a stomach ailment and for long no medicines were able to cure him. Dƒ´kshitar inspecting his horoscope inferred that the planet Jupiter was in an unfavorable position and his ailment could be cured only by propitiating the planet god B·πõhaspati. As laymen would find these rituals complex he created the composition B·πõhaspatƒì in the RƒÅga A·π≠hƒÅnƒÅ propitiating the planet, and asked his disciple to sing it for a week. As ordained, his ailment was cured. This incident provided the impetus for Dƒ´kshitar to compose kritis on all the NavagrahƒÅs. ==References== *Dikshitar's Navagraha (Nine Planets) at medieval.org Category:Carnatic music Category:Navagraha ","title":"Navagraha Kritis"},{"id":"2201085","text":"Fierce Invalids Home From Hot Climates is Tom Robbins' seventh work; the novel was first published in 2000 by the Random House Publishing Group. ==Synopsis== Invalids follow the wheelchair bound protagonist, Switters, across four continents as he experiences love and danger. Robbins \\"explores, challenges, mocks, and celebrates virtually every major aspect of our mercurial era.\\"(Quote from the hardcover book jacket.) Robbins has stated in numerous interviews that in this book he was trying to deal with contradiction, but rather than avoiding his contradictory nature, his character embraces it. He's a CIA agent but despises the government. He's a pacifist but carries a gun. He's as much in love with his 17-year-old stepsister as he is with a 46-year- old nun. Switters feels that the core of the universe and the basis of human existence, is the paradox of light and dark co-existing together. One is not separate from the other; they just co-exist . This is the main idea of \\"Fierce Invalids Home from Hot Climates\\", along with an interest in the Lady of Fatima and a squawking parrot. The title of the novel comes from Arthur Rimbaud's A Season in Hell, in which he daydreams about becoming one of \\"ces f√©roces infirmes retour des pays chauds.\\" ==CharactersSwitters=== Switters grew up in the Seattle area and was raised primarily by his grandmother, Maestra. His parents separated when he was young. His mother remarried and has a step daughter named Suzy. When we first meet Switters he is 35 years old. He just came back from a mission and visited his grandmother Maestra in Seattle. He is obviously attached to her although she does not tolerate his mannerism. He does anything she asks of him, which is how he ends up in, as he puts it, \\"South too-damn-vivid America.\\" Switters refrains from the more tedious routines of modern life, which he calls collectively \\"maintenance\\" - showering, shaving, primping of any kind, and though he has quite an appetite, especially for red-eye gravy, he can't abide to think of the process of excretion. He does not visualize his internal organs, nor their processes. Instead he envisions his viscera as more of a white ball of healing light. While this may smack of New-Age mysticism, Switters himself is aware of his own self-deception while at the same time reveling in it. As presumably does any other member of a national intelligence office, Switters has a few secrets. His most private was his love of show tunes. In the crocodile-skin valise in which he keeps his laptop and his gun, he also has, in a secret compartment, a CD of Broadway tunes, which he listens to in both his darkest and most joyous moments. He is heard - or overheard - singing lines from one of Stephen Sondheim's most famous songs‚Äî\\"Send in the Clowns\\". His primary character trait is his obsession with innocence. He is willing to accept anything that anyone does, so long as it is pure - comes from that person's own experience and beliefs, as opposed to simply following orders, instructions, or creed. He cares little for the practice of religion, perceiving it as corrupt, but has studied the Bible, Qur'an, and various mythologies. The exception to this is Zen, which he practices vaguely for the most part, though he does practice zazen. Like many obsessions, his drive for innocence and purity spills over into his love life. Throughout the novel he carries on a very flirtatious - and occasionally salacious - email dialog with his 17-year-old stepsister Suzy. After his visit to South America, he spends some time convalescing in Sacramento at his mother's house, a setting that puts him in dangerously close proximity to the object of his affection, who despite a bit of hesitation, returns her paramour's attention. Later in the novel, Switters falls in love with a 46-year-old nun, who despite her age, Switters finds just as pure as young Suzy. ===Bobby Case=== Switters' best friend whom he worked with in the CIA in Thailand and also shares an attraction to underage women. ===Sailor Boy=== The parrot that Switter must release in \\"too god damn vivid South America\\". ===Maestra=== Switters' Grandmother. Although she would never let him call her that. ===Suzy=== Switters' seventeen-year-old stepsister who lives in Sacramento, California, US. She later lives with Maestra who resides in Seattle Washington, US. Switters falls in love with Suzy, due to his \\"attraction to innocence.\\" ===Sister \\"Domino\\" Thiry=== The nun in a Syrian Catholic convent with whom Switters falls in love. ===The Masked Beauty=== This is the abbess of the disavowed, Catholic, oasis-based convent in which Switters comes to stay in for over a year later in the book. ===The shaman=== \\"Today Is Tomorrow\\" is a shaman who casts a curse on Switters. Alternately, he is called \\"The End of Time\\" in the beginning of the book, due to a mistranslation of the native language. ==References== ==External links== *A review by Pat Belford *Review by Booklist *SFGate review Category:2000 American novels Category:Novels by Tom Robbins Category:Novels about ephebophilia ","title":"Fierce Invalids Home from Hot Climates"},{"id":"2201086","text":"FC Eindhoven is a Dutch football club based in Eindhoven, North Brabant. They currently play in the Eerste Divisie (second tier of Dutch football), and are one of two professional clubs which are based in the city of Eindhoven, the other one being PSV Eindhoven. FC Eindhoven play their home games at Jan Louwers Stadion, on the southern part of the city. The club's official colours are blue and white, hence their nickname Blauw-Witten (The Blue-Whites). ==History== The club was founded on 16 November 1909 as EVV Eindhoven. A couple of Gentleman had seen that the clubs in the North area called the Randstad were growing and felt there was a need for a new team in Eindhoven too. Decided was to found a new club under the name E.V.V. short for Eindhovense Voetbal Vereniging. Club colours were blue and white, the blue came from the crest of the city Eindhoven at that time. E.V.V. start to play in the Brabantse Voetbalbond, a regional league, but a couple of years after they start to play in the NVB, the National League. In 1921 E.V.V. fuses with Gestel (local team) and changes its name to E.V.V. Eindhoven. At the end of the 30s Eindhoven has his first bit of success as they got hold of the Dutch Cup, the KNVB Beker (1937). In 1939 E.V.V. Eindhoven is the new Champion of the 1st Division Region South and plays for the title of The Netherlands with teams like DWS, NEC, Ajax and Achilles 1894. They finish 4th. In 1950 E.V.V. Eindhoven has their first Dutch international in the name of Noud van Melis. Frans Tebak and Dick Snoek were to follow in his footsteps soon. In 1954, Eindhoven were the last Dutch league champions before the introduction of the professional league. After turning professional in 1954, the club played in the Eredivisie until 1957, when Eindhoven were relegated to the Eerste Divisie. In 1969 they were even relegated to the Tweede Divisie. Two years later, the club secured promotion back to the Eerste Divisie, and in 1975, Eindhoven were promoted to the Eredivisie. In 1977, Eindhoven were relegated back to the Eerste Divisie, where it has remained ever since. In 1997 E.V.V. Eindhoven left the professional scene and is once again an amateur club. A new professional club SBV Eindhoven (Stichting Betaald Voetbal Eindhoven) was founded, this name was in 2002 changed to FC Eindhoven. In the 2009‚Äì2010 season FC Eindhoven qualified for playoffs to advance to the Eredivisie. Eindhoven advanced past the first round defeating AGOVV Apeldoorn 4‚Äì2 goal aggregate. Eindhoven was pitted against possible relegation from Eredivisie club Willem II and were narrowly defeated 3‚Äì2 aggregate. So they will remain in the Eerste Divisie. In 2011/2012 FC Eindhoven had a fantastic season and finished 3rd, despite Ernest Faber leaving FC Eindhoven as manager to join Dick Advocaat at PSV to be his assistant in March 2012. The club lost 3‚Äì0 to Helmond Sport over two legs, 1‚Äì0 in the first and 2‚Äì0 in the second, in Round 2 of the promotion playoffs. Erwin Koeman, the replacement of Ernest Faber, left in the summer of 2012 and was replaced by John Lammers. Under Lammers the 12‚Äì13 season finished in a disappointing 16th spot, only above two sides whose points totals had been set at zero due to bankruptcy. The 13‚Äì14 season was a big improvement with the club finishing 6th and qualifying for the promotion play-offs. There they encountered Sparta Rotterdam to whom they lost to 3‚Äì1 on aggregate. ===Rivalries=== FC Eindhoven's biggest rivalry is with neighbours PSV Eindhoven, against whom they contest the Lichtstad Derby ('City of Light Derby'). However, the clubs have not faced each other in league competition since the 1976‚Äì77 season. FC Eindhoven used to be a bigger club than PSV in the period between 1930 and 1955. PSV was a club for the workers of Phillips and seen as a club for the privileged while FC Eindhoven was seen as the people's club. In 2004, FC Eindhoven contracted a co-operation deal with neighbours PSV Eindhoven, meaning the possibility of swapping youth players between the two clubs. Nowadays, Helmond Sport are seen as the biggest rivals. The clubs are about 15 km apart and have been playing in the same league for years. ==Honours== * Eredivisie **Winner: 1954 * KNVB Cup ** Winner: 1937 * Promoted to Eredivisie ** Promotion: 1975 * Promoted to Eerste Divisie ** Promotion: 1971 ==Results== ImageSize = width:800 height:60 PlotArea = left:10 right:10 bottom:30 top:10 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1990 till:01/01/2019 ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:1 start:1990 Colors = id:bl1 value:rgb(0.9,0.9,0.3) id:bl2 value:rgb(0.5,0.8,0.5) id:rs value:rgb(0.8,0.6,0.6) id:rn value:rgb(0.9,0.1,0.1) PlotData= bar:Position width:15 color:white align:center from:01/01/1990 till:01/01/1991 shift:(0,-4) text:4 from:01/01/1991 till:01/01/1992 shift:(0,-4) text:14 from:01/01/1992 till:01/01/1993 shift:(0,-4) text:15 from:01/01/1993 till:01/01/1994 shift:(0,-4) text:16 from:01/01/1994 till:01/01/1995 shift:(0,-4) text:17 from:01/01/1995 till:01/01/1996 shift:(0,-4) text:17 from:01/01/1996 till:01/01/1997 shift:(0,-4) text:9 from:01/01/1997 till:01/01/1998 shift:(0,-4) text:8 from:01/01/1998 till:01/01/1999 shift:(0,-4) text:9 from:01/01/1999 till:01/01/2000 shift:(0,-4) text:9 from:01/01/2000 till:01/01/2001 shift:(0,-4) text:9 from:01/01/2001 till:01/01/2002 shift:(0,-4) text:17 from:01/01/2002 till:01/01/2003 shift:(0,-4) text:10 from:01/01/2003 till:01/01/2004 shift:(0,-4) text:16 from:01/01/2004 till:01/01/2005 shift:(0,-4) text:15 from:01/01/2005 till:01/01/2006 shift:(0,-4) text:17 from:01/01/2006 till:01/01/2007 shift:(0,-4) text:19 from:01/01/2007 till:01/01/2008 shift:(0,-4) text:19 from:01/01/2008 till:01/01/2009 shift:(0,-4) text:18 from:01/01/2009 till:01/01/2010 shift:(0,-4) text:12 from:01/01/2010 till:01/01/2011 shift:(0,-4) text:12 from:01/01/2011 till:01/01/2012 shift:(0,-4) text:3 from:01/01/2012 till:01/01/2013 shift:(0,-4) text:16 from:01/01/2013 till:01/01/2014 shift:(0,-4) text:6 from:01/01/2014 till:01/01/2015 shift:(0,-4) text:2 from:01/01/2015 till:01/01/2016 shift:(0,-4) text:4 from:01/01/2016 till:01/01/2017 shift:(0,-4) text:11 from:01/01/2017 till:01/01/2018 shift:(0,-4) text:12 from:01/01/2018 till:01/01/2019 shift:(0,-4) text:14 from:01/01/1990 till:01/01/2019 color:bl1 shift:(0,13) text: \\"Eerste Divisie\\" Below is a table with FC Eindhoven's domestic results since the introduction of professional football in 1956. { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"width: 100%; text-align: center;\\" - !

Oh Henry! is a candy bar containing peanuts, caramel, and fudge coated in chocolate. ==History== There are two versions of the Oh Henry! bar origin story. The manufacturer Nestl√© says that the bar was introduced by George Williamson and his Williamson Candy Company of Chicago in 1920 in United States. The most popular alternate story is that Thomas Henry, manager of the Peerless Candy Co. in Arkansas City, Kansas, invented a bar he called the \\"Tom Henry Bar\\" in the late 1910s, and sold the recipe to George Williamson in 1920. There is no credible documentation of this story, however. There are also alternate accounts of the origin of the name of the bar. The story supported by Nestl√© is that there was a boy named Henry who frequented George Williamson's second candy shop. He became a favorite of the young girls who worked there, who would say \\"Oh Henry\\" when speaking to or about him, and Williamson used this phrase to name his new confection. The other (undocumented) story is that the name was changed from the Tom Henry Bar to Oh Henry! when it was purchased by Williamson. Popular myths are that it was named after O. Henry for Henry Aaron. The Williamson Company was sold to Warner-Lambert in 1965, which soon sold Oh Henry! to Terson, Inc. Nestl√© acquired the United States rights to the brand from Terson in 1984. In 2018, Nestl√© sold the rights to its US confectionery products to Ferrara Candy Company, a subsidiary of Ferrero SpA. As of mid-2020, there are no known sources to buy fresh FerraraUSA-made Oh Henry! candy bars in the US. Target, Walmart, Amazon, Costco, and a wide variety of candy wholesalers show the item as unavailable. Nestle stopped production of this candy bar under their brand name (Nestle) in 2018. FerraraUSA had one year (2019?) to sell the Nestle- labeled bars they acquired when they purchased the brand lines from Nestle. FerraraUSA claims Oh Henry! is still in production. Yet they can not identify any retailers or wholesalers in the US who are selling new production made by FerraraUSA, with new labeling that does not have the Nestle name. The FerraraUSA.com web site shows no chocolate candy brand. Only cookies and non- chocolate candy are shown. ==Differences between Ferrara and Hershey versions== In Canada, the bar is currently sold by The Hershey Company and was manufactured at their Smiths Falls, Ontario facilities prior to their closure. The bars are different in appearance: the Canadian version is one bar with the fudge in the center, the fudge surrounded with a thin layer of caramel, and the nuts surrounding that layer before it is surrounded in the coating. Hershey sells Oh Henry! bars made in Canada on a very limited basis in the United States as Rally bars, using the trademark of a Hershey product introduced in the 1970s and later discontinued. ==In popular culture== In the Seinfeld episode \\"The Caddy\\", the fictional character Sue Ellen Mischke is the heiress to the Oh Henry! candy bar fortune. Whenever former MLB outfielder Henry Rodr√≠guez hit a homerun, fans would throw Oh Henry! bars onto the field. Gilbert Gottfried appeared in a number of television commercials, including for Oh Henry! in 1987.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EV7tp4YB20https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUZu2cjJ7FA ==See also== * List of chocolate bar brands ==References== ==External links== * Oh Henry! from Nestl√© USA Category:Chocolate bars Category:The Hershey Company brands Category:Products introduced in 1920 Category:Peanut dishes ","title":"Oh Henry!"},{"id":"2201106","text":"Phunky Phantom is electronic and dance music producer Laurence Nelson- Boudville, who was born in Brooklyn, New York. ==Biography== His one U.S. chart entry came in 1997, when he hit #1 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart with the song \\"Get Up, Stand Up\\".

Silvershein, a friend of William Wrigley, Jr., distributed the bar by the Wrigley Gum Company.

The famous Shuisky family descends from his eldest son, Vasily Kirdyapa. A senior descendant of Vsevolod the Big Nest and also of Yaroslav II of Vladimir (Dmitry was great-grandson of Yaroslav II's third son Andrey), he inherited Suzdal in 1359 and Nizhny Novgorod in 1365. His policy towards Tatars was conciliatory for the most part, as his eastern lands were continuously exposed to their attacks. After some rivalry with Dmitri of Moscow, he was installed by the Khan of the Golden Horde as the Grand Duke of Vladimir in 1360. During his reign, he repeatedly quarreled with the Novgorod Republic over the raids of Novgorodian pirates who looted his own capital and Tatar markets along the Volga River. Three years later he was dethroned and had to make peace with Dmitri by marrying him to his daughter, Eudoxia. Joining his army with Dmitri's, he led an allied assault on Volga Bulgars and Mordovia. In 1377, the allied armies were defeated by the Tatars on the Pyana River, because (as the chronicler put it) they were too drunk to fight. However, in 1382 Dmitry Konstantinovich took the side of Khan Tokhtamysh in taking over Moscow and sent his sons to serve in the Tatar army. ==Family== He had issue: * Vasiliy Kirdyapa c. 1350-1403, prince of Suzdal.

As a practitioner of martial arts Lam starred in a number of notable films that found recognition outside Hong Kong including Encounters of the Spooky Kind, The Prodigal Son and his best known role in Mr. Vampire. ==BiographyChildhood years=== He was born Lam Gun-bo (ÊûóÊ†πÂØ∂) on 27 December 1952 in the year of the Dragon, in Hong Kong. His family originated from Shanghai, in the People's Republic Of China. Both of his parents made a living by doing catering services. Lam was the third child of six children. His family was poor, and his parents weren't educated. Lam attended Shun Yi Association Elementary School in Hong Kong, but eventually dropped out after 2 years. His father sent him to Chun Chau Drama Society to learn the Peking Opera style under the guidance of Madame Fan Fok Fa. Due to his slender and fragile body structure, Lam specialized in female roles and often performed stunt-doubling for actresses. However, he was reported as a mischievous and disobedient child. Thus, after half a year of training, Madame sent him on stage to express himself and control his drive. Lam's first show was called \\"White Beach\\", but his Beijing Opera career only lasted for 5 years. He realized that there was not much demand for opera styles anymore. Through a friend's introduction, Lam joined the film industry. ===Early life=== At age 17, Lam became a stuntman and martial arts coach at the Shaw Brothers Studio. Due to his slender build, he was often called upon to substitute female actors. He received $HK60 a day, $HK20 of which went to his master, and another $HK20 he took home to his parents. Lam used the remaining money to treat his brothers to snacks. Lam once mentioned those were his happiest days in his life. There was a story that Lam challenged Bruce Lee in a hotel room because he didn't believe Lee was as strong as the rumors said. Lam put a pillow over his chest and stomach, then Bruce struck the pillow and sent him flying across the room. Bruce Lee was so impressed that he hired Lam as his personal assistant. Lam was 19 at the time. Lam started to work as an co-action choreographer, and personal assistant to Bruce Lee on Lee's movies including The Big Boss, Fist of Fury, Enter the Dragon, Way of the Dragon, and Game of Death. In his youth, Lam seemed to have quite a temper and always got into fights. During the filming of \\"The Big Boss\\", Lam was arrested for fighting, and Lee had to bail him out of jail. Despite having little education, Lam impressed Lee with interesting philosophical discussions. Although they hardly talked about their relationship, Lee liked good conversations, and this self-willed young man soon became Lee's favorite. When Lee died, Lam was devastated. He later joined Hung's stuntman association (known as the Hung Kar Pan). ===1980s=== Lam worked behind the camera as assistant director and became Sammo's right-hand man of the stunt team. His talent as an actor and martial artist was revealed in The Magnificent Butcher. Lam played the fan-wielding assassin who fought against Yuen Biao. In 1982, Lam won the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Action Director, in the film Prodigal Son. Prodigal Son featured what is widely acknowledged as among the best Wing Chun caught on film, performed by Lam. Lam played the strict kung fu master Leung Yee-tai. This was probably his most historic role. Lam even shaved his own eyebrows to give Master Leung a more feminine portrayal. He was able to bring a cool, sweet quality to this sharp and hard-nosed character. He also played a frail, elderly Taoist priest in The Dead and the Deadly (1983). Lam's star did not rise until 1985, with the release of Mr. Vampire, the movie that fueled the hopping vampire genre. Lam was nominated for Best Actor for his role as the Taoist priest. The character was an engaging mixture of naivety and stoic authority, and became a favorite for audiences. Lam was to reprise this role many times throughout his career. Shortly after the release of Mr. Vampire, the Golden Harvest film company attempted to make an English version of the movie with Tanya Roberts (of Charlie's Angels) and Jack Scalia. Lam's role was played by longtime kung fu film actor Yuen Wah. Due to various difficulties, the film was never made. In the following years, Lam starred as the Taoist Priest in countless sequels and spin-offs of Mr. Vampire such as Mr. Vampire II (1986), Mr. Vampire III (1987), Vampire Vs. Vampire (1989), Magic Cop (1990), Encounters of the Spooky Kind II (1990) He also appeared in different movie genres such as The Return of Pom Pom (1984), School on Fire (1988), Painted Faces (1988), and Her Vengeance (1988). Lam proved that his dramatic acting skill was just as good as his kung fu skill. It is argued that whether the huge success of Mr. Vampire was the best thing that happened in his career because it forever typecast him as the vampire slayer. Yet Lam had many heartbreaking and mind-stirring portrayals in other movie genres. In 1989, Lam directed his first movie Vampire Vs. Vampire. The movie starred him as the usual One Eyebrow Priest, Chin Siu Ho and Liu Fong as his naughty disciples. Due to the production cost going over budget, he didn't take his director's fee. The movie showed light of his moving-making style which was prone to realistic fights and dark humor. The movie didn't become a huge success, but his candor made people re-think the purposes of film-making. It also suggested new ideas in the genre which later influenced other Hong Kong ghost movies. Vampire Vs. Vampire offered a new look about the encounter between Chinese and Western culture. The One Eyebrow Priest also raised a vampire kid in his own house. This went against traditional rules of Maoshan Taoism. Even until now, people often find Lam Ching Ying's shadow in later Chinese ghost movies. ===1990s=== The success of Mr. Vampire eventually became burdensome on Lam, who found himself typecast in the role. As the Hong Kong movie industry began to experience a decline, quality roles for Lam also began to dry. However, he continued to take on his usual role as the Taoist priest as well as supporting roles in low budget movies. In 1990, Lam became the film producer for Magic Cop (1990), an underrated action movie. He starred in and action directed the movie. The fight scenes between him and the Japanese again showed his excellence as an action choreographer. Some of his other ghost movies during these years are Crazy Safari (1991), An Eternal Combat (1991), The Ultimate Vampire (1991) Spiritual Trinity (1991), Mad Mad Ghost (1992), Banana Spirit (1992). Again, his serious acting side can be seen in Pom Pom and Hot Hot (1992), Lover's Tear (1992). He had supporting roles in these movies, but his roles are very memorable. In 1995, although the film market was in depression, ATV offered Lam the starring role in a television series called Vampire Expert (ÊÆ≠Â±çÈÅìÈï∑). He was hired with a million HK dollars salary to work in the series. It was a far cry from his time as $HK60 a day stuntman. The series was a success and revived Lam's career. The story followed Mo Siu Fong (Lam Ching Ying) who destroyed ghosts and saved the day. During the filming, Lam developed a relationship with his co-star Kingdom Yuen. In the series, Yuen played a female priest who fell in love with Mo Siu Fong (Lam Ching Ying). At the end of the filming, they were actually in love. The second series was filmed and aired in 1996. The series starred Lam Ching Ying again as the humble priest, Mang Hoi, Frankie Lam and Annie Man as his disciples. Like the first series, the second series received high ratings and support from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Soon after that, Lam signed for another TV series called Coincidentally (ÊÉÖÂÆöÈò¥Èò≥Áïå). The series borrowed the cast of Vampire Expert and had Lam in a supporting role. Lam played a priest who tried to prevent a man from becoming a cruel spirit. However, this series didn't mark the end of his career. Lam's last role was in A Monk at Thirty (‰∏ÄÊûùËä±ÂíåÂ∞ö). The role was so heartbreaking that many of his fans doubted he was actually playing his own death. In 1996, production on the third series of Vampire Expert began. The production was halted due to Lam's health condition. Contrary to rumors that the cancer was caused by years of heavy drinking, the cancer was hereditary. ==Family== Lam Ching-ying married Cheng Bing Bing in 1983. They had two children, a daughter Lam Sik-nga (ÊûóÂºèÁì¶) in 1985 and a son Lam Ka-yiu (ÊûóÂÆ∂ËÄÄ) in 1988. The children loved to watch their father's movies. The couple divorced in 1988. Child custody was given to the father. Lam sent his children to the U.S to study. During the filming of Vampire Expert in 1995, Lam and his co-star Kingdom Yuen developed a relationship. However in 1996, Lam broke up with Yuen when they were in love. He then packed up and moved to his sister's house. Yuen talked about Lam after his death: :\\"In fact, he was sick. I always knew it. But he didn't want to be disturbed, so he moved to a place where no-one could see him. He also didn't allow me to visit him. Before leaving, he said: \\"I cannot stay by your side anymore. Take good care of yourself. If you have problems, ask your brother to help you.\\" I was reluctant to let him leave, but I respected his choice. He was the kind of man that when he decided something, it would be impossible to stop him... As an actor, he wanted people to see the most beautiful, brilliant moments. He didn't allow me to visit him. Because he knew that if I had seen him like this, it would have been very painful\\". ==DeathRumor about cancer=== During the summer of 1997 Lam had been repeatedly going to the hospital for tests. Rumours were spreading that he had liver cancer. He stubbornly insisted on leaving the hospital immediately and finishing his job, unwilling to be hospitalised. He received worried phone calls from friends, but he told them not to listen to gossip. It is unknown when Lam was diagnosed with cancer for the first time since he forbid his close family to reveal his illness. Some of his close friends stated that they noticed his illness, but no-one dared to ask him directly. Chin Kar Lok said in an interview: :\\"One time I had to break through a 10 ft glass wall and before that, I had to work on a ship to jump from the 2nd floor to the 1st floor. Everyone knew it was a painful shot. Hung Kam Bo wanted me to do that job. But Lam refused to let me do that and he took that action‚Ä¶it was really a big pain shot. He was hurt after he did that shot. Like what I said before, working as a stuntman in the 80s is like a family and there is no selfishness. :He was very kind to me, even in a later movie, he found me for the main actor. He really took care of me. He had the spirit. He was not a smooth talker. But he used his brain a lot. He taught us not to be lazy, to give 100% every time, no tricks. He set a very good example to us. He had a good heart for movies, even when he was sick at the end of his life. He didn't show to us he was in pain. He was even shooting a movie with us. I think he is really the real hero. I miss him very much.\\" ===Final weeks=== Lam broke up with his girlfriend Kingdom Yuen. Two weeks before his death, Lam moved to his sister's house. He refused visits from his children and friends. Lam started to lose his consciousness over and over again at the beginning of November. His family moved him to the St. Teresa Hospital in Kowloon. He was already in a semi-comatose state, and his situation gradually declined. Lam died on November 8th 1997 at 12:30 am at St. Theresa's Hospital in Hong Kong, the cause of death being cancer of the liver. He was 44 years old. ==The funeral== Lam's request was to have a low-profile funeral. His funeral was attended by his parents, close family and school-mate friends. The Buddhist ceremony was held in the evening of the 13th at around 7 am. His Priest robe, shoes and top-hat were buried with him, along with his favorite clothes and sunglasses. Lam's pallbearers were Yuen Shiu Hung, Chin Yuet Sun, Ng Ming Hoi, Lam King Chu, Chan Wui Ngai, Chung Fat, Sammo Hung, Chan Wing Hong, Chin Kar Lok and Wu Ma. After the funeral his remains were cremated and buried in the U.S. with a calligraphy: ::\\"One Smile Returns To The West\\" ==Tribute== The first series of My Date with a Vampire produced by ATV was dedicated to him, and the entire series was loosely based in the future of Vampire Expert. The 2013 Hong Kong horror movie Rigor Mortis (film) is a tribute to Mr. Vampire, and one of the stars is Lam Ching-Ying's fellow co-star in that film, Chin Siu-ho. ==Selected filmography== * The Big Boss (1971) (Actor / Assistant action director) * Fist of Fury (1972) (Stuntman) * Enter the Dragon (1973) (Stuntman / Assistant action director) * Broken Oath (1977) (Actor) * Legend of the Bat (1978) * Clan of Amazons (1978) * Encounters of the Spooky Kind (1980) (Action Director / Actor) * The Prodigal Son (1982) (Action Director / Actor) * The Dead and the Deadly (1983) (Actor / Stuntman / Action director) * Winners And Sinners (1983) (Actor / Action director) * Pom Pom (1984) (Actor) * Hocus Pocus (1984) (Actor) * Those Merry Souls (1985) (Actor / Action Director) * My Lucky Stars (1985) (Actor / Action Director) * Mr. Vampire (1985) (Actor / Action Director) * Millionaire's Express (1986) (Actor / Action Director) * Heroes Shed No Tears (1986) (Actor) * Mr. Vampire II (1986) (Actor) * Eastern Condors (1987) (Actor / Action Director) * Mr. Vampire III (1987) (Actor / Action Director) * I Love Maria (1988) (Actor) * Painted Faces (1988) (Actor) * Paper Marriage (1988) (Action director) * Pedicab Driver (1989) (Brief appearance) * Vampire Vs.

The houses are built by the Hong Kong Government beginning in 1964 to replace wooden huts and squatter areas that began to emerge in the late 1940s and 1950s. The name was created in the 1980s to replace the original reference of Licensed area. The building design was likely influenced from military barracks. Each house is divided into tens of tiny flats, with one flat per household. Most of the THAs were demolished by the 1990s and the last demolished was in 2001. The THA is being replaced by Interim Housing, a more resilient temporary home concept since the 1970s. ==Life== Living in a THA affords little privacy. Interior walls are only visual barriers.

The following year he served in the brig Taptee under Commander Montriou where he surveyed the Concan coast off the coast of Mumbai, India. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1847 and served the next two years on the Feroze in the Red Sea. In 1850 he was appointed to command the survey ship Pownah where for six years he surveyed the Gulf of Cutch on the Malabar Coast. In 1855 he examined the port of Karwar, and then spent four years surveying Coringa Bay and Kakinada port on the Coromandel Coast and Cochin on the Malabar coast, surveying as far south as Calicut. In 1859 he piloted the expeditionary force against Wagher rebels involved in the Indian Rebellion of 1857-1859 at Bet Dwarka. In 1862, the Indian Navy was abolished and Taylor was pensioned, but at the request of Admiral Washington, Taylor was employed in compiling Sailing Directions for the West Coast of Hindostan, published in 1865. During this work, Taylor became interested in further improving the hydrography of Indian waters. He was then able to convince the Secretary of State of the Government of India to form the Marine Survey Department in 1875, with Taylor as its head. The department was very productive during this period, producing many publications to aid in navigation, especially marine charts. Taylor retired on 1 July 1882 under the 55-year rule, succeeded by Commander L. S. Dawson.Black 1891, p15-17 Alfred was married to Bessie Mills and had a child named Alfred Mills Taylor.

AD 222) was an Anatolian Roman noblewoman. She was briefly married to the Roman emperor Elagabalus in 221 and thus a Roman empress. She was Elagabalus' third wife. ==Ancestry and family== Annia Aurelia Faustina is an ancient Roman noblewoman who has been scarcely noticed by ancient and modern Roman historians.Smyth, Descriptive catalogue of a cabinet of Roman imperial large-brass medals: Annia Aurelia Faustina article She was of noble descent, daughter and only child of the wealthy heiress Annia Faustina and the Roman Senator, consul Tiberius Claudius Severus Proculus. Her parents were maternal second-cousins. Her paternal grandparents were the Pontian Greek Roman Senator and Peripatetic Philosopher, Gnaeus Claudius Severus and his second wife, the Roman Princess Annia Galeria Aurelia Faustina. Her maternal grandparents were wealthy Roman heiress Ummidia Cornificia Faustina and an unnamed Roman Senator. Her paternal half-uncle was Marcus Claudius Ummidius Quadratus, who had been adopted by the Roman Consul Marcus Ummidius Quadratus Annianus, the nephew of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius. She was a Roman citizen of Pontic Greek and Italian ancestry. Her paternal great-grandparents were the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius; Roman Empress Faustina the Younger; the Roman Senator, Philosopher Gnaeus Claudius Severus Arabianus and his unnamed wife. Her maternal great-grandparents were Marcus Aurelius‚Äô sister, the noblewoman Annia Cornificia Faustina and Gaius Ummidius Quadratus Annianus Verus a Roman Senator who served as a suffect consul in 146. Thus she was a descendant of the former ruling Nerva‚ÄìAntonine dynasty of the Roman Empire. Although by birth, Annia Aurelia Faustina was of the gens Claudia, she was not named after her father; instead she was named in honor of her parent‚Äôs relations to the gens Aurelia, the gens Annia and the Nerva‚ÄìAntonine dynasty. ==Early life== Annia Aurelia Faustina was born and raised on her mother's estate in Pisidia, one of a number in that area called the \\"Cyllanian Estates\\". These estates were very large properties, established from the time of the dictator of the Roman Republic, Lucius Cornelius Sulla (c. 138-78 BC). About 216, her father may have made a political alliance with a Roman Senator who was a member of the gens Pomponia that resulted in her marrying Pomponius Bassus. Upon her marriage, they settled at her Pisidian estates. Pomponius treated Annia well and they both lived in domestic tranquility. She bore at least two known children during her marriage: a daughter, Pomponia Ummidia (born 219), and a son, Pomponius Bassus (born 220). By 218, her parents had died and Annia inherited her mother's estate and their fortune, becoming a very wealthy heiress. On the site of the estate inscriptions have survived proclaiming her inheritance of the property from her parents and that she was its owner. ==Second marriage to Elagabalus== In the year 221, Roman Emperor Elagabalus was induced to end his highly controversial and politically damaging marriage to the Vestal Virgin Aquilia Severa by powerful courtiers, led by his grandmother Julia Maesa. In its place he was advised to marry Annia Aurelia Faustina as an alliance with the powerful clan represented by her blood connections with the prior Nerva‚ÄìAntonine dynasty. Annia Aurelia Faustina was recently widowed as her late husband, Pomponius Bassus, had been executed for subversion and treason. The senatorial Roman ruling class was more receptive of this imperial marriage than the previous one. Annia became Empress of Rome and it seemed for a time that the Nerva‚ÄìAntonine dynasty rule had returned to Rome. Elagabalus gave her the title of Augusta. Supporters of Elagabalus had hoped that Annia, the mother of two small children would bear him a natural heir however, she bore him no children. In the end of 221, Elagabalus, reasserting his previous course of action, divorced her and returned to Julia Aquilia Severa, remarrying her as his fourth wife. Due to her second brief marriage, there are no surviving sources describing Annia Aurelia Faustina's rule as a Roman empress. ==Life after Elagabalus== When her marriage to Elagabalus ended, Annia Aurelia Faustina returned with her children to the Pisidian estate. She spent the final years of her life there. When she died, her daughter Pomponia Ummidia inherited the estate, and her descendants had become various distinguished nobles and politicians in Roman Society. ==References== ==Sources== * Descriptive Catalogue of a Cabinet of Roman Imperial Large-brass Medals; by William Henry Smyth, 1834 * Septimius Severus: the African emperor; by Anthony Richard Birley; 2nd ed.

He reigned in 7th century AD, some historians place his rule between circa 600 C.E and 636/7 C.E. Whereas other sources place his reign between 590 and 625 C.E. He is the contemporary of Harsha and of Bhaskaravarman of Kamarupa. His capital was at Karnasubarna, in present-day Murshidabad in West Bengal. The development of the Bengali calendar is often attributed to Shashanka because the starting date falls within his reign. == Contemporary sources == There are several major contemporary sources of information on his life, including copperplates from his vassal Madhavavarma (king of Ganjam), copperplates of his rivals Harsha and Bhaskaravarman, the accounts of Banabhatta, who was a bard in the court of Harsha, and of the Chinese monk Xuanzang, and also coins minted in Shashanka's reign. == Early life == Not much is known about the early life of Shashanka. Historian D K Ganguly is reported to have concluded that he was a native of Magadha. The same source reports that the historian Padmanath Bhattacharya took Shashanka to be a son of Mahasenagupta. R D Banerji concluded that he was descended from the Magadha Guptas. These views are opposed by other historians like B. S. Sinha and John Middleton, citing lack of evidence. Nagendranath Basu has argued that Shashanka was the son / descendant of Raja Karnadeva, who founded the city of Karnasubarna. In some sources, Shashanka is described as a tribal leader. === Names and titles === Shashanka's name appears in multiple forms, including ≈öa≈õƒÅnka and ≈öa≈õƒÅnka- deva. The name is derived from Sanskrit, as another name for the Moon. ≈öa≈õƒÅnka-deva therefore loosely translates to Moon god. The Hindu god Shiva is also known as Shashank Sekhar as He holds the moon on his head. The Chinese monk Xuanzang's writings, he is mentioned as She-Shang-Kia. He is also called ≈öa≈õƒÅnka Narendragupta, which initially lent credence to the claim that he was descended from the later Guptas. In Sinha's Dynastic History of Magadha, the names '≈öa≈õƒÅnka' and 'Soma' are used interchangeably. == Rise to power == The Gupta Empire saw a series of weak kings after the death of Skandagupta in 467 C.E. On top of that, starting circa 480 C.E. Alchon Hun armies began attacking the declining empire from multiple sides. Defence of the vast empire put a strain on the royal treasury. Though the Huns were initially driven out, the protracted invasions quickened the downfall of the Gupta kings. It may be noted that Indian archeologist Shanker Sharma has argued that the empire's end was precipitated by a massive deluge around the middle of the sixth century C.E. Near the end of the sixth century, the empire was ruled over by a feeble ruler belonging to the Later Gupta dynasty, Mahasenagupta (r. c. 562-601 C.E.). The decline of the Gupta empire had left the disintegrating empire in chaos. Numerous local kings and rulers like Yashodharman emerged, and started vying for control of the many pieces of the former empire. Shashanka emerged as one of these ambitious local rulers, aiming to seize control of Gauda and its surrounding region. The Rohtasgarh Fort, built circa 7th century The first mention of Shashanka is found in the 7th century hill fort Rohtasgarh in the small town of Rohtas in the kingdom of Magadha. The seal bore a curt inscription, \\"Mahasamanta Shashankadeva.\\" Some historians believe that Shashanka began his career as a feudatory chief (maha samanta) under Mahasenagupta, of the Later Gupta Dynasty. And that after the death of Mahasenagupta, Shashanka drove the later Guptas and other prominent nobles out of the region and established his own kingdom with his capital at Karnasubarna. Other historians like Sailendra Nath Sen is of the opinion that Mahasenagupta - already under pressure from the Maukharis (for failing to provide adequate protection) - wouldn't have knowingly appointed Shashanka to such an important position. Middleton (2015) argues in a similar vein that Shashanka served as maha samanta to a Gauda king, possibly Jayanaga. Whether Shashanka was a feudatory under the Maukharis or the Guptas is not known. By 605 C.E. following Mahasenagupta's death, Shashanka had established what became known as the Gauda Kingdom. From there, he issued gold coins to celebrate his triumph, and came to be addressed as Maharajadhiraja (king of great kings). == Military campaigns and warfare == Not many historical references to the Gauda Army are available. Like its predecessor, the Late Gupta army, Shashanka's army had infantry and cavalry units. D. C. Sircar (1990) reports that the Gauda army also fielded a strong elephant corps in Kamarupa. Kamarupa king Bhaskaravarman describes the Gauda army as fielding a strong naval force. === Campaign against the Varmans of Kamarupa (Assam) === It appears that between 595-600 C.E. the Gauda army had carried out attacks against the Varman King of Kamrupa (Assam). The Varman king died early in the war, and his two sons stepped up. The Doobi Copper Plate inscriptions tell us that the Gauda army fought and defeated the king, and princes Supratisthita and Bhaskara of Kamrupa. The princes are described as fighting a mighty elephantry force. The princes were brought back to Gauda as prisoners, but released shortly thereafter. They supposedly returned to their kingdom as feudatories under Shashanka. The younger of the two would soon turn against the Gauda. === Campaign against the Maukharis of Kanyakubja (Kanauj) === Hans Bakker argues that the army that set out to attack the Maukharis in Kanyakubja was more of a \\"confederation of all those who held a grudge\\", and that it was led by Shashanka. Now because the ruling dynasties of Kanyakubja and Sthaniswara were related by matrimony, Thanesar king Rajyavardhana immediately set out with 10,000 cavalrymen to recapture Kanyakubja and avenge his sister Rajyashri. Rajyavardhana fought and killed Devagupta on the way. As he continued towards Kanyakubja, he came across Shashanka's army. Circa 606 C.E. Rajyavardhana was killed by Shashanka. No conclusive evidence exists but it is possible that Shashanka, who joined the battle as an ally of Devagupta, murdered him. The only source available in this matter is the Harshacharita by BƒÅ·πáabha·π≠·π≠a, who was a childhood friend and constant companion of Harsha; neither of these men were present at the death. === War with Harsha of Sthanisvara (Thanesar) === Harsha succeeded his brother as ruler of Thanesar in 606 C.E. and he once again gathered the army and attacked Kannauj. Shashanka and his allies fought a major war with the then emperor of Thanesar, Harsha, and his allies. It is evident that Shashanka had to retreat from Kannauj. The result of the battle was inconclusive as Shashanka is documented to have retained dominion over his lands. Shashanka continued to rule Gauda with frequent attacks from Harsha, which he is known to have faced bravely. == Extent of kingdom == Shashanka first established himself in Gauda, and set his eyes on Magadha. Magadha at that time was under Maukhari rule, and Shashanka vowed to free it again. Sen (1977) has shown that none other than Shashanka could have defeated the Maukhari rulers of Magadha. Next, he focused on extending his kingdom to Odissa, parts of Central Provinces, and Bihar. Though Shashanka remains known, and referred to, as the Lord of Gauda, his kingdom included more than just that region. By the end of his reign, his domain stretched from Vanga to Bhuvanesha while in the east, his kingdom bordered Kamarupa. === Peak of Gauda Kingdom's expansion === At its peak, Shashanka's kingdom and conquests included the following small kingdoms, provinces, principalities and feudatory estates (in alphabetical order): * Chandradwipa (southern Bangladesh) * Dandabhukti (southern West Bengal) * Gauda (parts of West Bengal and Bangladesh) * Harikela (north-eastern Bangladesh) * Kamrupa (Assam) * Karna Subarna (part of West Bengal) * Lukhnauti (North Bengal and Bihar) * Navyabakashika (central and southern Bangladesh) * Pundra Vardhana (parts of northern West Bengal and northern Bangladesh) * Rarh (southern areas of West Bengal) * Samatata (eastern Bangladesh) * Subarnabithi (central Bangladesh) * Suhmha Desa (south-western West Bengal) * Vanga (central Bangladesh) * Vangala (southern Bangladesh) * Varendra (parts of northern West Bengal and northern Bangladesh) Whether all of the above came into the folds of the kingdom during Shashanka's lifetime, is not known. Also, while Shashanka is known to have occupied both Kamrupa and Kanyakubja, he could/did not hold on to either for long. Some historians maintain that Shashanka annexed Jharkhand as well. == Rule and administration == Coin of ≈öa≈õƒÅnka-deva, king of Gauda, circa 600‚Äì630. Shiva seated facing on bull seated left / Lakshmi seated facing on lotus; being watered by small elephants at either side.CNG Coins Shashanka, at first glance, appears like a \\"warlike monarch.\\" His endless invasions and conquests tell of a king intent upon growing his kingdom. Sen describes Shashanka as a 'military adventurer', not unlike Yasodharman. But for a pre-medieval Indian king, endless battles, regicide, revenge and intrigue are not uncommon. Like many pre-medieval Indian kings, Shashanka is said to have grasped the importance of consolidating his position. He formed astute political alliances, notably with the Malva king, Devagupta, to counteract the combined might of the Kanauj-Thaneshwar coalition. As king, Shashanka continued many Gupta-era traditions, e.g. making land grants to Brahmins, as evidenced by the copperplate inscriptions from the era. Gold and silver coins, known as Dinars, issued by Shashanka have also been discovered. He vigorously propagated Hinduism, and had Sakadvipi Brahmins and Vedic Brahmins invited into his kingdom, presumably from Kanyakubja, among other places. === Patronage of Shaivism === King Shashanka is said to have built temples to Shiva in his kingdom. The famous Lingaraja Temple of Odisha is said to be commissioned by the same king, and became the first Shiva temple in the kingdom. === Art and culture === Historians argue that the unique Gauda style of composition developed with the development of poetry in the courts of the princes of Bengal. These princes of Bengal are none other than the Lords of Gauda. === Copperplate inscriptions === Three copperplate inscriptions issued by King Shashanka have been discovered. Two of these were issued in his 8th and 10th regnal years, and discovered from Midnapore. The other, known as the Egra Copperplate, was discovered near Kharagpur and bears no date. == Suppression of Buddhism == A 12th century text states that Shashanka destroyed the Buddhist stupas of Bengal and was an oppressor of Buddhism. Shashanka is reputed to have cut the Bodhi tree where the Buddha found enlightenment, in the Mahabodhi Temple of Bodh Gaya.https://archive.org/details/wonderthatwasind00alba/page/266/mode/2up Ramesh Chandra Majumdar states that this account is doubtful because it was written centuries after the alleged persecution, and that it is \\"unsafe to accept the statements recorded in this book as historical\\". Radhagovinda Basak states that there is no reason to believe that this 12th century Buddhist author had cherished any ill feeling about Shashanka, and he may have had reasons to describe the events as they occurred in the 7th century. Following his death, Shashanka was succeeded by his son, Manava, who ruled the kingdom for eight months. However Gauda was soon divided amongst Harsha and Bhaskaravarman of Kamarupa, the latter even managing to conquer Karnasuvarna. == Legacy == Sasanka was the first fully sovereign ruler of Bengal, and he occupies a prominent place in its history and collective memory. Shashanka's legacy is closely related to that of the kingdom that he founded, and the kingdom that rose and fell with him. But its legacy continued, leading later kings and sultans to accept Gauda's political demarcation. Later rulers built their edifices and monuments on older sites, and Pala kings even retained Shashanka's unique title of Gaureshwara (the lord of Gauda) for themselves. Commenting on the symbolism of Gauda, Akshay Kumar Maitreya remarked, ‚ÄúThe whole of Gaur was once known as Gaura Desh. The Bengali language only a few days ago was known as Gauriya Basha‚Ä¶ Even now in many parts of India Bengalis are known as Gauriya. So if one attempts to write our history, one must begin with Gaur.‚Äù King Shashanka's unification, and subsequent defence, of local, disparate kingdoms including Vanga, Samatata and Gauda, against the mighty king Harsha, is considered seminal in the formation of the idea, and the polity, of Bengal. Many historians and commentators argue that Shashanka was the first independent king of not only Gauda, but of Bengal. As such he is a symbolic figure in the region's aspirations for independence and self-rule. Shashanka's feat in bringing the many tribes and kingdoms under a single flag becomes clear only after his death. Chaos broke out in Bengal with the demise of the Gauda Kingdom. In Pala inscriptions, this time is called Matsyanyayam, implying times of 'jungle rule' when big fish swallow up small fish. It is thought that the development of the Bengali calendar took place under Shashanka's reign. == In folk and popular culture  Sarasanka Dighi (folk legend) === Situated in present-day Midnapore, Sarasanka is a massive dighi (manmade lake) measuring over 140 acres. That is nearly equal to the total area of 80 football fields. Its aesthetics show clear influences of the Hindu Vastu Shastra school of architecture, design and aesthetics. According to Bengali folk lore and legends, the dighi was excavated at the behest of King Shashanka. In one oral tradition: once Shashanka had been accompanying his mother to holy pilgrimage and his convoy camped at the small village of Jamuapati in Datan. There, his mother was impressed by local hospitality; she asked them why their yields were so meagre. The villagers replied that they suffered from an acute shortage of water. So Shashank's mother urged her son to do something for the villagers, so that they still had water during the lean season. Not one to disobey his mother's wishes, Shashanka reportedly pulled out an arrow from his sheath, and announced that he would excavate a reservoir as long as the arrow's trajectory. And thus, over a period of three years, and with help from local nobles, Sarasanka came into existence. === Shashanka (popular culture) === Published in 1914, Shashanka is a historical novel penned by the famous Indian archaeologist Rakhaldas Bandyopadhyay, who is best known for his discoveries in Mohenjo Daro. He found Shashanka to be a potent symbol of Bengal's glorious past and future political aspirations. == See also == * List of rulers of Bengal == References == == Further reading == * R. C.

It is the fifth game in the Mega Man Battle Network series, and the first Mega Man game to be released on the Nintendo DS. Battle Network 5 comes in three different versions: Team ProtoMan and Team Colonel, both for the Game Boy Advance, which have similar gameplay but slightly different supporting characters and stories, and Mega Man Battle Network 5: Double Team DS for the Nintendo DS, which includes the content from both games as well as extra content. == Gameplay == MegaMan.EXE battles viruses in Double Team DS. Gameplay in Mega Man Battle Network 5 in this game is largely similar to that of its predecessors. The player explores the real world through Lan and the Net through MegaMan.EXE. When Lan plugs his PET, a handheld computer, into a computer with an interface jack, he can upload MegaMan.EXE to the cyber network, allowing him to explore and fight viruses as random encounters. When MegaMan.EXE encounters viruses, the screen shifts to a battle screen set on a six by three square grid. On the left half of the grid is MegaMan.EXE, and on the other half are his opponents. MegaMan.EXE has a relatively weak arm cannon, the Mega Buster, but his main weapon is Lan's library of battle chips, one-use-per-battle special attacks which grant various abilities, including simple attacks, attack enhancements, defensive effects, terrain transmogrification, or assistance from other NetNavis. Before battle, the player can construct a folder consisted of thirty battle chips, and each turn of a battle (measured by a timer bar at the top of the screen), the player is presented with a random selection of these chips. The player can send MegaMan.EXE m up to five battle chips, after which the battle takes place in real time, with MegaMan.EXE, controlled by the player, attacking with his Mega Buster, dodging attacks, or activating battle chips from his queue. MegaMan.EXE joins a team led by either Lan's and MegaMan.EXE's rivals Chaud and ProtoMan.EXE or new characters Baryl and Colonel.EXE, and the members of this team assist MegaMan in various ways. MegaMan.EXE can take on the attributes of one of his teammates with a Soul Unison. The team plays its largest role in Liberation missions, wherein MegaMan.EXE and the rest of his team enter a part of the Nebula-controlled Internet to free the area via a time-limited battle with a group of viruses. Also new to Mega Man Battle Network 5 are \\"Dark Chips\\", which are more powerful Battle Chips. While they appeared randomly in Mega Man Battle Network 4 when MegaMan.EXE was badly damaged, they act more like normal battle chips in this game in that they can be added to the battle chip folder like any other chip. Using Dark Chips has a downside: MegaMan.EXE will no longer be able to achieve Soul Unison, and every time MegaMan.EXE uses a Dark Chip, he permanently loses one point from his maximum hit points (HP). He can, however, use a Dark Chip for a Soul Unison; this is called a Chaos Unison, which resembles a normal Soul Unison with the main difference being that the Mega Buster is replaced with the effects of the Dark Chip he used for the Chaos Unison. While using this effect doesn't cause HP loss, it has to be done with careful timing, as charging with poor timing will end the Chaos Unison and cause an invincible, evil version of MegaMan.EXE to join the viruses and attack him for a short period of time using random battle chips. Much like previous games in the series, Game Boy Advance copies of Mega Man Battle Network 5 can connect using the Game Boy Advance link cable to battle head-to-head or to trade battle chips. == Story == Lan Hikari and his friends, Dex, Mayl and Yai, are called to the SciLab headquarters for the announcement of the latest research project that Lan's father, Yuichiro, has been working on. Before he can reveal it to them, mysterious agents take over SciLab, subduing everyone with sleeping gas, kidnapping Yuichiro, and stealing their PETs (a device that contains the program avatars called NetNavis). However, Lan was in a different section of the lab and avoids being discovered or having his PET stolen. The agents turn out to be working for Dr. Regal and his crime syndicate Nebula, which has returned after being defeated in Mega Man Battle Network 4. Nebula subsequently takes over the Net with an army of viruses and Darkloids: NetNavis that use dark powers and Dark Chips. While investigating a disturbance at SciLab, Lan meets either Chaud (in Team ProtoMan) or Baryl (in Team Colonel), who recruit him to begin forming an elite team of NetNavis to fight against Nebula's control. In a series of scenarios identical between games, Lan meets up with other powerful NetNavi operators and recruits them; Team ProtoMan grows to consist of Magnet Man, Gyro Man, Napalm Man, Search Man, and Meddy, while Team Colonel consists of Knight Man, Shadow Man, Tomahawk Man, Number Man, and Toad Man. Through the team's efforts, the Net is liberated area by area and peace gets restored. However, the occupation of the Net was a diversion by Nebula while they searched for \\"The Hikari Report\\", a research project by Lan's grandfather Dr. Hikari. Starting with a clue from an encrypted message on Yuichiro's lab computer, Lan and MegaMan.EXE discover digital snapshots of the real world in the past called VisionBursts which are hidden in the net. By piecing together clues left by Dr. Hikari in these areas, they discover he hid the Hikari Report in one of the VisionBursts, but Regal finds it first and claims it. The Hikari Report is explained to be a research project undertaken by Hikari and Dr. Wily to create SoulNet, an internet network connecting the minds and souls of humans and NetNavis across the world. The two believed SoulNet could bring peace and unity, but were unable to finish their research. Regal intends to unleash Nebula Grey, a program of pure hatred and darkness, upon the completed SoulNet, corrupting all humans and NetNavis in the world. Lan also discovers that Regal is Dr. Wily's son, and the two scientists intended for their children to complete their project. Lan's team storms Nebula's base and battles through it until Lan confronts Regal in the SoulNet server room. MegaMan.EXE seals Nebula Grey and the room begins to self-destruct. While the heroes evacuate, Yuichiro stays behind to speak to Regal about the research of their fathers. He collapses as Regal rejects the idea that he could reform, and a voice calls out to him and orders SoulServer to overload. In Team ProtoMan the speaker is unseen, while in Team Colonel Dr. Wily enters the room and gives the command. Lan narrates that an unknown figure saved his father from the destruction of Nebula's base, and Yuichiro calls the group to SciLab to meet Dr. Regal, who has had many of his memories erased by SoulServer and is now a peaceful scientist. Lan's friends and NetNavis visit the VisionBurst of the ACDC Town of the past as Yuichiro speaks to Lan and MegaMan.EXE about the hope for another world passed down through the generations that they will one day carry with them. === Characters === The membership of the liberation squad differs between the two versions of Mega Man Battle Network 5. Recruiting each member involves largely similar challenges and each character fills a certain role on the team, but the motivations and in-game abilities of each character are sometimes quite different. In both games, the liberation team is led by an experienced official Netbattler, with a NetNavi with a sword for an arm. In Team ProtoMan, the team is led by Electopian official Netbattler Chaud, Lan's recurring rival and operator of the swordsman NetNavi ProtoMan.EXE. His equivalent in Team Colonel is the new character Baryl, a Netopian official visiting Lan's home country of Electopia. Baryl is the operator of Colonel.EXE, a NetNavi who can adapt any chip to connect to his arm and adapt any object to fight as a soldier for him. Lan explores an abandoned mine in Team ProtoMan. The first addition to the team is a NetNavi returning from Mega Man Battle Network 2, one who can protect the rest of the team from attacks. This second operator is drilling in an abandoned mine on Oran Island, and unknowingly endangering Lan's vacationing friends. In Team ProtoMan, it is Tesla Magnus, who has inherited MagnetMan.EXE from her Gospel agent father, Gauss Magnus. In Team Colonel, it is Princess Pride, operator of KnightMan.EXE, who has turned over a new leaf since the events of Battle Network 2. The leader of the liberation team then hires a free agent to join the team, but this free agent insists on testing Lan and MegaMan at length, forcing them to overcome a series of challenges. In Team ProtoMan, this free agent is series newcomer Charlie Airstar, a Netopian helicopter pilot, and his agile NetNavi, GyroMan.EXE. In Team Colonel, this is former Gospel agent (now revealed to be a mercenary) Dusk and his ninja-like NetNavi, ShadowMan.EXE. The next member of the team is recruited when Lan foils his plot to steal Ubercorp's booster system, a system that amplifies a NetNavi's effectiveness a thousandfold, from aboard the cruise ship Queen Bohemia. In Team ProtoMan, this is fireworks maker Fyrefox and former Solo-NetNavi NapalmMan.EXE, and in Team Colonel this is Netopian Native American Dingo, operator of TomahawkMan.EXE. Both of them get aboard the ship by being hired on to offer the passengers Netbattles for entertainment, but they have different motivations: Fyrefox wants to make more-spectacular fireworks, while Dingo wants revenge for the production of the booster system, which ruined the livelihoods of many in his home community. The next member of the team is brought on to crack the security systems of Yuichiro's computer, in an effort to discover what he was working on when he was kidnapped. A wedge is initially driven between this member of the team when imposters from Nebula disguise themselves as MegaMan and this member's NetNavi fool them into thinking that the other is an agent of Nebula. Once they realize their error, they team up and defeat the Nebula imposters. In Team ProtoMan, Lan and MegaMan are suspicious of the close-lipped nature of Sharo soldier Raika and his military- minded NetNavi SearchMan.EXE, while in Team Colonel they are suspicious of how desperate shopkeeper and Higsby, operator of NumberMan.EXE and former agent of the evil organization WWW, is to join the team. The last member of the team forces herself onto the team, in order to accomplish her own goals. In doing so, however, she accidentally gets ProtoMan.EXE (or Colonel, depending on the version) captured and corrupted by Nebula, and the team must confront and rescue him. In Team ProtoMan, this is series newcomer Jasmine, operator of medic-themed NetNavi Meddy.EXE, and she seeks to find a medical book hidden on the Undernet to cure her grandfather. In Team Colonel, this is DNN reporter Ribitta, owner of ToadMan.EXE, and she seeks to deduce the identities of Team Colonel. == Development and reception == The fifth installation of the game was first advertised in Japanese magazine, Corocoro Comic in August 2004. Mega Man Battle Network 5: Team ProtoMan was the 48th best-selling game in Japan in 2004 at 255,061 copies. This version was also the 55th best-selling game in the country in 2005 at 211,099 copies. Mega Man Battle Network 5: Team Colonel placed at number 65 with 194,472 copies sold that year. Mega Man Battle Network 5: Double Team DS was the 52nd best-selling Nintendo DS game in Japan in 2005 at 106,526 copies. In North America, both the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions of Mega Man Battle Network 5 met with fairly tepid critical reception, with Metacritic and GameRankings aggregate scores ranging from 66% to 70% across the different versions. Reviewers criticized the game for its lack of innovation over its predecessors, describing it as an \\"incremental advancement,\\" \\"an old, whiffy GBA kids RPG,\\" and \\"just too darn much like its predecessors.\\" Reviewers often highlighted the reuse of aging art and sound assets from previous games, comparing them unfavorably with contemporary Game Boy Advance games. Reviews weren't entirely unfavorable, especially when the topic of Battle Network 5's predecessor was concerned. GameSpot, in particular, compared it favorably with Mega Man Battle Network 4. == Notes == == References == == External links == *Official website Category:Role-playing video games Category:Game Boy Advance games 5 Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Tactical role-playing video games Category:2004 video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Akari Kaida Category:Video games scored by Yoshino Aoki Category:Video games with alternate versions Category:Virtual Console games Category:Virtual Console games for Wii U ","title":"Mega Man Battle Network 5"},{"id":"2201268","text":"Yarn with 2.5 tpi TPI (twists per inch or turns per inch) is a term used in the textile industry. It measures how much twist a yarn has,Kadolph, Sara J., ed.: Textiles, 10th edition, Pearson/Prentice-Hall, 2007, , p. 197 and can be calculated by counting the number of twists in an inch of yarn. ==Variation per yarn== Twist is needed in yarn to hold the fibres together, and is added in the spinning and plying processes. The amount of twist varies depending on the fibre, thickness of yarn, preparation of fibre, manner of spinning, and the desired result. Fine wool and silk generally use more twist than coarse wool, short staples more than long, thin more than thick, and short drawn more than long drawn. The amount of twist in a yarn helps to define the style of yarn ‚Äì a yarn with a lot of air such as a woollen-spun yarn will have much less twist than a yarn with little air such as a worsted-spun yarn. The amount of twist also affects the yarn in terms of stretchiness, strength, halo, and many other attributes. Filling or weft yarns usually have fewer twists per inch because strength is not as important as with warp yarns, and highly twisted yarns are, in general, stronger. Warp yarns have to be stronger so that they can withstand the tension of the loom. Filament fibers, such as silk, or many synthetics, need only be twisted slightly to create a yarn. ==Handspinning== Handspinners use the number of twists per inch often. Because the amount of twist defines a lot about a yarn, the number of twists per inch is an important measure to recreate a yarn. As a spinner spins, they will often stop every few minutes to check to see that the number of twists per inch is the same throughout the yarn, as well as that the number of wraps per inch (the thickness of the yarn) is the same. Measuring the number of twists per inch while spinning singles also helps the spinner create a balanced yarn when plying. Yarns that have relatively few twists per inch tend to have a softer hand but are not as strong as yarns with more twists per inch, such as medium twist or hard twist yarns. Yarns that have a very hard twist, enough so that the yarn will double back onto itself when released from tension, are called crepe-twist yarns. ==Determining how many twists per inch== 130px The number of twists per inch can, in plied yarns, be determined by counting the number of bumps in one inch, and dividing that number by the number of singles (the strands plied together to make the yarn). If the adjacent picture, for example, was of an inch of two ply yarn, then the number of twists per inch would be 6 divided by 2, or three, as there are six bumps, and it is a two ply. While this method works well with plied yarns, singles don't have bumps to count. One way to determine the tpi for a single is to add a contrasting color fibre when spinning it, and then count the number of times the contrasting fibre has wrapped around the yarn. Another method is to measure an inch of yarn and untwist it, counting how many full revolutions it takes until there is no twist left. This can be done by inserting two paper-clips into the yarn, at an inch apart, thus making it easier to count a full revolution. A less precise method is to allow the single to ply against itself: the resulting two ply yarn is about half the number of twists per inch of the single. Thus one can roughly find the number of twists per inch for the single, or one can use the doubled back yarn as a measure. With a thick-and- thin yarn, it is best to count the twist over several inches and average the results. This is because the number of twists per inch will tend to vary between the thin and thick sections. ==In industry== In the industry the number of twists per inch is calculated as: TPI = TM \\\\times\\\\sqrt{count} where TM is the Twist Multiplier, also known as K or the Twist Factor. This Twist Multiplier is an empirical parameter that has been established by experiments and practice that the maximum strength of a yarn is obtained for a definite value of K. In the case of ring spun cotton yarns, for example, the following values of K have been found to give the best results. Warp yarns, 35's and less 4.75 Warp yarns, 35's to 80's 4.50 Warp yarns, 80's to 110's 4.25 Filling yarns, medium numbers 3.50 ==See also== * Spinning * Weaving * Yarn ==Notes== Category:Yarn ","title":"Twist per inch"},{"id":"2201269","text":"Raging Spirits is a roller coaster attraction in Tokyo DisneySea, began operation on July 21, 2005.

The group consists of Bronx-born Marty Cintron and twin brothers Ariel and Gabriel Hern√°ndez, who hailed from Miami. ==Career1995‚Äì1997: My Promise=== In 1995 the group released their single \\"Missing\\" which was a cover version of Everything but the Girl's 1994 hit. No Mercy released their debut album My Promise on October 21, 1996. My Promise was the original title chosen by the trio's German record company, Hansa, BMG. The album was released in the U.S. only a week later under the self title No Mercy on October 29, 1996. The album, however, was released in most areas of the world with its original title My Promise, including Australia where it received two times platinum sales accreditation. My Promise which became a top-5 album in countries like Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland, produced two internationally popular singles, including \\"Where Do You Go\\" and \\"When I Die\\", the first being a cover of La Bouche's \\"Where Do You Go\\" from 1995. This was followed by the single \\"Please Don't Go\\", which entered the top 5 in Austria and the U.K. The trio released a re-worked version of the band Exile's number one song from 1978, \\"Kiss You All Over\\", which was a moderate success on the charts but still managed to enter the top 20 in Austria, the Netherlands and the UK. ===1998‚Äì1999: More=== No Mercy's second album, More, which was released in Germany on October 12, 1998, included singles such as \\"Hello How Are You\\", \\"More than a Feeling\\" (originally recorded by Boston) and \\"Tu Amor\\" (originally by Jon B., and later covered also by RBD). Although More was not as successful as its predecessor, it still managed to achieve success in the GSA region (Germany, Switzerland, Austria), peaking at No.7, No.9, No.9 respectively. ===2000‚Äìpresent: Singles and current status=== In 2002, a single, \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\" featuring guitarist Al Di Meola, was released to gauge support for No Mercy's third album. The record producer decided instead to rework the songs for solo artist Daniel Lopes' debut album, Shine On, in 2003. The band would guest feature in that album, on the track \\"Summer Angel\\". In October 2007, No Mercy released their third album, Day By Day, under a new Australian-based independent record label, Show No Mercy Entertainment Pty Ltd, and via iTunes. On December 16, 2011 No Mercy released the single \\"Shed My Skin\\" featuring Stan Kolev via iTunes. ==In popular culture== No Mercy's version of the La Bouche song \\"Where Do You Go\\" (Ocean Drive Mix) was featured in the 1998 American comedy film A Night at the Roxbury.

The succession to the position of Rain Queen is matrilineal, so her eldest daughter is the heir, and males are not entitled to inherit the throne at all. The Rain Queen is believed to have special powers, including the ability to control the clouds and rainfall. there is no ruling Rain Queen, as the previous Rain Queen died on 12 June 2005. However, a new Rain Queen is expected to be crowned when she turns 18.Njanji, Susan. \\"SA's pre-teen queen with 'rainmaking' powers\\" , The Citizen (November 6, 2017). Royal Princesses: Tebogo Mokope Modjadji-Kekana (Dr) Mokgadi Modjadji (Senior Advocate) Modjadji Modjadji (Late) ==History== There are several different stories relating to the creation and history of the Rain Queens of Balobedu. One story states that an old chief in 16th century Monomotapa (South eastern Zimbabwe), was told by his ancestors that by impregnating his daughter, Dzugundini, she would gain rain-making skills. Another story involves a scandal in the same chief's house, in which the chief's son impregnated Dzugundini. Dzugundini was held responsible and was forced to flee the village. Dzugundini ended up in Molototsi Valley, which is in the present day Balobedu Kingdom. The village she established with her loyal followers was ruled by a Mugudo, a male leader, but the peace and harmony of the village was disrupted by rivalries between different families; therefore, to pacify the land, Mugudo impregnated his own daughter in order to restore the tribe's matrilineal tradition. She gave birth to the first Rain Queen, known as Modjadji, which means: \\"ruler of the day\\". ==Customs== According to custom, the Rain Queen must shun public functions, and can only communicate with her people through her male or female councillors. Every November she presides over the annual Rainmaking ceremony at her royal compound in Khetlhakone Village. She is not supposed to marry, but has many \\"wives\\", as they are referred to in the Balobedu language. These are not spouses in the usual sense of the word; as a queen regnant, she has the equivalent of royal court servants, or ladies-in-waiting), sent from many villages all over the Balobedu Kingdom. These wives were selected by The Queen's Royal Council and in general are from the households of the subject chiefs. This ritual of \\"bride giving\\" is strictly a form of diplomacy to ensure loyalty to the Queen. The Rain Queen's mystical rain making powers are believed to be reflected in the lush garden which surrounds her royal compound. Surrounded by parched land, her garden contains the world's largest cycad trees which are in abundance under a spectacular rain belt. One species of cycad, the Modjadji cycad, is named after the Rain Queen. The Rain Queen is a prominent figure in South Africa, many communities respecting her position and, historically, attempting to avoid conflict in deference thereto. Even Shaka Zulu of Zululand sent his top emissaries to ask her for her blessings. The fifth Rain Queen, Mokope Modjadji, maintained cordial relations with Nelson Mandela. The Rain Queen has become a figure of interest, she and the royal institution becoming a significant tourist attraction contributing to the South African economy. The Rain Queen was offered an annual government civil list. The stipend was also expected to help defray the costs of preserving the cycad trees found in the Rain Queen's gardens. ==Makobo Modjadji== Makobo Constance Modjadji VI Rain Queen Makobo Constance Modjadji VI (1978 ‚Äì 12 June 2005) was the sixth in a line of the Balobedu people's Rain Queens. Makobo was crowned on 16 April 2003, at the age of 25, after the death of her predecessor and grandmother, Queen Mokope Modjadji. This made her the youngest queen in the history of the Balobedu. Makobo was admitted into the Limpopo Medi-Clinic for an undisclosed illness on 10 June 2005 and died two days later, at the age of 27. The official cause of death was listed as chronic meningitis. She is survived by a son, Prince Lekukela Hex (b. 1997), and a daughter, Princess Masalanabo (b. February 2005). ==Succession== The Rain Queen's official mates are chosen by the Royal Council, so that all of her children will be of dynastic status, from which future Rain Queens may descend. However, the Rain Queens are not expected to remain in exclusive relations with these partners. In the past, the Rain Queen was allowed to have children only by her close relatives. Perhaps uniquely, the Balobedu crown descends according to matrilineal primogeniture: her eldest daughter is always her successor, so the title of Rain Queen is normally passed from mother to daughter. It is said that she ingests poison when she is near death so that her daughter will assume the crown more quickly. Lately, however, many traditions have been abandoned, influenced by Christian missionaries. Because Makobo's daughter, Princess Masalanabo, was fathered by a commoner, traditionalists are not likely to accept her as the rightful successor to the throne. Therefore, there are worries that the 400-year-old Rain Queen dynasty may be coming to an end. No new Rain Queen has been enthroned since Makobo died. Makobo's brother Prince Mpapatla has been designated regent for Masalanabo. However, Mpapatla has a daughter by his cousin, a woman from the royal Modjadji line, and a group of members of the Royal Council has indicated a preference for Mpapatla's daughter to succeed as Rain Queen. Mpapatla, however, has insisted that his late sister's daughter, Princess Masalanabo, will be enthroned as the queen when she turns 18. A male branch of the extended royal clan has also petitioned the South African president to restore the male line of the Balobedu royal house, which reigned before 1800. This entreaty is considered unlikely to be granted, inasmuch as the Rain Queen heritage is recognised as a national cultural legacy and interest in it has stimulated significant tourist trade. ==Rain Queens== # Rain Queen I Maselekwane Modjadji (1800‚Äì1854) # Rain Queen II Masalanabo I Modjadji (1854‚Äì1894) # Rain Queen III Khesetoane Modjadji (1895‚Äì1959) # Rain Queen IV Makoma Modjadji (1959‚Äì1980) # Rain Queen V Mokope Modjadji (1981‚Äì2001) # Rain Queen VI Makobo Modjadji (2003‚Äì2005) # Prince Regent Mpapada Modjadji (2007-2018) ==In popular culture== She: A History of Adventure.

The film stars Robert Burke as Hitch, a mysterious man who wanders the deserts in Namibia and is wanted by the police in connection with the death of a woman whose blood was used in a supernatural ceremony. It is believed by a local Sngoma that Hitch is a \\"Dust Devil\\", a supernatural creature that can change its form. Hitch encounters Wendy played by Chelsea Field, who drives with him along a highway as she is pursued by her estranged husband. As police begin investigating the murders, they seem to trace back to Hitch and Wendy discovers the man has supernatural powers. The film was shot in Namibia after March 1990. when Stanley presented his script to producer JoAnne Sellar, whom he had previously worked with on his first film Hardware. Sellar was able to secure 2.8 million pounds for Dust Devil. The script was then sent to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in Namibia for approval. Sellar was also able to use South African personnel and equipment for the production, making the film's crew a combination of British, American, South African and Namibian people. After finishing filming, Dust Devil went into difficulty in its early production phases with several different cuts being released in the United Kingdom, the United States and select areas in Europe where the film was released in a much shorter version titled Demonica. The film was released in United Kingdom following the demise of Palace Pictures under an end credit of Dust Devil: The Final Cut. It was released in the United States by Miramax with a shorter running time than the British version. ==Plot== In Namibia, a Sngoma named Joe Niemand recites a story about \\"the desert wind (soo-oop-wa), who was a man, until. by mischance, he grew wings and flew like a bird. He became a hunter and like a hawk he flew to seek his prey, taking refuge in the far corners of the world where magic still lingers, But having once been a man, he still suffer the passions of a man, \\"flying in the rages sometimes, and throwing himself down like a child, to vent his wrath upon the earth.\\" and stating that the people of the great Namib refer to them as Dust Devils. A man walks on a road in the desert, and meets with a woman named Saarke driving along it, who takes him back to her house. While the two have sex, the man kills her. Meanwhile, in the town of Bethanie, Sgt. Ben Mukurob receives a phone call with strange voices speaking, as does Wendy Robinson in Johannesburg, South Africa. In the morning, the man burns down Saarke's house & leaves in her car. In Johannesburg, Wendy's husband Mark accuses her of cheating on him, leading her to leave him and drive to Namibia. Meanwhile, Mukurob and Captain Beyman investigate Saarke's house and find strange pictographs on the wall. Wendy runs her car off the road near a camper with a man near by. After the two push her car back on the road, Wendy then sees Dust Devil on the road side and offers him a ride.. Cpl. Dutoit and Cpl. Bates then find the camper with dismembered body parts inside. Mukurob drives to Joe's home that the symbols found were the work of magic, to which Mukurob scoffs. Wendy and Dust Devil continue driving and pass another hitch-hiker, but Dust Devil tells Wendy not to stop. As they pass the hitch-hiker, Dust Devil disappears. With Dust Devil secretly watching, Wendy stops at a small motel for the night and tries to commit suicide but stops herself. Wendy goes to her car the next morning and finds Dust Devil inside, who tells her that she was asleep the day before. Meanwhile, Beyman gives Mukurob documents about murders similar to the one he is following dating back as far as 1908. Wendy and Dust Devil reach the Fish River Canyon as Wendy's husband Mark, arrives in Namibia and begins his search for her. Joe takes Mukurob to a mountain cave and tells him that the murders are the work of the \\"naghtloper\\", a shape-shifting demon who gains power over the material world through ritual murder. Joe explains that the naghtloper must keep moving to work the ritual, but if he is tricked to step over a kierie stick, he will be bound to one spot and his power can be taken. Joe then gives Mukurob a kierie and a sacred root to burn to prevent the naghtloper from possessing him after it is killed. Wendy discovers human fingers among Dust Devil's belongings which leads to him to attempt to kill her which Wendy escapes. Dust Devil pursues her leading to Wendy crashing her car and escaping into the desert. Meanwhile, Mukurob releases Mark from prison as they search for Wendy. As drive through a dust storm, Dust Devil attacks them, causing the car to flip over. Mukurob handcuffs Mark to the car and heads into the storm, telling him that he has a chance since the naghtloper only takes those who have nothing to live for. Wendy reaches the abandoned town of Kolmanskop where Mukurob finds her and searches for Dust Devil. He runs into Dust Devil, who stabs him. Wendy then finds Dust Devil as Mukurob takes the kierie and puts it in front of Dust Devil as he steps forward. Wendy picks up Mukurob's shotgun and kills Dust Devil as he says, \\"I love you, Wendy\\". Wendy then walks into the desert past Mark and the car, lies on the road and pulls over a fleet of army Casspirs. The film ends with Joe saying, \\"The desert knows her name now, he has stolen both her eyes. When she looks into a mirror, she will see his spirit like a shawl blowing tatters around her shoulders in a haze. And beyond the dim horizon, a tapestry unfolding of the avenues of evil, and all of history set ablaze.\\" ==Cast== * John Matshikiza as Joe Niemand (also the narrator) * Robert John Burke as Dust Devil * Terri Norton as Saarke Haarhoff * Chelsea Field as Wendy Robinson * Rufus Swart as Mark Robinson * William Hootkins as Capt.

Richard Stanley's previous film Hardware was made for ¬£1 million, and grossed over $70 million world-wide. Stanley stated that Hardware was made to prove to producers that he could make a commercial film after finding that he was rejected by producers from his first scripts. Dust Devil was shot entirely on location in Namibia, and re-interprets the story of a South African serial killer known as Nhadiep. The story of Nhadiep had previously been the inspiration for the British film Windprints (1989) by David Wicht. Dust Devil was made from a previous work of Stanley's, an unfinished 16mm student short film about bizarre murders taking place around the town of Bethanie. The authorities never caught the serial killer, which led to locals believing the killings were caused by a supernatural force. The police eventually returned to town with the body of a man they believed was the killer; however, the body was without a head, which made identification with locals impossible. The man was later buried in a town with a grave marked \\"Nhadiep\\". Stanley felt his film was not initially a horror film, but admitted the film had traits of the genre. As well as acknowledging Italian gialli films as an influence, he also felt the film was influenced by Alejandro Jodorowsky's El Topo, Luis Bu√±uel's Simon of the Desert, Pier Paolo Pasolini's The Gospel According to Saint Matthew, and Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West. Stanley would also described the film as a marriage between Italian gialli films and the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone, specifically noting The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly declaring that In Leone's film \\"cynical privateers looked for buried gold against an American Civil War backdrop, My Dust Devil characters weave in and out of similar historical events because I updated the murders to run parallel to Namibia's bloody fight for independence from South Africa in 1989.\\" Stanley also mentioned an influence of Michele Soavi's film The Devil's Daughter, by using \\"his idea of shimmering Virgin Mary blues to similarly represent forces of God.\\" Filming in Namibia became possible following the country's independence in March 1990. Stanley presented his script to producer JoAnne Sellar, who he had previously worked with on Hardware. Sellar was able to secure 2.8 million pounds for Dust Devil. The script was then sent to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in Namibia for approval. Sellar was also able to use South African personnel and equipment for the production, making the film's crew a combination of British, American, South African and Namibian people. Post-production of Dust Devil began in 1991 in London. Stanley initially had a 120-minute cut of the film, which was tightened to 110 minutes. Stanley hoped the British financiers would find this edit appropriate for release in Europe and the United Kingdom. However, this was not the case; the financiers cut the film to 95 minutes. The 95-minute version was given a test screening in Wimbledon. Stanley stated that the audience was \\"clearly confused\\", as many of the cuts had taken out parts of the film's first act. Following this screening, Stanley, who was adamant that the previous cut of the film was superior, pushed for an \\"extended European cut\\" of the film, which would run between 110 and 120 minutes. However, further cuts were made, which gave Dust Devil a running time of 87 minutes. In April 1992, Palace Pictures began experiencing financial problems, causing them to pull out of distributing the film in the United Kingdom. ==Release== Dust Devil was financed by an amalgamation of British Investors under the Palace Productions umbrella. The film also received some financial backing from Miramax, the distributors of Stanley's previous film Hardware. In December 1991, Stanley delivered his first fine cut, a 120-minute assembly version that was cut to fufill British television contracts. This version was given to Miramax for their consideration who returned it as an 85-minute version. In February 1992, Palace who was on the verge of financial collapse, asked Stanley to accept a cut that was a compromise between the original version and the Miramax edit. Stanley mentioned that \\"Palace explained it would be financially expedient to arrive at a compromise but I'd have nothing to do with it. I'd lost footage already and I wasn't willing to go back in the editing room.\\" Dust Devil was initially set to be released in the United Kingdom in December 1992. Due to the withdrawal of Palace Pictures, Dust Devil was only shown for one week in one cinema in the United Kingdom before being released to home video. A 94-minute cut was test-screend to a what Mark Kermode of Shivers magazine described as \\"a poor reaction.\\" A shortened version that was accepted by Miramax was shown in Spain and Portugal under the title Demonica and was also shown at the Avoriaz Film Festival. After Palace lost its money, Stanley persuaded Polygram to have a new version ready which he personally financed with ¬£15,000. Months later the film was released in the United Kingdom and was identified in the end credits as Dust Devil: The Final Cut. An 80-minute cut of the film that was not color-graded was shown in some European territories prior to 1994 which Richard Stanley described as \\"an effort to liberate blocked funds and has subsequently been withdrawn with the consent of all parties.\\" Stanley wrote to Shivers magazine published in January 1994 that Miramax were planning to distribute Dust Devil in January 1994 with a home video release of the film later in the year. The American cut of the film released by Miramax removed about 20 minutes of footage. Stanley recently recorded commentaries and interviews not only for this film, but also for three rarely-seen documentary films he had directed over the last decade and a half, Voice of the Moon, The Secret Glory and The White Darkness. ==Reception== In Sight & Sound, Kim Newman described the film as a \\"more personal effort than Hardware\\", and that \\"for all its lean boogey man strengths, this is mainly a hallucinatory picture: Stanley delivers the requisite shocks with a buff's care and enthusiasm, but is obviously more interested in eerie desert images like a valley reported created by the slithering of a giant snake at the dawn of time and other unsettling touches.\\" Newman concluded that, on viewing any of the several different edits of the film, Dust Devil was a \\"considerable and remarkable film.\\" In his book Horror and Science Fiction Film IV, Donald C.

At Gaddi's death, he entered the service of the Farnese family, and became confidential secretary to Pier Luigi Farnese, Duke of Parma, and to his sons, Duke Ottavio and Cardinals Ranuccio and Alexander. Caro's most important work were his translations (see below). He is also the author of poems, sonnets, and a comedy called Gli Straccioni. His work additionally includes two clever jeux d'esprit: La Fichelde, in praise of figs, and a eulogy of the big nose of Leoni Ancona, a local figure. His poetry is noted for the freedom and grace of its versification, so that many claim that he brought verso sciolto to its highest form in Italy. Letters he wrote, both in his own name and on behalf of the Cardinals Farnese, are considered remarkable for both the baseness they display and for their euphemistic polish and elegance. Caro's fame was diminished because of the virulence with which he attacked Lodovico Castelvetro in one of his canzoni, and by his meanness for denouncing him to the Church for translating some of the writings of Philipp Melanchthon, an associate of Martin Luther. In 1555 Caro was installed as a \\"knight of grace\\" (a member not taking religious vows) of the Order of Malta by Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. Caro died in Frascati in 1566 and was buried in the Church of San Lorenzo in Damaso in Rome. His prose includes translations of Aristotle, Cyprian, and Gregory Nazianzen. == The translations == Annibal Caro published a translation of the Aeneid of Vergil, which was much admired by contemporaries, and still is read with pleasure by the lovers of the Italian language. Another translation, which remained the standard one for several centuries, is that of Daphnis and Chloe, the ancient Greek novel by Longus. ==References== ==Sources== * ==Bibliography== *Stefano Jossa, ‚ÄòNature vs. Grammar: Annibal Caro‚Äôs Apologia as a Manifesto for Orality‚Äô, in Luca Degl'Innocenti; Brian Richardson; Chiara Sbordoni (eds), Interactions between Orality and Writing in Early Modern Italian Culture (London: Routledge, 2016), pp. 173‚Äì86.

The Mot√∂rhead line-up consisting of Taylor, Lemmy, and \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke is generally regarded as the 'classic' line-up of the band. ==Biography== Born on 21 September 1954, in Hasland, Chesterfield, Taylor grew up in Leeds. He took drum lessons at Leeds College of Music on advice from his father. After meeting Lemmy, who was a fellow speed user, he joined Mot√∂rhead and replaced Lucas Fox during the recording of the band's first album On Parole in 1975. Lemmy has said that Fox wasn't working out and Taylor \\"had a car and could give us a lift back down to the studio\\". Taylor, in turn, introduced Lemmy to guitarist \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke, having worked with him while painting a houseboat. Shortly after recording the classic Ace of Spades album in 1980, Taylor broke his neck after being lifted above the head of a friend in a test of strength, only to be dropped on his head. Taylor continued to play in Mot√∂rhead with the aid of a neck brace, as is visible in the music video for \\"Ace of Spades\\". As a result, Taylor had a prominent lump located on the back of his neck (affectionately referred to as his \\"knob\\"), thought to be a calcium deposit caused by his previous spinal trauma. Tour-disrupting injuries were not unfamiliar to Taylor at the time, as he had previously broken his hand whilst punching a man outside his flat in London. Taylor continued to drum by using gaffer tape to attach his drum stick into his hand until it had sufficiently healed. Taylor left Mot√∂rhead in 1984. The following year, he made appearances with Waysted, and joined former Mot√∂rhead and Thin Lizzy guitarist Brian Robertson to form the band Operator. In 1986, he was part of Frankie Miller's touring band. Taylor returned to Mot√∂rhead in 1987. He said \\"I always regretted leaving. Let's just say I took a three-year holiday.\\" He continued playing in the group until 1992. After having been warned three times in the previous two years \\"to get his act together\\", he was fired after recording \\"I Ain't No Nice Guy\\", because of his poor performance.Kilmister, Ian and Garza, Janiss White Line Fever (2002) ‚Äî Simon & Schuster pp. 242-243 From 2005 to 2008 Taylor played and recorded in a group called The Web of Spider with Whitey Kirst (Iggy Pop) on guitar and Max Noce on bass. In 2007 Taylor briefly worked on a project called Capricorn with former Danzig guitarist Todd Youth, former Monster Magnet guitarist Phil Caivano and former Nashville Pussy bassist Corey Parks. After playing in The Web of Spider, Taylor began work on a project with guitarist Chris Holmes, formerly of the heavy metal band W.A.S.P., and in 2009, Taylor joined American thrash metal band Overkill for a set at the Islington Academy. The set included a cover of the Mot√∂rhead song from which Overkill took their name. He sporadically played drums for Mick Farren and The Deviants, featuring on Dr. Crow (2002), Sheep in Wolves' Clothing (2008), and Portobello Shuffle (2009). Taylor reunited with Lemmy and Clarke on 6 November 2014 at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham, on stage for Mot√∂rhead's classic \\"Ace of Spades\\" only to come on to wave to the crowd and leave. ==Death== Phil Taylor died on 11 November 2015, in London, at the age of 61 after an illness. Liver failure was cited as a cause. \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke said of his former bandmate: Lemmy told Classic Rock that he was \\"devastated\\" to have lost one of his best friends. He also remembered former Mot√∂rhead guitarist Michael \\"W√ºrzel\\" Burston, who died in 2011. Lemmy died on 28 December 2015, less than seven weeks after Taylor and on 10 January 2018 \\"Fast Eddie\\" Clarke also died, leaving none of the classic Ace of Spades-era M√∂torhead lineup alive. ==DiscographyMot√∂rhead=== *On Parole (recorded 1975‚Äì76, released in 1979) *Mot√∂rhead (1977) *Overkill (1979) *Bomber (1979) *Ace of Spades (1980) *No Sleep 'til Hammersmith (1981) *Iron Fist (1982) *Another Perfect Day (1983) *Rock 'n' Roll (1987) *N√∂ Sleep at All (1988) *1916 (1991) *March √∂r Die (1992) ‚Äì \\"I Ain't No Nice Guy\\" only ===Other recordings=== *The Muggers Tapes ‚Äì live recording from a brief spell of about four gigs.

The original coinage of the term \\"Buschwhacker\\" refers to Anheuser-Busch's longtime title sponsorship of the second-tier series through their Busch beer brand. The practice is controversial due to Cup drivers such as Kyle Busch, Mark Martin, Kevin Harvick (numbers one, two, and three all time in wins in the Xfinity Series), Darrell Waltrip and Dale Earnhardt entering a large portion of races over the course of the season and dominating the races in superior equipment, taking good finishes, competitive rides and sponsorship, and exposure away from both development drivers and veterans who are regulars in the series. Many NASCAR experts, however, contend that without Cup drivers and the large amount of fan interest and sponsorship they attract, the series would cease to exist. Due to NASCAR rules changes that took effect in 2011, drivers must now select one of the top three touring series and be eligible for the driver points championship in that class only. This prevents Cup Series regulars from also competing for points in the lower series. Before these changes, the last series regular to win the Nationwide Series points title was Martin Truex Jr., winning in 2004 and 2005. Despite these changes, Cup drivers have continued their dominance, shifting their focus to winning the owners' championship. In the five years following the rule change, the owners' champions were the #60 team of Roush Fenway Racing with Carl Edwards racing the majority of the season in 2011, the #18 with various Joe Gibbs Racing drivers in 2012, and the #22 of Team Penske from 2013 to 2015 with Brad Keselowski and Joey Logano running the majority of the races. ==The practice== The primary advantage of running both Cup and Xfinity Series races is extra practice (\\"seat time\\") for the drivers. Xfinity races are often run as support races a day prior to Cup Series races, and use similar equipment, though Xfinity cars have less horsepower than Cup cars. Some racing experts suggested that when the Cup series transitioned to the safety-oriented Car of Tomorrow in 2007, the advantage of Cup drivers racing in these events would decrease greatly due to differences in the designs of the vehicles. However, this did not decrease the presence of Cup drivers in the series, as each Xfinity Series (then known as the Nationwide Series) drivers' title from 2006 to 2010 was won by a Cup Series regular. The aerodynamic differences of the two series were greatly reduced when the Nationwide Series implemented its own Car of Tomorrow in 2010. The practice is also seen in the third-tier Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series, particularly by Kyle Busch (who currently operates his own team Kyle Busch Motorsports, in the Truck Series), and Kevin Harvick (who formerly operated Kevin Harvick Incorporated from 2002 to 2012). Busch's #51 truck won the owner's championship in 2013, with Busch running 11 of the 22 races and scoring 5 wins, and again in 2014, where Busch won 7 out of the 10 races he participated in. Cup drivers occasionally dabble in NASCAR's regional series, such as Ryan Newman running select Whelen Modified Tour events for Kevin Manion and Mike Curb, the sister ARCA Racing Series, and local dirt and short track events. The presence of Buschwhackers is seen as problematic by some regulars in the lower series, who complain about more accomplished Cup drivers taking the top prize money and thus leading to loss of sponsorship for their efforts. Cup drivers often run in cars fielded by or affiliated with their Cup Series teams, giving them superior equipment and increased resources. The presence of the Cup teams have driven up the costs of competition, forcing many independent Xfinity Series teams to shut their doors. Many sponsors are hesitant to put financial backing behind an unproven driver, insisting that Cup drivers run in at least part of the schedule, which has led to several incidents of young drivers receiving part-time schedules or being pulled from an entry before (or even during) a race in favor of a Cup driver. In 2008, for example, Kelly Bires was forced to sit out the Daytona season opener due to contractual obligations with JR Motorsports' sponsor Unilever stating that Dale Earnhardt Jr. drive a certain number of races for the team. Other criticisms of \\"buschwacking\\" cite the lack of Xfinity Series veterans left in the series. Long-time series regulars and champions (such as Steve Grissom, David Green, Randy LaJoie, Jason Keller, Casey Atwood, and Ashton Lewis, Jr.) have seen their exit from the series in the 2000s, while 2000 champion Jeff Green has driven primarily in start and park entries since 2011. While Cup drivers attract fans to the lower-tier series, many fans are turned off by the dominance of the senior circuit competitors over their junior league competitors, with Cup drivers often winning over half of the races in a season. Comparisons have been drawn to a top-tier Major League Baseball player competing against minor-leaguers, or adults competing against children. Some drivers, including Dale Earnhardt, Jr., have also been critical of the dominance of Cup competitors. (During the 2017 Xfinity Series season, Earnhardt's four full-time Xfinity teams were driven by Xfinity regulars, and Cup drivers ran a fifth car in only four races. Earnhardt plans four full-time teams in 2018 and no Cup driver is scheduled in his fifth car, which he will participate in a minimum of two races, but will not be a Cup regular.) Many fans, as well as longtime series regular Kenny Wallace, also note the increased focus given to Cup drivers during the broadcast and promotion of the races. This changed beginning in 2012, when NASCAR produced several commercials promoting up-and-coming series regulars. In spite of the negatives of the practice, the presence of NASCAR's top-level drivers attracts sponsorship to the lower series that may not be there without them, adds credibility to the series, and makes it easier for tracks to promote races. Many series regulars have also pointed out that the presence of Cup regulars allows them to improve their own driving styles and compete against the best in the sport. The series does still serve its purpose for driver development, with a steady influx of successful new drivers into the Sprint Cup Series: e.g., in 2007 three of the Top 10 drivers had less than four years of Cup experience, eight of the ten had less than 10 years of Cup experience, and only one (Jeff Burton) was over 40 years of age.http://www.racing- reference.info/raceyear?yr=2007&series;=W All eight drivers of the 2014 Sprint Cup Rookie class (Kyle Larson, Austin Dillon, Justin Allgaier, Cole Whitt, Alex Bowman, Michael Annett, Ryan Truex, Parker Kligerman) had significant experience in the Nationwide Series, with six of them running at least one full season. The series also continues to provide an outlet for former Cup drivers (such as Elliott Sadler, Regan Smith, and Sam Hornish, Jr.) to rebuild their careers, or as Dale Earnhardt, Jr. plans, a way to race a limited schedule in semi-retirement, as does the Truck Series for drivers such as Ron Hornaday, Jr. and Johnny Sauter. Cup crew chiefs have also been developed from this level. Kyle Busch often uses a developmental crew chief in most of his wins; Dave Rogers and Adam Stevens, two of the current Joe Gibbs Racing crew chiefs at the Sprint Cup level, both used the Xfinity level to move up. Greg Ives was the 2014 Xfinity Series champion crew chief with Chase Elliott before being called up to the Sprint Cup level in 2015 to be Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s crew chief. In some cases, a Cup driver will use a developmental engineer or crew chief, and an Xfinity regular may use an experienced Cup-level engineer. ==History== Although one of the original purposes of the second-tier series was for driver development, Cup Series drivers have been moonlighting in the series since its inception in 1982 (as the Budweiser Late Model Sportsman Series), when Winston Cup Champion Dale Earnhardt won the series' inaugural event at Daytona International Speedway. Prior to the year 2000, Cup drivers would often limit their schedules in the Busch Series, partially because the majority of the races were held at separate venues from the Cup Series. Two of the most notable drivers to frequent the second-tier series, Mark Martin and Harry Gant, have never run more than 17 Busch series races during any single season in their career except for Martin's 1987 season. In the past, Cup drivers had also run in equipment independent from Cup Series teams; drivers Michael Waltrip and Joe Nemechek for example fielded their own race teams in the then-Busch Series for many years. The presence of veteran Cup drivers helped to develop several future Cup Series regulars, including Jeff Gordon, Bobby Labonte, and Jeff Burton. In 2003, Richard Childress Racing set out to win the Busch Series Owner's Championship with their 21 Car sponsored by The Hershey Company's PayDay brand. Cup driver Kevin Harvick was tabbed to drive 15 of the 34 races, with development driver Johnny Sauter filling out the rest of the schedule. Harvick ended up running 19 races, with three wins and top tens in all but one race, and RCR became the first team to win an owner's points title with two different drivers. Since then, the presence of Cup drivers and teams has increased; RCR for example continued to run the 21 with Harvick as well as a full-time 29 car with Jeff Burton for the owner's championship, while the 2 car with Clint Bowyer won the driver's championship in 2008. Several other non-rookie Sprint Cup Series drivers, including Greg Biffle, Carl Edwards, J. J. Yeley, Denny Hamlin, and Reed Sorenson, began running the entire Nationwide schedule while also competing in a full season of Sprint Cup, even though on some weekends the two series competed at venues hundreds of miles apart. In 2006, only two non-Cup Series regulars won a race during the 35-race schedule: David Gilliland and Paul Menard. Menard and Johnny Sauter were the only Busch Series regulars to finish in the top-10 in points that season. In 2007, only three Busch drivers scored a victory: Aric Almirola, Stephen Leicht and Jason Leffler. Almirola's victory at the Milwaukee Mile on June 23 was controversial and unusual, as Almirola was pulled from his pole-winning car after leading 42 of the first 58 laps to make room for Cup regular Denny Hamlin, due to obligations with sponsor Rockwell Automation which is headquartered in Milwaukee. Hamlin was scheduled to compete in a Cup event at Infineon Raceway the same weekend, and had several delays in his trek from California to Wisconsin. Despite the loss in track position due to the driver change, Hamlin got back to the front to take the checkered flag after 250 laps. Almirola was officially credited with the win because he made the start, but did not participate in victory celebrations.http://www.racing-reference.info/race?id=2007-17&series;=B There have been some proposals made to restrict Cup regulars' participation in the now-Xfinity Series, including increasing the purse for series regulars, not awarding championship points to such drivers, forcing Cup drivers to start at the back, or restricting the number of races a Cup driver can run in the other series. In late 2010, media reports began to indicate that NASCAR would respond to the critics of \\"claim jumping\\" by effectively splitting the difference between the two extremes of unrestricted presence of Cup drivers and none at all. It was specifically reported that in 2011, Cup drivers would be allowed to run in the Nationwide Series, but not to compete for the series championship. This rule change was confirmed by NASCAR.com in a report on January 11, 2011. Drivers are now allowed to compete for the championship in only one of NASCAR's three national touring series in a given season. The NASCAR license application form now includes a check box requiring drivers to select the series in which they wish to compete for the championship. NASCAR president and CEO Brian France officially announced this change on January 26, adding that Cup Series drivers will still be allowed to earn owner's points, but not driver's points, in the Nationwide and Truck Series. In spite of the rule changes, between 2011 and March 2014, Nationwide Series regulars have only gone to victory lane in 28 of the 103 races run during that period. 2013 also saw Austin Dillon win the series championship without scoring a win. On October 26, 2016, NASCAR announced plans to limit Cup participation in the lower series starting in 2017. Cup drivers with at least five years of experience in the series would be allowed to compete in up to ten Xfinity and seven Truck Series races, and are banned from racing in the final eight races of the lower series season (regular season finale and Chase races) and the Xfinity Dash 4 Cash races. The number was further reduced to up to seven Xfinity Series races and up to five Camping World Truck Series races in 2018. The new restrictions for 2018 also include an outright prohibition of full- time Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series drivers from the 12 (Xfinity) or eight (Truck) protected races (the seven playoff races, the Las Vegas regular season finale in both series and the four bonus money program races in Xfinity).http://nascar.nbcsports.com/2017/08/01/nascar-to-further-limit-cup- drivers-in-xfinity-truck-series-in-2018/ ==Usage== The term originated in an argument Craig Witkowski had with another user \\"Tinadog\\" in the Usenet newsgroup rec.autos.sport.NASCAR (\\"rasn\\" for short) in May 1997. Tinadog was against Dale Earnhardt and liked Mark Martin, and Witkowski the reverse. Witkowski was especially critical of Martin using his Winston Cup team and resources to beat up on the drivers in the lower Busch Grand National Series. The old western term of \\"bushwhacker\\" was morphed into \\"Busch Whacker\\". The term continued in use among the regulars on , referring now to any driver whose primary ride is in the Cup series and cherry-picks Busch races. The term was picked up by Fox Sports broadcaster Mike Joy, who also participated in the group. After Joy used the term in his broadcasts, it was picked up by other members of the media and found its way into common use. Joy gave credit on the air with 57 laps to go in the Fox telecast of the Koolerz 300 Busch Series race at Daytona International Speedway in 2003. Fox later discontinued the use of the term on its telecasts. This may have been done to save face among the critics of this practice, or perhaps because few of the leaders were non- Sprint Cup Series drivers anymore. When the Busch Series became the Nationwide Series, the term \\"claim jumper\\" was coined and used by Fox broadcaster Larry McReynolds initially, as Nationwide is an insurance company. The term puns off an insurance claim and mining rights. The practice of Cup drivers who compete in Truck Series events has been referred to as \\"tail gating\\", and the drivers referred to as \\"tail-gators\\", although this usage is not common. == References == * https://groups.google.com/group/rec.autos.sport.nascar/msg/123cac6eb8ae3bb9 * https://groups.google.com/group/rec.autos.sport.nascar/browse_frm/thread/167b5763e2f50155 * The Death of WCW, a book by R.D.

She becomes the new Robin in The Dark Knight Returns when she saves Batman's life. Later in The Dark Knight Strikes Again, she adopts the identity Catgirl, and in The Dark Knight III: The Master Race, she adopts the identity Batwoman. She was the first full-time female Robin in the history of the Batman franchise, though Julie Madison had passed off as Robin for a brief time in a Bob Kane story published in Detective Comics #49 in March 1941. ==Publication history== According to Frank Miller, the idea to create Carrie Kelley was sparked by a conversation of him with superhero comics veteran John Byrne while they were flying to an Ohio comic convention. When Miller told Byrne he was writing a Batman story featuring an old and crankier Batman, Byrne recommended him to make Robin a girl and drew him a sketch. Miller liked the concept so much and ultimately included it in The Dark Knight Returns. ==Fictional character biographyThe Dark Knight Returns=== Carrie Kelley is a 13-year-old schoolgirl and scout whom Batman saves from a sadistic group of Mutant gang members on the night of his return from retirement. Idolizing the Dark Knight, she then spends her lunch money on a Robin outfit, sets out to attack petty con-men and to find Batman in the hope of becoming his partner. Kelley uses a slingshot and firecrackers as weapons. She also wears green-tinted sunglasses in lieu of a black domino mask. Like most of the young characters in the book, she speaks in a futuristic slang that Miller credited colorist (and Miller's wife) Lynn Varley with helping to create.\\"Comic book artist and writer Frank Miller,\\" Fresh Air (November 14, 2002): \\"Frank Miller: 'The whole thing actually comes by way of Lynn Varley and her brothers... It was a way that they spoke in their neighborhood in Livonia, Michigan. It's simply a reverse way of speaking in patterns.'\\" Unlike the first and second Robins mentioned in the story, Kelley is not an orphan, but she appears to have rather ignorant and neglectful parents who are never actually seen‚Äîone of them mutters \\"Didn't we have a kid?\\" while their daughter is witnessing the fierce battle between Batman and the street gangs known as the Mutants. It is hinted through their dialogue that they were once activists and possibly hippies during the 1960s, but have since become apathetic stoners. In the series, the government's banning of superhero activities and Jason Todd's death had led to the Dark Knight's retirement, but Batman accepts her as Robin when she saves his life just as he is on the verge of being killed by the Mutant Leader by jumping on him from behind and tearing at his eyes. She practically drags him back to the Batmobile and makes a sling for his arm out of part of her cape and a piece of pipe. He often threatens to fire her but she shows considerable ability and improvisation which impresses him enough to give her a stay of dismissal even when she disobeys his orders. The police, now led by newly-appointed Commissioner Ellen Yindel, takes a very poor attitude to Batman and his methods and issues a warrant for his arrest. When she sees Batman with Kelley leaping in mid-air and barely catching a passing hang-glider, Yindel adds child endangerment to the growing list of charges against Batman. As Robin, Carrie plays a crucial part in tracking down and confronting the Joker who (at a fairground) has poisoned several children and planted a bomb on a roller coaster. While Batman goes after his age-old nemesis, Carrie manages to dispose of the bomb but gets into a tangle with Fat Abner, Joker's accomplice. As they grapple together, Abner is decapitated by an overhanging section of the track, driving Carrie momentarily into shock and tears, but recovering enough to rescue a seriously injured Batman from capture by the police and help heal his wounds with Alfred Pennyworth. Unnerved by Batman's activities, the United States government sends Superman to bring the Dark Knight down. As the big battle is about to start, Carrie delays Superman's arrival using the tank-like Bat-mobile and a slingshot, to which the Man of Steel simply replies \\"Isn't tonight a school night?\\" Using a variety of powerful weapons, including self-made kryptonite, Batman manages to defeat Superman but \\"dies\\" in the process. It later emerges that he had faked his own death and Carrie unearthed Batman from his grave soon after he revived. They then go underground to the Batcave where, with Green Arrow, they set about training various teenage street gangs into an army in preparation to deal with people \\"worse than thieves and murderers.\\" ===The Dark Knight Strikes Again=== Carrie Kelley as Catgirl Three years later, Kelley has begun calling herself \\"Catgirl\\". She still remains Batman's able second-in-command. She wears a skin-tight cat costume with a leopard pattern, and is now trained extensively in combat. Her equipment includes motorised rollerskates and an arm cannon that fired batarangs. Catgirl's main duty is to oversee an army of Batboys to help save the world from a police-state dictatorship, led by Lex Luthor and Brainiac. She leads them into battle, liberating imprisoned heroes such as the Atom and Flash. However, she also causes serious injury to a Batboy who exceeded her orders by maiming and killing a couple of police officers. She beats him up and tells the others to treat him but not bother with anesthetic. Once alone, however, she breaks down in tears but is offered a comforting hand by Batman. She has been referred to as \\"The daughter [Batman] never had\\" but also as \\"jailbait\\". Carrie eventually comes into conflict with a supernatural man resembling Joker and attempts to kill the man with arrows, thermite, acid and C4. However, the man still returns to make an attempt on her life in the Batcave, turning out to be a genetically modified and now-homicidal Dick Grayson having resented her because he had been shoddily treated and dumped by Batman. Her lips are badly lacerated and several of her bones are broken in the fight. Thinking that she is about to die, she tells Batman that she loves him, with Batman later reflecting that he feels the same (Frank Miller clarified in an interview in the book Batman through the Ages that Batman saw Carrie as a daughter, meaning Carrie most likely saw Batman as a father figure). Batman, however, arrives and stalls Grayson long enough for Ralph Dibny to get Carrie to safety. It was noted that Carrie was developing feelings for Atom. ===The Dark Knight III: The Master Race=== Three years after being missing, Batman makes some appearances in Gotham for the first time. After a confrontation with the GCPD and Commissioner Yindel, Batman is apprehended and unmasked revealing it is Carrie Kelley under the cowl. She claims Bruce Wayne is dead. Later, Kelley tells Yindel the story about Batman passing on his bed after being beaten by a villain. While being transferred to Blackgate prison, Kelley remotely activates a tank that attacks the convoy and helps her escape, then she reunites with Wayne at the Batcave. Kelley and Wayne see the news on the Kandorians, led by Quar, giving mankind three days to surrender to their demands and accept them as gods. Bruce and Carrie go to the Fortress of Solitude and wakes Superman, who has been sitting and covered by ice for three years, up. Carrie reunites with the Bat Boys Army while Batman and Superman defy Quar. After being defeated by Lara, Superman is encased in black matter by Quar, who turns to Gotham and demands them for Batman to be handed over to him or face obliteration. Bruce presents Carrie, as a \\"graduation present\\", a green and purple Batgirl outfit and sends her on a mission to engage Aquaman‚Äôs help to find and free Superman. After the Kryptonians are defeated, Carrie is attacked by Baal. She defends herself and using a slingshot and a small kryptonite rock she disfigures Baal‚Äôs face. Lara confronts Carrie and it‚Äôs about to kill her when Diana stops her. Carrie witness the fight between Diana and Lara, impressed by the power both of them show. Later, Batgirl finds out that Batman was killed by Quar before escaping. She talks to Yindel at the destroyed batsignal and tells her to get a new one to stay in touch. While discussing with The Flash in the Batcave, a younger Bruce comes back after being immersed by Superman in the Lazarus Pit. While following a lead on a crime, Commissioner Yindel is captured by Bruno and the Jokers but is saved by Batman and Batgirl. They then head to the desert where the Kryptonians are joining forces again and use a band of bats to confuse them, causing to disparately attack themselves, the rest are eliminated by the four remaining Quar‚Äôs children. Superman, Batman and Batgirl then attack them but they go nuclear and are about to explode when The Atom appears and reduces them in size so the explosions are insignificant. Two months later Superman is nowhere to be found and Bruce wonders where he could be. Carrie shows up with a new black suit and formally becomes Batwoman. === The New 52 === In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Carrie Kelley makes her first appearance in Batman and Robin #19 (titled Batman and Red Robin). She is a college student and Damian Wayne's acting instructor. As a homage to The Dark Knight Returns, she wears a Robin costume as a Halloween costume on her first appearance. === DC Rebirth === In Batman Annual #2, in a world where Batman and Catwoman have grown old together, Carrie is among those of the Bat family standing by Bruce's bedside as he dies. ==Other versions== *In The Batman & Robin Adventures #6, a tabloid spreads the rumor that Batman is seeking a new partner to serve as Robin, resulting in several imitators donning the Robin costume and taking to the streets in attempts to impress Batman. Among them is a redheaded female who uses a small bomb to interrupt a meeting between Batman, Robin, Commissioner Gordon and Detective Bullock, and announces her name as Carrie. Bullock arrests her, but she is released from jail due to her city councilman father. Carrie tails Batman for the rest of the issue, continually causing problems with the kidnapper of another Robin pretender who expects a solitary meeting with Batman.The Batman & Robin Adventures #6 * Carrie Kelley appears in the Ame-Comi Girls books as the Robin of that universe. In this continuity, she is the cousin of Barbara Gordon to whom she acts as a sidekick.Ame-Comi Batgirl #1 When Batgirl is kidnapped by Duela Dent, Carrie enlists the aid of Steel and the Flash in order to help rescue Batgirl.Ame-Comi Duela Dent #2 *In Batman: The Brave and the Bold #13, the Phantom Stranger summons all of the Robins, including Carrie, Stephanie Brown, Nightwing, Tim Drake, Damian Wayne, and Jason Todd to save Batman. Throughout the issue, she constantly uses slang words from The Dark Knight Returns, like \\"shiv\\", or \\"billy.\\" Nightwing notes that Carrie may not have as much physical strength as the other Robins, but she makes up for it in enthusiasm and attitude. ==In other mediaTelevision=== * Carrie Kelley makes her animated debut in The New Batman Adventures episode \\"Legends of the Dark Knight\\", voiced by Anndi McAfee. She is a young girl in the present time that describes what she (as Robin) envisions Batman as being like. * The Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"The Knights of Tomorrow\\" features a futuristic version of Batman (Damian Wayne) seen ready to bring down a group of Mutants with his own son (voiced by Sebastian Bader) that slightly resembles the Carrie Kelley version of Robin. * The Carrie Kelley version of Robin appears in the Teen Titans Go! episode \\"The Best Robin\\", voiced by Scott Menville. She is part of a team of Robins that eventually becomes consumed by competition to determine which Robin is the best one. * In the Unikitty! episode BatKitty, Dr. Fox dresses up as \\"Girl Robin\\" which is similar to Carrie Kelley. ===Film=== * Carrie Kelley was confirmed to appear in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice by director Zack Snyder via his personal Vero social network account, played by an uncredited actress. Jena Malone was rumored to be portraying Kelley, this was later revealed not to be the case as Malone ended up playing Jenet Klyburn in the film's Ultimate Edition. Malone was also rumored for the role of Barbara Gordon. In the Ultimate Edition home release of the film, a red haired young woman with distinctive goggles appears during the \\"Knightmare\\" dream sequence, helping Batman battle an enemy army of Parademons, until she is killed. Director Snyder also confirmed she was Batman's sidekick Carrie in that dream sequence and would have been so if the dystopic, possible alternate reality of the DC Extended Universe continuity depicted in said scene had come to pass. * The Carrie Kelley version of Robin appears in the two-part animated adaptation of Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, voiced by Ariel Winter. * The Dick Grayson version of Robin in The Lego Batman Movie is visually based on the Carrie Kelley and Tim Drake versions of Robin, with their suits being visible within Batman's Batcave. ===Miscellaneous=== *Carrie Kelley/Robin appears in a one-page article in Comics Collector #8 (Krause Publications, Summer 1985), predating her first comic book appearance. ==References== Category:Comics characters introduced in 1986 Category:DC Comics female superheroes Category:DC Comics superheroes Category:DC Comics martial artists Category:Fictional inventors Category:Characters created by Frank Miller Category:Teenage characters in comics Category:Robin (character) ","title":"Carrie Kelley"},{"id":"2201379","text":"Anthony Ashley-Cooper may refer to: *Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury (1621‚Äì1683), English nobleman *Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 2nd Earl of Shaftesbury (1652‚Äì1699), English nobleman *Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury (1671‚Äì1713), English nobleman and philosopher *Anthony Ashley Cooper, 4th Earl of Shaftesbury (1711‚Äì1771), English nobleman *Anthony Ashley- Cooper, 5th Earl of Shaftesbury (1761‚Äì1811), English nobleman *Anthony Ashley- Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury (1801‚Äì1885), English nobleman *Anthony Ashley- Cooper, 8th Earl of Shaftesbury (1831‚Äì1886), English nobleman *Anthony Ashley- Cooper, 9th Earl of Shaftesbury (1869‚Äì1961), English nobleman *Anthony Ashley- Cooper, 10th Earl of Shaftesbury (1938‚Äì2004), English nobleman *Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 11th Earl of Shaftesbury (1977‚Äì2005), English nobleman *Anthony Henry Ashley-Cooper (1807‚Äì1858), MP for Dorchester *Anthony Ashley-Cooper, Lord Ashley (1900‚Äì1947), British army officer ==See also== *Anthony Ashley (disambiguation) *Anthony Cooper (disambiguation) *Earl of Shaftesbury ","title":"Anthony Ashley-Cooper"},{"id":"2201393","text":"Bill Doss (September 12, 1968 ‚Äì July 30, 2012Best Fit News: Bill Doss of The Olivia Tremor Control reported dead, The Line Of Best Fit, 31.07.2012) was an American rock musician. He co-founded The Elephant 6 Recording Company in Athens, Georgia and was a key member of The Olivia Tremor Control.

Before the Olivia Tremor Control, Doss had spent some time in the army, after which he joined New York based band Chocolate USA before returning to Athens, Georgia, where he was a resident at the time of his death. ==Olivia Tremor Control== Doss, Hart and Mangum soon formed what was later to become the Olivia Tremor Control. After Mangum left the band to pursue his own Neutral Milk Hotel, Hart and Doss began to pool their musical influences, Hart being a proponent of experimentalism, Doss of 60's pop such as The Beatles, the Beach Boys and The Zombies. After the release of the second The Olivia Tremor Control album, Black Foliage, the band broke up in 2000. ==Post-Olivia Tremor Control== Doss went on to restart The Sunshine Fix.

At club level, he made more than 300 appearances in the Football League and the Premier League, playing for Newcastle United, Manchester City, Leicester City, Bolton Wanderers and Hartlepool United. He also played briefly for the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer. ==Club career Newcastle United === Howey started his career with Newcastle United signing a professional contract on 11 December 1989. At first he was playing in the striker position for the youth and reserve teams until Ossie Ardiles conceived the idea of moving him from the attack back into the defence. Howey was an important part of Kevin Keegan's First Division championship winning side in 1992/93, winning promotion to the Premier League. Once promoted, Howey continued to be a first- choice centre back but was often missing through injury. During Howey's time at Newcastle they were Premier League runner-up twice in 1995/96 and 1996/97 in addition to FA Cup runner-up in 1997/98 and 1998/99. Howey is still a very popular figure in Newcastle as part of a successful influx from Newcastle's youth academy which also included Steve Watson, Robbie Elliott and Lee Clark. === Man City === In August 2000 newly promoted Man City paid Newcastle ¬£2,000,000 for him. His debut came in a 4‚Äì0 defeat to Charlton setting the tone for a disappointing season which saw Man City relegated. Howey remained at Man City the following season as part of the team which secured an immediate return to the Premier League as First Division champions. One last season at Man City saw Howey contribute to a top half finish and comfortable survival. In his three seasons with Man City Howey scored 11 goals. A highlight of his time at Manchester City was scoring a late equaliser against rivals Manchester United at Old Trafford, in a game more remembered for the clash between Roy Keane and Alf-Inge H√•land. === Later career === A ¬£200,000 move to Leicester City followed however after six months Howey moved on to Bolton. Less than five months and only three appearances later Howey was released. A short spell with New England Revolution in Major League Soccer followed before a final professional appearance with Hartlepool United brought down the curtain on his sixteen-year professional career. == International career == Howey earned four caps for England, starting all four matches. He made his debut in the 1‚Äì0 win against Nigeria at Wembley Stadium in November 1994. He won caps in the draws with Colombia and Portugal in 1995 before making his final appearance in the 1‚Äì0 victory over Bulgaria in March 1996. Howey was called up to the England squad for Euro 96, and was an unused substitute in the first match against Switzerland, but was not fit enough to be on the team sheet for the remaining four matches. He was never called up to the full squad again. == Managerial career == Howey had a short, unsuccessful spell as Manager of Crook Town, taking the helm in September 2006 and resigning just two months later after a poor run of results. He followed this with a spell as a Youth Team Coach at Middlesbrough before making a playing return with National League side Bishop Auckland who he also served in a coaching capacity. Steve Howey become a coach at East Durham College Football Development Centre in 2007 and become Head Coach in 2010. == Personal life == Howey co-presented Total Sport on BBC Newcastle with Marco Gabbiadini and Simon Pryde.

From 1926 to 1930 he studied composition in Vienna with Paul Amadeus Pisk and afterwards began to attract international attention with works which were performed at the ISCM Festivals or awarded prizes . Nevertheless, from 1935 to 1938 he underwent a second period of study, as a pupil of Anton Webern. He may be regarded as a representative of the so-called Second Viennese School. In 1939 Spinner emigrated to England and spent the war years in Yorkshire, working part of the time as a lathe operator in a locomotive factory in Bradford. From 1947 he worked as a music-copyist and arranger for Boosey & Hawkes , moving to London in 1954. In 1958 he succeeded Erwin Stein as editor at Boosey & Hawkes, later becoming Chief Editor . He remained with Boosey & Hawkes until his retirement in 1975. His skills and exactitude were highly praised by Stravinsky. ==Compositions== From 1926 to his death in London in 1980 Spinner steadily and painstakingly built up an individual body of work , adapting and renewing classical forms along the lines (but eventually, much further) that had been indicated by his teacher Webern. They include an early Symphony for small orchestra (1933), an Ouvert√ºre in honour of Schoenberg's 70th birthday (1944), a Piano Concerto (1947, later revised as a Concerto for piano with chamber orchestra), a Violin Concerto (1953‚Äì55, though this remained in pencil score), Prelude and Variations dedicated to Stravinsky (1962), Ricercata for orchestra (1965), Cantatas on poems of Nietzsche (1951) and on German folksong texts (1964), string quartets, trios, works for violin and piano, solo piano pieces, several sets of songs and some arrangements of Irish folksongs. His last work was a Chamber Symphony (1977‚Äì79). ==Technique== Almost all Spinner's music was written according to the twelve-tone technique (on which he also wrote a significant textbook, A Short Introduction to the Technique of Twelve-tone Composition, published 1960). His early works, up to and including the Zwei kleine St√ºcke, are clearly influenced by Berg and middle-period Schoenberg. From the mid-1930s the general idiom, expressive intensity, dramatic economy and impeccable craftsmanship bear witness to his admiration for his teacher Webern ‚Äì and, through Webern, for the whole Austro-German tradition from Bach onwards. Spinner himself carried that tradition a stage further. While retaining the purity and thematically essentialized textures of Webern, his works show a concern for larger and bolder gestures than Webern's norm. In his later music, beginning with the sonatina for piano, the expressive pressure applied to strict motivic working results in a wholly individual style of almost explosive force. ==References== * * ==Further reading== * * , English translation of the introduction to Busch 1987. * List of √©migr√© composers in Britain ==External links== *Radio broadcast of Chamber Symphony, Op. 28, Ensemble Modern, directed by Michael Gielen.

He was a founding member of German/English avant-pop band Slapp Happy, which later merged briefly with Henry Cow, and has released many solo and collaborative albums. He is the son of Lenore and Erik Blegvad, who were respectively, a children's book author and illustrator. ==Biography== Peter Blegvad's life began in America ‚Äì he was born in New York City and originally raised in Connecticut. When he was 14, the Blegvad family moved to England in 1965, unhappy with the social climate of America following the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the threat posed by the Vietnam draft to Peter and his younger brother Kristoffer. Blegvad was educated at St Christopher School, Letchworth, a boarding school where he met his musical collaborator Anthony Moore. Moore and Blegvad played in various bands during their schooldays, alongside fellow musicians such as Neil Murray (then a drummer, later a well-known hard rock bass guitarist). In 1972, Blegvad followed the itinerant Moore to Hamburg, Germany, where the two formed the avant-pop trio Slapp Happy with Dagmar Krause,Cutler 2009, vol. 1‚Äì5, p. 21,40. Slapp Happy recorded two albums for Polydor Germany with krautrock group Faust as their backing band. Polydor released the first, Sort Of in 1972, but rejected the second, Casablanca Moon. This rejection prompted Slapp Happy to relocate to London where they signed up with Virgin Records and re-recorded Casablanca Moon, released in 1974 by Virgin as Slapp Happy. (The original Casablanca Moon was later released by Recommended Records as Acnalbasac Noom in 1980.) In 1974 Slapp Happy merged briefly with avant-rock group Henry Cow, recording two albums in 1975, Desperate Straights and In Praise of Learning. Shortly after recording In Praise of Learning, first Moore and then Blegvad left Henry Cow due to incompatibilities with the other musicians in the group. Blegvad has confessed that the technical demands of Henry Cow's music were beyond him (\\"It was discovered ‚Äì not to my surprise ‚Äì that I actually couldn't play Henry Cow music. The chords and the time signatures were too complicated. And... just generally, Anthony and I felt kinda lost...\\") but it was also clear that there were crucial differences in artistic approach. Blegvad would later reveal (in an interview for the Hearsay fanzine) that \\"the piece that got me kicked out was \\"Living in the Heart of the Beast\\". I was assigned the task for the collective to come up with suitable verbals, and I wrote two verses about a woman throwing raisins at a pile of bones. Tim Hodgkinson just said, I'm sorry, this is not at all what we want. And he wrote reams of this political tirade. I admired his passion and application but it left me cold. I am to my bones a flippant individual, I don't know why I was created thus or what I'm trying to deny, but it clashed with the extreme seriousness. People who take themselves very seriously make me giggle, unless they're pointing a weapon at me or my loved ones\\". Due to Krause's decision to remain with Henry Cow, Slapp Happy dissolved and the three members went their separate ways (although the group would periodically reunite in 1982, 1991, 1997, 2000 and 2016‚Äì17). Blegvad returned to New York to work as a cartoonist, but maintained his interest in music. In 1977 he reunited with Henry Cow bass player John Greaves to collaborate on the album Kew. Rhone. ‚Äì an unusual cross-genre release combining elements of minimalism, avant-garde jazz and progressive rock. The album was also notable for its personnel, which included celebrated New York jazz musicians Carla Bley, Michael Mantler, and Andrew Cyrille among the performers. As a musical document Kew. Rhone. remains both ambitious and unclassifiable; Blegvad's literate and playful lyrics are well-matched by Greaves' complex song structures. Blegvad would later continue his collaboration with Greaves in 1995 on Unearthed, a collection of spoken word pieces set to Greaves' music. In the 1980s, Blegvad released a number of commercially unsuccessful albums on the Virgin Records label, including The Naked Shakespeare and Knights Like This, both of which show the influence of external producers. By contrast, Downtime, an independent release in the late 1980s features mainly very simple demos, often recorded cheaply in professional studios' \\"downtime\\". King Strut and Other Stories (Silvertone, 1990) is a collection of short stories set to simply arranged, professionally produced music played in many cases by noted session musicians. The album features XTC's Andy Partridge while Orpheus ‚Äì The Lowdown (2003) is a whole album in collaboration with Partridge. Many of Blegvad's albums feature former members of Slapp Happy and Henry Cow. Blegvad is a deft and literate lyricist whose lyrics frequently feature word games, literary references and complex and extended rhyme schemes. From 1992 to 1999, The Independent ran Blegvad's strangely surreal comic strip, Leviathan, which received much critical praise for blending some of the most interesting elements of Krazy Kat with a coming- of-age-esque story akin to Calvin and Hobbes. Some of the strips have been collected in the 2001 volume The Book of Leviathan. In 2013 the book was published as Le livre de Leviathan in French and received the \\"Prix R√©v√©lation\\" at the 41st Angoul√™me International Comics Festival in 2014. Other comics and illustrations by Blegvad have appeared in The Ganzfeld and Ben Katchor's Picture Story 2. He has also conducted two- and three-week writing courses at Warwick University, England, in association with the National Academy for Gifted and Talented Youth (NAGTY), and the new University of Warwick venture for gifted and creative children, International Gateway for Gifted Youth (IGGY). In 2011, Atlas Publishing (trading as \\"The London Institute of 'Pataphysics\\") published Blegvad's The Bleaching Stream, described as an \\"interview format biography.\\" Blegvad performing with Slapp Happy in Tokyo, February 24, 2017 Blegvad's work for BBC Radio 3 includes numerous \\"eartoons\\" for the weekly poetry strand The Verb, and a number of radiophonic dramas with Langham Research Centre and with Iain Chambers. These include guest+host=ghost, featuring Nick Cave; Use It Or Lose It which won a Radio Academy Award in 2012; Chinoiserie; Eschatology, starring Harriet Walter and Guy Paul; and The Impossible Book (2016). His 2015 drama with Iain Chambers for Radio Australia, The Eternal Moment starring John Ramm and Emma Powell, was shortlisted for the 2015 Prix Europa. Krause, Moore and Blegvad reformed Slapp Happy in November 2016 to perform with Faust at the Week-End festival in Cologne, Germany. The two groups also played together on February 10‚Äì11, 2017 at Cafe Oto in London. On February 24, 2017 Slapp Happy, without Faust, performed at Mt.

It is defined as the mass of many particles of the material divided by the total volume they occupy. The total volume includes particle volume, inter-particle void volume, and internal pore volume.Page 50 in Bulk density is not an intrinsic property of a material; it can change depending on how the material is handled. For example, a powder poured into a cylinder will have a particular bulk density; if the cylinder is disturbed, the powder particles will move and usually settle closer together, resulting in a higher bulk density. For this reason, the bulk density of powders is usually reported both as \\"freely settled\\" (or \\"poured\\" density) and \\"tapped\\" density (where the tapped density refers to the bulk density of the powder after a specified compaction process, usually involving vibration of the container.) ==Soil== The bulk density of soil depends greatly on the mineral make up of soil and the degree of compaction. The density of quartz is around 2.65 g/cm¬≥ but the (dry) bulk density of a mineral soil is normally about half that density, between 1.0 and 1.6 g/cm¬≥. In contrast, soils rich in soil organic carbon and some friable clays tend to have lower bulk densities (<1.0 g/cm¬≥) due to a combination of the low-density of the organic materials themselves and increased porosity. For instance, peat soils have bulk densities from 0.02 g/cm¬≥ to 0.98 g/cm¬≥. Bulk density of soil is usually determined from a core sample which is taken by driving a metal corer into the soil at the desired depth and horizon.USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service \\"Soil quality indicators -- Bulk density\\" retrieved December 5, 2013 This gives a soil sample of known total volume, V_t. From this sample the wet bulk density and the dry bulk density can be determined.Argonne National Lab \\"RESRAD Data collection handbook, chapter 2 -- Soil density\\" retrieved May 26, 2012 For the wet bulk density (total bulk density) this sample is weighed, giving the mass M_t. For the dry bulk density, the sample is oven dried and weighed, giving the mass of soil solids, M_s. The relationship between these two masses is M_t = M_s + M_l, where M_l is the mass of substances lost on oven drying (often, mostly water). The dry and wet bulk densities are calculated as Dry bulk density = mass of soil/ volume as a whole :\\\\rho_b = \\\\frac{M_s}{V_t} Wet bulk density = mass of soil plus liquids/ volume as a whole :\\\\rho_t = \\\\frac{M_t}{V_t} The dry bulk density of a soil is inversely related to the porosity of the same soil: the more pore space in a soil the lower the value for bulk density. Bulk density of a region in the interior of the earth is also related to the seismic velocity of waves travelling through it: for P-waves, this has been quantified with Gardner's relation. The higher the density, the faster the velocity. ==See also== * Brazil nut effect * Characterisation of pore space in soil * Effective porosity * Particle density * Porosity * Density meter * Number density ==Notes== ==External links== * University of Leicester podcast 'How to measure dry bulk density' * Bulk density calculator * 'Determination of bulk density' Category:Density Category:Particulates Category:Soil physics ","title":"Bulk density"},{"id":"2201420","text":"Jonathan Schwartz (born June 28, 1938) is an American radio personality, known for his devotion to traditional pop standards. From the 1960s on, he has been a presence on radio stations in the New York radio market, until he was fired in December 2017. Additionally, Schwartz sometimes performs as a singer and has recorded numerous selections from the collection of popular music from the 1920s, '30s, '40s, and '50s known as the Great American Songbook. Schwartz has also written novels, short stories, and a memoir, All In Good Time (2004). ==Early life== Schwartz was born in New York City, the son of composer Arthur Schwartz (1900‚Äì1984) and 1930s Broadway ing√©nue Kay Carrington.*\\"Frankie and Jonathan\\" ‚Äì All in Good Time review by James Gavin, The New York Times, March 7, 2004 Though his memoirs describe an unhappy childhood, Schwartz grew up animated by a passionate interest in musical arts. His father was a composer of Broadway and film scores (\\"Dancing in the Dark\\" and \\"That's Entertainment!\\" are among his works), and from an early age Schwartz developed his interest through this family perspective. Jonathan's half-brother Paul Schwartz (born 1956) is a composer, conductor, pianist, and producer. ==Radio career== Schwartz worked at New York's WNEW-FM from 1967 to 1976, followed by stints at WNEW, WQEW and, between 1999 and 2017, WNYC-FM. Schwartz also served as programming director for XM Satellite Radio Frank‚Äôs Place, named in honor of Frank Sinatra. Following XM‚Äôs merger with Sirius, the name was changed to High Standards channel from 2001 to 2008, and appeared on Sirius XM's Siriusly Sinatra and '40s on 4 channels from 2008 to 2013. Schwartz is best known for The Jonathan Schwartz Show, which aired Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons on WNYC-FM, and was about half talk and half an eclectic mix of music.The Jonathan Schwartz Show, WNYC In his talk during the shows, Schwartz would hold extended monologues concerning famous pop songwriters and singers, and jazz artists. His music selections incorporated pop jazz, pop standards, big band and Broadway show tunes, augmented by music of nearly any popular style that has influenced twentieth century American tastes. His playlists reflected the \\"Great American Songbook\\" or, as Schwartz described it, \\"America's classical music\\". Traditionally, Schwartz opened each broadcast with the same secret snippet of music which he had always refused to identify until 2014, at a show at the Brooklyn Academy of Music: slightly more than a minute of \\"a lilting woman's voice, wordless and yet evocative, over an acoustic guitar.\\" The voice is that of Schwartz's friend since childhood, Carly Simon; listeners had speculated that the music may have been composed by his father, but it was a joint work of his and Carly Simon's. Similarly, he closed most shows with a song from the late cabaret singer Nancy LaMott, followed by a segment from another instrumental recording by Schwartz's idol, the late Nelson Riddle, and his orchestra. Schwartz is known for his lengthy and detailed on-air stories about his interactions with famous people, most often Frank Sinatra. He also claims an encyclopedic knowledge of Sinatra, who Sinatra reported was amazed by Schwartz's knowledge of every song he had ever recorded. He champions young artists who carry on the traditions of the American Songbook, as well as reveling rapturously in the songwriters and performers of the Sinatra era. In 1986 Schwartz won a Grammy Award for Best Album Notes for The Voice - The Columbia Years 1943-1952. In 2013 WNYC launched The Jonathan Channel, a 24/7 streaming Internet radio station programmed by Schwartz and dedicated to American songs selected by him. The channel also featured live programming hosted by Schwartz, along with simulcasts and replays of his Saturday and Sunday WNYC shows. On December 6, 2017, WNYC announced that Schwartz and longtime WNYC host Leonard Lopate were being put on leave \\"pending investigations into allegations of inappropriate conduct.\\" On December 21, 2017, WNYC fired both Schwartz and Lopate, stating that \\"investigations found that each individual had violated [WNYC's] standards for providing an inclusive, appropriate, and respectful work environment\\". The station's Jonathan Channel stream was concurrently renamed American Standards, and as of 2020 is known as New Standards. On June 17, 2018, Schwartz began broadcasting on an internet radio station, The Jonathan Station, that was created for him a few months before by Bob Perry of Big Sticks Broadcasting. It is a live streaming station that presents the American Songbook twenty four hours a day with live programs with Jonathan Schwartz on Saturdays and Sundays. The long tradition of presenting a Christmas Show, something that Schwartz started in 1971 while at WNEW, continues at the new station. ==Other works== In addition to his radio work, Schwartz has performed in New York City cabaret, recorded three albums as a singer, and authored five books: * Almost Home (13 short stories), 1970 Doubleday * Distant Stations (a novel), 1979 Doubleday * The Man Who Knew Cary Grant (a novel), 1988 Random House; * A Day of Light and Shadows (about one baseball game), 2000 Akadine Press * All in Good Time (a memoir), 2004 Random House He does most of his writing in Palm Springs, California. ==Personal life== Schwartz was briefly married to the author Sara Davidson in the late 1960s. He married the journalist and Vanity Fair correspondent Marie Brenner in 1979, with whom he has one daughter. Schwartz later married Elinor Renfield, with whom he has a son. In March 2010, Schwartz married actress Zohra Lampert in New York City. At the wedding, his long-time friend Tony Bennett sang \\"I See Your Face Before Me\\", a 1937 composition by Schwartz's father and Howard Dietz. ==References== ==External links== *The Jonathan Station *The Jonathan Channel *WNEW, The World's Greatest Radio Station *WNYC-FM Radio programs *SiriusXM Radio programs - see Hosts *\\"All in Good Time: a Celebration for Jonathan Schwartz ‚Äì Saluting a Radio Man Who's One of a Kind\\" by Stephen Holden, The New York Times, July 14, 2011 *Playbill, April 11, 2011 Mervyn Rothstein * Category:1938 births Category:Living people Category:American male singers Category:American memoirists Category:American radio DJs Category:Grammy Award winners Category:Radio personalities from New York City Category:Singers from New York City Category:New York Public Radio ","title":"Jonathan Schwartz (radio personality)"},{"id":"2201424","text":"Anthony Ashley may refer to: *Sir Anthony Ashley, 1st Baronet (1551‚Äì1628), MP and clerk of the Privy Council *Evelyn Ashley (Anthony Evelyn Melbourne Ashley, 1836‚Äì1907), British author and politician ==See also== *Anthony Ashley-Cooper (disambiguation) *Ashley (name) ","title":"Anthony Ashley"},{"id":"2201428","text":"Aouelloul is an impact crater in Mauritania.

Oncocytoma can arise in a number of organs. ==Renal oncocytoma== Renal oncocytoma is thought to arise from the intercalated cells of collecting ducts of the kidney. It represents 5% to 15% of surgically resected renal neoplasms. ==Salivary gland oncocytoma== Oncocytoma of the salivary gland. This lesion presented as a lateral anterior neck mass.

The salivary gland oncocytoma is a well-circumscribed, benign neoplastic growth also called an oxyphilic adenoma. It comprises about 1% of all salivary gland tumors. The histopathology is marked by sheets of large swollen polyhedral epithelial oncocytes, which are granular acidophilic parotid cells with centrally located nuclei.

They may be bilateral. ==Thyroid oncocytoma== Thyroid oncocytomas can be benign (adenomas) or malignant (carcinomas). Also known as H√ºrtle cell tumours. Grossly, oncocytic adenomas are encapsulated, solid nodules with a characteristic brown cut surface. The gross appearance of a minimally invasive oncocytic carcinoma is indistinguishable to that of an adenoma, while widely invasive oncocytic carcinomas are obviously invasive macroscopically and display pervasive vascular invasion with multifocal involvement of the thyroid gland. There are no reliable cytologic features which distinguish oncocytic adenomas from carcinomas and the only criterion for a diagnosis of malignancy is the identification of transcapsular or vascular invasion. ===Symptoms=== Patients with thyroid oncocytomas present with a thyroid nodule, usually with normal thyroid function. If the tumor is big or invasive, there may be other symptoms such as difficulty swallowing or talking. ==Additional images== Image:Renal oncocytoma3.jpgMicrograph of a renal oncocytoma. H&E; stain.

Created by Fabian Nicieza and Mark Bagley, he debuted in Heroes Reborn: Young Allies #1 (Jan. 2000). Born to hippies, Elric was a normal child, until government agents paid his parents to let them give him special \\"tests\\" (which were attempts to fuse his DNA with the DNA of the equine aliens known as the Kymellians). The tests were successful, and young Elric changed into a strange, bipedal horse-like creature. Hearing stories of the wild west, Elric assumed the identity of Kid Colt, and began to use his newfound powers to help those in need. He was eventually recruited by the Young Allies to help them free two alien beings. Elric decided to remain with the team. Elric is a hybrid of human and Kymellian. Due to his alien DNA, he can shapeshift into a humanoid horse, and teleport short distances. He can store items in sub-space \\"closets\\", pockets of extra-dimensional space which can hold items as large as a human being until Elric needs them. By creating multiple pockets which are linked together, Elric can run through them, and seem to rapidly blink in-and-out of existence. When he is not in his horse form, Elric wears a cowboy-themed costume in homage to the original Kid Colt.

She was outfitted with heavy guns and assigned to the Union blockade of the waterways of the Confederate States of America. She was the first U.S. Navy ship to be named Kansas and was the first of a class of 836-ton screw steam gunboats. At war's end, she continued serving her country by performing survey work and defending American interests in Cuba until sold in 1883. == Commissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania == Kansas was built at Philadelphia Navy Yard with machinery taken from the cargo of prize steamer Princess Royal. She was launched 29 September 1863; sponsored by Miss Annie McClellan; and commissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 21 December 1863, Lieutenant Commander Pendleton G. Watmough in command. ==Civil War service Assigned to the North Atlantic blockade === On the day of her commissioning, the gunboat was ordered to Hampton Roads, Virginia, to join the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. She arrived Newport News, Virginia, 30 December; but engine and boiler trouble required her to return to the Washington Navy Yard for repairs. In March 1864 the gunboat was stationed at Wilmington, North Carolina, off New Inlet, where she served during most of the remainder of the war. With Mount Vernon, Howquah, and Nansemond, she engaged Confederate ironclad-ram Raleigh, (Flag Officer William Lynch) which had steamed over the bar at New Inlet 6 May to attack the Northern blockaders. The withering fire from the Union ships caused Raleigh to withdraw toward safety within the harbor, but she grounded and broke her back while attempting to cross the bar at the mouth of the Cape Fear River. After strenuous efforts to save the stricken vessel proved fruitless, she was destroyed to prevent her falling into Union hands. === Capturing blockade runners === Shortly before dawn 15 May, Kansas ended a two-hour chase by capturing British steamer Tristram Shandy as the blockade runner attempted to escape to sea with a cargo of cotton, tobacco, and turpentine. The next day the proud gunboat towed her prize into Beaufort, North Carolina. On her return passage she brought Colonel James Jourdan to reconnoiter Confederate defenses at Fort Fisher in preparation for future attacks. Throughout the night of 27‚Äì28 May, Kansas chased a blockade-running steamer which finally escaped. That morning boiler trouble prevented her getting underway to chase another steamer which dashed out from Wilmington, North Carolina. After remaining on blockade duty at New Inlet until August, the gunboat returned to Philadelphia for repairs. Kansas rejoined her squadron late in September; and, after briefly cruising at sea, she returned to her old station off New Inlet in mid-October. There she chased and headed off steamer Annie trying to slip out of New Inlet with a cargo of cotton. This action 31 October enabled Wilderness and Niphon to capture the chase a short time later. On 7 December, while Admiral David Dixon Porter and General Benjamin F. Butler planned joint operations against Wilmington to close that vital Confederate port once and for all, Kansas was one of the Union gunboats which were making blockade-running in that quarter hazardous. That day they forced steamer Stormy Petrel ashore where she was abandoned by her crew and, a few days later, destroyed by a gale. === Supporting the attack on Fort Fisher === At daylight Christmas Eve, Kansas was part of the huge fleet which formed in line of battle before Fort Fisher and pounded the formidable Confederate works with a furious bombardment. Although the cannonade drove the staunch Southern defenders from their guns to shelter in bombproofs, transports carrying the Union soldiers did not arrive from Beaufort until too late to launch the assault that day. The next morning, the ships again opened fire on the forts and maintained the bombardment while troops landed near Flag Pond Battery, north of the main defensive works. Some 2,000 men established a beachhead under the protection of naval gunfire which kept the Confederate garrison pinned down and away from their guns. Late that afternoon, supported by heavy fire from the Union ships, Union Army skirmishers advanced to within yards of the fort. Lt. Aeneas Armstrong of the Confederate Navy later described the effectiveness of the bombardment: > The whole of the interior of the fort, which consists of sand, merlons, > etc., was as one 11 inch shell bursting. You can not inspect the works and > walk on nothing but iron. However, General Butler, considering the works too strong to be carried by assault with the troops available, aborted the operation by ordering his troops to re-embark. Undaunted by this setback, the Navy was not to be denied. At Porter's request Grant sent him a new commander. Kansas was one of some five dozen ships which Porter sent against Fort Fisher 13 January 1865. A naval landing party of 2.000 sailors and marines reinforced 8.000 soldiers under Major General Alfred H. Terry. The ensuing onslaught was a classic example of complete Army-Navy coordination. New Ironsides led three monitors to within 1,000 yards of Fort Fisher and opened on its batteries. Meanwhile, Kansas and the other wooden warships formed in line of battle in close order and shelled Flag Pond Battery and the adjacent woods at 0715. Half an hour later they sent in boats to assist in disembarking the landing party which went ashore out of range of the fort's guns. Once the beachhead had been established, Kansas stood toward Fort Fisher to join in the bombardment of the main Confederate works. She continued the bombardment intermittently for the next 2 days. Shortly before noon 15 January, her launch went ashore with 20 men to join the naval brigade for the final push. The gunboat maintained heavy fire during the following hours while soldiers, sailors, and marines braved the deadly fire of the stouthearted Southern defenders. Finally, at 2200, loud cheering and illumination of the fleet announced the fall of the forts. === Supporting General Grant's forces === After cleanup operations in the Wilmington area, Kansas moved to the James River late in February to support General Grant's final drive to Richmond, Virginia. From time to time during the closing weeks of the war, Kansas supported Union Army operations ashore with her guns, particularly near Petersburg, Virginia. The day after General Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House, the gunboat was ordered to a station off Cape Henry to prevent the escape of Confederate sympathizers who were reportedly planning to capture vessels in the bay. == Post-war operations  South Atlantic voyage=== Kansas entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard 23 April and decommissioned 4 May. She recommissioned 28 July, Lt. Cmdr. Clark H. Wells in command, and departed Philadelphia 5 August to begin a 4-year voyage in the South Atlantic Ocean which took her to Cape Town, Africa, as well as to many ports in the Caribbean and South America. In January 1869, she ran aground at Valpara√≠so, Chile. This long and interesting deployment ended 15 September 1869, when the gunboat arrived Washington Navy Yard, where she decommissioned a week later. === Post-war surveying operations === After a year in ordinary at Washington, D.C., she recommissioned 26 September 1870, Lt. Cmdr. Norman H. Farquhar in command. She stood down the Potomac River 10 October and arrived Hampton Roads 3 days later to join Mayflower for the Tehuantepec surveying-expedition sent to southern Mexico to determine the feasibility of constructing an inter-oceanic canal across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec which separates the Gulf of Mexico from the Pacific Ocean. The ships sailed via Key West for Vera Cruz 14 October. The expedition carefully surveyed the narrow neck of land and recorded invaluable scientific information making \\"many calculations to prove that a ship-canal across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec is not only practicable, but that the obstacles in the way of the canal route are of the most ordinary nature.\\" When she returned to Washington 15 June 1871, her crew was seriously debilitated by fever contracted in the tropics. As a result, she was ordered to the North Atlantic to join a special squadron under Vice Admiral Stephen Rowen at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. She stood in to Staten Island 10 October to participate in the reception given the Russian Fleet. She departed New York Harbor 29 November for Cuba and arrived Havana, Cuba, in December. The gunboat left that port 25 February 1872 to obtain supplies and await Comdr. A. F. Grossman who headed another Nicaragua-surveying expedition. Comdr. A. F. Grossman (ref. states 'Crosman') and others were drowned near Greytown, Nicaragua, 12 April 1872, and by personal exertion, seaman Austin Denham, chief quarter gunner George Hill, seaman John Johnson, boatswain's mate John O'Neal, seaman Richard Pile, and seaman James Smith prevented greater loss of life, for which they each earned the Medal of Honor. Kansas was employed gathering data on potential inter-oceanic canal routes until returning to Key West, Florida, on 13 July. Kansas departed Key West 6 August to determine positions for a submarine cable between Key West and Havana and returned a week later. She departed Key West 21 August and arrived Halifax, Nova Scotia, 5 September. She stood out of Halifax 17 September and arrived New York City 21 November after visiting Salem, Massachusetts, and Newport, Rhode Island, en route. She got underway for another surveying expedition of Central America 1 January 1873, which ended when she returned to Key West 15 July. === Defending American interests in Cuba === In November Spanish authorities in Cuba seized arms-running ship Virginius, illegally flying the American flag on the high seas, and summarily shot 53 of her passengers and crew. On hearing of this incident, Wyoming sailed without orders to Santiago, Cuba, and entered a vigorous protest. Kansas stood out of New York on 14 November to assist Wyoming in representing the nation's interests. After battling severe weather, she arrived Santiago, Cuba, 2 December. As a host of other warships from the U.S. Navy's North Atlantic, South Atlantic, and European squadrons converged on Cuba, the 102 survivors of Virginius were taken to New York. Kansas returned to Key West Christmas Day. In February 1874 she participated in a naval drill in Florida Bay. Her final year of active service was devoted to cruising in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, at the time a region of considerable unrest. She sailed from Pensacola, Florida 8 July 1875, and arrived Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on the 21st. ==Final decommissioning== Kansas decommissioned there 10 August 1875 and laid up until sold at Rockland, Maine, to Captain Israel L. Snow 27 September 1883. == References == == External links == * USS Kansas Category:Ships of the Union Navy Category:Ships built in Philadelphia Category:Steamships of the United States Navy Category:Gunboats of the United States Navy Category:American Civil War patrol vessels of the United States Category:United States Navy Kansas-related ships Category:1863 ships Category:Maritime incidents in January 1869 ","title":"USS Kansas (1863)"},{"id":"2201447","text":"The angle of arrival (AoA) of a signal is the direction from which the signal (e.g. radio, optical or acoustic) is received. ==Measurement== Measurement of AoA can be done by determining the direction of propagation of a radio- frequency wave incident on an antenna array or determined from maximum signal strength during antenna rotation. The AoA can be calculated by measuring the time difference of arrival (TDOA) between individual elements of the array. Generally this TDOA measurement is made by measuring the difference in received phase at each element in the antenna array. This can be thought of as beamforming in reverse. In beamforming, the signal from each element is weighed to \\"steer\\" the gain of the antenna array. In AoA, the delay of arrival at each element is measured directly and converted to an AoA measurement. Consider, for example, a two element array spaced apart by one-half the wavelength of an incoming RF wave. If a wave is incident upon the array at boresight, it will arrive at each antenna simultaneously. This will yield 0¬∞ phase-difference measured between the two antenna elements, equivalent to a 0¬∞ AoA. If a wave is incident upon the array at broadside, then a 180¬∞ phase difference will be measured between the elements, corresponding to a 90¬∞ AoA. In optics, AoA can be calculated using interferometry. ==Applications== An application of AoA is in the geolocation of cell phones. The aim is either for the cell system to report the location of a cell phone placing an emergency call or to provide a service to tell the user of the cell phone where they are. Multiple receivers on a base station would calculate the AoA of the cell phone's signal, and this information would be combined to determine the phone's location. AoA is generally used to discover the location of pirate radio stations or of any military radio transmitter. In submarine acoustics, AoA is used to localize objects with active or passive ranging. ==Limitation== Limitations on the accuracy of estimation of angle of arrival signals in digital antenna arrays are associated with jitter ADC and DAC. ==See also== * Geolocation * GNSS * GSM localization * Multilateration * Radiolocation * Time of arrival * Triangulation * Trilateration * Wideband Space Division Multiple Access ==References== Category:Angle Category:Signal processing ","title":"Angle of arrival"},{"id":"2201453","text":"In Ancient Greek grammar, the genitive absolute (Latin: genitivus absolutus) is a grammatical construction consisting of a participle and often a noun both in the genitive case, which is very similar to the ablative absolute in Latin. A genitive absolute construction serves as a dependent clause, usually at the beginning of a sentence, in which the genitive noun is the subject of the dependent clause and the participle takes on the role of predicate. The term absolute comes from the Latin absolutus, literally meaning \\"made loose\\". That comes from the general truth that the genitive absolute usually does not refer to anything in the independent clause; however, there are many exceptions, notably in the New Testament and in Koine. ==Conjunctions in different tenses== All four participle tenses are used in forming a genitive absolute. The different tenses indicate different relations in time between the independent and the dependent clause. Present participles are used when the action in the dependent clause happens simultaneously with that of the independent clause, and are therefore translated as such. Such a translated genitive absolute begins with, for example, while or as, or a phrase with with or without can be used. Aorist participles are used when the dependent clause takes place before the independent clause. Consequently instead of while and as, after and when are the conjunctions usually used in translations, or an English perfect participle (\\"having...\\") is used rather than a present one. Future participles, which are less common than their present and aorist counterparts, give information about what will or might be. A perfect participle describes the circumstances obtaining at the time of the main verb as a result of an earlier event. Apart from translations with these conjunctions, others are also frequently used while translating a genitive absolute, such as because, however, or although. ==Absolute constructions in other languages== Absolute constructions occur with other grammatical cases in Indo-European languages, such as accusative absolute, ablative absolute in Latin, dative absolute in Gothic and Old Church Slavonic, and locative absolute in Vedic Sanskrit. Compare also nominative absolute in English. An actual genitive absolute exists in German, such as klopfenden Herzens \\"(with) his/her heart beating\\", although its use is much less prominent compared to Greek (or to Latin's ablative or English's nominative in such constructions). ==Examples== Below are two examples of the genitive absolute, in different tenses. This first example shows how a genitive absolute with a present participle is used with simultaneous actions. The independent clause is \\"\\" (\\"...the women are at home by themselves\\"). The dependent clause and genitive absolute in this example is \\"\\" (\\"While the men are waging war\\"). It explains to the reader why the women are home alone and yet is additional and not required information. Note the usage of the conjunction while, indicating the two facts occurring at the same time. When translating into English, failure to render the Greek participle into a finite clause often yields a stilted or even ungrammatical result: \\"The men waging war, the women are at home...\\" is hardly acceptable. This example shows a genitive absolute with an aorist participle. The independent clause in this sentence, \\"\\", explains what happens (\\"...the slaves began to work.\\"). The genitive absolute, being \\"\\", provides the reader with additional information (\\"After the/their master had ordered (it)...\\"). Here, note the conjunction after, which indicates the two facts do not happen simultaneously, as they do with the present genitive absolute. In this case, a more direct rendition, with 'having' as an overt indicator of temporal sequence, is possible if somewhat stilted: \\"The master having ordered it, the slaves began to work.\\" The perfect participle describes a situation which was already in existence at the time of the action of the main verb, for example: The future is less often used in a genitive absolute. It is generally found after the particle () \\"in view of the fact that\\" or \\"on the grounds that\\", for example: ==References== == External links == *Katanik, blog entry explaining the genitive absolute in Ancient Greek in few easy terms. *LOY Excursus: The Genitive Absolute in the Synoptic Gospels (www.JerusalemPerspective.com) contains a complete list of the instances of the genitive absolute in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke as well as in the Septuagint's Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy).

He lives with his wife Estelle Monserrat (Catherine Lacey). He has invented a device which would allow him to control and feel another person's experience using the power of hypnosis. They decide any youngster will do as their test subject. Dr. Marcus Monserrat selects and invites Mike Roscoe (Ian Ogilvy) to his house, with an offer of a 'new experience'. He uses the device on Mike and the procedure is successful: He and Estelle can feel everything Mike feels, and can also control him. After the procedure, they decide to send Mike away to conduct the experiment over distance. Mike returns to the club where his girlfriend Nicole (Elizabeth Ercy) is waiting for him. Mike takes Nicole to his apartment, and they swim in the pool. Marcus and Estelle are able to experience everything Mike feels. While Marcus wants to publish his work, Estelle wants to make up for lost time and to experience new things. She convinces a reluctant Marcus to continue with their arrangement with Mike. Next day, Estelle sees a fur jacket in a store and convinces Marcus to use Mike to steal the jacket. Marcus reluctantly agrees on the condition that they will not do it again. While Mike is at Nicole's apartment, Estelle and Marcus make Mike steal the jacket. Mike leaves without informing Nicole, who decides to go a night club with Alan (Victor Henry). Despite a cop getting involved, Mike successfully steals the jacket. Estelle realizes that they could do anything they want without any consequences. Estelle wants to experience the thrill of speed. So Estelle and Marcus make Mike borrow Alan's bike and ride very fast with Nicole on the pillion seat. When Alan confronts Mike, Estelle makes Mike assault him and his boss, Ron (Alf Joint). Estelle enjoys the experience but Marcus is shocked. He tries to prevent the fight but Estelle's mind turns out to be stronger. When Marcus confronts Estelle, Estelle assaults Marcus and destroys the experimental device, thereby preventing Marcus from reversing the experiment. Mike blanks out every time Estelle and Marcus control him. A confused Mike visits his friend Audrey (Susan George), but Estelle makes Mike kill her. Mike then goes to the night club and hooks up with pop singer Laura (Sally Sheridan). Alan and Nicole see Mike taking Laura out of the night club. The couple are dropped by a taxi in a deserted street where Mike orders Laura to sing. When she fails to follow his instructions, he kills her too. The following day, Alan tells Nicole he believes Mike might have killed the girls. Alan wants to inform the police but Nicole convinces him to talk to Mike first. The police track Mike with help of the taxi driver. Alan and Nicole confront Mike about Laura but Mike does not remember anything. Under the influence of Estelle, Mike attacks Alan again and escapes in a car. Police investigators track down Mike, and in the ensuing chase, Marcus interferes with Estelle's control. Mike's car crashes and catches fire. Back at the apartment, Estelle and Marcus are both dead due to burn injuries. ==Cast== * Boris Karloff as Professor Marcus Monserrat * Catherine Lacey as Estelle Monserrat * Elizabeth Ercy as Nicole * Ian Ogilvy as Mike Roscoe * Victor Henry as Alan * Sally Sheridan as Laura Ladd * Alf Joint as Ron, the mechanic * Meier Tzelniker as the Jewish baker * Gerald Campion as customer in China shop * Susan George as Audrey Woods * Ivor Dean as Inspector Matalon * Peter Fraser as the detective ==Reception== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on , with a weighted average rating of 7.3/10.

Because duties on dolls were higher than those on toys, Marvel Comics subsidiary Toy Biz argued before the U.S. Court of International Trade, that their action figures (including the X-Men and Fantastic Four) represented \\"nonhuman creatures\\" and were subject to the lower tariff rates for toys instead of the higher ones for dolls. On January 3, 2003, after examining more than 60 action figures, Judge Judith Barzilay ruled in their favor, granting Toy Biz reimbursement for import taxes on previous toys. ==Reaction== Because a common theme in Marvel Comics had been the struggle for mutants like the X-Men to prove their humanity, the case shocked numerous fans. Marvel responded to these concerns by claiming \\"our heroes are living, breathing human beingsbut humans who have extraordinary abilities ... A decision that the X-Men figures indeed do have 'nonhuman' characteristics further proves our characters have special, out-of-this world powers\\".

The village has a population of 63. ==History== The parish was part of the hundred of Catsash. William Rosewell purchased the manor from Sir James FitzJames c. 1563 and it was inherited by subsequent generations: William Rosewell of Forde Abbey (1563‚Äì1593); and Sir Henry Rosewell (1593‚Äì1656). In 1634 Henry and his wife Mary (Drake) conveyed the manor to Simon Court, who before 1639 sold it to Sir Robert Gorges of Redlynch. Alford House was built in the late 18th century, but remodelled by F. C. Penrose in 1877. ==Governance== The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Wincanton Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, Trading Standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Somerton and Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

She was raised in Ghana, India (where her family moved following a diplomatic posting of her father), and her mother's native United Kingdom, where she eventually settled. Benson began playing piano and guitar and writing songs and poetry at an early age. Before pursuing a career in music, she attended the London School of Economics and gained a degree in econometrics. She continued her education studying Economics through Harvard's extension certificate program, which she did not complete due to the illness of her mother. Benson later worked at an investment bank. ==Career== Once back in the UK, she performed in small London clubs and was discovered by the Los Angeles- based record label, DKG Music. Benson moved to Los Angeles, California to record her debut album, Gold Coast, which was released in October 2003. She wrote all the songs on the album, having composed the music on guitar and keyboards, and co-produced it with producers Bob Power and James Poyser. Benson won a Mobo Award in 2005. With the help of Denmark's production duo, Jonas Rendbo and Daniel Fridell, Benson released her second album, Hands Clean, on 14 February 2011. The album redefined modern soul as Benson sang with soulful electronic backing.

There appear to be two possible derivations: The gentle enclosure from Old English ‚Äòmilde‚Äô and ‚Äòtun‚Äô (cf Upper and Lower Milton, near Wells) or The middle enclosure from the Old English ‚Äòmiddel‚Äô and ‚Äòtun‚Äô Since Milton lies between the tithings of Long Load and Witcombe, the latter seems to be more likely as it was known as ‚ÄòMiddleton‚Äô in 1284-6. Witcombe means the white valley from the Old English ‚Äòhwit‚Äô and ‚Äòcumb‚Äô. It occurs as ‚ÄòWhythicumbe‚Äô in 1243, in which case cf Withycombe (near Carhampton), the willow valley from the Old English ‚Äòwippe‚Äô and ‚Äòcumb‚Äô. It may also be ‚Äòwide valley‚Äô from Old English. The medieval settlement seems to have included two separate hamlets on the two adjacent parallel lanes. These were the centres of the two medieval manors: Ash Boulogne to the west, and Pykesash to the east. Both nuclei are characterised by an irregular group of working farms.

The Skip-It apparatus was designed to be affixed to the child's ankle via a small plastic hoop and spun around in a 360 degree rotation while continuously skipped by the user. Time magazine included it in their 100 greatest toys ever. During its initial release in the 1980s, the Skip-It apparatus became a commercial success through its advertisements on daytime Nickelodeon broadcasting as well as other children's programming. It was based on 1960s toy Lemon Twist, which featured a lemon-shaped weight which was spun round the ankle. During a second production occurring in the early 1990s‚Äîthat was referred to by the then-CEO as a \\"Skip-It Renaissance\\"‚Äîthe toy was manufactured with a counter on the Skip-It ball to record the number of skips. As a result, sales doubled from the late 1980s. Some Skip-Its had colorful glitter filled and covered plastic decorations that can be slid on in order to make colorful patterns while being twirled about. There were also ribbon streamers, charms and stickers to decorate Skip Its, which were discontinued sometime in 2009. A version of the toy was featured in the Hong Kong martial art movie Butterfly and Sword (1993) where the character Miu Siu Siu / Ho Ching is seen playing with it.

Quinnebaug was completed under contract by Neafie & Levy at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, but she is occasionally listed as a rebuilt version of the first . She was launched on 28 September 1875, but completion was delayed due to lack of government appropriations,Heinrich, Thomas R. (1997): Ships for the Seven Seas: Philadelphia Shipbuilding in the Age of Industrial Capitalism, Johns Hopkins University Press, , p. 71. and consequently the vessel did not enter commission until 2 October 1878, when Commander Norman H. Farquhar took command. ==Service history== Quinnebaug departed Philadelphia on 17 October 1878 for fitting out at Norfolk, Virginia. She got underway in January 1879 and reached Gibraltar on 2 February to begin a decade of service on the European Station, interrupted only by a brief visit home in the summer of 1881. During this service she operated for the most part in the Mediterranean, steaming from the straits to the Levant and visiting numerous ports along both the European and African coasts of that ancient sea and center of culture. She also usually made an annual cruise along the Atlantic Coast of Europe visiting ports in Spain, Portugal, France, England, Denmark and Germany. Three of her crew received the Medal of Honor for rescuing shipmates from drowning during this period: Landsman Patrick J. Kyle at Mah√≥n, Menorca, on 13 March 1879, and Seaman Apprentice Second Class August Chandron and Boatswain's Mate Hugh Miller at Alexandria, Egypt, on 21 November 1885. Departing Gibraltar on 9 May 1889, Quinnebaug returned to the New York Navy Yard on 17 June 1889. She decommissioned there on 3 July, was struck from the Navy List on 21 November 1889, and was sold on 25 March 1891. ==References== Category:Sloops of the United States Navy Category:1875 ships ","title":"USS Quinnebaug (1875)"},{"id":"2201506","text":"IDQ may refer to: * International Dairy Queen, a chain of soft serve and fast food restaurants; subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway * IDQ (TV station), in Australia * ID Quantique, a Geneva, Switzerland company which provides quantum key distribution (QKD) systems, single photon counters, and hardware random number generators ","title":"IDQ"},{"id":"2201510","text":"The Groundhogs are a British rock band founded in late 1963, that toured extensively in the 1960s, achieved prominence in the early 1970s and continued sporadically into the 21st century. Tony McPhee (guitar and vocals) is the sole constant member of the group, which has gone through many personnel changes but usually records and performs as a power trio. ==Career== The band was originally formed as The Dollar Bills in New Cross, London in 1962 by brothers Pete and John Cruickshank (born in 1943 and 1945 respectively in Calcutta, West Bengal, India). Tony McPhee (born 22 March 1944), the lead guitarist in an instrumental group called the Seneschals, joined the group later that same year. McPhee steered them towards the blues and renamed them after a John Lee Hooker song, \\"Groundhog's Blues\\". John Cruickshank suggested they became John Lee's Groundhogs when they backed John Lee Hooker on his 1964 UK tour: they later supplemented Little Walter, Jimmy Reed and Champion Jack Dupree when they toured the UK. McPhee featured on Dupree's From New Orleans to Chicago (1966) alongside Eric Clapton. The Groundhogs issued \\"Shake It\\" b/w \\"Rock Me\\" on the Interphon record label in January 1965. Their line-up on their first album, Scratchin' the Surface, (produced by the 19-year-old Head Of A&R; for Liberty Records, Mike Batt) released in November 1968, consisted of McPhee as singer and guitarist; bassist Peter Cruickshank (born 2 July 1945, in Calcutta), Ken Pustelnik on drums (born 13 March 1946 on a farm near Blairgowrie, Angus, Scotland) and Steve Rye on harmonica (born 8 March 1946 in London ‚Äì died 19 July 1992, in London). In 1969, the single \\"B.D.D.\\" (Blind Deaf Dumb) flopped in the UK but hit number one in Lebanon. The group's album releases Blues Obituary (September 1969); Thank Christ for the Bomb (May 1970); Split (March 1971); and Who Will Save the World? The Mighty Groundhogs (March 1972), recorded as a trio without Rye, all but Blues Obituary the Top 10 in the UK Albums Chart. Split reached number 5, spending 27 weeks in the UK Albums Chart and achieved gold record status, while a single release from the album, \\"Cherry Red\\", was featured on BBC Television's Top of the Pops programme on 22 April 1971. They supported The Rolling Stones on their 1971 British tour at the request of Mick Jagger and released an album of their live set on the Stones tour, recorded at Leeds University and called Live at Leeds. All these albums and live shows were performed by the classic power trio of Cruickshank, McPhee and Pustelnik. 1974's album Solid saw a last return to the charts. After breaking up in 1974, they returned in 1975 with a different line-up. Two albums, Crosscut Saw and Black Diamond, were released in 1976. At times in the 1990s, McPhee alternated two line-ups. After years of performing and recording for a loyal following, original manager Roy Fisher put together a short-lived 'original line-up' to celebrate their fortieth anniversary. McPhee left the band again to pursue an acoustic career, leaving Cruickshank and Pustelnik to continue, subsequently forming 'The Groundhogs Rhythm Section' with invited frontmen, latterly with Eddie Martin, while McPhee embarked on a major tour in 2004 with Edgar Winter and Alvin Lee and issued an acoustic blues album Blues at Ten. McPhee put together a new band in 2007, with long-time Groundhogs bassist Dave Anderson (ex-Hawkwind) and Marco Anderson on drums. This trio toured the UK in 2008 with Focus and Martin Turner's Wishbone Ash. The 2009 line-up of Tony McPhee's Groundhogs comprised McPhee, Anderson and previous long-term drummer Mick Jones. The Groundhogs Rhythm Section's latest recruits, Bob Bowles (guitar, vocals) and Jon Buckett (guitars, keyboards, vocals), joined Ken Pustelnik and Pete Cruickshank in February 2011. As of 2011, the new Groundhogs' lineup consisted of McPhee, Anderson, Joanna Deacon (vocals), and Carl Stokes (drums) from the death rock band 'Cancer'. Due to McPhee's ongoing health issues relating to a stroke in 2009, Tony McPhee & The Groundhogs retired in January 2014; although Tony McPhee and Carl Stokes have since worked with David Tibet's Current 93. ==PersonnelMembers=== ;Current members * Joanna Deacon ‚Äì vocals (2001‚Äì2003, 2011‚Äìpresent) * Tony McPhee ‚Äì guitars, vocals (1963‚Äì1974, 1976, 1982‚Äì2004, 2007‚Äìpresent) * Dave Anderson ‚Äì bass (1987‚Äì1988, 2001‚Äì2003, 2007‚Äìpresent) * Carl Stokes ‚Äì drums (2011‚Äìpresent) ;Former members * Peter Cruickshank ‚Äì bass (1963‚Äì1974, 2003‚Äì2004) * Dave Boorman ‚Äì drums (1963‚Äì1965) * Bob Hall ‚Äì keyboards (1963‚Äì1965) * John Cruickshank ‚Äì harmonica, vocals (1963‚Äì1964) * Ken Pustelnik ‚Äì drums (1965‚Äì1972, 2003‚Äì2004) * Tom Parker ‚Äì keyboards (1965) * Steve Rye ‚Äì harmonica (1969; died 1992) * Clive Brooks ‚Äì drums (1972‚Äì1974; died 2017) * Dave Thompson ‚Äì bass (1972) * Mick Cook ‚Äì drums (1976; died 1997) * Martin Kent ‚Äì bass (1976) * Dave Wellbelove ‚Äì guitars (1976) * Rick Adams ‚Äì guitars (1976) * Alan Fish ‚Äì bass (1982‚Äì1994) * Wilgar Campbell ‚Äì drums (1982‚Äì1984; died 1989) * \\"Mighty\\" Joe Young ‚Äì guitars (1982‚Äì1983) * Mick Kirkton ‚Äì drums (1984‚Äì1989) * Mick Jones ‚Äì drums (1989‚Äì1994, 2000‚Äì2003, 2009‚Äì2011) *Chris Bennett ‚Äì drums (1990‚Äì1991) * Jon Camp ‚Äì bass (1989, 2001) * Eric Chipulina ‚Äì bass, live guitars (1994‚Äì1996, 1996‚Äì2000) * Pete Correa ‚Äì drums (1994‚Äì1996, 1996‚Äì2000) * Pete Chymon ‚Äì bass (1996) * Dale Iviss ‚Äì drums (1996) * Brian Jones ‚Äì bass (2000‚Äì2001) * Marco Anderson ‚Äì drums (2007‚Äì2009) ===Lineups=== { class=\\"toccolours\\" border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 style=\\"float: width: 375px; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid #E2E2E2;\\" width=99% - !

He played in the Football League and Premier League for Nottingham Forest, Queens Park Rangers, Norwich City, Sheffield Wednesday, Reading, Southampton and Burnley. He also played in the Scottish Football League for Rangers and in Major League Soccer for the Colorado Rapids. Woods was Peter Shilton's long-time understudy in the England team in the mid to late 1980s, finally claiming the number one shirt for himself in the early 1990s. In all, he managed to accrue 43 caps in an eight- year international career. Woods has been goalkeeper coach for Everton, the United States and Manchester United. He was most recently coaching at West Ham United. ==Club careerNottingham Forest=== When 17 years old, Woods joined Nottingham Forest as an apprentice in 1976, initially as back-up for John Middleton, then Peter Shilton. With Shilton cup-tied for the 1977‚Äì78 Football League Cup, having already played for Stoke City in that season's competition, Woods played every match as Forest reached the final, where they beat Liverpool in a replay, Woods keeping two clean sheets in the process. Shilton remained the club's first choice goalkeeper, and the 1977‚Äì78 League Cup games proved to be Woods' only senior appearances for the club as they went on to win the Football League, League Cup again, and European Cup. ===Queens Park Rangers=== Queens Park Rangers paid ¬£250,000 for 19-year-old Woods in July 1979. As first choice at QPR, Woods made his Football League debut, playing 63 league games over the next two seasons. ===Norwich City=== In May 1981 Norwich signed him for ¬£225,000. In 1985 Woods won his second League Cup final, beating Sunderland 1‚Äì0 at Wembley. Norwich were relegated at the end of that season. England coach Bobby Robson took Woods on a post-season tour of America. Woods won a second division championship medal the year after. In 2002, he was voted into the club's Hall of Fame. ===Rangers=== Graeme Souness signed Woods for Rangers in the summer of 1986 for ¬£600,000. He was part of an influx of English talent brought in by Souness, which also included Terry Butcher and Graham Roberts. Woods won a Scottish Premier Division title and a Scottish League Cup medal in his first season. From November 1986 to January 1987 he set a British record by playing 1196 consecutive minutes of competitive football without conceding a goal. The run was ended at Ibrox on 31 January 1987 when Adrian Sprott scored the only goal for Hamilton Academical in the 70th minute of a Scottish Cup tie. Woods won another Scottish League Cup winners medal with Rangers in 1987‚Äì88, although rivals Celtic won a league and Scottish Cup double. Rangers regained the league title in 1989. Woods missed half the season with an infection that affected his balance and vision. Woods won further Scottish league titles in 1989‚Äì90 and 1990‚Äì91. In the 1991 close season, new Rangers manager Walter Smith replaced Woods with Scottish international Andy Goram. This signing was made in part because UEFA had introduced a rule limiting foreign players, which meant that Rangers could only field three non-Scottish players in European matches. ===Sheffield Wednesday=== In August 1991, Woods signed for Trevor Francis at Sheffield Wednesday for ¬£1.2 million. Wednesday had just won the League Cup and promotion to England's top tier. Wednesday lost the 1993 Football League Cup Final 2‚Äì1 to Arsenal. A few weeks later Woods lost in the 1993 FA Cup Final. Wednesday again played Arsenal initially drawing 1‚Äì1. Arsenal's Andy Linighan's header made them the 2‚Äì1 winner in the closing seconds of extra time. Ironically, both Linighan and Woods were former Norwich players, with defeat in both finals costing Wednesday a place in Europe for 1993‚Äì94. By the 1995‚Äì96 season Woods was out of favour at Wednesday to Kevin Pressman as first-choice goalkeeper. Woods had a short loan spell at Reading. ===Colorado Rapids and Southampton loan=== In 1996, he joined Colorado Rapids in the USA. In October 1996, Graeme Souness, now manager at Southampton, negotiated his loan from Colorado Rapids as cover for Dave Beasant, with a view to a permanent transfer. His second league appearance came in a 7‚Äì1 defeat at the hands of Everton, and in his fourth league appearance he broke his leg at Blackburn Rovers after which he returned to the US to recuperate. ===Later career=== He then returned to England for spells at Sunderland and Burnley. He retired from playing in 1998. ==International career== In the England squad Woods was once again Shilton's back-up. Woods debuted in a friendly against the USA in Los Angeles on 16 June 1985 while a Norwich City player. He was rarely left out of an England squad again over the next five years. Woods went to the 1986 World Cup in Mexico but did not play. England went out in the quarter-finals. When at Rangers Woods received his second start in his fifth cap in a 2‚Äì0 Wembley win over Yugoslavia that inched England further towards 1988 European Championships qualification. Woods came on as a substitute for Shilton twice in 1987 and started two matches: a European Championships qualifier against Turkey and a goalless draw against Scotland at Hampden Park in the Rous Cup. Two more starts followed in the subsequent season prior to the European Championships in Germany. England suffered two defeats in the opening brace of group games at the 1988 European Championships, and therefore Robson could afford to rest Shilton for the third and final group match, against the USSR, which had been rendered meaningless. Woods therefore played his first match in a competitive finals, his 13th in total, conceding three times in a 3‚Äì1 defeat. By now, another goalkeeper had emerged as a potential successor to the ageing Shilton, with QPR's David Seaman receiving a first cap in a draw against Saudi Arabia in Riyadh. However, Woods was still regarded by Robson as his primary understudy for Shilton, who had, by now, earned his 100th cap and was about to break Bobby Moore's record of 108. Also on the scene was Dave Beasant, who won two caps as a sub as Robson checked out other goalkeepers, but Woods remained Robson's first choice if ever Shilton was unable to play. As all this went on, England qualified for the 1990 World Cup in Italy.1990 FIFA World Cup: England Squad FIFA.com, Retrieved 24 January 2010 Robson chose Woods and Seaman as Shilton's understudies in the initial squad, but days before a hand injury to David Seaman forced Bobby Robson to drop Seaman and replace him with Beasant. England went to the semi-finals, where they lost on penalties to West Germany. Woods did not play in the World Cup, Robson choosing to keep Shilton in the side for his 125th and final cap for England in the third place play-off match against Italy after their semi-final defeat. Robson quit after the tournament and successor Graham Taylor instantly installed Woods as his number one. By summer 1991, Woods had accumulated 24 caps as England made steady progress through their qualification for the 1992 European Championships, unbeaten in six matches with three clean sheets and conceding only three goals. He went to the 1992 European Championships as England's first-choice keeper and kept clean sheets in his first two matches against Denmark and France. England did not score in either, so victory was crucial against hosts Sweden in the last group match. Sweden won 2‚Äì1, however, so England were eliminated and Woods had suffered major disappointment in his first (and ultimately his only) tournament as England's number-one keeper. He stayed in the side the following year as England stuttered in their qualification campaign for the 1994 World Cup. Woods conceded a crucial equaliser from a long-range shot from Kjetil Rekdal in a 1‚Äì1 home draw with Norway and an 85th-minute penalty from Peter van Vossen in a 2‚Äì2 home draw with the Netherlands. In June 1993 England lost a crucial match in Oslo against Norway. Then, after a defeat against the USA in Boston during a summer tour in 1993, Taylor dropped Woods and, after trying two other keepers, installed Seaman in the side. Woods' 43-cap international career ended where it began, with a game against the US, although he was an unused substitute for the following four internationals. ==Coaching career== Woods took up a coaching position under Walter Smith at Everton in 1998, where he was tasked with the development of the club's goalkeepers. In July 2013 Woods left Everton to take the goalkeeping coach position at Manchester United, following the same move by first team manager David Moyes. Woods retained his position when Moyes was sacked, in April 2014, but was replaced by Frans Hoek, when Moyes' permanent successor, Louis van Gaal, was appointed. In June 2015 he became goalkeeping coach at West Ham United. He left the role in May 2018 following the appointment of new manager, Manuel Pellegrini. Parallel to being a club coach, in 2011 Woods was employed by the United States men's national soccer team, linking up with Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard. ==Honours== Nottingham Forest * League Cup: 1977‚Äì78 * European Cup: 1978‚Äì79 Norwich City * Football League Cup: 1984‚Äì85 Rangers * Scottish Premier Division: 1986‚Äì87, 1988‚Äì89, 1989‚Äì90, 1990‚Äì91 * Scottish League Cup: 1986‚Äì87, 1987‚Äì88, 1988‚Äì89, 1990‚Äì91 ==References== ==External links== * *Career information at ex-canaries.co.uk Category:English footballers Category:England international footballers Category:England B international footballers Category:England under-21 international footballers Category:Burnley F.C. players Category:Colorado Rapids players Category:Major League Soccer players Category:Norwich City F.C. players Category:Nottingham Forest F.C. players Category:Queens Park Rangers F.C. players Category:Rangers F.C. players Category:Reading F.C. players Category:Sheffield Wednesday F.C. players Category:Southampton F.C. players Category:Sunderland A.F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:1986 FIFA World Cup players Category:UEFA Euro 1988 players Category:1990 FIFA World Cup players Category:UEFA Euro 1992 players Category:People from Swineshead, Lincolnshire Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Everton F.C. non-playing staff Category:Manchester United F.C. non-playing staff Category:West Ham United F.C. non-playing staff Category:Expatriate soccer players in the United States Category:English Football League players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:English expatriate sportspeople in the United States Category:English expatriate footballers Category:UEFA Champions League winning players Category:Association football goalkeeping coaches ","title":"Chris Woods"},{"id":"2201518","text":"Parva () is a commune in Bistri»õa-NƒÉsƒÉud County, Transylvania, Romania.

Gregory Heisler (born 1954) is a professional photographer known for his evocative portrait work often found on the cover of magazines, such as Time, for which he has produced a number of Man, Person, and People of the Year covers. Heisler once had his White House photographer privileges revoked after taking a photograph of President George H.W. Bush for Time magazine in which Heisler used in camera techniques of double exposure to show what the cover labeled the two faces of Bush. The president was unaware of this photographic technique being used at the time of the shot. His press secretary Marlin Fitzwater later wrote about his own anger in Call the Briefing! (He discussed how upset he was in an interview in 1995 with Brian Lamb on C-SPAN's Booknotes.) Heisler's trade group protested the ban because it was based on an editorial opinion that was expressed. Heisler has since taken photographs of President George W. Bush. Among the awards Heisler has received are: 1986 ASMP Corporate Photographer of the Year, 1988 Leica Medal of Excellence, 1991 World Image Award, 2000 Alfred Eisenstaedt Award In September 2009 Gregory Heisler took a position as Artist-in-Residence at the Hallmark Institute of Photography in Turners Falls, Massachusetts. He acted as a teacher and liaison between the students and world of professional photography, expanding their present curriculum, and providing the students with necessary skills and techniques the school did not previously teach. Heisler has now joined the Multimedia Photography & Design program at the S.I.

Firmin was one of his grandchildren. The family's paper manufactory was located at Essonnes, a town c. 30 km southeast of Paris near Corbeil, which had notable paper factories. ==Work== Didot invented the word \\"stereotype\\", which in printing refers to the metal printing plate created for the actual printing of pages (as opposed to printing pages directly with movable type), and used the process extensively, revolutionizing the book trade by his cheap editions. His manufactory was a place of pilgrimage for the printers of the world. He first used the process in his edition of Callet‚Äôs Tables of Logarithms (1795), in which he secured an accuracy till then unattainable. He published stereotyped editions of French, English and Italian classics at a very low price. At the 1798 Exposition des produits de l'industrie fran√ßaise Pierre and Firmin Didot and Louis Etienne Herhan won an honorable distinction, the highest award, for their \\"Superb edition of Virgil with characters and ink of their manufacture; a stereotype plate, and an in-12 edition of the works of Virgil and Lafontaine with these characters.\\" Didot was appointed by Napoleon as the director of the Imprimerie Imp√©riale typefoundry. He was also the author of two tragedies La Reine de Portugal and La Mort d‚ÄôAnnibal and he wrote metrical translations from Virgil, Tyrtaeus and Theocritus. ==Legacy== France is indebted to the Didot family for the publication of the Biographie Nationale, and Belgium is also indebted for the establishment of her Royal Press. Relatives of Firmin Didot include Fran√ßois Ambroise Didot (1730-1804); Pierre Fran√ßois Didot (1732-95); Henri Didot (1765-1862); and Pierre Didot (1760-1853). Essai sur la Typographie by a member of the Didot family was published at Paris in 1852. Along with Giambattista Bodoni of Italy, Firmin Didot is credited with establishing the use of the Didone or \\"Modern\\" style of serif typefaces. The types that Didot used are characterized by extreme contrast in thick strokes and thin strokes, by the use of hairline serifs and by the vertical stress of the letters. Many fonts today are available based on Firmin Didot's typefaces, and are often called Didot as a result. ==References== * ==External links== *Blog post from The Metropolitan Museum of Art * Category:1764 births Category:1836 deaths Category:Businesspeople from Paris Category:Burials at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery Category:French printers Category:French typographers Category:19th-century French people ","title":"Firmin Didot"},{"id":"2201550","text":"Daulat Qazi ( ‚Äì ) was a medieval Bengali poet, was born into a Qazi family in the village of Sultanpur in Raozan Upazila, Chittagong.

He earned his B.A. from Milton College (1926) and his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin (1932). While studying physics at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, he worked as an assistant to astronomer Joel Stebbins helping him in his study of photoelectric photometry. Whitford developed a device for measuring small currents from photoelectric cells, which allowed them to measure fainter stars. He decided to become an astronomer and spent two years at Caltech and Mount Wilson Observatory as a postdoctoral fellow. ==Career== During World War II, Whitford worked in the MIT Radiation Laboratory. In 1948, he succeeded Stebbins as director of the Washburn Observatory and served as director until 1958. He was director of Lick Observatory from 1958‚Äì1968, and oversaw the completion of the Shane Telescope in 1959. He served as president of the American Astronomical Society from 1967‚Äì1970, and later served on the faculties of both the University of California, Santa Cruz and the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. The Whitford reddening curve, quantifying the interstellar absorption of light, was important in the mapping of the distribution of stars in the Milky Way. He also studied the stars in galactic nuclear bulges. In 1954, Whitford was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. In 1986, Whitford received the Henry Norris Russell Lectureship and in 1996 he was awarded the Bruce Medal. ==Death and legacy== Whitford died in Madison, Wisconsin, on March 28, 2002, and a memorial service was held in the auditorium of the Meriter Health Center in Madison. The asteroid 2301 Whitford is named in his honor. ==Personal life== On October 23, 1937, Whitford married Eleanor Bell Whitelaw in Chicago, Illinois.

Each record in a KSDS data file is embedded with a unique key. A KSDS consists of two parts, the data component and a separate index file known as the index component which allows the system to physically locate the record in the data file by its key value. Together, the data and index components are called a cluster. Records can be accessed randomly or in sequence and can be variable-length. As a VSAM data set, the KSDS data and index components consist of control intervals which are further organized in control areas. As records are added at random to a KSDS, control intervals fill and need to be split into two new control intervals, each new control interval receiving roughly half of the records. Similarly, as the control intervals in a control area are used up, a control area will be split into two new control areas, each new control area receiving roughly half the control intervals.

Today the site forms a circular earthwork, 27.47 m across and 2.74 m high, with a ditch on the north- west and south-east sides, on the top of a ridge, overlooking a brook which runs into the River Cary and the old Roman road of the Fosse Way. Sir John Stawell, the Baron Stawell, claimed to be the lord of the manor of Babcary in 1594 and his family continued these claims until 1691. The Red Lion Inn has 17th-century origins and is a grade II listed building. The parish council, was concerned with the insanitary drainage system for the village, but rejected a mains water supply in 1931 as too expensive. Electricity was provided in 1947 but mains water was not supplied until the 1950s. Sewerage remained a serious problem in the 1970s and mains drainage was not provided until 1992. ==Governance== The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Langport Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Somerton and Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. ==Geography== Babcary Meadows to the north of the village is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest because it is one of the last remaining areas of traditionally managed unimproved neutral grassland in south Somerset and contains a rich variety of herbs. It is run as a nature reserve by the Somerset Wildlife Trust after they purchased it with grant assistance from South Somerset Council. ==Religious sites== The Church of the Holy Cross had its origins before the Norman Conquest. The fabric dates from the 14th and 15th centuries with the chancel and north aisle being added in the 19th century by Benjamin Ferrey in 1875‚Äì76. The tower contains a bell dating from 1753 and made by Thomas Bilbie of the Bilbie family. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Villages in South Somerset Category:Civil parishes in Somerset ","title":"Babcary"},{"id":"2201575","text":"Portion Control are a British electronic and industrial band from South London, formed in 1979.Assimilate: A Critical History of Industrial Music by S. Alexander Reed The original incarnation of the group existed until 1987; they reformed in 2002. The band pioneered the use of sampling and were acclaimed for their use of the Apple II computer based Greengate DS3 sampling and sequencing system. They have been cited as an influence on Front Line Assembly, Skinny Puppy, Orbital and Nine Inch Nails. ==History== Portion Control formed in 1979 with a line-up of Dean Piavani, Ian Sharp and John Whybrew. The trio's first release, the cassette-only A Fair Portion (including Andy Wilson of the Passage on bass), was issued in 1980 by Ladelled Music, followed by three further cassettes on In Phaze Records, Gaining Momentum and Private Illusions No 1 (both 1981) and With Mixed Emotion (1982). Author S. Alexander Reed, in his book Assimilate: A Critical History of Industrial Music, said that Portion Control's early sound \\"blends innocuously with the moodier moments of Cabaret Voltaire and Throbbing Gristle\\", and at times \\"demonstrated a gift for gritty, teethgrinding distortion, not unlike Esplendor Geometrico\\". Their first full-length vinyl release, I Staggered Mentally, was released 22 November 1982 by In Phaze. Further albums included ..Step Forward (1984, Illuminated Records) and Psycho-Bod Saves the World (1986, Dead Man's Curve). In January 1984, Portion Control recorded a Peel Session.BBC John Peel Sessions - Portion Control. Retrieved 4 November 2006. In 1987, the band ended. All three founding members reorganized in 1990 as Solar Enemy, releasing two albums before splitting in 1993. Piavanni and Whybrew reformed Portion Control in 2002, and self-released their first reunion album, Wellcome, in 2004. ==Members== ;Current * Dean Piavanni (1979-1987, 2002‚Äìpresent) * John Whybrew (1979-1987, 2002‚Äìpresent) ;Former * Ian Sharp (1979-1987) *Andrew Johnson (1979-1980) ==DiscographyStudio albums=== *A Fair Portion cassette-only (1980, Ladelled Music) *Gaining Momentum cassette-only (1981, In Phaze Records) *Private Illusions No 1 cassette-only (1981, In Phaze Records) *With Mixed Emotion cassette-only (1982, In Phaze Records) *I Staggered Mentally (1982, In Phaze Records) *Shot in the Belly cassette-only (1983, Third Mind Records) *..Step Forward (1984, Illuminated Records) *Psycho-Bod Saves the World (1986, Dead Man's Curve) *Wellcome (2004, self-released) *Dissolve (2004, Catalyst) *Filthy White Guy (2006, self-released) *Onion Jack IV (2007, self-released) *Slug (2008, self- released) *Violently Alive (2010, Sigsaly Transmissions) *Pure Form (2012, Other Sounds) *Unrest in the Grime (2014, Minimal Maximal) *Head Buried (2020, self-released) ===Singles=== *\\"Across the Fence\\" flexi-disc (1981, In Phaze Records) *\\"Raise the Pulse\\" 7\\"/12\\" (1982, Illuminated Records) *\\"Rough Justice\\" 12\\" (1984, Illuminated Records) *\\"Go-Talk\\" 12\\" (1984, Illuminated Records)) *\\"The Great Divide\\" 7\\"/12\\" (1985, Rhythmic Records) ===EPs=== *Dining on the Fresh cassette-only (1981, In Phaze Records) *Surface and Be Seen 12\\" (1982, In Phaze Records) *Hit the Pulse 12\\" (1983, In Phaze Records) *Purge 12\\" (1986, Dead Man's Curve) *Code 11 digital (2003, self-released) *Stansted 7\\"/CD (2005, self-released) *SEED EP1 digital (2020, self-released) ===Live albums=== *Assault (1986, For All and None) *Live in Europe (Spain‚¶ÅUK‚¶ÅSweden) (1987, Big Noise in Archgate) *Live Granada 1985 (2014, Wet Dreams) ===Compilation albums === *Simulate Sensual (1983, In Phaze Records) *The Man Who Did Backwards Somersaults (1994, T.E.Q.

Tanner was famous for his big left-handed serve, which was clocked at 153 mph at Palm Springs in 1978 during the final against Ra√∫l Ram√≠rez.Wimbledon '99: Secrets of an express delivery, by Ronald Atkin, The Independent, June 20, 1999 Retrieved 12/9/09. He is also known for winning the men's singles title at the first of two Australian Open tournaments held in 1977. Tanner won the tournament held in January, Vitas Gerulaitis won the December tournament. Tanner reached the Wimbledon final in 1979, losing to Bj√∂rn Borg in five sets. Tanner was in the news in the 2000s for legal problems that included stretches of imprisonment, arrests for missing child support payments, allegations of financial misdeeds, and bankruptcy. ==Early life== Leonard Roscoe Tanner III hailed from Lookout Mountain, Tennessee, graduated from Baylor School in Chattanooga, and with teammate Sandy Mayer helped to lead Stanford University's rise to national prominence in collegiate tennis. Tanner played number one singles, with Mayer playing number two. In 1972, Tanner and Mayer won the NCAA doubles championship, and the Stanford team finished second in the NCAA tournament, behind Trinity (TX). The team also featured Chico Hagey, Rick Fisher, Jim Delaney, Gery Groslimond, Chip Fisher, Paul Sidone, and Tim Noonan. ==Playing history== Tanner defeated Haroon Rahim 10‚Äì8 in the fifth set to win the 1970 United States Amateur Championships. Tanner defeated Guillermo Vilas in three straight sets in the 1977 Australian Open (January) final, to win his first and only grand slam title. Tanner lost a five set match to Bj√∂rn Borg in the 1979 Wimbledon final, which was the first Wimbledon final to be broadcast live in the United States as part of NBC's Breakfast at Wimbledon. Tanner avenged this loss to Borg by beating him in four sets in the US Open quarterfinals two months later, a match where Tanner's 140 mph serve brought the net down during the fourth set. Tanner lost to Vitas Gerulaitis in the semifinals. Tanner described his 1979 US Open win over Borg and loss to Gerulaitis in his autobiography as \\"the highest of my highs and the lowest of my lows on a tennis court within two days of each other\\". Tanner's strong left-handed serve was thrown very low and struck with a lunge involving the whole body, earning him the nickname \\"The Rocket\\". His booming 153 mph serve was the fastest ever recorded in tournament competition from February 1978 until Andy Roddick posted a 155 mph serve in a Davis Cup semifinal in September 2004 against Vladimir Voltchkov. He won the Davis Cup in 1981 playing with John McEnroe, Eliot Teltscher and Peter Fleming on a team captained by Arthur Ashe that defeated Argentina in the final, played at Riverfront Coliseum in Cincinnati. ==Grand Slam singles performance timeline== {class= style=text-align:center;font-size:97% !Tournament!!1969!!1970!!1971!!1972!!1973!!1974!!1975!!1976!!colspan=21977!!1978!!1979!!1980!!1981!!1982!!1983!!1984!!SR!!W‚ÄìL - bgcolor=#EFEFEF align=left Australian Open1 A A A A A A A A bgcolor=limeWbgcolor=#afeeee1R A A A bgcolor=#afeeee2R A bgcolor=#afeeee3R A bgcolor=#EFEFEF1 / 4 bgcolor=#EFEFEF9‚Äì3 - bgcolor=#EFEFEF align=left French Open A A A A A bgcolor=#afeeee1R bgcolor=#afeeee3R A colspan=2A bgcolor=#afeeee4R A A A A A A bgcolor=#EFEFEF0 / 3 bgcolor=#EFEFEF5‚Äì3 - bgcolor=#EFEFEF align=left Wimbledon A A A bgcolor=#afeeee3R A bgcolor=#afeeee4R bgcolor=yellowSF bgcolor=yellowSF colspan=2 bgcolor=#afeeee1R bgcolor=#afeeee4R bgcolor=thistleF bgcolor=#ffebcdQF bgcolor=#afeeee2R bgcolor=#afeeee4R bgcolor=#ffebcdQF A bgcolor=#EFEFEF0 / 11 bgcolor=#EFEFEF36‚Äì11 - bgcolor=#EFEFEF align=left US Open bgcolor=#afeeee1R bgcolor=#afeeee2R bgcolor=#afeeee3R bgcolor=#ffebcdQF bgcolor=#afeeee3R bgcolor=yellowSF bgcolor=#afeeee3R bgcolor=#afeeee4R colspan=2 bgcolor=#afeeee4R bgcolor=#afeeee4R bgcolor=yellowSF bgcolor=#ffebcdQF bgcolor=#ffebcdQF bgcolor=#afeeee2R bgcolor=#afeeee3R bgcolor=#afeeee1R bgcolor=#EFEFEF0 / 13 bgcolor=#EFEFEF39‚Äì13 - !style=text-align:leftWin‚ÄìLoss !0‚Äì1 !0‚Äì1 !2‚Äì1 !6‚Äì2 !2‚Äì1 !8‚Äì3 !9‚Äì3 !8‚Äì2 !colspan=29‚Äì3 !9‚Äì3 !11‚Äì2 !8‚Äì2 !6‚Äì3 !4‚Äì2 !8‚Äì3 !0‚Äì1 !1 / 34 !88‚Äì30 } 1The Australian Open was played twice in 1977, in January and December. ===Grand Slam finals=== Singles: 2 (1‚Äì1) {class=\\"sortable \\" !width=40Result !width=50Year !width=200Championship !width=50Surface !width=160Opponent !style=\\"width:180px\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"Score -bgcolor=#FFFFCC bgcolor=98FB98Win1977straan Open (Jan.)GrassGuillmo Vilas6‚Äì3, 6, 6‚Äì3 -bgcolor=#CCFFCC bgcolor=FFA07ALoss1979mblenGrassBj√∂rnorg7‚Äì6(7‚Äì, 1‚Äì6, 6‚Äì3, 3‚Äì6, 4‚Äì6 } ==Career finalsSingles (16 titles, 25 runner-ups)=== {class=\\"sortable \\" !style=\\"width:40px\\"Result !style=\\"width:20px\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"No. !style=\\"width:40px\\"Year !style=\\"width:200px\\"Tournament !style=\\"width:50px\\"Surface !style=\\"width:170px\\"Opponent !style=\\"width:160px\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"Score -  ffa07a;\\"Loss 1. 1972 Albany, U.S. Hard (i)  Jimmy Connors 2‚Äì6, 6‚Äì7 -e9e9e9;\\"  ffa07a;\\"Loss 2. 1972 Los Angeles, U.S. Hard  Stan Smith 4‚Äì6, 4‚Äì6 -  ffa07a;\\"Loss 3. 1973 Milan WCT, Italy Carpet (i)  Marty Riessen 6‚Äì7, 0‚Äì6, 6‚Äì7 -  ffa07a;\\"Loss 4. 1974 Palm Desert WCT, U.S. Hard  Rod Laver 4‚Äì6, 2‚Äì6 -  98fb98;\\"Win 1. 1974 Denver WCT, U.S. Carpet (i)  Arthur Ashe 6‚Äì2, 6‚Äì4 -  ffa07a;\\"Loss 5. 1974 Columbus, U.S. Hard  Ra√∫l Ram√≠rez 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì7, 4‚Äì6 -  ffa07a;\\"Loss 6. 1974 Maui, U.S. Hard  John Newcombe 6‚Äì7, 6‚Äì7 -  98fb98;\\"Win 2. 1974 Christchurch, New Zealand Carpet (i)  Ray Ruffels 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì2 -  ffa07a;\\"Loss 7. 1975 St. Petersburg WCT, U.S. Hard  Ra√∫l Ram√≠rez 0‚Äì6, 6‚Äì1, 2‚Äì6 -  ffa07a;\\"Loss 8. 1975 St. Louis WCT, U.S. Clay  Vitas Gerulaitis 6‚Äì2, 2‚Äì6, 3‚Äì6 -  ffa07a;\\"Loss 9. 1975 Charlotte, U.S. Clay  Ra√∫l Ram√≠rez 6‚Äì3, 4‚Äì6, 3‚Äì6 -e9e9e9;\\"  98fb98;\\"Win 3. 1975 Las Vegas WCT, U.S. Hard  Ross Case 5‚Äì7, 7‚Äì5, 7‚Äì6 -  98fb98;\\"Win 4. 1975 Chicago, U.S. Carpet (i)  John Alexander 6‚Äì1, 6‚Äì7, 7‚Äì6 -e9e9e9;\\"  ffa07a;\\"Loss 10. 1975 Los Angeles, U.S. Hard  Arthur Ashe 6‚Äì3, 5‚Äì7, 3‚Äì6 -  ffa07a;\\"Loss 11. 1976 Birmingham, U.S. Carpet (i)  Jimmy Connors 4‚Äì6, 6‚Äì3, 1‚Äì6 -  ffa07a;\\"Loss 12. 1976 Rancho Mirage, U.S. Hard  Jimmy Connors 4‚Äì6, 4‚Äì6 -  98fb98;\\"Win 5. 1976 Cincinnati, U.S. Clay  Eddie Dibbs 7‚Äì6, 6‚Äì3 -  98fb98;\\"Win 6. 1976 Columbus, U.S. Hard  Stan Smith 6‚Äì4, 7‚Äì6 -  ffa07a;\\"Loss 13. 1976 South Orange, U.S. Clay  Ilie NƒÉstase 4‚Äì6, 2‚Äì6 -  98fb98;\\"Win 7. 1976 San Francisco, U.S. Hard (i)  Brian Gottfried 4‚Äì6, 7‚Äì5, 6‚Äì1 -  98fb98;\\"Win 8. 1976 Tokyo Outdoor, Japan Clay  Corrado Barazzutti 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì2 -  98fb98;\\"Win 9. 1976 Beckenham, U.K Grass  Jimmy Connors 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì4 - e9e9e9;\\"  ffa07a;\\"Loss 14. 1976 Wembley, U.K. Carpet (i)  Jimmy Connors 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì7, 4‚Äì6 - f3e6d7;\\"  98fb98;\\" Win 10. 1977 (Jan.)

The parish, which includes the village of Stoford has a population of 1,221. ==History== The earliest signs of habitation in the area were the relics of a Bronze Age burial which were found in 1826, a little to the north of the village of Stoford, which may be a Saxon name derived from Stow-Ford.The Somerset Urban Archaeological Survey: Stoford , by Miranda Richardson Settlement may go back as far as Saxon times, the earliest mention of Barwick being in 1185. In the Middle Ages, Stoford was shown as a new town and in an Inquisition or survey of 1273 there were 74 burgages each paying 10d (ten pence) a year. The total population of the borough in 1273 was probably over 500. Stoford kept its borough status for at least 300 years. A guildhall was mentioned in 1361 and there is proof of a separate borough court. There was still a 'borough of Stoford' in the musters of 1569. The parish was part of the hundred of Houndsborough. ==Governance== The parish council is responsible for local issues. It sets an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and produces annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Yeovil Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Yeovil county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. ==Barwick Park== John and Grace Newman (Thomas Beach, 1768) Jack the Treacle Eater, one of the Barwick follies The estate originally formed part of the property of Syon Abbey, and passed through various hands after the Dissolution in the 1530s. The present house and park are thought to have been built in 1770 by John and Grace Newman, whose relations owned neighbouring Newton Surmaville. The house was set in pleasure grounds containing a lake and grotto, while the surrounding parkland was ornamented with a Gothic lodge and a group of four follies. In the early 19th century the estate passed to Thomas Messiter, a barrister, who was John Newman's nephew and in 1830 the mansion was remodelled in a Jacobean Revival style. An orangery was constructed adjoining the north side at the same period. During the early 20th century the estate was let to various persons. During World War II, it was the location of a prisoner of war camp, initially housing Italian prisoners from the Western Desert Campaign, and later German prisoners after the Battle of Normandy. Following derequisition of the property, after the war, the Messiter family carried out considerable modernisation and repairs and took up residence. They remained there until some time in the 1960s. From the early 1970s through to the mid 1980s the mansion and surrounding grounds were let to Pagems Schools Ltd and Headmaster Major Arthur Gray for use as a privately run boarding school attracting boys from London, Liverpool, Bristol, Swansea and several other areas around the country. The school was also part of the Sea Cadet Corps, known as T.S. Gryphon with affiliations to HMS Hampshire (D06)H.M.S. Hampshire and nearby RNAS Yeovilton H.M.S. Heron. The school closed around 1986/87 due to bankruptcy. In the 1990s the estate was sold to a private owner, and substantial repairs were carried out to the house, orangery and landscape structures. The site remains in private ownership. ===Barwick Park follies=== Barwick Park boasts four follies. Locals say they were built to give the estate labourers work during a time of depression in the 1820s. They were possibly commissioned by George Messiter of Barwick to mark the park boundaries at the four cardinal points: Jack the Treacle Eater (a stone arch topped by a round tower) to the east, the Fish Tower in the north, Messiter's Cone (also known as the Rose Tower), which is high, at the west end and the Needle to the south. However, paintings of Barwick House in the 1780s, forty years earlier, include two of the follies. The follies collectively rank on Countryfile's 2009 countdown of \\"Britain's top 10 follies\\".http://www.countryfile.com/countryside/britains-top-10-follies ==Transport== The parish contains Yeovil Junction railway station, on the London‚ÄìExeter line. ==The church== The Church of Saint Mary Magdalene is just off the A37 at the western end of the village, about half a mile away from the main centre of population. The church was built before 1219 as a chapel of the minster church in Yeovil. It has been rebuilt and restored since, particularly in the 1850 when the chancel was rebuilt. There is still a weekly service. The ecclesiastical parish is now part of the benefice of Holy Trinity, Yeovil. The most architecturally significant features of the church are the bench ends, dating from 1533 - the eve of the English Reformation. The bench ends depict scenes from village life as well as typical pagan symbolism from that period such as the Green Man and the unicorn, a symbol of eternal life. There are also religious objects dating back much earlier, presumably from the church originally on the site, e.g. the Norman font. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. ==Sport== A short lived greyhound racing track was opened on Saturday 22 August 1931 at Barwick Field on Long Lane near Barwick Park. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and was known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. The race distance was 525 yards, the racing ended in early 1932. ==Gallery== Image:Barwick Cone.jpgThe Cone Image:Jack The Treacle Eater 2.jpgJack the Treacle Eater Image:Barwick Fish Tower.jpgFish Tower Image:RoyalOakStoford.jpgThe Royal Oak in Stoford ==References== ==External links== Category:Villages in South Somerset Category:World War II prisoner of war camps in England Category:Folly buildings in England Category:Civil parishes in Somerset Category:Country houses in Somerset ","title":"Barwick, Somerset"},{"id":"2201627","text":"The Erste (, literally First-Danube-Steamboat-Shipping Company) or DDSG was a shipping company founded in 1829 by the Austrian government for transporting passengers and cargo on the Danube. The company built its first steamship building factory the so-called \\"√ìbuda Shipyard\\" on the Haj√≥gy√°ri Island in Kingdom of Hungary in 1835, which was the first industrial scale steamship building company in the Habsburg Empire.Victor-L. Tapie: The Rise and Fall of the Hubsburg Monarchy PAGE: 267 In 1880, the DDSG was the world's largest river shipping company with more than 200 steamboat ships and about 1000 cargo tubs. During the Third Reich era, the DDSG was involved in transporting Austrian Jews after Kristallnacht, when the Jews were pressured to emigrate elsewhere. Beginning in 1938, the DDSG transported Jews who were on so-called \\"B-immigration transports\\". The DDSG was also involved in taking excessive amounts of money and property from Jews in order to transport them. The SS worked with the DDSG in making the exit permits for Jews easier to obtain, since, at this point, the Nazis apparently just wanted them to leave the country. Although the Gestapo had leverage over the DDSG, the DDSG was a group that operated on its own will, in order to profit from forced Jewish emigration.Jews for Sale? Nazi-Jewish Negotiations, 1933-1945, by Yehuda Bauer (New Haven/London: Yale U.P., 1994; pp. xiii + 306. See page 48 In 1991 the company was split into a passenger transportation enterprise and a cargo transport company. The company was sold to a private owner in 1993. Today the DDSG exists in the form of the two private companies DDSG-Blue Danube Schiffahrt GmbH (passenger transport) and the DDSG-Cargo GmbH. Since the German spelling reform of 1996, \\"Schifffahrt\\" is written with three \\"f\\"s; however, since the name belongs to a company that existed before the spelling reform, the old form of the name is used when referring to the company. The name of the company is well known in German-speaking countries as a starter to humorously construct even longer compound words. ' is such a word, which potentially might even have been used, but probably never actually was. It means a \\"DDSG captain's hat\\".

Bowrey was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia and is best remembered as the last amateur to win the Australian Championships in 1968 before the tournament opened itself to professional tennis players in 1969. At the age of 16 Bowrey was a member of the schoolboys' NSW state PSAAA tennis team. In the process of qualifying he overcame promising Newcastle junior Ross Flanagan who had match point against Bowrey. Bowrey held on to win and Ross Flanagan decided to pursue a less spectacular career as a Physics and Sports Biomechanics Lecturer at The University of Newcastle. ==Biography== Bowrey reached the quarters of the Australian (international amateur) Championships in 1965 (losing to John Newcombe), 1966 (losing to Roy Emerson) and 1967 (losing to Emerson) and the US Open quarters in 1966 (losing to Manuel Santana). At the 1967 US Open doubles, Bowrey and partner Owen Davidson lost the final to Newcombe and Roche in four sets. At the end of 1967, John Newcombe, Roy Emerson and Tony Roche had all signed professional contracts, which left the amateur game devoid of talent. A poor quality field lined up for the 1968 Australian championships, which were held at Melbourne's historic Kooyong Lawn Tennis Club. Bowrey was the top seed. In the final Bowrey met the Spaniard Juan Gisbert, which he won in four sets. A month after his Australian triumph Bowrey married the women's player Lesley Turner. The game went open in April that year and at the first Open Wimbledon Bowrey lost in the second round to Andr√©s Gimeno. Defending his Australian title the following year Bowrey blew a two sets to love lead in the quarters against Ray Ruffels. Bowrey represented Australia in two Davis Cup rounds, the first against the U.S in the World Group Final in December 1968, where he lost to Clark Graebner in five sets and beat Arthur Ashe in four sets. The second in the North & Central America draw in May 1969 versus Mexico, where he won against Joaquin Loyo-Mayo and lost to Rafael Osuna. Bowrey was also involved in one of the longest matches in tennis history at Wimbledon in 1970 against Patricio Cornejo that consumed nearly four hours and took 84 games. In January 1970 Bowrey turned professional which meant he was no longer eligible to play in the Davis Cup. Later that year Bowrey with partner Marty Riessen won the Rogers Cup (formerly Canadian Open) in two sets against Fred Stolle and Cliff Drysdale 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì2. He also won the Rome ATP World Tour Masters ‚Äì Doubles that year with Owen Davidson. Bowrey married fellow tennis professional Lesley Turner in 1968 and went into semi-retirement in 1972 at the age of just 28, becoming a coach. After their playing careers were over, Bowrey and his wife Lesley became the lead match-play commentators at Wimbledon on the All-England Club's radio station and Internet Web site \\"Radio Wimbledon.\\" ==Grand Slam finalsSingles (1 title)=== { class='sortable ' !style=\\"width:40px\\"Result !style=\\"width:35px\\"Year !style=\\"width:200px\\"Championship !style=\\"width:50px\\"Surface !style=\\"width:170px\\"Opponent !style=\\"width:180px\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"Score -ffc;\\"  98fb98;\\"Win  1968  Australian Championships  Grass  Juan Gisbert, Sr.  7‚Äì5, 2‚Äì6, 9‚Äì7, 6‚Äì4 } === Doubles (3 runners-up) === {class=\\"sortable \\" !style=\\"width:40px\\"Result !style=\\"width:35px\\"Year !style=\\"width:200px\\"Championship !style=\\"width:50px\\"Surface !style=\\"width:170px\\"Partner !style=\\"width:170px\\"Opponents !style=\\"width:180px\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"Score -cfc;\\"  ffa07a;\\"Loss  1966  Wimbledon  Grass  Owen Davidson  Ken Fletcher John Newcombe  3‚Äì6, 4‚Äì6, 6‚Äì3, 3‚Äì6 -ccf;\\"  ffa07a;\\"Loss  1967  Australian Championships  Grass  Owen Davidson  John Newcombe Tony Roche  6‚Äì3, 3‚Äì6, 5‚Äì7, 8‚Äì6, 6‚Äì8 -ffc;\\"  ffa07a;\\"Loss  1967  U.S. Championships  Grass  Owen Davidson  John Newcombe Tony Roche  8‚Äì6, 7‚Äì9, 3‚Äì6, 3‚Äì6 } ==Grand Slam tournament performance timelineSingles=== {class= style=text-align:center !Tournament !!1962 !!1963 !!1964 !!1965 !!1966 !!1967 !!1968 !!1969 !!1970 !!1971 !!1972 !!1973 !!1974 !!1975!! -  colspan=16 style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Grand Slam tournaments -  align=left bgcolor=#efefefAustralian Open  bgcolor=afeeee2R  bgcolor=afeeee2R  bgcolor=afeeee3R  bgcolor=ffebcdQF  bgcolor=ffebcdQF  bgcolor=ffebcdQF  bgcolor=limeW  bgcolor=ffebcdQF  bgcolor=afeeee3R  bgcolor=afeeee1R  A  bgcolor=afeeee1R  A  bgcolor=afeeee2R  bgcolor=#efefef 1 / 12 -  align=left bgcolor=#efefefFrench Open  A  A  A  bgcolor=afeeee3R  bgcolor=afeeee1R  bgcolor=afeeee2R  A  bgcolor=afeeee2R  A  bgcolor=afeeee3R  A  A  A  A  bgcolor=#efefef 0 / 5 -  align=left bgcolor=#efefefWimbledon  bgcolor=afeeee2R  A  bgcolor=afeeee1R  bgcolor=afeeee1R  bgcolor=afeeee4R  bgcolor=afeeee3R  bgcolor=afeeee2R  bgcolor=afeeee3R  bgcolor=afeeee2R  bgcolor=afeeee1R  A  A  A  A  bgcolor=#efefef 0 / 9 -  align=left bgcolor=#efefefUS Open  A  A  bgcolor=afeeee4R  A  bgcolor=ffebcdQF  bgcolor=afeeee4R  A  bgcolor=afeeee3R  bgcolor=afeeee3R  bgcolor=afeeee3R  A  A  A  A  bgcolor=#efefef 0 / 6 - style=\\"font-weight:bold; background:#efefef;\\"  style=text-align:leftStrike Rate  0 / 2  0 / 1  0 / 3  0 / 3  0 / 4  0 / 4  1 / 2  0 / 4  0 / 3  0 / 4  0 / 0  0 / 1  0 / 0  0 / 1  } ==References* * Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:Australian Championships (tennis) champions Category:Australian male tennis players Category:People from Sydney Category:Tennis people from New South Wales Category:Tennis people from Victoria (Australia) Category:Grand Slam (tennis) champions in men's singles Category:Grand Slam (tennis) champions in boys' doubles Category:Australian Championships (tennis) junior champions ","title":"Bill Bowrey"},{"id":"2201634","text":"General Nicholas Joseph Fury is a fictional character appearing in comic books published by Marvel Comics' Ultimate Marvel section as a different version of Nick Fury. He has a substantial presence in all the Ultimate Marvel comics, appearing first in Ultimate Marvel Team-Up and Ultimate X-Men and later reappearing regularly in Ultimate Spider-Man and finally securing a regular, recurring role as the general of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the leader of the Ultimates, a re-imagining of the Avengers. This character was designed to look like Samuel L. Jackson who later went on to portray Fury in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. ==Publication history== The original design for Ultimate Nick Fury When Nick Fury first made his appearance in the Ultimate Universe, he had a vastly different design, resembling more the original mainstream version with notable differences, featuring a full head of close-cropped hair, a clean- shaven, younger appearance (particularly as depicted in Ultimate Marvel Team- Up) and less visible scarring around his eye-patch, not to mention lacking a specific resemblance to any actor. He wore seemingly normal clothing which integrated outlandishly high-tech capabilities such as phasing, invisibility, and \\"para-shoes\\" that allow him to descend hundreds of feet without the aid of a parachute (shown to be capable of flight in later issues).Ultimate X-Men Vol. 1 HC When the character resurfaced in 2002 in The Ultimates, he had been redesigned to look like actor Samuel L. Jackson. and first appeared with this revised look in The Ultimates #1, as drawn by Bryan Hitch. The similarity is even noted within the comic itself, in a scene in which the Ultimates discuss who they think should play each of them in a hypothetical movie about the team. Fury's answer for himself is \\"Mr. Samuel L. Jackson, of course, no discussion.\\" In The Mighty Avengers #13, Nick Fury (of the Earth-616 universe) uses a disguise that is similar in appearance to Ultimate Fury. This receives comment from Daisy Johnson as \\"his worst disguise ever.\\" Conversely, in Ultimate Mystery, it is the Ultimate version of the character who disguises himself, resembling his Earth-616 counterpart and gets the same comment. In the mainstream event of Battle Scars (a follow-up to the Fear Itself crossover), it is revealed that the 616 Fury fathered a child with an African- American woman named Nia Jones. His child went under the alias \\"Marcus Johnson\\", but his real name is Nick Fury, Jr.. Fury Jr. closely resembles the Ultimate version of Fury.Battle Scars #1 When the original Nick Fury decided to retire as director of S.H.I.E.L.D., the mantle was handed onto Fury Jr., who had recently lost his left eye and took to wearing an eye patch. ==Fictional character biographyOrigins=== Nicholas Fury fought for the United States in World War II. During the invasion of Sicily, he, along with Private Fisk (the grandfather of Wilson Fisk) and Canadian paratrooper Corporal Howlett, attempted to loot a house. American military police arrived to arrest them, and all three were subdued. Fisk was grazed by a bullet, while Fury was imprisoned in an unknown location alongside several other black men, and Howlett, despite protests that he was Canadian, was also shipped to an unknown location.Ultimate Origins #1 (2008) Fury was selected to be the next test subject for Project: Rebirth, as his blood work most closely matched that of Subject #22, the most successful of the previous test subjects. He was injected with a serum that gave him super-strength, which he used to free himself and the other prisoners, who then escaped. The scientists who were working on him let him escape, deciding that they have all the information that they needed for now.Ultimate Origins #2 (2008) After attending college in India, Fury enlisted in the U.S. military, where he was deployed into various conflicts such as the Kosovo War. He was later assigned to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Weapon X program in the original Gulf War. While transporting Wolverine in an adamantium cage, an Iraqi guerrilla ambushed and killed his team, inadvertently freeing Wolverine from his prison. After slaughtering the Iraqi guards, Wolverine discovered Fury, the only survivor of the ambush, and transported him back through the desert to the Allied forces. Although Wolverine was summarily subdued and re-imprisoned by his handlers, a bond between the two men was formed.Ultimate X-Men: Return to Weapon X The next day, Fury, already mostly healed, was confronted by General Thaddeus Ross. The General had discovered much was unusual about Fury and questioned him at length, prompting him to reexamine where he was going in life.Ultimate Origins #3 (2008) ===Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Ultimates=== Years later, the X-Men were abducted and imprisoned by the Weapon X program. This program was overseen at the time by Wraith, who had previously staged a coup against General Ross. This coup had prevented Ross from dismantling the Weapon X program altogether. Wolverine, the only X-Man who eludes capture, later asks Fury for help in freeing the other X-Men and bringing down the Weapon X program. During the operation, which also involves the Brotherhood of Mutants, Wraith was about to kill Nightcrawler, but was shot dead by Fury. Fury is summarily promoted to General and resumes the duties of the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. He was tasked with forming a team to battle posthuman threats and resurrecting the Super-Soldier program, two objectives that resulted in the formation of the Ultimates. Fury operates as the commander of the team, at times leading them into action, though he often shares duties with the revived World War II hero Captain America and billionaire genius Iron Man. Nick Fury is also responsible for monitoring superhumans who are not affiliated with the U.S. Military, including Peter Parker and the X-Men.Ultimates #1 Nick Fury lost his right arm in a battle against the Liberators in The Ultimates (Vol. 2). He replaced it shortly thereafter with a bionic one. ===Ultimate Spider- Man=== Nick Fury has also been involved in the Ultimate Spider-Man comics. In them, he meets Peter after Norman Osborn returns. He states that S.H.I.E.L.D. was able to figure out who Peter was because of the security shots of the OG Spider biting Peter, as well as Dr. Octopus screaming that Peter Parker is Spider-Man while in jail. Nick Fury has been watching Peter and informs him that, due to his illegal genetically altered status, he will become the property of S.H.I.E.L.D. when he turns eighteen. Although Fury wants him to be part of the Ultimates, this may have changed because the Ultimates broke apart. Peter and Fury's relationship became strained after the Hobgoblin arc. Peter punches Fury for ignoring his questions for why Harry Osborn became the Hobgoblin. At that point, Fury told one of his scientists that he wanted to know everything about OZ and that it was time for Peter Parker to lose his spider powers. This follows on to the Ultimate Clone Saga, in which it is revealed by Fury that the Tinkerer's Spider-Slayers were developed to handle Peter if and when he ever went insane. Mary Jane Watson, upon discovering Fury's intentions, tells him that Peter looks up to him like a father. This convinced Fury to let Peter keep his powers, and he apologises to Peter, stating that in his line of work he's been trained to expect someone in Peter's position to crack under stress.Ultimate Spider-Man #100 ===Ultimate Power=== Fury was judged to be at least partially responsible for the devastation of much of Earth-31916 along with Emil Burbank. Burbank had sought a means to defeat the Hyperion of that universe. An alien organism, unleashed in an attempt to achieve this, spread throughout the United States, causing widespread devastation. A probe sent by Reed Richards provided evidence that an \\"invasion from another universe\\" was responsible. The Squadron Supreme was dispatched to the Ultimate Universe in order to arrest Richards so that he could stand trial for his \\"crimes\\". A lengthy battle ensued between the Squadron on one side and the Ultimates, Spider-Man, the X-Men, and the Fantastic Four on the other. Richards, believing himself to be responsible when the Squadron produced his probe as evidence, surrendered himself. Fury was unwilling to accept this and convinced Thor to create a bridge to Earth-31916, through which the Helicarrier was able to travel. Once there, another battle between the Squadron and the Ultimate Universe heroes began. Spider-Man learns that Fury had an ulterior motive - the retrieval of the probes and their data, and had conspired with Doctor Doom to do so. In addition, Fury had brought insurance in the form of the Hulk. It took the combined power of the Ultimate Universe heroes, the Earth-31916 Squadron Supreme, and their counterparts from Earth-712 to defeat the Hulk, but Doom had proven to be simply a Doombot. To stop the fighting, the Ultimates agreed to turn over Fury to the Earth-31916 Squadron and to allow Power Princess to return with them to their universe. Fury tries to convince them that they are making a mistake, but his pleas are ignored.Ultimate Power #1-9 Fury is seen still stranded in Earth-31916 in Squadron Supreme (Vol. 2) #1. He has apparently fulfilled the prophecy made by Hyperion in Ultimate Power #9: \\"Given the strength of our military industrial complex, Fury would have risen here to even greater heights than your homeworld.\\"SQUADRON SUPREME 2 #1 - Marvel Comics Publishing Catalog ===Ultimatum=== Fury returns to the Ultimate Universe in Ultimatum #4 and is instrumental in defeating Magneto. Jean Grey telepathically relays the information discovered by Fury in Ultimate Origins that mutants are not the next stage in human evolution, but are in fact the result of experimentation done by humans. This revelation causes Magneto to reverse the damage done to the Earth's magnetic poles.Ultimatum #4-5 Following the events of Ultimatum, Fury is informed by Hawkeye about how Captain America discovered the secret of the Red Skull. Fury asks head of S.H.I.E.L.D. Carol Danvers for permission to start up a \\"death squad\\" in order to catch the Red Skull and Cap, which he then carries out with the help of Hawkeye, Gregory Stark, and the rest of the Ultimate Avengers.Ultimate Comics: Avengers #1 ===Project: Avengers=== In Ultimate Comics: Avengers Fury returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. again. After learning that Captain America went rogue after discovering that the Red Skull was his biological son, Fury re-activated \\"Project Avenger\\" and recruited a team of questionable super humans to find Captain America.Ultimate Avengers #1-5 Following Captain America's capture, Fury briefed the Avengers of AIM's purpose of creating the Cosmic Cube to build their visioned utopia and readied his team to thwart the organization's plans. Fury guided his team of Avengers from headquarters, with the secret intent to go ahead with \\"Plan B\\", which is to detonate a nuclear warhead that was built into War Machine's armor by Gregory Stark in case the mission failed. Captain America managed to arrive at the location of the battle between the Red Skull and the Avengers and teleported the jet to the exact location where the Red Skull was standing, impaling him through the chest with one of the rods that protrudes from its nose. The Red Skull was taken to a hospital and kept alive long enough for Gail, his mother, to say her goodbyes. Red Skull explained to Fury that all he wanted to do with the Cosmic Cube was turn back time and prevent Steve Rogers from being lost during the war so that he could grow up with him and lead a normal life, rather than the one he was given. Petra Laskov, dressed as a doctor, then entered the room and shot Red Skull in the head, killing him. A short time later, Fury is fixing his damaged prosthetic arm while speaking with Gregory Stark. Gregory concludes that it was in fact Fury himself who hired the Red Skull to come out of retirement, in some sort of plot to resurrect Project Avengers, securing him a position in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s employment and eventually regaining his old title as Director. Fury told him that was how he got the job the first time, and expects the same outcome this time as well.Ultimate Comics: Avengers #6 Fury and his Avengers later faced threats from the Ghost RiderUltimate Comics: Avengers 2 #1-6 and a vampiric menace.Ultimate Comics: Avengers 3 #1-6 In \\"Ultimate Enemy\\", approximately six months after Ultimatum, Fury is Black OPS and is \\"Off the Grid\\". He was enjoying a meal while under cover when the restaurant he was at was attacked by a creature with energy powers. Fury manages to hold the creature at bay until Spider-Man and Human Torch arrive at the scene to investigate. The creature vanishes after a short battle with the three of them. Peter is surprised to see Fury alive, as he has not seen him for months.Ultimate Enemy #1 Nick breaks into the Triskelion and confronts Carol Danvers in the ladies' room and points a gun to her head, exclaiming that she is the only person who knew he was alive and would have motive to have him killed. The two fight before being interrupted by a female S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, informing Danvers that an attack has been made in Queens, which Fury knows is where the Parker residence is located. Simultaneously, the two order a Battalion of Hulkbuster agents to get to Queens to intercept the attacker, where they succeed in apprehending the monster attacking superhumans.Ultimate Enemy #3 Attempting to atone for his mistakes with Peter, Fury has taken on a more direct mentor role for Miles Morales as the new Spider-Man. When the Peter Parker of Earth-616 is sent to the Ultimate Universe, Fury interrogates him for information about his presence in this universe, accepting Peter's story that he came from another universe as nobody would come up with something that insane as a lie. Peter also notes that Ultimate Nick Fury is a lot cooler than the version Peter knows.Spider-Men #2 Attempting to atone for his mistakes with his Peter, Fury allows the other Peter to visit his counterpart's family,Spider-Men #4 and is satisfied when Peter gives Miles his blessing to become that world's new Spider-Man.Spider-Men #5 ===Taking on HYDRA, Formation of the Howling Commandos=== Nick joined HYDRA using a bio- camouflage to change his appearance under the name of \\"Scorpio\\" (resembling his classic mainstream look), stating that his motivations were to destroy the government that took everything away from him, although he still had a different agenda apart from Hydra's. The Ultimates managed to track him and tried to capture him, believing he was the traitor who provided Hydra with S.H.I.E.L.D. weapons. During an attack to Hydra's Death's Head camp, it was revealed Nick Fury was trying to destroy Hydra from the inside, while the S.H.I.E.L.D. traitor was actually Hydra leader Commander Crimson who used an Infinity Gem to battle her enemies, until a burst of energy made her disappear along with the artifact.Ultimate Comics: Ultimates #20 In the aftermath of the battle, Nick told Monica Chang he was planning to create his own team, the Howling Commandos, to battle Hydra the way the Ultimates couldn't, along ex- Hydra agent Abigail Brand. Before leaving, Chang told Fury he would be under her supervision.Ultimate Comics: Ultimates #21 ==Abilities and technologies== Like his Earth-616 counterpart, Nick Fury is an active physical man despite being over 80 years of age. Initially, he was not shown to use the Infinity Formula or other physical enhancements that his mainstream Marvel Universe counterpart possessed. However, Fury was later revealed to have served during World War II and was a test subject of the Super Soldier program (albeit as an unwilling participant). In this reality, the Super Soldier serum not only gave Fury low level super-human strength and agility but has also reduced his aging, allowing Fury to continue to be active despite his advanced chronological age.Ultimate Origins #2 (2008) Fury has had his right arm replaced with a cybernetic arm that gives him even greater strength than his enhanced biological original.Ultimates 2 #7 The exact level of his cybernetic arm has not been specifically revealed. Unlike his mainstream counterpart who retains his injured eye despite being legally blind in it with a 95% vision loss, Fury has actually lost his left eye. The skin around the left eye-socket is shown to be badly scarred, extending beyond the eye patch. Fury is an exceptional combatant and strategist and a gifted field leader. In his earliest appearances, he operated with technology years ahead of traditional forces, including the latest experimental weaponry, and some form of projected invisibility and the ability to walk through solid matter. These powers have very limited windows due to massive expense for any moment of \\"uptime\\"; costs for these run to the millions for less than a minute of use. He once used a chewing gum that was programmed to explode after 200 chews. The number of instances in which Fury uses these technologies has decreased since The Ultimates #1, and Fury is shown to primarily use conventional firearms. While General Fury was Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. he was constantly monitored and shadowed by dozens of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and all known observation technologies. After leaving S.H.I.E.L.D., Fury has shown that he knows how to elude all such monitoring devices to the point that he was able to enter the S.H.I.E.L.D helicarrier and attack the current Director Carol Danvers. ==In other media== Most appearances of Nick Fury in other media since the 2000s have been modeled on the Ultimate Marvel version of the character, most notably in the Marvel Cinematic Universe where he is portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson. ==References== ==External links== *World of Black Heroes: Nick Fury Biography * Category:Avengers (comics) characters Category:Comics characters introduced in 2001 Category:African-American superheroes Category:Fictional amputees Category:Fictional characters missing an eye Category:Fictional characters with slowed ageing Category:Fictional generals Category:Fictional Gulf War veterans Category:Fictional military strategists Category:Fictional spymasters Category:Fictional special forces personnel Category:Fictional Vietnam War veterans Category:Fictional World War II veterans Category:Fictional Yugoslav War veterans Category:Superhero film characters Category:Marvel Comics television characters Category:Ultimate Marvel characters Category:Characters created by Brian Michael Bendis Category:S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Category:Fictional United States Army personnel Category:Nick Fury ","title":"Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)"},{"id":"2201635","text":"Sharon Lowen is an Odissi dancer, trained since 1975 by Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra.

The book's title comes from a couplet in \\"Mary Don't You Weep\\", a Negro spiritual:Bernick, Michael. 21 August 2012. \\"Race, Intermarriage and 'The Fire Next Time' in California.\\" Fox & Hounds.Dupee, F. W. 1 June 1963. \\"James Baldwin and the 'Man'.\\" The New York Review of Books. The first essay, written in the form of a letter to Baldwin's 14-year-old nephew, discusses the central role of race in American history. The second essay, which takes up the majority of the book, deals with the relations between race and religion, focusing in particular on Baldwin's experiences with the Christian church as a youth, as well as the Islamic ideas of others in Harlem. The two essays were first respectively published in American magazines in late 1962: \\"Letter from a Region of My Mind\\" in The New Yorker, and \\"My Dungeon Shook\\" in The Progressive. They were then combined and published in book form in 1963 by Dial Press, and in 1964 in Britain by Penguin Books. Critics greeted the book enthusiastically; it is considered, by some, as one of the most influential books about race relations in the 1960s. It was released in an audiobook format in 2008, narrated by Jesse L. Martin. == Content == The book includes two essays that were written in the 1960s during a time of segregation between White and Black Americans. ===My Dungeon Shook=== The first essay, originally appearing in The Progressive magazine in 1962 and titled \\"My Dungeon Shook: Letter to My Nephew on the One Hundredth Anniversary of the Emancipation\\", is a letter to Baldwin‚Äôs nephew. in which he compares his nephew to the men in their family including Baldwin‚Äôs brother and father. He tells his nephew about America‚Äôs ability to destroy Black men and challenges his nephew to convert his anger due to mistreatment as a Black man into having a passionate and broad outlook on the Negro experience. ===Down at the Cross=== The second essay originally appeared in The New Yorker (1962) under the title \\"Letter from a Region in My Mind\\". Titled in the book as \\"Down at the Cross: Letter from a Region in my Mind\\", the essay addresses the detriment of Christianity on the Black community and how Baldwin‚Äôs journey of being a teen pastor to completely pulling away from the church because it felt like a repression of his full experience of humanity. He then recounts his dinner with Elijah Muhammad where Muhammad educated Baldwin on the Nation of Islam in hopes to get him to join that movement. In this section Baldwin describes how Black Muslims have made a \\"black god\\" to avoid the oppression of a \\"white god\\" that Christianity has established within the Black community. == Responses == Jacquelyn Dowd Hall wrote an article that focused on the civil rights movement, led by Martin Luther King Jr., building on Baldwin's work. Baldwin's piece examined the issue of racism mainly in his area of Harlem, New York, and Hall emphasized that the racial issue they confronted in America was not a sectional but a national problem. Another article that expands on Baldwin's new religious view was written by Jon Nilson, a theology professor. In The Fire Next Time, Baldwin focused on how Christianity was corrupted. Observing that Baldwin challenged the Catholic Church, Nilson said that the April 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. had almost seemed like The Fire Next Time had come true. In December 2016, Can I Get a Witness? The Gospel of James Baldwin, a 2016 musical theatrical tribute to Baldwin by the musician Meshell Ndegeocello and based on The Fire Next Time was premiered at the Harlem Stage in Harlem. In July 2015, Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote an article in The Atlantic as a modernized version of Baldwin's letter to his nephew called \\"Letter to My Son\\", and later published an entire book called Between the World and Me that talks about the current state of the Black experience in America. \\\\- The title was alluded to in Max Hastings' book America, 1968: The Fire This Time. == See also == * James Baldwin: A Soul on Fire * The New Jim Crow * Between the World and Me * Timeline of the civil rights movement == References Category:1963 non-fiction books Category:Essay collections by James Baldwin Category:Dial Press books Category:Works originally published in The New Yorker Category:Books about race and ethnicity ","title":"The Fire Next Time"},{"id":"2201645","text":"An Entry Sequenced Data Set (ESDS) is a type of data set used by the VSAM computer data storage system.

The parish has a population of 104. ==History== The remains of a Roman villa, dating from 222-386, were discovered on Cattle Hill in 1966. Bratton manor was held, like Wincanton, by Alfsi in 1066 and by Walter of Douai by the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, when it was known as Broctune meaning settlement on the brook. In the late 12th century land in the parish was given to Bruton Abbey, and later the lord of the manor were the Seymour family, whose name was incorporated into the village name. The parish of Bratton Seymour was part of the Norton Ferris Hundred. A junction of the A371 just south of the village is known as Jack White's Gibbet as it was the site of the hanging of White for the murder of Robert Sutton in 1730. ==Governance== The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Wincanton Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.

Although the scent is described as pleasant by some, there is some question about the possibility that these chemicals pose a health risk. == Chemical composition == Both the scent and what produces it vary somewhat in different kinds of cars. Most of the interior of an automobile consists of plastic held together with a number of adhesives and sealers. Such materials release volatile organic compounds, via outgassing or offgassing. These fumes are generally attributed mixtures of many different chemicals offgassing and to plasticizers, although their vapor pressures are very low and they are not considered volatile. Researchers tested more than 200 U.S. vehicles of model years 2011‚Äì2012 for chemicals such as organobromine compounds (associated with brominated flame retardants, or BFRs), organochlorine compounds (e.g., polyvinyl chloride, or PVC), and heavy metals that off-gas from various parts such as the steering wheel, dashboard, armrests and seats. Some recommend keeping new cars well ventilated while driving, especially during the summer. A 1995 analysis of the air from a new Lincoln Continental found over 50 volatile organic compounds, which were identified as coming from sources such as cleaning and lubricating compounds, paint, carpeting, leather and vinyl treatments, latex glue, and gasoline and exhaust fumes. An analysis two months after the initial one found a significant reduction in the chemicals. The researchers observed that the potential toxicity of many of these compounds could pose a danger to human health. The total volatile organic compound levels can reach 7,500 micrograms per cubic meter. Concentrations decayed approximately 90% over a three-week period. Over sixty chemical compounds were identified inside the interiors of the four vehicles in this study. In some instances the odor results from a manufacturing defect. According to official documents of Bentley Motors (BT26), an \\"obnoxious odor\\" in Bentley cars for model years 1999‚Äì2002 was traced to a rust inhibitor. In some cultures, the new car smell is not considered desirable and manufacturers work to eliminate it. == Health hazards == A two-year study released in 2001 by the CSIRO in Australia found several health problems associated with these chemicals. CSIRO research scientist, Dr Stephen Brown, reported anecdotal accounts of disorientation, headache, and irritation in some drivers of new cars. He measured pollutant levels in new cars that were sufficient to cause similar effects within minutes in controlled experiments by other researchers. Chemicals found in the cars included the carcinogen benzene, two other possible carcinogens cyclohexanone and styrene, and several other toxic chemicals. A more recent study in Japan found that the volatile organic chemicals in a new minivan were over 35 times the health limit the day after its delivery. In four months levels had fallen under the limit but increased again in the hot summer months, taking three years to permanently remain below the limit. The limits were set by the Japanese health ministry in response to more car owners suffering from sick building syndrome. A Daily Telegraph article on the study described the enjoyment of new car smell as \\"akin to glue-sniffing\\". Yet another study showed little toxicity in new car odors. == References == Category:Car culture Category:Odor Category:Air pollution Category:Transport and the environment Category:Car ownership ","title":"New car smell"},{"id":"2201668","text":"Brewham is a civil parish in Somerset, England, consisting of the villages of North Brewham and South Brewham, on either side of the river in the Brue Valley east of Bruton and south-west of Frome in the South Somerset district.

It is a small island, measuring only 3.5 miles (5.6 km) by 1.25 miles (2 km) and has a surface of 7.6 km¬≤. It lies approximately 25 miles (40 km) south of the island of St. Vincent. The population is about 1,700. A barrier reef runs along the Atlantic side of the island. The highest point on the island is Mount Royal. Two bays, Glossy and Friendship, are located on the southern side of the island. ==History== Some time prior to 200 B.C. a cultivated tribe called the Arawaks reached the island using dug-out canoes. These new residents brought plants, animals, and basic farming and fishing skills with them. They lived there for 1,500 years until the Caribs invaded the island. More than 200 years after Columbus laid eyes on St. Vincent, the Europeans established a kind of permanent settlement. Its mountainous and heavily forested geography allowed the Caribs to defend against European settlement here longer than on almost any other island in the Caribbean. After the Caribs were defeated on other islands they joined slaves who had escaped repression on Barbados by following the current and trade winds westward to St. Vincent, as well as those who had survived shipwrecks near St. Vincent and Bequia. The mixed descendants of the island warriors and the freed Africans, who became known as the Black Caribs, had a common distrust and disgust for the Europeans, and proved to be a fearsome foe. The Caribs feared complete domination so they allowed the French to construct a settlement on the island in 1719. The French brought slaves to work their plantations. By 1748, the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle officially declared St. Vincent and its surrounding islands to be a neutral island, controlled by neither Britain nor France. The two countries continued to contest control of the islands, however, until they were definitively ceded to the British in 1814. In 1951 universal adult suffrage was introduced in Saint Vincent and the GrenadinesGonsalves (1994), p. 74. and in 1979, it became an independent state within the British Commonwealth with a democratic government based on the British system. ==Climate== The average daytime temperatures range from . The driest season is from December to May. The coolest months are between November and February. ==Resort development== In the early 1990s the Canouan Resorts Development company was formed and secured lease for areas of the island to build two hotels - the former Raffles Resort site and Tamarind Beach Hotel site. At this point the building arm of the company built roads throughout Canouan (previously only dirt tracks), installed electricity to the island and residents houses and provided desalinated water for the first time. Prior to that, fresh water was brought by boat from St. Vincent on a regular basis. Locals not employed by the resort were forbidden admittance to the property as it was private property, although the beaches remained open for public use. It was announced that the resort would revert from Raffles/Fairmont Resorts back to Carenage Bay Resort on May 20, 2010.http://www.travelagentcentral.com/beach-resorts/canouan-island-resort- change-management-21159 The property then became Pink Sands Club which opened in 2016. In 2018 the newer section of the property became managed by Mandarin Oriental. The original villas and suites now make up Canouan Estate Resort & Villas. Located on the 1200 acre estate Canouan Estate Resort & Villas include a collection of luxury suites and villas. Amenities includes 4 beaches, 4 restaurants and bars, a Jim Fazio designed 18-hole golf course, non-motorized water sports, fitness center, hiking, complimentary kids club, snorkeling, diving, boating and fishing, the resort is open year-round. ==Education== There are 2 schools on Canouan - the Government Primary school and the independent Pelican School which is an accredited Cambridge International School. There is also an official Canouan Pre-school located close to the primary school. ==Transport== Plane Landing at Canouan. In 2008, the runway at Canouan Airport was lengthened to almost 6,000 feet to accommodate larger aircraft. It is now the jet port for the Grenadines.

The player controls Clarice in her Honda City hatchback and must paint every section of a highway throughout twelve stages, each taking place in a famous city from around the world. Clarice is constantly under pursuit by police cars, which she can take out by launching oil cans at them, temporarily stunning them, and then ramming into them with her car. It was released in North America by Kitkorp as Cruisin'. Jaleco would port the game to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and MSX. The NES release received mixed to positive reviews, although digital re-releases would receive a more negative reception. The NES release would be included in Jaleco Collection Vol. 1 in 2003 and in JaJaMaru Jr. Denshoki Jaleco Memorial a year later. Hamster Corporation released a digital version on the Wii Virtual Console in 2008 and the PlayStation 4 in 2015, the latter under their Arcade Archives label. The rights to City Connection are currently owned by a company named after such, City Connection, following the bankruptcy of Jaleco's parent company in 2014. A mobile phone sequel, City Connection Rocket, was available through i-mode in 2004. ==Gameplay== Arcade version screenshot, showing the player covering sections of road whilst avoiding police cars. The player takes control of Clarice, a blue-haired teen in her Honda City hatchback, in her efforts to travel the world in order to find herself the perfect man. Clarice traverses through twelve scrolling stages, all based on famous locations across the world (including Japan, China, Paris and Easter Island). After the twelfth stage, the game will simply loop back to the first at a higher difficulty. To clear each stage, the player must paint over all the roads by driving across them, changing the pavement color from white to green. The car can jump over large gaps to reach higher sections of the stage. Clarice is constantly under pursuit by police cars, and must avoid flag-waving cats that will block her from moving past them. By collecting oil cans found in each stage, the player can shoot these at police cars to temporary stun them, and knock them off the stage by ramming into them. Cats are invulnerable and cannot be defeated by any means. If the player remains on the same stage for an extended period of time, spikes will extrude from the ground, instantly causing them to lose a life. On occasion, a red-colored balloon may appear in the stage. Should the player collect three of these balloons, they will be warped to a new area and be granted with a large sum of bonus points. ==Development and release== City Connection was developed by Jaleco and first released in Japanese arcades in July 1985. The car the player controls is a Honda City hatchback, which is believed to be the source for the game's title. In North America, the game was licensed to Kitkorp and released as Cruisin‚Äô, though is identical to the original aside from the title. The song used when Clarice hits one of the flag-waving cats is ‚ÄúFlohwalzer‚Äù, known in Japan as ‚ÄúNeko Funjatta‚Äù (lit. ‚ÄúI Stepped on the Cat‚Äù). The game is one of the first to use a new music track for each stage rather than reusing a single song. One stage features a remix of the song ‚ÄúHighway Star‚Äù by Deep Purple. Ports of City Connection were released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Famicom, ZX Spectrum and MSX. The NES version replaces Clarice with an unnamed male protagonist, alongside other minor differences. The Famicom release was included in the Japan-only PlayStation compilation Jaleco Collection Vol. 1 in 2003, as well as the Game Boy Advance compilation JaJaMaru Jr. Denshoki Jaleco Memorial a year later. A digital re-release of the NES version was ported to the Wii Virtual Console in 2008 and later the 3DS and Wii U Virtual Console services in 2013. A mobile phone version was released on 23 September 2002. The arcade version was ported by Mediakite to Microsoft Windows in 2003, published first by PCCW Japan then later re-published in 2004 by Jaleco. A 2003 mobile port, titled City Connection DX, was released for the Japanese i-mode online service. In 2014, Hamster Corporation released a digital version of the game under their Arcade Archives series on the PlayStation 4, which was soon released on the Nintendo Switch in 2018. ==Reception== In Japan, Game Machine listed City Connection on their August 15, 1985 issue as being the twelfth most-successful table arcade unit of the year. The NES version in particular would receive a mixed reception. AllGame gave a positive review for the NES release, applauding its gameplay and graphics, concluding with ‚Äúwhile this game is not revolutionary by any means, it deserves to be played.‚Äù. Japanese magazine Yuge ranked it as one of the 100 best Family Computer games of all time, praising the visuals, gameplay and music. Computer Entertainer US concluded that the game is \\"enjoyable in the short run, but we doubt that it has sufficient staying power to keep most gamers playing it over and over again. Reviewing the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console digital release of the NES version, Nintendo Life and IGN would give a lukewarm reception - both would critcize its graphics and music for being too simplistic, alongside labeling its gameplay as difficult to understand for newcomers. Nintendo Life gave a similar negative response to the Wii U Virtual Console port of the NES release, concluding with \\"Steer clear of this one.\\" Eurogamer wrote that the Wii Virtual Console port of the NES version was ‚Äúcertainly not worth getting passionate about\\". ==Legacy== A sequel, City Connection Rocket, was developed by Studio Runba and released for Japanese mobile phones in 2004, available from Jaleco through i-mode. The game places Clarice as a spy for a secret organization to capture criminal leaders from around the world. Rather than painting sections of the road, Clarice must now collect briefcases placed in each stage whilst avoiding police cars and other types of enemies. This game was bundled with City Connection DX for a re-release under the Appli-Archives series for the PlayStation Vita, available for the PlayStation Mobile service. The service closed in September 2015, delisting the game from the PlayStation Store and other supported devices. Clarice would make an appearance as a playable character in GUNbare!

It is part of the country of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and is approximately from the nation's capital, Kingstown, on the main island, Saint Vincent. Bequia means \\"island of the clouds\\" in the ancient Arawak. The island's name was also 'Becouya' as part of the Grenadines. Bequia has a long tradition of whaling. Its people are allowed to catch up to four humpback whales per year using traditional hunting methods. The limit is rarely met, with no catch some years. ==Geography== Admiralty Bay Bequia in 1966 Bequia is a small island, measuring with a population of approximately 5,300. The native population are primarily a mixture of people of African, Scottish and Island Carib descent. A substantial number of white Barbadians also settled the Mount Pleasant area of Bequia in the 1860s. Many of their descendants still inhabit the area. Other highly populated areas include the island capital, Port Elizabeth, which hosts the ferry terminal and Paget Farm, which hosts the airport. There are also villages at Lower Bay, La Pompe, Hamilton and Belmont. Other prominent areas of Bequia include Spring, the site of a former coconut plantation and home to agricultural animals, Industry Bay and Park Bay, where the Old Hegg Turtle Sanctuary is located. The island's hills are much lower than the peaks of St. Vincent, to the north, so they do not receive as many rain showers. Princess Margaret, who had a home on nearby Mustique, visited Bequia in the 1950s and had a beach renamed in her honour. Princess Margaret Beach is next to Port Elizabeth and is situated inside Admiralty Bay on the west coast. The beach was originally known as Tony Gibbons, and continues to be known by that name locally, though the origin of this name is uncertain. Also on the west coast are the island's main port and a large natural harbour. Port Elizabeth Bequia in 2005 ==Tourism== Gingerbread House. Bequia. 1967 Bequia is popular among cruising yachts, expats and tourists. One of the busiest times of the year is the annual Easter Regatta and Music Fest. Two scuba diving stores run dive trips to 28 identified dive sites around Bequia. There are several wrecks and shallow caves accessible to advanced divers. It is not unusual to see Hawksbill turtles, lobsters, moray eels and many kinds of fish when diving around Bequia. ==History== Map of Bequia As a result of the Treaty of Utrecht, which brought an end to the War of Spanish Succession and established peace between the Spanish and British Empires, Great Britain obtained the lucrative monopoly over the Asiento slave trade. Runaway and shipwrecked slaves inhabited the island of St. Vincent in the 17th century. According to an early account of the French West Indies, which considered Bequia as part of Grenada, Bequia was too inaccessible to colonize and Caribs and Arawaks used the island for fishing and farming. A few Portuguese and Dutch slave ships en route to Sint Eustatius from West Africa reportedly shipwrecked on the Grenadine reefs. Bequia was under French control in the 18th century and during the Seven Years' War with England, the island was used by the fleets of their Spanish and Dutch allies to take on supplies, while British ships were banned. The 1763 Treaty of Paris produced a significant re-alignment in the map of the Caribbean; St. Vincent and the Grenadine islands, including Grenada, were given to the British in exchange for Guadeloupe, Martinique and St. Lucia. The name Petit Martinique comes from this era, as does Petit Saint Vincent. In 1779 the French seized the island, despite the treaty, but were forced to relinquish control to Britain again soon after. The early 18th century saw the development of a sugar industry and the production of related products including molasses and rum. Other major produce included coffee, indigo and arrowroot. At one point in time, the islands of St. Vincent and the Grenadines were the single largest producer of arrowroot starch in the world. Currently, Hairoun and Vincy strong rum are major export products primarily to the European Union. Under a programme instituted by Great Britain to give land to indigent settlers, James Hamilton, father of Alexander Hamilton, moved from St. Croix to Bequia in 1774 where he remained until 1790. The land granted to Hamilton lies along the shore of Southeast Bay. Despite his son's frequent gifts of money and entreaties to immigrate or at least visit him, neither visited the other. Some historians believe that the famous pirate Edward Teach had his base in Bequia. The opening shot of the movie Blackbeard, Pirate of the Caribbean, made by the BBC, displays a replica of his first ship off the coast of Bequia in the St. Vincent passage. According to local legend, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was not only Teach's base, but also the place from which Sir Francis Drake planned his attacks on the Spanish admiralty in Don Blas de Lezo's Cartagena. Indeed, it is thought that Henry Morgan may also have anchored in Admiralty Bay, as it was then the safest natural harbour in the Eastern Caribbean during hurricane season. Bequia was used as a repair facility for ships. Beside Nelson's Dockyard on Antigua, and the Carlyle in Bridgetown, Barbados, there were no other drydocks or shipyards in the area. Wooden shipbuilding and ship-repair on Bequia was possible due to the presence of cedar trees on the island and a sufficiently deep and sheltered harbour. ==Whaling== Boy carrying whale meat Bequia is one of the few places in the world where limited whaling is still allowed. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) classifies the island's hunt under the regulations concerning aboriginal whaling. Natives of Bequia are allowed to catch up to four humpback whales per year using only traditional hunting methods of hand-thrown harpoons in small, open sailboats. The limit is rarely met, with no catch some years. Bequia has a long tradition of whaling as well as the building of whaling boats. In the 2012 meeting of the IWC, the delegates renewed the annual quota of whales for all three groups who submitted joint bids: Alaskan Inupiat, Russian indigenous people in Chukotka in eastern Siberia, and St Vincent and the Grenadines, despite protestations of delegates from Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Chile, and Costa Rica. Dominican Republic delegate Peter Sanchez said the St Vincent and the Grenadines hunt was \\"artisanal whaling out of control,\\" and that the hunters have \\"repeatedly broken the rules‚Äîhunting for young ones and pregnant females.\\" Other delegates pointed out that St. Vincent and the Grenadines' bid \\"should not qualify under ASW [Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling] rules because the Bequians, the group that maintains the hunt, are not truly indigenous.\\" Monaco delegate Frederic Briand argued that whaling \\"started by a settler's family as recently as 1875 does not qualify as 'aboriginal'.\\" Louise Mitchell Joseph, speaking on behalf of the Eastern Caribbean Coalition of Environmental Awareness stated that there was no documented history of whaling in the islands, and that \\"there have been many archaeological excavations conducted, and there was no evidence found whatsoever of whale hunting by aboriginal peoples. Neither whale remains nor weapons that could have been used to kill such a large mammals were ever found; neither are any images of whales inscribed on our petroglyphs.\\" There is a small whaling museum on the island chronicling local whaling's history. A feature of the Port Elizabeth waterfront is the Whale Boner Bar & Restaurant. This bar has an entrance onto the beach consisting of an arch of two whale ribs, as well as whale vertebrae mounted on the bar seats and a whale rib running the length of the bar. == Transportation Air=== Erected in 1992, the James F. Mitchell International Airport for small planes is located near Paget Farm. With a runway length of , Bequia can be reached by plane with daily connections from Kingstown, Bridgetown and surrounding islands. ===Sea=== Regularly scheduled ferries run from the main island of Saint Vincent. Three ferries operate between the capital, Kingstown, and the local port of Port Elizabeth. The other islands in the Grenadines can be reached by the last operational schooner in the Caribbean, the antique original Bequia-built SS Friendship Rose, as well as other charter/tour boats that are widely available and based in Port Elizabeth, islands for matches. The ferry offers daytime as well as overnight charters, and onboard picnics are locally renowned. This has resulted in significant increases in mostly domestic tourism. The ferry pier is located 45 minutes' drive from Argyle International Airport and is served by two companies, Bequia Express and Admiralty Transport. Bequia Express uses a family-owned ferry that is long with a cargo space measuring of which is sheltered with a ceiling. The approximate capacity of the ship is 28 cars or 10 to 20 containers and is licensed for 400 passengers. The Admiral II is a similarly-sized vessel with a capacity for 250 passengers. Travellers on the Admiral II have a choice between air-conditioned indoor seating or covered outdoor seating. The passage between Kingstown and Port Elizabeth is a trip taking approximately one hour. Pedestrians such as hitchhikers and backpackers have the option of the Grenadines mail boat which travels to Port Elizabeth at irregular intervals. The mail boat calls at Canouan, Mayreau and Union islands although boarding at Mayreau can be difficult, as the vessel remains in deeper waters, with passengers being required to embark and leave through the use of smaller craft, which land on the nearby beach. ==Communications== The island has a variety of communication systems including standard telephone and fax lines, a mobile network, and internet access. The old telex system still operates. Bequia has its own heavy-duty, long-range shortwave radio antenna. Many inhabitants use the marine VHF radio system on channel 68 for local communication. ==Publications== Considering the size of the island, Bequia has a large publications industry. Various publishers, editors, and writers work on the island, as do painters and graphic designers. ==See also== *Moonhole ‚Äì a private community on Bequia ==References== Notes Bibliography * * Category:Islands of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines ","title":"Bequia"},{"id":"2201706","text":"The Chingay Parade is an annual street parade held in Malaysia and Singapore in celebration with the birthdays of the Chinese deities or the procession of the Goddess of Mercy (Guanyin) as part of the Chinese New Year festivities.Chingay Parade in Singapore The term Chingay itself originated from the Chinese communities of Southeast Asia, which is a phonetic equivalent of both the Chinese words \\"ÁúüËâ∫\\" (zhƒìny√¨) which means \\"true art\\" in the Penang version, and \\"Â¶ÜËâ∫,\\" (zhuƒÅngy√¨) which means \\"a decorated miniature stage\\" or float in the Singapore version.

Chingay procession was held in celebration with the birthdays of the Chinese deities or the procession of the Goddess of Mercy (Guanyin). It was held to worship and enjoy with the deity. During the earliest procession in more than 100 years ago, the earliest English newspapers Echo in Malaysia adopted the word Chingay Procession for this special event.Penang Chingay Association (2007).

Today, in Malaysia and Singapore, Chingay is not only performed by the Chinese, but the art has successfully attracted the Malays and Indians. It has become a unique multiracial performance. The popularity of Chingay in Penang has made it one of the very impressive cultural landmarks as well as an important tourist attraction.Penang State Tourism Development & Culture (2009).

The Chingay Parade traces its origins to a float decorating competition held in Penang in 1905. This practice of float decoration spread to the rest of Malaya by the 1960s, and eventually became associated with the Chinese New Year. The second Chingay procession was held in 1926 in celebration of the birthday of the God of Prosperity. The third Chingay procession was held in 1957 to celebrate the centenary of the City Council of George Town. In the pursuit of ensuring the perpetual existence of Chingay, Chinese community in Malaysia worked hand in hand to call for the enthusiasts of various areas in forming the liaison committee of Penang Chingay in 1960s.Penang Chingay Association (2007). 40 years ago, a group of Chinese community leaders. A Chingay parade is now held annually within the city of George Town every December. The yearly event, which has attracted locals and tourists alike, starts in the evening from Brick Kiln Road (now Gurdwara Road), snaking through the city streets before ending at the Esplanade. ===Johor=== Johor Old Temple Chingay in Johor Bahru The Chingay parade in Johor are held annually by the Johor Bahru Old Chinese Temple on the 21st day of the first month of the Lunar New Year since the 1870.https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/02/14/scaled-down-chingay- festival-proceeds-despite- covid-19-outbreakhttps://www.malaysia.travel/en/my/events/2019/2/chingay- festivalIt is joined by the five main clans in the state, which are Cantonese, Hainanese, Hakka, Hoklo and Teochew. ==Chingay in Singapore== Singapore Chingay parade in 2005. On 4 February 1973, the first Singapore Chingay parade was held partly as a result of the ban on firecrackers a year earlier in 1972 as a result of fire hazards. This ban was viewed unfavourably despite the safety issues involved. Some people felt that the ban would result in a much dampened festival mood for the Chinese New Year period. To address this issue, the People's Association and the Singapore National Pugilistic Association jointly organised a street parade from Jalan Besar to Outram Park featuring the signature floats, acrobatic acts, lion and dragon dances, stilt walkers, and the like, to bring back some cheer to the general public. The largely Chinese parade became a multi-cultural one from 1977 when Malay and Indian groups started joining in the performances, which was to mark a major precedent in the overall flavour of the parade into one which has become largely multi-cultural in character, despite the continued presence of traditional Chinese acts such as lion dances and stilt walkers to this day. In 1985, the parade marched down Orchard Road for the first time, a move which was to prevail for much of the parade's subsequent history. Although the change could be attributed to the desire of organisers in bringing it closer to tourists along the major tourist belt and for ease of organisation on a relatively long and straight stretch of road, it also further signified the increasingly desinicized character of the parade. This is further evidenced when in 1987, an international flavour was added to the parade when a group from Japan participated for the first time with their float sponsored by The Straits Times. The Chingay Parade became an evening-to-night parade in 1990, changing the overall feel of the parade towards one in which lights and pyrotechnics dominate. In 2000, the parade was shifted out of Orchard Road to the Civic District centering at City Hall, an area steeped in Singaporean history and culture. Construction works at the City Hall area resulted in the parade marching through the streets of the Chinatown district for the first time. Faced with limited space for spectator stands and a much more complicated and winding route in these locations, however, the parade moved back to Orchard Road in 2004 along with an effort to introduce audience participation and involvement in the traditionally passive parade. Firecrackers were let off for the first time in the parade that year. Despite the authorities allowing the firecrackers to be let off under some safety procedures, it was decided that the Chingay be preserved. In 2008, the parade was once again held at City Hall, with the route lasting from the City Hall building to The Esplanade. For the 2009 parade, it was centralised around Parliament House with the performers going around the Padang and also featured a magical Grand Finale (MAGICBOX@Chingay 2009). That year was also the first year that the telecast on television was delayed by one day. In 2010, the parade took place on part of the Formula One Marina Bay Street Circuit route. Post-parade street parties have been held since 2004, with the exception of 2007. An estimated 150,000 spectators attended the 2009 Chingay Parade on 1 February. One million Singaporeans watched the parade on television and another 16.3 million homes and hotels across Asia received the television broadcast through Channel NewsAsia. The 2011 Chingay Parade was held on the 11 and 12 February. It opened with a Fire Party, and included the largest moving multi-ethnic performances, the first travelling dance competition within the parade, a spectacular finale where thousands of performers flooded the parade ground holding candle lights and an inaugural colourful Arts District/ Carnival.Chingay 2011 Singapore highlights It also included activities in which the public could participate, such as the Teresa Teng Look-Alike Photo Contest and the Chingay Paparazzi competition. The 2013 Chingay parade was held on 22 and 23 February. In 2014, Chingay was held on 7 and 8 February at the F1 Pit Building. Some 70,000 individuals ushered in The Year of the Horse. The 2015 Chingay was planned to involve some 11,000 performers from 150 organisations, including 760 overseas performers from 15 groups, in the largest celebration yet. Themed \\"We love Singapore(SG)\\", the main Chingay 2015 was planned to be held at the F1 Pit Building on February 27 and 28, while a street party along Orchard Road involving youths would be held on 1 March. The 2018 Chingay involved 2,000 parade volunteers and 6,500 parade performers, and also featured many examples of smart technology, including dancing robots and driverless cars. The 2018 Chingay was the first year to have a free street parade and carnival as part of the celebration, and followed a 1.5 kilometre route, double the length of the usual 720 metres. The 2019 Chingay was purposed to commemorate Singapore's Bicentennial such that understanding of the island nation's history expanded beyond marking 200 years of Sir Stamford Raffles' arrival on the shores of Singapore in 1819 to a beginning that was even earlier at 1299 when the Kingdom of Singapura (also known as Temasek) was established. The theme for Chingay 2019, ‚ÄòDreams Funtasia‚Äô, recognised the significance of the past, present and future of Singapore. ==Notes== == External links == * * * Interactive 360 images of Singapore Chingay 2011 Parade * Chingay's Big Flag display * Emoxis- Chingay * Chingay Parade 2010 Photos * Chingay Festival in Singapore 2013 Video Category:Festivals in Singapore Category:Events in Malaysia ","title":"Chingay parade"},{"id":"2201710","text":"A Relative Record Data Set (RRDS) is a type of data set organization used by the VSAM computer data storage system.

Family and Consumer Sciences Knowledge Bowl is a three-level, team competition that challenges students‚Äô knowledge of all aspects of family and consumer sciences. == Facilities == The current school building was designed by the Jonesboro firm Little and Associates. This replaced the original building destroyed by a tornado on May 27, 1973. They were not allowed to build a structure larger than two stories. They were also limited on the number of windows in the structure due to the laws on public school buildings in place at the time. This kept them from restoring the beautiful original colonial-style building. After a special election, the district was awarded additional funding through a millage increase. Part of this increase will be used towards the construction of new facilities and upgrading of previous ones. JHS benefited from a complete overhaul of its current Don Riggs Hurricane Gym and a newly constructed Performing Arts Center intended to seat over 1000 people.

On 28 June 1917, 242.8 mm of rain fell in 24 hours, leaving a watermark on a pub 20 feet above mean level. In 1984 a protective dam was built 1 km upstream. ==History== The Church of St Mary, Bruton was founded by Ine of Wessex in the 7th century, Bruton was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Briuuetone, meaning 'Vigorously flowing river' from the Old English tor and Celtic briw meaning vigour. The river has been the site of several watermills and in 2003 the South Somerset Hydropower Group installed their first hydroelectric turbine at Gants Mill at nearby Pitcombe.Mirage and oasis: Energy choices in an age of global warming , New Economics Foundation, , published June 2005, accessed 11 June 2007Case Study ‚Äì Gants Mill , British Hydropower Association, published 2004, accessed 11 June 2007. It was the site of Bruton Abbey, a medieval Augustinian priory from which a wall remains in the Plox close to Bow Bridge. The priory was sold after the dissolution of the monasteries to the courtier Sir Maurice Berkeley (died 1581), whose Bruton branch of the Berkeley family converted it into a mansion then demolished in the late 18th century. The Dovecote which overlooks Bruton was built in the sixteenth century. It was at one time used as a house, possibly as a watchtower and as a dovecote. It is a Grade II* listed building and ancient monument. It is managed by the National Trust. The building was once within the deerpark of the Abbey. It was adapted by the monks from a gabled Tudor tower. The conversion to be a dovecote took place around 1780. It has over 200 pigeon holes. Bruton was part of the hundred of Bruton. Bruton is referenced in a well-known English folk song, The Bramble Briar. A rare copy of an Inspeximus of Magna Carta was found in Bruton in the 1950s and claimed by King's School, Bruton. The sale of the copy to the Australian National Museum paid for much building work at the school. Much of the town's history is shown at the Bruton Museum in the Dovecote Building in the High Street, along with a tourist information office. Bruton Museum Society, formed in 1989, involves the community and local schools in developing the collection of local artefacts. It was initially housed beneath the Co-Op, then in a disused coach house owned by a bank. The museum moved in 1999 to its current location, which was jointly purchased by South Somerset District Council and Bruton Town Council. The time spent in the town by John Steinbeck is commemorated in the museum. It has also organised exhibitions at King's School, including one in 2008 of the work of Ernst Blensdorf. In 2010 an anonymous donor agreed to pay the rent on the building, removing earlier doubts about its future viability. In December 2012 plans were announced by Hauser & Wirth to open a gallery and arts centre at a derelict farm on the outskirts on Bruton. This occurred on 14 September 2014. ==Governance== The town council has responsibility for local issues. It sets an annual precept (local rate) to cover its operating costs and produces annual accounts for public scrutiny. The town council evaluates local planning applications and works with local police, district council officers and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security and traffic. It initiates projects for maintaining and repairing parish facilities, and consults with the district council on maintenance, repair and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also covered. The town falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 It had previously been part of Wincanton Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and costliest local services, such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. Bruton falls in the Somerton and Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system. ==Transport== Bruton railway station lies on the Great Western Main Line, in a section often referred to as the Berks and Hants route, between Westbury and Taunton. The route is the most direct between London (Paddington) and the West Country (ending at Penzance), but is slower for geographical reasons. The stretch between Westbury and Castle Cary is also part of the Heart of Wessex line, served by Great Western Railway services between Bristol Temple Meads and Weymouth. Until 12 December 2015, Bruton was served only by rail services between Bristol and Weymouth. In December 2015, South West Trains introduced a rail service between London Waterloo, Salisbury and Yeovil Pen Mill, giving Bruton its first direct London service for some years. This runs to London Waterloo four times a day on Monday to Friday, with three return journeys. Bus services are operated by South West Coaches: route 667 Monday‚ÄìSaturday, route 1B Monday‚ÄìSaturday, route 1C schooldays only, route 19 Friday only, route 33 Wednesday only and route 34 term-time only. ==Geography== Work to build the railway line at Bruton Railway Cutting exposed geology of the epoch of the Middle Jurassic. It is one of the best places in England to demonstrate the stratigraphic distinction of ammonites in the subcontractus zone and the morrisi zone.English Nature citation sheet for the site Accessed 7 August 2006. The nearby Godminster Lane Quarry and Railway Cutting is another geological Site of Special Scientific Interest, for study of the Inferior Oolite limestones, of the Middle Jurassic age, laid down in a warm shallow sea some 175 million years ago. The site is unique in that the limestones seen here are more closely comparable with rocks of similar age found in the Cotswolds than with rock sequences seen elsewhere in Somerset. However, the rocks contain the rich assemblage of fossil ammonites typical of the north Dorset/south Somerset area. This feature, along with the unusual limestone sequence, makes the site unique. It is also important as a reference for three sub-divisions (zones) of the Inferior Oolite ‚Äì the laeviscula, discites and concavum Zones.English Nature citation sheet for the site Accessed 10 August 2006. ==Churches== Church of St Mary, Bruton Both the 14th- century Church of St Mary, and the Church of the Holy Trinity, in Wyke Champflower, dated at 1623, are Grade I listed buildings. John Wesley preached in Bruton in 1776. A Methodist chapel at West End was opened in 1848. The congregation was served by the Somerset Mission Circuit and more recently by the Somerset Mendip Circuit.Churches. Retrieved 1 January 2016. ==Schools== Bruton is known for three popular secondary schools ‚Äì King's School, Bruton (founded 1519); Sexey's School (founded 1889); and Bruton School for Girls (Sunny Hill) (founded 1900). Each has a sixth form, and a tradition of boarding. One of Bruton's notable historic characters was Hugh Sexey (1556‚Äì1619), who was born in the local area and attended Bruton Grammar School. By the age of 43 he had been appointed as Royal auditor of the Exchequer to Queen Elizabeth I and later King James I. After his death the trustees of his will established Sexey's Hospital in Bruton as an institution to care for the elderly. Sexey's trust was mainly involved with educational causes. The politician behind the Education Act 1902, Henry Hobhouse, MP (1854‚Äì1937), was involved in the founding of Sexey's School and Sunny Hill. ==References== ==External links== *British History Online - Bruton Parish Detailed local history. *British History Online - Bruton Hundred Detailed local history for the wider Bruton area. *The Somerset Urban Archaeological Survey: Bruton, by Miranda Richardson * *Bruton Town Official town website. *Bruton Town Council Category:Towns in South Somerset Category:Market towns in Somerset Category:Civil parishes in Somerset ","title":"Bruton"},{"id":"2201719","text":"Edward Leslie Grant (May 21, 1883 ‚Äì October 5, 1918), was an American third baseman in Major League Baseball who became one of the few major leaguers who were killed in World War I. ==Biography== Eddie Grant as Captain during World War I He was born on May 21, 1883 in Franklin, Massachusetts. After completing high school in 1901, Grant attended Dean Academy (now Dean College) in Franklin for a year before enrolling at Harvard University (earning him the nickname \\"Harvard Eddie\\"). While at Harvard, Grant was a member of the freshman basketball and baseball teams. He played varsity basketball for the Crimson during his sophomore year in 1903, and was set to play varsity baseball the following spring until he was declared ineligible for playing in a professional independent baseball league the previous summer. He graduated from Harvard University with an undergraduate degree in 1905 and a law degree in 1909. Grant entered the majors with the Cleveland Naps at the very end of the season as an emergency replacement for an ailing Nap Lajoie. He played in the minor leagues in 1906, but returned to the majors with the Philadelphia Phillies in , and was the Phillies' starting third baseman from ‚Äì1910. Grant batted leadoff for the Phillies, but was known more for his fielding and base stealing than his bat. His best year was , when he batted .268, drove in 67 runs, and stole 25 bases. Traded to the Cincinnati Reds in , he batted just .223, his last year as a starter. Grant was traded again to the New York Giants in the middle of the season, where he finished his career as a utility infielder. Grant appeared in two games of the 1913 World Series, once as a pinch runner and once as a pinch hitter. He retired after the season. His lifetime batting average was .249. Perhaps because of his Harvard background, Grant refused to call for a fly ball by yelling, \\"I got it!\\" Instead, he would only say what he regarded as the more grammatically correct, \\"I have it!\\" ==Post-career== Grant in 1913 as a member of the New York Giants. Upon his retirement from baseball, Grant opened a law practice in Boston. Grant was one of the first men to enlist when the United States entered World War I in April 1917, and he served as a captain in the 77th Infantry Division. During the fierce battle of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, all of Grant's superior officers were killed or wounded, and he took command of his troops on a four-day search for the \\"Lost Battalion.\\" During the search, an exploding shell killed Grant on October 5, 1918. He was the first Major League Baseball player killed in action in World War I.Crazy ‚Äô08: How a cast of Cranks, Rogues, Boneheads and Magnates created the Greatest Year in Baseball History, p. 111, by Cait Murphy, Smithsonian Books, a Division of Harper Collins, 2007, He was buried at the Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery in Lorraine, France. Grant was one of eight Major League Baseball players known either to have been killed or died from illness while serving in the armed forces during World War I. The others were Alex Burr‚Äö Harry Chapman, Larry Chappell‚Äö Harry Glenn‚Äö Newt Halliday, Ralph Sharman and Bun Troy. ==Legacy== On Memorial Day, May 30, 1921, representatives from the armed forces, baseball, and the sisters of Grant unveiled a monument in center field of the Polo Grounds to his memory.Associated Press. \\"Landis Helps Dedicate Memorial to Eddie Grant\\". The Gazette Times. May 31, 1921. Retrieved 2018-07-03. During the celebration at the end of the last Giants' game in , someone pried the plaque from its monument. It was missing for over 40 years until it was claimed to be re- discovered in a Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey home that had been owned by a New York City police officer. However, the photo shown of the supposed plaque on the Internet does not look like the missing plaque from the Polo Grounds, which has now been replicated at the San Francisco Giants current ballpark as of 2006. Grant is also memorialized with the Edward L. Grant Highway in The Bronx, New York and by Grant Field at Dean College. ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball career stolen bases leaders ==References== ==External links== , or BR Bullpen, or Flickr, or Retrosheet, or SABR Biography Project, or The Baseball Almanac, or The Baseball Cube, or The DeadBall Era Category:1883 births Category:1918 deaths Category:American men's basketball players Category:American military personnel killed in World War I Category:Baseball players from Massachusetts Category:Burials at Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery Category:Cincinnati Reds players Category:Cleveland Naps players Category:Harvard Crimson men's basketball players Category:Harvard Law School alumni Category:Jersey City Skeeters players Category:Major League Baseball third basemen Category:Montpelier-Barre players Category:New York Giants (NL) players Category:People from Franklin, Massachusetts Category:Philadelphia Phillies players Category:United States Army officers ","title":"Eddie Grant (baseball)"},{"id":"2201720","text":"Undiscovered country may refer to: *Undiscovered Country, the 1979 play by Tom Stoppard * The Undiscovered Country, the 1998 album (and song) by the Swedish band Destiny * \\"The undiscover'd country...\\", from the \\"To be, or not to be\\" soliloquy in Hamlet * Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, a 1991 film ","title":"Undiscovered country"},{"id":"2201721","text":"nymph -- dorsal view Triatoma infestans 1st instar nymph feeding on a human host Triatoma infestans, commonly called winchuka (vinchuca) in Argentina, Bolivia and Chile, barbeiro in Brazil, chipo in Venezuela and also known as \\"kissing bug\\" or \\"barber bug\\" in English, is a blood-sucking bug (like virtually all the members of its subfamily Triatominae) and the most important vector of Trypanosoma cruzi which can lead to Chagas disease.

His parents were George Dawson, Sr. and Katie Ruth Marston Skidmore. After taking an academic course from the Rev. Dr. Cumming, Dawson attended the county academy in Greensboro, and then was graduated from Franklin College, Athens, Clarke County, Georgia, in 1816 at the age of eighteen. He studied law for a year in the office of the Hon. Thomas W. Cobb, at Lexington, Oglethorpe County, Georgia, and then in the Litchfield Law School of judges Tapping Reeve and James Gould at Litchfield, Connecticut. In 1818, he was admitted to the bar. Dawson set up a practice in Greensboro, where he was a successful jury lawyer. He was known for his ability to settle cases out of court. In 1819 he married Henrietta M. Wingfield. They had eight children. His wife died in 1850. Dawson remarried in 1854 to Eliza M. Williams of Memphis, Tennessee. Dawson was elected as one of the vice presidents of the Alumni Society of the University of Georgia at its first meeting, on August 4, 1834. ==Political and military career== He was elected Clerk of the Georgia House of Representatives in 1821 and served twelve years in that post. From 1828, he compiled Dawson's Digest of Laws of Georgia, published in 1831. From 1834 to 1835 he served as a state Senator. In 1836 he was Captain of Volunteers under General Winfield Scott in the Creek and Seminole Indian War in Florida. Dawson was elected as a States' Rights candidate to the United States House of Representatives for the 24th United States Congress in a special election to fill the vacancy caused by the death of General John E. Coffee, taking office on December 26, 1836. He was re-elected as a Whig to the 25th, 26th, and 27th Congresses. He served from November 7, 1836, to November 13, 1841. He was the Whig candidate for Governor of Georgia in 1841 but was defeated by Charles James McDonald. He thought his defeat as gubernatorial candidate meant that voters disapproved of his congressional service, particularly his vote earlier in the year to tax coffee and tea. He resigned from Congress. During his service in the United States House, Dawson chaired the Committee on Mileage (25th Congress), the Committee on Claims (26th Congress), and the Committee on Military Affairs (27th Congress). He was appointed by Governor George W. Crawford to fill a vacancy as Judge of the Ocmulgee Circuit Court in 1845, but he declined to run as a candidate for the bench at the completion of his term. Dawson was elected by the state legislature in November 1847 as the Whig candidate for Georgia's Class 3 seat in the United States Senate for the 31st, 32nd, and 33rd Congresses, serving from March 4, 1849, to March 3, 1855. Dawson supported the compromises that preserved the union in 1850. He chaired the Committee on Private Land Claims (32nd Congress) and presided over the Southern convention at Memphis in 1853. He was twice a delegate to the convention to amend the U.S. Constitution. ==Freemason== Dawson was initiated to the Scottish Rite Freemasonry at the \\"San Marino\\" Lodge No. 34, Greensboro, GA. He was elected Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons in Georgia on November 8, 1843 and served in that capacity until his death in 1856. While in Congress, he was active in local Freemasonry. The Dawson Lodge in Washington, D.C. and the Dawson Lodge in Social Circle, Georgia were named for him. ==Death and legacy== Dawson died in Greensboro on May 5, 1856, and was buried in Greensboro Cemetery with Masonic rites following a service in the Presbyterian church. A historical sign was placed in his honor in Greensboro. Because of his elegant manners, he was called \\"the first gentleman of Georgia\\" by Joseph Henry Lumpkin. Joshua Reed Giddings described him: \\"He was a man of much suavity of manner; one of that class of Southern statesmen who felt it necessary to carry every measure by the influence of personal kindness, and an expression of horror at all agitation of the slave question, under the apprehension that it might dissolve the Union.\\" Dawson County, Georgia, and the county seat, Dawsonville, were named for William Crosby Dawson. The county was created by a legislative act on December 3, 1857, primarily out of Lumpkin County and small parts of Gilmer, Pickens and Forsyth counties. Dawson, the county seat of Terrell County, Georgia was incorporated on December 22, 1857 and named for William Crosby Dawson. Company C, 3d Regiment, Georgia Volunteer Infantry, Army of Northern Virginia, C.S.A., from Greene County, was called the \\"Dawson Grays\\" in his honor. ==Bibliography== * NB: has error in date admitted to bar. * A collection of family records, with biographical sketches and other memoranda of various families and individuals bearing the name Dawson, or allied to families of that name.

He was born in Hornsby, New South Wales, Australia. He is the father of former Australian Davis Cup player Sandon Stolle. ==Career== Stolle is notable for being the only male player in history to have lost his first five Grand Slam singles finals, the fifth of which he led by two sets to love. However, Stolle went on to win two Grand Slam tournament singles titles, the 1965 French Championships and the 1966 US Championships. At Wimbledon and the Australian Championships he finished as runner-up in these tournaments and losing to compatriot Roy Emerson on no fewer than five occasions. Lance Tingay of The Daily Telegraph ranked Stolle as World No. 2 in 1966. Stolle won ten Grand Slam doubles titles, partnering with compatriots Bob Hewitt (4 titles), Roy Emerson (4 titles) and Ken Rosewall (2 titles). In addition Stolle won 7 Grand Slam mixed doubles titles. As a member of the Australian Davis Cup team Stolle won the Davis Cup title in 1964, 1965 and 1966. In 1964 Stolle and Emerson were briefly suspended from the Australian Davis Cup team for going on an overseas tour in defiance of a Lawn Tennis Association of Australia order to remain in Australia until April. Stolle turned professional in 1966, and as a pro, won two singles and 13 doubles titles. He earned about US$500,000 in career prize money. Stolle coached Vitas Gerulaitis from 1977 until 1983. For many years, Stolle did TV commentary for ESPN and other tennis broadcasts. He currently provides commentary on Grand Slam tennis tournaments for Australia's Fox Sports and the Nine Network. ==Honours== For his contribution to the tennis sport Fred Stolle was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1985. In 1988 he was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame. He received an Australian Sports Medal in 2000 and was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2005. In 2020, Stolle was awarded the ITF Philippe Chatrier Award, for his contribution to tennis both during his career and post-retirement. ==Grand Slam finalsSingles (2 titles, 6 runners-up)=== { class=\\"sortable \\" !style=\\"width:40px\\"Result !style=\\"width:40px\\"Year !style=\\"width:170px\\"Championship !style=\\"width:50px\\"Surface !style=\\"width:170px\\"Opponent !style=\\"width:180px\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"Score -cfc;\\"  ffa07a;\\"Loss 1963  Wimbledon Grass  Chuck McKinley 7‚Äì9, 1‚Äì6, 4‚Äì6 -ffc;\\"  ffa07a;\\"Loss 1964  Australian Championships Grass Roy Emerson  3‚Äì6, 4‚Äì6, 2‚Äì6 -cfc;\\"  ffa07a;\\"Loss 1964  Wimbledon Grass  Roy Emerson  1‚Äì6, 10‚Äì12, 6‚Äì4, 3‚Äì6 -ccf;\\"  ffa07a;\\"Loss 1964  US Championships Grass  Roy Emerson4‚Äì6, 2‚Äì6, 4‚Äì6 -ffc;\\"  ffa07a;\\"Loss 1965  Australian ChampionshipsGrass  Roy Emerson  9‚Äì7, 6‚Äì2, 4‚Äì6, 5‚Äì7, 1‚Äì6 -ebc2af;\\"  98fb98;\\"Win 1965French ChampionshipsClay Tony Roche3‚Äì6, 6‚Äì0, 6‚Äì2, 6‚Äì3 -cfc;\\"  ffa07a;\\"Loss 1965  Wimbledon Grass  Roy Emerson  2‚Äì6, 4‚Äì6, 4‚Äì6 -ccf;\\"  98fb98;\\"Win 1966US ChampionshipsGrass  John Newcombe4‚Äì6, 12‚Äì10, 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì4 } ===Doubles (10 titles, 6 runners-up)=== { class=\\"sortable \\" !style=\\"width:40px\\"Result !style=\\"width:40px\\"Year !style=\\"width:170px\\"Championship !style=\\"width:50px\\"Surface !style=\\"width:170px\\"Partner !style=\\"width:170px\\"Opponents !style=\\"width:180px\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"Score -cfc;\\"  ffa07a;\\"Loss  1961  Wimbledon  Grass  Bob Hewitt  Roy Emerson Neale Fraser  4‚Äì6, 8‚Äì6, 4‚Äì6, 8‚Äì6, 6‚Äì8 -ffc;\\"  ffa07a;\\"Loss  1962  Australian Championships  Grass  Bob Hewitt  Roy Emerson Neale Fraser  6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì4, 1‚Äì6, 4‚Äì6, 9‚Äì11 -cfc;\\"  98fb98;\\"Win  1962  Wimbledon  Grass  Bob Hewitt  Boro Jovanoviƒá Nikola Piliƒá  6‚Äì2, 5‚Äì7, 6‚Äì2, 6‚Äì4 -ffc;\\"  98fb98;\\"Win  1963 Australian Championships  Grass  Bob Hewitt  Ken Fletcher John Newcombe  6‚Äì2, 3‚Äì6, 6‚Äì3, 3‚Äì6, 6‚Äì3 -ffc;\\"  98fb98;\\"Win  1964 Australian Championships  Grass  Bob Hewitt  Roy Emerson Ken Fletcher  6‚Äì4, 7‚Äì5, 3‚Äì6, 4‚Äì6, 14‚Äì12 -cfc;\\"  98fb98;\\"Win  1964  Wimbledon  Grass  Bob Hewitt  Roy Emerson Ken Fletcher  7‚Äì5, 11‚Äì9, 6‚Äì4 -ffc;\\"  ffa07a;\\"Loss  1965  Australian Championships  Grass  Roy Emerson  John Newcombe Tony Roche  6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì4, 11‚Äì13, 3‚Äì6, 4‚Äì6 -ebc2af;\\"  98fb98;\\"Win 1965  French Championships  Clay  Roy Emerson  Ken Fletcher Bob Hewitt  6‚Äì8, 6‚Äì3, 8‚Äì6, 6‚Äì2 -ccf;\\"  98fb98;\\"Win 1965  US Championships  Grass  Roy Emerson  Frank Froehling Charles Pasarell  6‚Äì4, 10‚Äì12, 7‚Äì5, 6‚Äì3 -ffc;\\"  98fb98;\\"Win  1966  Australian Championships  Grass  Roy Emerson  John Newcombe Tony Roche  7‚Äì9, 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì8, 14‚Äì12, 12‚Äì10 -ccf;\\"  98fb98;\\"Win  1966  US Championships  Grass  Roy Emerson  Clark Graebner Dennis Ralston 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì4 -ebc2af;\\"  98fb98;\\"Win 1968  French Open  Clay  Ken Rosewall  Roy Emerson Rod Laver  6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì3 -cfc;\\"  ffa07a;\\"Loss  1968  Wimbledon  Grass  Ken Rosewall  John Newcombe Tony Roche  6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì8, 7‚Äì5, 12‚Äì14, 3‚Äì6 -ffc;\\"  ffa07a;\\"Loss  1969  Australian Open  Grass  Ken Rosewall  Rod Laver Roy Emerson  4‚Äì6, 4‚Äì6 -ccf;\\"  98fb98;\\"Win  1969  US Open  Grass  Ken Rosewall  Charles Pasarell Dennis Ralston 2‚Äì6, 7‚Äì5, 13‚Äì11, 6‚Äì3 -cfc;\\"  ffa07a;\\"Loss  1970  Wimbledon  Grass  Ken Rosewall  John Newcombe Tony Roche  8‚Äì10, 3‚Äì6, 1‚Äì6 } ==Open-era doubles titles (10)== {class=\\"sortable \\" !style=\\"width:30px\\"No !style=\\"width:35px\\"Year !style=\\"width:200px\\"Tournament !style=\\"width:50px\\"Surface !style=\\"width:180px\\"Partner !style=\\"width:180px\\"Opponents !style=\\"width:180px\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"Score -

Noe (born July 1954) is a former Ohio Republican party fundraiser and activist, guilty of money laundering for the 2004 Bush-Cheney campaign and of theft and corruption in the \\"Coingate scandal\\". A longtime resident of Toledo, Ohio, Noe and his wife, Bernadette, held several party positions and minor offices within the government of Ohio. He was also a prominent Republican fundraiser and served as chairman of the 2004 Bush-Cheney election campaign in Northwest Ohio and chairman of the Lucas County Republican party. Noe was also an avid coin dealer and owned various coin dealing companies, such as Capital Coin and Vintage Coins & Collectibles, as well as their subsidiaries. == Organizations and offices  The Republican Party === Both Noe and his wife Bernadette Restivo-Noe have been chairperson of the Lucas County Republican party. Noe was also chairman of the 2004 Bush-Cheney election campaign in Northwest Ohio. Noe was convicted of making illegal contributions to George W. Bush's 2004 presidential campaign.Coin dealer sentenced for illegal contributions NBC News === Board of Elections === During the 2004 election, Noe's wife Bernadette was chairman of the Lucas County Board of Elections. In the 2004 election, the county experienced extreme voting difficulties, including criminal investigations and manipulation of the recount, and many officials resigned or were suspended. The Ohio Secretary of State told Bernadette to resign or be fired. She resigned from both the Lucas County Republican Party and the Lucas County Board of Elections in December 2004. === Board of Regents === Noe was appointed to the Ohio Board of Regents, which oversees Ohio's public colleges and universities, by former Ohio Governor George Voinovich in 1995 to complete a vacated term. Noe was reinstated for a full 9-year term in 1999 by Governor Bob Taft. In late 2004, Noe wrote to the Ohio Ethics Commission to seek an opinion on his involvement with Hi-Genomics LLC which licenses a patent on plant genetic engineering from the University of Toledo. Noe was vice-president of Hi-Genomics LLC and owned a 23% stake in the company. Noe's position on the Board of Regents was deemed to be a conflict of interest by the Ohio Ethics Commission. Noe was told to either resign from the Board, divest his interest in the company, or step down as vice-president of the company. Noe eventually sold back his units in Hi- Genomics to one of the other unitholders. === Turnpike Commission === In 2003 Governor Taft appointed Noe chairman of the Ohio Turnpike Commission for an 8-year term. On May 10, 2005, Noe resigned from the Turnpike Commission. == Coin politics and business == Apart from being President of his company, Thomas Noe Inc. (Noe owns 60%), Noe owns and/or manages many different companies that deal rare coins. His store, Vintage Coins & Collectibles (or Vintage Coins & Cards), is the parent company. Noe was also a statutory agent for the Professional Numismatists Guild, a nonprofit organization of top numismatists whose members follow a strict code of ethics, for more than 25 years. He resigned in May 2005. Noe served as chairman of the Ohio Commemorative Quarter Program Committee during its operation in the 2000s. Noe was appointed chairman of the U.S. Mint's Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee (CCAC) by U.S. Secretary of the Treasury John W. Snow in October 2004. The CCAC advises the secretary on issues relating to commemorative coin design and circulation. He was recommended by U.S. House Representative Dennis Hastert. He resigned in May 2005. == Legal troubles == Noe has been convicted in two separate, but overlapping investigations for a variety of corrupt activities in Ohio and in national politics. === Campaign contributions === On October 27, 2005, Noe was indicted in a federal investigation on counts of conspiracy, conduit contribution violations, and false statements. Noe was accused of illegally funneling $45,400 to President Bush's re-election campaign, using \\"two dozen people as \\"conduits\\" to make illegal campaign contributions at a $2,000-a-seat fund-raiser in Columbus. Conduits named in a federal affidavit include Lucas County Commissioner Maggie Thurber, Toledo City Councilwoman Betty Shultz, former Toledo Mayor Donna Owens and former State Representative Sally Perz. In doing so, Noe skirted federal campaign finance funding limits while meeting a pledge to raise $50,000 for the October 30, 2003, fund-raiser. The Bush campaign later named Noe a \\"Pioneer\\" for raising at least $100,000 overall ... In addition to \\"conduits\\" who received between $1,750 and $4,000 from Noe to make either one or two contributions, prosecutors claim that the former rare-coin dealer used two people as \\"super-conduits,\\" giving them $6,000 and $14,300 that they then split with others who attended the fund- raiser.\\" Noe is now is serving a jail term of at least 10 years. On October 31, 2005, Noe pled not-guilty to all three charges. On May 31, 2006, Noe reversed his earlier plea and pled guilty.Tom Noe indicted April 04, 2019. MIKE WILKINSON AND JAMES DREW On September 12, 2006, Noe was sentenced to 27 months in a federal prison for funneling money into the re-election campaign of President Bush illegally. === Coingate === Noe is also at the center of the Ohio Coingate scandal. On November 13, 2006, Noe was found guilty of theft, money laundering, forgery and corrupt activity, and the central charge: that he engaged in a pattern of corruption in his management of Ohio's $50 million rare-coin fund investment with the bureau. On February 13, 2006, the Lucas County District Court of Ohio indicted Noe along with his business partner, Timothy LaPointe.53 counts for Noe Columbus Dispatch. 14 February 2006. Retrieved 7 April 2020 The prosecution presented their case in three weeks that Noe stole $2 million for personal use; the defense argued that Noe's government contract allowed him the freedom to use the state's money however he wanted, but called no witnesses. The jury deliberated for three days before delivering their verdict. On November 20, 2006, Thomas Noe was given an 18-year sentence, to be served after the 27-month federal sentence imposed in September, fined $213,000, \\"ordered to pay the cost of the prosecution, estimated at nearly $3 million, and ordered to pay restitution to the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation for the money missing from the rare-coin fund, estimated at $13.7 million.\\" Earlier, on August 17, 2005, Ohio Governor Bob Taft was charged with four criminal misdemeanors stemming from his failure to disclose golf outings paid for by lobbyists, as well as some undisclosed gifts. The gifts were varied, but included gifts from Noe. It was the first time an Ohio governor was ever been charged with a crime while in office. == See also == *Coingate scandal == References == == External links == *Noe got early start in rare coin business by Mike Wilkinson, Toledo Blade, April 3, 2005. *Scandal-Ridden Ohio Donor Met with Rove, DNC Research, July 11, 2005. *Noe indicted: GOP backer is accused of laundering cash Mike Wilkinson and James Drew, Toledo Blade, October 28, 2005. *Grand Jury Charges Noe with 53 Felony Counts by Mike Wilkinson and James Drew, Toledo Blade, February 13, 2006. *Chronology of Noe's Involvement (in Coingate), Toledo Blade, February 13, 2006. *Text of Noe's 53-count indictment, February 13, 2006. *Coingate opens up flood of charges, The Plain Dealer, February 14, 2006.

Established in 1818, it was the first diocese of the Episcopal Church to be established outside the original 13 colonies and presently consists of 95 parishes, with a membership of almost 19,000 individuals. The diocese was contiguous with the state of Ohio, but was divided into two dioceses in 1875, due to the geographical size of the diocese and the poor health of Bishops MacIlvaine and Bedell. The Episcopal Diocese of Ohio, which retained the original name, and the Diocese of Southern Ohio headquartered in Cincinnati. It is one of 15 dioceses that make up the Province of the Midwest (Province 5). Originally the diocesan see, or headquarters city, was located in Gambier in south-central Ohio, but moved to Cleveland shortly after the diocesan split. Offices are located on Euclid Avenue near Trinity Cathedral, the cathedral of the diocese. ==History== As settlers and missionaries moved westward after the Revolutionary War, they brought their faith traditions with them, including those of the newly formed Episcopal Church. In the Ohio Territory, three clergyman served as early missionaries. Efforts in the Ohio Valley were led by Deacon James Kilbourne and Joseph Doddridge, while Roger Searle led efforts in the Western Reserve. Shortly after Ohio was admitted to the Union, the first Episcopal church was established in the state at Worthington, near present-day Columbus in 1804. After years of fruitless petitions and through the hard work of missionaries and others, the General Convention of the Episcopal Church finally granted Ohio a separate diocese in 1818. Philander ChasePhilander Chase was appointed the first Bishop of Ohio in 1819. Chase returned from a fund raising trip to England in 1823 and established the diocesan headquarters and a new Episcopal college, Kenyon College, in Gambier. Kenyon College and Gambier were named for Lord Kenyon and Lord Gambier, the largest benefactors of the college and new diocese. Bishop Chase retired after a leadership dispute in 1832, and soon moved to Illinois. Charles Pettit McIlvaine succeeded him as Ohio's bishop and Kenyon College's president. Rt.Rev. McIlvaine was a leading advocate of Evangelicalism, which called upon the Episcopal Church to turn from the more Anglo-catholic reforms of the Oxford Movement and return to a purer Protestant expression in the Church. Upon Bishop McIlvaine's death in 1873, Gregory Thurston Bedell became the Third Bishop of Ohio, having been consecrated as assistant bishop in 1859. Bishop Bedell had staunchly supported the Union in the Civil War, and, like McIlvaine, has been credited with keeping the Episcopal Church unified during this time, unlike many other denominations. Two years later, the General Convention split the Diocese of Ohio into two separate dioceses. The Diocese of Ohio favored more evangelical expression of worship and theology, and Bishop Bedell moved its headquarters to Cleveland at its northeast corner, in the growing urban areas along Lake Erie. Thomas Augustus Jaggar was then consecrated the first bishop of the new Episcopal Diocese of Southern Ohio, which had some parishes favoring more Anglo-catholic styles and established its headquarters in Cincinnati in the state's southwestern corner. William Andrew Leonard was consecrated as the Fourth Bishop of Ohio in 1889 and was responsible, with financial backing from William G. Mather, for constructing Trinity Cathedral, completed in 1907. Charles F. Schweinfurth designed the structure in English Perpendicular Gothic form from Indiana limestone. Diocesan offices were located in the adjoining Church House, where they remain. ==BishopsCurrent=== The Right Reverend Mark Hollingsworth, Jr. was consecrated as the 11th Bishop of Ohio on April 17, 2004 and is assisted by two assisting bishops: the Right Reverend William Persell, retired bishop of the Diocese of Chicago; and the Right Reverend Arthur Williams, retired bishop suffragan of the Diocese of Ohio. ===Former=== Bishops who have served the diocese include: # Philander Chase (1819-1832) # Charles Pettit McIlvaine (1832-1873) # Gregory T.

The reaction is named after Russian organic chemist Vyacheslav Tishchenko, who discovered that aluminium alkoxides are effective catalysts for the reaction. In the related Cannizzaro reaction, the base is sodium hydroxide and then the oxidation product is a carboxylic acid and the reduction product is an alcohol. ==History== The reaction involving benzaldehyde was discovered by Claisen using sodium benzylate as base. The reaction produces benzyl benzoate. The Tishchenko reaction: benzaldehyde reacts to benzyl benzoate, the catalyst is sodium benzylate. Enolizable aldehydes are not amenable to Claisen's conditions. Vyacheslav Tishchenko discovered that aluminium alkoxides allowed the conversion of enolizable aldehydes to esters. == Examples == * The Tishchenko reaction of acetaldehyde gives the commercially important solvent ethyl acetate. The reaction is catalyzed by aluminium alkoxides. * The Tishchenko reaction is used to obtain isobutyl isobutyrate, a specialty solvent. * Hydroxypivalic acid neopentyl glycol ester is produced by a Tishchenko reaction from hydroxypivaldehyde in the presence of a basic catalyst (e.g., aluminium oxide). * The Tishchenko reaction of paraformaldehyde in the presence of aluminum methylate or magnesium methylate forms methyl formate. * Paraformaldehyde reacts with boric acid to form methyl formate. The key step in the reaction mechanism for this reaction is a 1,3-hydride shift in the hemiacetal intermediate formed from two successive nucleophilic addition reactions, the first one from the catalyst. The hydride shift regenerates the alkoxide catalyst. ==Further reading== * V. E.

She was one of the models (\\"Barker's Beauties\\") on the daytime game show The Price Is Right, from 1977 to 1995. ==The Price Is Right== On January 3, 1977, Hallstrom joined the cast of The Price Is Right as the third model after Anitra Ford left the program the previous fall. Hallstrom appeared, along with Janice Pennington and Dian Parkinson, as one of the principal models on all versions of the show from 1977 through the early 1990s. Hallstrom briefly left the program in 1983 to pursue an acting career but re-joined the cast later in 1984. ===Departure and lawsuit=== In September 1995, host Bob Barker dismissed Hallstrom from The Price Is Right. She later alleged that Barker ordered her off the show because of she had gained due to a prescription medication she was taking. on Hard Copy Hallstrom later alleged that the real reason for her dismissal was her refusal to support Barker when another model, Dian Parkinson, sued him for sexual harassment. Hallstrom said Barker ordered her to go on talk shows and do interviews saying that Parkinson was lying, as well as being instructed to recall certain events differently from how she remembered them. Hallstrom, who did not want to get involved in the situation or perjure herself, refused and was dismissed from the show.Showcase Showdown In response to angry letters sent by fans of the series after Hallstrom's dismissal, Barker sued Hallstrom for libel and slander (Barker v. Hallstrom), claiming that Hallstrom was lying, but dropped the suit 48 hours before the trial began. The court declared Hallstrom the prevailing party and ordered Barker to pay Hallstrom's legal fees. Hallstrom countersued Barker for age, weight and medical discrimination, wrongful termination and malicious prosecution (Hallstrom v. Barker). In October 2005, Hallstrom received a multimillion-dollar settlement. The settlement would have possibly been more, but early settlement agreements all contained a \\"hush clause\\" that forbade Hallstrom from saying anything disparaging about Barker to the media. However, Barker refused to agree to the mutuality clause of the settlement agreement, thereby retaining the right to speak freely against Hallstrom in the media. In order to retain her right to speak about the case, and to protect herself against what she called Barker's \\"shameful manipulation of the media\\", Hallstrom accepted a lesser financial amount but with a settlement that did not contain a hush clause. She has also started a foundation for individuals who have suffered wrongful or malicious conditions in the workplace and do not have the power or resources (financially or otherwise) to go up against powerful individuals or large corporations, despite having a valid, non- frivolous claim. Following their testimonies in Barker's lawsuit against Hallstrom, models Janice Pennington, Kathleen Bradley, production assistants Linda Riegert and Sherrill Paris, and veteran director Paul Alter lost their jobs on The Price Is Right. Pennington, who had been with the show since its debut in 1972, and Bradley (1990‚Äì2000) received out-of-court financial settlements. Pennington's contained a hush clause prohibiting her from speaking publicly against Barker. Although Pennington has not spoken publicly regarding Barker or her departure from The Price Is Right since receiving her financial settlement, Bradley has referred to her termination as \\"abrupt\\" and \\"unexpected\\", and as an event she was not prepared for. Paris filed suit against Barker for wrongful termination, along with another female production assistant, Sharon Friem, who was also dismissed at the same time and sued Barker for wrongful termination, as well as sexual harassment and sex discrimination, claiming she was the target of many inappropriate sexual remarks and gestures. Both women received financial settlements to drop their lawsuits against Barker. Alter briefly regained his position and employment on the show in 2000 where he remained until he retired. Hallstrom has never married and has no children, which is why she believes she was the one member of The Price Is Right who could stand up to what she called \\"miserable tyranny at the hands of a mad dictator\\" (referring to Barker). During the nearly ten years her lawsuit was in the courts, she spent all of her resources and savings, sold her house, and ended up living out of her car. As she said in interviews regarding that period of her life, \\"I refused to give up and let that evil old bastard win.\\" Hallstrom is now semi-retired and living in one of several houses she owns, all of which are in and around San Antonio. She does give occasional interviews for shows such as The Today Show and The View. ==Other game show appearances== Hallstrom also appeared several times as a guest panelist on Match Game. In the early 1990s she also appeared on Family Feud with her Price Is Right costars, the majority of which appearances were played against the cast of The Young and the Restless. ==ReferencesHolly Hallstrom and The Price is Right Scandals Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:People from San Antonio Category:Game show models ","title":"Holly Hallstrom"},{"id":"2201778","text":"Sombrero, also known as Hat Island, is part of the British Overseas Territory of Anguilla and is the northernmost island of the Lesser Antilles. It lies north-west of Anguilla across the Dog and Prickly Pear Passage. The distance to Dog Island, the next nearest island of Anguilla, is . Sombrero is long north‚Äìsouth, and wide. The land area is . Originally, when viewed from the sea, the island had the shape of a sombrero hat, but guano-mining operations have left the island with precipitous sides and a relatively flat top that is above sea level. The surface of the island is rough, and vegetation is sparse. The guano-mining operation yielded some 3000 tons of phosphate a year by 1870. By 1890, the phosphate reserves had been exhausted. ==History== Plan of Sombrero in about 1880 showing mining operations As a result of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1714, Sombrero passed into the hands of the British. Captain Warwick Lake of Recruit marooned an impressed seaman, Robert Jeffrey, there on 13 December 1807. As it turned out, Jeffrey survived. A passing American vessel, the schooner Adams from Marblehead, Massachusetts, had rescued him. Still, a court-martial dismissed Lake from the Royal Navy. In 1814, and again in 1825, a British geologist surveyed the island and found that it abounded in guano and reported this to the British government. In 1856 the Americans claimed the island, and in a very short period of time quarried 100,000 tons of phosphate that served as fertilizer for the exhausted lands of the Southern States. Uniquely, an important insurrection occurred when West Indian black workers revolted against the ‚Äúslavery proclivities‚Äù of a white American superintendent vis-√†-vis wage-earning free men. Four of the 200 workers \\"fatally injured\\" Superintendent Snow and commandeered the island and company money and stores.New York Times, 13 August 1860: ‚ÄúNegro Insurrection on a Guano Island‚Äù. The British later intervened and demanded compensation from the United States for the occupation. The conflicting claims to the island were settled in Britain's favour in 1867. Sombrero, lying in the route of shipping from Britain to South and Central America, lay in an area with many hazards and in 1848 the Admiralty was asked to install a light on it. On 30 June 1859, the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company's ship Paramatta was wrecked on her maiden voyage on Horseshoe Reef,The Illustrated London News, Vol. 47, no. 1323, p. 17-18. which resulted in another request to the Admiralty. The lighthouse was then built and first exhibited its light on the evening of 1 January 1868. Ironically, Paramatta and the Lighthouse built following her demise were both constructed by the same shipyard, the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company, on the banks of the River Lea in Blackwall, London. Paramatta was the last ship launched from their Middlesex bank, while the lighthouse was built on the Essex side, the yard occupying premises on either side of the river.Thames Iron Works Historical Catalogue: Souvenir prepared for the Festival of Empire, Crystal Palace 1911, p.42 and p.111 In 1871, the lease of the island was sold for ¬£55,000 and then sold again for ¬£110,000 to the New Sombrero Phosphate Company, which led to litigation in Erlanger v. New Sombrero Phosphate Co (1878) 3 App Cas 1218. The superintendent of Sombrero's house in about 1880 From the early 1870s until 1885, a Cornish mining engineer, Thomas Corfield, was Superintendent of Sombrero. His duties included organizing the transport of the guano to a spot which was convenient for loading the lighters to take the guano to the ships lying off the island, overseeing the construction of derricks and engine houses, and arranging for the laying of the tram lines for the wagons, which were loaded at the quarries. The guano was just piled in dumps near the engine houses and derricks. There was no semblance of a port and no beach. The workers, who were black, were recruited from various islands and lived in wooden huts during their term of service. A Mr. Nesbit, a merchant at Philipsburg, Sint Maarten, a Mr Nesbit, provided the stores and provisions. The company's schooner Logos took the labourers to and from their homes on the other islands, and brought the supplies. The superintendent's house was a wooden bungalow with a wide veranda around the house. He used to live there with his family, except near the hurricane season. The superintendent's house was near the middle of the island and around it were grouped other wooden buildings, and the quarters of the technicians, store keepers, and lighthouse keepers. On the side opposite to the main buildings was a small building for the superintendent.Notes by Thomas Joseph Corfield - Made July 1957. In 1890, the phosphate works on the island were abandoned and by 1893 the lighthouse had come under the authority of the British Board of Trade, later the Department of Transport. Trinity House was responsible for the administration of the light. In 1931, the old light system was changed and improved to 200,000 candle power and the tower received its first major repair when the basement was encased in concrete. On 20 July 1962, after the destruction caused by Hurricane Donna in 1960, the present lighthouse was put into operation. The old tower was demolished on 28 July 1962.A Visit to Sombrero by P. Bannis, Government Information Service Bulletin Vol I, No 2, July 1978, which quoted from the writings of Mr. William Hodge in the Sombrero Visitors' Book The lighthouse is located near the centre of the island, and reaches a height of almost above sea level. It alerts ships passing from the Atlantic Ocean to the Caribbean Sea through the Anegada Passage. Full responsibility for the light passed from Trinity House to the Anguillan government on 1 December 2001.Written Answers - House of Lords:Anguilla:Sombero Island Lighthouse (21 February 2005) ==Population== Until recently the only inhabitants were the staff of the lighthouse, but the light was automated in 2002, and now the island is uninhabited. The only visitors are the occasional fishermen, biologists engaged in fieldwork, and the occasional scuba group visiting the island for its interesting dive sites and post-apocalyptic surface. ==Wildlife== The island is noted for the endemic Sombrero ameiva, a widespread and easily seen lizard species on the island. A recently discovered dwarf gecko, Sphaerodactylus, may be endemic and has been tentatively named the Sombrero dwarf gecko. The Anguilla Bank anole also inhabits the island. This island also has a unique Lasioglossum bee. The surrounding waters are feeding areas for hawksbill turtles. During the late Pleistocene, the island was inhabited by a now-extinct giant tortoise, Chelonoidis sombrerensis. Sombrero has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its breeding seabirds. The island has also been designated as a protected Ramsar site since 2018. It supports internationally important numbers of: * Masked boobies (Sula dactylatra): 27 pairs (54 + birds, 4% of Caribbean population) 2002 * Brown boobies (Sula leucogaster): 386 pairs (772 + birds, 5% of Caribbean population) 1999 * Bridled terns (Sterna anaethetus): 270 pairs (540 birds, 4% of Caribbean population) 1998 * Brown noddies (Anous stolidus): 700 pairs (1400 birds, 5% of Caribbean population) 1998 * Sooty terns (Onychoprion fuscata) UK Overseas Territories Conservation Forum.

They are often observed in cases where a phase transformation front moves quickly, leaving behind two solid products, as in rapid cooling of eutectic (such as solder) or eutectoid (such as pearlite) systems. Such conditions force phases of different composition to form but allow little time for diffusion to produce those phases' equilibrium compositions. Fine lamellae solve this problem by shortening the diffusion distance between phases, but their high surface energy makes them unstable and prone to break up when annealing allows diffusion to progress. A deeper eutectic or more rapid cooling will result in finer lamellae; as the size of an individual lamellum approaches zero, the system will instead retain its high-temperature structure. Two common cases of this include cooling a liquid to form an amorphous solid, and cooling eutectoid austenite to form martensite. In biology, normal adult bones possess a lamellar structure which may be disrupted by some diseases. ==References== Category:Membrane biology Category:Physical chemistry ","title":"Lamellar structure"},{"id":"2201782","text":"Tibial dyschondroplasia (TD) is a metabolic disease of young poultry that affects the growth of bone and cartilage.

SCAR coordinates international scientific research efforts in Antarctica, including the Southern Ocean. SCAR‚Äôs scientific work is administered through several discipline-themed Science Groups. The organisation has observer status at, and provides independent advice to Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings, and also provides information to other international bodies such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).SCAR Inlet is named for the 'Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research. It is the remaining fragment of the much larger Larsen B ice shelf which disintegrated in 2002. 260x260px ==History== At the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU)‚Äôs Antarctic meeting held in Stockholm from 9 - 11 September 1957, it was agreed that a committee should be created to oversee scientific research in Antarctica. At the time there were 12 nations actively conducting Antarctic research and they were each invited to nominate one delegate to join a Special Committee on Antarctic Research. The 12 nations were Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, United Kingdom, United States, and USSR. The Special Committee held its first meeting in the Hague from 3 - 6 February 1958 and elected its first Executive Committee - Ing. Gen. G. Laclav√®re as President, Professor K.E. Bullen as Vice President, and Dr V. Schytt as Secretary. A Finance Committee and three working groups were also formed at this meeting. The organisation‚Äôs name was later changed to the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research. == Structure == SCAR is currently made up of 32 Full Member countries and 12 Associate Member countries. Each Full Member country appoints a Permanent Delegate and an Alternate Delegate, Associate Member countries appoint just one Delegate. The Delegates meet every two years to decide on SCAR‚Äôs strategic direction and which Delegates to elect to the Executive Committee. The role of the Executive Committee is to work with the SCAR Secretariat (based at the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, England) to carry out decisions made by the Delegates. The Executive Committee is made up of a President, an immediate Past-President, four Vice-Presidents and the Executive Director of SCAR. ==Activities Meetings === One of the ways that SCAR brings researchers together is through meetings. These include biennial Open Science Conferences (OSCs), Delegate Meetings, the SCAR Biology Symposium (every 4 years), the International Symposium on Antarctic Earth Sciences, and the Humanities and Social Science Symposium.  Open Science Conferences  SCAR has been organising biennial Open Science Conferences (OSCs) in various member countries including Germany, Australia, Russia, Argentina, USA, New Zealand, Malaysia and Switzerland, since 2004. The OSCs give Antarctic scientists opportunities to draw attention to Antarctic issues, hold scientific group meetings, share their work, and network. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the physical 2020 conference and meetings scheduled to take place in Hobart, Australia, were cancelled. SCAR 2020 Online was held online from 3 - 7 August and delivered the highlights of the conference through a combination of live streaming, recorded presentations, text-based chat and a poster gallery. === Science === Over 30 groups coordinate Antarctic research across a variety of disciplines and themes through SCAR. SCAR has three permanent Science Groups: * Geosciences * Life Sciences * Physical Sciences Each Science Group encompasses Scientific Research Programmes (SRPs) in priority areas. SRPs have a lifetime of about 8 years and new programmes can be suggested and developed through Programme Planning Groups (PPGs). In 2018, a permanent Standing Committee on the Humanities and Social Sciences was set up to recognise the important and growing contribution of the humanities and social sciences communities to Antarctic research. Antarctica‚Äôs human history is relatively recent and this important area of study explores how humans interact with the region. Each Science Group also has Action Groups (AGs), which have a lifetime of two to four years and are intended to solve short-term issues, and wider- focus Expert Groups (EGs), which last between six to eight years. Examples include the AntArchitecture Action Group, the Expert Group on Birds and Marine Mammals, the Earth Observation Action Group, and the Action Group on Meeting and Managing Antarctic Environments. === Policy === One aspect of SCAR‚Äôs work is identifying emerging issues from Antarctic and Southern Ocean research and bringing them to the attention of policymakers, including the Antarctic Treaty, the UNFCCC and IPCC. Environmental and conservation related science is a large and growing part of SCAR‚Äôs policy work. In 2002 SCAR received the prestigious Prince of Asturias Award for International Cooperation. SCAR provides independent scientific advice to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings via its Standing Committee on the Antarctic Treaty System (SCATS). SCATS brings together global scientists to create papers on the status of particular areas of research, to present at the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings. SCAR is also tasked with providing advice to a number of other bodies, including the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. In 2019, SCAR‚Äôs long-standing contribution to the Antarctic Treaty System was recognised by the passing of a resolution calling for the representative countries‚Äô Governments to enhance support, collaboration and cooperation in scientific research and protective measures for Antarctica. === Capacity Building ===  Medals  SCAR awards four medals at its biennial Open Science Conferences, in recognition of excellence in Antarctic and Southern Ocean research and outstanding service to the international Antarctic community, these are: * The Medal for Excellence in Antarctic Research * The Medal for International Coordination * The Medal for Education and Communication * The President‚Äôs Medal for Outstanding Achievement  Visiting Scholarships  SCAR offers Visiting Scholar Awards, which enable researchers and academics to visit other SCAR member countries.  Fellowships  SCAR provides fellowships to early-career researchers to allow them to join research groups in other countries.  Diversity in Antarctic Science  As one of the principles of its parent organisation, the International Science Council (ISC), SCAR ‚Äòpromotes equitable opportunities for access to science and its benefits, and opposes discrimination based on such factors as ethnic origin, religion, citizenship, language, political or other opinion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or age.‚Äô As part of the push to improve the representation of women on Wikipedia, the SCAR community has already included more than 70 new biographies for notable women in Antarctic research. ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Science and technology in Antarctica Category:Organizations established in 1958 Category:Scientific organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Antarctic agencies Category:1958 establishments in Antarctica Category:International Council for Science Category:Organisations associated with the University of Cambridge ","title":"Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research"},{"id":"2201792","text":"The Ko√ß School () is a private coeducational school in Turkey.

The Council meets regularly each week with a faculty adviser. All major and important decisions of the council are to be approved by the faculty adviser even if the meetings are done without the presence of the adviser. Even though it's criticized of its lack of ability to effect school politics (an example would be the abolishing of Courtyard and building a pyramid instead, which was disliked by many of the students during the time) concerning discipline code, student freedoms etc., it is an active student organization with especially its election campaigns being one of the major events each year. Special events Festivals, fairs and performances *Book Fair. Lasts one week. All kinds of books are sold in the school corridors with discount prices.

It is usually held on a warm autumn day, is an indispensable part of school spirit. Students compete with each other in athletic sports, form their own teams and are awarded according to their performances at the end of the day. The activity has not taken place for the last 3 years due to lack of attendance. Traditions Although Ko√ß School is a relatively young school, it is promising with its traditions adhered by its student body and alumni. Following are notable traditions and traditional activities in the school. *T.A.W.A. A frequently heard phrase in the school, which also inspired the establishment of the school newspaper T.A.W.A.. Its extended version is: 'This announcement was about .....', a phrase repeated by students each week during the opening and closing ceremonies at the Atakan Demirseren Hall (more commonly AD or auditorium). On Monday after the ceremony and on Friday before the ceremony, announcements regarding school activities, teams, exams are given by the faculty and students. Since the school has international teachers and students, announcements are made in both English and Turkish. Over the years, T.A.W.A has become a cult, listened with smiling faces in the auditorium at each time a student repeats the phrase. *School trips. To cities and historical places in Turkey, such as Ankara, √áanakkale, Cappadocia are organized each year. Seniors go to Bodrum after the √ñSS as a final to this tradition. There is also a special trip day for the whole school where each class visits a different site in Istanbul and another day where students visit factories and manufacturing centers. *School parties and Concerts. Each year there are about 3-4 school parties organized by the Student Council. During parties, students spend their time eating the food served at Ko√ß School for the day by famous cafes in Istanbul, and dancing in the auditorium or Piramit.There are also many concerts during the year by rock-bands or pop singers. *No Uniform Days. In 2008, along with the new high school principal Koray √ñzsara√ß, Thursdays have been permanently changed into \\"No Uniform Days\\"; although this is often referred to as a privilege, and it was once cancelled for a month as a punishment for widespread behaviour problems.Nowadays the no-uniform day is Wednesday In the past, these were usually party or festival days when students were permitted to wear clothes other than their uniforms. Students used to pay an amount about 1-2 TL this day and the collected money was either used in helping poor, homeless people or used for the student council budget to organise student activities. ===Alumni=== Ko√ß School's notable alumni include Cengiz Pehlevan, who got the first place in 2000 University Entrance Exam; Murat Eken, actor; Mehmet √ñzge √ñzen, writer; C.

The island has an area of and a 2012 Census population of 23,769.2012 Census of Turks & Caicos Islands. Providenciales is the largest island in population, the third largest in area, and is home to a large majority of the population of the Turks and Caicos Islands. Providenciales was ranked the best beach destination in the world by TripAdvisor in 2011. ==Transportation== Providenciales International Airport Turks and Caicos Airport Hotel The island is served by the Providenciales International Airport. There is no public transportation on the island. As recently as 1964, Providenciales did not have a single wheeled vehicle. Roads, water, telephones, and electricity were also absent. The original developer, Provident, Ltd, had shuttle flights from Florida (for a real estate buying program) two times a week in a World War II DC-3 plane and the only hotel was the Third Turtle Inn built by them in 1967.Discover Magazine 2014 ==Economy== After a large investment on Grace Bay Beach by Club Med, the island's first large hotel and casino complex opened in 1984 and touched off a development boom. Resorts included Ocean Club, Turquoise Reef (current Seven Stars), North Beach (now Beaches), and Grace Bay Club. As of the year 2000, Provo is the most tourist-oriented and developed of the Turks and Caicos Islands, boasting many resort hotels and an 18-hole golf course. The island has recently become popular with retirees from around the world, kindling a boom of residential development. Grace Bay has seen many luxury condos built on its shores, however, the settlements of Turks Islanders still provide a local flair to the island. ==Visitor attractions== The diving is world class due to the coral reef surrounding the island. The island is close to a common migration route for the humpback whale. Providenciales is surrounded by uninhabited cays that are easily reached by chartered boat or excursion. The resorts on Providenciales are primarily centred on long Grace Bay. Apart from the beaches, the island's charm lies in its rugged hills and ridges, which are carpeted with prickly pear cactus and scrub (some say the Turks and Caicos gets its name from the indigenous Turk's head cactus common in the islands). Long Bay Beach, on the southern, windward side of the island is still largely undeveloped save for a large luxury resort on the northern tip of the beach. Due to its steady wind and relatively isolated location, Long Bay Beach is rapidly becoming a kiteboarding destination in the Caribbean. Grace Bay has grown to be a major tourist destination with many hotels and condominiums built on the beachfront. Beginning with Club Med in the 1984 and Grace Bay Club in 1993, development continued in the late 1990s with The Sands, Point Grace, and Ocean Club West, and again in the 2000s with The Palms (formerly Regent Palms), Gansevoort and West Bay Club. Outside of Grace Bay, Amanyara was built in the 2000s in the secluded Northwest Point area, and the Shore Club opened in 2017 in the Long Bay Area. Opportunities for sightseeing and hiking are reasonable. There are remnants of Caribbean piracy at Osprey Rock and Sapodilla Hill, and the ruins of Cheshire Hall, a 1790s plantation house constructed by British loyalists, are also notable. ==Ecology== Chalk Sound The western half of Providenciales is mostly barren wilderness, home to the island's best natural attraction, Chalk Sound National Park. The park is a long bay southwest of Downtown. The colour of the water is a uniform turquoise and studded with countless mushroom-like tiny islets. Also on the western part of the island is Northwest Point Marine National Park, which extends to nearby reefs and several saline lakes that attract breeding and migrant waterfowl. ==Towns== Providenciales Town Centre Mall The major road, the Highway, runs east‚Äìwest from Downtown to Leeward. Most of the island's services are near the Highway, including shopping plazas. The communities of Downtown and Kew Town are located near Providenciales International Airport. The town of Wheeland is in the northwest corner of the island. Before Provo became a popular tourist destination, there were three small centers of population: Blue Hills, The Bight (on Grace Bay) and Five Cays. Now many houses have been built, predominantly in the east and south, with larger communities at Leeward, Long Bay and Chalk Sound, as well as expansion of the original three settlements. There are also pockets of makeshift shacks interspersed among the more upscale residences. ==Education== Clement Howell High School and Long Bay High School are the local public high schools. International School of the Turks and Caicos Islands, which serves preschool through grade six, is also in Providenciales, in Leeward. In 2014 it had 106 students. It was known as The Ashcroft School until 2014. ==Images== ==References== ==External links== * Providenciales - Visit Turks and Caicos Islands Category:Caicos Islands ","title":"Providenciales"},{"id":"2201806","text":"Shane Lee (born 8 August 1973) is a former Australian first-class cricketer.

Detective Fiction ‚Äì the collector's guide: Second Edition (Pages 82 and 86) Scholar Press. 1994. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US edition at $2.00. The book features the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot and reflects Christie's experiences travelling in the Middle East with her husband, the archaeologist Sir Max Mallowan. ==Plot introduction== Crime map showing \\"Petra, the place of sacrifice\\" from Dell Mapback #105 Holidaying in Jerusalem, Poirot overhears Raymond Boynton telling his sister, \\"You do see, don't you, that she's got to be killed?\\" Their stepmother, Mrs Boynton, is a sadistic tyrant who dominates her family. When she is found dead on a trip to Petra, Poirot proposes to solve the case in twenty-four hours, even though he has no way of knowing whether it was murder. ==Plot summary== The novel opens as the family and the victim are introduced through the perspective of Sarah King and Dr. Gerard, who discuss the behaviour of the family. Mrs. Boynton is sadistic and domineering, behaviours which she may have carried over from her original profession of prison warden. Sarah is attracted to Raymond Boynton, while Jefferson Cope admits to wanting to take Nadine Boynton away from her husband, Lennox Boynton, and the influence of her mother-in-law. Having been thwarted in her desire to free the young Boyntons, Sarah confronts Mrs. Boynton whose apparent reply is a strange threat: \\"I‚Äôve never forgotten anything ‚Äì not an action, not a name, not a face.\\" When the party reaches Petra, Mrs. Boynton uncharacteristically sends her family away from her for a period. Later, she is found dead with a needle puncture in her wrist. Poirot claims that he can solve the mystery within twenty-four hours simply by interviewing the suspects. During these interviews he establishes a timeline that seems impossible: Sarah King places the time of death considerably before the times at which various of the family members claim last to have seen the victim alive. Attention is focused on a hypodermic syringe that has seemingly been stolen from Dr. Gerard's tent and later replaced. The poison administered to the victim is believed to be digitoxin, something that she already took medicinally. Poirot then calls for a meeting and explains how each member of the family has, in turn, discovered Mrs. Boynton to be dead and, suspecting another family member, failed to report the fact. None of the family would have needed to murder the victim with a hypodermic, since an overdose could have been administered much more effectively in her medicine. This places the suspicion on one of the outsiders. The murderer is revealed to be Lady Westholme who, prior to her marriage, had been incarcerated in the prison in which the victim was once a warden. It was to Lady Westholme, and not to Sarah, that Mrs. Boynton had addressed that peculiar threat; the temptation to acquire a new subject to torture had been too great for her to resist. Disguised as an Arab servant, she had committed the murder and then relied upon the suggestibility of Miss Pierce to lay two pieces of misdirection that had concealed her role in the murder. Lady Westholme, eavesdropping in an adjoining room, overhears that her criminal history is about to be revealed to the world and commits suicide. The family, free at last, take up happier lives: Sarah marries Raymond; Carol marries Jefferson; and Ginevra takes up a successful career as a stage actress ‚Äì she also marries Dr. Gerard. ==Characters== * Hercule Poirot, renowned Belgian detective * Colonel Carbury, senior figure in Transjordania * Mrs Boynton, the victim * Ginevra Boynton, the victim's daughter * Raymond Boynton, the victim's stepson * Carol Boynton, the victim's stepdaughter * Lennox Boynton, the victim's stepson * Nadine Boynton, the victim's stepdaughter-in-law (Lennox's wife) * Jefferson Cope, a family friend * Dr Gerard, a French psychologist * Sarah King, a young doctor * Lady Westholme, a member of Parliament and the murderer * Miss Amabel Pierce, a former nursery governess ==Literary significance and reception== Simon Nowell-Smith's review in the Times Literary Supplement of 7 May 1938 concluded that \\"Poirot, if the mellowing influence of time has softened many of his mannerisms, has lost none of his skill. His examination of the family, the psychologists and the few others in the party, his sifting of truth from half-truth and contradiction, his playing off one suspect against another and gradual elimination of each in turn are in Mrs Christie's most brilliant style. Only the solution appears a trifle tame and disappointing.\\"The Times Literary Supplement, 7 May 1938 (p. 318) In The New York Times Book Review for 11 September 1938, Kay Irvin said, \\"Even a lesser Agatha Christie story holds its readers' attention with its skillful management of suspense. Appointment with Death is decidedly of the lesser ranks: indeed, it comes close to being the least solid and satisfactory of all the Poirot mystery tales. Its presentation of a family harried and tortured by a sadistic matriarch is shot full of psychological conversation and almost entirely deficient in plot. And yet, when the evil-hearted old tyrant has been murdered at last and Poirot considers the suspects, one follows with genuine interest the unraveling of even unexciting clues.\\"The New York Times Book Review, 11 September 1938 (p. 26) In The Observer's issue of 1 May 1938, \\"Torquemada\\" (Edward Powys Mathers) said, \\"I have to confess I have just been beaten again by Agatha Christie. There was no excuse. I was feeling in particularly good form; and the worst of it is that she handicapped herself in the latest game with what in anyone else would be insolent severity. Murder on the Nile (sic) was entirely brilliant; Appointment with Death, while lacking the single stroke of murderer's genius which provided the alibi in the former story, must be counted mathematically nearly twice as brilliant, since the number of suspects is reduced by nearly half. Indeed, though we begin our story in Jerusalem and meet our murder in Petra, the Red Rose City, we might as well be in a snowbound vicarage as far as the limitation of suspicion is concerned. And it is in this respect that Agatha Christie repeats her Cards on the Table triumph and beats Steinitz with a single row of pawns.\\"The Observer, 1 May 1938 (p. 7) The Scotsman of 9 May 1938 said, \\"As usual, Miss Christie plays fair with her readers. While the solution comes with a shock of surprise, it is logical enough: the clues are there, one could fasten upon them and assess their importance. Perhaps it is another case of the reader being unable to see the wood for the trees; but there are so many trees. Not this author's best crime novel, Appointment with Death is yet clever enough and convincing enough to stand head and shoulders above the average work of the kind.\\"The Scotsman, 9 May 1938 (p. 15) E.R. Punshon of The Guardian in his review of 27 May 1938 summarised: \\"For ingenuity of plot and construction, unexpectedness of d√©nouement, subtlety of characterisation, and picturesqueness of background, Appointment with Death may take rank among the best of Mrs. Christie's tales.\\"The Guardian, 27 May 1938 (p. 6) Mary Dell in the Daily Mirror of 19 May 1938 said, \\"This is not a book I should recommend you to read last thing at night. The malignant eye of Mrs. Boynton might haunt your sleep and make a nightmare of your dreams. It's a pretty eerily bloodcurdling tale. A grand book.\\"Daily Mirror, 19 May 1938 (p. 26) Robert Barnard wrote: \\"Notable example of the classic-era Christie, with excellent Near East setting, and the repulsive matriarch as victim. The family tensions around her are conveyed more involvingly than usual. The detection, with its emphasis on who-was-where-and-when, is a little too like Ngaio Marsh of the period, and there is some vagueness in the motivation, but this is as taut and atmospheric as any she wrote.\\" ==References to other works== The novel mentions several other Poirot investigations: the detective is seen to retell to Colonel Carbury the story of Cards on the Table, and Colonel Race from this investigation is mentioned. Nadine Boynton actually confronts Poirot with his own actions in the conclusion of Murder on the Orient Express, Poirot suggesting that she was told by one of the case's figures. Miss Pierce also comments on The A.B.C. Murders when she recognises Poirot as a great detective. ==Publication history== Dell Mapback No. 105, first US paperback edition, 1946 * 1938, Collins Crime Club (London), 2 May 1938, Hardback, 256 pp * 1938, Dodd Mead and Company (New York), 1938, Hardback, 301 pp * 1946, Dell Books, Paperback, (Dell number 105 [mapback]), 192 pp * 1948, Penguin Books, Paperback, (Penguin number 682), 206 pp * 1957, Pan Books, Paperback, 159 pp (Pan number 419) * 1960, Fontana Books (Imprint of HarperCollins), Paperback, 159 pp * 1975, Ulverscroft Large-print Edition, Hardcover, 334 pp The first true publication of Appointment with Death occurred in the US with a nine-part serialisation in Collier's Weekly from 28 August (Volume 100, Number 9) to 23 October 1937 (Volume 100, Number 17) with illustrations by Mario Cooper. The UK serialisation was in twenty-eight parts in the Daily Mail from Wednesday, 19 January to Saturday, 19 February 1938 under the title of A Date with Death. Fifteen of the instalments contained illustrations by J. Abbey (Joseph van Abb√©, brother of Salomon van Abb√©). This version did not contain any chapter divisions and omitted various small paragraphs such as the quote in Part I, Chapter twelve from Dr Gerard which is taken from Book IV of Ecclesiastes. The political argument between Lady Westholme and Dr Gerard in chapter ten about the League of Nations was also deleted. Finally, the epilogue did not appear in the serialisation. Four days before the first instalment appeared, in the edition dated Saturday, 15 January, a piece specially written by Christie as an introduction to the serialisation appeared in the Daily Mail. She charted the creation of Poirot and expressed her feelings about him in the famous quote, \\"There have been moments when I have felt: 'Why-why-why did I ever invent this detestable, bombastic, tiresome little creature!'\\"Daily Mail. 15 January 1938, p. 8. Hercule Poirot ‚Äì Fiction's greatest detective. ==AdaptationsStage=== Christie adapted the book as a play of the same name in 1945. It is notable for being one of the most radical reworkings of a novel Christie ever did, not only eliminating Hercule Poirot from the story, but also changing the identity of the killer. In the play, the ill Mrs Boynton committed suicide and dropped several red herrings that pointed to her family members as possible suspects, hoping that they would suspect each other and therefore continue to live in her shadow even after her death. In addition, the character of Carol Boynton has been dropped, Ginevra is now a stepdaughter (rather than a natural child) of Mrs Boynton, Lady Westholme becomes an ex-Member of Parliament, Miss Pierce is now Miss Pryce, and Alderman Higgs has been added as a fellow vacationer/verbal sparring partner for Lady Westholme. ===Film=== The novel was later adapted into the sixth of six films to star Peter Ustinov as Poirot, and released in 1988. The film retained the essential plot of the book, though the location of the murder was changed from Petra to Qumran, an archaeological site in Palestine. The cast included Lauren Bacall, Carrie Fisher, Sir John Gielgud, Piper Laurie, Hayley Mills, Jenny Seagrove and David Soul. In the movie Miss Pierce was renamed Miss Quinton, and the character of Dr. Gerard was removed. ===Television=== The novel was adapted for the eleventh season of the series Agatha Christie's Poirot starring David Suchet as Poirot. The screenplay was written by Guy Andrews and it was filmed in Casablanca (with Mahkama du Pacha acting as Hotel Constantine in the adaptation and Kasbah Boulaouane as the excavation site) and El Jadida, Morocco in May 2008. It was directed by Ashley Pearce, who also directed Mrs McGinty's Dead and Three Act Tragedy. The cast included Christina Cole, Tim Curry, John Hannah and Elizabeth McGovern. The storyline deviates significantly from the original novel in many respects, among them: * Moving the central setting of the story from Petra in southern Jordan to an archaeological dig in Syria, where Lord Boynton is searching for the head of John the Baptist. * Adding new characters that never appeared in the original novel, such as Lord Boynton, Nanny Taylor, and Sister Agnieszka. * Omitting characters such as Nadine Boynton and Amabel Pierce. * Lennox Boynton is renamed Leonard and is not married. * Altering the backstory of the victim. In the novel, Mrs Boynton is a tyrannical sadist and former prison warden, which is central to her murder. She remains a sadist in the adaptation, this time in control of a large financial empire. She could not have any children of her own, so she selected her children from orphanages, all of whom were badly abused and tormented. * Altering the backstories of several supporting characters. In the adaptation, Jefferson Cope was one of the orphans severely abused by Lady Boynton in his youth, and he decides to take his revenge by wiping out her financial empire and ensuring that she is kept in the dark, though she dies before she realises her financial ruin. Jinny (Ginevra, in the novel) is adopted like Raymond and Carol, and she also becomes the prime motivation for the murderer, whereas in the novel she was Mrs Boynton's sole biological child. Lady Westholme, a US- born Member of Parliament, becomes the unconventional British travel writer Dame Celia Westholme in the adaptation. Dr Gerard, a French psychologist in the novel, becomes a Scottish anesthesiologist, develops a witty personality and becomes an accomplice to the murderer (whereas in the novel, he is completely innocent). * Adding a subplot involving slave traders. It transpires that Sister Agnieszka is an agent whose intent was to kidnap and sell Jinny. Her attempt fails when Jinny attacks her, not knowing that the undercover nun was in fact trying to kidnap her and not trying to save her. She escapes custody by driving across the desert in a car, but this breaks down and she collapses in the heat, while vultures circle overhead. * Altering the murderer's motives. In the novel, Lady Westholme murdered Mrs Boynton to keep her past secret. Before climbing the social ladder, she was incarcerated in the same prison where Mrs Boynton had been a warden. Knowing Mrs Boynton's sadistic personality, she silenced her to keep her reputation and her social status. In the adaptation, Dame Celia Westholme served as a maid in the home of Lady Boynton (who was then Mrs Pierce) before becoming a writer. She had an affair with Dr Gerard, delivered a child, and was sent away to a nunnery in Ireland while Lady Boynton kept the baby. That child turned out to be Jinny. When Dame Celia and Dr Gerard found out that Lady Boynton had abused all of the children that were in her care (including Jinny) even for a short while (like Mr Cope), they decided to kill her out of revenge. * Altering the method in which the murder was committed. In the novel, Lady Westholme used a lethal dose of digitalis under the guise of an inconspicuous Arab servant to commit the murder. In the adaptation, the plan is much more elaborate. First, Dame Celia injects Lady Boynton with a drug that would slowly paralyse her, doing so under the pretense of swatting away a hornet. Dr Gerard drops a dead one and pretends to kill it to verify the fact that Lady Boynton had, indeed, been stung. While Lady Boynton sits atop her platform enjoying the sun, she slowly becomes immobile. Dr Gerard, who had injected himself with a drug that would simulate the symptoms of malaria beforehand, returns to the dig with Jinny to rest. Instead, he drugs Jinny and disguises himself as an Arab to plant a wax ball filled with the blood of a goat that he had killed under the clothes of Lady Boynton. That way, as the sun melted the wax, the blood would make it seem as if she were already dead. When Lord Boynton discovered his wife, Dame Celia went to \\"check\\" the body ‚Äì in reality, she quickly stabbed the woman dead in front of everyone before Dr King could examine her. In this way, neither Dr Gerard nor Dame Celia could have been implicated in the crime as neither apparently would have been seen to have had the opportunity to commit it. Later, when Nanny Taylor has a mental breakdown, Dr Gerard gives her mind- altering drugs and drives her to suicide after forcing her to relive her past, making her feel guilty for delivering the beatings and punishments that Lady Boynton had ordered for her children. After Poirot explains the truth, Gerard injects Dame Celia and then himself with a fatal dose of digitoxin. * Omitting the fateful line \\"I've never forgotten anything ‚Äì not an action, not a name, not a face.\\" Since the motive for the murder has been changed, as well as the character of Mrs/Lady Boynton, the line is now irrelevant to the adaptation. * Downsizing the importance of another line: ‚ÄúYou do see, don't you, that she's got to be killed?‚Äù The line, the first sentence in the novel uttered by Raymond to his sister Carol, is not said in its entirety in the adaptation, and is not given much thought after the fact. * Carol does not have a romantic relationship with Jefferson Cope, and while Jinny is attracted to Dr Gerard, she does not marry him, as he commits suicide and is in fact her biological father. ===Radio=== Appointment with Death was adapted by Michael Bakewell for BBC Radio 4, featuring John Moffatt as Poirot. ==References== ==External links== *Appointment with Death at the official Agatha Christie website * * Category:1938 British novels Category:Hercule Poirot novels Category:Novels first published in serial form Category:Works originally published in Collier's Category:Novels set in Israel Category:Novels set in Jordan Category:Collins Crime Club books Category:British novels adapted into films Category:British novels adapted into plays Category:Novels adapted into television shows ","title":"Appointment with Death"},{"id":"2201833","text":"Abraham Dee Bartlett, 1891 Abraham Dee Bartlett (27 October 1812 ‚Äì 7 May 1897) was a British taxidermist and an expert on captive animals. A superintendent of the London Zoo, he was a prominent observer of animal life and a zoologist who became a popular authority on wildlife. Bartlett brought the London Zoo into prominence and was associated with many naturalists including Charles Darwin. ==Early life== Abraham was the second son of John Bartlett and Jane Dunster. John Bartlett had apprenticed under William Turner, father of J. M. W. Turner, the famous artist, and was a hairdresser and brushmaker. Abraham became interested in animals a child and was allowed by his father's friend, Edward Cross, owner of the menagerie Exeter Exchange in the Strand, to make regular visits. This interest led to Cross introducing him to taxidermy. He, however, began to work as an apprentice to his father in the hairdressing business before he shifted to taxidermy in 1834. His taxidermy business near the British Museum was so successful that he was able to move to bigger home, and towards the end of his life, he owned three houses. He married Lydia Norvall and had four daughters and two sons. ==Foundation of London Zoo== In 1871 Bartlett supported D. W. Mitchell on the idea that the collection of animals held by the Zoological Society of London could be made accessible to the public for a small fee that could help the society. It was open on Mondays for a fee of six pence. Queen Victoria gave him a gold watch for taking care of her pet birds. Dead birds were sent to him for taxidermic preservation, and for his excellent exhibits, he received a gold medal at the Great Exhibition of 1851. He was among the first to reconstruct a specimen of the dodo, and this was displayed at Sydenham Crystal Palace, where he was also appointed naturalist around 1852. The restoration was destroyed, though, in the 1866 fire. He associated himself with the Zoological Society and was offered the position of superintendent made vacant by the death of John Thompson at the garden in Regents Park in 1859. As superintendent, Bartlett became a familiar figure for visiting naturalists and corresponded with many across the world. He was an agent for the acquisition of wild animals from suppliers such as Edward Blyth and was involved in their sale to circus agents such as P.T. Barnum. He kept the position at the zoo, and became a familiar figure until his death. He became an authority on the care of wild animals and published papers in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society and other journals. He received a silver medal by the Zoological Society in 1872 and was made an associate of the Linnean Society in 1879. Charles Darwin often discussed his ideas on sexual selection with Bartlett. He noted, for instance: \\"I asked Mr. Bartlett, of the Zoological Gardens, who has had very large experience with birds, whether the male tragopan (one of the Gallinaceae) was polygamous, and I was struck by his answering, 'I do not know, but I should think so from his splendid colours.'\\" When Darwin was studying the facial expressions of wild animals, he was introduced to the artistic and observational abilities of Joseph Wolf by Bartlett. Wolf was able to make illustrations of fleeting facial expressions for Darwin, although Wolf himself had reservations about Darwin's interpretations. Punch magazine joking in January, 1873 In 1882, Bartlett became quite unpopular after deciding to sell the popular African elephant Jumbo to P. T. Barnum for ¬£2000. A case was made against the sale, but the courts ruled against any interference. Bartlett died in the zoo premises on 7 May 1897, after suffering from an illness. He was buried at St James's cemetery, Highgate. His son, Clarence, who had been assistant superintendent at the zoo, took his position as superintendent. Another son, Edward Bartlett, also became a taxidermist who collected specimens in Peru and became a curator at the Maidstone Museum and the Raja Brooke's museum, in Sarawak. Several writings by Bartlett were published after his death in two books, Wild Animals in Captivity (1898) and Life among Wild Beasts in 'the Zoo' (1900). ==References== == External links == * * Wild Animals in Captivity (1898) * Abraham Dee Bartlett Category:1812 births Category:1897 deaths Category:English zoologists Category:Zoo directors ","title":"Abraham Dee Bartlett"},{"id":"2201837","text":"Infectious bursal disease (IBD), also known as Gumboro disease, infectious bursitis and infectious avian nephrosis, is a highly contagious disease of young chickens and turkeys caused by infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), characterized by immunosuppression and mortality generally at 3 to 6 weeks of age. The disease was first discovered in Gumboro, Delaware in 1962. It is economically important to the poultry industry worldwide due to increased susceptibility to other diseases and negative interference with effective vaccination. In recent years, very virulent strains of IBDV (vvIBDV), causing severe mortality in chicken, have emerged in Europe, Latin America, South-East Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Infection is via the oro-fecal route, with affected bird excreting high levels of the virus for approximately 2 weeks after infection. The disease is easily spread from infected chickens to healthy chickens through food, water, and physical contact.Nguyen Thi Hau (October 27, 2014). \\"GUMBORO disease in chickens and methods of prevention and treatment\\" ==Virology== IBDV is a double-stranded RNA virus that has a bi- segmented genome and belongs to the genus Avibirnavirus of family Birnaviridae. There are two distinct serotypes of the virus, but only serotype 1 viruses cause disease in poultry. At least six antigenic subtypes of IBDV serotype 1 have been identified by in vitro cross-neutralization assay. Viruses belonging to one of these antigenic subtypes are commonly known as variants, which were reported to break through high levels of maternal antibodies in commercial flocks, causing up to 60 to 100 percent mortality rates in chickens. With the advent of highly sensitive molecular techniques, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), it became possible to detect the vvIBDV, to differentiate IBDV strains, and to use such information in studying the molecular epidemiology of the virus. IBDV genome consists of two segments, A and B, which are enclosed within a nonenveloped icosahedral capsid. The genome segment B (2.9 kb) encodes VP1, the putative viral RNA polymerase. The larger segment A (3.2 kb) encodes viral proteins VP2, VP3, VP4, and VP5. Among them, VP2 protein contains important neutralizing antigenic sites and elicits protective immune response and most of the amino acid (AA) changes between antigenically different IBDVs are clustered in the hypervariable region of VP2. Thus, this hypervariable region of VP2 is the obvious target for the molecular techniques applied for IBDV detection and strain variation studies. == Pathogenesis == Clinical disease is associated to bird age with the greatest bursal mass, which occurs between 3 and 6 weeks of age. The greatest bursal mass is mostly a result of a large population of maturing IgM-bearing B-lymphocytes (lymphoblasts), the main target of infection. Young birds at around two to eight weeks of age that have highly active bursa of Fabricius are more susceptible to disease. Birds over eight weeks are resistant to challenge and will not show clinical signs unless infected by highly virulent strains. Subclinical disease occurs in chickens infected before three weeks of age. At this age the B-lymphoblast population is smaller and the systemic effects are insufficient for generating clinical signs. However, the B-cell destruction is usually most severe in subclinically infected young, as virus will destroy a smaller population and most cells in one place (the bursa). After ingestion, the virus destroys the lymphoid follicles in the bursa of Fabricius as well as the circulating B-cells in the secondary lymphoid tissues such as GALT (gut-associated lymphoid tissue), CALT (conjunctiva), BALT (Bronchial) caecal tonsils, Harderian gland, etc. Acute disease and death is due to the necrotizing effect of these viruses on the host tissues. Kidney failure is a common cause of mortality. If the bird survives and recovers from this phase of the disease, it remains immunocompromised which means it is more susceptible to other diseases. == Clinical signs == Two enlarged bursae: yellowish grey (right) and haemorrhagic (left) Caseous exudate in bursa of Fabricius Lesions of kidneys Haemorrhages in proventriculus and gizzard Disease may appear suddenly and morbidity typically reaches 100%. In the acute form birds are prostrated, debilitated and dehydrated. They produce a watery diarrhea and may have swollen feces- stained vent. Most of the flock is recumbent and have ruffled feathers. Mortality rates vary with virulence of the strain involved, the challenge dose, previous immunity, presence of concurrent disease, as well as the flock's ability to mount an effective immune response. Immunosuppression of very young chickens, less than three weeks of age, is possibly the most important outcome and may not be clinically detectable (subclinical). In addition, infection with less virulent strains may not show overt clinical signs, but birds that have bursal atrophy with fibrotic or cystic follicles and lymphocytopenia before six weeks of age, may be susceptible to opportunistic infection and may die of infection by agents that would not usually cause disease in immunocompetent birds. Chickens infected with the disease generally have the following symptoms: pecking at other chickens, high fever, ruffled feathers, trembling and slow walking, found lying together in clumps with their heads sunken towards the ground, diarrhea, yellow and foamy stool, difficulty in excretion, reduced eating or anorexia. The mortality rate is around 20% with death within 3‚Äì4 days. Recovery for survivors takes about 7‚Äì8 days. The presence of maternal antibody (antibody passed to the chick from the mother) changes the disease's progression. Especially dangerous strains of the virus with high mortality rates were first detected in Europe; these strains have not been detected in Australia. ==Diagnosis== A preliminary diagnosis can usually be made based on flock history, clinical signs and post- mortem (necropsy) examinations. However, definitive diagnosis can only be achieved by the specific detection and/or isolation and characterization of IBDV. Immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry tests, based on anti-IBDV labelled antibodies, or in-situ hybridization, based on labelled complementary cDNA sequence probe, are useful for the specific detection of IBDV in infected tissues. RT-PCR (as mentioned above) was designed for the detection of IBDV genome, such as VP1 coding gene, with the possibility of PCR product sequences be determined for genetically comparing isolates and producing phylogenetic trees. Serological tests such as agar gel precipitation and ELISA, for detecting antibodies, are used for monitoring vaccine responses and might be additional information for diagnosis of infection of unvaccinated flocks. Necropsy examination will usually show changes in the bursa of Fabricius such as swelling, oedema, haemorrhage, the presence of a jelly serosa transudate and eventually, bursal atrophy. Pathological changes, especially haemorrhages, may also be seen in the skeletal muscle, intestines, kidney and spleen. ==Treatment and control== Peri-focal vaccination may not be effective for the combat of an outbreak, due to the rapidity of wild-IBDV spreading. Passive immunity may protect against challenge with homologous IBDV, as does previous infection with homologous avirulent strains. Breeder flocks may be immunised against IBD so that they would transfer protective antibodies to their progenies, such as broiler and pullet chicks. Low-attenuated vaccine strains may cause damage to the bursa of Fabricius and immunosuppression in susceptible chicks. Biosecurity with adequate restriction to farm visitation and distancing from other flocks. Post outbreak hygiene measures may not be effective as the virus can survive for long periods in both housing and water. ==Epidemiology== The natural hosts of IBD are chickens and turkeys. ==See also== * Animal virology ==References== ==External links== * Description, with photo of diseased organ * IBD in Commercial Broilers * Infectious Bursal Disease * Infectious Bursal Disease, expert reviewed and published by WikiVet at http://en.wikivet.net/Infectious_Bursal_Disease, accessed 13/09/2011 * Category:Poultry diseases Category:Animal virology Category:Birnaviridae ","title":"Infectious bursal disease"},{"id":"2201840","text":"CIRCA members at a demonstration in Frankfurt CIRCA recruitment poster, with side by side comparison with U.S. Army incentives, standards, and values. The Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army (also known as CIRCA and Clown Army) is an anti-authoritarian left-wing activist group that uses clowning and non- violent tactics to act against corporate globalisation, war, and on other issues. The group originated circa 2003 in the United Kingdom. ==History== CIRCA emerged from the direct action movement and has participated in protests against George W. Bush's visit to the UK in 2003 and demonstrations against the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The group was particularly prominent in many of the actions organised around the 31st G8 summit held in Gleneagles during July 2005.http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/edinburgh.cfm?id=719802005 Rebel clowns are in town], Edinburgh Evening News, 30 June 2005 Members of CIRCA entertained children in Auchterarder while waiting for permission to march near the summit. CIRCA has active groups in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Denmark, Germany, and Israel, and many other groups have appeared that have been inspired by the work of the original group. ==Appearance== Those participating in CIRCA actions typically dress in military-style camouflage clothing supplemented with brightly coloured trimmings and political logos. The costumes both create a comical atmosphere and serve to maintain anonymity during protests. 'Armaments' are usually limited to feather dusters, although some carry water pistols. The complete ensemble of the costume and traditional clown make-up (usually consisting of a white face and red nose) creates a sense of ridiculousness which seeks to challenge preconceptions of radical activists. ==Beliefs== CIRCA claims that there is more to the group than simply dressing up and being playful. There is also a psychology which informs its actions: the clown persona can be used to defuse tense situations and engage with police in public order situations. In order to learn this 'recruits' must participate in a training workshop aka Big Shoe Camp before deployment. In an article about the G8 protests, the Edinburgh Evening News described CIRCA as \\"an anarchist splinter group,\\" but a member denied this, saying that while some members would describe themselves as anarchists \\"...most would consider themselves 'horizontalists' where we engage people without the need for leaders.\\"Rebel Clowns Army  at.indymedia.org ==See also== * Loldiers of Odin * Overpass Light Brigade * Tactical frivolity == References == == External links == *CIRCA Boredom Patrol, in the US/Mexico Borderlands *Middle East Clown Army or Smile LiberAtion Front *Clown Army Wendland (coordinating the Clown Army in Germany) *The Laboratory of Insurrectionary Imagination - which the clowns are involved in *Glasgow Clown Army *arounorg/archives/2007/0707pinkow.html Globalized Resistance: At the G-8 summit, activists refine their tactics from Dollars & Sense, July/August 2007 *Circus of (Im)Migration, Photos, More, 2 *'Embedded' film maker documented CIRCA from first steps in 2003 to the Ridiculous Recruitment Tour and G8 protests *CIRCA website *Rebel Clown Logs *Video of CIRCA action In Leeds *Dutch Clown Army *Belgian Clown Army ===Archived links=== *French Clown Army *Danish Clown Army *Archive of Boredom Patrol Website Category:Activism Category:Clowning Category:Political movements Category:Culture jamming ","title":"Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army"},{"id":"2201846","text":"The International Glaciological Society (IGS) was founded in 1936 to provide a focus for individuals interested in glaciology, practical and scientific aspects of snow and ice.

Given its origin and behavior it is classified as a sarcoma. About half the cases are diagnosed in people with neurofibromatosis; the lifetime risk for an MPNST in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 is 8‚Äì13%. MPNST with rhabdomyoblastomatous component are called malignant triton tumors. The first-line treatment is surgical resection with wide margins. Chemotherapy (e.g. high-dose doxorubicin) and often radiotherapy are done as adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant treatment. ==Signs and symptoms== MPNST Symptoms may include: * Swelling in the extremities (arms or legs), also called peripheral edema; the swelling often is painless. * Difficulty in moving the extremity that has the tumor, including a limp. * Soreness localized to the area of the tumor or in the extremity. * Neurological symptoms. * Pain or discomfort: numbness, burning, or \\"pins and needles.\\" * Dizziness and/or loss of balance. ==Causes== Soft tissue sarcomas have been linked within families, so it is hypothesized that neurofibrosarcoma may be genetic, although researchers still do not know the exact cause of the disease. Evidence supporting this hypothesis includes loss of heterozygosity on the 17p chromosome. The p53 (a tumor suppressor gene in the normal population) genome on 17p in neurofibrosarcoma patients is mutated, increasing the probability of cancer. The normal p53 gene will regulate cell growth and inhibit any uncontrollable cell growth in the healthy population; since p53 is inactivated in neurofibrosarcoma patients, they are much more susceptible to developing tumors. ===Genetics=== Autosomal dominant A malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor is rare, but is one of the most common frequent soft tissue sarcoma in the pediatrics population. About half of these cases also happen to occur along with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1), which is a genetic mutation on the 17th chromosome which causes tumors along the nervous system. The lifetime risk of patients with NF-1 developing MPNST has been estimated at 8‚Äì13%, while those with only MPNST have a 0.001% in the general population. NF-1 and MPNST are categorized as autosomal dominant disorders. This means when one receives an abnormal gene from one of their parents, they will ultimately have that disorder. That person has a 50/50 chance of passing on that gene to their offspring. The pedigree to the right describes this genetic pattern. ==Diagnosis== The most conclusive test for a patient with a potential neurofibrosarcoma is a tumor biopsy (taking a sample of cells directly from the tumor itself). MRIs, X-rays, CT scans, and bone scans can aid in locating a tumor and/or possible metastasis. === Classification === Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors are a rare type of cancer that arise from the soft tissue that surrounds nerves. They are a type of sarcoma. Most malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors arise from the nerve plexuses that distribute nerves into the limbs--the brachial and lumbar plexuses--or from nerves as they arise from the trunk. ==Treatment== Treatment for neurofibrosarcoma is similar to that of other cancers. Surgery is an option; the removal of the tumor along with surrounding tissue may be vital for the patient‚Äôs survival. For discrete, localized tumors, surgery is often followed by radiation therapy of the excised area to reduce the chance of recurrence. For patients suffering from neurofibrosarcomas in an extremity, if the tumor is vascularized (has its own blood supply) and has many nerves going through it and/or around it, amputation of the extremity may be necessary. Some surgeons argue that amputation should be the procedure of choice when possible, due to the increased chance of a better quality of life. Otherwise, surgeons may opt for a limb-saving treatment, by removing less of the surrounding tissue or part of the bone, which is replaced by a metal rod or grafts. Radiation will also be used in conjunction with surgery, especially if the limb was not amputated. Radiation is rarely used as a sole treatment. In some instances, the oncologist may choose chemotherapy drugs when treating a patient with neurofibrosarcoma, usually in conjunction with surgery. Patients taking chemotherapy must be prepared for the side effects that come with any other chemotherapy treatment, such as; hair loss, lethargy, weakness, etc. ==Prognosis== Patient response to treatment will vary based on age, health, and the tolerance to medications and therapies. Metastasis occurs in about 39% of patients, most commonly to the lung. Features associated with poor prognosis include a large primary tumor (over 5 cm across), high grade disease, co-existent neurofibromatosis, and the presence of metastases. It is a rare tumor type, with a relatively poor prognosis in children. In addition, MPNSTs are extremely threatening in NF1. In a 10-year institutional review for the treatment of chemotherapy for MPNST in NF1, which followed the cases of 1 per 2,500 in 3,300 live births, chemotherapy did not seem to reduce mortality, and its effectiveness should be questioned. Although with recent approaches with the molecular biology of MPNSTs, new therapies and prognostic factors are being examined. == See also == * Keratinizing metaplasia * List of cutaneous conditions * 50/50 (2011 film) ==References== == External links == Category:PNS neoplasia Category:Dermal and subcutaneous growths ","title":"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor"},{"id":"2201862","text":"The Council of Rome was a meeting of Catholic Church officials and theologians which took place in 382 under the authority of Pope Damasus I, the then current bishop of Rome.

He was educated at Winchester College and Trinity College, Cambridge (matriculated 1834, graduated B.A. 1838, M.A. 1842). He was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1836, and called to the Bar in 1839. ==Legal career== He became a successful lawyer himself and was appointed a Queen's Counsel in 1855. He was knighted in 1860, shortly after his appointment as a Baron of the Exchequer.Sir John Sainty (comp.) The Judges of England, 1272-1990: a list of the judges of the Superior courts (Selden Society: Supplementary Series 1993, 10), 132. He presided over the Court of Probate and Divorce from 1863 until his retirement in 1872, being raised to the peerage as Baron Penzance, of Penzance in the County of Cornwall, in 1869. He was the judge in the sensational Mordaunt divorce case.Pall Mall Gazette, 11 March 1875 In 1875, he accepted the post as Dean of Arches and presided over a number of notorious trials, notably, Bell Cox, Dale, Enraght, Green and Tooth, under the Public Worship Regulation Act 1874 arising out of the Ritualist controversy in the Church of England. In 1866, he presided over Hyde v. Hyde, a polygamy case. In his ruling, Lord Penzance stated: > What, then, is the nature of this institution as understood in > Christendom?...If it be of common acceptance and existence, it must have > some pervading identity and universal basis. I conceive that marriage, as > understood in Christendom, may for this purpose be defined as the voluntary > union for life of one man and one woman, to the exclusion of all others. This remained the common-law definition of marriage throughout the British Empire and successor states. In Canada, it was overruled by an explicit statutory definition in the Civil Marriage Act 2005, which allowed for same- sex marriage. ==Shakespeare== Wilde argued, following Lord Campbell and others, that the works of Shakespeare are extremely accurate in matters of law. In The Bacon-Shakespeare Controversy (1890) he wrote of \\"Shakespeare's perfect familiarity with... English law... so perfect and intimate that he was never incorrect and never at fault\\", arguing that this was evidence that the plays were the work of a legal expert such as Bacon.Brian Jay Corrigan, Playhouse Law in Shakespeare's World, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, Madison, NJ., 2004, p.195-196. Several other authors followed Wilde's arguments about the legal expertise used in Shakespeare, including Sir George Greenwood. Opponents of Wilde's view argued that Shakespeare's knowledge of the law was not exceptional. ==Family and gardening== He married Lady Mary, daughter of William Pleydell-Bouverie, 3rd Earl of Radnor, in 1860. There were no children from the marriage. The couple resided at Eashing Park, Godalming. At his garden in Godalming, from Rosa eglanteria and Rosa foetida he produced two new roses named Lady and Lord Penzance. He went on to produce a further 14 roses named after characters in the novels of Sir Walter Scott, including the Jeanie Deans Hybrid Rose. ==Bibliography== Dewar, Mary. (1964).

In Poland it is grouped in the nalewka category of alcoholic beverages. Mass-produced versions of krupnik consist of 40‚Äì50% (80‚Äì100 proof) alcohol, but traditional versions will use 80‚Äì100% grain alcohol as the base. Honey, usually clover honey, is the main ingredient used to add sweetness, as well as up to 50 different herbs. There are many versions and some recipes have been passed down through generations; each producer typically uses their own recipe. Krupnik originated in the territories of present-day Belarus, which were at the time part of the larger Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Krupnik is sometimes heated before being served. Legend has it that the recipe was created by the Benedictine monks at a monastery in Nia≈õvi≈æ (then known as Nie≈õwie≈º) which was founded by Miko≈Çaj Krzysztof \\"Sierotka\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. Known in Poland and Lithuania (including present-day Belarus) at least since the 16th century, it soon became popular among the szlachta of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. There are numerous recipes preserved up to present times in countless diaries of the szlachta. Krupnik was also used as a common medicinal disinfectant by Polish soldiers in World War II. At times, spicy seasonings and herbs are added for flavour. The brand of the honey and the ratio of seasonings are key factors which determine the final taste of krupnik. A mixture of the honey and spices is diluted, boiled and strained before being added to a vodka base. It may be served hot, at room temperature or chilled. A specific sort of krupnik which contains more herbs and less honey is brewed by Karaims. \\"Krupnik\\" is also the brand name of a range of alcoholic beverages produced by the Belv√©d√®re company, including krupnik, vodka, and various nalewki.

Epidemic had started from the capture of the Russian ships of line Vladislav during the Battle of Hogland in 1788. From the captured sailors the disease had spread widely into the fleet during its prolonged stay at Sveaborg in 1788 was carried with the fleet to Karlskrona later that year. Fitting ships for the sealing season proceeded very slowly and was greatly hindered by the losses suffered due to the illness to the crews. From December 1788 to September 1789 total of 26,249 were treated for sickness in naval hospitals at Karlskrona alone of whom 5,286 perished while the total death toll of the epidemics is assumed to be around 15,000 lives. By the end of June thousands of soldiers had to be sent from the infantry as reinforcements for the fleet. Regardless of the obstacles Admiral Otto Henrik Nordenski√∂ld who was responsible for refitting was able to ready fleet of 21 ships of the line and 8 frigates for sailing already for 6 June however without crews. The Russian fleet had spent the winter of 1788‚Äì1789 in split into several elements at Copenhagen, Reval and Kronstadt. Together with newly built ships and effective repairs of ships damaged earlier the Russians were looking to be able to deploy around 40 ships capable to taking part to battle line with combined crew of roughly 30 000 men. Admiral Samuel Grieg who had commanded the Russian fleet at the Battle of Hogland had perished in the autumn 1788 and Admiral Von Dessin who had commanded the elements of the Russian fleet deployed to Copenhagen was removed from command. They were replaced respectively with Admirals Vasili Chichagov and Timofei Kozljaninov. The goal for the Russian naval operations in 1789 was to link together the separated fleet elements and then engage the Swedish fleet as soon as possible while meanwhile providing forces to uphold the blockades of the shipping routes along the Finnish coast. Lack of crews prevented the Swedish fleet from any training or exercises and it was effectively confined to the docks. The fleet was finally able to set sail on 6 July despite that several ships were still undermanned, several lacking more than hundred men from their complements. Having assembled 21 ships of the line and 8 large frigates under his flag, Prince Karl, Duke of S√∂dermanland decided to intercept the Russian fleet near the island of √ñland before the elements of the Russian fleet would be able to link up. Admiral Otto Henrik Nordenskj√∂ld acted as flag-captain to the Duke Charles. ==Battle== After setting sail the Swedish fleet patrolled the waters between Sk√•ne, R√ºgen, Bornholm and Sj√§lland in the southern Baltic Sea. Fleet was still not clean from diseases (mainly the relapsing fever) and several small dispatch vessels were used for shipping healthy men to fleet while transporting ever growing number of sick back to Karlskrona. On 23 July did the Swedish fleet receive news that 35 ship strong Russian fleet had been seen outside of Gotland and finally at noon on 25 July were the first Russian ships sighted. Both fleets took northernly heading and Swedish tried to close in the distance. The Russian fleet attempted to slip between the Swedes and Karlskrona but when it became clear that it would not succeed the Russians were content with just keeping distance to the Swedes. Winds were getting stronger which prevented either side from taking action later on 25 July 1789. On morning of 26 July fleets again sighted each other and Swedes again attempted to close in and engage the Russian but were unable to do so as the Russian fleet carefully avoided it. Further problem for the Swedes was that the rear-guard commanded by Admiral Per Liljehorn had become separated from the rest of the fleet and did not rejoin it despite of repeatedly being ordered to do so. The Russian fleet continued evading the Swedish trying to slip between the Swedes and their home port. Finally by 1400 on 26 July had first ships reached the cannon range and started the battle. Varying winds forced battle to be paused between 1600 and 1800 but it was later commenced again. Fighting continued until 2000 when the Russian fleet turned towards east. Swedish fleet was unable to follow as the undermanned crews could not handle both guns and sails simultaneously. During the battle the fleets remained fair distance apart and the cannons were fired near their maximum ranges and thus had very little effect. Misfiring cannons and barrel explosions were the main cause of losses on both sides. During the fight three trailing ships of the Russian fleet were left separated from the rest of the fleet. Several Swedish ships were ordered to engage these stragglers but the Swedish ships turned away before even reaching the cannon range. Captains of the ships later claimed that they turned away from the Russian ships according to orders from Admiral Per Liljehorn who kept his ships away from the fight. Swedes were able to receive reinforcements and ship out the sick on 28 July after which the Swedish turned again to chase the Russians but without success as the Russians repeatedly avoided engaging the Swedish fleet. Similar action was repeated on following days until on 30 July the continuously worsening sickness amongst the crews forced the Swedes to seriously consider returning to their base as roughly 2 500 men had gotten sick after the fleet had set sail. On 31 July the wind turned which was seen as favorable for arrival of the Russian squadron from Copenhagen. To avoid being caught between two Russian fleets the Swedish fleet started back towards Karlskrona. On the same day the Russian squadron from Copenhagen joined with the Russian fleet. ==Aftermath== For three days the fleets maneuvered within sight of each other, but finally the Swedes retreated to the naval base at Karlskrona. The battle ended in a draw, but the Russians remained in control of the Baltic Sea. The epidemic that still had not ended at Karlskrona then confined the Swedish fleet to its anchorage for most of the remainder of the year. Per Liljehorn was stripped of his admiral's rank even before the fleet returned to Karlskrona. Suspicions concerning Liljehorn arose after the debacle; it was widely suspected that the Russians had bribed him. A court martial convicted him but the government declined to execute him. Chichagov too was investigated for his inaction and avoidance of battle. However, the court martial found him not found guilty because his orders explicitly stated that he should first rendezvous with the Russian squadron from Copenhagen before engaging the Swedish fleet. ==The rival fleetsSweden=== Wladislaff 76 Enigheten 74 G√∂tha Lejon 74 Kung Adolf Fredrik 74 Kung Gustaf III 74 Louise Ulrika 74 Sophia Magdalena 74 F√§derneslandet 66 √Ñran 64 Dristigheten 64 Dygden 64 F√∂rsightigheten 64 Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotta 64 Manligheten 64 √ñmheten 64 Prins Carl 64 Prins Fredrik Adolf 64 Tapperheten 64 R√§ttvisan 62 Wasa 62 Riksens St√§nder 60 Gripen 44 Uppland 44 Euredice 40 Fr√∂ya 40 Galathea 40 Minerva 40 Thetis 40 Zemire 40 ===Russia=== Rostislav 100 Dvyenadtsat Apostolov 100 Knyaz Vladimir 100 Iezekiil 78 Kir Ioann 74 Mstislav 74 Pobyedoslav 74 Prints Gustav 74 Sv.

The disease is caused by avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a coronavirus (Coronaviridae, Orthocoronavirinae, genus Gammacoronavirus, subgenus Igacovirus), and characterized by respiratory signs including gasping, coughing, sneezing, tracheal rales, and nasal discharge. In young chickens, severe respiratory distress may occur. In layers, respiratory distress, nephritis, decrease in egg production, and loss of internal (watery egg white) and external (fragile, soft, irregular or rough shells, shell-less) egg quality are reported.Cavanagh, D., and S. A. Naqi. Infectious bronchitis. In: Diseases of poultry, 11th ed. Y. M. Saif, ed. Iowa State University Press, Ames, IA. pp. 101‚Äì120. 2003. == Signs and symptoms == Coughing and rattling are common, most severe in young, such as broilers, and rapidly spreading in chickens confined or at proximity. Morbidity is 100% in non-vaccinated flocks. Mortality varies according to the virus strain (up to 60% in non-vaccinated flocks). Respiratory signs will subdue within two weeks. However, for some strains, a kidney infection may follow, causing mortality by toxemia. Younger chickens may die of tracheal occlusion by mucus (lower end) or by kidney failure. The infection may prolong in the cecal tonsils. In laying hens, there can be transient respiratory signs, but mortality may be negligible. However, egg production drops sharply. A great percentage of produced eggs are misshapen and discolored. Many laid eggs have a thin or soft shell and poor albumen (watery), and are not marketable or proper for incubation. Normally- colored eggs, indicative of normal shells for instance in brown chickens, have a normal hatchability. Egg yield curve may never return to normal. Milder strains may allow normal production after around eight weeks.

Nature 220:650. and varies greatly genetically and phenotypically, with hundreds of serotypes and strains described. The most updated classification of IBV places the virus in Coronaviridae, Orthocoronavirinae, genus Gammacoronavirus, subgenus Igacovirus. The coronaviruses contain the largest known viral RNA genome in number of nucleotides, of approximately 30,000 bases. The RNA forms a single strand and single segment. IBV diversity is based on transcriptional error, which may become very relevant if occurring in genomic sequences coding for proteins, involved in adsorption to target cell or inducing immune responses. Transcriptional error variants may emerge with evolutional advantage in susceptible chickens. Large genomic changes will occur with entire gene interchanges, by reassortment, as for its replication, seven subgenomic mRNAs are produced and will enable reassortment in coinfections. When two strains of coronavirus IBV infect a host they are able to undergo recombination.Kottier SA, Cavanagh D, Britton P. Experimental evidence of recombination in coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus. Virology. 1995 Nov 10;213(2):569-80. doi: 10.1006/viro.1995.0029. PMID: 7491781; PMCID: PMC7131336 Recombination occurs during replication of the RNA genome, and appears to contribute to the genetic variation of the IBV genome found in nature.Wang L, Junker D, Collisson EW. Evidence of natural recombination within the S1 gene of infectious bronchitis virus. Virology. 1993 Feb;192(2):710-6. doi: 10.1006/viro.1993.1093. PMID: 8380672 == Diagnosis == Chicken respiratory diseases are difficult to differentiate and may not be diagnosed based on respiratory signs and lesions. Other diseases such as mycoplasmosis by Mycoplasma gallisepticum (chronic respiratory disease), Newcastle disease by mesogenic strains of Newcastle diseases virus (APMV-1), Avian metapneumovirus, infectious laryngotracheitis, avian infectious coryza in some stages may clinically resemble IB. Similar kidney lesions may be caused by different etiologies, including other viruses, such as infectious bursal disease virus (the cause of Gumboro disease) and toxins (for instance ochratoxins of Aspergillus ochraceus), and dehydration. In laying hens, abnormal and reduced egg production are also observed in Egg Drop Syndrome 76 (EDS), caused by an Atadenovirus and avian metapneumovirus infections. At present, IB is more common and far more spread than EDS. The large genetic and phenotypic diversity of IBV have been resulting in common vaccination failures. In addition, new strains of IBV, not present in commercial vaccines, can cause the disease in IB vaccinated flocks. Attenuated vaccines will revert to virulence by consecutive passage in chickens in densely populated areas, and may reassort with field strains, generating potentially important variants. Definitive diagnosis relies on viral isolation and characterization. For virus characterization, the methodology using genomic amplification (PCR), firstly by the reverse transcription of viral RNA into cDNA, the cyclic amplification of cDNA and sequencing of products, will enable very precise description of strains, according to the oligonucleotide primers designed and target gene. Broadly sensitive universal gene targets are the nucleoprotein, the matrix or the S2 encoding genes. The S1 encoding gene products sequencing may enable phylogenetic results which are comparable to serotyping. Methods for IBV antigens detection may employ labelled antibodies, such as direct immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase. Antibodies to IBV may be detected by indirect immunofluorescent antibody test, ELISA and Haemagglutination inhibition (haemagglutinating IBV produced after enzymatic treatment by phospholipase C). ==Treatment and prevention== No specific treatment is available, but antibiotics can be used to prevent secondary infections. Vaccines are available (ATCvet codes: for the inactivated vaccine, for the live vaccine; plus various combinations). Biosecurity protocols including adequate isolation, disinfection are important in controlling the spread of the disease. ==References== ==External links== *The Infectious Bronchitis (IB) information site *EM Image of IBV Category:Poultry diseases Category:Animal virology ","title":"Avian infectious bronchitis"},{"id":"2201977","text":"James Stuart (2 January 1843 ‚Äì 12 October 1913) was a British educator and politician.

He later became a Fellow of the College and Professor of Mechanism and Applied Mechanics at Cambridge University from 1875; he was also Lord Rector of St Andrews from 1898 to 1901. Stuart was interested in popularising scientific topics and published several books on the subject. Stuart was an unsuccessful Liberal candidate for the Cambridge University parliamentary seat in an 1882 by-election; in 1884 he was elected for Hackney. From the 1885 election he sat for the Hoxton division of Shoreditch. He became known for his contribution to London politics and in February 1890 was chosen as an Alderman of the London County Council; the added work caused him to resign his chair at Cambridge. The Progressive Party on the LCC chose him as its Leader shortly after his election but he stood down after the 1892 council election. In the 1900 general election, Stuart lost his seat in Parliament. He returned briefly for Sunderland from 1906 until again being defeated in January 1910. He was appointed to the Privy Council in 1909. Suffering poor health, he published his memoirs (Reminiscences) in 1912.

He was a late follower of the Venetian School, and was influential in the development and differentiation of instrumental forms which were just beginning to appear, such as the sonata and the ensemble canzona; in addition he was the only Venetian of his time to write dance music for harpsichord. == Life == Little is known about Picchi's early life, but his birthdate (1571 or 1572) can be inferred from his death record which states that he was 71 when he died on 17 May 1643. The earliest documentary evidence pertaining to him, unusually enough, is a picture: he appears as a lutenist on the title page of a 1600 dance manual by Fabritio Caroso (Nobilit√† di dame). Sometime before February 1607 he was hired as organist at the Venetian church of the Frari, and from 1623 to his death he was also organist at the confraternity Scuola di San Rocco, the most prestigious and wealthy of all the Venetian confraternities. In 1624 he applied for the position of second organist at St. Mark's, but Giovanni Pietro Berti was chosen instead. He was a close contemporary of Monteverdi, being born four years later and dying six months earlier than the more renowned composer. == Music and influence == Of Picchi's music, mostly instrumental music survives. One harpsichord toccata is included in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book (how it got there is not known ‚Äì very little Italian music is included in that English collection); three passamezzos survive in a manuscript from Turin; and in 1619 he published a collection of harpsichord dances, Intavolatura di balli d'arpicordo. In addition, he published a collection of 19 ensemble canzonas in 1625, Canzoni da sonar. A sole motet survives in Ghirlanda sacra 1625. His harpsichord dances are of three types: dances in triple meter, dances in triple meter paired with saltarellos, and pieces which use a ground bass. Most of the works with ground bass use some type of romanesca pattern, consisting of a line descending by fourth, rising by step, then descending again by fourth or fifth, rising by step, and so forth (the Pachelbel Canon, probably written several decades after Picchi's death, is probably the most famous example of variations over a romanesca bass). Within his ensemble canzonas, Picchi worked to differentiate several types of instrumental writing which were critically important to later forms such as the concerto. In particular, he used well-defined concertino, ritornello, and cadenzas in his ensemble music, following and further developing a practice initiated in the music of Giovanni Gabrieli and the other composers of his generation. His writing for concertino groups was probably the most innovative aspect of his style, and foreshadowed the work of composers in the middle Baroque such as Corelli. Picchi used both sequential variation and echo effects, and scored for a variety of instruments including violins, bassoons, recorders and trombones, often in the same piece. Picchi seems to have used the terms canzona and sonata interchangeably, sometimes calling a piece \\"canzona\\" in the score and \\"sonata\\" in the part book; the differentiation of these forms was only just beginning in the early 17th century. == Media == == References == * Eleanor Selfridge-Field, Venetian Instrumental Music, from Gabrieli to Vivaldi.

It is considered the most famous metal band in its country. ==History Beginnings === Walter Giardino during his brief time in V8. The guitarist Walter Giardino replaced Osvaldo Civile in V8 for a little time, and left the band when his songs were rejected. His friend Roberto Cosseddu, bassist of Kamikaze, helped him to record a demo tape with those songs. The drummer Gustavo Rowek, who had also left V8 a short time before, declined his projects with Civile and joined Giardino. The session musicians Rodolfo Cava (singer) and Yulie Ruth (bass player) completed the line-up that recorded the demo. The songs were \\"Chico callejero\\", \\"Rompe el hechizo\\", \\"Gente del sur\\" and \\"La bruja blanca\\". Seeking stable members, the band took Sa√∫l Blanch as singer, who was working in the hard rock band Plus. They met the bass player Guillermo S√°nchez with the help of Giardino's friend Sergio Berdichevsky, member of WC at that point. Rata Blanca made their first concert on August 15, 1987 in the Luz y Fuerza theater. Sa√∫l Blanch left the band, and he was replaced by Carlos P√©rigo, who composed the song \\"D√≠as Duros\\". P√©rigo left the band soon after that. Rodolfo Cava returned for a brief time, and Shito Molina got ill and could not sing anymore. As the band was about to record their first album and needed a singer immediately, Sa√∫l Blanch returned to the band and helped record it. The album Rata Blanca was released in 1988, with nine songs. On that year they took part in the \\"Halley en Obras\\" concert, along with Alakr√°n, JAF and Kamikaze. === Success === Polygram requested that the band could create an album which would have high sales in the first semester to renew the contract, and the band made fourfold the required number of sales. The keyboard player Hugo Bistolfi joined the band in 1989, and the singer Adri√°n Barilari replaced Sa√∫l Blanch. The band subsequently made their second album Magos, espadas y rosas, which contained the popular songs \\"Mujer amante\\" and \\"La leyenda del hada y el mago\\". It was a successful release, and in its wake the band appeared in the TV show Ritmo de la Noche, and played in cumbia concert halls because typical rock venues could not accommodate their large audiences. The album was followed by \\"Guerrero del Arco Iris\\", and a concert at the Jos√© Amalfitani Stadium. The band ended their contract with Polygram recording a live album, made at the Opera Theater with an orchestra, but this album was released years later. Once in BMG they made an EP called \\"El Libro Oculto\\". This work was more aggressive, both in instrumental style and lyrical style, as a result of the criticism from heavy metal fans towards the band. === Changes in lineup and reunion === Barilari did not like the new style found in \\"El Libro Oculto\\" and left the band after a concert in Obras. Bistolfi followed him, and both of them created the band Alianza. Barilari and Bistolfi were replaced by Mario Ian on vocals and Javier Retamozo on keyboards. With this line-up they released Entre el Cielo y el Infierno (\\"Between Heaven and Hell\\"). Later that year, they were invited to play in the \\"Festival Monsters of Rock\\" in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, along with Ozzy Osbourne, Therapy?, and Alice Cooper. They released another album with new singer Gabriel Marian called \\"Rata Blanca VII\\". The group disbanded in late 1997. Gustavo Rowek and Sergio Berdichevsky created the band Nativo, and Giardino continued with Walter Giardino Temple. Barilari and Bistolfi were invited to a concert of Walter Giardino Temple in 2000, which led to a reunion of the band. Rowek and Berdichevsky refused to be part of the reunion. The radio La Mega aired frequently the old \\"Mujer amante\\" song, generating a renewed interest in the band. The new album, El camino del fuego, released in 2002, was a huge success. Its follow-up, the 2005 album La Llave de la Puerta Secreta had great sales and went into Gold even before being officially released. Rata Blanca played with famous member of Deep Purple Glenn Hughes as a guest at the Gran Rex Theater, in 2003. They played the band's hits as well as Deep Purple's classic songs. In order to gain a more international profile, Giardino approached former Rainbow singer Doogie White to record an English version of the Forgotten Kingdom album in 2009. Doogie White recorded an English versions of El Reino Olvidado ===2010‚Äìpresent=== Early in 2010, Rata Blanca historical keyboardist Hugo Bistolfi left the band and was replaced by Danilo Moschen, a former member of Barilari's soloist band. In 2013, original members Gustavo Rowek, Sergio Berdichevsky and Saul Blanch reunited with Rata Blanca for some presentations. In 2015 Rata Blanca released their tenth studio album, Tormenta El√©ctrica. In May 2017, bassplayer Guillermo S√°nchez died due to sepsis. A few days before, singer Adri√°n Barilari announced that Guillermo was in poor health condition. == Personnel == 2010-2017 line-up, from left to right; Fernando Scarcella, Guillermo S√°nchez, Walter Giardino, Danilo Moschen and Adri√°n Barilari ===Current lineup=== * Walter Giardino - Lead Guitar (1986‚Äì1998, 2000‚ÄìPresent) * Adri√°n Barilari - Vocals (1989‚Äì1993, 2000‚ÄìPresent) * Fernando Scarcella - Drums (2000‚ÄìPresent) * Danilo Moschen - Keyboards (2010‚ÄìPresent) * Pablo Motyczak - Bass (2017-Present) ===Past members=== * Sa√∫l Blanch - Vocals (1986‚Äì1989) * Mario Ian - Vocals (1993‚Äì1997) * Gabriel Marian - Vocals (1997‚Äì1998) * Sergio Berdichevsky - Rhythm Guitar (1986‚Äì1998) * Guillermo S√°nchez - Bass (1986‚Äì1998, 2000‚Äì2017; died 2017) * Gustavo Rowek - Drums (1986‚Äì1998) * Hugo Bistolfi - Keyboards (1989‚Äì1993, 2000‚Äì2010) * Javier Retamozo - Keyboards (1993‚Äì1997) ===Live members=== * Shito Molina - Vocals (1988; died 2003) * Carlos Perigo - Vocals (1988) * Lowi Novello - Vocals (1988) * Alejandro Zon - Drums (2005) ===Timeline=== == Discography Studio albums=== * Rata Blanca (1988) * Magos, Espadas y Rosas (1990) * Guerrero del Arco Iris (1991) * El Libro Oculto EP (1993) * Entre el Cielo y el Infierno (1994) * Rata Blanca VII (1997) * El Camino del Fuego (2002) * La Llave de la Puerta Secreta (2005) * El Reino Olvidado (2008) * Tormenta El√©ctrica (2015) ===Live and compilation albums=== * En vivo en Buenos Aires (1996) * Grandes Canciones (2000) * Poder Vivo (2003) * Rata Blanca & Glenn Hughes: A Vivo en Teatro Gran Rex (2003) ===Singles=== * \\"La Leyenda del Hada y El Mago\\" * \\"Rata Blanca\\" (2001) * \\"Teatro Gran Rex\\" (2001) * \\"Highway on Fire (EP)\\" (2002) ==Cover versions== Spain's M√§go de Oz recorded a version of \\"Mujer amante\\". == References == == External links == * Rata Blanca's official homepage Category:Argentine heavy metal musical groups Category:Power metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1986 Category:1986 establishments in Argentina ","title":"Rata Blanca"},{"id":"2202009","text":"Still, Alive... and Well? is a Megadeth compilation album released on September 10, 2002 and is the last Megadeth release with bassist and co- founder David Ellefson until his reunion with the band eight years later.

It is a highly infectious avian pathogen that affects the respiratory tract, gut, kidney and reproductive systems of chickens. IBV affects the performance of both meat- producing and egg-producing chickens and is responsible for substantial economic loss within the poultry industry. ==Classification== IBV is in the genus Gammacoronavirus, or group 3, with a non-segmented, positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome. It is the type species of its Genus Igacovirus, today. And, when there was only one genus in the Coronaviruses, the genus Coronavirus, it was the type species of the group of all known coronaviruses. ==Recombination== When two strains of coronavirus IBV infect a host they may recombine during genome replication.Kottier SA, Cavanagh D, Britton P.

PMID: 7710354; PMCID: PMC7086685 == Pathology  Respiratory system === When inhaled, virus will attach to glycoprotein receptors containing sialic acid on ciliated epithelial cells of the respiratory epithelium. The respiratory replication will result in loss of ciliary activity, mucus accumulation, necrosis and desquamation, causing respiratory distress, r√¢les and asphyxia. Local virus replication will result in viremia, spreading the infection into other tissues and organs. Other respiratory diseases of chickens (Mycoplasma gallisepticum, avian infectious laryngotracheitis (Gallid alphaherpesvirus 1), Newcastle disease (avian paramyxovirus 1), Avian metapneumovirus infection may be confused clinically to infectious bronchitis. ===Kidney === Through viremia, some nephrotropic strains (most of high virulence) could infect the kidney epithelium in tubules and nephron, causing kidney failure. At gross examination, kidneys may appear swollen and pale in color and with urates in ureters === Reproductive system === In hens, the viremic IBV will also reach the oviduct, causing lesions in the magnum (the egg-white gland) and in the uterus (the egg-shell gland), leading to a sharp decline of egg production, shell-less, fragile or roughened shells eggs (uterus lesion) with watery whites (magnum lesion). Infection of chickens at puberty, during the oviduct development, will impede oviduct formation and destroy future laying capacity, resulting in \\"false layers\\". However, other diseases affecting layer chickens could lead to that condition. == Vaccines == There are both attenuated vaccines and inactivated vaccines available. Their effectiveness is diminished by poor cross-protection. The nature of the protective immune response to IBV is poorly understood, but the surface spike protein, the amino-terminal S1 half, is sufficient to induce good protective immunity. Experimental vector IB vaccines and genetically manipulated IBVs‚Äîwith heterologous spike protein genes‚Äîhave produced promising results, including in the context of in ovo vaccination. ==See also== *Infectious bronchitis virus D-RNA *Veterinary virology ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Poultry diseases Category:Animal virology Category:Gammacoronaviruses Category:Viral respiratory tract infections ","title":"Avian coronavirus"},{"id":"2202018","text":"Tiffany Helm (born May 12, 1964) is an American film and television actress.

A throbber is an animated graphical control element used to show that a computer program is performing an action in the background (such as downloading content, conducting intensive calculations or communicating with an external device). In contrast to a progress bar, a throbber does not convey how much of the action has been completed. == Typical characteristics == Usually the throbber is found on the right side of a program's toolbar or menu bar. The form the throbber takes varies, but it is common for it to be the logo of the program it is part of. Most of the time the throbber is a still image (known as its resting frame), but when the program is performing an action the throbber begins to animate in a loop to let the user know that the program is busy and has not frozen. Once the action is complete, the throbber returns to its resting frame. Normally, it is possible for the user to continue interacting with the program while the throbber is animating (one such possibility may be to press a stop button to cancel the action that the program is doing). Clicking on the throbber itself might perform some specific action (for example go to the program's website, pause or cancel the background action). ==History== One of the early (if not the earliest) uses of a throbber occurred in the NCSA Mosaic web browser of the early 1990s, which featured an NCSA logo that animated while Mosaic downloaded a web page. As the user could still interact with the program, the pointer remained normal (and not a busy symbol, such as an hourglass); therefore, the throbber provided a visual indication that the program was performing an action. Clicking on the throbber would stop the page loading; later web browsers added a separate Stop button for this purpose. The Netscape logo, as seen in the top right of every Netscape browser window Netscape, which soon overtook Mosaic as the market- leading web browser, also featured a throbber. In version 1.0 of Netscape, this took the form of a big blue \\"N\\" (Netscape's logo at the time). The animation depicted the \\"N\\" expanding and contracting - hence the name \\"throbber\\". When Netscape unveiled its new logo (a different \\"N\\" on top of a hill), they held a competition to find an animation for it. The winning design (featuring the new-look \\"N\\" in a meteor shower) became very well known and almost became an unofficial symbol of the World Wide Web. Later, Internet Explorer's blue \\"e\\" enjoyed similar status, though it only functioned as a throbber in early versions of the browser. The IBM WebExplorer offered a webpage the opportunity to change the look and the animation of the throbber by using proprietary HTML code. The use of web frames, a feature introduced later, leads WebExplorer to confusion on modern pages due to the way this feature was implemented. The Arena web browser has a command-line option to change the throbber with a local file. Initially, throbbers tended to be quite large, but they reduced in size along with the size of toolbar buttons as graphical user interfaces developed. Their usefulness declined somewhat as most operating systems introduced a different pointer to indicate \\"working in background\\", and they are no longer included in all web browsers. Furthermore, even web browsers that do use them depict images less elaborate than their predecessors. Many browsers ‚Äî like Mozilla Firefox, Opera and Google Chrome ‚Äî place a small annular throbber in the tab while a page is loading and replace it with the favicon of the page when loading has completed. Often browsers shipped with ISP CDs, or those customized according to co-branding agreements, have a custom throbber. For example, the version of Internet Explorer included with AOL disks has an AOL throbber instead of the standard \\"e\\". == Spinning wheel == Throbbers saw a resurgence with client side applications (such as Ajax web apps) where an application within the web browser would wait for some operation to complete. Most of these throbbers were known as a \\"spinning wheel\\", which typically consist of 8, 10, or 12 part-radial lines or discs arranged in a circle, as if on a clock face, highlighted in turn as if a wave is moving clockwise around the circle. In text user interfaces, the spinning wheel is commonly replaced by a fixed-width character which is cycled between \\"\`\`\\", \\"\`/\`\\", \\"\`-\`\\" and \\"\`\\\\\`\\" forms in order to create an animation effect. Unlike graphical activity indicators, the spinning bar is commonly combined with progress displays, since the lower resolution of character-based progress bars requires a separate indication of activity. This use dates from early versions of the UNIX operating system and DR-DOS utilities in the 1980s. == See also == * Spinning pinwheel * Windows wait cursor == References == Category:Graphical control elements Category:Technology neologisms ","title":"Throbber"},{"id":"2202047","text":"Plasmodium gallinaceum is a species of the genus Plasmodium (subgenus Haemamoeba) that causes malaria in poultry. == Description == This species was described by Alexandre Joseph Emile Brumpt (1877‚Äì1951) a French professor of parasitology during a trip to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). == References == == Further reading == Category:Poultry diseases gallinaceum Category:Veterinary protozoology Category:Parasites of birds ","title":"Plasmodium gallinaceum"},{"id":"2202054","text":"Grave at Arlington National Cemetery :For his son, the diplomat, see Frank G. Wisner. Frank Gardiner Wisner (June 23, 1909 ‚Äì October 29, 1965) was one of the founding officers of the Central Intelligence Agency and played a major role in Agency operation throughout the 1950s. Wisner began his intelligence career in the Office of Strategic Services in World War II. After the war, he headed the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), one of the OSS successor organizations, from 1948 to 1950. In 1950, the OPC was placed under the Central Intelligence Agency and renamed the Directorate of Plans. First headed by Allen Dulles, Wisner succeeded Dulles in 1951 when Dulles was named Director of Central Intelligence. Wisner remained as Deputy Director of Plans (DDP) until September 1958, playing an important role in the early history of the CIA. He suffered a breakdown in 1958, and retired from the Agency in 1962. He committed suicide in 1965. ==Education and early career == Wisner was educated at the University of Virginia, where he received both a B.A. and a LL.B. degree.Athan Theoharis, Richard Immerman, Loch Johnson, Kathryn Olmsted, and John Prados, \\"The Central Intelligence Agency: Security Under Scrutiny\\", Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 2006. He was also tapped for the Seven Society. After graduating from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1934, Wisner began working as a Wall Street lawyer for Carter, Ledyard & Milburn. ==OSS== In 1941, six months before the attack on Pearl Harbor, he enlisted in the United States Navy. He worked in the Navy's censor's office until he managed to transfer to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in 1943. He was first stationed in Cairo where he spent an uneventful year. After Cairo he spent three months in Turkey, and in August 1944 transferred to Romania, where he became head of OSS operations in southeastern Europe. Wisner arrived just as Romania joined the Allies and declared war on the Axis. His first task was to oversee the return of some 1,350 American airmen who had been shot down in missions against Romanian oilfields. The POWs were returned by a U.S. Air Crew Rescue Unit via the Pope≈üti-Leordeni Airfield.William R.

In 1945‚Äì1946, he returned to law practice at Carter, Ledyard & Milburn. ==CIA== Wisner was recruited in 1947 by Dean Acheson to join the State Department to become the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Occupied Areas. On June 18, 1948, the United States National Security Council approved NSC 10/2 which created the Office of Special Projects.https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1945-50Intel/d292 On September 1, 1948, the office was formally established, although it was renamed to the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC) for obfuscation purposes. Wisner was chosen to lead the OPC in the capacity of Assistant Director for Policy Coordination (ADPC). The OPC initially received services from the CIA but was accountable to the State Department.Foreign Relations 1964‚Äì1968, Volume XXVI, Indonesia; Malaysia-Singapore; Philippines: Note on U.S. Covert Action Programs. United States Department of State. According to its secret charter, the OPC's responsibilities include \\"propaganda, economic warfare, preventive direct action, including sabotage, antisabotage, demolition and evacuation procedures; subversion against hostile states, including assistance to underground resistance groups, guerrillas and refugee liberation groups, and support of indigenous anti-communist elements in threatened countries of the free world.\\" During the early 1950s, Wisner was the subject of FBI inquiries in connection with his wartime work in Romania, including the claim that he had an affair with Tanda Caradja, daughter of Romanian princess Catherine Caradja during the war; Caradja was alleged in FBI reports to be a Soviet agent. However, Wisner was cleared of all suspicions by the CIA Office of Security. On August 23, 1951, Wisner succeeded Allen W. Dulles and became the second Deputy Director of Plans, with Richard Helms as his chief of operations. In this position, he was instrumental in supporting pro-American forces that toppled Mohammed Mossadegh in Iran in 1953 and Jacobo Arbenz Guzm√°n in Guatemala in 1954.Operation PBSUCCESS: The United States and Guatemala, 1952‚Äì1954, CIA History Staff document by Nicholas Cullather, 1994.

He is associated with the D√ºsseldorf school of painting. ==Career== He was born in Bremen, Germany and entered the D√ºsseldorf Academy at age seventeen. Herzog achieved early commercial success, allowing him to travel widely and continue his training. His patrons included royalty and nobility throughout Europe. In the late 1860s, after an extensive trip to Norway, Herzog settled permanently near Philadelphia in the United States. Thereafter, he traveled throughout the U.S. and Mexico. He painted his way across the western states, arriving in California in 1873. His works from this trip included a series of Yosemite Valley paintings. In 1876, he received an award at the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition for his painting of Sentinel Rock in Yosemite. Herzog also made extensive trips to Maine and Florida to paint. Because he was a prudent investor, Herzog did not have to depend on the sale of his artwork to maintain a comfortable lifestyle. Following his death, his family retained a large group of his paintings, most of which were released to the art market in the 1970s. A number of prominent American and European museums now include Herzog's work as part of their collections. Herzog's work is sometimes considered to be part of the Hudson River School, although it is more realistic and less dramatic than works by peers Frederic Edwin Church or Albert Bierstadt. He almost always signed his work \\"H. Herzog\\"; as a result, his first name is spelled both \\"Herman\\" and \\"Hermann\\" in various sources. He was born on November 16, 1831 and died on February 6th, 1932 (according to his great great grandson, Scott Herzog (possessor of birth and death certificates). The Brandywine River Museum in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania held a major exhibition of Herzog's work in 1992 and published a catalog of his work, with an essay by art historian Donald S.

Ambrose became the leader of a highly acclaimed British dance band, Bert Ambrose & His Orchestra, in the 1930s. ==Early life== Ambrose was born in Warsaw in 1896, when it was part of the Russian Empire. After a time the family moved to London. They were Jewish, his father being registered as a \\"Dealer in rags\\" in the 1911 UK census, where Ambrose was named as \\"Barnett' (a \\"Violin musician student\\"). He began playing the violin while young, and travelled to New York with his aunt. He began playing professionally, first for Emil Coleman at New York's Reisenweber's restaurant, then in the Palais Royal's big band. After making a success of a stint as bandleader, at the age of 20 he was asked to put together and lead his own fifteen-piece band. After a dispute with his employer, he moved his band to another venue, where they enjoyed considerable popularity. While at the Palais Royal, on 5 June 1918, he registered for the draft (Local Board Division 169, City of NY NY, 144 St Nicholas Ave; Registration 232). He gave as his date of birth 11 September 1896; place of birth Warsaw, Russia; nationality Russian; father's birthplace Grietza, Russia; place of employment Palais Royal, 48th Street & Broadway; nearest relative Mrs Becky Ambrose, mother, 56 \\"Blaksley\\" Street, London, England. He signed as \\"Bert Ambrose\\". The registrar recorded medium height, medium build, brown hair, brown eyes and no physical disability that would render him exempt from the draft. In 1922, Ambrose returned to London, where he was engaged by the Embassy Club to form a seven-piece band. He stayed at the Embassy for two years, before walking out on his employer to take up a much more lucrative job at the Clover Gardens in New York. After a year there, besieged by continual pleas to return from his ex-employer in London, in 1925 he was finally persuaded to go back by a cable from the Prince of Wales: \\"The Embassy needs you. Come back‚ÄîEdward\\". This time Ambrose stayed at the Embassy Club until 1927. The club had a policy of not allowing radio broadcasts from its premises, however, and this was a major drawback for an ambitious bandleader, largely because the fame gained by radio work helped a band to gain recording contracts (Ambrose's band had been recorded by Columbia Records in 1923, but nothing had come of this). He therefore accepted an offer by the May Fair Hotel, with a contract that included broadcasting. His annual salary from this establishment alone was ¬£10,000. During his time at the Embassy, he married \\"Kathryn Lucille otherwise Kitty Brady\\", a 24-year-old Irish-American from New Jersey, on 20 January 1924. Oddly, he is named and signed as \\"Bernard Ambrose\\", a 27-year-old \\"Musical Director\\", on the marriage certificate. They had two daughters, Patricia S (b. 1931) and Monica J (b. 1933). Ambrose stayed at the May Fair for six years, during which time the band made recordings for Brunswick Records, HMV and Decca. He teamed up with Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, along with an American harmony song trio, the Hamilton Sisters and Fordyce (aka Three X Sisters), to record songs including \\"My Heart Stood Still\\" among others. This period also saw the musical development of the band, partly as a result of Ambrose's hiring of first-class musicians, including Sylvester Ahola, Ted Heath, Joe Crossman, Joe Jeannette, Bert Read, Joe Brannelly, Dick Escott and trumpeter Max Goldberg. ==1930s and 1940s == Gramophone record of Ambrose at the Embassy Club in 1934 In 1933, Ambrose was asked to accept a cut in pay at the May Fair; refusing, he went back to the Embassy Club, and after three years there (and a national tour), he rejected American offers and returned to the May Fair in 1936. He then went into partnership with Jack Harris, an American bandleader, and in 1937 they bought a club together, Ciro's Club. For a period of three months, they employed Art Tatum. Ambrose and Harris alternated performances at Ciro's until a disagreement led to the rupture of their partnership. Ambrose then worked at the Caf√© de Paris until the outbreak of the Second World War, when he again went on tour. His major discovery in the years leading up to the war was the singer Vera Lynn, who sang with his band from 1937 to 1940 and, during the war, became known as the \\"Forces' Sweetheart\\". Lynn married Harry Lewis, a clarinettist in the band, in 1939. Other singers with the Ambrose band included Sam Browne, Elsie Carlisle, Denny Dennis, who recorded a number of duets with Vera Lynn, Max Bacon (also the band's drummer), Evelyn Dall and Anne Shelton, with whom \\"When That Man is Dead and Gone\\", a jibe at Adolf Hitler, written by Irving Berlin, was recorded in 1941. Ambrose's signature tune was \\"When Day is Done\\". After a short period back at the May Fair Hotel, Ambrose retired from performing in 1940, although he and his orchestra continued to make records for Decca until 1947. Several members of his band became part of the Royal Air Force band, the Squadronaires, during the war. Ambrose's retirement was not permanent, however, and he formed and toured with the Ambrose Octet, and dabbled in management. ==1950s and 1960s== Tribute to Bert Ambrose at the May Fair hotel in London In the mid-1950s, despite appearances in London's West End and a number of recordings for MGM, Ambrose, in common with other bandleaders, was struggling because rock and roll had arrived. He was forced to start performing in small clubs with casual musicians, and his financial position deteriorated catastrophically. His situation was saved, however, by his discovery of the singer Kathy Kirby, whom he heard singing at the age of 16 at the Ilford Palais. He started a long personal relationship with Kirby and promoted her career. It was during the recording of one of Kirby's television programmes (at the Yorkshire Television studios) that Ambrose collapsed, dying later the same night in Leeds General Infirmary. His music was kept alive after his death by, among others, Radio 2 broadcasters Alan Dell and Malcolm Laycock, the latter continuing to play his records into the 21st century. Specialist dance band radio stations, such as Radio Dismuke and Swing Street Radio, continue to play his records. Ambrose also features regularly on the Manx Radio programme Sweet & Swing, presented by Howard Caine. Ambrose was commemorated in 2005 by a blue plaque unveiled on the May Fair Hotel. ==References== ==External links== * *Ambrose ‚Äì from the Dance Band Encyclopaedia *jabw vintage report No 6 Category:1896 births Category:1971 deaths Category:British bandleaders Category:English bandleaders Category:English violinists Category:British male violinists Category:20th- century British conductors (music) Category:20th-century violinists Category:20th-century English musicians Category:Brunswick Records artists Category:Decca Records artists Category:20th-century British male musicians ","title":"Ambrose (bandleader)"},{"id":"2202071","text":"Turn, Turn, Turn may refer to: * \\"Turn!

It is located in Marambio Island, Graham Land, Antarctic Peninsula, some from the coastal civilian village of Esperanza. At the time of its construction it was the first airfield in Antarctica and is still one of the most frequently used ones due to its suitability for wheeled landing, for which it is called \\"Antarctica's Entrance Door\\" (). It is also Argentina's most important station in the continent. Marambio is one of 13 research stations in Antarctica operated by Argentina. ==History== The increased Antarctic activity that Argentina developed since 1940 created the need for an aviation runway operable throughout the year for wheeled units. The flight of Vice-Commodore Mario Luis Olezza to the South Pole, the newly built United States McMurdo Station and the frequent operations launched from the Matienzo Station showed the need to secure better transport and communications in the sector. The Argentine Air Force set about to find a suitable spot to construct an airport. On 25 November 1968, two helicopters operating from the icebreaker ARA General San Mart√≠n descended on the Marambio Island as part of such survey. Their report favoring the place was decisive: it lacked large obstacles that could trouble aircraft maneuvering, and its long plateau was virtually free of ice. DHC-2 Beaver in Antarctica On 30 August 1969, an Air Force team led by Vice-Commodore Olezza occupied the island, carrying with them the elements needed for the construction of the projected landing track. When initially opened, the 05/23-oriented runway had a length of . It was the first one in the continent. The task took three months of work and culminated when a de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, set with conventional wheels, took off from Matienzo Station and landed on the new airport. Before the end of October the runway had already reached . C-130 and control tower, Marambio Airport The station was founded on 29 October 1969. That day a Fokker F-27 Friendship of the Argentine Air Force manned by Vice-Commodore Erwin Roberto Kern, left Rio Gallegos and landed directly in Marambio Airport, carrying on board civil and military authorities. It was the first aircraft taking off in another continent and landing in Antarctica using conventional landing gear: Antarctica was no longer an isolated place; from that day onwards all domestic and foreign Antarctic stations got interconnected with the rest of the world throughout the year. It was the most important Antarctic event in the decade. By April 1970 the runway had reached . On 11 April 1970 the Argentine Air Force began landing their C-130 Hercules on Antarctica when the TC-61 commanded by Commodore Arturo Athos Gandolfi landed in Marambio, starting a long-standing and uninterrupted tradition of air-supplying the Antarctic Argentine stations from the mainland. The Fokker F28 Fellowship presidential aircraft T-01 Patagonia was the first jet to land in Antarctica when it touched down at Marambio on 28 July 1973, 13:28 h. Commercial passenger traffic from Ushuaia has been announced for 2018.14\\\\. Flights to Antarctica ==Description== Main building Marambio has 27 buildings with a total covered area exceeding . It can host a permanent crew of 45 men and a large complement of scientific personnel, totaling about 200 people, although on average it is populated with 55 members in winter and 150 in summer. Some of the facilities are: main, dining and recreation halls; emergency house with 28-bed capacity; personnel accommodation buildings; aircraft parking platform; flight deck; airline passenger terminal; flight ground support equipment; library; mail office; gym; chapel; laundry; kitchen; two freezing chambers; snow melter; satellite dish for television and internet; radio communications station; towing and personnel carrier vehicles (including tractors, trucks and forklifts); road maintenance tools and vehicles (several snow dozers, tracked loaders and graders); mechanical, carpentry, blacksmithing, turning, plumbing and electricity workshops; laboratory with substations for APT (Automatic Picture Transmission) satellite imagery receiver, ozone and uv light measurement, sounding balloon and radiosonde setup and launching, a MBI International Meteorological Center, and others; several warehouses and deposits; fuel storage array; potable water and sewerage network; incinerator and waste disposal module, and firefighting system. \\"Patrulla Soberan√≠a\\" museum, Marambio Station The station also has CATV and public and internal mobile phone service. The medical suite is attended by one doctor and three paramedics, and has three beds and x-ray, dentistry, coronary care and telemedicine facilities. Over of Antarctic gasoil are used every year for transportation, and to feed the 1,000 kW main power plant with its three Caterpillar generators. The station also has a sewage treatment plant. Most buildings are connected together by risen metal footpaths to isolate them from snow and ice. On 2010 the Argentine company CITEDEF designed and installed a wind generator on the station. ===Airport=== The station is supported by Marambio Airport. ===Communications=== The station is connected to the Argentine mainland and the world through a satellite downlink station with telephone, fax, TV and internet. They also have a DirecTV dish which provides their service to the whole station. Argentine mobile telephone company Claro and Spanish Movistar have an antenna for local coverage. Within the station and between stations, radio is the most used mean of communication, mainly through HF, Vox/Data, aeronautic VHF-AM and UHF-FM. Internet access is provided by Speedy Argentina, allowing the personnel in the station to be permanently connected to net services. Wireless LAN and Wi-Fi cover the entire complex, becoming one of the southernmost spots in the world with a wireless network. Telephone service is provided by Telef√≥nica de Argentina at low national rates. In September 2006, a GSM mobile phone network was also added to the station, provided by the Argentine mobile operator CTI M√≥vil (now Claro). ===Scientific activities=== Scientific research at Marambio is planned and executed by specialized departments, usually during the summer campaigns: * Earth Sciences carries out paleontology, stratigraphy, sedimentology, petrography, cryology, glaciology and geodesy. * Atmospheric Sciences research include cosmic ray and ionospheric observations, and stratospheric ozone monitoring. The LAMBI Ozone Laboratory, managed by the Atmospheric Sciences station, started in 1994 to obtain ozone records by absorption. It is a joint program with the INTA (Spanish National Institute for Aerospace Technology) * Geophysics analyzes the composition, structure and mobility of the Antarctic lithosphere by seismic, magnetic, magnetotelluric and gravimetric surveys. It researches on tectonic dynamics in order to define its configuration from the Cretaceous to the present. It also conducts paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental studies to determine relevant trends during the late Cenozoic. * Dynamics and Chemistry of Ice investigates changes during the last decade in selected glaciers on the Ross and Vega islands. It also examines significant changes in the Larsen Ice Shelf and provides essential information on the distribution of Antarctic icebergs along the tracks of vessels operating in the Antarctic. * Human Impact researches environmental processes in relation to possible disturbances caused by human activities over the terrestrial ecosystem dynamics in the area of Marambio. The program develops guidelines for environmental management and monitoring. In addition Marambio is home to various ongoing scientific projects: * The Museoantar historical archaeology program undergoes recovery, preservation and restoration of the refuges built by the 1901‚Äì04 Swedish Antarctic Expedition on Snow Hill Island. * In 2011, during the \\"Mars in Marambio\\" mission, NASA scientists arrived at the station to test a new space suit designed for future exploration of Mars. * In 2013 the Finnish Meteorological Institute in co-operation with the Servicio Meteorol√≥gico Nacional and with the Argentine Air Force started a new continuous atmospheric measurement program in Marambio. Observations cover greenhouse gases (mostly CH4 and CO2) while investigating the physical, chemical and optical properties of aerosol particles and incoming and outgoing UV radiation. This scientific project made Marambio the most comprehensive atmospheric measurement station in the Antarctic continent. * The station has been chosen for the location of balloon launches of the French project Estrateole to study the ozone layer.

Nonetheless, the climate is severe with mean temperatures that rarely rise above and the presence of strong winds. The strong winds produce a wind chill that makes the temperatures feel colder. In particular, gusts up to can occur during the winter months. Due to the partial melting of snow in summer due to above freezing daytime temperatures, animals as well as limited plant life (moss, lichens, and worts) are able to thrive during the warmer months of December, January, and February. Mean monthly temperatures range from in June to in December. During summer, the average high is above freezing while the average low is . However, temperatures can reach up to or fall below during summer. In winter, the average high is while the average low is . Occasionally, temperatures can reach above freezing during winter. This occurs when warm air from the northeast (characterized by high cloud cover and fog) or from the northwest moves towards the peninsula. As the warm air crosses the mountains in the peninsula, it warms as it descends, leading to warm and dry conditions in a manner similar to a Zonda wind. Its highest recorded temperature was on 23 March 2015. This was surpassed on February 9, 2020 when a temperature of was recorded at the station. Fog frequently occurs in the station. December and January are the foggiest months, averaging 16 to 19 days with fog while June to September are the least, averaging 9 to 11 days. The station is characterized by high cloud cover throughout the year in the form of stratus clouds. Summer is the cloudiest season, averaging 24 cloudy days while winters are the least cloudiest, averaging 10 to 11 cloudy days. ==See also== * List of Antarctic research stations * List of Antarctic field camps * List of airports in Antarctica ==References== == External links == * Fuerza Aerea Argentina ‚Äì Base Marambio * Fundaci√≤n Marambio ‚Äì Base Marambio * Direcci√≥n Nacional del Ant√°rtico * Base Marambio, Antarctica Category:Argentine Antarctica Category:Populated places established in 1969 Category:Outposts of Graham Land Category:James Ross Island group Category:British Antarctic Territory Category:Chilean Antarctic Territory Category:1969 establishments in Antarctica ","title":"Marambio Base"},{"id":"2202100","text":"Transcortical motor aphasia (TMoA), also known as commissural dysphasia or white matter dysphasia, results from damage in the anterior superior frontal lobe of the language-dominant hemisphere. This damage is typically due to cerebrovascular accident (CVA). TMoA is generally characterized by reduced speech output, which is a result of dysfunction of the affected region of the brain. The left hemisphere is usually responsible for performing language functions, although left-handed individuals have been shown to perform language functions using either their left or right hemisphere depending on the individual. The anterior frontal lobes of the language-dominant hemisphere are essential for initiating and maintaining speech. Because of this, individuals with TMoA often present with difficulty in speech maintenance and initiation. Damage in the watershed region does not directly harm the areas of the brain involved in language production or comprehension; instead, the damage isolates these areas from the rest of the brain. If there is damage to the frontal lobe, executive functions related to language use are often affected. Executive functions relevant to language include activating language responses, controlling syntax (grammar), and narrative discourse. Difficulties in these areas can lead to supplementary deficits involving difficulties forming complex sentences, choosing which words to use appropriately, and initiating speech in conversation. The extent and location of the brain damage will impact the degree and variety of language functioning characteristics (i.e. damage deep to the frontal lobe and/or damage across multiple regions will greatly impair language). Right hemiparesis, or right-sided paralysis, may coincide with TMoA if the lesion in the anterior frontal lobe is large enough and extends into the posterior frontal lobe. There are some other forms of aphasia that relate to TMoA. For instance, adynamic aphasia is a form of TMoA that is characterized by sparse speech. This occurs as a result of executive functioning in the frontal lobe. Another form of aphasia related to TMoA is dynamic aphasia. Patients with this form of aphasia may present with a contiguity disorder in which they have difficulty combining linguistic elements. For dynamic aphasia, this is most apparent when the patient is asked to sequence at the sentence level whereas for other aphasias contiguity disorder can be seen at the phoneme or word level. ==Characteristics== TMoA is classified as a non-fluent aphasia that is characterized by a significantly reduced output of speech, but good auditory comprehension. Auditory comprehension skills remain intact because the arcuate fasciculus and Wernicke's area are not impaired. Individuals with TMoA also exhibit good repetition skills and can repeat long, complex phrases effortlessly and without error. However, spontaneous speech often presents with paraphasias (a wide category of speech errors that are caused by aphasia). Regardless of any relative communication strengths, individuals with TMoA are typically poor conversational partners. Due to damage in the anterior superior frontal lobe, people with TMoA have deficits in initiation and maintenance of conversations, which results in reduced speech output. A person with TMoA may seldomly produce utterances and typically remain silent. The utterances that they do produce are typically only one to two words long. However, in more structured and predictable interactions, individuals with TMoA tend to respond more fluently and promptly. In addition, these individuals are characterized by their attentiveness and cooperation and are often described as being task- oriented. == Causes == Neurological imaging has shown that TMoA is typically caused by an infarct of the anterior superior frontal lobe in the perisylvian area of the left, or language-dominant, hemisphere. The anterior superior frontal lobe is known as the prefrontal cortex which is responsible for the initiation and ideation of verbal speech. The damage leaves the major language networks, Broca's and Wernicke‚Äôs areas and the arcuate fasiculus, unaffected. Brain injury can result from a stroke caused by left anterior cerebral artery (ACA) occlusion, brain tumors, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or progressive neurological disorders. == Diagnosis == TMoA is diagnosed by the referring physician and speech-language pathologist (SLP). The overall sign of TMoA is nonfluent, reduced, fragmentary echoic, and perseverative speech with frequent hesitations and pauses. Patients with TMoA also have difficulty initiating and maintaining speech. However, speech articulation and auditory comprehension remain typical. The hallmark sign of TMoA is intact repetition in the presence of these signs and symptoms. TMoA, or any other type of aphasia, is identified and diagnosed through the screening and assessment process. Screening can be conducted by a SLP or other professional when there is a suspected aphasia. The screening does not diagnose aphasia, rather it points to the need for a further comprehensive assessment. A screening typically includes evaluation of oral motor functions, speech production skills, comprehension, use of written and verbal language, cognitive communication, swallowing, and hearing. Both the screening and assessment must be sensitive to the patient's linguistic and cultural differences. An individual will be recommended to receive a comprehensive assessment if their screening shows signs of aphasia. Under the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework, the comprehensive assessment encompasses not only speech and language, but also impairments in body structure and function, co-morbid deficits, limitations in activity and participation, and contextual (environmental and personal) factors. The assessment can be static (current functioning) or dynamic (ongoing) and the assessment tools can be standardized or nonstandardized. Typically, the assessment for aphasia includes a gathering of a case history, a self-report from the patient, an oral-motor examination, assessment of expressive and receptive language in spoken and written forms, and identification of facilitators and barriers to patient success. From this assessment, the SLP will determine type of aphasia and the patient's communicative strengths and weaknesses and how their diagnosis may impact their overall quality of life. == Treatment == Treatment for all types of aphasia, including transcortical motor aphasia, is usually provided by a speech-language pathologist. The SLP chooses specific therapy tasks and goals based on the speech and language abilities and needs of the individual. In general for individuals with TMoA, treatment should capitalize on their strong auditory comprehension and repetition skills and address the individual's reduced speech output and difficulty initiating and maintaining a conversation. New research in aphasia treatment is showing the benefit of the Life Participation Approach to Aphasia (LPAA) in which goals are written based on the skills needed by the individual patient to participate in specific real-life situations (i.e. communicating effectively with nurses or gaining employment). Based on the specific needs of the patient, SLPs can provide a variety of treatment activities. To improve word retrieval and initiation difficulties, clinicians may use confrontation naming in which the patient is asked to name various objects and pictures. Depending on the severity, they may also use sentence completion tasks in which the clinician says sentences with the final word(s) missing and expects the patient to fill in the blank. Limited research suggests that nonsymbolic limb movement on the left side (i.e. tapping the left hand on the table) during sentence production can increase verbal initiations. The use of the left arm in left space stimulates initiation mechanisms in the right hemisphere of the brain which can also be used for language allowing individuals to produce more grammatical sentences with higher fluency and more verbal initiation. To increase speech output, the clinician may provide a set of pictures and prompt the patient to describe or elaborate on the events pictured. The clinician can also provide spoken or written words and prompt the patient to use the words in a sentence. Additionally, the clinician can ask questions based on the patient's experiences, opinions, or general knowledge and prompt the patient to answer with phrases or sentences. To work on more connected speech, the clinician may ask the patient to describe procedures such as making a sandwich or doing laundry. A study found that syntax training in which sentence constructions are elicited on a hierarchy of difficulty produced gains in grammatically complete utterances and utterances that successfully communicated novel and accurate information. To improve conversational skills, SLPs may engage the patient in structured conversations in which supports are provided to help the patient take appropriate conversational turns, maintain the topic of conversation, and formulate appropriate sentences. Clinicians often need to provide pragmatic guidelines so that the patient's responses go beyond the clinician's request and so the clinician does not do the majority of the talking. Research shows that conversation therapy can improve percent of complex utterances, the efficiency of the utterances for expressing ideas, and total time spent talking over more traditional stimulation therapy. In order to improve the patient's abilities to functionally communicate in their natural settings, the SLP will provide strategies and techniques to enhance their success in communicative settings (i.e. supplementing speech with nonverbal communication). Research supports the use of reduced syntax therapy to help patients overcome the non-fluent speech and agrammatism that often occurs with TMoA. Because agrammatism inhibits the patient's ability to form grammatically correct sentences, this type of treatment involves reducing these agrammatic deficits and teaching the patient to simplify linguistic structures while still conveying the message in order for language used to be more productive in conversation. Additionally, they may train the patient's communication partners to support the conversational abilities of the patient by facilitating the use of preserved cognitive and social functions. Research supports the use of various partner training programs such as Supported Conversation for Adults with Aphasia from the Aphasia Institute. In this program, the focus is put on acknowledging the patient's competence and helping them to reveal that competence. Strategies include saying ‚ÄúI know you know‚Äù when appropriate, using gestures to supplement messages, limiting background noise, and given sufficient time for response. From a neuroscience perspective, research has found that a dopamine agonist, bromocriptine, taken by mouth, has provided positive outcomes during intervention for non-fluent types of aphasia, such as TMoA or adynamic aphasia. Studies have found that bromocriptine increased neural networks which assist with the initiation of speech in individuals who possess non-fluent characteristics of speech. In order to capitalize on neuroplasticity for treatment of all types of aphasia, timing, intensity, duration, and repetition of treatment should be taken into consideration. Research has found that aphasia treatment initiated during the earlier acute post-injury phase is more effective compared to treatment initiated in the chronic phase. With regard to intensity and duration of treatment, studies reported maximum recovery occurred with intense weekly therapy (approximately 8 hours per week) was delivered over a 2‚Äì3 month period. Other research shows that distributed therapy may be more beneficial than high intensity therapy. More research is needed to determine which is best, but it may be found that the ideal duration and intensity of therapy is variable depending on the patient and their needs. == Prognosis == In relation to other types of aphasia, TMoA occurs less frequently, so there is less information on its prognosis. In general, for individuals with aphasia, most recovery is seen within 6 months of the stroke or injury although more recovery may continue in the following months or years. The timeline of recovery may look different depending on the type of stroke that caused the aphasia. With an ischemic stroke, recovery is greatest within the first two weeks and then diminishes overtime until the progress stabilizes. With a hemorrhagic stroke, the patient often shows little improvement in the first few weeks and then has relatively rapid recovery until they stabilize. In a study involving eight patients with border zone lesions, all patients presented with transcortical mixed aphasia initially after the stroke. Three of these patients made a complete recovery within a few days post-stroke. For three other patients with more anterior lesions, their aphasia transitioned to TMoA. All participants in the study regained full language abilities within 18 months following their stroke. This suggests a positive long-term prognosis for patients with TMoA. However, this might not be the case for all patients and more research is needed in order to solidify these findings. Another study found that prognosis of TMoA is affected by lesion size. Smaller lesions typically cause delays in speech initiation; whereas, larger lesions lead to more profound language abnormalities and difficulty with abstract language abilities. Research has shown that treatment has a direct effect on aphasia outcomes. Intensity, duration and timing of treatment all need to be taken in to consideration when choosing a course of treatment and determining a prognosis. In general, greater intensity leads to greater improvement. For duration, longer-term treatment produces more permanent changes. As for timing, beginning treatment too early may be difficult for the system which has not recovered enough to do intensive therapy, but beginning too late may result missing the window of the opportunity in which the most change can occur. Neuroplasticity, the brain's natural ability to reorganize itself following a traumatic event, occurs best when treatment connects simultaneous events, maintains attention, taps into positive emotion, utilizes repetition tasks, and is specific to the individual's needs. Other factors affecting prognosis includes location and site of lesion. Since the lesion that results in TMoA usually occurs in the watershed area and does not directly involve the areas of the brain responsible for general language abilities, prognosis for these patients is good overall. Other factors that determine a patient's prognosis include age, education prior to the stroke, gender, motivation, and support. ==See also== *Transcortical sensory aphasia ==References== Category:Aphasias Category:Stroke ","title":"Transcortical motor aphasia"},{"id":"2202121","text":"Ascaridia galli is a parasitic roundworm belonging to the phylum Nematoda. Nematodes of the genus Ascaridia are essentially intestinal parasites of birds.Yamaguti, S.(1961). Systema Helminthum. 3. The nematodes of vertebrates. Interscience Publishers, New York and London, pp. 1261. A. galli is the most prevalent and pathogenic species, especially in domestic fowl, Gallus domesticus. It causes ascaridiasis, a disease of poultry due to heavy worm infection, particularly in chickens and turkeys. It inhabits the small intestine, and can be occasionally seen in commercial eggs.Griffiths HJ (1978). A Handbook of Veterinary Parasitology: Domestic Animals of North America. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, pp. 46-47. ==Description== It is the largest nematode in birds, with females measuring 72 to 112 mm long. The body is semitransparent, creamy-white, and cylindrical. The anterior end is characterized by a prominent mouth, which is surrounded by three large, trilobed lips. The edges of the lips bear teeth- like denticles. The body is entirely covered with a thick proteinaceous structure called cuticle. The cuticle is striated transversely through the length of the body and cuticular alae are poorly developed. Two conspicuous papillae are situated on the dorsal lip and one on each of the subventral lips. These papillae are the sensory organs of the nematode. A. galli is diecious with distinct sexual dimorphism. Females are considerably longer and more robust, with a vulva opening at the middle portion (roughly midway from anterior and posterior ends) of the body and anus at the posterior end of the body. The tail end of females is characteristically blunt and straight. Males are relatively shorter and smaller (measuring 50 to 76 mm long), with a distinct pointed and curved tail. Ten pairs of caudal papillae are found towards the tail region of the body, and they are arranged linearly in well- defined groups such as precloacal (three pairs), cloacal (one pair), postcloacal (one pair), and subterminal (three pairs) papillae. Eggs found in the feces of infected birds are oval with smooth shells and measure 73-92 by 45-57 microns.Soulsby, EJL (1982) Helminths, arthropods and protozoa of domesticated animals. 7th Ed. Lea & Febiger, Philadelphia pg. 164. ==Life cycle== The lifecycle of A. galli is direct in a single host, involving two principal populations, namely the sexually mature parasite in the gastrointestinal tract and the infective stage (L2). The eggs are oval in shape and have thick, albuminous shells that are highly resistant to desiccation and persist for a long time in the environment. Larvae do not hatch, but moult inside the eggs until they reach the L2 stage. This can take about two weeks, but the period depends on other factors such as the weather condition. The lifecycle is completed when the infective eggs are ingested by new hosts through contaminated water or feed. The eggs containing the L2-larvae-passive are mechanically transported to the duodenum, where they molt and become larvae stage 3 and then larvae stage 4. The infective eggs are ingested by a chicken; when it reaches the proventriculus, it hatches. Temperature, carbon dioxide levels, and pH are thought to be triggering factors that signal the larva to hatch from its egg. The larva then burrows into the mucosal lining of the small intestine, where it undergoes two additional molts. In this phase of their lifecycle, these worms cause the most damage to their hosts. They then re-enter the small intestine and develop into adults, where they live their lives out feeding on gut content and making a vast number of eggs that would then be excreted by a host and free to continue their lifecycle. If the animal is able to mount an immune response to the larvae, i.e. from pre-exposure, the larvae do not develop into adults, but hide in the mucosa of the small intestine. This is common for infection of older birds. Transport hosts such as earthworms are thought to play a role in transmission of A. galli, hence free range birds tend to have a higher risk of infection.Anderson RC (2000). Nematode Parasites of Vertebrates. Their Development and Transmission, 2nd ed. CAB International, Wallingford, Oxon, UK, pp. 265,290-299. ==Pathogenicity== The nematode infects fowl of all ages, but the greatest degree of damage is often found in birds under 12 weeks of age. Heavy infection is the major cause of weight depression and reduced egg production in poultry husbandry. In severe infections, intestinal blockage can occur. Unthriftiness, drooping of the wings, bleaching of the head, and emaciation are seen. Infection also causes loss of blood, reduced blood sugar content, increased urates, shrunken thymus glands, retarded growth, and greatly increased mortality. In heavy infections, adult worms may move up the oviduct and be found in hens' eggs, and sometimes they are also found in the birds' feces.Jacobs RD, Hogsette JA, Butcher JD (2003). Nematode parasites of poultry (and where to find them). The Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (IFAS) series PS18, University of Florida, USA, pp. 1-3. ==Treatment== Piperazine is the drug of choice. Continuous medication in feed with hygromycin B is also widely employed. Piperazine may be administered to chickens in the feed (0.2-0.4%) or water (0.1-0.2%), or as a single treatment (50‚Äì100 mg/bird). However, piperazine is quite ineffective for young chickens, while tetramisole is 89-100% effective for chicken of different ages. More recent drugs such as albendazole and levamisole are also highly effective. Fenbendazole is also very effective, 99.2-100% and 69.0-89.6% effective at administration doses of 60.6 ppm and 30.3 ppm. Ivermectin was also demonstrated to be 90 and 95% effective against immature and adult worms, respectively. == References == == External links == * BioLib * ZipcodeZoo * Worldpoultry.Net * Smallstock in Development * Mississippi State University Extension Service * Vetsweb Category:Ascaridida Category:Parasitic nematodes of vertebrates Category:Parasites of birds Category:Poultry diseases Category:Veterinary helminthology Category:Nematodes described in 1788 ","title":"Ascaridia galli"},{"id":"2202124","text":"Hellenion (Greek: ) has been used to refer to: *Hellenion (Naucratis), an Ancient Greek sanctuary in Naucratis of Egypt (founded in the 6th century BC) *Hellenion (Sparta), a temple of Zeus Sellanios in SpartaPausanias (geographer) 3.12.6The Constitutional Antiquities of Sparta and Athens Page 8 By Gustav Gilbert *Hellenion (Cairo), a short-lived association founded in early 1900s by the Greek community of Egypt.*Whose Pharaohs?: Archaeology, Museums, and Egyptian National Identity from Napoleon to WWI Page 151 By Donald Malcolm Reid *Hellenion, an active Hellenic Neopagan organization in the United States; founded in 2000.Introduction to Pagan Studies Page 156 By Barbara Jane Davy beliefnet: Reconstructionist pagans are reviving the polytheistic religions of the ancient Greeks, Druids, Egyptians, and others\\"Some still bow to ancient Greek gods\\", The Kansas City Star Aug 21, 2004Hellenismos Today Page 20 By Timothy Jay Alexander The Pagan Man: Priests, Warriors, Hunters, and Drummers Page 31 by Isaac Bonewits, Philip Emmons Isaac Bonewits ==References== Category:Set indices ","title":"Hellenion"},{"id":"2202139","text":"\\"Comrade Bingo\\" is a short story by P. G. Wodehouse, and features the young gentleman Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves. The story was published in The Strand Magazine in London in May 1922, and in Cosmopolitan in New York that same month. The story was also included in the 1923 collection The Inimitable Jeeves as two separate chapters, \\"Comrade Bingo\\" and \\"Bingo Has a Bad Goodwood\\".Cawthorne (2013), p. 59. In the story, Bertie's friend Bingo Little falls in love with a revolutionary, Charlotte Rowbotham, and joins her communist group to win her affection. ==PlotComrade Bingo=== Various groups make speeches in Hyde Park, including a communist group called \\"Heralds of the Red Dawn\\". One of them, a bearded man, denounces the Idle Rich to a crowd. Bingo Little's uncle, recently titled Lord Bittlesham, approaches Bertie. He owns Ocean Breeze, a horse on which Bertie has bet money for the Goodwood Cup. Presently, the bearded man loudly insults them. Bertie later meets Bingo at a club. Bingo is in love with Charlotte Corday Rowbotham, a member of the Red Dawn. To impress Charlotte, Bingo joined the Red Dawn. He wore a beard to not be recognized, and was the man in Hyde Park. He wants to win enough money on Ocean Breeze to marry Charlotte, but has no capital to bet with. He invites himself to Bertie's flat the next day, and will bring Charlotte, as well as her father Rowbotham and Comrade Butt, both members of the Red Dawn. The next day, they arrive at Bertie's home and dine. Rowbotham advises Bertie to join their group. He disapproves of Jeeves being a servant. Bingo and Charlotte flirt, and Comrade Butt, a rival for Charlotte's affections, is jealous. Bertie dislikes Charlotte. ===Bingo Has a Bad Goodwood=== Bertie meets Bingo and Lord Bittlesham in front of a club. Bittlesham is nervous. He has received a threatening letter from the bearded man. After Bittlesham leaves, Bingo shows Bertie that his uncle paid him fifty pounds to investigate the threat. Bingo will bet the money on Ocean Breeze. Bingo and Charlotte spend time together. Jeeves meets with Comrade Butt one evening, and reports that Butt feels rejected. At Goodwood, Bertie is disappointed when Ocean Breeze loses. Meanwhile, Lord Bittlesham is concerned because the bearded man, secretly Bingo, is there giving a speech. Bingo, who has lost his wager on Ocean Breeze, rants passionately against wealthy horse owners. Comrade Butt then speaks, but is less successful with the crowd than Bingo. After noticing Lord Bittlesham, Butt excites the crowd by exposing Bingo as Bittlesham's nephew, which gets Bingo in trouble with his uncle. Two days later, Bertie learns that Bingo intends to go to the country for a while. Jeeves explains to Bertie that he informed Comrade Butt about Bingo being Lord Bittlesham's nephew. Pleased, Bertie tells Jeeves he may take the notes and coins on the dressing table, which amounts to fourteen pounds, one shilling, six pence, and a halfpenny. ==Background== At the beginning of the story, Bingo implies to Bertie that Lord Bittlesham must have paid a significant amount of money for his new title. This is a reference to the \\"cash for honors\\" scandal during that period, when Prime Minister David Lloyd George's government was accused of openly selling peerages at an unprecedented scale.Cawthorne (2013), p. 59. ==Publication history== 1922 Strand illustration by A. Wallis Mills The story was illustrated by A. Wallis Mills in the Strand, and by T. D. Skidmore in Cosmopolitan.McIlvaine (1990), p. 147, D17.18, and p. 184, D133.87. A collection of animal-related Wodehouse stories, A Wodehouse Bestiary, published by Ticknor & Fields in 1985, featured the story.McIlvaine (1990), p. 130, B34a. \\"Comrade Bingo\\" was included along with \\"The Rummy Affair of Old Biffy\\" in the 1976 anthology Classics of Humour, illustrated by Donald Room and published by Book Club Association. The anthology was later reissued in 1978 with the title Great Tales of Humour, published by Everyman's Library.McIlvaine (1990), p. 196, E83. ==AdaptationsTelevision=== This story was adapted into part of the Jeeves and Wooster episode \\"Aunt Dahlia, Cornelia and Madeline\\", the sixth episode of the third series, which first aired in the UK on 3 May 1992. There are some differences in plot, including: * In the episode, Bertie and Jeeves pretend to be sympathetic to the communist group. Jeeves pretends to be Bertie's \\"comrade\\" and not his servant. * In the episode, Spode, having become Lord Sidcup, holds a farewell rally to his fascist group, the Black Shorts, at Goodwood, and Bingo is inspired to give a rousing speech to outdo Spode. * In the episode, when revealing Bingo Little as Lord Bittlesham's nephew, Comrade Butt portrays Bingo as a villainous infiltrator rather than as a supporter of their group. A chaotic melee ensues, in which the Black Shorts fight against the Red Dawn, and Charlotte angrily knocks out Bingo. ===Radio=== This story, along with the rest of The Inimitable Jeeves, was adapted into a radio drama in 1973 as part of the series What Ho! Jeeves starring Michael Hordern as Jeeves and Richard Briers as Bertie Wooster. ==References== ;Notes ;Sources * * * ==External links== * The Russian Wodehouse Society's page, with numerous book covers and lists of characters Category:1922 short stories Category:Short stories by P.

It was found in the 1960s, with its feature of using methanol, as a source of carbon and energy. After years of study, P. pastoris was widely used in Biochemical research and Biotech industries. With strong potential for being an expression system for protein production, as well as being a model organism for genetic study, P. pastoris has become important for biological research and biotech applications. In the last decade, some reports reassigned P. pastoris to the genus Komagataella with phylogenetic analysis, by genome sequencing of P. pastoris. The species was split into K. phaffii, K. pastoris, and K. pseudopastoris. ==P. pastoris in natureNatural habitat=== Naturally, P. pastoris live on treesÔºåsuch as chestnut trees. They are heterotrophs and they can use several carbon sources for living, like glucose, glycerol and methanol. However, they cannot use lactose. ===Reproduction=== P. pastoris can undergo both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction, by budding and ascospore. In this case, two types of cells of P. pastoris exist: haploid and diploid cells. In the asexual life cycle, haploid cells undergo mitosis for reproduction. In the sexual life cycle, diploid cells undergo sporulation and meiosis. The growth rate of its colonies can vary by a large range, from near to 0 to a doubling time of one hour, which is suitable for industrial processes. ==P. pastoris as a model organism== In the last few years, P. pastoris was investigated and identified as a good model organism with several advantages. First of all, P. patoris can be grown and used easily in lab. Like other widely used yeast models, it has relatively short life span and fast regeneration time. Moreover, some inexpensive culture media have been designed, so that P. patoris can grow quickly on them, with high cell density. Whole genome sequencing for P. patoris had been performed. The P. pastoris GS115 genome has been sequenced by the Flanders Institute for Biotechnology and Ghent University, and published in Nature Biotechnology. The genome sequence and gene annotation can be browsed through the ORCAE system. The complete genomic data allows scientists to identify homologous proteins and evolutionary relationships between other yeast species and P. pastoris. Furthurmore, P. pastoris are single eukaryotic cells, which means researchers could investigate the proteins inside P. pastoris. Then the homologous comparison to other more complicated eukaryotic species can be processed, to obtain their functions and origins. Another advantage of P. pastoris is its similarity to the well-studied yeast model ‚Äî Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As a model organism for biology, S. cerevisiae have been well studied for decades and used by researchers for various purposes throughout history. The two yeast genera; Pichia and Saccharomyces, have similar growth conditions and tolerances; thus, the culture of P. pastoris can be adopted by labs without many modifications. Moreover, unlike S. cerevisiae, P. pastoris has the ability to functionally process proteins with large molecular weight, which is useful in a translational host. Considering all the advantages, P. pastoris can be usefully employed as both a genetic and experimental model organism. ===P. pastoris as a genetic model organism=== As a genetic model organism, P. pastoris can be used for genetic analysis and large-scale genetic crossing, with complete genome data and its ability to carry out complex eukaryotic genetic processing in a relatively small genome. The functional genes for peroxisome assembly were investigated by comparing wild-type and mutant strains of P. pastoris. ===P. pastoris as an experimental model organism=== As an experimental model organism, P. pastoris was mainly used as the host system for transformation. Due to its ablities of recombination with foreign DNA and processing large proteins, much research has been carry out to investigate the possibility of producing new proteins and the function of artificially designed proteins, using P. pastoris as a transformation host. In the last decade, P. pastoris was engineered to build expression system platforms, which is a typical application for a standard experimental model organism, as described below. ==P. pastoris as expression system platform== P. pastoris is frequently used as an expression system for the production of heterologous proteins. Several properties make P. pastoris suited for this task. Currently, several strains of P. pastoris are used for biotechnical purposes, with significant differences among them in growth and protein production. Some common variants possess a mutation in the HIS4 gene, leading to the selection of cells which are transformed successfully with expression vectors. The technology for vector integration into P. pastoris genome is similar to that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. ===Advantage=== 1:P. pastoris is able to grow on simple, inexpensive medium, with high growth rate. P. pastoris can grow in either shake flasks or a fermenter, which makes it suitable for both small- and large-scale production. 2:P. pastoris has two alcohol oxidase genes, Aox1 and Aox2, which include strongly inducible promoters. These two genes allow Pichia to use methanol as a carbon and energy source. The AOX promoters are induced by methanol, and repressed by glucose. Usually, the gene for the desired protein is introduced under the control of the Aox1 promoter, which means that protein production can be induced by the addition of methanol on medium. After several researches, scientists found that the promotor derived from AOX1 gene in P. pastoris is extremely suitable to control the expression of foreign genes, which had been transformed into the P. pastoris genome, producing heterologous proteins. 3: With a key trait, P. pastoris can grow with extremely high cell density on the culture. This feature is compatible with heterologous protein expression, giving higher yields of production. 4: The technology required for genetic manipulation of P. pastoris is similar to that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is one of the most well-studied yeast model organisms. As a result, the experiment protocol and materials are easy to build for P. pastoris. ===Disadvantage=== As some proteins require chaperonin for proper folding, Pichia is unable to produce a number of proteins, since P. pastoris does not contain the appropriate chaperones. The technologies of introducing genes of mammalian chaperonins into the yeast genome and overexpressing existing chaperonins still require improvement ===Comparison with other expression systems=== In standard molecular biology research, the bacterium Escherichia coli is the most frequently used organism for expression system, to produce heterologous proteins, due to its features of fast growth rate, high protein production rate, as well as undemanding growth conditions. Protein production in E. coli is usually faster than that in P. pastoris, with reasons: Competent E. coli cells can be stored frozen, and thawed before use, whereas Pichia cells have to be produced immediately before use.Expression yields in Pichia vary between different clones, so that a large number of clones has to be screened for protein production, to find the best producer. The biggest advantage of Pichia over E. coli is that Pichia is capable of forming disulfide bonds and glycosylations in proteins, but E. coli cannot. E. coli might produce a misfolded protein when disulfides are included in final product, leading to inactive or insoluble forms of proteins. The well-studied Saccharomyces cerevisiae is also used as an expression system with similar advantages over E. coli as Pichia. However Pichia has two main advantages over S. cerevisiae in laboratory and industrial settings: #Pichia, as mentioned above, is a methylotroph, meaning that it can grow with the simple methanol, as the only source of energy ‚Äî Pichia can grow fast in cell suspension with reasonably strong methanol solution, which would kill most other micro-organisms. In this case, the expression system is cheap to set up and maintain. #Pichia can grow up to a very high cell density. Under ideal conditions, it can multiply to the point where the cell suspension is practically a paste. As the protein yield from expression system in a microbe is roughly equal to the product of the proteins produced per cell, which makes Pichia of great use when trying to produce large quantities of protein without expensive equipment. Comparing to other expression systems, such as S2-cells from Drosophila melanogaster and Chinese hamster ovary cells, Pichia usually gives much better yields.Generally, cell lines from multicellular organisms require complex and expensive types of media, including amino acids, vitamins, as well as other growth factors. These types of media significantly increase the cost of producing heterologous proteins. Additionally, since Pichia can grow in media containing only one carbon source and one nitrogen source, which is suitable for isotopic labelling applications, like protein NMR. ==Industrial applications== P. pastoris have been used in several kinds of biotech industries, such as pharmaceutical industry. All the applications are based on its feature of expressing proteins. ===Biotherapeutic production=== In the last few years, Pichia pastoris had been used for the production of over 500 types of biotherapeutics, such as IFNŒ≥. At the beginning, one drawback of this protein expression system is the over-glycosylation with high density of mannose structure, which is a potential cause of immunogenicity. In 2006, a research group managed to create a new strain called YSH597. This strain can express erythropoietin in its normal glycosylation form, by exchanging the enzymes responsible for the fungal type glycosylation, with the mammalian homologs. Thus, the altered glycosylation pattern allowed the protein to be fully functional. ===Enzyme production for food industry=== In food industries, like brewery and bake house,Pichia pastoris is used to produce different kinds of enzymes, as processing aids and food additives, with many functions. For example, some enzymes produced by genetically modified Pichia pastoris can keep the bread soft. Meanwhile, in beer, enzymes could be used to lower the alcohol concentration. == References == Category:Saccharomycetaceae Category:Fungal models Category:Yeasts Category:Fungi described in 1956 ","title":"Pichia pastoris"},{"id":"2202164","text":"Areas affected in Mixed Transcortical Aphasia Mixed transcortical aphasia is the least common of the three transcortical aphasias (behind transcortical motor aphasia and transcortical sensory aphasia, respectively). This type of aphasia can also be referred to as \\"Isolation Aphasia\\". This type of aphasia is a result of damage that isolates the language areas (Broca‚Äôs, Wernicke‚Äôs, and the arcuate fasciculus) from other brain regions. Broca‚Äôs, Wernicke‚Äôs, and the arcuate fasiculus are left intact; however, they are isolated from other brain regions.

Aphasia is one type of a neurogenic cognitive-communicative disorder which presents with impaired comprehension and production of speech and language, usually caused by damage in the language-dominant, left hemisphere of the brain. Aphasia is any disorder of language that causes the patient to have the inability to communicate, whether it is through writing, speaking, or sign language.Yavuzer G. 2010. Aphasia. In: JH Stone, M Blouin, editors. International Encyclopedia of Rehabilitation. Available online: http://cirrie.buffalo.edu/encyclopedia/en/article/9/#s10 ==Symptoms/Language Characteristics== Mixed transcortical aphasia is characterized by severe speaking and comprehension impairment, but with preserved repetition. People who suffer mixed transcortical aphasia struggle greatly to produce propositional language or to understand what is being said to them, yet they can repeat long, complex utterances or finish a song once they hear the first part. Persons with mixed transcortical aphasia are often nonfluent, and in most cases do not speak unless they are spoken to, do not comprehend spoken language, cannot name objects, and cannot read or write. However, they often have the ability to repeat what is said to them. In fact, persons with mixed transcortical aphasia often repeat in a parrot-like fashion. Some patients with this disorder can experience many different types neurological symptoms including, bilateral paralysis, lack of voluntary speech, and difficulty with producing spontaneous speech.Scott, S. (2000, February 9). Talk about different aphasic syndromes, and how different aspects relate to different neuroanatomical damage.

Yes. Clinician: How are you doing today? Patient: How are you doing today? Clinician: I‚Äôm very fine, thank you. How are you doing? Patient: I‚Äôm very fine, thank you. Clinician: My name is Mary. I‚Äôll be working with you today. Patient: My name is Mary. I‚Äôm working today. In this rare type of aphasia, Broca's area, Wernicke's area, and the arcuate fasciculus are intact but the watershed region around them is damaged. This damage isolates these areas from the rest of the brain. The most frequent etiology of mixed transcortical aphasia is stenosis (narrowing) of the internal carotid artery. Mixed transcortical aphasia can also occur after cerebral hypoxia, cerebral swelling, and any stroke that affects the cerebral artery.Brookshire, R. (2007).

Studies have looked into ways to enhance verbal communication with therapy, and one of the treatment approaches that proved to be successful is \\"Drawing Therapy\\". Drawing offers an alternative route to access semantic information. Because of this, it provides adults who have lost language with a means to access and express their ideas, emotions, and feelings. Drawing has also been shown to activate right hemisphere regions. This makes drawing a non-linguistic intervention that can access semantic knowledge in the right hemisphere.Farias, et al, (2006). Drawing; Its contribution to naming in aphasia. Brain and Language, 53-63. The study conducted on drawing therapy found that it increased naming abilities in patients with acute and chronic aphasia. It also produced fewer error attempts during naming tasks. The study also found that the act of drawing itself, not the quality, was critical for the activation of the semantic-lexical network required for naming tasks. Other studies have also reported that family members have seen the effects of therapy at home.Sacchett, C, et al, (1999). Drawing together: Evaluation of a therapy program for severe aphasia. International Journal of Language and Communication Disroders, 26-289. The gains made from drawing therapy were not ones that could have been made from spontaneous recovery. Drawing therapy was especially found to be useful in individuals with global and anomic aphasia. Both of these individuals were found to have produced more verbalizations post-therapy. This reinforces the idea that drawing provides a mean of recruiting areas or networks that were not otherwise sufficient for producing speech. Across the majority of patients, the quality of drawing improved as well as written output and sentence structure.Hunt, J. (1999). Drawing on the semantic system: The use of drawing as a therapy medium. In S. Byng, K. Swinburn & C. Pound (Eds.), The Aphasia Therapy File (pp. 41-60). Hove: Psychology Press. Drawing therapy has proved to be effective even after a few periods of therapy.(Hunt, 199Hunt, J. (1999). Drawing on the semantic system: The use of drawing as a therapy medium. In S. Byng, K. Swinburn & C. Pound (Eds.), The Aphasia Therapy File (pp. 41-60). Hove: Psychology Press.9) Although this therapy is aimed at patients with aphasia, it can be implemented for any patient with expressive deficits. Drawing therapy can be implemented in the following hierarchy: 1\\\\. Clinician gives patient a prompt and asks them to draw a response 2\\\\. Clinician asks for clarification of drawing if it is unclear (add more detail, enlarge one aspect of the drawing) 3\\\\. If possible, patient verbalizes about their drawing and assigns language Drawing therapy can also be made harder through the type of prompt given and the task difficulty. Prompts and questions that are opened ended and with broad semantic categories are going to be harder to conceptualize and draw. It is a harder task when the client is asked to draw abstract concepts or sequenced actions/events. If a client has deficits in the following areas, drawing therapy might be an appropriate therapy technique: Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) 1\\\\. Responsive Speech (\\"What do you write with?\\") 2\\\\. Spontaneous Speech a. Conversational questions b. Picture descriptions Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE) 1\\\\. Oral expression (word reading, sentence reading) 2\\\\. Written section (writing to dictation, writing to describe a picture) Overall, drawing therapy offers a means of accessing language to patients with aphasia who have difficulty expressing themselves with different modalities. ==Assessment== For most patients, formal and informal language assessments are initially administered during his/her acute hospital stay by a licensed speech-language pathologist. However, a standardized assessment may provide further information regarding an aphasia classification. While there are different classifications of aphasia (i.e., Broca‚Äôs, Wernicke‚Äôs, Conduction, Anomia), they each have hallmark deficits. Research has shown, a patient presenting with mixed transcortical aphasia will have impairments in all communicative areas, with the exception of the preserved ability to repeat a person‚Äôs words or phrases.Brookshire, R. H. (2007). Introduction to neurogenic communication disorders (Seventh edition). St. Louis, MO.: Mosby Elsevier. Patients with mixed transcortical aphasia demonstrate similar deficits as those seen in patients with global aphasia. Therefore, assessment of repetition is most critical in order to differentially diagnose. Specifically, language based standardized assessments such as the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB), and the Folstein Mini Mental State Exam include a repetition subtest amongst all other language-related areas. Other possible assessments that can provide further differentiation include: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) CT scan Informal observation It is important to remain diligent in providing therapy regardless of aphasia classification. ==Prognosis== If brain damage is minimal then a patient may recover language skills over time without treatment, however if the damage is severe it may be necessary to receive speech and language therapy. Recovery from this type of brain injury is a slow process and very few patients regain the same level of language and communication skills that they have before the injury. Patients with aphasia usually undergo speech therapy where they relearn and practice supplementary communication methods. Speech therapy is not a cure for the aphasia, but instead helps patients use skills that remain intact. When considering the prognosis for individuals with aphasia it is necessary to consider internal factors, patient specific factors, and external factors as these factors are considered most critical to post-stroke recovery. Internal factors are factors related to the stroke such as aphasia severity, lesion site and lesion size . Individuals with milder forms of aphasia, lesions that insignificantly impact language function and smaller lesions tend to have a higher degree of aphasia recovery. Lesions in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) produce a more persistent global aphasia, which is associated with poor aphasia recovery. Patient specific factors relate to the patient's age of onset, education level and motivation for recovery. Younger patients have been reported to demonstrate a higher recovery rate than older patients. Those with more years of education are less vulnerable to language disruption by stroke. External factors include environmental factors such as type and amount of language treatment provided. Stroke patients who are generally aware of their handicap and receive good support show more motivation and are more likely to have a better outcome.Watila, M., & Balarabe, S.

It is named after J√≥zsef Marek, a Hungarian veterinarian. Marek's disease is caused by an alphaherpesvirus known as 'Marek's disease virus' (MDV) or Gallid alphaherpesvirus 2 (GaHV-2). The disease is characterized by the presence of T cell lymphoma as well as infiltration of nerves and organs by lymphocytes. Viruses related to MDV appear to be benign and can be used as vaccine strains to prevent Marek's disease. For example, the related Herpesvirus of Turkeys (HVT), causes no apparent disease in turkeys and continues to be used as a vaccine strain for prevention of Marek's disease (see below). Birds infected with GaHV-2 can be carriers and shedders of the virus for life. Newborn chicks are protected by maternal antibodies for a few weeks. After infection, microscopic lesions are present after one to two weeks, and gross lesions are present after three to four weeks. The virus is spread in dander from feather follicles and transmitted by inhalation. ==Syndromes== Left‚Äînormal chicken eye. Right‚ÄîEye of a chicken with Marek's disease Six syndromes are known to occur after infection with Marek's disease. These syndromes may overlap. *Classical Marek's disease or neurolymphomatosis causes asymmetric paralysis of one or more limbs. With vagus nerve involvement, difficulty breathing or dilation of the crop may occur. Besides lesions in the peripheral nerves, there are frequently lymphomatous infiltration/tumours in the skin, skeletal muscle, visceral organs. Organs that are commonly affected include the ovary, spleen, liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, proventriculus and adrenals. *Acute Marek's disease is an epidemic in a previously uninfected or unvaccinated flock, causing depression, paralysis, and death in a large number of birds (up to 80%). The age of onset is much earlier than the classic form; birds are four to eight weeks old when affected. Infiltration into multiple organs/tissue is observed. *Ocular lymphomatosis causes lymphocyte infiltration of the iris (making the iris turn grey), unequal size of the pupils, and blindness. *Cutaneous Marek's disease causes round, firm lesions at the feather follicles. *Atherosclerosis is induced in experimentally infected chickens. *Immunosuppression ‚Äì Impairment of the T-lymphocytes prevents competent immunological response against pathogenic challenge and the affected birds become more susceptible to disease conditions such as coccidiosis and Escherichia coli infection . Furthermore, without stimulation by cell-mediated immunity, the humoral immunity conferred by the B-cell lines from the Bursa of Fabricius also shuts down, thus resulting in birds that are totally immunocompromised. ==Diagnosis== Diagnosis of lymphoid tumors in poultry is complicated due to multiple etiological agents capable of causing very similar tumors. It is not uncommon that more than one avian tumor virus can be present in a chicken, thus one must consider both the diagnosis of the disease/tumors (pathological diagnosis) and of the virus (etiological diagnosis). A step-wise process has been proposed for diagnosis of Marek's disease which includes (1) history, epidemiology, clinical observations and gross necropsy, (2) characteristics of the tumor cell, and (3) virological characteristics The demonstration of peripheral nerve enlargement along with suggestive clinical signs in a bird that is around three to four months old (with or without visceral tumors) is highly suggestive of Marek's disease. Histological examination of nerves reveals infiltration of pleomorphic neoplastic and inflammatory lymphocytes. Peripheral neuropathy should also be considered as a principal rule-out in young chickens with paralysis and nerve enlargement without visceral tumors, especially in nerves with interneuronal edema and infiltration of plasma cells. The presence of nodules on the internal organs may also suggest Marek's disease, but further testing is required for confirmation. This is done through histological demonstration of lymphomatous infiltration into the affected tissue. A range of leukocytes can be involved, including lymphocytic cell lines such as large lymphocyte, lymphoblast, primitive reticular cells, and occasional plasma cells, as well as macrophage and plasma cells. The T cells are involved in the malignancy, showing neoplastic changes with evidence of mitosis. The lymphomatous infiltrates need to be differentiated from other conditions that affect poultry including lymphoid leukosis and reticuloendotheliosis, as well as an inflammatory event associated with hyperplastic changes of the affected tissue. Key clinical signs as well as gross and microscopic features that are most useful for differentiating Marek's disease from lymphoid leukosis and reticuloendotheliosis include (1) Age: MD can affect birds at any age, including <16 weeks of age; (2) Clinical signs: Frequent wing and leg paralysis; (3) Incidence: >5% in unvaccinated flocks; (4) Potential nerve enlargement; (5) Interfollicular tumors in the bursa of Fabricius; (6) CNS involvement; (7) Lymphoid proliferation in skin and feather follicles; (8) Pleomorphic lymphoid cells in nerves and tumors; and (9) T-cell lymphomas.\\"Chapter 2.3.13. Marek‚Äôs Disease\\" , OIE Terrestrial Manual 2010, Retrieved 2012-08-03 In addition to gross pathology and histology, other advanced procedures used for a definitive diagnosis of Marek's disease include immunohistochemistry to identify cell type and virus-specific antigens, standard and quantitative PCR for identification of the virus, virus isolation to confirm infections, and serology to confirm/exclude infections. The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reference laboratory for Marek's disease is Avian Viral Oncogenesis group (led by Professor Venugopal Nair OBE) at The Pirbright Institute, UK .\\"Reference Experts and Laboratories\\", World Organisation for Animal Health, Retrieved 2018-12-13 PCR blood testing can also detect Mareks Disease, and proper testing can differentiate between a vaccinated bird with antibodies and a true positive for Mareks Disease. Mareks Disease is not treatable, however supportive care can help. It is recommended that all flocks positive for Mareks Disease remain closed, with no bird being introduced or leaving the flock. Strict bio security and proper cleaning is essential, using products like Activated Oxine or Virkon S and reducing dander buildup in the environment. Proper diet, regular deworming and vitamin supplements can also help keep infected flocks healthier. Reducing stress is also a key component, as stress will often bring about illness in birds infected with Mareks Disease. ==Prevention== Vaccination is the only known method to prevent the development of tumors when chickens are infected with the virus. However, administration of vaccines does not prevent transmission of the virus, i.e., the vaccine is not sterilizing. However, it does reduce the amount of virus shed in the dander, hence reduces horizontal spread of the disease. Marek's disease does not spread vertically. Before the development of the vaccine for Marek's disease, Marek's disease caused substantial revenue loss in the poultry industries of the United States and the United Kingdom. The vaccine can be administered to one-day-old chicks through subcutaneous inoculation or by in ovo vaccination when the eggs are transferred from the incubator to the hatcher. In ovo vaccination is the preferred method, as it does not require handling of the chicks and can be done rapidly by automated methods. Immunity develops within two weeks. However, because vaccination does not prevent infection with the virus, Mareks is still transmissible from vaccinated flocks to other birds, including the wild bird population. The first Marek's disease vaccine was introduced in 1970. The disease would cause mild paralysis, with the only identifiable lesions being in neural tissue. Mortality of chickens infected with Marek's disease was quite low. Decades after the first vaccine was introduced, current strains of Marek Virus cause lymphoma formation on throughout the chicken's body and mortality rates have reached 100% in unvaccinated chickens. The Marek's disease vaccine is a leaky vaccine, which means that only the symptoms of the disease are prevented. Infection of the host and the transmission of the virus are not inhibited by the vaccine. This contrasts with most other vaccines, where infection of the host is prevented. Under normal conditions, highly virulent strains of the virus are not selected. A highly virulent strain would kill the host before the virus would have an opportunity to transmit to other potential hosts and replicate. Thus, less virulent strains are selected. These strains are virulent enough to induce symptoms but not enough to kill the host, allowing further transmission. However, the leaky vaccine changes this evolutionary pressure and permits the evolution of highly virulent strains. The vaccine's inability to prevent infection and transmission allows the spread of highly virulent strains among vaccinated chickens. The fitness of the more virulent strains are increased by the vaccine. The evolution of Marek's disease due to vaccination has had a profound effect on the poultry industry. All chickens across the globe are now vaccinated against Marek's disease (birds hatched in private flocks for laying or exhibition are rarely vaccinated). Highly virulent strains have been selected to the point that any chicken that is unvaccinated will die if infected. Other leaky vaccines are commonly used in agriculture. One vaccine in particular is the vaccine for avian influenza. Leaky vaccine use for avian influenza can select for virulent strains which could potentially be transmitted to humans. == References == == External links == * Marek's Disease Information at poultrykeeper.com Category:Poultry diseases Category:Animal virology ","title":"Marek's disease"},{"id":"2202183","text":"Kallen is both a surname and a given name.

Pyranja started rapping at the age of 16. Early supporters and precursors were the rap crews DSC and the Underdog Cru. After a yearlong stay in Boston she went back to Germany, more precisely to Berlin. She socialized in the scene very quickly and many contributions for other artists followed. The label Def Jam Germany showed great interest in the upcoming rap artist and so she released her first EP, called \\"Im Kreis \\", in 2001. She even entered the German charts without any promotion. When the production of her album Wurzeln & Fl√ºgel was already finished and the date of release was set, Def Jam broke up because of the difficult market situation. Later Wurzeln & Fl√ºgel was released by another label called Dackel Enterprise. The sales figures of this record also surpassed all expectations and steadied her good reputation as \\"best female German rapper\\". In 2004 Pyranja and her colleagues Joe Rilla, Dra-Q, Jamie White and Sera Finale founded the rap crew Ostblokk. Since they had known each other for a long time and had already used the same studios, the collaboration was a logical conclusion. The CD Einmal um Blokk was released and became very successful. In 2004 Pyranja also released her CD Frauen & Technik by her own independent label Pyranja Records. This record turned out to be the most multifaced in her career. It does not only convince by her familiar calm and profound songs but also reflects the rough side of Pyranja. Using the pseudonym Christiane Latte for her tracks Ab 18 and Blondes Gift she performed as sassy as many of her male colleagues. The ironic dig at the male-dominated rap-branche was made with intent. In 2006, the new single \\"Nie wieder\\" and the album Laut & Leise have been released. Furthermore she performed for her home state, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, at this year's Bundesvision Song Contest and made eighth place. == Discography  Albums === * 2003 - Wurzeln & Fl√ºgel (\\"Wings & Roots\\", Dackel Enterprise) * 2004 - Frauen & Technik (\\"Women & Technology\\", Pyranja Records) * 2004 - Einmal Um Blokk, (\\"Once around the block\\" with Ostblokk, Ostblokk Plattenbau) * 2006 - Laut & Leise (\\"Loud & Quiet\\", Headrush) === Singles and EPs === * 2002 - \\"Swingerclub\\" (Phlatline Records) * 2002 - \\"Fremdk√∂rper / Kennzeichen D Pt.2\\" (\\"Foreign object / License Plate D Pt 2\\", Def Jam Promo) * 2000 - \\"Im Kreis / Nachtflug\\" (\\"In a circle / Night flight\\", Def Jam Promo) * 2001 - \\"Im Kreis EP\\" (Def Jam Germany) * 2002 - \\"Reine Nervensache\\" (\\"All about strength of nerves\\", Def Jam Promo) * 2003 - \\"Egal Was Ihr Sagt\\" (\\"No matter what you say\\", Dackel Enterprise) * 2004 - \\"Zeilen F√ºr Dich\\" (\\"Lines for you\\", Pyranja Records) * 2005 - \\"Samba\\" (with Ostbokk, Ostblokk Plattenbau) * 2005 - \\"Pyranja vs. Laudert & Fr√∂hlich\\" (Pyranja Records) * 2006 - \\"Nie Wieder\\" (\\"Never again\\", Pyranja Records) === Other === * 1998 - Feature on the Underdog Cru album Maximum * 1998 - Track the EP \\"Gro√ümogul Nordost\\" * 1998 - Demotape * 1999 - Track with Daniel Santiago for the Compilation Beastside * 1999 - Feature on the Joe Rilla tape album Tritt 2000 √Ñrsche (\\"Kick 2000 asses\\") * 1999 - Track with Daniel Santiago on the compilation Sallys Sounds * 2000 - Track on the soundtrack to Ants in the Pants * 2000 - Track on the DJ Derezon tape album BerlinXklusiv * 2000 - Track on the Deja Vue album Zwei Dumme ein Gedanke (\\"Two idiots one idea\\") * 2001 - Several tracks on compilations, among others: Rappublik Sampler, Berlin macht Schule, Juice Master Blaster, Ladys First, Splash Allstar Event Album, Def Jam Unstoppable * 2001 - \\"Nachtflug RMX\\" on the Roey Marquis album Momentaufnahmen (\\"Snapshots\\") * 2001 - \\"Special Broadcast\\" with Fiva Mc on the \\"Beatz aus der Bude Allstars\\" compilation * 2002 - Feature on the Roey Marquis tape Battle Of The Words * 2002 - Feature on Moqui Marbles' album * 2002 - Feature on album \\"Kopfhoehrer\\" by Fiva MC & DJ Radrum, Track \\"Kopf Hoch\\" * 2002 - Feature on Roey Marquis' album \\"Herzessenz\\" (\\"Essence of the heart\\") * 2003 - Several tracks on compilations, among others: Untergrund Experiment, Starting Line-Up XXL Dope Beats, Ghetto Fabulous * 2003 - Several features on the soundtrack to the hip hop themed feature film \\"Status Yo\\" * 2004 - Feature on Kimoe's EP \\"Ein neuer Morgen\\" (\\"A new morning\\") * 2004 - Feature on Jago's LP * 2004 - Feature on Yaneq & Freaky Floe's EP \\"Nachts Drau√üen\\" (\\"Outside at night\\") * 2004 - Feature on Moqui Marbles' LP * 2005 - Feature on \\"Back in the Tapez\\" by DraQ & Jamie White * 2006 - \\"Guess who's back\\", track on \\"Juice Exclusive\\" sampler #61 ==See also== * List of German hip hop musicians == External links == *Official website (with info; pictures, lyrics, downloads...) *Ostblokk website (with info, pictures, downloads, includes message board...) *Ostblokk Fanpage (info, large picture gallery, interview collection...) * Pyranja: Portrait * Interview Category:German rappers Category:German female rappers Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:People from Rostock Category:Participants in the Bundesvision Song Contest ","title":"Pyranja"},{"id":"2202200","text":"Kallenbach is a German surname.

Nicknamed \\"de Palingboeren\\", the club was founded as Victoria in 1920, changed its name to RKSV Volendam in 1923 and emerged as an exclusively professional club, FC Volendam, in 1977, following a split from its parent club. The team plays its home matches in the 6,984-capacity Kras Stadion, where it has been based since 1975. The club has a reputation as the heen-en- weer club (\\"the back-and-forth club\\") due to its numerous promotions and relegations between the first and second tiers of Dutch football. They have achieved nine promotions to the Eredivisie; a record. Volendam also reached two KNVB Cup finals - in 1957‚Äì58 and 1994‚Äì95 - which ended in losses to two Rotterdam-based clubs, Sparta and Feyenoord, respectively. ==HistoryBeginnings (1920‚Äì1955)=== Football Club Volendam was founded as Victoria on 1 June 1920 by local fishermen. By 1923, the club was renamed to RKSV Volendam, simply known as Volendam and its official orange colours were established after having been red and black the previous years. Being from the piously catholic village of Volendam, the club soon joined the Roomsch- Katholieke Federatie (RKF) (\\"Catholic Football Association\\") of the Netherlands. In 1935 and 1938, Volendam won that competition until, in 1940 as part of the Second World War, the RKF was forced by the German occupation to merge into the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB). After the Second World War, Volendam played in the Tweede Klasse for a long time, despite being close to promotion several times. Professionalism was introduced in the Netherlands in 1954 and as a result, Volendam saw many players leave. For example, Alkmaar '54 signed the brothers Klaas, Evert and Thoom Smit from the club. ===Professionalism (1955‚Äì1969)=== Dick Tol in 1967, his final year in Volendam. He is the club's all-time top scorer. A year later, in 1955, Volendam also entered professional football by means of the issue of bonds. Volendam ended its first season in third place and thus qualified for the first season of the second-tier Eerste Divisie; 1956‚Äì57. In the 1958‚Äì58 KNVB Cup, Volendam reached the final by beating MVV 1‚Äì3 in the semi-final. Sparta, however, proved too strong there, and Volendam finished runners-up. The following season, Volendam became champions in the Eerste Divisie A and thus promoted to the top-tier Eredivisie for the first time in club history. However, the euphoria was short-lived, and after one season at the highest level, the club suffered relegation again. Soon, the club had established its reputation as the Heen-en-weer club (\\"the back-and-forth club\\") due to its numerous promotions and relegations between the first and second tiers of Dutch football. Head coach Bram Appel piloted Volendam back to the Eredivisie within one season, honouring the club's new nickname. This time, however, the stay at the highest level was longer than one season. Striker Dick Tol, who would become the club's all-time top goalscorer, became the top goalscorer of the 1961‚Äì62 Eredivisie with 27 goals. After three seasons in the Eredivisie, the club once again suffered relegation in the 1963‚Äì64 season. The third promotion for Volendam took place in 1967 under the English manager Ron Dellow. That season also marked Dick Tol's final season before retiring, as he became top goalscorer of the Eerste Divisie. ===1970s and 1980s=== History was written in FC Volendam history in December 1971. The Portuguese Walter Ferreira signed a one-and-a-half-year contract with the club, making him their first foreign player. Despite this, Volendam suffered relegated to the Eerste Divisie in that season. The following season, 1972‚Äì73, in which Ferreira became club top scorer with 11 goals, Volendam narrowly missed out on promotion to the highest level. In the deciding match against De Graafschap, a draw was enough, but the club lost 1‚Äì0. Volendam then played in the Eerste Divisie for the first time for more than three consecutive seasons. Only in 1976‚Äì77 promotion was again achieved after play-offs. The club then split into a professional club, FC Volendam, and an amateur club RKAV Volendam in July 1977, marking the birth of the club known as Volendam today. After seventh and seventeenth places, respectively, in 1977‚Äì78 and 1978‚Äì79, the club relegated again. In 1982, Fritz Korbach was appointed as head coach. He was Volendam's first German manager and had previously successfully led FC Wageningen and PEC Zwolle to the Eredivisie. This turned out to be a perfect move, as he also led Volendam to the highest level in the 1982‚Äì83 season. As their former stay in the Eredivisie, they last two seasons before suffering another relegation. Under the guidance of new head coach Jan Brouwer, Volendam again became champions of the Eerste Divisie in the 1986‚Äì87 season and thus promoted back to the Eredivisie. In the autumn, an ambitious plan ensured Volendam salvation from financial ruin, which had threatened the club's existence for some years. Throughout the years, Volendam spawned many talented players, such as Wim Jonk, Edwin Zoetebier, Arnold and Gerrie M√ºhren. The club also has an accomplished scouting and youth system, which spreads across many different countries. ===Golden years (1987‚Äì1997)=== In the 1989‚Äì90 Eredivisie season, Volendam achieved its best result ever by sixth in the table with 39 points. Three seasons later, the feat was repeated and sixth place was achieved once again. In 1995, FC Volendam reached the final of the KNVB Cup for the second time. This time, the opponent was Feyenoord at their home ground, De Kuip on 25 May. Volendam lost the match 2‚Äì1 after conceding goals by Gaston Taument and Michael Obiku. Andr√© Wasiman scored the sole goal for FC Volendam. Among the 7,000 travelling away fans from Volendam in De Kuip at that time were also Kees Kwakman and Jack Tuijp, who would later both make more than 100 appearances for FC Volendam themselves. For the first time in many years, Volendam managed stay in the Eredivisie for a longer period. From 1987 to 1998. the club played continuously at the highest level. ===Ups and downs in the second tier (2009‚Äìpresent)=== Winning the 2007‚Äì08 Eerste Divisie. In 2009, FC Volendam suffered its latest relegation from the Eredivisie. In the 2007‚Äì08 season, Volendam had won the Eerste Divisie championship under the leadership of former professional footballer Stanley Menzo, who had secured the club's participation in the highest division in the following season. Menzo, however, did not extend his contract, which meant that Frans Adelaar took over as new head coach for the 2008‚Äì09 season. On 10 May 2009, the last matchday of the season, Volendam suffered relegated to the Eerste Divisie once again, after De Graafschap drew (2‚Äì2) and Roda JC's beat Feyenoord (2‚Äì3). The following season was dramatic for Volendam: they finished in 16th place in the second tier. In the 2010‚Äì11 season, Volendam was led by head coach Gert Kruys, who had come over from FC Dordrecht. Volendam finished in 6th place in his first season. In the following season, Volendam did not win a period title for the first time in a long time, which cost Kruys his job at the club. Between 2012 and 2015 and again between 2018 and 2019, the club was led by Hans de Koning, who had come over from Helmond Sport the first time. In the 2012‚Äì13 season, Volendam finished in 2nd place after losing its last game to Go Ahead Eagles. They were then defeated again by Go Ahead Eagles in the final of the playoffs for promotion. In that season, Volendam also managed to win a period title. Due to missing out on promotion, Volendam, for the first time since the start of the Eerste Divisie (1956), competed for more than five seasons in a row at the second level. In the 2014‚Äì15 season, Volendam again lost in the final of the promotion play-offs by losing 0‚Äì1 to De Graafschap at home, after the first leg had finished 0‚Äì0 in Doetinchem. ==Honours== * Eerste Divisie **Winners: 1958‚Äì59, 1960‚Äì61, 1966‚Äì67, 1969‚Äì70, 1986‚Äì87, 2007‚Äì08 **Promoted: 1976‚Äì77, 1982‚Äì83, 2002‚Äì03 *KNVB Cup **Runners-up: 1957‚Äì58, 1994‚Äì95 ===Results=== ImageSize = width:800 height:60 PlotArea = left:10 right:10 bottom:30 top:10 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1990 till:01/01/2019 ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:1 start:1990 Colors = id:bl1 value:rgb(0.9,0.9,0.3) id:bl2 value:rgb(0.5,0.8,0.5) id:rs value:rgb(0.8,0.6,0.6) id:rn value:rgb(0.9,0.1,0.1) PlotData= bar:Position width:15 color:white align:center from:01/01/1990 till:01/01/1991 shift:(0,-4) text:9 from:01/01/1991 till:01/01/1992 shift:(0,-4) text:13 from:01/01/1992 till:01/01/1993 shift:(0,-4) text:6 from:01/01/1993 till:01/01/1994 shift:(0,-4) text:11 from:01/01/1994 till:01/01/1995 shift:(0,-4) text:11 from:01/01/1995 till:01/01/1996 shift:(0,-4) text:16 from:01/01/1996 till:01/01/1997 shift:(0,-4) text:14 from:01/01/1997 till:01/01/1998 shift:(0,-4) text:18 from:01/01/1998 till:01/01/1999 shift:(0,-4) text:8 from:01/01/1999 till:01/01/2000 shift:(0,-4) text:17 from:01/01/2000 till:01/01/2001 shift:(0,-4) text:5 from:01/01/2001 till:01/01/2002 shift:(0,-4) text:6 from:01/01/2002 till:01/01/2003 shift:(0,-4) text:6 from:01/01/2003 till:01/01/2004 shift:(0,-4) text:17 from:01/01/2004 till:01/01/2005 shift:(0,-4) text:5 from:01/01/2005 till:01/01/2006 shift:(0,-4) text:3 from:01/01/2006 till:01/01/2007 shift:(0,-4) text:4 from:01/01/2007 till:01/01/2008 shift:(0,-4) text:1 from:01/01/2008 till:01/01/2009 shift:(0,-4) text:18 from:01/01/2009 till:01/01/2010 shift:(0,-4) text:16 from:01/01/2010 till:01/01/2011 shift:(0,-4) text:6 from:01/01/2011 till:01/01/2012 shift:(0,-4) text:12 from:01/01/2012 till:01/01/2013 shift:(0,-4) text:2 from:01/01/2013 till:01/01/2014 shift:(0,-4) text:9 from:01/01/2014 till:01/01/2015 shift:(0,-4) text:5 from:01/01/2015 till:01/01/2016 shift:(0,-4) text:6 from:01/01/2016 till:01/01/2017 shift:(0,-4) text:6 from:01/01/2017 till:01/01/2018 shift:(0,-4) text:14 from:01/01/2018 till:01/01/2019 shift:(0,-4) text:16 from:01/01/1990 till:01/01/1998 color:bl2 shift:(0,13) text: \\"Eredivisie\\" from:01/01/1998 till:01/01/2003 color:bl1 shift:(0,13) text: \\"Eerste Divisie\\" from:01/01/2003 till:01/01/2004 color:bl2 shift:(0,13) text: \\"Eredivisie\\" from:01/01/2004 till:01/01/2008 color:bl1 shift:(0,13) text: \\"Eerste Divisie\\" from:01/01/2008 till:01/01/2009 color:bl2 shift:(0,13) text: \\"Eredivisie\\" from:01/01/2009 till:01/01/2019 color:bl1 shift:(0,13) text: \\"Eerste Divisie\\" ==Domestic Results== Below is a table with Volendam's domestic results since the introduction of the Eredivisie in 1956. { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"width: 100%; text-align: center;\\" ! colspan=5  Domestic Results since 1956 -

Thanks to a gift by Dorothy Codman, it has been owned by Historic New England since 1969 and is open to the public June 1-October 15 on the second and fourth Saturdays of the month. An admission fee is charged. The main house was originally Georgian in style and was built in approximately 1735 by Chambers Russell I, Esq., the de facto founder of Lincoln, Massachusetts.. It was enlarged in the 1790s to its current three-story Federal style by John Codman, brother-in-law of Chambers Russell III and executor of his estate. This was perhaps with some involvement of noted American architect Charles Bulfinch. The interior is extensively furnished with portraits, memorabilia, and art works collected in Europe. Various rooms preserve the decorative schemes of every era, including those of noted interior designer Ogden Codman, Jr. The former carriage house, built c. 1870 to a design by Snell and Gregerson, is also located on the property. Until the 1980s, it was original to its use as a stable and an early auto garage and contained many artifacts of both. A few of those artifacts continue to be on display in the carriage house including an early gas pump and a large machine powered lathe. The grounds have been farmed almost continuously since 1735 and now also include an Italian garden, circa 1899, with perennial beds, statuary, and a reflecting pool filled with waterlilies, as well as an English cottage garden, circa 1930. The Codman Estate was added to the National Register of Historic Places as \\"The Grange\\" in 1974. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Middlesex County, Massachusetts ==References== ==External links== * Codman Estate information at Historic New England's web site * Codman Estate rental information Category:Houses completed in 1741 Category:Historic house museums in Massachusetts Category:Federal architecture in Massachusetts Category:Museums in Middlesex County, Massachusetts Category:Houses in Lincoln, Massachusetts Category:National Register of Historic Places in Middlesex County, Massachusetts Category:Historic New England Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Middlesex County, Massachusetts ","title":"Codman House"},{"id":"2202214","text":"Glyn Idris Jones (27 April 1931 ‚Äì 2 April 2014) was a South African actor, writer and director. == Early years == Glyn Idris Jones, actor, director, writer, and teacher, born in Durban, South Africa on 27 April 1931, of Italian and Welsh parentage, died at his home Vamos, Crete, Greece on 2 April 2014. In a career spanning almost sixty years, his theatrical career encompassed work in the UK, on the continent, and in the United States. After university and drama school he toured South Africa as an actor with the National Theatre of South Africa before hitch-hiking and working his passage to London. On arriving in England in 1953 he took a job with The Sunday Times, then Kemsley Newspapers, and starting writing plays in his spare time. His first acting engagement in the UK was in a summer season of weekly rep at the old Tivoli Theatre, New Brighton, extra work on television and a second summer season, this time on the Isle of Wight followed. Out of work periods saw him working in pubs, at Joe Lyons‚Äô Cadby Hall, for a small-time publisher and cleaning people‚Äôs houses. == Acting == As an actor in London he appeared in \\"Reunion In Vienna\\" at The Piccadilly, \\"The Gorky Brigade\\" Royal Court, \\"The Great Society\\", \\"Something Burning\\", \\"Treasure Island\\", all at the Mermaid, \\"Streamers\\" at The Roundhouse, \\"A Coat Of Varnish\\" and \\"Captain Brassbound‚Äôs Conversion\\" at The Haymarket, \\"Measure For Measure\\" at The Open Space, \\"Tsafendas\\" at The Almost Free. He has also played leading roles in many provincial theatres, on tours and on the continent. His television appearances have been numerous and he has also worked in film and on radio, his credits being too lengthy to mention. His last UK television appearance was for the BBC when he gave a chilling performance as the pedophile murderer, Sidney Cooke in \\"The Lost Boys\\". Whilst working as actor he continued to write and had sixteen plays produced, the first in England being \\"Oh Brother\\" in Ipswich. Others include, in London, \\"Early One Morning\\" at the Arts Theatre, \\"Champagne Charlie\\", based on the life of the great Music Hall star, George Leybourne, at the Mayfair Theatre, also on tour and in 2013 its final performance at Wilton‚Äôs Music Hall. Also \\"Women Around\\" at Worthing, \\"Tell me you Love me\\" (a.k.a. How do you like your Wagner?) at Perth. His play \\"The 88\\" was produced in 1979 at the Old Vic, taking as its subject the mutiny of an Irish Regiment in India in 1920. As is the way of things, the play had been written some ten years before in came to being produced, and been in pre- production for some considerable time, however, a few weeks before the opening night, Lord Mountbatten was murdered by the IRA. At the press conference to launch the play, two critics were heard discussing this fact and one declared, ‚ÄòHow dare they put on this play so soon after dear Lord Louis‚Äôs murder. I am going to tear it to pieces.‚Äô Which he and several others did. Devastated by such viciousness, that was unrelated to the qualities of his play, and in spite of an audience reaction that was the exact opposite to blinkered, biased, critics, Glyn Jones did not write another word for ten years. Felix Barker writing about The 88 in the Evening News said, ‚ÄòThere are occasions, rare and important, when the theatre clasps hands with actuality. This happened last night‚Ä¶‚Äô In 2013 he made a final witty appearance before the cameras, playing an obstreperous Film Producer in an advertisement selling the diverse beauty of Crete as a filming location: Filming In Crete from Indigo View. ==Doctor Who== Late in 1964, Jones was contacted by David Whitaker, the story editor on Doctor Who, with a view to the writer contributing a serial. Whitaker though, had been succeeded by Dennis Spooner by the time the scripts of The Space Museum were prepared for production. Jones was dismayed by the editing of his scripts. Spooner had cut much of the humorous content, feeling that such material was inappropriate in what he saw as a high-concept science- fiction story. This was Jones' only contribution to Doctor Who as a writer. However, he would go on to play Krans in 1975's The Sontaran Experiment. This was a rare example of a Doctor Who writer also acting on the programme. == Directing == He directed at a number of theatres in the UK, at RADA and, in America at James Madison University in Virginia where he also acted in a number of productions, Dodge in \\"Buried Child\\", Argon in \\"The Imaginary Invalid\\" and Eddie Carbone in \\"A View From the Bridge\\", and for a summer season at The Wayside Theatre, Virginia he directed two plays, \\"Tribute\\" and \\"The Innocents\\" and acted in three, \\"Barefoot in the Park\\", \\"Private Lives\\" and \\"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\\". He performed in Neil Simon‚Äôs \\"Fools\\" and \\"The Fantasticks\\" in dinner theatre and was invited by Furman University to play Dysart in \\"Equus\\" and work with students on Shakespeare. ==Writing== He wrote the screenplay for the Oscar Nominated Columbia Film, A King's Story on the life of the Duke of Windsor Edward VIII. He was chief writer and script editor for 20th Century Fox‚Äôs most successful children‚Äôs series, \\"Here Come the Double Deckers\\". He also wrote films for the Children's Film Foundation, two of which were award winners. Jones contributed a half dozen scripts for the Children's Film Foundation series The Magnificent Six and 1/2 (1968‚Äì69), plus nine scripts for Here Come the Double Deckers (1970‚Äì71), on which he was also script editor, a TV series derived from the CFF films. Jones wrote an episode of The Gold Robbers (1969) around the same time. In the UK he had written book and lyrics for two musicals with composer Kenny Clayton, \\"Cupid\\" and \\"Black Maria\\" and his witty two hander play, \\"Early One Morning\\" became the musical \\"Fugue in Two Flats\\" with music by Paul Knight. His popular musical version of \\"Peter Pan\\" has music by Andy Davidson. After moving to Crete he added to his canon of book and lyrics for musicals when he wrote a musical based on the life of the infamous Spanish courtesan of La Belle √âpoque, \\"La Belle Otero\\", music by Christopher Littlewood, two opera libretti for which, at the time of his death, he was looking for a composer, and two new plays, a comedy set in Athens, \\"Marry Go Round\\", and \\"The Muses Darling\\", a play on the last few days of the life of Christopher Marlowe. In 1997 he moved to Vamos, Crete, Greece which meant forgoing any acting or directing but he kept writing, starting with his autobiography No Official Umbrella, two novels, Angel and The Journeys We Make, a Gothic horror The Museum Mysteries & Other Short Stories, and 5 books in his comedy / thriller series featuring a quirky private eye, Thornton King, and his sidekick, Miss Holly Day. \\"Dead On Time\\", \\"Just In Case\\", \\"Dead On Target\\", \\"The Cinelli Vases\\" and \\"Celluloid and Tinsel\\". When Glyn died the last in the Thornton King series was with the editors and is to be published posthumously. All the foregoing novels are published by DCG Media Group. Also published, \\"Doctor Who and the Space Museum\\", (W.H.Allen / Virgin), also released as an audio book (BBC), \\"The Double Deckers\\" (Pan), a volume of children‚Äôs poetry \\"Hildegarde H And Her Friends\\" (Abydos Publishing). In America his plays \\"Red in the Morning\\", \\"Generations\\", \\"Third Drawer from the Top\\", have had productions. His play \\"Thriller of the Year\\" first produced at the Golders Green Hippodrome in 1967 still receives numerous productions in Germany. The week before he died he was working with Beate Staufenbiel on the translation into German of two more of his plays, \\"Rosemary\\" and \\"Hear the Hyena Laugh\\" which received its posthumous premiere in January 2016. Three plays have been published by Samuel French and seven by DCG Media Group. ==Autobiography== His autobiography, \\"No Official Umbrella\\", has been described as, ‚Äò‚Ä¶vastly entertaining from its description of his South African boyhood to his early vigorous and experimental life in the rural theatres of England and on to the big London stage. It is full of young people with now familiar names = on the way up, all made human, not just name dropping. Anecdotes and good stories by the bundle‚Ä¶.

Others, however, describe the effects of a totalitarian regime which, after having seized power in one country, annexes the rest of the world in order to dominate and oppress all mankind. One major influence was Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward. The best-known advocate of world government was H. G. Wells. He describes such a system in The Shape of Things to Come, Men Like Gods and The World Set Free. Some writers have also parodied the idea: E. M. Forster's The Machine Stops (1909) and Aldous Huxley's 1932 novel Brave New World. Wells himself wrote The Sleeper Awakes, an early vision of a dystopian world. World government themes in science fiction are particularly prominent in the years following World War II, coincident with the involvement of many scientists in the actual political movement for world government in response to the perceived dangers of nuclear holocaust. Prominent examples from the Cold War era include Childhood's End (1953), Starship Troopers (1959), Star Trek (from 1966), the Doctor Who story The Enemy of the World (1968) and Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons (1968) Later references to a unified world government also appear however in post- Cold War science fiction television series such as Babylon 5. The concept also appears frequently in science fiction anime, whether in the form of a strengthened United Nations or an entirely new organizations with world presidential election. Examples of anime with this premise are Macross (adapted in America as the first part of Robotech) and Gundam. ==President of Earth== President of Earth (also known as President of the World) is a fictional concept or character who is the leader of Planet Earth. Examples include the following: * In DC Comics, superhero Bart Allen had a presidential grandfather President Thawne; Jacques Foccart, the second Invisible Kid, went on to serve as President of Earth. * A poem \\"The President of Earth\\" by Author David Kennedy (b1959) in a book with the same title, * A fictional character in a fictional universe in The Adventures of Captain Proton holoprogram on USS Voyager's holodeck * Gerry Anderson's 1960s supermarionation puppet shows, via their TV Century 21 comic and episodes of Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, featured a World President as head of a unified World Government. * In the 1968 film Barbarella, Barbarella is sent out by the President of Earth. * In The New Twilight Zone episode \\"Lost and Found\\" and the Phyllis Eisenstein 1978 short story of the same title upon which it was based, a woman named Jenny Templeton (Akosua Busia) will someday be elected the first president of Earth, presumably in the 21st century and will eventually be called \\"The Great Peacemaker\\". * In Babylon 5: In the Beginning, the president of Earth orders all available ships to form a line around the planet in a vain attempt to stave off the final Minbari obliteration of the human race. This, the Battle of the Line, is the final battle of the war. * In Futurama (which is set in the 31st century), the position of President of Earth is held by Richard Nixon's Head, preceded by \\"Earth President McNeal\\". * In Doctor Who, several future timelines ‚Äì most notably the 26th century's Earth Empire ‚Äì have a President of Earth. In the first such story, Frontier in Space, the President's world government is specifically based on the United States government. The Doctor is assigned President of Earth by the United Nations, with full control over the planet's armies, in the episode \\"Death in Heaven\\" ‚Äì a role he resumes in \\"The Zygon Invasion\\" / \\"The Zygon Inversion\\" and later \\"The Pyramid at the End of the World\\". * In Space Battleship Yamato 2202, Earth is governed by the Earth Federation under the rule of a President, who is seen in Episode 2. *In fiction the 2019 novel. The First President of Earth, Bill Buchanan becomes the first president of earth. *In the season finale of the second season of The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants, George and Harold write a comic where Earth is ruled by a President. However, they learn from the superintendent that Erica Wang (one of their classmates) beating a recent obstacle course will help her become President of Earth in the future. The superintendent is actually Erica from the future. *In the 2015 video game Citizens of Earth, players play as the newly elected Vice President of Earth. ==World governmental organizations in fiction and popular cultureDemocracy=== * Indian science fiction show of the 90s Captain Vyom showed a world government with the capital at New Delhi. * Global Defense Initiative (a powerful military branch of the UN) in the Command & Conquer series of video games. * The Confederation in Peter F Hamilton's Night's Dawn Trilogy (or more specifically GovCentral and most planetary governments, some even stretch across multiple systems). * The Unified Earth Government (the root of the United Nations Space Command) in the Halo series is an interplanetary government. * The United Earth Federation in the video game Supreme Commander is a Martial Government that rules all of Earth and several other planets in the galaxy. * The United States of Earth is the fictional world government in the animated science-fiction comedy series Futurama. It is also supported by D.O.O.P. (an interplanetary equivalent to the United Nations). * United Earth is the governing body of Earth in the Star Trek franchise. It was formed after Earth made first contact with Vulcans and was later a political subdivision of the United Federation of Planets. * The Earth Alliance in Babylon 5 was founded in 2085 as a democracy, and conquered most nations who refused to join by 2150. * The Earth Federation in the Gundam anime series, formed as a response to widespread famine, disease and war.

There was also the World Aquanaut Security Patrol (The W.A.S.P'S), the World Space Patrol (W.S.P), World Intelligence Network (W.I.N) and Universal Secret Service (U.S.S). All run by a World Government (overseen by a world President) located in the world capital Futura City. * In his scurrilous novel New Shoes, RD Le Coeur has the president of earth as Bernado Bohemoth Beelzebub who the alien visitors come seeking on Earth. . * In Orson Scott Card's \\"Shadow of the Giant\\", Peter Wiggin becomes Hegemon over the Earth. * \\"Mobile Suit Gundam Wing\\" is set in a world run by the Alliance. * In Martian Successor Nadesico, Earth and several lunar and Martian colonies are governed by United Earth, with a united military force called the \\"United Earth Allied Forces\\". * In Planetes, a Japanese anime, \\"INTO\\" International Treaty Organization is a type of world government. * In the manga Eden: It's an Endless World! A supranational organization \\"Propater\\" which grew within NATO and the UN, and eventually took them over. Propater controls much of the world, including Japan, the US, much of Europe and South America. Later this organization became \\" United World The Federation of Earth\\". * In Appleseed (manga), after World War III the planet is supervised by a utopian city called Olympus. The Central Management Bureau, more commonly referred to as Aegis in the manga, is the political organization that runs the city-state of Olympus. Aegis is looking after the whole planet, other than total disarmament and the supervision of trade and economy, every country is pretty much free to do as they please. * In video game Deus Ex: Invisible War takes place in 2072, twenty years after the original, in a world being rebuilt after the destruction of global infrastructure at the hands of the first game's protagonist, JC Denton. The World Trade Organization somehow forms a global government, creating modern city-states, known as enclaves, in which the majority of the game takes place. * In Aldnoah.Zero, Earth is united under one government, with a united military force known as the United Forces of Earth (UFE). * In Space: Above and Beyond, Earth and its colonies are under the rule of the Secretary-General of the United Nations * In Neon Genesis Evangelion, the United Nations commands a military made up of the former Earth countries' militaries. * In the Expanse universe, the UN governs Earth and its immediate colonies (most notably Luna). * Killzone (series) ‚Äì The UCN (United Colonial Nations) in the Killzone series essentially act as the United Nations.

They call it NSS (New Solar System). * Pacific Rim (film) ‚Äì The United Nations were called upon to rally together following the 2013 and 2014 Kaiju attacks in San Francisco, Manila, Cabo and Sydney. When Jasper Schoenfeld presented the idea for the \\"Jaeger\\" in Seoul, South Korea's World Conference, September 15, 2014, the UN chose to set aside old rivalries for \\"the greater good\\" and collaborate to make the Jaeger Program possible. The \\"Pan Pacific Defense Corps\\" was established in late 2014. The United Nations served as the PPDC's primary benefactors and were involved in the approval of Jaeger manufacturing connected to the PPDC's higher ups. * Independence Day: Resurgence ‚Äì Since the attack in the first film, it appears that the UN has become the governing body and defense force of mankind. * Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare ‚Äì The United Nations Space Alliance (UNSA) is an international political organization that handles matters related to trade, travel, land claims and all efforts relating to human space colonization.

The unified human state is the direct successor of the intergovernmental organization founded in 1945, after World War II, which gradually evolved its mandate, stripping national governments of their prominence on the world (and later interstellar) stage to the point where it held sovereignty over all of humanity. * The Wandering Earth - In the future, the Sun has aged and is about to turn into a red giant, pushing the nations of the world to consolidate into the United Earth Government, a world government, to initiate a project to move the Earth out of the Solar System to the Alpha Centauri system, in order to preserve further human civilization. ===Authoritarian=== * The Imperium in Warhammer 40000 is a large sprawling empire spanning many planets. * World Government in the Japanese manga and anime series One Piece. * The Alliance in the Firefly universe is a result of a Chinese and American alliance. ===Multiple types=== * The novels and short stories of science fiction author Isaac Asimov frequently depict the existence of some variety of world government. The first such mention appears to be his short story 'Evidence', published in 1946; the story mentions that governments have formed four regions. In the next story, 'The Evitable Conflict', they have formed a Federation, created in 2044 CE, with an elected World Coordinator. His headquarters are in New York City. Regional capitals also exist.

The project began as a website in October 2001 that featured six stories from the Book of Genesis, and is completely unaffiliated with the Lego company. There is also a Brick Testament book series.Brick Testament on Amazon.com Throughout stories are retold using passages from the Bible, with chapter and verse cited, the wording being a free adaptation that Spurling says is based on a number of public domain Bible translations.Spurling has stated the rationale for updated wording of TBT is to avoid copyright issues. Occasionally, mostly when images are being used to contrast with the underlying scripture, Spurling dramatises the images with additional text. Such text is displayed in gray instead of the usual black. ==Authorial commentary== Spurling's own commentary occasionally appears in illustrations and is displayed in gray text, and also as original titles for the stories themselves. A Rolling Stone article that is included as a link in the Brick Testament web site suggests that Spurling is an atheist.Excerpt from Rolling Stone Magazine article about the Brick Testament, In 2015 Spurling announced on Facebook that she was an atheist, a transgender woman, and a lesbian, and had legally changed her name to Elbe Spurling but would likely retain her birth name, Brendan Powell Smith, for her books.

The pieces come from hundreds of Lego sets dating from the 1960s to the present. In the few instances where alterations are made to Lego elements, they are generally simple changes made with a hobby knife or permanent ink marker. An example alteration is God's hair: Spurling made God's white hair by carving a white helmet piece (found on Peeron).

The virus only affects chickens. CAV is a non-enveloped icosahedral single stranded DNA virus, which causes bone marrow atrophy, anemia, and severe immunosuppression. Clinical signs of CAV infection are predominantly found in young chicks due to vertical transmission from the breeder hens whose maternal antibodies have not yet formed following exposure. Clinical disease is rare today because of the widespread practice of vaccinating breeders, but the subclinical form of the disease‚Äîwhich normally affects birds more than two weeks of age following horizontal transmission of the virus via the fecal-oral route‚Äîis ubiquitous. The virus is very resistant in the environment, making elimination very difficult. The disease and virus have many names including chicken anemia, blue wing disease, anemia dermatitis syndrome, chicken/avian infectious anemia, hemorrhagic aplastic anemia syndrome, infectious chicken anemia, chicken infectious anemia virus, and chicken anemia agent. When this virus was first discovered in 1979, it was named chicken anemia agent. ==Clinical signs== Clinical signs only occur in chicks less than three weeks of age. During outbreaks of CAV, up to 10% of chicks can die. Signs include a pale comb, wattle, eyelids, legs and carcass, anorexia, weakness, stunting, unthriftiness, weight loss, cyanosis, petechiation and ecchymoses, lethargy, and sudden death. Neurological signs include dullness, depression and paresis. In older chickens, an infection with no apparent symptoms may cause reduced growth rates due to a poor feed conversion ratio. ==Pathogenesis== CAV infects precursor T cells in the thymus and hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, causing destruction of these cells via apoptosis. This reduces the production of red blood cells (RBC) and white blood cells (WBC), leading to severe immunosuppression and anemia. ==Diagnosis== A presumptive diagnosis can be made based on the clinical signs and a low hematocrit reading, e.g. below 27%. Virus isolation, increased antibody titres, immunoperoxidase staining, ELISA, PCR or indirect immunofluorescence can be used to confirm the presence of the virus. Post mortem findings show significant atrophy of the lymphoid organs, hemorrhage throughout the tissues, and pale watery bone marrow. ==Treatment and control== There is no specific treatment for infected birds. Culling of infected birds is normally performed in infected commercial flocks. Birds that have been infected develop immunity to the virus. Vertical spread of the disease can be controlled by the vaccination of breeding hens with both live attenuated and wild vaccines. These vaccines reduce the vertical transmission rate. The vaccine has the ATCvet code . Appropriate hygiene and biosecurity measures may be employed to control the disease. == External links == * https://web.archive.org/web/20131125042946/http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/poultry/chicken_anemia_virus_infection/overview_of_chicken_anemia_virus_infection.html ==References== 2\\\\.

The table was purportedly made to serve as a means of communicating with the spirits; the alphabet would be slowly spoken aloud and the table would tilt at the appropriate letter, thus spelling out words and sentences. The process is similar to that of a Ouija board. Scientists and skeptics consider table-turning to be the result of the ideomotor effect, or conscious trickery.Rawcliffe, D. H. (1987). Occult and Supernatural Phenomena. Dover Publications. p. 137Zusne, Leonard; Jones, Warren H. (1989). Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. p. 110. Robert Todd Carroll. (2003). The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions. John Wiley & Sons. p. 172. ==History== When the movement of Modern Spiritualism first reached Europe from America in the winter of 1852-1853, the most popular method of consulting the spirits was for several persons to sit round a table, with their hands resting on it, and wait for the table to move. If the experiment was successful the table would rotate with considerable rapidity, and would occasionally rise in the air, or perform other movements. Whilst most spiritualists ascribed the table movements to the agency of spirits, two investigators, Count de Gasparin and Professor Thury of Geneva conducted a careful series of experiments by which they claimed to have demonstrated that the movements of the table were due to a physical force emanating from the bodies of the sitters, for which they proposed the name ectenic force. Their conclusion rested on the supposed elimination of all known physical causes for the movements; but it is doubtful from the description of the experiments whether the precautions taken were sufficient to exclude unconscious muscular action (the ideomotor effect) or even deliberate fraud.Podmore, Frank. (1897). Studies in Psychical Research. New York: Putnam. p. 47 \\"If neither the feet nor the hands of the sitters could be employed, the knees could apparently have been used without much risk, and Thury clearly could not watch both the upper and under surfaces simultaneously. One the whole, though the experiments were conducted with care and a laudable desire not to exaggerate the importance of the facts observed, the experimenters do not appear to have sufficiently realised the possibilities of fraud; and their results add little evidence for action of a psychic, or, as Thury has preferred to name it, ectenic force.\\" In England table-turning became a fashionable diversion and was practised all over the country in the year 1853. John Elliotson and his followers attributed the phenomena to mesmerism. The general public were content to find the explanation of the movements in spirits, animal magnetism, Odic force, galvanism, electricity, or even the rotation of the earth. Some Evangelical clergymen alleged that the spirits who caused the movements were of a diabolic nature. In France, Allan Kardec studied the phenomenon and concluded in The Book on Mediums that some messages were caused by an outside intelligence as the message contained information that was not known to the group. ==Scientific reception== 257x257px The Scottish surgeon James Braid, the English physiologist W. B. Carpenter and others pointed out, that the phenomena could depend upon the expectation of the sitters, and could be stopped altogether by appropriate suggestion.Yeates, L.B., James Braid: Surgeon, Gentleman Scientist, and Hypnotist, Ph.D. Dissertation, School of History and Philosophy of Science, Faculty of Arts & Social Sciences, University of New South Wales, January 2013. Faraday's apparatus for experimental demonstration of ideomotor effect on table-turning256x256px English physicist Michael Faraday devised some simple apparatus which conclusively demonstrated that the movements he investigated were due to unconscious muscular action.Lamont, Peter. (2013). Extraordinary Beliefs: A Historical Approach to a Psychological Problem. Cambridge University Press. p. 129. The apparatus consisted of two small boards, with glass rollers between them, the whole fastened together by india-rubber bands in such a manner that the upper board could slide under lateral pressure to a limited extent over the lower one. The occurrence of such lateral movement was at once indicated by means of an upright haystalk fastened to the apparatus. When by this means it was made clear to the experimenters that it was the fingers which moved the table, the phenomena generally ceased. Faraday's work was followed up a century later by clinical psychologist Kenneth Batcheldor who pioneered the use of infra-red video recording to observe experimental subjects in complete darkness. After this experimental approach, Faraday criticizes the believers on table-turning. ===Trickery=== 255x255px Professional magicians and skeptics have exposed many of the methods utilized by mediums to tip tables. The magician Chung Ling Soo described a method that involved a pin driven into the table and the use of a ring with a slot on the medium's finger. Once the pin entered the slot, the table could be lifted.Soo, Chung Ling. (1898). Spirit Slate Writing and Kindred Phenomena. Munn & Company. p. 71-72 According to John Mulholland: > The multiplicity of methods used to tip and raise tables in a s√©ance is > almost as great as the number of mediums performing the feat. One of the > simplest was to slide the hands back until one or both of the medium's > thumbs could catch hold of the table top. Another way was to exert no > pressure on the table at all, and in the event that the sitter opposite the > medium did press on the table, to permit the table to tip far enough away > from him so that he could get the toe of one foot under the table leg. He > would then immediately put pressure on his side, and, holding the table > between his hands and his toe, move it about at will. By this method a small > table can be made to float two feet off the floor... Another method was to > catch the under side of the table top with the knee; and still another was > merely to kick the table into the air.Mulholland, John. (1938). Beware > Familiar Spirits. C.

She is the mother of Colorado Governor Jared Polis. ==Early life and education== Schutz was born in Peekskill, New York, and is the daughter of June (n√©e Keller) and David Polis. Her grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Russia. Schutz earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Rider University in 1966, where she studied English and biology. == Career == After earning her undergraduate degree, Schultz worked as a teacher and social worker in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan. She also took graduate courses in psychology and worked as a freelance writer for local publications. Schutz and Blue Mountain Arts came to wider attention with the founding, in 1996, of the bluemountain.com website. One of the earliest experiments with the electronic greeting card medium, the site was widely adopted by web users. In 1999, the dot-com venture Excite@Home bought bluemountain.com in a deal valued at $780 million. The 1999 price paid for bluemountain.com became an example of what was later seen as the excesses of the dot-com bubble: the website was sold again in 2001, to greeting card company American Greetings, for just $35 million in cash. Schutz is the executive producer and director of the documentary film Anyone and Everyone. The film featured the coming-out stories of gay sons and daughters and their parents and premiered on KPBS public television in San Diego, California in August 2007, before being scheduled to air on a number of other public television stations in the United States. == Personal life == She has two grandchildren through her son Jared and son-in- law Marlon Reis. == References Blue Mountain Arts Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:American Reform Jews Category:American businesspeople Category:American women poets Category:American people of Russian-Jewish descent Category:People from Peekskill, New York Category:Writers from New York (state) Category:20th- century American poets Category:20th-century American women writers Category:21st-century American women writers Category:21st-century American poets Category:Rider University alumni ","title":"Susan Polis Schutz"},{"id":"2202301","text":"Thermal decomposition, or thermolysis, is a chemical decomposition caused by heat. The decomposition temperature of a substance is the temperature at which the substance chemically decomposes. The reaction is usually endothermic as heat is required to break chemical bonds in the compound undergoing decomposition. If decomposition is sufficiently exothermic, a positive feedback loop is created producing thermal runaway and possibly an explosion or other chemical reactions. ==Examples== *Calcium carbonate (limestone or chalk) decomposes into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide when heated. The chemical reaction is as follows: ::CaCO3 ‚Üí CaO + CO2 :The reaction is used to make quick lime, which is an industrially important product. :Other example of thermal Decomposition is :- 2Pb(NO3)2 \\\\----> 2PbO + O2 +4NO2 *Some oxides, especially of weakly electropositive metals decompose when heated to high enough temperature. A classical example is the decomposition of mercuric oxide to give oxygen and mercury metal. The reaction was used by Joseph Priestley to prepare samples of gaseous oxygen for the first time. *When water is heated to well over 2000 ¬∞C, a small percentage of it will decompose into OH, monatomic oxygen, monatomic hydrogen, O2, and H2. *The compound with the highest known decomposition temperature is carbon monoxide at ‚âà3870 ¬∞C (‚âà7000 ¬∞F). ===Decomposition of nitrates, nitrites and ammonium compounds=== * Ammonium dichromate on heating yields nitrogen, water and chromium(III) oxide. * Ammonium nitrate on strong heating yields dinitrogen oxide (\\"laughing gas\\") and water. * Ammonium nitrite on heating yields nitrogen gas and water. * Barium azide on heating yields barium metal and nitrogen gas. * Sodium azide on heating at 300 ¬∞C gives nitrogen and sodium. * Sodium nitrate on heating yields sodium nitrite and oxygen gas. * Organic compounds like tertiary amines on heating undergo Hofmann elimination and yield secondary amines and alkenes. ==Ease of decomposition== When metals are near the bottom of the reactivity series, their compounds generally decompose easily at high temperatures. This is because stronger bonds form between atoms towards the top of the reactivity series, and strong bonds break less easily. For example, copper is near the bottom of the reactivity series, and copper sulfate (CuSO4), begins to decompose at about 200 ¬∞C, increasing rapidly at higher temperatures to about 560 ¬∞C. In contrast potassium is near the top of the reactivity series, and potassium sulfate (K2SO4) does not decompose at its melting point of about 1069 ¬∞C, nor even at its boiling point. ==See also== *Ellingham diagram *Thermochemical cycle *Thermal depolymerization *Chemical thermodynamics *Pyrolysis - thermolysis of organic material *Gas generator ==References== Category:Chemical reactions Category:Thermodynamics ","title":"Thermal decomposition"},{"id":"2202304","text":"Histomonas meleagridis is species of parasitic protozoan that infects a wide range of birds including chickens, turkeys, peafowl, quail and pheasants, causing infectious enterohepatitis, or histomoniasis (blackhead dieases). H. meleagridis can infect many birds, but it is most deadly in turkeys. It inhabits the lumen of cecum and parenchyma of liver, where it causes extensive necrosis. It is transmitted by another cecal parasite, the nematode Heterakis gallinarum. ==Description== H. meleagridis is a microscopic, pleomorphic protozoan, and can exist in two forms, amoeboid and flagellated. Within the tissue, it is present as an amoeboid protozoan, while in the lumen or free in the contents of cecum, it lives as an elongated flagellated form. The amoeboid form is typically 8-15 Œºm in diameter, whereas the flagellated form can reach up to 30 Œºm in diameter.Griffiths HJ (1978). A Handbook of Veterinary Parasitology: Domestic Animals of North America. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, pp. 23-25. Histomonads do not possess mitochondria, but instead produce energy inside hydrogenosomes. The flagellum shows the common 9x2+2 type. ==Lifecycle== H. meleagridis reproduces by binary fission. The free trophozoites are very delicate and can survive only for a few hours in the external environment. However, when they are transmitted between flocks in the eggs of Heterakis gallinarum, a cecal nematode, which in turn can be transmitted by earthworms that ingested the nematode eggs, they gain entry into the nematode eggs. The eggs with the trophozoites are passed out into the environment through the feces. In this way, the trophozoites can remain viable up to two years in the external environment. Within turkey flocks H. meleagridis is also known to be directly transmitted from bird to bird. Histomonads, either released from the heterakid nematode larvae in the ceca or after direct infection via the cloaca, and replicate rapidly in the cecal tissues. They migrate to the submucosa and muscularis mucosae and cause severe necrosis. The parasites then move to the liver through the vascular system. There, they cause typical crater-like necrotic lesions. Mortality in turkey flocks can be very high (80-100%). ==Pathogenicity== H. meleagridis is the causal organism of histomoniasis of gallinaceous birds. It induces extensive and severe necrosis of the tissues of the mucosa and submucosa of cecum and parenchyma of the liver. The lesions are sometimes exacerbated by other pathogens such as Escherichia coli and coccidia. The symptoms appear within seven to 12 days after infection, and include depression, reduced appetite, poor growth, increased thirst, sulphur-yellow diarrhoea, listlessness, drooping wings, and unkempt feathers. The symptoms are highly fatal to turkeys, but effect less damage in chickens. However, outbreaks in chickens may result in high morbidity, moderate mortality, and extensive culling, leading to overall poor flock performance. Concurrence of Salmonella typhmurium and E. coli was found to cause high mortality in broiler chickens. Young birds, particularly those three to 12 weeks old, are most susceptible. Generally, the symptoms are profound in turkeys, while chickens are usually asymptomatic. ==Diagnosis and control== Diagnosis can be easily performed by necropsy of the fresh or preserved carcass, particularly on the liver. Recently paromomycin has been approved by the Italian authorities for treatment (Paromomicina 200mg/g Huvepharma). However good management of the farm and sanitation are the essential effective strategies to control the spread of infection.Ballweber LR (2001). Veterinary parasitology: The Practical Veterinarian.

It features the first appearance in Gibson's fiction of \\"the Bridge\\", which Gibson revisited as the setting of his acclaimed Bridge trilogy of novels. In the story, the Bridge is overrun by squatters, among them Skinner, who occupies a shack atop a bridgetower. An altered version of the story was published in Omni magazine and subsequently anthologized. \\"Skinner's Room\\" was nominated for the 1992 Locus Award for Best Short Story. ==Synopsis== The story takes place in a near-future where the United States is in decline, having been negatively affected by some event referred to as the \\"devaluations.\\" It is set in a decaying San Francisco in which the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge is closed and taken over by the homeless. The wealthy denizens of the city have retreated to gated-access enclaves. The room mentioned in the title is a shack built on top one of the bridge's towers. Skinner has lived on the bridge, and in his room, for a long time, and is accompanied by a girl with an interest in the history of the bridge town and who arrived only three months before. The story reveals that, long ago, the Bridge had been closed to vehicle traffic (for three years) and that the pressure to find somewhere to live had forced homeless people to seize the bridge and set up a squatters' town there. The community that arose was vibrant and was watched by the world's media. The town grew in a piecemeal fashion, built from salvaged parts as well as from material apparently donated by more wealthy nations. At the end of the story Skinner has a dream in which he remembers being at the front of the crowd who seized the bridge (Skinner is the first onto the bridge) and scaled the towers. ==Publication history== Untitled by Ming + Hodgetts, a depiction of the Bridge inspired by \\"Skinner's Room\\" and contributed to the Visionary San Francisco Exhibition. Ming + Hodgetts depiction of the Bridge inspired Gibson's Bridge trilogy. \\"Skinner's Room\\" was commissioned by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art for its exhibition \\"Visionary San Francisco\\", shown from June 14 to August 26, 1990. Gibson's story inspired a contribution to the exhibition by architects Ming Fung and Craig Hodgetts. Ming and Hodgetts designed the urban environment which would have catalysed the transformation of the Bridge. They envisioned a San Francisco in which the rich live in high-tech, self-sufficient, self-contained towers, above the decrepit city and its crumbling bridge, isolated from the amorphous city. The crate-packaged installation, which was surrounded by scrap metal, computer chips, and pages from manga comic strips, featured a model of the towers, along with Gibson on a monitor discussing the future and reading from \\"Skinner's Room\\". A slightly different version of the short story was featured in the November 1991 issue of Omni. The OMNI version concerns an unnamed girl and an old man named Skinner who live in the one-room shack built on top of the first cable tower of the Bridge. This version was collected in Gardner Dozois' 1992 anthology The Year's Best Science Fiction: Ninth Annual Collection, and in Larry McCaffery's After Yesterday's Crash (1995). ==Significance== A cable tower of the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge, is the fictional location of Skinner's room. \\"Skinner's Room\\" is the first appearance of \\"the Bridge\\" in Gibson's fiction, prior to its use as the setting of his Bridge trilogy. \\"Skinner's Room\\" is the first appearance of the Bridge in Gibson's fiction. In the acknowledgments at the end of his 1994 novel Virtual Light, Gibson writes that the short story later developed into the novel; the character of Skinner is one of the main characters in Virtual Light and the setting and characters of \\"Skinner's Room\\" are revisited in the sequels to the novel, Idoru and All Tomorrow's Parties (collectively known as the Bridge trilogy). The New York Times hailed the \\"Visionary San Francisco\\" exhibition as \\"one of the most ambitious, and admirable, efforts to address the realm of architecture and cities that any museum in the country has mounted in the last decade\\". Despite organiser Paulo Polledri's claim that the collaboration was an \\"appeal to civic responsibility by showing the effects of its absence\\", The New York Times judged Ming and Hodgetts's reaction to \\"Skinner's Room\\" a \\"powerful, but sad and not a little cynical, work\\". After its 1991 republication in OMNI, \\"Skinner's Room\\" was nominated for the Locus Award for Best Short Story in 1992. ==See also== *Kowloon Walled City, a former squatters' town in Hong Kong and subject of Gibson's fascination. ==References== ==External links== * Bridge trilogy Category:1990 short stories Category:Cyberpunk short stories Category:San Francisco in fiction Category:Science fiction short stories Category:Short stories by William Gibson Category:Speculative fiction short stories Category:Works originally published in Omni (magazine) ","title":"Skinner's Room"},{"id":"2202344","text":"In the European Economic Area (European Union member countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), a supplementary protection certificate (SPC) is a sui generis intellectual property (IP) right that extends the duration of certain rights associated with a patent. It enters into force after expiry of a patent upon which it is based. This type of right is available for various regulated, biologically active agents, namely human or veterinary medicaments and plant protection products (e.g. insecticides, and herbicides). Supplementary protection certificates were introduced to encourage innovation by compensating for the long time needed to obtain regulatory approval of these products (i.e. authorisation to put these products on the market).\\"... Whereas at the moment the period that elapses between the filing of an application for a patent for a new medicinal product and authorization to place the medicinal product on the market makes the period of effective protection under the patent insufficient to cover the investment put into the research ...\\" in Council Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92 of 18 June 1992 concerning the creation of a supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products A supplementary protection certificate comes into force only after the corresponding general patent expires. It normally has a maximum lifetime of 5 years. The duration of the SPC can, however, be extended to 5.5 years when the SPC relates to a human medicinal product for which data from clinical trials conducted in accordance with an agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) have been submitted (as set out in Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 on medicinal products for paediatric use). The total combined duration of market exclusivity of a general patent and SPC cannot normally exceed 15 years. However, the reward of a 6-month SPC extension for the submission of data from an agreed PIP can extend this combined duration to 15.5 years. SPCs extend the monopoly period for a \\"product\\" (active ingredient or a combination of active ingredients) that is protected by a patent. For many SPC applications, there is no controversy about the definition of the \\"product\\" or whether it is protected by the patent upon which the SPC application was based. However, there are other SPC applications (particularly for medicinal products containing multiple active ingredients) where there may not be clear answers to questions such as what is a permissible definition of a \\"product\\", and what test should be applied for determining whether a patent protects that \\"product\\". Supplementary protection certificates in the European Union are based primarily upon two regulations. Although all countries in the EU are required to provide supplementary protection certificates, no unified cross-recognition exist. Applications must be filed and approved on a country-by-country basis. == Scope == According to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92, the scope of an SPC extends \\"only to the product covered by the authorization to place the corresponding medicinal product on the market and for any use of the product as a medicinal product that has been authorized before the expiry of the certificate\\". The European Court of Justice has decided, however, that the scope of an SPC is sometimes capable of encompassing more than just the single form of the active ingredient that is included in the medicinal product authorised for sale. Thus, in case C-392/97,Farmitalia Carlo Erba Srl's SPC Application (Case C-392/97) the European Court of Justice held that: \\"where an active ingredient in the form of a salt is referred to in the marketing authorisation concerned and is protected by a basic patent in force, the certificate is capable of covering the active ingredient as such and also its various derived forms such as salts and esters, as medicinal products, in so far as they are covered by the protection of the basic patent\\". == Legal basis == Supplementary protection certificates in the European Union were based primarily upon two regulations: * Council Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92 of 18 June 1992 concerning the creation of a supplementary protection certificate for medicinal productsCouncil Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92 of 18 June 1992 concerning the creation of a supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products which entered into force on 2 January 1993. This has been cancelled by the below specified recodified regulation No 469/2009 with effect from May 2009 * Regulation (EC) No 1610/96 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 1996 concerning the creation of a supplementary protection certificate for plant protection productsRegulation (EC) No 1610/96 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 1996 concerning the creation of a supplementary protection certificate for plant protection products which entered into force on 8 February 1997 The above Regulations have now been codified under the following regulation: * Regulation (EC) No 469/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 concerning the supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products (Codified version)Regulation (EC) No 469/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 concerning the supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products (Codified version) Supplementary protection certificates may come into life at the expiry of a national or European patent. However, the European Patent Convention (EPC) needed to be modified to allow such \\"extension\\" of the term of European patent. Article 63 of the EPC was modified on 17 December 1991 to specify to, although European patents have a term of 20 years as from the date of filing of the application (Art. 63(1)), :\\" nothing (...) shall limit the right of a Contracting State to extend the term of a European patent, or to grant corresponding protection which follows immediately on expiry of the term of the patent, under the same conditions as those applying to national patents: (...) :(b) if the subject-matter of the European patent is a product or a process of manufacturing a product or a use of a product which has to undergo an administrative authorisation procedure required by law before it can be put on the market in that State. \\" This constituted the first revision of the European Patent Convention since its signature in 1973. The paediatric extension is based primarily upon: * Regulation 1901/2006 of 12 December 2006 on medicinal products for paediatric use and amending Regulation 1768/92, Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on medicinal products for paediatric use and amending Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92, Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 * Regulation 1902/2006 of 20 December 2006 amending Regulation 1901/2006 on medicinal products for paediatric useRegulation (EC) No 1902/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 amending Regulation 1901/2006 on medicinal products for paediatric use == Determination of term == The term of an SPC depends on the date of issuance of the first marketing authorization (MA) within the EEA and can be determined by the equation: :Term = date of 1st MA in the EEA ‚àí date of filing of corresponding patent ‚àí 5 years Under normal circumstances, this means the following. * No SPC term is available if less than 5 years have elapsed between the date of filing of the corresponding patent and the date of issuance of the first MA in the EEA. * If the first MA is issued more than five years but less than ten years after the filing date of the corresponding patent, an SPC is granted for a term corresponding to the period elapsed between the five-year point and the MA issuance date. * If the first MA is issued more than ten years after the filing date of the corresponding patent, an SPC is granted for a five-year term. There have been very few cases where there was any controversy over the precise date of the 1st MA in the EEA. The H√§ssle AB case (ECJ case C-127/00Case C-127/00) was one of that small number. In that case, the ECJ ruled that the decisive date for SPC purposes is the date of an authorisation from a regulatory body tasked with assessing safety and efficacy, and not the date of a subsequent authorisation that may be required under national pricing or reimbursement provisions. So-called \\"centralised\\" (European Medicines Agency / European Commission) MAs were introduced by Regulation 2309/93Regulation 2309/93 and became available in January 1995 (i.e. some 2 years after the introduction of the original SPC legislation for medicinal products). The introduction of these authorisations added a new layer of complexity to the issue of determination of the date of a MA. This is because there are two dates associated with \\"centralised\\" authorisations, namely: (1) the date of the European Commission's decision to issue an authorisation; and (2) the date of notification of that decision to the MA applicant. Date (2) is usually a few days (e.g. 2 to 4 days) later than date (1). Although the standard practice of many national patent offices seems to be to calculate SPC term based upon date (1), an October 2011 article in Scrip Regulatory Affairs by Mike SnodinMike Snodin October 2011 article argues that this standard practice is incorrect and that date (2) should be used instead (with the result that some products may be entitled to a slightly longer SPC term than previously thought). Paramount amongst the reasons for preferring date (2) to date (1) is that a \\"centralised\\" authorisation does not become effective until it is notified to the MA applicant. The UK Intellectual Property Office has now accepted Snodin's arguments on this point and has changed its standard practice regarding the calculation of SPC term.UK IPO Practice Notice It remains to be seen whether any other national offices will follow suit. However, inspection of Belgian SPC certificates for products authorised via the \\"centralised\\" procedure reveals that at least the patent office in Belgium already appears to base calculations of SPC term upon date (2). Thus, there are divergent practices across different territories within Europe with regard to the selection of a date for a \\"centralised\\" MA, with Belgium and the UK IPO being in the minority. If the issue were ever to be debated in a national court, this fact that there are divergent practices across different territories could provide basis for such a court to seek an authoratitive ruling from the ECJ in relation to which of dates (1) and (2) should be used for SPCs. This is because, as European Commission legislation, the Regulations governing SPCs should be interpreted consistently across all member states of the EU. An MA in Switzerland was also considered as being a first MA for the calculation of the SPC duration, even though Switzerland is not part of the European Economic Area (EEA). This is because such a MA was automatically effective in Liechtenstein, which is a member of the EEA (since 1 May 1995). This was decided by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in joined cases Novartis et al. v. Comptroller-General and Minist√®re de l'Economie v. Millennium Pharmaceuticals.Case C-207/03Case C-252/03 The same point was also confirmed in case C-617/12 (AstraZeneca AB v Comptroller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks),Case C-617/12 in a case where the data that persuaded Swissmedic to grant the (earlier) Swiss MA was held by the European Medicines Agency to not be complete or persuasive enough to justify the grant of a MA under EU legislation (Directive 2001/83/EC). However, as answer to the decision of the ECJ the contract between Switzerland and Liechtenstein was amended. Since 1 July 2005 the automatic effect of a Swiss MA in Liechtenstein is abolished. The recognition is now delayed by a time period, which is normally 12 months. === Paediatric extension === Article 36 of Regulation 1901/2006 provides for a 6-month extension to SPC term. The extension is available only under certain conditions, the most notable being the requirement for the submission of a new MA application containing data from all trials conducted in accordance with an agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP). Consequences of the 6-month SPC extension include: * the maximum term of an SPC can now be up to 5.5 years; and * the maximum duration of market exclusivity (patent + SPC) can now be up to at least 15.5 years. An extension of an SPC can only be awarded if there is an SPC to extend. As an unextended SPC only has a positive term if more than 5 years have elapsed between patent filing and MA issuance, this leads to the following two questions. (1) Is an SPC available if less than 5 years and 1 day have elapsed between filing of the corresponding patent and issuance of the first MA in the EEA? (2) If the answer to (1) is yes, what term should be awarded to the (unextended) SPC? A July 2007 paper by Snodin and Miles,Snodin and Miles RAJ Pharma 18(7), 459 (2007) put forward three possible answers to this combination of two questions. If the answer to question (1) is no, then it is not relevant to consider question (2). This corresponds to \\"Model B\\" of the 2007 Snodin and Miles paper, and produces a curious situation where longer marketing exclusivity can be obtained if the issuance of the first MA in the EEA is delayed (to at least 5 years and 1-day from filing of the corresponding patent). If the answer to question (1) is yes, then question (2) becomes relevant. This question can be answered in two ways, corresponding to either \\"Model A\\" or \\"Model C\\" of the 2007 Snodin and Miles paper. Model A assumes that SPC term can validly be either zero or negative if 5 years or less have elapsed from filing of the corresponding patent to issuance of the first MA in the EEA. In this event, a positive (and non-zero) SPC term is obtained (after extension) if the time from patent filing to MA issuance is more than 4.5 years. Model C assumes that all term calculations that provide a negative answer are 'rounded up' to zero. This has the consequence of providing a minimum of 6 months of SPC term, irrespective of how little time has elapsed from patent filing to MA issuance. Subsequent to the publication of the Snodin and Miles article, Merck & Co. filed SPC applications for the product sitagliptin. For example, from mid-August to mid-September 2007, Merck & Co. filed SPC applications in various countries, including the UK,Register Extract for UK SPC for sitagliptin phosphate monohydrate Ireland, Register Extract for IE SPC for sitagliptin the Netherlands Register Extract for NL SPC for sitagliptin and Italy. Register Extract for IT SPC for sitagliptin These SPC applications provided an early opportunity for Models A to C to be tested in practice. Curiously, the patent offices of various EU member states did not reach any consensus on which model is correct. For example, the NetherlandsRegister Extract for NL SPC for sitagliptin, showing an SPC expiry date earlier than the expiry date of the basic patent and the UKUKIPO decision granting negative term SPC favoured Model A, Germany,Translation of referral from BGH to the CJEU in Merck's appeal against refusal of sitagliptin SPC application in Germany Portugal and Slovenia favoured Model B and GreeceCommentary on SPC applications for sitagliptin favoured Model C. In connection with an appeal against refusal of the SPC application in Germany, and in view of the different stances taken by different national patent offices, the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) sought clarification of the law from the Court of Justice of the EU (in case C-125/10). The decision of the Court of Justice, delivered on 8 December 2011,C-125/10 ‚Äì Merck Sharp & Dohme, Judgment of the Court (Second Chamber) of 8 December 2011 essentially agreed with Model A of the 2007 Snodin and Miles paper. Thus, useful (extended) supplementary protection can now be obtained so long as at least 4 years, 6 months and one day has elapsed from the date of patent filing to the date of the first MA for the product in the EEA. == Case law == ECJ cases C-195/09 and C-427/09 effectively ruled that SPCs for medicaments (human or veterinary) are only available for those \\"products\\" that: (a) are protected by a patent; (b) have been subject to an administrative authorisation procedure; and (c) have not been placed on the market anywhere in the EEA as a medicinal product prior to being subject to safety and efficacy testing and a regulatory review. Until recently, decisions C-195/09 and C-427/09 could have been interpreted as ruling out the possibility of SPC protection for all \\"products\\" previously included in medicinal products that were marketed prior to the date(s) of the Marketing Authorisation(s) (MA(s)) specified in the SPC application. This is because the ECJ's rulings in C-195/09 and C-427/09 were based in part upon a desire to ensure that national patent offices are not required to assess whether an earlier MA was compliant with the standards for testing of safety and efficacy that were introduced in the 1970s (meaning that all prior MAs, whether or not compliant with those standards, should be treated equally under the SPC legislation). However, the decision in Neurim Pharmaceuticals (C-130/11) has cast doubt upon this interpretation. In C-130/11, the ECJ held that an SPC can be granted regardless of the prior marketing of earlier (veterinary) medicinal products containing the \\"product\\" in question. Thus, cases C-195/09 and C-427/09 (which, in common with C-130/11, related to SPC applications based upon newly patented uses for old \\"products\\") could perhaps now be viewed as being of relevance only to those \\"products\\" that were marketed before being subject to a regulatory review. However, this might necessitate patent offices making a determination of whether prior MAs are compliant with current standards (i.e. whether the \\"product\\" had been subject to safety and efficacy testing prior to being granted an MA). As this is precisely the kind of determination that the ECJ had previously been keen for patent offices to avoid, further references to the ECJ may be necessary to clarify precisely which \\"products\\" fall within the scope of the SPC legislation and which do not. With respect to (a) above, the question of how to determine whether a \\"product\\" is protected by a patent is the subject of ongoing controversy. Cases such as C-322/10 and C-422/10 have indicated that the \\"product\\" needs to be \\"specified [or identified] in the wording of the claims\\". However, the precise meaning of this test is yet to be clarified. Further, although the SPC legislation mentions only Directives 2001/83/EC and 2001/82/EC as the \\"administrative authorisation procedure\\" for human or veterinary medicaments, SPCs are known to have been granted when MAs have not been obtained via those procedures (but instead via procedures that involve a similar level of safety and efficacy testing). == Statistics == According to research, more than 8,000 SPCs for medicinal and plant protection products have been filed in Europe between 1991 and 2003.EurActiv, EU ruling makes extension of pharma patents harder, 5 May 2006 (updated: 28 May 2012) == See also == * Generic pharmaceutical price decay * Orphan drug * European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) == References == == External links == * Supplementary Protection Certificates for Medicinal Products and Plant Protection Products ‚Äì A Guide for Applicants (PDF file 120Kb), by the UK Patent Office * The SPC Blog, blog relating to supplementary protection certificates (SPCs) ===Search=== * Supplementary Protection Certificate Search at the UK Intellectual Property Office Category:Intellectual property law Category:Patent law of the European Union ","title":"Supplementary protection certificate"},{"id":"2202351","text":"Anthony Steven (3 August 1916 - 26 May 1990) was a British television scriptwriter whose career spanned over three decades.

She also is one of the few Latinas to become a successful artist in the English-language dance music genre. == Biography == Born in the New York City borough of Queens, her parents who were originally from Cuba encouraged her to pursue her artistic inclinations.'Selena Forever' performers prepare for opening night Veronica began her career in 1995 when she was 21 years old with the release of the lead single \\"Without Love\\" released on August 29, 1995 two months prior to the debut album V...As in Veronica which was released on October 24, 1995. The album was a mixture of R&B; and Hip hop. The album featured production from Rodney Jerkins and Dallas Austin. On October 28, 1997, she released her second album Rise. She released two singles/videos off of this album. The first single was \\"No One But You\\" and it featured Craig Mack. The second single and album title track Rise was released and that featured guest vocals by Big Pun & Cuban Link. As one of the first artists to sign to Jellybean Recordings, a label founded by music producer Jellybean Benitez, Veronica had a string of hits on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, including three which reached the top ten. \\"Let Me Go... Release Me\\" landed the number one spot in 1998, and soon afterwards it was followed by the club anthem \\"Someone to Hold\\" (which peaked at the number two slot) which was remixed by producer Johnny Vicious and played heavily in the club circuit scene. The song still remains a classic among clubgoers today and it was featured on the soundtrack to the independent film Trick released in 1999 and starred Christian Campbell and Tori Spelling. She scored a second number one dance hit in 2000 with her cover of Evelyn \\"Champagne\\" King's classic R&B; song \\"I'm in Love\\", which was rerecorded for a club setting. She remains a very popular singer to this very day among gay audiences and especially in the club circuit scene. She moved away from New York and the club music scene for a few years. During these years, she pursued her love for musical theater and was given the opportunity to portray slain Tejano singer Selena in a traveling production about her life and times. The production, titled Selena Forever traveled to numerous cities with a large Mexican-American population for over a year. Shortly after the successful run of the production, she decided to return to New York and start a family and return to her love of music. In 2004, Veronica recorded a song with rapper Triple Seis titled \\"Krazy\\". The song was featured on Triple Seis' debut album Time'll Tell. After a brief hiatus, Veronica returned in 2006, with music producer Tim Rex on her first dance single in over five years, \\"Relentless...Just a Game\\". She can be seen in the 2007 film The Singer where she plays H√©ctor Lavoe's mother in his younger years. == Personal life == She presently resides in New York City with her husband, Christopher Jackson, who starred in Hamilton, and their son, C.J.

Her parents were Herbert Clegg and Ethel Moores, sister of Sir John Moores who founded the Littlewoods Empire and they ran an artificial flower making factory in Manchester. She spent her early years in Gatley. After obtaining an English degree at Oxford University, Clegg decided to pursue a career in the theatre. Initial work as an understudy led to more substantial roles, most notably her turn as Cleopatra opposite Cyril Luckham's Caesar at the Liverpool Playhouse. A high-profile tour of Australia with Katharine Hepburn followed, performing plays such as The Merchant of Venice, but by this point Clegg was looking to move into television, a medium where more money could be made with roles in Emergency ‚Äì Ward 10 and The Dream Maker. She then started writing scripts and in 1961 contributed seven scripts for the television soap opera Coronation Street. After writing for several radio and television serials, including for Crossroads and a radio dramatisation of The Chrysalids, Clegg was asked to submit ideas for the science fiction television series Doctor Who in 1981. Her storyline, titled The Enlighteners, involved a space-bound race using anachronistic sailing ships. Doctor Who script editor Eric Saward decided to use Clegg's story as the last part of a trilogy of three stories, known informally as the Black Guardian Trilogy, as it involved the return of the Black Guardian. To integrate The Enlighteners into the trilogy, portions of the story were rewritten at the request of the production team and the Black and White Guardians replaced the originally planned \\"Enlighteners\\". Since the title could no longer refer to those entities, the story was renamed Enlightenment. She was the first woman to write a serial for Doctor Who. The serial was Barbara Clegg's only commission for Doctor Who, other story line ideas being rejected by Saward, and later Andrew Cartmel. However one of those ideas, \\"Point of Entry\\", was later written up as a full script by Marc Platt and released as part of Big Finish's series of Doctor Who: The Lost Stories. Another \\"The Elite\\", was released in 2011. She wrote a book about the life of her Uncle Sir John Moores, called The Man Who Made Littlewoods, which was published five weeks before his death in 1993. ==References== ==External links== *Biography of Barbara Clegg (archived 2005) * Category:1926 births Category:Living people Category:Actresses from Manchester Category:British actresses Category:British television writers Category:British soap opera writers Category:20th-century British women writers Category:Women soap opera writers ","title":"Barbara Clegg"},{"id":"2202381","text":"Artist's depiction of the life cycle of a Sun-like star, starting as a main- sequence star at lower left then expanding through the subgiant and giant phases, until its outer envelope is expelled to form a planetary nebula at upper right. The faint young Sun paradox or faint young Sun problem describes the apparent contradiction between observations of liquid water early in Earth's history and the astrophysical expectation that the Sun's output would be only 70 percent as intense during that epoch as it is during the modern epoch. The issue was raised by astronomers Carl Sagan and George Mullen in 1972. Proposed resolutions of this paradox have taken into account greenhouse effects, changes to planetary albedo, astrophysical influences, or combinations of these suggestions. An unresolved question is how a climate suitable for life was maintained on Earth over the long timescale despite the variable solar output and wide range of terrestrial conditions.David Morrison, NASA Lunar Science Institute, \\"Catastrophic Impacts in Earth's History\\", video-recorded lecture, Stanford University (Astrobiology), 2010 Feb. 2, access 2016-05-10. == Solar evolution == Early in Earth's history, the Sun's output would have been only 70 percent as intense as it is during the modern epoch, owing to a higher ratio of hydrogen to helium in its core. Since then the Sun has gradually brightened and consequently warmed the Earth's surface, a process known as radiative forcing. During the Archaean age, assuming constant albedo and other surface features such as greenhouse gases, Earth's equilibrium temperature would have been too low to sustain a liquid ocean. Astronomers Carl Sagan and George Mullen pointed out in 1972 that this is contrary to the geological and paleontological evidence. The sun is powered by nuclear fusion, which for the Sun can be represented in the following way: :4^{1}H -> ^{4}He + 2e+ + 2 u :4^{1}H + e- -> ^{4}He + e+ + 2 u In the equations above e+ is a positron, e‚àí is an electron and ŒΩ represents a neutrino (nearly massless). The net effect is three-fold: a release of energy by Einstein's formula ŒîE = mc2 (since the helium nucleus is less massive than the hydrogen nuclei), an increase in the density of the solar core (since the final product is contained in one nucleus as opposed to between four different protons), and an increase in the rate of fusion (since higher temperatures help increase the collision speed between the four protons and boost the likelihood that such reactions take place). The net effect is an associated increase in solar luminosity. More recent modeling studies have shown that the Sun is currently 1.4 times brighter today than it was 4.6 billion years ago (Ga), and that it has brightened roughly linearly since then with time, though it has accelerated slightly. Despite the reduced solar luminosity ago and with greenhouse gas, the geological record shows a continually relatively warm surface in the full early temperature record of Earth, with the exception of a cold phase, the Huronian glaciation, about 2.4 to 2.1 billion years ago. Water-related sediments have been found dating to as early as 3.8 billion years ago. This relationship between surface temperature and the balance of forcing mechanisms has implications for how scientists understand the evolution of early life forms, which have been dated from as early as 3.5 billion years. == Greenhouse gas solutions  Ammonia as a greenhouse gas === Sagan and Mullen even suggested during their descriptions of the paradox that it might be solved by high concentrations of ammonia gas, NH3. However, it has since been shown that while ammonia is an effective greenhouse gas, it is easily photochemically destroyed in the atmosphere and converted to nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) gases. It was suggested (again by Sagan) that a photochemical haze could have prevented this destruction of ammonia and allowed it to continue acting as a greenhouse gas during this time, however this idea was later tested using a photochemical model and discounted. Furthermore, such a haze is thought to have cooled the Earth's surface beneath it and counteracted the greenhouse effect. === Carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas === This conceptual graph shows the relationship between solar radiation and the greenhouse effect ‚Äì in this case dominated by modulations in carbon dioxide. It is now thought that carbon dioxide was present in higher concentrations during this period of lower solar radiation. It was first proposed and tested as part of Earth's atmospheric evolution in the late 70s. An atmosphere that contained about 1000 times the Present Atmospheric Level (or PAL) was found to be consistent with the evolutionary path of the Earth's carbon cycle and solar evolution. The primary mechanism for attaining such high CO2 concentrations is the carbon cycle. On large timescales, the inorganic branch of the carbon cycle, which is known as the carbonate-silicate cycle is responsible for determining the partitioning of CO2 between the atmosphere and the surface of the Earth. In particular, during a time of low surface temperatures, rainfall and weathering rates would be reduced, allowing for the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere on timescales of 0.5 million years (Myr). Specifically, using 1-D models, which represent the Earth as a single point (instead of something that varies across 3 dimensions) scientists have determined that at 4.5 Ga, with a 30% dimmer Sun, a minimum partial pressure of 0.1 bar of CO2 is required to maintain an above-freezing surface temperature. At a maximum, 10 bar of CO2 has been suggested as a plausible upper limit. The exact amount of carbon dioxide levels is still under debate, however. In 2001, Sleep and Zahnle suggested that increased weathering on the seafloor on a young, tectonically active Earth could have reduced carbon dioxide levels. Then in 2010, Rosing et al analyzed marine sediments called banded iron formations (BIFs), and found large amounts of various iron-rich minerals, including magnetite (Fe3O4), an oxidized mineral alongside siderite (FeCO3), and reduced mineral and saw that they formed during the first half of Earth's history (and not afterward). The minerals' relative coexistence suggested an analogous balance between CO2 and H2. In the analysis, Rosing et al connected the atmospheric H2 concentrations with regulation by biotic methanogenesis. Anaerobic, single-celled organisms that produced methane (CH4) may therefore have contributed to the warming in addition to carbon dioxide. == Other proposed explanations == Phanerozoic Climate Change A minority view, propounded by the Israeli-American physicist Nir Shaviv, uses climatological influences of solar wind, combined with a hypothesis of Danish physicist Henrik Svensmark for a cooling effect of cosmic rays, to explain the paradox. According to Shaviv, the early Sun had emitted a stronger solar wind that produced a protective effect against cosmic rays. In that early age, a moderate greenhouse effect comparable to today's would have been sufficient to explain an ice-free Earth. Evidence for a more active early Sun has been found in meteorites. The temperature minimum around 2.4 billion years goes along with a cosmic ray flux modulation by a variable star formation rate in the Milky Way. The reduced solar impact later results in a stronger impact of cosmic ray flux (CRF), which is hypothesized to lead to a relationship with climatological variations. ===Mass loss from Sun=== It has been proposed several times that mass loss from the faint young Sun in the form of stronger solar winds could have compensated for the low temperatures from greenhouse gas forcing. In this framework, the early Sun underwent an extended period of higher solar wind output. This caused a mass loss from the Sun on the order of 5‚àí10 percent over its lifetime, resulting in a more consistent level of solar luminosity (as the early Sun had more mass, resulting in more energy output than was predicted). In order to explain the warm conditions in the Archean era, this mass loss must have occurred over an interval of about one billion years. Records of ion implantation from meteorites and lunar samples show that the elevated rate of solar wind flux only lasted for a period of 0.1 billion years. Observations of the young Sun- like star œÄ1 Ursae Majoris matches this rate of decline in the stellar wind output, suggesting that a higher mass loss rate can not by itself resolve the paradox. ===Changes in clouds=== If greenhouse gas concentrations did not compensate completely for the fainter sun, the moderate temperature range may be explained by a lower surface albedo. At the time, a smaller area of exposed continental land would have resulted in fewer cloud condensation nuclei both in the form of wind-blown dust and biogenic sources. A lower albedo allows a higher fraction of solar radiation to penetrate to the surface. Goldblatt and Zahnle (2011) investigated whether a change in cloud fraction could have been sufficiently warming and found that the net effect was equally likely to have been negative as positive. At most the effect could have raised surface temperatures to just above freezing on average. Another proposed mechanism of cloud cover reduction relates a decrease in cosmic rays during this time to reduced cloud fraction. However, this mechanism does not work for several reasons including the fact that ions do not limit cloud formation as much as CCN, and cosmic rays have been found to have little impact on global mean temperature. Clouds continue to be the dominant source of uncertainty in 3-D global climate models, and a consensus has yet to be reached on exactly how changes in cloud spatial patterns and cloud type may have affected Earth's climate during this time. ==Gaia hypothesis== The Gaia hypothesis holds that biological processes work to maintain a stable surface climate on Earth to maintain habitability through various negative feedback mechanisms. While organic processes, such as the organic carbon cycle, work to regulate dramatic climate changes, and that the surface of Earth has presumably remained habitable, this hypothesis has been criticized as intractable. Furthermore, life has existed on the surface of the Earth through dramatic changes in climate, including Snowball Earth episodes. There are also strong and weak versions of the Gaia hypothesis, which has caused some tension in this research area. ==On other planetsMars=== Mars has its own version of the faint young Sun paradox. Martian terrains show clear signs of past liquid water on the surface, including outflow channels, gullies, modified craters, and valley networks. These geomorphic features suggest Mars had an ocean on its surface and river networks that resemble current Earth's during the late Noachian (4.1‚Äì3.7 Ga). It is unclear how Mars's orbital pattern, which places it even further from the Sun, and the faintness of the young Sun could have produced what is thought to have been a very warm and wet climate on Mars. Scientists debate over which geomorphological features can be attributed to shorelines or other water flow markers and which can be ascribed to other mechanisms. Nevertheless, the geologic evidence, including observations of widespread fluvial erosion in the southern highlands, are generally consistent with an early warm and semi-arid climate. Given the orbital and solar conditions of early Mars, a greenhouse effect would have been necessary to boost surface temperatures at least 65 K in order for these surface features to have been carved by flowing water. A much denser, CO2-dominated atmosphere has been proposed as a way to produce such a temperature increase. This would depend upon the carbon cycle and the rate of volcanism throughout the pre- Noachian and Noachian, which is not well known. Volatile outgassing is thought to have occurred during these periods. One way to ascertain whether Mars possessed a thick CO2-rich atmosphere is to look at carbonate deposits. A primary sink for carbon in the Earth atmosphere is the carbonate-silicate cycle. It is however hard for CO2 to have built up in the Martian atmosphere in this way because the greenhouse effect would have been outstripped by CO2 condensation. A volcanically-outgassed CO2-H2 greenhouse is one of the most potent warming solutions recently suggested for early Mars. Intermittent bursts of methane may have been another possibility. Such greenhouse gas combinations appear necessary because carbon dioxide alone, even at pressures exceeding a few bar, cannot explain the temperatures required for the presence of surface liquid water on early Mars. ===Venus=== Venus's atmosphere is composed of 96% carbon dioxide, and during this time, billions of years ago, when the Sun was 25 to 30% dimmer Venus's surface temperature could have been much cooler, and its climate could have resembled current Earth's, complete with a hydrological cycle ‚Äì before it experienced a runaway greenhouse effect. ==See also== * Cool early Earth * Effective temperature ‚Äì of a planet, dependent on reflectivity of its surface and clouds. * Isua greenstone belt * Paleoclimatology * Snowball Earth * Carbonate‚Äìsilicate cycle * Gaia Hypothesis ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Sun Category:Climate history Category:Paradoxes Category:1972 in science Category:Unsolved problems in astronomy ","title":"Faint young Sun paradox"},{"id":"2202397","text":"The Gropius House is a historic house museum owned by Historic New England located at 68 Baker Bridge Road in Lincoln, Massachusetts, United States.Historic New England: Gropius House It was the family residence of Modernist architect Walter Gropius, his wife Ise Gropius (n√©e Frank), and their daughter Ati Gropius. The house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2000 for its association with Walter Gropius, as he was an influential teacher and leader of Modernist architecture.Ann Grady and Carolyn Pitts (January 13, 2000) , National Park Service and The house includes a collection of Bauhaus-related materials unparalleled outside Germany. ==History== As the first director of the Bauhaus, Gropius was concerned with combining modern technologies with consumer needs, while placing equal emphasis on architectural integrity and decorative arts. Gropius and his family came to the United States after a three-year stay in London, where they had moved to avoid the Nazi regime. Gropius came to Massachusetts to accept a teaching position at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design. Fellow architect and prominent Bostonian Henry Shepley convinced philanthropist Helen Storrow to provide land and fund the design and construction of a home for Gropius. Gropius designed the home in 1937; local builder Casper J. Jenney built it in 1938. Gropius used his new home as a showcase for his Harvard students as well as an example of modernist landscape architecture in America. He chose the area because of its proximity to Concord Academy which his daughter Ati was slated to attend. It remained Gropius's home from 1938 until his death in 1969. Marcel Breuer, a fellow architect and friend of the Gropius family, came to the United States shortly after the Gropiuses, also to become part of the Harvard design faculty. Helen Storrow provided a neighboring plot of land to Breuer where he could showcase his design philosophies. Gropius and Breuer assisted one another in the construction of their homes, completing their dwellings in 1938 and 1939, respectively. The Gropius House continues to have Breuer furniture on display. The house also contains works by Eero Saarinen, Joan Mir√≥, and Herbert Bayer that they gave as gifts to Walter Gropius. ==Architecture and designDesign philosophy=== In 1931 Gropius was asked to write an article describing the ideal livable small home for Architectural Forum. Gropius outlined the most important aspects of the home's design, sounding like a true description of the Lincoln dwelling: \\"The dwelling house should no longer resemble something like a fortress, like a monument of walls with medieval thickness and an expensive front intended for showy representation. Instead it is to be of light construction, full of bright daylight and sunshine, alterable, time-saving, economical and useful in the last degree to its occupants whose life functions it is intended to serve.\\" Gropius went on to describe an ideal layout of such a house, almost literally outlining the Gropius House composition: \\"The ground plan ... is a geometrical projection of its spacial idea ‚Äì the organizing plan for moving within a house. The elevation, facade, is the result of that plan and not the starting point ... Hence, no artificial symmetry, but a free functional arrangement of the succession of rooms, short, time-saving passages of communication, moving space for children, clear separation between the living, the sleeping, and the housekeeping parts of the house, and finally, proper utilization of the ground and especially the sunny aspect. The bedrooms need morning sun (facing east) the living rooms should have southern to western light, and the north side is left to storerooms, kitchens, staircases and bathrooms.\\" ===The house=== Set amid fields, forests, and farmhouses, the Gropius House mixes traditional materials of New England architecture (wood, brick, and fieldstone) with industrial materials such as glass block, acoustic plaster, welded steel, and chrome banisters. The structure consists of a traditional New England post and beam wooden frame sheathed with white-painted tongue-and-groove vertical siding. Traditional clapboards are used in the interior foyer, but are applied vertically to create the illusion of height. The clapboards also performed a practical function as a gallery. Because the works displayed in the Gropius House changed frequently, the wood served as an easy surface to nail into, patch, repaint, and start over again. The home contains a combined living and dining room, a kitchen, office, sewing room, three bedrooms, and four bathrooms. All bathrooms were positioned in the less- prominent northwest corner of the house and used the same plumbing stack for maximum efficiency. One of the most notable differences between the Gropius House and adjacent homes is its flat roof. While in much of Europe and even in certain parts of the United States flat roofs were becoming quite common, in Lincoln and surrounding areas pitched roofs with gables were the norm. Gropius fashioned his flat roof with a slight tilt to the center where water could drain off to a dry well on the property. At the time of the building of the Gropius House, Walter and Ise's adopted daughter Ati was 12 years old. Gropius took care in making sure Ati was happy and comfortable and allowed her a great deal of input in the design of her bedroom. Ati chose the warm color palette and much of her furniture, including a desk Gropius had designed while at the Bauhaus in 1922. Ati's room is the largest of the three bedrooms, with a private entrance including a wrought-iron spiral staircase. Though Gropius could not give her the sand floor and glass ceiling she requested, he did give her the private roof deck so she could sleep under the stars. ===The landscape=== In keeping with Bauhaus philosophy, every aspect of the house and surrounding landscape was planned for maximum efficiency and simplicity. Gropius carefully sited the house to complement its New England habitat on a grassy rise surrounded by stone retaining walls amidst wetlands and a 90-tree apple orchard, the latter which the Gropiuses allowed to grow naturally other than some mowing during the growing season. Gropius wanted the outdoor space around the home to be equally \\"civilized\\" and created a lawn extending twenty feet around the entire house, with a perennial garden expanding to the south by the porch. Although the house sits on a rather flat plot of land, by keeping the woodlands well maintained, the Gropiuses retained broad views to the south, east, and west. The screened porch was placed so as to divide the land around the house into multiple zones, comparable to rooms inside a house. The house was conceived as part of an organic landscape, where Gropius utilized indoor-outdoor spaces to accentuate relationships between the structure and site. Before the home's design was complete, Walter Gropius was hard at work creating the ideal landscape. He selected mature trees from the neighboring forest and helped transplant them to his future his yard. Ise was the predominate landscaper in the family: she and Walter selected Scotch pine, white pine, elm, oak, and American beech trees to complement their surroundings. The Gropiuses also added \\"rescued\\" boulders and wooden trellises adorned with pink climbing roses and Concord grapevines to flatter the New England landscape. Bittersweet vines and trumpet vines also connected the home to nature. Ise spent many hours each week planting, weeding, and trimming. She also filled and maintained more than a dozen bird feeders and bird houses on the property and claimed to have known more than ninety birds personally. After a trip to Japan in the 1950s, Ise removed the perennials and covered the ground in a layer of gray gravel, where she planted azaleas, candytuft, cotoneaster, and one large red-leafed Japanese maple tree. ==Gallery== ==Criticism== Conservative neighbors were not fans of the Gropius House. One neighbor, James Loud, felt the Gropius House clashed with surrounding Colonial Revival style homes. According to Loud, both the Gropius House and the home designed by Marcel Breuer looked like \\"chicken coops.\\" ==Preservation== In 1974‚Äîfive years after Walter's death‚ÄîIse donated the property to the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (now Historic New England), though she lived there for the rest of her life. In 1984, a year after Ise's death, the home became a museum. It is open to the public. == See also == * List of National Historic Landmarks in Massachusetts * National Register of Historic Places listings in Middlesex County, Massachusetts == References == == External links == * Historic New England: Gropius House * Video tour Category:Houses completed in 1938 Category:Historic house museums in Massachusetts Category:Lincoln, Massachusetts Category:Walter Gropius buildings Category:Modernist architecture in Massachusetts Category:National Historic Landmarks in Massachusetts Category:Biographical museums in Massachusetts Category:Architecture museums in the United States Category:Museums in Middlesex County, Massachusetts Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Middlesex County, Massachusetts Category:Historic district contributing properties in Massachusetts Category:Historic New England Gropius ","title":"Gropius House"},{"id":"2202415","text":"Eric Pringle (4 May 1935, Morpeth, Northumberland, England - 13 April 2017, Ledbury, Herefordshire)Writers' Guild of Great Britain) was a British writer for radio and television. He also wrote three novels for children. He was one of the writers of the 1972 television series Pretenders, and of the 1974 series The Carnforth Practice. In 1975, he was commissioned by then-Doctor Who script editor Robert Holmes to pen a two-part serial entitled The Angurth for the programme's thirteenth season. This was eventually abandoned, but in 1981, Pringle was encouraged by his agent, former Who producer Peter Bryant, to submit new material for the show. Pringle delivered two proposals for four- part stories to the production office in August, one called The Darkness (possibly featuring the Daleks) and another entitled War Game. Script editor Eric Saward finally responded to Pringle, and in 1982, Pringle was asked to put together a scene breakdown for War Game. By 1983, War Game had been rechristened The Awakening (and may also have been called Poltergeist at some point). Saward and producer John Nathan-Turner had also come to the realisation that the story did not merit four episodes, and so Pringle was asked to condense it down to fit the two-part slot for Season Twenty-One. Pringle concurred and performed the necessary rewrites by April. Saward was still not satisfied with Pringle's modifications; consequently, he elected to heavily rewrite The Awakening. Pringle was not particularly pleased with Saward's rewrites, believing they made the story confusing and rushed. The Awakening would be his only contribution to Doctor Who. Much of Pringle's more recent work has been for the radio including adaptations of The Wolves of Willoughby Chase and J. B. Priestley's The Good Companions. His 2001 BBC Radio 4 play Hymus Paradisi about the life of composer Herbert Howells won a Sony Award. That year also saw the publication of his children's novel Big George. This has been followed by two sequels Big George and the Seventh Knight and Big George and the Winter King. The Big George books are a retelling of the Saint George and the Dragon myth with a science fiction twist. ==References== ==External links== * *Eric Pringle radio plays Category:British children's writers Category:British television writers Category:People from Morpeth, Northumberland Category:1935 births Category:2017 deaths ","title":"Eric Pringle"},{"id":"2202422","text":"Myoglobin (blue) with its ligand heme (orange) bound. Based on In biochemistry and pharmacology, a ligand is a substance that forms a complex with a biomolecule to serve a biological purpose. In protein-ligand binding, the ligand is usually a molecule which produces a signal by binding to a site on a target protein. The binding typically results in a change of conformational isomerism (conformation) of the target protein. In DNA-ligand binding studies, the ligand can be a small molecule, ion, or protein which binds to the DNA double helix. The relationship between ligand and binding partner is a function of charge, hydrophobicity, and molecular structure. The instance of binding occurs over an infinitesimal range of time and space, so the rate constant is usually a very small number. Binding occurs by intermolecular forces, such as ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals forces. The association or docking is actually reversible through dissociation. Measurably irreversible covalent bonding between a ligand and target molecule is atypical in biological systems. In contrast to the definition of ligand in metalorganic and inorganic chemistry, in biochemistry it is ambiguous whether the ligand generally binds at a metal site, as is the case in hemoglobin. In general, the interpretation of ligand is contextual with regards to what sort of binding has been observed. The etymology stems from ligare, which means 'to bind'. Ligand binding to a receptor protein alters the conformation by affecting the three-dimensional shape orientation. The conformation of a receptor protein composes the functional state. Ligands include substrates, inhibitors, activators, signaling lipids, and neurotransmitters. The rate of binding is called affinity, and this measurement typifies a tendency or strength of the effect. Binding affinity is actualized not only by host‚Äìguest interactions, but also by solvent effects that can play a dominant, steric role which drives non-covalent binding in solution. The solvent provides a chemical environment for the ligand and receptor to adapt, and thus accept or reject each other as partners. Radioligands are radioisotope labeled compounds used in vivo as tracers in PET studies and for in vitro binding studies. == Receptor/ligand binding affinity== The interaction of ligands with their binding sites can be characterized in terms of a binding affinity. In general, high-affinity ligand binding results from greater attractive forces between the ligand and its receptor while low-affinity ligand binding involves less attractive force. In general, high-affinity binding results in a higher occupancy of the receptor by its ligand than is the case for low-affinity binding; the residence time (lifetime of the receptor-ligand complex) does not correlate. High-affinity binding of ligands to receptors is often physiologically important when some of the binding energy can be used to cause a conformational change in the receptor, resulting in altered behavior for example of an associated ion channel or enzyme. A ligand that can bind to and alter the function of the receptor that triggers a physiological response is called a receptor agonist. Ligands that bind to a receptor but fail to activate the physiological response are receptor antagonists. Two agonists with similar binding affinity Agonist binding to a receptor can be characterized both in terms of how much physiological response can be triggered (that is, the efficacy) and in terms of the concentration of the agonist that is required to produce the physiological response (often measured as EC50, the concentration required to produced the half-maximal response). High-affinity ligand binding implies that a relatively low concentration of a ligand is adequate to maximally occupy a ligand-binding site and trigger a physiological response. Receptor affinity is measured by an inhibition constant or Ki value, the concentration required to occupy 50% of the receptor. Ligand affinities are most often measured indirectly as an IC50 value from a competition binding experiment where the concentration of a ligand required to displace 50% of a fixed concentration of reference ligand is determined. The Ki value can be estimated from IC50 through the Cheng Prusoff equation. Ligand affinities can also be measured directly as a dissociation constant (Kd) using methods such as fluorescence quenching, isothermal titration calorimetry or surface plasmon resonance. Low- affinity binding (high Ki level) implies that a relatively high concentration of a ligand is required before the binding site is maximally occupied and the maximum physiological response to the ligand is achieved. In the example shown to the right, two different ligands bind to the same receptor binding site. Only one of the agonists shown can maximally stimulate the receptor and, thus, can be defined as a full agonist. An agonist that can only partially activate the physiological response is called a partial agonist. In this example, the concentration at which the full agonist (red curve) can half-maximally activate the receptor is about 5 x 10‚àí9 Molar (nM = nanomolar). Two ligands with different receptor binding affinity. Binding affinity is most commonly determined using a radiolabeled ligand, known as a tagged ligand. Homologous competitive binding experiments involve binding competition between a tagged ligand and an untagged ligand. See Homologous competitive binding curves , A complete guide to nonlinear regression, curvefit.com. Real-time based methods, which are often label-free, such as surface plasmon resonance, dual- polarization interferometry and multi-parametric surface plasmon resonance (MP-SPR) can not only quantify the affinity from concentration based assays; but also from the kinetics of association and dissociation, and in the later cases, the conformational change induced upon binding. MP-SPR also enables measurements in high saline dissociation buffers thanks to a unique optical setup. Microscale thermophoresis (MST), an immobilization-free method was developed. This method allows the determination of the binding affinity without any limitation to the ligand's molecular weight. For the use of statistical mechanics in a quantitative study of the ligand-receptor binding affinity, see the comprehensive articleVu-Quoc, L., Configuration integral (statistical mechanics), 2008. this wiki site is down; see this article in the web archive on 2012 April 28. on the configurational partition function. === Drug potency and binding affinity === Binding affinity data alone does not determine the overall potency of a drug. Potency is a result of the complex interplay of both the binding affinity and the ligand efficacy. Ligand efficacy refers to the ability of the ligand to produce a biological response upon binding to the target receptor and the quantitative magnitude of this response. This response may be as an agonist, antagonist, or inverse agonist, depending on the physiological response produced. ==Selective and non- selective== Selective ligands have a tendency to bind to very limited kinds of receptor, whereas non-selective ligands bind to several types of receptors. This plays an important role in pharmacology, where drugs that are non- selective tend to have more adverse effects, because they bind to several other receptors in addition to the one generating the desired effect. ==Hydrophobic ligands== For hydrophobic ligands (e.g. PIP2) in complex with a hydrophobic protein (e.g. lipid-gated ion channels) determining the affinity is complicated by non-specific hydrophobic interactions. Non-specific hydrophobic interactions can be overcome when the affinity of the ligand is high. For example, PIP2 binds with high affinity to PIP2 gated ion channels. ==Bivalent ligand== Bivalent ligands consist of two drug-like molecules (pharmacophores or ligands) connected by an inert linker. There are various kinds of bivalent ligands and are often classified based on what the pharmacophores target. Homobivalent ligands target two of the same receptor types. Heterobivalent ligands target two different receptor types. Bitopic ligands target an orthosteric binding sites and allosteric binding sites on the same receptor. In scientific research, bivalent ligands have been used to study receptor dimers and to investigate their properties. This class of ligands was pioneered by Philip S. Portoghese and coworkers while studying the opioid receptor system. Bivalent ligands were also reported early on by Micheal Conn and coworkers for the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor. Since these early reports, there have been many bivalent ligands reported for various G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) systems including cannabinoid, serotonin, oxytocin, and melanocortin receptor systems, and for GPCR-LIC systems (D2 and nACh receptors). Bivalent ligands usually tend to be larger than their monovalent counterparts, and therefore, not 'drug-like.' (See Lipinski's rule of five.) Many believe this limits their applicability in clinical settings. In spite of these beliefs, there have been many ligands that have reported successful pre-clinical animal studies. Given that some bivalent ligands can have many advantages compared to their monovalent counterparts (such as tissue selectivity, increased binding affinity, and increased potency or efficacy), bivalents may offer some clinical advantages as well. ==Mono- and polydesmic ligands== Ligands of proteins can be characterized also by the number of protein chains they bind. ‚ÄúMonodesmic‚Äù ligands (ŒºœåŒΩŒøœÇ: single, Œ¥ŒµœÉŒºœåœÇ: binding) are ligands that bind a single protein chain, while \\"polydesmic‚Äù ligands (œÄŒøŒªŒøŒØ: many) are frequent in protein complexes, and are ligands that bind more than one protein chain, typically in or near protein interfaces. Recent research shows that the type of ligands and binding site structure has profound consequences for the evolution, function, allostery and folding of protein compexes. ==Privileged scaffold== A privileged scaffold is a molecular framework or chemical moiety that is statistically recurrent among known drugs or among a specific array of biologically active compounds. These privileged elements can be used as a basis for designing new active biological compounds or compound libraries. ==Methods used to study binding== Main methods to study protein‚Äìligand interactions are principal hydrodynamic and calorimetric techniques, and principal spectroscopic and structural methods such as *Fourier transform spectroscopy *Raman spectroscopy *Fluorescence spectroscopy *Circular dichroism *Nuclear magnetic resonance *Mass spectrometry *Atomic force microscope *Paramagnetic probes *Dual polarisation interferometry *Multi- parametric surface plasmon resonance *Ligand binding assay and radioligand binding assay Other techniques include: fluorescence intensity, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, FRET (fluorescent resonance energy transfer) / FRET quenching surface plasmon resonance, bio-layer interferometry, Coimmunopreciptation indirect ELISA, equilibrium dialysis, gel electrophoresis, far western blot, fluorescence polarization anisotropy, electron paramagnetic resonance, microscale thermophoresis The dramatically increased computing power of supercomputers and personal computers has made it possible to study protein‚Äìligand interactions also by means of computational chemistry. For example, a worldwide grid of well over a million ordinary PCs was harnessed for cancer research in the project grid.org, which ended in April 2007. Grid.org has been succeeded by similar projects such as World Community Grid, Human Proteome Folding Project, Compute Against Cancer and Folding@Home. == See also == * Agonist * Schild regression * Allosteric regulation * Ki Database * Docking@Home * GPUGRID.net * DNA binding ligand * BindingDB * SAMPL Challenge == References == == External links == *BindingDB, a public database of measured protein-ligand binding affinities. *BioLiP, a comprehensive database for ligand-protein interactions.

They reached the borders of Ugljesa's lands. Ugljesa realized the danger and tried to create a coalition against the Turks. His idea was to drive them out of Europe instead of trying to defend fortresses and cities. He failed to secure support from the Byzantines and the Bulgarians. Most of the Serbian lords were occupied fighting each other and didn't realize the extent of the danger. The only Serbian lord who supported Uglje≈°a's ideas was his brother Vuka≈°in. In the summer of 1371, Vuka≈°in marched to Zeta, to support his relative ƒêuraƒë Bal≈°iƒá in was against Nikola Altomanoviƒá. His army was in Skadar, waiting for naval support from the Republic of Ragusa. Uglje≈°a received information that the majority of Ottoman forces left Europe and marched to Anatolia.

The Ottoman army was much smaller, Byzantine Greek scholar Laonikos Chalkokondyles and different sources give the number of 800 up to 4,000 men,Donald MacGillivray Nicol, The Last Centuries of Byzantium, 1261-1453; Hart-Davis, 1972, p. 286. but due to superior tactics, by conducting a night raid on the Christian camp, ≈û√¢hin Pa≈üa was able to defeat the Christian army and kill King Vuka≈°in and despot Uglje≈°a. Thousands of Christians were killed, and thousands drowned in the Maritsa river when they tried to flee. After the battle, the Maritsa ran scarlet with blood.Temperley, Harold William Vazeille. History of Serbia, H. Fertig, 1917, page 97. ==Aftermath== Parts of Macedonia and Thrace fell under Ottoman power after this battle. The battle was a part of the Ottoman campaign to conquer the Balkans and was preceded by the Ottoman capturing of Sozopol in modern Bulgaria and succeeded by the capture of the cities of Drama, Kav√°la, and Serrai in modern Greece. The battle preceded the later 1389 Battle of Kosovo, and was one of many in the Serbian‚ÄìTurkish wars. ==See also== * List of military disasters ==Notes== ==References== * Rossos, Andrew, Macedonia and the Macedonians, Hoover Institution Press Publications, 2008. * Sedlar, Jean W., East Central Europe in the Middle Ages, 1000-1500, University of Washington Press, 1994. * Stavrianos, L.

It was also distributed in Africa on DStv. It is the first channel from Moving Movies Ltd., majority-owned by CSC Media Group (formerly Chart Show Channels). The channel was dedicated to true-to-life drama films, mostly made for TV. It showed films from a range of cinematic genres including romance, crime, drama and docusoaps, mostly based on real-life events. ==History== Prior to True Movies' launch on 29 April 2005, the channel was previously an unnamed part- time service found on TWC Re:Loaded from 1 March 2005, before being renamed as Movies 333 on 21 March 2005. Soon after its launch, True Movies topped all the film channels in August 2005, with a 0.5% audience viewing share, higher than the established subscription Sky Movies 1 (0.4%) and Turner Classic Movies (0.3%). With the arrival of other film channels and services in 2006, its audience share dropped to between 0.1% to 0.2%. True Movies' sister channel, True Movies 2, was launched on 20 March 2006, with similar programming. The channel was renamed True Movies 1 from August 2009, but after the closure of True Movies 2 in 2016 it was renamed back to True Movies. On 6 September 2011 the channel was made available on Virgin Media Ireland. From 2013 til 2018, the channel temporarily rebranded to True Christmas, from late September to early January - during which time it would only show Christmas films. On 26 October 2015 the channel was made available on Freeview in areas that support local TV. Now only broadcasting between 9pm and 5am although it might have different times on various local multiplexes around the country. For example - in London (on 24 January 2018) it showed as 1pm to 7am in the EPG and was off- air (as predicted by the EPG) at 12 noon. On 19 October 2017, True Movies is now in all platforms on Freeview channel 62, moving from Local TV to COM6 however the channel was known as True Christmas by this time, but on 4 April, True Movies began to broadcast 24 hours a day and full time on Freeview. On 27 June 2019 True Movies moved to Freeview channel 50, and its +1 service moved to its old spot on Freeview channel 62. On 24 July 2019, it was announced that the channel would be closed and replaced by Sony Movies Classic on 7 January 2020, which took effect after the temporary seasonal replacement Sony Movies Christmas on 10 September 2019. ==Programming== An example of some of the films shown on True Movies: *Assault at West Point *Before Women Had Wings *Deep in My Heart *Fatal Love *First Do No Harm *Invisible Child *Noble House *Our Sons *Perfect Murder, Perfect Town *Saved by the Light *Sudie and Simpson *The Amy Fisher Story *The Day of the Roses *Without Evidence ==References== Category:CSC Media Group Category:English-language television stations in the United Kingdom Category:Movie channels in the United Kingdom Category:Sony Pictures Television Category:Television channels and stations established in 2005 Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 2019 ","title":"True Movies"},{"id":"2202454","text":"SM-Trax is an electronic duo from Germany consisting of producers Stefan Grunwald and Mirko von Schlieffen.

If no improvement is seen after 3 months, stopping the medication is reasonable. It may also be used to prevent stroke. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headache, diarrhea, dizziness, and cough. Serious side effects may include decreased survival in those with heart failure, low platelets, and low white blood cells. Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor which works by inhibiting platelet aggregation and dilating arteries. Cilostazol was approved for medical use in the United States in 1999. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 301st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions. ==Medical uses== Cilostazol is approved for the treatment of intermittent claudication in the United States. Such use however is not recommended in the United Kingdom. Cilostazol is also used for secondary stroke prevention, though to date no regulatory body has approved it specifically for that indication. ===Heart failure=== Cilostazol is dangerous for people with severe heart failure. Cilostazol has been studied in people without heart failure, without evidence of harm, but much more data would be needed to determine no risk exists. Although cilostazol would not be approvable for a trivial condition the Cardio-Renal Advisory Committee and FDA concluded that fully informed patients and physicians should be able to choose to use it to treat intermittent claudication. Patient and physician labeling will describe the basis for concern and the incomplete information available. ==Adverse effects== Possible side effects of cilostazol use include headache (the most common), diarrhea, severe heat intolerance, abnormal stools, increased heart rate, and palpitations. == Interactions == Cilostazol is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, two isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450 system. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4, such as itraconazole, erythromycin, ketoconazole, and diltiazem, are known to interact with cilostazol. The proton pump inhibitor omeprazole, an inhibitor of CYP2C19, increases exposure to the active metabolite of cilostazol. A single report has been made of grapefruit juice possibly increasing the effects of cilostazol; some drug information sources list this as a possible interaction. The FDA-approved labeling of cilostazol notes that grapefruit juice (which is a CYP3A4 inhibitor) increases the drug's maximum concentration by around 50%. ==Mechanism== Cilostazol is a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 3 (PDE3) with therapeutic focus on increasing cAMP. An increase in cAMP results in an increase in the active form of protein kinase A (PKA), which is directly related with an inhibition in platelet aggregation. PKA also prevents the activation of an enzyme (myosin light-chain kinase) that is important in the contraction of smooth muscle cells, thereby exerting its vasodilatory effect. == References == == External links == * Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate Category:Antiplatelet drugs Category:Vasodilators Category:Tetrazoles Category:2-Quinolone ethers at the benzene ring Category:PDE3 inhibitors Category:Otsuka Pharmaceutical ","title":"Cilostazol"},{"id":"2202487","text":"Mount Pleasant, Ontario may refer to: *Mount Pleasant, Brampton, Ontario *Mount Pleasant, Brant County, Ontario *Mount Pleasant, Durham County, Ontario *Mount Pleasant, Grey County, Ontario *Mount Pleasant, Hastings County, Ontario *Mount Pleasant, Lanark and Carleton County, Ontario *Mount Pleasant, Lennox and Addington County, Ontario *Mount Pleasant, Perth County, Ontario *Mount Pleasant, Peterborough County, Ontario *Mount Pleasant, Prince Edward District, Canada West (later Prince Edward County) *Mount Pleasant, Waterloo County, Ontario *Mount Pleasant, York Regional Municipality, Ontario (#1), within North Gwillimbury Township *Mount Pleasant, York Regional Municipality, Ontario (#11), another name for Miles Hill, which is now part of Richmond Hill *Mount Pleasant, York Regional Municipality, Ontario (#13) In Toronto: * Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto, Ontario ** Mount Pleasant Road, a street in Toronto, Ontario ","title":"Mount Pleasant, Ontario"},{"id":"2202489","text":" The RWD 17 was a Polish aerobatics-trainer aircraft of 1937, parasol wing monoplane, constructed by the RWD team. ==Development== The aircraft was designed for an order of the LOPP paramilitary organization, as an interim trainer aircraft between primary trainer RWD 8 and single-seater aircraft, demanding higher skills, like the RWD 10. It was also fitted to aerobatics. The construction of the new aircraft was very similar to the RWD 8, but almost all parts were newly designed. Main visual difference were twin struts supporting wings, instead of V-struts, and two-part wing instead of three- part, without central section. The works started in 1936, and the main designer was Bronis≈Çaw ≈ªurakowski of the RWD bureau. The first prototype (registration SP-BMX) was flown in August 1937 in Warsaw. After state trials in 1937, it was accepted for production, and in 1938 a short series of RWD 17 was produced (23 serial RWD 17 were in the Polish registry). In early 1938, a floatplane variant RWD 17W was designed, differing among others in a more powerful Bramo Sh 14a radial engine. It had interchangeable floats or land undercarriage. When on floats, a bigger tail-fin, extending downwards was mounted. The prototype was flown with a land undercarriage in June 1938, then tested on floats. Next, 5 RWD 17Ws were ordered for the Polish Naval Aviation Squadron (MDLot) at Puck, for use as trainers, built in 1939. In early 1939 a new wing for the RWD 17 was developed, slightly longer, with thinner profile and narrowing wingtips. It gave better aerobatics capability. Because of problems with its counterpart PWS-35, the Polish Air Force got interested in the modified RWD 17 as a successor of the PWS-26 intermediate trainer; plans to order 50-120 aircraft, with a likely designation RWD 17bis, were not actioned due to the outbreak war. ==Usage== RWD 17s were flown by the Polish Aero Club and an aviation school in ≈öwidnik before World War II. During the Invasion of Poland in September 1939, eight of them, including the prototype, were evacuated to Romania. Reportedly, 2 more were evacuated to Latvia. One RWD 17, used by the 56th Observation Escadre as a liaison aircraft, crashed on 12 September 1939. Apart from the prototype RWD 17W, carrying civilian registration SP-BPB, 5 other RWD 17W floatplanes were produced. Two were commissioned with the Polish Navy just before the outbreak of the war, but they did not get to the Polish Naval Aviation Squadron. The prototype was kept camouflaged in a forest on Hel Peninsula during its siege. On 30 September the aircraft attempted to evacuate to Sweden, however due to engine trouble it crashed in the sea near the peninsula, (the crew was saved). It was the last flight of a Polish aircraft during the Polish September Campaign. Three other RWD 17W, being in a factory in Warsaw, with land undercarriage, were evacuated to Romania (nos. 311, 312, 314), while the remaining two (nos. 313 and 315) were used as liaison aircraft near Warsaw and destroyed thereafter. In Romania RWD 17s were used until the late 1940s. None returned to Poland after the war, and none have survived. ==Description== Mixed construction braced high-wing (parasol wing) monoplane, conventional in layout, single-engine, with open cockpits.

It generates revenues of approximately $33.5 billion and employs approximately 33,400 people. Exelon is the largest electric parent company in the United States by revenue, the largest regulated electric utility in the United States with approximately 10 million customers, and also the largest operator of nuclear power plants in the United States and the largest non-governmental operator of nuclear power plants in the world. Exelon was created in October 2000 by the merger of PECO Energy Company of Philadelphia and Unicom Corp of Chicago, which owned Commonwealth Edison. Exelon operates regulated utilities in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, and Washington, DC. In October 2009, Exelon had full or majority ownership of 23 nuclear reactors in 14 nuclear power plants. Exelon has operations and business activities in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Canada, and is the largest competitive U.S. power generator with approximately 35,500 megawatts of owned capacity. Exelon merged with Constellation Energy Group in March 2012 and acquired Pepco Holdings in March 2016. Exelon consists of eight main operating subsidiaries with Exelon Generation, a deregulated energy generator, Constellation Energy Group, a deregulated competitive energy supplier, and six regulated utilities, Commonwealth Edison (Illinois), PECO Energy Company (Pennsylvania), Baltimore Gas and Electric (Maryland), Delmarva Power & Light (Delaware and Maryland), Atlantic City Electric (New Jersey), and Potomac Electric Power Company (Washington, DC and Maryland). ==History== Exelon Corporation was created as the result of a merger between PECO Energy Company and the Unicom Corporation in October 2000. Unicom was based in Chicago and the city became the home of the new entity. The merger was overseen by the CEO of Unicom, John Rowe who joined the corporation in 1998 and went on to lead the newly-formed Exelon until 2012, becoming the nation's longest-serving utility executive. Under Rowe, Exelon explored a number of mergers and acquisitions. On June 30, 2005, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the merger of Exelon and Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., a New Jersey utility. Under this merger, Exelon would have become the largest utility in the United States. The two companies later broke off the agreementPress Releases due to pressure put on the NJ Board of Public Utilities by public interest groups, including New Jersey Citizen Action. The merger sat pending in front of the NJBPU for nineteen months before Exelon concluded that they were fighting a losing battle. On April 28, 2011, Exelon announced a merger with Constellation Energy for $7.9 billion with the combined company owning more than 34 gigawatts of power generation (55 percent nuclear, 24 percent natural gas, 8 percent renewable including hydro, 7 percent oil and 6 percent coal). The merger was completed on March 12, 2012. In 2012, when announcing the cancellation of new nuclear construction for Victoria County Station, Texas, Exelon stated that economic and market conditions, especially low natural gas prices, made the \\"construction of new merchant nuclear power plants in competitive markets uneconomical now and for the foreseeable future\\". In 2008, Christopher Crane was named CEO following Rowe's retirement and the completion of the merger with Constellation Energy. Exelon announced the proposed purchase of Pepco Holdings, Inc on April 30, 2014, for $6.8 billion in an all-cash transaction. The merger was rejected by the District of Columbia Public Service Commission in August 2015, though it was approved by other federal and state regulators. The companies appealed the decision. On March 23, 2016, the merger was approved by the Washington DC Public Service Commission, under a revised set of terms. The merger was completed later that day making Exelon the largest regulated utility in the United States by customer count and total revenue. ===Controversies=== PECO Energy, one of Exelon's local power companies, has been involved in two controversies with activists.

The two plants create approximately 23 percent of emission-free electricity in Illinois. Passage of the bill and keeping the plants open is expected to preserve around $1.2 billion in annual economic activity within the state. In August 2016, Exelon agreed to purchase the James A. Fitzpatrick Nuclear Power Plant from Entergy Corporation. Exelon formally acquired ownership and operation of James A. Fitzpatrick Nuclear Power Plant on March 31, 2017. In August 2020, Exelon decided to close the Byron and Dresden plants in 2021 for economic reasons, despite the plants having licenses to operate for another 20 and 10 years respectively. Exelon will continue discussions with policymakers to try to prevent the closures.

Since divesting from coal, the company is better positioned than many of its competitors to benefit from carbon pricing under a cap and trade plan for reducing carbon dioxide emissions.Jonathan Fahey [The Carbon Windfall]; Exelon's John Rowe has been planning for expensive carbon for a decade. Now it's time to push for the payoff. Pages 70‚Äì74. January 18, 2010. Forbes \\"[Former] Exelon CEO John Rowe is a vociferous and longtime advocate of climate change legislation. In 2009, Forbes reported that if the Waxman-Markey climate legislation became law, 'the present value of Exelon's earnings stream would increase by $14 a share, or 28%.'\\" Exelon also disclosed multiple contributions to political nonprofit organizations, the largest of which was $290,000 given to the American Energy Alliance ‚Äì a 501(c)(4) nonprofit with ties to the conservative billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch and led by former Koch Industries lobbyist Thomas Pyle. ==Pollution, security incidents== In 2005, Exelon was required to pay a $602,000 fine for exceeding the permitted sulfur dioxide emission limit from April to October 2004 at its Cromby Generating Station in Chester County, Pennsylvania. Exelon and Illinois state officials waited for four years until 2006 before disclosing that Exelon's Braidwood Nuclear Generating Station, a nuclear plant 60 miles southwest of Chicago, had spilled millions of gallons of water containing tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen, multiple times over a decade. Exelon officials eventually apologized and said the risks from the leak were \\"minimal\\", with tritium levels in surrounding wells all found to be below regulatory limits. In 2009, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced its plan for a $65,000 fine against Exelon for permitting its contracted security guards that were guarding its Peach Bottom Nuclear Generating Station, a two-reactor nuclear plant located in Delta, Pennsylvania, to sleep on the job. The incidents did not come to light until a videotape of the security guards was leaked to news media.Nuclear Regulatory Commission news release As a result, Exelon terminated the security contract of the Wackenhut security firm that had been involved and now operates its own in-house nuclear security force. ==References== ==External links== *Exelon Corporation website *Constellation website *BGE website *ComEd website *PECO website *Exelon PowerLabs website Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ Category:Companies in the Dow Jones Utility Average Category:Electric power companies of the United States Category:Companies based in Chicago Category:Energy companies established in 2000 Category:Natural gas companies of the United States Category:Nuclear power companies of the United States Category:Hydroelectric power companies of the United States Category:2000 establishments in Illinois ","title":"Exelon"},{"id":"2202522","text":"Khalid Bakdash (15November 191224July 1995; occasionally spelled Khalid Bagdash or Khaled Bekdache, ) was a Syrian politician who lead the Syrian Communist Party (SCP) from 1936 until his death. In 1954 Bakdash became the first member of a communist party to be elected to an Arab parliament. He has since been called the \\"dean of Arab communism.\\" ==Early life== Born in Damascene Kurdish neighborhood to a Syrian-Albanian family. He was first recruited to the communist cause at the age of 18, while a student at Damascus University. He was subsequently active in student agitation against the French occupation of Syria, and came to the attention of the police. In 1933 the party judged it best that he leave the country, and in 1934 he enrolled in the Communist University of the Toilers of the East in Moscow. During this time, Bakdash produced the first Arabic-language translation of The Communist Manifesto. ==Secretary of the Syrian Communist Party== Returning in 1936, Bakdash took control of the Communist Party of Syria and Lebanon as secretary, a post he would retain without interruption for the rest of his life. He led the Syrian underground against Vichy France during that regime's control of Syria. When Syria came under allied control in 1942, the French government promised it independence and legalised the Communist Party, until then banned. Bakdash took a moderate approach as secretary of the Syrian Communist Party. The party rules and programme which he drew up in 1944 reflected a determination to conform to the political circumstances of the Arab world of the time. They emphasized the party's attachment to the anti-colonial struggle and sought to establish it as a democratic mass movement rather than the restricted Marxist‚ÄìLeninist vanguard organisation which a close adherence to Leninist principles might have dictated. Although Bakdash is often referred to as the doyen or elder statesman of Arab communism, his actual influence on other Arab communist parties was not as great as this phrase might suggest. He had, in particular, a stormy relationship with Fahd, leader of the Iraqi Communist Party from 1941 until 1949. In the early to mid-1940s Bakdash supported the Iraqi People's Party led by Aziz Sharif, which followed the example of the Syrian Communist Party in seeking to build a broad party emphasizing the national question, contrary to the more orthodox Leninist approach adopted by Fahd's party. Fahd also appears to have suspected him of suborning Iraqi communists resident in Damascus. ==The Arab world's first communist deputy== Bakdash won a seat in Parliament in 1954, and during Syria's turbulent democratic period from 1954 to 1958 steered a cautious course. The main difficulty confronting him in this period was the question of Arab unity and in particular of unification with Gamal Abdel Nasser's Egypt. Bakdash was extremely critical of Nasser, especially after the latter started a campaign of repression against his political opponents, notably the Communists and Muslim Brothers. Nasser did not approve of political pluralism and parties were banned under his rule. However, popular support for unity with Egypt forced Bakdash to accommodate to circumstances. Hanna Batatu, a notable historian of modern Arab politics, speculates that he must have been aware, and perhaps approved of, the participation of a communist general in the Syrian delegation which persuaded Gamal Abdel Nasser to proceed to the creation of the United Arab Republic which united Syria with Egypt in 1958. However, Bakdash himself provoked a harsh reaction from the Egyptian leader with his attack on the latter's policies published in December 1958, in which he called for legalization of political parties and transformation of the UAR into a loose federation. This resulted in a fierce campaign of repression against the party. Bakdash himself left Syria for Moscow, where he would stay until 1966. Syria seceded from the UAR in 1961, a decision supported by important elements in the army and the bourgeoisie as well as by the communists, but the separation was intensely controversial and the parties that had supported it found their popular backing greatly reduced; the Syrian party was reduced to some hundreds of members. ==Party leader under Ba'thist rule== On 8 March 1963 a coup by supporters of reunification with Egypt, essentially Baathists, Nasserists and the Arab Nationalist Movement put an end to the separatist government, although in the event reunification never took place. From then until the 1970s, the Communist Party would be repressed to one degree or another. In 1966, the Syrian Ba'ath's secret military committee took power, and implemented a far-left line. Bakdash was allowed to return from Moscow, but forbidden from engaging in public political activity. After Hafez al-Assad took power in Syria in 1970, he announced his intention of reintroducing political pluralism in the context of popular democracy. This took the form of the National Progressive Front, a coalition of parties who supported the Arab nationalist and socialist orientation of the government and accepted the leadership of the Ba'ath Party. Faced with the choice between joining the front and illegal operation, Bakdash opted to join; Riyad al-Turk would later lead a small radical faction of the party into opposition. In 1986, a difference of opinion between Bakdash and deputy general secretary Yusuf Faisal led to a split in the party. Faisal was supportive of the new policies of perestroika and glasnost being pursued by Soviet party secretary Mikhail Gorbachev; Bakdash was opposed. Many of the intellectuals in the party left with Faisal, while Bakdash retained the support of the party's considerable Kurdish base. Khalid Bakdash died in Damascus in 1995 at the age of 83. His widow, Wisal Farha Bakdash, succeeded him as party secretary. == References == *Collelo, Thomas. 1988. Syria, A Country Study.

It was financed by the United States Navy. Howard Aiken and Grace Hopper worked together to program and build the Mark II. ==Overview== The Mark II was constructed with high-speed electromagnetic relays instead of electro-mechanical counters used in the Mark I, making it much faster than its predecessor. It weighted . Its addition time was 0.125 seconds (8 Hz) and the multiplication time was 0.750 seconds. This was a factor of 2.6 faster for addition and a factor 8 faster for multiplication compared to the Mark I. It was the second machine (after the Bell Labs Relay Calculator) to have floating-point hardware. A unique feature of the Mark II is that it had built- in hardware for several functions such as the reciprocal, square root, logarithm, exponential, and some trigonometric functions. These took between five and twelve seconds to execute. The Mark I and Mark II were not a stored- program computer ‚Äì it read an instruction of the program one at a time from a tape and executed it (like the Mark I). This separation of data and instructions is known as the Harvard architecture. The Mark II had a peculiar programming method that was devised to ensure that the contents of a register were available when needed. The tape containing the program could encode only eight instructions, so what a particular instruction code meant depended on when it was executed. Each second was divided up into several periods, and a coded instruction could mean different things in different periods. An addition could be started in any of eight periods in the second, a multiplication could be started in any of four periods of the second, and a transfer of data could be started in any of twelve periods of the second. Although this system worked, it made the programming complicated, and it reduced the efficiency of the machine somewhat.Williams, 1985, pages 248-251 The Mark II ran some realistic test programs in 1947. It was delivered to the US Navy Proving Ground at Dahlgren, Virginia in 1948 and became operational by the end of that year. ==See also== * Harvard Mark I * Harvard Mark III * Harvard Mark IV ==References== ==Further reading== * * * Category:1940s computers Category:Computer-related introductions in 1947 Category:Electro- mechanical computers Category:One-of-a-kind computers Category:Harvard University ","title":"Harvard Mark II"},{"id":"2202535","text":"Alastair Hugh Fitter CBE FRS (born 20 June 1948) is a British ecologist at the University of York.

It does not produce sounds, but controls other devices (such as keyboards, sound modules and samplers) via MIDI. The industrial design of the Roland AX-1 was done in a basement studio in London, U.K. by two designers, David Sherriff and Andrew Leggo, who ran a small design studio called Space Logic. The electronic design and engineering was done by Roland Europe, Italy. ===AX-7=== An AX-7 The Roland AX-7 was manufactured from 2001 to 2007. This modern instrument contains many more advanced features than early keytars such as its predecessor, the Roland AX-1, and the Yamaha SHS-10. It runs on 6 AA batteries or an external power source. It has a 45 velocity sensitive keys (without aftertouch), and a 3-character LED display. Several features aimed towards stage performance are present, such as a pitch bend ribbon, touchpad-like expression bar, sustain switch, and volume control knob, all on the upper neck of the instrument. There is also a proprietary \\"D-Beam\\" interface, made up of infrared sensors that detect nearby motion. In 2007 the Roland AX-7 was discontinued and is succeeded by the Roland AX-Synth since 2009.  MIDI functionality  This instrument functions as a MIDI controller; it produces MIDI messages that are sent to an external synthesizer or sound module. (Thus it produces no sound on its own.) It is fully compatible with General MIDI, General MIDI Level 2, and Roland's own GS MIDI implementation. It has both MIDI in and out ports, and can store up to 128 patches. ===AX-Synth=== The Roland AX-Synth was released in late August 2009. This modernized instrument builds on the features of its predecessor, the Roland AX-7. The most notable change is the addition of an internal synthesizer. A UV Black-colored \\"premium\\" model called \\"Black Sparkle\\" was released in September 2010.

In the 1870s, he produced many acclaimed watercolor views of the White Mountains, several of which are now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Richards exhibited at the National Academy of Design from 1861 to 1899, and at the Brooklyn Art Association from 1863 to 1885. He was elected a full member of the National Academy in 1871. In 1881, he built a house in Jamestown, Rhode Island, where he lived and worked for the remainder of his life. He died on April 17, 1905, in Newport, Rhode Island. ==Style== Richards rejected the romanticized and stylized approach of other Hudson River painters and instead insisted on meticulous factual renderings. His views of the White Mountains are almost photographic in their realism. In later years, Richards painted almost exclusively marine watercolors. His works are featured today in many important American museums, including the National Gallery, the Saint Louis Art Museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Wadsworth Atheneum, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Yale University Art Gallery, the High Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Fogg Art Museum, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Berkshire Museum, the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. His daughter Anna Richards Brewster also became a painter. ==Gallery== Image:William Trost Richards - Seascape with Distant Lighthouse, Atlantic City, New Jersey (1873).jpgSeascape with Distant Lighthouse, Atlantic City, New Jersey, 1873, Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum File:Brooklyn Museum - The League Long Breakers Thundering on the Reef - William Trost Richards.jpgThe League Long Breakers Thundering on the Reef, 1887, Brooklyn Museum File:Brooklyn Museum - Early Summer - William Trost Richards - overall.jpgEarly Summer, 1888, Brooklyn Museum File:William Trost Richards - The Rainbow (1890).jpgThe Rainbow, 1890, Minnesota Marine Art Museum File:From the Flume House, Franconia, New Hampshire MET ap80.1.12.jpgFrom the Flume House, Franconia, New Hampshire, 1872, Metropolitan Museum of Art File:Franconia Notch, New Hampshire MET ap80.1.5.jpgFranconia Notch, New Hampshire, 1872, Metropolitan Museum of Art File:Mount Chocorua and Lake MET ap80.1.7.jpgMount Chocorua and Lake, 1873, Metropolitan Museum of Art File:William Trost Richards, Nantucket Shore.jpgNantucket Shore, 1865, Nantucket Historical Association ==References== ==Further reading== * Ferber, Linda S., In search of a national landscape : William Trost Richards and the artists' Adirondacks, 1850-1870, Blue Mountain Lake, N.Y., Adirondack Museum, 2002. * Ferber, Linda S., Never at fault, the drawings of William Trost Richards, Yonkers, N.Y., Hudson River Museum, 1986. == External links == * William Trost Richards Papers at the Smithsonian's Archives of American Art *William Trost Richards exhibition catalogs * William Trost Richards collection at the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum *American Paradise: The World of the Hudson River School, an exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art (fully available online as PDF), which contains material on Richards (see index) Category:1833 births Category:1905 deaths Category:19th-century American painters Category:American male painters Category:20th-century American painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:American landscape painters Category:Artists from Philadelphia Category:Hudson River School painters ","title":"William Trost Richards"},{"id":"2202556","text":"is a masculine Japanese given name. ==Orthography== Takeru can be written using different kanji characters and can mean: * Ê≠¶, \\"warrior\\" * Áåõ, \\"fierce\\" * ÂÅ•, \\"health\\" * Â∞ä, \\"noble\\" * Â≤≥, \\"mountain\\" The name can also be written in hiragana or katakana.

He then continued his studies for another year at the University of G√∂ttingen. Richard Courant, also studying there at the same time, tells a story of Helly disrupting one of Courant's talks, which fortunately did not prevent David Hilbert from eventually hiring Courant as an assistant.. After returning to Vienna, Helly worked as a tutor, Gymnasium teacher, and textbook editor until World War I, when he enlisted in the Austrian army. He was shot in 1915, and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner of the Russians. In one prison camp in Berezovka, Siberia, he organized a mathematical seminar in which Tibor Rad√≥, then an engineer, began his interest in pure mathematics.. While held in another camp at Nikolsk- Ussuriysk, also in Siberia, Helly wrote important contributions on functional analysis.. After a complicated return trip, Helly finally came back to Vienna in 1920, married his wife (mathematician Elise Bloch) in 1921, and also in 1921 earned his habilitation. Unable to obtain a paid position at the university because he was seen as too old and too Jewish, he worked at a bank until the financial collapse of 1929, and then for an insurance company. After the takeover of Austria by the Nazis in 1938, he lost that job as well, and escaped to America. With the assistance of Albert Einstein, he found teaching positions at Paterson Junior College and Monmouth Junior College in New Jersey,\\"Eduard Helly: The Most Famous Monmouth Professor You Have Never Heard About\\" before moving with his wife to Chicago in 1941, to work for the U.S. Army Signal Corps. In Chicago, he suffered two heart attacks, and died from the second one. ==Contributions== In the same 1912 paper in which he introduced Helly's selection theorem concerning the convergence of sequences of functions, Helly published a proof of a special case of the Hahn‚ÄìBanach theorem, 15 years before Hans Hahn and Stefan Banach discovered it independently.. Helly's proof only covers continuous functions over closed intervals of the real numbers; the more general theorem requires the ultrafilter lemma, a weakened variant of the axiom of choice, which had not yet been invented. Along with Hahn, Banach, and Norbert Wiener, Helly has subsequently been seen as one of the founders of the theory of normed vector spaces.. His most famous result, Helly's theorem on the intersection patterns of convex sets in Euclidean spaces, was published in 1923. The theorem states that, if F is a family of d-dimensional convex sets with the property that every d + 1 sets have a nonempty intersection, then the whole family has a nonempty intersection. Helly families, named after this theorem, are a set- theoretic generalization of this intersection property: they are the families of sets in which the minimal subfamilies with empty intersection consist of a bounded number of sets. ==Selected publications== *. *. ==References== Category:1884 births Category:1943 deaths Category:American people of Austrian-Jewish descent Category:Austrian mathematicians Category:Monmouth University faculty Category:20th-century mathematicians Category:Austro- Hungarian mathematicians ","title":"Eduard Helly"},{"id":"2202573","text":"Gaston Leval Gaston Leval (born Pierre Robert Piller; October 20, 1895 ‚Äì April 8, 1978) was an anarcho-syndicalist, combatant and historian of the Spanish Revolution.

Aerophagia may also refer to an unusual condition where the primary symptom is excessive flatus, belching is not present, and the actual mechanism by which air enters the gut is obscure. Aerophagia in psychiatry is sometimes attributed to nervousness or anxiety. ==Symptoms and signs== * Bloating * Chest tightness * Nausea * Shortness of breath * Belching * Heartburn * Abdominal pain * Satiety * Vomiting ==Causes== Aerophagia is associated with chewing gum, smoking, drinking carbonated drinks, eating too quickly, anxiety, high continuous positive airway pressure and wearing loose dentures and wearing masks. Aerophagia is also carried out deliberately to increase the length and volume of a belch, as any air successfully swallowed serves to increase the partial pressure in the stomach. In people with cervical spinal blockages, inhaling can cause air to enter the esophagus and stomach. ==Diagnosis== Aerophagia is diagnosed in 8.8% of cognitively delayed patients where the coordination between swallowing and respiration is not well defined. Aerophagia is a dangerous side effect of non-invasive ventilation (NIV), commonly used in treatments of respiratory problems and cardiovascular critical care or in surgery when a general anaesthetic is required. In the case of aerophagia during NIV, it is normally diagnosed by experienced medical specialists who check on patients intermittently during NIV use. The diagnosis is based on the sound heard by listening through a stethoscope placed outside the abdominal cavity. Using this approach, the problem is sometimes detected later than when it develops, possibly also later than necessary. Belated detection of aerophagia may lead to gastric distension, which in turn could elevate the diaphragm or cause aspiration of the stomach contents into the lungs or pneumatic rupture of the esophagus due to extreme gastric insufflation. == See also == * Gastric dilatation volvulus (GDV), stretched stomach ==References== ==External links== * Management of Belching, Hiccups, and Aerophagia * Aerophagia Symptoms and Treatment Category:Gastrointestinal tract disorders Category:Symptoms and signs: Digestive system and abdomen ","title":"Aerophagia"},{"id":"2202624","text":"Robert \\"Councillor\\" Carter III (February 28, 1728 - March 10, 1804) was a planter from the Northern Neck of Virginia, United States, who for two decades sat on the Virginia Governor's Council. After the American Revolutionary War, and influenced by Baptist, Quaker and Swedenborgian faith, Carter began what became the largest manumission and release of enslaved African Americans in North America 74 years prior to the start of the American Civil War. By a deed of gift filed with Northumberland County on September 5, 1791, and related documents filed in Westmoreland County in subsequent years, Carter began manumitting 500 slaves from his plantations in his lifetime. He also settled many of them on land he gave themLevy, 2005 ==Early life and career== Carter was the grandson of Virginia land baron Robert \\"King\\" Carter of Corotoman. In 1732, both his father and grandfather died, leaving the young boy in the care of his uncles George, Charles and Landon Carter, as well as his mother. She remarried in 1735 to John Lewis of Warner Hall in Gloucester County.warnerhall.comhttp://www.hmdb.org/Marker.asp?Marker=2963Levy, 2005, pp. 13-14 At age 9, young Robert was sent to the College of William and Mary, beginning with preparatory classes. In 1749 he came of age and received his inheritance.Sara Bearss (ed.) Dictionary of Virginia Biography (Richmond, 2006), vol 3, p. 87 After crossing the Atlantic Ocean to Liverpool with Lawrence Washington, Carter travelled to London, where he and Philip Ludwell Lee started legal studies at the Inner Temple. Carter returned to Virginia in 1751 where he was admitted to the bar. He took up residence at Nomony Hall. This was his preferred spelling for his inherited plantation on the Northern Neck. Nominy or Nomini are more commonly used today, as in the highway marker noting the plantation site.http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=22384, http://www.hmdb.org/Marker.asp?Marker=22361 He unsuccessfully campaigned at least twice for a seat in the House of Burgesses, but he did secure an appointment to the Westmoreland County Court in 1752.Levy, 2005, pp. 16-20 Carter left Virginia again in 1754, and married Frances Ann Tasker, daughter of former Maryland governor Benjamin Tasker. They ultimately had seventeen children, of which eight daughters and four sons reached adulthood.\\"Genealogy\\", Ben Lomond Manor House, accessed 30 Jan 2007\\"Robert 'King' Carter of Corotoman (1663‚Äì1732)\\", Historic Christ Church, accessed 30 Jan 2007 The successful marriage seemed to settle Carter, who began to pay attention to his vast landholdings, as well as politics. In 1758, using his in-laws' connections with the Board of Trade, Carter secured an appointment by King George II to the Virginia Governor's Council.Levy, 2005, p. 22 When George III succeeded his grandfather in 1760, Carter was reappointed to the post, which served as the colony's appellate court as well as advised on executive matters. He purchased a house in Williamsburg from his cousin Robert Carter Nicholas and moved his growing family there in 1761. Carter, began reading voraciously, as well as socializing with the city's top intellectuals, including Governor Fauquier, George Wythe, William Small, John Blair and young Thomas Jefferson a classmate of Carter‚Äôs.Levy, pp. 15, 23 ==Patriotism== At first loyal to his King, Carter expressed support for the Crown during the period of popular rejoicing that accompanied news of George III's repeal of the Stamp Act. But, Parliament passed additional laws obnoxious to colonial interests, and by 1772 the new Governor Dunmore exacerbated tensions. That year, Carter moved his ailing family (having lost three young daughters to unknown illnesses within 11 months)Levy, 2005, p. 37 back to Nomony Hall on the Northern Neck, announcing his retirement from public life. Carter never appeared in the Governor's Council minutes (other than as present) after it voted to allow slaveholders or local authorities to punish slaves without due process.Levy, 2005, pp. 40-41 Moreover, rather than educate his sons at the College of William and Mary, Carter hired Philip Fithian as tutor. Carter concentrated his efforts on trade, including ironworks, a textile factory, and a flour mill, in addition to draining swamps around Nomony and diversifying crops at all his plantations.Levy, 2005, pp. 46-47, 51-53 Although publicly neutral, Carter honored the continental boycott declared in 1774, and in 1775 joined Richard Corbin in expressing the council's concern about rumors of British marines being stationed at Williamsburg. Carter declined to give the loyalty assurances Dunmore required, and Dunmore dissolved the council in 1776. The following summer, Carter gave a loyalty oath to the new Commonwealth of Virginia. Although Carter declined political offices mentioned by Patriot friends, he began supplying provisions and bayonets to the American cause in the Revolution, so British ships raided his plantations near the Potomac river.Levy, 2005, p. 72-77http://ing d/nps- vip.net/history/BenLomond/history/carterchinnhistory.htm ==Slaveholding and spiritual seeking== Although his great-grandfather John Carter had freed slaves in his will (as well as provided homesteads and livestock for them),Levy, 2005, p. 27 the colony of Virginia made individual manumission illegal in the year Carter's father and grandfather died. It was not authorized again until 1783. King Carter had greatly expanded the institution of slavery in Virginia, by purchasing many from ships to work on his plantations. He owned more than a thousand slaves upon his death.http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C32obit.html King Carter gave his grandson Robert III his first slave (a girl) when the infant was three months old.Levy, 2005, p. 10 By the time he came of legal age in 1749, Robert Carter III owned of land and 100 slaves.Levy, 2005, p. 15 Although Carter sold land and some slaves to pay his debts in 1758,Levy, 2005, p. 23 he did not purchase more slaves (unlike George Washington and other neighbors). He became known among his neighbors for his humane treatment of the enslaved workers in this region.Fithian p. 38. available at https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40044 Carter rarely whipped slaves, or allowed them to be whipped, let alone scarred them, although he whipped his own children, particularly his eldest son Robert Bladen.Levy, 2005, pp. 53, 61 Carter's plantations had roughly double the rate of slave population increase as others in the state.Levy, 2005, p. 62 Carter was particularly moved by the example of Governor Fauquier, who in his will allowed his slaves to choose their masters.Levy, 2005, pp. 29-32 When Carter became a co-administrator of his father-in-law's estate, he (with the support of Daniel Dulany) delayed scheduling a sale of the slaves of Bel-Air plantation, since that would break up families. But his delays led to more than 18 years of litigation with his Tasker in-laws.Levy, 2005, pp. 29-31 ===Conversion=== Carter became known for his religious freethinking and support of dissenters even before the Revolution. He resigned from the Cople Parish Church vestry in 1776.Levy, 2005, p. 70. During the following year he had a mystical experience while feverish from a smallpox inoculation.Levy, 2005, p. 80. This prompted further spiritual seeking, from composing his own prayer for God to \\"have pity upon all Jews, Turks, Infidels & Hereticks\\", to making trips to attend services and hear from Quaker, Methodist, Presbyterian and Baptist preachers (all classified as dissenters), and investigating Arminianism and perhaps Catholicism (although these pursuits were illegal in Virginia at the time, where the Anglican Church was the state established church).Levy, 2005, pp. 81-89. On September 6, 1778, the Rev. Lewis Lunsfordhttp://www.fbinstitute.com/baptist-in-america/benedict36.htm baptised Carter by immersion in Totuskey Creek. Carter scandalized neighbors further by joining Morattico Baptist Church, which had a mixed congregation of white and black, free and slave.http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=24477&Result;=1 In this period, most elite planters still belonged to the Anglican Church. Carter knew he risked persecution, for Eleazar Clay, another wealthy man, had his life threatened after such conversion. During the three weeks preceding his own baptism, Carter attended two different services that were attacked by armed mobs that included Revolutionary War veterans.Levy, 2005, pp.91-93. His wife Frances Ann Tasker Carter, who was declared an invalid in October 1779 after the birth of their 16th child,Levy, 2005, p. 92. moved to Bladensburg, Maryland for health reasons.Levy, 2005, p. 106. She converted to the Baptist faith there a year before her death in 1787.Levy, 2005, pp. 127-128.

However, his eldest son, Robert Bladen (although an admirer of the poet Phyllis Wheatley), at least twice sold young female slaves against his father's wishes. He also gambled and incurred such large debts that when Robert Bladen fled to England in 1783, his father was compelled to liquidate not only lands, but also slaves and thus break up families, in order to pay off his son's debts.Levy, 2005, pp. 113-114. In 1785 his son-in-law John Peck sold slaves whom Carter had given to his daughter Anne Tasker Carter as a dowry before the couple married and moved northward.Levy, 2005, p. 125. Carter gave his remaining daughters dowries that did not include human property. In February 1786, Carter decided to send his youngest sons George and John Tasker Carter to the new Baptist university in Rhode Island (what is now Brown University). He wrote to its minister president James Manning: > I beg leave to appoint you their Foster Father intimating that my desire is > that both my Said Sons shd. be active Characters in Life ... The prevailing > Notion now is to Continue the most abject State of Slavery in this Common- > Wealth ‚Äì On this Consideration only, I do not intend that these my two Sons > shall return to this State till each of them arrive to the Age of 21 years. In November 1788, Carter sent three daughters to live with Baptist friends in Baltimore, instructing their hosts \\"Girls are not to act by a Maid, but by themselves.\\" But he also sent a slave as barter for their room and board.Levy, 2005, p. 126. During the 1780s, the Baptist Church began to segregate its meetings. After the Ketocton Association passed a motion that hereditary slavery was \\"contrary to the word of God,\\" and Morattico Baptist Church changed its rule to allow only free male members to vote on church issues, tumult rocked the General Committee.Levy, 2005, p. 122. Carter's wife had died and the grieving widower responded to the changes by drafting a charter for Yeocomico Church that required egalitarian voting. He left Morattico for the splinter congregation, signing its charter below the signatures of several slaves.Levy, 2005, pp. 129-130 Carter unsuccessfully ran for a position in the Virginia Ratification Convention. While struggling with several bouts of illness, he was cared for by his daughter Sarah Fairfax Carter. He postponed her proposed marriage to Richard Bland Lee, perhaps because of the suitor's pro-slavery ideas.Levy, 2005, p. 137. Carter continued to host spiritual seekers, including a \\"Mr. Moyce,\\" who in January 1788 introduced him to the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg, a Scandinavian aristocrat, scientist and mystic who had developed followers in London. Carter began to request copies of his writings from business correspondents.Levy, 2005, pp. 129, 140-43. In December 1789, Carter believed he \\"died\\", perhaps another religious experience tinged by illness.Levy, 2005, pp. 131-132. In 1790, Carter wrote British Baptist elder John Rippon, \\"the toleration of slavery indicates very great depravity of mind.\\" He also criticized ministers who offered universal redemption, but only \\"partial Election before Creation\\".Levy, 2005, p. 135 In the nineteenth century, as the Baptist Church became more accommodating of slavery, it began to grow in the number of members. In 1790 it claimed 20,000 members in Virginia; a decade later, well after the disestablishment of the Anglican Church, it had become Virginia's second largest sect. Levy, 2005, p. 132 ==Manumission== In the years after the Revolutionary War, Virginia's legislature (having barred the slave trade in 1778) passed several laws sympathetic to freeing slaves, although it did not pass a law legalizing manumission until 1782, and throttled many petitions for wider emancipation.Levy, 2005, pp. 108, 119 Numerous slaveholders in the Chesapeake Bay area freed their slaves, often in their wills (like Quaker John Pleasants) or deeds, and noted principles of equality and Revolutionary ideals as reason for their decisions. The number of free African Americans increased in the Upper South from less than one percent before the Revolution, to 10 percent by 1810. In Delaware, three-fourths of the slaves had been freed by 1810.Peter Kolchin, American Slavery: 1619‚Äì1877, New York: Hill and Wang, 1994, . p.78, 81 In the decade after the act's passage, Virginians had freed 10,000 slaves, without visible social disruptions. The price of slaves reached a 20-year low as the percentage listed as \\"black, tithable\\" (i.e. slaves) fell below 40%, the lowest point in the century. However, Virginia's courts sidestepped issuing appellate decisions ratifying emancipation until 1799,http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=9604 and the methodology of within- life emancipation was not established. Carter hoped Virginia's legislature would pass a gradual emancipation plan, as did New York and New Jersey.Levy, 2005, p. 138 His neighbor Ferdinando Fairfax published one such plan in a Philadelphia-based journal, and Quaker Warner Mifflin presented petitions to Congress to do the same, but James Madison buried the proposals in committee.Levy, 2005, pp. 138-139 In early 1791, Carter refused to rent a plantation to Charles Mynn Thruston, a Revolutionary veteran and Anglican minister, with whose racial views he disagreed.Levy, 2005, p. 151 His Baptist friend John Leland left Virginia after a final anti-slavery sermon, which Carter copied in full into his journal.Levy, 2005, p. 156 Carter nonetheless began a personal program of gradual manumission of slaves on his many plantations. He announced his plan on August 1, 1791, and began a new legal process by recording a Deed of Gift in Northumberland County on September 5, 1791.http://nominihallslavelegacy.com/the-deed-of- gifthttp://wthrockmorton.com/tag/robert-carter/ Since the manumission law required a five shilling fee, and Carter had plantations and slaves in several Virginia counties, he corresponded with the Westmoreland County clerk (where he resided) and followed up by filing manumission papers at the Westmoreland County court sessions the following February, May, July and August. His actions were resisted by his son-in-law John Peck, and various overseers and white tenants of his estates.Levy, 2005, pp. 146-150 Carter designed the gradual program to reduce the opposition of slave-owning white neighbors, but he failed to gain their support. He refused tenants' requests to relocate slave breeding women in order to circumvent the Deed of Gift. That winter Carter was shunned, although he sought help from fellow slavery opponents, including George Mason (who declined to help and cited his own age and infirmity).Robert Rutland, ed., The Papers of George Mason (University of North Carolina Press, 1970) (vol. III) at pp. 1232-1235 By the filings of February 27, 1793, Carter was ahead of his own planned schedule. Moreover, he refused to relocate freed blacks, and began offering them wages to work for him. He also offered some grants and tenancies, sometimes dispossessing obstreperous white tenants.Levy, 2005, at pp. 150-151 Carter began investigating relocating to the District of Columbia. He leased Nomony plantation and its servants to his son J.T. on April 26, 1793 (expressly conditional to the Deed of Gift). Then, before the next Westmoreland court session, perhaps victimized by mob action such as tar-and-feathers, Carter and his daughters fled by ship with Negro George and Negro Betty to Baltimore (on May 8, 1793).Levy, 2005, p. 152-154 He never returned, despite numerous entreaties from family and friends. The meetinghouse used by the Yeocomico Baptist Church burned down six months after Carter left; Carter saved an unsigned complaining letter (which he believed from Thruston) that compared the Deed of Gift to fire destroying neighbors' houses.Levy, 2005, p. 155 ==Later life and death== Upon reaching Baltimore, Carter was told that his son Robert Bladen Carter had died in London, nine days after being assaulted by a city sheriff trying to collect gambling debts. Carter joined the congregation of James Jones Wilmer, an Episcopalian priest receptive to Swedenborg's views, bought a small house on Green Street, and began attending many religious meetings.Levy, 2005, p. 153 Before leaving Nomony Hall, Carter locked his books and papers in the library, and gave the only key not to his son J.T., but to a wandering Baptist preacher named Benjamin Dawson. Dawson proved a corrupt debt collector, but a diligent abolitionist, duly securing legal papers from Carter in Baltimore and filing them in Westmoreland and other counties to free slaves.Levy, 2005, pp. 156-159 Carter made provision for his relatives, allocating them land, but not the slaves who were the subject of the Deed of Gift. On July 26, 1797, upon learning from Dawson that attorney John Wickham doubted the legal validity of the power of attorney which allowed Dawson to file further manumission papers, Carter executed an agreement selling Dawson his remaining slaves for the nominal sum of a dollar. Dawson duly filed this with the Westmoreland clerk, despite suffering a beating by Carter's son-in-law Spencer Ball.Levy, 2005, pp. 159-160 Carter spent the last decade of his life issuing manumission papers pursuant to his recorded program, writing letters in support of freed slaves whose papers had been stolen, and contemplating religious and political issues.Levy pp. 160-161, 164-166 Carter lent money to Baltimore to build its city hall, negotiated with the Bank of the United States, and donated money to refugees from Saint Domingue, who fled the Haitian Revolution].Levy, 2005, p. 172 Carter thought he had lived too long‚Äîmourning his daughter Anne's death in childbirth in 1798, and the deaths of Rev. Lunsford and his son-in-law John Maund in Caroline County, Virginia the following year.Levy, 2005, pp. 164, 184 In 1803, the year before his death, Carter wrote his daughter Harriet L. Maund, \\"My plans and advice have never been pleasing to the world.\\"citation needed Citizen Robert Carter (as he preferred to be called) died in his sleep, unexpectedly, on March 10, 1804. His son and executor, George, brought the body back to Nomony and buried his father in the garden. The same day that George announced his father's death, he bought slaves for Nomony, in order to replace those his father had freed over his objection.Levy, 2005, p. 167 On April 3, 1805, Rev. Thruston, acting as judge of Frederick County, Virginia, refused to allow Dawson to record the scheduled deed for emancipation for that year, perhaps because of George Carter's objection. But on March 24, 1808, the Virginia Court of Appeals upheld Dawson's objection, declared the county court had erred, and authorized liberation of the slaves illegally held in bondage.Levy, 2005, p. 169 citing Henning and Mumford, Reports of Cases Argued and Determined in the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia (Philadelphia 1808-1811) 2:134, 138 Dawson continued to free sons and daughters born to Carter's slaves after 1791, as did Thomas Buck and John Rust after 1826.Levy, 2005, p. 169 ==See also== * Robert Carter I * Carter's Grove * Slavery in the United States * George Wythe == References == ==Works cited== * * Baptists in America in A General History of the Baptist Denomination in America, and Other Parts of the World. ==External links== * Robert Carter III at Encyclopedia Virginia * Report of the Brown University Steering Committee on Slavery and Justice * Nomini Hall Slave Legacy Project:Chronicling the Descendants of the Slaves freed by Robert Carter III at Nomini Hall * Guide to the Robert Carter letter books and day books, 1771-1804 and undated, Duke University Category:1728 births Category:1804 deaths Category:American people of English descent Category:American planters Category:American Swedenborgians Robert III Category:College of William & Mary alumni Category:Politicians from Baltimore Category:People from Westmoreland County, Virginia Category:People of Virginia in the American Revolution Category:Virginia Governor's Council members Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:History of slavery in Virginia Category:American slave owners ","title":"Robert Carter III"},{"id":"2202628","text":"Munroe Tavern, located at 1332 Massachusetts Avenue, Lexington, Massachusetts, is an American Revolutionary War site that played a prominent role in the Battle of Lexington and Concord. It is now preserved and operated as a museum by the Lexington Historical Society, with exhibits highlighting the role and perspective of the British soldiers during the outbreak of the war. The house is open for guided tours on weekends starting in April and daily from Memorial Day weekend until the end of October. The Munroe family line in America was begun by William Munroe (1625‚Äì1719), who was transported to New England in 1651 following his capture at the Battle of Worcester. The earliest part of the Tavern was constructed in 1735 on land then owned by David Comee.http://www.lexingtonhistory.org/uploads/6/5/2/1/6521332/munroehsrjan2010_web.pdf Later the proprietor rights were given to others., Internet Archive Retrieved 2011-09-20 Another William Munroe (1742‚Äì1827), the great-grandson of the original William,, Internet Archive Retrieved 2011-09-20 purchased the house in 1770, and in October 1774 was granted a taverner's license from the town, shortly before the outbreak of hostilities in April 1775. On April 18, 1775, one day before the outbreak of the battle, Munroe Tavern was a meeting spot for colonials, owned by William Munroe, orderly sergeant of Captain John Parker's militia company, and proprietor of the tavern until 1827. At 6:30 p.m. that evening, Solomon Brown of Lexington, who had gone to the market in Boston, returned and reported to Munroe that he had passed a patrol of British soldiers.David Hackett Fischer, \\"Paul Revere's Ride\\" The building's western elevation A large force of British troops arrived at Lexington before dawn the next morning, and shots were exchanged on the town common, beginning the Battles of Lexington and Concord. That afternoon the tavern served as the headquarters for Col. Hugh, Earl Percy, and his one thousand reinforcements. The British occupied the tavern for one and one-half hours, during which time the dining room was converted into a field hospital for the wounded, while exhausted British soldiers consumed liberal quantities of food and drink. The troops also shot down John Raymond, an infirm man residing in the family. President George Washington dined at the Munroe Tavern when he visited the Lexington battlefield in 1789. An upstairs room now contains the table at which he sat and documents relating to his trip. In the late 19th century, a Munroe descendant who owned the house rented out part of it to artist Edwin Graves Champney (1842‚Äì1899). The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The Lexington Historical Society now employs the Tavern for the Museum of the British Redcoats, providing a view of April 19, 1775 from the perspective of the King's troops.

This includes ascariasis, pinworm disease, hookworm infections, guinea worm infections, hydatid disease, and giardia, among others. It is taken by mouth. Mebendazole is usually well tolerated. Common side effects include headache, vomiting, and ringing in the ears. If used at large doses it may cause bone marrow suppression. It is unclear if it is safe in pregnancy. Mebendazole is a broad-spectrum antihelminthic agent of the benzimidazole type. Mebendazole came into use in 1971, after it was developed by Janssen Pharmaceutica in Belgium. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Mebendazole is available as a generic medication. ==Medical use== Mebendazole is a highly effective, broad-spectrum antihelmintic indicated for the treatment of nematode infestations, including roundworm, hookworm, whipworm, threadworm, pinworm, and the intestinal form of trichinosis prior to its spread into the tissues beyond the digestive tract. Other drugs are used to treat worm infections outside the digestive tract, as mebendazole is poorly absorbed into the bloodstream.Petri WA in Brunton LL, Chabner BA, Knollmann BC, Ed. Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 12th ed., Chapter 42. McGraw-Hill, 2011 New York. Mebendazole is used alone in those with mild to moderate infestations. It kills parasites relatively slowly, and in those with very heavy infestations, it can cause some parasites to migrate out of the digestive system, leading to appendicitis, bile duct problems, or intestinal perforation. To avoid this, heavily infested patients may be treated with piperazine, either before or instead of mebendazole. Piperazine paralyses the parasites, causing them to pass in the feces.Martin AR in Wilson and Gisvold's Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, 8th edition, Doerge RF, ed. J.B. Lippincott, 1982, Chapter 4 It is also used rarely in the treatment of cystic echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease. Evidence for effectiveness for this disease, however, is poor. Mebendazole and other benzimidazole antithelmetics are active against both larval and adult stages of nematodes, and in the cases of roundworm and whipworm, kill the eggs, as well. Paralysis and death of the parasites occurs slowly, and elimination in the feces may require several days. ===Special populations=== Mebendazole has been shown to cause ill effects in pregnancy in animal models, and no adequate studies of its effects in human pregnancy have been conducted. Whether it can be passed by breastfeeding is unknown.Finberg R, Fingeroth J in Longo DL, Fauci AS, Kasper DL, Hauser SL, Jameson JL, Loscalzo, Ed. Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 18th ed., McGraw-Hill, 2012, Chapter 217. ==Adverse effects== Mebendazole sometimes causes diarrhea, abdominal pain, and elevated liver enzymes. In rare cases, it has been associated with a dangerously low white blood cell count, low platelet count, and hair loss, with a risk of agranulocytosis in rare cases. ===Drug interactions=== Carbamazepine and phenytoin lower serum levels of mebendazole. Cimetidine does not appreciably raise serum mebendazole (in contrast to the similar drug albendazole), consistent with its poor systemic absorption. Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome and the more severe toxic epidermal necrolysis can occur when mebendazole is combined with high doses of metronidazole. ==Mechanism== Mebendazole works by selectively inhibiting the synthesis of microtubules via binding to colchicine binding site of Œ≤-tubulin, thereby blocking polymerisation of tubulin dimers in intestinal cells of parasites. Disruption of cytoplasmic microtubules leads to blocking the uptake of glucose and other nutrients, resulting in the gradual immobilization and eventual death of the helminths. Poor absorption in digestive tract makes mebendazole an efficient drug for treating intestinal parasitic infections with limited adverse effects. However mebendazole has impact on mammalian cells mostly by inhibiting polymeration of tubulin dimers, thereby disrupting essential microtubule structures such as mitotic spindle. Disassembly of mitotic spindle then leads to apoptosis mediated via dephosphorylation of Bcl-2 which allows pro-apoptotic protein Bax to dimerize and initiate programmed cell death. ==Society and culture Availability === Mebendazole is available as a generic medication. Mebendazole is distributed in international markets by Johnson and Johnson and a number of generic manufacturers. ===Cost=== In the United States a single dose was about US$18.00 in 2015. In 2016 the price increased to US$440.00 per dose in the U.S. as Amedra Pharmaceuticals acquired the rights from Teva in 2013. In 2010, Amedra also bought the U.S. marketing rights to the only other interchangeable anti-parasitic medication, albendazole, from GSK. The result of these acquisitions created a monopoly on these medications and the price increased dramatically. In 2015 Amedra Pharmaceuticals became a subsidiary of Amneal Pharmaceuticals. In Australia 6 x 100mg costs approximately US$9 while in the UK this would cost around US$19. ==Research== Several studies show mebendazole exhibits potent antitumor properties. MBZ significantly inhibited cancer cell growth, migration, and metastatic formation of adrenocortical carcinoma, both in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of lung cancer cell lines with MBZ caused mitotic arrest, followed by apoptotic cell death with the feature of caspase activation and cytochrome c release. MBZ induced a dose- and time-dependent apoptotic response in human lung cancer cell lines, and apoptosis via Bcl-2 inactivation in chemoresistant melanoma cells. The anti-cancer effect of mebendazole comes from preclinical studies and case reports. == References == == External links == * Category:Anthelmintics Category:Aromatic ketones Category:Belgian inventions Category:Benzimidazoles Category:Carbamates Category:Embryotoxicants Category:Johnson & Johnson brands Category:Janssen Pharmaceutica Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate Category:Teratogens Category:World Health Organization essential medicines ","title":"Mebendazole"},{"id":"2202636","text":"Sir Lloyd George Geering (born 26 February 1918) is a New Zealand theologian who faced charges of heresy in 1967 for his controversial views. He considers Christian and Muslim fundamentalism to be \\"social evils\\". Geering is Emeritus Professor of Religious Studies at Victoria University of Wellington. He turned 100 in February 2018. ==Biography== Geering was born in Rangiora, Canterbury, New Zealand, and \\"embraced\\" the Christian tradition in 1937.Morris and Grimshaw, 2008. Page 277 He holds a master's degree in mathematics and a Doctor of Divinity from the University of Otago. He was ordained as a minister of the Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand (PCANZ) in 1943 and practised as a minister in Kurow; Opoho, Dunedin (1945-1950); and St James, Wellington (1950-1956) before turning to theological teaching. He was the Honorary Associate Minister of St John‚Äôs Church in Wellington from 1971 to 1983. He was named Honorary Assistant at St Andrew‚Äôs in Wellington in 1989. Geering remains on the Register (Fasti) of New Zealand Presbyterian Ministers. Geering has held the positions of Professor of Old Testament Studies Presbyterian Church Hall Brisbane Queensland, Australia (1956-1960, Professor of Old Testament Studies Theological Hall Dunedin (29 February 1960 - December 1963), and Principal of Theological Hall Dunedin (12 December 1963 - 31 May 1971). In 1971, Geering became the Foundation Professor of Religious Studies at Victoria University of Wellington and held this position until his retirement in 1984 when he was appointed Professor Emeritus. In 1983 he became a Lecturer at the St Andrew‚Äôs Trust for the Study of Religion and Society. In 1967 Geering gained a high profile when he was charged with \\"doctrinal error\\" and \\"disturbing the peace and unity of the (Presbyterian) church\\".Lloyd Geering speaking at Pitt Street Uniting Church, Sydney, in October 2004: \\"In 1967, Lloyd Geering's writings on the resurrection of Jesus and the immortality of the soul, resulted in his being charged by the Presbyterian Church with \\"doctrinal error\\" and \\"disturbing the peace of the church\\" ‚Äì which is more or less the same thing as a heresy charge ‚Äì and we'll shortly be hearing about what happened there. Since then, he's gone on to challenge Christian orthodoxy perhaps even more profoundly, by questioning the distinction between the religious and the secular worlds.\\" The case was brought before the 1967 General Assembly of the PCANZ, and dismissed without being much discussed.Geering says: \\"But before there had been very much time for any adequate discussion of the real issues, a motion was put to the House, and later carried firmly on the voices ‚Äì and it said that ‚Äúthe Assembly judges that no doctrinal error has been established, dismisses the charges and declares the case closed‚Äù\\". Lloyd Geering speaking at Pitt Street Uniting Church, Sydney, in October 2004 The charges were brought by a group of conservative laymen and a conservative minister. During his church trial, he claimed that the remains of Jesus lay somewhere in Palestine and that the resurrection had been wrongfully interpreted by churches as a resuscitation of the body of Jesus. He also rejects the notion that God is a supernatural being who created and continues to look over the world.The Last Western Heretic, produced in 2007 in New Zealand and Israel, aired on TV ONE, 12 January 2008 (Press release) Geering is a member of the Jesus Seminar and a participant in the Living the Questions program, an alternative to the evangelical Alpha course, which he views as dangerous indoctrination sadly growing among even mainstream churches. He is also a member of the Sea of Faith Network (New Zealand), and St Andrew's On The Terrace as well as Principal Lecturer at St Andrew's Trust for the Study of Religion and Society In the 1988 New Year Honours, Geering was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and in the 2001 New Year Honours he was made a Principal Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to religious studies. In the 2007 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Member of the Order of New Zealand. In 2009, he accepted redesignation as a Knight Grand Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, following the restoration of titular honours by the New Zealand government.

INSA Rennes was founded in 1966 to train highly qualified engineers, support continuing education, and conduct research and testing. The five-year curriculum aims at training engineers who possess humane qualities and are well versed in the primary areas of science and engineering. The school accommodates 1,400 students in engineering. The education is divided into two parts: * the first cycle, which is a highly selective part of the studies and which aims at giving the basis for future engineering studies, * the second cycle, for which the students have the choice of 7 specialties. The future engineer chooses here a specialisation, and have then the possibility to pursue a PhD. Some special sections are available: * Sports-with-studies combining a good level of education in sport and science, * Music-with-Studies * Theatre-with-Studies * Art-with-studies The university is located on a campus called Beaulieu in the east of Rennes. ==First cycle== Entrance building of the school The five year academic curriculum starts with a foundation course (preparatory cycle) where students focus on fundamental sciences (maths, physics, chemistry, mechanics and computer sciences) and then progressively concentrate on specialized areas in science and technology. This generalist preparatory cycle ensures that all INSA engineers acquire a solid background in terms of skills and competence, thus allowing them to reorient their career independently of their initial specialization. The first cycle is the highly selective part of the studies. During the first year the examinations are very hard to test if students are able to continue with their engineering studies. * ASINSA-EURINSA: INSA Rennes proposes special international sections for its students.

The first Georgie Pie restaurant opened in 1977, and at its peak there were 32 restaurants across New Zealand. After running into financial difficulties, it was bought out by McDonald's in 1996, mainly for its restaurant locations. The last Georgie Pie store was closed in 1998. Large pies at Georgie Pie came in a range of traditional (mince and cheese/steak and kidney) and international (Chinese/Mexican/Italian) flavours. In 2013, following frequent calls for the brand's return, McDonald's reintroduced Georgie Pie through its restaurants. However, there are no plans to open dedicated Georgie Pie stores. ==History== Georgie Pie was the brainchild of Tom Ah Chee, who opened New Zealand's first supermarket (Foodtown Otahuhu, 1958). The first restaurant was opened in Kelston, Auckland in 1977. In 1994, plans were announced to open 25 new outlets per year, with a goal of 114 operating restaurants by the end of 1998. The chain came to prominence in the early 1990s with its $1, $2, $3, and $4 \\"Funtastic Value\\" menu. At its peak, the chain employed about 1,300 people. Georgie Pie was able to automate the food production process far more than chains which sold labour-intensive items such as burgers. Timing was a more difficult detail, for Georgie Pie, as it took 22 minutes to bake a pie versus a few minutes for typical fast food. == Closure == Following the decision not to continue expansion of the brand, inquiries (by members of the Georgie Pie management team and other outside interested parties) into buying the brand were declined. Progressive Enterprises sold the food chain to McDonald's in 1996, Workers at Georgie Pie were shocked by the decision to close, as expansion plans, customer loyalty and sales figures indicated business was booming. There was speculation that Progressive received a massive buyout offer from McDonalds that shareholders felt was too good to turn down - and rather than face a PR backlash, workers and the public were \\"fed\\" a lie. who mainly bought the chain for its property, which included high-profile sites such as the corner of Great South Road and Green Lane East in Auckland. It also gave McDonald's a leg-up over arch-rival Burger King, who entered the New Zealand market in 1994 and were also actively interested in purchasing the Georgie Pie chain. At the conclusion of the deal, 17 outlets were converted into McDonald's restaurants. The other fifteen were sold, some to other fast food franchises or restaurants, one to a Bunnings Warehouse and one to a blood bank. The last Georgie Pie was located at Kepa Road in Auckland's Mission Bay where they ceased operations in 1998. The Foodtown/Countdown house brand \\"Foodtown\\" pies, which tasted nearly the same as Georgie Pies, were withdrawn in late 2004. During the course of its twenty-one years in business, Georgie Pie achieved a number of firsts in New Zealand: first drive-thru and first with breakfast; first 24-hour drive-thru; and the first domestic concept to seriously challenge the international fast food giants. == Resurgence in popularity == New Zealand Broadcasting School students Drig Chappells and Gareth Thorne started a Facebook group calling for the return of Georgie Pie. In September 2008, as part of a documentary known as \\"Bring Back the George\\", they temporarily converted a Christchurch bakery into the restaurant and sold pies made with the same recipe as the originals. All of their pies were sold in less than an hour, with people coming from as far as Auckland to get one. \\"Bring Back Georgie Pie\\" badges and T-shirts were available from a Wellington- based \\"Kiwiana\\" retailer until McDonald's identified intellectual property concerns and requested that their manufacture cease. A shop selling pies by the name \\"GP Pies\\" also opened in Kelston, West Auckland. McDonald's announced they were looking into possible copyright infringement of the name. They also announced they were looking into relaunching the Georgie Pie brand, not as a stand-alone shop, but possibly inside McDonald's outlets as a McCafe offering. In May 2009, July 2011, and April 2012, media reports indicated that McDonald's New Zealand (the current trademark holder) were investigating a reopening of the brand. Nationwide radio station ZM even offered McDonald's $50,000 worth of free advertising if the stores were to reopen before the end of 2009. Occasionally, genuine Georgie Pies came onto the market, usually through New Zealand auction site TradeMe. ==Relaunch== On 9 May 2013, McDonald's announced the return of Georgie Pie on a trial basis. From 5 June 2013, the original recipe Steak Mince 'n' Cheese pie (minus the monosodium glutamate) has been sold for $4.50 at the Queen Street and Greenlane McDonald's restaurants (the latter being a former Georgie Pie restaurant) in Auckland. The trial was quickly expanded to five more McDonald's restaurants in Auckland (including at Kelston, the location of the original Georgie Pie restaurant), three restaurants in Hamilton, and the Te Awamutu restaurant. The relaunch proved so popular that special queues and security staff were brought in to handle the crowds. At times, the lines went out of the restaurant and stretched across the car park. In July 2013, the trial was expanded to four more Auckland restaurants, as well as two restaurants in Palmerston North, and restaurants in Feilding and Bulls. On 1 October 2013, McDonald's announced that the trial exceeded its expectations, and it would subsequently expand Georgie Pie to 107 of its 161 restaurants nationwide by the end of 2013 and introduce two new flavours of pie in early 2014. It was expected that by mid-2014 all McDonald's restaurants in New Zealand, except those which cannot accommodate the pie ovens, would be selling Georgie Pie. McDonald's New Zealand had a 5.8 percent gain in sales in 2013, which has been largely attributed to the re-introduction of Georgie Pie. On 5 March 2014, the Chicken 'n' Vegetable pie was re-introduced to the menu. ==References== ==External links== * Article on the recent movement to 'Bring Back Georgie Pie' Category:McDonald's Category:Woolworths Group (Australia) Category:Restaurants established in 1977 Category:Restaurants disestablished in 1998 Category:Defunct restaurants Category:Fast-food chains of New Zealand Category:Defunct companies of New Zealand ","title":"Georgie Pie"},{"id":"2202679","text":"The Rocco A. Abessinio Building Neumann University is a private Roman Catholic liberal arts college in Aston, Pennsylvania. It is sponsored by the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia. ==History== The roots of Neumann University began in 1855 when Bishop (later Saint) John Neumann approved the request of Anna Maria Boll Bachmann to start a religious community of Franciscan Sisters in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Over the course of the next century, the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia grew to the point where they needed a college to assist in their mission of educating and caring for the people in south eastern Pennsylvania and beyond. Neumann University was founded as Our Lady of Angels College with 115 female students in 1965 by the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia. The name was changed to Neumann College in 1980 in honor of Saint John Neumann, a former Bishop of Philadelphia.History, Neumann University; updated February 10, 2014. Neumann admitted its first male undergraduate students in 1980. The college was granted approval to offer its first doctoral program (the Doctorate in Physical Therapy) in 2004, and its second doctoral program (an Ed.D. in educational leadership) in 2005. Neumann achieved \\"university status\\" from the Pennsylvania Department of Education in 2009. ==Academics== Neumann University is made up of five academic divisions: the Division of Arts and Sciences, the Division of Business and Information Management, the Division of Nursing and Health Sciences, the Division of Education and Human Services, and the Division of Continuing Adult and Professional Studies. As of the fall of 2017, the university has a total enrollment of 2,715; in fall 2016, the university had a total enrollment of 3,011. In academic year 2015-16, the university conferred 676 academic degrees: five associate degrees (1%); 524 bachelor's degrees (78%); 113 master's degrees (17%); and 34 doctorates (5%). Total tuition, fees, room, and board for a full-time undergraduate student in 2016-17 were $40,738. As of spring 2016, some 57% of undergraduates were Roman Catholic. Over the course of the last three years and building upon their large undergraduate program in Nursing, Neumann University has been expanding into the health care field by introducing new concentrations such as pre-Physical Therapy, pre-Occupational Therapy, pre-Athletic Training as well as introducing a new Health Sciences Major with tracks in exercise physiology and strength and conditioning. All of these new concentrations will be housed in Neumann's new Health Science Center which is expected to be completed in the fall of 2018. The Health Science Center will contain a state of the art undergraduate nursing teaching auditorium that seats close to 300 students. About 49% of undergraduate students are white, 31% are black, and 9% are Hispanic. Some 65% of undergraduates are female, and 35% are male. As of fall 2017, about 60% of undergraduates were from Pennsylvania, 16% were from New Jersey, and 18% were from Delaware. ==Athletics== Neumann University is a member of the Atlantic East Conference as well as the United Collegiate Hockey Conference (UCHC). It competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), Division III. In 2009 Neumann University's men's ice hockey team won the NCAA Division III National Championship.

A small-sized plimsoll with a tartan design, using a CVO (Circular Vamp Oxford) design/style. A plimsoll shoe, plimsoll, plimsole, daps or pumps (British English; see other names below) is a type of athletic shoe with a canvas upper and rubber sole developed as beachwear in the 1830s by the Liverpool Rubber Company. Plimsolls have solid rubber soles about 8 or 9 mm thick, to which the canvas is glued without coming up the sides (as on trainers). The effect when running is similar to running without shoes. The shoe was originally, and often still is in parts of the United Kingdom, called a \\"sand shoe\\" and acquired the nickname \\"plimsoll\\" in the 1870s. This name arose, according to Nicholette Jones's book The Plimsoll Sensation, because the coloured horizontal band joining the upper to the sole resembled the Plimsoll line on a ship's hull, or because, just like the Plimsoll line on a ship, if water got above the line of the rubber sole, the wearer would get wet. In the UK plimsolls are commonly worn for schools' indoor physical education lessons. Regional terms are common: around their area of origin, (Liverpool, in north west England) they are often referred to as 'Galoshes'. In Northern Ireland and central Scotland they are sometimes known as gutties; \\"sannies\\" (from 'sand shoe') is also used in Scotland. In parts of the West Country and Wales they are known as \\"daps\\" or \\"dappers\\". In London, the home counties, much of the West Midlands, the West Riding of Yorkshire and north west of England they are known as \\"pumps\\". There is a widespread belief that \\"daps\\" is taken from a factory sign ‚Äì \\"Dunlop Athletic Plimsoles\\" which was called \\"the DAP factory\\". However, this seems unlikely as the first citation in the Oxford English Dictionary of \\"dap\\" for a rubber soled shoe is a March 1924 use in the Western Daily Press newspaper; Dunlop did not acquire the Liverpool Rubber Company (as part of the merger with the Macintosh group of companies) until 1925. Plimsolls were issued to the British military (called 'road slappers' by the common soldiery) until replaced by trainers in the mid-80s. If white they required hours of application of shoe whitener, if black they were required to be polished until they gleamed. As it was commonly used for corporal punishment in the British Commonwealth, where it was the typical gym shoe (part of the school uniform), plimsolling is also a synonym for a slippering. Converse All-Star canvas basketball shoes. ==Outside the United Kingdom== Plimsolls are referred to as: * Australia ‚Äì sandshoe, sneakers or runners, and include the similar shoe, the Dunlop Volley * Canada ‚Äì also called running shoes, or runners * India ‚Äì white plimsolls are often worn by school children and are known as Keds dating from the 1970s and earlier, and more commonly, as \\"canvas shoes\\".

Amongst their artists were Richard Pryor, Redd Foxx, LaWanda Page, George Carlin, black ventriloquist duo Richard And Willie, Kip Addotta, Belle Barth, Rex Benson, and Skillet & Leroy. Releases on Laff were notorious for their raunchy content on both the record and its album jacket. Many of these titles have had to be denoted with an \\"Adults Only\\" warning on the front cover and sold under the counter, decades before the infamous Parental Advisory sticker was a fixture on album covers. Many Laff album covers featured topless models. Laff also became notorious both for the questionable quality of its record pressings and for its frequent repackaging of previously released titles with new titles and artwork. Richard Pryor's vast quantity of releases issued by Laff is a case in point. Pryor released only one album for Laff, Craps (After Hours), with his direct participation and then later signed a deal with the larger Stax label. Laff sued Pryor after Stax released That Nigger's Crazy in 1974; the case was settled when Laff gave Pryor his freedom in exchange for being allowed to compile albums from recordings it made with Pryor between 1969 and 1973. Laff went out of business sometime in the 1980s, with their last \\"hit\\" recording being Kip Addotta's \\"Wet Dream\\" (a favorite of fans of the Dr. Demento radio show), but many of their more profitable recordings still circulated through other labels for some time afterward. In 1993 Island Records briefly re-released on cassette and compact disc some Richard Pryor and Redd Foxx titles that had been originally issued by Laff, including Pryor's Craps (After Hours). These releases disappeared from store shelves after Island's parent company PolyGram was absorbed by Universal Music. In 2002 Richard Pryor and his wife/manager, Jennifer Lee Pryor, purchased the rights to all of Richard's Laff masters and raw tapes from San Juan Music, the successor in interest to Laff Records. The Pryors then gave free rein to Rhino Records to go through the tapes and make an anthology that included the entire Craps (After Hours) album and the best of other Laff releases. The results were released in 2005 on the 2-CD set Evolution/Revolution: The Early Years (1966‚Äì1974). Some of the remaining Laff masters have been reissued by Uproar Entertainment. Note that there were several earlier, unrelated companies that issued 78 RPM discs under the name Laff Records in the late 1940s. Of these, one was based in New York, a second was allegedly from Chicago, and a third released titles under the name Laff- Disc (later abbreviated to L D). All were probably defunct long before the Los Angeles label began operations. ==See also== * List of record labels == References == ==External links== * Laff Records Illustrated Discography at rassoodock.com * Uproar Entertainment Category:American independent record labels Category:Defunct record labels of the United States Category:Comedy record labels Category:1970s in comedy ","title":"Laff Records"},{"id":"2202712","text":"Paromomycin is an antimicrobial used to treat a number of parasitic infections including amebiasis, giardiasis, leishmaniasis, and tapeworm infection. It is a first-line treatment for amebiasis or giardiasis during pregnancy. Otherwise it is generally a second line treatment option. It is used by mouth, applied to the skin, or by injection into a muscle. Common side effects when taken by mouth include loss of appetite, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. When applied to the skin side effects include itchiness, redness, and blisters. When given by injection there may be fever, liver problems, or hearing loss. Use during breastfeeding appears to be safe. Paromomycin is in the aminoglycoside family of medications and causes microbe death by stopping the creation of bacterial proteins. Paromomycin was discovered in the 1950s from a type of streptomyces and came into medical use in 1960. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Paromomycin is available as a generic medication. In India the injectable form is about 4.19 to 8.38 pounds for a course of treatment as of 2007. In the United States a typical course of treatment is more than US$200 as of 2015. ==Medical uses== It is an antimicrobial used to treat intestinal parasitic infections such as cryptosporidiosis and amoebiasis, and other diseases such as leishmaniasis. Paromomycin was demonstrated to be effective against cutaneous leishmaniasis in clinical studies in the USSR in the 1960s, and in trials with visceral leishmaniasis in the early 1990s. The route of administration is intramuscular injection and capsule. Paromomycin topical cream with or without gentamicin is an effective treatment for ulcerative cutaneous leishmaniasis, according to the results of a phase-3, randomized, double-blind, parallel group‚Äìcontrolled trial. ===Pregnancy and breastfeeding=== The medication is poorly absorbed. The effect it may have on the baby is still unknown. There is limited data regarding the safety of taking paromomycin while breastfeeding but because the drug is poorly absorbed minimal amounts of drug will be secreted in breastmilk. ===HIV/AIDS=== There is limited evidence that paromomycin can be used in persons coinfected with HIV and Cryptosporidium. A few small trials have showed a reduction in oocyst shedding after treatment with paromomycin. == Adverse effects == The most common adverse effects associated with paromomycin sulfate are abdominal cramps, diarrhea, heartburn, nausea, and vomiting. Long-term use of paromomycin increases the risk for bacterial or fungal infection. Signs of overgrowth include white patches in the oral cavities. Other less common adverse events include myasthenia gravis, kidney damage, enterocolitis, malabsorption syndrome, eosinophilia, headache, hearing loss, ringing in the ear, itching, severe dizziness, and pancreatitis. == Interactions == Paromomycin belongs to the aminoglycoside drug class and therefore are toxic to the kidneys and to ears. These toxicities are additive and are more likely to occur when used with other drugs that cause ear and kidney toxicity. Concurrent use of foscarnet increases the risk of kidney toxicity. Concurrent use of colistimethate and paromomycin can cause a dangerous slowing of breathing known as respiratory depression, and should be done with extreme caution if necessary. When used with systemic antibiotics such as paromomycin, the cholera vaccine can cause an immune response. Use with strong diuretics, which can also harm hearing, should be avoided. Paromomycin may have dangerous reactions when used with the paralytic succinylcholine by increasing its neuromuscular effects. There are no known food or drink interactions with paromomycin. ==Mechanism== Paromomycin is a protein synthesis inhibitor in nonresistant cells by binding to 16S ribosomal RNA. This broad-spectrum antibiotic soluble in water, is very similar in action to neomycin. Antimicrobial activity of paromomycin against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus has been shown. Paromomycin works as an antibiotic by increasing the error rate in ribosomal translation. Paromomcyin binds to a RNA loop, where residues A1492 and A1493 are usually stacked, and expels these two residues. These two residues are involved in detection of correct Watson-Crick pairing between the codon and anti codon. When correct interactions are achieved, the binding provides energy to expel the two residues. Paromocyin binding provides enough energy for residue expulsion and thus results in the ribosome incorporating the incorrect amino acid into the nascent peptide chain.Voet D, Voet J, 2011, Biochemistry, pp 1397 ==PharmacokineticsAbsorption=== GI absorption is poor. Any obstructions or factors which impair GI motility may increase the absorption of the drug from the digestive tract. In addition, any structural damage, such as lesions or ulcerations, will tend to increase drug absorption.Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories. Paromomycin sulfate capsules, USP prescribing information. Detroit, MI; 1997 Mar. For intramuscular (IM) injection, the absorption is rapid. Paromomycin will reach peak plasma concentration within one hour following IM injection. The in-vitro and in-vivo activities parallel those of neomycin. ===Distribution=== Information not available. ===Elimination=== Almost 100% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged via feces. Any absorbed drug will be excreted in urine.Product Information: Humatin(R), paromomycin sulfate capsules. Parke-Davis, Division of Warner-Lambert Company, Morris Plains, NJ, 1999 ==History== Paromomycin was discovered in the 1950s amongst the secondary metabolites of a variety of Streptomyces then known as Streptomyces krestomuceticus, now known as Streptomyces rimosus. It came into medical use in 1960. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Aminoglycoside antibiotics Category:Antiprotozoal agents Category:Orphan drugs Category:World Health Organization essential medicines Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate ","title":"Paromomycin"},{"id":"2202713","text":"Jalwehra, commonly known as Jalerha, is a village in Hoshiarpur, Punjab.

Hilmar √ñrn Hilmarsson was a pioneer in the use of computers when composing music and cleared the path for new ideas in recording and arrangements. He has worked on ambitious, experimental and original projects with various musicians, such as Psychic TV, Current 93, Sigur R√≥s, Steind√≥r Andersen and Eiv√∏r P√°lsd√≥ttir. ==From early bands to the birth of √ûeyr== From 1972 to 1975 he was playing drums in a school band called Fatima with guitarist J√≥hannes Helgason, bassist Birgir Ott√≥son and singer Gu√∞mundur Eyj√≥lfsson. In 1974 singer Eir√≠kur Hauksson replaced Gu√∞mundur and guitarist Sigurgeir Sigmundsson joined them and a year after they broke up. By 1979 Hilmar √ñrn was playing drums and occasionally the synthesizer in a band called Fellibylur (Hurricane) with vocalist Magn√∫s Gu√∞mundsson and bassist Hilmar √ñrn Agnarsson. The band was expanded with the arrival of singers El√≠n Reynisd√≥ttir, guitarist J√≥hannes Helgason and drummer Sigtryggur Baldursson and with the new line-up, they created a new band called Frostr√≥sir (Frost Roses) that played mainly disco music. The band changed their name to √ûeyr and released the debut album in December 1980 with the title √ûaga√∞ √≠ Hel which contained some lyrics written by Hilmar √ñrn. √ûeyr underwent internal changes and Eir√≠kur left the band and guitarists Gu√∞laugur Kristinn √ìttarsson and √ûorsteinn Magn√∫sson joined in. The music evolved dramatically with the new members and El√≠n and J√≥hannes left the band. The new √ûeyr became very famous in Iceland with √ötfrymi and Mj√∂tvi√∞ur M√¶r, among other releases, and Hilmar √ñrn collaborated with them with some lyrics and art works, and also managed the band from 1981 to 1982 with Gu√∞ni Ragnar Agnarsson creating Esquimaux Management (Eskvim√≥, in Icelandic), an independent record label and book publisher. √ûeyr held a deep interest in science, magic and philosophy and Hilmar √ñrn served as an influential figure. Gu√∞ni and Hilmar withdrew from the band‚Äôs management in 1983 and were replaced by Gu√∞mundur Sigurfreyr J√≥nason, the same year √ûeyr disbanded. ==Other projects and collaborations== In 1984 Gu√∞laugur Kristinn √ìttarsson and singer Bj√∂rk Gu√∞mundsd√≥ttir, who at that time were in Kukl formed the Elgar Sisters, Hilmar joined them next to Einar Arnaldur Melax, Sigtryggur Baldursson, √ûorsteinn Magn√∫sson and Birgir Mogensen to record 11 songs from 1984 to 1986 and disbanded afterwards. The Elgar Sisters did not release any album, but some of their works were featured during the solo careers of Bj√∂rk and Gu√∞laugur. In 1987 Hilmar began to work with Current 93, a band led by David Tibet and collaborated with 10 releases, among them, he produced the single Crowleymass in 1987 and in 1991 produced Island, an album which featured singer Bj√∂rk as backing vocalist on the song ‚ÄúFalling‚Äù. He also collaborated with the band Ornamental in 1988. M√ñK Trio was a group formed by bassist T√≥mas Magn√∫s T√≥masson (known by his work in Stu√∞menn), Hilmar √ñrn and Gu√∞laugur Kristinn √ìttarsson. In fact, the name stemmed from the initials corresponding to the middle name of each member. Their first gig was by 1992. M√ñK Trio did not play regularly and they never released any album. Their last presentation was in August 2001 at Galdrah√°t√≠√∞in √° Str√∂ndum, Reykjav√≠k. In 1992 he started to record with singer and trumpet player Einar √ñrn Benediktsson (from the Sugarcubes) on a new project called Frostbite and released an album titled The Second Coming the following year through label One Little Indian, but after this, the band was dissolved. His collaborations continued with sound engineer Andrew McKenzie in the Hafler Trio (H3√ñH) and in 1993 released an album called Bootleg H3√ñH which contained remixes from Frostbite. By November 1997 Hilmar and Einar √ñrn joined drummer Sigtryggur Baldursson to form Grindverk. After signing with FatCat Records they released their debut album, a 12-inch vinyl titled Gesundheit von K on 1 January 1999. With 4 tracks, Gesundheit von K encompassed a wide range of styles: from the industrial funk of the title song to the exotic jazz of ‚ÄúKastrato‚Äù. Grindverk showed with this album a dark music, with free instruments proper of the funk music or post industrialism of the eighties but in the context of the nineties. They were supposed to release an album called T.h.e.r.a.p.i.s.t.s by July 1999, but it was canceled as Grindverk disbanded shortly after their debut release. Hilmar √ñrn & Sigur R√≥s: In 2000 he collaborated with Sigur R√≥s on the soundtrack to the film Angels of the Universe, which was directed by Fri√∞rik √û√≥r Fri√∞riksson. This seventeen-track album contained fifteen songs composed by H√ñH with his mellow soothing trademark sound (classical guitars, strings and synthesizers) and two songs created by Sigur R√≥s (‚ÄúB√≠um B√≠um Bambal√≥‚Äù and ‚ÄúD√°narfregnir og Jar√∞afarir‚Äù). Later, he also worked with Sigur R√≥s composing and performing on ‚ÄúHrafnagaldr √ì√∞ins‚Äù. GVDL: Was another music project formed in 2001 with Gu√∞laugur K. √ìttarsson and bass player Georg Bjarnason. The group was established for the arrival in Iceland by the American band Fuck. In fact, the name of the band were the initials of the American group shifted one place further. They only had one performance at Kaffi Reykjav√≠k, without recording any track. In 2004 Hilmar √ñrn collaborated with singer Eiv√∏r P√°lsd√≥ttir in a joint project between Iceland and Ireland and performed with other musicians from both countries in two concerts, one in Reykjav√≠k and the other in T√≥rshavn, in the Faroe Islands. ==Score music compositions== From 1981 onward, Hilmar √ñrn Hilmarsson has composed music for several movies, both Icelandic and foreign, and worked with film directors such as Henning Carlsen (Pan, 1995), Jane Campion (In the Cut, 2003) and Fri√∞rik √û√≥r Fri√∞riksson (Brennu- Nj√°lssaga, 1981 - Skytturnar, 1987 - B√∂rn N√°tt√∫runnar, 1991 - B√≠√≥dagar, 1994 - Cold Fever, 1995 - Dj√∂flaeyjan, 1996 - Angels of the Universe, 2000 and Falcons, 2002). Hilmar √ñrn has received many awards for his contributions as a film composer. In 1993 he won the European Film Composer of the Year for his work on the Oscar nominated Children of Nature, the film by Fri√∞riksson. ==From his interest on magic and the orgone therapy to the √Åsatr√∫ Association== Hilmar √ñrn joined the √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagi√∞ (√Åsatr√∫ Association), the old pagan Norse religion, in 1974 when he was sixteen years old. As being interested in Aleister Crowley once, Hilmar √ñrn has always held interest in magic, witchcraft and paganism, as well as the work of Wilhelm Reich which is not only reflected through his influence on the musical works but also through an endeavor called Mi√∞gar√∞ur (Midgard). In an interview with Karl-Erik Seigfried in 2011, he described his relationship with the theories of Crowley: It was a center created in 1982 by him, Gu√∞laugur K. √ìttarsson and Gu√∞mundur S. J√≥nason to promote the work of Reich by means of orgone therapists and lectures.\\"He was looking for the wrong gods....he was a failed teacher...Don‚Äôt go down that road, because it will end in tears.\\" Hilmar √ñrn was ordained as allsherjargo√∞i or chief go√∞i of the √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagi√∞ during a formal ceremony held on 4 July 2003. He is a recognized authority on indigenous Norse paganism. ==Personal life== Hilmar √ñrn's parents were Hilmar √ìlafsson (1936‚Äì1986), an architect, and Rannveig Hr√∂nn Kristinsd√≥ttir (born 1937). He is married to the writer Ragna Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir. He is the father of two sons and two daughters.Fann sinn farveg √≠ t√≥nlistinni og √°satr√∫nni. 23 April 2018.

Unlike reversals, however, an excursion does not permanently change the large-scale orientation of the field, but rather represents a dramatic, typically short-lived change in field intensity, with a variation in pole orientation of up to 45¬∞ from the previous position. These events, which typically last a few thousand to a few tens of thousands of years, often involve declines in field strength to between 0 and 20% of normal. Excursions, unlike reversals, are generally not recorded around the entire globe. This is partially due to them not being recorded well within the sedimentary record, but also because they likely do not extend through the entire geomagnetic field. One of the first excursions to be studied was the Laschamp event, dated at around years ago. This event was a complete reversal of polarity, however, as it later turned out, though with the reversed field 5% of the normal strength. Since this event has also been seen in sites around the globe, it is suggested as one of the few examples of a truly global excursion. ==Causes== Scientific opinion is divided on what causes geomagnetic excursions. The dominant theory is that they are an inherent aspect of the dynamo processes that maintain the Earth's magnetic field. In computer simulations, it is observed that magnetic field lines can sometimes become tangled and disorganized through the chaotic motions of liquid metal in the Earth's core. In such cases, this spontaneous disorganization can cause decreases in the magnetic field as perceived at the Earth's surface. In truth, under this scenario, the Earth's magnetic field intensity does not significantly change in the core itself, but rather energy is transferred from a dipole configuration to higher order multipole moments which decay more rapidly with the distance from the Earth's core, so that the expression of such a magnetic field at the surface of the Earth would be considerably less, even without significant changes in the strength of the deep field. This scenario is supported by observed tangling and spontaneous disorganizations in the solar magnetic field. However, this process in the sun invariably leads to a reversal of the solar magnetic field (see: solar cycle), and has never been observed such that the field would recover without large scale changes in field orientation. The work of David Gubbins suggests that excursions occur when the magnetic field is reversed only within the liquid outer core; reversals occur when the inner core is also affected. This fits well with observations of events within the current chron of reversals taking 3‚Äì7000 years to complete, while excursions typically last 500‚Äì3000 years. However, this timescale does not hold true for all events, and the need for separate generation of fields has been contested, since the changes can be spontaneously generated in mathematical models. A minority opinion, held by such figures as Richard A. Muller, is that geomagnetic excursions are not spontaneous processes but rather triggered by external events which directly disrupt the flow in the Earth's core. Such processes may include the arrival of continental slabs carried down into the mantle by the action of plate tectonics at subduction zones, the initiation of new mantle plumes from the core‚Äìmantle boundary, and possibly mantle-core shear forces and displacements resulting from very large impact events. Supporters of this theory hold that any of these events lead to a large scale disruption of the dynamo, effectively turning off the geomagnetic field for a period of time necessary for it to recover. Richard A. Muller and Donald E. Morris suggests geomagnetic reversal due to very large impact event and following rapid climate change. The impact triggered a little ice age and change of water redistribution more to poles alters the rotation rate of crust and mantle. If the sea-level change is sufficiently large (>10 meters) and rapid (in a few hundred years), then the velocity shear in the liquid core disrupts the convective cells that drive the Earth's dynamo. Except for recent periods of the geologic past, it is not well known how frequently geomagnetic excursions occur. Unlike geomagnetic reversals, which are easily detected by the change in field direction, the relatively short-lived excursions can be easily overlooked in long duration, coarsely resolved, records of past geomagnetic field intensity. Present knowledge suggests that they are around ten times more abundant than reversals, with up to 12 excursions documented within the current reversal period Brunhes‚ÄìMatuyama reversal. ==Effects== Due to the weakening of the magnetic field, particularly during the transition period, greater amounts of radiation would be able to reach the Earth, increasing production of beryllium 10 and levels of carbon 14. However, it is likely that nothing serious would occur, as the human species has certainly lived through at least one such event; Homo erectus and possibly Homo heidelbergensis lived through the Brunhes‚ÄìMatuyama reversal with no known ill effect, and excursions are shorter-lived and do not result in permanent changes to the magnetic field. The major hazard to modern society is likely to be similar to those associated with geomagnetic storms, where satellites and power supplies may be damaged, although compass navigation would also be affected. Some forms of life that are thought to navigate based on magnetic fields may be disrupted, but again it is suggested that these species have survived excursions in the past. Since excursion periods are not always global, any effect might well only be experienced in certain places, with others relatively unaffected. The time period involved could be as little as a century, or as much as years. ===Possible relationship to climate=== There is evidence that geomagnetic excursions may be associated with episodes of rapid short-term climatic cooling during periods of continental glaciation (ice ages). Recent analysis of the geomagnetic reversal frequency, oxygen isotope record, and tectonic plate subduction rate, which are indicators of the changes in the heat flux at the core mantle boundary, climate and plate tectonic activity, shows that all these changes indicate similar rhythms on million years‚Äô timescale in the Cenozoic Era occurring with the common fundamental periodicity of ‚àº13 Myr during most of the time. ==Occurrence== Geomagnetic excursions for the Brunhes geomagnetic chron are relatively well described. Geomagnetic excursions in the Matuyama, Gauss and Gilbert chrons are also reported and new possible excursions are suggested for these chrons based on analysis of the deep drilling cores from Lake Baikal and their comparison with the oceanic core (ODP) and Chinese loess records. ==See also== * March 1989 geomagnetic storm * Polar drift * Solar storm of 1859 * ==Notes and referencesCategory:Geomagnetic reversal ","title":"Geomagnetic excursion"},{"id":"2202724","text":"Walter Wellesley \\"Red\\" Smith (September 25, 1905 ‚Äì January 15, 1982) was an American sportswriter.

Finally he was picked up by the Milwaukee Sentinel. Smith then worked for the St. Louis Journal as a sportswriter. This is where Smith developed his humorous and literate style that made his writing so beloved and respected. After his stint at the St. Louis Journal, Smith worked at the Philadelphia Record for nine years, from 1936 to 1945. After 18 years, Smith joined the New York Herald Tribune in 1945. He cemented his reputation with the Herald Tribune, as his column, ‚ÄúViews of Sports‚Äù, was widely read and often syndicated. Smith wrote three or four columns a week that were printed by 275 newspapers in the United States and 225 in about 30 foreign nations. When the Herald Tribune folded in 1966, he became a freelance writer. In 1971, at the age of 66, he was hired by The New York Times and wrote four columns a week for the next decade, sometimes devoting 18 hours a day to them. Smith mainly wrote about the sports that interested him such as baseball, football, boxing, and horse racing. He had a distaste for basketball (which he called \\"whistleball\\") and hockey, and often wrote about one of his passions, fly-fishing, for trout. Many of Smith's fishing stories were written in a self-deprecating manner and he often spoke of how embarrassingly bad he was at it. In 1956, one of Smith‚Äôs columns earned him the second Grantland Rice Memorial for outstanding sportswriting. He wrote in a journalistic style and avoided the flowery language and cliches of many sportswriters. During his time with The New York Times, Smith garnered many awards. In 1976, he was the second sportswriter to win the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary, citing \\"his commentary on sports in 1975 and for many other years\\".\\"Commentary\\". The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved 2013-10-31. He also received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award from the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1976, which is baseball's highest honor for print journalists. Furthermore, the Associated Press awarded him the first Red Smith Award for \\"outstanding contributions to sports journalism\\". Smith's writing abilities and command of the English language made him much sought after as an editor or adviser by dictionary and thesarus publishers. ==\\"Open a vein and bleed\\"== Smith is best known for his famous quotation, \\"Writing is easy. You just open a vein and bleed.\\" In 1946, sportswriter Paul Gallico wrote, \\"It is only when you open your veins and bleed onto the page a little that you establish contact with your reader.\\" In April 1949, columnist Walter Winchell wrote, \\"Red Smith was asked if turning out a daily column wasn't quite a chore. ... 'Why, no', dead- panned Red. 'You simply sit down at the typewriter, open your veins, and bleed.'\\"http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/09/14/writing-bleed/ ==Criticism of Muhammad Ali== Smith was a strong critic of former world heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali until late in Ali's career. This was because when Ali refused to serve during the Vietnam War, claiming his case as a conscientious objector, Smith, who had never served in uniform himself, wrote: \\"Squealing over the possibility that the military may call him up, Cassius makes himself as sorry a spectacle as those unwashed punks who picket and demonstrate against the war\\",New York Herald Tribune, February 22, 1966. and berated Ali for being a \\"draft dodger\\" and a \\"slacker\\".New York World Journal Tribune, April 23, 1967. Later Smith famously commented on Ali's first professional defeat in 32 bouts, against Joe Frazier: \\"If they fought a dozen times, Joe Frazier would whip Muhammad Ali a dozen times; and it would get easier as it went along\\". Ali went on to fight Frazier twice more, winning both times, once by unanimous decision and once by TKO. Before their final match, the 1975 Thrilla in Manila, Smith admitted Ali was both a great fighter and a great man.\\"It's Only a Game\\", National Public Radio, July 20, 2013. ==Later life and family== Smith was married twice. His first wife died in 1967. Smith then married Phyllis Warner Weiss in 1968. The couple lived in New Canaan, Connecticut and in Martha‚Äôs Vineyard, Massachusetts. At the time of his death, Smith had two children, five stepchildren, six grandchildren, and two great- grandchildren. Red's son, Terence Smith, went on to be a journalist at The New York Times, CBS News, PBS, The Huffington Post, and NPR. The younger Smith went on to win two Emmy Awards. His first Emmy Award was in 1989 for his coverage of people who lived near nuclear power plants; his second Emmy was for his coverage of Hurricane Hugo in 1990. During The New York Times years, Smith's writing style became shorter, drier, and more concise. He believed that his columns in earlier years had rambled too much and took forever to get to the point. He also became more cynical in his beliefs (\\"I used to go too far in holding up athletes as flawless gods\\") and in the last years started increasingly criticizing the treatment of players by team owners and management, no doubt motivated by past criticism that he had gone out of his way to justify owners' behavior. He also denounced the International Olympic Committee as a 19th-century relic. Smith's 4 January 1980 column called for the boycott by the US of the Summer Olympics in Moscow, making him the first sportswriter to do so. President Carter announced a few weeks later that the US would not attend the games that summer, in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Smith lived the last years of his life in New Canaan, Connecticut. On 11 January 1982, Smith announced that he would cut down to three columns a week, stating that \\"We shall see whether the quality improves.\\" Four days later, he died of heart failure in Stamford, Connecticut.https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/16/obituaries/red-smith-sports- columnist-who-won-pulitzer-dies-at-76.html Smith is buried in Stamford's Long Ridge Union Cemetery. Red Smith School (4K through 8th grades) in Green Bay, Wisconsin is named in his honor. Also named in his honor is the Red Smith Handicap, a thoroughbred horse race annually run at Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens, New York. Smith realized the significance of sports in the American culture. He once stated the following: ‚ÄúSports is not really a play world. I think it‚Äôs the real world. The people we‚Äôre writing about in professional sports, they‚Äôre suffering and living and dying and loving, and trying to make their way through life just as the bricklayers and politicians are.‚Äù He also said \\"It is no coincidence that the largest surviving monument of the ancient Greeks and Romans is the Coliseum in Rome, the Yankees Stadium of its time.\\" ==Selected works== * * The Best of Red Smith * Red Smith's Sports Annual * Views of Sport * Out of the Red * \\"Absent Friends\\" * \\" Strawberries in Winter\\" ==See also== ==References== 9\\\\. http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/549849/Red-Smith ==External links== * * Baseball Hall of Fame J.

The series starred Jack Webb as Pete Kelly and was created by writer Richard L. Breen, who had previously worked with Webb on Pat Novak for Hire; James Moser and Jo Eisinger wrote most of the other scripts. Set in Kansas City, Missouri, in the early 1920s, the series was a crime drama with a strong musical atmosphere (Webb was a noted Dixieland jazz enthusiast). Kansas City in this era was a hotbed of jazz, as well as of organized crime and political corruption, all of which influenced the series. ==Overview== Pete Kelly was a musician, a cornet player who headed his own jazz combo, \\"Pete Kelly's Big Seven.\\" They worked at 417 Cherry Street, a speakeasy run by George Lupo, often mentioned but never heard. Kelly, narrating the series, described Lupo as a \\"fat, friendly little guy.\\" The plots typically centered on Kelly's reluctant involvement with gangsters, gun molls, FBI agents, and people trying to save their own skins. The endings were often downbeat. The supporting cast was minimal; apart from the off-mike character Lupo and occasional speaking parts by the band members (notably Red the bass player, played by Jack Kruschen), the only other regular role of note was Maggie Jackson, the torch singer at another club (Fat Annie's, \\"across the river on the Kansas side\\"), played by blues singer Meredith Howard. In one episode, Bessie Smith is mentioned as the singer at Fat Annie's instead of Maggie Jackson. Boozy ex-bootlegger Barney Ricketts would show up occasionally, an informant not unlike the character Jocko Madigan on Webb and Breen's Pat Novak for Hire. The episodic roles were filled by William Conrad (as various mob bosses), Vic Perrin, and Roy Glenn, among others. ==Music== The music dominated the series. In addition to one song by Maggie Jackson, each episode boasted two jazz numbers by the \\"Big Seven.\\" The group was actually led by Dick Cathcart, the cornet player who was Pete Kelly's musical stand-in. The other members of the group, all well known jazz musicians, included Matty Matlock on clarinet, Moe Schneider on trombone, piano player Ray Sherman, bass player Morty Corb, guitarist Bill Newman, and drummer Nick Fatool. The show's announcer was another frequent Webb collaborator, George Fenneman, who would open each show with \\"This one's about Pete Kelly.\\" ==Legacy== The series lasted only three months, but inspired a 1955 film version of Pete Kelly's Blues, in which Jack Webb produced, directed and starred. It used many of the same musicians, including Cathcart, and Ella Fitzgerald was cast as Maggie Jackson. A lesser-known television version, still produced and directed by Webb but with William Reynolds in the lead, aired in 1959, using scripts originally written for the radio version. After the film, two albums were released, a soundtrack recording and Pete Kelly Lets His Hair Down, an instrumental album using the musicians from the series with songs arranged by tempo - \\"blue songs\\" and \\"red songs\\" with names such as \\"Peacock,\\" '\\"Periwinkle,\\" \\"Midnight,\\" \\"Rouge,\\" \\"Flame'\\" and '\\"Fire Engine.\\" This LP was released by Rhino Records as one-half of a Webb compilation disc, Just The Tracks, Ma‚Äôam. ==Listen to== *6 streaming episodes of Pete Kelly's Blues from Old Time Radio Researchers Group ==See also== *Pete Kelly's Blues (film) *Pete Kelly's Blues (song) *Pete Kelly's Blues (TV series) *Songs from Pete Kelly's Blues ==References== ==Sources== *McNeil, Alex (1991).

Its leaves are colored dark red/purple. However, the plant changes its color according to the pH value of the soil, due to a pigment belonging to anthocyanins. In acidic soils, the leaves grow more reddish, in neutral soils they will grow more purple, while an alkaline soil will produce rather greenish-yellow coloured cabbages. This explains the fact that the same plant is known by different colours in various regions. Furthermore, the juice of red cabbage can be used as a home-made pH indicator, turning red in acid and green/yellow in basic solutions. It can be found in all Europe, throughout the Americas, in China and especially in Africa. On cooking, red cabbage will normally turn blue. To retain the red color it is necessary to add vinegar or acidic fruit to the pot. Red cabbage needs well fertilized soil and sufficient humidity to grow. It is a seasonal plant which is seeded in spring and harvested in late fall. Red cabbage is a better keeper than its \\"white\\" relatives and does not need to be converted to sauerkraut to last the winter. ==Uses== Red cabbage is often used raw for salads and coleslaw. This vegetable can be eaten cooked. It is the traditional accompanying side dish paired with many German meals, notably meat dishes like Sauerbraten or D√∂ner. At Christmas it can be spiced and served as an accompaniment to seasonal roast goose or turkey. Often apples are added to give it sweet-sour taste. ==Cultivation== Red cabbage plantation on a farm A cut red cabbage It is recommended to start red cabbage seeds indoors 4 weeks before the last frost. Sow in containers that allow for movement of water through the bottom of a cell. Popular seedling starting containers are peat pots, egg cartons, plug trays or milk cartons. Once the seedlings grow to about tall, and have developed their first leaves, they can be hardened off and moved outside for transplanting. Red cabbage prefers climates that remain moist and cool for most of its vegetative growth stage, so they can be placed in the ground shortly after the last frost, while the spring is still cool. The cabbage plants can be spaced about from one another. They will need watering often but are otherwise low maintenance plants. ==pH indicator== A gradient of red cabbage extract pH indicator from acidic solution on the left to basic on the right Red cabbage contains an anthocyanin-based dye that can be used as a pH indicator. It is red, pink, or magenta in acids, (pH < 7), purple in neutral solutions (pH ‚âà7), and ranges from blue to green to yellow in alkaline solutions (pH > 7).\\"Red Cabbage Lab: Acids and Bases\\" (pdf) ==Nutrition== Red cabbage has a high content of vitamin C and vitamin K, containing 44% and 72%, respectively, of the Daily Value (DV) per 100-gram amount (right table of USDA nutrient values). Basic research on cabbage phytochemicals is ongoing to discern if certain cabbage compounds may affect health or have anti-disease effects. Such compounds include sulforaphane and other glucosinolates which may stimulate the production of detoxifying enzymes during metabolism. Studies suggest that cruciferous vegetables, including cabbage, may have protective effects against colon cancer. Cabbage is a source of indole-3-carbinol, a chemical under basic research for its possible properties. ==References== ==External links== * How to Make Red Cabbage pH Indicator * How to extract the dye Category:Cabbage Category:Leaf vegetables ","title":"Red cabbage"},{"id":"2202732","text":"Leo D. Stoller (born June 5, 1946) is an American self-styled \\"intellectual property entrepreneur\\" based in suburban Chicago, Illinois. Stoller claimed rights to a large inventory of well-known trademarks and engaged in the assertive enforcement of those alleged trademark rights, threatening infringement action against people and companies who attempt to use similar marks. Though he managed to obtain license payments in some circumstances through demand letters, Stoller lost some key challenges in federal court, and was sanctioned by United States regulators for filing thousands of motions. A federal court labeled Stoller and his companies as \\"vexatious litigants\\" in 2005, and his bankruptcy filing from that year was converted to a liquidation in 2006 after the judge found Stoller's filing to have been made in bad faith. On August 8, 2007, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of Stoller's trademark assets to the Society for the Prevention of Trademark Abuse, LLC.In re Leo Stoller, Debtor, no. 05-B-64075 (N.D. Ill., Aug. 8, 2007); Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Approving Sales of Debtor's Assets ==Background== Stoller's companies included Rentamark.com, Stealth Industries Inc., S Industries Inc., Sentra Sporting Goods U.S.A., and Central Manufacturing Company. Through these companies, Stoller has registered trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for over 25 years including Stealth, Sentra, Dark Star, Air Frame, Triana, Stradivarius, Havoc, Chestnut, Trillium, White Line Fever, Fire Power, Love Your Body, and many others. Stoller has filed oppositions to others' trademark applications with the USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) numerous times, and filed applications for extension of the deadline to file such oppositions even more times. Stoller claims a number of large and small companies have resolved trademark controversies. When approaching infringers, Stoller is reported to document his claims with copies of letters which demonstrate capitulation with his demands. Such letters are said to be from companies such as K-Mart, and often marked \\"Confidential\\".

District Judge George W. Lindberg ruled in favor of Centra 2000, finding that S Industries did not hold a federal registration for the \\"Sentra\\" mark for use on computer hardware or software. Because S Industries' claims were, in the judge's view, completely unfounded and because its procedural maneuvering multiplied the cost of defending against the suit, Centra 2000 was awarded attorney's fees in July 1998.S Industries, Inc. v.

Central Manufacturing Co. v. Brett A case decided by summary judgment on September 30, 2005, Central Manufacturing Co. v. Brett, Central Mfg Co. v. Brett (No. 1:04-cv-03049 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 30, 2005)) pitted a Stoller-owned company against Hall-of-Fame baseball player George Brett, whose company, Brett Brothers Sports International Inc., sells a bat under the name \\"Stealth\\". It was alleged in this case that the use of that name infringed upon Stoller's trademark rights. In its decision, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois determined that there was no likelihood of confusion where consumers would mistakenly regard Brett's bats as being from Stoller's company. The court also found that Stoller failed to provide adequate proof that his company and its licensees had even sold baseball-related merchandise at all. The court found likelihood of confusion in the opposite direction, found Brett's trademark rights to be senior, and hence canceled Stoller's (Central Manufacturing) registration. In the decision, the court described Stoller's tactics and enumerated dozens of unsuccessful infringement cases he had brought in that court. Chief Judge Charles P. Kocoras from the Northern District of Illinois then issued a citation to Stoller after reviewing his \\"filing history\\" having filed at least \\"49 lawsuits in this court, individually or through one of his many wholly owned corporations\\". \\"The Executive Committee (of the Northern District of Illinois) in its capacity as the supervisor of the assignment of cases, has directed that Leo Stoller inform this court of any claim by him why the Executive Committee should not impose reasonable and necessary restraints upon Mr. Stoller's ability to file civil cases in this District.\\" After a thorough review of Leo Stoller's entire filing history the Executive Committee of the Northern District of Illinois issued a decision stating that \\"the committee will take no further action in this matter.\\" On July 9, 2007, in an opinion that opened with a laudatory description of the George Brett \\"Pine Tar Incident\\", the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the District Court's judgment, including the order for Stoller to pay Brett's attorney fees.https://caselaw.findlaw.com/data2/circs/7th/062083p.pdf Central Mfg.

Pure Fishing, Inc., No. 05 C 00725 (N.D. Ill.) Pure Fishing denied infringement and counterclaimed alleging that Stoller's trademark business violated various state and federal laws against unfair business practices. Pure Fishing also acquired and asserted in another counterclaim (piercing the corporate veil and continuation of business theories) the unsatisfied 1998 sanction judgment that had been awarded to Centra 2000 against Stoller's S Industries, Inc. Pure Fishing also showed that Stoller had signed his attorney's name to pleadings that were filed with the court.Notice of Appearance for the corporate entities and a court-ordered Rule 11 certification as to the accuracy of facts in a Second Amended Complaint Stoller's case was dismissed with prejudice and default judgments entered against all corporate defendants for lack of prosecution and against Stoller as a sanction under Rule 11. During Stoller's 2006 bankruptcy proceedings (see below), Pure Fishing went back to the district court for entry of a Final Judgment. On October 4, 2006, a federal court in Chicago entered final judgment in Central Mfg. Co., et al. v. Pure Fishing, Inc., et al. The Court declared the case to be \\"exceptional\\" under 15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1117(a) and ordered Central Mfg. to pay Pure Fishing‚Äôs costs, charges and disbursements, including a reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred in the action. The court further ordered that Stoller and his companies were \\"vexatious litigants\\" and barred them \\"from instituting any lawsuit or trademark opposition without prior leave of this Court pursuant to this Court‚Äôs authority under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1651(a).\\" The court also cancelled the marks asserted in the Complaint. Stoller filed a Notice of Appeal from the October 4 judgment and has moved to stay the enforcement of the said judgment pending the appeals.

Stoller claims that the \\"Google\\" mark has become generic, yet also claims that it infringes on prior alleged rights to the name held by Stoller's company. The case against the Google mark, however, was dismissed with prejudice at the instigation of Stoller's trustee in bankruptcy, who is empowered to take action in all cases in which Stoller and his companies are involved. Subsequently, on January 19, 2007, Google filed a suit against Stoller's companies alleging violations of the anti-racketeering RICO law.http://www.roylance.com/Uploads/CentralMfgCo/Complaint%20FILED.pdf On April 2, 2008 the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a judgment in favor of Google, on the ground that the case had been pursued using contradictory principles, both treating those companies as extensions of Stoller himself, and as separate legal entities. The case was remanded to the lower court for further action. The court noted, however, that Stoller remained subject to an order \\"directing that all federal courts in [the Seventh Circuit] return unfiled any papers he submits directly or indirectly unless and until he pays a $10,000 fine we imposed against him in August 2007,\\" and \\"he will have to pay the outstanding sanction or, as a practical matter, face certain default.\\" Google, Inc. v.

In 2001, Stoller made a bankruptcy filing for his litigation entity, S Industries, Inc., that was filed during the appeal of the S Industries, Inc. v. Centra 2000 decision (N.D. Ill. 1998) that had levied sanctions against S Industries for oppressive litigation. See discussion at Roylance, Abrams, Berdo & Goodman Stoller collection On December 20, 2005, Stoller filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 13, before a final judgment could be entered in the Pure Fishing case.

Pure Fishing filed a claim in the bankruptcy case and asked the court to convert Stoller's case from Chapter 13 (debtor controlled reorganization) to Chapter 7 (liquidation), with the immediate appointment of a trustee to manage the financial estate. Following a trial on the motion in August 2006, the case was immediately converted with trustee Richard M. Fogel appointed on September 5, 2006. Neary, William T. (September 5, 2006).

Stoller has also moved to disqualify the trustee on the grounds that he is biased and prejudiced against Stoller and not operating within the best interest of the estate. The court denied Stoller's motion, and Stoller's appeal was denied. On October 5, 2006, trustee Richard M. Fogel's authority was extended to include actions as sole shareholder of all corporate entities owned or controlled by Stoller, See USPTO Agreed Motion to Dismiss in Opposition No. 91164582 at Page 3: Order authorizing the Trustee to act on behalf of debtor's owned corporations and related relief.] October 12, 2006. thus relieving Stoller of his ability to act as a representative of his corporations or proprietorships.

Built in 1738, the house is notable as the only surviving house associated with statesman John Hancock, who lived here for several years as a child. It played a prominent role in the Battle of Lexington and Concord as both Hancock and Samuel Adams, leaders of the colonials, were staying in the house before the battle. The House is operated as a museum by the Lexington Historical Society. It is open weekends starting in mid-April and daily from May 30-October 31. An admission fee is charged. ==Hancock and Clarke history== The Reverend John Hancock, grandfather of the American revolutionary leader of the same name, purchased this site in 1699. In 1738 he built this two-story timber-frame house. Rev. Hancock's son, Thomas, a wealthy Boston merchant, is said to have financed the construction. The front or main portion of the house consists of the -story structure with central chimney, a short center hall, two rooms on each of the two floors, and an attic. The small rear ell, stories high with gambrel roof, contains a kitchen and tiny study downstairs and two low-studded chambers upstairs. As confirmed by tree-ring dating (dendrochronology), both portions of the house were built from trees felled in the same year, refuting a commonly held belief that the ell was built in 1698. Succeeding Hancock as minister in 1752, the Reverend Jonas Clarke, who reared 12 children in the parsonage, was an eloquent supporter of the colonial cause. This house is the only surviving residence associated with John Hancock, famous American patriot, President of the Continental Congress, first signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, and the first Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. It became his boyhood home in 1744 when, upon the death of his father at Quincy, the seven-year-old boy came to live at this house with his grandfather. In 1750 John joined his childless uncle, Thomas Hancock, a wealthy Boston merchant who adopted him. On the evening of April 18, 1775, John Hancock and Samuel Adams, having attended the Massachusetts Provincial Congress in Concord and wary of returning to Boston, were guests of Rev. Clarke. Fearing that they might be captured by the British, Dr. Joseph Warren of Boston dispatched William Dawes and Paul Revere to Lexington with news of the advancing British troops. Arriving separately, they stopped to warn Hancock and Adams around midnight, then set off for Concord. Hancock and Adams made their way to Burlington to avoid capture. ==Later history== The house remained in the Clarke family until 1844, maintained by Rev. Clarke's daughters. It thereafter changed hands several times before being acquired by the Lexington Historical Society. The building was threatened with demolition in 1896, at which time the society purchased it and moved it across the street. In 1974, after purchasing the original site, the society moved it back to its original location. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1971, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This house contains furnishings and portraits owned by the Hancock and Clarke families and an exhibit area that includes relics of April 19, 1775. ==See also== *List of National Historic Landmarks in Massachusetts *National Register of Historic Places listings in Middlesex County, Massachusetts ==References== == External links == * Lexington Historical Society Category:Houses completed in 1737 Category:American Revolutionary War sites Category:Buildings and structures in Lexington, Massachusetts Category:National Historic Landmarks in Massachusetts Category:Historic house museums in Massachusetts Category:Museums in Middlesex County, Massachusetts Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Middlesex County, Massachusetts Category:American Revolutionary War museums in Massachusetts ","title":"Hancock‚ÄìClarke House"},{"id":"2202779","text":"Maria (born Maria Jensen on May 13, 1978) is a Danish singer and songwriter. Born in Denmark, she grew up living in different parts of Europe.

She was eventually discovered and signed by Soulshock, from the writing and production duo Soulshock & Karlin, to Soulpower/Dreamworks Records. Her first single \\"I Give, You Take\\" was released in 2003 and received success on R&B;/Top 40 radio. It reached #33 on the Billboard Pop 100 chart. Her debut album, My Soul was released in September 2003. Dreamworks failed to follow up with promotion for a second single, and she was let go when Dreamworks Records was sold, shortly before the label folded. Afterwards, she ended up studying acting in New York, and doing other ventures such as voiceover work, and writing for other artists (such as Mikkel Solnado's album It's Only Love, Give It Away). She collaborated with producer Holbek (alias Steen Rock) on the song ‚ÄúHudl√∏s‚Äù from his album Frit L√∏b in 2011.

He served as the executive vice president of baseball operations in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 2005 to 2010, before going on to serve as the executive vice president for baseball development from 2010 to 2012. He announced plans in September 2020 to head a subdivision of a private equity firm that would invest in start-up tech firms connected to sports, but died several weeks later. ==Early life and education== Solomon was born and raised in Thompsons, Texas, a small town located about 35 miles southwest of Houston with a population of 246 people, according to the 2010 Census. He was one of six children born to Jimmie Lee Solomon Sr., a farmer, and his wife Josephine, who worked at K-Mart in Houston. His grandfather, Jeremiah, was his earliest and most influential role model, as he was college educated and continually encouraged the young Jimmie Lee to excel academically. Solomon was a graduate of Lamar Consolidated High School in Rosenberg, Texas, held a J.D.https://www.martindale.com/attorney/jimmie-lee-solomon-jr-351460/ degree from Harvard Law School and earned a Bachelor of Arts at Dartmouth College. He played for the Dartmouth football team and established the university's record for the sixty-meter dash. ==Career== Solomon became MLB's Director of Minor League Operations in 1991. He subsequently was promoted to executive director of Minor League Operations and then to senior VP of Baseball Operations. He oversaw major, minor and international baseball operations; the MLB scouting bureau, the Arizona Fall League, and numerous special projects, including the launching of the MLB Youth Academy at Compton College, California. The All- Star Futures Game was conceived by Solomon. Looking for an event to showcase the minor leagues and round out the All-Star week festivities, Solomon looked at the National Basketball Association rookie game and the National Football League's rookie flag football game and thought of the idea. Since 1999, the Futures Game has become a big event for teams' player development departments, a coveted resume filler for players and programming for ESPN2. Rosters for the Futures Game are selected by Baseball America magazine, in conjunction with MLB and the 30 clubs. Every organization is represented, with no more than two players from any organization. In 2003, Solomon was included in Sports Illustrateds list of the 101 Most Influential Minorities in Sports. Solomon was named executive vice president of Baseball Operations on June 1, 2005. Commissioner Bud Selig made the announcement in a press release. As executive VP, Solomon was responsible for such additional areas as on-field discipline, security, and management of facilities. Solomon's biggest project was the construction of baseball academies in urban areas. Currently there are academies in Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and throughout Latin America. This is where young Latino prospects are discovered and trained. Seeing the level of success that Latinos are experiencing in baseball, Solomon decided to bring the academies to the United States and he was working with major league teams, encouraging them to build academies in large American cities to reintroduce baseball to urban children. On August 7, 2007, Solomon was in attendance during the game in which Barry Bonds broke the all-time home run record previously held by Hank Aaron in place of Selig. In June 2010, Solomon became MLB's executive vice president for baseball development, putting him in control of academies in the United States and Puerto Rico run by MLB, minor league operations and the Civil Rights Game held annually. Solomon resigned from his role with Major League Baseball on June 12. Former Yankees and Dodgers manager Joe Torre was appointed as his successor in the executive vice president of Baseball Operations position. ==Later life== Solomon announced that he would become president of Playrs, a branch of the private equity firm Turn2 Equity Partners, in late September 2020. The group included other MLB individuals such as manager Dusty Baker, as well as general managers Jim Duquette and Bobby Evans. However, he died several weeks later at his home in Houston, on October 8, 2020. He was 64; the cause of death is not known. == Citations == == Sources== *Official website of Jimmie Lee Solomon *Baseball America *Dartmouth College *Ivy League Sports *PBS ‚Äì Baseball Blues Category:1956 births Category:2020 deaths Category:African-American lawyers Category:African-American sports executives and administrators Category:American sports executives and administrators Category:Arizona Fall League Category:Dartmouth Big Green football players Category:Dartmouth College alumni Category:Harvard Law School alumni Category:Major League Baseball central office executives Category:Major League Baseball Executive Vice Presidents for Baseball Operations Category:People from Fort Bend County, Texas Category:Texas lawyers ","title":"Jimmie Lee Solomon"},{"id":"2202805","text":"Polaris spaceship The Space Explorers is an animated science fiction feature film which was later converted to a cartoon serial.

The first animated film series was first shown in 1958 on nationwide television shows such as Claude Kirchner's on WWOR-TV, Captain Kangaroo, Captain Video (DuMont), Captain Satellite, Sheriff John, Officer Joe Bolton, Romper Room and many others. The cartoon, which featured Jimmy, Smitty and Professor Leon Nordheim on board the Polaris spaceship, taught space-related concepts.

In April 1925, it sank in a heavy storm during a voyage from Boston, USA, to Hamburg, Germany, with a cargo of wheat and a crew of thirty-eight, all of whom were lost.Jay Sivell. Wordpress.com ==The sinking== The Raifuku Maru had sailed out of Boston on 18 April 1925. On 21 April, it sailed into a heavy storm, and the cargo of wheat began to shift, causing the ship to take on an increasing list to one side. The RMS Homeric, a liner of the White Star Line, and several other vessels received the following communication from the Japanese ship's wireless operator, Masao Hiwatari: \\"Now very danger! Come quick!\\" Despite the broken English of the Japanese crewmen, it was obvious that the vessel was in trouble. The Homeric (along with the British vessel King Alexander) tried desperately to reach the Raifuku Maru, but was unable to get close enough to rescue any crew due to the rough seas. The vessel was listing at a 30-degree angle, and sank with all hands while the Homerics crew and passengers watched. The Homeric sent the following message to the Camperdown Signal Station: \\"OBSERVED STEAMER RAIFUKU MARU SINK IN LAT 4143N LONG 6139W REGRET UNABLE TO SAVE ANY LIVES.\\" Several vessels attempted to locate bodies or survivors from the ship in the days after the sinking, but found none.G. Roscoe Spurgeon \\"Radio Stations Common? Not This Kind\\" coastalradio.co.uk The incident was quite controversial at the time; when the Homeric arrived in New York, several of the passengers publicly accused the crew of the Homeric of not making enough effort to save the Raifuku Marus crewmen. This was taken up by the Japanese government, who accused the English captains of racism for not saving their crewmen. However this was strenuously denied by the crew of the Homeric and the White Star Line who argued that they had made every effort to rescue the crew. ==Myths and legends== Several early reports of the incident, including those of the Associated Press, claimed that Hiwatari sent a frantic message reading \\"Danger like dagger now!\\" The source of this quote is unknown, since it isn't included in radio logs or official records of the incident, but appears in many early accounts of the Raifuku Maru's sinking.Christopher Saunders, \\"Things That Are Not: The Raifuku Maru, from Tragedy to Myth\\".

Science fiction magazines traditionally featured speculative fiction in short story, novelette, novella or (usually serialized) novel form, a format that continues into the present day. Many also contain editorials, book reviews or articles, and some also include stories in the fantasy and horror genres. ==History of science fiction magazines== Malcolm Edwards and Peter Nicholls write that early magazines were not known as science fiction: \\"if there were any need to differentiate them, the terms scientific romance or 'different stories' might be used, but until the appearance of a magazine specifically devoted to sf there was no need of a label to describe the category. The first specialized English-language pulps with a leaning towards the fantastic were Thrill Book (1919) and Weird Tales (1923), but the editorial policy of both was aimed much more towards weird- occult fiction than towards sf.\\" Major American science fiction magazines include Amazing Stories, Astounding Science Fiction, Galaxy Science Fiction, The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction and Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine. The most influential British science fiction magazine was New Worlds; newer British SF magazines include Interzone and Polluto. Many science fiction magazines have been published in languages other than English, but none has gained worldwide recognition or influence in the world of anglophone science fiction. There is a growing trend toward important work being published first on the Internet, both for reasons of economics and access. A web-only publication can cost as little as one-tenth of the cost of publishing a print magazine, and as a result, some believe the e-zines are more innovative and take greater risks with material. Moreover, the magazine is internationally accessible, and distribution is not an issue‚Äîthough obscurity may be. Magazines like Strange Horizons, Ideomancer, InterGalactic Medicine Show, Jim Baen's Universe, and the Australian magazine Andromeda Spaceways Inflight Magazine are examples of successful Internet magazines. (Andromeda provides copies electronically or on paper.) Web-based magazines tend to favor shorter stories and articles that are easily read on a screen, and many of them pay little or nothing to the authors, thus limiting their universe of contributors. However, multiple web-based magazines are listed as \\"paying markets\\" by the SFWA, which means that they pay the \\"professional\\" rate of 8c/word or more. These magazines include popular titles such as Strange Horizons, InterGalactic Medicine Show, and Clarkesworld Magazine. The SFWA publishes a list of qualifying magazine and short fiction venues that contains all current web-based qualifying markets. The World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon) awarded a Hugo Award each year to the best science fiction magazine, until that award was changed to one for Best Editor in the early 1970s; the Best Semi-Professional Magazine award can go to either a news- oriented magazine or a small press fiction magazine. Magazines were the only way to publish science fiction until about 1950, when large mainstream publishers began issuing science fiction books. Today, there are relatively few paper-based science fiction magazines, and most printed science fiction appears first in book form. Science fiction magazines began in the United States, but there were several major British magazines and science fiction magazines that have been published around the world, for example in France and Argentina. ==The first science fiction magazines== March 1941 cover of the Science Fiction magazine, volume 2, issue 4 The first science fiction magazine, Amazing Stories, was published in a format known as bedsheet, roughly the size of Life but with a square spine. Later, most magazines changed to the pulp magazine format, roughly the size of comic books or National Geographic but again with a square spine. Now, most magazines are published in digest format, roughly the size of Reader's Digest, although a few are in the standard roughly 8.5\\" x 11\\" size, and often have stapled spines, rather than glued square spines. Science fiction magazines in this format often feature non-fiction media coverage in addition to the fiction. Knowledge of these formats is an asset when locating magazines in libraries and collections where magazines are usually shelved according to size. The premiere issue of Amazing Stories (April 1926), edited and published by Hugo Gernsback, displayed a cover by Frank R. Paul illustrating Off on a Comet by Jules Verne. After many minor changes in title and major changes in format, policy and publisher, Amazing Stories ended January 2005 after 607 issues. Except for the last issue of Stirring Science Stories, the last true bedsheet size sf (and fantasy) magazine was Fantastic Adventures, in 1939, but it quickly changed to the pulp size, and it was later absorbed by its digest- sized stablemate Fantastic in 1953. Before that consolidation, it ran 128 issues. Much fiction published in these bedsheet magazines, except for classic reprints by writers such as H. G. Wells, Jules Verne and Edgar Allan Poe, is only of antiquarian interest. Some of it was written by teenage science fiction fans, who were paid little or nothing for their efforts. Jack Williamson for example, was 19 when he sold his first story to Amazing Stories. His writing improved greatly over time, and until his death in 2006, he was still a publishing writer at age 98. Some of the stories in the early issues were by scientists or doctors who knew little or nothing about writing fiction, but who tried their best, for example, Dr. David H. Keller. Probably the two best original sf stories ever published in a bedsheet science fiction magazine were \\"A Martian Odyssey\\" by Stanley G. Weinbaum and \\"The Gostak and the Doshes\\" by Dr. Miles Breuer, who influenced Jack Williamson. \\"The Gostak and the Doshes\\" is one of the few stories from that era still widely read today. Other stories of interest from the bedsheet magazines include the first Buck Rogers story, Armageddon 2419 A.D, by Philip Francis Nowlan, and The Skylark of Space by coauthors E. E. Smith and Mrs. Lee Hawkins Garby, both in Amazing Stories in 1928. There have been a few unsuccessful attempts to revive the bedsheet size using better quality paper, notably Science-Fiction Plus edited by Hugo Gernsback (1952‚Äì53, eight issues). Astounding on two occasions briefly attempted to revive the bedsheet size, with 16 bedsheet issues in 1942‚Äì1943 and 25 bedsheet issues (as Analog, including the first publication of Frank Herbert's Dune) in 1963‚Äì1965. The fantasy magazine Unknown, also edited by John W. Campbell, changed its name to Unknown Worlds and published ten bedsheet-size issues before returning to pulp size for its final four issues. Amazing Stories published 36 bedsheet size issues in 1991‚Äì1999, and its last three issues were bedsheet size, 2004‚Äì2005. ==The pulp era== Astounding Stories began in January 1930. After several changes in name and format (Astounding Science Fiction, Analog Science Fact & Fiction, Analog) it is still published today (though it ceased to be pulp format in 1943). Its most important editor, John W. Campbell, Jr., is credited with turning science fiction away from adventure stories on alien planets and toward well-written, scientifically literate stories with better characterization than in previous pulp science fiction. Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy and Robert A. Heinlein's Future History in the 1940s, Hal Clement's Mission of Gravity in the 1950s, and Frank Herbert's Dune in the 1960s, and many other science fiction classics all first appeared under Campbell's editorship. By 1955, the pulp era was over, and some pulp magazines changed to digest size. Printed adventure stories with colorful heroes were relegated to the comic books. This same period saw the end of radio adventure drama (in the United States). Later attempts to revive both pulp fiction and radio adventure have met with very limited success, but both enjoy a nostalgic following who collect the old magazines and radio programs. Many characters, most notably The Shadow, were popular both in pulp magazines and on radio. Most pulp science fiction consisted of adventure stories transplanted, without much thought, to alien planets. Pulp science fiction is known for clich√©s such as stereotypical female characters, unrealistic gadgetry, and fantastic monsters of various kinds. However, many classic stories were first published in pulp magazines. For example, in the year 1939, all of the following renowned authors sold their first professional science fiction story to magazines specializing in pulp science fiction: Isaac Asimov, Robert A. Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, Alfred Bester, Fritz Leiber, A. E. van Vogt and Theodore Sturgeon. These were among the most important science fiction writers of the pulp era, and all are still read today. ==Digest-sized magazines== After the pulp era, digest size magazines dominated the newsstand. The first sf magazine to change to digest size was Astounding, in 1943. Other major digests, which published more literary science fiction, were The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, Galaxy Science Fiction and If. Under the editorship of Cele Goldsmith, Amazing and Fantastic changed in notable part from pulp style adventure stories to literary science fiction and fantasy. Goldsmith published the first professionally published stories by Roger Zelazny (not counting student fiction in Literary Cavalcade), Keith Laumer, Thomas M. Disch, Sonya Dorman and Ursula K. Le Guin. There was also no shortage of digests that continued the pulp tradition of hastily written adventure stories set on other planets. Other Worlds and Imaginative Tales had no literary pretensions. The major pulp writers, such as Heinlein, Asimov and Clarke, continued to write for the digests, and a new generation of writers, such as Algis Budrys and Walter M. Miller, Jr., sold their most famous stories to the digests. A Canticle for Leibowitz, written by Walter M. Miller, Jr., was first published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. Most digest magazines began in the 1950s, in the years between the film Destination Moon, the first major science fiction film in a decade, and the launching of Sputnik, which sparked a new interest in space travel as a real possibility. Most survived only a few issues. By 1960, in the United States, there were only six sf digests on newsstands, in 1970 there were seven, in 1980 there were five, in 1990 only four and in 2000 only three. ==British science fiction magazines== The first British science fiction magazine was Tales of Wonder, pulp size, 1937‚Äì1942, 16 issues, (unless you count Scoops, a tabloid boys' paper that published 20 weekly issues in 1934). It was followed by two magazines, both named Fantasy, one pulp size publishing three issues in 1938‚Äì1939, the other digest size, publishing three issues in 1946‚Äì1947. The British science fiction magazine, New Worlds, published three pulp size issues in 1946‚Äì1947, before changing to digest size. With these exceptions, the pulp phenomenon, like the comic book, was largely a US format. By 2007, the only surviving major British science fiction magazine is Interzone, published in \\"magazine\\" format, although small press titles such as PostScripts and Polluto are available. ==Transition from print to online science fiction magazines== During recent decades, the circulation of all digest science fiction magazines has steadily decreased. New formats were attempted, most notably the slick-paper stapled magazine format, the paperback format and the webzine. There are also various semi- professional magazines which persist on sales of a few thousand copies but often publish important fiction. As the circulation of the traditional US science fiction magazines has declined, new magazines have sprung up online from international small-press publishers. An editor on the staff of Science Fiction World, China's longest-running science fiction magazine, claimed in 2009 that, with \\"a circulation of 300,000 copies per issue\\", it was \\"the World's most-read SF periodical\\", although subsequent news suggests that circulation dropped precipitously after the firing of its chief editor in 2010 and the departure of other editors. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America lists science fiction periodicals that pay enough to be considered professional markets. ==List of current magazines== For a complete list, including defunct magazines, see List of science fiction magazines. ===American magazines === * Abyss & Apex Magazine, 2003‚Äìpresent * Analog Science Fiction and Fact (a.k.a.

The SIP, developed by a state agency and approved by EPA, consists of narrative, rules, technical documentation, and agreements that an individual state will use to control and clean up polluted areas.‚ÄúEarly Implementation of the Clean Air Act of 1970 in California.‚Äù EPA Alumni Association. Video, Transcript (see p6). July 12, 2016. ==Lowest achievable emissions rate== The Lowest achievable emissions rate (LAER) is used by the EPA to determine if emissions from a new or modified major stationary source are acceptable under SIP guidelines. LAER standards are required when a new stationary source is located in a non-attainment air-quality region. It is the most stringent air pollution standard above the best available control technology and reasonably available control technology standards. ==Best available control technology== Best available control technology (BACT) is a pollution control standard mandated by the Clean Air Act: :..an emission limitation based on the maximum degree of reduction of each pollutant subject to regulation under this Act emitted from or which results from any major emitting facility, which the permitting authority, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for such facility through application of production processes and available methods, systems, and techniques, including fuel cleaning, clean fuels, or treatment or innovative fuel combustion techniques for control of each such pollutant.United States. Clean Air Act, section 169(3). \\"Definitions.\\" The EPA determines what air pollution control technology will be used to control a specific pollutant to a specified limit. When a BACT is determined, factors such as energy consumption, total source emission, regional environmental impact, and economic costs are taken into account. It is the current EPA standard for all polluting sources that fall under the New Source Review guidelines and is determined on a case-by-case basis. The BACT standard is significantly more stringent than the reasonably available control technology standard but much less stringent than the lowest achievable emissions rate standard. ==Reasonably available control technology== Reasonably available control technology (RACT) is a pollution control standard created by the EPA and is used to determine what air pollution control technology will be used to control a specific pollutant to a specified limit. RACT applies to existing sources in areas that are not meeting national ambient air quality standards on controlled air pollutants and is required on all sources that meet these criteria. The RACT standard is less stringent than either the BACT or the LAER standard set forth by the EPA. ==Example: Ohio State Implementation Plan== In Ohio, between 1970 and 1977, a rule in the Clean Air Act required a reduction in the measured sulfur dioxide (SO2) emitted by coal-fired power plants. The State Implementation Plan to decrease the SO2 emitted by such plants was to increase the height of the smokestacks on the plants. The result was that the SO2 was carried in the wind out of the state and there was a reduction in the measured SO2 in the area near the source. In the 1977 amendments to the Act, Congress restricted the use of tall smokestacks as a means to attain compliance in SIPs.Clean Air Act, section 123. \\"Stack heights.\\" ==See also== * Appropriate technology * National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) * New Source Performance Standard ==References== ==External links == * Basic Information About SIPs - EPA * RACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse - EPA * Texas SIP * Massachusetts SIP Category:Emission standards Category:Environmental law in the United States Category:Air pollution in the United States Category:United States Environmental Protection Agency Category:United States federal environmental legislation ","title":"State Implementation Plan"},{"id":"2202835","text":"Rob Williams is a Welsh comics writer, working mainly for 2000 AD. He is currently writing books for DC Comics and its Vertigo imprint. ==Career== Williams started out as a freelance journalist and creator of corporate videos. It's a Droids Life: Rob Williams, 2000 AD online, 28 May 2008 He decided to try comics writing resulting in Cla$$war, published by Com.x and illustrated by several artists, including Trevor Hairsine and Travel Foreman. Publishing began in 2002 and, after a three-year hiatus from the publisher a complete collection was released in 2009. The comic series was read by Andy Diggle, who was the editor of 2000 AD at the time and contacted Williams, resulting in a number of comics: the two-part Asylum, with Boo Cook, the ongoing Low Life, initially with Henry FlintHenry Flint Lowlife at 2000AD , Comicon.com, 11 February 2004 and one-offs like Breathing Space with Laurence Campbell.Rob Williams & Laurence Campbell Get A little Breathing Space , Comics Bulletin, 8 August 2005 He would again team up with Campbell for the 2006 Wolverine Christmas SpecialRob Williams Pits Wolverine Against Christmess!, Comicon.com, 11 December 2006 and later a PunisherMAX one-shot. Williams would then go on to get other work for Marvel Comics, including a story in the Dark X-Men: The Beginning anthology, a Captain Britain story in Deadpool Team Up and a Ghost Rider one-shot that ties into the Daredevil storyline Shadowland. He returned to Ghost Rider with a new eponymous ongoing series, launched as part of the \\"Fear Itself\\" storyline, for which he also wrote the Uncanny X-Force mini-series. Other Marvel comics announced around the same time include The Iron Age metaseries, Skaar: King of the Savage Land limited series, and takes over the writing of the Daken: Dark Wolverine ongoing series.

Oil on canvas (1822-1824), 2615 x 3685 mm. National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, London The Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 is an 1822 painting by British artist J. M. W. Turner. It was commissioned by King George IV as a part of a series of works to decorate three state reception rooms in St James's Palace and link the Hanoverian dynasty with military success. This work was Turner's only royal commission, and was to stand as the pendant piece to Philippe-Jacques de Loutherbourg's Lord Howe's action, or the Glorious First of June. This massive history painting measures x and was given to Greenwich Hospital shortly after its original installation. The painting now hangs in the National Maritime Museum, also in Greenwich, London. ==History== This work depicts a scene from the Battle of Trafalgar, a naval battle fought between the British and Franco- Spanish fleet off Cape Trafalgar in southwest Spain. The British had twenty- seven ships to the thirty-three of the Franco-Spanish fleet. Despite this, the British came out as decisively victorious and captured or destroyed nineteen of the Franco-Spanish ships. Admiral Nelson, of the British Navy, took an unconventional approach to this battle and split his fleet into two lines, one led by his flagship Victory and the other by his subordinate Collingwood, to attack the Franco-Spanish fleet in columns perpendicular to their line. At the height of the battle Nelson was shot from a nearby French ship and mortally wounded. Despite this upsetting death, the victory at Trafalgar represented a crucial naval victory for the British. Their dominance effectively established them as the great naval power and ended Napoleon‚Äôs plans to conquer England. The significance of this battle for British history cannot be overstated. Afterwards, many citizens called for a government commissioned work of art depicting the battle. This reflected the role of the history painting and the artist by demonstrating the virtue of the hero, Lord Nelson, to the entire nation. The importance of Nelson and his tactics are referenced in Victorys dominating position in the scene, the execution as a history painting, and Turner's care in rendering all elements of the scene. ==Role as an history painting== 'Twas in Trafalgar's Bay' (Turner's 'Trafalgar' explained by a Greenwich Pensioner) A history painting is traditionally defined as a large- scale work depicting a scene from the Bible, mythology, or classical history. Generally regarded as the height of artistic genres, Turner recognizes this and paints The Battle of Trafalgar as a history painting depicting a contemporary event and as a patchwork scene composed of different moments portrayed as being simultaneous. Turner knows the importance of this genre and employs it to further the significance of the contemporary scene. This action firmly cements the work as being of great national significance and affirms Britain as a great maritime power. In the pursuit of these ideals and significance, Turner took several moments from the battle, across several days, and merged them into one moment in one scene. This then represents Turner's desire to take the battle and use it to create something of general, philosophical, and national significance. This aspect, along with the pyramidal composition reference triumph and sacrifice reaffirm this work's place as a history painting, despite it not depicting one scene from ancient history, religion, or mythology. ==Studies== The British were attempting to establish themselves as a major maritime power; with their victory in this battle they were successful and with this painting that becomes evident. Turner had a great deal of personal interest and investment in this work and with the history of the Battle of Trafalgar in general. Turner made several sketches immediately after the battle, careful studies of the ships and their rigging, and close details of the uniforms. The most notable of these early works was The Battle of Trafalgar, as Seen from the Mizen Starboard Shrouds of the Victory. This work was well received and provided the foundation from which Turner would develop Trafalgar into a scene representing an overall account of the whole battle. This earlier depiction is closer to Turner‚Äôs style in that it leans away from traditional maritime paintings and more toward the ambiguity and sublime that Turner would later be known for. In preparation for Trafalgar Turner created two preparatory oil sketches, with the First Sketch for ‚ÄòThe Battle of Trafalgar‚Äô aligning its composition with the traditional maritime paintings. The Second Sketch for ‚ÄòThe Battle of Trafalgar‚Äô moves away from this traditional style and more closely resembles his final product with a more organized chaos via the build-up of clouds and people in the foreground. Despite this work being a commission, Turner chooses to depict the final work in a style that moves away from conventional practices and closer to his original work and personal style further indicating his personal connection with Trafalgar. While the subject of the piece is evident, there are elements of ambiguity suggesting the sublime, the dissolution of space via strokes of pure paint, and the symmetry between human and natural forces. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * ==External links== *Description page at the National Maritime Museum website.

It is a white crystalline material but often is encountered in an impure form that is brown and non-crystalline powder.

It crystallizes in the rock salt structure as its most stable phase, its zinc blende and wurtzite structures can be prepared by molecular beam epitaxy. The chemical properties of MgS resemble those of related ionic sulfides such as those of sodium, barium, or calcium. It reacts with oxygen to form the corresponding sulfate, magnesium sulfate. MgS reacts with water to give hydrogen sulfide and magnesium hydroxide.Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. \\"Inorganic Chemistry\\" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. . ==Applications== In the BOS steelmaking process, sulfur is the first element to be removed. Sulfur is removed from the impure blast furnace iron by the addition of several hundred kilograms of magnesium powder by a lance. Magnesium sulfide is formed, which then floats on the molten iron and is removed.Irons, G. A.; Guthrie, R. I.

He is one of the eponyms of the Rao‚ÄìBlackwell theorem.Roussas, G.G. et al. (2011) A Tribute to David Blackwell, NAMS 58(7), 912‚Äì928. He was the first African American inducted into the National Academy of Sciences, the first black tenured faculty member at UC Berkeley, and the seventh African American to receive a Ph.D. in Mathematics. Blackwell was also a pioneer in textbook writing. He wrote one of the first Bayesian textbooks, his 1969 Basic Statistics. By the time he retired, he had published over 90 books and papers on dynamic programming, game theory, and mathematical statistics. == Education and early life == David Harold Blackwell was born on April 24, 1919, in Centralia, Illinois to Mabel Johnson Blackwell, a full-time homemaker, and Grover Blackwell, an Illinois Central Railroad worker. He was the eldest of four children. Growing up in an integrated community, Blackwell attended ‚Äúmixed‚Äù schools, where he distinguished himself in mathematics. During elementary school, his teachers promoted him beyond his grade level on two occasions. It was in a high school geometry course, however, that his passion for math began. An exceptional student, Blackwell graduated high school in 1935 at the age of sixteen. Blackwell entered the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with the intent to study elementary school mathematics and become a teacher. In 1938 he earned his bachelor's degree in mathematics and a master's degree in 1939, and was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy in mathematics in 1941 at the age of 22, all by the University of Illinois. Blackwell was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. ==Career and research== Blackwell did a year of postdoctoral research as a fellow at Institute for Advanced Study in 1941 after receiving a Rosenwald Fellowship. There he met John von Neumann, who asked Blackwell to discuss his Ph.D. thesis with him. Blackwell, who believed that von Neumann was just being polite and not genuinely interested in his work, did not approach him until von Neumann himself asked him again a few months later. According to Blackwell, \\"He (von Neumann) listened to me talk about this rather obscure subject and in ten minutes he knew more about it than I did.\\" He departed when he was prevented from attending lectures or undertaking research at nearby Princeton University (which the IAS has historically collaborated with in research and scholarship activities) because of his race. From left to right: Abdulalim Shabazz, David Blackwell, and J. Ernest Wilkins Jr. at the Conference for African American Researchers in the Mathematical Sciences (CAARMS) in June 1995. Seeking a permanent position, he wrote letters of application to 105 historically black colleges and universities. He felt at the time that a black professor would be limited to teaching only at black colleges. He also sought a position at the University of California, Berkeley, and was interviewed by statistician Jerzy Neyman. While Neyman supported his appointment, Griffith C. Evans (the head of the mathematics department) objected, citing the concerns of his wife. It was customary for them to invite all the members of the department over for dinner and \\"she was not going to have any darkie in her house.\\" ===Howard University=== He was offered a post at Southern University at Baton Rouge, which he held in 1942‚Äì43, followed by a year as an Instructor at Clark College in Atlanta. He then moved to Howard University in 1944 and within three years was appointed full professor and head of the Mathematics Department. He remained at Howard until 1954. From 1948 to 1950, Blackwell spent his summers at RAND Corporation with Meyer A. Girshick and other mathematicians exploring the theory of duels. In 1954 Girshick and Blackwell published Theory of Games and Statistical Decisions. Blackwell wrote one of the first Bayesian textbooks, his 1969 Basic Statistics. Blackwell's Basic Statistics inspired the 1995 textbook Statistics: A Bayesian Perspective by the biostatistician Donald Berry. ===UC Berkeley=== He took a position at the University of California, Berkeley as a visiting professor in 1954, and was hired as a full professor in the newly created Statistics Department in 1955, becoming the Statistics department chair in 1956. He spent the rest of his career at UC Berkeley, retiring in 1988. In 2018, UC Berkeley named an undergraduate residence hall in his honor. David Blackwell Hall opened in Fall 2018. ===Honors and awards=== * Invited Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians, 1954 * President, Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 1956 * Elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) 1965 * Elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS) 1968 * President of the Bernoulli Society for Mathematical Statistics and Probability, 1975-1977 * Honorary Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) in 1976 * Vice President of the American Statistical Association (ASA) in 1978 * Awarded John von Neumann Theory Prize in 1979 * Awarded the R.

Buckman Tavern in 1929 ==History== The tavern was built in about 1709‚Äì1710 by Benjamin Muzzey (1657‚Äì1735), and with license granted in 1693 was the first public house in Lexington. Muzzey ran it for years, then his son John, and then at the time of the battle it was run by John's granddaughter and her husband John Buckman, a member of the Lexington Training Band. In those years the tavern was a favorite gathering place for militiamen on days when they trained on the Lexington Green. (Lexington, unlike other local communities, did not establish a minuteman company, instead maintaining a \\"training band\\" [an old English phrase for a militia company] for local defense).Fischer, David Hackett. Paul Revere's Ride, p. 395, Oxford University Press, New York, NY, 1994. . ===Battles of Lexington and Concord=== The Battle of Lexington and Concord took form before dawn on April 19, 1775. Having received word that the regular army had left Boston in force to seize and destroy military supplies in Concord, several dozen militiamen gathered on the town common, and then eventually went to the tavern to await the arrival of the British troops. Definite word reached them just before sunrise, and Captain Parker's company of militia left the tavern to assemble in two ranks on the common. Following the arrival of the army, a single shot was fired; by whom, it is still unknown. With this shot, the American Revolutionary War began.Fischer, David Hackett.

Although best known as the headquarters of the militia, Buckman Tavern is also noteworthy as perhaps the busiest of Lexington's 18th-century taverns. It housed the first village store in Lexington, and later, in 1813, the first town post office. ==Historic site== The tavern's interior appears today very much as it did in 1775 and one can see the restored 18th-century taproom with large fireplace and central chimney.

The term is used in the Clean Air Act Extension of 1970 (CAA) to refer to air pollution emission standards, and in the Clean Water Act (CWA) referring to standards for water pollution discharges of industrial wastewater to surface waters. == Introduction == Some pollution control laws are organized with varying degrees of stringency. The different standards may be based on several factors, including whether the pollution source is an existing facility at the time the standard is published, or is constructed after publication. The standards for new sources may be more stringent than that for existing facilities, on the principle that a new plant can be designed with the latest and most advanced control technologies. == Clean Air Act == The Clean Air Act NSPS dictate the level of pollution that a new stationary source may produce. These standards are authorized by Section 111 of the CAAUnited States.

EPA issues NSPS for categories of industrial dischargers, typically in conjunction with the issuance of effluent guidelines for existing sources. In developing NSPS, the CWA requires that EPA determine the \\"best available demonstrated control technology\\" (BADCT) for the particular industrial category. BADCT may be more stringent than the best available technology economically achievable standard used for existing dischargers. This consideration may include setting a \\"no discharge of pollutants standard\\" (also called a \\"zero discharge\\" standard) if practicable.U.S. Clean Water Act, section 306(a), .

The present school was founded in 1860 by Philip Reginald Egerton and has since become a member of the Woodard Corporation. The current headmaster is Paul Sanderson, who took over from Mark Allbrook in 2013. The school has approximately 515 pupils. Founded as a school of the Oxford Movement, Bloxham is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference. ==HistoryHewett's school=== The original school on the site in the north of the village of Bloxham was founded in 1853 by John William Hewett (1824-1886), a local Anglo-Catholic curate.Old Bloxhamist Society, 'J. W. Hewett:1853-1857', A History of Bloxham School (H.E. Boddy & Co. Ltd, Banbury, 1978), 1-12. The school was supported by Samuel Wilberforce who commissioned the diocesan architect, George Edmund Street, to draw up plans for the new school buildings.Sherwood & Pevsner, The Buildings of England: Oxfordshire (Penguin Books Ltd, 1974), p. 480-1. Street's design was described by The Gentleman's Magazine as the 'most beautiful modern Gothic buildings ever devoted in England to a scholastic purpose'. The foundation stone was blessed by Wilberforce on 7 June 1855. Hewett's plans were for a school for 100 commoners, 40 scholars and an unspecified number of choristers. In February 1855 a trust for the school was established, naming it All Saints' Grammar School, with the intent of providing for 'the liberal education of the sons of the clergy, gentry, Naval, Military and professional men and others'. Hewett contributed his own extensive library and the bulk of the funds for the ambitious building project. By mid-1856, Hewett was bankrupt and the school had failed to attract sufficient numbers of boys, who were expected to pay unusually high fees. Hewett's school, with several dozen pupils and incomplete buildings, was closed in April 1857. The school trust approached Nathaniel Woodard for help, but he was uninterested in buying or supporting the school. ===Egerton's school=== G. E. Street's plans for Bloxham School. The School from the front, circa 1890, before the construction of the Memorial Arch. In 1859, Hewett's dilapidated school buildings were bought for ¬£1,615 by Philip Reginald Egerton, a Church of England curate working in Deddington. Like Hewett, he was strongly influenced by the Oxford Movement and sought to establish a new school to teach its values.Old Bloxhamist Society, 'P. R. Egerton: The Years of Risk, 1859-1864', A History of Bloxham School (H.E. Boddy & Co. Ltd, Banbury, 1978), 13-30. Egerton adopted the previous foundation's name of All Saints' School, and its motto, but based the school's ethos on that of his alma mater, Winchester College. He sought the backing of several notable academics and clergymen, including Wilberforce, Woodard and Henry Liddon. The project was initially funded by Egerton's wealthy wife, Harriet, and received its first pupil on 31 January 1860. Under the personal leadership of Egerton, Bloxham initially provided education for middle class boys in the public school tradition, although classics was originally not widely taught. In 1861 there were 29 pupils and by 1863 there were 60. Thanks to Wilberforce's continued support, Street drew up new plans for expanding the neo-Gothic school buildings, and additional money was provided by John Hubbard, 1st Baron Addington and John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough. The new buildings were unveiled in 1864 in the presence of Thomas Parker, 6th Earl of Macclesfield and Benjamin Disraeli. The Chapel Wing, the last of Street's buildings, was opened on 21 February 1873. The school quickly grew, rising to two hundred pupils in twenty years. Despite Egerton's plans for the school to provide for local farmers and tradesmen, a report in 1870 found that most of the boys were from professional, ecclesiastical and military families. An 1879 plan by Egerton and Liddon to affiliate the school with Keble College, Oxford never came to fruition, and Egerton was forced to look elsewhere to ensure the school's long-term viability. The Bloxham School Trust was established in 1884, and in 1897 the school was admitted into the Woodard Corporation. Frederick Scobell Boissier, father of Harrow headmaster Arthur Boissier, taught at Bloxham from 1878 to 1898 and was headmaster from 1886. Education at the school focused on the notions of religious and civic duty, and the Anglo-Catholic nature of the foundation of the school remained a defining feature. Proposals to secularise the school by renaming it 'Bloxham College' were rejected in 1911 and 1951. Bloxham's first headmaster to not be a priest was only appointed in 1925.Simon Batten, A Shining Light: 150 Years of Bloxham School (James & James (Publishers) Ltd, 2010) During the 1890s, Bloxham shrank in size as the local provision of state education improved. The Education Act 1902 worsened the situation, as did a growing prejudice against high church practices in schools.Old Bloxhamist Society, 'F. S. Boissier, 1886-1898', A History of Bloxham School (H.E. Boddy & Co. Ltd, Banbury, 1978), 13-30. The school's impressive academic record and high Oxbridge entrant rates in the 1900s helped it to survive. By the 1910s, a prefect system, house rivalries, corporal punishment and fagging confirmed Bloxham's identity as a conforming public school, although the latter two practices were abolished in the 1970s. Like many public schools, Bloxham suffered disproportionately high casualties during the First World War, in which over 400 current and former pupils served and 79 were killed.Old Bloxhamist Society, 'A. R. M. Grier, 1916-1919', A History of Bloxham School (H.E. Boddy & Co. Ltd, Banbury, 1978), 84. The school survived the subsequent economic depression, and embarked upon a series of ambitious educational and building reforms led by the school's first lay headmaster, Armitage. During the 1960s the school pioneered a tutoring system in which boys of multiple year groups shared a tutor. This system has since been imitated by many other boarding schools. Girls started to be admitted into the sixth form in small numbers in the early 1970s and the school became fully co-educational in 1998. The Lower School, for pupils aged 11‚Äì13, was opened in 1994. ==Buildings and facilities== A view over Main Field, with the cricket pavilion to the left and the school chapel in the background. The 'Pig Sty' playing fields beneath Hobb Hill, Bloxham. Bloxham School has grounds which cover approximately in the village of Bloxham. The Neo-Gothic complex of buildings designed by George Edmund Street, called Main School, dominates the school and the north end of the village. It contains two boarding houses, Crake and Wilson, the dining hall, the Masters' Dining Room, the Headmaster's office, the chapel, the 1894 Egerton Library and a number of classrooms. Palmer House, built in 1874 in the Neo-Gothic style, is the school hospital. Egerton House, on the edge of the school campus, was built in 1876 as the Headmaster's House, and was enlarged in 1886. The school's Great Hall was completed in 1937 and was built in the traditional Cotswold style. The Victorian-era Wesley Theatre, a former Methodist chapel, is the school theatre. The Science Block was built between 1959 and 1966. Wilberforce House was built in the late 1960s and Raymond House was opened in 1971 by Margaret Thatcher. Recent building developments include the Raymond Technology Centre, the expansion of the Lower School building and the Vallance Library which was opened by Colin Dexter in April 2006. New squash courts have also been built next to the Dewey Sports Centre, and the art school has been increased in size. The extension to the 1901 music school was completed in the summer of 2007, and officially opened by Aled Jones in November 2008.Simon Batten, A Shining Light: 150 Years of Bloxham School (James & James (Publishers) Ltd, 2010), p. 106 The Lower School is located in a modernised building called The White Lion, a former public house on the edge of the school campus. Bloxham has a Church of England chapel which can accommodate approximately two hundred people. It was built at first-floor level with classrooms beneath, giving it an elevated position. At its west end is a balcony and organ loft, with an octagonal turret containing the bell tower rising above Main School. At the east end of the chapel is a large Te Deum window made by Clayton and Bell in memory of Wilberforce. The chapel also contains a rood screen, windows in memory of Egerton and the Boer Wars, and monuments to the school's war dead. The reredos was designed by Bucknall in 1912. The smaller Liddon Chapel, adjacent to the main chapel, is used as a classroom. Bloxham School has four large playing fields, three of which are used for cricket in the summer term. It has two AstroTurf all-weather pitches, which are used for hockey and tennis, as well as additional hard tennis courts. The Dewey Sports Centre, opened by Anne, Princess Royal in 1986, has an indoor sports hall, a well- equipped gym and a climbing wall. Along with the swimming pool, which was extensively refurbished in 2014, it is available for public use. Bloxham also has Fives courts. Deer Park is where the bursary is situated, as well as some of the buildings used by the CCF, including the armoury and shooting range. Woollen Hale, the house of Bloxham headmasters since 1986, is located on the top of Hobb Hill, overlooking playing fields and the Main School. ==Houses== Wilson House and the Dining Hall, completed in 1869, as viewed from Bloxham High Street. Like most traditional public schools, houses form the basis of school organisation and are incorporated into the boarding system. There are six boarding houses within the senior school. These are Crake, Egerton, Raymond, Seymour, Wilberforce and Wilson, with Raymond and Wilberforce being the girls' houses. There is also a junior boarding house, Park Close, for the first form (Year 7) and second form (Year 8) weekly boarders, but all junior pupils are members of Exham House. The school operates a house based tutor system, in which pupils of several year groups share a tutor within one house. All houses are made up of both boarders and day pupils, who are called 'dayboarders'. House captains are appointed each year and make up part of the school's prefect body. The two oldest houses are Crake and Wilson, previously called School House, with all the other houses constituted later. The newest boarding house to be built was Seymour, which was finished in 1982. Houses provide a focal point for social and sporting activity, with keen rivalries existing between different houses. { - ! House !! Colour !! Gender !! Housemaster/mistress !!

The founder of Bloxham, P. R. Egerton, envisaged Bloxham as a school which would take in the sons of local families and turn out young men ‚Äòwell educated in the Christian faith.‚Äô Religion still plays a major role in the life of the school and this is focussed on the Chapel of All Saints. Two Eucharistic services are held each week for the pupils in the chapel, and Morning Prayer is held every day. For larger school occasions such as Founderstide (the founder's day) and Christmas, the school uses St Mary's Church, Bloxham. The chaplain plays an important part in school life and is helped by a team of chapel prefects. Special arrangements are made for non-Anglicans to attend their own places of worship if required. The school has hosted the Bloxham Festival of Faith and Literature since October 2011.Bloxham Festival of Faith and Literature, 'About Us' http://www.bloxhamfaithandliterature.co.uk/about- us.aspx (Accessed 7 January 2015) ===Bloxham Project=== The Bloxham Project is an inter-school council started in the 1960s to address the role of religion in schools.Simon Batten, A Shining Light: 150 Years of Bloxham School (James & James (Publishers) Ltd, 2010), p. 93 It was started by the Chairman of Bloxham School Council and the school chaplain, Donald Dowie. The first Bloxham Conference on Public School Religion took place in 1967 at Bloxham School, and today approximately 120 independent schools take part in the project. It is a full-time organisation which continues to promote Christian educational values in the United Kingdom. The project is currently run from Ripon College Cuddesdon near Oxford, where several of Bloxham's headmasters have been educated. ==Sport== Bloxham's 1st XI cricket team plays Marylebone Cricket Club in 2010. Sport plays a significant role in Bloxham life, with afternoons on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays being allocated to games' practices and matches for pupils in years 9‚Äì13. Every pupil in the school is involved in sport, with the aim being that each pupil will represent the school in at least one team during their time at Bloxham. The major sports are rugby, hockey and cricket for boys, and hockey, netball and tennis for girls. Other sports played at Bloxham include squash, athletics, swimming, golf, riding, polo, target shooting, clay pigeon shooting, fives, sailing, cross-country and badminton. The school's main sporting rivals include Stowe School, St Edward's School, Oxford, Warwick School, Rugby School and Magdalen College School, Oxford. Bloxham participates annually in the NatWest Schools Cup for rugby union. Bloxham has recently won national titles in shooting, polo and riding, and regional titles in rugby, hockey and sailing. ==Societies and pastimes== The school CCF parade in Bloxham village on Armistice Day, 1965. Bloxham has several societies, some of which are pupil-run. Notable school societies include the Scholars Society, the Debating Society and the Common Room Society. The Choral Society, or Chapel Choir, sing twice a week during the school's chapel services. Clubs include a Photography Club, a Wildlife Club and a Model Railway Club. Bloxham School was host of the British Youth Go Tournament in 2011. Pupils are given the opportunity to take part in many other activities, such as the Duke of Edinburgh Award, drama, community service, dance, adventure training, horse riding and management and horticulture. Many of these run on a Monday, Tuesday and Thursday afternoon in time set aside for school activities. Bloxham runs a Combined Cadet Force (CCF) for pupils in third form (Year 9) and above. This was founded in 1910 as the school's Officers' Training Corps, and under Armitage it became one of the most respected contingents in the country. Bloxham is one of the few schools in the country to have been granted its own cap badge and many former members have served with distinction in the British armed forces. Most terms there is a CCF over-night expedition and a range day. The CCF was formerly affiliated with the Royal Green Jackets and is now affiliated with its successor regiment, The Rifles. The school has a large music department which offers professional tuition in brass, guitar, keyboard, organ, percussion, singing, strings and woodwind. The school magazine is called The Bloxhamist and is now published at the beginning of every Michaelmas term. ==Prefects== The school‚Äôs prefect system was introduced in its current form by Armitage in the late 1920s.Old Bloxhamist Society, A History of Bloxham School (H.E. Boddy & Co. Ltd, Banbury, 1978), 118. Prefects were solemnly initiated in chapel, and once in office they were responsible for much of the daily administration of the school. Prefects were in charge of most discipline and a prefectural code was introduced; school prefects could give up to six strokes with a cane, and house prefects three. Today the school has various grades of prefect, all drawn from the Upper Sixth, each with different responsibilities and privileges: *School captains: One boy and, since coeducation, one girl. They lead the body of school prefects and meet daily with the headmaster. They are called the Head Boy and the Head Girl. *School prefects: Their duties include keeping order, supervising the wellbeing of pupils and representing the school at events. They have numerous privileges. They wear gold trim on their jackets and a black tie with the school crest. *House captains: The senior pupil in each of the boarding houses. They lead the house prefects in their house and represent the house at events. They usually have a larger study in the boarding house, and are usually also school prefects. *School Sacristan: Two prefects, who aid the school‚Äôs chaplain in day-to-day running of the chapel and promotion of the Christian ethos in the school. Leads the pastoral prefects and wears a blue tie with the school crest and cross, and a gold cross badge. May also be a school prefect. *House prefects: A group of six to eight senior pupils in each of the boarding houses. Have duties within the house, including supervising prep, the dormitories and helping to keep order. They wear a black tie with multiple school crests on it, each in the house colour. *Pastoral Prefects: A group of twelve prefects who help to keep order in chapel and promote the Christian ethos in the school. They wear a gold cross badge. ==Motto and arms== The motto of Bloxham School is taken from Hewitt's 1853 school. A quotation from the Book of Proverbs, it is Justorum Semita Lux Splendens (Latin), which translates as \\"The path of the just is a shining light\\". Until 2009, the school arms was that of the Egerton family, although this usage was never registered with the College of Arms. It is now a stylised version of the original coat-of-arms. ==Terms== Bloxham operates a three-term year: *The Michaelmas Term, from early September to mid-December *The Lent Term, from early January to late March *The Summer Term, from late April to late June or early July ==Fees== The yearly fees for a senior full boarding pupil are ¬£30,585 per year, and ¬£23,670 per year for day pupils. This makes Bloxham the third most expensive school in Oxfordshire. ==Notable alumni== Current members of the school are known as 'Bloxhamists' with alumni referred to as 'Old Bloxhamists', or OBs for short. Notable OBs include: Military *Colonel Sir Thomas Boswall Beach CMG CBE *Brigadier-General Sir William Henry Beach CB CMG DSO *Air Vice-Marshal Thomas Bowler CB CBE *General Sir Adrian Bradshaw KCB OBE, Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe *General Sir Edward Burgess, NATO Deputy Supreme Allied Commander *Garrison Sergeant Major Vivian Davenport MBE MC DCM & Bar *Major General Richard Roderick Davis CB CBE *Lieutenant David Eastwood CBE MC *Brigadier-General Wilfred Ellershaw, Aide-de-Camp to Lord Kitchener *Squadron Leader Dave Glaser DFC AE *Colonel L.

As with many public schools, Bloxham suffered a disproportionately high casualty rate during World War I, in which 79 current and former pupils were killed. The portraits of the school's dead of the First World War are hung near the chapel. ==Headmasters== The Founder, Philip Egerton. The first five headmasters at Bloxham were ordained Anglican priests, with the first lay headmaster being appointed in 1925.

She is a Saracen sorceress. ==Description== Rinaldo Enchanted by Armida,left The Rose from Armida's Garden by Marie Spartali Stillman (1894) In Tasso's epic Jerusalem Delivered (), Rinaldo is a fierce and determined warrior who is also honorable and handsome. Armida has been sent to stop the Christians from completing their mission and is about to murder the sleeping soldier, but instead she falls in love. She creates an enchanted garden where she holds him a lovesick prisoner. Eventually Charles and Ubaldo, two of his fellow Crusaders, find him and hold a shield to his face, so he can see his image and remember who he is. Rinaldo barely can resist Armida's pleadings, but his comrades insist that he return to his Christian duties. At the close of the poem, when the pagans have lost the final battle, Rinaldo, remembering his promise to be her champion, prevents her from giving way to her suicidal impulses and offers to restore her to her lost throne. She gives in at this and like the other Saracen woman, Clorinda, earlier in the piece, becomes a Christian and his \\"handmaid\\". Many painters and composers were inspired by Tasso's tale. The works that resulted often added or subtracted an element; Tasso himself continued to edit the story for years. In some versions, Armida is converted to Christianity, in others, she rages and destroys her own enchanted garden. She occupies a place in the literature of abandoned women such as the tragic Dido, who committed suicide, and the evil Circe, whom Odysseus abandoned to return home, but she is considered by many to be more human and thus more compelling and sympathetic than either of them.

(1986). Wonders of Magic: A Veteran Magician's Book of Original Tricks, Concepts, Pictures, Memoirs, and Conjuring History. Ridgeway Press. p. 26 Anderson is credited with helping bring the art of magic from street performances into theatres and presenting magic performances to entertain and delight the audience. ==Career== Anderson was born in The Mearns, Scotland. Orphaned at the age of ten, he started his career appearing on the stage with a travelling dramatic company in 1830. At seventeen, he began performing magic and in 1837, at the age of twenty-three, he performed at the castle of Lord Panmure, whose endorsement of Anderson inspired him to put a touring show together which lasted for three years. In 1840, Anderson settled in London, opening the New Strand Theatre. Sir Walter Scott is said to have given him the stage name, The Great Wizard of the North. Anderson's success came from his extensive use of advertising and popular shows which captivated his audience. The Wizard was committed to philanthropy and expert showmanship, making him one of the earliest magicians to attain a high level of world renown. Anderson declared: \\"It is the duty of all magicians to give entertainment,\\" and he was not content to perform an illusion to simply demonstrate that he could accomplish something that the audience could not explain. If the effect was not enthusiastically received, Anderson would remove it from his act. Anderson is famous for a lifetime of successful performances of the bullet catch illusion. Although he did not invent the trick, he made it widely popular and several of his rivals copied Anderson's version in their own shows. Anderson is also credited to be the first magician to pull a rabbit out of a tophat. The trick had existed before in different forms, yet, Anderson was the first magician that performed this classic trick on stage. Aberdeen, Scotland: The Grave of John Henry Anderson a.k.a. The Wizard Of The North In 1842, Anderson married Hannah Longherst from Aberdeen, an assistant with his show. The following year their son John Henry Jr. was born. In 1845, Anderson's mistress Miss Prentice gave birth to Philip Prentice Anderson, but died in childbirth. Anderson, however, supported the child for his entire life. Anderson would also have two daughters ‚Äì Helen and Alice ‚Äì who assisted in their father's show and later became successful magicians, and a second illegitimate son with a member of his touring troupe. 1845 also saw the completion of Anderson's second theatre, the City Theatre in Glasgow. In November, only four months after opening, the theatre burned and Anderson's financial losses were considerable. Through the aid of his show business friends, Anderson was able to launch a new show at London's Covent Garden Theatre in 1846 and then toured Europe the following year, travelling to Hamburg, Stockholm, and St. Petersburg, where he met Czar Nicholas I, who arranged a command performance for Anderson after an awkward chance meeting. In 1849, Anderson returned to London to perform for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The following year, Anderson toured America, Canada, Australia, and Hawaii. Upon returning to Britain, Anderson found that he had a rival in fellow magician Robert Houdin. Robert-Houdin's inventions were pirated by his trusted mechanic Le Grand who was arrested for making and selling duplicate illusions. Many of those illusions fell into the hands of his competitors like The Great Wizard of the North, Robin, and Compars Herrmann. It is not known whether Anderson or the others bought the illusions directly from LeGrand or from another source. But, they willingly performed the illusions after knowing that those were invented by Robert-Houdin. Herrmann too was performing in London with Robert-Houdin's pirated tricks. Anderson took Houdin's tricks and returned to America in 1853 and performed in Boston. An illusion involving Anderson's dispensing of various alcoholic beverages to the audience caused a legal controversy regarding temperance in that city. In 1859, after a brief period as an actor, Anderson began another world tour. In 1862, at the age of eighteen, John Henry Jr. left his father's troupe and began his own independent career as a conjuror. This started a bitter feud between father and son and the two never spoke again. Greatly in debt, Anderson returned to England in 1864. He would tour once more in 1866. Anderson died in 1874 at the Fleece hotel in Darlington, County Durham. He was buried next to his mother in Aberdeen. Magician Harry Houdini, who was born in the same year as Anderson's death, revered Anderson as one of his inspirations and in 1909 arranged for the upkeep of the gravesite, which had fallen into disrepair. ==Spiritualism== In 1854, Anderson held a farewell performance in Aberdeen. The success of this show was enough to inspire Anderson not to retire. Rather, he began to concentrate his efforts on exposing the tricks of mediums and spiritualist fraud. In his shows, he used his daughters to duplicate spiritualist effects. Anderson was one of the magicians of his day who exposed the frauds of the Davenport brothers. The show played at the Lyceum in London and then moved to Covent Garden in 1855. The following year, after a gala performance, the theatre caught fire, destroying all of Anderson's properties and bankrupting him for the second time in his professional career. Anderson stated that spiritualism was a \\"delusion that has driven ten thousand persons mad in the United States.\\"Lamont, Peter. (2013).

The film stars Wesley Snipes and Bruce Payne. Its success made Snipes a popular action hero icon. It also introduced Snipes' famous line: \\"Always bet on black.\\" ==Plot== International terrorist Charles Rane (Payne), whose career has been dubbed as \\"The Rane of Terror\\" by media, is arrested by the FBI and local authorities in Miami, just as he is about to undergo plastic surgery in order to evade law enforcement. The FBI make plans to return Rane to Los Angeles aboard a Lockheed L-1011 Tristar passenger aircraft, for him to stand trial. Widower John Cutter (Snipes) is a retired United States Secret Service agent and police officer who is constantly haunted by the memories of his wife's death in a convenience store robbery, and has taken to training flight attendants in self defense, including Marti Slayton (Alex Datcher). After one class, Cutter is approached by an old friend, Sly Delvecchio (Tom Sizemore), who offers Cutter the vice presidency of a new antiterrorism unit for his company, Atlantic International Airlines. Cutter is reluctant, but Delvecchio and the company's president, Stuart Ramsey (Bruce Greenwood), convince him to accept the offer. Cutter boards as the 57th passenger on an Atlantic International flight to Los Angeles, where Marti is one of the flight attendants. Rane and his two FBI escorts are also aboard. After the flight takes off, several henchpersons in Rane's employ, posing as flight attendants and passengers, kill the FBI agents, release Rane, and secure the plane by also killing the captain. Cutter, in the lavatory at the time, manages to use the plane's on-board phone to warn Delvecchio of the situation, but Cutter is soon discovered by one of Rane's henchmen. Cutter overpowers the henchman and takes his weapon; he then uses the agent as a shield to confront Rane. Rane is indifferent and shows his ruthlessness by taking a passenger hostage and then killing him without mercy. Rane also shoots his own henchman in a further show of force. Cutter realizes he is outmatched and escapes with Marti to the plane's cargo hold, dispatching another of Rane's men, Vincent, who is disguised as a caterer. Cutter dumps the plane's fuel, forcing Rane to order the surviving pilots to land at a small Louisiana airfield. As Cutter and Marti prepare to jump from the plane as it lands, Marti is caught by Forget and he kicks Cutter out of the plane. The local sheriff, Chief Leonard Biggs (Ernie Lively), arrests Cutter, thinking he is a terrorist, and takes him to the airport building. Rane contacts the field's tower and demands refueling, for which he promises half the passengers will be freed. For every five minutes of resistance or indecision, Rane will order five passengers to be executed. Rane also asserts that Cutter is one of his own men turned against him. Biggs gives the go-ahead for refueling, and as the passengers are freed, Rane and his men escape from the plane, having given orders to those still on board to kill the rest of the hostages if their plans are interfered with. Cutter recognizes the passenger release as a diversion, escapes from the sheriff, and chases Rane and his men into a local county fair. FBI agents arrive and confirm Cutter's true identity to Biggs. Cutter is able to kill one of Rane's men and gets into a fight with Rane before police arrive and capture him. Back at the tower, Rane announces that if he does not contact the plane and give flight clearance, his men aboard have been instructed to kill the rest of the hostages. The FBI agents arrange to return Rane to the plane, escorted by two agents, with plans to have a sniper take down Rane and allow them to storm the plane to save the hostages. However, the sniper is Vincent, who kills the escorts, but is shot dead by Cutter, and Rane makes it inside safely. Rane orders the pilots to take off, while Cutter, with Biggs' help, manages to jump from a car onto the speeding plane before it takes off. Inside, Cutter deals with more of Rane's accomplices before getting into a fight with Rane. Their fight blows out one of the plane's windows and the cabin loses its air pressure, causing a door to be blown out. Cutter manages to get Rane close to the open door and kicks him out of the plane, which sends Rane, screaming in terror, out into the night sky, where he falls to his death. The plane quickly returns to the airfield, where the FBI agents secure Rane's remaining agents and the remaining hostages are freed. Amid congratulations and celebration, Marti and Cutter make their quiet escape into the distance hand-in-hand, but not before Chief Biggs offers them a ride. ==Cast== * Wesley Snipes as John Cutter, a former cop turned airline security expert haunted by the death of his wife. * Bruce Payne as Charles Rane, a sadistic international terrorist mastermind who hijacked the jet to escape custody. * Tom Sizemore as Sly Delvecchio, Cutter's old friend who offers him a high-ranking job. * Alex Datcher as Marti Slayton, a flight attendant on board the jet. * Bruce Greenwood as Stuart Ramsey, the president of Atlantic International Airlines. * Robert Hooks as Dwight Henderson, an FBI agent. * Elizabeth Hurley as Sabrina Ritchie, Rane's second-in-command and sole henchwoman disguised as a flight attendant. * Michael Horse as Forget, Rane's henchman. * Marc Macaulay as Vincent, Rane's henchman. * Ernie Lively as Chief Leonard Biggs, the local sheriff. * Duchess Tomasello as Mrs. Edwards * William Edward Roberts as Matthew, Rane's henchman. * James Short as Allen * Gary Rorman as Douglas * Joel Fogel as Dr. Bauman * Jane McPherson as Nurse * Brett Rice as a Cop ==ProductionDevelopment=== The film was based on a script by Stewart Raffill. It was written as an action film for a guy like Clint Eastwood, about a man going to bury his son in Spain who sat next to an Iranian terrorist on the plane. The terrorist hijacks the plane and takes the passengers to Iran. Then the Clint Eastwood type character escapes, captures the Mullahs and holds them as prisoners in exchange for American prisoners. Raffill says \\"The head of the studio said to me, ‚ÄúIf I make that movie, they‚Äôll blow up the theaters.‚Äù So I did a couple of re-writes for them, for Warner Bros who owned it, then I got another picture and came back and then it became a black movie.\\" Raffill says his work only remains in the first quarter of the resulting film. Raffill could not think of a title for the film but noticed a bottle of ketchup and was inspired by the Heinz 57 mark to call the film Passenger 57. ===Filming=== Although supposedly set partly at a small airport in Louisiana, filming took place in Snipes' hometown of Orlando, Florida, with Orlando-Sanford International Airport standing in for \\"Lake Lucille\\" airport in Louisiana.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105104/locations The airport's former combination main hangar and control tower from its time as Naval Air Station Sanford was used for many key scenes just prior to its demolition after filming. ==ReleaseHome media=== DVD was released in Region 1 in the United States on May 27, 1998, and Region 2 in the United Kingdom on April 26, 1999, it was distributed by Warner Home Video. ==ReceptionBox office=== Passenger 57 was released on November 6, 1992, and opened at number one rank in 1,734 theaters. The opening weekend receipts were $10,513,925. The film's final US domestic gross receipts were $44,065,653. Passenger 57 is one of the films that launched Wesley Snipes' career in the action genre. Because of this film's success, Wesley Snipes was cast in lead roles of other features, including Money Train, Drop Zone, Demolition Man, The Art of War, and the Blade trilogy. ===Critical response=== The film received mixed reviews. Critics praised Wesley Snipes and Bruce Payne's performances, but panned the script. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 24% based on 25 reviews, with an average rating of 4.14/10. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. Marcus Trower, of Empire magazine, stated that Bruce Payne was \\"a brilliantly disconcerting madman. With his flowing blond Jesus locks, armor- piercing stare and casual sadism, he makes Hannibal Lecter look like a social worker ‚Äì and like Sir Anthony Hopkins' serial killer, part of the man's menace is in the apparent contradiction between his articulate, well-spoken English and his off-hand brutality.\\"Empire's Passenger 57 Movie Review. Empireonline.com (2006-12-05). Retrieved on 2011-06-20. The Radio Times stated that Payne and Snipes both gave 'charismatic turns' in the film. The New York Times stated that Payne brought a 'tongue-in-cheek humor to the psychopathic fiend' that he played. A reviewer for People magazine stated that \\"Bruce Payne steals the plane‚Äîand the movie\\". ==References* Category:1992 films Category:1992 action films Category:American films Category:American action films Category:American aviation films Category:American police detective films Category:English-language films Category:Films about the Federal Bureau of Investigation Category:Films scored by Stanley Clarke Category:Films about aircraft hijackings Category:Films about terrorism Category:Films directed by Kevin Hooks Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films set in Louisiana Category:Films set on airplanes Category:Films shot in Florida Category:Films with screenplays by David Loughery Category:Warner Bros. films ","title":"Passenger 57"},{"id":"2202965","text":"A major stationary source is a source that emits more than a certain amount of a pollutant as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

She had a younger sister, Isabelle (born 1924). Her ancestry consisted of Welsh, English, Scottish, French, and distant Dutch heritage; her paternal grandfather was an immigrant from Bedminster, Bristol in England, and many of her recent forebears had lived in Canada. Her childhood has been described as Dickensian. The family lived as boarders in a crowded house. The parents were dysfunctional and unhappy and sometimes prone to violent fights; they moved Dorothy around various schools, and paid only occasional attention to the children, before divorcing in 1927. The children were then sent on a train by themselves, unsupervised (Dorothy was eight years old, Isabelle only three), to live with their paternal grandparents in the Los Angeles suburb of Alhambra, California.1930 Los Angeles Co., CA, U.S. Federal Census, San Gabriel Township, Alhambra City, 320 E. Park St., April 4, Enumeration Dist. 1406, sheet 5 B, page 108 B, line 57. The sisters endured harsh and unloving treatment from their grandparents. The grandmother favored black Victorian dress and punished the girls for trifling acts. After Dorothy was caught trick-or-treating one Halloween, an activity the grandparents forbade, she was confined to her room for an entire year except for attending school, and was not even allowed to eat in the kitchen or play in the yard. Having had enough, Dorothy left home at the young age of fourteen in the depths of the Great Depression, working as a housekeeper, cook, and nanny for a San Gabriel, California family, being paid $3 a week. Encouraged by her employer to read and go to school, Dorothy attended Alhambra High School, where she joined several clubs and benefited from two teachers. After graduating from Alhambra in 1937,Alhambra High School Yearbook, The Alhambran, 1937. she moved to Chicago for a failed reunion with her mother, who by then had married Max Rosenberg. Subsequently, she moved into her own apartment there and took office jobs to support herself. She later said, \\"I'd hoped so hard that my mother would love me that I had to take the chance and find out. When she didn't, I had nowhere else to go.\\" Hillary Rodham Clinton later attributed her interest in children's welfare to her mother's life as well as her belief that caring adults outside of family can fill a child's emotional voids. ==Marriage and family== While applying for a job as a clerk typist at a textile company, she met a traveling salesman named Hugh Ellsworth Rodham, eight years her senior, in 1937. After a lengthy courtship, they married in early 1942. Their first child and only daughter, Hillary, was born on Sunday October 26, 1947. At the time of her birth, they were living in a one-bedroom apartment in the Edgewater neighborhood of Chicago. (Dorothy read an article about explorer Edmund Hillary's name while pregnant, and used his surname's spelling for her name.) The second child, a son named Hugh, was born in 1950 and during that year, the growing Rodham family moved into a two-story, three-bedroom house in suburban Park Ridge, Illinois. The couple's third child, a son named Tony, was born in 1954. Dorothy was a full-time homemaker. Dorothy encouraged Hillary to have a love for learning and to pursue an education and a career, though she had never done so herself. As she later recalled, \\"I never saw any difference in gender, as far as capabilities or aspirations were concerned. Just because [Hillary] was a girl didn't mean she should be limited.\\" In contrast to her husband's staunch Republican views, Dorothy Rodham was, as her daughter later wrote, essentially a Democrat, \\"although she kept it quiet in Republican Park Ridge.\\" She taught Sunday school at the First United Methodist Church of Park Ridge. During the 1970s, once her children were grown up, Rodham took courses at Oakton Community College in a variety of subjects, receiving high grades and earning an associate's degree in liberal arts. She was among the first mothers of that generation to return to school. In 1987, Rodham and her husband moved to Little Rock, Arkansas, to be closer to their daughter and help care for their young granddaughter, Chelsea. She took courses in subjects that happened to interest her, focusing on psychology but including logic and child development, although she never gained a further degree. Her daughter later wrote in her 2003 memoir Living History, \\"I'm still amazed at how my mother emerged from her lonely early life as such an affectionate and levelheaded woman.\\" ==Subsequent life== At Hillary Rodham Clinton's swearing in as U.S. Secretary of State on January 21, 2009 Her husband Hugh Rodham died in 1993, shortly after their daughter became First Lady of the United States. Dorothy Rodham remained active but valued her privacy and almost never spoke to the media. She spent more time at the White House and accompanied Hillary and Chelsea on visits to France, India, and China; she also enjoyed life in Washington, D.C. At the 1996 Democratic National Convention, when Bill Clinton was nominated for re-election, she appeared in a video message, saying \\"Everybody knows there is only one person in the world who can really tell the truth about a man, and that's his mother-in-law.\\" Following the Lewinsky scandal she was reportedly angry at Bill, but encouraged Hillary to seek her own political career. When her daughter was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2000, she moved to Washington, D.C., living along Connecticut Avenue. She appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2004. Once living alone became too much for her, in 2006, she moved into the Clintons' large Whitehaven house in the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington, D.C. There she would often sit and discuss the day when her daughter came home from work. Starting in December 2007, she made a rare public appearance in Iowa and other early primary states to campaign for Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. She appeared at some events concerning women's issues and also appeared in a Clinton campaign television advertisement. She was in attendance when her daughter was sworn in as Secretary of State on January 21, 2009. In her final years, her health began to fail due to heart problems. Rodham died at George Washington University Hospital on November 1, 2011, in Washington, D.C., with Secretary Clinton cancelling a trip overseas, to be by her side; no cause was given. Other family members were present as well. A small memorial service was held for her at Whitehaven. ==Legacy== The William J. Clinton Presidential Center held an exhibit featuring Dorothy Howell Rodham and Virginia Dell Kelley, the mother of Bill Clinton, in 2012. It was introduced by a video from Chelsea Clinton in which she talked about the influence her grandmothers had had on her. In her 2014 memoir Hard Choices, Hillary Rodham Clinton wrote of Dorothy Howell Rodham, \\"No one had a bigger influence on my life or did more to shape the person I became.\\" The struggles that she went through became a major theme of the June 2015 kickoff event to Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. They were repeated when Clinton gave a victory speech upon becoming the Democratic nominee in early June 2016, saying, \\"I wish she could see her daughter become the Democratic nominee for President of the United States.\\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:1919 births Category:2011 deaths Category:American people of Dutch descent Category:American people of English descent Category:American people of French-Canadian descent Category:American people of Scottish descent Category:American people of Irish descent Category:Rodham family Category:Illinois Democrats Category:People from Chicago Category:People from Park Ridge, Illinois Category:People from Little Rock, Arkansas Category:Articles containing video clips Category:American United Methodists Category:People from Kalorama (Washington, D.C.)

Given the legendary status of Geryon, Gargoris and Habis, Arganthonios is the earliest documented monarch of the Iberian Peninsula. ==Life== According to the Greek historian Herodotus, King Arganthonios ruled Tartessos for 80 years (from about 625 BC to 545 BC) and lived to be 120 years old. This idea of great age and length of reign may result from a succession of kings using the same name or title. Herodotus says that Arganthonios warmly welcomed the first Greeks to reach Iberia, a ship carrying Phocaeans, and urged them fruitlessly to settle in Iberia. Hearing that the Medes were becoming a dominant force in the neighbourhood of the Phocaeans, he gave the latter money to build a defensive wall about their town. Herodotus comments that \\"he must have given with a bountiful hand, for the town is many furlongs in circuit\\". ==Name== Given the paucity of sources on the Tartessian language, the origin of the name \\"Arganthonios\\" is uncertain. Historians have noted the similarities with Celtic names. In fact, This the word \\"Arganthonios\\" appears to be based on the Indo-European word for 'silver' (secondarily 'money'), reconstructed as Proto-Celtic *arganto- and proto-Italic as *argentom.De Vaan, Michiel (2008) in Etymological Dictionary of Latin and the other Italic Languages (Leiden Indo-European Etymological Dictionary Series)Attested reflexes in Celtic include: Celtiberian arkanta (also compare arkanto-beƒëom 'silver mine (?)'), Gaulish arganto- (in compounds), Old Irish argat, Old Welsh argant; in Latin as argentum, Falsican arcentom with cognates Sanskrit rajat√°m, and others, from Proto-Indo-European *h‚ÇÇrÃ•«µnÃ•t√≥m 'silver', which is derived from a nominal root *h‚ÇÇer«µ- 'white, brilliant; swift'; also compare Ancient Greek ·ºÑœÅŒ≥œÖœÅŒøŒΩ (arguron) 'silver'. Tartessos was rich in silver, like all of Iberia. Similar names (e.g. Argantoni) appear in inscriptions of the Roman period in or near former Tartessian territory. A name or title Argantoda(nos) is found on silver coinage in Northern Gaul and may have had a meaning akin to \\"treasurer\\".

The inadequacies of Paul's character, the various dilemmas he has to face during his life, and the occasional influence of the advanced being who shares his experiences, provide Stapledon with a semi- autobiographical platform on which to expound his philosophical and moral beliefs. The book includes a piece of satire on sexual morality. An unspecified future human species (one of the Eighteenth Men's predecessors on Neptune) is presented as having an attitude to nutrition analogous to the First Men's sexual puritanism.

Merozoite surface proteins, or MSPs, are important in understanding malaria, a disease caused by protozoans of the genus Plasmodium. During the asexual blood stage of its life cycle, the malaria parasite enters red blood cells to replicate itself, causing the classic symptoms of malaria. These surface protein complexes are involved in many interactions of the parasite with red blood cells and are therefore an important topic of study for scientists aiming to combat malaria. == Forms == The most common form of MSPs are anchored to the merozoite surface with glycophosphatidylinositol, a short glycolipid often used for protein anchoring. Additional forms include integral membrane proteins and peripherally associated proteins, which are found to a lesser extent than glycophosphatidylinositol anchored proteins, or (GPI)-anchored proteins, on the merozoite surface. Merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 (MSP-1 & MSP-2) are the most abundant (GPI)-anchored proteins on the surface of Plasmodium merozoites. == Function == MSP-1 is synthesized at the very beginning of schizogony, or asexual merozoite reproduction. The merozoite first attaches to a red blood cell using its MSP-1 complex. The MSP-1 complex targets spectrin, a complex on the internal surface of the cell membrane of a red blood cell. The majority of the MSP-1 complex is shed upon entry into the red blood cell, but a small portion of the C-terminus, called MSP-119, is conserved. The exact role of MSP-119 remains unknown, but it currently serves as a marker for the formation of the food vacuole. The relative size and location of each segment present on the MSP-1 complex is shown above. SS represents the signal sequence, which is a short sequence present on the N-terminus of new proteins. GA represents the GPI anchor, which is located at the C-terminus of the protein. The function of the MSP-2 complex is not concrete, but current research suggests it has a role in red blood cell invasion due to its degradation shortly after invasion. MSP- 3, 6, 7 and 9 are peripheral membrane proteins that have been shown to form a complex with MSP-1, but the functions of these proteins are largely unknown. == Clinical significance == Due to their prevalence on the Plasmodium surface, MSPs have been a key target for vaccine development. Anti-malarial vaccines have been developed to target the merozoite at different stages in its life cycle. Vaccines that target the merozoite in its asexual erythrocytic stage utilize merozoite surface proteins, particularly MSP-1. In addition to vaccines, researchers are developing drugs that bind to MSPs in order to disrupt merozoite replication. Suramin, a drug used to treat African sleeping sickness, has shown moderate success with binding to MSP-1 and its derivatives such as MSP-119 to inhibit red blood cell invasion. === Challenges === The challenge faced when developing vaccines is the complexity and variation of these proteins. In merozoites of the same genus and species, the sequences encoding proteins such as MSP-1 vary depending on the region they are found. For example, the Combination B vaccine utilizes antigens of MSP-1 and MSP-2 but has limited efficacy based primarily on the MSP-2 alleles used. In an attempt to increase the efficiency of vaccines produced, constant regions such as MSP-119 which remain on the surface of the Plasmodium after the merozoite stage are becoming a key focus for vaccine studies. Additionally, synthetic glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) molecules are candidates since they elicit a strong immune response while simultaneously remaining relatively consistent in structure over various malarial strains. == References == Category:Parasitology Category:Apicomplexan proteins Category:Malaria ","title":"Merozoite surface protein"},{"id":"2203107","text":"Community Board 12 The Manhattan Community Board 12 is a New York City community board for the neighborhoods of Inwood and Washington Heights in the borough of Manhattan.

The ruins of the mission are located in present-day Ejido La Misi√≥n, Baja California in the municipio of Ensenada. The mission ruins are behind the local school, on the north side of Highway 1. ==History== It was near this place that, in 1773, a large cross was erected to indicate the boundary of missionary responsibilities in Las Californias between Franciscans (north) and Dominicans (south). Franciscan missionary Francisco Pal√≥u, on his way to San Diego, supervised the operation.Engelhardt, Z. (1929). The missions and missionaries of California, Volume One, pp. 489‚Äì90. Santa Barbara, Calif: Mission Santa Barbara. Online at Google Books In 1804, the same line was used to divide Las Californias into separate provinces of Alta California and Baja California. Today's border between the United States and Mexico is about to the north. The mission was built with the support of six soldiers from the Presidio of San Diego and five others probably from Mission San Vicente. They had just begun to build the first houses and plant the first crops when the neighboring San Juan Bautista Creek ran dry. This forced them to move the mission to a new site called San Juan Bautista, 10 km upstream, where there was a good supply of water. ==Mission complex== The three remaining walls of the mission, covered by a protective layer. The enclosure was rectangular, with the church and the residential quarters facing east and south. It had an open patio, the only entrance to which was a large door located in the southeast corner of the complex, protected by a barrack. The complex also included an irrigation ditch, four granaries, two houses, a corral, and three other rooms. The buildings of the complex were made of adobe, with round stone foundations, set at a depth of 90 cm, cemented with a mortar of clay, sand, and lime. The adobe bricks resting on the foundation were cemented with the same mortar and placed in an alternating fashion to give the structure more strength and stability, making walls from 0.9 to 1.1 m thick. The adobe was made with local soil, water, clay, sand, and straw to make it more resistant. The walls probably reached a height of 4.5 m, and the roofs were interlaced with tule branches possibly over beams or with adobe tile. The floors were made of flooring tile. ==Location and natural habitat== This Mission is located at the base of a mountain, surrounded by meadows and hills, crossed by the San Juan Bautista stream, also known as the Guadalupe River. Further downhill this stream joins the sea, forming an estuary rich in diverse types of plants and animals, such as white herons and wild ducks. The missionaries wrote in their diaries about finding plentiful pasture in the area and further inland as well as watercress, chia, mangrove, cattail, brushwood, a few isolated pines, yucca, mesquite, sycamores, chamomile, willows, and evergreen oaks. The native animals that inhabited the region were coyotes, bobcats, beavers, moles, rabbits, squirrels, rats, and mice, among others. There were also marine species such as sea bass, corbina, tuna, sardine, boga octopus, abalone, clam, and mussel. The humidity at San Miguel Arc√°ngel de la Frontera favored the development of cattle herds. According to the missionaries' reports, they had more than 3,000 head of cattle, goats, and sheep, as well as 400 horses and mules in the meadows. Agricultural crops included wheat, maize, cantaloupe, watermelon, beans, lentils, vegetables, grapes, and barley. A shored-up Mission wall. ==Conservation== Conservation efforts at San Miguel form part of the \\"Camino Real Misionero de las Californias\\" program of Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). Foundations of the eroded walls have been consolidated. Rain gutters have been built to divert the water and prevent its concentration at the base of the remains. One of the walls has been shored. The remains of the walls are covered by a layer made of clay, sand, water, slices of nopal cactus, and manure to protect them from the wind, sunlight, and rain. ==References== * Meigs, Peveril, III. 1935.

RFPs are significantly different from tokamaks (the most popular magnetic confinement scheme) in that they tend to have a higher power density and better confinement characteristics for a given average magnetic field. RFPs also tend to be dominated by non-ideal phenomena and turbulent effects. MST is one of the sites in the Center for Magnetic Self Organization (CMSO). ==Classification== The geometry inside the Madison Symmetric Torus.Almagri, A. F., S. Assadi, S. C. Prager, J. S. Sarff, and D. W. Kerst. \\"Locked Modes and Magnetic Field Errors in the Madison Symmetric Torus.\\" Physics of Fluids B: Plasma Physics 4.12 (1992): 4080. As in most such experiments the MST plasma is a toroidal pinch, which means the plasma is shaped like a donut and confined by a magnetic field generated by a large current flowing through it. MST falls into an unconventional class of machine called a reversed field pinch (RFP.) The RFP is so named because the toroidal magnetic field that permeates the plasma spontaneously reverses direction near the edge. A reversed field pinch is formed similarly to other toroidal pinch devices, by driving current through the plasma from an associated capacitor bank or other high-current power source. In a tokamak the toroidal field is much stronger than the poloidal field, but in an RFP it's just the opposite. In fact, in an RFP the externally applied toroidal field is switched off shortly after startup. The plasma in an RFP is also much closer to the wall than in a Tokamak. This permits a peculiar arrangement of the magnetic field lines, which will 'relax' into a new state such that the total magnetic energy in the plasma is minimized and the total magnetic helicity is conserved. The relaxed state, called a Taylor state, is marked by a peculiar arrangement of magnetic field lines where the toroidal magnetic field at the edge spontaneously reverses direction. ==Ongoing experiments in the MST programOscillating field current drive=== Like most toroidal confinement schemes, the RFP relies on a transient burst of current to create the plasma and the magnetic fields that confine it. But for the RFP to be a viable fusion energy candidate the plasma must be sustained by a steady state current source. OFCD is a scheme for driving a steady current in a relaxed plasma by adding sizable oscillating perturbations to the toroidal and poloidal fields injecting both power and helicity into the plasma. A nonlinear reaction in the plasma combines the two oscillations in such a way that, on average, a steady current is maintained. ===Pellet injection=== One of the challenges facing the RFP is fueling the hot core of the plasma directly, rather than relying on the deuterium gas to seep in slowly from the edge. The Pellet Injector fires a frozen pellet of deuterium into the plasma using a blast of gas or a mechanical punch. The pellet is vaporized and ionized as it travels into the core of the plasma. ===Pulsed poloidal current drive=== Every gradient is a source of free energy, especially if it's across a magnetic field. In MST the current is stronger in the core than at the edge. This peaked current profile serves as a source of free energy for magnetic fluctuations culminating in violent events in the plasma called sawteeth. PPCD alleviates this effect by driving a current at the edge of the plasma, flattening the current profile. Small pulses are added to the power supply currents that drive the toroidal field. The resultant pulsed toroidal magnetic field, with the aid of Faraday's law, creates a poloidal electric field and hence a poloidal current. A great deal of research on MST is devoted to the study of this effect and its application for enhanced confinement. ===Neutral beam injection=== In order to initiate a sustained fusion reaction, it is usually necessary to use many methods to heat the plasma. Neutral Beam Injection (NBI) involves injecting a high energy beam of neutral atoms, typically hydrogen or deuterium, into the core of the plasma. These energetic atoms transfer their energy to the plasma, raising the overall temperature. The neutral atoms injected don't remain neutral. As the beam passes through the plasma, the atoms are ionized as they bounce off the ions in the plasma. Because the magnetic field inside the torus is bent into a circle, the fast ions are hoped to be confined in the background plasma. The confined fast ions are slowed down by the background plasma, the same way air resistance slows down a baseball. The energy transfer from the fast ions to the plasma increases the plasma temperature. The actual injector can be seen from the observation window. It looks like a long silver cylinder laying on its side but tilted slightly downward against the torus near the back of the machine. When the injector is pulsed, 20,000 volts accelerates the beam to about 30 amperes of current for about 1.5 milliseconds. Problems would occur if the fast ions aren't confined within the plasma long enough for them to deposit their energy. Magnetic fluctuations bedevil plasma confinement in this type of device by scrambling what we hoped were well behaved magnetic fields. If the fast ions are susceptible to this type of behavior, they can escape very quickly. However, there is evidence to suggest that they aren't. ===Electron Bernstein wave current drive=== EBW is an acronym for Electron Bernstein Wave and is named after the plasma physicist, Ira Bernstein. Bernstein Wave Mode relates to a method of injecting ion or electron energy (IBW or EBW) into a plasma to increase its temperature in an attempt to reach fusion conditions. A plasma is a phase of matter which occurs naturally during lightning and electrical discharges and which is created artificially in fusion reactors to produce extremely high temperatures. A definition may be found in the Laurence Livermore Plasma dictionary. This is an experiment on the MST to heat the plasma and to drive electric current inside the plasma. There is a large electric current in the plasma inside this machine; it is responsible for creating the necessary magnetic fields to make the reversed field pinch configuration. It also heats the plasma very quickly ‚Äî the same way wires inside your toaster get hot. Your toaster probably uses about 10 ampere of current, while the plasma in MST is heated by up to 600,000 amperes. But even though the plasma reaches over 10,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit, it is not hot enough for practical fusion energy and we need to find other ways to deposit energy into the plasma. The EBW is a way to inject microwave power to further heat the plasma. The standard microwave oven produces around 1 kW of power at a frequency of 2.45 GHz; the EBW experiment is currently producing 150 kW at 3.6 GHz, and it is a goal of the team to upgrade to over 2 MW. To generate this type of power (on a low budget), decommissioned military radar equipment and home-made voltage power supplies are used. The second (and perhaps more scientifically important) goal of the EBW experiment is to drive electric current in a prescribed place within the plasma. The main plasma current distributes itself naturally, and the plasma tends to concentrate current into the center, leaving less current near the edge. This can lead to instability of the plasma. It has been shown (both theoretically and by experiments in the Madison Symmetric Torus) that driving current in the edge makes the plasma more stable to fluctuations in the magnetic field, resulting in better confinement of the hot plasma and leading to much higher temperature. Using the EBW to drive this stabilizing current would be a very important scientific result. The ability to deposit very specifically the auxiliary current gives us the opportunity to optimize our current drive schemes. The heating is also very localized, allowing us to study how hot (at least locally) the plasma can become within this magnetic confinement scheme ‚Äî in plasma physics terms, this is called finding the beta limit. This is an unanswered question for the RFP and will give insight on whether or not this type of machine could be scaled up to a cost-effective, efficient fusion reactor. ===The heavy ion beam probe=== The Heavy Ion Beam Probe (HIBP) fires potassium ions into the plasma. By measuring their trajectory we get a profile of several key properties inside the plasma. This versatile diagnostics tool has been used in magnetic confinement fusion experiments to determine the electric potential, electron density, electron temperature, and magnetic vector potential of the plasma. A stream of sodium ions (the primary beam) is injected from the ion gun across the magnetic field into the plasma. As the singly charged particles pass through the plasma, they are further ionized creating the doubly charged secondary beam. The secondaries are then detected and analyzed outside the plasma. By curving the trajectories, the magnetic field separates secondary ions from primary ions. Because of this, only secondaries ionized at a given plasma position reach a given detector location. This allows the HIBP to make measurements localized to the ionization position. The secondary current is related to local electron density and the ionization cross-section of the primary ions, which is itself a function of the electron temperature. The electric potential can be obtained from the energy difference between primary and secondary ion beams. The energy of the secondary beam can be determined from the angle at which it enters the energy analyzer. The MST-HIBP system consists of: #A 200 keV electrostatic accelerator that forms, focuses and accelerates the diagnostic ion beam; #The primary and secondary beamlines with sweep systems that provide beam transmission and steering; #An electrostatic analyzer that measures the energy, intensity and position of the secondary beam; #Auxiliary components and systems which include the primary beam detectors and the plasma/UV suppression structures, etc. ===Far infrared polarimetry-interferometry system=== FIR, or Far Infrared, refers to light with wavelengths between 1 and 10 mm. The FIR system in MST is based on the FIR lasers enclosed in the beige- colored laser safety room to the right of the picture shown, in the second floor hallway. There are four FIR lasers in the system. One is a CO2 laser which produces a continuous power of about 120 W. This beam is then split in three. Each beam optically pumps a Formic Acid vapor laser operating at a wavelength of 432.6 mm, and a power of about 20 mW. The FIR system has 2 modes of operation: interferometry and polarimetry. What does FIR diagnostic system measure? The electron density, plasma current density, and magnetic field are three important plasma parameters of MST. The FIR system is used to measure their spatial and temporal distributions. How does FIR interferometry work? Like glass, a plasma has a refractive index different from that of vacuum (or air) that depends on plasma electron density. We send one laser beam through the plasma (the probe beam), one through the air (the reference beam), and measure the phase difference between them. This experimental configuration is called a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The measured phase is proportional to the average plasma electron density along the beam path. In MST, we send multiple probe beams (blue lines in the figure) through the plasma at different radii. We then apply the so-called Abel inversion technique to obtain a profile of the plasma electron density. How does FIR polarimetry work? A plasma is also an optically active media, meaning when a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave is propagating parallel (or anti-parallel) to the magnetic field, the polarization of the wave exiting the plasma will rotate a small angle. This is called Faraday rotation, and the angle is called the Faraday rotation angle. The FIR system measures the Faraday rotation, which is proportional to the line average of the electron density times the magnetic field component parallel to the beam path. The reason for Faraday rotation is as follows: When a linearly polarized wave is propagating along a magnetic field line, it is de-composed into left-hand and right-hand circularly polarized components. The phase difference between them as they exit the plasma causes the recombined linearly polarized wave to rotate its polarization direction. In MST, we launch two co-propagating, counter-rotating waves to probe the plasma. We then measure the phase difference between these two beams, which will be twice the Faraday rotation angle. In the figure, each of the 11 blue probe beams is a combination of two counter-rotating, circularly polarized beams, measuring the Faraday rotation angles along the same chords as the interferometer does. The combined interferometer phases and Faraday rotation angles can then be combined to determine the poloidal magnetic field distribution. Using Ampere's law, the toroidal plasma current can be determined as well. How well does the FIR diagnostic system work? The FIR system for MST is very precise. The Faraday rotation angle for MST plasmas is typically within 5 degrees. To measure such small signal, we have achieved an accuracy of 0.06 degree. The temporal resolution is less than 1 microsecond. What are some of the research topics related to FIR? FIR is an essential tool for most of the research topics in MST since it provides information about the basic plasma parameters. The system measures electron density, toroidal current, poloidal magnetic field, and the spatial profiles of each. Currently, we are exploring the possibility of measuring toroidal magnetic field and poloidal plasma current by using the plasma bi-refringence effect, or the Cotton-Mouton effect. When a linearly polarized EM wave is propagating perpendicular to the magnetic field, the refractive index depends on whether the wave polarization is parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field direction. Why choose FIR lasers? For plasma polarimetry-interferometry, the wavelength we chose is sufficiently long to provide measurable plasma induced phase changes, but sufficiently short to avoid complicated plasma-wave interactions, including the bending of the beam. There are many high power molecular laser lines available in this wavelength range, and many commercially available detectors. ===Thomson scattering=== What is Thomson Scattering? Thomson scattering is the result of a collision between a photon (an electromagnetic wave) and a charged particle, such as an electron. When an electron and photon \\"collide\\" the electron feels a Lorentz force from the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of the photon and is accelerated. This acceleration causes the electron to emit a different photon in a different direction. This emitted photon has a wavelength shifted from that of the incident photon by an amount dependent on the electron energy. Another way of looking at this is that the electron absorbs the energy of the photon and re emits the energy in the form of a different electromagnetic wave. This scattering of a photon by an electron is called Thomson Scattering. How is Thomson Scattering useful to plasma physicists? Since the wavelength of the scattered photon depends on the energy of the scattering electron, Thomson scattering is good way to measure the energy of an electron. This is done by creating a photon of known wavelength and measuring the wavelength of the scattered photon. The Thomson Scattering configuration at MST uses a 1064 nm Nd:YAG Laser System, which produces the best time-resolution electron temperature readings in the world.Pulse-burst laser systems for fast Thomson scattering. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 81, 10D513 (2010); We create our photons with high power lasers that we shine into a window on the top of the MST, and collect scattered photons with a large collection lens on the side of the MST. The wavelength distribution of the scattered photons tells us the energy distribution of the electrons in the plasma, giving us a direct unobtrusive way of getting the temperature of the electrons. The amount of photons we actually collect can also tell us something about the density of the electrons in the plasma. ===Charge exchange recombination spectroscopy and ion Doppler spectroscopy=== Fusion plasmas are typically generated from ionization of a neutral gas. In most cases, an isotope of hydrogen ‚Äî called deuterium ‚Äî is used as the plasma fuel. These plasmas are therefore primarily made up of deuterium ions (plus electrons), and it is necessary to diagnose the behavior of these ions if the relevant plasma physics is to be understood. However, in any fusion device, other types of ions (\\"impurities\\") are also present. These exist naturally due to the inability to achieve a perfect vacuum in a fusion reactor before fueling. Thus, materials such as water vapor, nitrogen, and carbon will be found in small amounts in typical plasma discharges. Impurities may also be generated during plasma discharges due to plasma-wall interactions. These interactions primarily cause material from the wall to be ejected into the plasma through sputtering. In the Madison Symmetric Torus (MST), properties of the impurity ions (e.g. carbon, oxygen, etc.) are closely linked to properties of the deuterium ions as a result of strong interaction between the ion species. Thus, impurity ion measurements can, in principle, provide direct information about the deuterium ions. Measurements of the impurity ion temperature (Ti) and flow velocity (vi) are obtained on MST using Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy, or CHERS. The CHERS process can be broken down into two separate steps: Charge Exchange and Radiative Decay. In the first stage, an electron is transferred from a neutral atom (e.g. deuterium) to an impurity ion that has no electrons (e.g. C+6). During this transfer, the electron typically winds up in an excited state (high energy level) of the impurity ion. As the electron decays down to the ground state (minimum energy level), energy conservation requires radiation to be emitted by the impurity ion. This emission has discrete values of energy, or wavelength, which correspond to the energy differences between the initial and final atomic levels of a particular electron transition. For example, consider charge exchange between a deuterium atom and a C+6 ion: if the electron is transferred to the n=7 energy level of the carbon ion, then the ion will emit radiation at discrete energies given by the difference in energy between the n=7 and n=6 levels, the n=6 and n=5 levels, the n=5 and n=4 levels, and so on (down to n=1). This line emission is Doppler-broadened as a result of ion thermal motion, and Doppler-shifted as a result of ion flow. The Doppler shift causes the emission to be blue-shifted (towards shorter wavelength/higher frequency) if the ions are moving towards the point of observation, or red- shifted (towards longer wavelength/lower frequency) if the flow is away from the point of observation. Measurements of the carbon emission line shape are therefore used to extract values for the impurity ion temperature and velocity. Charge Exchange: H + C+6 ‚Üí H+1 \\\\+ C+5 (n=7, l=6) Radiative decay: C+5 (n=7, l=6) ‚Üí C+5 (n=6, l=5) + h (photon) In a typical fusion device the neutral atom density is small. Therefore, the amount of radiated emission that results from charge exchange between impurity ions and neutrals is also small. On MST, the neutral density is enhanced by injection of fast hydrogen atoms via a diagnostic neutral beam (DNB). As a result, the radiated emission is greatly increased, though primarily along the beam injection path (the DNB is located below the deck, and cannot be seen from here; the injection path is from right to left across the plasma). Perpendicular to the beam path, there exist a number of optical ports for viewing the plasma at different radial positions. For a given plasma discharge, a fiber bundle system is placed on one of these ports, and is used to collect emission along its line-of-sight (black tubes on top of the machine contain light collection optics; fibers are placed in the long, curved white tube when not in use). This emission is sent to a spectrometer (located in big purple box), where it is dispersed over a finite wavelength range ‚Äî which is centered on the emission line of interest ‚Äî by a pair of optical gratings. However, because the collected emission is dominated by radiation from along the beam path, the measurements are effectively localized to the intersection volume between the fiber view and the beam. On MST, this intersection volume is small (~ 2 cm3) compared to the plasma volume, allowing spatially resolved measurements of Ti and vi to be obtained. Data collected from a number of plasma discharges ‚Äî for which the location of the fiber bundle system is varied ‚Äî are used to construct radial profiles of the impurity ion temperature and velocity, providing important information for understanding the physics of plasmas in MST. Typical ion temperatures measured by CHERS on MST are in the range of 100 to 800 eV (2 million to 17 million degrees Fahrenheit), depending on position in the plasma and type of discharge. Likewise, measured equilibrium ion velocities are on the order of 1,000 to 10,000 meters per second. ==References== Category:Magnetic confinement fusion devices Category:University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison ","title":"Madison Symmetric Torus"},{"id":"2203166","text":"In CP/M-86, Concurrent CP/M-86, Personal CP/M-86, S5-DOS, DOS Plus, Concurrent DOS, FlexOS, Multiuser DOS, System Manager and REAL/32 as well as by SCP1700, CP/K and K8918-OS, CMD is the filename extension used by CP/M-style executable programs.

Examples of misinformation are false rumors, insults, and pranks. Disinformation is a species of misinformation that is deliberately deceptive, e. g. malicious hoaxes, spearphishing, and computational propaganda. The principal effect of misinformation is to elicit fear and suspicion among a population. News parody or satire can become misinformation if the unwary judge it to be credible and communicate it as if it were true. The words \\"misinformation\\" and \\"disinformation\\" have often been associated with the neologism \\"fake news\\", which some scholars define as \\"fabricated information that mimics news media content in form but not in organizational process or intent\\". ==History== The history of misinformation, along with that of disinformation and propaganda, is part of the history of mass communication. Early examples cited in a 2017 article by Robert Darnton are the insults and smears spread among political rivals in Imperial and Renaissance Italy in the form of \\"pasquinades\\". These are anonymous and witty verse named for the Pasquino piazza and \\"talking statue\\" in Rome, and in pre- revolutionary France as \\"canards\\", or printed broadsides that sometimes included an engraving to help convince readers to take their wild tales seriously. The spread in Europe and North America of Johannes Gutenberg's mechanized printing press increased the opportunities to spread English- language misinformation. In 1835, the New York Sun published the first large- scale news hoax, known as the \\"Great Moon Hoax\\". This was a series of six articles claiming to describe life on the Moon, \\"complete with illustrations of humanoid bat-creatures and bearded blue unicorns\\". The fast pace and sometimes strife-filled work of mass-producing news broadsheets also led to copies rife with careless factual errors and mistakes, such as the Chicago Tribune's infamous 1948 headline \\"Dewey Defeats Truman\\". In the so-called Information Age, social networking sites have become a notable vector for the spread of misinformation, \\"fake news\\" and propaganda. Misinformation on social media spreads quickly in comparison to traditional media because of the lack of regulation and examination required before posting. These sites provide users with the capability to spread information quickly to other users without requiring the permission of a gatekeeper such as an editor, who might otherwise require confirmation of its truth before allowing its publication. Journalists today are criticized for helping to spread false information on these social platforms, but research such as that from Starbird et al. and Arif et al. shows they also play a role in curbing the spread of misinformation on social media through debunking and denying false rumors. ==Identification and correction== Information conveyed as credible but later amended can affect people's memory and reasoning after retraction. Misinformation differs from concepts like rumors because misinformation it is inaccurate information that has previously been disproved. According to Anne Mintz, editor of Web of Deception: Misinformation on the Internet, the best ways to determine whether information is factual is to use common sense. Mintz advises that the reader check whether the information makes sense and whether the founders or reporters of the websites that are spreading the information are biased or have an agenda. Professional journalists and researchers look at other sites (particularly verified sources like news channels) for that information, as it might be reviewed by multiple people and heavily researched, providing more concrete details. Martin Libicki, author of Conquest In Cyberspace: National Security and Information Warfare, noted that the trick to working with misinformation is the idea that readers must have a balance of what is correct or incorrect. Readers cannot be gullible but also should not be paranoid that all information is incorrect. There is always a chance that even readers who have this balance will believe an error to be true or that they will disregard factual information as incorrect. According to Libicki, readers' prior beliefs or opinions also affect how they interpret new information. When readers believe something to be true before researching it, they are more likely to believe information that supports these prior beliefs or opinions. This phenomenon may lead readers who otherwise are skilled at evaluating credible sources and facts to believe misinformation. According to research, the factors that lead to recognizing misinformation is the amount of education a person has and the information literacy they have. This means if a person has more knowledge in the subject being investigated, or are familiar with the process of how the information is researched and presented, then they are more likely to identify misinformation. Further research reveal that content descriptors can have a varying effect in people in detecting misinformation. Prior research suggest it can be very difficult to undo the effects of misinformation once individuals believe it to be true and fact checking can even backfire. Attempting to correct the wrongly held belief is difficult because the misinformation may suit someone's motivational or cognitive reasons. Motivational reasons include the desire to arrive at a foregone conclusion, so accepting information that supports that conclusion. Cognitive reasons may be that the misinformation provides scaffolding for an incident or phenomenon, and is thus part of the mental model for consideration. In this instance, it is necessary to correct the misinformation by not only refuting it, but also by providing accurate information that can also function in the mental model. One suggested solution that would focus on primary prevention of misinformation is the use of a distributed consensus mechanism to validate the accuracy of claims, with appropriate flagging or removal of content that is determined to be false or misleading. ==Causes== Historically, people have relied on journalists and other information professionals to relay facts and truths. Many different things cause miscommunication but the underlying factor is information literacy. Information is distributed by various means, and because of this it is often hard for users to ask questions of the credibility of what they are seeing. Many online sources of misinformation use techniques to fool users into thinking their sites are legitimate and the information they generate is factual. Often misinformation can be politically motivated. Websites such as USConservativeToday.com have previously posted false information for political and monetary gain. In addition to the sharing of misinformation for political and monetary gain it is also spread unintentionally. Advances in digital media have made it easier to share information, although it is not always accurate. The next sections discuss the role social media has in distributing misinformation, the lack of internet gatekeepers, inaccurate information from media sources, and competition in news and media. ==Social media== Contemporary social media platforms offer a rich ground for the spread of misinformation.The exact sharing and motivation behind why misinformation spreads through social media so easily remains unknown. A 2018 study of Twitter determined that, compared to accurate information, false information spread significantly faster, further, deeper, and more broadly. Combating its spread is difficult for two reasons: the profusion of information sources, and the generation of \\"echo chambers\\". The profusion of information sources makes the reader's task of weighing the reliability of information more challenging, heightened by the untrustworthy social signals that go with such information. The inclination of people to follow or support like-minded individuals leads to the formation of echo chambers and filter bubbles. With no differing information to counter the untruths or the general agreement within isolated social clusters, some writers argue the outcome is a dearth, and worse, the absence of a collective reality, some writers argue. Although social media sites have changed their algorithms to prevent the spread of fake news, the problem still exists. Furthermore, research has shown that while people may know what the scientific community has proved as a fact, they may still refuse to accept it as such. Misinformation thrives in a social media landscape frequently used and spread by college students. This can be supported by scholars such as Ghosh and Scott(2018), who indicated that misinformation is \\"becoming unstoppable\\". It has also been observed that misinformation and disinformation come back, multiple times on social media sites. A research study watched the process of thirteen rumors appearing on Twitter and noticed that eleven of those same stories resurfaced multiple times, after much time had passed. Another reason that misinformation spreads on social media is from the users themselves. In a study, it was shown that the most common reasons that Facebook users were sharing misinformation for social motivated reasons, rather than taking the information seriously. Although users may not be spreading false information for malicious reasons, the misinformation is still being spread across the internet. A research study shows that misinformation that is introduced through a social format influences individuals drastically more than misinformation delivered non-socially. Twitter is one of the most concentrated platforms for engagement with political fake news. 80% of fake news sources are shared by 0.1% of users, who are \\"super-sharers\\". Older, more conservative social users are also more likely to interact with fake news. On Facebook, adults older than 65 were seven times more likely to share fake news than adults ages 18-29. ===Lack of Internet gatekeepers=== Because of the decentralized nature and structure of the Internet, writers can easily publish content without being required to subject it to peer review, prove their qualifications, or provide backup documentation. Whereas a book found in a library generally has been reviewed and edited by a second person, Internet sources cannot be assumed to be vetted by anyone other than their authors. They may be produced and posted as soon as the writing is finished. In addition, the presence of trolls and bots used to spread willful misinformation has been a problem for social media platforms. As many as 60 million trolls could be actively spreading misinformation on Facebook. ===inaccurate information from media sources=== An example of bad information from media sources that led to the spread of misinformation occurred in November 2005, when Chris Hansen on Dateline NBC made a claim that law enforcement officials estimate 50,000 predators are online at any moment. Afterwards, the U.S. attorney general at the time, Alberto Gonzales, repeated the claim. However, the number that Hansen used in his reporting had no backing. Hansen said he received the information from Dateline expert Ken Lanning, but Lanning admitted that he made up the number 50,000 because there was no solid data on the number. According to Lanning, he used 50,000 because it sounds like a real number, not too big and not too small, and referred to it as a \\"Goldilocks number\\". Reporter Carl Bialik says that the number 50,000 is used often in the media to estimate numbers when reporters are unsure of the exact data. ===Competition in news and media=== Because news organizations and websites hotly compete for viewers, there is a need for great efficiency in releasing stories to the public. News media companies broadcast stories 24 hours a day, and break the latest news in hopes of taking audience share from their competitors. News is also produced at a pace that does not always allow for fact-checking, or for all of the facts to be collected or released to the media at one time, letting readers or viewers insert their own opinions, and possibly leading to the spread of misinformation. ==Impact== Misinformation can affect all aspects of life. Allcott, Gentzkow and Yu (2019:6) concur that diffusion of misinformation through social media is a potential threat to democracy and broader society. The effects of misinformation can lead to the accurateness about information and details of the occurrence to decline. When eavesdropping on conversations, one can gather facts that may not always be true, or the receiver may hear the message incorrectly and spread the information to others. On the Internet, one can read content that is stated to be factual but that may not have been checked or may be erroneous. In the news, companies may emphasize the speed at which they receive and send information but may not always be correct in the facts. These developments contribute to the way misinformation will continue to complicate the public's understanding of issues and to serve as a source for belief and attitude formation. In regards to politics, some view being a misinformed citizen as worse than being an uninformed citizen. Misinformed citizens can state their beliefs and opinions with confidence and in turn affect elections and policies. This type of misinformation comes from speakers not always being upfront and straightforward, yet may appear both \\"authoritative and legitimate\\" on the surface. When information is presented as vague, ambiguous, sarcastic, or partial, receivers are forced to piece the information together and make assumptions about what is correct. Aside from political propaganda, misinformation can also be employed in industrial propaganda. Using tools such as advertising, a company can undermine reliable evidence or influence belief through concerted misinformation campaign. For instance, tobacco companies employed misinformation in the second half of the twentieth century to diminish the reliability of studies that demonstrated the link between smoking and lung cancer. In the medical field, misinformation can immediately lead to life endangerment as seen in the case of the public's negative perception towards vaccines or the use of herbs instead of medicines to treat diseases. Websites have been created to help people to discern fact from fiction. For example, the site FactCheck.org has a mission to fact check the media, especially politician speeches and stories going viral on the Internet. The site also includes a forum where people can openly ask questions about information they're not sure is true in both the media and the internet. Similar sites give individuals the option to be able to copy and paste misinformation into a search engine and the site will investigate the truthfulness of the inputted data. Famous online resources, such as Facebook and Google, have attempted to add automatic fact checker programs to their sites, and created the option for users to flag information that they think are false on their website. A way that fact checking programs find misinformation involve finding the truth by analyzing the language and syntax of news stories. Another way is that fact checkers can search for existing information on the subject and compare it to the new broadcasts being put online. Other sites such as Wikipedia and Snopes are also widely used resources for verifying information. Some scholars and activists are pioneering a movement to eliminate the mis/disinformation and information pollution in the digital world. The theory they are developing, \\"information environmentalism\\", has become a curriculum in some universities and colleges. ==See also== ==References== ==Further reading== * * * Baillargeon, Normand (4 January 2008).

Formed in the late 1990s, the band released five albums between 2001 and 2008. ==Biography== Originally comprising Viv Strachan (vocals), Gordon McIntyre (guitar), Nick Reynolds (bass), and Alexis Beattie (drums), Ballboy played gigs around Edinburgh for a few years, and recorded tracks for the Edinburgh indie compilation it's a life sentence..., released by the newly formed SL Records label in 1997. By 1999 Gordon McIntyre, the band's main songwriter, had taken over vocal duties. Katie Griffiths had joined on keyboards, and Gary Morgan had taken over the drums. The band signed to SL Records that year, and released a series of EPs. The tracks from these EPs were collected on 2001's Club Anthems. The band toured the United States in September / October 2002 and McIntyre's journal of the tour was published in The Scotsman newspaper. Their \\"proper\\" debut album, A Guide for the Daylight Hours, was released in November 2002, featuring artwork by Glasgow-based artist David Shrigley. This album was followed in 2003 by the acoustic, and often melancholy, The Sash My Father Wore and Other Stories, virtually a solo record by McIntyre. In 2004 Ballboy returned to full band mode, with a new keyboard player, Alexa Morrison, and their third album. The band continue to play live occasionally and released their fourth studio album I Worked on the Ships in August 2008. Gordon McIntyre has begun work on a side project, ++Money Can't Buy Music. From their early releases, the band were popular with the late DJ John Peel, and had several tracks featured in the Festive Fifty charts. They recorded several sessions for his BBC Radio 1 show, including a Christmas special live from Peel Acres, where McIntyre recorded a duet with American country singer Laura Cantrell. In Autumn 2008 McIntyre composed the soundtrack for the Traverse Theatre Company production of Midsummer [a play with songs] by David Greig.

It was designed by Eurocom Entertainment Software and published by Taxan. ==Plot== According to the game's manual, an evil magician named Abadon was able to use his power to summon groups of evil beasts, and then built a castle for himself. He then sent out his followers to rid the peace-loving land of Merlwood of its most powerful wizards, a task that was accomplished with ease. While this was going on, a young man named Paul, an apprentice magician who lives in the land of Serenna, is preparing to go on a quest to travel across the land to learn all of the secrets from the ancient masters. However, he hears of the purging of wizards by Abadon, and instead sets out as the last wizard alive to defeat Abadon. ==Gameplay== Magician gameplay The game is officially labeled as a role-playing game, but it lacks almost every one of the characteristics of the genre: no freedom of backtracking, no optional side-quests, no weapons nor armor, not even attributes that rule probability of success in combat or spellcasting, no explicit experience levels, and the actual levels (\\"rating\\" in the game) have no effect on any attribute except the spell points maximum. The player must navigate him through puzzles and mazes in order to acquire more items, which allow Paul to learn more spells, and weapons, which allow him to cast certain spells or shield himself. More important, Paul is supposed to interact with people, which can help him along his quest. Apart from Paul's health, the player also keep in mind his food and water levels, which decrease over time and are refilled by using food and water. Paul sets out with some food, water, and money. The game uses a unique system for learning and using magic spells: the player transcribes spells by piecing together sets of phonemes to form magic words, and each spell has a corresponding word that must be written to learn it. Players can simply write the spell words for every single spell at the start of the game (although writing a spell costs 50 mana each). By helping other characters and completing various tasks, Paul grows more experienced, increasing his maximum mana and his rank as a magician. The game uses a battery-backed save system, which allows the player to save their progress at any time. However, it only allows the player to save a maximum of 15 times, with four different save slots to use. == Legacy == In December 2012 programmer Chris Shrigley released the source code for educational purposes to the public. ==References== ==External links== *Official website via Internet Archive * Category:1990 video games Category:Action role-playing video games Category:Commercial video games with freely available source code Category:Metroidvania games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System-only games Category:North America-exclusive video games Category:Platform games Category:Side-scrolling video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Eurocom games ","title":"Magician (video game)"},{"id":"2203206","text":"Martin McCarrick (born 29 July 1962, in Luton, Bedfordshire) is an English cellist, keyboardist, guitarist and composer.

He was featured on their 1987 album Through the Looking Glass and afterwards recorded three full studio albums: Peepshow, Superstition and The Rapture. His biggest hit with the band was in 1991 with the single \\"Kiss Them For Me\\" which reached Number 23 in the Billboard Hot 100. With Siouxsie and the Banshees he also contributed to the films Batman Returns and Showgirls. === 1995-present === McCarrick is also widely known for being part of 4AD records super group This Mortal Coil with whom he recorded three albums ‚Äì It'll End in Tears, Filigree and Shadow, and Blood. Alongside his work with This Mortal Coil he contributed to the recording and live performances of a number of 4AD acts including Dead Can Dance, The Wolfgang Press, Peter Murphy, Heidi Berry, Lush, Throwing Muses and Kristin Hersh. He was later a member of rock band Therapy?: he joined them in 1996 (his first gig as a full-time member being a secret fan-club show in Dublin, Ireland on 10 April 1996), having previously supplied guest cello work on their albums Troublegum and Infernal Love, as well as various live appearances with the band since 1992. During the bands UK tour in 2003, McCarrick perforated his ear-drum and had to leave mid-tour. His last show with Therapy? was in Glasgow, Scotland on 28 November 2003. McCarrick left Therapy? in March 2004. He has worked on and had music used for film, TV, radio and theatre. Film work includes The Garden (Derek Jarman), Batman Returns (Tim Burton), The Craft (Andrew Flemming), and La Proi (Eric Vallete). Collaboration He has also been associated with other musicians, recording and performing with This Mortal Coil, , Nick Cave, The The, Gary Numan, Biffy Clyro, Marianne Faithful and Bryan Ferry. Plus, he has become the cellist of choice for British rock bands, appearing on stage with both 3 Colours Red and Rico (to whose Violent Silences album he contributed). He and his wife, Kimberlee, a violinist, now work together as The McCarricks ‚Äì a live audio visual performance based show. They have toured extensively in the UK, USA and Europe and have written music for Channel 4, Embarrassing Bodies and the Animal Rights Society of the USA. In 2004, he performed again with Siouxsie on her Dreamshow performance, which featured a full orchestra and works from both her Siouxsie & the Bansheees as well as her The Creatures back catalogues. In 2006 McCarrick (along with Kimberlee McCarrick) took part in Patti Smith's Meltdown festival at The Royal Festival Hall in London where they performed with Sinead O'Connor, Marianne Faithful and Kristin Hersh. 2007-8 saw violin and cello duo The McCarricks tour the UK, Europe and USA. Two E.P releases followed ‚Äì '3' and 'The McCarricks', both on The McCarricks' own 'House of McCarrick' label.

Muhammad Salih was an Usuli Twelver Shi'i mujtahid. He opened the Salehiyya Madrasa in Qazvin in 1817; it soon gained prominence. As many as 700 students attended it. The madrasa also had a women's section. Muhammad Salih's older brother Mohammad Taqi was also a fervent Usuli. Against common practice, Muhammad Taqi took money for issuing legal opinions and putting them into writing. The younger of the brothers, Mulla Ali, was closer to Shaykhism in his beliefs. Muhammad Salih married Amineh Salehi, sister of an influential Shaykhi alim, Abd al-Wahhab Sharif Qazvini (d. 1853), imam of the Shah Mosque in Qazvin. Baraghani's wife as well as his four daughters studied in the Salehiyya. His oldest daughter Fatimah, better known as T√°hirih, was one of the most reputed religious scholars and poets of 19th century Iran. She eventually turned towards B√°bism and was eventually executed for her rejection of orthodox Twelver faith. His other daughters, Marziye, Robabeh and Khadija Sultan, also became religious authorities, though none was as prominent as Fatimah. Muhammad Salih Baraghani is remembered for his interpretations of the Qur'an, his eulogies of the tragedies of Karbala, his zeal for the execution of punishments, and active opposition to the consumption of wine. ==References== Category:Iranian Islamic religious leaders Category:1753 births Category:Year of death unknown ","title":"Muhammad Salih Baraghani"},{"id":"2203211","text":"A doll is a model of a human being, often a children's toy.

He is best known for his tenure with World Championship Wrestling, where he wrestled under the ring names Ice Train and M.I. Smooth. ==Professional wrestling careerWorld Championship Wrestling (1993‚Äì1994)=== On the July 7, 1993 edition of WorldWide, Hogue made his World Championship Wrestling debut under the ring name Ice Train by winning a handicap match. He later made his pay-per-view debut at the first-ever Fall Brawl event, where he defeated Shanghai Pierce. Hogue then teamed up with The Shockmaster and Charlie Norris and defeated Harlem Heat and The Equalizer at Halloween Havoc. However, Hogue's undefeated streak was broken after losing to Ron Simmons at Clash of the Champions on January 27, 1994. ===Catch Wrestling Association (1994‚Äì1996)=== Hogue wrestled for the Catch Wrestling Association from 1994 to 1995, and again in 1996. ===Return to WCW=== Fire and Ice (1996) After being absent from WCW for the rest of 1994 and all of 1995, Hogue returned to WCW on the February 14, 1996 edition of Saturday Night in a match against Scott Norton. The match ended in a double countout when both men clotheslined each other, knocking themselves out in the process. After the match, the two shook hands and Norton declared to announcer Gene Okerlund that he and Ice Train would become a formidable tag team because of their similar in-ring styles. The team was quickly named Fire and Ice with Norton representing \\"Fire\\" and Ice Train eponymously representing \\"Ice\\". The team easily overpowered numerous teams as they tried to establish themselves as a legitimate contender for the World Tag Team Championship. At Slamboree: Lord of the Ring, Ice Train and Norton were \\"randomly selected\\" to be on the same team and they easily defeated the makeshift team of \\"Big\\" Bubba Rogers and Stevie Ray in the first round of the Lethal Lottery tournament. After winning their match, both Ice Train and Norton advanced to the final round and competed in an eight-man battle royal, but neither was successful as Diamond Dallas Page eliminated both men and went on to win the Lethal Lottery tournament, earning a title shot in the process. Soon afterward, Fire and Ice began feuding with Norton's longtime rivals, The Steiner Brothers. After wrestling to a double countout on two separate occasions, the two teams faced off at the Great American Bash on June 16 to determine who would become the number one contenders to the WCW World Tag Team Championship. Scott Steiner pinned Norton after a Frankensteiner to earn the win for his team as well as the number one contendership. After the loss, Fire and Ice continued feuding with the Steiners, with the two powerhouse teams trying to prove who was best. After a sudden loss to The Rock 'n' Roll Express on an episode of Main Event before Bash at the Beach, dissension started to appear between Fire and Ice as Norton attacked Ice Train after another team loss. The team finally imploded when Norton faced and defeated Ice Train at Hog Wild on August 10 in a submission match after Norton made Ice Train submit to an armbar. However, Ice Train defeated Norton in a submission rematch on September 15 at Fall Brawl, when Norton submitted to a full nelson. Singles competition (1996-1998) After the implosion of Fire and Ice, Ice Train returned to singles competition in a loss to Diamond Dallas Page on the November 4, 1996 edition of Nitro and lost a rematch to Page on the following week's edition of Nitro. Ice Train then competed at World War 3, eliminating Mark Starr and Villano IV and even made it into the final ten, but he was eliminated from the match due to the combined efforts of Kevin Nash and Diamond Dallas Page. After World War 3, Ice Train returned to the undercard and gained Theodore Long as his manager for a very brief period. Ice Train began easily defeating opponents on Nitro and he soon became a mainstay on Pro. However, he soon continued his undercard role on WorldWide as well as on Thunder. ===Catch Wrestling Association (1997‚Äì1998)=== Hogue returned to the Catch Wrestling Association in 1997. ===Second return to WCW (2000‚Äì2001)=== In mid-2000, Hogue was again pushed into the spotlight as he became a member of The New Blood faction, who feuded with the Millionaire's Club. Hogue was renamed M.I. Smooth and served as Commissioner Ernest Miller's personal limo driver. Smooth regularly appeared in segments with various members of the New Blood. In early 2001, Smooth began a minor feud with Kanyon by brawling with him. On the March 19, 2001 edition of Nitro, Kanyon defeated Smooth. However, Smooth gained revenge two days later on Thunder as he teamed up with Ernest \\"The Cat\\" Miller to defeat Kanyon and Road Warrior Animal. Five days later, WCW broadcast its final edition of Nitro due to the company being bought out by the World Wrestling Federation, although Hogue would not be affected as he retired from wrestling soon after the merger. ==Personal life== Hogue helped train Toney Freeman for his career in bodybuilding. ==Championships and accomplishments== *Catch Wrestling Association **Catch Cup (1995) *Pro Wrestling Illustrated **PWI ranked him #221 of the best 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 1993 ==ReferencesCategory:African-American male professional wrestlers Category:American male professional wrestlers Category:Living people Category:Professional wrestlers from Florida Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Ice Train (wrestler)"},{"id":"2203220","text":"Garry Neill Kennedy, CM (born 1935 in St. Catharines, Ontario) is a Canadian conceptual artist from Halifax, Nova Scotia.

She is known as the periodical foster-mother of Queen Christina of Sweden and the mother of Charles X of Sweden. == Biography Early life=== Catherine was the daughter of King Charles IX of Sweden and his first spouse Maria of the Palatinate-Simmern. Her personality was described as \\"a happy union of her father's power and wisdom and her mother's tender humility\\". Her mother died in 1589, and she was placed in the care of the German Euphrosina Heldina von Dieffenau, whom she praised much later in life. In 1592, her father remarried to Christina of Holstein-Gottorp. She reportedly got along well with her stepmother and was close to her half siblings, especially her eldest brother, the future King Gustavus Adolphus, who is noted to have been very affectionate toward her. In later letters to her consort, however, it seems that she was not always as much in agreement with her stepmother as she gave the impression to be. Her father became regent in 1598, and was crowned king in 1607. In 1611, her brother succeeded her father as King Gustavus Adolphus. Her brother found her sensible and wise, and she is reported to have acted as his confidante and adviser on several occasions. Catherine married late for a Princess of her period. Although she was a great heiress, her status on the international royal marriage market was uncertain because of the political situation in Sweden after her father had conquered the throne from his nephew Sigismund. Her parents marriage had been an alliance with the anti-Habsburg party in Germany, which in turn was allied with King Henry IV of France and the French Huguenots, and in 1599‚Äì1600, there were plans to arrange a marriage between her and the Protestant French Prince Henri, Duke of Rohan, leader of the French Huguenots. Henry married Marguerite de B√©thune in 1603. After the Treaty of Kn√§red in 1613, her status became more secure. With the support of her stepmother Queen Dowager Christina, the queen dowager's brother Archbishop John Frederik of Bremen arranged the marriage between Catherine and her relative (Count Palatine) John Casimir of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken. Though relatively poor, he had contacts which were deemed valuable to Sweden, though Count Axel Oxenstierna opposed the marriage. The marriage took place on 11 June 1615 in Stockholm. Catherine was, by the will of both her parents as well as by the law regarding the dowry of Swedish Princesses, one of the wealthiest heirs in Sweden. As the economic situation at the time was strained, she remained in Sweden the first years after her marriage to guard her interests. In January 1618, she left for Germany. There, the couple was given the Kleeburg Castle in Northern Alsace as their residence. The year after, John Casimir started to build a new residence, the Renaissance Palace Katharinenburg near Kleeburg. In 1620, the Thirty Years' War forced them to flee to Strassburg. ===Return to Sweden=== In 1622, her brother King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden asked her to return to Sweden with her family. The death of her younger brother in Sweden, as well as the lack of heirs to the Swedish throne was evidently the reason why the monarch wished to move her to safety away from the Thirty Years' War. Catherine accepted the invitation and arrived to Sweden with her family in June 1622. At her arrival, the birth of her son Charles immediately strengthened her position. In Sweden, she and her consort were granted Stegeborg Castle and a county in √ñsterg√∂tland as their fief and residence and as payment of her dowry: Catherine was styled Countess of Stegeborg. Catherine and John Casimir settled in well at Stegeborg, where they maintained a royal standard of living: they kept a court with sixty formal ladies-in-waiting and courtiers and an official table.Nanna Lundh-Eriksson (1947). Hedvig Eleonora. Stockholm: Wahlstr√∂m & Widstrand. ISBN Catherine actively engaged herself in the management of the estates, and was in 1626 given Skenas royal estate as her personal fief. Catherine was on very good terms with her brother King Gustavus Adolphus, who is known to have asked her for advice. During his trips, he often asked her to try to console and control his consort, Queen Maria Eleonora. Catherine was exposed to certain intrigues at court with the purpose of blackening her name in the eyes of the royal couple, but she managed to avoid these plots. She was on good terms with the dynasties of Pfalz and Brandenburg, with whom she corresponded, and who considered her to be wise and to have good judgement. In 1631, Catherine was given the custody of her niece, Princess Christina, the heir to the throne, when the queen was allowed to join the king in Germany, where he participated in the Thirty Years' War. Christina remained in her care until Maria Eleonora returned to Sweden upon the death of Gustavus Adolphus in 1632. After the death of King Gustavus Adolphus, the couple came in conflict with the Guardian Government of Queen Christina over their position and rights to Stegeborg. When John Casimir broke with the royal council in 1633, the couple retired from court to Stegeborg. Catherine did not show any interest in participation in state affairs. In 1636, however, Queen Dowager Maria Eleonora was deemed an unsuitable guardian and deprived of the custody of the young monarch, and Catherine was appointed official guardian and foster mother with the responsibility of the young queen's upbringing. The appointment was made upon the recommendation of Count Axel Oxenstierna, and she reportedly accepted the task with reluctance. This appointment destroyed her relationship with Maria Eleonora. The years in Catherine's care are described by Christina as happy ones. Princess Catherine personally enjoyed great respect and popularity in Sweden as a member of the royal house and as the foster parent of the monarch: however, this respect did not include her consort, who was given no task or position at court whatsoever. John Casimir was himself careful to point out her rank as a Royal Princess, but he was himself exposed to some humiliation because of their difference in rank.Nanna Lundh-Eriksson (1947). Hedvig Eleonora. Stockholm: Wahlstr√∂m & Widstrand. ISBN One example was at the opening of Parliament in 1633, when Catherine in accordance with the wish of the Royal Council followed Queen Christina in the procession, while John Casimir was given the choice to stand and watch the ceremony from a window or not be present at all. Catherine died in V√§ster√•s, where the royal court had fled from an outbreak of plague in Stockholm. At her death, Axel Oxenstierna said, that he would rather have buried his own mother twice, than once again see \\"the premature death of this noble Princess\\".Nanna Lundh-Eriksson (1947). Hedvig Eleonora. Stockholm: Wahlstr√∂m & Widstrand.

It is part of the community of Neochori within the municipal unit of West Mani, in Messenia and the historic region of Mani Peninsula. Once a sleepy little town, in the past few years more and more tourists have discovered Stoupa. There are about 20 restaurants lining the road along the beach, a few small hotels, and many rental houses. Besides Greek tourists, who come mostly in August, British and German, as well as Dutch, French and Italian tourists visit in the summer season. ==Geography== Stoupa is located in an area of Greece called Outer Mani. Approximately from Stoupa is the village of Agios Nikolaos (also known as Selinitsa meaning small moon), a working fishing village which also has a number of restaurants and guest houses but which attracts fewer tourists than Stoupa. Above Agios Nikolaos is the lovely small village called Riglia. Other places in the Mani region include Itylo (), Limeni () and Areopoli (). Below Areopoli are the caves of Pirgos Dirou. Kalogria, a beach just outside Stoupa There are many beaches and coves around the area including Stoupa Beach, which is the most popular and has a good beginner's snorkeling site at the end of the beach. Over the hill is Kalogria Beach, with its turquoise waters and rich marine life, volleyball net, and a handful of bars and restaurants. One of the features of Kalogria beach is the upswelling of an underground freshwater spring about out from the shore. It can be seen as a disturbance on the surface of the sea. ==History== In the past, the Mani area was known for its fierce inhabitants, who lived in isolated fortified towers (some of which are still present today, either in ruins or having been restored). The towers offered protection in an area where feuding was commonplace. Stoupa also has rich cultural history. It is where the Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis travelled to with George Zorbas who Kazantzakis employed as the foreman of his lignite mine, the entrance to which can still be seen in a hillside nearby. It is their time together in Stoupa that the novel Zorba the Greek is based upon, written after hearing news of Zorba's death. There is a bust of Nikos Kazantzakis on the cliff overlooking Kalogria beach, at the corner of the main road and the beach approach. Stoupa is just 7 km away from the historic area of Kardamyli, which is mentioned in work by Homer. ==Transport== There are approximately four buses a day which call through Stoupa, running from Kalamata to the southern tip of the peninsula. The bus stops by the bakery, on the main road at the top of Stoupa and takes around ten minutes to reach Agios Nikolaos. Visitors can book coach trips to the ancient ruins of Olympia and the Corinth Canal. Another possibility is car rental, which allows travellers to take in the sights of places such as Nafplio, Mycenae, Epidavros, and Monemvasia on the Peloponnese. The area is serviced by Kalamata Airport where charter flights to the rest of Europe are operated in the summer season, as well as scheduled summer flights to Germany, Sweden, Norway, France, Ukraine and Russia operated by Aegean Airlines. ==References == ==External links== *Webcam *Stoupa Tourist Guide *Official Website Category:Populated places in Messenia ","title":"Stoupa"},{"id":"2203246","text":"Pete Heller.

The group extensively feuded with Lawler into the 1980s, a time particularly remembered for comedian Andy Kaufman's rivalry with Lawler. ;Members *Norvell Austin *Ox Baker *King Kong Bundy *Dennis Condrey *Sabu the Wildman *Chick Donovan *Bobby Eaton *Wayne Ferris *Buddy Landel *Austin Idol *Masao Ito *Kamala *Andy Kaufman *Larry Latham *Kendo Nagasaki *Jim Neidhart *Lanny Poffo *The Iron Sheik *Kevin Sullivan *Russian Invader *Len Denton *The Bruise Brothers (Porkchop Cash and Dream Machine) *Tony Anthony *Koko Ware *Rick Rude *Randy Savage *Eddie Gilbert *Tommy Rich ===WWF stable=== In 1985, When Hart got hired by WWF, he began becoming a manager of wrestlers including Greg Valentine and King Kong Bundy. he briefly co-managed The Dream Team (Beefcake and Valentine) until he was phased out and gave full control to Johnny Valiant. In September 1985, Hart traded Bundy to manager Bobby Heenan in exchange for Adrian Adonis and The Missing Link. ;Members *Greg Valentine *King Kong Bundy *Brutus Beefcake *Adrian Adonis *The Missing Link *Terry Funk *Hoss Funk *Bret Hart *Jim Neidhart *Danny Davis *The Honky Tonk Man *The Glamour Girls (Leilani Kai and Judy Martin) *Jacques Rougeau/The Mountie *Raymond Rougeau *Dino Bravo *Earthquake *Brian Knobbs *Jerry Sags *Typhoon *Ted DiBiase *Irwin R.

This short- lived group featured entirely different wrestlers than the Memphis version of the '70s and included former Dungeon members. They frequently appeared on WCW programs including Monday Nitro and primarily feuded with Fit Finlay. Hugh Morrus and Brian Knobs often tagged together, defeating members of Revolution at 1999's Fall Brawl and making a losing effort in a 3-way Tag Team Championship contest at Halloween Havoc. With an instrumental version of \\"The Zoo\\" as their entrance theme, the stable featured a variety of colorful wrestling personalities with unique ring styles: Jerry Flynn demonstrated martial arts strikes and submissions while Brian Knobs utilized a rougher brawling style. Considering publicity photos were taken of the group, WCW's First Family was likely intended for a substantial run; however, according to Hart, the group quickly disbanded due to injuries sustained by numerous members as well as new bookers hired by WCW. In the aftermath of The First Family, Knobs and Hart pursued WCW's hardcore scene that was on the rise in late 1999. ;Members *Barbarian *Jerry Flynn *Brian Knobs *Hugh Morrus ==Championships and accomplishments== Continental Wrestling Association *AWA International Heavyweight Championship (7 times) - Tommy Rich (1), Eddie Gilbert (2), Austin Idol (4) *NWA Mid-America Heavyweight Championship (14 times) - Tommy Rich (1), Bobby Eaton (10), Randy Savage (3) *AWA Southern Heavyweight Championship (10 times) - Tommy Rich (5), King Kong Bundy (1), Austin Idol (3), Rick Rude (1) *AWA Southern Tag Team Championship (1 time) - King Kong Bundy and Rick Rude *AWA Southern Tag Team Championship (2 times) Porkchop Cash and Dream Machine *CWA World Tag Team Championship (1 time) Dennis Condrey and Norvell Austin ==Notes== Category:Independent promotions teams and stables Category:World Championship Wrestling teams and stables Category:1998 in professional wrestling ","title":"The First Family (professional wrestling)"},{"id":"2203263","text":"Werner Stengel (born 22 August 1936 in Bochum) is a German roller coaster designer and engineer. Stengel is the founder of Stengel Engineering, also known as Ingenieurb√ºro Stengel GmbH (or Ingenieurbuero Stengel GmbH). Stengel first worked on amusement park rides in collaboration with Anton Schwarzkopf in 1963. He established his own company, Stengel Engineering, in 1965. His collaboration with Schwarzkopf was responsible for many innovations in roller coaster design, including in 1976 the first modern \\"vertical\\" looping coaster, Revolution, at Six Flags Magic Mountain. (Arrow Dynamics had debuted the first modern \\"corkscrew\\" loop a year earlier at Knott's Berry Farm). His clothoid loop is now standard on many roller coasters, as it produces less intense forces on the human body than a circular vertical loop. In 1976 Stengel and Schwarzkopf established the first horizontal launch \\"Shuttle Loop\\". He is notable for being a pioneer in heartlining, the principle of having the track twist and rotate around the rider's heart line, rather than the track rotating around its own center. Since Schwarzkopf's retirement, Stengel has worked on most of the world's record-breaking roller coasters, including Son of Beast, Millennium Force, Superman The Ride, Top Thrill Dragster, Kingda Ka, Dollywood's Mystery Mine, El Toro, Maverick and Olympia Looping, the world's largest portable roller coaster, among many others. Seventy-two percent of the attractions on the 2004 Amusement Today Golden Ticket Awards list of the world's top fifty steel roller coasters were designed by Stengel Engineering. Stengel received an honorary doctorate from Gothenburg University in 2005 for \\"inexhaustible creativity in linking physics and design to the experience of the body in roller coasters and other rides,\\" among the most highly regarded of which is Lisebergbanan at Liseberg park in Gothenburg, Sweden. In 2002, he designed the \\"Stengel Dive,\\" the roller coaster element that bears his name, for Goliath at Walibi Holland, Netherlands. Stengel celebrated his 500th roller coaster with the opening of Maverick, located at Cedar Point. He is semi-retired and serves as a consultant to the amusement park ride industry. ==References== ==External links== * Official website of Stengel Engineering Category:1936 births Category:Living people Category:People from Bochum Category:Amusement ride manufacturers Category:Roller coaster designers Category:Engineers from North Rhine-Westphalia Category:Recipients of the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany ","title":"Werner Stengel"},{"id":"2203266","text":"Magic Kingdom is a Belgian power metal band,formed in 1998 by Belgian guitarist Dushan Petrossi. ==Timeline== ==Discography== *The Arrival (1999) *Metallic Tragedy (2004) *Symphony of War (2010) *Savage Requiem (2015) *MetAlmighty (2019) ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Musical groups established in 1998 Category:Power metal musical groups Category:Belgian heavy metal musical groups ","title":"Magic Kingdom (band)"},{"id":"2203268","text":"Deruta is a hill town and comune in the Province of Perugia in the Umbria region of central Italy. Long known as a center of refined maiolica manufacture, Deruta remains known for its ceramics, which are exported worldwide. ==History== Probably built upon Roman foundations, Deruta's name in its early variants (Ruto, Ruta, Rupta, Direpta and Diruta) all signify the ‚Äúruin‚Äù of this strategic site caused by the 6th-century Gothic War and the Lombard invasion. The Medieval commune that rose from these ruins had its own charter in the 13th century and was governed from its own Palazzo of the Consuls, but in fact Deruta has been under the dominion of neighboring Perugia since the 11th century, and has largely participated in Perugia's vicissitudes. The town's fortifications date from the 12th century, when it was an outpost in Perugia's marches, facing the rival town of Todi. In 1465, under a new agreement with Perugia, the magistrate sent from Perugia would govern with the consent of four local men of good character (quattro boni omini). The ravages of plague were so fierce at Deruta that rewalling in the later 15th century took in a smaller circuit to accommodate the reduced population. Besieged in 1408 during the confusion of the Papal Schism by the condottiere Braccio da Montone, and later heavily damaged by Cesare Borgia, Deruta was plundered by Braccio Baglioni, the master of Perugia. Thus in 1540, when the Papal forces of Pope Paul III ousted the Baglioni family from Perugia in the brief war over salt taxes locally called the \\"Salt War\\" (Guerra del Sale), Deruta sided with the papacy against Perugia, an alliance that gained it a reduction in taxes. With the papal reduction of Perugia, the region settled down to uneventful history as part of the Papal States. ==Ceramics== Deruta, maiolica tiles The local clay was good for ceramics, whose production began in the Early Middle Ages, but found its artistic peak in the 15th and early 16th century, with highly characteristic local styles of maiolica, such as the \\"Bella Donna\\" plates with conventional portraits of beauties, whose names appear on fluttering banderoles with flattering inscriptions. The lack of fuel enforced low firing temperatures, but from the beginning of the 16th century, Deruta became (with Gubbio) a specialist centre for metallic lustreware in golds and ruby red, added over the glaze. In the 16th century Deruta produced the so-called \\"Rafaellesque\\" ware, decorated with fine arabesques and grottesche on a fine white ground. Deruta, with Gubbio and Urbino, continues to produce some of the finest Italian maiolica. ==Main sights== *San Francesco: Gothic-style church built in 1388 and located in the town center. *Palazzetto Municipale (Town Hall), also called Palazzo dei Consoli: building dates from about 1300, located on the Piazza dei Consoli (the \\"Square of the Consuls\\"). In addition to the usual governmental offices, the municipal hall houses a Museum of Ceramics, an art gallery (Pinacoteca), and a capacious atrium in which one can view a variety of archaeological finds, some of which date to Neolithic times. The municipal Pinacoteca holdings consist of a fresco by Perugino, depicting San Romano and San Rocco (1476), and the collection donated by a local patron, Lione Pascoli, which includes works by Niccol√≤ di Liberatore, called Alunno, Giovan Battista Gaulli, Sebastiano Conca, Francesco Trevisani, Antonio Amorosi, Francesco Graziani and Pieter Van Bloemen. The gallery also houses works received from various Deruta churches including San Francesco, Sant' Antonio, the Defunti di Ripabianca and the Ospedale San Giacomo. *Sant'Antonio: church with frescoes by Bartolommeo and Giovanni Battista Caporali, rises at the end of a narrow street, Via Mastro Giorgio. *Madonna del Divino Amore on Piazza Cavour. *Madonna delle Piagge church along the Tiberina road, at the foot of the old town, yet another church, clad in a colorful array of ceramic tiles.

Nauta is located on the north bank of the Mara√±√≥n River, a major tributary of the Upper Amazon, a few miles from the confluence of the R√≠o Ucayali. Established by Manuel Pacaya‚ÄìSamiria, a leader of the Cocama peoples, following the 1830 uprising at the Jesuit mission of Lagunas, Nauta soon became the primary commercial hub of the Peruvian selva baja (known also as Omagua, or the Amazonian lowlands).William Smyth and Frederick Lowe, 1836:204, 258 In 1853, a Brazilian owned paddle steamer made it all the way to Nauta.Edward Mathews, 1879 Nauta is the primary destination of the only major road leading out of Iquitos, and is a staging area for several ecotourism lodges and ships on the Mara√±√≤n River. Boats take passengers from Nauta to the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve. == Areas of Interest == Nauta is home to many unique features of nature.Traveling in Peru: The Amazon Lowlands. Peru: Nelles Guide, 2001. One example is the Sapi Sapi lagoon, where many exotic animals are found, such as the Yellow-spotted river turtle, the pirarucu fish, crocodiles, and the Arrau turtle. For those interested in seeing these animals up close, the option to take a boat around the lagoon is available. According to legend, there was once a mysterious mermaid that attracted locals with her clothing and natural beauty. Another attraction is the Playa del Amor, located on the outskirts of Nauta and surrounded by jungle. Another highlight is the Quebrada Gasparito, another natural area that can be accessed by canoe and is known to be a relaxing getaway spot. At the center of town is another attraction, the Plaza de Armas (see Plaza de Armas) and is characterized by the diversity of mythical statues made up by local residents that represent the native culture of the area. The Iglesia de Nauta, which is now used as a local parish theater, can also be found in the plaza, along with a school and bronze bust both named after Manuel Pacaya. A few streets past the plaza is the local marketplace where local customers and merchants from all over come to exchange goods. Nauta is also the access point to the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve. In order to enter the reserve, a permit must be purchased from the National Institute of Natural Resources (INRENA). Interested parties may enter by river through the community of 20 de febrero.

Later his family relocated to Des Moines, Iowa. He played guitar but switched to bass after he relocated to Iowa. In his youth, Gray performed in bands such as Anal Blast, Vexx, Body Pit, The Have Nots and Inveigh Catharsis. In June 2003, Gray crashed his car into another vehicle. After police were called to the scene and searched his car, Gray was arrested for possession of marijuana, cocaine and drug paraphernalia, as well as failure to obey a traffic signal. At the time of his death, he was one of three original members of Slipknot remaining in the band, and the only one who had maintained his original role in the band due to Clown's switch from main drums to percussion during the early days. He was one of the two members not born in Iowa (the other is Jim Root, who was born in Las Vegas). In 2010, Slipknot released the Download 2009 performance on DVD in memory of Gray. Besides Slipknot, Gray filled in as bassist for Unida during their 2003 tour, appeared on the album Worse Than a Fairy Tale by the band Drop Dead, Gorgeous, toured briefly with Reggie and the Full Effect and appeared on the Roadrunner United project, performing bass on \\"The Enemy\\" and \\"Baptized in the Redemption\\" from the project's album The All-Star Sessions.

An initial autopsy determined that no foul play or trauma was involved, but could not establish the cause of death. He is survived by his wife Brenna and their daughter October, who was born after his death. On June 21, 2010, autopsy results were released that stated Gray had died of an overdose of morphine, and had also shown signs of \\"significant heart disease\\". Also found in the autopsy were traces of anti-anxiety pill Xanax, which Gray had a history of abusing. ===Aftermath=== On the day after Gray's death, May 25, 2010, the band, without their usual masks, held a formal press conference in Des Moines, Iowa. They did not take any questions from the media. The band, as well as Gray's brother, Tony, and wife, Brenna, paid tribute to him. A private funeral was held on May 28, 2010. Paul Gray was buried at the Highland Memory Gardens Cemetery in Des Moines, Iowa.

Slipknot's former guitarist Donnie Steele filled in on bass guitar for Gray on Slipknot's 2011 Summer tour. Slipknot shows during this time featured Paul's jumpsuit and Self-Titled era pig mask on a stand, along with a bass guitar standing next to it. Fans honored Gray with a two- minute silence during the band's headline set at Sonisphere Festival, Knebworth. Corey Taylor also got a tattoo of Gray and his number on the back of his left leg, which was documented in the television series NY Ink, during the second episode of season one. ===Trial against physician=== In September 2012, Gray's physician Daniel Baldi was charged with involuntary manslaughter relating to Gray's death, as well as the deaths of at least seven others. He was accused of continually writing high-dose prescription narcotics to Gray from December 27, 2005 until his death, despite knowing Gray's history of drug addiction and abuse. The doctor appeared in court on September 27, 2012 to face the charges, to which he pleaded not guilty. On May 1, 2014, jurors found Daniel Baldi not guilty on all seven counts of involuntary manslaughter following two days of deliberation. Gray's wife Brenna had testified during the two-week-long trial that Baldi prescribed the anti-anxiety drug Xanax to her husband, despite knowing he was addicted to the prescription medicine. In January 2018 the family received an out of court settlement from a civil lawsuit they had filed against Dr. Daniel Baldi and his former employers. Two months later the Iowa Board of Pharmacy permanently banned Baldi from being able to prescribe, administer or dispense controlled substances for the treatment of chronic pain. == Discography == { style=\\"background:none; padding:4pt;\\" - valign=\\"top\\" ;With Slipknot * 1996: Mate.

At this time, it only educated students to Year 10; the year of completion of the Junior Certificate. Students then went on to attend the Gladstone State High School to complete Senior studies. After Brother John left the School, Brother Colin Marstin became Principal around 1978, and together with Brother Gonzaga, and Brother Joachim continued the efforts of the Marist Brother teachings. At this time the school became known as the Gladstone Catholic High School. It was the first Private Secondary school opened to serve Gladstone's youth, it still achieves its purpose.

The newspaper was founded in 1996 as a sports-only newspaper called The Title, but was soon expanded into a general broadsheet Sunday newspaper with its founder, former County Meath Gaelic football player Liam Hayes, carrying on as editor. The paper was considered a 'middle-market' publication. ==History== The Title was founded in 1996 by journalists Liam Hayes and Cathal Dervan. Hayes, a former captain of the Meath Gaelic football team who made five All-Ireland final appearances, had worked with Dervan at the Meath Chronicle before spending seven years at the Sunday Press, a national newspaper which folded in 1995. The Title focused exclusively on sports, covering events from local to international in scale.Impossible dream The newspaper attracted a niche audience, garnering a circulation of 29,000.Groups in talks on new daily newspaper On 21 September 1997, the publication was relaunched as Ireland on Sunday, a three-section, full-colour broadsheet newspaper incorporating The Title as its tabloid-format sports section. The venture was backed by a consortium of Irish and Irish-American investors, headed by the property developer Paschal Taggart. The consortium invested a total of ¬£4m, with ¬£1.5m being spent on aggressive marketing in the first year.New Irish newspaper within a fortnight The paper sought to capture some of the former readers of the Sunday Press, which had a circulation of 150,000 before its demise. Hayes said before launch that Ireland on Sunday aimed to \\"reflect the thoughts, the values and the desires of a 32-county Ireland\\". The newspaper met with success and the first issue's run of 120,000 sold out. Circulation settling at 66,863 by March 1998, well above its launch-day estimate of 40,000 within two years. However, financial difficulties forced Hayes to remortgage his house and ask the company's directors for ‚Ç¨50,800 each to keep the title afloat. In July 2000, Ireland on Sunday was sold to Scottish Radio Holdings for approximately ‚Ç¨10.16 million, with Hayes remaining in place as editor. However, in December of that year, he resigned from his post, to be replaced by former Evening Herald editor Paul Drury.Founding editor of \`Ireland on Sunday' resigns In July 2001 it was announced that Associated Newspapers, the national newspaper arm of the Daily Mail and General Trust, had bought Ireland on Sunday from Scottish Radio Holdings for ¬£7.4 million.

Its editor during this period, former Scotsman editor Martin Clarke, was accused of anglicising the formerly Irish nationalist title. On 21 September 2006, DMGT announced that the previous weekend's edition of Ireland on Sunday had been the last under that masthead, completing its transition to becoming the Irish Mail on Sunday.THE IRISH MAIL ON SUNDAY - Factsheet  Publicitas in Austria The newspaper was already informally considered to be the Irish edition of the Mail on Sunday and used a variation of that newspaper's masthead and editorial style, but DMGT's move made that transition complete. The UK edition of the Mail on Sunday was withdrawn from the Irish market in line with this. ==Editorial line== IoS (as it was nicknamed) was aimed at the traditional Irish nationalist readers who had read The Sunday Press, leading it to adopt an Irish nationalist slant. It sold more copies in Northern Ireland (11,000-12,000) per week than any other Dublin-based weekly newspaper.

She is considered a pioneer in her use of the romantic novel to explore social and racial themes. ==Early life== Hopkins was born to Benjamin Northup and Sarah Allen in Portland, Maine, and grew up in Boston, Massachusetts. Her father was influential in Providence, Rhode Island, due to his political ties and her mother was a native of Exeter, New Hampshire. Though he was not her biological father, William Hopkins was regarded by Pauline as her father, hence her surname. Hopkins' mother, Sarah Allen, was married for a short time to Benjamin Northup and it is from said union that she was born. Allegations of infidelity led to Allen filing for divorce and shortly afterwards she met and married. The high-achieving Hopkins household encouraged Pauline academically, which led her to develop an appreciation for literature. In 1874, after completing her second year at Girls High School, she entered an essay contest held by the Congregational Publishing Society of Boston and funded by former slave, novelist, and dramatist William Wells Brown. Her submission, \\"Evils of Intemperance and Their Remedy\\", highlighted the problems with intemperance and urged parents to be in control of their children's social upbringing. She placed first in the contest, won $10 in gold, and was honored by the judges for her excellent writing skills. Before she was noted as a legendary journalist, she rose to fame by catching the public's attention through her various roles as a dramatist, actress and singer. In March 1877, she participated in her first dramatic performance, Pauline Western, the Belle of Saratoga. After this, she acted in several other plays, which all received great reviews. However, it was not until the beginning of the 1900s that she decided to focus more on her literary passions. == Literary career == Her first known work, a musical play called Slaves‚Äô Escape; or, The Underground Railroad (later revised as Peculiar Sam; or, The Underground Railroad), first performed in 1880. Her short story \\"Talma Gordon\\", published in 1900, is often named as the first African-American mystery story. She explored the difficulties faced by African-Americans amid the racist violence of post-Civil War America in her first novel, Contending Forces: A Romance Illustrative of Negro Life North and South, published in 1900. She published three serial novels between 1901 and 1903 in the African-American periodical Colored American Magazine: Hagar's Daughter: A Story of Southern Caste Prejudice, Winona: A Tale of Negro Life in the South and Southwest, and Of One Blood: Or, The Hidden Self. She sometimes used the pseudonym Sarah A. Allen. Pauline Hopkins was beginning to make a reputation for herself. As a result of this, she was offered the opportunity to become a member of the board of directors, a shareholder and a creditor of the Colored American Magazine. Along with her writing, she helped to increase subscriptions and raise funding for the magazine. These roles alone helped her break into the literary world, with her work making up a substantial amount of the literary and historical materials promoted by the magazine. After her involvement with the Colored American Magazine, Hopkins published four additional stories and serialized three novels, Hagar's Daughter: A Story of Caste Prejudice, Winona: A Tale of Negro Life in the South and Southwest, and Of One Blood; or The Hidden Self, in the Colored American Magazine. Her work has been regarded among other notable African-American writers at the time such as Charles Chesnutt, Paul Laurence Dunbar, and Sutton Griggs by Richard Yarborough. In relation to women's publications, Yarborough calls her \\"the single most productive black woman writer at the turn of the century.\\" Of One Blood: Or, The Hidden Self is the last of four novels written by Pauline Hopkins. She is considered by some to be the most prolific African-American woman writer and the most influential literary editor of the first decade of the 20th century, though she is lesser known than many literary figures of the Harlem Renaissance. Of One Blood: Or, The Hidden Self first appeared in serial form in The Colored American Magazine in the November and December 1902 and the January 1903 issues of the publication, during the four-year period in which Hopkins served as its editor. Elements of the work have been compared to Goethe's Faust.\\"‚ÄòInto the high ancestral spaces‚Äô: Pauline Hopkins\` Of One Blood and Goethe's Faust\\", Sabine Isabell Engwer, Free University of Berlin, John F. Kennedy Institute for North American Studies. Of One Blood: Or, The Hidden Self tells the story of Reuel Briggs, a medical student who does not care about being black or appreciating African history but finds himself in Ethiopia on an archaeological trip. His motive is to raid the country of lost treasures, which he does find. However, he discovers much more than he expected: the painful truth about blood, race, and the half of his history that was never told. Hopkins wrote the novel intending, in her own words, to \\"raise the stigma of degradation from [the Black] race.\\" The title, Of One Blood, refers to the biological kinship of all human beings. In 1988, Oxford University Press released The Schomburg Library of Nineteenth-Century Black Women Writers with Professor Henry Louis Gates as the general editor of the series. Hopkins' novel Contending Forces: A Romance Illustrative of Negro Life North and South (with an introduction by Richard Yarborough) was reprinted as a part of this series. Her magazine novels (with an introduction by Hazel Carby) were also reprinted as a part of this series. Carby did this as a way to reintroduce Hopkins into the sphere and see how her literature influenced writers in the past, present and now future. == Legacy == Despite the climate of racism and other social injustices going on during this time, Hopkins made her voice, especially the black voice, known throughout history. She was fearful of the consequences of her actions, but also knew it was necessary for the world to know the struggles of being black in the United States in the 1900s. Other scholars, including Hopkins, have accredited her boldness in her writing on behalf of her parents and the example they set for her. \\"The Northup legacy that Pauline Hopkins would claim as her own was one of impressive public action, fearless civic ambition and strong community consciousness.\\" == Death == Hopkins spent the remainder of her years working as a stenographer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, from burns sustained in a house fire. ==Published works== *Slaves‚Äô Escape; or, The Underground Railroad, 1880. *Contending Forces: A Romance Illustrative of Negro Life North and South, 1900. *\\"Talma Gordon\\".

The character is best known as the mailman of the Fantastic Four in their self-titled comic book. ==Publication historyNewspaper comic strip=== Willie Lumpkin in the 1959-61 comic strip. Art by Dan DeCarlo. The character was originally created for a syndicated daily comic strip by writer Stan Lee and artist Dan DeCarlo. Lee recalled in a 1998 interview that, Willie Lumpkin drew humor from the people and situations Willie would encounter along his mail delivery route in the small town of Glenville. The daily strip ran from December 1959 to May 6, 1961. A Sunday strip ran through May 28. ===Marvel Comics=== Lee and artist Jack Kirby then introduced their comic book version of Willie Lumpkin in Fantastic Four #11 (Feb. 1963). The comic book Lumpkin is depicted as significantly older than in the comic strip, though the character's good nature was retained, as were references to his past as a mailman in Glenville, which the comic book placed in Nebraska. In his first comic book appearance, Lumpkin is represented as having befriended the Fantastic Four, to whom he makes regular fan mail deliveries at their Baxter Building headquarters in New York City. He half- jokingly requests to join the team on the grounds that he has the \\"power\\" to wiggle his ears. Lumpkin appeared in his own solo feature in Marvel Comics Presents #18 (May 1989). In this parody of A Christmas Carol, he is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past, who had intended to haunt cantankerous Spider-Man nemesis J. Jonah Jameson but couldn't find his address. The story concludes with the normally amiable postman deciding he hates Christmas. ==Fictional character biography== In Marvel Comics, Willie Lumpkin serves as the postal worker mailman whose Manhattan route includes the joint home and office of the superhero group the Fantastic Four. On occasion he falls into the danger that typically surrounds the adventuring heroes. Examples include a story in which he is forced to spend Christmas Eve locked in a closet while the Fantastic Four fight the Super-Skrull, or when he helped to save the team from the Mad Thinker. This incident involved Reed's trust in Lumpkin; he had hired the mailman to manipulate the machinery as part of a safety routine.\\"Fantastic Four\\" Vol 1. #15 (June 1963) Later Lumpkin is mind-controlled into accessing Doctor Doom's time machine by a minion of Immortus. An alien Skrull also impersonates him in another story to infiltrate the Fantastic Four's headquarters. He also briefly dated Peter Parker's Aunt May.The Amazing Spider-Man #343 (Jan. 1991) at the Grand Comics Database. When May briefly appeared to have died, Lumpkin grieved and was seen to befriend a new companion named Doreen Greenwald.Spider-Man Holiday Special, 1995 (1995) at the Grand Comics Database. Lumpkin has since retired, and his niece Wilhemina \\"Billie\\" Lumpkin has taken his position as the Fantastic Four's mail carrier.Fantastic Four vol. 3, #2 (Feb. 1998) at the Grand Comics Database He was interviewed about the Fantastic Four on the news show Lateline,Fantastic Four #543 (April 2007) at the Grand Comics Database saying how though the group took on cosmic menaces, they always found time to greet him. Sometime later, the super-team, miniaturized, entered his body to remove an otherwise inoperable brain tumor.Fantastic Four #606 (July 2012) at the Grand Comics Database Lumpkin was later hired as a biology teacher for the 'Future Foundation', a school founded by the Fantastic Four.FF #5 (2013) Willie enjoyed a trip to the moon when the Future Foundation and associates decided to hold a party.FF #16 (2014) ==Other versionsMarvels=== Marvels is a \\"history\\" of the world of Marvel super-heroes painted by Alex Ross and which spans from the late 1930s to the 1960s. In one scene, main character Phil Sheldon, a journalist who observes the Marvel characters from a distance (and sometimes close-up), meets his ex-girlfriend in a movie theatre where she introduces him to her date, Bill Lumpkin. With a smile, Lumpkin tells Sheldon that they have met though he states that Sheldon will not remember where, causing the reporter a little embarrassment.\\"Marvels\\" Vol. 1 #1 (Jan. 1994) ===Ultimate Marvel=== In the Ultimate Marvel Universe, there is a government agent named Lumpkin, who works for the agency that runs the think-tank/school in the Baxter Building. His first name is not mentioned. He is in his forties and overweight. He is initially shown recruiting Reed Richards.Ultimate Fantastic Four #1 (Feb. 2004) He has expressed a romantic interest in Grimm's mother. Lumpkin and three of his men assist the Four in confronting the Mad Thinker, a former Baxter Building student. The entire group is knocked out by tranquilizing chemicals. Reed saves everyone.Ultimate Fantastic Four #19-20 (July 2005 - August 2005) ==In other mediaTelevision=== *Lumpkin appears in the Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes episode \\"My Neighbor was a Skrull\\" voiced by Colin Murdock. ===Film=== * Lumpkin appears in the 2005 Fantastic Four film portrayed by Stan Lee. Identified on-screen only as Willie, he is portrayed as a chipper mailman who delivers a letter to Dr. Richards as the Fantastic Four arrive at the Baxter Building.

Paid professionals, many of whom were YMCA leaders, were recruited to help start new Troops and spread the new Scouting program. They were sent out into the San Gabriel Valley towns to organize new troops and recruit leaders. By March 1919, there were nine active troops with 190 boys in the SGV. The Pasadena Council (also known as the Pasadena District Council) of the Boy Scouts of America was organized March 3, 1919, with jurisdiction over Pasadena, Altadena and Lamanda Park. A charter was granted by the BSA National Headquarters dated April 1, 1919 to the Pasadena District Council. Tallman Trask was hired to be the first Scout Executive. Trask had been a District Executive for the Los Angeles Council. He had also served as Los Angeles' camp director. Prior to joining the BSA, Trask was an executive for the YMCA and had run several camps for them. By October 1, 1919, there were 15 active troops with 299 Scouts. The council's name was changed in 1929 to Pasadena-San Gabriel Valley Council to better reflect the geographic area served by the council. In 1951 the name was changed to San Gabriel Valley Council to shorten it and better identify the 29 cities and towns that made it up. ==Organization== * Golden Eagle District ** City of Industry, Hacienda Heights, La Puente, Rowland Heights, West Covina, Valinda, Diamond Bar, Pomona and Walnut.Golden Eagle District Web siteGolden Eagle District history ** The cities of Diamond Bar, Pomona and Walnut were added to Golden Eagle District when Old Baldy Council was split at the Los Angeles‚ÄìSan Bernardino county line on May 1, 2006, and was merged into the San Gabriel Valley Council and California Inland Empire Council. * Lucky Baldwin District ** Arcadia, Monrovia, Sierra Madre, Azusa, Bradbury, Duarte, Irwindale, and Temple City.Lucky Baldwin District Web site * Mission Amigos District ** Alhambra, Monterey Park, El Monte, San Gabriel, South San Gabriel and Rosemead. ** The city of Rosemead was part of the former El Camino Real District until 2007. * Rose Bowl District ** Altadena, La Ca√±ada Flintridge, Pasadena and San Marino. * Valle De Sol District ** Covina, Glendora, Charter Oak, La Verne, San Dimas and Claremont.Valle Del Sol District web site ** The cities of La Verne, San Dimas and Claremont were added to Valle De Sol District when Old Baldy Council was split at the Los Angeles‚ÄìSan Bernardino county line on May 1, 2006 and was merged into San Gabriel Valley Council and California Inland Empire Council. * Former district called: Trails of the Valley District was moved into the Lucky Baldwin District and Mission Amigos District in 2010. ** Azusa, Baldwin Park, Bradbury, Duarte, Irwindale, El Monte and South El Monte. ** Formerly known as San Gabriel River District. ** The cities of El Monte and South El Monte were part of the former El Camino Real District until 2007. ==Camps== * Holt Scout Ranch (now closed) was an SGVC camp located in the San Bernardino Mountains.

They later became major stars in Lutte Internationale. Their most notable feud in Montreal was against the Garvin brothers, Ron Garvin and Jimmy Garvin (who were not actually brothers); the climax of their feud was a match in front of close to 20,000 fans at the Montreal Forum. They were signed to World Wrestling Federation (WWF) contracts in February 1986, and debuted as clean- cut faces, The Rougeau Brothers. The Rougeaus were often matched against heel teams such as The Dream Team and Demolition. The latter team coined the nickname the \\"Rag√∫ sisters\\" for the brothers - this would later be revived after the Rougeaus' eventual heel turn by such face opponents as The Rockers, The Bushwhackers and Demolition who had made their own (face) turn. The Rougeaus actually won the WWF Tag Team Championship on August 10, 1987 at the Forum, in a House Show, defeating The Hart Foundation. Jimmy Hart, the Hart Foundation's manager, tried to interfere on their behalf with his signature foreign object, a megaphone. The megaphone was intercepted by the Rougeaus, who used it to get the pin and win the titles. They were announced as the new tag team champions, but the decision was later reversed and their title win was never recognized by the WWF. Nearly a year after this event, the Rougeaus made a gradual turn to heel. An early indication of this came during a televised match against The Killer Bees, which aired during July 1988. Both teams went into the match as babyfaces, but the Rougeaus won the match by cheating. After the match, fans booed when the Rougeaus offered to shake hands with the Bees, who refused. Also during this period of time, old rivals the Hart Foundation had turned babyface and dumped \\"The Mouth of the South\\" Jimmy Hart as their manager. Jimmy became manager of the Rougeaus to solidify their heel turn and to solidify The Hart Foundation's babyface turn. This was also done in part because the Rougeau Brothers were not getting over with fans, and Vince McMahon felt they might be more successful as heels. The Rougeaus began calling themselves The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers and feuded with the Hart Foundation during the fall of 1988 into early 1989, with the storyline being that Jimmy Hart still had a contract with the Hart Foundation, and was subsequently giving his percentage of the Foundation's earnings to the Rougeaus as a bonus. The Rougeaus developed a facetiously pro-American gimmick, billing themselves as \\"soon to relocate to Memphis, Tennessee\\" and using the theme song \\"All-American Boys\\". The theme song was an upbeat rock number, sung by the Rougeaus themselves, would further rile the fans by claiming their affinity for \\"whitebread\\" things like \\"preppy\\" hairstyles and Barry Manilow's music. The bridge of the song (in French) admits they are aware the fans despise them, slyly confirming that their ingratiating demeanor is phony and done to mock the fans. To draw even more heat, they would wave comically small American flags and try to start a \\"U.S.A.\\" chant just to annoy the crowd. The Rougeaus had a real-life altercation with Tom Billington (the Dynamite Kid from The British Bulldogs) backstage in 1988. \\"Mr. Perfect\\" Curt Hennig had framed the Bulldogs in a prank at the Rougeaus' expense, leading to the Dynamite Kid (upset about being incorrectly blamed) slapping Jacques from behind in the locker room in Miami and repeatedly punching him in the face. Tension between Dynamite and the Rougeaus mounted for more than a week until Jacques punched him in the mouth with a roll of quarters in hand before the next TV tapings in Fort Wayne, Ind., causing Dynamite to lose four teeth. After the attack, Billington harbored a grudge against the Rougeaus, and it was feared Dynamite might try to get revenge after their 10-team, 20-man elimination match at the Survivor Series 1988 PPV (which was his final match in the WWF). The match had the Rougeaus, Demolition, Brain Busters, The Bolsheviks, and Los Conquistadores vs. The British Bulldogs, The Rockers, The Hart Foundation, The Young Stallions, and The Powers of Pain. For fear of the Dynamite Kid taking his revenge, the match was booked so the Rougeaus were the first team eliminated, with Bret Hart pinning Raymond in the bout's opening minutes with a small package. The Bulldogs were kept in the match until they were one of the final four teams remaining. By the time the Bulldogs had been eliminated and made their way back to the locker room, the Rougeaus had already been rushed out of the building. During the actual match, Dynamite worked with the Rougeaus without incident. The Rougeaus' next big feud was against The Rockers in 1989. The feud began when the Rockers debuted a new theme song for themselves with them singing (this new theme was soon dropped, however). The Rougeaus claimed that the Rockers were \\"copycats,\\" and hit Shawn Michaels in the throat with Jimmy Hart's megaphone. The teams feuded over the summer of 1989, producing many excellent, raved-about matches. At SummerSlam 89, the Rougeaus teamed with fellow Canadian Rick Martel, defeating the Rockers and Martel's former Strike Force tag-team partner Tito Santana in a six-man tag team match. After their initial feuds against the face teams of the era, the Rougeaus quickly devolved into a comedy tag team, often coming out on the short end against The Bushwhackers. Raymond, who suffered from chronic back pain for years, retired in 1990 and moved behind the microphone; briefly as an interviewer for English-language WWF broadcasts, then as host of their French-language TV shows. He came out of retirement in 1996 to face Owen Hart in a boxing match at the Forum and now occasionally wrestles in Jacques' Montr√©al-area promotion, Lutte International 2000. Jacques disappeared from the WWF for nearly a year, but was re-branded as The Mountie upon his return in 1991, and went on to singles success with Jimmy Hart as his manager. The Mountie was a corrupt member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) who would often boast that he \\"always gets his man\\" in the ring. Rougeau's greatest singles success as The Mountie was when he won the WWF Intercontinental from Bret Hart in January 1992. He would only hold the title for two days however, losing it to Rowdy Roddy Piper at the Royal Rumble. The Mountie gimmick caused some controversy in Canada with the real RCMP, with litigation forcing Rougeau to use his real life name when wrestling in his home country, though he did continue to wrestle in his Mountie inspired boots, black pants and red shirt. Despite being a heel in the WWF, Rougeau, like a lot of other Canadian wrestlers, was cheered in Canada, especially in his home province of Quebec. At one time during his singles run, Rougeau wrestled a match with WWF Champion Hulk Hogan where the babyface Hogan (who was the WWF's most popular star at the time) was actually booed by the crowd and Rougeau was the fan favorite, despite he and Jimmy Hart doing what they could to get heat from the crowd in attendance. He then began teaming up with Carl Ouellet to win the World Tag Team Championship three times as The Quebecers. He briefly retired, reunited with Ouellet as The Amazing French Canadians in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and appeared sporadically in the WWF and WCW before retiring from full-time competition. He occasionally wrestles for his own promotion. On March 30, 1998 they reunited with Pierre as they defeated a young Edge, Shawn Stasiak and Tom Brandi in a 6-tag in a dark match for WWF Shotgun Saturday Night. ==Championships and accomplishments== *Lutte Internationale **Canadian International Tag Team Championship (3 times) *World Wrestling Federation **WWF Tag Team Championship (1 time)1 1 The Rougeau's WWF Tag Team Championship reign is not officially recognized by WWE. ==See also== *The Quebecers *Rougeau wrestling family ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:WWE teams and stables Category:Independent promotions teams and stables ","title":"The Fabulous Rougeaus"},{"id":"2203389","text":"Castro Valley is a BART station located in the center median of Interstate 580 in Castro Valley, California.

The traditional term genetic relationship is increasingly replaced by genealogical relationship in recent literature to avoid confusion with the unrelated use of the term in biological genetics. Two languages are considered to be genetically related if one is descended from the other or if both are descended from a common ancestor. For example, the Romance languages are all descended from Vulgar Latin and so languages like Spanish, Italian and French are said to be genetically related to one another as well as to Latin. Similarly, Danish, Swedish and Norwegian are genetically related as members of the North Germanic language family because of their shared descent from Old Norse.Lewis, M. Paul, Gary F. Simons, and Charles D. Fennig (eds.). Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Seventeenth edition. Dallas, Texas: SIL International, 2013. The Romance languages and the North Germanic languages are both subfamilies of the Indo-European language family since both Latin and Old Norse are believed to be descended from an even more ancient language, Proto-Indo-European, and are therefore genetically related to each other as well. One controversial theory concerning the genetic relationships among languages is monogenesis, the idea that all known languages, with the exceptions of creoles, pidgins and sign languages, are descendant from a single ancestral language.Nichols, Johanna. Monogenesis or Polygenesis: A Single Ancestral Language for All Humanity? Ch. 58 of The Oxford Handbook of Language Evolution, ed. by Maggie Tallerman and Kathleen Rita Gibson. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2012. 558-72. Print. If that is true, it would mean all languages (other than pidgins, creoles, and sign languages) are genetically related, but in many cases, the relationships may be too remote to be detectable. == Establishing genetic relationships == In some cases, such as the Romance and North Germanic examples described above, the shared derivation of a group of related languages from a common ancestor is attested in the historical record. In other cases, genetic relationships between languages are established through use of the comparative method of linguistic analysis. In order to test the hypothesis that two languages are related, the comparative method begins with the collection of pairs of words that are hypothesized to be cognates: i.e., words in related languages that are derived from the same word in the shared ancestral language. Pairs of words that have similar pronunciations and meanings in the two languages are often good candidates for hypothetical cognates. The researcher must rule out the possibility that the two words are similar merely due to chance, or due to one having borrowed the words from the other (or from a language related to the other). Chance resemblance is ruled out by the existence of large collections of pairs of words between the two languages showing similar patterns of phonetic similarity. Once coincidental similarity and borrowing have been eliminated as possible explanations for similarities in sound and meaning of words, the last explanation is common origin: it is inferred that the similarities occurred due to descent from a common ancestor, and the words are actually cognates, implying the languages must be related. === Linguistic interference and borrowing === When languages are in contact with one another, either of them may influence the other through linguistic interference such as borrowing. For example, French has influenced English, Arabic has influenced Persian, Sanskrit has influenced Tamil and Chinese has influenced Japanese in this way. However, such influence does not constitute (and is not a measure of) a genetic relationship between the languages concerned. Linguistic interference can occur between languages that are genetically closely related, between languages that are distantly related (like English and French, which are distantly related Indo-European languages) and between languages that have no genetic relationship. ==Visual representation== A common visual representation of a language family is given by a genetic language tree. The tree model is sometimes termed a dendrogram or phylogeny. The family tree shows the relationship of the languages within in a family, much as a family tree of an individual shows their relationship with their relatives. There are criticisms to the family tree model. Critics focus mainly on the claim that the internal structure of the trees is subject to variation based on the criteria of classification.Edzard, Lutz. Polygenesis, Convergence, and Entropy: An Alternative Model of Linguistic Evolution Applied to Semitic Linguistics. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1998. Print. Even among those who support the family tree model, there are debates over which languages should be included in a language family. For example, within the dubious Altaic language family, there are debates over whether the Japonic and Koreanic languages should be included or not.Georg, Stefan, Peter A. Michalove, Alexis Manaster Ramer, and Paul J. Sidwell. Telling General Linguists about Altaic. Journal of Linguistics 35.1 (1999): 65-98. Print. The wave model has been proposed as an alternative to the tree model.Francois, Alexandre. Trees, Waves and Linkages: Models of Language Diversification. In The Routledge Handbook of Historical Linguistics, ed. by Claire Bowern and Bethwyn Evans. New York: Routledge, 2014, pp.161-189. (). The wave model uses isoglosses to group language varieties; unlike in the tree model, these groups can overlap. While the tree model implies a lack of contact between languages after derivation from an ancestral form, the wave model emphasizes the relationship between languages that remain in contact, which is more realistic. ==Complications== Some problems encountered by the genetic relationship group of languages include language isolates and mixed, pidgin and creole languages. Mixed languages, pidgins and creole languages constitute special genetic types of languages. They do not descend linearly or directly from a single language and have no single ancestor. Language isolates are languages that are unrelated to other languages. Each language isolate is considered to be a single language family with one language according to the Ethnologue. Including language isolates when counting language families considerably increases the number of language families. ==See also== *Language family *Comparative linguistics *Language isolate *Sprachbund ==References== Category:Historical linguistics ","title":"Genetic relationship (linguistics)"},{"id":"2203411","text":"The Mescalero Ridge forms the western edge of the great Llano Estacado, a vast plateau or tableland in the southwestern United States in New Mexico and Texas.Price, A.P. 1977.

The team consisted of well-known WWF wrestlers working under masks which strongly resembled that worn by Super Strong Machine in New Japan Pro Wrestling at the time; leader Andr√© the Giant had faced Hirata and two other Strong Machines during tours of NJPW in 1984, getting the idea for the masks. The gimmick was very much tongue-in-cheek, as the identities of the masked men were obvious to the fans but frustrating to heels when they were unable to prove them. The Machines was the last tag team Capt. Lou Albano managed in the WWF until he returned in 1994 to manage The Headshrinkers. ==Story== After feuding intensely with Andr√© for more than a year, Bobby Heenan's Heenan Family challenged Andr√© and a partner of his choice to face King Kong Bundy and Big John Studd in a tag team match on April 26, 1986. When Andr√© did not show and was replaced by Ted Arcidi, Bobby Heenan launched a campaign to get him suspended from the WWF. After deliberating on the matter, WWF President Jack Tunney was forced to suspend him for missing the tag team match and subsequent matches against the Heenan Family. This was part of a wrestling storyline, to allow Andr√© time off for production of the film The Princess Bride which was being filmed in the UK and also to allow him to fulfill a contracted tour of Japan. He was also beginning to develop health problems from the gigantism that caused his size that led him to having major back surgery and limited his wrestling ability at that time. Less than two months after the suspension was announced, vignettes appeared on WWF Television hailing the debut of a masked tag team from the Orient, known as \\"The Machines\\": Giant Machine and Super Machine. The team announced that they were coming to America soon with their manager Lou Albano and that their only mission was to prove that they were the number one tag team in the world. Super Machine was portrayed by Bill Eadie. His ring name was a play on his previous gimmick \\"Masked Superstar\\". Though it was clear that Giant Machine was none other than Andr√© the Giant, commentators sold that Giant Machine might be Giant Baba, and not Andr√©, under the mask. In the following weeks, Bobby Heenan made repeated claims that Giant Machine was Andr√© the Giant attempting to circumvent his suspension. To illustrate the obviousness of the ruse, Heenan went so far as to introduce his \\"new team from Korea\\" on an episode of Jesse Ventura‚Äôs Body Shop. The team was merely King Kong Bundy and Big John Studd wearing paper bags over their heads. Heenan's claims led to Jack Tunney decreeing that if the Giant Machine was revealed to be Andr√©, Andr√©'s suspension would become permanent. On August 5 (shown August 23), The Machines made their WWF debut with Super Machine wrestling in a singles match while Albano and Giant Machine were at ringside. Later that night, Bobby Heenan sneaked around at ringside taking pictures of the Giant Machine to try to prove his true identity. One week later, Albano introduced a third Machine to the WWF: Big Machine, who was played by Blackjack Mulligan. Andr√© had been suffering from (legitimate) severe back injuries, and the introduction of the Big Machine character was meant to reduce Andr√©'s wrestling role. \\"The Machines\\" angle was designed to put him in a lighter tag-team role. Due to the severity of the back injury, Mulligan was brought in to reduce Andr√©'s wrestling role even further, thereby keeping the popular superstar on TV. In televised interviews with Studd and Bundy, Studd would question the two smaller Machines being Japanese as one had a West Texas accent (Big Machine/Mulligan) and the other had a \\"New York accent\\" (Super Machine/Eadie). On the WWF show Tuesday Night Titans, Heenan claimed he knew of no Japanese wrestler who was 7'4\\" tall, weighed over 500 lbs and spoke with a French accent. Big Machine and Super Machine wrestled the majority of the matches against Bobby Heenan's cronies, occasionally with Lou Albano joining them to face Bundy, Studd and Heenan in six man tag-team action. Soon, other masked wrestlers (whose identities were generally obvious) appeared and temporarily teamed with The Machines. On September 10, Big and Super Machine were joined by Animal Machine to defeat King Kong Bundy, Big John Studd and Bobby Heenan. On September 16, The Machines were joined by Hulk Machine as the trio defeated the Heenan Family. The Hulk Machine returned on September 22 and helped the Machines win in the main event at the Madison Square Garden. A few weeks later the Machines received help from the kilt-wearing Piper Machine. On a house show in St. Paul, Minnesota the Machines even got the help of Crusher Machine, pinning John Studd to gain the victory for his team. On October 28, The Machines wrestled their last match under that gimmick, a loss to Bundy and Studd. This also marked the last appearance as a manager in the WWF for Lou Albano for several years. After the Machines last match was shown on November 23, the angle was ended and Andr√© was announced as being reinstated on November 29. In the following weeks the mystery of why Andr√© the Giant was reinstated built up until it was revealed that Bobby Heenan had arranged for the suspension to end so he could turn on Hulk Hogan in the buildup to WrestleMania III. After the angle ended Eadie (Super Machine) was repackaged as Ax, one half of Demolition while Big Machine worked for the WWF as Blackjack Mulligan (Windham's best-known wrestling identity) in late 1986 and the first half of 1987 before leaving the promotion. ==References== ==External links== *Online World of Wrestling profile: The Machines Category:Professional wrestling gimmicks Category:Masked tag teams Category:WWE teams and stables ","title":"The Machines (professional wrestling)"},{"id":"2203421","text":"Bases Loaded 3 screenshot Bases Loaded 3, known in Japan as , is a baseball video game released in 1991 by Jaleco for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

After an exhibition game is completed, the player is given a numerical score based thirteen categories, including batting, errors, and spectacular plays. The score ranges from 1 to 100, but a player can score over 100 points by earning bonus points for jumping and diving catches. While Jaleco did hire famed baseball player Ryne Sandberg for an endorsement, this installment of the game did not feature real teams or players. More unpopular with players, however, was the somewhat bizarre premise that \\"playing a perfect game\\", not winning a pennant, was the game's ultimate goal. Regardless, there would be one more NES Bases Loaded title, as well as several Super NES titles. The game is the third in the NES Bases Loaded series, following Bases Loaded II. ==Credits== Both the US and Japanese versions of the game contain staff credits.

He is renowned for inventing military effective napalm whilst he worked at Harvard in 1942. Nature volume 496, page 29 (04 April 2013) - \\"In 1942, in a secret lab at Harvard University in Massachusetts, chemist Louis Fieser and his team created napalm ‚Äî an incendiary gel that sticks to skin and can burn down to the bone.\\" His award-winning research included work on blood-clotting agents including the first synthesis of vitamin K, synthesis and screening of quinones as antimalarial drugs, work with steroids leading to the synthesis of cortisone, and study of the nature of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. ==Overview== Fieser was born in Columbus, Ohio, obtained his BA in chemistry in 1920 from Williams College, and his PhD under James Bryant Conant at Harvard in 1924. His graduate research concerned the measurement of oxidation potentials in quinone oxidation. Note: nice anecdote in supplementary info in 1924-1925 Fieser worked at the University of Oxford with W.H. Perkin Jr. and with Julius von Braun at the Frankfurt University as a postdoc. Between 1925 and 1930 he worked at Bryn Mawr College where he met his future wife. He then moved to Harvard University. With his research assistant and wife Mary Peters Fieser (MA, 1936, Radcliffe) he coauthored eight books and the first seven volumes of the classic series Reagents for Organic Synthesis known popularly among chemists as \\"Fieser and Fieser\\". He was also an editor and contributor for Organic Syntheses. Fieser had two chemical reagents named for him. Fieser's reagent is a mixture of chromium trioxide in acetic acid. Fieser's solution is an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide, sodium hydrosulfite, and sodium anthraquinone Œ≤-sulfonate used for the removal of oxygen from a gas stream. Woodward's rules for calculating UV absorption maxima are also known as the Woodward-Fieser rules. He was the first to propose the existence of iceane. In 1939 Fieser was involved in a competitive race for the structure elucidation of Vitamin K and he was able to report its synthesis in the end of that year. According to a recent in memoriam Fieser was a contender for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1941 and 1942 (when no prizes were actually awarded). However the 1943 award was shared between Henrik Dam for the discovery of vitamin K and Edward A. Doisy for the discovery of its chemical nature. During World War II Fieser was partly responsible for a military experiment that went disastrously awry. Project X-ray was a scheme to drop a great number of bats with small incendiary charges with a timed fuse attached over Japan to start widespread fires. After the bats nested in housing and factories, the timed fuses would ignite the incendiary charges (napalm) and start the fires. During a test run, a number of the bats escaped and ignited Carlsbad Airfield's hangars, barracks, and a general's car. \\"The accidental incineration of Carlsbad Auxiliary Army Airfield by incendiary bats was both a high and a low for Project X-Ray.\\" Fieser omitted the account of the fires from his own account of the bat tests. Dow Chemical began producing his formula for Napalm during World War II. The use of Napalm during the Vietnam War stirred controversy. Fieser, however, was unapologetic for its creation. He stated, \\"I have no right to judge the morality of Napalm just because I invented it.\\"Time magazine, January 5, 1968 In 1962 he served on the U.S. Surgeon General's Advisory Committee that in 1964 issued a report on the relationship between smoking and health. Fieser was a chain smoker, and only after he was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1965 and recovered did he quit the habit and start to actively promote the committee's conclusions. Fieser was the graduate advisor of 1987 Nobel laureate Donald J. Cram. == Notes == ==References== *Gates, M., Biographical Memoirs of the National Academy of Science 1994, vol. 65, p. 161-175 *\\"Steroids\\", Scientific American, January 1955, Vol.192, No.1, pp. 52‚Äì60 * * ==External links== * Time magazine January 5, 1968 (Internet archive) *Brief bio and photo at Michigan State University, accessed February 9, 2006 *Contributions of Organic Chemists to Biochemistry Journal of Biological Chemistry online, accessed February 9, 2006 *http://50.56.66.97/content/ii-bats-away, accessed May 6, 2011.

Men wrote dozens of books (including his magnum opus, History of Religion: In Search of the Way, the Truth and the Life, the seventh volume of which, Son of Man, served as the introduction to Christianity for thousands of citizens in the Soviet Union); baptized hundreds if not thousands; founded an Orthodox open university; opened one of the first Sunday schools in Russia as well as a charity group at the Russian Children's Hospital.Alexander Men Charity Group at Russian Children Clinical Hospital His influence is still widely felt and his legacy continues to grow among Christians both in Russia and abroad. He was murdered early on a Sunday morning, on 9 September 1990, by an ax-wielding assailant outside his home in Semkhoz, Russia. ==Biography== Men was born in Moscow to a Jewish family on 22 January 1935. He was baptized at six months along with his mother in the banned Catacomb Church, a branch of the Russian Orthodox Church that refused to cooperate with the Soviet authorities.Alexander Men Foundation When Men was 6 years old, the NKVD arrested his father, Volf Gersh-Leybovich (Vladimir Grigoryevich) Men (born 1902). Volf spent more than a year under guard and then was assigned to labor in the Ural Mountains. His son Alexander studied at the Moscow Fur-and-Down Institute in 1955 and transferred to Irkutsk Agriculture Institute from which was expelled in 1958 due to his religious beliefs. In the same year one month after his expulsion, he was ordained a deacon. In, 1960 he became a priest upon graduating from the Leningrad Theological Seminary.St. Petersburg Theological Academy In 1965, he completed studies at Moscow Theological Academy. Alexander Men became a leader with considerable influence and a good reputation among Christians both locally and abroad, among Roman Catholics and Protestants, as well as Orthodox. He served in a series of parishes near Moscow. A unique combination of broad erudition, openness to secular culture, science, to other confessions, to non-Christian religions, and deep Christian roots from the Catacomb Church propelled him into the ranks of leading Christian preachers. Starting in the early 1970s, Men became a popular figure in Russia's religious community, especially among the intelligentsia. Men was harassed by the KGB for his active missionary and evangelistic efforts. In the late 1980s, he utilised the mass media to spread the message of Christ (he was offered to host a nationally televised program on religion); his days and nights were full of teaching and lecturing at packed lecture halls. Men was one of the founders of the Russian Bible Society in 1990; that same year he founded the Open Orthodox University and \\"The World of the Bible\\" journal. His strenuous efforts in educating the Russian populace in the basics and dynamics of the Orthodox faith has garnered him the label as a modern-day apostle to the Soviet people. However, some representatives of the Orthodox circles and those interested in Orthodoxy evaluated the views of Father Alexander as being not fully ‚Äúorthodox‚Äù, and advised against using his books as an introduction to Orthodoxy. ===Murder=== On Sunday morning, 9 September 1990, he was murdered while walking along the wooded path from his home in the Russian village of Semkhoz to the local train platform. He was on his way to catch the train to Novaya Derevnya to celebrate the Divine Liturgy. Men had served at the parish in Novaya Derevnya for 20 years. His assailant's or assailants' use of an axe indicated a possible revenge motive. The murder occurred around the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union, and despite orders from within the Soviet (and later the Russian) government that the case be further investigated, the murder remains unsolved. His funeral was held on the day in the Orthodox calendar which commemorates the beheading of John the Baptist. ==Legacy== Since his death, Men's works and ideas have been seen as controversial among the conservative faction of the Russian Orthodox Church, citing his strong tendencies towards ecumenism which his books advocate. Nonetheless, Men has a considerable number of supporters, some of whom argue for his canonization. His lectures are regularly broadcast over Russian radio. His books are published freely in Russia nowadays. During his lifetime, they had to be printed abroad; mainly in Brussels, Belgium by the publishing house Foyer Chr√©tien Oriental and circulated in secret. Several key Russian Orthodox parishes encourage following his example as one who faithfully followed Christ.Bishop Seraphim (Sigrist) on A.Men, Saint Michael's Chapel, A Russian Catholic Community of Byzantine Rite Two Russian Orthodox churches have been built on the site of his assassination and a growing number of believers in both Russia and abroad consider him a martyr.Reflections on Fr. Alexander Men, Dean John H. Erickson of St Vladimir's Seminary, at the Alexander Men Conference hosted by Nyack College Manhattan campus, August 2004 In conjunction with the 25th year Commemoration of Memory, the Moscow Patriarchate Izdatel'stvo publishing house has begun a project to publish Fr. Men's \\"Collected Works\\" in a series of 15 volumes. Men's son, Mikhail Men, is a Russian political figure who from 2005 to 2013 served as the Governor of Ivanovo Oblast and now as Minister of Construction Industry, Housing and Utilities Sector in Dmitry Medvedev's Cabinet. He is also a musician known outside Russia for the Michael Men Project. ==Works== Alexander Men's greatest work is his History of Religion, published in seven volumes under the title In Search of the Way, the Truth, and the Life (volumes 1‚Äì6, Brussels, 1970‚Äì1983; 2nd edition Moscow, 1991‚Äì1992) in which the author examines the history of non-Christian religions as a way for Christians in the struggle of Magiism and Monotheism. Also including as the seventh volume his most famous work, Son of Man (Brussels, 1969; 2nd edition Moscow, 1991). Because of the persecution in the Soviet Union at the time, the Brussels editions were published under a pseudonym. Father Alexander Men was one of the first pioneers of Christian ‚Äúsamizdat‚Äù (self-publishing) of the 1960s. An English translation of Son of Man by Mormon author Samuel Brown was completed in 1998, but is now out of print, as are several other works in English translation. In 2014, a new project was commenced by Revd Alastair Macnaughton (1954‚Äì2017), an Anglican priest and Russian scholar, to translate the entire History of Religion, into the English language for the first time. Volume 1 was published in 2018. Recent works of Alexander Men in English translation include: *\\"An Inner Step Toward God: Writings and teachings on Prayer\\", (2014) ; *\\"Russian Religious Philosophy: 1989‚Äì1990 Lectures\\" (2015) (in 25th Year Memory Commemoration). *\\"The Wellsprings of Religion.

In his obituary, The Washington Post described him as \\"a professional wrestler whose blue-collar bona fides made him beloved among working class fans for 40 years\\". He was most successful in the American Midwest, often teaming with Dick the Bruiser. ==Professional wrestling careerEarly life and career=== Lisowski was born on July 11, 1926 and raised in the Milwaukee suburb of South Milwaukee. Early on he was more interested in football, playing fullback for the South Milwaukee High School football team, but took up wrestling while stationed in Germany with the U.S. Army. Having developed a liking for the sport, he continued training with Ivan Racy and Buck Tassie at Milwaukee's Eagles Club when he returned, eventually wrestling Marcel Buchet in his first recorded match late in 1949. His early career included wrestling three to four nights per week at a Chicago armory, typically earning $5 a night. To support himself and to stay in shape, Lisowski worked various blue collar jobs by day, from meat packing to bricklaying. Fred Kohler was the first promoter to put him on TV, and by 1954 he had developed a barrel-chested physique that would stick with him for most of his career. Decades before Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Sandman, Lisowski perfected the gimmick of the beer drinking tough guy. To further his career he bleached his dark hair blonde and started to get over as a strongman heel, famous for his bolo punch as well as a devastating full nelson. This eventually led to him winning the Chicago-area NWA World Tag Team Championship with partner Art Nielson. ===Tag team wrestling=== Lisowski continued to have tag team success throughout the remainder of the 1950s, often paired with his wrestling \\"brother\\" Stan Lisowski. By 1959, he was being billed as \\"Crusher\\" Lisowski, which legend came from a promoter's off-hand comment that he \\"just crushes everybody.\\" Until early 1965, Crusher was a heel (hated bad guy) in the AWA. After meeting the team of Larry Hennig & Harley Race for the first time, the fans adopted Crusher and his wrestling \\"cousin\\" Dick the Bruiser as full-fledged heroes in AWA territory. His bluster was legendary, as he would threaten to maul opponents in the ring and afterward \\"have a party, take all the dollies down Wisconsin Avenue, drink beer and dance the polka.\\" Besides his impressive physique, The Crusher's gimmick was to absorb a tremendous amount of punishment and still be able to make a comeback for the win. Over the next 15 to 20 years Crusher and Bruiser were tag partners off and on, and a natural combination due to their common background and brawling wrestling style. If Dick the Bruiser and Crusher felt they hadn't bloodied their opponents enough during a match, they would trade punches with each other afterwards. They won the AWA World Tag Team Championship 5 times, the WWA Tag Team Titles (the WWA was Dick \\"Bruiser\\" Afflis's promotion) 6 times, and the NWA International Tag Titles among others. ===Success as a solo wrestler=== Introduced at the beginning of wrestling matches as \\"The Wrestler That Made Milwaukee Famous\\" (a play on the slogan for Schlitz, \\"The Beer That Made Milwaukee Famous\\"), Crusher was successful as a solo wrestler, winning the AWA World Heavyweight Championship three times, the first time unifying it with the Omaha version of the World Heavyweight Championship on July 9, 1963, in a match where he defeated Verne Gagne. He was skillful at cutting promos, as he would brag about his \\"100 megaton biceps\\" and offer to pummel \\"da bum\\" he was facing in the ring with ease, and he often delighted in calling opponents \\"turkeynecks.\\" His most quotable and famous phrase though was: \\"How 'bout 'dat?\\" When asked how he trained for a match, he'd claim he ran along the waterfront in Milwaukee carrying a large full beer barrel over either shoulder for strength (and longtime AWA announcer Rodger Kent often noted that by the end of the Crusher's training run, the beer was gone), and that he'd dance polka all night with Polish barmaids to increase his stamina. Although much of Crusher's popularity came from the idea that he was a big beer drinker, in actuality, he never drank beer, and according to Baron Von Raschke, he actually preferred wine.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8W5-dHlZpc The Crusher's wrestling career almost ended in 1981, when the 450-pound Jerry Blackwell botched a top rope move and landed on Lisowski's right arm, causing nerve damage from his shoulder all the way to his wrist. Doctors told him he'd never wrestle again, but Crusher did strength training for two years while he was unofficially \\"retired,\\" returning to the ring in 1983. ===Move to the World Wrestling Federation=== He also had a successful run in the WWF in the early 1960s where he was a nemesis of Johnny Valentine and a very young Bruno Sammartino, primarily in the Pittsburgh promotion. He drew very large crowds to Forbes Field with battles against each man. In the mid-1980s, seeing that the American Wrestling Association (AWA) promotion with which he had the most success over the years was crumbling, particularly when Hulk Hogan and many of the other top talent jumped ship to Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Crusher went to work for McMahon on a part-time basis, appearing at WWF house shows all over the Midwest. Lisowski claimed that he made more money working part-time for McMahon than he did working for the frugal Gagne on a full-time basis. In 1986, Lisowski occasionally teamed with The Machines as Crusher Machine. The Crusher's last match was at a WWF house show in Omaha on February 15, 1988. He replaced Billy Jack Haynes to team with Ken Patera and face Demolition, who were disqualified when Mr. Fuji tripped Crusher with a cane about three minutes in. The Crusher's last television appearance was at WWF's 1998 pay-per-view Over the Edge: In Your House where was shown sitting alongside Mad Dog Vachon in the front row. Jerry Lawler made fun of the two men's age, and tried to steal Vachon's artificial leg, but Vachon hit him over the head with it, and Crusher punched him. As Lawler bailed, the two former enemies shook hands. ===Legacy=== In 1964, the Minneapolis-based garage rock band The Novas wrote a song dedicated to him called \\"The Crusher\\", with lead singer Bob Nolan imitating the raunchy voice of Crusher Lisowski (and his trademark yell at the beginning of the record). The tune, which included the lyrics \\"Do the hammer lock, you turkeynecks!\\" was popular in the upper Midwest and made it to #88 on the national Billboard chart. It was later covered by The Cramps on their album Psychedelic Jungle. The song has received a resurgence of popularity in recent years, as David Letterman has often played it on his late-night talk show. The Ramones released a song entitled \\"The Crusher\\" paying tribute to Lisowski on their last studio recorded album, Adios Amigos. On June 8, 2019, a bronze statue of The Crusher was unveiled in South Milwaukee at 1101 Milwaukee Avenue. South Milwaukee Mayor Erik Brooks declared the day \\"Reggie 'Da Crusher' Lisowski Day\\" in his memory.https://www.jsonline.com/story/communities/south/news/south- milwaukee/2019/06/08/bronze-crusher-statue-revealed-crusherfest/1396437001/ A few weeks later on August 24, 2019, surveillance video captured two men striking the statue with a concrete block, damaging the nose, cheek and chest. Da Crusher‚Äôs family noticed the damage Aug. 29 and reported it to police. James Dudgeon, 18, of South Milwaukee was charged with criminal damage to property. Additionally, 21-year-old Douglas Macklin of Pembine, Wisconsin, was charged Sept. 19 in connection with the vandalism. According to a criminal complaint, Dudgeon identified Macklin as his accomplice. Police also found a photo of Macklin on his Facebook page wearing the same shirt he is seen wearing in the video. ==Personal life== In 1974, he and Dick the Bruiser starred in the movie The Wrestler, where they beat up a posse of mobsters on the big screen. In his later years, multiple surgeries on his hips and knee crippled him, as well as a non-cancerous tumor removed from his brain stem in March 2005, which left Lisowski partially paralyzed. Lisowski's wife Faye died in March 2003 after the couple were married for 55 years. Lisowski died of a brain tumor on October 22, 2005, at age 79. He, his wife, Faye, and infant son Gary are interred at the Holy Sepulcher Cemetery near Milwaukee. He was survived by four children, nine grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. Gagne reacted to his death by saying to the St. Paul Pioneer Press, \\"We had some dandy matches. The Crusher never was a great technically skilled wrestler, but he was tougher than nails and a brawler. He could bench press nearly 600 pounds. And he loved to have fun. After a match, he couldn't get a beer in his hands fast enough.\\" ==Championships and accomplishments== *Cauliflower Alley Club :*Other honoree (2000) *Fred Kohler Enterprises :*NWA World Tag Team Championship (Chicago version) (3 times) \\\\- with Art Neilson (1) and Stan Lisowski (2) *Georgia Championship Wrestling :*NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship (1 time) \\\\- with Tommy Rich *Japan Wrestling Association :*NWA International Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Dick the Bruiser *Maple Leaf Wrestling :*NWA Canadian Open Tag Team Championship (1 time) \\\\- with Stan Lisowski *NWA Minneapolis Wrestling and Boxing Club - American Wrestling Association :*AWA Brass Knuckles Championship (1 time) :*AWA World Heavyweight Championship (3 times) :*AWA World Tag Team Championship (9 times) - with Dick the Bruiser (5), Verne Gagne (1), Red Bastien (1), Billy Robinson (1) and Baron von Raschke (1) :*NWA World Tag Team Championship (Minneapolis version) (2 times) - with Stan Lisowski :*(Minneapolis) British Open Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Stan Lisowski :*World Heavyweight Championship (Omaha version) (1 time) :*Nebraska Heavyweight Championship (1 Time)http://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr;=1138&page;=11 *National Wrestling Alliance **NWA United States Television Championship (1 time)http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/ny/capitol/us-tv.html *Pro Wrestling Illustrated :*PWI Tag Team of the Year (1972) - with Dick the Bruiser :*PWI ranked him # 260 of the 500 best singles wrestlers of the PWI Years in 2003 *Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame :*(Class of 2005) - with Bruiser *World Championship Wrestling :*WCW Hall of Fame (Class of 1994) *World Wrestling Association :*WWA World Tag Team Championship (6 times) - with Dick the Bruiser *Wrestling Observer Newsletter :*Worst Tag Team (1984) with Baron Von Raschke :*Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame (Class of 1996) *Other :*Rocky Mountain Heavyweight Championship (1 time) ==References== ==External links== * Cauliflower Alley Club - list of honorees * Pro Wrestling HOF: The Crusher & The Bruiser * SLAM!

A lieutenant in the Imperial Russian military, he was commissioned to lead an expedition to Japan in 1791, returning two Japanese castaways to their home country in exchange for trade concessions from the Tokugawa shogunate. He was the son of Erik Laxmann. ==Expedition to Japan (1792)== Daikokuya K≈çday≈´ (Â§ßÈªíÂ±ãÂÖâÂ§™Â§´) and Isokichi (Á£ØÂêâ): two Japanese castaways returned by Adam Laxman in 1792. Laxman landed on Hokkaid≈ç on 9 October 1792, where he was met by members of the Matsumae clan, who were entrusted with defending Japan's northern borders. Unlike previous foreign visitors, Laxman was treated hospitably, but this changed when he demanded, imprudently, that he be able to deliver the castaways (Daikokuya K≈çday≈´'s party) to Edo (modern-day Tokyo) in person. He was soon met by two envoys and five hundred men, sent from Edo by senior councilor Matsudaira Sadanobu, who attempted to delay or prevent Laxman's traveling much deeper into Japanese territory. They asked that he travel to the town of Matsumae, overland and without his ship. Laxman refused, and ultimately was allowed to sail, with Japanese naval escort, to the port of Hakodate; from there, 450 Russians and Japanese would march to Matsumae Castle. Oddly, despite his impudence, Laxman was granted lavish Western-style living quarters; they were allowed to ignore the custom of kneeling and bowing before the Shogun's envoys, and were presented with three samurai swords and a hundred bags of rice. The envoys then explained to him that Japanese law demanded that all foreign trade be performed at Nagasaki. Since he had come to return castaways, they explained, he would be allowed to leave peacefully. When Laxman refused to leave without a trade agreement, he was provided with papers that explicitly stated that Nagasaki would welcome one Russian ship, that foreign ships were not allowed to dock anywhere else in the country, and that Christianity would also not be tolerated anywhere in Japan.A.

Laxman returned to Russia essentially empty-handed, though he held (quite possibly) the first official Japanese documents granting permission to trade, to a nation other than China or the Netherlands.George Alexander Lensen, ‚ÄúEarly Russo-Japanese Relations‚Äù, The Far Eastern Quarterly, vol. 10, no. 1, November 1950, pp. 2‚Äì37, n.b. pp. 17‚Äì22. In 1804‚Äì1805, nine years after Laxman's return to Russia, an attempt was made to trade at Nagasaki as part of the expedition around the world led by Adam Johann von Krusenstern, but the Russian ambassador Nikolai Rezanov was greeted with a lengthy dispatch from the Shogunate explaining that Japan was closed to foreign trade and demanding that they leave. After this major setback, the Tsarist government debated for many years the actual intention and meaning of the documents, and, leaving the opening of Japan to private entrepreneur explorers, ultimately failed to open Japan. ==Gallery== Ekaterina Adam Laxman (Nemuro City Museum of History and Nature).jpgEkaterina, the ship upon which Adam Laxman sailed to Japan (Nemuro City Museum of History and Nature) Vasilii Fedorovich Lovtsov (Hakodate City Central Library).jpgVasilii Fedorovich Lovtsov, captain of Ekaterina (Hakodate City Central Library) Alexei Vasilievich Lovtsov and Vasilii Ivanovich Kokh (Hakodate City Central Library).jpgAlexei, adopted son of Captain Lovtsov, and Vasilii Ivanovich Kokh, son of the Commandant of Okhotsk (Hakodate City Central Library) Ivan Filippovich Trapeznikov & Egor Ivanovich Tugolukov (Hakodate City Central Library).jpgSergeant-surveyor Trapeznikov and the interpreter Tugolukov (Hakodate City Central Library) ==See also== *Sakoku *Empire of Japan‚ÄìRussian Empire relations *Dembei, Gonza, Sanemon *List of Westerners who visited Japan before 1868 ==Notes== ==References== *McDougall, Walter.

The Collegio Clementino is a palace in Rome, central Italy, sited between the Strada del'Orso and the banks of the Tiber. It was founded by Pope Clement VIII in 1595, to host Slavonian refugees. Giacomo della Porta was commissioned to erect a suitable building to house them, which would be one of the aged architect's last projects. On February 25, 1601, Urban VIII shifted the Slavs to Loreto and refounded the Collegio Clementino as an elite school for young noblemen of every nation and the richest families in Rome. The musical tradition of the Collegio Clementino remained strong: Alessandro Scarlatti wrote oratorios for Carnival seasons and came up from Naples to oversee their production . Instruction \\"in all the sciences and the gentlemanly arts\\" according to a description of 1761, was entrusted to brothers of the Somaschi, a religious order of teaching brothers established during the Counter-Reformation, which had been authorized by Pope Pius V in 1568; they proved themselves expert in establishing seminaries. In the 17th and 18th century the Collegio Clementino produced Pope Benedict XIV, and numerous cardinals, including Domenico Silvio Passionei, Francesco Guidobono Cavalchini, Bartolomeo Pacca, Fabrizio Sceberras Testaferrata, the mathematician Giulio Carlo de' Toschi di Fagnano, and the Pacific explorer Alessandro Malaspina. Here Carlo Spinola and Domenico Quarteironi taught the young polymath and inventor, Raimondo di Sangro, prince of Sansevero. The College was disbanded in 1873.Kendrick, p. 9. ==Notes and references== ==Bibliography== * * ==External links== *Collegio Clementino: described in a 1761 engraving by Giuseppe Vasi *La Storia dei Somaschi: (in Italian) Category:Higher education in Italy Category:Universities and colleges in Rome Category:1595 establishments in the Papal States Category:Palaces in Rome Category:Renaissance architecture in Rome Category:Rome R.

The Theodor Bilharz Research Institute is located in Giza, Egypt. Theodor Bilharz was a German scientist who discovered, in autopsy material at Kasr El Aini Hospital, the causative agent of haematuria: Schistosoma worm, during his work in Egypt in 1851. The bilhariziasis disease was named after him. Bilahrz tomb in old Cairo German Cemetery. The idea of initiating the institute was elaborated in 1960 via high council of science, owing to the magnitude of schistosomiasis problem in Egypt specially in the rural population and its impact on the socioeconomic life. The objective of the institute was to tackle this diseases from all its aspects : control, diagnosis and management. In 1960, Ahmed Hafez Mousa, the real originator of the institute and one of the world's pioneers in the field of Tropical Medicine was charged to fulfill this idea. He appointed the Tropical Medicine Department at Kasr El Aini, Faculty of Medicine a preliminary location for a small nuclear start of this project. This was followed by the establishment of a \\"Laboratory for Schisosomiasis Research\\" in the chemistry building of the National Research Center. In April 1962, the foundation stone of the institute was implemented at Warak El Hader's village in Giza governorate. Meanwhile, the building of the institute was constructed by Egyptian Government, the laboratories and hospital were equipped through an agreement between the governments of Federal Republic of Germany and Egypt in 1964. The TBRI was built on 25,000 m2 formed of four main buildings in front of the west bank of the Great River Nile in Giza governorate. In 1977 The institute construction was accomplished, and opened for public, headed by Ali Zain El-Abdeen. in 1979. Ahmad Algarim became the head of the institute, and until 1987. In 1987, Aly Zain Al- Abdeen headed the institute and till his retirement in 1994.About Theodor Bilharz Institute http://www.tbri.sci.eg/ In 1977, the institute was officially affiliated to the Ministry of Scientific Research By June 1978 the TBRI's laboratories and out-patients clinic were inaugurated. The attached hospital was completed in December 1981, and the official opening was in 1983 according to Presidential Decree No. 58. The institute which started with 12 research departments and 120 bed hospital became this respectable institution encompassing 20 research departments covering a wide spectrum of academic and clinical specialties divided into six divisions (Clinical Medical Division, clinical Surgical Division, Clinical Laboratory Research Division, Immunology &Therapeutic; Evaluation Division, Biochemistry &Medicinal; Chemistry Division, Medical Malacology & Environmental Research Division). The 20 departments are: Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Nephrology, Public Health, Radiology., Anaesthesia, Intensive care, Surgery, Urology, Clinical Chemistry, Electron Microscopy, Hematology, Microbiology, Pathology, Immunology, Parasitology, Pharmacology, Biochemistry, Medicinal Chemistry, Environmental Research and Medical Malacology departments. A hospital including free of charge sector (300 beds), economic sector (29 beds) and several specialized units are included: hepatic coma resuscitation, renal dialysis, angiography, urodynamics, laparoscopy, infection control, quality control, medical records and statistics unit, Monoclonal antibody Production Unit, Biotechnology Engineering Production Unit, Snail Research Station (located 25 km from Cairo) and a Field Research Unit (in Gezirat Mohamed village) for conducting field work, in the scope to tackle the disease of schistosomiasis and the emerged health problems of viral hepatitis in an integrated approach and to provide outstanding medical services to the community and African countries. == Mission and Research Strategy == The mission of TBRI is targeted towards the control, the diagnosis and management of endemic diseases and their complications especially those affecting the liver, the gastrointestinal and the urinary tracts, mainly as result of schistosomiasis and viral hepatitis, this is to meet the social, economic and technological needs of Egypt and the regional area. The Institute adopts an integrated strategy based on six research programs that can cope with and fulfill this objective: * Control of endemic diseases: This program aims at modifying the existing means of control measures and introducing more recent methods to achieve a more effective yet less expensive control scheme without any harmful environmental impact, through the employment of molecular biology in vaccine production and biological control of the parasites and their intermediate hosts. Moreover, studying the role of the community and intensifying its active participation are prerequisites. *Diagnosis of endemic diseases: This program is directed to the study, assessment and modification of all diagnostic measures utilizing the most advanced technologies. The diagnosis varies from clinical and laboratory techniques to field studies (prevalence, ecological and socioeconomic implications). * Morbidity changes of endemic diseases: This program aims at studying the pathogenesis and the pathological changes caused by endemic diseases on different body systems. *Management of endemic diseases: This program evaluates both the current and advanced therapeutic measures and assess their efficacy and side effects. It includes the different medical and surgical management procedures of diseases and their complications. Studies on partial hepatectomy, liver regeneration and transplantation are items of this program. * Innovation in Applied Medical Sciences Any innovations or patency in relevant research fields at TBRI are encouraged and supported. *Quality Management Development of new strategies for performance appraisal of hospital, out-patient clinics and laboratories. Development of quality-based documentation, database and communication systems or technical and administrative tools at TBRI.

They describe an object that acts as a proxy for a result that is initially unknown, usually because the computation of its value is not yet complete. The term promise was proposed in 1976 by Daniel P. Friedman and David Wise, and Peter Hibbard called it eventual. A somewhat similar concept future was introduced in 1977 in a paper by Henry Baker and Carl Hewitt. The terms future, promise, delay, and deferred are often used interchangeably, although some differences in usage between future and promise are treated below. Specifically, when usage is distinguished, a future is a read-only placeholder view of a variable, while a promise is a writable, single assignment container which sets the value of the future. Notably, a future may be defined without specifying which specific promise will set its value, and different possible promises may set the value of a given future, though this can be done only once for a given future. In other cases a future and a promise are created together and associated with each other: the future is the value, the promise is the function that sets the value ‚Äì essentially the return value (future) of an asynchronous function (promise). Setting the value of a future is also called resolving, fulfilling, or binding it. ==Applications== Futures and promises originated in functional programming and related paradigms (such as logic programming) to decouple a value (a future) from how it was computed (a promise), allowing the computation to be done more flexibly, notably by parallelizing it. Later, it found use in distributed computing, in reducing the latency from communication round trips. Later still, it gained more use by allowing writing asynchronous programs in direct style, rather than in continuation-passing style. ==Implicit vs. explicit== Use of futures may be implicit (any use of the future automatically obtains its value, as if it were an ordinary reference) or explicit (the user must call a function to obtain the value, such as the \`get\` method of in Java). Obtaining the value of an explicit future can be called stinging or forcing. Explicit futures can be implemented as a library, whereas implicit futures are usually implemented as part of the language. The original Baker and Hewitt paper described implicit futures, which are naturally supported in the actor model of computation and pure object-oriented programming languages like Smalltalk. The Friedman and Wise paper described only explicit futures, probably reflecting the difficulty of efficiently implementing implicit futures on stock hardware. The difficulty is that stock hardware does not deal with futures for primitive data types like integers. For example, an add instruction does not know how to deal with \`3 + future factorial(100000)\`. In pure actor or object languages this problem can be solved by sending \`future factorial(100000)\` the message \`+[3]\`, which asks the future to add \`3\` to itself and return the result. Note that the message passing approach works regardless of when \`factorial(100000)\` finishes computation and that no stinging/forcing is needed. ==Promise pipelining== The use of futures can dramatically reduce latency in distributed systems. For instance, futures enable promise pipelining,Promise Pipelining at erights.orgPromise Pipelining on the C2 wiki as implemented in the languages E and Joule, which was also called call-stream Also published in ACM SIGPLAN Notices 23(7). in the language Argus. Consider an expression involving conventional remote procedure calls, such as: t3 := ( x.a() ).c( y.b() ) which could be expanded to t1 := x.a(); t2 := y.b(); t3 := t1.c(t2); Each statement needs a message to be sent and a reply received before the next statement can proceed. Suppose, for example, that \`x\`, \`y\`, \`t1\`, and \`t2\` are all located on the same remote machine. In this case, two complete network round-trips to that machine must take place before the third statement can begin to execute. The third statement will then cause yet another round-trip to the same remote machine. Using futures, the above expression could be written t3 := (x <- a()) <- c(y <- b()) which could be expanded to t1 := x <- a(); t2 := y <- b(); t3 := t1 <- c(t2); The syntax used here is that of the language E, where \`x <- a()\` means to send the message \`a()\` asynchronously to \`x\`. All three variables are immediately assigned futures for their results, and execution proceeds to subsequent statements. Later attempts to resolve the value of \`t3\` may cause a delay; however, pipelining can reduce the number of round-trips needed. If, as in the prior example, \`x\`, \`y\`, \`t1\`, and \`t2\` are all located on the same remote machine, a pipelined implementation can compute \`t3\` with one round-trip instead of three. Because all three messages are destined for objects which are on the same remote machine, only one request need be sent and only one response need be received containing the result. The send \`t1 <- c(t2)\` would not block even if \`t1\` and \`t2\` were on different machines to each other, or to \`x\` or \`y\`. Promise pipelining should be distinguished from parallel asynchronous message passing. In a system supporting parallel message passing but not pipelining, the message sends \`x <- a()\` and \`y <- b()\` in the above example could proceed in parallel, but the send of \`t1 <- c(t2)\` would have to wait until both \`t1\` and \`t2\` had been received, even when \`x\`, \`y\`, \`t1\`, and \`t2\` are on the same remote machine. The relative latency advantage of pipelining becomes even greater in more complicated situations involving many messages. Promise pipelining also should not be confused with pipelined message processing in actor systems, where it is possible for an actor to specify and begin executing a behaviour for the next message before having completed processing of the current message. ==Read-only views== In some programming languages such as Oz, E, and AmbientTalk, it is possible to obtain a read-only view of a future, which allows reading its value when resolved, but does not permit resolving it: * In Oz, the \`!!\` operator is used to obtain a read-only view. * In E and AmbientTalk, a future is represented by a pair of values called a promise/resolver pair. The promise represents the read-only view, and the resolver is needed to set the future's value. * In C++11 a \`std::future\` provides a read-only view. The value is set directly by using a \`std::promise\`, or set to the result of a function call using \`std::packaged_task\` or \`std::async\`. * In the Dojo Toolkit's Deferred API as of version 1.5, a consumer-only promise object represents a read-only view. * In Alice ML, futures provide a read-only view, whereas a promise contains both a future and the ability to resolve the future * In .NET 4.0 \`System.Threading.Tasks.Task\` represents a read-only view. Resolving the value can be done via \`System.Threading.Tasks.TaskCompletionSource\`. Support for read-only views is consistent with the principle of least privilege, since it enables the ability to set the value to be restricted to subjects that need to set it. In a system that also supports pipelining, the sender of an asynchronous message (with result) receives the read-only promise for the result, and the target of the message receives the resolver. ==Thread-specific futures== Some languages, such as Alice ML, define futures that are associated with a specific thread that computes the future's value. This computation can start either eagerly when the future is created, or lazily when its value is first needed. A lazy future is similar to a thunk, in the sense of a delayed computation. Alice ML also supports futures that can be resolved by any thread, and calls these promises. This use of promise is different from its use in E as described above. In Alice, a promise is not a read-only view, and promise pipelining is unsupported. Instead, pipelining naturally happens for futures, including ones associated with promises. ==Blocking vs non-blocking semantics== If the value of a future is accessed asynchronously, for example by sending a message to it, or by explicitly waiting for it using a construct such as \`when\` in E, then there is no difficulty in delaying until the future is resolved before the message can be received or the wait completes. This is the only case to be considered in purely asynchronous systems such as pure actor languages. However, in some systems it may also be possible to attempt to immediately or synchronously access a future's value. Then there is a design choice to be made: * the access could block the current thread or process until the future is resolved (possibly with a timeout). This is the semantics of dataflow variables in the language Oz. * the attempted synchronous access could always signal an error, for example throwing an exception. This is the semantics of remote promises in E. * potentially, the access could succeed if the future is already resolved, but signal an error if it is not. This would have the disadvantage of introducing nondeterminism and the potential for race conditions, and seems to be an uncommon design choice. As an example of the first possibility, in C++11, a thread that needs the value of a future can block until it is available by calling the \`wait()\` or \`get()\` member functions. You can also specify a timeout on the wait using the \`wait_for()\` or \`wait_until()\` member functions to avoid indefinite blocking. If the future arose from a call to \`std::async\` then a blocking wait (without a timeout) may cause synchronous invocation of the function to compute the result on the waiting thread. ==Related constructs== Future is a particular case of Event (synchronization primitive), which can be completed only once. In general, events can be reset to initial empty state and, thus, completed as many times as you like.500 lines or less, \\"A Web Crawler With asyncio Coroutines\\" by A. Jesse Jiryu Davis and Guido van Rossum says \\"implementation uses an asyncio.Event in place of the Future shown here. The difference is an Event can be reset, whereas a Future cannot transition from resolved back to pending.\\" An I-var (as in the language Id) is a future with blocking semantics as defined above. An I-structure is a data structure containing I-vars. A related synchronization construct that can be set multiple times with different values is called an M-var. M-vars support atomic operations to take or put the current value, where taking the value also sets the M-var back to its initial empty state. A concurrent logic variable is similar to a future, but is updated by unification, in the same way as logic variables in logic programming. Thus it can be bound more than once to unifiable values, but cannot be set back to an empty or unresolved state. The dataflow variables of Oz act as concurrent logic variables, and also have blocking semantics as mentioned above. A concurrent constraint variable is a generalization of concurrent logic variables to support constraint logic programming: the constraint may be narrowed multiple times, indicating smaller sets of possible values. Typically there is a way to specify a thunk that should run whenever the constraint is narrowed further; this is needed to support constraint propagation. ==Relations between the expressiveness of different forms of future== Eager thread-specific futures can be straightforwardly implemented in non-thread-specific futures, by creating a thread to calculate the value at the same time as creating the future. In this case it is desirable to return a read-only view to the client, so that only the newly created thread is able to resolve this future. To implement implicit lazy thread-specific futures (as provided by Alice ML, for example) in terms in non-thread-specific futures, needs a mechanism to determine when the future's value is first needed (for example, the \`WaitNeeded\` construct in Oz). If all values are objects, then the ability to implement transparent forwarding objects is sufficient, since the first message sent to the forwarder indicates that the future's value is needed. Non-thread-specific futures can be implemented in thread-specific futures, assuming that the system supports message passing, by having the resolving thread send a message to the future's own thread. However, this can be viewed as unneeded complexity. In programming languages based on threads, the most expressive approach seems to be to provide a mix of non-thread- specific futures, read-only views, and either a WaitNeeded construct, or support for transparent forwarding. ==Evaluation strategy== The evaluation strategy of futures, which may be termed call by future, is non-deterministic: the value of a future will be evaluated at some time between when the future is created and when its value is used, but the precise time is not determined beforehand and can change from run to run. The computation can start as soon as the future is created (eager evaluation) or only when the value is actually needed (lazy evaluation), and may be suspended part-way through, or executed in one run. Once the value of a future is assigned, it is not recomputed on future accesses; this is like the memoization used in call by need. A ' is a future that deterministically has lazy evaluation semantics: the computation of the future's value starts when the value is first needed, as in call by need. Lazy futures are of use in languages which evaluation strategy is by default not lazy. For example, in C++11 such lazy futures can be created by passing the \`std::launch::deferred\` launch policy to \`std::async\`, along with the function to compute the value. ==Semantics of futures in the actor model== In the actor model, an expression of the form \`future \` is defined by how it responds to an \`Eval\` message with environment E and customer C as follows: The future expression responds to the \`Eval\` message by sending the customer C a newly created actor F (the proxy for the response of evaluating \`\`) as a return value concurrently with sending \`\` an \`Eval\` message with environment E and customer C. The default behavior of F is as follows: * When F receives a request R, then it checks to see if it has already received a response (that can either be a return value or a thrown exception) from evaluating \`\` proceeding as follows: *# If it already has a response V, then *#*If V is a return value, then it is sent the request R. *#*If V is an exception, then it is thrown to the customer of the request R. *# If it does not already have a response, then R is stored in the queue of requests inside the F. * When F receives the response V from evaluating \`\`, then V is stored in F and **If V is a return value, then all of the queued requests are sent to V. **If V is an exception, then it is thrown to the customer of each of the queued requests. However, some futures can deal with requests in special ways to provide greater parallelism. For example, the expression \`1 + future factorial(n)\` can create a new future that will behave like the number \`1+factorial(n)\`. This trick does not always work. For example, the following conditional expression: : \`if m>future factorial(n) then print(\\"bigger\\") else print(\\"smaller\\")\` suspends until the future for \`factorial(n)\` has responded to the request asking if \`m\` is greater than itself. ==History== The future and/or promise constructs were first implemented in programming languages such as MultiLisp and Act 1. The use of logic variables for communication in concurrent logic programming languages was quite similar to futures. These began in Prolog with Freeze and IC Prolog, and became a true concurrency primitive with Relational Language, Concurrent Prolog, guarded Horn clauses (GHC), Parlog, Strand, Vulcan, Janus, Oz-Mozart, Flow Java, and Alice ML. The single-assignment I-var from dataflow programming languages, originating in Id and included in Reppy's Concurrent ML, is much like the concurrent logic variable. The promise pipelining technique (using futures to overcome latency) was invented by Barbara Liskov and Liuba Shrira in 1988, and independently by Mark S. Miller, Dean Tribble and Rob Jellinghaus in the context of Project Xanadu circa 1989. The term promise was coined by Liskov and Shrira, although they referred to the pipelining mechanism by the name call-stream, which is now rarely used. Both the design described in Liskov and Shrira's paper, and the implementation of promise pipelining in Xanadu, had the limit that promise values were not first-class: an argument to, or the value returned by a call or send could not directly be a promise (so the example of promise pipelining given earlier, which uses a promise for the result of one send as an argument to another, would not have been directly expressible in the call-stream design or in the Xanadu implementation). It seems that promises and call-streams were never implemented in any public release of Argus, the programming language used in the Liskov and Shrira paper. Argus development stopped around 1988. The Xanadu implementation of promise pipelining only became publicly available with the release of the source code for Udanax Gold in 1999, and was never explained in any published document. The later implementations in Joule and E support fully first-class promises and resolvers. Several early actor languages, including the Act series, supported both parallel message passing and pipelined message processing, but not promise pipelining. (Although it is technically possible to implement the last of these features in the first two, there is no evidence that the Act languages did so.) After 2000, a major revival of interest in futures and promises occurred, due to their use in responsiveness of user interfaces, and in web development, due to the request‚Äìresponse model of message-passing. Several mainstream languages now have language support for futures and promises, most notably popularized by \`FutureTask\` in Java 5 (announced 2004) and the \`async\` and \`await\` constructions in .NET 4.5 (announced 2010, released 2012) largely inspired by the asynchronous workflows of F#, which dates to 2007. This has subsequently been adopted by other languages, notably Dart (2014), Python (2015), Hack (HHVM), and drafts of ECMAScript 7 (JavaScript), Scala, and C++. ==List of implementations== Some programming languages are supporting futures, promises, concurrent logic variables, dataflow variables, or I-vars, either by direct language support or in the standard library. ===List of concepts related to futures and promises by programming language=== * ABCL/f * Alice ML * AmbientTalk (including first- class resolvers and read-only promises) * C++, starting with C++11: std::future and std::promise ** ŒºC++ ** Compositional C++ * Crystal (programming language) * Dart (with Future/Completer classes and the keywords await and async) * Elm (programming language) via the Task module * Glasgow Haskell (I-vars and M-vars only) * Id (I-vars and M-vars only) * Io * Java via or ** Flow Java * JavaScript (limited, as of ECMAScript 6) * Lucid (dataflow only) * Some Lisps ** Clojure ** MultiLisp * .NET via Tasks ** C#, since .NET Framework 4.5, via the keywords \`async\` and \`await\` * Nim * Oxygene * Oz version 3 * Python concurrent.futures, since 3.2,Python 3.2 Release as proposed by the PEP 3148, and Python 3.5 added async and awaitPython 3.5 Release * R (promises for lazy evaluation, still single threaded) * Racket * RakuPromise class in Perl 6 * Scala via scala.concurrent package * Scheme * Squeak Smalltalk * Strand * Swift (only via third-party libraries) * Visual Basic 11 (via the keywords Async and Await) Languages also supporting promise pipelining include: * E * Joule ===List of non-standard, library based implementations of futures=== * For Common Lisp: ** BlackbirdCommon Lisp Blackbird ** Eager Future2Common Lisp Eager Future2 ** lparallelLisp in parallel ‚Äì A parallel programming library for Common Lisp ** PCallCommon Lisp PCall * For C++: ** Boost library ** Dlib ** Qt ** Seastar ** Folly ** POCO C++ Libraries (Active Results) ** HPX * For C# and other .NET languages: The Parallel Extensions library * For Groovy: GParsGroovy GPars * For JavaScript: ** Cujo.js'Cujo.js when.jsJavaScript when.js provides promises conforming to the Promises/A+Promises/A+ specification 1.1 specification ** The Dojo Toolkit supplies promisespromises and Twisted style deferreds ** MochiKitJavaScript MochKit.Async inspired by Twisted's Deferreds ** jQuery's Deferred Object is based on the CommonJS Promises/A design. ** AngularJSJavaScript Angularjs ** node-promiseJavaScript node-promise ** Q, by Kris Kowal, conforms to Promises/A+ 1.1JavaScript Q ** RSVP.js, conforms to Promises/A+ 1.1JavaScript RSVP.js ** YUI'sYUI JavaScript class library promise classYUI JavaScript promise class conforms to the Promises/A+ 1.0 specification. ** Bluebird, by Petka AntonovJavaScript Bluebird ** The Closure Library's promise package conforms to the Promises/A+ specification. ** See Promise/A+'s list for more implementations based on the Promise/A+ design. * For Java: ** JDeferred, provides deferred-promise API and behavior similar to JQuery.Deferred objectJava JDeferred ** ParSeqJava ParSeq provides task-promise API ideal for asynchronous pipelining and branching, maintained by LinkedIn * For Lua: ** The cqueues module contains a Promise API. * For Objective-C: MAFuture,Objective-C MAFuture GitHubObjective-C MAFuture mikeash.com RXPromise,Objective-C RXPromise ObjC-CollapsingFutures,ObjC-CollapsingFutures PromiseKit,Objective-C PromiseKit objc-promise,Objective-C objc-promise OAPromise,Objective-C OAPromise * For OCaml: Lazy module implements lazy explicit futuresOCaml Lazy * For Perl: Future,Perl Future Promises,Perl Promises Reflex,Perl Reflex and Promise::ES6Perl Promise::ES6 * For PHP: React/PromisePHP React/Promise * For Python: ** Built-in implementationPython built-in implementation ** pythonfuturespythonfutures ** Twisted's DeferredsTwisted Deferreds * For R: ** future, implements an extendable future API with lazy and eager synchronous and (multicore or distributed) asynchronous futuresR package futurefuture * For Ruby: ** Promise gemRuby Promise gem ** libuv gem, implements promisesRuby libuv ** Celluloid gem, implements futuresRuby Celluloid gem ** future-resourceRuby future-resource * For Rust: ** futures-rsfutures-rs crate * For Scala: ** Twitter's util libraryTwitter's util library * For Swift: ** Async framework, implements C#-style \`async\`/non-blocking \`await\`Swift Async ** FutureKit,Swift FutureKit implements a version for Apple GCDSwift Apple GCD ** FutureLib, pure Swift 2 library implementing Scala-style futures and promises with TPL-style cancellationSwift FutureLib ** Deferred, pure Swift library inspired by OCaml's Deferredbignerdranch/Deferred ** BrightFuturesThomvis/BrightFutures * For Tcl: tcl-promisetcl-promise ===Coroutines=== Futures can be implemented in coroutines or generators,Does async/await solve a real problem?

Stokes joined the station as part of an effort to increase ratings on WABC's morning newscast and helped bring the broadcast to #1. ==Career== Stokes began her journalistic career as the medical reporter and then weekend co-anchor at WCIA in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois in 1986. Then, in 1988, she worked as a reporter and weekend anchor for WBTV in Charlotte, North Carolina. There for two years, she became popular with the viewers in that state. Next, Stokes worked as a crime and street reporter for WBFF-TV, the Fox Station in Baltimore. Finally, Stokes got hands on experience for full-time anchor as WJLA-TV's lead female anchor of the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts. She was there from 1992 through 1996. Then Stokes went to MSNBC at the time of its inception. She was one of the original anchors on the 24-hour cable news television channel and the first African American to speak on the cable news network. MSNBC hired newcomer \\"girl in glasses\\" Ashleigh Banfield to MSNBC in 2000 and replaced Stokes on MSNBC'S Today in America also in 2000. During her tenure at NBC News Stokes was a rotating newsreader for \\"NBC Sunrise\\" and Weekend Today. During her tenure at the cable TV station, Stokes covered the Columbine High School Massacre and the death of John F. Kennedy, Jr. in 1999. ===Career in New York City=== Stokes was paired with Robb Hanrahan who, at the time, also co- anchored the station's 5 p.m. news with Roz Abrams and had previously co- anchored the morning news. The new pair, who replaced anchors Nancy Loo and David Ushery, did not work as well as WABC had hoped they would. Hanrahan was taken off the morning news in December 2000 and replaced with WABC-TV's weekend sports anchor Steve Bartelstein. Stokes and Bartelstein proved to work well and eventually helped bring Eyewitness News This Morning back to the number one position it had enjoyed in previous years. The pair eventually took over anchoring duties for Eyewitness News at Noon, replacing Nancy Loo and David Ushery once again. For a brief time in 2003, Stokes was removed from the noon newscast and replaced with Sade Baderinwa. Stokes resumed anchoring the noon newscast when Roz Abrams left the station and was replaced by Baderinwa. From Tuesday, March 13, 2007, to Wednesday, July 4, 2007, (Independence Day), Stokes was the sole anchor of Eyewitness News This Morning and Eyewitness News at Noon. She was joined by a rotating roster of reporters from March until July when reporter Ken Rosato was chosen to permanently replace Steve Bartelstein. Rosato officially took over on July 9, 2007, as her morning and noon co-anchor. In fall 2010, the morning newscast expanded to begin at 4:30 a.m. and, in fall 2014, the noon news expanded to a full hour, which lengthened Stokes' and Rosato's already long days. As part of the expansion, WABC promised to relieve both of them of their noon duties in order to focus on the morning news. That promise was kept and, in June 2015, Stokes and Rosato handed over noon duties to David Navarro and Shirleen Allicot. Lori Stokes left Eyewitness News in August 2017. It was announced that October 4, 2017, Stokes will start her first day and will co-host Good Day New York with Rosanna Scotto on Fox-5 WNYW replacing Greg Kelly, who has allegedly, left on his own terms at Fox 5 WNYW. ==See also== * New Yorkers in journalism ==References== ==External links== * Lori Stokes at WABC-TV Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:New York (state) television reporters Category:Television anchors from New York City Category:MSNBC people Category:Journalists from Washington, D.C.

Kirby, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 482 (1868), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that statutes must be constructed reasonably. == Facts == In 1868, Farris, who was a carrier of the mail, was indicted for murder in the Circuit Court of Gallatin County, Kentucky. The state court judge issued a bench warrant to Kirby, the sheriff of Gallatin County, who seized Farris and brought him before the state court. However, the federal government then obtained an indictment from a grand jury charging Sheriff Kirby with \\"knowingly and willfully obstructing or retarding the passage of the mail\\", a federal offense under an Act of March 3, 1825. The question of \\"whether the arrest of the mail-carrier upon the bench warrant from the Circuit Court of Gallatin County was, in the circumstances, an obstruction of the mail within the meaning of the Act of Congress,\\" was certified to the US Supreme Court. == Holding == Mr. Justice Field, for a unanimous court, answered the certified question in the negative by applying the cardinal rule \\"that all laws should receive a sensible construction,\\" and that literal interpretations which \\"lead to injustice, oppression, or an absurd consequence\\" should be avoided. The Court concluded that \\"The reason of the law in such cases should prevail over its letter\\", and therefore ruled that the law could not be applied to the sheriff's actions. ==See also== *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 74 ==External links== * * Category:1868 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Chase Court Category:United States statutory interpretation case law Category:History of Kentucky Category:Criminal cases in the Chase Court ","title":"United States v.

Due to Walnut Creek's high ridership and large catchment area, BART proposed in 2004 that the station be the center of a transit-oriented development scheme which includes 440 residential units, of office space, of retail space, and 1,373 parking spaces. A parking lot on the west side of the station closed on February 3, 2018. A 900-space parking garage was constructed in its place, which allowed other parking lots to be closed for the new development. The new garage, which includes a three-lane bus plaza, opened on March 29, 2019. ==Station layout== Walnut Creek station has two side platforms with two tracks. Access to the tracks is provided by a staircase, escalator, and elevator from the mezzanine, which houses nine faregates.

It begins with the history of same-sex unions during ancient times, which consisted of unions ranging from informal and temporary relationships to highly ritualized unions, and continues to modern-day state-recognized same-sex marriage. Events concerning same-sex marriages becoming legal in a country or in a country's state are listed in bold. ==Ancient times (10000 BC ‚Äì 100)== Various types of same-sex marriages have existed, ranging from informal, unsanctioned relationships to highly ritualized unions. Cicero mentions the marriage (using the Latin verb for \\"to marry\\", i.e. nubere) of the son of Curio the Elder, but he does it in a metaphorical form to criticize his enemy Antonius. Cicero states thus that the younger Curio was \\"united in a stable and permanent marriage\\" to Antonius.Cicero Philippic 18 February, 2.45 See old translation at: http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi- bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0021&layout;=&loc;=18 February, 2.45 Martial also mentions a number of same-sex marriages, but always in derisory terms against people whom he wants to mock.Martial 12.42, 1.35, 3.93, 12.95.

(1990). Passions of the Cut Sleeve. University of California Press. pp. 35‚Äì36. The first Roman emperor to have married a man was Nero, who is reported to have married two other men on different occasions. First with one of his freedmen, Pythagoras, to whom Nero took the role of the bride, and later as a groom Nero married a young boy, who resembled one of his concubines,Nero missed her so greatly after her death that on learning of a woman who resembled her he at first sent for her and kept her; but later he caused a boy of the freedmen, whom he used to call Sporus,...\\"he formally \\"married\\" Sporus, and assigned the boy a regular dowry according to contract;\\" q.v., Suetonius Nero 28; Dio Cassius Epitome 62.28 Old Translation of passage at: http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/62*.html named Sporus.

A law in the Theodosian Code (C. Th. 9.7.3) was issued in 342 AD by the Christian emperors Constantius II and Constans. This law prohibited same-sex marriage in ancient Rome and ordered that those who were so married were to be executed. In the Middle Ages, a same-sex marriage between the two men Pedro D√≠az and Mu√±o Vandilaz in the Galician municipality of Rairiz de Veiga in Spain occurred on 16 April 1061. They were married by a priest at a small chapel. The historic documents about the church wedding were found at Monastery of San Salvador de Celanova. The Siwa Oasis in Egypt had an historical acceptance of male homosexuality and even rituals of same-sex marriage‚Äîtraditions that Egyptian authorities have sought to repress, with increasing success, since the early 20th century. The German egyptologist George Steindorff explored the oasis in 1900 and reported that homosexual relations were common and often extended to a form of marriage. ==1970s1970=== James Michael McConnell, librarian,The Board of Regents revoked an offer mailed by the University Librarian to McConnell. * 1967: McConnell insisted, on Baker's 25th Birthday, that he would accept Baker's offer if, and only if, the relationship would eventually be recognized as a \\"legal\\" marriage. * 1970: The Board accepted the recommendation of its Executive Committee \\"That the appointment of Mr. J.

Formally established by the U.S. Air Force at the end of World War II and the start of the \\"Cold War\\", it was extended to the Navy and United States Marine Corps and consolidated within the Air Force during the Korean War with greater focus on \\"resistance training\\". During the Vietnam War (1959‚Äì1975) there was clear need for \\"Jungle\\" survival training and greater public focus on American POWs. As a result, the U.S. military expanded SERE programs and training sites. In the late 1980s the U.S. Army became more involved with SERE as Special Forces and \\"Spec Ops\\" grew. Today, SERE is taught to a wide variety of personnel in three categories based upon risk of capture and exploitation value with high emphasis on aircrew, special operations, and foreign diplomatic and intelligence personnel. ==HistoryOrigins=== \\"Survival training\\" for soldiers has ancient origins as survival is an obvious goal of combat.\\"Every soldier, regardless of rank, position, and MOS must be able to shoot, move, communicate, and survive in order to contribute to the team and survive in combat.\\" Army FM 7-21.13 (\\"The Soldier's Guide\\"), p. A-1 Survival training was not really distinct from \\"combat training\\" until navies realized the need to teach sailors to swim. Such training was not related to combat and was intended solely to help sailors survive. Similarly, fire-fighting training has long been a navy focus and remains so today (although survival of the ship may be the primary goal). Water survival training has been a distinct and formal part of Navy basic training since World War II although its importance was greatly increased with the advent and expansion of naval aviation. The origins of what is now called SERE are rooted in the leadership of Britain's MI9 Evasion and Escape (\\"E&E;\\") organization, formed at the onset of World War II (1939‚Äì1945). Led by World War I veteran Colonel (later Brigadier) Norman Crockatt, MI9 were formed to train air crew and Special Forces in evading enemy troops following bail out, forced landings, or becoming cut off behind enemy lines. A training school was established in London, and officers and instructors from MI9 also began visiting operational air bases, providing local training to air crews unable to be detached from their duties to attend formal courses. MI9 went on to devise a multitude of evasion and escape tools: overt items to aid immediate evasion after bailing out and covert items for use to aid escape following capture that were hidden within uniforms and personal items (concealed compasses, silk and tissue maps, etc.). Once the United States entered the war in 1941, MI9 staff traveled to Washington D.C. to discuss their now mature E&E; training, devices, and proven results with the United States Army Air Forces (\\"USAAF\\"). As a result, the United States initiated their own Evasion and Escape organization, known as MIS-X, based at Fort Hunt, Virginia. There were also several unofficial private \\"clubs\\" created during World War II by British and American pilots who had managed to escape from and evade the Germans during the war and return to friendly lines. One such club was the \\"Late Arrivals' Club\\". This strictly non-military club had a \\"Flying Boot\\" as its identifying symbol which was worn under the left collar of their uniform. USAAF General Curtis LeMay realized that it was much cheaper and more effective to train aircrews in Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape techniques than to have them lost in the arctic (or ocean) or languishing (or lost) in enemy hands. Thus, he supported the establishment of formal SERE training at several bases/locations (from July 1942 to May 1944) hosting the 336th Bombardment Group (now the 336th Training Group), including a small program for Cold Weather Survival at RCAF Station Namao in Edmonton, Alberta where American, British, and Canadian B29 aircrews received basic survival training. In 1945, a consolidated survival training center was initiated at Fort Carson, Colorado under the 3904th Training Squadron, and, in 1947 the Arctic Indoctrination Survival School (colloquially known as \\"the Cool School\\") opened at Marks Air Force Base in Nome, Alaska. During WWII, the US Navy discovered that 75% of its pilots who had been shot or forced down came down alive, yet barely 5% of them survived because they could not swim or find sustenance in the water or on remote islands. Since the ability to swim was an essential survival skill for navy pilots, training programs were developed to ensure pilot trainees could swim (requiring cadets to swim one mile and dive 50 feet underwater to escape bullets and suction from sinking aircraft). Soon, the training was expanded to include submerged aircraft escape. During the Korean War (1950‚Äì1953) the Air Force moved their survival school to Stead AFB, Reno Stead Airport as the 3635th Combat Crew Training Wing. In 1952, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) designated the United States Air Force (USAF) as executive agent (EA, as below) for joint escape and evasion. The Korean War showed that traditional notions about captives during wartime were no longer valid ‚Äì the North Koreans (with Chinese backing) simply ignored the Geneva Conventions regarding treatment of POWs and showed that captured American soldiers were not prepared for what they faced. This was especially true of American airmen who took the brunt of mistreatment because of their hated bombardments and their \\"prestige\\" among soldiers. The North Koreans were very interested in the propaganda value of their American captives and their new methods (with those of the Chinese) for gaining compliance, extracting confessions, and gathering information proved unnervingly successful against American soldiers.Carlson, L.,\\"Remembered prisoners of a forgotten war: An oral history of the Korean War POWs\\",New York: St. Martin‚Äôs (2002) ===A Change in Focus=== Thus, soon after the Korean War ended DoD initiated the Defense Advisory Committee on Prisoners of War to study and report on the problems, issues and possible solutions regarding the Korean War POW fiasco. The charter of the committee was to find a suitable approach for preparing our armed forces to deal with the combat and captivity environment. The committee's key recommendation was the implementation of a military \\"Code of Conduct\\" that embodied traditional American values as moral obligations of soldiers during combat and captivity. Underlying this code was belief that captivity was to be thought of as an extension of the battlefield ‚Äì a place where soldiers were expected to accept death as a possible duty.It wasn't until 1977 that the code was modified with the intent to make it more practical by removing or changing wording that implied death was often the most suitable course of action. President Eisenhower then issued Executive Order 10631 that stated: \\"Every member of the Armed Forces of the United States are expected to measure up to the standards embodied in the Code of Conduct while in combat or in captivity.\\" The US military then began the process for training and implementing this directive. While it was accepted that the Code of Conduct would be taught to all US soldiers at the earliest point of their military training, the Air Force knew much more would be needed. At the USAF \\"Survival School\\" (Stead AFB), the concepts of evasion, resistance, and escape were expanded and new curricula were developed as \\"Code of Conduct Training\\". That curricula have remained the foundation of modern SERE training throughout the U.S. military. The Navy also recognized the need for new and different training and by the late 1950s, formal SERE training was initiated at \\"Detachment SERE\\" Naval Air Station Brunswick in Maine with a 12-day Code of Conduct course designed to give Navy pilots and aircrew the skills necessary to survive and evade capture, and if captured, resist interrogation and escape. Later, the course was expanded so that other Navy and Marine Corps troops, such as SEALs, SWCC, EOD, RECON / MARSOC, and Navy Combat Medics would attend. Subsequently, a second school was opened at Naval Air Station North Island.https://www.cnic.navy.mil/NorthIsland/ The Marine Corps opened their Pickel Meadow camp (initially established by Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton) in 1951 where Marines would be trained in outdoor survival and, later, as the Mountain Warfare Training Center (MCMWTC) Bridgeport, California, in Level A SERE (as below). In 1953 the Army established the \\"Jungle Operations Training Center\\" at Fort Sherman in Panama (known as \\"Green Hell\\"). Operations there were ramped up during the 1960s to meet the demand for jungle-trained soldiers in Vietnam. In 1958, the Marine Corps opened Camp Gonsalves in northern Okinawa, Japan where jungle warfare and survival training was offered to soldiers headed for Vietnam. As the Vietnam War progressed, the Air Force also opened a \\"Jungle Survival School\\" at Clark Air Base in the Philippines. When Stead AFB closed in 1966, the USAF \\"survival school\\" was moved to Fairchild Air Force Base in Washington State (where it is centered today). The Air Force also had other survival schools including the \\"Tropical Survival School\\" at Howard Air Force Base in the Panama Canal Zone, the \\"Arctic Survival School\\" at Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska and the \\"Water Survival School\\" at Homestead Air Force Base, Florida which operated under separate commands. In April 1971, these schools were brought under the same Group and squadrons were organized to conduct training at Clark, Fairchild and Homestead, while detachments were used for other localized survival training (the acronym \\"SERE\\" was not used extensively in the Air Force until later in the 1970s). In 1976, following accusations and reports of abuses during Navy SERE training, DoD established a committee (i.e., \\"Defense Review Committee\\") to examine the need for changes in Code of Conduct training and after hearing from experts and former POWs, they recommended the standardization of SERE training among all branches of the military and the expansion of SERE to include \\"lessons learned from previous US Prisoner of War experiences\\" (intending to make the training more \\"realistic and useful\\").https://www.loc.gov/item/powmia/pw046821/ In late 1984, the Pentagon issued DoD Directive 1300.7 which established three levels of SERE training with the \\"resistance portion\\" incorporated at \\"Level C\\". That level of training was specified for soldiers whose \\"assignment has a high risk of capture and whose position, rank, or seniority make them vulnerable to greater than average exploitation efforts by a captor\\". While initially only four military bases (Fairchild AFB, SERE), Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Naval Air Station North Island, and Camp Mackall (at Fort Bragg) were officially authorized to conduct Level C training, other bases have been added (such as Fort Rucker). Individual bases may conduct SERE courses which include C-level elements (see \\"Schools\\" below). The required (every 3 years) Level C refresher course is commonly taught by USAF \\"detachments\\" (often just one SERE specialist/instructor) stationed at a base or a traveling specialist who travels where requested. As the designated executive agency for US military SERE training, the USAF's 336th Training Group continues to provide the only US military career SERE specialists and instructors who are part of Air Force Special Warfare Operations and are utilized in varied roles throughout the Air Force and DoD. See USAF \\"Survival Instructors\\", below. ===Selecting an Executive Agency=== The DoD defines Executive Agency or \\"EA\\" as \\"the Head of a DOD Component to whom the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) or the Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF) has assigned specific responsibilities, functions, and authorities to provide defined levels of support for operational missions, or administrative or other designated activities that involve two or more of the DOD Components.\\" DoD chose the U.S. Air Force as its Executive Agency (\\"EA\\") for joint escape and evasion in 1952 and it was therefore the logical candidate to be chosen as the EA for SERE and CoC training in 1979.DoD Directive 1300.7; see also: \\"Return With Honor: Code of Conduct Training In the National Military Strategy Security Environment\\" by Maj. Laura M. Ryan, Thesis NPS, September 2004 The Air Force remained EA for most survival, evasion, escape and rescue related matters until 1995. But, with the growing importance of personnel recovery (PR), the United States Department of Defense (\\"DoD\\") established the Joint Services Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) Agency (JSSA) in 1991 and designated it the DoD EA for DoD Prisoner of War / Missing in Action (POW / MIA) matters. In 1994 the JSSA was designated as the central organizer and implementer for PR and the USAF as the EA for Joint Combat Search and Rescue (JCSAR) Combat search and rescue. In 1999, the JPRA Joint Personnel Recovery Agency was created as an agency under the Commander in Chief, US Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) and was named the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for DoD- wide PR matters. JPRA has been designated a Chairman's Controlled Activity since 2011. JPRA has its headquarters at Fort Belvoir and as organizing agency (\\"OA\\") for all DoD \\"resistance\\" training, it has close ties with the 336th Training Group (which was given the role of organizing and operating the Personnel Recovery Academy or PRA). JPRA and the PRA now coordinate PR activities and train PR/SERE globally with American allies making extensive use of USAF SERE experts.\\"Personnel Recovery: Strategic Importance and Impact\\" by Pera, Miller, & Whitcomb, Air & Space Power Journal, Nov.‚ÄìDec. 2012, pp. 83-122 (A history of U.S. PR) at https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/ASPJ/journals/Volume-26_Issue-6/F-Pera- Miller-Whitcomb.pdf ===USAF \\"Survival Instructors\\"/SERE Specialists=== A SERE Specialist with the 22nd Training Squadron The first USAF \\"survival instructors\\" were experienced civilian wilderness volunteers and USAF personnel with prior instructor experience (and they included a small cadre of \\"USAF Rescuemen\\" United States Air Force Pararescue). When the Army Air Force formed the Air Rescue Service (ARS) in 1946, the 5th Rescue Squadron conducted the first Pararescue and Survival School at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida MacDill Air Force Base. With the move to Stead AFB and the opening of a full- time survival school, the USAF initiated the military's only full-time, career survival instructor program (with the Air Force Specialty Code \\"921\\"). By the time the Air Force opened the survival school at Fairchild AFB (1966), it also opened a separate \\"Instructor Training Branch' (\\"ITB\\") under the 3636th Combat Crew Training Squadron where all Air Force Survival Instructors received their specialist training (six months of classroom and field training) and initial qualification rating (\\"Global Survival Instructor\\"). They then had to complete six months of On-the-Job Training (\\"OJT\\") training before they were qualified to teach SERE (aka \\"Combat Survival Training\\" or \\"CST\\"). Years of additional training for added specialties (such as arctic, jungle, tropics, and water survival, \\"resistance training\\", and \\"academic instruction\\") yield some of the best trained soldiers in the U.S. military. SERE Instructor Red Flag Patch Currently, USAF SERE specialist/instructor training is conducted under the 66th Training Squadron at Fairchild AFB. After selection and qualification conducted at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas (SERE specialist orientation course), potential future SERE instructors are assigned to the 66th Training Squadron to learn how to instruct SERE in any environment: the \\"field\\" survival course at Fairchild, the non-ejection water survival course at Fairchild AFB (which trains aircrew members of non-parachute-equipped aircraft), and the resistance training orientation course (which covers the theories and principles needed to conduct Level C Code of Conduct resistance training laboratory instruction). At some point in their training, USAF SERE specialists also earn their jump wings at the United States Army Airborne School. SERE Specialists who work in the \\"dunker\\" portion of the water survival course at Fairchild are certified through the Navy Salvage Dive Course. The SERE training instructor \\"7-level\\" upgrade course is a 19-day course that provides SERE instructors with advanced training in barren Arctic, barren desert, jungle, and open-ocean environments. Air Force's SERE instructors play key roles in DoD-wide training and in implementing other branch SERE training programs (both the Navy and Army send their SERE instructors to take the basic 9-day SERE course (SV-80-A) taught by the 22nd TS (the other branches have no career option for SERE). Because the Air Force has the largest and best trained SERE staff, it assumes diverse roles DoD wide, such as furnishing SERE training for Red Flag exercises.https://www.mountainhome.af.mil/News/Photos/igphoto/2000608306/ ==Curriculum== SERE curriculum has evolved from being primarily focused on \\"outdoor survival training\\" to increasingly add focus upon \\"evasion, resistance, and escape\\". Military survival training differs from typical civilian programs in several key areas: # The anticipated military survival situation almost always begins with exiting a vehicle - an aircraft or ship. Thus, the scenario begins with exit strategies, practices, and means (ejecting, parachuting, underwater escape, etc.). # Military survival training has greater focus on specialized military survival equipment, survival kits, signaling, rescue techniques, and recovery methods. # Military personnel are almost always better prepared for survival situations because of obvious inherent risk in their activities (and their training and equipment). Conversely, military personnel are subject to a much wider variety of likely scenarios as any given mission may expose them to a wide variety of risks, environments, and injuries. # In almost all military survival situations someone knows you're missing and will be looking for you with advanced equipment and pre-established protocols. # Military survival often involves exposure to an enemy. The basic survival skills taught in SERE programs include common outdoor/wilderness survival skills such as firecraft, sheltercraft, first aid, water procurement and treatment, food procurement (traps, snares, and wild edibles), improvised equipment, self-defense (natural hazards), and navigation (map and compass, et al.). More advanced survival training adds focus on mental elements such as will to survive, attitude, and \\"survival thinking\\" (situational awareness, assessment, prioritization). Military survival schools also teach unique skills such as parachute landings, basic and specialized signaling, vectoring a helicopter, use of rescue devices (forest-tree penetrators, harnesses, etc.), rough terrain travel, and interaction with indigenous peoples. ===Combat Survival=== The military \\"has an obligation to the American people to ensure its soldiers go into battle with the assurance of success and survival. This is an obligation that only rigorous and realistic training, conducted to standard, can fulfill\\".FM 7-21.13 (\\"The Soldier's Guide\\"), p. 5-2 The U.S. Army has long taken survival training as an integral part of combat readiness (per FM 7-21.13 \\"The Soldier's Guide\\" and FM 5-103 \\"Survivability\\") and combat training is largely about an individual soldier's survival as opposed to the enemy's non-survival. \\"Survival\\", as a distinct part of modern military training, largely emerges in special environment operations (as shown in \\"Mountain Operations\\", FM 3-97.6, \\"Jungle School\\", the Marine Corps' mountain warfare training center, the Air Force's Desert and Arctic Survival Schools (as above), and the Navy's Naval Special Warfare Cold Weather Detachment Kodiak. Certain skills have been identified that enhance every soldier's chance for survival (whether they are on the battlefield or not): # Use weapons properly and effectively # Move safely and efficiently through various terrains # Navigate from one point to another given point on the ground # Communicate as needed # Perform first aid (evaluate, stabilize, and transport) # Identify and react properly to hazards # Select and utilize offensive and defensive positions # Maintain personal health and readiness # Evade, resist, and escape (aka \\"kidnapping and hostage survival\\") # Know and utilize emergency procedures, survival equipment, and recovery systems ===General Survival=== All U.S. military branches recognize the enhanced risks for \\"special forces\\" and aircrew personnel. Thus, beyond basic combat skills and their specialty skills, these soldiers should have practical knowledge of survival skills to remain alive and facilitate rescue. Generally, they must have training in: # Special equipment and procedures intended to enhance their survivability (ejection seats, parachutes, communication and navigation devices, rescue devices and procedures, etc.) # Preparing for survival # Situational awareness and assessment # Understanding the environment: hazards and opportunities # Prioritizing needs and planning actions for personal protection, survival, and recovery (survival decisions) # If an enemy is involved - evasion (camouflage, travel techniques, et al.). # Shelter # Firehttps://www.aircav.com/survival/asch07/asch07p01.html # Water # Signaling (radios, mirrors, fire/smoke, flares, markers) # Rescue contact and recovery procedures # Navigation # Improvisation - an essential survival skill # Food procurement and preparation ===Evasion, Resistance, and Escape=== Evading an enemy has certain well-known basic skills, but the military doesn't want to openly discuss its practices since this may assist an enemy.The release of a previously classified \\"PREAL\\" training guide provides detailed information-https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/338917-pre-academic- laboratory-preal-operating.html Suffice it to say that major militaries spend considerable time and energy preparing for evasion with extensive planning (routes, practices, pick-up points, methods, \\"friendlies\\", \\"chits\\", weapons, etc.). Some elements of hostile survival preparedness and teaching are classified. This is especially true for \\"resistance\\" training where one hopes to prepare those who might be captured for hardship, stress, abuse, torture, interrogation, indoctrination, and exploitation.See \\"Evasion\\", pp. K-1 et seq. in JP 3-50 at https://fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/jp3_50.pdf The foundation for capture preparedness lies in knowing one's duty and rights if taken prisoner. For American soldiers, this begins with the Code of the United States Fighting Force. It is: # I am an American, fighting in the forces which guard my country and our way of life. I am prepared to give my life in their defense. # I will never surrender of my own free will. If in command, I will never surrender the members of my command while they still have the means to resist. # If I am captured, I will continue to resist by all means available. I will make every effort to escape and to aid others to escape. I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy. # If I become a prisoner of war, I will keep faith with my fellow prisoners. I will give no information nor take part in any action which might be harmful to my comrades. If I am senior I will take command. If not, I will obey the lawful orders of those appointed over me and will back them up in every way. # When questioned, should I become a prisoner of war, I am required to give name, rank, service number, and date of birth. I will evade answering further questions to the utmost of my ability, I will make no oral or written statements disloyal to my country and its allies or harmful to their cause. # I will never forget that I am an American, fighting for freedom, responsible for my actions, and dedicated to the principles which made my country free. I will trust in my God and in the United States of America.Code of Conduct, Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) Training, U.S. Army Regulation 350-30, December 10, 1985USAFA 2010‚Äì2011 Contrails Training on how to survive and resist an enemy in the event of capture is generally based on past experiences of captives and prisoners of war. Thus, it is important to know who one's captors are likely to be and what to expect from them. Intelligence regarding such things is sensitive, but in the modern era, captives are less likely to enjoy the status of \\"prisoner of war\\" so as to gain protections under the Geneva Conventions relating to such.https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/GC_1949-III.pdf American soldiers are still taught the standards of international law for humanitarian treatment in war, but they are far less likely to receive those protections them than to offer them. Because details cannot be offered, a few examples of well-known resistance methods provide clues as to the nature of resistance techniques:See \\"Lessons from the Hanoi Hilton: Six Characteristics of High Performance Teams\\" by Peter Fretwell, Taylor B. Kiland, Naval Institute Press (2013) # Use of a tap code to secretly communicate between captives. # When U.S. Navy Commander Jeremiah Denton was forced to appear at a televised press conference, he repeatedly blinked the word \\"T-O-R-T-U-R-E\\" with Morse code. # The \\"code\\" of prisoners at the \\"Hanoi Hilton\\" H·ªèa L√≤ Prison: \\"Take physical torture until you are right at the edge of losing your ability to be rational. At that point, lie, do, or say whatever you must do to survive. But you first must take physical torture.\\" # A pilot POW who gave the name of comic book heroes when his captors demanded the name of his fellow pilots.https://usnhistory.navylive.dodlive.mil/2015/11/13/navy-legend-vice- adm-stockdale-led-pow-resistance/ # Much from The Great Escape (book). The teaching of \\"resistance\\" is typically done in a \\"simulation laboratory\\" setting where \\"resistance training\\" instructors act as hostile captors and soldier-students are treated as realistically as possible as captives/POWs with isolation, harsh conditions, close confinement, stress, mock interrogation, and \\"torture simulations\\". While it is impossible to simulate the reality of hostile captivity, such training has proven very effective in helping those who have endured captivity know what to expect of their captivity and themselves under such conditions. Code of Conduct Training Levels Under current DoD public policy, SERE Code of Conduct (aka \\"Resistance\\") training has three levels: * Level A: Entry level training. These are the Code of Conduct classes (now commonly taken on-line) required for all military personnel - normally at recruit training (\\"basic\\") and \\"OCS\\" Officer Candidate School. * Level B: For those operating or expected to operate forward of the division rear boundary and up to the forward line of own troops (FLOT). Normally limited to aircrew of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force. Level B focuses on survival and evasion, with resistance in terms of initial capture. *Level C: For troops at a high risk of capture and whose position, rank, or seniority make them vulnerable to greater than average exploitation efforts by any captor. Level C training focuses on resistance to exploitation and interrogation, survival during isolation and captivity, and escape from hostiles (e.g., \\"prison camps\\"). \\"Escape Training\\" has elements similar to evasion and resistance training - if details are revealed, we potentially help adversaries and harm our soldiers. Much of this training has to do with observation, planning, preparation, and contingencies. And much of this comes from historical experience so public sources are revealing (such as the movies The Great Escape (film) and Rescue Dawn). ===Special Survival Situations=== 1\\\\. Water (ocean, river, littoral) Survival: Military personnel are much more likely to find themselves in a water survival situation than others. How to survive in water is taught at Navy Recruit Training, Navy SUBSCOL Submarine Escape Training, the Air Force Water Survival Course and at a separate SoF Special Forces Professional Military Education (PME) courses. Featured in such courses are topics and exercises such as:AFM 64-3 \\"Survival Training Edition\\"(1977); NAVAER 00-80T-56, \\"SURVIVALTRAINING GUIDE\\" (1955) # Underwater escape from vessel/vehicle (from submarines to aircraft) # Water parachute landing # Swimming out from under a parachute # Dealing with \\"rough\\" water\\" # Boarding and getting out of a life raft # Life in a raft # Use of aquatic survival gear # Aquatic environment hazards # Aquatic environment first aid (seasickness, immersion injuries, animal injuries) # Food and water procurement and preparation # Drown-proofing, swimming, flotation # Special Psychological Concerns # Ocean ecology 2\\\\. Arctic (sea ice, tundra) Survival: Air Force aircrews spend considerable time flying over arctic regions Polar Routes and while modern arctic survival situations are rare, the training remains useful and worthwhile because its content obviously relates to winter survival anywhere. All U.S. military branches have some type of cold/winter/mountain survival training originating from hard-learned lessons during the Korean War (see above and below). Dealing with cold conditions presents several unique content areas: # Cold injuries: frostbite, hypothermia, chilblains, immersion foot # Snow/Ice/Cold Issues: snow blindness, avalanches/ice fall, icebergs, wind chill # Staying Warm # Why an igloo or snow cave is far better than a tent # Firecraft # Saving calories, burning calories, and finding calories. # Arctic/Snow Travel # Water # Hazards of moisture/Keeping dry 3\\\\. Desert Survival: While desert survival training was part of U.S. military survival courses since their inception (see Air Forces Manual No. 21) the focus of survival training went that direction in 1990 with Operation Desert Shield Gulf War (1990-1991). Desert survival training is likely to remain a major focus in the foreseeable future. While there is a common mistake to think of deserts as hot, much of the Arctic (and Antarctic) is also desert polar desert. And under the definition of desert climate (a climate in which there is an excess of evaporation over precipitation), some deserts are deemed \\"cold weather deserts\\" (such as the Gobi Desert. Because the unifying feature of all deserts is a lack of water, that is the focus for desert survival: # Conserve water (but don't over-do it): If it's hot, avoid perspiration; if it's cold, avoid dehydrating respiration # Understanding dehydration # Water sources in arid regions # Hot desert - shelter by day, move/act by night # Cold desert - trap breath moisture # Desert shelters (above or below surface) # Desert garb # Desert hazards and treatments # Desert signaling # Desert travel 4\\\\. Jungle/Tropics Survival: Staying alive in the jungle is relatively easy, but doing so comfortably can be very difficult. There are good reasons why soldiers deemed JWS (Jungle Warfare School) in Panama \\"Green Hell\\": # The jungle environment: conditions (wet, wetter, wettest) heat index # Jungle hazards # Jungle ailments: trench foot, insect bites, bad food, bad water, parasites, snake bite # Food # Water preparation/treatment # Jungle shelter(s) # Firecraft # Jungle improvisation # Jungle signaling and rescue 5\\\\. Isolation Survival: Isolation is not just \\"being alone\\", it's being away from the familiar and comforting. Isolation survival has long been part of SERE in the \\"resistance\\" portion of training, but has more recently been recognized as worthy of broader attention. The psychological impact of suddenly finding yourself alone, lost, or outside your \\"comfort zone\\" can be debilitating, seriously depressing, and even fatal (via panic). Isolation survival also focuses upon the broader view of captivity to include kidnapping and non-combatant captivity. Isolation survival training has more focus on psychological preparedness and less upon \\"skills\\". # Understanding and avoiding panic # The importance of \\"keeping your wits about you\\" # Focus, Observe, Plan, and Envision (\\"FOPE\\") # Stress \\"fight or flight\\" coping response, the \\"stress cycle\\", and things to help you stay calm. # The psychology of captivity ==U.S. Military SERE/Survival Schools and Courses== The vast majority of SERE/Survival Schools mentioned in \\"History\\" above are still operating. There has also been growth in private sector SERE Schools and training (which are not relevant herein). However, there has been a significant change in military use of private sector SERE training that is relevant here. That change has produced one odd outcome - the military has found it difficult to keep their well-trained and highly experienced SERE instructors because of lucrative private sector opportunities. (A 2020 Google search for \\"SERE Instructor Jobs\\" found over 1 million \\"hits\\"). The vast majority of those jobs require military SERE training. Branch distinctions for SERE have become less clear or relevant since the creation of the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA, as above). Because the JPRA has \\"primary responsibility for DoD-wide personnel recovery matters,\\" (which specifically includes Level C SERE training), it integrates, coordinates, mandates, and draws from all military branches as needed. It is also worthy to note that much of military SERE is viewed as \\"joint operations\\" and cross-branch training is common (or required). SERE training detachments (usually, USAF) often work with different branches, especially where bases have been combined as \\"Joint Bases\\" and for update/review training. In that regard, designating schools by branch may be less meaningful. # SERE 100.2 (J3TA-US1329) is a joint services Level A SERE education and training course supporting the military-wide \\"Code of Conduct\\" training requirement. It is 4 hour course available on-line or as an on-base classroom course. It is common practice for joint operation SERE training to be conducted at, through, or in conjunction with individual military bases. ===U.S. Army=== Dakota hole to conceal a fire in order to better protect their position from enemy observation. The Army position statement on SERE training is clear: \\"The Army has an obligation to the American people to ensure its soldiers go into battle with the assurance of success and survival. This is an obligation that only rigorous and realistic training, conducted to standard, can fulfill.\\" Like all military branches, the Army operates under DOD Directive 1300.7 which requires and specifies Code of Conduct training for military personnel. Because the Army views a large portion of its training as \\"survival\\" related and since the Army has more soldiersPersonnel in United States Armed Forces major branches: U.S. Army 471,513, U.S. Navy 325,802, U.S. Air Force 323,222, U.S. Marine Corps 184,427 than the other branches, there are many modes and schools for survival and SERE training (as indicated above and below). Army Airborne School, for example is largely about surviving parachute jumps but is not deemed a \\"survival school\\". Army Rangers, Delta Force and other SoF soldiers receive extensive survival training as an inherent part of their overall combat training (as well as specific SERE training). The mission of the United States Army SERE training is \\"to ensure each student gains the ability to effectively employ the SERE tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) necessary to return with honor regardless of the circumstances of separation, isolation or capture.\\" The major \\"specialized schools\\" and courses for Army SERE training include: # John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (SWCS) at Camp Mackall where Army Special Operations Forces (ARSOF) personnel complete their Special Forces Qualification Course (SFQC - Phase III \\"SF Tactical Combat Skills\\") with a 19-day SERE course (including the Special Operations Forces' (ARSOF) Resistance Training Laboratory (RTL)) that includes Level C training.Survival, Evasion Resistance and Escape (SERE) Course (PHASE II SFQC), U.S. Army Special Operations Center of Excellence, last accessed April 22, 2017] # Army Aviation School at Fort Rucker where 21 days of SERE training is included in the Army aviators curriculum. The program has a Level C course with both academics and resistance training labs.SERE training develops leaders for complex environment, Army.mil, by CPT Erik Olsen, dated November 21, 2014, last accessed April 22, 2017 The Basic Officer's Leadership Course (BOLC) includes introductory SERE training including Helicopter Over- water Survival Training (HOST). The SERE Level C course exposes students to various captor exploitation efforts including interrogation (eight methods), indoctrination, propaganda, video propaganda, concessions, forced labor, and reprisals. A simulated captivity environment provides experience which includes wartime, peacetime governmental detention, and hostage detention scenarios with content involving resistance postures, techniques and strategies, establishing overt and covert organizations, establishing overt and covert communications, and planning and executing escapes in captivity environments. # Northern Warfare Training Center (NWTC) at Black Rapids, Alaska (administered from Fort Wainwright) where several courses are intended to maintain the U.S. Army's abilities in cold weather and mountain warfare. The Cold Weather Orientation Course (CWOC), Cold Weather Indoctrination Course (CWIC),https://api.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/440625.pdf and Basic Military Mountaineering Course (BMMC)https://www.army.mil/article/170422/basic_military_mountaineering_course each have specific \\"survival\\" sections. # The Jungle Operations Training Course (JOTC) at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii is a 12-day program of instruction with focus on jungle operations and survival. Students learn tactics, techniques, and procedures required to fight, win, and survive within any jungle environment. # Desert Warrior Course outside of Fort Bliss, Texas where a 20-day course emphasizes the \\"individual strain on the body from the heat, sun, high winds and dryness.\\" There is also special focus on desert hazards (\\"rattlesnakes, cobras, vipers, scorpions, tarantulas, camel spiders, coyotes, camels, big cats and antelope\\") and related medical skills. === U.S. Navy=== The USN Center for Security Forces (CENSECFOR) of the Naval Education and Training Command (NETC) at Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek‚ÄìFort Story promulgates the Navy's SERE training. The mission of the Command is \\"to educate and train those who serve, providing the tools and opportunities which enable life-long learning, professional and personal growth and development, ensuring fleet readiness and mission accomplishment; and to perform such other functions and tasks assigned by higher authority\\". This includes basic survival training for all Navy sailors and DOD Directive 1300.7 requiring \\"Code of Conduct\\" training (as above). The major Navy SERE schools and courses include: # The Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) School (A-2D-4635 or E-2D-0039) at CENSECFOR Detachment SERE East, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, New Hampshire offers several SERE courses including the outdoor/field course at the Navy Remote Training Site, Kittery, Maine, a \\"Risk of Isolation Brief\\" course, and the SERE Instructor Under Training course. The school employs approximately 100 military and civilian personnel and trains an average of 1,200 students per year. # Cold Weather Environmental Survival Training (CWEST) at Rangeley, Maine - the US Navy's only cold weather survival school. # The Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) School (A-2D-4635 or E-2D-0039) at CENSECFOR Detachment SERE West, Naval Air Station North Island, California provides all levels of \\"Code of Conduct\\" training for Recon Marines, Marine Corps Scout Snipers, MARSOC Marines, Navy SEALs, enlisted Navy and Marine aircrewmen, Naval Aviators, Naval Flight Officers, Naval Flight Surgeons, Navy EOD, and Navy SWCC. The school operates the Navy Remote Training Site at Warner Springs where soldiers learn basic skills necessary for worldwide survival, facilitating search and rescue efforts, and evading capture by hostile forces. Additional Level C Code of Conduct training includes a five-day Peacetime Detention and Hostage Survival (PDAHS) course providing skills to survive captivity by a hostile government or terrorist cell during peacetime. # Recruit Training Command's Water Survival Division at Naval Station Great Lakes (NAVSTA Great Lakes), Illinois offers introductory survival training including: basic sea survival training; lifeboat organization, survival kit contents and usage, abandon ship procedures, and swim qualification (3rd class). # Naval Special Warfare (NSW) SERE (K-431-0400), Naval Special Warfare Center, Coronado, California (mostly classified personnel recovery TTPs). # Naval Aviation Survival Training Centers: The Navy operates eight water survival training centers for its aviators (Miramar, Jacksonville, Norfolk, Cherry Point, Pensacola, Patuxent River, Lemorre, and Whidbey Island). NASTC \\"provides and meets the aviation survival and safety requirements of all Naval Aviation and DoD activities. Through didactic classroom or squadron lectures, simulator devices and a curriculum that emphasizes hands-on exposure to survival skills, we offer the best survival training available to the Fleet.\\"https://www.med.navy.mil/sites/nmotc/nsti/Pages/ASTCNorfolk.aspx # Naval Special Warfare Advanced Training Command (NSWATC) courses (4) providing advanced training related to SERE and Personnel Recovery (PR) to Naval Special Warfare (NSW) trainees (SEAL/Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewman pipeline students and Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) personnel) and other select groups at Kodiak, Alaska and Virginia Beach, Virginia. ===Air Force=== USAF SERE Instructor explaining how to jump safely with a parachute The Air Education and Training Command (AETC) has over 60,000 personnel and is responsible for all Air Force training programs, including SERE training. In the AETC, the 336TH Training Group at Fairchild AFB, Washington has the mission to \\"provide high risk of isolation personnel with the skills and confidence to \\"RETURN WITH HONOR\\" regardless of the circumstances of isolation.\\" It is also the largest U.S. Military SERE training provider training more than 6,000 SERE students a year.\\" As with the other branches, the Air Force offers a wide scope of survival training within other courses, but unique to the Air Force is the stationing of career SERE specialists at bases around the world as renewal and upgrade SERE instructors, advisors, and PR specialists. In the mid-80s, the USAF Combat \\"Desert\\" Survival Course was established by the 3636th Combat Crew Training Wing and USAF Survival Training Schools began emphasizing \\"Combat SERE Training\\" (CST) instead of \\"Global SERE Training\\". The primary Air Force survival schools/courses are: # Arctic Survival School - the \\"Cool School\\" offered by the 66th TRS, Det. 1, at Eielson AFB, Alaska - a five-day course consisting of both classroom instruction and a 3-day field experience where students from all military branches along with \\"the Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other organizations that find their members operating in arctic conditions\\" get to build snow shelters, trap rabbits, and deal with being COLD. # SERE Specialist Selection Course (where over 50% of the hopefuls don't get to \\"first base\\") offered by the 66th TRS, Det. 3, at Lackland AFB, Texas - a rigorous pre-screening intended to save the Air Force time and money - and students needless pain and suffering. # Evasion and Conduct After Capture (ECAC) Course, also by the 66th TRS, Det. 3 at Lackland. A Level B code of Conduct course that may act as partial/preparation course for Level C Code of Conduct (completed elsewhere). # Non-ejection Water Survival offered by the 22nd TS at Fairchild - a 2-day course with an obvious focus. # SV-80-A - the USAF aircrew SERE course is the largest in the military with 6,000+ attendees in an average year. This 19-day course mixes classroom, field, and \\"laboratory\\" (captive simulation) experiences to prepare students to \\"Return with Honor\\". The course is the \\"standard\\" for Level C Code of Conduct training and is offered broadly beyond the Air Force. # JPRA courses: The Personnel Recovery Academy is located with the SERE school at Fairchild and there is significant overlap in instruction and facility. The west coast JPRA facility is just across the highway at White Bluffs where separate Level C(+) training is offered (mostly classified). # SV-81-A - the U.S. military's only career SERE Specialist Course is offered by the 66th TS at the Air Force Survival School at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington and other regional locations. After a grueling selection process, successful students re-locate to Fairchild where they experience what they will teach by completing the SV-60-A course. Then they undertake a series of challenging field training exercises over a 5-month period to develop broad first-hand knowledge and experience in different terrains, weather, and situations (and differing gear). Those who graduate (less than 10%) are awarded the Sage Beret (with insignia pin), SERE Arch and SERE Flash - only to enter another 45 weeks of intensive on-the-job training. At some point, graduates must complete Airborne School. After completion of three-four years as a \\"Field Instructor\\", Specialists may be tasked to train students worldwide. USAF SERE Specialists must complete an associate degree in Survival and Rescue Sciences through the USAF Community College in order to continue to advance in the SERE career field. (SERE Specialists complete additional qualification training at specialized schools as required. Examples are Scuba Courses, Military Freefall Parachuting, Altitude chamber, etc. Assignment to each of the outlying schools requires additional training by the SERE Specialist. Upon reporting to the new assignment, each SERE Specialist must first complete that school's course (the same as an Aircrew member), and then be trained by the school's cadre in the specialized subject matter (and carry crews under supervision) before the newly assigned Specialist is \\"qualified\\" to teach without supervision. At Edwards AFB, USAF SERE Specialists are tasked as \\"Test Parachutists\\" and required to perform multiple jumps on newly introduced / modified rescue systems, aircraft, and parachuting and / or ejection systems. This includes test parachuting newly designed canopies, harnesses, etc. Currently, they are the only Test Parachutists in the Department of Defense. USAF SERE Specialists are considered DOD-wide subject matter experts in their field and are assigned to base level and command staff as advisers).SERE Specialists showcase training for recruits, AF.mil, by 1st Lt Kayshel Trudell, dated June 14, 2019, last accessed September 8, 2019 # Combat Survival Training (CST) taught by the 22nd TS at the Air Force Academy (AFA) in Colorado. Since 2011, this program has been significantly reduced (following problems and controversies detailed below). With most Academy graduates now required to attend the SV-80-A course at Fairchild, the AFA program is limited to some survival and Level B Code of Conduct training. ===Marine Corps=== \\"Preserving the lives and well-being of U.S. military, Department of Defense (DoD) civilians, and DoD contractors authorized to accompany the force (CAAF) who are in danger of becoming, or already are beleaguered, besieged, captured, detained, interned, or, otherwise missing or evading capture (hereafter referred to as \\"isolated\\") while participating in U.S.-sponsored activities or missions, is one of the highest priorities of the DoD. The DoD has an obligation to train, equip, and protect its personnel, to prevent their capture and exploitation by adversaries, and to reduce the potential for the use of isolated personnel as leverage against U.S. security objectives. Personnel Recovery (PR) is the sum of military, diplomatic, and civil efforts to prepare for and execute the recovery and reintegration of isolated personnel.\\" MSGID/GENADMIN/CG MCCDC QUANTICO VA REF/A/DODI O-3002.05//REF/B/CJCSM 3500.09//REF/C/MCO 3460.3 MARADMINS Number: 286/18 May 23, 2018 announcing that \\"Training and Education Command (TECOM) in a joint effort with U.S. Army Forces Command, and with the assistance of the Joint Personal Recovery Agency, has developed a SERE Level A Training Support Package (TSP) that enables deploying units to self-train SERE Level A in an instructor guided group setting.\\" The U.S. Marine Corps operates jointly with the Navy and cooperatively with the other branches in much of its SERE training, but operates its own Level C course at the Full Spectrum SERE Course, U.S. Marines Special Operations School (MSOS), Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Marine Spec Ops often train with Navy Spec Ops and utilize Navy training when it fits their needs and there is no equivalent USMC course. The Corps like to stand apart and have their own specifications for required \\"Code of Conduct\\" training: Level A is taught to recruits and candidates in Officer Candidate School and the Recruit Depots, or under professional military education (but note the JPRA note above). Level B is taught at the Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center, Bridgeport, California, and at the North Training Area, Camp Gonsalves, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. Level C is held at Camp Lejeune, as above, although some Marine personnel are trained at the Navy facilities listed above. USMC courses or training with survival focus include: # Full Spectrum SERE Training taught by the MARSOC Personnel Recovery (PR)/ SERE Branch at Camp Lejeune provides 19 days of full spectrum Level C SERE training to MARSOC personnel encompassing Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) to plan for evasion, effect personnel recovery, survive and evade capture in austere environments and resist exploitation appropriately, in accordance with the Code of Conduct, should they become captured or detained. The training consists of classroom academic instruction, vicarious learning evolutions consisting of Academic Role-Play Laboratories (ARL), field survival exercises, an evasion exercise, experiential resistance training laboratories (RTL), an urban movement phase and a course debrief. # Mountain Warfare Training Center (MWTC) at Pickel Meadows in the Toiyabe National Forest (~20 miles northwest of Bridgeport, California) offers \\"specialized training in technical climbing, military mountaineering, snow mobility, field craft, survival, CASEVAC, navigation, use of pack animals and high angle marksmanship. Medical challenges include treatment of high altitude and cold weather illness and injuries, and casualty transport in a snow covered mountainous environment.\\" # Special Operations Training Course (SOTC) is taught at the Marine Raider Training Center (MRTC) at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina in four phases under the general title Individual Training Course (ITC). The entire course includes six months of unhindered, realistic, challenging basic and intermediate Special Operations Forces (SOF) war fighting skills training. In the ten-week Phase I portion, Marines learn basic Spec Ops skills including SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape), TCCC (Tactical Combat Casualty Care), fire support training and communications. Survivability is a focus in all phases of the ITC course. # Jungle Warfare Training Center (JWTC) offers various courses taught by the 3d Marine Division at Camp Gonsalves, Okinawa, Japan. The skills, leaders, and endurance courses intend to teach Marines the skills they need should they become separated from their units in a combat zone and must survive off the land while evading the enemy. The Jungle Tracking, Trauma, and Medicine Courses have more specific goals. The rigorous eight-day Basic Skills Course teaches skills such as first aid, communication, booby traps, knot tying, rappelling, and land navigation. Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape training (SERE) is conducted monthly - a 12-day course, 3 days of classroom learning of the basics of survival (how to identify and catch food, build tools, start fires and construct shelter), 5 days on a beach where the Marines survive on their own (with nothing but a knife, a canteen and the uniforms on their backs), and 4 days of \\"team\\" evasion through the muddy and tangled jungle (to avoid being captured by students from the man-tracking course). Captured student get placed into an improvised POW camp and the instructors interrogate them to test their \\"resistance\\" skills. Marines often participate in \\"exercises\\" and some of them have a survival focus. ==ControversiesAmerican Use of \\"SERE Techniques\\" in \\"Detainee\\" Interrogation/Torture=== redacted US Department of Defense memo discussing SERE techniques used at Guant√°namo \\"The U.S. government torture program since 9/11 has been \\"breathtaking\\" in its scope, according to the detailed report submitted to the United Nations Committee Against Torture by the International Human Rights Clinic at Harvard Law School and other human rights activists.\\" Torture and the United States - \\"Torture, interrogation and prisons in the War on Terror\\" (See Main articles: Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse, Bagram torture and prisoner abuse, Criticisms of the War on Terrorism, Enhanced interrogation techniques, and Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture). That Americans used \\"stress and duress\\" (and worse) techniques to humiliate and interrogate captives after 9/11 is now beyond cavil. While some may claim that such did not constitute \\"torture\\" and others may claim that torture was necessary to prevent deaths, those arguments are well refuted elsewhere. What cannot be overstated is the impact of President George W. Bush's declaration (February 5, 2002) that the Geneva Convention(s) regarding POWs did not apply to the conflict with al-Qaida or the Taliban as those prisoners were not entitled to POW status or those legal guarantees of humane treatment. To soldiers who are legally required to follow the directives of their Commander- in-Chief, this not only excused harsh techniques, it made them essentially mandatory. (A soldier's claim that this was an \\"unlawful order\\" would be a difficult defense because the legal definition of torture - \\"intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering\\" - is less than resolved. The intent is hard to prove and the meaning of \\"severe\\" in this application is debated).https://www.justice.gov/file/18791/downloadhttps://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1068&context;=lsrp_papers \\"SERE\\"?

The article also stated that physical and mental techniques used against some detainees at Abu Ghraib are similar to the ones SERE students are taught to resist. According to Human Rights First, the interrogation that led to the death of Iraqi Major General Abed Hamed Mowhoush involved the use of techniques used in SERE training.

On June 17, 2008, Mark Mazzetti of The New York Times reported that the senior Pentagon lawyer Mark Schiffrin requested information in 2002 from the leaders of the Air Force's captivity-resistance program, referring to one based in Fort Belvoir, Virginia. The information was later used on prisoners in military custody.Mark Mazzetti. \\"Ex-Pentagon Lawyers Face Inquiry on Interrogation Role\\". The New York Times, June 17, 2008. In written testimony to the Senate Armed Forces Committee hearing, Col. Steven Kleinman of the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency said a team of trainers whom he was leading in Iraq were asked to demonstrate SERE techniques on uncooperative prisoners. He refused, but his decision was overruled. He was quoted as saying \\"When presented with the choice of getting smarter or getting tougher, we chose the latter.\\"Kleinman, Steven. \\"Officer: Military Demanded Torture Lessons\\". CBS News, July 25, 2008. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has acknowledged that the use of the SERE program techniques to conduct interrogations in Iraq was discussed by senior White House officials in 2002 and 2003.Rice, Condoleezza (September 26, 2008). \\"Rice admits Bush officials held White House talks on CIA interrogations\\". Los Angeles Times. It has been subsequently confirmed that in 2002 JPRA was asked by the CIA to provide advisors on topics such as \\"deprivation techniques... exploitation and questioning techniques, and developing countermeasures to resistance techniques\\". What has never been revealed is who the JPRA instructors actually were, but almost every source continues to deem them \\"SERE instructors\\". JPRA is not SERE and many of its resistance training instructors are not SERE instructors (they are from the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency). The techniques they taught the CIA are not SERE resistance training methods (although they are related) - they are the work product of Bruce Jessen and James Elmer Mitchell. For example, \\"waterboarding\\" (probably the most controversial of the \\"enhanced interrogation techniques\\" proposed by Jessen and Mitchell) has never been used in resistance training as part of Air Force SERE training and therefore, neither psychologist had any experience with it. (Simulated waterboarding had been used in SERE training in other branches until 2007). While \\"Resistance\\" is clearly part of SERE training, not all resistance training is part of SERE. The SERE community is about TRAINING and, within SERE, \\"Resistance\\" is about teaching others methods and techniques to help them deal with captivity and avoid exploitation. SERE instructors use \\"role-playing\\" exercises to allow students to experience simulated abuse, stress, and exploitation as might be expected if captured. Interrogation is something captives should expect and SERE instructors role- play as interrogators. While this means that such instructors must know how real interrogations might be conducted, their RT training focuses on effective role-playing in a VERY tightly controlled environment. Col. Steven Kleinman, a top intelligence officer at Fairchild AFB who was named the director of intelligence for JPRA in 2004, calls the \\"mistaking of role-playing resistance training as a basis for actual interrogations\\" a \\"critical disconnect\\" in the misinformation Jessen and Mitchell were \\"selling\\" to the CIA. When Col. Kleinman was ordered by the commander of JPRA to teach non-SERE soldiers the techniques that were used by role-playing \\"interrogators\\" in resistance training at SERE schools, he refused. (Note: Col. Kleinman was NOT a SERE officer, he was an \\"ISR\\" Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency officer).\\"Fairchild's torture ties extend their reach\\". www.spokesman.com. Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture On December 9, 2014, the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a report (\\"SASC report\\", hereafter) which detailed how contractors who developed the \\"enhanced interrogation techniques\\" used by U.S. personnel received 81 million for their services and identified the contractors, who were referred to in the report via pseudonyms, as principals in Mitchell, Jessen & Associates from Spokane, Washington. Two of them were psychologists, John \\"Bruce\\" Jessen and James Mitchell. Jessen was a senior psychologist at the Defense Department who had worked with Army special forces in resistance training. The report states that the contractor \\"developed the list of enhanced interrogation techniques and personally conducted interrogations of some of the CIA's most significant detainees using those techniques. The contractors also evaluated whether the detainees' psychological state allowed for continued use of the techniques, even for some detainees they themselves were interrogating or had interrogated.\\" Mitchell, Jessen & Associates developed a \\"menu\\" of 20 potential enhanced techniques including waterboarding, sleep deprivation and stress positions.See also: Report of the Office of the Inspector General (OIG): \\"Review of DoD-Directed Investigations of Detainee Abuse\\" (2006) at https://media.defense.gov/2016/May/19/2001774103/-1/-1/1/06-INTEL-10.pdf. Over the six years following their hiring by friends at the CIA (Kirk Hubbard), Mitchell, Jessen & Associates would hire over 100 staff, bill the CIA for over $80,000,000, and lead the American military (and other parts of the government) into perhaps their greatest PR (public relations) fiasco. When 60 Minutes aired pictures from Abu Ghraib in May 2004, the shock was \\"heard around the world\\". Americans (for the most part) began hearing of \\"SERE\\" for the first time and still hear it today as more and more information about American torture becomes known. While Mitchell, Jessen & Associates hired ex-\\"SERE instructors\\" we don't know how many, if any, were actually \\"SERE\\", how many were private contractors who used the title \\"SERE Instructor\\", how many were CIA that called themselves \\"SERE interrogators\\" merely because they used Mitchell's and Jessen's stolen (classified) library materials that have been repeatedly misrepresented as \\"SERE\\" training techniques\\".In sworn depositions, Mitchell states unequivocally and repeatedly that he didn't \\"design\\" or \\"develop\\" the North Korean/Chinese/Vietnamese techniques that he sold to the CIA (which became the basis for the \\"enhanced interrogation techniques\\").

Now known as The Grand at VIA Villa. The International ‚Äì Great Northern Railroad (I&GN;) was a railroad that operated in the U.S. state of Texas. It was created on September 30, 1873, when International Railroad and the Houston and Great Northern Railroad merged. The railroad was officially incorporated as the International & Great Northern Railroad Company. Originally, the I&GN; operated of track from Hearne to Longview, but at its peak it owned of track. As the railroad expanded southwestwards from Hearne, it reached Rockdale in 1874 and Austin on December 28, 1876. The line extended to San Antonio in 1880 and finally to the US-Mexican border town of Laredo on December 1, 1881. The I&GN;, like other railroads of its time, had many financial troubles and went into receivership on several occasions. Jay Gould acquired control of the I&GN; in December 1880. Due to his control of the Missouri Pacific (Mopac) and the Texas and Pacific Railroad, the three were operated as one system, although they each retained their separate corporate identities and seniority districts. Due to financial difficulties stemming in part from the Panic of 1907, the I-GN entered receivership in 1908 and was sold at foreclosure to a reorganized company, the International & Great Northern Railway Company on August 31, 1911. Less than four years later, the company entered receivership again, which lasted until it was sold at foreclosure in July 1922. The International‚ÄìGreat Northern Railroad was incorporated by the state of Texas on August 17, 1922, and fully took over operation of the International & Great Northern Railway on December 31, 1922. In a bit of planned corporate maneuvering to keep the I-GN within the Mopac fold, the Gulf Coast Lines subsidiary, New Orleans, Texas and Mexico Railway, bought the I-GN on June 30, 1924; subsequently, the Gulf Coast Lines were bought by the Missouri Pacific on January 1, 1925. Finally, on March 1, 1956, all of the GCL subsidiaries were merged into the parent Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, and the I-GN ceased its corporate existence. In the 1960s, many of the redundant out-of- the-way lines were abandoned, including Waco to Marlin and Bryan to Navasota. The latter route was subsequently traversed via trackage rights over the Southern Pacific Railroad between the same two points. The Missouri Pacific was merged into the Union Pacific Railroad in 1997. ==ReferencesZoomable system map of the I-GN from an 1877 promotional brochure Category:Defunct Texas railroads Category:Predecessors of the Missouri Pacific Railroad Category:Former Class I railroads in the United States Category:Railway companies established in 1922 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1956 ","title":"International‚ÄìGreat Northern Railroad"},{"id":"2203540","text":"The Bad Breed was the professional wrestling tag team of Axl Rotten with his storyline brother/real life prot√©g√© Ian Rotten. The team achieved their greatest fame in the Philadelphia professional wrestling promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling but has also competed in the Global Wrestling Federation and Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South. ==HistoryGlobal Wrestling Federation=== The storyline brothers Axl and Ian Rotten first started to team as the Bad Breed in the Global Wrestling Federation (GWF) in 1992. On January 29, 1993 Axl and Ian defeated the Texas Mustangs (Bobby Duncum, Jr. and John Hawk aka. JBL) to win the GWF Tag Team Championship. Their run with the GWF gold did not last long as they were defeated less than a month later by The Ebony Experience (Booker T and Stevie Ray), and they left the promotion soon after. ===Extreme Championship Wrestling=== In October that same year the Rotten ‚ÄùBrothers‚Äù made their debut for a relatively new promotion in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania then known as Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW). In their debut they defeated the makeshift team of Chad Austin and Todd Shawn at NWA Bloodfest: Part 1 on October 1, but lost to Badd Company (Pat Tanaka and Paul Diamond) less than 2 hours later. The next night they main evented the show in a loss to Public Enemy in a \\"Three Way Steel Cage Match\\" (third team was Badd Company). A few weeks later Bad Breed unsuccessfully challenged for the ECW Tag Team Championship as they lost to champions Tony Stetson and Johnny Hotbody. Bad Breed gained a measure of revenge by defeating Stetson and Hotbody on November 12 in a non-title match. In June 1994, Bad Breed started a feud with Public Enemy over the ECW Tag Team Title, but throughout the feud Bad Breed was never able to defeat Public Enemy for the gold. After feuding with Public Enemy the Rottens next targeted The Pitbulls, this feud led to the two teams facing off at November to Remember in a match where the losing team was forced to split up. Bad Breed lost when Pittbull #2 pinned Ian. Since the brothers both blamed each other for the loss, they began a feud against one another after teaming together for two years. The first match between the two ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù was at ‚ÄúDouble Tables‚Äù on February 4, 1995 which Ian won. They next clashed in a ‚ÄúHair vs Hair‚Äù match on the April 8 show Three Way Dance. After being shaved bald Ian came looking for revenge at Hostile City Showdown only a week later, this time in a ‚ÄúBarbedwire Baseball Bat‚Äù match, but once again Axl beat his ‚Äúbrother‚Äù. Their final match took place at Hardcore Heaven in a Taipei Death match. ===Reunions=== Axl and Ian Rotten would reunite in 2002 where the duo won the IWA Mid-South Tag Team Championship on March 2, but Axl would not be around long enough to see the team lose the belts, which forced Necro Butcher to team with Ian as they lost the titles on April 5. The Bad Breed reunited at Hardcore Homecoming on June 10, 2005, when they took on the reunion of The Gangstinators in an \\"ECW fight\\" (an un-sanctioned match where there are no rules, only a fight until there is one man or team standing). On the heels of their success at Hardcore Homecoming, Bad Breed once again teamed up in IWA Mid-South to win the IWA Mid-South tag team title from Vito and Sal Thomaselli, but were forced to vacate the titles when Ian suffered a concussion and had to take time off. ==Championships and accomplishments== *Global Wrestling Federation **GWF Tag Team Championship (1 time) *Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South **IWA Mid-South Tag Team Championship (2 times) ==References== Category:Extreme Championship Wrestling teams and stables Category:Independent promotions teams and stables ","title":"The Bad Breed"},{"id":"2203555","text":"The helminth Spinochordodes parasitising a bush-cricket (Meconema sp.)

Six more Sunderlands were converted for transport use in 1943, with a further 12 following in 1944.Barnes 1967, pp. 398‚Äì399.London 2003, pp. 203‚Äì204. Following the end of the Second World War, BOAC converted its Sunderlands to a less-austere standard, more suitable for peace-time operations, and known as the \\"Hythe\\". The primitive bench seats were removed, with seats fitted for sixteen passengers on one deck in the initial H.1 configuration, with the addition of a promenade deck giving the H.2 configuration, while the H.3 layout had an additional eight seats. of mail could be carried. Engines were standardised as the Bristol Pegasus 38.Jackson 1988, p. 152.London 2003, p. 215. In November 1945, Shorts flew a further refined conversion of one of BOAC's Sunderlands from their Rochester works, with revised low-drag fairings on the aircraft's nose and tail, and a refurbished interior, which was known as the Sandringham. All the Sandringhams were civil conversions of former Royal Air Force Coastal Command Short Sunderlands. The first prototype retained the Pegasus engines of the Sunderland III and Hythe, and was designated the Sandringham 1 by Shorts, but later Sandringhams, converted by Short and Harland Ltd at Belfast Harbour, were based on the Sunderland V, and were powered by Pratt & Whitney \\"Twin Wasp\\" engines. In 1963 an additional conversion of a former Royal New Zealand Air Force Sunderland V was carried out by Ansett to a similar standard to the Sandringhams. The aircraft, named Islander, was fitted with a 43-seat interior.London 2003, p. 226. ==Operational use== Short Sandringham 5 G-AHZE of BOAC at Hamworthy Quay, Poole, Dorset in September 1954 Rose Bay Sydney in 1970 The converted Sunderlands commenced operations with BOAC on the Poole Harbour, Dorset and Lagos, Nigeria in March 1943.Barnes 1967, p. 398. Following a proving flight to British India, the Sunderlands were transferred in October 1943 to flights between Poole and Karachi, via Gibraltar and Cairo. As Egypt was under military control, the aircraft were given military serial numbers and operated as part of RAF Transport Command.London 2003, p. 204. The service was extended to Calcutta in May 1944, while VE-Day, the end of the war in Europe, allowed the aircraft reverted to BOAC control. They continued on the India route, which was extended again to Rangoon in Burma following VJ- Day.Barnes 1967, p. 399. BOAC's Hythes took on flights to Australia in 1946, starting flying the Poole‚ÄìSydney route in conjunction with Qantas on 12 May 1946. In August that year, BOAC's Hythes were also deployed on services to Hong Kong on what was known as the Dragon route.Barnes 1967, p. 400. The Sandringham 5 was operated by BOAC from 1947 as the \\"Plymouth class\\" on the Far East routes from Southampton via Alexandria to Hong Kong and Tokyo. These were replaced by Lockheed Constellation land planes during 1949. TEAL used Sandringhams on the Auckland to Sydney route and flights to Pacific Islands. In 1950, Qantas introduced the first of five aircraft which flew from the Rose Bay flying boat base on Sydney Harbour to destinations in New Caledonia, New Hebrides, Fiji, New Guinea and Lord Howe Island. Two of these were purchased from TEAL and the other three were purchased from BOAC. These were in service through to 1955. The type was used by Ansett Flying Boat Services on the Sydney (Rose Bay) to Lord Howe Island scheduled service until 1974. One of Ansett's Sandringhams was converted from a S-25 Sunderland previously owned by the Royal New Zealand Air Force. It was also used in Norway by DNL ‚Äì Norwegian Airlines 1946‚Äì1952 on the domestic service from Oslo to Troms√∏, and in Uruguay by Compa√±√≠a Aeron√°utica Uruguaya S.A. (CAUSA) on the passenger services between Montevideo and Buenos Aires (1950‚Äì1962). In October 1954, Captain Sir Gordon Taylor flew his newly acquired Sandringham 7 from the UK to Australia to begin a series of flying boat cruises of the south Pacific. The aircraft later passed to R√©seau A√©rien Interinsulaire in Tahiti and is now stored at the Mus√©e de l'Air et de l'Espace at Paris Le Bourget. One of the last operators of the Sandringham was Antilles Air Boats in the Virgin Islands of the Caribbean which flew the aircraft in scheduled passenger service during the 1970s with flights from the Charlotte Amalie Harbor Seaplane Base on St. Thomas and the Christiansted Harbor Seaplane Base on St. Croix among other destinations.http://www.airliners.net, photos of Antilles Air Boats Short Sandringham in the U.S. Virgin Islands ==Variants== ;Hythe :Modification of Sunderland III for BOAC, with seats for 16‚Äì24 passengers. 23 converted.London 2003, pp. 278‚Äì279, 281. ;Sandringham 1 :Full civil conversion of Sunderland 3 for BOAC, accommodating 24 day or 16 sleeper passengers, and powered by four 1,030 hp (768 kW) Bristol Pegasus 38 engines.

In the BBC film adaptation (2000), Fuchsia is portrayed by Scottish actress Neve McIntosh. Fuchsia is also the subject of The Cure song \\"The Drowning Man\\", which is about her death and mentions her by name. ==Early life and family== Fuchsia is the first child of the Earl of Groan and his Countess; but the earldom of Groan and the family seat Gormenghast can only be inherited by a son. Consequently, Fuchsia has been largely ignored by both parents; and she spends most of her time with Nannie Slagg. While Fuchsia cares for Nannie Slagg deeply, she also delights in tormenting the old woman with childish antics and pranks. When Fuchsia is about fifteen, an heir-apparent is finally born. Like many firstborns, Fuchsia is angry that her parents are having another baby and determines to hate her brother or sister. After his naming ceremony, Fuchsia expresses delight that Titus was dropped on his head. Over time, however, the two grow very close. When Titus is twelve, he is imprisoned by his mother and his schoolmaster for repeated questioning and disobedience; and Fuchsia is the only one to visit or talk to him. ==Appearance and personality== The novel describes Fuchsia as \\"a girl of about fifteen with long, rather wild black hair. She was gauche in movement and in a sense ugly of face, but with how small a twist might she not suddenly have become beautiful. Her sullen mouth was full and rich ‚Äì her eyes smoldered\\". Fuchsia is a dreamer and a romantic, who escapes the dull pace of life in Gormenghast by reading fantasy tales. She frequently disappears into her secret attic rooms to fantasize and sulk. She scrawls on walls with charcoal and makes such wild claims as \\"[W]hen I am Queen, I am going to burn down the castle!\\", which upsets the aged Nannie Slagg. Lady Fuchsia Groan will never become Queen; but her fantasies of romance and adventure seem to keep her forever young. She responds to everything with childlike enthusiasm; and, beneath her callous and bratty exterior, she is sweet and loving. She loves her father, though she barely knows him; and, during his slow descent into madness, she often says she \\"cannot bear\\" to see him this way. She also has an enduring friendship with Dr. Alfred Prunesquallor, the Gormenghast physician. What Fuchsia seems to want most is someone to love her. Actress Neve McIntosh said of the character, \\"She locks herself in her attic where she lives in her imagination. All she wants is a knight in shining armor to come up to the castle tower and carry her off.\\"Fuchsia, PBS.org Fuchsia's favorite drink is elderberry wine.The Gormenghast Trilogy by Mervyn Peake\\", The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Earth Edition ==Fuchsia and Steerpike== Steerpike takes advantage of Fuchsia's romantic soul by convincing the lonely young woman that he is an adventurer. Fuchsia herself is initially disgusted by Steerpike's grubby appearance, but she is then awed when he tells her of an enigmatic \\"pavement in the sky\\". He uses her to quickly find himself work as Dr. Prunesquallor's manservant and dispensary clerk. Over the course of the novels, Fuchsia falls in love with Steerpike. She is attracted by his swashbuckling persona and by the fact that he is different from anyone else she has ever met. It is possible that Fuchsia also loves what Steerpike represents: the possibility for change. Since Steerpike himself started out as a lowly kitchen boy and advanced upwards through the society of Gormenghast, perhaps it is also possible for Fuchsia to change her own destiny. Unbeknownst to Fuchsia, Steerpike is responsible for the death of her father, an event that saddens the young woman deeply and adds to her feeling of being utterly alone. Ultimately, the pair's love affair is doomed to fail. Fuchsia finally realizes that Steerpike is \\"evil\\" and untrustworthy, and is frightened by his lust for power. While the television series portrays Steerpike as begging Fuchsia for shelter even after he has been revealed as a criminal (a request for assistance that she rejects), there is no corresponding scene in the novel. Fuchsia's death, in chapter 75, is precipitated by \\"mounting melancholia\\" brought on by the revelation that she had loved a murderer. This eventually leads her to a situation in which she finds herself standing perilously on a windowsill above the waters that had flooded the castle. Disturbed by someone knocking at the door, she slips and, knocked unconscious by her head striking the windowsill, drowns. While nothing indicates Steerpike's involvement as an immediate cause of her death (he indirectly contributed by disturbing her always fragile mental equilibrium), Titus, upon hearing of her death, immediately blames Steerpike for it (chapter 76) and swears to kill him. Fuchsia was buried on Gormenghast Mountain, at a site overlooking the castle chosen by her mother, in a ceremony at which neither her brother the Earl, recovering as he was from the severe fever that followed his killing of Steerpike, nor Dr. Prunesquallor, who was caring for the Earl, could attend. It was immediately after a visit to her grave that Titus decided to abandon his hereditary responsibilities and go out into the world. In Titus Alone, Fuchsia is one of the characters from the earlier novels mocked by Cheeta in the nightmarish scene that she puts on in the Black House (chapter 105). ==References== Category:Fictional counts and countesses Category:Literary characters introduced in 1946 Category:Gormenghast Category:Characters in British novels of the 20th century ","title":"Lady Fuchsia Groan"},{"id":"2203595","text":"Dr. Antonio S. Pedreira (June 13, 1899 ‚Äì October 23, 1939), was a Puerto Rican author and educator. ==Early years== Pedreira (whose full name was Antonio Salvador Pedreira Pizarro) was born into a well-to-do family in San Juan. His father was a Spaniard, and his mother was Puerto Rican. Both died when he was quite young, and he was thereafter raised by his godparents in Caguas. He became interested in the art of writing stories as a child during his primary and secondary school years. He attended the University of Puerto Rico after graduating from high school and earned his teachers certificate.El Nuevo Dia ==Nationalist== In 1920, Pedreira traveled to New York City with the intention of becoming a medical doctor and enrolled in the school of medicine of Columbia University in that city. He was exposed to the realities of racial discrimination, which was rampant in the city at that time, during his brief stay. This was one of the many factors which influenced Pedreira decision to join the Puerto Rican Nationalist movement while at the same time becoming an open advocate for Puerto Rico's independence. He dropped out of medical school because of financial problems and returned to Puerto Rico. In Puerto Rico, he was granted a scholarship by the government and attended the University of Puerto Rico once again. In 1925, Pedreira earned a Bachelor of Arts degree. He continued his higher education and in 1928 earned a master's degree in Letters. Pedreria then moved to Spain to pursue a doctorate in Philosophy and Letters at the Central University of Madrid, which he earned in 1932. He returned to his homeland upon graduation.Biograf√≠as de Escritores Puertorrique√±os ==Author== Pedreira held the position of professor of Spanish literature at both the University of Puerto Rico and Columbia University. Eventually, the University of Puerto Rico named him Director of the Department of Hispanic Studies. Pedreira believed that Puerto Rico was in danger of losing its cultural identity and expressed his beliefs in a daily column titled \\"Aclaraciones y cr√≠ticas\\" (Clarification and criticism), published in El Mundo newspaper. He also founded and co-edited a magazine that went by the title \\"Indice\\". A handful of scholars have studied the work of Eugenio Mar√≠a de Hostos as he did.Perfiles puertorrique√±os, by Wilfredo Braschi Garc√≠a, pg. 55. ==Insularismo== In 1934, Pedreira authored his most important book, Insularismo, in which he explores the meaning of being Puerto Rican. This includes an in-depth study of the intertwining of the Spanish, Taino and African cultures. In his book he also talks about the cultural survival of the Puerto Rican identity after the island was invaded by the United States.Ausubo Press ==Written works== Other works by Pedreira are: * Artistas (1930) * Hostos, ciudadano de Am√©rica (1932) * La actualidad del j√≠baro (1935) * El a√±o terrible del 87' (1937) ==Aftermath== Dr. Antonio S. Pedreira died of pneumonia on October 23, 1939, in San Juan. Puerto Rico has honored his memory by naming a school and a main avenue with his name. He was an active member of Phi Eta Mu fraternity, besides that, other associations recognized his importance in the Puerto Rican culture. The best example is that starting in 1940, Phi Sigma Alpha fraternity gave the annual \\"Premio Antonio S.

MIT Press published the first edition in 2001, and the second edition in 2018, which is freely available online and in print. The book introduces the concept of a design recipe, a six-step process for creating programs from a problem statement. While the book was originally used along with the education project TeachScheme! (renamed ProgramByDesign), it has been adopted at many colleges and universities for teaching program design principles. According to HtDP, the design process starts with a careful analysis of a problem statement with the goal of extracting a rigorous description of the kinds of data that the desired program consumes and produces. The structure of these data descriptions determines the organization of the program. Then, the book carefully introduces data forms of progressively growing complexity. It starts with data of atomic forms and then progresses to compound forms, including data that can be arbitrarily large. For each kind of data definition, the book explains how to organize the program in principle, thus enabling a programmer who encounters a new form of data to still construct a program systematically. Like Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP), HtDP relies on a variant of the programming language Scheme. It includes its own programming integrated development environment (IDE), named DrRacket, which provides a series of programming languages. The first language supports only functions, atomic data, and simple structures. Each language adds expressive power to the prior one. Except for the largest teaching language, all languages for HtDP are functional programming languages. In the 2004 paper, The Structure and Interpretation of the Computer Science Curriculum, a paper in which the authors compare and contrast HtDP with SICP. the authors distinguish the pedagogic focus of HtDP from that of SICP, and show how HtDP was designed as a textbook to address some problems that some students and teachers had with SICP. == Use in postsecondary education == Many colleges and schools have used HtDP in their classes, including: * University of Chicago, Chicago IL, United States * Northwestern University, Evanston IL, United States * Suffolk County Community College, (Ammerman Campus) Selden NY, United States * Adelphi University, Garden City NY, United States * University of California, Irvine, Irvine CA, United States * California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, CA, United States * Northeastern University, Boston MA, United States * Seton Hall University, South Orange NJ, United States * University of Delaware, Newark DE, United States * Westmont College, Santa Barbara CA, United States * Vassar College, Poughkeepsie NY, United States * Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester MA, United States * University of Notre Dame, South Bend IN, United States * University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada * National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), Mexico * Rhode Island College, Providence RI, United States * Pacific Union College, Angwin CA, United States * University of T√ºbingen, T√ºbingen, Germany * University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany * University of Dallas, Irving TX, United States * Indiana University, Bloomington IN, United States * Istanbul Bilgi University, Istanbul, Turkey * South Carolina State University, Orangeburg SC, United States * Berry College, Rome GA, United States * Monmouth College, Monmouth IL, United States * Manhattanville College, Purchase NY, United States * University of Minnesota, Morris, United States * University of British Columbia, Canada * Brown University, Providence RI, United States * Zefat Academic College, Israel * University of Chile, Chile * Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil == References == == External links == * , 2018 2nd edition, 2003 1st edition Category:2001 non-fiction books Category:Computer science books Category:MIT Press books ","title":"How to Design Programs"},{"id":"2203606","text":" The Short S.45 Seaford was a 1940s flying boat, designed as a long range maritime patrol bomber for RAF Coastal Command. It was developed from the Short S.25 Sunderland, and initially ordered as \\"Sunderland Mark IV\\". ==Background== In 1942, the Air Ministry issued Specification R.8/42 for a replacement of the Sunderland, as a long range patrol bomber for service in the Pacific Ocean. It required more powerful engines, better defensive armament, and other enhancements.Barnes 1989, pp. 357Green 1968, p. 106. ==Design and development== The Sunderland Mark IV used major structural elements of the Sunderland Mark III, with a fuselage stretch of 3 ft ahead of the wing, an extended and redesigned planing bottom, the same wing with thicker Duralumin skinning, and Bristol Hercules engines. Further structural changes were made after initial flight tests. The planned armament consisted of two fixed forward-firing .303 inch (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns in the nose, a Brockhouse Engineering nose turret with twin .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns, twin 20 mm Hispano cannon mounted in a Bristol B.17 dorsal turret, twin .50 in (12.7 mm) guns in a Glenn-Martin tail turret, and another .50 in (12.7 mm) machine gun in a hand-held waist position on each side of the fuselage. The turrets were all electrically powered. Two prototypes and thirty production aircraft were ordered as the Sunderland Mark IV. ==Operational history== thumb On 30 August 1944, the prototype (MZ269) first flew from the River Medway at Rochester. The increased engine power caused aerodynamic stability problems, and a new fin was designed with greater height with forward dorsal extension, plus a new tailplane with increased span and area.Barnes 1967, p. 360. Changes were so extensive, that the new aircraft was given the name Seaford.London 2003, p. 196. Thirty production aircraft were ordered, but the first of these flew in April 1945, well after the introduction of the Sunderland Mark V, and too late to see combat in Europe. The prototypes were powered by Hercules XVII engines of 1,680 hp (1,253 kW), but production aircraft used 1,720 hp (1,283 kW) Hercules XIX engines. The planned Glenn Martin tail turrets were never installed. Eight production Seafords were completed; the first (NJ200) was used for trials at MAEE Felixstowe. The second production Seaford (NJ201) was evaluated by RAF Transport Command, then in December 1945 it was loaned without armament to BOAC as G-AGWU, then returned to MAEE as NJ201 in February 1946. In April 1946, the other six production Seafords were delivered to No. 201 Squadron RAF for brief operational trials. In 1948, those six aircraft were modified as civilian airliners at Belfast, then leased to BOAC with the designation Solent 3.Barnes 1989, pp. 360‚Äì363 ==Operators== ; *British Overseas Airways Corporation *Royal Air Force **No. 201 Squadron RAF ==Specifications (S.45 Seaford)== ==Survivor== Short S.45 Seaford NJ203 displayed at Oakland Aviation Museum, Oakland, California.Ogden (2007)\\"Short Solent\\" ==See also== ==Notes== ==Bibliography== * Barnes, C.H.

Just cause has become a common standard in labor arbitration, and is included in labor union contracts as a form of job security. Typically, an employer must prove just cause before an arbitrator in order to sustain an employee's termination, suspension, or other discipline. Usually, the employer has the burden of proof in discharge cases or if the employee is in the wrong. In the workplace, just cause is a burden of proof or standard that an employer must meet to justify discipline or discharge. Just cause usually refers to a violation of a company policy or rule. In some cases, an employee may commit an act that is not specifically addressed within the employers' policies but one of which the employer believes warrants discipline or discharge. In such instances, the employer must be confident that they can defend their decision. When an arbitrator looks at a discipline dispute, the arbitrator first asks whether the employee's wrongdoing has been proven by the employer, and then asks whether the method of discipline should be upheld or modified. In 1966, an arbitrator, Professor Carroll Daugherty, expanded these principles into seven tests for just cause.In re Enterprise Wire Co. and Enterprise Independent Union, 46 LA 359 (March 28, 1966). The concepts encompassed within his seven tests are still frequently used by arbitrators when deciding discipline cases. Daugherty's seven tests are as follows: * Was the employee forewarned of the consequences of his or her actions? * Are the employer's rules reasonably related to business efficiency and performance the employer might reasonably expect from the employee? * Was an effort made before discipline or discharge to determine whether the employee was guilty as charged? * Was the investigation conducted fairly and objectively? * Did the employer obtain substantial evidence of the employee's guilt? * Were the rules applied fairly and without discrimination? * Was the degree of discipline reasonably related to the seriousness of the employee's offense and the employee's past record? The last test, the degree of discipline, is important because arbitrators want to ensure that the \\"punishment fits the crime.\\" An employer's use of progressive discipline often gives the employer an advantage in arbitration. The culture of the community or community standards sometimes play an important role in how just cause is defined, especially if there are issues of immorality. What is accepted in an urban and liberal community may not be accepted in a rural and religiously conservative community. The courts or arbitrator who will rule on a challenge to the discipline may be a product of those communities. Just cause can become controversial in instances when the employers personnel policies do not address a specific act but the employer believes that just cause exists. For example, if an employee is arrested and charged with a misdemeanor, the employer may deem that sufficient cause for dismissal, even if the employee is not incarcerated or is not convicted. ==See also== *Dismissal (employment) ==Notes== Category:Termination of employment Category:Labor relations ","title":"Just cause"},{"id":"2203626","text":"Pleasant Hill/Contra Costa Centre is a Bay Area Rapid Transit station serving the Contra Costa Centre Transit Village in Contra Costa Centre, California, just north of Walnut Creek and just east of Pleasant Hill. ==History== Pleasant Hill station under construction in 1970 Service at Pleasant Hill station began on May 21, 1973.

Arlington was not part of the 1914-opened Boylston Street subway; its construction was delayed by World War I and the station opened in 1921. ==Station layout== A 1949 plan of the station Arlington station has two side platforms serving the two tracks of the Boylston Street subway, located under the east half of the block of Boylston Street between Arlington Street and Berkeley Street. A fare mezzanine is located under the intersection of Arlington Street and Boylston Street. The mezzanine is connected to the platforms with stairs, elevators, and exit-only escalators. Five stairway entrances are located around the mezzanine; another stairway and the surface elevator are located further west on the north side of Boylston Street, connected to the mezzanine by a passageway. A closed passageway formerly led to an entrance from the Public Garden. A smaller fare mezzanine is located at Berkeley Street and connected to the platforms with a long corridor. This entrance does not have elevators for accessibility and is not open in normal use. The MBTA plans to add elevators to the Berkeley Street lobby and reopen it as a full entrance. A design contract was awarded in April 2020. ==History== In late 2006, an old station sign was uncovered. The original mosaic was restored and incorporated into the new station wall. After the success of the original Tremont Street subway in 1897‚Äì1898, there was a push to extend the tunnel under Boylston Street towards Kenmore Square. During 1913 tunnel excavations near the present-day site of Arlington station, remains of ancient fish weirs built by Native Americans were found approximately below street level. Their age has been estimated as between 2,000 and 3,600 years. Businesses in the Back Bay neighborhood along Boylston Street between Clarendon and Tremont Streets became worried about loss of income due to being bypassed by an uninterrupted tunnel between Boylston and Copley stations, which was completed in 1914. They lobbied for an infill station near Arlington Street, but were rebuffed by the Boston Elevated Railway and the state legislature. In 1915, with the backing of Boston mayor James Michael Curley, they succeeded in getting legislative approval for a new underground station. After delays caused by World War I, Arlington station finally opened in 1921, and remained in continuous use through its first major renovation, in 1967. The Berkeley Street entrance was closed on January 3, 1981 as part of extensive cutbacks that including closing Bowdoin and Symphony. (second page) === 1960s renovations === The MBTA wanted to improve its graphic design in the early 1960s, so they hired Cambridge Seven Associates graphic designers to make it easier for people to understand. Arlington was used as their pilot project for testing modernization ideas, including the (T) \\"lollipop\\" sign, the colored walls and signage distinction between \\"inbound\\" vs \\"outbound\\", the high-contrast photographs on the walls, and the colored bands along the wall and above the entrances. At the platform level, the wall at the inbound end of the station was painted with \\"warm\\" colors red and orange, while the outbound end was painted with \\"cool\\" colors blue and green. The A dedication ceremony was held on August 17, 1968, with the renovation fully completed in 1968. A secondary name of Park Plaza, used on some station signage, was added in 1985 as part of a series of station name changes. ===2006‚Äì2009 renovations=== On November 22, 2006, the MBTA closed the Arlington Street entrance to the station to begin a major renovation of the station. Conducted in concert with similar changes to , the project added elevators and raised platforms to make the station accessible. The street elevator was placed in front of the Arlington Street Church along with a new set of stairs, and the northwest entrance was relocated. The 1981-closed Berkeley Street entrance was reopened for the duration of the project. On May 31, 2009, the renovated main entrances on Arlington Street reopened for public use; the Berkeley Street entrances were reverted to emergency-only exits. Panels of artwork were added to the station at the platform level. Designed by Ross Miller, these panels explain and celebrate the ancient Boylston Street Fishweir that had been discovered during excavations in the vicinity. ==References== ==External links== * MBTA - Arlington * Arlington Street entrance from Google Maps Street View Category:Green Line (MBTA) stations Category:Railway stations located underground in Boston Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1921 ","title":"Arlington station (MBTA)"},{"id":"2203639","text":"The Soul of a Man is a 2003 documentary film, directed by Wim Wenders, as the second instalment of the documentary film series The Blues, produced by Martin Scorsese.

He is best remembered for his role as Duncan Waring in the television comedy series Doctor in the House and its sequels; he also featured in other television series such as The Lovers, The Upchat Connection, The Climber and the ATV comedy-drama Shillingbury Tales. ==Biography== He was born in Birmingham, Warwickshire, England but moved with his family at an early age to Cardiff, Wales, where he was educated at Monkton House prep school. After leaving school he studied at University College, Cardiff and joined local theatre company, Everyman Theatre Cardiff, and then trained at the Central School of Speech and Drama studying Stage Acting.Anthony Hayward Obituary: Robin Nedwell, The Independent, 4 February 1999 Soon after finishing drama school he landed the role of Duncan Waring in the hugely popular British television comedy series Doctor in the House (1969‚Äì70).

Where the aqueduct crossed the lower lying areas around Wandin and approaching Mount Evelyn, it was in steel or wood-stave piping, converting to open concrete-lined channel when the higher levels were reached. It went through the township of Mount Evelyn in open channel (except for a short distance adjacent to the railway line) winding around the local contours to just above what is now Johns Crescent, then part of the 'Pine Mont Estate.' From this point, the aqueduct was again transferred to steel pipes to go under the Olinda Creek and Swansea Road to feed the Olinda Reservoir, in the Edinburgh Road area. This reservoir, now roofed over, was open to the skies. The pipes crossing the Olinda Creek valley cut across the Lilydale Water Race, so water was fed from the Aqueduct to the Race, the pipe creating the Race at the Cascades was cut away, and the section of the Race upstream fell into disuse. The part of the Race downstream to the small reservoir on Birmingham Road was lined with concrete. Mount Evelyn residents adjacent to the open channel were permitted to syphon water out of the channel for their own use. Those on the high side of the channel were only allowed to pump water where there was no possibility of drainage back into the open channel. One was the Pine Mont Guest House, where a windmill pumped water up to the house on top of a small hill, and the drainage went down the other side. This first aqueduct system, before later enlargement, had a capacity of 20,000,000 gallons (75 megalitres) per day. In 1917, following a severe drought, a site in Silvan was selected across the Stoneyford Creek (a tributary of Olinda Creek) for extra water storage for Melbourne. The four components of the 'Silvan Dam' were completed by 1933, and comprised: *The Silvan Reservoir (a major dam across Stoneyford Creek adjacent to Stoneyford Road and two small dams adjacent to McCarthy Road and adjacent to Monbulk Road) with a storage capacity of 40,000 megalitres, completed in 1932. An aerial ropeway was constructed from a special siding at Mount Evelyn railway station to the southwest end of the reservoir wall site, a distance of about 5 kilometres, to convey the sand and cement in 100 buckets needed for the wall construction. The railway siding was at the back of what is now Bowen's timber yard. *The Diversion Aqueduct, mainly open channel leading from the original O'Shannassy aqueduct near the Wandin Yallock Primary School to a tunnel under Silvan township, to feed water into the newly constructed Reservoir. *The Outlet Aqueduct from the Silvan Reservoir to feed water back into the existing system. Mainly open channel, becoming a concrete tunnel under Monbulk Road, surfacing near Ormeau Road and the (now) Melba Centre, there joining into the original Aqueduct. *An increase in capacity of the existing system downstream of the point of entry from Silvan Dam. Flow of water was maintained during the widening by using temporary pipeline which was mostly above ground and took short cuts instead of following surface contours. Generally, one side and the floor of the original concrete channel were removed, the channel was deepened and widened and then re-concreted. Where the original aqueduct was in pipe, an extra pipe was laid. The health concerns accompanying increases in population caused the open channels to be replaced by pipes to and from the Silvan Reservoir by the late 1960s. Enclosed pipes had no need to follow surface contours, and new shorter routes were adopted. ==References== * Chapter 38 of Tracks to Trails, a history of Mt Evelyn, paraphrased from Louise Hordern's pamphlet.

A toolbox (also called toolkit, tool chest or workbox) is a box to organize, carry, and protect the owner's tools. They could be used for trade, a hobby or DIY, and their contents vary with the craft of the owner. ==Types== Simple wooden toolbox A toolbox could refer to several types of storage to hold tools. It could mean a small portable box that can carry a few tools to a project location or a large storage system set on casters. Modern toolboxes are predominantly metal or plastic. Wood was the material of choice for toolboxes built beginning in the early 19th century. Toolboxes can be mainly divided as 5 types.https://www.sweethomespot.com/best-mechanics-tool-box They are: * Plastic * Steel * Aluminium * Waterproof * Cantilever Cantilever toolbox Small portable toolboxes are sometimes called hand boxes or portable tool storage. Most portable toolboxes have one handle on top and a lid that opens on a hinge. Many have a removable tote tray that sits on a flange inside the lip of the box, with a single larger compartment below. The tote tray helps organize smaller parts and accessories. Portable toolboxes sometimes use slide-out trays or cantilever trays in lieu of the removable tote tray. Metal toolboxes (typically steel) weigh more than plastic ones. A plastic toolbox laden with tools can weigh the same as a comparable steel box does when empty. Metal boxes are also subject to rusting and their sharp edges can mark the surfaces of things they are banged against. Metal is, however, known for being stronger than plastic, so one should balance its disadvantages against the need to withstand abuse and support the weight of many tools. Portable chest Portable chests are a type of tool storage that is small enough to carry, but has drawers to organize contents. Portable chests have a handle on top for portability and a top lid that opens on hinges. Portable chests typically have 3-4 drawers. Most are made from metal, but some have a plastic shell with metal drawers in order to help lighten the piece. A toolbox can also refer to a large tool storage system, or tool chest combos, that includes multiple pieces. These systems are almost always made from metal. Most tool storage systems are painted steel, but some are stainless steel and aluminum. They include a top chest that has drawers and a top lid that opens on a hinge. The top chest is designed to sit on a cabinet, also called a rolling cabinet (rollcab) or rollaway. The cabinet sits on four or more casters and has drawers to organize tools. Other pieces can be added to the system or combo. A middle chest, also called an intermediate chest, can be placed between the top chest and cabinet for extra storage. A side cabinet with more drawers can be hung from the side of a cabinet. A side locker can also be hung from the side of a cabinet; usually with a door that protects shelves or small drawers. Tool chest Toolcarts (also known as rollcabs) are commonly used in the transportation industry for maintenance and repair of vehicles on location. Used as portable work stations, some of the larger types are self powered and propelled, for example, pit carts in automobile racing. After several decades of decline in popularity, today a resurgence in use is underway. Viewed by many as intended primarily for specialized craftsmanship, such as machinists, tool and die makers, jewelers and other specialized craftsmen, they are also sought after by average tradesman and collectors as working heirloom. Many toolboxes and chests from a variety of trades can be seen at the Smithsonian Museum of American History. ===Material=== Tool chests are primarily made of metal, though some expensive models are made of hardwoods. ==Alternatives to toolboxes== A toolset in a plastic cover. * Toolsets: These are molded plastic cases typically containing a variety of household or automotive tools. Each item snaps into a designated spot in the case, which makes organizing tools much easier than with a conventional toolbox. They are very compact, lightweight, and inexpensive relative to purchasing tools and a toolbox separately. There are two major disadvantages: no ability to customize the selection of tools (sometimes the tools are of lower quality than what one might purchase individually); and little or no space to add new tools and supplies. Thus one still might need a toolbox in addition to the toolset. * Iron worker's toolbelt A professional socket toolset in a metal box, containing ratcheting socket wrenches in two sizes, sockets, bits and accessories. Such toolsets are standard equipment in mechanical workshops of various types. The image contains annotated descriptions for each item, visible when enlarged. * Toolbelts and aprons: Though at the far extreme of portability, they are insufficient for storing a large number of tools. One might use a toolbox for permanent storage and a toolbelt or apron to take just what is needed for a job. They are used in locations where a worker needs access to more tools than he can carry with just his hands while working in a location with no place to set tools down, such as working on a ladder or hanging from a utility pole. *Tool chest: A large single, or stacked metal cabinet with multiple doors that can accommodate large amounts of assorted light and heavy tools, as well as other repair equipment. *Tool Bag: Tool bags are often made of heavy canvas and leather. Some tool bags have a hinged steel frame around the opening. This allows the bag to stay open when in use. Many tool bags have pockets on the inside and or outside. They usually include handles and sometimes shoulder straps. Tool bags often have a firm, reinforced bottom panel. Tool bags may have a zipper or leather strap closure. Tool bags closely resemble medical bags. *Bucket organizers: These consist of rugged fabric or polyester bags draped into and around a 5-gallon bucket. They are lightweight, inexpensive, and can rival the toolbox as a means of storing and moving tools to a job site. Their dozens of pockets permit better organization, yet nearly everything is visible at first glance. That, however, could be a disadvantage as well, since one may have privacy or security concerns if the bucket has to be left in a public area. By contrast, toolboxes are often lockable and, obviously, opaque. In a vehicle, the bucket may be jostled and spill some of its contents. Tools left outdoors are also better protected from the elements in a toolbox. * \\"Autocarts\\": These are utility carts having a pivoting base for storage in vehicles. They are used by tradespersons to carry tools, equipment or supplies. They combine the advantages of toolboxes and toolbelts and are essentially portable truckboxes or transportable shopping carts. * \\"Workshop trolley\\": This is a tool cabinet with wheels, and, because of that, the tools can be easily moved from A to B. Usually you will find these mobile cabinets in workshops of mechanics. ==In computing== The term toolbox is used in computing to represent a set of subroutines (or functions) and global variables. Typically these implement missing functionality using capabilities available in the core software. ==See also== *Gang box *Repair kit *Organizer box ==References== ==External links== *Reviewer Tips Category:Containers ","title":"Toolbox"},{"id":"2203726","text":"Aureng-zebe is a Restoration drama by John Dryden, written in 1675.

Moxidectin kills some of the most common internal and external parasites by selectively binding to a parasite's glutamate-gated chloride ion channels. These channels are vital to the function of invertebrate nerve and muscle cells; when moxidectin binds to the channels, it disrupts neurotransmission, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. ==Medical uses== Moxidectin was approved for onchocerciasis (river-blindness) in 2018 for people over the age of 11 in the United States based on two studies. There is a need for additional trials, with long-term follow-up, to assess whether moxidectin is safe and effective for treatment of nematode infection in children and women of childbearing potential. Moxidectin is predicted to be a helpful to achieve elimination goals of this disease. * Dogs: Prevention of heartworm. In combination with imidacloprid to treat sarcoptic mange. * Horses: Treatment of parasites including Strongylus vulgaris, and stomach bots such as Gasterophilus intestinalis. * Cattle: Treatment of parasites such as the gastrointestinal nematode Ostertagia ostertagi, and the lungworm Dictyocaulus viviparus. * Sheep: Treatment of the nematodes Teladorsagia circumcincta and Haemonchus contortus. Nematodes can develop cross-resistance between moxidectin and other similar parasiticides, such as ivermectin, doramectin and abamectin. Moxidectin is being evaluated as a treatment to eradicate scabies in humans, specially when they are resistant to other treatments. ==Adverse effects== Studies of moxidectin show the side effects vary by animal and may be affected by the product's formulation, application method and dosage. An overdose of moxidectin enhances the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the central nervous system. In horses, overdose may lead to depression, drooping of the lower lip, tremor, lack of coordination when moving (ataxia), decreased rate of breathing (respiratory rate), stupor and coma. If a dog licks moxidectin from the skin which was applied as a \\"spot-on\\" (topical) treatment, this has the same effect as an overdose, and may cause vomiting, salivation and neurological signs such as ataxia, tremor, and nystagmus. Some Collie dogs can tolerate moxidectin, but other individuals are sensitive and upon ingestion, experience vomiting, salivation or transient neurological signs. ==Pharmacology== Moxidectin is very lipophilic, which causes it to have a high volume of distribution. Moxidectin concentrates in the animal's adipose tissue, from where it is released for up to two months following administration. In goats, the oral bioavailability of moxidectin is 2.7 times lower, and the half-life is 1.8 times shorter than in sheep. ==Chemistry== Moxidectin, a macrocyclic lactone of the milbemycin class, is a semisynthetic derivative of nemadectin, which is a fermentation product of the bacterium Streptomyces cyanogriseus subsp. noncyanogenus. ==History== In the late 1980s, an American Cyanamid Company agronomist discovered the Streptomyces bacteria from which moxidectin is derived in a soil sample from Australia. Two companies filed patents for moxidectin: Glaxo Group and the American Cyanamid Company; in 1988, all patents were transferred to American Cyanamid. In 1990, the first moxidectin product was sold in Argentina. For human use, moxidectin was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in June, 2018 for the treatment of onchocerciasis in adults and adolescents aged 12 and older. This is the first human approval worldwide.

Museum of Fine Arts station is accessible. ==History== Temporary station in 2001 used during construction of the accessible station Until the completion of the Huntington Avenue subway from to a portal near Opera Place on February 16, 1941, streetcars ran on the surface from the Boylston Street portal. Like other surface stops on the median-reservation section of the line, Ruggles Street station had bare asphalt platforms. In 1972, the MBTA began planning a reconstruction of that section of the line, then scheduled for 1973-74. The work was eventually done in 1980, when the line was closed to modify the track and wires for the new LRVs. The line was cut back to Symphony on March 21, 1980; it was re-extended to Northeastern (using LRVs) on June 21 and Brigham Circle on September 20.

The Moore family moved to Phoenix, Arizona, where he began performing with his older brother Johnny, who played both trombone and guitar. Aftger moving to Los Angeles, he participated in his first recording session for Decca as part of the Jones Boys Sing Band led and arranged by Leon Ren√©. The group attracted local attention on radio and two short films for MGM directed by Buster Keaton. Soon after, Moore accompanied pianist Nat King Cole at the Swanee Inn in North La Brea, Hollywood. He spent ten years with Cole in the piano-guitar-bass trio format that influenced Art Tatum, Oscar Peterson, Ahmad Jamal. Moore placed or topped polls in DownBeat, Metronome, and Esquire magazines from 1943 through 1948. Art Tatum professed his admiration for Moore in a 1944 magazine interview. After he left the King Cole Trio in October 1947, he joined his brother in Johnny Moore's Three Blazers as a member of that group into the early 1950s. Moore formed his own trio in 1952 and was active in Los Angeles. He recorded sessions as a leader and as a sideman throughout the 1950s but left the industry at the end of the decade. He returned to the recording studio in 1965 to record a tribute to Cole and again in the 1970s, briefly backing Helen Humes.

Developed in the early 1990s by Keygene, AFLP uses restriction enzymes to digest genomic DNA, followed by ligation of adaptors to the sticky ends of the restriction fragments. A subset of the restriction fragments is then selected to be amplified. This selection is achieved by using primers complementary to the adaptor sequence, the restriction site sequence and a few nucleotides inside the restriction site fragments (as described in detail below). The amplified fragments are separated and visualized on denaturing on agarose gel electrophoresis , either through autoradiography or fluorescence methodologies, or via automated capillary sequencing instruments. Although AFLP should not be used as an acronym, it is commonly referred to as \\"Amplified fragment length polymorphism\\". However, the resulting data are not scored as length polymorphisms, but instead as presence-absence polymorphisms. AFLP-PCR is a highly sensitive method for detecting polymorphisms in DNA. The technique was originally described by Vos and Zabeau in 1993.Zabeau, M and P. Vos. 1993. Selective restriction fragment amplification: a general method for DNA fingerprinting. European Patent Office, publication 0 534 858 A1, bulletin 93/13. In detail, the procedure of this technique is divided into three steps: #Digestion of total cellular DNA with one or more restriction enzymes and ligation of restriction half-site specific adaptors to all restriction fragments. #Selective amplification of some of these fragments with two PCR primers that have corresponding adaptor and restriction site specific sequences. #Electrophoretic separation of amplicons on a gel matrix, followed by visualisation of the band pattern. ==Applications== AFLP phylogeny analysis using a dendrogram The AFLP technology has the capability to detect various polymorphisms in different genomic regions simultaneously. It is also highly sensitive and reproducible. As a result, AFLP has become widely used for the identification of genetic variation in strains or closely related species of plants, fungi, animals, and bacteria. The AFLP technology has been used in criminal and paternity tests, also to determine slight differences within populations, and in linkage studies to generate maps for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. There are many advantages to AFLP when compared to other marker technologies including randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and microsatellites. AFLP not only has higher reproducibility, resolution, and sensitivity at the whole genome level compared to other techniques, but it also has the capability to amplify between 50 and 100 fragments at one time. In addition, no prior sequence information is needed for amplification (Meudt & Clarke 2007). As a result, AFLP has become extremely beneficial in the study of taxa including bacteria, fungi, and plants, where much is still unknown about the genomic makeup of various organisms. The AFLP technology is covered by patents and patent applications of Keygene N.V.

Although the dynastic governments of imperial China also claimed responsibility for the practice of religion, human rights bodies such as United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) have criticized this differentiation as falling short of international standards for the protection of religious freedom.Congressional-Executive Commission on China, Annual Report 2011, Oct 2011. The ruling Communist Party of China officially espouses state atheism, and has conducted antireligious campaigns to this end. China's five officially sanctioned religious organizations are the Buddhist Association of China, Chinese Taoist Association, Islamic Association of China, Three-Self Patriotic Movement and Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association. These groups have been overseen and controlled by the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of China since the State Administration for Religious Affairs' absorption into the United Front Work Department in 2018. Unregistered religious groups‚Äîincluding house churches, Falun Gong, Tibetan Buddhists, underground Catholics, and Uyghur Muslims‚Äîface varying degrees of harassment, including imprisonment and torture. == Legal framework == Article 36 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China of 1982 specifies that: This protection is extended only to what are called \\"normal religious activities,\\" generally understood to refer to religions that submit to state control via the State Administration for Religious Affairs. The Constitution further forbids the use of religion to \\"engage in activities that disrupt social order, impair the health of citizens or interfere with the educational system of the state.\\" Furthermore, it states that \\"[r]eligious organizations and religious affairs are not subject to any foreign dominance.‚Äù The law affords protection to five officially sanctioned religions: the Buddhist Association of China, Chinese Taoist Association, Islamic Association of China, Three-Self Patriotic Movement and Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association. Religious groups are required to register with the State Administration for Religious Affairs (SARA, formerly known as the central Religious Affairs Bureau) or its provincial and local offices (still known as Religious Affairs Bureaus (RABs)). SARA and the RABs are responsible for monitoring and judging the legitimacy of religious activity. Proselytizing is only permitted in private settings or within registered houses of worship. Proselytization in public, in unregistered churches or temples, or by foreigners is prohibited. Members of the officially atheist Communist Party are strongly discouraged from holding religious faith.Xinhua News Agency, 'CPC members shall not believe in religion: senior official' , 19 Dec 2011. A significant number of non-sanctioned churches and temples exist, attended by locals and foreigners alike. Unregistered or underground churches are not officially banned, but are not permitted to openly conduct religious services. These bodies may face varying degrees of interference, harassment, and persecution by state and party organs. In some instances, unregistered religious believers and leaders have been charged with \\"illegal religious activities\\" or \\"disrupting social stability.\\" Religious believers have also been charged under article 300 of the criminal code, which forbids using heretical organizations to \\"undermine the implementation of the law.\\" An extrajudicial, Communist Party-led security organ called the 6-10 Office oversees the suppression of Falun Gong and, increasingly, other unregistered religious organizations.Sarah Cook and Leeshai Lemish, ‚ÄòThe 610 Office:Policing the Chinese Spirit‚Äô , China Brief , Volume 11 Issue 17 (9 November 2011).Congressional-Executive Commission on China, ‚ÄòAnnual Report 2009‚Äô , 10 October 2009 Folk religions, though not officially protected, are sometimes tolerated by authorities. The State Administration for Religious Affairs has created a department to oversee the management of folk religion.United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, Annual Report 2011 , May 2011. Although the Communist Party of China has a long history of restricting religious freedom, in recent years it has become increasingly hostile toward religion and initiated campaigns to ‚Äúsinicize‚Äù Islam, Tibetan Buddhism, and Christianity to rid them of what it deems ‚Äúforeign‚Äù influences. The 2018 Revised Regulations on Religious Affairs effectively ban ‚Äúunauthorized‚Äù religious teaching and expand the role of local authorities in controlling religious activities. In 2019, religious freedom conditions in China continued to deteriorate. The Chinese government has created a high-tech surveillance state, utilizing facial recognition and artificial intelligence to monitor religious minorities. On April 1, 2019, a new regulation requiring religious venues to have legal representatives and professional accountants went into effect. Some smaller religious venues, especially in rural areas, found these requirements impossible to fulfill.https://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/USCIRF%202020%20Annual%20Report_Final_42920.pdf ==Christianity== Christianity has had a presence in China dating as far back as the Tang dynasty, and accumulated a following in China with the arrival of large numbers of missionaries during the Qing dynasty. Missionaries were expelled from China in 1949 when the Communist Party came to power, and the religion was associated with Western imperialism. However, Christianity experienced a resurgence of popularity since the reforms under Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s and 1980s. By 2011, approximately 60 million Chinese citizens were estimated to be practicing Protestantism or Catholicism. The majority of these do not belong to the state-sanctioned churches.Tim Gardam, Christians in China: Is the country in spiritual crisis? BBC, 11 Sept 2011. The government declared in 2018 that there are over 44 million Christians in China. Religious practices are still often tightly controlled by government authorities. Chinese children in Mainland China are permitted to be involved with officially sanctioned Christian meetings through the Three-Self Patriotic Movement or the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Associations. In early January 2018, Chinese authorities in Shanxi province demolished a church, which created a wave of fear among the Christians. ===Roman Catholicism=== A Roman Catholic church by the Lancang (Mekong) River at Cizhong, Yunnan Province, China China is home to an estimated 12 million Catholics, the majority of whom worship outside the official Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association (CPA). The State Administration for Religious Affairs states that there are 5.3 million Catholics belonging to the official Catholic Patriotic Association, which oversees 70 bishops, and approximately 6,000 churches nationwide.U.S Department of State, International Religious Freedom Report 2010: China , 17 Nov 2010. In addition, there are roughly 40 bishops unordained by the CPA who operate unofficially, and recognize the authority of the Vatican. The state- sanctioned church appoints its own bishops, and as with all official religious, exercises control over the doctrine and leadership of the religion. As a matter of maintaining autonomy and rejecting foreign intervention, the official church has no official contact with the Vatican, and does not recognize its authority. However, the CPA has allowed for unofficial Vatican approval of ordinations. Although the CPA continues to carry out ordinations opposed by the Holy See, the majority of CPA bishops are now recognized by both authorities. In addition to overseeing the practice of the Catholic faith, the CPA espouses politically oriented objectives as well. Liu Bainian, chairman of the CPA and the Bishops Conference of the Catholic Church in China, stated in a 2011 interview that the church needed individuals who \\"love the country and love religion: politically, they should respect the Constitution, respect the law, and fervently love the socialist motherland.‚Äô‚Äô Some Catholics who recognize the authority of the Holy See choose to worship clandestinely due to the risk of harassment from authorities. Several underground Catholic bishops have been reported disappeared or imprisoned, and harassment of unregistered bishops and priests is common. There are reports of Catholic bishops and priests being forced by authorities to attend the ordination ceremonies for bishops who had not gained Vatican approval. Chinese authorities also have reportedly pressured Catholics to break communion with the Vatican by requiring them to renounce an essential belief in Roman Catholicism, the primacy of the Roman Pontiff. In other instances, however, authorities have permitted Vatican-loyal churches to carry out operations. ===Protestantism=== The Three-Self Patriotic Movement, National Committee of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of the Protestant Churches in China; the Three-Self Church or \\"TSPM\\" is the government-sanctioned (\\"patriotic\\") Christian organization in China. Known in combination with the China Christian Council as the lianghui, they form the only state-sanctioned (\\"registered\\") Protestant church in mainland China. All other Protestant denominations are illegal. Chinese house churches are a religious movement of unregistered assemblies of Christians in China, which operate independently of the government-run Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM) and China Christian Council (CCC) for Protestant groups and the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association (CCPA) and the Chinese Catholic Bishops Council (CCBC) for Catholics. They are also known as the \\"Underground\\" Church or the \\"Unofficial\\" Church, although this is somewhat of a misnomer as they are collections of unrelated individual churches rather than a single unified church. They are called \\"house churches\\" because as they are not officially registered organizations, they cannot independently own property and hence they meet in private houses, often in secret for fear of arrest or imprisonment. ==BuddhismTibetan Buddhism=== Two young Tibetan Buddhists at the Sakya Monastery in southern Tibet China took full control of Tibet in 1959. In the wake of the takeover and especially during the cultural revolution many monasteries were destroyed and many monks and laypeople killed. The 14th Dalai Lama fled to India and has since ceded temporal power to an elected government-in-exile. The current Dalai Lama has attempted to negotiate with the Chinese authorities for greater autonomy and religious freedom for Tibet. As various high-ranking Lamas in the country have died, the authorities have proposed their own candidates on the religious authorities, which has led at times to rival claimants to the same position. In an effort to control this, the Chinese government passed a law in 2007 requiring a Reincarnation Application be completed and approved for all lamas wishing to reincarnate. The present incarnation of the Panchen Lama is disputed. The Dalai Lama recognises Gedhun Choekyi Nyima; however, the Chinese government recognises Gyaincain Norbu as the incarnation of the 11th Panchen Lama.China Tibet Information Center The 11th Panchen Exile Tibetan sources allege that Gedhun Choekyi Nyima was kidnapped by the Chinese government.BBC news, Tibet's Missing Spiritual Guide , May 6, 2005 The identity of the Panchen Lama is of critical importance to Tibetan Buddhism because he is one of the authorities that must approve the next Dalai Lama. ==Taoism== Taoist practitioners are required to register with the state-controlled Chinese Taoist Association (CTA), which exercises control over religious doctrine and personnel. Local governments restrict the construction of Taoist temples and statues, and call for abandonment of practices they deem to be \\"superstitious\\" or \\"feudal.\\" The CTA dictates the proper interpretation of Taoist doctrine, and exhorts Taoist practitioners to support the Communist Party and the state. For example, a Taoist scripture reading class held by the CTA in November 2010 required participants to ‚Äò‚Äòfervently love the socialist motherland [and] uphold the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.‚Äô‚Äô ==Islam== An ethnic Hui family celebrates Eid The State Administration for Religious Affairs places the number of Muslims in China at approximately 21 million, while independent estimates suggest that the number could be upwards of 50 million or more. According to a 2000 census, 96 percent of 20.3 million reported Muslims belong to three ethnic groups: Hui, Uyghur, and Kazakh. Most Hui Muslims live in Ningxia, Qinghai, and Gansu provinces, while Uyghur Muslims are predominantly found in Xinjiang. The state-run Islamic Association of China (IAC) oversees the practice of Islam, though many Muslims worship outside the state system. The IAC regulates the content of sermons and the interpretation of religious scripture, exercises control over the confirmation of religious leaders, and monitors overseas pilgrimages. In 2001, the IAC established a committee to ensure that scriptures were interpreted in a manner that would serve the interests of the Chinese government and the Communist Party. Authorities in Xinjiang impose rigid controls over religious expression, particularly over Uyghurs. Human rights reports indicate that crackdowns on religion are frequently integrated into security campaigns. Authorities monitor mosques, restrict the observation of Ramadan by government officials and students, and enact campaigns to prevent Uyghur men from wearing beards. Uyghur Muslims who worship independently have been detained and charged with conducting \\"illegal religious activities.\\" However, the suppression of the Uyghurs has more to do with the fact that they are separatists, rather than Muslims[ who said? ]. China banned a book titled \\"Xing Fengsu\\" (\\"Sexual Customs\\") which insulted Islam and placed its authors under arrest in 1989 after protests in Lanzhou and Beijing by Chinese Hui Muslims, during which the Chinese police provided protection to the Hui Muslim protesters, and the Chinese government organized public burnings of the book.Beijing Review, Volume 32 1989 , p. 13. Gladney 1991, p. 2.Schein 2000 , p. 154.Gladney 2004 , p. 66.Bulag 2010 , p. 104.Gladney 2005 , p. 257.Gladney 2013 , p. 144.Sautman 2000 , p. 79.Gladney 1996 , p. 341.Lipman 1996 , p. 299. The Chinese government assisted them and gave into their demands because the Hui do not have a separatist movement, unlike the Uyghurs. Hui Muslim protesters who violently rioted by vandalizing property during the protests against the book were let off by the Chinese government and went unpunished while Uyghur protesters were imprisoned.Gladney 2004 , p. 232. Eid al-Adha at Jiangwan Mosque, Shanghai. In 2007, anticipating the coming \\"Year of the Pig\\" in the Chinese calendar, depictions of pigs were banned from CCTV \\"to avoid conflicts with ethnic minorities\\". This is believed to refer to China's population of 20 million Muslims (to whom pigs are considered \\"unclean\\"). In response to the 2015 Charlie Hebdo shooting, Chinese state-run media attacked Charlie Hebdo for publishing the cartoons which insulted Muhammad, with the state-run Xinhua advocating limits on freedom of speech, while another state-run newspaper Global Times said the attack was \\"payback\\" for what it characterized as Western colonialism, and it also accused Charlie Hebdo of trying to incite a clash of civilizations. Different Muslim ethnic groups in different regions of China are treated differently by the Chinese government with regards to religious freedom. Religious freedom is present for Hui Muslims, who can practice their religion, build Mosques, and have their children attend Mosques, while more controls are placed on Uyghurs in Xinjiang. Since the 1980s, Islamic private schools have been supported and permitted by the Chinese government in Muslim areas, while only Xinjiang is specifically prevented from allowing these schools because of the separatist sentiment which exists there. Although religious education for children is officially forbidden by law in China, the Communist party allows Hui Muslims to violate this law and have their children educated in religion and attend Mosques while the law is enforced on Uyghurs. After secondary education is completed, China then allows Hui students to embark on religious studies under the direction of an Imam.ALL√àS & CH√âRIF-CHEBBI & HALFON 2003 , p. 14. China does not enforce the law against children attending Mosques on non-Uyghurs in areas outside Xinjiang. Hui Muslims who are employed by the state are allowed to fast during Ramadan unlike Uyghurs who hold the same job positions, the amount of Hui who are going on Hajj is expanding, and Hui women are allowed to wear veils, while Uyghur women are discouraged from wearing them. Hui religious schools are allowed to operate a massive autonomous network of mosques and schools that are run by a Hui Sufi leader, which was formed with the approval of the Chinese government even as he admitted to attending an event where Bin Laden spoke.Savadove, Bill. 2005. \\"Faith Flourishes in an Arid Wasteland; Muslim Sect in Ningxia Accepts Beijing's Authority and Is Allowed to Build a Virtual Religious State.\\" South China Morning Post, August 17. \\"The Diplomat\\" reported on the fact that while Uyghur's religious activities are curtailed, Hui Muslims are granted widespread religious freedom and therefore the policy of the Chinese government towards Uyghurs in Xinjiang is not directed against Islam, but rather aggressively stamping out the Uyghur separatist threat.Crane, Brent. 2014. \\"A Tale of Two Chinese Muslim Minorities\\" The Diplomat, August 22. Uyghur views vary by the oasis where they live. China has historically favored Turpan and Hami. Uyghurs in Turfan and Hami and their leaders like Emin Khoja allied with the Qing against Uyghurs in Altishahr. During the Qing dynasty, China enfeoffed the rulers of Turpan and Hami (Kumul) as autonomous princes, while the rest of the Uyghurs in Altishahr (the Tarim Basin) were ruled by Begs.Rudelson & Rudelson 1997 , p. 31. Uyghurs from Turpan and Hami were appointed by China as officials to rule over Uyghurs in the Tarim Basin. Turpan is more economically prosperous and it views China more positively than does the rebellious Kashgar, which is the most anti- Chinese oasis. Uyghurs in Turpan are treated leniently and favorably by China with regards to religious policies, while Kashgar is subjected to controls by the government.Rudelson & Rudelson 1997 , pp. 46-7.Central Asia Monitor 1993 , p. 19. In Turpan and Hami, religion is viewed more positively by China than religion in Kashgar and Khotan in southern Xinjiang.Mackerras 2003 , p. 118. Both Uyghur and Han Communist officials in Turpan turn a blind eye to the law and allow religious Islamic education for Uyghur children.Svanberg & Westerlund 2012 , p. 202.Rudelson & Rudelson 1997 , p. 81. Celebrating at religious functions and going on Hajj to Mecca is encouraged by the Chinese government, for Uyghur members of the Communist party. From 1979‚Äì1989, 350 mosques were built in Turpan.Rudelson & Rudelson 1997 , p. 129. Han, Hui, and the Chinese government is viewed much more positively by Uyghurs, specifically in Turpan, where the government gives them better economic, religious, and political treatment.Svanberg & Westerlund 2012 , p. 205. The Uyghur terrorist organization East Turkestan Islamic Movement's magazine Islamic Turkistan has accused the Chinese \\"Muslim Brotherhood\\" (the Yihewani) of being responsible for the moderation of Hui Muslims and the lack of Hui joining terrorist jihadist groups in addition to blaming other things for the lack of Hui jihadists, such as the fact that for more than 300 years Hui and Uyghurs have been enemies of each other, with no separatist Islamist organizations operating among the Hui, the fact that the Hui view China as their home, and the fact that the \\"infidel Chinese\\" language is the language of the Hui. ===Tibetan-Muslim sectarian violence=== In Tibet, the majority of Muslims are Hui people. Hatred between Tibetans and Muslims stems from events during the Muslim warlord Ma Bufang's rule in Qinghai such as Ngolok rebellions (1917‚Äì49) and the Sino-Tibetan War, but in 1949 the Communists put an end to the violence between Tibetans and Muslims, however, new Tibetan-Muslim violence broke out after China engaged in liberalization. Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over incidents such as bones in soups and prices of balloons, and Tibetans accused Muslims of being cannibals who cooked humans in their soup and of contaminating food with urine. Tibetans attacked Muslim restaurants. Fires set by Tibetans which burned the apartments and shops of Muslims resulted in Muslim families being killed and wounded in the 2008 mid- March riots. Due to Tibetan violence against Muslims, the traditional Islamic white caps have not been worn by many Muslims. Scarfs were removed and replaced with hairnets by Muslim women in order to hide. Muslims prayed in secret at home when in August 2008 the Tibetans burned the Mosque. Incidents such as these which make Tibetans look bad on the international stage are covered up by the Tibetan exile community. The repression of Tibetan separatism by the Chinese government is supported by Hui Muslims. In addition, Chinese-speaking Hui have problems with Tibetan Hui (the Tibetan speaking Kache minority of Muslims). The main Mosque in Lhasa was burned down by Tibetans and Chinese Hui Muslims were violently assaulted by Tibetan rioters in the 2008 Tibetan unrest. Tibetan exiles and foreign scholars alike ignore and do not talk about sectarian violence between Tibetan Buddhists and Muslims. The majority of Tibetans viewed the wars against Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11 positively and it had the effect of galvanizing anti-Muslim attitudes among Tibetans and resulted in an anti-Muslim boycott against Muslim-owned businesses. Tibetan Buddhists propagate a false libel that Muslims cremate their Imams and use the ashes to convert Tibetans to Islam by making Tibetans inhale the ashes, even though the Tibetans seem to be aware that Muslims practice burial and not cremation since they frequently clash against proposed Muslim cemeteries in their area. Since the Chinese government supports and backs up the Hui Muslims, the Tibetans deliberately attack the Hui Muslims as a way to demonstrate anti-government sentiment and because they have a background of sectarian violence against each other since Ma Bufang's rule due to their separate religions and ethnicity and Tibetans resent Hui economic domination. In 1936, after Sheng Shicai expelled 30,000 Kazakhs from Xinjiang to Qinghai, Hui led by General Ma Bufang massacred their fellow Muslim Kazakhs, until there were 135 of them left. From Northern Xinjiang over 7,000 Kazakhs fled to the Tibetan-Qinghai plateau region via Gansu and were wreaking massive havoc so Ma Bufang solved the problem by relegating the Kazakhs into designated pastureland in Qinghai, but Hui, Tibetans, and Kazakhs in the region continued to clash against each other. Tibetans attacked and fought against the Kazakhs as they entered Tibet via Gansu and Qinghai. In northern Tibet Kazakhs clashed with Tibetan soldiers and then the Kazakhs were sent to Ladakh. Tibetan troops robbed and killed Kazakhs 400 miles east of Lhasa at Chamdo when the Kazakhs were entering Tibet.https://www.academia.edu/4534001/STUDIES_IN_THE_POLITICS_HISTORY_AND_CULTURE_OF_TURKIC_PEOPLES page 192 In 1934, 1935, 1936-1938 from Qumil Eliqsan led the Kerey Kazakhs to migrate to Gansu and the amount was estimated at 18,000, and they entered Gansu and Qinghai. Tibetan troops serving under the Dalai Lama murdered the American CIA agent Douglas Mackiernan and his two White Russian helpers because he was dressed as a Kazakh, their enemy. ==Falun Gong== Gao Rongrong, a Falun Gong practitioner was allegedly tortured in custody in 2005.http://www.amnesty.de/umleitung/2006/deu03/031?lang=de%26mimetype%3dtext%2fhtml Following a period of meteoric growth of Falun Gong in the 1990s, the Communist Party launched a campaign to \\"eradicate\\" Falun Gong on 20 July 1999. The suppression is characterised by a multifaceted propaganda campaign, a program of enforced ideological conversion and re-education, and a variety of extralegal coercive measures such as arbitrary arrests, forced labor, and physical torture, sometimes resulting in death.

He broke through in 2001 with his international hit single \\"Perdono\\" and has remained commercially successful since then, in several countries. Ferro has released a Spanish version of each of his albums, and has also sung in English, Portuguese, and French. Known as the modern face of Italian pop music, he frequently writes songs for other artists and has produced albums for Giusy Ferreri, Alessandra Amoroso and Baby K. Aside from his success as an artist, Ferro is well known for his personal struggles. Having been overweight as a teenager, he has been outspoken about his battles with food addiction and eating disorders. In October 2010, at the height of his fame, Ferro came out as gay, having himself struggled with depression related to self-acceptance about his homosexuality. Ferro is currently one of the best-selling artists in Italy. Both his third album Nessuno √® solo and fourth album Alla mia et√† were certified diamond. Despite his fears, his coming out did not negatively affect his career, as fifth album L'amore √® una cosa semplice was the best-selling album of 2012 in Italy, and his first greatest hits album was supported by a stadium tour. As of 2015, Ferro has sold over 15 million records worldwide.http://www.sanremonews.it/2015/02/09/leggi- notizia/argomenti/festival-di-sanremo/articolo/a-sanremo-arriva-il-maxi- cartiglio-lungo-200-metri-dei-mitici-baci-perugina.html ==BiographyChildhood and early beginnings=== Ferro's interest in music was born when he received a toy keyboard as a present, which was used to compose his first songs when he was seven. He later started taking guitar and piano classes at a local conservatory of music. When he was 16 years old, he joined a gospel choir and during the same years, he started performing in piano bars and karaoke contests. In 1997, Ferro participated in the \\"Accademia della Canzone di Sanremo\\", a music contest created with the purpose to choose the contestants of the Sanremo Music Festival, but was eliminated during the first stage of the competition. The following year, Ferro participated again in the same contest, and despite being chosen as one of the 12 finalists, he did not make it to win the competition. However, during the selections, Ferro met music producers Alberto Salerno and Mara Maionchi, and started to collaborate with them. In 1999 Ferro also toured throughout Italy as a back vocalist with the Italian hip hop band Sottotono. ===Career breakthrough=== In 2001, Ferro signed a contract with EMI Music Italy. On 22 June 2001, he released his first single, \\"Xdono\\". During the first months after the release, the song received a poor reception, but it later became a hit and, after topping the Italian Singles Chart in September 2001, it was certified double platinum by the Federation of the Italian Music Industry for sales exceeding 100,000 copies. The song was included in Ferro's debut album, Rosso Relativo, released on 26 October 2001. Following the commercial success obtained in Italy, in 2002 the album was released in several European countries. A Spanish-language version of the record, titled Rojo Relativo, was also released in Spain and Latin America. Rosso Relativo obtained success in different markets throughout its various editions and had sold more than 1,000,000 copies worldwide by 2004, according to EMI Music. The album also allowed Ferro to receive a nomination for Best New Artist at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2003. ===Second studio album, 111=== In November 2003, Ferro released his second studio album, 111, recorded both in Italian and Spanish, produced by Alberto Salerno, Mara Maionchi and Michele Canova. The album was preceded by the release of \\"Xverso\\" / \\"Perverso\\", and also spawned the singles \\"Sere nere\\" / \\"Tardes negras\\", \\"Non me lo so spiegare\\" / \\"No me lo puedo explicar\\" and \\"Ti voglio bene\\" / \\"Desde ma√±ana no lo s√©\\". 111 has sold more than 1,000,000 copies worldwide, topping the Mexican Albums Chart and being certified four times platinum in Italy for domestic sales exceeding 450,000 copies. Following the success of the album Ferro won Best Italian Artist at the 2004 MTV Europe Music Awards in Rome. In July 2004, Ferro also released in Europe his first English-language single, \\"Universal Prayer\\", a duet with British R&B; singer Jamelia recorded to promote the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece. Ferro lived in Mexico during these years, first in Cuernavaca and later in Puebla. He studied Spanish there at a university, eventually graduating in August 2005, before relocating to Manchester. ===Nessuno √® solo / Nadie est√° solo, the third studio album=== Ferro's third studio album, Nessuno √® solo / Nadie est√° solo, was released in June 2006, following the lead single \\"Stop! Dimentica\\", which became a number- one hit in Italy and Austria. The album, described by music critics as more intimate and melancholic, obtained in Italy a success even bigger than his previous ones, reaching the diamond certification for its domestic sales. The third single from the album, \\"Ti scatter√≤ una foto\\", was included in the soundtrack of the movie Ho voglia di te, directed by Luis Prieto and based on the book with the same title by Federico Moccia. Nessuno √® solo also features a duet with Italian pop singer-songwriter Biagio Antonacci, while the Spanish- language version of the album includes \\"Mi credo\\", a song recorded with Pepe Aguilar. ===Alla mia et√† / A mi edad=== In June 2008 Ferro co-wrote with Roberto Casalino the single \\"Non ti scordar mai di me\\" for X Factor Italy's first edition's runner-up Giusy Ferreri. The song became a huge success in Italy, topping the Italian Singles Chart for 12 non-consecutive weeks. Ferro also produced Giusy Ferreri's debut album, Gaetana, containing 6 songs penned by him, including \\"L'amore e basta!\\", a duet between Ferro and Ferreri. On 7 November 2008 Ferro released his fourth studio album, Alla mia et√† / A mi edad, preceded by the single with the same title. Alla mia et√† debuted at number one on the Italian Albums Chart and became the best-selling album of 2009 in Italy, also achieving his second diamond certification. The album contains a duet with singer-songwriter Franco Battiato, and \\"Breathe Gentle\\", the English version of third single \\"Indietro\\", features Kelly Rowland. Other collaborators to the project included Italian songstress Laura Pausini, Anah√≠ and Dulce Mar√≠a of Mexican pop group RBD and Amaia Montero. In November 2009, Ferro released his first video album, Alla mia et√† ‚Äì Live in Rome, recorded during his concerts at the Stadio Olimpico on 24 and 25 June 2009. A few months later, Ferro was chosen to write and record the Italian version of Mary J. Blige's single \\"Each Tear\\", included in her album Stronger with Each Tear The song reached the top spot on the Italian Singles Chart. ===L'amore √® una cosa semplice / El amor es una cosa simple=== In October 2011 Ferro released \\"La differenza tra me e te\\", the lead single from his fifth studio album L'amore √® una cosa semplice (titled El amor es una cosa simple in Spanish). The album was released on 28 November 2011 and spent five weeks on top of the Italian Albums Chart. All seven singles were certified gold or higher in the country. The album itself was certified eight times platinum and became the best-selling album of 2012. During the spring and summer of 2012, Ferro embarked on a largely domestic concert tour, with additional stops in Switzerland, Belgium and Monaco. The tour's highlight was Ferro's first full stadium concert at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. This sold-out concert was attended by 50,000 fans. In 2012 Tiziano wrote the song Per Te, sung by Andrea Bocelli and contained in the album of the world-famous jazz player Chris Botti, which will earn him a Grammy Award as Best Pop Instrumental Album. In 2013 Ferro opted to focus on collaborating with other artists. Italian female hip hop artist Baby K released her debut album Una seria in March, which was produced by Ferro together with Michele Canova. Ferro featured on first single \\"Killer\\", which peaked at No. 10 on the Italian Singles Chart and was certified platinum. He also featured on the album's third single, \\"Sei sola\\". In September Alessandra Amoroso released Amore puro, another album produced by Ferro and Canova. This album achieved a double platinum certification. Four of its five singles were written by Ferro. ===TZN - The Best of Tiziano Ferro=== Ferro released his first greatest hits album TZN - The Best of Tiziano Ferro in November 2014. Both the lead single \\"Senza scappare mai pi√π\\" and the second single \\"Incanto\\" reached the top five in Italy and were certified platinum. The album itself spent six non-consecutive weeks at number one, the last of which came after his acclaimed guest performance at the Sanremo Music Festival. It was eventually certified seven times platinum and spent almost a year in the top ten on the Italian album chart. In Spain, it was Ferro's first top ten album in more than ten years.http://www.spanishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Tiziano+Ferro&titel;=TZN+-+The+Best+Of+Tiziano+Ferro&cat;=a In the summer of 2015 Ferro toured the main Italian stadiums, including two concerts at the San Siro stadium in Milan and two at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.

That same month Ferro started a European arena tour to continue promoting the greatest hits compilation. ===Il mestiere della vita=== Ferro announced the release date of his sixth studio album a year in advance, at the last concert of his European arena tour. He told the crowd that it would be released on 2 December 2016. In June the album's title was revealed to be Il mestiere della vita.

In late 2009, he came close to taking his own life, going as far as to write a suicide note. In early 2010 his desperation led him to break down and came out to his father, an event that inspired the title of his first book, Trent'anni e una chiacchierata con pap√† (Thirty years old and a chat with dad). This book, published in October 2010, contains most of his personal diaries, dutifully kept since his teenage years. Its release was preceded by an interview with Vanity Fair in which he declared his homosexuality to the public. The following year Ferro moved back to Italy to live closer to his friends and family. In 2019, Ferro announced his marriage to former Warner Bros. consultant Victor Allen. The two were married in Sabaudia, a comune of the Latina province in Latium. In a statement made to the Corriere, he confirmed that he considers himself both \\"gay and Catholic\\". ==Discography== * Rosso Relativo (2001) * 111 (2003) * Nessuno √® solo (2006) * Alla mia et√† (2009) * L'amore √® una cosa semplice (2011) * Il mestiere della vita (2016) * Accetto miracoli (2019) ==Tour== * Rosso relativo Tour 2002-2003 * 111% Tour 2004-2005 * Nessuno √® solo Tour 2007 * Alla mia et√† Tour 2009-2010 * L'amore √® una cosa semplice Tour 2012 * Lo stadio Tour 2015 * Il mestiere della vita Tour 2017 ==Awards and nominations== 2002 * Italian Music Awards ‚Äì Nomination for \\"Best Male Artist\\" * Italian Music Awards ‚Äì Nomination for \\"Best Album\\" for Rosso Relativo * Italian Music Awards ‚Äì Nomination for \\"Best Single\\" for \\"Rosso relativo\\" * Premio Italiano della Musica ‚Äì \\"Revelation of the Year\\" * Premio Italiano della Musica ‚Äì Nomination for \\"Song of the Year\\" for \\"Xdono\\" * Festival di San Marino ‚Äì \\"Best Male Artist\\" * Festival di San Marino ‚Äì \\"Best Album\\" for Rosso relativo * Festivalbar ‚Äì \\"Revelation of the Year\\" 2003 * Latin Grammy Awards ‚Äì Nomination for the \\"Best New Artist\\" * NRJ Music Awards ‚Äì Nomination for \\"International Male Artist of the Year\\" * NRJ Music Awards ‚Äì Nomination for \\"International Album of the Year\\" for Rosso relativo 2004 * MTV Europe Music Awards ‚Äì \\"Best Italian Act\\" * Los Premios MTV Latinoam√©rica ‚Äì Nomination for \\"Best Solo Artist\\" * Premios Oye! ‚Äì \\"Latin Pop Male\\" * Cadena Dial - \\"Premios Dial 2003\\" * European Border Breakers Awards.

The station is the downtown terminus of the Blue Line, part of the MBTA subway system. It has a single wedge-shaped island platform located inside a balloon loop. Bowdoin is the only Blue Line station that is not accessible. Bowdoin opened in 1916 as part of an extension of the East Boston Tunnel, serving as the terminal for streetcar lines from East Boston. The line was converted to use high-floor trains in 1924, with raised platforms constructed at the stations. The station was modernized in 1968, with a new brutalist headhouse designed by Josep Llu√≠s Sert. Bowdoin was closed for two periods in the early 1980s due to budget cuts; it was open for limited hours on weekdays only until 2014, when it returned to full-time service during the reconstruction of nearby Government Center station. The proposed Red‚ÄìBlue connector would extend the Blue Line west to a Red Line transfer at Charles/MGH station, with Bowdoin station likely eliminated. ==Station design== alt=See caption The station is located under Cardinal Cushing Memorial Park, a triangular public plaza at the northeast corner of Bowdoin Square ‚Äì the intersection of Cambridge Street with Bowdoin Street and New Chardon Street, located at the junction of Beacon Hill neighborhood and the Government Center area. The single entrance to the station is near the east end of the park, with a small sunken plaza below the rest of the park and a concrete triangular prism headhouse. Bowdoin station has a single wedge-shaped island platform (two side platforms that intersection at their east ends) about below the surface. The platform is located inside a balloon loop which allows westbound trains to turn eastbound. West of the loop, about of two tail tracks (Bowdoin Yard) run west under Cambridge Street. The yard is used as weather-protected train storage during the winter. The eastbound section of the platform is only long enough for four cars. Since the Blue Line uses six-car trains, doors cannot be automatically opened; passengers must use pushbuttons on the outside of the train to open doors. The fare lobby, slightly higher in elevation than the platform, is located in the center of the station. A ramp leads from the fare lobby to the east end of the platform, with stairs connecting the west end of the westbound side of the platform to the lobby. Stairs and an up escalator lead from the lobby to the surface. The station floor is terrazzo, and the walls brown enameled brick. The walls of the track area plus the ceilings are the painted concrete of the tunnel structure. Trim and fittings are primarily stainless steel; columns on the platform are covered with white enamel tile and trimmed with stainless steel. ==HistoryStreetcar station=== alt=A black-and- white photo of an underground streetcar station The East Boston Tunnel was opened to Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) streetcar service as far as Court Street on December 30, 1904. Court Street proved to be a problematic terminus; its stub-end single-track design limited frequent service and resulted in several fatal crashes. The Boston Transit Commission (BTC) began construction of a extension of the East Boston Tunnel on November 29, 1912. The extension ran from Scollay Square (where a new platform was constructed to replace Court Street station) to a new station and loop at Bowdoin Square. Tracks continued west under Cambridge Street to an incline at Joy Street, where streetcars could continue on surface tracks to Charles Street and the Longfellow Bridge to Cambridge. Bowdoin was built with a wedge-shaped island platform inside a balloon loop, which eliminated the awkward end-changing required at Court Street and allowed use of unpowered trailer cars in the tunnel to increase capacity. The station had two staircase entrances at the west end of Bowdoin Square, adjacent to the Parkman building. The finish of Bowdoin and Scollay Under stations was similar to Washington station (opened 1915) and the Boylston Street subway stations (1914): granolithic platforms, wainscotting of white polished terrazzo, and white plaster upper walls and ceiling. Bands of ceramic tile trimmed the wainscotting; at Bowdoin, the tile was dark blue. The stairwells were walled with polished Quincy granite and roofed with smoothed concrete. Construction of the station began on March 2, 1914; 247 men were employed for the work. Several buildings had to be underpinned to allow the loop to be built underneath them. Construction of the station was completed on December 4, 1914, with finish work following. The extension opened on March 18, 1916. All streetcar lines from East Boston looped at Bowdoin except for a Central Square, Cambridge‚ÄìOrient Heights line. ===Modifications=== alt=A glass and concrete subway entrance in an urban plaza Though originally planned to use high-floor rapid transit trains, the East Boston Tunnel opened with streetcars serving low-platform stations. Large bi-loading streetcars (with high floors but capable of loading from low platforms), which incorporated many attributes from metro cars used on the Main Line El, began use in 1905. However, neither these nor the large center-entrance cars introduced in 1917 (which were designed for multiple unit operation) could fully handle the crowds. In 1921, the Boston Transit Department (BTD)‚Äîthe successor to the BTC‚Äîbegan work at Maverick Square to convert the East Boston Tunnel to high- floor metro trains. The next year, the BTD board approved the construction of high-level platforms at Atlantic Avenue, Devonshire, Scollay Under, and Bowdoin. Construction of concrete high-level platforms above the rails at Bowdoin began in December 1923 or January 1924. A section of low-level platform was left to serve streetcars during construction. Temporary wooden platform sections were put in place to allow service to begin on April 21, with the permanent concrete sections completed by July 12. The Bowdoin platform was also extended east from August 27 to December 12. Rather than modify the tunnel, the BERy elected to build smaller-than-usual rapid transit cars which could operate in a tunnel designed for streetcars‚Äîparticularly around the tight loop at Bowdoin. Blue Line cars are thus long, substantially shorter than the Orange Line cars and the Red Line cars. Because the line did not have a dedicated heavy maintenance facility, major repair work was performed at Eliot Shops ‚Äì the main maintenance facility for the Cambridge‚ÄìDorchester Line. Trains used the former streetcar portal west of Bowdoin and ran on surface streetcar tracks on the Longfellow Bridge, which connected to the Cambridge‚ÄìDorchester Line tracks near Kendall Square. When the first phase of the Revere Extension opened to with a new maintenance facility in 1952, the connection was no longer necessary and the portal was filled. The newly-formed Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) assigned colors to the four MBTA subway lines in 1965, with the East Boston Tunnel and Revere Extension becoming the Blue Line. The station was modernized in 1968 as part of a $9 million systemwide station improvement program. The original entrances at the west end of the station were replaced with a glassy entrance under a tilted concrete slab, set into a shallow depression to reduce the costs of installing the escalator. The new brutalist headhouse, near the middle of the station, was designed by Josep Llu√≠s Sert as part of a project for a never-built Catholic chapel nearby. Illustrations showing the history of Bowdoin Square were added to the station signs. The station was surveyed in 1984 and 1987 for potential inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places; it was concluded that the 1924 and 1968 reconstructions had left little of the original station, and that it was of minor significance within the system. ===Closures and reopening=== alt=A wide subway platform with white columns In the early 1980s, the MBTA suffered from a serious budget crisis, which resulted in service cuts. MBTA Commuter Rail service to and Concord and on the Woburn Branch was cut entirely, five underused commuter rail stations were closed, and Essex were closed for short periods, and the outer ends of the Orange and Blue lines were bustituted on Sundays. Bowdoin, with low ridership and in close proximity to , was closed on January 3, 1981 due to budget cuts. (second page) It reopened on January 11, 1982, but only on weekdays until 6:30 pm - intended to serve workers in nearby office and government buildings. Bowdoin was briefly closed again from March 3 to April 20, 1982, and reopened again with limited hours, with Government Center serving as the terminus on nights and weekends (though trains continued to loop at Bowdoin). After the early 1980s, it was the only MBTA subway station with limited hours. The station was closed from July 29 to September 8, 1992, during track work on the loop. As the MBTA planned the Blue Line Modernization Project in the early 1990s, the agency planned to close Bowdoin in order to eliminate the tight loop. The closure would take place after the renovation of Government Center, which would re-add a long-closed entrance at the west end of the Blue Line platform. (second page) In 2008, the MBTA began running six- car trains on the Blue Line. Because the eastbound side of the Bowdoin platform can only fit four cars, the MBTA had originally planned to close the station when six-car trains entered service; a planned renovation of Government Center station was to add a second headhouse close to Bowdoin Square. However, the station was kept open, with only four cars on each eastbound train berthed at the platform. Until at least 2011, the MBTA still planned to close the station after Government Center was renovated. However, by 2013, the MBTA decided not to construct the planned west entrance at Government Center, and to instead build only a less-expensive emergency exit. On December 28, 2013, the MBTA resumed night and weekend service to Bowdoin station. The change was intended to provide alternative transportation during the three-month closure of the Callahan Tunnel and subsequent two-year closure of Government Center station. This was the first time since 1981 that the station was open during all operating hours. In February 2016, the MBTA announced that Bowdoin would remain open at all times even after Government Center reopened on March 21. Daily ridership at the station increased from 1,526 in 2013 to 2,127 in FY 2019. The reconstructions of Government Center in 2014‚Äì16 left Bowdoin as the only non-accessible metro station on the Blue Line; aside from street-level light rail stops, Bowdoin is one of only four non-accessible MBTA subway stations. In 2019, the MBTA indicated that Bowdoin was a \\"Tier II\\" accessibility priority pending the results of conceptual design. ===Red‚ÄìBlue connector=== The Red‚ÄìBlue connector is a proposed extension of the Blue Line under Cambridge Street to Charles/MGH station, about west of Bowdoin, where a transfer to the Red Line would be available. The project was first proposed in 1924, and returned to consideration in the 1978 update to the Program for Mass Transportation, although extensions from Bowdoin or Government Center to were proposed in 1926 and 1978. In 1991, the state agreed to build the project by 2011 as part of the settlement of a lawsuit over auto emissions from the Big Dig project. This commitment was changed to design only in 2007‚Äì08 and lifted entirely in 2015. Original plans for the connector in 1986 called for a cut-and-cover extension west from Bowdoin Yard, with Bowdoin station retained without significant modifications. The 2010 Draft Environmental Impact Report instead called for a pair of deeper tunnels bored by a tunnel boring machine (TBM), starting east of Bowdoin station and passing underneath the existing platform. Alternatives with a replacement Bowdoin station west of Bowdoin Street, and without a replacement station, were considered; the latter was recommended due to lower cost and reduced travel time. A 2018 update which analyzed multiple tunneling methods only considered an extension without a replacement Bowdoin station. ==References== ==External links== *MBTA - Bowdoin *Headhouse from Google Maps Street View Category:Beacon Hill, Boston Category:Blue Line (MBTA) stations Category:Government Center, Boston Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1916 Category:Railway stations located underground in Boston Category:West End, Boston ","title":"Bowdoin station"},{"id":"2203813","text":"The Richmond Transit Center is a Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and Amtrak station located in Richmond, California. Richmond is the north terminus of BART service on the Berryessa/North San Jos√©‚ÄìRichmond line and Richmond‚ÄìDaly City/Millbrae line; it is a stop for Amtrak's Capitol Corridor, San Joaquin, and California Zephyr routes. It is one of two transfer points between BART and Amtrak, along with Oakland Coliseum station. The Southern Pacific- controlled Northern Railway opened through what is now Richmond in 1878, but a station was not established until the arrival of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in 1900. The station was closed upon the formation of Amtrak in 1971. Two years later, Richmond became one of the termini of the initial BART system. Amtrak service began in 1978, with a shelter constructed in 1984. A new Amtrak platform was built in 2001, followed by a renovation of the whole station completed in 2007. ==HistorySouthern Pacific and Santa Fe railroads=== The former ATSF station in Richmond, photographed shortly before it was demolished in the 1990s The Southern Pacific-controlled Northern Railway opened through the then-uninhabited swamplands near Point Richmond on January 8, 1878. A stop was soon established at San Pablo, north of what is now Richmond. Passenger service to Richmond started around 1900 when the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) made Port Richmond the west terminus of its transcontinental mainline, where passengers could board ferries to San Francisco. By 1910, the rapidly growing town of Richmond had four train stations: the Southern Pacific (SP) stopped in downtown Richmond near MacDonald Avenue and at Stege south of Potrero Avenue; the ATSF station was at the west end of MacDonald Avenue. Even as intercity rail service began to decline, Richmond was served by SP trains on the Shasta Route, Overland Route, and Central Valley routes, plus ATSF service to the Central Valley. ATSF service ended in 1968 when the Golden Gate was discontinued. SP service to Richmond on the San Joaquin Daylight continued until May 1, 1971, when Amtrak took over intercity passenger service. ===BART=== The BART station in 1976 As early as 1957, Richmond was identified as a likely terminus for a line of a proposed regional rapid transit system. The system was approved by voters in November 1962. The station was originally to be located at 6th and MacDonald west of downtown, but this was changed to 16th and Nevin (along the SP line) to allow construction of a storage yard north of the station and permit future extension. After tension between the Bay Area Rapid Transit District and the city, an agreement to use the latter site was reached in May 1967. BART service to Richmond began on January 29, 1973; it has remained a terminus since. An extension to Crockett was considered in 1991 but not pursued. A \\"rather disquieting\\" mosaic relief by William Mitchell, made of seashells and fiberglass, is located near the BART faregates. ===Intermodal station=== San Francisco Zephyr at the station in 1980 Capitol Corridor train at the station in 2018, with the former shelter at right Unlike other large cities, the Bay Area did not have a convenient transfer location between Amtrak intercity service and local rapid transit; Oakland Central Station was not located near a BART stop. The introduction of the San Joaquin service in 1974 added a third round trip to the SP mainline north of Oakland. The San Joaquin plus the long-distance San Francisco Zephyr and Coast Starlight began stopping at a small side platform near the BART station in late 1977 or early 1978. A station building with an elevator to the BART pedestrian access was built in 1984. Service gradually expanded; a second San Joaquin was added in 1980, and the Capitols service began in 1991. The Coast Starlight ceased to stop at Richmond in April 1996, followed by the California Zephyr (successor to the San Francisco Zephyr) in October 1998. The Amtrak station building was closed on December 1, 1997, though trains continued to stop. On April 12, 2000, BART and the city broke ground on a \\"transit village\\", a large mixed-use transit-oriented development adjacent to the station. In July 2001, the aging Amtrak facility was replaced with a modern island platform with better access to the BART pedestrian tunnel. The $1.9 million project, funded by the state, was intended to improve the station as preparation for the transit village. The developer for the transit village - which included an 800-space garage for BART - was chosen in 2002. A $6.4 million renovation of the station was undergone as part of the transit village project. An \\"industrial post-modern\\" circular canopy was built over the station entrance. The station was officially named the Richmond Transit Center at a dedication ceremony on October 18, 2007. A BART ticket window opened at the station in August 2008, joining seven other major stations in the system. The two intercity trains began stopping at Richmond again on November 8, 2010. However, the Coast Starlight stop was again discontinued on January 14, 2013 because the train was scheduled to arrive at night - if it was several hours late, passengers would be unable to exit through the locked BART tunnel. In 2018, BART and CCJPA installed a \\"courtesy light\\" on the Amtrak platform, which will instruct eastbound Capitol Corridor trains to hold for two minutes if a BART train is arriving to allow passengers to make their connection. ==Station layout== The BART station - a single island platform with two tracks - is located on the east side of the station complex. The Amtrak station - an island platform served by two of the three tracks of the Union Pacific Railroad Martinez Subdivision - is located to its west. An under-track pedestrian tunnel connects the two platforms with entrances on both sides of the tracks. The east side has a BART parking lot; the transit village, bus bays, and parking garage are located near the large canopy on the west side. ==Bus connections== Busway and drop-off area at the station Although Richmond is a terminal station for BART, most connecting regional bus services instead run to El Cerrito del Norte station, which is much closer to I-80. Richmond is served by several local bus services: *AC Transit: local routes 70, 71, 72M, 76, 376; all-night route 800; school routes 607, 668, 675, 684 *Richmond Medical Center: BART-Kaiser Shuttle *Richmond Circular Shuttle A Golden Gate Transit route over the Richmond‚ÄìSan Rafael Bridge connecting Richmond to the agency's main service area in North Bay ran until 2015, when it was combined with a route that terminates at El Cerrito del Norte station. Richmond station is also served by Flixbus intercity buses. ==See also== *List of Bay Area Rapid Transit stations ==ReferencesNotes=== ==External links== *BART - Richmond *Capitol Corridor - Richmond *Amtrak - Richmond *Richmond (RIC)--Great American Stations (Amtrak) Category:Amtrak stations in Contra Costa County, California Category:Bay Area Rapid Transit stations in Contra Costa County, California Category:Bus stations in Contra Costa County, California Category:Buildings and structures in Richmond, California Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1973 Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1978 Category:Transit centers in the United States Category:Former Southern Pacific Railroad stations ","title":"Richmond station (California)"},{"id":"2203826","text":"Catilinarian conspiracy or Catiline conspiracy may refer to: *First Catilinarian conspiracy *Second Catilinarian conspiracy ","title":"Catilinarian conspiracy"},{"id":"2203831","text":"Neospora caninum is a coccidian parasite that was identified as a species in 1988. Prior to this, it was misclassified as Toxoplasma gondii due to structural similarities. The genome sequence of Neospora caninum has been determined by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and the University of Liverpool. Neospora caninum is an important cause of spontaneous abortion in infected livestock. ==Life cycle and transmission== Neospora caninum has a heteroxenous life cycle, with the sexually reproductive stage occurring in the intestine of a definitive host. Until recently, the only known definitive host was the domestic dog. New research has determined that other canids such as coyotes (Canis latrans), gray wolves (Canis lupus), and Australian dingos (Canis lupus dingo) are also definitive hosts. Oocysts passed in the feces of the definitive host, such as canines or canids, are ingested by an intermediate host, such as cattle. After ingestion of an oocyst, motile and rapidly dividing tachyzoites are released. These tachyzoites disseminate throughout the host, and in response to the host immune response, differentiate into bradyzoites, which form cysts in muscle and tissue. Formation of these cysts results in chronic infection of the intermediate host. Ingestion of infected intermediate host tissue by the definitive host completes the life cycle. A second route of transmission is the congenital transmission from mother to offspring. Transplacental transmission (passage from mother to offspring during pregnancy) has also been shown to occur in dogs, cats, sheep and cattle. If the intermediate host acquires the disease during pregnancy, it activates these cysts, and active infection often causes spontaneous abortion. In addition, if the aborted fetus and membranes are then eaten by the definitive host, they cause further infection and the cycle is complete. Other carnivores, for example the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), may also be intermediate hosts, but they are not known to be definitive hosts. Neospora caninum does not appear to be infectious to humans. In dogs, Neospora caninum can cause neurological signs, especially in congenitally infected puppies, where it can form cysts in the central nervous system. The discovery that coyotes are definitive hosts may increase the risk of transmission of N. caninum to domestic livestock as well as to wild ruminants such as white- tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Coyote range now includes most of North and Central America. Studies suggest that the parasite may be widespread among wildlife and that infection cycles cross over between wild and domestic animals. Recent studies have broadened the list of known intermediate hosts to include birds. N. caninum has recently been found to infect domestic chickens and house sparrows (Passer domesticus) which may become infected after ingesting parasite oocysts from the soil. Sparrows, which are common in urban and rural areas, may serve as a food source for wild and domestic carnivores. N. caninum has also been detected in common buzzards (Buteo buteo) and magpies. The presence of birds in cattle pastures has been correlated to higher infection rates in cattle. Birds may be an important link in the transmission of N. caninum to other animals. ==Clinical disease== Neosporosis is an infectious disease for many different canids and cattle. Neuromuscular degeneration was first observed in canines in Norway, which led to hind limb paralysis. Abortion in dairy cattle was also observed as a major cause of disease by neosporosis. Although this disease is worldwide, it is of major concern in the United States, Netherlands, and New Zealand. N. caninum infections have been reported from most parts of the world with studies in the United States, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Estonia, Germany, and Portugal. 12-45% of aborted fetuses from dairy cattle are infected with the organism. Exposure is common in US dairy herds, ranging from 16% to 36% of dairy cows testing positive on serum. The majority of calves that acquire a Neospora infection during gestation are born clinically normal except that they have precolostral antibody titers to Neospora caninum. ==Treatment and control== A notice at the entrance to the field reminds dog owners to keep their pets on leads, keep to the footpath and collect up all dog faeces. Pregnant cattle which eat hay made from grass in these fields have been aborting their calves due to a disease called neosporosis, caused by Neospora caninum. This type of abortion in young cows is very painful, and at present there is no vaccination. In addition to being an important cause of cattle abortions, neosporosis is a significant disease in dogs throughout the world. If the disease is caught early, dogs may be successfully treated with clindamycin and other antiprotozoan drugs. However, the disease is often fatal to young puppies. Preventative vaccines have been tested on cattle. An inactivated vaccine was made commercially available but had mixed results. A live vaccine using attenuated N. caninum tachyzoites has been more successful but is expensive to produce. Other treatment options aim at prevention of the disease. Prevention requires an understanding of the transmission cycle, especially the connection between cattle and dogs (canids). Canids may pick up the parasite from eating infected material and spread the disease through contaminated feces. One control method is to test for the disease and remove infected cattle from the herd. Another method of control is preventing canids from entering the cattle holding area. ==Etymology and History == From the neo- (Latin, \\"new\\") + spora (Greek, \\"seed\\") and canis (Latin, \\"dog\\"), Neospora caninum is a sporozoan parasite that was first described in 1984. == References == == External links == * Neospora caninum genome project * Neosporosis in cattle * Neosporosis * Neosporosis in wildlife Category:Species described in 1988 Category:Conoidasida Category:Dog diseases ","title":"Neospora caninum"},{"id":"2203833","text":"Gulf Islands National Seashore offers recreation opportunities and preserves natural and historic resources along the Gulf of Mexico barrier islands of Florida and Mississippi. The protected regions include mainland areas and parts of seven islands. Some islands along the Alabama coast were originally considered for inclusion, but none are part of the National Seashore. The color of the sand in the region is exceptionally white, as seen in this 1957 photo at Pensacola Beach, Florida, adjacent to the protected area designated in 1971. of the seashore features offshore barrier islands with sparkling white quartz sand beaches (along miles of undeveloped land), historic fortifications, and nature trails. Mainland features near Pensacola, Florida, include the Naval Live Oaks Reservation, beaches, and military forts. All Florida areas are accessible by automobile. The Mississippi District of the seashore features natural beaches, historic sites, wildlife sanctuaries, islands accessible only by boat, bayous, nature trails, picnic areas, and campgrounds. The Davis Bayou Area is the only portion of the National Seashore in Mississippi that is accessible by automobile. Petit Bois, Horn, East Ship, West Ship, and Cat islands are accessible only by boat. The Gulf Islands Wilderness offers special protection, within the seashore, to parts of Petit Bois Island and Horn Island, Mississippi. Considerable damage to public infrastructure occurred as a result of storms during the 2004 and 2005 Atlantic hurricane seasons. In subsequent years, infrastructure was fully repaired. All roadways, parking areas, campgrounds, and visitor centers have been repaired and are fully operational. A few trails and associated boardwalks and dune crossovers were still under repair as of late 2010, especially near the Fort Pickens campground. ==Islands== Horn Island (in Mississippi).

In Florida, the Pickens Campground is a developed one and provides water and electrical hookups for recreational vehicles and tents. Roads are paved throughout the campground, as well as each campsite. The environment is characterized by sand scrub oaks, small brackish ponds, and a remnant pine forest on a barrier island between Pensacola Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. Central restrooms and showers are available. A campground store reopened in late 2010 (after being closed following storm damage from Hurricanes Ivan and Dennis in 2004 and 2005, respectively). There are no sewer hookups at the campsites; however, a dump station is available. Reservations can be made through the \\"ReserveAmerica\\" website from March through October. From November through February, sites are available on a first-come, first-served basis. The campground is located approximately 1.5 miles (2 km) from Fort Pickens itself. In Mississippi, the Davis Bayou Campground is developed, providing water and electrical hookups for recreational vehicles and tents. Roads are paved throughout the campground, as well as each campsite. The environment is characterized by an oak and pine forest adjacent to a brackish bayou connected to Mississippi Sound. Central restrooms and showers are available. There are no sewer hookups at the campsites; however, a dump station is available. Reservations can be made through the \\"ReserveAmerica\\" website. Campsites not previously reserved for the day are available on a first-come, first-served basis. The campground is located at the end of roadway leading through the Davis Bayou Area.

Biographer Jan Swafford describes the Handel Variations as \\"perhaps the finest set of piano variations since Beethoven\\", adding, \\"Besides a masterful unfolding of ideas concluding with an exuberant fugue with a finish designed to bring down the house, the work is quintessentially Brahms in other ways: the filler of traditional forms with fresh energy and imagination; the historical eclectic able to start off with a gallant little tune of Handel's, Baroque ornaments and all, and integrate it seamlessly into his own voice, in a work of massive scope and dazzling variety.\\"Swafford, Jan, Johannes Brahms: A Biography, Vintage Books, 1999, p. 228. ==Background== The Handel Variations were written in September 1861 after Brahms, aged 28, abandoned the work he had been doing as director of the Hamburg women's choir (Frauenchor) and moved out of his family's cramped and shabby apartments in Hamburg to his own apartment in the quiet suburb of Hamm, initiating a highly productive period that produced \\"a series of early masterworks\\".Hofmann, Kurt, \\"Brahms the Hamburg musician 1833‚Äì1862\\", in The Cambridge Companion to Brahms, ed. Michael Musgrave, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1999, pp. 24, 28. Written in a single stretch in September 1861,Brahms, Johannes, Variations for Piano, Urtext Edition, Ed.: Sonja Gerlach, Fing.: Hans-Martin Theopold, G. Henle Verlag HN440, 1988, Foreword. the work is dedicated to a \\"beloved friend\\", Clara Schumann, widow of Robert Schumann. It was presented to her on her 42nd birthday, September 13. At about the same time, his interest in, and mastery of, the piano also shows in his writing two important piano quartets, in G minor and A major. Barely two months later, in November 1861, he produced his second set of Schumann Variations, Op. 23, for piano four hands. From his earliest years as a composer, the variation was a musical form of great interest to Brahms. Before the Handel Variations he had written a number of other sets of variations, as well as using variations in the slow movement of his Op. 1, the Piano Sonata in C major, and in other chamber works. As he appeared on the scene, variations were in decline, \\"little more than a basis for writing paraphrases of favorite tunes\\". In Brahms's work the form once again became restored to greatness. Brahms had been emulating Baroque models for six years or more.Musgrave, Michael, The Music of Brahms, Oxford University Press, 1994, , p. 52. In particular, between the time he wrote his previous Two Sets of Variations for piano, (No. 1, Eleven Variations on an Original Theme, in D major (1857) and No. 2, Fourteen Variations on a Hungarian Melody, in D major (1854)), Op. 21, and the Handel Variations, Op. 24, Brahms did a careful study of \\"more rigorous, complex and historical models, among others preludes, fugues, canons and the then obscure dance movements of the Baroque period.Rink, John, \\"Opposition and integration in the piano music\\", in The Cambridge Companion to Brahms, ed. Michael Musgrave, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1999, p. 85. Two gigues and two sarabandes that Brahms wrote to develop his technique are extant today.Geiringer, Karl, Brahms ‚Äì His Life and Work, Read Books, 2007, , p. 217. The results of these historical studies are seen in his choice of Handel for the theme, as well as his use of Baroque forms, including the Siciliana dance form (Var. 19) from the French school of Couperin and, in general, the frequent use of contrapuntal techniques in many variations. One aspect of his approach to variation writing is made explicit in a number of letters. \\"In a theme for a [set of] variations, it is almost only the bass that has any meaning for me. But this is sacred to me, it is the firm foundation on which I then build my stories. What I do with a melody is only playing around ... If I vary only the melody, then I cannot easily be more than clever or graceful, or, indeed, [if] full of feeling, deepen a pretty thought. On the given bass, I invent something actually new, I discover new melodies in it, I create.\\" The role of the bass is critical. > Identifying the bass as the essence of the theme, ...Brahms advocated using > it to control the structure and character of individual variations and of > the entire set. But by this he apparently did not mean retaining in the > variations the bass line of the theme or even its harmonies ... To invent > something actually new and to discover new melodies in the bass give the > bass a role at once passive and active. While maintaining the structure of > the theme‚Äîthe passive bass, so to speak‚ÄîBrahms may actively create melodies > and figurative patterns (including melodies \\"discovered in\\" the bass), > project different contrapuntal textures, and draw on an expanded harmonic > vocabulary, sometimes interpreting the melody as the bass of the harmony or > regarding major and minor or sharp and flat versions of the same passage as > equally valid and available. The result is a great diversity of expression > and character founded on a relatively strict conception of the \\"given\\" > material.Sisman, Elaine R., \\"Brahms and the Variation Canon\\", 19th-Century > Music, Vol. 14, No. 2 (Autumn, 1990), p. 134. Brahms also took into careful account the character of the theme, and its historical context. Unlike the great model of Beethoven's Diabelli Variations, where the variations departed widely from the character of the theme, Brahms's variations expressed and developed the character of the theme. Because the theme for the Handel variations originated in the Baroque era, Brahms included forms such as a siciliana, a musette, a canon and a fugue.Sisman, p. 141. Still not fully established in his career in 1861, Brahms had to struggle to get the work published. He wrote to Breitkopf & H√§rtel, \\"I am unwilling, at the first hurdle, to give up my desire to see this, my favourite work, published by you. If therefore, it is primarily the high fee that stops you taking it, I will be happy to let you have it for 12 Friedrichsdors or, if this still seems too high, 10 Friedrichsdors. I very much hope you will not think I plucked the initial fee arbitrarily out of the air. I consider this work to be much better than my earlier ones; I think it is also much better adapted to the demands of performance and will therefore be easier to market ...\\"Neunzig, Hands, Peter Sheppard Skaerved, and Mike Mitchell, translated by Mike Mitchell Brahms, Haus Publishing, 2003, , p. 70. The theme of the Handel Variations is taken from an aria in the third movement of Handel's Harpsichord Suite No. 1 in B Major, HWV 434 (Suites de pi√®ces pour le clavecin, published by J. Walsh, London 1733 with five variations). Brahms himself owned a copy of the 1733 First Edition.Littlewood, Julian, The Variations of Johannes Brahms, Plumbago Books, 2004, . The appeal of the aria for Brahms might have been its simplicity: its range is restricted to one octave; the harmony is plain, with every note taken from the B-flat major scale; it \\"made an admirably neutral starting-place\\".Matthews, p. 30. While Handel had written only five variations on his theme, Brahms, with the piano as his instrument rather than the more limited harpsichord, enlarged the scope of his opus to 25 variations ending with an extended fugue. Brahms's use of Handel exemplifies his love of the music of the past and his tendency to incorporate it and transform it in his own compositions. Of the overall concept of the work, Malcolm MacDonald writes \\"Some of Brahms's models in this monumental work are easy enough to identify. In the scale and ambition of his conception both Bach's 'Goldberg' and Beethoven's 'Diabelli Variations' must have exercised a powerful if generalized influence; in specific features of form Beethoven's 'Eroica' Variations is a closer parallel. But the overall structure is original to Brahms.\\" And MacDonald suggests what might have been a more contemporary source of inspiration, the Variations on a Theme of Handel, Op. 26, by Robert Volkmann. \\"Brahms might well have known that large and often admirable work, published as recently as 1856, which Volkmann based on the so-called 'Harmonious Blacksmith' theme from the Air with Variations in Handel's E major Harpsichord Suite.\\"MacDonald, Malcolm, Brahms (The Master Musician Series), J.M. Dent & Sons Ltd., London, 1990, p. 180. ==Structure== In Music, Imagination, and Culture Nicholas Cook gives the following concise description: > \\"The Handel Variations consist of a theme and twenty-five variations, each > of equal length, plus a much longer fugue at the end which provides the > climax of the movement in terms of duration, dynamics, and contrapuntal > complexity. The individual variations are grouped in such a way as to create > a series of waves, both in terms of tempo and dynamics, leading to the final > fugue, and superimposed on this overall organization are a number of > subordinate patterns. Variations in tonic major and minor more or less > alternate with each other; only once is there a variation in another key > (the twenty-first, which is in the relative minor). Legato variations are > usually succeeded by staccato ones; variations whose texture is fragmentary > are in general followed by more homophonic ones. ... the organization of the > variation set is not so much concentric‚Äîwith each variation deriving > coherence from its relationship to the theme‚Äîas edge-related, with each > variation being lent significance by its relationship with what comes before > and after it, or by the group of variations within which it is located. In > other words, what gives unity to the variation set ... is not the theme as > such, but rather a network of 'family resemblances', to use Wittgenstein's > term, between the different variations.\\"Cook, Nicholas, Music, Imagination, > and Culture, Oxford University Press, 1990, , pp. 60‚Äì64. There are various opinions about the organization of the Handel Variations. Hans Meyer, for example, sees the divisions as nos. 1‚Äì8 ('strict'), 9‚Äì12 ('free'), 13 ('synthesis'), 14‚Äì17 ('strict') and 18‚Äì25 ('free'), culminating in the fugue.Rink, p.86. William Horne emphasizes paired variations: nos. 3 and 4, 5 and 6, 7 and 8, 11 and 12, 13 and 14, 23 and 24. This helps him to group the set as 1‚Äì8, 9‚Äì18, 19‚Äì25, with each group ending with a fermata and preceded by one or more variation pairs.Horne, William, in Brahms Studies, Volume 3, translated by David Brodbeck, University of Nebraska Press, 2001, p. 108f. John Rink, focusing on Brahms's dynamic markings, writes, > \\"Brahms takes pains to control the intensity level throughout the twenty- > five variations, maintaining a state of flux in the first half, and then > keeping the temperature perceptibly low after the peak in Variations 13‚Äì15 > until the massive 'crescendo' towards the fugue begins in Variation 23. We > thus find a sensitivity to motion and momentum that complements‚Äîand possibly > transcends in importance to the listener‚Äîthe elegance of structure about > which so many authors have (legitimately) enthused.Rink, pp. 87‚Äì88. Unity is maintained, at least in part, by using Handel's key signature of B major throughout most of the set, varied by only a few exceptions in the tonic minor, and by repeating Handel's four-bar/two-part structure, including the repeats, in most of the work. ===The variations=== The performer of the audio files in this section is Martha Goldstein. right Theme. Aria Handel's theme is divided into two parts, each four bars in length and each repeated. The elegant aria moves in stately quarter notes in time with \\"a ceremonial character typical of its period\\". The harmonic progressions are elementary. Every bar except one has one or two decorations. The melody consists of a one- bar figure in the right hand consisting mostly of a trill and a turn; it is repeated in a rising sequence three times followed by a fourth descending repetition; a decorative flourish finishes the first half of the variation, which is then repeated. The left hand plays solid chords in support throughout, three quarter-note chords to each bar setting the pace followed by a rhythmic eighth-note chord leading to the next bar and emphasizing its first beat. The second half follows a similar pattern, varied mainly by alterations to the turns. right Variation 1 Brahms's first variation stays close to the melody and harmonies of Handel's theme while changing its character completely. It uses staccato throughout and its syncopated accents are distinctly non-Baroque. The dynamic marking poco (a bit louder), too, clearly separates it from Handel's elegant aria. In tempo the variation seems much more hurried, crisp, even dance-like; each time the right hand \\"pauses\\" on an eighth note, the left hand fills in with sixteenth notes. At the end of the two sections, Brahms replaces Handel's decorations with brilliant up- and down-scale runs. right Variation 2 Minor-key inflections in Variations 2 to 4 increase the distance from Handel and lay the groundwork for Variations 5 and 6, in the tonic minor. Variation 2 is a subtle piece with a flowing, lilting rhythm. Complexity is added as Brahms uses a favourite technique, found throughout his works, with triple time in one voice‚Äîin this case, triplets in the right hand‚Äîagainst duple time in the other. While explicitly recalling the melody of Handel's theme, the chromaticism of this variation adds to the sense of a world beyond the Baroque. In the first half the pattern is of phrases rising on the scale with a crescendo, then falling away in a shorter decrescendo. The second half climbs both in pitch and dynamics to a high climax, again falling away quickly. There is a smooth transition to the next variation. right Variation 3 The elegant third variation, marked dolce, moves at a more leisurely pace, providing a sense of calm after two rather busy variations. It also provides a much-needed contrast with the following thunderous variation. Right and left hands alternate and overlap, the left imitating the right in a pattern of three eighth notes. The first note of each group is played staccato, adding to the sense of lightness. The occasional rolled chord adds interest. right Variation 4 The fourth variation, marked risoluto, is a showpiece, with sixteenth notes played in octaves in both hands, strong accents (the sforzandos are frequently emphasized by six-note chords) and climaxes that rise a full octave higher than Handel's theme. The charging, syncopated rhythm places the stress on the last sixteenth note of almost every beat. Although no tempo indications are given, this variation is often performed at great speed. right Variation 5 After the mighty sounds of the previous variation, the lyrical fifth variation begins quietly. The change of mood is emphasized by a shift to the tonic minor (B minor). This is the first variation in a key different from Handel's. Numerous small crescendos and decrescendos underscore the espressivo marking. The melody moves upward at a measured pace in eighth notes while the left hand accompanies with broken chords in sixteenth notes in contrary motion. The mood is peaceful and tranquil. A pairing between this variation and the following one is created by the use of the tonic minor key signature and contrary motion. right Variation 6 Like the preceding variation, this piece is in the tonic minor and features contrary motion, and the motives of the two variations are similar. Marked sempre with legato phrasing, Variation 6 has a hushed, mysterious tone. The pace is measured, as both hands are written mainly in eighth notes with short sequences of sixteenth notes providing variety. Here Brahms uses counterpoint in the form of a two-part canon in octaves, including inverted canon for several measures in the second half. right Variation 7 Echoing the pairing of Variations 5 and 6, the seventh variation is paired with the eighth. Returning to Handel's original B major, Variation 7 is fast, exciting, high-spirited, and fundamentally rhythmic in nature. A sustained drumbeat effect is created by the emphatic repetition of its upper notes and a staccato rhythm throughout all three voices. Because of the repeated upper notes, the focus moves to the inner voices. Numerous accents add further emphasis to the highly rhythmic character of this variation: in some bars in the first half, accents are placed on the last beat of the bar, while in the second half, the accents are yet more numerous, assigned to every beat except the last of each bar. Each half ends in a peak of excitement, marked forte with arpeggios in contrary motion. It leads seamlessly into 8. right Variation 8 Variation 8 continues the rhythmic excitement of Variation 7, the left hand beating out, on the same note over and over, the same anapestic rhythm as the preceding variation. After a few bars, the two voices of the right hand are flipped. A fermata at the close provides a moment of silence before 9 begins and signals the end of the first section. right Variation 9 Variation 9 slows the pace of the series, with a sense of grandeur as both treble and bass move in stately, ominous octaves. The piece is highly chromatic, and, like several earlier variations, treble and bass are in contrary motion throughout. Each two-bar phrase begins with two exclamatory chords, as if sounding an alarm. The variation starts an octave higher than Handel's theme, and its repeated two- bar pattern continually ascends, increasing in tension, until the climax, when it reaches a full two octaves higher than Handel. right Variation 10 In contrast to the preceding number, Variation 10 is Allegro energico, fast and exhilarating. Its rather odd effect sounds almost devoid of melody, as the main notes of the theme are scattered among various registers. The first half consists of a series of startling gestures that begin with large, loud chords ( energetico) in the higher registers followed by echoes progressively lower, ending deep in the bass in a series of single notes played . The second half rushes to a great climax. right Variation 11 After the tension of Variations 7‚Äì10, the next two variations are sweet and melodic. Variation 11 uses counterpoint and has a simple, pleasant air with its rock-steady rhythm in the right hand while the left hand simply plays two notes to one. Variations 11 and 12 are another example of the pairing of variations which is so characteristic of the work. right Variation 12 The quietness and delicacy of Variation 12 prepares for the return of the dark tonic minor in Variation 13. The left hand is similar to Variation 17, in the same rhythm as the left hand of Handel's theme. right Variation 13 Variation 13 returns to the tonic minor in a funereal mood. It is the middle variation of the set and, in the view of Denis Matthews, the emotional centre. Right-hand sixths play against rolled chords in the left, perhaps suggesting muffled drums.Matthews, p. 33. For Tovey the lugubrious tone suggests a \\"kind of Hungarian funeral march\\", while Malcolm MacDonald sees it as \\"florid\\" and \\"a Hungarian fantasia\\". Here Brahms abandons the usual repeat signs because each passage that would have been repeated is instead written an octave higher. Variations 13 and 14, while very different in character, are paired in being fast and exciting and in their use of parallel sixths in the right hand. right Variation 14 Variation 14, marked sciolto (\\"loose\\") breaks the dark mood of Variation 13 and returns to the original key. With its extended trills and scalar runs in sixths in the right hand against broken octaves in the left hand, it is a virtuoso showpiece. The mood is of great energy, excitement, and high spirits. It leads without a break into the following variation. Donald Francis Tovey sees a grouping in Variations 14‚Äì18, which he describes as \\"aris[ing] one out of the other in a wonderful decrescendo of tone and crescendo of Romantic beauty\\".Quoted by Palmer, John, AllMusic.com, accessed on August 14, 2008. right Variation 15 Following without a pause from the previous number, Variation 15, marked forte, is a bravura variation building relentlessly toward an exciting climax. It consists of a one-bar pattern, varied only slightly, of two declamatory chords in eighth notes in the higher registers, followed by lower sixteenth notes that echo Handel's original turns. A prominent upbeat creates syncopated energy. It has been called an √©tude for Brahms's Piano Concerto No. 2. It breaks the structural mould of Handel's theme by adding one \\"extra\\" bar. In Brahms's first autograph, Variations 15 and 16 were positioned in the reverse order.Brahms, Johannes, Handel Variations op. 24, Urtext Edition, G. Henle Verlag HN272, 1978, Preface. right Variation 16 Variation 16 continues from Variation 15 as a \\"variation of variation\\",Musgrave p. 55. repeating the pattern of two high eighth notes followed by a run of lower sixteenth notes. It also forms another pairing with Variation 17. Baroque contrapuntal techniques appear again in this canon, described by Malcolm MacDonald as \\"wittier\\" than the canon of Variation 6. The left hand begins with two descending staccato eighth notes, immediately followed in the opposite hand by the two eighth notes inverted, a full four octaves higher. In each case, a figure in sixteenth notes follows in canonic imitation. The effect is light and exhilarating. right Variation 17 In Variation 17, the absence of the sixteenth notes that were so prominent in the preceding two variations gives the impression of a slowing, despite the marking of pi√π mosso. The effect is of gently falling raindrops, with gracefully descending broken chords in the right hand, piano and staccato, repeated throughout the work at various pitches. Each note is played twice, adding to the suggestion of a leisurely pace. right ; Variation 18. Another \\"variation of a variation\\", paired with the preceding Variation 17. The accompaniment from the previous variation, which now echoes the melody of the aria, is now syncopated and alternating between the hands, while the \\"raindrops\\" are replaced by sweeping arpeggios. right ; Variation 19. This slow, relaxing variation, with its lilting rhythm and time, is written in the dance style of a Baroque French siciliana from the school of Couperin (Brahms had edited Couperin's musicMusgrave, p. 53.). It uses chords almost exclusively in the root position, perhaps as another reminiscence of \\"antique\\" music. In a technique often used by Brahms, the melodic line is hidden in an inner part. This variation opens a lengthy quiet section which includes nos. 19‚Äì22, \\"not noticeably interrelated\\". ; Variation 20. right From the outset, Variation 20 builds toward its climax. In contrast to the preceding variation, there is little of the Baroque in it with its chromaticism in both treble and bass and its thick textures (triads in the right hand against octaves in the left hand). Malcolm MacDonald refers to its \\"organ-loft progressions\\". right ; Variation 21. Variation 21 moves to the relative minor (G minor). Like Variation 19, the theme is hidden, in this case by merely gracing the main notes of the theme in passing, thereby achieving a sense of lightness. It is another example of Brahms' use of polyrhythms, this time pairing three notes against four. right ; Variation 22. The light mood of the preceding variation continues in Variation 22. Often referred to as the \\"musical-box\\" variation because of the regularity of its rhythm, underlined particularly by a drone bass, Variation 22 alludes to the Baroque musette, a soft pastoral air imitating the sound music of a bagpipe, or musette. It remains in the high registers, consistently above Handel's theme, the lowest note being the repeated B of the drone. The light mood prepares the way for the climactic, concluding section which, in Tovey's words, comes \\"swarming up energetically out of darkness\\".Matthews, p. 34. right ; Variation 23. At Variation 23 the rise toward a final climax begins. It is clearly paired with the following Variation 24, which continues its pattern but in a more hurried, more urgent manner. right ; Variation 24. In preparation for the climactic final variation, Variation 24 intensifies the excitement, replacing the triplets of Variation 23 with masses of sixteenth notes. Clearly modeled on the preceding, it is another example of Brahms's use of \\"variation of variation\\". right ; Variation 25. An exultant showpiece, Variation 25 ends the variations and leads into the concluding fugue. Its strong resemblance to Variation 1 ties the set together, as they both feature a left hand which fills the pauses in the right. Fugue The powerful concluding fugue brings the variation set to a climactic close. Its subject, repeated many times from beginning to end, derives from the opening of Handel's theme. At its most microscopic level, the subject comes solely from the ascending major second from the first two beats in the top voice of Handel's theme. The ascending second is stated twice in sixteenth notes and repeated again a major third higher. This parallels the first measure of Handel's theme, which ascends from B to C to D to E. The following melodic line of the second measure resembles the second measure of Handel's theme in general trajectory (Brahms's theme is also strikingly similar to the subject of Fugue VI from Felix Mendelssohn's Six Preludes and Fugues, Op. 35, also in B major). Julian Littlewood observes that the fugue has \\"a dense contrapuntal argument which recalls Bach more than Handel\\". Denis Matthews adds that it is \\"more redolent of one of Bach's great organ fugues than any in The Well-Tempered Clavier, with inversions, augmentation and double counterpoint to match, and a great peroration over a swinging dominant pedal-point\\".Matthews, p. 35. Despite its magnitude, Littlewood suggests, the fugue avoids separation from the rest of the set by its comparable texture. \\"In this way it systematically creates a web of links between past and present, achieving synthesis rather than quotation or parody.\\" Michael Musgrave in The Music of Brahms writes, > \\"Brahms brings his subject, derived, like that of the Diabelli fugue, from > the theme, into contrapuntal relationships involving diminution, > augmentation, stretto, building to the final peroration through a long > dominant pedal with two distinct ideas above. But the pianism is an equal > part of the conception, and in this, the most complex example of Brahms's > virtuoso style, the characteristic spacings in thirds, sixths and wide spans > between the hands are employed as never before. Indeed, the pianistic factor > serves to create the great contrasts within the fugue, which transcends a > traditional fugal movement to create a further set of variations, in which > many of the previous textures are recalled in the context of the equally > transformed fugal theme.\\"Musgrave, pp. 57‚Äì58. 820px 820px 280px ==Reception and aftermath== An entry in Clara Schumann's diary about the Handel Variations gives an idea of how close the relationship between her and Brahms was, as well as Brahms's sometimes extraordinary insensitivity: \\"On Dec 7th I gave another soir√©e, at which I played Johannes' Handel Variations. I was in agonies of nervousness, but I played them well all the same, and they were much applauded. Johannes, however, hurt me very much by his indifference. He declared that he could no longer bear to hear the variations, it was altogether too dreadful for him to listen to anything of his own and to have to sit by and do nothing. Although I can well understand this feeling, I cannot help finding it hard when one has devoted all one's powers to a work, and the composer himself has not a kind word for it.\\"Litzmann, Berthold, Clara Schumann: An Artist's Life Based on Material Found in Diaries and Letters ‚Äì Vol 2, Read Books, 2007, , p. 201. Yet in the following spring (April 1862) Brahms wrote, in a note to a critic to whom he was sending a copy of the work, \\"I am fond of it and value it particularly in relation to my other works\\".Swafford, p. 234. Clara Schumann premiered the work in Hamburg on December 7, when she visited Brahms's home town to give a series of performances, which also included the Piano Concerto No. 1 in D minor‚Äîwhich had not been well received when Brahms introduced it to Leipzig in the Gewandhaus in January 1858‚Äîand the premiere of the Piano Quartet No. 1 in G minor. Clara's performance of the Handel Variations in Hamburg was a triumph, which she repeated soon afterward in Leipzig. During that winter, Brahms also gave performances of the Handel Variations, as a result of which he made minor alterations to the score. Publication came in July 1862 by Breitkopf & H√§rtel. With the \\"complete failure,Matthews, p. 29.\\" as he described it to Clara, of his first large-scale orchestral work, the First Piano Concerto, the Handel Variations became an important landmark in the developing career of Brahms. Another seven years passed before his reputation was firmly established by A German Requiem in Bremen in 1868, and it took a full fifteen years before he made his mark as a symphonist with his first symphony (1876). During what was probably the first meeting of Brahms and Richard Wagner in January 1863, Brahms performed his Handel Variations. Despite the great differences between the two men in musical style and an underlying tension based on musical politics‚ÄîBrahms championing a more conservative approach to music while Wagner, along with Franz Liszt, called for \\"the music of the future\\" with new forms and new tonalities‚ÄîWagner complimented the work graciously, if not wholeheartedly, saying, \\"One sees what still may be done in the old forms when someone comes along who knows how to use them\\".Swafford, p. 267. ==Arrangements== The piece is often heard in a version that was arranged for orchestra by the British composer and Brahms enthusiast Edmund Rubbra in 1938. The orchestration was first performed at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert conducted by Adrian Boult. The ballet Brahms/Handel, made by New York City Ballet balletmaster Jerome Robbins in collaboration with Twyla Tharp, was set to this orchestration. The work has also been transcribed for solo organ by French-Canadian composer Rachel Laurin. ==NotesFree score * Detailed listening guide based on a recording by Martin Jones * Sleeve notes from a recording by Seta Tanyel (free registration required) Category:Compositions by Johannes Brahms Category:Compositions for solo piano Handel Category:1861 compositions Category:Compositions in B-flat major Category:Musical tributes and homages ","title":"Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel"},{"id":"2203870","text":"Bartles & Jaymes original flavor Bartles & Jaymes is a flavored wine cooler and malt beverage line produced by the E & J Gallo Winery in the United States, introduced in 1981, and available in various fruit flavors. ==TV commercials== The product line is remembered for its folksy television commercials, created by Hal Riney, which ran from 1984 to 1991.

Located between Beach Street and Shirley Avenue, it serves the MBTA Blue Line. It serves Revere Beach, a popular summer destination with a substantial year- round resident population. It opened in January 1954 on the site of a former Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad station, as part of an extension to Wonderland. Revere Beach station was closed and rebuilt from 1994 to 1995. Like all Blue Line stations from Airport east, Revere Beach has two tracks and two side platforms. Uniquely among Blue Line stations, it is located below grade in a trench, with a surface-level fare lobby. Entrances to the station are from Beach Street and Shirley Avenue. ==History== Crescent Beach station on a 1910 postcard The narrow gauge Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad (BRB&L;) opened from East Boston to Lynn on July 29, 1875. The line ran directly adjacent to the beachfront, a popular summer destination, on the alignment of the modern Revere Beach Boulevard. Revere station was located between Beach Street and Shirley Avenue. The station was renamed Pavilion in the late 1870s and Crescent Beach in 1884. The Eastern Railroad-backed Boston, Winthrop, and Shore Railroad (BW&S;) operated slightly inland in 1884 and 1885, with its own Crescent Beach station just west of the BRB&L; station. In April 1897, the BRB&L; was moved inland onto the BW&S; right-of-way, with Crescent Beach station relocated to the new alignment. By 1928 the line was electrified, with pre-pay stations - more a rapid transit line than a conventional railroad. However, due to the Great Depression, the BRB&L; shut down on January 27, 1940. ===Rapid transit=== In 1941, the Boston Elevated Railway bought the BRB&L; right of way from Day Square to Revere Beach for use as a high-speed trolley line similar to the Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Line; these plans were delayed by the onset of World War II. The 1926 Report on Improved Transportation Facilities and 1945‚Äì47 Coolidge Commission Report recommended that the East Boston Tunnel line, which had been converted to rapid transit from streetcars in 1924, be extended to Lynn via the BBRB&L; route rather than using it for a trolley line. In 1947, the newly formed Metropolitan Transit Authority (M.T.A.) decided to build to Lynn as a rapid transit line, and construction began in October 1948. The first part of the Revere Extension opened to Orient Heights in January 1952 and Suffolk Downs in April 1952; the second phase (cut short due to limited funds) opened to Wonderland on January 19, 1954 with intermediate stations at Beachmont and Revere Beach. ===Renovations=== Platforms at Revere Beach before 2008 repair work Revere Beach station was closed for approximately one year starting on June 25, 1994 as the station was rebuilt along with Suffolk Downs, Beachmont, and Wonderland stations as part of the Blue Line Modernization Program. Blue Line service temporarily ended at Orient Heights and buses served the closed stations during the project (second page) Revere Beach station was largely rebuilt at a cost of $9.8 million; it reopened along with the other stations on June 24, 1995. (second page) The station was closed while additional platform repair work was performed from August 2 through 29, 2008. ==References== ==External links== *MBTA - Revere Beach * Beach Street entrance from Google Maps Street View * Shirley Avenue entrance from Google Maps Street View Category:Blue Line (MBTA) stations Category:Former Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad stations Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1954 Category:Railway stations in Suffolk County, Massachusetts Category:1954 establishments in Massachusetts Category:Revere, Massachusetts ","title":"Revere Beach station"},{"id":"2203911","text":"Claude Schnell (born 17 May 1955 in Brooklyn, New York) is an American keyboardist who has been a member of the bands Magic,Note: The band Magic that Claude Schnell was a member of wasn't the band which released the song \\"Rude\\".

Whitlock is a sportswriter for Outkick the Coverage and a former columnist at the Kansas City Star, AOL Sports and Foxsports.com, as well as a radio personality for WHB and KCSP sports stations in the Kansas City area. Whitlock played Division I college football at Ball State as an offensive lineman. ==Journalism careerEarly career=== Whitlock's first job was working part-time for The Herald-Times in Bloomington, Indiana. His first full-time job was as a reporter for The Charlotte Observer. After approximately one year there, he joined the Ann Arbor News in 1992 and spent two years covering the University of Michigan. ===Kansas City Star=== In 1994, Whitlock was hired by The Kansas City Star. In 1998, Whitlock was suspended for heckling fans at a Kansas City Chiefs game. The Scripps Howard Foundation awarded Whitlock its National Journalism Award for commentary on March 7, 2008. Whitlock was the first sportswriter to win the award and $10,000 prize. On August 16, 2010, the Kansas City Star announced Whitlock's departure from that paper. ===ESPN=== In 2002, Whitlock started writing columns for ESPN.com's Page 2. Whitlock had guest-hosted several ESPN TV shows, including Jim Rome Is Burning, and Pardon the Interruption. He was a regular fill-in host on The Jim Rome Show on Premiere Radio Networks. He also appeared regularly on ESPN's The Sports Reporters Outside the Lines. ===Leaving ESPN for AOL Sports=== In 2006, Whitlock announced the departure of his online column from ESPN.com's Page 2 in favor of AOL Sports, but initially expected to continue his television work for ESPN. However, after the announcement, Whitlock was interviewed by sports blog The Big Lead, and disparaged two of his ESPN colleagues. Whitlock labeled Mike Lupica \\"an insecure, mean-spirited busybody\\", and called Robert \\"Scoop\\" Jackson a \\"clown\\", saying that \\"the publishing of Jackson's fake ghetto posturing is an insult to black intelligence.\\" Jackson, like Whitlock, is African-American. Whitlock then disappeared from all ESPN television work. He soon announced to The Kansas City Star readers in September 2006 that he was fired altogether from ESPN as a result of his remarks; he wrote that the company doesn't tolerate criticism and acted as they saw fit. Whitlock's first AOL Sports column was published September 29, 2006. ===Fox Sports=== Whitlock's first Fox Sports on MSN column was published August 16, 2007. On February 10, 2012, in the middle of the Knicks' 92‚Äì85 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, with Jeremy Lin scoring a career-high 38 points, Whitlock posted on Twitter, stating that \\"some lucky lady in NYC is gonna feel a couple inches of pain tonight.\\" Silvie Kim wrote in Hyphen that Whitlock \\"reinforced the insipid and insidious 'small Asian penis' stereotype. The Asian American Journalists Association demanded an apology. Later, Whitlock said, \\"I debased a feel-good sports moment. For that, I'm truly sorry.\\" ===Return to ESPN=== Whitlock originally expected to be an integral part of the launching of the Fox Sports 1 sports television channel in August 2013, but then came to feel that television work would come at the expense of his writing. Therefore, upon meeting with ESPN President John Skipper, Whitlock decided to leave Fox Sports and accept Skipper's offer to return to ESPN. His new website 'The Undefeated.com' was scheduled to launch on ESPN.com sometime in the summer of 2015. After over a year and a half of delays, ESPN announced that Whitlock would no longer serve as the editor in chief for 'The Undefeated', replaced on an interim basis by Leon Carter, the editorial director for the site. In October 2015, Whitlock's employment at ESPN ended. ===Return to Fox, including Fox News and Sports=== In 2016, Whitlock began a new show airing on Fox Sports 1, Speak for Yourself with Cowherd and Whitlock. Cowherd was replaced by former Buffalo Bills defensive end Marcellus Wiley in 2018, and the show was rebranded as Speak for Yourself with Whitlock and Wiley. On June 1, 2020, it was announced that Fox would not renew Whitlock's contract after the two sides couldn't come to an agreement. He is currently a co-host alongside Clay Travis on the show OutKick the Coverage. ===Other work=== Whitlock has also been published in Vibe, Playboy, and The Sporting News. In the June 2008 issue of Playboy, he wrote a 5,000-word column questioning America's incarceration and drug-war policies. Playboy headlined the column \\"The Black KKK\\", which provoked Whitlock into writing two columns, one in the Kansas City Star and another on Foxsports.com, criticizing Playboy editorial director Chris Napolitano for the misleading and inflammatory headline. ==References== ==External links== *National Journalism Award Winners 2008 *In KC, it's no time for a game * * Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:African-American writers Category:Writers from Indianapolis Category:American sports radio personalities Category:American sportswriters Category:Ball State Cardinals football players Category:Ball State University alumni Category:People from Overland Park, Kansas Category:Sportspeople from Indianapolis Category:The Kansas City Star people Category:ESPN people Category:Writers from Los Angeles Category:Players of American football from Indiana Category:Writers from Kansas City, Missouri Category:Radio personalities from Kansas City, Missouri Category:Radio personalities from Los Angeles Category:Fox Sports 1 people Category:Male YouTubers Category:American YouTubers Category:News YouTubers Category:Commentary YouTubers Category:Criticism of political correctness ","title":"Jason Whitlock"},{"id":"2203926","text":"Bay Fair is a Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) station located adjacent to the Bayfair Center mall in San Leandro, California.

Micronemes: mn (click to enlarge) Micronemes are secretory organelles, possessed by parasitic apicomplexans. Micronemes are located on the apical third of the protozoan body. They are surrounded by a typical unit membrane. On electron microscopy they have an electron-dense matrix due to the high protein content. They are specialized secretory organelles important for host- cell invasion and gliding motility. These organelles secrete several proteins such as the Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen-1, or PfAMA1, and Erythrocyte family antigen, or EBA, family proteins. These proteins specialize in binding to erythrocyte surface receptors and facilitating erythrocyte entry. Only by this initial chemical exchange can the parasite enter into the erythrocyte via actin-myosin motor complex. It has been posited that this organelle works cooperatively with its counterpart organelle, the rhoptry, which also is a secretory organelle. It is possible that, while the microneme initiates erythrocyte-binding, the rhoptry secretes proteins to create the PVM, or the parasitophorous vacuole membrane, in which the parasite can survive and reproduce. ==See also== * Dense granule * Rhoptry ==espermas== Category:Parasitology ","title":"Microneme"},{"id":"2203931","text":"\\"Entrance of the Gladiators\\" op. 68 or \\"Entry of the Gladiators\\" () is a military march composed in 1897 by the Czech composer Julius Fuƒç√≠k. He originally titled it \\"Grande Marche Chromatique\\", reflecting the use of chromatic scales throughout the piece, but changed the title based on his personal interest in the Roman Empire. Generally, the march is divided into three parts. The first part contains the melody that the trumpet keeps and the several supporting parts. The second third is the section where the low brass (mainly the tubas) take over with the chromatic scale like role. Finally there is a trio, or a softer melodic section, where there is a strong balance between woodwinds and low brass. The trio has a part similar to the second third with a chromatic scale-like sound. The piece is written in cut time and is originally written to be played at standard march tempo, but when played as a screamer it is usually played much faster. ==History== Music composer Julius Fuƒç√≠k Czech composer Julius Fuƒç√≠k wrote the march on October 17, 1899 in Sarajevo, where he had been stationed as military bandmaster of the Austro- Hungarian Army since 1897. Originally, he called the piece Grande Marche Chromatique. The march demonstrates the state of the art in playing technology and the construction of brass instruments, which allowed fast and even chromatic gears in all instruments and positions. Fuƒç√≠k was so impressed by the description of a gladiator appearance in a Roman amphitheater in Henryk Sienkiewicz's 1895 novel Quo Vadis that he soon changed the title of his work. The phrase \\"entry of the gladiators\\" is known in two descriptions of Pompeii in 1877 and is probably older. On January 10, 1900 Kapellmeister Anton Fridrich (1849‚Äì1924, Khevenh√ºller-Marsch) created an arrangement for string orchestra for himself in Graz. In July 1900, the \\"Concert March for large orchestra\\", published by Hoffmann‚Äôs widow in Prague, is listed under the title Einzug der Gladiatoren by Hofmeister. Further edits followed. In 1903 one of the H.M. Coldstream Guard Band's pre-recorded clay roller advertised by Columbia Records titled Entry of the Gladiators. In the same year a piano score with the title Entry of the Gladiators / Thunder and Blazes ('Donner und Feuersbr√ºnste') was released. The phrase Entrance of the Gladiators, which has existed since at least the 18th century, is also common in English. Hermann Ludwig Blankenburg published his farewell to the gladiators at the latest in 1904. In 1928, both pieces were recorded by the \\"Great Odeon Orchestra\\" on a plate (No. 85204). ==Versions== In 1901, the Canadian composer Louis-Philippe Laurendeau rewrote the piece, used a faster tempo and a different key and published it as Thunder and Blazes. Laurendeau often worked for Carl Fischer Music in New York. Americans are used to hearing the march at a much faster pace. The piece became known in the North American circus and imported back to Europe. Especially in a very fast version, it is the most famous circus music for clowns. It is also often found in the repertoire of mechanical music automatons. In 1901, American publisher Carl Fischer published a version of this march, arranged for American wind bands by Canadian composer Louis- Philippe Laurendeau, under the title \\"Thunder and Blazes\\". It was during this period that the piece gained lasting popularity as a screamer march for circuses, often used to introduce clowns. Today it is known mainly by this association. Laurendeau's version was also transcribed for fairground organs. The Julius Fuƒç√≠k's Entrance of the Gladiators is also quoted in the 1963 novelty song \\"Yakety Sax\\", which have been parodied in many movies and TV shows, including V for Vendetta, Doctor Who, The Simpsons, Family Guy, and South Park. The march receives the occasional concert hall performance, such as at the 2007 Last Night of the Proms. ==See also== * Circus music ==ReferencesCategory:Compositions by Julius Fuƒç√≠k Category:1897 compositions Category:Military marches Category:Circus music ","title":"Entrance of the Gladiators"},{"id":"2203935","text":" The second USS Oneida was a screw sloop-of-war in the United States Navy. During the Civil War, she destroyed the CSS Governor Moore and served in blockade operations. She was attached to the Asiatic Squadron from 1867‚Äì1870. She sank in 1870 outside Yokohama, Japan after collision with the British steamer Bombay. A court of inquiry, headed by the local British consul, found the officers of Oneida were responsible for the collision, with Bombay's captain being blamed for not staying at the scene to render assistance - a decision that caused some controversy.The Morning Post, 5 July 1870, page 5, column 1. A less exhaustive U.S. naval court of inquiry laid the blame entirely on the Bombay's actions. Japanese fishing boats saved 61 sailors but 125 men lost their lives. The American government made no attempt to raise the wreck and sold it to a Japanese wrecking company. The company recovered many bones from the wreck and interred them at their own expense. The Japanese erected a memorial tablet on the grounds of Ikegami Temple in Tokyo and held a Buddhist ceremony in the sailor's memory in May 1889. == Construction == Oneida was authorized by Act of Congress, February 1861, and built at the New York Navy Yard; launched 20 November 1861; and commissioned 28 February 1862, Captain Samuel Phillips Lee in command. ==Service historyCivil War, 1862‚Äì1865=== Shortly after commissioning Oneida sailed from New York and joined the West Gulf Blockading Squadron commanded by Flag officer David Farragut. On 24 April 1862 she participated in the attacks on Forts Jackson and St. Philip below New Orleans, Louisiana, and drove off the Confederate ram which sank the steam gunboat . Oneida destroyed the gunboat CSS Governor Moore in a following engagement on the same date. On 27 April 1862 Oneida destroyed obstructions in the Mississippi River above Carrollton, Mississippi, helping prepare the way for the Vicksburg campaign. In both passages of the Confederate works at Vicksburg, Mississippi ‚Äì on 28 June 1862 and 15 July 1862 ‚Äì by the Union fleet under Rear Admiral Farragut, Oneida was second in line. On 7 August 1862, under the command of Commander George H. Preble, Oneida collided with the steamer Whiteman or Lewis Whitman (sources differ) loaded with dead and wounded troops from the Battle of Baton Rouge, including the body of Brigadier General Thomas Williams, on the Mississippi River near Donaldsonville, Louisiana; the steamer sank with the loss of all hands.Gaines, W. Craig, Encyclopedia of Civil War Shipwrecks, Louisiana State University Press, 2008, , p. 104.] Early in September 1862, Oneida failed in an attempt to stop the passage of the Confederate States Navy sloop-of-war CSS Florida into Mobile, Alabama. From 15 October 1863 to 23 August 1864, under the command of Captain C. V. Gridley, Oneida served in blockade operations off Mobile, where on 5 August she participated in the Battle of Mobile Bay and the subsequent capture of CSS Tennessee. At a later date she witnessed the surrender of Fort Morgan at Mobile. Oneida decommissioned on 11 August 1865 at New York City. Seven sailors and one Marine from Oneida were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions at the Battle of Mobile Bay. These men were: * Quartermaster John E. Jones * Coxswain Thomas Kendrick * Landsman David Naylor * Ordinary Seaman William D. Newland * Landsman John Preston * Sergeant James S. Roantree (USMC) * Quartermaster James Sheridan * Seaman Charles B. Woram In late June 1865, shortly after the conclusion of the Civil War, the sternwheel paddle steamer Echo No. 2 struck Oneida‚Ä≤s prow and sank in the Ohio River near Cairo, Illinois, while carrying 300 soldiers of the 13th and 41st Ohio Veteran Volunteer Regiments. The regiments lost rations and a combined 10 horses and 13 mules in the sinking. The soldiers blamed the pilot guiding Echo No. 2 for the accident and beat him.* Gaines, W. Craig, Encyclopedia of Civil War Shipwrecks, Louisiana State University Press, 2008, , p. 135.] ===Asiatic Squadron, 1867‚Äì1870=== Gravestone to the dead of the U.S.S. Oneida on the grounds of Ikegami Temple in Tokyo. There was once metal lettering on the stone, but they were apparently pried off and melted for the war effort during World War II.Recommissioned in May 1867, she was attached to the Asiatic Squadron and continued in that capacity until January 1870. Oneida departed from Yokohama, Japan on 24 January 1870, on passage back to the United States. Some 12 miles into this voyage, she was struck by the British Peninsula & Oriental steamer Bombay, at 6:30 pm near Saratoga Spit. The Court of Inquiry unanimously held that the officers of Oneida were entirely to blame for the collision. The Oneida was under the command of an inexperienced junior officer whilst the senior officers were at dinner. On seeing a light ahead, this young officer had sought the advice of a navigating officer who briefly came on deck and then returned to dinner. Confusing helm orders were given on Oneida, with the result that Bombay's efforts to avoid collision were in vain and she struck Oneida at an angle of 45 degrees, abaft the mizzen chains. The starboard quarter was cut off Oneida and she sank at 6:45 pm in 20 fathoms (37 m) of water with the loss of 125 men, 61 sailors being saved in two Japanese fishing boats. The loss of life on the Oneida was compounded by a shortage of boats: 3 of the ship's boats had been lost in a typhoon the previous August and not replaced, 2 were destroyed in the collision, leaving only 2, which were lowered immediately. There is controversy over the subsequent actions of Captain Eyre of the Bombay. He was accused of steaming on without rendering assistance. He had his certificate suspended for 6 months by the Court of Inquiry and the ship itself was libeled, meaning that steamer and other ships of the P.& O. Line were kept away from American ports. The findings of the Inquiry were debated in the House of Commons, with speakers making clear that Bombay remained at the position of the collision for, by varying reports, between 5 or 6 minutes and 10 or 12 minutes, whilst Oneida carried on under full sail and steam, with a full tide under her. No indication of distress from Oneida were seen or heard on Bombay (Oneida's crew admitted they did not show any blue lights), it would have been time-consuming to turn the ship in a narrow channel, making the provision of any useful help impossible, and the position of Oneida was not clear as she was not showing any lights. Furthermore, there was damage to Bombay, with 9 feet of water in the forward compartment, the ship was 18 years old and carrying a number of passengers. The wreck of the Oneida was sold at public auction at Yokohama 9 October 1872, to Mr. Tatchobonaiya. Inside the wreckage were found many of the bones of the dead sailors, which were interred, at the expense of the salvagers, on the grounds of Ikegami Temple in Tokyo. In Jinrikisha Days in Japan (1891), Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore tells the story, writing: :...[the American] government made no effort to raise the wreck or search it, and finally sold it to a Japanese wrecking company for fifteen hundred dollars. The wreckers found many bones of the lost men among the ship's timbers, and when the work was entirely completed, with their voluntary contributions they erected a tablet in the Ikegami grounds to the memory of the dead, and celebrated there the impressive Buddhist segaki (feast of hungry souls), in May 1889. The great temple was in ceremonial array; seventy-five priests in their richest robes assisted at the mass, and among the congregation were the American admiral and his officers, one hundred men from the fleet, and one survivor of the solitary boat's crew that escaped from the Oneida. :The Scriptures were read, a service was chanted, the Sutra repeated, incense burned, the symbolic lotus-leaves cast before the altar, and after an address in English by Mr. Amenomori explaining the segaki, the procession of priests walked to the tablet in the grounds to chant prayers and burn incense again. ==Current status== According to records regarding the Oneida, she was leaving port carrying payment for sales of ammunition and gunpowder to the Japanese government. Around 1955, Takeshita Hisao led an effort to salvage the loaded payment, as well as other artifacts from the Oneida wreck. Artifacts including coins, ammunition shells, rifles, and further bones from deceased sailors and passengers were found. The recovered steam gauge was later donated to the United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka. In 2010, a special aired 9 November on Fuji Television made a further effort at salvage with the help of Takeshita's family and one of the divers from the 1955 effort. The show's salvage team located a shipwreck that matched descriptions of the Oneida, and efforts continue to discover more about the wreckage and remaining contents. ==See also== *Union Navy *Confederate Navy *List of sloops of war of the United States Navy *List of shipwrecks in 1870 *Bibliography of early American naval history *Roll of Honor ==References== Category:Sloops of the United States Navy Category:Ships built in Brooklyn Category:Ships of the Union Navy Category:Gunboats of the United States Navy Category:American Civil War patrol vessels of the United States Category:Ships sunk in collisions Category:1861 ships Category:Shipwrecks in Tokyo Bay Category:Maritime incidents in August 1862 Category:Maritime incidents in June 1865 Category:Maritime incidents in 1870 ","title":"USS Oneida (1861)"},{"id":"2203940","text":"Tachyzoites of Toxoplasma gondii, transmission electron microscopy.

They are also found in Entamoeba. Dense granules play a major role in Toxoplasma gondii. When the parasite invades it releases its dense granules which help to create the parasitophorous vacuole.D√≠az-Mart√≠n, R.D., Mercier, C., G√≥mez de Le√≥n, C.T. et al. Parasitol Res (2019). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00436-019-06298-7 ==In multicellular organismsComponents=== The dense granules of human platelets contain adenosine diphosphate (ADP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), ionized calcium (which is necessary for several steps of the coagulation cascade), and serotonin. Dense granules are similar to lysosomes with an acidic pH and even some lysosomal proteins like CD63.Sharda, A., & Flaumenhaft, R. (2018). The life cycle of platelet granules. F1000Research, 7, 236. doi:10.12688/f1000research.13283.1 There is a granular adenine nucleotide pool within the dense granule. It is thought that it is made up of system of insoluble calcium. This pool is likely to be different than that of the cytoplasmic nucleotides. In some animals it has been shown that the platelets contain histamine. During exocytosis, the pool of ATP within the dense granule is released. Serotonin is picked up by the dense granules where it interacts with ATP and calcium. The serotonin that is then released by the dense granule, recruits other platelets and helps play a major role in stopping the loss of blood at the injury. The calcium from a dense granule accounts for the majority of the calcium within the platelets and plays a role in the binding of different proteins. ===Clinical significance=== A deficiency of CD63 can be associated with Hermansky‚ÄìPudlak syndrome. The patients with this disease show signs of abnormal dense granules and melanosomes which can cause prolonged bleeding and albinism. Chediak- Higashi syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder where patients platelets have a deficient amount of dense granules. CHS is very similar to beige mouse. === Biogenesis === The dense granule is very important in the coagulation cascade because of the bleeding disorders caused by a dense granule deficiency. However, the exact details of how it created is unknown. It has been observed that they are produced in bone marrow by megakaryocytes. Within the megakaryocytes it is thought that their production has something to do with the endocytotic pathway. Dense granules have their components sent to maturing dense granules using vesicular nucleotide transporters. This is what is thought to cause the build up of ADP/ATP in dense granules. This mechanism is also responsible for the build up of MRP4 which picks up cAMP for the dense granule. Mice with MRP4-/- will have dysfunctional platelets from cAMP not being takin up from the cytosol and placed into the dense granule. === Membrane === There are a number of proteins that are within the dense granule membrane. To maintain the low pH within the granule, there is a Hydrogen ion pumping ATPase. Ral has been found within the granule's membrane. There are several adhesive receptors that have luminal binding domains and are expressed post exocytosis. These adhesive receptors help the adhesive receptors on the surface of the platelets. One of these receptors is GPIb. GPIb is one of the more important receptors within platelets. === Function === The true function of a dense granule is still unknown. However, the secretion of dense granules occurs along with platelet activation. Both, ADP and collagen can cause the secretion of dense granules. Patients and mice with dense granule deficiency have a harder time forming a hemostatic plug and therefore have a longer bleed time. == Detection == The dense granules' matrix is dense with electrons that allow them to be detected through whole mount electron microscopy. The calcium levels within the dense granule allows for no extra staining when viewing the dense granule with an electron microscope. When observed by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), these granules are osmophilic. The secretion of dense granules can be detected by seeing how much ATP/ADP is being released with luciferase-based luminescence. The relationship to ATP/ADP released can be used to then determine the secretion of dense granules. Another option is to observe the amount of serotonin being released from a platelet with a large amount of serotonin already on it. Another way to detect the secretion of dense granules is through flow cytometry. Since dense granules have surface membrane proteins, the activation of CD63 and LAMP-2 can be observed with flow cytometry. ==See also== * Platelet alpha-granule * Dense bodies ==References== Category:Organelles ","title":"Dense granule"},{"id":"2203967","text":"CpG can be: *CpG site - methylated sequences of DNA significant in gene regulation *CpG Oligodeoxynucleotide - unmethylated sequences of DNA that have immunostimulatory properties *CpG island - regions of DNA that contain several CpG sites ","title":"CpG"},{"id":"2203979","text":"Community College is a rapid transit station on the MBTA Orange Line in Boston, Massachusetts.

Only the west platform is in use; inbound (southbound) tracks use the west track, with outbound trains using the center track. The east platform and track are not used for revenue service. A fare mezzanine is located over the tracks at the south end of the station. The mezzanine is connected to the north sidewalk of the Gilmore Bridge, which carries Austin Street over the Orange Line and the North Station approach tracks. A footbridge also connects the mezzanine directly to BHCC. ==HistoryPrevious stations=== Thompson Square station around 1970 For much of the 19th century, the four major northside railroads (the Fitchburg, Boston and Lowell (B&L;), Boston and Maine (B&M;), and Eastern) did not share any trackage on the approach to Boston. (Not until North Union Station in 1893 did they share a depot). At that time, Charlestown was separated from East Cambridge by a large cove, Millers River. The Fitchburg crossed the B&M; and the Eastern at Prison Point (then the site of a substantial state prison), near the modern location of Community College station. The Fitchburg and B&M; had substantial freight depots nearby, and the B&M; briefly had a Charlestown station around the 1850s. The Fitchburg's Charlestown station was to the west nearer East Cambridge: at what is now Linwood Street by the 1850s, and near what is now Water Street (near the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility) by the 1890s. (For some period after the Boston terminal replaced the Charlestown terminal in 1848, however, a flag stop was made at the Prison Point Bridge.) The Charlestown Elevated section of the Boston Elevated Railway's Main Line opened in June 1901, with three elevated stations in Charlestown. The Thompson Square station was located one- third of a mile east of the current station along Austin Street at Main Street, while the City Square station was located half a mile south along Rutherford Avenue at Chelsea Street. The elevated was unpopular with many local residents, as it was noisy and blocked out sunlight to Main Street. In 1917, the elevated structure was slated to be replaced with a more permanent subway line along the same Main Street routing, but this project was canceled by the US's entry into World War I. ===Community College station=== The unused east platform in 2013 In the late 1960s, the MBTA began work on the Haymarket North Extension project. It included a tunnel segment north from Haymarket through a new underground stop at North Station, then under the Charles River to a portal south of the Gilmore Bridge. From there, the extension was built along the Haverhill Line commuter rail right of way. Community College station was built to replace the two elevated stops nearby in Charlestown. The new route opened to Sullivan Square on April 7, 1975. The Main Line had previously been renamed as the Orange Line in 1967, as part of a systemwide rebranding by the newly formed MBTA. Like the Sullivan Square and Wellington stations, Community College was built with a second island platform serving the outbound track plus a third express track. This extra infrastructure was to be used for the Orange Line's planned extension to Reading to replace commuter rail service on the line. (Continuing commuter rail service to Andover and Haverhill was to be via the Wildcat Branch). However, the Orange Line extension was cut short to Oak Grove due to local opposition in Melrose, and no express service ever ran. The second platform is open for outbound passengers at busy Sullivan Square and Wellington, but at less-busy Community College it sits unused. Unlike the four other original stations on the Haymarket North Extension, Community College was not built with a busway. Bus routes in East Cambridge already terminated at Lechmere station to the west, while Charlestown routes and already extended to Haymarket station along historic streetcar routings. Routes and , which had terminated at City Square, were not extended to Community College; route 111 was instead extended to Haymarket, while route 112 was rerouted to . In December 1975, outbound trips on route 92 were rerouted to Rutherford Avenue between Austin Street and School Street to serve BHCC and the station. However, it returned to its previous routing by December 1977. In 1987, the MBTA considered construction of a parking garage at the station. The station was not originally accessible. An elevator to the main platform, reached by a footbridge between the platforms, was constructed as part of the Big Dig. Bidding took place in 2002. Shaft framework was installed for the unused second platform, but no elevator machinery was installed. The renovations were completed around 2005. ==References== ==External links== *MBTA - Community College *Austin Avenue entrance from Google Maps Street View Category:Orange Line (MBTA) stations Category:Railway stations in Boston Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1975 Category:Charlestown, Boston Category:Railway stations in Massachusetts at university and college campuses ","title":"Community College station"},{"id":"2203981","text":"USS Oneida has been the name of more than one United States Navy ship, and may refer to: * , a brig commissioned in 1810, sold in 1815, repurchased, and sold again in 1825 * , a screw sloop of war in commission from 1862 to 1865 and from 1867 until wrecked in 1870 * , a patrol vessel in commission from April to September 1898 and during September 1912 and in commission as USS Henry P.

Many variations of his last name are seen and he is sometimes incorrectly called Johan Wessel. Gansfort has been called one of the reformers before the Reformation. He protested against a perceived paganizing of the papacy, superstitious and magical uses of the sacraments, the authority of ecclesiastical tradition, and the tendency in later scholastic theology to lay greater stress, in a doctrine of justification, upon the instrumentality of the human will than on the work of Christ for man's salvation. ==Early life and education== Gansfort was born at Groningen. After initial schooling at the local Latin school of St Martin's, he was educated at the municipal school of Zwolle, which was closely connected to the Brethren of the Common Life in whose house the young student lived. He developed close ties with the monastery of Mount St. Agnes not far from Zwolle, and became close friends with Thomas a Kempis. George Williams,The Radical Reformation, Third Edition, 2000, p. 99 His sixteenth-century biographer Albertus Hardenberg, who knew Gansfort's one-time famulus Goswinus van Halen, writes that Gansfort left Zwolle directly for Cologne, perhaps as late as 1449. At Cologne he stayed in the Bursa Laurentiana, where he soon became a teacher. He was granted the degree magister artium in 1452, and remembers with great gratitude that it was here that he first studied Plato. He learned Greek from monks who had been driven out of Greece, and Hebrew from some Jews. He was particularly interested in the Eucharistic theology of Rupert von Deutz, and he scoured local Benedictine libraries for works related to this devotion. ===Work=== Interest in the disputes between the realists and the nominalists in Paris induced him to go to that city, where he remained for sixteen years as a scholar and teacher. There, he eventually took the nominalist side, prompted as much by his mystical anti-ecclesiastical tendencies as by any metaphysical insight; for the nominalists were then the anti-papal party. A desire to know more about humanism sent him to Rome, where in 1470 he was the intimate friend of Italian scholars and under the protection of Cardinals Bessarion and Francesco della Rovere (general of the Franciscan order and afterwards Pope Sixtus IV). It is said that Sixtus would have gladly made Wessel a bishop, but that he had no desire for any ecclesiastical preferment but rather asked for a Hebrew Old Testament. This he took to Groningen, where he studied the text aloud to the bemusement of his fellow monks. From Rome, Wessel returned to Paris and speedily became a famous teacher, gathering round him a band of enthusiastic young students, among whom was Reuchlin. In 1475, he was at Basel and, in 1476, at Heidelberg, teaching philosophy in the university. As old age approached, he grew to dislike the theological strife of scholasticism and turned away from that university discipline, non studia sacrarum literarum sed studiorum commixtae corruptiones. After thirty years of academic life, he returned to his native Groningen, and spent the rest of his life partly as director of the Olde Convent, a sister convent of the Order of Tertiaries, and partly in the convent of St. Agnes at Zwolle. He was welcomed as the most renowned scholar of his time, and it was fabled that he had travelled through all lands, Egypt as well as Greece, gathering everywhere the fruits of all sciences. To his friends, disciples and admirers, he imparted his rhetorical spirituality, a zeal for higher learning and the deep devotional spirit which characterized his own life. He died on October 4, 1489, with the confession on his lips: \\"I know only Jesus the crucified\\". He was buried in the middle of the choir of the church of the Olde Convent, which stood on what is now called the Rode Weeshuistraat but at the time was known as the Straat van de Geestelijke Maagden, whose director he had been. His bones were unearthed in 1862 in the presence of Gansfort's progeny, members of the American Gansevoort family. His remains were then relocated to the Martinikerk where a memorial had been erected. In 1962 his remains were unearthed again and taken to the Groningen anatomical laboratory for research. In absence of the main researcher, the bones were wrongly identified and for over 50 years were thought to have been destroyed. They were rediscovered in 2015 and to be reburied in the Martinikerk in 2017. ==Reputation and influence== The founders of the Protestant University of Groningen in 1614 considered Wessel Gansfort one of their intellectual predecessors, together with Rudolph Agricola (1444‚Äì85) and Regnerus Praedinius (1510‚Äì59). Early editions of works by Gansfort (e.g. Zwolle 1522, Basel 1523, Groningen 1614, Marburg 1617) on their title page call him the learned light of the world (Lux mundi). ==Works== ;Individual works Gansfort's major works are: *De oratione et modo orandi *Scala meditationis *De causis incarnationis *De dignitate et potestate ecclesiastica There are also: *De providentia *De causis et effectibus incarnationis et passionis *De sacramente, poenitentiae *Quae sit vera communio sanctorum *De purgatorio *De sacramento Eucharisti√¶ et audienda missa Several of his letters survive. Some his works are said to have been burned by his friends shortly after his death for fear of ecclesiastical inquisition. ;Collections *Farrago rerum theologicarum is the title of a collection of his writings published at Zwolle, probably in 1521 (reprinted at Wittenberg, 1522, and Basel, 1522, which last contains a preface by Luther). Martin Luther in 1521 published a collection of Wessel's writings which had been preserved as relics by his friends, and said that if he (Luther) had written nothing before he read them, people might well have thought that he had stolen all his ideas from them. McClintock and Strong's Cyclopedia describes Gansfort as \\"the most important among men of German extraction who helped prepare the way for the Reformation.\\" The Sum of Christianity is an anonymous English translation of the Farrago. A complete edition of his works appeared at Groningen in 1614, including a biography by the Protestant preacher Albert Hardenberg. ==See also== * Johann von Goch * Johann Ruchrat von Wesel ==References== *Wessel Gansfort, Opera, ed.

It was the terminus of both lines from September 11, 1972, until March 25, 2017, when Warm Springs/South Fremont station opened. ==History== Entrance to Fremont station in 2010 Service at the station began on September 11, 1972. During the first months of revenue service, the Automatic Train Control (ATC) system had safety problems with its design and operation. On October 2, 1972, an ATC failure caused a train to run off the end of the elevated track at the Fremont station and crash to the ground - an incident dubbed the \\"Fremont Flyer\\". Four people on-board were injured.

The station was the northern terminus of Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) bus service from June 25, 1973 to December 28, 2019. VTA discontinued service to Fremont station as part of a systemwide network modification, which was originally intended be simultaneous with the opening of the BART extension to Berryessa.

S. Bach's St Matthew Passion, BWV 244, as published in 1856 The German Bach-Gesellschaft (Bach Society) was a society formed in 1850 for the express purpose of publishing the complete works of Johann Sebastian Bach without editorial additions. The collected works are known as the Bach-Gesellschaft-Ausgabe. On completion of the project, the Society dissolved itself. The nineteenth-century society needs to be distinguished from its successor, the Neue Bachgesellschaft (New Bach Society), founded in 1900. ==Origins of the Bach-Gesellschaft== The founders of the society were Moritz Hauptmann, cantor of the St. Thomas Church, Leipzig, (and thus a successor of Bach); Otto Jahn, author of a noted biography of Mozart; Carl Ferdinand Becker, teacher at the Leipzig Conservatory; and the composer Robert Schumann. ==Publication history== The Bach-Gesellschaft began publishing Bach's works in 1851 with a volume that started with BWV 1, the cantata Wie sch√∂n leuchtet der Morgenstern, BWV 1. (Worklist for J.S. Bach). It completed publication in 1900 with its forty- sixth volume. However, the edition of The Art of Fugue by Wolfgang Graeser, published in 1926, is sometimes counted as \\"Volume 47\\" and was issued as a supplement to the Bach-Gesellschaft publication by Breitkopf & H√§rtel, publishers of the original series. Additionally, Vol. 45, part 1 includes a revised edition (\\"Neue berichtige Ausgabe\\") of the English Suites and French Suites that had previously been published in Vol. 13. Among the editors was Alfred D√∂rffel. Brahms was one of the subscribers to the project and also served on the editorial board. A list of subscribers was printed in each volume. ==Quality of the edition== The volumes varied somewhat in editorial quality and accuracy; Bach scholar Hans T. David particularly criticized Vol. 31's presentation of The Musical Offering for numerous incorrect readings, and the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica calls the edition as a whole \\"of very unequal merit.\\" Britannica both lauds the editing of Wilhelm Rust for the edition and notes a deterioration of standards after his death, including a volume in which \\"the bass and violin are a bar apart for a whole line\\" (apparently a reference to sloppy editing). In his edition of the Goldberg Variations, Ralph Kirkpatrick also calls attention to several \\"mistakes of the Bachgesellschaft edition\\" that he has corrected, particularly with regard to the presentation of ornaments. (It is worth noting that the Bach-Gesellschaft volume containing the Goldbergs was one of the first to be published‚ÄîVol. 3, which appeared in 1853.) Nevertheless, the Bach-Gesellschaft's volumes were a groundbreaking achievement and contributed greatly to the study and appreciation of Bach's music. They remained the standard edition of Bach's complete works until the publication of the Neue Bach-Ausgabe by B√§renreiter and the Deutscher Verlag f√ºr Musik (1954-2007). (section of J.S.

Founded in 1852, it houses a large collection of items relating to German culture and art extending from prehistoric times through to the present day. The Germanisches National Museum is Germany's largest museum of cultural history. Out of its total holding of some 1.3 million objects (including the holdings of the library and the Department of Prints and Drawings), approximately 25,000 are exhibited. The museum is situated in the south of the historic city center between Kornmarkt and Frauentormauer along the medieval city wall. Its entrance hall is situated on Kart√§usergasse which was transformed by the Israeli sculptor Dani Karavan to the Way of Human Rights (). == Name, establishment, guiding principles == The inscription ‚ÄûEigenthum der deutschen Nation‚Äú (\\"Property of the German Nation\\") at the main entrance was installed when the museum was founded in 1852, and was commissioned by Hans von und zu Aufse√ü The Germanisches Museum, as it was named initially, was founded by a group of individuals led by the Franconian baron Hans von und zu Aufsess, whose goal was to assemble a \\"well-ordered compendium of all available source material for German history, literature and art\\". The term Germanic should be understood in the historical context of the mid nineteenth century. In 1846, German linguists and historians, amongst them the Brothers Grimm, Leopold Ranke und Jacob Burckhardt, had met in Frankfurt, and decided to use \\"Germanistik\\" as a comprehensive term embracing all the fields of their academic disciplines related to the culture of German speaking regions. The German revolutions of 1848‚Äì49 had failed to achieve a liberalised and unified Germany. Thus the name of the museum maintained the idea of a close cultural relationship within a region defined by the common German language, and a shared German cultural tradition. In 1852, the museum's intention to document the cultural unity of the German-speaking areas was a progressive concept, free from any exaggerated Chauvinism. Only in 1871, when the German Empire was constituted, the museum paid tribute to it by adding national to its name. The museum understands itself as an important research and educational institution. As a national museum and a museum of the entire German-speaking region the German National Museum collects and maintains cultural, artistic and historical testimonials from the beginning of history to the present. As a research and educational institution of international standing, the collections, exhibitions and publications present the cultural history of the German-speaking countries in an international and interdisciplinary approach. The work of the institution is guided by the principle of respect for all cultures, so that all human beings can understand what the museum communicates, independent of their upbringing, education, and religious beliefs. == Buildings == Courtyard of the Carthusian cloister at the time of the foundation of the GNM, 1852 The museum constitutes an architectural monument in itself, as it consists of a variety of buildings erected in different periods. It incorporates the remaining structures of the former Nuremberg Charterhouse (), dissolved in 1525 and thereafter used for a variety of secular purposes until in 1857 what was left of these premises, by then badly dilapidated, was given to the Museum. The charterhouse was rebuilt and modified to accommodate the collections until the late nineteenth century when Neo-Gothic extensions were added on its south side. During and after the First World War, the ‚ÄûAlter Eingang‚Äú (Old Entrance) and the ‚ÄûGaleriebau‚Äú (Gallery building) designed by German Bestelmeyer were built to provide an entrance from Kornmarkt and further space.J√∂rn Bahns, Die Museumsbauten von der √úbernahme der Kartause im Jahre 1857 bis gegen 1910 ‚Äì History of the museum buildings from the takeover of the Charterhouse to around 1910 In: Deneke/Kahsnitz (Ed.) 1978, p. 357 After the destructions during the Second World War, Sep Ruf designed additional buildings; historical parts of the halls and galleries were adapted to the new architectural concept or torn down after their destruction during the war; only some buildings were restored and rebuilt. The first major building was added 1955‚Äì1958, called ‚ÄûHeussbau‚Äú after the first president of West Germany, Theodor Heuss. In 1983, and from 1988‚Äì1993, the museum was substantially enlarged.

Steinway, was a businessman and civic leader who was influential in the development of Astoria, New York City. ==Germany== Steinway was born in Seesen, Brunswick, Germany, the fourth son of Henry Engelhard Steinway. In Germany, he received an elementary education and was also given instruction in languages and music. He then became an apprentice in a piano factory, where he spent two years. ==Steinway & Sons== rotunda of the Steinway Hall on 57th St. in New York City, with artist Mia LaBerge's Madison Bluestone art case piano in the foreground He came to the United States with his father and brothers in 1850. With his father and his brothers Charles and Henry, he founded the firm of Steinway & Sons in 1853. In 1876, he became the official head of the firm, after he had done the decisions factually since 1871 when his father died, and in regard of representation since 1860 when he was the speaker to inaugurate the new plant at 4th Avenue/52nd Street, New York City. In 1866, Steinway erected Steinway Hall to make a place for the exhibition of the highest musical skill. It was a huge success for the company. He also founded the Steinway Concert & Artist department, which is still working today. In 1870, William began building a company town, Steinway Village, on in northern Astoria, New York. Avoiding the crowded streets and labor problems associated with operating in Manhattan, he directed the construction of the Steinway Piano Factory on this land, a large facility still in operation today. Near the factory was housing for his workers, a church, library and kindergarten as well as a public trolley line. In 1929, a resort area which Steinway developed just east of Astoria, in North Beach, was converted into North Beach Airport, later renamed LaGuardia Airport. His successor in the company was . ==Marriage== Steinway married Regina Roos in Buffalo, New York in April 1861. He was 26 and she 17 and the couple were deeply in love. The marriage lasted 16 years and included a series of affairs which Steinway found personally devastating. Steinway was devastated by his wife's adultery, according to his personal diaries. Regina was to become pregnant six times ‚Äì two children were still-born and a third miscarried. One son was illegitimate and moved with his mother to France when she divorced in 1876. Steinway later happily remarried.Allen-Mills, Toby. (2010), \\"Wife's Grand Betrayal of Steinway\\" in Sunday Times 26 December 2010. ==Daimler cars== Steinway also became involved in Daimler AG's first venture into American markets. Through his connections with designer and Daimler confidant Wilhelm Maybach, Steinway met Gottlieb Daimler during a stay in Germany in 1888. Their conversations would invariably revolve around one subject: production of Daimler engines in America. Steinway, like Daimler, quite rightly believed these was a bright future for the internal combustion engine and automobile. After William Steinway returned to America, plans quickly materialized. On September 29, 1888, Daimler Motor Company of New York was founded and initially produced gas and petroleum engines for stationary and marine applications. Steinway and Daimler also started seriously considering the production of automobiles in America, as shipping costs and custom duties prevented importation of highly-coveted \\"old- world\\" automobiles. From 1892 until ca. 1896/97 the \\"American Daimler\\" was produced in the premises of the Steinway Astoria plant, full copies of the German cars. Following Steinway's early death in 1896, his heirs weren't convinced about the project and sold all their shares to the General Electric Company in 1898. The factory was renamed Daimler Manufacturing Company. Nonetheless, the hand polished wood inside the Daimler AG company's luxury top brand cars named Maybach is still () made by Steinway's factory in Hamburg, Germany. January 17, 2010. ==Public Transit== Steinway Street Station During the 1890s, Steinway began a project to extend his company town's horse-drawn trolley line under the East River and into midtown Manhattan. This project would eventually lead to the IRT Flushing Line. Although he died before the completion of the project, the tunnels that were dug under the East River were named the Steinway Tunnels after him. The dirt removed from the tunnels was formed into a small island in the middle of the East River, now called U Thant Island. Steinway served as head of the New York Subway Commission, the group that planned the New York City Subway network. ==Legacy== Steinway memorial, in the town of his birth Seesen, Brunswick William Steinway died on November 30, 1896, and was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery. Main Street in Astoria has been renamed Steinway Street in his honor, and today a station on the IND Queens Boulevard Line ( trains) is named Steinway Street. The Smithsonian's National Museum of American History launched an online edition of \\"The William Steinway Diary\\" in December 2010 to coincide with a special display of the diary. The exhibition, titled, \\"A Gateway to the 19th Century: The William Steinway Diary, 1861‚Äì1896,\\" was on view in the Albert H. Small Documents Gallery from Dec. 17, 2010 through April 8, 2011. In the diaries, Steinway documented more than 36 years of his life through near-daily notes in nine volumes and some 2,500 pages, beginning eight days after the first shots of the Civil War were fired and three days before his wedding. The exhibition of the diary included select diary passages, Steinway family photographs, maps and advertisements, and documentation of his role in the creation of the New York City subway and the company town of Steinway in Queens, N.Y. Recognizing the diary's historical significance, the late Henry Ziegler Steinway, Steinway's grandson and former president of Steinway & Sons, donated the diary to the museum in 1996. A complete transcription of the diary alongside high- resolution scans of each handwritten page are available on \\"The William Steinway Diary\\" website from the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. The site provides a detailed look at Steinway's firsthand account of the period's financial panics, labor unrest and rise of the German immigrant class. Primary source material is contextualized with more than 100 images from Steinway family archives and related essays. ==See also== *Steinway Mansion ==References== ==External links== * William Steinway's diary, family tree of the Steinway family, photos and more in the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History * The Steinway & Sons Collection in La Guardia and Wagner Archives * Steinway & Sons ‚Äì European and international headquarters * Steinway & Sons ‚Äì American headquarters Category:1835 births Category:1896 deaths Category:People from Queens, New York Category:People from the Duchy of Brunswick Category:People from Goslar (district) Category:Burials at Green-Wood Cemetery William Category:American musical instrument makers Category:German musical instrument makers Category:German emigrants to the United States Category:American manufacturing businesspeople Category:Piano makers Category:Purveyors to the Imperial and Royal Court Category:American people of German descent Category:American artists Category:19th-century American businesspeople ","title":"William Steinway"},{"id":"2204042","text":"Ashby is a Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) station located under Adeline Street and perpendicular to Ashby Avenue in South Berkeley of Berkeley, California.

The three stations in Berkeley were originally planned to be elevated, but the City of Berkeley paid extra tax to have them built underground. Service at Ashby station began on January 29, 1973, as part of the MacArthur to Richmond extension. Unique in the BART system, the City of Berkeley, rather than BART, controls the air rights on the parking lots. The west parking lot of the station hosts a popular flea market on weekends; a proposed residential development over the west lot has proven locally controversial. Between 2008 and 2010, a portion of the east parking lot was redeveloped as the Ed Roberts Campus, which houses several regional disability-related organizations. The east parking lot and station entrance were closed for construction on August 18, 2008. The east parking lot reopened on April 19, 2010, and the Ed Roberts Campus and the new east entrance opened that November.

At the start of the 20th century, the Spanish Empire's colonial possessions in Africa comprised Morocco, Spanish Sahara, Ifni, Cape Juby and Spanish Guinea. ==Spanish Morocco== left Spanish Morocco was the closest Spanish colonial territory to mainland Spain and the most difficult to control. A major Moroccan revolt against both Spanish and French colonial rule began in 1921, with the destruction of a Spanish army at Annual. The Rif tribes were finally subdued only with difficulty by substantial Franco-Spanish forces after several years of fighting. ==Background and origins== Spain maintained garrisons in its two Moroccan coastal enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta from the fifteenth century onwards. At different times these were made up of sailors, disciplinary companies, marine infantry, free companies and detachments from metropolitan units. The Spanish Army of Africa can be said to have originated as a permanent institution with the establishment in 1893 of the Regimiento de √Åfrica N¬∞ 1 (1st African Infantry Regiment). ==Recruitment of Moroccan troops== Following the Melilla Campaign of 1909‚Äì10 Spain began expanding inland from its established coastal holdings and a force of Policia Indigena (Native Police) was created with Moroccan personnel. This indigenous force provided the basis for the establishment in 1911 of the Regulares - Moroccan infantry and cavalry units with Spanish officers. == The Tiradores de Ifni == The Spanish Army of Africa included an indigenous light infantry force under European officers, designated as the Tiradores de Ifni. In existence from 1934 to 1969, this corps was modelled on the North African tirailleurs of the French Army. ==Spanish Legion== The Spanish Legion was formed by royal decree of King Alfonso XIII on 28 January 1920 as the Regiment of Foreigners. El Tercio was modeled on the French Foreign Legion. Its purpose was to provide a corps of professional troops to fight in Spain's colonial campaigns in North Africa in place of conscript units that were proving ineffective. The initial make-up of the regiment was that of a headquarters unit and three battalions known as Banderas (\\"banners\\") - an archaic 16th-century term. ==1920‚Äì1936== By the Rif War of the 1920s, the Army of Africa was composed in essence of the Spanish Legion and the Regulares; plus cazadores (Spanish infantry), artillery, engineers and support units. In total it numbered 30,000 soldiers and was the most professional and effective fighting force in the 100,000-man Spanish Army during the 1920s and 30s.Hugh Thomas, page 315 \\"The Spanish Civil War\\", Penguin Books 2003 Indigenous infantry recruited in the enclave of Ifni (Tiradores de Ifni) from 1934 on, were also considered part of the Army of Africa. A locally recruited gendarmerie, the Mehalas de la Mehalla' Jalifiana, numbering about 5,000 men and modeled on the Moroccan Goumiers attached to the French Army of Africa, was established in 1923 and provided support to the regular units of the Army of Africa. Following the conclusion of the Rif War, the garrison of Spanish Morocco was reduced to the units listed above; plus seven infantry battalions, six cavalry squadrons and six artillery batteries from mainland Spain assigned to African service on a rotation basis. ==Role in the Spanish Civil War== The Army of Africa was to play a key part during the Spanish Civil War of 1936‚Äì39. Along with other units in the Spanish Army, the Army of Africa rose against the Second Spanish Republic and took part in the Spanish coup of July 1936 on the side of the Nacionales. On 18 July 1936, General Francisco Franco assumed the supreme command over this force. Spanish Morocco fell to the rebels without significant opposition. The initial intention was to transport the Army of Africa to mainland Spain by sea. However the crews of the majority of ships in the Spanish Navy had remained loyal to the Republican governmentHugh Thomas, page 318 \\"The Spanish Civil War\\", Penguin Books 2003, in Madrid, overwhelming the officers who had joined the rising.Hugh Thomas, pages 231-232 \\"The Spanish Civil War\\", Penguin Books 2003, Between 29 July and 5 August 1936 1,500 members of the Army of Africa were accordingly transported to mainland Spain in a bold airlift led by Junkers transport planes supplied by Nazi Germany. The fascist r√©gime of the Kingdom of Italy provided Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 bombers to provide air cover for merchant ships carrying 3,000 soldiers and equipment from Morocco on 5 August. Thereafter daily flights continued until about 8,000 Moroccans and legionaries, with supporting artillery, were gathered at Seville.Hugh Thomas, pages 357-358 \\"The Spanish Civil War\\", Penguin Books 2003, After landing in Spain, the Army of Africa was split into two columns, one commanded by General Juan Yag√ºe and the other commanded by Colonel Jos√© Enrique Varela. Yag√ºe's force advanced north, making remarkably rapid gains, and then turned north- eastwards towards Madrid and Toledo. Varela's force entered Andalusia and took control of the key cities of Seville, Granada, and C√≥rdoba. Thanks mostly to the Army of Africa's advances, almost all of western Spain was in Francoist Nationalist hands by the end of September 1936. By early 1937 the Army of Africa's strength had been increased to 60,000 men. The Legion and Regulares spearheaded the Nacionales operations for the remainder of the war and played a central role in the Nationalist victory. ==1940‚Äì1956== With the ending of the Civil War the Army of Africa was reduced to a peacetime establishment. However under Franco it was accorded a higher profile in Spain itself than had been the case under either monarchy or republic. During the 1940s detachments from the Tiradores de Ifni garrisoned the Canary Islands, while a mounted Guardia Mora (\\"Moorish Guard\\") undertook ceremonial duties in Madrid. ==Post Moroccan independence== Following Moroccan independence in 1956 the bulk of the locally recruited Regulares were transferred to the new Royal Moroccan Army. The cities of Melilla and Ceuta, and the lesser plazas de soberan√≠a as well, remained Spanish and are still garrisoned by Legion and Regulares units. Ifni remained under Spanish administration until June 1969. However widespread disturbances in the territory in 1956 and the Ifni War of 1957-58 led to substantial desertions amongst the indigenous rank and file of the Tiradores de Ifni. Accordingly, the four tabors which made up this force underwent a process of \\"europeanisation\\" in which the majority of their personnel were recruited from Spain itself. ==See also== *Spanish Legion *Regulares *Tiradores de Ifni *Colonial Guard of Spanish Guinea *Civil Guard (Spain) *Mohamed Meziane ==References== ==External sources== * Beevor, Antony.

Born to German-Jewish parents who had emigrated to Britain at the beginning of the 20th century, Winton supervised the rescue of 669 children, most of them Jewish, from Czechoslovakia on the eve of World War II. Winton found homes for the children and arranged for their safe passage to Britain. This operation was later known as the Czech ' (German for \\"children's transport\\"). His work went unnoticed by the world for nearly 50 years, until 1988 when he was invited to the BBC television programme That's Life!, where he was reunited with several of the children he had saved. The British press celebrated him and dubbed him the \\"British Schindler.\\" In 2003, Winton was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for \\"services to humanity, in saving Jewish children from Nazi Germany occupied Czechoslovakia\\". On 28 October 2014, he was awarded the highest honour of the Czech Republic, the Order of the White Lion (1st class), by Czech President Milo≈° Zeman. He died in 2015 at the age of 106 in his sleep. == Early life == Winton was born on 19 May 1909 in Hampstead, London to Jewish parents Rudolph Wertheim (18811937), a bank manager, and his wife Barbara ( Wertheimer, 18881978), as the middle-born of their three children. His elder sister was Charlotte (1908‚Äì2001) and the younger brother, Robert (1914‚Äì2009). See No. 78. His parents were German Jews who had moved to London two years earlier. The family name was Wertheim, but they changed it to Winton in an effort at integration. They also converted to Christianity, and Winton was baptised. In 1923, Winton entered Stowe School, which had just opened. He left without qualifications, attending night school while volunteering at the Midland Bank. He then went to Hamburg, where he worked at Behrens Bank, followed by Wasserman Bank in Berlin. In 1931, he moved to France and worked for the Banque Nationale de Cr√©dit in Paris. He also earned a banking qualification in France. Returning to London, he became a broker at the London Stock Exchange. Though a stockbroker, Winton was also \\"an ardent socialist who became close to Labour Party luminaries Aneurin Bevan, Jennie Lee and Tom Driberg.\\" Through another socialist friend, Martin Blake, Winton became part of a left-wing circle opposed to appeasement and concerned about the dangers posed by the Nazis. At school, he had become an outstanding fencer and was selected for the British team in 1938. He had hoped to compete in the following Olympics, but the games were cancelled because of the war. == Rescue work == Jewish children leave Prague for Britain. Winton appears towards the end of the video, wearing glasses. Shortly before Christmas 1938, Winton was planning to travel to Switzerland for a skiing holiday. Following a call for help from Marie Schmolka and Doreen Warriner, he decided instead to visit Prague and help Martin Blake, who was in Prague as an associate of the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia, then in the process of being occupied by Germany, and had called Winton to ask him to assist in Jewish welfare work.Jonathan Romain \\"A salute to the 'British Schindler' as he turns 104\\", The Guardian, 17 May 2013. Alongside the Czechoslovak Refugee Committee, the British and Canadian volunteers such as Winton, Trevor Chadwick, and Beatrice Wellington worked in organising to aid children from Jewish families at risk from the Nazis. Many of them set up their office at a dining room table in a hotel in Wenceslas Square. Altogether, Winton spent one month in Prague and left in January 1939, six weeks before the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. Other foreign volunteers remained, such as Chadwick, Warriner and Wellington. In November 1938, following Kristallnacht in Nazi-ruled Germany, the House of Commons approved a measure to allow the entry into Britain of refugees younger than 17, provided they had a place to stay and a warranty of ¬£50 was deposited for their eventual return to their own country. === The Netherlands === An important obstacle was getting official permission to cross into the Netherlands, as the children were to embark on the ferry at Hook of Holland. After Kristallnacht in November 1938, the Dutch government officially closed its borders to any Jewish refugees. The Dutch police, the marechaussee, searched for them and returned any found to Germany, despite the horrors of Kristallnacht being well known. Winton succeeded, thanks to the guarantees he had obtained from Britain. After the first train, the process of crossing the Netherlands went smoothly. Winton ultimately found homes in Britain for 669 children, many of whose parents would perish in the Auschwitz concentration camp. His mother worked with him to place the children in homes and later hostels. Throughout the summer of 1939, he placed photographs of the children in Picture Post seeking families to accept them. By coincidence, the names of the London and North Eastern Railway steamers which operated the Harwich to Hook of Holland route included the Prague and the Vienna; the former can be seen in a 1938 Path√© newsreel.The Kinder - Jewish Refugees December 1938. YouTube. 19 December 2018. Retrieved 19 May 2020. He also wrote to US politicians such as President Franklin D. Roosevelt, asking them to take more children. He said that two thousand more might have been saved if they had helped, but only Sweden took any besides those sent to Britain. The last group of 250, scheduled to leave Prague on 1 September 1939, were unable to depart. With Hitler's invasion of Poland on the same day, the Second World War had begun. Of the children due to leave on that train, only two survived the war. Winton acknowledged the vital roles in Prague of Doreen Warriner, Trevor Chadwick, Nicholas Stopford, Beatrice Wellington (born 15 June 1907), Josephine Pike, and Bill Barazetti (1914‚Äì2000), who also worked to evacuate children from Europe. Winton was in Prague for only about three weeks before the Nazis occupied the country. He never set foot in Prague Station. He later wrote that \\"Chadwick did the more difficult and dangerous work after the Nazis invaded... he deserves all praise\\". === Notable people saved === * Leslie Baruch Brent, immunologist who did groundbreaking work on immune tolerance. * Alf Dubs, Baron Dubs (born 1932), British Labour Party politician and former Member of Parliament * Heini Halberstam (1926‚Äì2014), mathematician. * Renata Laxova (born 1931), paediatric geneticist * Isi Metzstein (1928‚Äì2012), modernist architect * Gerda Mayer (born 1927), poetEmanuel, Muriel; Gissing, Vƒõra (2002), Nicholas Winton and the rescued generation, p. 102. * Karel Reisz (1926‚Äì2002), filmmakerEmanuel, Muriel; Gissing, Vƒõra (2002), Nicholas Winton and the rescued generation, p. 110. * Joe Schlesinger (1928‚Äì2019), Canadian television journalist and authorEmanuel, Muriel; Gissing, Vƒõra (2002), Nicholas Winton and the rescued generation, p. 138 * Yitzchok Tuvia Weiss (born 1926), Chief Rabbi of the Edah HaChareidis in Jerusalem Of the 669 children saved from the Holocaust through Winton's efforts, more than 370 have never been traced.

He was an aircraftman, rising to sergeant by the time he was commissioned on 22 June 1944 as an acting pilot officer on probation. On 17 August 1944, he was promoted to pilot officer on probation. He was promoted to the rank of war substantive flying officer on 17 February 1945. He relinquished his commission on 19 May 1954, retaining the honorary rank of flight lieutenant. == Postwar == Winton visiting Prague in October 2007 === Family life === After the war, Winton worked for the International Refugee Organization and then the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Paris, where he met Grete Gjelstrup, a Danish secretary and accountant's daughter. They married in her hometown of Vejle on 31 October 1948. The family insisted that their son Robin stay with them rather than be sent to a residential home. Robin's death from meningitis, the day before his sixth birthday, affected Winton greatly and he founded a local support organisation which became Maidenhead Mencap. Winton stood, unsuccessfully, for the town council in 1954; he later found work in the finance departments of various companies. === Recognition === It has been reported Winton suppressed his humanitarian exploits for many years; however, he mentioned them in his election material while unsuccessfully standing for election to the Maidenhead town council in 1954. His rescue achievements went unnoticed for half a century until in 1988 his wife found a detailed scrapbook in their attic, containing lists of the children, including their parents' names and the names and addresses of the families that took them in. She gave the scrapbook to Elisabeth Maxwell, a Holocaust researcher and wife of media magnate Robert Maxwell. Winton himself could not remember the reason why this was done. Letters were sent to each of these known addresses and 80 of \\"Winton's children\\" were found in Britain. In an interview on the BBC radio programme The Life Scientific, Simon Wessely described how his father Rudi, one of the rescued children, had a chance encounter with Winton.\\"Simon Wessely on unexplained medical syndromes, The Life Scientific ‚Äì BBC Radio 4\\".

His birthday was also marked by the publication of a profile in The Jewish Chronicle. == Death == Commemorative event, in July 2015, at the Prague Main Railway Station sculpture Winton died in his sleep on the morning of 1 July 2015 at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough from cardio-respiratory failure, having been admitted a week earlier following a deterioration in his health. He was 106 years old. Winton was survived by his son, Nicholas, and his daughter, Barbara. Stephen Bates, Sir Nicholas Winton obituary The Guardian, 1 July 2015 Winton's death came 76 years to the day after 241 of the children he saved left Prague on a train. A special report from the BBC News on several of the children whom Winton rescued during the war had been published earlier that day. == Honours == In the 1983 Queen's Birthday Honours, Winton was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his work in establishing the Abbeyfield homes for the elderly in Britain, and in the 2003 New Year Honours, he was knighted for services to humanity, in recognition of his work on the Czech Kindertransport. He met the Queen again during her state visit to Bratislava, Slovakia, in October 2008. In 2003, Winton received the Pride of Britain Award for Lifetime Achievement. In 2010, Winton was named a British Hero of the Holocaust by the British Government. Winton was awarded the Order of Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk, Fourth Class, by the Czech President V√°clav Havel in 1998. In 2008, he was honoured by the Czech government in several ways. An elementary school in Kun≈æak is named after him, and he was awarded the Cross of Merit of the Minister of Defence, Grade I. The Czech government nominated him for the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize. The minor planet 19384 Winton was named in his honour by Czech astronomers Jana Tich√° and Milo≈° Tich√Ω.

In September 2010, another statue of Winton was unveiled, this time at Maidenhead railway station by Home Secretary Theresa May, MP for Maidenhead. Created by Lydia Karpinska, it depicts Winton sitting on a bench and reading a book. Winton was baptised as a Christian by his parents, but his Jewish ancestry disqualified him from being declared a Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem in Israel. As an adult, he was not active in any particular religion. In a 2015 interview, Winton told Stephen Sackur he had become disillusioned with religion during the war as he could not reconcile religious movements \\"praying for victory on both sides of the same war\\". Winton went on to describe his personal beliefs: \\"I believe in ethics, and if everybody believed in ethics we'd have no problems at all. That's the only way out; forget the religious side.\\" at 18 minutes 11 seconds Winton received the Wallenberg Medal on 27 June 2013 in London. The following year, the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation established a literary competition named after Winton. The contest is for essays by high school students about Winton's legacy.Letter in The Guardian newspaper, 24 May 2014, signed by Eduardo Eurnekian and Baruch Tenembaum, chairman and founder of the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation Winton was awarded the Freedom of the City of London on 23 February 2015.

On board were several surviving \\"Winton children\\" and their descendants, who were welcomed by Winton in London. The occasion marked the 70th anniversary of the final intended Kindertransport arranged by Winton, due to set off on 1 September 1939 but prevented by the outbreak of the Second World War that very day. At the train's departure, a memorial statue for Winton, designed by Flor Kent, was unveiled at the railway station. === Order of the White Lion === On 19 May 2014, Winton's 105th birthday, it was announced he was to receive the Czech Republic's highest honour, for giving Czech children \\"the greatest possible gift: the chance to live and to be free\\". On 28 October 2014, Winton was awarded the Order of the White Lion (Class I) by Czech President Milo≈° Zeman, (in Czech) the Czech Defence Ministry having sent a special aircraft to bring him to Prague. The award was made alongside one to Sir Winston Churchill, which was accepted by his grandson Nicholas Soames. Zeman said he regretted the highest Czech award having been awarded to the two personalities so belatedly, but added \\"better late than never\\". Winton was also able to meet some of the people he rescued 75 years earlier, themselves then in their 80s. He said, \\"I want to thank you all for this enormous expression of thanks for something which happened to me nearly 100 years ago‚Äîand a 100 years is a heck of a long time.

Both Calliope and her sister ship were based on the earlier cruiser . They were effectively test ships for the use of geared turbines which resulted in the one less funnel. They also received slightly thicker armour. They led into the first of the Cambrian subclass. ==Design== Eight light cruisers were ordered for the Royal Navy in the 1913 budget. The six ships of the Caroline class used conventional direct drive turbine engines but Calliope and Caroline each had a different engine design using geared reduction to match optimum working speeds of turbines and propellers. This followed experimental designs ordered in 1911 using geared high pressure turbines for the destroyers and and in 1912 using gearing for both high pressure and low pressure turbines in destroyers and .Brown p.24-25 Calliope was built at HM Dockyard, Chatham, Kent. She was laid down in January 1914, launched on 17 December 1914, and completed in June 1915. Calliope had four shafts as used in the Caroline design but unlike the two used in Champion. Gearing increased the efficiency of power transmission to the water so allowed smaller boilers and turbines to be used than otherwise would be the case. Nominal design power for the same target speed was therefore reduced from 40,000 shp in the Caroline class to 37,500 shp. Propeller speed was 480 rpm. ==Service historyWorld War I=== Commissioned in June 1915, Calliope was assigned to the Grand Fleet for service as flagship of the 4th Light Cruiser Squadron.naval-history.net HMS CALLIOPE She was badly damaged by a fuel oil fire in her boiler room while at sea on 19 March 1916, but was repaired in time to be one of the five ships in the 4th Light Cruiser Squadron at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May-1 June 1916. Under the command of Commodore Charles E. Le Mesurier, HMS Calliope received a number of hits just before nightfall on 31 May (notably by the German battleships and ), and 10 of her crew were killed.northeast medals - Jutland losses In September 1917, Calliope helped to sink four German trawler minesweepers in the North Sea off the coast of Jutland. ===Post-war=== In March 1919, Calliope was commissioned for service with the 8th Light Cruiser Squadron on the North America and West Indies Station where she suffered with another engine room fire in the Atlantic Ocean off the Azores in October 1919. She returned to Devonport for repairs, which were carried out between November 1919 and March 1920, and then recommissioned for continued service on the North America and West Indies Station. She returned to the United Kingdom in December 1920 for a refit and paid off at the Nore in January 1921. She was in the Nore Reserve from October 1921 to May 1924, when she was commissioned for service with the 2nd Cruiser Squadron in the Atlantic Fleet. Between 1925 and 1926, Calliope was used to transport troops before paying off into dockyard control at the Nore in April 1926 for a refit. Between 1927 and 1928 she was used for trooping runs again, becoming the Senior Naval Officer's ship in the Nore Reserve in December 1927.

The Fox and MGM studios are located in a series of skyscrapers, along with many historic Los Angeles hotels. Wilshire Boulevard is also the principal street of Koreatown, the site of many of Los Angeles' oldest buildings, as well as skyscrapers. Koreatown and Mid-Wilshire are among Los Angeles' most densely populated districts. ==History and Origin as \\"Calle de los Indios\\"== Wilshire Boulevard originated as one of the central pathways constructed by the Tongva Aztec tribes residing in the region prior to the exploration of the conquistadores. At the time of the founding of Los Angeles, Wilshire Boulevard was one of the main arteries connecting the largest Tongva city in the area, then known as Yaanga, which eventually become Union Station, to the Pacific Ocean.Greene, Sean; Curwen, Thomas. \\"Mapping the Tongva villages of L.A.'s past\\". LA Times. Retrieved June 19, 2019. From the founding of Los Angeles through nearly all of the 1800s, Wilshire Boulevard was known as \\"Calle de los Indios.\\" Before the Spanish settlements of Los Angeles, much of the length of Wilshire Boulevard can be traced back to the indigenous Tongva people who used it to bring back tar from the La Brea pits in today's Miracle Mile section of Wilshire Blvd, back to their settlement on the coast. This road was later used by Spanish explorers and settlers, calling it El Camino Viejo ('The Old Road'). The route that ultimately became Wilshire crossed the original pueblo of Los Angeles and five of the original Spanish land grants, or ranchos. Wilshire was pieced together from various streets over several decades. It began in the 1870s as Nevada Avenue in Santa Monica, and in the 1880s as Orange Street between Westlake (now MacArthur) Park and downtown. Nevada and Orange were later renamed as parts of Wilshire. In 1895, Calle de los Indios was renamed \\"Wilshire Boulevard\\" by Henry Gaylord Wilshire (1861‚Äì1927), an Ohio native from Cincinnati, Ohio, who made and lost fortunes in real estate, farming, and gold mining.Hawthorne, Christopher (23 March 2013). \\"Wilshire Boulevard, a Main Street that stands apart\\".

The construction of the future Purple Line extension along Wilshire Boulevard commenced in November 2014. The construction timeline would see the project from the existing Wilshire/Western station to the planned Wilshire/La Cienega station on the corner of Wilshire and La Cienega Boulevard, to be completed by 2023. The second phase got officially under way on February 23, 2018 from Wilshire/La Cienega to Century City Station. Phase three of the Purple Line extension, when fully completed, will extend to UCLA and Westwood/VA Hospital, and will follow Wilshire Boulevard for most of its route. Phase four to downtown Santa Monica is still in the planning stages and has no funding. === Metro === Metro Local Line 20, Metro Rapid Line 720, and Santa Monica Transit Line 2 operate along Wilshire Boulevard. Due to the high ridership of line 720, NABI articulated buses are used on this route, and bus lanes are in place along some segments of the line. == Features == All of the boulevard is at least four lanes in width, and most of the portion between Hoover Street and Robertson Boulevard has a raised center median. The widest portion is in the business district of central Westwood, where mobs of pedestrians crossing Wilshire at Westwood Boulevard must traverse ten lanes (including two left- turn pockets).

Prominent among the Anglo-M√©tis of the area, he is considered to be the founder of the city of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. ==Life== An interpreter for the Hudson's Bay Company for many years, Isbister was talented linguistically, speaking English, Gaelic, Cree, Dene and Michif. Isbister began farming in the summer of 1862 one mile east of the present day federal penitentiary at Prince Albert. The area he farmed is close to present day 17 Avenue and 14 Street West. Isbister was probably the first man in what is now known as Saskatchewan to grow wheat on his own farm. He also worked on the John Smith Reserve (currently the Muskoday First Nation) as a farm instructor. By 1866, when Isbister moved a short distance away, several families were living in the district, which was known as Isbister's Settlement. By 1884, both settler and M√©tis discontent was growing rapidly due to poor agricultural conditions and unresolved land issues in the Saskatchewan Valley region. As a community leader, Isbister was selected as one of the four delegates (along with Gabriel Dumont) sent to recall Louis Riel from Montana to lead the people in seeking government action to address the situation. Local settlers' perception of government inaction culminated in the Northwest Rebellion of the following year (1885). Like most other Anglo-M√©tis of the area, Isbister disassociated himself from the movement led by Riel when tensions ultimately erupted into violence. Despite this, he was denounced by the Conservative press in Prince Albert. Following the Northwest Rebellion, Isbister was active in the Anglican Church of Canada in the Prince Albert area, and lived out his last days in that community.

It was created on 2 February 1661 for Walter Ernle, later Member of Parliament for Devizes. He died 25 July 1682, and was buried at Bishops Cannings, Wiltshire. He was succeeded by his grandson, Sir Walter Ernle (1672‚Äì1690), 2nd Baronet, of Maddington, Wiltshire, who was, in turn, succeeded at his own death by his younger brother, Sir Edward Ernle (1673-1728/9), 3rd Baronet, P.C., MP. The third Baronet was succeeded by a kinsman, Sir Walter Ernle (1676‚Äì1732), 4th Baronet, of Conock, in the parish of Chirton, Wiltshire, who died childless, and was succeeded by his younger brother, the Reverend Sir John Ernle (circa 1680/1-1724), 5th Baronet, Rector of All Cannings, Wiltshire, who was predeceased by his only son. The title is generally considered to have become extinct on the fifth Baronet's death in 1734. However, it was assumed by the late Baronet's kinsman Sir Michael Ernle (circa 1704‚Äì1771), a grandson of the first Baronet's younger brother Michael.Rev W H Jones, The History of the Parish of All Cannings, 1853, The Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine, volume 11, page 192, https://books.google.com.au/books?id=unfzmzzthy0C&pg;=PA192 He also died without issue. The claim was then passed on to his younger brother, The Reverend Sir Edward Ernle (circa 1711/2-1787). Since his death in 1787, the title has not been claimed. The Ernle baronets bore the coat-of-arms: Argent, on a bend sable, three eagles displayed or. The estates of the family passed through female lines of descendants, and the surname Ernle, pronounced Earnley, after the Sussex parish from which it derived, now forms part of the orotund surname, Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, borne by Admiral The Honourable Sir Reginald Aylmer Ranfurly Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, younger son of the 17th Lord Dunsany whose wife, Ernle Elizabeth Louisa Mary Grosvenor Ernle-Erle- Drax, n√©e Burton, was the eventual heiress of the senior line of the Wiltshire Ernle family. The surname continues among the admiral's descendants, being thus preserved whereas it would otherwise, apparently, have died out in the United Kingdom. No other current bearers of the surname worldwide are known to be related in the male-line to the Wiltshire and Sussex Ernle sib. A one-name study of the surname Ernle and its many variants, including Erneley and Ernly, is being undertaken by a descendant of an earlier cadet line (descended from Thomas Ernle, gent., of Brembridge or Bremeridge manor, Dilton, parish of Westbury, Wilts., who was buried in Westbury parish church in 1595. He was the second son of John Ernle, Esq., of Burton Priory, Bishops Cannings, Wilts., who died in 1571) of the same Wiltshire family which originated with the mediaeval lords of the manor of Earnley on the Sussex coast. For a more extensive account of the Ernle lineage, readers are advised to consult, with caution for their many errors, Burke's Extinct and Dormant Baronetcies, and the entries for the family listed in various editions of Burke's Landed Gentry, indexed by Burke's Family Index.

The Old Town School of Folk Music is a Chicago teaching and performing institution that launched the careers of many notable folk music artists. Founded by Folk musicians Frank Hamilton and Win Stracke, and Dawn Greening, the School opened in the Old Town neighborhood of Chicago in 1957 (the original location at 333 west North Avenue has since been demolished). It began by offering guitar and banjo lessons in a communal teaching style and hosting performances by well- known folk musicians. Currently the school has an enrollment of about 6,000 students per week, 2,700 of them children. ==HistoryFounding=== The Old Town School of Folk Music was originally established by Dawn Greening in her family dining room. With her incredible warmth, and skill at building relationships, Greening and her family acted as a support system to a vast community of struggling folk artists. Doc Watson, Pete Seeger and Odetta were among the artists that were always welcome in their home and treated as family. During a time when mothers were expected to act as caretakers and people of color were supposed to enter through the back door as servants, Greening and her family took the brunt of social backlash and exclusion from their neighbors. Yet Greening had the foresight, connections and follow- through required to create a hub for their alternative grass-roots community. She personally coordinated students and teachers to regularly come into her home and experience folk music for what it was; a quilt of tradition and history meant to bring folks from all walks of life together. With her support, Win Stracke and Frank Hamilton were able to formally open the school on December 1, 1957. Stracke was a classically trained singer and Hamilton was a young multi-instrumentalist and teacher of folk music; Hamilton had previously studied under Bess Lomax Hawes, daughter of folklorist John Lomax. Stracke and Hamilton met at the Gate of Horn nightclub in Chicago where they were both performing. Coming together with Greening, Hamilton and Stracke developed a classroom technique based upon traditional oral and folk teaching methods: listening, watching, trial and error, and playing by ear. Where other music schools taught sight reading and performance, Greening, Stracke and Hamilton wanted the Old Town School \\"method\\" to retain its emphasis on participation and development of aural skills. Founder Frank Hamilton teaching a workshop. November 2007 Several of the early faculty at the Old Town School were past members of Win Stracke's the \\"I Come For to Sing\\" review. A folk review performed by a rotating group of artists, the program was a variety show in which each program revolved around a particular topic, the songs and readings presented would all deal with that topic. Win Stracke, Studs Terkel, Big Bill Broonzy, and Fleming Brown were all members of \\"I Come For to Sing\\" at different times. The school would also publish a folk magazine by the same name from 1975-1987. ===Songbook=== The initial version of the Old Town School Songbook was an unbound stack of pages to be added to a three ring binder. It was a collection of 94 songs mostly North American in origin, but selections from Israel, Ireland, England, and Chile were added. In keeping with the teaching philosophy of the school it favored many songs which were suitable for group involvement. Each page had a short history of the song, the chord progression, rhythm indicators, a transcription of the melody and lyrics for the verses. Chord fingering charts were provided for guitar and banjo. ===1950s, 1960s and early 1970s=== Pete Seeger, Mahalia Jackson, Jimmy Driftwood, Big Bill Broonzy, and Josh White all performed at the Old Town School in its early years. Early teachers at the school included Chicago blues guitarist Big Bill Broonzy, and banjo players Fleming Brown and Stu Ramsey as well as the Brazilian singer-guitarist Valucha deCastro (a.k.a. Valucha Buffington). The formation and growth of the School coincided with the folk music boom of the 1960s and early 1970s. In Chicago, folk influence was scattered in Hyde Park (site of the Folk Festival), Oak Park (where Greening lived), and Old Town. The school's first location was a rundown storefront at 333 W. North Ave. in Old Town. Throughout its existence the School has focused on offering both instruction and performance with many performing musicians also acting as teachers and mentors. The School also proved a rich ground for collaboration. The late 1960s were a peak of success as several musicians associated with the School rose to national prominence, including Roger McGuinn of The Byrds, Fred Holstein, John Prine, Steve Goodman, Bonnie Koloc, and Bob Gibson. The school moved into a more permanent home at 909 West Armitage Ave. ===1970s & 1980s: Decline & Renewal=== Enrollment peaked in 1975 with about 650 students per-week, but as the folk revival declined in the mid-1970s so did the fortunes of the School; although it continued to provide music lessons to hundreds of students the School suffered financial difficulties and was on the brink of bankruptcy in 1981. It was discussed at this time to move the School from its aging facilities on Armitage Avenue to the suburbs. The Old Town School of Folk Music (OTSFM), was having a near death experience in the late 1980s.. On revenues of $200,000 per year the school was losing $40,000 per year, with no money in the bank. The school had ceased to be relevant to its markets, and new customers were not being attracted to the school's programming. In order to survive, the school needed to develop a new strategy. So it developed three: 1\\\\. The school could not pay its bills, so one strategy was to reduce costs and raise cash. Goal: Return to net profitability within 12 months. 2\\\\. Develop relevant new products to attract new customers. Goal: Increase revenues by 40% per year through new product offerings. 3\\\\. Raise money to renovate the school's main building at 909 Armitage Ave. and conference hall. Goal: Raise $600,000 over the next 24 months. A new Executive Director, Jim Hirsch, was hired at the beginning of the turnaround. One member of the Board and Jim reviewed all of the financial numbers and decided what they could control, and where cuts were necessary. Reducing costs involved laying off guitar instructors, who were struggling to make a living as artists. The little that the OTSFM paid them was still a meaningful amount in their lives, but an expense the school had to reduce in order to survive. The layoffs were painful, but amazingly half of the staff agreed to work for free, during the transition. They understood the situation faced by the school. Each creditor, and there were many, to whom the school owed money, was met face-to-face. A plan was offered to pay them; if they could extend a little more credit to the school. Growth takes time to build, but cost reductions can happen (no matter how painful) immediately. The school faced several tough choices. The school owned two buildings. It was a painful choice, but the school's board decided to sell one of its buildings, so that bills could be paid and agreements kept. The school also needed to look at its programs and concert offerings to the public. Michael Miles was hired to work on the school's programming. If the school wanted to survive over the long term, it needed to offer more exciting products (concerts, lessons, etc.) and draw in a broader, more ethnically diversified customer base. The OTSFM expanded its concert offerings and guitar instruction lessons. A new 'Wiggleworms' program was put together to teach music to little children (under 5 years old), and Jim put together a \\"Latin Music Festival\\" that was the first such offering in Chicago by a non-Latino institution. This was highlighted in February 1989 by a performance from Jesus \\"Chucho\\" Rodriguez & Henry Hernandez with their Indian Harp and The Inca Peruvian Highland Wind Ensemble. These programs resulted in a much more ethnically diversified audience and helped with revenue growth. Execution of the above changes was primarily done by the school's staff. The board (a group of volunteers) took responsibility for raising $600,000 to do the renovation. Just like a good song needs a 'hook' to resonate with a listener, the school needed a 'hook' to interest funding organizations and individual contributors. The school's success with its new products for a diversified audience was a primary reason funding organizations agreed to provide support to the school's capital campaign. Since then the school has had a renaissance. Its annual revenues are in excess of several million dollars. It successfully renovated its old building, later a new one was purchased and renovated with money from an even larger capital campaign. The new venue has a larger concert stage and teaching capacity. That new building helped to lead the way for revitalizing a Chicago neighborhood. Currently, the school's concerts and teaching programs are full, and there is a very healthy involvement of volunteers, customers and staff. It impacts more people's lives today than at any time in its past ===1990s=== After occupying a building at 909 West Armitage Avenue in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood since 1968, the Old Town School in 1998 expanded into a new and larger main branch in the former Hild Library at 4544 North Lincoln Avenue, with a 400-seat concert hall. The move allowed the school room to expand its music education program significantly. ===2010s=== In October 2018, the school announced that it would sell its Armitage building to gain endowment money.https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-met-old-town- school-sale-20181023-story.html Teachers and community members blasted the decision for being shortsighted and taken without feedback from the community.https://blockclubchicago.org/2018/11/01/old-town-school-of-folk- teachers-see-no-wisdom-in-plan-to-sell-armitage-avenue- building/https://blockclubchicago.org/2018/11/28/dont-sell-old-town-school-of- folk-musics-armitage-avenue-building-fans-plead-in-letters/ The following March, the school announced that it had reconsidered and would not sell the building, instead focusing on increasing enrollment.https://blockclubchicago.org/2019/03/22/old-town-school-will-not- sell-armitage-building/ Meanwhile, the faculty voted to unionize, associating itself with the Illinois Federation of Teachers.https://www.ift- aft.org/news/pension-watch-blog/2019/01/17/teachers-at-old-town-school-of- folk-music-win-historic-union-vote ==Today== A jam session at the Old Town School of Folk Music in 2009. As of late 2003, Old Town School has occasionally held or sponsored concerts in the 1525-seat Harris Theater for Music and Dance located mostly underground in the downtown Millennium Park. Today, the Old Town School continues to offer music, dance, art and theater classes and performances for adults and children at both locations and children's classes in some suburban branch locations. Students from all over the Chicago area attend weekly classes taught by dedicated professionals. Students can also take ensemble classes, working with others on the music of groups like The Beatles, The Grateful Dead, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, and many others. Most classes perform at the end of the eight-week session in the \\"Big Gig\\" or at local venues. The current enrollment is about 7,000 students per week. Many well-known folk, world, bluegrass, jazz, blues and country musicians from all over the world perform at the 4544 North Lincoln Avenue location. There are two Old Town School Music Stores (one at 4544 North Lincoln Avenue and one at 909 West Armitage Avenue) that sell musical instruments for children and adults, books, CDs, accessories, and more. The Store offers instrument repairs and rentals to students. Since 1997, Old Town School hosts the Chicago Folk & Roots Festival in nearby Welles Park. However, in 2012, the School announced it would not organize the event due to rising costs from city policy changes. Instead, in collaboration with The Lincoln Square Chamber of Commerce, Old Town School hosted the Square Roots festival. On December 1, 2007, Old Town School celebrated its 50th Anniversary with a concert at Chicago's Auditorium Theatre featuring Jeff Tweedy, Bela Fleck & Abigail Washburn, David Bromberg, Bonnie Koloc, Frank & Mary Hamilton, Lonnie Brooks with Wayne Baker Brooks and Nicholas Tremulis and Luna Negra Dance Theater. In July 2010, the School announced the planned $18 million expansion of their facility to include new classroom and theater space across the street from their current location (on an empty lot purchased in 2005). The new building opened at 4545 North Lincoln Avenue on January 9, 2012. It adds more than 27,000 square feet of acoustically-engineered, state-of-the-art classrooms and a 150-seat flexible use hall called The Myron R. Szold Music and Dance Hall. The building is LEED Gold certified. On Friday nights, the School offers 6-String Socials at 909 West Armitage Avenue where students can get together to practice singing and playing. ==See also== * - a Wikipedia category listing Old Town affiliated artists ==References== ==External links== *The Old Town School of Folk Music *Companion to the Old Town School Songbook *Old Town School History *Chicago Tribune The songbook remains the same at Old Town.

This algorithm sorts a sequence of items requiring O(n) stack space in a stable manner. It requires a parallel processor. ==Algorithm== For simplicity, assume we are sorting a list of natural numbers. The sorting method is illustrated using uncooked rods of spaghetti: # For each number x in the list, obtain a rod of length x. (One practical way of choosing the unit is to let the largest number m in the list correspond to one full rod of spaghetti. In this case, the full rod equals m spaghetti units. To get a rod of length x, break a rod in two so that one piece is of length x units; discard the other piece.) # Once you have all your spaghetti rods, take them loosely in your fist and lower them to the table, so that they all stand upright, resting on the table surface. Now, for each rod, lower your other hand from above until it meets with a rod‚Äîthis one is clearly the longest. Remove this rod and insert it into the front of the (initially empty) output list (or equivalently, place it in the last unused slot of the output array). Repeat until all rods have been removed. ==Analysis== Preparing the n rods of spaghetti takes linear time. Lowering the rods on the table takes constant time, O(1). This is possible because the hand, the spaghetti rods and the table work as a fully parallel computing device. There are then n rods to remove so, assuming each contact- and-removal operation takes constant time, the worst-case time complexity of the algorithm is O(n). == References == ==External links== * A.

Bork, a former United States Court of Appeals judge. Bork's thesis in the book is that U.S. and more generally Western culture is in a state of decline and that the cause of this decline is modern liberalism and the rise of the New Left. Specifically, he attacks modern liberalism for what he describes as its dual emphases on radical egalitarianism and radical individualism. The title of the book is a play on the last couplet of W. B. Yeats's poem \\"The Second Coming\\": \\"And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, / Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?\\" Bork contends that the \\"rough beast of decadence ‚Ä¶ now sends us slouching towards our new home, not Bethlehem but Gomorrah.\\" More directly, the title borrows from Joan Didion's Slouching Towards Bethlehem. ==Overview== Bork first traces the rapid expansion of modern liberalism that occurred during the 1960s, arguing that this legacy of radicalism demonstrates that the precepts of modern liberalism are antithetical to the rest of the U.S. political tradition. He then attacks a variety of social, cultural, and political experiences as evidence of U.S. cultural decline and degeneracy. Among these are affirmative action, increased violence in and sexualization of mass media, the legalization of abortion, pressure to legalize assisted suicide and euthanasia, feminism and the decline of religion. Bork, himself a rejected nominee of President Ronald Reagan to the United States Supreme Court, also criticizes that institution and argues that the judiciary and liberal judicial activism are catalysts for U.S. cultural corruption. In this light, Bork advocates an amendment to the United States Constitution which would allow Congressional supermajorities to override Supreme Court decisions. ==Reception== The book received a negatively critical response by The Mises Review, which stated that \\"Bork's failure to set forward his arguments rigorously leads to a crucial error in his approach to constitutional interpretation\\" and that the \\"omni-competent state is, for Bork, not a monster to be dispatched but a tool to be used. Whether the state is likely to enforce the values he favors is a question he leaves un-examined\\". ==References== ==External links== * Booknotes interview with Bork on Slouching, December 4, 1996. * Amazon.com's book reviews and description * Barnes & Noble's editorial reviews and overview * OnTheIssues.org's book review and excerpts Category:1996 non-fiction books Category:Books critical of modern liberalism in the United States ","title":"Slouching Towards Gomorrah"},{"id":"2204161","text":"Political representation is the activity of making citizens \\"present\\" in public policy making processes when political actors act in the best interest of citizens. This definition of political representation is consistent with a wide variety of views on what representing implies and what the duties of representatives are. For example, representing may imply acting on the expressed wishes of citizens, but it may alternatively imply acting according to what the representatives themselves judge is in the best interests of citizens. And representatives may be viewed as individuals who have been authorized to act on the behalf of others, or may alternatively be viewed as those who will be held to account by those they are representing. Political representation can happen along different units such as social groups and area, and there are different types of representation such as substantive representation and descriptive representation. ==Views of political representation== Under the accountability view, a representative is an individual who will be held to account. Representatives are held accountable if citizens can judge whether the representative is acting in their best interest and sanction the representative accordingly. The descriptive and symbolic views of political representation describe the ways in which political representatives \\"stand for\\" the people they represent. Descriptive representatives \\"stand for\\" to the extent that they resemble, in their descriptive characteristics (e.g. race, gender, class etc.), the people they represent. On the other hand, symbolic representatives \\"stand for\\" the people they represent as long as those people believe in or accept them as their representative. Pitkin argues that these views of political representation give an inadequate account of political representation because they lack an account both of how representatives \\"act for\\" the represented and the normative criteria for judging representative's actions. Hence Pitkin proposes a substantive view of representation. In this view of political representation, representation is defined as substantive \\"acting for\\", by representatives, the interests of the people they represent. In contrast, Jane Mansbridge has identified four views of democratic political representation: promissory, anticipatory, surrogate and gyroscopic. Mansbridge argues that each of these views provides an account of both how democratic political representatives \\"act for\\" the people they represent and the normative criteria for assessing the actions of representatives. Promissory representation is a form of representation in which representatives are chosen and assessed based on the promises they make to the people they represent during election campaigns. For Mansbridge, promissory representation, preoccupied with how representatives are chosen (authorized) and held to account through elections, is the traditional view of democratic political representation. Anticipatory, surrogate and gyroscopic representation, on the other hand, are more modern views that have emerged from the work of empirical political scientists. Anticipatory representatives take actions that they believe voters (the represented) will reward in the next election. Surrogate representation occurs when representatives \\"act for\\" the interest of people outside their constituencies. Finally, in gyroscopic representation, representatives use their own judgements to determine how and for what they should act for on behalf of the people they represent. Under Rehfeld's general theory of representation, a person is considered a representative as long as the particular group she represents judges her as such. In any case of political representation, there are representatives, the represented, a selection agent, a relevant audience and rules by which the relevant judge whether or not a person is a representative. Representatives are those who are selected by a selection agent from a larger set of qualified individuals who are then judged to representatives by a relevant audience using particular rules of judgement. The rules by which a relevant audience judges whether or not a person is a representative can be either democratic or non-democratic. In a case where the selection agent, relevant audience and the represented are the same and the rules of judgment are democratic (e.g. elections), the familiar democratic case of political representation arises and where they are not, undemocratic cases arise. ==Units of representation Representation by social groups === In this method, elected representatives will be chosen by more or less numerically equivalent blocks of voters. This is not always practical for historical and current political reasons, and sometimes is impractical purely on the basis of logistics, as in regions where travel is difficult and distances are long. The shortened term \\"rep-by-pop\\" is used in Britain but is relatively uncommon in the U.S. Historically rep-by-pop is the alternative to rep-by-area. However, in the colonial countries, the geographic realities made a necessity of low-population electoral districts in order to give meaningful representation to remote communities, and only in urban and suburban areas has there been any success with applying rep-by-pop more or less evenly In the United States and other democracies, typically the lower house of a bicameral (two-chamber) system is based on population‚Äîmore or less‚Äîwhile the upper House is based on area. Or, as it might be put in the United Kingdom, on title to land, as was originally the case with the old pre-Reforms House of Lords. In the Senate or the Lords, it does not matter how many people are living in a constituent's jurisdiction, it matters that the constituent have the jurisdiction (by election, heredity or appointment‚Äîthe US, the UK and Canada respectively). === Representation by area === The principle of rep-by-pop, when brought in and promoted publicly, removed many archaic seats in the British House of Commons although some northern and rural counties necessarily still have variably lower populations than most urban ridings. Former British colonies like Canada and Australia also have rural and wilderness areas spanning tens of thousands of square miles, with fewer voters in them than a tiny urban-core riding. In the most extreme case, one riding of the Canadian parliament covers more than 2 million square kilometres, Nunavut, yet has less than one third the average number of voters for a riding, with a population of about 30,000. Making the riding larger would be difficult for the elected member, as well as for campaigning and also unfair to remotely rural constituents, whose concerns are radically different from those of the medium- sized towns that typically dominate the electorate in such ridings. The American Constitution has built into it a series of compromises between rep- by-pop and rep-by-area: two Senators per state, at least one representative per state, and representation in the electoral college. In Canada, provinces such as Prince Edward Island have unequal representation in Parliament (in the Commons as well as the Senate) relative to Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta, partly for historical reasons, partly because those electoral allotments are constitutionally guaranteed, and partly because governments have simply chosen to under-represent certain voters and over-represent others. In the United States, Baker v. Carr (1962) established the \\"one- person/one vote\\" standard, that each individual had to be weighted equally in legislative apportionment. In Canada, until recent reforms, there were still many federal and provincial electoral districts in British Columbia and other provinces that had less than a few thousand votes cast, notably Atlin, covering the province's far northwest, with no more than 1,500. The area of the riding was about the size of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia combined, and larger than many American states. In practicality, the voters of the tiny communities scattered across the subarctic landscape, less than the population of a city block, had as much electoral clout as two Fraser Valley municipalities totaling up to 60,000 in population. The population imbalance between largely rural areas and overwhelmingly urban areas is one reason why the realities of representation by area still have sway against the ideal of representation by population. ==Models of representation== Models of representation refer to ways in which elected officials behave in representative democracies. There are three main types: delegate, trustee, and politico. ===Delegate model=== A delegate is someone who is elected to represent and convey the views of others. The delegate model of representation suggests that representatives have little or no capacity to exercise their own judgement or preferences. They are merely elected to be the mouthpiece of their constituency and act only the way their constituents would want them to, regardless of their own opinion. Joseph Tussman stated, \\"The essence of representation is the delegation or granting of authority. To authorize a representative is to grant another the right to act for oneself. Within the limits of the grant of authority one is, in fact, committing himself in advance to the decision or will of another\\". ===Trustee model=== A trustee is someone who acts on behalf of others, using their knowledge, experience and intelligence upon a certain field. The trustee model contrasts with the delegate model as this time constituents \\"entrust\\" their elected representatives to represent them however they see fit, with autonomy to vote and behave in the best way for their constituents. Edmund Burke, who formulated the model, stated in a speech, \\"You choose a member indeed; but when you have chosen him he is not member of Bristol, but he is a member of parliament...your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgement; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your own opinion\\". ===Politico model=== The politico model came about when theorists recognised that representatives rarely consistently act as just a delegate or just a trustee when representing their constituents. It is a hybrid of the two models discussed above and involves representatives acting as delegates and trustees, depending on the issue. ===Other models=== The mandate model views representatives as less independent actors. This came about after the emergence of modern political parties; now constituents rarely vote for a representative based on their personal qualities but more broadly, they vote for their party to be elected into government. A mandate is an order or instruction from a superior body therefore this model suggests representatives follow the party line and must carry out policies outlined during election campaigns. The resemblance model is less concerned about the way representatives are selected and more concerned whether they resemble the group they claim to represent. It is similar to descriptive representation, they argue that to represent a group of people such as the working class or women to its full potential you must be part of that social group yourself. Therefore, only people who have shared experiences and interests can fully identify with particular issues. ==Types of representation== An alternative way of considering types of representation is as follows: === Substantive representation === Under representative democracy, ' (in contrast to descriptive representation) is the tendency of elected legislators to advocate on behalf of certain groups. Conflicting theories and beliefs exist regarding why constituents vote for representatives. \\"Rather than choosing candidates on the basis of an informed view of the incumbents' voting records, voters, it is argued, rely primarily on the policy-free 'symbols' of party identification\\".Stokes and Miller, 1962. Politicians, it would seem, have little to fear from a public that knows little about what laws their representatives support or oppose in the legislature. === Descriptive representation === Scholars have defined representation as \\"the making present in some sense of something which is nevertheless not present literally or in fact\\". Descriptive representation is the idea that a group elects an individual to represent them who in their own characteristics mirror some of the more frequent experiences and outward manifestations of the group. In this form of representation, representatives are in their own persons and lives in some sense typical of the larger class of persons whom they represent. For example, certain ethnic groups or gender-based groups may want to elect a leader that shares these descriptive characteristics as they may be politically relevant. Disadvantaged groups may gain benefit from descriptive representation primarily in two ways: # When there is mistrust: This refers to a situation where communication between the group and its representatives has been inadequate. In these cases, descriptive representation promotes vertical communication between representatives and their group of constituents. # When interests are uncrystallized: In certain historical moments, citizen interests are not clearly defined. Either the issues have not been on the political agenda for long, or candidates have not taken public positions on them. In this case, the best way to have one's substantive interests represented is often to choose a descriptive representative whose characteristics match one's own. Descriptive representation can be instituted by political parties independently where they set aside a certain number of party seats for particular groups. It can also be instituted through national electoral quotas either by reserving seats for office or candidate quotas for political parties. Traditionally, quotas have been thought of as a way of providing adequate representation for previously disadvantaged groups such as women or oppressed ethnic groups. However, another way of conceptualizing quotas is to institute a maximum or ceiling quota for advantaged groups. This may improve the meritocracy of the system and improve the process of candidate selection Empirically, quotas show mixed results. In Lesotho, quota-mandated female representation has had no effect or even reduced several dimensions of women's engagement with local politics. In Argentina, quotas have mandated negative stereotypes about women politicians. Meanwhile, in India, women are more likely to win an election in a constituency that formerly had quotas, even when the quotas are removed, and women leaders provide public goods favoured by women constituents. Evidence also shows that caste-based quotas may not change stereotypes of how people view the oppressed caste group, it does change the social norms of interaction between caste groups === Dyadic representation === Dyadic representation refers to the degree to which and ways by which elected legislators represent the preferences or interests of the specific geographic constituencies from which they are elected. Candidates who run for legislative office in an individual constituency or as a member of a list of party candidates are especially motivated to provide dyadic representation. As Carey and Shugart (1995, 417) observe, they have \\"incentives to cultivate a personal vote\\" beyond whatever support their party label will produce. Personal vote seeking might arise from representing the public policy interests of the constituency (by way of either the delegate, responsible party, or trustee models noted above), providing it \\"pork barrel\\" goods, offering service to individual constituents as by helping them acquire government services, and symbolic actions. The most abundant scientific scholarship on dyadic representation has been for the U.S. Congress and for policy representation of constituencies by the members of the Congress. Miller and Stokes (1963) presented the seminal research of this kind in an exploratory effort to account for when alternative models of policy representation arise. Their work has been emulated, replicated, and enlarged by a host of subsequent studies. The most advanced theoretical formulation in this body of work, however, is by Hurley and Hill (2003) and by Hill, Jordan, and Hurley (2015) who present a theory that accounts well for when belief sharing representation, delegate representation, trustee representation, responsible party representation, and party elite led representation will arise. === Collective representation === The concept of collective representation can be found in various normative theory and scientific works, but Weissberg (1978, 535) offered the first systematic characterization of it in the scientific literature and for the U.S. Congress, defining such representation as \\"Whether Congress as an institution represents the American people, not whether each member of Congress represented his or her particular district.\\" Hurley (1982) elaborated and qualified Weissberg's explication of how such representation should be assessed and how it relates to dyadic representation. Stimson, MacKuen, and Erikson (1995), offer the most advanced theoretical exposition of such representation for the U.S. Congress. And the latter work was extended in Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson (2002). In most parliamentary political systems with strong (or ideologically unified) political parties and where the election system is dominated by parties instead of individual candidates, the primary basis for representation is also a collective, party based one. The foundational work on assessing such representation is that of Huber and Powell (1994) and Powell (2000). ==See also== * Apportionment and redistricting * Delegate vs trustee model of representation * Gerrymandering * Representative democracy * Taxation without representation * Substantive representation * Sortition ==Notes== ==ReferencesBibliography=== * Carey, John M. and Matthew Soberg Shugart.

She won a Tony Award in 1987, and represented the United Kingdom in the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest with the song \\"Lonely Symphony (We Will Be Free)\\", finishing 10th. The song became a UK Top 30 hit. In 1984, Ruffelle starred as Dinah in the original West End production of Starlight Express. From 1985, she was the original √âponine in the first English-language productions of Les Mis√©rables in the West End and on Broadway, winning the 1987 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical. Other stage roles include Yonah in Children of Eden (1991), Roxie Hart in Chicago (2003‚Äì04, 2007), the title role in Piaf (2013), Bella in The A to Z of Mrs. P (2014), and Queenie in The Wild Party. Her albums include Fragile (1994), Frances Ruffelle (1998), Showgirl (2004), Imperfectly Me (2010), and I Say Yeh-Yeh (2015). ==Career== As well as her later stage work, Ruffelle has also gained success on the screen. Her film credits include roles in The Wildcats of St Trinian's (1980), P'tang, Yang, Kipperbang (1982), Secrets & Lies (1996), The Road to Ithaca (1999), Les Mis√©rables (2012), Devil's Tower (2014), and Long Forgotten Fields (2014). Ruffelle's first West End appearance was as Louisa in Terence Rattigan's The Sleeping Prince. In 1984, she took on the principal role of Dinah in Andrew Lloyd Webber's Starlight Express in the original London cast. A year later, she had left Starlight and joined the original London cast of Les Mis√©rables as √âponine. Though virtually an unknown outside of the West End, she and Colm Wilkinson were invited to reprise their roles for the Broadway launch. Ruffelle won multiple awards (including the Tony) for her role. She returned to the role she originated in 1997 in the West End of London. Her subsequent work on stage included the Ian Dury musical Apples in 1989 and Stephen Schwartz's Children of Eden in 1990, featuring on the cast albums of both. She has also starred as the female lead Roxie Hart in Chicago, as well as appearing in Lucky Stiff, The creative team behind Les Mis√©rables, Claude-Michel Sch√∂nberg and Alain Boublil, also used Ruffelle's vocals as Kim while writing Miss Saigon. She also workshopped Andrew Lloyd Webber's Sunset Boulevard and Whistle Down the Wind. Ruffelle, who previously played Roxie Hart in Chicago in the West End from September 2003 to June 2004, reprised the role for the show's 10th anniversary in 2007 and stayed with the production through into 2008. Her return to Chicago marked the first time she has performed in the show in the Cambridge Theatre, having only appeared in it when it was on at the Adelphi Theatre. Ruffelle was set to appear in a revival of the Sherman Brothers musical Over Here! in January 2007, alongside Donna McKechnie, Diane Langton and Richard Fleeshman, however it was postponed, and was scheduled to open in Toronto in 2009. In 2006, she performed in a musical based on the works of Stephen Schwartz, Schwartz Stories. In March 2008, she commenced a limited five-week season in the musical, Make Me A Song. She played the title role in Mathilde at the Edinburgh festival in 2008. Ruffelle appeared as series regular Dawn Daniel-Spears in Sky's Dream Team, and series regular Kitty in Headless, for which she also composed the music. Other television credits include playing Olivia in Warner Bros' New Adventures of Robin Hood, Denise in Alan Bennett's Objects of Affection for the BBC and Susan in SWALK for Thames Television. She has starred in The Bill (Thames Television), Strangers (ITV), The Equaliser (Universal) and The Hard Word (Thames Television). In 1994, Ruffelle was chosen to represent the United Kingdom at the Eurovision Song Contest. She sang all eight (8) songs at the pre-selection, and British televoters chose \\"Lonely Symphony\\" to represent the UK, by televoting. It went on to come in 10th at the contest in Dublin. When asked about her motivations for joining the competition, she jokingly replied that since none of the four constituent nations of the UK (Wales, Scotland, England and Northern Ireland) had qualified for that year's football World Cup finals, it was her responsibility to try to restore some national pride. In 2010, she appeared in the 25th Anniversary Concert of Les Mis√©rables at the O2 Arena as part of the original London cast and in 2011 starred as meddling Essex mother Fastrada at the Menier Theatre's production of Pippin. She opened in the title role of Piaf in Pam Gems' Piaf in February 2013 and received a UK Theatre award nomination for Best Actor and in 2014 created the role of Bella in The A-Z of Mrs P at Southwark Playhouse. Frances also performs her critically acclaimed solo shows, Paris Original and Beneath the Dress, in London and New York. In 2015, Ruffelle played the role of Naomi Green in the ITV sitcom Birds of a Feather. She appeared in three episodes. ===Theatre credits=== * 2017: Queenie, The Wild Party, The Other Palace * 2014: Bella, The A‚ÄìZ of Mrs P, Southwark Playhouse * 2013: Piaf, Pam Gem's PIAF, Leicester Curve Theatre * 2011 Fastrada, PIPPIN, Menier Chocolate Factory, Mitch Sebastian * 2010 Angelique Picard, SONGS FROM A HOTEL BEDROOM, Linbury Studio ROH/Tour, Kate Flatt * 2010 One Woman Show, BENEATH THE DRESS, Edinburgh Festival 2010/London, Paul Baker * 2008 MATHILDE, George Square, Edinburgh, Simon Callow * 2008 MAKE ME A SONG: THE MUSIC OF WILLIAM FINN, New Players Theatre, Andrew McBean * 2007 Roxie Hart, CHICAGO, Adelphi Theatre, Walter Bobbie * Betty Shaefer, SUNSET BOULEVARD, Andrew Lloyd Webber's Sydmonton Festival * Annabel, LUCKY STIFF, Bridewell Theatre, Steven Dexter * Candy, WHISTLE DOWN THE WIND, Sydmonton Festival, Gail Edwards * Delilah, APPLES, Royal Court Theatre, Simon Curtis * Eponine, LES MISERABLES, Royal Shakespeare Co/Broadway, John Caird/Trevor Nunn ‚Äì Tony Award, Theatre World Award, Helen Hayes Award and Outer Critics Circle Award * Yonah, CHILDREN OF EDEN, Upstart ‚Äì West End, John Caird * Dinah, STARLIGHT EXPRESS, Really Useful Theatre Company, Trevor Nunn * Princess Louisa, THE SLEEPING PRINCE, Theatre Royal Haymarket, Peter Coe * Narrator, JOSEPH & THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR DREAMCOAT, National Tour, Bill Kenwright ===Film credits=== * The Wildcats of St Trinian's (1980) * P'tang, Yang, Kipperbang (1982) * Secrets & Lies (1996) * The Road to Ithaca (1999) * Les Mis√©rables (2012) * Devil's Tower (2014) * Long Forgotten Fields (2014) ===Television credits=== * Elsie in Strangers (1981, 1 episode) * Denise in Objects of Affection (1982, 1 episode) * Mandy in The Hard Word (1983, 1 episode) * Jackie in Tucker's Luck (1985, 2 episodes) * Sylvie in The Equalizer (1988, 1 episode) * Susan Gilbert in The Bill (series 9) (1993, 1 episode) * Olivia in The New Adventures of Robin Hood (1997, 1 episode) * Kitty in Headless (2000) * Dawn Daniel-Spears in Dream Team (2001, 20 episodes) * Naomi in Birds of a Feather (2015, 3 episodes) ===Radio=== * 2009, Guest Soloist, FRIDAY NIGHT IS MUSIC NIGHT (JUDY GARLAND SPECIAL), BBC Radio 2 * 1996, Mary in Jesus Chris Superstar in Concert BBC Radio 2 ===Music career=== \\"Lonely Symphony\\" was released as a single in the UK, as well as in other countries, and also appeared on her first solo album, Fragile. It reached number 25 in the UK Singles Chart in April 1994. Ruffelle's second album, Frances Ruffelle, came out in 1998, on the small Dress Circle label. It was a change in direction, featuring stripped-down arrangements of mostly musical theatre songs, as well as a couple of classics, original songs and covers. In 2004, she released Showgirl on her own label, a return to fuller arrangements, but far from a pop sound. Ruffelle also collaborated with Sam Bonner in the group, paTala, making an album called Purify, featuring \\"a fusion of traditional Sanskrit chants with unique arrangements of contemporary Western beats\\". A new solo album, Imperfectly Me, was released in September 2010.Francesruffelle.com ==Personal life== Ruffelle was born in Redbridge district of Ilford in London, England, UK. Her father is a phone company engineer and manager. Her mother is Sylvia Young, the founder of the famous theatre school at which Frances trained. Frances married director John Caird in 1990. They have two children: a daughter, Eliza Doolittle, and a son. ==DiscographyCast recordings=== * Starlight Express Original London Cast (1984) * Les Mis√©rables Original London Cast (1985) * Les Mis√©rables Original Broadway Cast (1987) * Mack & Mabel In Concert (1988) * Apples Original London Cast (1989) * Children of Eden Original London Cast (1991) * Les Mis√©rables Highlights Original London Cast (2009) ===Solo albums=== * Fragile (1994) * Frances Ruffelle (1998) * Showgirl (2004) * Purify (2005) as PaTala, with Sam Bonner * Imperfectly Me (2010) * I Say Yeh-Yeh (2015) ===Album appearances=== * Back of My Mind (Christopher Cross album) (1988) includes \\"I Will (Take You Forever)\\" duet * Michael Crawford Performs Andrew Lloyd Webber (1991) includes \\"Only You\\" duet * Save the Children: A Christmas Spectacular of Carols and Songs (1992) sings \\"I Watch You Sleeping\\", and featured on \\"Save the Children\\" * Corps & Armes (Etienne Daho album) (2000) ‚Äì includes \\"Le Brasier\\", co-written by Daho/Ruffelle/Helen Turner; also released as a single * The Definitive Christopher Cross (2001) includes \\"I Will (Take You Forever)\\" (new mix) ===Singles=== * \\"He's My Hero\\" (1986) * \\"On My Own\\" (rerecorded single version) (1985) ‚Äì from Les Mis√©rables * \\"On My Own\\" (second rerecorded single version) (1987) ‚Äì from Les Mis√©rables * \\"I Will (Take You Forever)\\" (1988) ‚Äì duet with Christopher Cross from Back of My Mind ‚Äì US Adult Contemporary Chart No. 41 * \\"Stranger to the Rain\\" (rerecorded single version) (1990) ‚Äì from Children of Eden * \\"Love Parade\\" (1994) * \\"Lonely Symphony (We Will Be Free)\\" (1994) ‚Äì UK Eurovision Song Contest entry * \\"Lose Your Illusions\\" (1994) * \\"God Watch Over You\\" (1995) * \\"Jennifer's Garden\\" (1997) (Denmark only) * \\"Blue Eyes\\" (1997) (Germany only) * \\"If a Wish Came True\\" (1998) (Netherlands only) * \\"Smile\\" (2004) ==References* * Interview with Frances Ruffelle on westendtheatre.com Category:1965 births Category:Alumni of the Sylvia Young Theatre School Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants for the United Kingdom Category:Drama Desk Award winners Category:English female singers Category:English musical theatre actresses Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants of 1994 Category:Living people Category:Theatre World Award winners Category:Tony Award winners Category:People from the London Borough of Redbridge Category:Actresses from London Category:Singers from London ","title":"Frances Ruffelle"},{"id":"2204198","text":"Londoners in Trafalgar Square on the evening of 14 July 2005 The 7 July Memorial in Hyde Park The London Memorial Garden set up by the City of Westminster in the Victoria Embankment Park, in remembrance of the victims of the terrorist attacks of 7 July 2005.(20 August 2005). \\"Bombings Memorial Garden Closes\\".

He was born to a family of Czechoslovak and Jewish ancestry and educated at Belle Vue Boys' Grammar School in Bradford during which time, in an interview for Talking Pictures TV Channel in April 2020, he mentioned his work on BBC Children's Hour at the former BBC Studios at Piccadilly, Manchester, where he came under the influence and guidance of Trevor Hill, Violet Carson and Doris Gamble. He then studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art where he won the Emile Littler award. He went on to leading parts at Coventry and Nottingham and appeared on Broadway in Chips with Everything as well taking over the role of Fagin from Roy Hudd in 1979 in the first London revival of Oliver! at the Albery Theatre. He also appeared in an Australian production called Funny Peculiar. He is best known for three television roles ‚Äì junior doctor Paul Collier in the comedy series Doctor in the House and its first two and last sequels Doctor at Large, Doctor in Charge and Doctor at the Top, that of Bombardier 'Solly' Solomons in the first two series of It Ain't Half Hot Mum, and as Des the mechanic in early episodes of Minder. == Life and career == Layton was born in Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England. His early television work includes Swizzlewick, Enter Solly Gold, United!, Thirty-Minute Theatre, Detective, What's in It For Me? and Lay Down Your Arms. He also made guest appearances in many classic British series, including The Likely Lads, Z-Cars, The Liver Birds, The Sweeney, Minder and played the lead in Len and the River Mob. In 1969 he played a small role in the Doctor Who story The Space Pirates. Later that year he made his debut as medical student Paul Collier in Doctor in the House. As well as continuing to star in the series and its sequels, in 1971, he began to co-write episodes with former co-star Jonathan Lynn, the first under the pseudonym Oliver Fry to conceal the new writer's identity from his fellow cast members. At the end of the Doctor in Charge series in 1973 he left the show (although he stayed on as a writer), and the following year he appeared in the first two series of It Ain't Half Hot Mum as Bombardier 'Solly' Solomons. He then joined forces with Jonathan Lynn once again to co-write and co-star in another sitcom My Brother's Keeper. He also appeared in Carry On Behind in 1975 playing a hospital doctor. Layton was also one of the main presenters on the original series of That's Life!, hosted by Esther Rantzen. His other television writing credits with Jonathan Lynn include episodes of On the Buses, Nearest and Dearest, Romany Jones and My Name Is Harry Worth. In the mid-1970s, he and Lynn began to write separately, and Layton became a regular writer of Robin's Nest, in which he also played a guest character. Following this, he created and wrote the sitcoms Don't Wait Up starring Nigel Havers and Tony Britton and Executive Stress with Geoffrey Palmer and Penelope Keith. In 1990, Don't Wait Up won the Television and Radio Industries Club's 'Best Comedy Series' award. Throughout the 1980s, as well as playing a recurring character in the hit comedy-drama Minder, he provided voices for the children's cartoons Pigeon Street and Joshua Jones, and was the voice behind Sydney, a character in a popular and long-running advertising campaign for Tetley tea. After a brief return to the role of Paul Collier in 1991's Doctor at the Top, he starred in the hit comedy-drama series Sunburn (1999‚Äì2000), playing Alan Brooks, area manager of Janus Holidays in Cyprus. His most recent acting appearances have been in Doctors, Holby City and Casualty. In 2006, he made five appearances in Dictionary Corner on the game show Countdown and made a guest appearance in an episode of Heartbeat. On 18 January 1999 Layton was the subject of This Is Your Life. He has also appeared on Lily Savage's Blankety Blank. Layton's less well-known voiceover work includes TV commercials for various financial products, and narration of promotional videos for property speculators Inside Track. In August 2012 Layton competed in Celebrity Masterchef. == Television roles == {class= \\"\\" ! Year !! Title !!

There also some records of Anglo-M√©tis families descending from relationships between British soldiers and Indigenous women of various tribes. They tended to identify more with the politically and economically dominant British culture of Canada at this time. If they were descended from Scottish fur traders and Indigenous women, they were often baptized as part of the Presbyterian church if their fathers chose to acknowledge their existence. Case studies have been done on the birth and baptism registers at the St. Gabriel Street Presbyterian Church in Montreal because it provides a good example of how M√©tis children adjusted to staying temporarily or living in an urban environment that was considerably foreign compared to the remote, rural fur trading settlements or Indigenous camps where they were born. Thus, most Anglo-M√©tis were the result of relationships, officially recognized by the Church or not, between English and Scottish fur traders and Indigenous women.Brown, J. S. H.

Edmonton: University of Alberta Press. The ethnicity of their fathers also determined which of the competing fur trading companies they might end up working for as adults. If they were descended from English fur traders, they generally worked for the Hudson's Bay Company. If they were descended from Scottish fur traders, they generally worked for the North West Company, also known as \\"Nor'Westers.\\" Additionally, the Anglo-M√©tis / Countryborn had a more sedentary lifestyle of farming than the francophone M√©tis community, whose men were generally hunters and trappers. The French-speaking M√©tis were somewhat more nomadic, due to their reliance upon hunting as a trade and food resource. The Anglo-M√©tis played a role in both the Red River Rebellion (or \\"Red River Uprising\\") of 1869 and the Northwest Rebellion (or \\"Northwest Uprising\\") of 1885, as they suffered from similar issues of racial discrimination and land problems as their francophone brethren. By the 19th century the English- speaking and French-speaking M√©tis had become culturally quite similar, moving closer to each other in opposition to the British-Canadian majority. Their musical traditions, especially in the case of fiddle music, was derived from both British Isles and French origins, as was the M√©tis traditional dance referred to as \\"jigging\\", or the \\"Red River Jig\\". In complexion they ranged from fair skinned, blond and blue eyed through dark skinned, with dark hair and dark eyes. M√©tis elders say that no distinctions were made between individuals based upon complexion within the community. Family, culture, and strong identification with their Christian faith were the unifying bond amongst them. The two communities' primary differences lay in their languages and Christian religious affiliations; the French speakers were generally Roman Catholic and those of British descent were Protestant. Most Countryborn were Anglican or Presbyterian. They were involved in a mixed economy of subsistence farming and bison hunting throughout most of the 19th century; they also found employment with the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company. The Countryborn were often known in the 19th century as \\"mixed- bloods\\", \\"Black Scots\\", \\"Native English\\" or \\"halfbreeds\\" (a term now considered pejorative). The French-speaking Metis referred to them simply as les m√©tis anglais or les autres m√©tis. Anglo-Metis gradually came to see themselves as little different from the French-speaking M√©tis. Today, the two groups are no longer politically distinct, and are commonly known on the Canadian Prairies simply as M√©tis. Prominent Anglo-M√©tis / Countryborn include James Isbister, Thomas McKay and John Norquay, the Premier of Manitoba from 1878 to 1887. ==See also== *Anglo *Bungee language *Halcro, Saskatchewan *Hudson's Bay Company *Michif *M√©tis Flag *M√©tis people (Canada) *M√©tis people (United States) *Prince Albert, Saskatchewan *Red River Colony == References == * Barkwell, Lawrence J., Leah Dorion, and Audreen Hourie.

It was approved by the FDA in 1988. Its use is approved worldwide. == Properties == Pure avobenzone is a whitish to yellowish crystalline powder with a weak odor, dissolving in isopropanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, decyl oleate, capric acid/caprylic, triglycerides and other oils. It is not soluble in water. Avobenzone is a dibenzoylmethane derivative. Avobenzone exists in the ground state as a mixture of the enol and keto forms, favoring the chelated enol. This enol form is stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen-bonding within the Œ≤-diketone. Its ability to absorb ultraviolet light over a wider range of wavelengths than many other sunscreen agents has led to its use in many commercial preparations marketed as \\"broad spectrum\\" sunscreens. Avobenzone has an absorption maximum of 357 nm. It is subject to keto-enol tautomerism and exists predominantly enol when dissolved. Upon UV radiation, it may convert to keto form, while converting back to enol form after placing in dark. Keto-Enol-Gleichgewicht in 1,3-Diketonen === Stability === Avobenzone is sensitive to the properties of the solvent, being relatively stable in polar protic solvents and unstable in nonpolar environments. Also, when it is irradiated with UVA light, it generates a triplet excited state in the keto form which can either cause the avobenzone to degrade or it can transfer energy to biological targets and cause deleterious effects. Avobenzone has been shown to degrade significantly in light, resulting in less protection over time.Image:Free text.png The UV-A light in a day of sunlight in a temperate climate is sufficient to break down most of the compound. Data presented to the Food and Drug Administration by the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association indicates a -36% change in avobenzone's UV absorbance following one hour of exposure to sunlight. This degradation can be reduced by using a photostabilizer, like octocrylene. Other photostabilizers include: * 4-Methylbenzylidene camphor (USAN Enzacamene) * Tinosorb S (USAN Bemotrizinol, INCI Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine) * Tinosorb M (USAN Bisoctrizole, INCI Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol) * Butyloctyl Salicylate (Tradename HallBrite BHB - ) * Hexadecyl Benzoate * Butyloctyl Benzoate * HallBrite PSF (INCI Undecylcrylene DimethiconeE) * Mexoryl SX (USAN Ecamsule, INCI Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid) * Synoxyl HSS (INCI Trimethoxybenzylidene Pentanedione) RK Chaudhuri, MA Ollengo, P Singh and BS Martincigh, 3-(3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzylidene)-2,4-pentanedione: Design of a Novel Photostabilizer with In-vivo SPF Boosting Properties and Its Use in Developing Broad-spectrum Sunscreen Formulations, International Journal of Cosmetic Science, 39(1):25-35, 2017; First published 29 June 2016  doi: 10.1111/ics.12344 * Corapan TQ (INCI Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate) * Parsol SLX (INCI Polysilicone-15)http://www.dsm.com/en_US/downloads/dnp/Parsol_SLX_Skin.pdf * Oxynex ST (INCI Diethylhexyl Syringylidene Malonate * Polycrylene (INCI Polyester-8)http://www.hallstar.com/techdocs/Polycrylene&CorapanTQAvobenzoneStabilization.pdf; * SolaStay S1 (INCI Ethylhexyl Methoxycrylene) Complexing avobenzone with cyclodextrins may also increase its photostability. Formulations of avobenzone with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin have shown significant reduction in photo-induced degradation, as well as increased transdermal penetration of the UV absorber. According to some studies, \\"the most effective sunscreens contain avobenzone and titanium dioxide.\\" Avobenzone can degrade faster in light in combination with mineral UV absorbers like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, though with the right coating of the mineral particles this reaction can be reduced.Stability Study of Avobenzone with Inorganic Sunscreens, Kobo Products Poster, 2001, Online version A manganese doped titanium dioxide may be better than undoped titanium dioxide to improve avobenzone's stability. === Various === As an enolate, avobenzone forms with heavy metal ions (such as Fe3+) colored complexes, and chelating agents can be added to suppress them. Stearates, aluminum, magnesium and zinc salts can lead to poorly soluble precipitates. Manufacturers also recommend to avoid the inclusion of iron and ferric salts, heavy metals, formaldehyde donors and PABA and PABA esters. The makers of Coppertone advise that avobenzone binds iron and can cause staining of clothes washed in iron-rich water. The staining properties of sunblock made with avobenzone are particularly noticeable on fiberglass boats with white gelcoat. Avobenzone also reacts with boron trifluoride to form a stable crystalline complex that is highly fluorescent under UV irradiation. The emission color of the crystals depends on the molecular packing of the boron avobenzone complex. The photoluminescence may also be altered by mechanical force in the solid state, resulting in a phenomenon called \\"mechanochromic luminescence\\". The altered emission color recovers itself slowly at room temperature or more swiftly at higher temperatures. === Absorbance Spectrum === Avobenzone has a peak absorbance around 360 nm when dissolved. The peak may shift slightly depending on the solvent. Absorbance of 0.01 g-L avobenzone in DMSO == Preparation == The compound is prepared by reacting 4-tert- butylbenzoic methyl ester (from 4-tert-butylbenzoic acid by esterification with methanol) with 4-methoxyacetophenone in toluene in the presence of sodium amide via Claisen condensation. Synthese Avobenzon According to a recent patent application, yields of up to 95% are obtained with the same starting materials in toluene in the presence of potassium methoxide. == Safety == Although avobenzone is considered safe, disintegration products may have significant health impacts and persist in the environment. A recent study at Lomonosov Moscow State University found that chlorinated water and ultraviolet light can cause avobenzone to disintegrate into various other organic compounds, including; aromatic acids, aldehydes, phenols, and acetophenones which may have adverse health effects. ==See also== *Sun protection factor ==Notes== Category:Aromatic ketones Category:Piceol ethers Category:Sunscreening agents Category:Tert-butyl compounds ","title":"Avobenzone"},{"id":"2204231","text":"Norsk H√∏stfest (Norwegian language: \\"Norwegian Autumn Festival\\") is an annual festival held each fall in Minot, North Dakota. It is North America's largest Scandinavian festival. ==History== The event is held on the North Dakota State Fair grounds in Minot, North Dakota. Tens of thousands of people attend the Norsk H√∏stfest to celebrate and partake in the Scandinavian culture and entertainment. Altogether it has hosted cultural touchstones from Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Greenland, √Öland, Faroe Islands, German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands.Norsk Hostfest getting under way in Minot (Minot Daily News September 27, 2008) The festival was founded in 1978 by former North Dakota senator and mayor of Minot, Chester Reiten (1923-2013), and a group of friends who shared his interest in celebrating their Nordic heritage. The festival is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that raises funds to preserve, improve and share Scandinavian culture, heritage and educational programs. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, Norsk H√∏stfest cancelled its annual event for the first time ever. ==Activities== Highlights of the fall festival include announcing the annual Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame inductees. The Hall of Fame is an enduring means of honoring those persons of Scandinavian descent in North America who have achieved greatness in their fields of endeavor and/or whose efforts have contributed significantly to the betterment of mankind. Other remarkable honors include the selection of the annual Miss Norsk H√∏stfest and naming of the Chester Award, which recognizes festival excellence in five categories: artisan, exhibitor, food concessionaire, volunteer and chairman. Norsk H√∏stfest features a number of Nordic exhibits with internationally recognized artisans, craftsmen and chefs participating. The cuisine as well as the clothes, art and jewelry are authentic, fine quality and exquisitely Nordic. During H√∏stfest week (end of September through first few days of October), presenters associated with the festival travel to the surrounding area where they introduce Nordic heritage and culture to students in an effort named \\"H√∏stfest In The Schools\\". Additionally, Scandinavian Youth Camp is held the weekend prior to H√∏stfest. Children participating in the camps also perform at H√∏stfest in scheduled events such as the Troll beauty contest, Norwegian Folk dance, Swedish Maypole dancers, and the Troll parade. There are several headliner acts booked each night of the event, not limited to the event's Scandinavian theme.

This riot was a series of racially charged violent disturbances that occurred in Plainfield, New Jersey, which mirrored the 1967 Newark riots in nearby Newark. ==Background== Two days after some African Americans began protesting and rioting in Newark in 1967, the Plainfield riots began. Plainfield is located about 18 miles southwest of Newark, and about a third of Plainfield's 48,000 citizen were African Americans then. Tensions remained high that summer through the night of Friday, July 14 when a fight broke out at a local diner, The White Star. Afterwards, about 40 young black men left the diner and marched back to their housing project in the West End section of Plainfield. They vented their anger along the way by smashing store windows and throwing rocks at police cars. When the local police showed up in force, the group dispersed. The White Star Diner, which still stands today, was depicted by artist Casey Ruble in 2015. ==The riot== On Saturday night trouble started again. Many long time residents of Plainfield claimed that \\"outside agitators\\" who did not live in Plainfield came into the city to provoke violence and to \\"rile up\\" the community. Some were white men and some were black men and the hatred they fanned was infectious. Rioting and looting increased and Molotov cocktails were thrown at fire trucks responding to calls. Police from surrounding jurisdictions were called in and the crowds finally dispersed when a heavy rain started to fall early Sunday morning. On Sunday afternoon several hundred people gathered at Green Brook Park to hear the local Director of Human Relations talk about the situation in the city. The Union County, New Jersey Park Police, who had jurisdiction over the park, declared the meeting unlawful and ordered the crowd to disperse. Some reported that the police dismissively referred to the gatherers as \\"boys\\" in urging them to leave the park, which was taken as racially inflammatory and may have led to anger. The crowd broke up and reformed in the West End section of Plainfield where widespread rioting started again. The city police were caught off guard and did not respond quickly enough to quell the disorder. ===Murder of Officer John Gleason=== Later that evening a white police officer, John Gleason, was manning a checkpoint. Members of the white motorcycle gang known as the Pagans entered the area and a confrontation between a large group of young black men and the white members of the Pagans was brewing. Police Officer John Gleason placed himself between the two groups and the Pagan motorcycle gang left. The remaining crowd refused to disperse and Officer Gleason became surrounded by the crowd which began to threaten him and close in on him. Officer Gleason fired a shot and wounded Bobby Lee Williams. When the officer tried to leave the area to get help, he was overtaken by a mob and was beaten with a steel grocery store cart, stomped and eventually shot and killed with his own service revolver. ==Middlesex arms theft== That same night in nearby Middlesex an arms factory was broken into and 46 automatic weapons were stolen.Bechir Kenzari, Architecture and Violence (2011) at 251 (\\"The Plainfield riots were extraordinarily violent, in part because a break-in at the Plainfield Machine Company, a small manufacturer of military-style M1 carbines, resulted in the informal distribution [of the guns] on the street. In one incident, a fire station sustained gunfire for five hours before New Jersey National Guardsmen in armored personnel carriers broke the siege.\\") The Plainfield Machine Company was a small manufacturing company owned by William Haas and William Stork that, among other things, produced M1 carbines for the civilian market. The stolen guns were passed out to the men on the streets of Plainfield that very night. The police were anxious because of the large number of guns now on the streets and the Plainfield Fire Department Station was under constant gunfire for five hours. The bullet holes in the brick facade of the building remain to this day. Finally, New Jersey National Guardsmen, in armored personnel carriers relieved the station. Police tried to arrange a truce and have residents turn in the stolen carbines. Black residents felt that having the guns in the community kept the police at bay and that they now had power over the police. When none of the stolen firearms were returned, the area was cordoned off and 300 heavily armed New Jersey State Police and National Guardsmen started a house-to-house search for the stolen weapons. After about an hour and a half, with 66 homes searched, the operation was called off. The police felt that since Governor Hughes had declared a State of Emergency, no search warrants were needed. ==Aftermath== By July 21, things had calmed down to the point where National Guard troops and state police could be pulled out of the city. Dozens of black residents later filed suit against the government claiming that their constitutional rights had been violated during the search for the stolen carbines. Even several weeks after the riot, the local police and FBI were still looking for the stolen weapons. No arrests had been made in the theft and only a few of the guns had been recovered. More than 100 people had been arrested for looting and rioting during the disturbance. Officer Gleason was the only person killed during the riot and in December 1968, a jury convicted two people, a man and a woman, of murder in his death. They were both sentenced to life imprisonment. Seven others were acquitted and one case was declared a mistrial because of a deadlocked jury. ==Legacy== Like many cities, Plainfield suffered a decline from the stigma of the riots, and many of the burned and looted businesses remained vacant for over four decades. Several residents decamped for neighboring towns like Edison, Scotch Plains, Watchung, Warren, Westfield and Bridgewater. Many residents abandoned their houses after leaving, as the massive number of people selling their property resulted in people being unable to sell them (or at massively reduced prices). After leaving, since the owners did not want to live there anymore but could not sell, they sometimes let them fall into foreclosure. After a while many of them ended up derelict. Many of the houses were also turned into multi family homes. It remains one of the poorest urban areas in the state with a 16 percent poverty rate including over 7 percent having an income less than 50 percent of poverty level. Author and Plainfield native Isaiah Tremaine published the book Insurrection in 2017 as an accounting of the Plainfield riots from his perspective as a black teenager living in the city at the time. In July 2017, the Plainfield Anti-Violence Coalition held a memorial event to discuss and commemorate the 50th anniversary of the rebellion. ==See also== *1967 Detroit riot in Michigan *1967 Newark riots in New Jersey *Cambridge riot of 1967 in Maryland *List of incidents of civil unrest in the United States ==References== * The National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders,The Report of The National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, March 1, 1968.

He was born in Dirranbandi, and lived there until he was involved in a pub fight, when the local police officer told him to leave before investigators from Brisbane could arrive when he was identified as a person of interest in a subsequent murder investigation. He moved to Sydney, and ended up living in Bondi, working as a bouncer in an illegal casino in Kings Cross. In later books it turns from an illegal casino to a bridge club, as the club's owner Price Galese has further trouble bribing Police and Government officials to ignore the casino's presence. Les' career provides many opportunities for training, fighting, sex, dancing, photography, reflection and the odd mystery solving. Les played rugby league for Easts during his early days in Sydney. He drives around in an old 1968 Ford Falcon in the early stories. In later stories he drives a late model Holden Commodore Berlina that belonged to a man who was murdered in the car. Les tolerates the smell which persists despite having the car regularly detailed. In the later stories he has a house in Bondi which he shares with an advertising executive called Warren who loves to smoke pot and whose job takes him away from time to time. ==List of Les Norton Books (in chronological order)== * You Wouldn't Be Dead for Quids * The Real Thing * The Boys From Binjiwunyawunya * The Godson * Between the Devlin And The Deep Blue Seas * White Shoes, White Lines and Blackie * And De Fun Don't Done * Mele Kalikimaka Mr Walker * The Day of The Gecko * Rider on the Storm and Other Bits and Barrett * Guns 'N' Rose * Mud Crab Boogie * Goodoo Goodoo * The Wind and the Monkey * Leaving Bondi * Mystery Bay Blues * Rosa-Marie's Baby * Crime Scene Cessnock * Les Norton and the Case of the Talking Pie Crust * High Noon in Nimbin ==Legacy== In 2000, the Avoca Beach Surf Life Saving Club launched one of its surfboats as the Les Norton.

It marked a return to a more abrasive sound for the group, as well as incorporating elements of alternative dance grooves. The title refers to one of the band's early hits, \\"Just Like Honey\\", and is intended to demonstrate a complete departure from their earlier musical style. The album's first single, \\"Reverence\\", attracted some controversy for the lyrics \\"I want to die just like Jesus Christ\\", and \\"I want to die just like JFK\\". Banned by Top of the Pops, the track peaked at #10 in the UK charts and received airplay in the United States on alternative radio stations. Honey's Dead was recorded in the band's London studio, the aptly named \\"Drugstore\\", with accomplished engineer Flood and future JaMC producer Alan Moulder on board (not to mention a considerably larger bankroll). Alternative and campus radio stations picked up \\"Far Gone and Out\\" which remains one of the band's most popular singles to date, peaking at #23 in the band's native UK. The Mary Chain shared the bill during parts of Lollapalooza 1992 in the U.S. with Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Ministry, Lush, Ice Cube and Red Hot Chili Peppers. Anheuser Busch even used the samples of \\"Sugar Ray\\" as a background bed for their Bud Ice television commercials in 1993. Honey's Dead was on the short list of nominees for the 1992 Mercury Prize. The album posts a close second in sales to (1994) release Stoned & Dethroned (which contains the hit single \\"Sometimes Always\\" with Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star). The Reid brothers alternate between singing duties on tracks (most likely coinciding with songwriting duties). ==Artwork== The album cover art features a detail from the painting Ophelia (First Version) by the Pre-Raphaelite painter Arthur Hughes.

The name coh√≠ba derives from the Ta√≠no word for \\"tobacco\\". The Cuban brand is filled with tobacco that comes from the Vuelta Abajo region of Cuba which has undergone an extra fermentation process. Cuban Cohiba was established in 1966 as a limited production private brand supplied exclusively to Fidel Castro and high-level officials in the Communist Party of Cuba and Cuban government. Often given as diplomatic gifts, the Cohiba brand gradually developed a \\"cult\\" status. It was first released commercially for sale to the public in 1982. The Cohiba Siglo VI has received some of the highest scores in the line from blind reviews, including a 93 from Cigar Aficionadohttp://www.cigaraficionado.com/cigars/detail/source/search/note_id/17453 and a 90 from Blind Man's Puff.http://www.blindmanspuff.com/blind-cigar- review-cohiba-siglo-vi/ The US Cohiba brand name was registered in the United States by the General Cigar Company in 1978 and cigars using that trademark have been produced for the American market in the Dominican Republic on a large scale from 1997. This Cohiba is related to the Cuban product in name only, containing no Cuban tobacco, and thus is the only \\"Cohiba\\" that can be sold legally in the United States. == Cuban Cohiba History=== Cuban Cohiba's origins trace back to the middle 1960s, when a bodyguard of Fidel Castro shared some of his private supply of cigars made by a local artisan named Eduardo Ribera.Anwer Bati, The Cigar Companion: The Connoisseur's Guide. Third Edition. Philadelphia and London: Running Press, 1997; pp. 76-77. These cigars pleased Castro so much that a special production of the unbranded blend, produced under tight security, was made for Castro and other top government officials. As Castro himself recalled the tale in 1994: > \\"I used to see the man smoking a very aromatic, very nice cigar, and I asked > him what brand he was smoking. He told me that it was a special blend, but > that it came from a friend who makes cigars and he gave them to him. I said, > let's find this man. I tried the cigar, and I found it so good that we got > in touch with him and asked him how he made it. Then we set up the house > [the El Laguito factory], and he explained the blend of tobacco he used. He > told which leaves he used from which tobacco plantations. He also told us > about the wrappers he used and other things. We found a group of cigar > makers. We gave them the material and that is how the factory was founded. > Now Cohiba is known all over the world.\\"Marvin R. Shanken, \\"A Conversation > with Fidel,\\" Cigar Aficionado, vol. 2, no. 4 (Summer 1994), pg. 50. The production of special cigars for top officials under conditions of tight security was given extra impetus by fears of ongoing CIA assassination efforts against Fidel and Raul Castro and Che Guevara. The technical services department of the agency is now in fact known to have worked on the development of exploding cigars as a means of assassination from the early 1960s.Duncan Campbell, \\"638 Ways to Kill Castro,\\" The Guardian, August 3, 2006. The Cuban Cohiba brand was formally launched in 1968 at the direction of Cubatabaco, the Cuban state tobacco marketing bureau.James Suckling, \\"The Legend of Cohiba: Cigar Lovers Everywhere dream of Cuba's Finest Cigar,\\" Cigar Aficionado, vol. 1, no. 1 (Autumn 1992), pp. 42-49. The head of Cubatabaco asked Avelino Lara, head of the El Laguito factory, to create a new super- premium blend which differed from all previously existing Cuban cigars. During the first few years of production only a few thousand boxes were produced annually, reserved for the use of high government officials and frequently given away as diplomatic gifts. The Cuban Cohiba brand was launched as a premium cigar brand into markets outside of the US in 1982 in conjunction with the 1982 World Cup held in Spain. At the time of its first public launch, the Cohiba marque consisted of just three vitolas (sizes): the Panetela, the Corona Especial, and the Lancero. In 1989 three more vitolas were added: the Robusto, the Exquisito, and the Espl√©ndido. These first six are now collectively known as the company's L√≠nea Cl√°sica (classic line). In 1992 Habanos SA launched the first sizes in what it calls the L√≠nea 1492, commemorating Christopher Columbus and his voyage to the Americas, with each size named for a century since Columbus' discovery. The initial launch included the Siglo I, Siglo II, Siglo III, Siglo IV, and Siglo V, with a Siglo VI added in 2002. Besides regular production, Habanos SA regularly releases limited release Coh√≠ba cigars for such events as the annual Habanos Festival, brand anniversaries, and their annual Edici√≥n Limitada (limited edition) release of special sizes of their various cigar brands wrapped in a darker vintage leaf. In 2007, Habanos released a new line of maduro-wrapped Cohibas, called \\"Maduro 5,\\" in three sizes. The Cuban Cohiba brand also carries two machine-made extensions cigarillos: the Mini and the Club. Habanos SA have used their Cohiba brand name for non-cigar products, manufacturing Cohiba cigarettes since 1987 and Extra Cohiba Cognac since 1999. In 1992 approximately 3.4 million cigars were produced in Cuba bearing the Cohiba label, out of a total Cuban cigar export production of approximately 60 million pieces.\\"Interview: Francisco Padron, Havana, November 1992,\\" Cigar Aficionado, vol. 1, no. 3 (Spring 1993), pg. 43. ===Tobaccos=== Three authentic Cuban-made Cohiba Cigars Cuban Cohibas have historically been known to use some of the finest cigar tobacco available in Cuba. The tobacco for Cohiba is selected from the finest Vegas Finas de Primera (first-class tobacco fields) in the San Luis and San Juan y Martinez zones of the Vuelta Abajo region of Pinar del R√≠o Province. In 1992 just 10 carefully selected fields totaling about 700 acres were used for production of the Cohiba brand, their exact location a carefully guarded trade secret. The production of these fields is further selected for quality, with the output of just five of these fields used in Cohiba production in an average year. The tobacco used to fill the cigars is unique among Cuban brands owing to a special third fermentation in wooden barrels at the El Laguito factory, aimed at producing a smoother flavor than other cigars. Originally all Cohibas were made at the El Laguito factory, a mansion located on the outskirts of Havana converted into a cigar- rolling school for women in 1961. Production of some Cohiba vitolas was later expanded to the Partagas factory in Havana, which manufactures its Cohiba product from pre-blended tobacco received from El Laguito. Cohiba cigars tend to be medium to full-bodied in flavor. ===Vitolas in the Cohiba line=== cabinet box of Cohiba Robustos The following list of vitolas de salida (commercial vitolas) within the Cohiba marque lists their size and ring gauge in Imperial (and Metric), their vitolas de galera (factory vitolas), and their common name in American cigar slang.

The Cuban industry contended that the brand names were the property of the nation, however, and parallel use of the same brand name resulted.Some examples of dual Cuban and non-Cuban use of pre-revolutionary brand names include Punch, Hoyo de Monterrey, Ramon Allones, Romeo y Julieta, Monterrey, Fonseca, H. Upmann, Partagas, and H. Upmann. See: \\"Cigars 101,\\" Cigar Aficionado, vol. 1, no. 4 (Summer 1993), pg. 43. Additionally, post-revolutionary trademark uncertainty and a US embargo against all Cuban goods made possible the relaunch of other Cuban brand names by private companies in other countries. The General Cigar Company, a private firm having no relation whatsoever to the Cuban cigar industry, first registered the name Cohiba in the United States in 1978 and subsequently began selling cigars under the Cohiba brand in that country in the 1980s. Manufacture and sales of General Cigar's brand was significantly expanded during the 1990s cigar boom, with General Cigar's product known colloquially as \\"Red Dot Cohiba,\\" owing to the red dot in the middle of the \\"O\\" in \\"Cohiba\\" on its bands and boxes. In response to General Cigar's use of the Cohiba name, Cubatabaco, the government-run company in charge of cigars, and half-owner of Habanos SA along with Altadis SA, launched a long-running legal campaign to have General Cigar's trademark revoked. These legal fisticuffs were resolved on June 19, 2006, when the U. S. Supreme Court [ denied] Cubatabaco's petition. As a result, the February 2005 decision of the U. S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals (Docket #04-2527), which confirmed General Cigar Company‚Äôs exclusive ownership of the Cohiba trademark in the United States, is final.Empresa Cubana del Tabaco v. Culbro Corp., 399 F.3d 462 (2d Cir. 2005). The General Cigar-made Cohiba cigars now have a disclaimer on boxes that they are not affiliated in any way with the Cuban brand. However, the United States government, in an amicus curiae brief filed in the Supreme Court, acknowledged that Cubatabaco could request U.S. government permission for judicial protection of the brand from the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which administers the U.S. embargo. Cubatabaco has stated that they intend to pursue this course of action. In a November 1992 interview, director of Cubatabaco Francisco Padr√≥n indicated that in the event the American embargo of Cuban products were ended, return of the Cohiba brand name to Cubatabaco would be a prerequisite for any future distribution agreement with General Cigar Co. \\"The first condition is that they must pass the brand name to us. This is the first condition. Immediately. If not, forget about it,\\" Padr√≥n declared. US Supreme Court hands Cuba a victory over its cigars February 25, 2015 The US Supreme Court declined to intervene in a long- running battle between a US and Cuban company over the Cohiba cigar trademark. By refusing to hear an appeal, the country's highest court leaves intact a ruling in favor of the Cuban firm. Due to a US trade embargo with Cuba, Cubatabaco cannot sell its Cohiba cigars in the United States while they are sold worldwide and in Cuba. US company General Cigar sells its Dominican Republic-produced Cohiba cigars in the US. The legal dispute is over whether the Cuban company has to the right to challenge General Cigar‚Äôs trademark in the US, despite the embargo, as reported by Agence France Presse. General Cigar obtained a US registration for Cohiba in 1981 and a second registration in 1995. Cubatabaco had the trademark registered in Cuba in 1972. In the late 70s, it began registering the logo outside Cuba ‚Äì in 115 countries ‚Äì but was prohibited from selling merchandise in the US by the Cuban Assets Control Regulation (CACR). In the case, Cubatabaco argued the CACR not only prevented the company from selling in the US, but also prevented it from challenging General Cigar's registrations. In June 2014, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in favor of the Cuban company by giving it standing to seek a cancelation of the registrations that block its own ability to register trademarks. The case will now move forward to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. The challenge comes two months after President Obama announced in December that he planned to loosen some of the US-Cuba restrictions, including the easing of the decades-long trade embargo. Under an easing of travel restrictions between the US and Cuba, American visitors will be able to buy and take home as many as 100 cigars.https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/14/us- announces-further-easing-of-trade-travel-and-financial-restrictions-with- cuba.html == See also == * Cigar brands * Cohiba (cigarette) == Footnotes == ==Further reading== * Anwer Bati, The Cigar Companion: The Connoisseur's Guide.
