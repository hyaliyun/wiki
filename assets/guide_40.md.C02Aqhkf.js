Photo of 1945. The Church of Mary Magdalene of Buda () is one of the oldest churches of the Várkerület District (Buda Castle District). It was built between the 13th and 15th centuries in Gothic style. Today only ruins and the tower of the church remains. For centuries, the Church of Mary Magdalene was the forum of the population of Buda District. Then, the church became the site of the coronation of Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor as Hungarian king, and finally as the central church of the garrison of the Buda Castle. ==History== In the 13th century, after the Mongol destruction of the Buda Castle, the church was built in the Castle Hill (Várhegy), which between the second half of the 13th century and today the hill remain similar: the royal accommodation in the south, the Church of the Assumption (Matthias Church), and to the north the Church of Mary Magdalene. The Church of the Blessed Virgin was for the German-speaking that lived in Budapest and the Church of Mary Magdalene was the church of the Hungarian population. At that time, the northern part of the castle hill was called Szombathely Square, which used to host the grand fairs on Saturday, which was ran from the today's Vienna Gate to the Úri Street and included the then vacant lot of the Lutheran church. At the southwestern corner of the square was the Gothic church, originally of a one nave and then in 1400 was expanded. According to contemporary depictions, the tower was covered with a pyramid. A series of alterations were completed at the late-15th century, this is the time when the late Gothic church consisting of six vault sections and with an expanded presbytery. During the Fifteen Years' War (1591-1606) the building was taken away from Christians and was later known as a Muslim place of worship known as Fetih (Victory) and Saat (Time). The church was owned by the Franciscans between 1698-1786 and was used for archival material. After a decree of Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor in 1786, which finished the Franciscan order ownership, the church during many years was used for the preservation of archival material, and in 1792 was crowned here Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor (then was built a lobby in Zopf style, with covered driveways). Ignác Martinovics was deprived of his priestly dignity here, and a lawsuit against his participants who led the Jacobin Movement of Hungary took place in this monastery where prisoners were kept. In 1817 the Buda headquarters was moved to the monastery and the church became the garrison church, where military services were held. The driveways were demolished, and in the 1820s the onion dome was replaced by a bell tower. In the 1920s it received a night-time decorative lighting and a heating system, but no changes were made to the building. In 1938 the church was turned into a museum. During the Allied Siege of Budapest of 1944 several bombs hit the building: cracks appeared on the tower; the northwest corner of the floor collapsed; the roof of its long house, the walls of the sanctuary and the chapels were almost completely collapsed. However, the real destruction of the Church of Mary Magdalene was not by the war but the \\"restoration\\" of the 1950s: in vain in 1946 Kálmán Lux made the plan to restore the church, in vain the rebuilding of the roof and the shrine began in 1950, and the church building was demolished at the personal request of Mátyás Rákosi, an anti-church communist regime. Only its bell tower and the side chapels escaped from the destruction, thanks to József Csemegi for its rescue as a Rákosi pantheon. In 1986, the ruin garden was formed in front of the tower, showing the floor plan of a one nave church. The size of the former church is illustrated by the Gothic sanctuary window set up opposite the tower. In 1956, a mine blast struck the tower pile, then it was restored. Plans have been made for the functions of the church were expanded, and finally a store selling minerals, jewelry and artwork operated in the tower for a few years. The rebuilding of the temple was proposed in 1989, when the design of a three-nave Gothic-style building with a glass facade of chrome steel was revealed. The idea was soon forgotten, and the structure of the church was not reopened until 1999. At the request of the College of the Ministry of Defense, architect Mihály Balázs, co-designer of the Church of the Hungarian Saints in Lágymányos, made plans for the reconstruction. According to Balázs's plans, he would have restored the Gothic tower with a suitable Goulash dome, and would have built a new church nave that would fill the gap in the square, which would fit the mass and height of the surrounding buildings. It does not take a stand in either the Gothic state, with its asymmetrical proportions and heights of the ledge, and it is abundant in contemporary solutions. The main nave would have been joined by a historic museum building. However, due to personnel changes at the Ministry of Defense, the plan has been \\"postponed\\" for several years. The basic concept, however, has been attacked by many: \\"what is the need for a church of this size in the Castle District, with more churches, but lacking basic tourist functions, for example?\\" Since then, a gallery has been operating in the tower, but anyone can rent it for organizing an event, although heating is not possible. For the last time, during Heritage Days, they wanted to \\"rebuild\\" the church, albeit for a few minutes, using laser technology; but the wind that blown out the artificial smoke and the blackout prevented it, in any case, thanks to the combination of the tower, the ruin garden and the sanctuary window, the former claims of the former church lady; or as Antal Szerb wrote in 1935, entitled \\"Budapest Guide for Mariners\\" series, \\"of the magnificently large, yet complete building: Westminster Abbey bigger, but there will be no man next to it […] Cross and flee.\\" ==Gallery== File:Church of Mary Magdalene in 1541 Budapest Erhard Schön.jpgChurch of Mary Magdalene in 1541.

However, in the meantime, British troops had liberated Bergen-Belsen concentration camp and the students were diverted there on the day they were due to travel to the Netherlands. The students had previously spent most of the Second World War at school and in medical training. The students were tasked with taking over one or two of the 200 camp huts each, with the responsibility of cleaning and feeding the survivors and supervising a fair distribution of food. Their work was instrumental in reducing the death rate from over 500 a day at liberation to less than 100 a day by mid-May 1945. Sources show that twelve students came from each of Guy's Hospital, St Thomas', St Mary's, The London and University College, eleven from Westminster, nine from St Bartholomew's, eight from the Middlesex and the remainder from King's. The Imperial War Museum holds a number of the students' letters and diaries which were a source for Ben Shephard's 2005 book After Daybreak: The Liberation of Belsen, 1945. Their story has also been portrayed in the 2007 feature-length drama, The Relief of Belsen.

The total number of students who volunteered was more than 100 and they were therefore shortlisted by ballot. Somewhere between 95 and 100 took part, with the exact number uncertain. Up until this time, these students had spent the larger part of the Second World War at school and in medical education.Suzanne Bardgett in the Foreword of Michael Hargrave's Bergen-Belsen 1945: A Medical Student's Journal. World Scientific (2014). Several students had previously attended Epsom College. ==Journey to Belsen== At the end of April 1945, the students were immunised against typhoid, typhus and diphtheria. Dressed in battledress, at 2pm on 28 April 1945, they met the British Red Cross at 5, Lowndes Street after having some official photographs taken. Student Michael Hargrave described in his diary that day that there were \\"some very faked photographs of me shaking hands with the Dean - supposed to be saying goodbye\\".Hargrave, Michael John (2014). Bergen-Belsen 1945: A Medical Student's Journal. London: Imperial College Press, p. 1-4. Upon arrival at Lowndes Street, they were given their passports, ranking cards and military documents. They were to fly to Holland. However, Belsen, in Germany, had in the interim been liberated by British troops and a request for extra help was made upon realising the extent of the problems there. The students were subsequently informed that they would be re- directed to Belsen. Hargrave, wrote that same day \\"this was the first news we had been given about going to Belsen but we were all so excited abound, after a month of waiting, that we did not think much about the change in destination\\". Over the following few days, six Dakotas set off from Cirencester with the destination of Celle in Germany. Due to problems with the weather, the aircraft arrived at Celle on different days, with two having to return to Cirencester via Croydon. They were to be under the supervision of nutritionist Arnold Peter Meiklejohn. ==Belsen== The scene at Bergen-Belsen, April 1945 ===Arrival=== The first students arrived at Belsen at the end of April 1945, with the remaining students reaching the camp at the beginning of May 1945. Following a briefing by Meiklejohn on 2 May 1945, they began work at Camp 1 the following day. ===Roles=== London medical students at work in Belsen Bergen Belsen: human laundry. Belsen Concentration Camp. Human laundry Initially, the role of the students was to take over one or two of the 200 huts each, with the responsibility of getting them cleaned (human laundry) and supervising the feeding of and fair distribution of food to the inmates. The association of intravenous feeding and Nazi activities rendered this kind of feeding inappropriate. An unpopular mixture known as the \\"Bengal mixture\\" was used for feeding. In addition to malnutrition and starvation, tuberculosis, typhus and cancrum oris were common, and later Wernicke's encephalopathy and pellagra. Some of the challenges the students faced were reported by student Thomas Gibson, who disclosed the difficulties in caring for people when medicine and adequate nursing help was lacking, on the background of the dilemma of how “to explain to a Pole who speaks little French”, and how difficult it was “to give a course of sulphonamide to a Russian with erysipelas who only speaks Russian\\". The Lack of medical aid, equipment, drugs and hospital facilities meant improvising and making the best out of what was there. Michael Hargrave, in his journal, described the human laundry, assembled in two adjacent stables where 17 tables were each surrounded by four German nurses, who washed the inmates, covered them in DDT and then wrapped them in clean towels before they were transported again. As a student running his hut, he marked whoever he felt appropriate to send there. The Hungarian aid would then porter them into an ambulance to be taken to the human laundry in Camp II. On 14 May 1945, the 35 Casualty Clearing Station arrived and the remaining sick were moved to the German Military Hospital, later renamed the Glyn Hughes Hospital. It grew to accommodate 13 000 patients, and staff including the students, the British Red Cross and German medical staff. The work by the students was significant in reducing the death rate from initially more than 500 a day to fewer than 100 a day by mid-May. On 20 May 1945, Camp 1 was destroyed and the students moved to Camp 2.\\"An anaesthetist at Belsen\\". J. Gareth Jones and Oliver C. Winterbottom, in \\"Brexit: Implications for Anaesthesia and Healthcare\\", Bulletin of the Royal College of Aaesthetists, September 2016. Issue 99. pp.53-55 ===Life outside the camp=== A group of students discuss some of the medical details experienced during the day with E. M. De Greff, British Red Cross Relief Officer and second-in-command of the medical students, at their daily evening conference. They were issued with SS Panzer dot-camouflaged coats by Captain Walter Carton “Frosty” Winterbottom. Some Canadian airmen bought them cigarettes and chocolates. Each student was given twice the usual ration of rum every night. Theatre and cinema was provided for entertainment. Local RAF units gave wine and the Red Cross issued cigarettes to them.Later, a wireless and a dartboard became available. ===Unwell students=== Some students became unwell themselves with seven contracting typhus and two tuberculosis. Bart's student Andrew Dossetor was hospitalised with typhus, as too was John Hancock from The London, who was later cared for by Horace Evans. John Jenkins of Westminster medical school recovered from life-threatening tuberculosis. Westminster's tercentenary publication reports that four students died. however, there is no evidence that any died. ==Return to England== After a month at Belsen the students were relieved by Belgian medical students and returned to England. One of the students, Alex Paton, later described how on 29 May 1945 upon return, he landed at Croydon airport “with feelings that are too complicated to analyse at the moment”. One newspaper reported that year, that 21 cases of typhus were diagnosed in England, seven of which were volunteer medical students returning from Belsen.Hargrave, Michael John (2014). Bergen-Belsen 1945: A Medical Student's Journal. London: Imperial College Press, Photographs. Meiklejohn, who was responsible for administering the \\"starvation mixture\\", paid tribute to them and majors A. P. Prior and E. M. Griffin gave particular thanks to students D. G. A. Westbury and J. A. Turner from Guy's and J. Stephenson from St Thomas'. ==Later reflections== Several students later talked of their experiences at Belsen. On the bulldozing of bodies into mass graves, John Dixey later recounted; > It wasn't as totally horrifying as you might reasonably expect it to be > because it was on such an enormous scale...If it had been several hundred > bodies one might have been desperately upset and affected by it mentally and > psychologically, at any rate. But no it was on such a huge scale it was > rather like trying to count the stars. There were thousands and thousands of > dead bodies and you couldn't really consider them to be your aunt or your > mother or your brother or your father because there was just too many and > they were being bulldozed into graves. D. C. Bradford believed that they were able to cope with the situation, being as young as they were \\"it was I think that we were young and much more flexible and could take it in those days\\". ==Legacy== Major A. P. Prior's papers and photographs of the students are kept in the Wellcome Collection. The Imperial War Museum holds an archive of a number of letters and diaries of the students. Some of their memoirs were used by historian Ben Shephard in his 2005 book After Daybreak: The Liberation of Belsen, 1945. In 2006, St Mary's student, Andrew B. Matthews' story was told in the Holocaust Studies: A Journal of Culture and History. The operation was also portrayed in the 2007 feature-length drama titled The Relief of Belsen in which Alex Paton says \\"in my hut there were no deaths today, sir\\". Michael Hargrave's diary Bergen- Belsen 1945: A Medical Student's Journal was published in 2014. In 2019, the Guy's alumni gave their John Fry lecture based on the students who were sent from Guy's Hospital. ==See also== * List of London medical students who assisted at Belsen == References == ==Further reading== *Student letters in Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps, 1 January 1984, pp. 199–201. *Shephard, Ben.

In September 1970, Khmer Rouge forces together with units of the People’s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 1st Division, had closed this line of communications by occupying the Pich Nil Pass (). Several FANK outposts on Route 4 had been overrun in the process and other posts had been evacuated without resistance. Although the Mekong River supply route was open, Route 4 was very important to the FANK and to the Cambodian Government for all types of supplies, but particularly for military equipment. When the FANK requested help on Route 4, the South Vietnamese Joint General Staff (JGS) assigned the mission to the Commander of IV Corps General Ngô Quang Trưởng. Forces for the operation consisted of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam 4th Armor Brigade and 4th Ranger Group from IV Corps. In addition, the JGS reinforced the operation with the 2nd Marine Brigade. These forces were organized for combat into two task forces. Task Force North consisted of the 2nd Marine Brigade and the 12th Armor Regiment. It moved by vehicle, along Route 1 to Phnom Penh and by Route 4 to Kompong Speu. Task Force South consisted of the 4th Armor Brigade and the 4th Ranger Group. It departed Hà Tiên on Route 16 along the coast and was to continue west to Route 4, then north then northeast to link up with Task Force North as it moved southwest. Air support was the responsibility of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force 4th Air Division at Binh Thuy Air Base, whose assets were supplemented by US air units, reconnaissance, tactical strike aircraft and B-52s. In addition, US fire support and medical evacuation helicopters were positioned at An Thoi Naval Base on Phú Quốc island, from where they were in a better position to support the forces operating in the south. ==Operation== The operation began on 13 January 1971 as the 4th Armor Brigade with the 12th and 16th Armored Cavalry Regiments, three Ranger battalions, an artillery battalion, and an engineer group moved 300 kilometers from Cần Thơ to Hà Tiên in 14 hours. For the next two days the brigade pushed north along Route 4. The first enemy encountered had set up an ambush that the 16th Armored Cavalry Regiment blew away by charging on line. A second ambush further north against the 12th Armored Cavalry also failed. The enemy tried to isolate the lead squadron by destroying the first and last vehicles. The lead commander however, kept his flaming vehicle moving and his machine gun firing. Hit three times and burning, the ACAV continued north for about 150 meters before it blew up killing the crew. This prevented the column from being trapped on the road allowed the cavalry to get out of the enemy firing lines. The Ranger battalion behind the cavalry squadron stopped and opened fire. The ambushers were now in a deadly cross-fire between the cavalry and the Rangers. Two US aerial fire teams sealed off the enemy escape routes. When the smoke cleared 200 of the enemy lay dead and 75 weapons, including 2 75mm recoilless rifles and three heavy machine guns. had been captured. The 12th Armored Cavalry Regiment lost five killed, twenty wounded and three ACAVs destroyed. On 17 January FANK forces with Vietnamese Marine Corps support, fought to the outskirts of the Pich Nil Pass and secured it while the armor brigade secured Route 4 as far north as Route 18. After helping the Cambodians set up strongpoints the 4th Armor Brigade withdrew towards South Vietnam, arriving by 25 January. ==Aftermath== The operation ended on 25 January. PAVN/Khmer Rouge losses were 211 killed while ARVN losses were 16 killed. ==References== Category:Conflicts in 1971 Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War in 1971 ","title":"Operation Cuu Long 44-02"},{"id":"61697345","text":"Saiga (written: 斎賀, 齋賀 or 雑賀) is a Japanese surname.

He devised techniques and instruments to facilitate the surgical excision of the damaged knee meniscus. He was an early advocate of specialist team care in orthopaedics and of early mobilisation. His textbooks Injuries of the knee joint and Diseases of the knee Joint were widely read throughout the world. In 1981 he was elected president of the International Society of the Knee. == Early life == Smillie was born in Dublin to Scottish parents. He was educated at Merchiston Castle School, Edinburgh and at the University of Edinburgh, qualifying MB ChB in 1931. After junior hospital posts in Chester and Grimsby, he became, in 1936, clinical assistant to Mr (later Sir) Walter Mercer who later became the first Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery in Edinburgh. At the start of World War II Smillie was appointed surgeon in charge of the Emergency Medical Service Hospital at Larbert, Stirlingshire. Here he developed specialist team care for patients, with the teams including specialist nurses, physiotherapists and orthotists. In recognition of this wartime service, he was made an OBE in 1946. == Career == Smillie had from an early stage in his career devoted himself to orthopaedic surgery. When the National Health Service (NHS) was established in 1948 he was made surgeon in charge of orthopaedics for the NHS Eastern Scotland area. He was awarded a gold medal by the University of Edinburgh for his ChM thesis. Also in 1948 he went to the United States of America and Canada as a Nufﬁeld Travelling Fellow. He developed the orthopaedic service at Bridge of Earn Hospital and set up orthopaedic clinics at Dundee Royal Infirmary. In both centres he continued to promote and develop the concept of team care in orthopaedics and emphasised the importance of rehabilitation. In 1967 he became the first Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of St Andrews transferring to the University of Dundee when the bulk of the medical school moved there. Smillie was regarded as an excellent technical surgeon and an inspiring teacher. He became an influential authority on knee conditions. His book Injuries of the knee joint, first published in 1946, became widely read throughout the English-speaking world and was to be published in five English language editions and a Spanish edition. Diseases of the knee Joint, first published in 1974 went to three editions and was also published in Spanish. Smillie was an enthusiastic advocate of removal of the injured meniscus and developed instruments and techniques to facilitate this procedure. From the 1980s advances in technology and understanding of the adverse consequences of meniscectomy led to a more conservative approach being adopted. In 1981 Smillie was elected president of the International Society of the Knee. == Leisure pursuits == Smillie had a wide range of leisure pursuits. In the 1930s he took part in car racing at the Brookland's circuit. In later life he bought and farmed an estate in Perthshire. He was an enthusiastic salmon fisherman and his interest in deer stalking led to his writing A Guide to the Stalking of Red Deer in Scotland. == Family == Smillie married Delicia Ash in 1941. They had two daughters. In 1956 he married Janet Bissett. == Legacy == The Ian Smillie award is presented each year by the University of Dundee to the most distinguished student on the Master of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery (ChM Orth) course. The streets Smillie Place, Bridge of Earn and Smillie Court, Dundee are named for him. == Selected publications == *Diseases of the knee Joint *Injuries of the knee joint *A Guide to the Stalking of Red Deer in Scotland == References == Category:1907 births Category:1992 deaths Category:People from Dublin (city) Category:People educated at Merchiston Castle School Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh Category:Scottish surgeons Category:British orthopaedic surgeons Category:20th-century surgeons Category:Academics of the University of St Andrews Category: University of Edinburgh Medical School alumni ","title":"Ian Scott Smillie"},{"id":"61697361","text":"Karahaxhë () is a small village in Vlorë County, southern Albania.

The following specific feature can be seen in the \\"strength vs plasticity\\" diagram: plasticity increases with the increase in strength. Such properties can be explained by the balanced chemical composition with an optimal ratio of three modifying elements: Mo-Ni-Cu (that's why the DITG material is called MONICA) and are assured by the corresponding microstructure which is obtained by the respective heat treatment. == Chemical composition == The chemical composition corresponds to high-strength cast iron with spherical graphite (DI, ADI), but with the total carbon equivalent of about СE = 5.0 … 5.5. For three elements (Mo-Ni-Cu) this equivalent is equal to СE(3) = 0.35…0.45. == Microstructure == Depending on the heat treatment modes, the microstructure characteristic of ADI is obtained; it possesses the following specific feature: under certain conditions molybdenum evolutions are formed. == Mechanical properties == At strength limit σu~1300…1400 MPa the plasticity reaches the values of 3…5 %. Critical coefficient of intensity of stresses is equal to Kc=60…75 MPa\\\\sqrt[2]{m} at σu=1100…1200 MPa. The contact fatigue limit (under the conditions of initial point contact) is pf=3750 MPa based on the tests of 108 cycles. High resistance to fatigue is explained by the fact that modification with molybdenum is more effective than the one with nickel and copper: in order to obtain the steel bending fatigue limit with rotation of σ−1=150 MPa, the amount of nickel shall be approximately 10 times higher than the amount of molybdenum. == Wear resistance == MONICA displays high self-lubrication properties since its microstructure contains graphite, molybdenum and copper. Availability of these elements helps to reduce the coefficient of friction for MONICA to ~50…70 % (as compared to steel) and to decrease the wear to ~30…50 %. == Application == The material is used to manufacture the parts of critical heavily loaded tribo-fatigue systems (see, for example, Figure 1).Rundman, K. B., Moore, D. J., Hayrynen, K. L., Dubensky, W. J., & Rouns, T. N. (1988). The Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Austempered Ductile Iron. J. Heat Treat., 5(2), 79-85.

Designed by George Edmund Street, it was built in 1877–80 and has been a Grade II* listed building since 1976. The walls, gate piers and gates to the church have been Grade II listed since 1994. ==History== St Andrew's was built as a chapel of ease to the parish church of St Michael's. A new church was seen as necessary to serve the lower region of the town, particularly the elderly and sick who struggled to manage the steep journey up to the parish church. Furthermore, additional church accommodation was required to serve the increasing number of residents in Minehead, while the town was also attracting more visitors from its growing reputation as a seaside resort. The need for a new church was recognised by Mrs. Charlotte Ann F. Luttrell, wife of Minehead's vicar (Rev. A. H. F. Luttrell), who had St Andrew's built at her own expense, in memory of her cousin, the late George Jeremy of Leacombe House, Axminster. Mrs. Luttrell spent approximately £4,000-£5,000 on the church, created an endowment of £1,000 and provided £200 towards a repairs fund. A plot of land was gifted by George Fownes Luttrell of Dunster Castle, who also provided the bricks and building stone. The plans for the church were drawn up George Edmund Street of London. The foundation stone was laid by Master Alexander Collingwood Fownes Luttrell, the eldest son of Captain John F. Luttrell of the Royal Navy, on 22 August 1877. The contractor for its construction was Messrs. John Pearse and Son of Minehead, with Mr. C. H. Samson of Dunster as clerk of the works. The completed church was consecrated by the Bishop of Bath and Wells, the Right Rev. Lord Arthur Hervey, on 26 August 1880. ==Architecture== St Andrew's is built of red sandstone sourced from Alcombe quarries, with dressings of Doulting stone, in the Decorated style. It was designed to accommodate 324 persons and is made up of a three-bay nave, north and south aisles, chancel, vestry with organ loft, north porch and a bell-turret. The church's intended tower was never built. The open-timbered roofs of the nave and chancel were carved from pitch pine, as was the seating of the nave and aisles. Oak was used for the screen and ceilings of the vestry and organ loft. The chancel was paved with encaustic tiles supplied by Messrs. William Godwin of Hereford. The church has a five- light east window, and a rose and two two-light windows on the west side. All windows were glazed with white cathedral glass. The pulpit, lectern, reading desk and font cover were made of oak, and the octagonal font of Doulting stone. The corbels, finials and terminals were carved by Harry Hems of Exeter, the seating by Messrs. Baker and Son of Bristol and the ironwork by Mr. Leaver of Maidenhead. The church's two bells were made by Messrs. John Taylor & Co of Loughborough. A harmonium was initially used at the church until it received its organ in 1881, which was presented by H. A. Bosanquet and built by Messrs J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd of London. A memorial was added to an eastern window in 1888 in memory of Mrs. Luttrell who died the previous year. It was designed and executed by Charles Eamer Kempe of London. A lectern of wrought-iron and brass was added to the church in 1903. The church's meeting rooms, kitchen and toilets were all built in 2004. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Churches in Somerset Category:Grade II* listed churches in Somerset Category:Church of England church buildings in Somerset Category:G.

Yoga, consisting mainly of postures (asanas), arrived in Britain early in the 20th century, though the first classes that contained asanas were described as exercise systems for women rather than yoga. Classes called yoga, again mainly for women, began in the 1960s. Yoga grew further with the help of television programmes and the arrival of major brands including Iyengar Yoga and Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga. Before the 20th century, yoga was known only from the reports of travellers to India, which described deceptive vagabonds pretending to be pious. Among the first to publicise yoga in Britain in the early 1900s was the occultist Aleister Crowley, who confused yoga with magic in the public mind. In the 1930s, instructors such as Mary Bagot Stack taught postures similar to several modern asanas to women in Britain between the world wars, but these were not then described as yoga. At the same time, magazines such as Health and Strength ran articles on yoga, without mentioning asanas. In 1948 Sir Paul Dukes presented the BBC's first yoga television programmes to a small audience. Classes called yoga began in the 1960s, becoming popular especially among women. Yogini Sunita attracted a large following in Birmingham from 1960. The British Wheel of Yoga developed from the Birmingham Yoga Club, founded by Wilfred Clark; it provided classes in venues such as church halls, trained teachers, and accredited yoga teacher training programmes. The 1968 visit of the rock music group The Beatles to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in India drove counter- cultural interest in yoga. ITV gained a television audience of 4 million with its 1971 series Yoga for Health. Iyengar Yoga was the first of the major yoga brands to arrive, with classes taught from 1970, initially under the Inner London Education Authority. With the commercialisation of classes from the 1980s, more energetic styles such as Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga became popular, and private studios largely replaced local authority classes. The Sports Council made the British Wheel of Yoga the governing body of yoga in Britain in the 1990s. In the 21st century, yoga became so widespread as to become an \\"unremarkable\\" part of daily life, and many new types of yoga appeared, from aerial yoga to doga (yoga with dogs) and on paddleboards. Yoga in its modern form is being studied academically by the School of Oriental and African Studies. ==History== Ascetics under a banyan tree, from Collections of Travels Through Turky into Persia and the East-Indies by Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, 1688 ===Early travellers=== The yoga scholar Mark Singleton notes that early British travellers who visited India considered yoga practitioners to be unpleasant, vagrants at best and libertines at worst. John Ovington in his A Voyage to Suratt, In the Year, 1689 described them as \\"holy mendicants\\" who had a \\"sordid aspect\\"; he attributed their taking solemn vows to remain in strange postures all their lives as \\"Delusions of Satan\\". Similarly, John Fryer in his 1698 A New Account of East-India and Persia recorded a \\"Jougie\\" who had a gold ring in his \\"Virile Member\\" (his penis) to keep him from sexual activity, and wrote of ascetics who held postures until their limbs withered; he called such people \\"Vagabonds\\" who pretended to be pious. ===Before the Second World War=== Mary Bagot Stack in \\"Seal\\" posture (now Salabhasana, locust pose) in Building the Body Beautiful, the Bagot Stack Stretch-and-Swing System, 1931 Early in the 1900s, the occultist Aleister Crowley travelled to India, devoting himself to Rāja yoga at the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai. He learnt some asanas and studied Patanjali's Yoga Sutras. He claimed to have attained the spiritual state of dhyana, the seventh stage on the path to enlightenment defined by Patanjali. In 1939, Crowley gave a series of lectures on yoga, under the \\"modest\\" pseudonym of Mahatma Guru Sri Paramahansa Shivaji. He helped to link yoga in the mind of the British public with magic, yogis with fakirs, and tantra with \\"Western esoteric sexual practices\\". In the 1930s, the yoga scholar Mark Singleton notes that Health and Strength magazine ran two kinds of article relating to yoga. The first spoke of \\"yoga\\" but without mentioning asanas; the second, which it did not call \\"yoga\\", for women, including postures such as those now called Trikonasana, Paschimottanasana, and Salabhasana. In July 1935, the magazine featured Adonia Wallace demonstrating the \\"Exercises Which Gave Me Fame\\" as \\"The Girl with the Perfect Figure\\", with the poses now called Rajakapotasana, Urdhva Dhanurasana, Natarajasana, and Eka Pada Viparita Dandasana. Similar postures were taught to the Women's League of Health and Beauty in Britain by Mary Bagot Stack in the period between the world wars with the \\"Bagot Stack Stretch-and-Swing System\\". Stack had travelled to India, and had learnt some yoga poses there. ===1945-1980=== The BBC broadcast the first yoga television programmes in 1948 and 1949 to a small audience, presented by the ex-MI6 agent Sir Paul Dukes, who had an interest in spirituality; he had visited Pierre Bernard's Country Club in Nyack, New York which taught hatha yoga. A still shows three women in Shirshasana (tripod headstand) on a circular stage. Yogini Sunita's charisma attracted a large female following in Birmingham in the 1960s. Classes in yoga as exercise started to appear across Britain in the 1960s, and asana sessions became a common option among adult education evening classes. For example, in Birmingham, a local newspaper editor, Wilfred Clark, gave a lecture on yoga to the Workers' Educational Association in 1961, meeting such an enthusiastic response that he proposed yoga classes to the local education authority, and founded in turn the Birmingham Yoga Club, the Midlands Yoga Association, and finally the British Wheel of Yoga in 1965. Yoga groups soon sprang up all over Britain. The yoga researcher Suzanne Newcombe states that yoga in Birmingham was largely inspired by a Brahmin woman from a devout Catholic family in Bombay, born as Bernadette Bocarro. She trained as a Franciscan nun but left the convent and then learnt \\"Pranayama Yoga\\" in Bombay, marrying another Indian Catholic, Roydon Cabral. In 1960 she moved to Birmingham, taught yoga to a few friends, and by 1961 presented herself in a sari as \\"Yogini Sunita\\", exciting curiosity by sitting on the floor. An interviewer described her at that time as \\"wearing a flame-coloured sari, sandals and long silver earrings with her dark hair swept back in a chignon.\\" She was a charismatic teacher, attracting many middle-class women with her calm, relaxed manner, her skill and air of authority when teaching relaxation, and her ability to combine bringing up a family with a busy schedule of teaching and writing. B. K. S. Iyengar with yoga teacher Malcolm Strutt at Iyengar Centre House, London, 1971 Yoga reached London's evening classes in 1967. The Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) stated that classes in \\"Hatha Yoga (sic)\\" should not cover the philosophy of Yoga, favouring \\"Keep Fit\\" classes in asanas and \\"pranayamas (sic)\\" especially for people aged over 40, and expressing concern about the risk of \\"exhibitionism\\" and the lack of suitably qualified teachers. The ILEA's Peter McIntosh watched some classes taught by B. K. S. Iyengar, was impressed by his 1966 book Light on Yoga, and from 1970 ILEA-approved yoga teacher training was run by one of Iyengar's pupils, Silva Mehta. Since the ILEA had insisted that classes should be free of yoga philosophy, Iyengar was careful to encourage students to follow their own religious traditions, rather than trying to follow his own family's Visistadvaita, a qualified non-dualism within Hinduism. The ILEA had considered the British Wheel of Yoga, but, Newcombe suggests, since the Wheel had argued that yoga was not a physical education topic, McIntosh doubted they would be able to provide good quality yoga as ILEA physical education. In 1968, the rock music group The Beatles led counter-cultural interest, travelling to India and practising Transcendental Meditation with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in his ashram at the \\"yoga capital of the world\\", Rishikesh. In Crosby, on Merseyside, Kailash Puri, a Sikh woman from Punjab, taught yoga, pranayama and relaxation in the wave of interest generated by The Beatles; her students Frank and Hazel Wills ran a yoga slot on the BBC lunchtime programme Pebble Mill at One starting in 1973. Yoga classes grew beyond those of local education authorities when ITV screened Yoga for Health from 1971, watched by an audience estimated at 4 million. Richard Hittleman was brought in from the United States for want of a suitable British presenter. The model and ballerina Lyn Marshall was chosen to demonstrate the poses under his instruction, on the grounds that \\"any reasonably fit person\\" could benefit from yoga, even though, as Newcombe remarks, Marshall was, as a trained dancer, hardly average. Marshall went on to publish a series of illustrated guides to yoga, including Wake up to Yoga (1975) and Keep up with Yoga (1976). Newcombe estimates that the number of people, mainly middle-class women, practising yoga in Britain rose from about 5000 in 1967 to 50,000 in 1973 and 100,000 by 1979; most of their teachers were also women. With the rise of feminism and higher education for women, middle-class British women were starting to resent being housewives, and given their relative economic freedom, were ready to experiment with new lifestyles such as yoga. Newcombe speculates that their husbands may have found having their wives attending \\"course on traditionally feminine subjects like flower arranging or cooking ... less threatening and more respectable than employment outside the home.\\" The women saw evening classes as safe, interesting, and a good place to make friends with like-minded people. Further, women in Britain were accustomed to gendered physical education, dating back to Mary Bagot Stack before the Second World War. ===1980s onwards=== Yoga camp, Oxford, 2016 Adult education funding was cut sharply in the 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, and yoga moved from public to private classes. In the 1990s, commercial yoga studios started to appear in city centres. At the same time, yoga was recognised as a valid sporting activity by the UK Sports Council; it recognised the British Wheel of Yoga as yoga's governing body, without giving it powers to enforce yoga teaching standards. A more energetic style, Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga, became popular in the new studios with their audience of young, ambitious and often male practitioners. The style, founded by K. Pattabhi Jois, made yoga into an aerobic exercise with continuous flowing movements, the asanas linked by vinyasa sequences based on Surya Namaskar, the salute to the sun. The first Iyengar Yoga Institute (IYI) outside India was founded in Maida Vale, London, in 1983. The old IYI building was replaced in 1994, and the new one was officially opened by Iyengar in person in 1997. From the start, Iyengar personally assessed the quality of the teaching every year. Alongside the yoga brands, many teachers, for example in England, offer an unbranded \\"hatha yoga\\", often mainly to women, creating their own combinations of poses. These may be in flowing sequences (vinyasas), and new variants of poses are often created. The gender imbalance has sometimes been marked; in Britain in the 1970s, women formed between 70 and 90 per cent of most yoga classes, as well as most of the yoga teachers. This caused yoga to evolve as a female practice, taught by women to women. By 2019, yoga had become \\"massively popular\\" in Britain, to the extent that its practice was altogether \\"unremarkable\\"; some 500,000 people practise it regularly each week, and as many as 3 million have at least tried it. == Forms and purposes == In 1993, the Sports Council gave the British Wheel of Yoga the status of \\"National Governing Body\\" for yoga as a \\"sports activity\\", effectively taking control away from local authorities. The Wheel ran yoga teacher training programmes and accredited the programmes of other organisations. By the 21st century, yoga teaching in Britain had changed from mainly publicly funded (by local education authorities) to mainly private, whether in small local groups, advertised classes in venues such as church halls (often British Wheel of Yoga), organised groups like Iyengar Yoga, Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga and Bikram Yoga, or commercial studios providing many different styles of yoga. A 2019 project bringing yoga into schools has had \\"a profound impact\\" on Norfolk primary school children with special needs such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has recommended that employers should arrange lunchtime yoga classes to help reduce obesity. Yoga in Britain is practised in varied settings and in many hybrid forms, from ashrams to village halls to prisons; with dogs, paddleboards, and aerially; for children and for those with Parkinson's; to awaken Kundalini, and as Christian \\"PraiseMoves\\". A hotel in the Lake District offers yoga with ring-tailed lemurs. ==Research== James Mallinson and colleagues at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London including Mark Singleton and Jason Birch introduce the 2015-2020 Hatha Yoga Project. Britain has pioneered the academic study of yoga: the School of Oriental and African Studies in London has created a Centre of Yoga Studies, and hosts the Hatha Yoga Project which is tracing the history of physical yoga. The School teaches a master's degree in yoga and meditation. Its researchers include scholar practitioners such as Singleton and James Mallinson who do yoga themselves, and Suzanne Newcombe, who has specifically investigated yoga in Britain in its period of rapid growth and acceptance from 1960 to 1980, as documented in her book Yoga in Britain: Stretching Spirituality and Educating Yogis. ==See also== * Yoga in Germany * Yoga in the United States * Yoga in Russia ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== : : : : : : : : : : : : : Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Yoga by country ","title":"Yoga in Britain"},{"id":"61697500","text":"László Szabados may refer to: * László Szabados (1911–1997), a Hungarian swimmer * László Szabados (astronomer) (born 1948), a Hungarian astronomer == See also == * Asteroid 265490 Szabados, named after the astronomer ","title":"László Szabados (disambiguation)"},{"id":"61697507","text":"The Shihezi Economic and Technological Development Zone () is an economic and technical development zone at national level located in the eastern suburbs of Shihezi City, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China.

The Special Task Force was headed by Major General Cecil Waidyaratne, Army Chief of Staff with Brigadier Lakshman Algama serving as his deputy and established its headquarters at Havelock Town. The Special Task Force carried out intelligence gathering and direct action operations against the JVP, targeting its leadership. It was successful in tracking down and eliminating much of the JVP leadership which culminated with the capture and death of its leader Rohana Wijeweera on 12 November 1989. On December 27, 1989, a special police team, led by SSP Lionel Gunathilake, arrested Saman Piyasiri Fernando along with his mother and fiance; who was a sister of JVP politburo member Daya Wanniarachchi, at Koswatte, Nawala, at a rented house owned by Mark Antony Fernando, who works at SLBC. According to the police sources, the number of military books found inside the house and some of them are not found in Sri Lankan military libraries. Lalilth Wijeyrathna, Upali Jayaweera, Ranjitham Gunaratnam, Gamini Wijegunasekara and Shantha Bandara tried to regroup. However, the government forces managed to capture them and subsequently killed them on December 1989. The leadership of the JVP was transferred to Lalith Wijerathna. It is believed that Wijerathna was captured in Colombo by a special police team from Kandy either late December 1989 or early January 1990. At a later date in January he was allegedly executed by his captors in Kandy in the last days of the operation Combine. ==End of the operation== The Sri Lankan government media released on December 29, 1989, as \\"the leader of the JVP military wing killed along with four other cadres due to the cross fire between security forces and the JVP at their military wing headquarters, a farm located at Hedigama- Suwarapola, Piliyandala\\".

Her seventh novel, it revolves around Makepeace Felmotte, a girl with the inherited ability to see and absorb ghosts. It is set during the First English Civil War, and in particular the Siege of Oxford. The book was received positively by critics and was short- listed for the Waterstones Book of the Year 2017. == Synopsis == During the First English Civil War, Makepeace lives with her mother in a Puritan village close to London. When her mother dies in a riot between the Parliamentarians and the Royalists, she is sent to live with her deceased father's relatives in Grizehayes, a fictional fortress in the north of England. Makepeace has the inherited trait that allows her to store the spirits of recently deceased people or animals inside herself, like the rest of her father's family. The elders at Grizehayes store the spirits of their notable deceased family members inside living vessels. Discovering that her relatives keep her alive purely as a spare vessel for the spirits, she flees to Oxford and becomes entangled in the conflict of the war herself. == Reception == A Skinful of Shadows received positive reviews from critics. The Guardian writes: \\"...a wonderful, resonant narrative whose subtlety and insight will challenge, entertain and enchant.\\" Strange Horizons writes \\"...to the question, “does Hardinge manage the notorious and eventful historical context in a way that avoids outrageous distortion while still primarily serving the needs of her plot?”—yes. To the question, “does she, as in previous works (viz. The Lie Tree, 2015) continue to depict her main female and male characters as prickly, intelligent, and realistically fallible; their friendship valuable for its ability to deepen through repair, rather than its shot-proof and foreordained perfection?”—indeed.\\" Crime Review writes \\"Hardinge’s writing is lyrical and insightful, and the book wears it research lightly whilst skilfully weaving the sights, sounds and smells of the English Civil War into its very fabric.\\" == References == Category:2017 fantasy novels Category:Paranormal novels Category:British fantasy novels Category:2017 British novels ","title":"A Skinful of Shadows"},{"id":"61697743","text":"Ashkadar () is a rural locality (a village) in Otradovsky Selsoviet, Sterlitamaksky District, Bashkortostan, Russia.

The 20th Tank Regiment was organized on 31 July 1971 and soon saw extensive combat during the 1972 Easter Offensive. ==History== In mid 1971 I Corps, a critical area bordered by North Vietnam and Laos, was protected by ARVN infantry, three ARVN armored cavalry squadrons, and the US 1st Brigade, 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized), scheduled to leave the country in August. Analysis of terrain, the probable People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) threat, and PAVN armored actions during Operation Lam Son 719 made it clear that armored units would continue to be needed in this area. Consequently, the South Vietnamese Joint General Staff (JGS) authorized on 31 July 1971 the formation of the 20th Tank Regiment. Equipped with M48A3 tanks, it was the first South Vietnamese tank regiment. Tailored specifically to fit the needs and capabilities of the ARVN, the 20th Tank Regiment had an unusual organization. During Lam Son 719, armored vehicles had proven vulnerable to individual antitank weapons when not protected by infantry. The JGS had therefore directed an addition to the regiment, a 270-man armored rifle company. Ninety riflemen were assigned to each tank squadron and were to ride on the outside of the tanks, providing local security. Other changes in the tank regiment's organization and equipment included the addition of tracked M548 ammunition and fuel cargo vehicles, elimination of the regimental scout platoon, for which a five-vehicle security section was substituted, and elimination of the armored vehicle-launched bridge section and all infrared fire control equipment. Later six xenon searchlights per squadron were authorized after advisers questioned the wisdom of limiting $15 million worth of fighting equipment to daytime use by refusing to spend $300,000 on searchlights. Unfortunately, the decision to dispense with the vehicle- launched bridge section was not reconsidered, and lack of bridging during the PAVN offensive proved a major factor in the loss of tanks. Training for the 20th Regiment began at Ái Tử Combat Base near Quảng Trị, but proceeded slowly because of many problems, particularly in maintenance. About 60 percent of the tanks received by the regiment had serious deficiencies beyond the repair capability of the tank crews. Repair parts and technical manuals were missing and the language barrier prevented US instructors from communicating adequately with the Vietnamese crewmen. On 1 November a gunnery program based on US tank standards got under way. Unfortunately, the inexperienced tank crews had difficulty in comprehending the integrated functioning of the Rangefinder and ballistic computer. Partly because of their experience with the M41 tank, which had no rangefinder, Vietnamese commanders at first could not be convinced of the rangefinder's value. Rapid troop turnover and manpower shortages also adversely affected crew performance. Training therefore made slow headway, with many reversions to basic lessons. By 25 January 1972 gunnery training ended, with 41 of 51 available crews qualifying, using test criteria as rigorous as those used for US units. Unit tactical training began in the foothills west of Quang Tri on 1 February and was judged successful in its later stages. A recurring problem during tactical testing was the Vietnamese inclination to disregard maintenance before, during, and after an operation. Continued emphasis on maintenance resulted in some improvement, but standards remained below acceptable levels, even after the unit completed its training. The regiment's final tactical test, a field training exercise, was to be conducted by the South Vietnamese Armor Command along US lines, with the proviso that any portion not completed correctly was to be repeated. Several problems delayed the exercise past its scheduled starting date of 13 March 1972. Poor weather during the gunnery phase, the necessity for some tactical retraining at the troop level, and the lack of M88 Recovery Vehicles and M548 tracked cargo vehicles to carry fuel combined to cause setbacks. Finally, after devoting several days to vehicle maintenance, the regiment began its training test on 27 March. ===Easter Offensive=== In the early morning hours of 30 March 1972, devastating PAVN rocket, mortar and artillery fire fell on every ARVN fire support base in Quảng Trị Province. The bombardment continued all day, and late in the day the northernmost bases reported PAVN tanks and infantry moving south across the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The artillery offensive was followed by infantry and armor attacks in the east across the Ben Hai River following the axis of Route 1 in the west toward the district capital of Cam Lộ and Camp Carroll. Elements of the PAVN 304th and 308th Divisions, three separate infantry regiments of the B5 Front, two tank regiments, and at least one sapper battalion were later identified among the attacking forces. Initially then, the PAVN concentrated a numerical advantage of more than three to one over the defending ARVN 3rd Division and attacked forces which were disposed to counter the infiltration and raid tactics heretofore employed by the PAVN in the DMZ area. The tactical situation on 30 March was confused; the 3rd Division received vague and conflicting reports from fire bases at an astonishing rate. Just before noon the 20th Tank Regiment received a frantic message from Headquarters, I Corps, ordering it to return to Quảng Trị. Since no explanation was given, Major General Nguyen Van Toan, Chief of Armor, and his American adviser, Colonel Raymond R. Battreall, Jr., flew to Quảng Trị to see General Vu Van Giai, the 3rd Division commander. There they learned that the western fire bases near the DMZ had been overrun in a preclude to what was apparently a major PAVN offensive. Since the main attack had not yet been identified, and since no one was sure where the tank regiment would be of the most value, General Toan persuaded General Giai not to commit the 20th Regiment prematurely but to hold it as a division reserve or for use as a counterattack force. He also convinced General Giai that he should permit the unit to stand down for maintenance before its commitment. With that determined, the regiment, then conducting its final coordinated assault phase of the training exercise, completed the assault, did a right flank on the objective (out of line formation and into a column), and, without stopping, returned to Ái Tử Combat Base. By early morning of 1 April most of the outlying firebases along the DMZ and in western Quảng Tri Province had been evacuated or overrun, leaving no friendly positions north of the Mieu Giang and Cua Viet rivers. Poor weather prevented air support and contributed to the relative ease with which the PAVN pushed back the South Vietnamese. The PAVN forces advanced south with impunity. By late afternoon on 1 April Mai Loc Camp and Camp Carroll, south of the Mieu Giang River, were under heavy attack. Frantically redeploying the three infantry regiments, one cavalry regiment, and two Vietnamese Marine brigades at his disposal, General Giai established a defensive line along the south bank of the Mieu Giang. In an effort to stabilize the situation, he committed the 20th Tank Regiment on the morning of 1 April with the mission of relieving the embattled 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and attached infantry units then fighting around Cam Lo, along Route 9. After joining a South Vietnamese Marine battalion, the tank regiment moved north from Ái Tử along Highway 1 towards Đông Hà. Poor traffic control and refugees congesting the route forced the regiment to move cross-country to the southwest of Đông Hà, and in so doing it surprised and routed a PAVN ambush along Route 9. Prisoners taken during this action were dismounted members of a PAVN tank unit whose mission was to seize and man South Vietnamese armored vehicles expected to be captured in the offensive. With its 44 operational tanks, the regiment moved on toward Cam Lo, which was burning. As darkness approached, the unit set up a defensive position southeast of Cam Lo Village, withstanding PAVN probes throughout the night. At daybreak on 2 April, the regiment received reports that a large PAVN tank column was moving south across the Bến Hải River toward the bridge at Đông Hà. About 09:00 the commander, Colonel Nguyen Huu Ly, received permission to move to Đông Hà, then north across the bridge to engage the PAVN forces. When he reached the town he found PAVN infantry already occupying positions on the north bank of the Mieu Giang River that prevented his crossing the bridge. He deployed the regiment around the town of Đông Hà, with the 1st Squadron in a blocking position on the high ground about 3 km to the west, the 2nd Squadron to the south, and the 3rd Squadron defending positions within the town to prevent PAVN elements from crossing the bridge. About noon men of the 1st Squadron, from their vantage point on the high ground to the west, suddenly observed a PAVN tank and infantry column moving south along Highway 1 toward Đông Hà. Moving their tanks into concealed positions, they waited as the PAVN tanks moved closer. At a range of 2,500 to 3,000 meters, the South Vietnamese tankers opened fire, quickly destroying nine PT-76 tanks and two T-54 tanks. The PAVN unit, which by its column formation showed that it was not expecting an attack, was thrown into confusion. Unable to see their adversaries, the North Vietnamese crewmen maneuvered their tanks wildly as the South Vietnamese tank gunners destroyed them one by one. The accompanying infantry dispersed, and the surviving T-54 tanks turned and headed north without firing a single shot. The ARVN regimental headquarters, monitoring the North Vietnamese radio net at that time, heard the PAVN commander express surprised disbelief at losing his tanks to cannon he could not see. The steady deterioration of the tactical situation around Đông Hà was arrested by the arrival of the 1st Armor Brigade headquarters. Although the brigade headquarters had been in the area solely to monitor the 20th Tank Regiment's training exercise, it was a well-trained organization, possessing the armored vehicles and radios needed by General Giai to establish control of the scattered forces and direct the defense he hoped to establish at Đông Hà. General Toan had urged its employment, and on the afternoon of 2 April the brigade, under 3rd Division control, assumed command of all armored, infantry, and Marine forces in the Đông Hà area. Its units included the regiment, two squadrons of the 17th Armored Cavalry Regiment, the 2nd and 57th Regiments of the 3rd Division, the 3rd Battalion of the 258th Marine Corps Brigade, and the survivors of the 56th Regiment from Camp Carroll. The bridge spanning the Mieu Giang River at Đông Hà afforded the PAVN the opportunity to cross the river unimpeded and then drive straight south to Quang Tri City. Before the armor brigade headquarters arrived, the 3rd Division engineers had made two unsuccessful attempts to destroy the bridge with explosive charges. When Colonel Nguyen Trong Luat, the 1st Armor Brigade commander, arrived he decided to leave the bridge intact for the time being, since the PAVN had been stopped and the armor brigade forces were holding. Colonel Luat was preparing to make a counterattack to the north across the bridge when the bridge charges detonated and dropped the near span, putting an end to any counterattack plans. Type 59 tank captured by the regiment on 9 April 1972 Other PAVN forces continued to move south towards Đông Hà on the afternoon of 2 April, engaged first by limited tactical air strikes and then by artillery, mortar and tank fire. A large search and rescue effort had been launched for the crew of a US aircraft downed near Cam Lo. The U.S. Air Force temporary no-fire zone was 27 km in diameter, encompassing nearly the entire combat area and South Vietnamese defenders were unable for several hours to call for artillery support or tactical air strikes against the onrushing PAVN. The PAVN therefore had an opportunity to advance artillery, tanks, and infantry until 22:00, when the restriction was lifted. During the next several days, PAVN activity was relatively light, with sporadic attacks by fire and numerous small ground actions. The PAVN artillery fire was extremely accurate, and although South Vietnamese units moved frequently to avoid the shelling the PAVN seemed to be able to locate new positions very quickly. Although South Vietnamese units conducted attacks to eliminate pockets of resistance south of the Mieu Giang River, the pressure from the north remained intense. The next tank combat occurred on the 9th when all three squadrons of the 20th Tank Regiment fought PAVN armor. The 1st Squadron, shifted several kilometers west of Đông Hà six days earlier, occupied high ground overlooking an important road junction along Route 9. The tankers engaged an infantry unit supported by 10 tanks at ranges up to 2,800 meters. A few answering shots fell short, and the PAVN tanks scattered, several bogging down in the rice paddies near the road. Eventually 8 were destroyed. In all, the regiment destroyed 16 T-54 tanks and captured one Type 59 tank that day, in turn suffering nothing more than superficial damage to several M48's. For the next two weeks the South Vietnamese carried out clearing operations interrupted by frequent engagements with PAVN armor and infantry which normally withdrew in the late afternoon. Nights were punctuated by artillery, mortar, and rocket attacks on South Vietnamese positions throughout the area. The defensive lines established on 2 April continued to hold, and on 11 April the 1st Armor Brigade was augmented by the arrival of the 18th Armored Cavalry Regiment from III Corps. By 14 April the 3rd Division controlled five regimental size South Vietnamese task forces, including units of the 4th, 11th, 17th and 18th Cavalry Regiments and the 20th Tank Regiment. On 23 April, several kilometers west of Dong Ha, the 2nd Squadron, 20th Tank Regiment was attacked by an infantry-tank force using a new weapon, the Soviet AT-3 ‘’Sagger’’ wire-guided missile, destroying an M48A3 tank and an armored cavalry assault vehicle (ACAV). A second ACAV was damaged. At first the ARVN tankers seemed fascinated by the missile's slow and erratic flight. Through trial and error, however, the troops soon learned to engage the launch site of the AT-3 with tank main gun fire and to move their vehicles in evasive maneuvers. On 27 April heralded by massive artillery attacks with 122mm rockets and 130mm guns, a new PAVN offensive began against South Vietnamese positions all along the Mieu Giang-Cua Viet River defense line. The barrage was quickly followed by violent attacks by PAVN infantry and armor, met by equally determined resistance on the part of the South Vietnamese defenders. The 3rd Squadron, 20th Regiment, supporting the 5th Ranger Group, received the brunt of the attack and was soon heavily engaged. By midmorning all officers of the 3rd Squadron had been killed or wounded, and 3 M48A3 tanks had been destroyed by AT-3 missiles. All along the defensive line, units were being overrun or pushed back. Forced to yield ground, Ranger and tank elements gradually withdrew to the southeast. Although losses were heavy on both sides, the numerically superior PAVN continued their drive, and by nightfall had pushed almost 4 km south of Đông Hà. In the early morning of 28 April, the regiment had 18 operational M48A3 tanks. During the South Vietnamese withdrawal the accurate gunnery of the 3rd Squadron cost the PAVN 5 T-54 tanks. At that point the South Vietnamese found large PAVN forces to their rear and for the armored units the withdrawal became an attack to the south. The 2nd Squadron attacking south to secure the bridge over the Vinh Phuoc River at midmorning on the 28th, was badly battered in a PAVN ambush. The commander lost control of his unit and the surviving vehicles, after crossing the bridge, continued to the south in disarray. It was then obvious to Colonel Luat that 1st Armored Brigade units were threatened with encirclement, so the entire force began moving south. All along the way fighting was heavy for the next two days. The terrain as well as the PAVN took its toll of vehicles. At the Vinh Phuoc River 7 vehicles were stranded on the north shore when the bridge, struck by PAVN artillery fire, collapsed. Farther south at the Thạch Hãn River near Quảng Tri, the bridges were already destroyed. 2 tanks were lost there in fording the river on the 30th. By then the tank and cavalry units were beginning their fifth day of almost constant fighting. South of Quảng Tri resupply of fuel and ammunition was nonexistent as the armored force continued its attack. Forced from the highway by the PAVN, the tanks and assault vehicles moved cross-country, falling victim to the many rice paddies, canal crossings, and streams as well as the antitank rockets and artillery. On the first day of May the vehicles began to run out of gas. Finally, on 2 May, having fought their way through the last PAVN units, the battered survivors of the armor command, intermingled with the remnants of other army units, reached Camp Evans at midafternoon. Only armored cavalry assault vehicles were left; the cavalry regiments and the tank regiment had lost all their tanks. The regiment was reduced to a demoralized, dismounted, and defeated unit. Employed primarily in a static, defensive role in frontline areas, the unit had steadily lost men and equipment without receiving replacements. Although vastly outnumbered, cavalry, infantry, tank, and Marine units of the 1st Armor Brigade, as well as tenacious Regional Forces and Popular Forces to the east, had succeeded in slowing the momentum of the massive North Vietnamese invasion. With assistance from US and Vietnamese tactical air forces, they provided the resistance that delayed the PAVN until enough reinforcements could be brought up to halt the offensive. ==References== Category:Military units and formations of South Vietnam Category:Tank units and formations ","title":"20th Tank Regiment (South Vietnam)"},{"id":"61697908","text":"Arun Singh may refer to: *Arun Singh (cricketer) (born 1975), Indian cricketer *Arun Singh (politician, born 1944), Indian politician and union minister of state for defence in the Government of India *Arun Singh (politician, born 1965), National General Secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party of India from 2015 *Arun Kumar Singh, Indian Ambassador to the United States (2015–2016) ","title":"Arun Singh"},{"id":"61697913","text":"Vasilyevka () is a rural locality (a selo) in Naumovsky Selsoviet, Sterlitamaksky District, Bashkortostan, Russia.

It was released on 16 March 2018 through Spinefarm Records/Search And Destroy Records and it was produced by Adrian Bushby. It was featured on Kerrang! as Album Of The Week. == Background and recording == Most of the record was inspired by one of Mark Holley's trips to Iceland. The lead singer explained: “My mental health was so bad the first time I went to Iceland, but I was starting to see progress every time I went. It was a big step for me to go to a place that is barren, with no-one there and insane weather conditions, and do it all by myself. It felt like there was a mutual relationship between me and that place because I overcame a lot out there. I wrote plenty of music when I went to Iceland the second time, and our new record reflects that.” The band recorded Reiði at VADA studios in Warwickshire, England, with producer Adrian Bushby. == Musical style and lyrics == The album revolves around the opposing concepts of light and dark: \\"reiði\\" is the Icelandic word for \\"rage\\", and it's pronounced \\"ray-dee\\"; instead, \\"sæla\\" means \\"happiness\\". Ideally, Reiði is divided in two parts, with a light and ethereal first half, and the second part venturing into darker territories. The lyrics shift from Holley's constant fight with anxiety and health issues, as he reveals: “The thirst for adventure is an overall theme of the album, but more than that, it’s an obvious journey from start to finish about myself. I sing a lot about rage on this album, and the final words sung on the record are ‘now I understand rage’. That’s what’s pulling it all together – you’re going through this journey of working things out with the writer.\\" The band experiments with different melodies and riffs, making Reiði a sonically ambitious record that embraces pop and shoegaze influences. Talking about \\"Sæla\\", Holley revealed: \\"It is about a desire to leave a place that was starting to feel stagnant, I think it’s Foxxes at our poppiest but it’s still got all the undertones of darkness stacked amongst it. I remember watching the film ‘Hunt For The Wilderpeople’ before we headed out to Europe for a show and fell in love with that phrase (and the film) and jotted some lyrics down on the trip that were inspired by it.” \\"Float On\\" was written by Holley in memory of his cousin who drowned in a river. == Release and promotion == On 6 December 2017, Black Foxxes released a first single, \\"Sæla\\", and a corresponding video. On 5 February 2018, they released the single \\"Manic In Me\\", along with a music video shot in Iceland. On 5 March 2018, they revealed a third single, \\"JOY\\", and a video directed by Josh Street and Sam Brown; Holley's dog Tarka appears in it. From 16 March to 22 March, the band did a promotional run in various HMV stores across the UK to perform a short acoustic set, meet fans and sign copies of the new record. On 21 September 2018, they released an acoustic version of \\"Oh, It Had To Be You\\". == Critical reception == Reiði has been critically acclaimed and defined as \\"exceptional and thought provoking\\", \\"nothing short of sublime\\", containing \\"more shiver- inducing, goosebump-raising thrills than most bands manage in an entire career\\". In particular, critics appreciated how Black Foxxes distanced themselves from the raw and dark atmospheres of I'm Not Well, leaving the door open for light and a sense of hope, evoking tenderness and beginning to heal. The sound of Reiði has been compared to bands like Alice In Chains, The Xcerts and Manchester Orchestra. == Track listing == == Personnel == * Mark Holley - vocals, guitar * Tristan Jane - bass guitar * Anthony (Ant) Thornton - drums == References == Category:2018 albums Category:Black Foxxes albums ","title":"Reiði"},{"id":"61697967","text":"Following are the results of the 1957 Soviet First League football championship.

It was established by the Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore. ==Overview== The Statesman writes, “Like the fine arts, music was an important part of the curriculum taught at Tagore’s school. For the Santiniketan community, his songs were a constant source of joy and solace. They were integral to each aspect of Santiniketan’s unique way of life and cultural identity. Not surprisingly, the teaching of music and dance received a fresh impetus when Visva-Bharati was founded. A new musical tradition evolved under the guidance of stalwarts like Dinendranath Tagore, Rabindranath’s musician grandnephew, and Pandit Bhimrao Hasurkar Sastri, a versatile Maharashtrian musician who taught Hindustani classical music. “Simultaneously, a new style of dance was created through experimentation with styles borrowed from various traditions and cultures. Traditional Manipuri and Kathakali styles and also non-Indian dance forms such as the Ceylonese Kandy dance were incorporated into this new dance style that had an identity of its own. Such syncretism was a hallmark of Visva- Bharati’s distinctive cultural outlook. “Santiniketan revolutionized Bengali and, by extension, Indian perceptions of culture by challenging social prejudices against the performing arts. The students broke a taboo when they began to participate in performances on the public stage. In short, in Santiniketan the performing arts gained a new respectability.” ==History== Rabindranath's school, Brahmacharyasrama, at Santiniketan, was formally opened on 22 December 1901. Music was an important part of the curriculum right from the beginning, but the music taught was limited to Rabindra Sangit. In 1919, when Kala Bhavana first started functioning, it taught both music and art. In 1933, the two streams were separated with individual institutes for each stream - Kala Bhavana and Sangit Bhavana. Dinendranath Tagore, grandson of Dwijendranath Tagore, the poet’s eldest brother, was brought up in the culturally rich environment of Jorasanko Thakur Bari and was a talented musician familiar with both Hindustani classical music and music in western culture. He was particularly good with musical notations and was in-charge of the music department from the earliest years. Bhimrao Hasurkar Sastri introduced the teaching of Hindustani classical music in Santiniketan. He was the second adhakshya of the music department from 1923 to 1927. Thereafter, Dinendra Nath Tagore once again took over charge. Bhatkhande Music Institute set up by renowned musicologist and pioneer in classical music training, Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande, in Lucknow, provided well-trained Hindusthani classical music acharyas to Visva Bharati for many years. The association of music with the courtesans in those days somewhat damaged its reputation as an art form, and Rabindranath’s experiments with the art of dance at Santiniketan were initially received with opposition and criticism from the then existing orthodox society. In 1919, Rabindranath decided to include Manipuri dance in the curriculum of Santiniketan after witnessing a dance performance in Sylhet. He requested Birendra Kishore Manikya, the king of Tripura, to send a Manipuri dance teacher and the latter sent Rajkumar Buddhimanta Singh to Santiniketan. Later, Nileswar Mukherjee of Bhanugach also joined Santiniketan as a teacher of Manipuri dance. Rabindranath Tagore was attracted to Kathakali mainly as a result of its rhythmic dance components like kalasam and sari, with only a vaneer of gestural abhinaya. He sent Santideb Ghosh, twice to South India to get in touch with Kerala Kalamandalam. In 1939 Poet Vallathol visited Santiniketan. Rabindranath requested him to send a Kathakali teacher to Santiniketan. Santideb Ghosh again visited Kerala for the purpose. Guru Kelu Nair was the first Kathakali teacher at Santiniketan from 1937 to 1941. Subsequently, Haridasan Nair, Balakrishnan Menon, Keshava Poduval, Unni Krishna Kuruppu and Mohan Krishnan Poduval were some of the eminent teachers at Santiniketan for Kathakali dance. In later years, Kalamandalam Govindan Kutty was associated with both Kolkata and Santiniketan. ==The institute overview== Eminent names in the musical arena such as Dinendranath Tagore, Bhimrao Hasurkar Sastri, Indira Devi Chaudhurani, Santidev Ghosh, Sushil Kumar Bhanja Choudhuri and Sailajaranjan Majumdar laid down rich traditions in earlier years. In later years the traditions were upheld by such persons as Kanika Banerjee and Nilima Sen. In addition to those who studied at Santineiketan and remained back as notable teachers, some of the students who have emerged as popular singers, beyond Santiniketan, are: Suchitra Mitra, Subinoy Roy, Sumitra Guha and Rezwana Chowdhury Bannya. Sangit Bhavana “focuses on the realms of music and dance. The courses vary from PG to undergraduate study and from diplomas to certificate courses. Almost all forms and styles of Indian music and dance are dealt with under one roof.” Sangit Bhavana imparts training in Rabindra Sangit, Hindusthani classical vocal and instrumental music (esraj, sitar, tabla, pakhvaj), Manipuri and Kathakali dance styles, dramas and Tagore’s own musical dance-dramas. For exceptionally talented post-graduates, there is scope for research. ==In popular culture and in history== *Mrinalini Sarabhai (then Mrinalini Swaminathan, 20 years old), studied Kathakali under Guru Kelu Nair and Manipuri under Guru Ambui Singh. An extremely creative person she was always on the look out for new forms in traditional techniques to express herself. When Tagore gave her the leading role in his dance drama Chandalika she was thrilled, more so because she had to do the Bharatnatyam choreography by her-self. ‘Dance it as you wish,’ Tagore said. It was the first time that Bharatnatyam was introduced in Tagore’s dance drama. *The Kandyan dance of Ceylon and the dance-dramas of Java and Bali represented the 'Asian mind' for Tagore. The hybrid form of Tagore’s dance drama developed over time. Pratima Devi called it a product of ‘chemical synthesis’ of several traditional Asian dance forms and modern European dance. Kathakali and Manipuri formed the base and there were additives from the modern European styles of Rudolf Laban, Kurt Jooss and Mary Wigman. Tagore’s niece Shrimati Tagore brought in many of these to Santiniketan after training in Europe for three years. A Japanese dancer named Maki had choroegraphed Chitrangada *Tagore’s music was a blend of different genres and many of his compositions were sung in Western classical mode also. Two Ashramites, Allen Danielu and Arthur Gedes, presented Tagore’s lyrics in English, set to his tunes, and rendered in western style with piano as accompaniment. *Manoj and Manisha Murali Nair, a brother and sister duo, have produced 10 Rabindra Sangit albums till now. They are children of Kalamandalam Murlidharan Nair, the Kathakali guru at Visva Bharati. *Rabindranath’s timeless song Purano shei diner katha has its roots in Scotland. It was inspired by Auld Lang Syne (Long long ago) by the Scottish poet and lyricist Robert Burns. Several other Tagore songs have a similar history. In 2011, the Scottish government set up a Centre for Tagore Studies at Napier University in Edinburgh. In January 2019, Visva Bharati organised a special programme on Rabindranath and Robert Burns. :See also - Special programme on Rabindranath Tagore and Scottish poet Robert Burns *Pallavi Krishnan, leading Mohiniyattam exponent completed her graduation in dance (Kathakali) from Santiniketan and then did her post graduation in Mohiniyattam from Kerala Kalamandalam. ==See also== *Notable people associated with Santiniketan ==References== ==External links== Category:Music schools in India Category:Dance schools in India Category:Dance education in India Category:Performing arts education in India Category:Visva-Bharati University Category:Educational institutions established in 1933 Category:Education in West Bengal Category:Rabindranath Tagore ","title":"Sangit Bhavana"},{"id":"61698046","text":"Following are the results of the 1958 Soviet First League football championship.

He joined Lobby Loyde's Southern Electric group and was recorded on two of their albums, Obsecration (May 1976) and Live with Dubs (live album, 1980). According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, Mándu had \\"a distinctive and emotional voice\\" and his solo album, \\"stands as a worthwhile period piece, a work graced with elegant songs, soaring arrangements and fine musicianship.\\" However, in 1980 \\"[he] disappeared from view, re-emerging briefly during the mid-1980s with a band called Mándu Bándu.\\" == Biography == Mándu (Chris Moraitis) arrived in Melbourne from Queensland in the early 1970s. Note: For additional work user may have to select 'Search again' and then 'Enter a title:' &/or 'Performer:' He issued a concept album, To the Shores of His Heaven, in 1974 using studio musicians: Steve Cooney on mandolin and guitar, Phil Manning on guitar, Barry Sullivan on bass guitar, Peter Sullivan on keyboards and Gary Young on drums. It was recorded at Melbourne's Armstrong Studios and produced by Ern Rose for Image Records/Astor Records. Ian McFarlane, an Australian musicologist, felt that, \\"the cosmic concept album... stands as a worthwhile period piece, a work graced with elegant songs, soaring arrangements and fine musicianship.\\" Mándu toured Australia with a backing band of Cooney, Peter Sullivan, Bob Bickerton on drums (ex-Rock Granite and the Profiles), Mike Clarke on bass guitar (ex-Skylight) and Greg Cook on guitar (ex-Cam-Pact, the Mixtures, Skylight). The album was retitled, We Ran Across the Sky, and reissued in 1980. A bonus track, \\"Gimme Shelter\\", a cover version of the Rolling Stone's single was added to a remastered and reissued version, To the Shores of His Heaven, in February 2008 via Aztec Music. Mándu joined Australian rock guitarist, Lobby Loyde's group Southern Electric, and was recorded on their album, Obsecration (May 1976). He left for the United Kingdom and returned to Melbourne to record that group's live album, Live with Dubs (1980). McFarlane noticed that subsequently, \\"[he] disappeared from view, re-emerging briefly during the mid-1980s with a band called Mándu Bándu.\\" He observed that the artist, \\"was something of an enigma and a sadly overlooked talent.

S. Saravanan, who had worked with various directors including Kothanda Ramaiah and Vikraman, made his directorial debut with Don Chera under the banner of Sivasankaralaya.

Sivamanoharan took in charge of cinematography while newcomer Prince G. who worked with Harris Jayaraj as his keyboard player had taken care of the music and editing was done by R. T. Annadurai. Speaking about the film, the director said, \\"It is a movie certainly different from other films on gangsters. Not just the story and the script, but the making itself would be totally different from other films. The whole cast and crew have given their best\\". ==Soundtrack== The film score and the soundtrack were composed by film composer Prince G.. The soundtrack features 5 tracks. ==Release== Initially, the film had its release date fixed on 26 May 2006, but it was postponed to 2 June 2006 to avoid a clash with Selvaraghavan's gangster film Pudhupettai (2006). Balaji Balasubramaniam of bbthots.com called it a \\"weak remake of Sanjay Dutt's Vaastav\\" and wrote, \\"Ranjith overacts almost throughout [..] Susi Bala is introduced pretty late but is adequate in the few scenes where she is required to emote. Ilavarasu plays a villain for a change and manages to utter a few comments in his trademark style without letting his character lose its evil nature\\". Indiaglitz said, \\"From start to finish, this gangster movie has ripped off some scene from every other gangster movie. So there is little novelty ore novelty. The director's other major failing, it would seem, is in not wresting compelling performances from his cast. Leading with Ranjith, everyone hams outrageously and the film is left adrift for lack of feel\\". Another reviewer praised Ranjith's acting and gave the film a mixed review. ==References== Category:2006 films Category:Indian films Category:Tamil-language films Category:2000s Tamil-language films Category:Films set in Chennai Category:Films shot in Chennai Category:Films about organised crime in India Category:Indian gangster films Category:Indian crime action films Category:Indian crime drama films Category:Films featuring an item number Category:2006 directorial debut films Category:2000s crime action films Category:2006 crime drama films ","title":"Don Chera"},{"id":"61698174","text":"Football Club Rio-Grandense, commonly known as Rio-Grandense, is a Brazilian football club based in Rio Grande, Rio Grande do Sul state.

In September 2020, Milton abruptly resigned from his position after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice began investigating claims that Milton and the Nikola Corporation committed securities fraud. ==Early life and education== Milton was born in Utah to Bill Milton, a Union Pacific Railroad manager, and Sally Milton, a realtor. He has a brother and three sisters. The family moved to Las Vegas when Milton was a toddler, but returned to Utah when he was eight. When he was 15 years old, his mother passed away from cancer. Milton is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and, after high school, went on an 18-month church mission to Brazil, where he became fluent in Portuguese. He dropped out of college after one semester at Utah Valley State College to pursue a career in sales and marketing. ==Career== Milton started an alarm sales company immediately after quitting college called St. George Security and Alarm and eventually exited the business for a stated $300,000, though his former business partner claims he was led to believe the exit payment was \\"much smaller.\\" Milton then launched an online classified ads website selling used cars, which eventually failed and was then followed by Milton’s first alternative energy vehicles company called dHybrid. Inc that retrofitted commercial trucks with engines that could run on natural gas instead of diesel. dHybrid landed a truck-conversion deal with Swift Transportation, leading to a mid-2012 lawsuit predicated on dHybrid's failure to deliver on its agreement. dHybrid would eventually be purchased by Worthington Industries in 2014 and, in 2015, Milton founded Nikola Motor Company with his brother, Travis, as the director of operations with a background in construction and remodeling. == Fraud allegations == ===Hindenburg Research Report=== In September 2020, two days after Nikola established ties with General Motors, short seller Hindenburg Research released a report accusing Milton of making false statements over the course of many years and characterizing Nikola Motor Company as \\"an intricate fraud\\". Nikola stock fell by eight percent that day and fell an additional 15 percent the following day, after Milton failed to deliver his rebuttal as he previously promised on Twitter. Further verification by Bloomberg and the Financial Times confirmed some of the details presented in the report. As of September 12, 2020, Nikola Motor Company is facing a shareholder lawsuit by at least one law firm for possible fraud, as detailed in the report from Hindenberg (most of Hindenberg's allegations referred to statements and actions from Milton). === Federal investigations === On September 14, 2020, Bloomberg, the Financial Times, and the Wall Street Journal all reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice had started an investigation related to potential securities fraud committed by Milton and his company. === Resignation === On September 20, Milton abruptly resigned from his position as Executive Chairman of Nikola Corporation, just weeks after tweeting that \\"cowards run, leaders stay and fight\\". As part of his exit package, Milton remains an unpaid consultant to Nikola until December 2020. He cannot comment about Nikola on social media, online blogs, or any other internet platforms without permission from the company. Milton retains 91.6 million shares of Nikola that are worth roughly about $3.1 billion. Following the Hindenberg Research Report, sexual assault allegations, and stepping down from his position with Nikola, on September 22, 2020, a rumor appeared from a satire account on Twitter claiming \\"Trevor Milton, Nikola Corp. founder and former executive chairman, was arrested by the DOJ and FBI at Sky Harbor Airport, in Phoenix, Arizona.\\" The tweet was then picked up by Techcrunch, sparking major outlets to report the news. Hours later, it was revealed as a hoax, and Techcrunch publicly apologized. Following the public attention, Milton deactivated his Twitter and Instagram accounts. == Sexual misconduct allegations == In September 2020, Aubrey Ferrin Smith, Milton's cousin, accused him of sexually assaulting her at their grandfather’s funeral in 1999, when she was 15 and he was 18. The Wall Street Journal later confirmed several details of the accusation, including that Smith was, indeed, Milton's cousin and that Smith had told family members about the incident months after it had occurred. Family members also told the Wall Street Journal that religious authorities were notified, but no charges were filed. CNBC later confirmed that Smith had filled a formal complaint with the local police in Holladay, Utah where the alleged assault took place. A Sgt. with the Unified Police Department confirmed that the complaint had been filled. CNBC additionally confirmed that in 2017 when the #MeToo movement was taking place. Ferrin Smith published an account of the assault on Facebook without identifying Milton by name. On September 28th CNBC reported that a second women had come forward claiming that she had been assaulted by Milton when she was 15 and he was 22. The alleged assault which constitutes rape and forced sexual assault under Utah law is being investigated by the local police. Milton reportedly bragged to his friend that he had: \\"took her virginity in the theater room.\\" Several others confirmed the allegations. ==Personal life== Milton lives in Phoenix, Arizona with his wife, Chelsey Bergmann, who he married in 2018. In November 2019, the Los Angeles Times reported that Milton had bought a 2,000-acre Utah ranch with a 16,800 square foot riverside mansion for $32.5 million. The purchase set a new record for the price paid for a home in the state. In September 2020, Forbes assessed Milton's net worth to be at least $3.2 billion, as he owned about 25% of the company, which was valued at about $12.4 billion. ==References== == External sites == * CNBC Interview: Nikola executive chairman Trevor Milton on the company's public debut * Q&A; podcast with Trevor Milton, focusing on Nikola's financials and technology Category:1980s births Category:Living people Category:American billionaires Category:American company founders Category:American chief executives in the automobile industry Category:People from Phoenix, Arizona ","title":"Trevor Milton"},{"id":"61698229","text":"AVB-7.62 is a battle rifle designed by Anatoly F. Baryshev that derived from his weapon operating system. It is characterized by significantly reduced recoil. ==Variants== === AB-7.62 and AB-5.45 === It have nearly 2/3 common part that borrowed from the AKM and AK-74. The 5.45 version was not to be interested due to the futility of already low-powered 5.45 cartridges that are not really need to reduce recoil. The weapon externally differs from the AKMS is only in the absence of a gas tube (a carrying handle is installed instead of it) and a different stock design. Due to such small differences, their balancing is almost the same, although the folding butt is undoubtedly more convenient than AKMS's, and but the difference in shooting is significant: the recoil is almost not noticeable, the barrel wasn't be thrown up, its pointing center is maintained, and the direction of shooting is maintained without effort. It's easy to shoot, although the weapon's behavior didn't make much impression. Apparently, because the 7.62 mm assault rifle cartridge is not quite powerful, in order to feel the advantages of the new design, you need to shoot more than one hundred rounds. According to its tactical characteristics, the AB-1(AB-7.62) has almost no difference from the AKM, but it allows the shooter to performing a much more accurate automatic firing at a greater distance than the last. == Derivatives == ===KPB-12.7 and ARGB-85=== ARGB-85 is a 30mm automatic grenade launcher under standard VOG-17 grenades.

Historic England describe St Luke's as a \\"pleasing Victorian Gothic village church\\", with \\"a careful use of materials\\", \\"good Victorian fittings\\" and \\"a sense of honest simplicity\\". ==History== St Luke's was built to replace an earlier chapel of ease which had been erected in Burton around 1836. A plot of land for the new church was donated by Sir George Tapps-Gervis-Meyrick of Hinton Admiral and the plans drawn up by Messrs. Benjamin Ferrey & Son. The foundation stone was laid by the Bishop of Winchester, the Right Rev. Harold Browne, on 15 April 1874 and the church built by Mr. Joseph Lander of Burton. St Luke's was opened on 25 October 1875, but not consecrated until 2 November 1876 by the Right Rev Dr. Francis McDougall, suffragan to the Bishop of Winchester. Burton became its own parish in 1877, with St Luke's as the parish church. ==Architecture== St Luke's is built of red brick, with dressings in Bath stone and roofs of blue slate, in the Early Gothic style. It was designed to accommodate over 300 persons, and is made up of a nave, chancel, south transept, vestry and south porch. The turret on the west gable contains one bell. Internal fittings include a stone font, oak lectern and reading desk. The benches and chairs are carved from deal. The church's floor was laid with concrete and wood, and the chancel paved with encaustic tiles from Minton, Hollands and Co. At the time of its opening in 1875, it was intended to commence work on the addition of a north transept and enlargement of the chancel in the near future. Owing to limited funds, temporary walls had been erected with this intention, but the proposed work was never carried out. The stained glass of the east and west windows was installed by Thomas Figgis Curtis of Ward and Hughes in 1899-1900. ==References== ==External links== * The Benefice of Burton & Sopley website Category:Church of England church buildings in Dorset Category:1875 establishments in England Category:Grade II listed churches in Dorset ","title":"St Luke's Church, Burton"},{"id":"61698303","text":"Konstantinogradovka () is a rural locality (a village) and the administrative center of Konstantinogradovsky Selsoviet, Sterlitamaksky District, Bashkortostan, Russia.

They ware surprised by the resemblance of the waterfall with their homeland and named them Caledonia which is an ancient Latin name of Scotland. Arabis purpurea near Caledonia Waterfall, Cyprus Quercus alnifolia near Caledonia Waterfall ==Description== The water of the waterfall falls vertically from a height of 12 meters. According to the season, the surrounding area is covered in lush forest and native wild flowers. Avoiding the nature trail, some choose to walk through a shortcut from Aeodion road through the Psilo Dendro Trout Farm. The trail can be followed from a parking area near the ‘Psilo Dendro’ (Tall Tree in Greek). Caledonia Falls can be enjoyed all year long, however, the rocky parts of the trail may be quite slippery after wet weather. Hiking boots are recommended for crossing the river in wet weather or after snowfall. Business Insider ranks the waterfall as the 14th Best waterfall in Europe. ==Location== The waterfalls are the highest in elevation found on the island and are located about 2 km north of Pano Platres village. The official starting point is 3km from Troodos square. Some tourists visit the area by using the roadway towards the waterfall or following the nature trail on foot leading to it through Psilo Dendro. The nature trail can take between 1.5 and 2.5 hours to walk. It is ranked as average (Level:3) in difficulty. The trail can be used for either hiking or walking but is best used from March until October. Dogs are able to use this trail as well. ==Etymology== A Scottish expedition saw a strong resemblance of the waterfall with their home land, (Scotland) and thus named them Caledonia - which is ancient Latin name of Scotland. The name of the Caledonians may be found in toponymy, such as Dùn Chailleann, the Scottish Gaelic word for the town of Dunkeld meaning \\"fort of the Caledonii\\", and possibly in that of the mountain Sìdh Chailleann, the \\"fairy hill of the Caledonians\\". According to Historia Brittonum the site of the seventh battle of the mythical Arthur was a forest in what is now Scotland, called Coit Celidon in early Welsh. The etymology is probably from a P-Celtic source. The modern use of \\"Caledonia\\" in English and Scots is either as a historical description of northern Britain during the Roman era or as a romantic name for Scotland as a whole. Ptolemy's referred to the Caledonia Silva, recalled in the modern expression \\"Caledonian Forest\\", although the woods are reduced today compared to the Roman times. This association with a Silva (literally the flora) reinforces the idea that Caledonia was a forest or forested area named after the Caledonii. == See also == *Troodos Mountains *European long- distance paths *British Cyprus *Roman Cyprus == References == ==Bibliography== * * * == External links == *Caledonia Waterfalls Category:Limassol District Category:Hiking trails in Europe ","title":"Caledonia Waterfalls"},{"id":"61698432","text":"In applied mathematics, the Morlely–Wang–Xu (MWX) element is a canonical construction of a family of piecewise polynomials with the minimal degree elements for any 2m-th order of elliptic and parabolic equations in any spatial-dimension \\\\mathbb{R}^n for 1\\\\leq m \\\\leq n. The MWX element provides a consistent approximation of Sobolev space H^m in \\\\mathbb{R}^n. ==Morley–Wang–Xu element== The Morley–Wang–Xu element (T,P_T,D_T) is described as follows. T is a simplex and P_T = P_m(T) . The set of degrees of freedom will be given next. Given an n-simplex T with vertices a_i, for 1\\\\leq k\\\\leq n, let \\\\mathcal{F}_{T,k} be the set consisting of all (n-k)-dimensional subsimplexe of T. For any F \\\\in \\\\mathcal{F}_{T,k}, let F denote its measure, and let u_{F,1}, \\\\cdots, u_{F,k} be its unit outer normals which are linearly independent. For 1\\\\leq k\\\\leq m, any (n-k)-dimensional subsimplex F\\\\in \\\\mathcal{F}_{T,k} and \\\\beta\\\\in A_k with \\\\beta=m-k, define : d_{T,F,\\\\beta}(v) = \\\\frac{1}{F}\\\\int_F \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{\\\\betav}}{\\\\partial u_{F,1}^{\\\\beta_1} \\\\cdots u_{F,k}^{\\\\beta_k}}. The degrees of freedom are depicted in Table 1. For m=n=1, we obtain the well-known conforming linear element. For m=1 and n\\\\geq 2, we obtain the well-known nonconforming Crouziex–Raviart element. For m=2, we recover the well-known Morley element for n=2 and its generalization to n\\\\geq 2. For m=n=3, we obtain a new cubic element on a simplex that has 20 degrees of freedom. Table 1: m <= n+1: diagrams of the finite elements ==Generalizations== There are two generalizations of Morley–Wang–Xu element (which requires 1\\\\leq m \\\\leq n). ===m=n+1: Nonconforming element=== As a nontrivial generalization of Morley–Wang–Xu elements, Wu and Xu propose a universal construction for the more difficult case in which m=n+1. Table 1 depicts the degrees of freedom for the case that n\\\\leq3, m\\\\leq n+1. The shape function space is \\\\mathcal{P}_{n+1}(T)+q_T\\\\mathcal{P}_1(T), where q_T = \\\\lambda_1\\\\lambda_2\\\\cdots\\\\lambda_n+1 is volume bubble function. This new family of finite element methods provides practical discretization methods for, say, a sixth order elliptic equations in 2D (which only has 12 local degrees of freedom). In addition, Wu and Xu propose an H^3 nonconforming finite element that is robust for the sixth order singularly perturbed problems in 2D. ===m,n \\\\geq 1: Interior penalty nonconforming FEMs=== An alternative generalization when m > n is developed by combining the interior penalty and nonconforming methods by Wu and Xu. This family of finite element space consists of piecewise polynomials of degree not greater than m. The degrees of freedom are carefully designed to preserve the weak-continuity as much as possible. For the case in which m>n, the corresponding interior penalty terms are applied to obtain the convergence property. As a simple example, the proposed method for the case in which m = 3, n = 2 is to find u_h\\\\in V_h, such that : ( abla^3_h u_h, abla^3_h v_h) + \\\\eta \\\\sum_{F\\\\in \\\\mathcal{F}_h} h_F^{-5}\\\\int_F [u_h][v_h] = (f,v_h) \\\\quad \\\\forall v_h \\\\in V_h, where the nonconforming element is depicted in Figure 1.

Shipbuilding was considered an art rather than a science. Part of the committee's remit was to ensure the proper education of promising young naval officers in all aspects of ship construction and, to this end, the commission would send officers on extended study tours to the other naval powers of Europe to learn not only of recent advances in ship building but also harbour design and maintenance, defence works, dykes, and flood management. Other scientific advances, mechanical and technical inventions not directly related to naval matters were also noted \\\\- occasionally, a little espionage was required.Royal Danish Naval Museum - Technology In 1742 the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences was established in Copenhagen to which the educated officer corps of the Danish navy contributed much useful debate. Apprentice ship builders would return from their foreign tours often to become members of the Construction Committee and to lecture at the Sea Cadet Academy on shipbuilding. Some would eventually become the head of naval construction, Fabrikmester, a position which required not only professional expertise but also political and personal qualities of leadership. Criticism on grounds of seaworthiness or cost of the designs, or loss of political support made the position of Fabrikmester very stressful for some of the incumbents. ==Notes== ==References== ==Citations== *Gyldendal - Th.

Prior to its publication, the book was subject to controversy due to accusations of racial insensitivity and plagiarism; Zhao subsequently decided to postpone its publication. The controversy received widespread media coverage, including write-ups in the New York Times, Slate, Vulture, and The New Yorker. Blood Heir was published in November 2019. ==Background== Zhao, a Chinese woman who had immigrated to the United States at age 18, matched with her literary agent after participating in an budding author event on Twitter for writers of marginalized backgrounds. Her proposed fantasy series sold at auction, reportedly for a high six-figure deal. The initial date of publication was to be June 2019. Circa January 2019, while revision of the book was underway, several users on Twitter accused the author of writing a book that lacked sensitivity towards African-Americans, based upon passages about slaves being sold at an auction. There were also accusations of plagiarism. The author issued an apology and asked the publisher to not publish at the time. According to Zhao, the slavery passages were based on examples of indentured labor and human trafficking in Asia, including from her native country, rather than American slavery. Aja Hoggatt of Slate wrote that the plagiarism accusations had \\"barely\\" any merit. Katy Waldman of The New Yorker wrote that \\"[i]f anything, the damning readings of Blood Heir seem guilty of something that the Y.A. community mitigates against: the misapprehension of a cultural context unfamiliar to one’s own.\\" In April 2019, Zhao announced that the publication had been rescheduled. Despite her views on the prior criticism, she made further revisions; editor Krista Marino stated that they \\"worked to further establish the nuances of indentured labor and trafficking within this fantasy world, without changing major plot points.\\" The publisher asked people who were to examine the work for possible representations of racial groups which would upset readers, and also asked scholars to review it. == Release and reception == Blood Heir was released in November 2019. In its review of the novel, Kirkus Reviews concluded that there was \\"no new ground broken,\\" but that it was \\"a good read for those looking for bloody action and twisty politics.\\" Publishers Weekly wrote that \\"Zhao’s plot imperils its protagonists time and again, leading the arc to feel repetitive and the protagonists less than capable,\\" concluding that the novel \\"may garner readership despite the melodrama.\\" ==See also== * Diversity in young adult fiction ==References== Category:2019 American novels Category:American young adult novels Category:Literature controversies ","title":"Blood Heir"},{"id":"61698586","text":"Maximovka () is a rural locality (a village) and the administrative center of Maximovksky Selsoviet, Sterlitamaksky District, Bashkortostan, Russia.

The estate was from 1760 to 1919 owned by members of the Qvistgaard family and has since then been owned by the Fabricius family. The current main building is from 1866. It is now operated as a venue for meetings, parties and other events. ==History== ===Early history=== In the 12th century, Gerdrup belonged to the now extinct Hvide family, but nothing is known about the ownership of the estate in the 13th and 14th centuries. In 1417, Jep Jensen (Godov) and his wife Elnæ Pallesdatter ceded it to Anders Jacobsen Lunge, who was one of the largest landowners of his time. After Anders Jacobsen Lunge's death in 1429, the ownership of Gerdrup is once again unclear. In 1475, Gerdtrup was the subject of a legal dispute between Jørgen Rud, lensman of Saltø, and Jensen Sosadel Dyre. Christian I ended up ruling in favour of Dyre, who had claimed that Gerdrup had been \\"in the custody of him and his parents in 16 and 40 years\\". His daughter, Anne Dyre, would later marry the squire Claus Hansen (Stampe). Their son, Søren Clausen Stampe, was the owner of Gerdrup in 1529. During the Count's Feud, in 1535, Gerdrup is in a cover letter listed as belonging to Knud Rud, but Søren Stampe is later once again mentioned as the owner. After Stampe's death, Gerdrup passed to his son-in-law Peder Markvardsen Hundermark, who served in the Kalmar War (1611–13) under his uncle, Herluf Trolle, A great-grandson, Erik Hundermark, was the last male member of the Hundermark family. After his death, Gerdrup passed to his sisters, Eline and Anne Hundermark. Anne Hundermark married Frands Kaas. Ellen Hundermark married John Cunningham, a Scotsman who had served as captain of HDMS Trost on an expedition to Greenland and was lensman of Vardøhus in Norway. Another Scotsman, David Welwood, who is buried at Eggeslevmagle Church, was also associated Gerdrup in this period. Peder Vibe I 1654, Hans Welwood and Lorens Cunningham sold the estate to Peder Vibe. Two years later they had to enter into a settlement with Claus Kaas, the heir of Frands Kaas, which required them to pay him 2,000 Danish rifsdaler for him to recognixe the deed of 1654. Vibe was ennobled in 1634. In July 1848, he was appointed as royal treasurer (rentemester). Vibe's widow, Anne Cathrine Budde, married Joachim Frederik Vind in 1662. He died right after the marriage and Gerdrup was then transferred to the widow of his brother vice chancellor Holger Vinds, Margrethe Gjedde. In 1693, she ceded it to her son-in-law, Diderich Grubbe. Grubbe and his wife expanded the estate through the acquisition of more land. Gerdrup was after their death sold in auction. It was acquired by their son, Holger Grubbe, a lieutenant. The following year he ceded it to his sister, Diderikke Elisabeth Grubbe. Another sister, Christiane Elisabeth Grubbe, seems also to have owned a share in the estate in around 1731. In 1731, Christiane Harboe (née Fuiren). She died in 1735 and Gerdrup was the following year sold in auction. The new owners were bailiff in Copenhagen Oluf Bruun samt prefect Jørgen Willumsen. Bruun became the sole owner of the estate in 1739. In 1750, he sold it to chancery councilor Simon Borthuus. He once again expanded the estate with more land. He was succeeded on the estate by his brother, auditor- general Otto Borthuus. He sold it to major Caspar Frederik Bülow. ===Qvistgaard family, 1760-1919=== Peder Vibe In 1760, Gerdrup was acquired by Morten Iversen Qvistgaard. He was also the owner of nearby Lyngbygård. In 1786, he became a member of the Great Land Commission. He was an enthusiastic defender of the great agricultural reforms of the time and implemented them on his estate. After his death, Gerdrup and Lyngbygård were both passed to his youngest son, Peter Christoffer Quistgaard. He was killed in the Battle of Køge in 1807. His widow, Henriette Elisabeth Schow, kept the estate after her husband's death. One of the two unrealized design proposals created by G. F. Hetsch in 1840-41 In 1814, Henriette Elisabeth Schow married Peter Johansen de Neergaard but a prenuptual agreement secured both estates as her personal agreement. In 1831, she ceded the estate to her son, Morten Christen Qvistgaard while Lyngbygård and the so-called Gimlinge kirkegods went to two other sons. Morten Qvistgaard commissioned the architect Gustav Friedrich Hetsch to design a new main building. Hetsch created two design proposals but Qvistgaard died before either of them was realized. His son, Victor Emilius Qvistgaard, who inherited the estate when he was just four years old, constructed a new main building from another design by Rudolf Unmack in 1864-66. In 1870, he ceded Gerdrup to his son. Viggo Johan Qvistgaard. ===Fabricius family, 1919-present=== Viggo Johan Qvistgaard's heirs sold the estate to Holger Fabricius. He had already inherited Lyngbygaard efter his mother, Tofa Alvilda Fabricius (née Qvistgaard).. Fabricius' widow, Kirstine Feiring, ceded Gerdrup to her son Peter Frederik Fabricius in 1953. Peter Nicolai Fabricius Melchior inherited the estate in 1987., ==Architecture== The current, two-storey main building from 1864-66 is a simple, red brick building.

The website was inspired by MySpace and was intended as a place where writers, artists, publishers, and fans could interact and share their work. Though ComicSpace was highly successful upon launch, it never fully took off. Roberts and Manley expanded the scope of the project with the help of investment firm E-Line Ventures in 2007, and Manley began merging his existing websites into ComicSpace, starting with Webcomics Nation. By 2012, interest in ComicSpace had waned, and Roberts and Manley abandoned the project. ==Concept and early development== Josh Roberts had created and run the webcomic directory OnlineComics.net since 2001, and began restructuring its codebase in the early summer of 2006. Robert had registered the domain name ComicSpace.com on a whim in 2005. In November 2006, shortly after being introduced to the social media website MySpace and longing for a break from the OnlineComics.net code, Roberts decided to build a comics-oriented version of MySpace to host on ComicSpace.com. ComicSpace launched within a month after being conceptualized, on December 5, 2006. Roberts sent out an email to the 4,600 webcomic creators who were registered on OnlineComics.net in order to give them a chance to register an account before making the website fully public. Because the actual webcomic hosting features were not in place yet, Roberts expected only a few hundred people to register. However, the website was an early hit, accumulating 3,500 members within the first week. Among these early users were cartoonists Warren Ellis, Dave Gibbons, Steve Rude, and Ed Brubaker. Roberts' initial plans for the website included to make RSS a major feature, and to allow users to specify their connection to the field of comics, letting users browse writers, artists, publishers, and retailers as sub-groups. When Joey Manley joined Roberts in 2007, he described ComicSpace as a user-generated content website, in order to contrast it with his own Modern Tales-family of curated subscription services. When asked what skills he and Roberts might bring to the table for ComicSpace, Manley noted that Roberts has experience with helping readers find and keep track of webcomics, while he had more experience with publishing and monetization himself. Advertising network Project Wonderful was incorporated into ComicSpace shortly after its launch in late 2006. The service auctioned 16 small advertisements at the top of the ComicSpace website, and Roberts expected to earn $1,000 USD per month after Project Wonderful took its cut. ==E-Line Media investment and mergers== Joey Manley selling merchandise at a ComicSpace booth in 2009 In October 2007, Joey Manley announced that he had partnered with Roberts, and that they had received an infusion of capital from an investment firm. Between November 2007 and April 2008, Manley's free webcomic hosting service Webcomics Nation, Manley's blog TalkAboutComics, and Roberts' website OnlineComics.net were all combined into ComicSpace. The website was funded by E-Line Ventures, a newly formed investment firm created by Alan Gershenfeld and Michael Angst. E-Line Ventures self-described as \\"a 'double bottom line' early-stage venture fund focused on empowering individuals, small businesses and disenfranchised communities through innovative uses of personal fabrication, digital media and on-demand business services.\\" Gershenfeld found Manley while looking for mobile phone comics content, and was interested in working together with him and Roberts to \\"empower\\" individual cartoonists. Roberts and Manley were the largest shareholders in the ComicSpace venture, each owning an equal portion of the company while E-Line was a minority investor. The two primarily decided to reach out for investment because they needed to hire significant programming, design, and business management talent to continue to innovate at the level they wanted to. Todd Allen of Comic Book Resources said in 2007 that \\"ComicSpace is poised to become what I would call a vertical portal for the comics industry,\\" as hosting, user-generated content, editorially-branded content, commentary, and social networking were all merged into a traditional comics-viewing portal. ComicSpace was to produce revenue for cartoonists through advertising, merchandising, and print publishing. ComicSpace's own earnings would be a function of the individual cartoonists' earnings. Manley stated himself that \\"the merchandising element will be the single most revolutionary part of it,\\" though Gershenfeld told Comic Book Resources that their main interest was being a service provider and facilitator rather than a publisher. ComicSpace was planned to relaunch in the second quarter 2008, but Manley wrote in January 2009 that the merger with Webcomics Nation was \\"one of the more technically difficult projects\\" they had undertaken, and that it was taking longer than he had hoped. In February 2009, a digital ComicSpace store went online, and the company had set up an online advertising network. Manley decided that he wanted to relaunch all of his subscription services under the ComicSpace banner. Manley's webcomic magazine Girlamatic, for instance, had gone quiet in the second half of the 2000s, but it was relaunched in July 2009 under a new business model and with an expanded line-up of artists. Manley's websites still functioned as online magazines, but the webcomics on these sites became freely accessible and the creators were supported by the ComicSpace ad system. At one point, writer Heidi MacDonald briefly talked with Manley about potentially integrating her website The Beat into ComicSpace. ==Abandonment== Manley was very enthusiastic about the ComicSpace project, and moved closer to Roberts in order to work on the company. However, the platform never fully took off, and Manley moved back to his native Kentucky in 2012. Though Manley continued to work on ComicSpace, his focus shifted on his creative work, and ComicSpace eventually shut down alongside Manley's other websites. ==References== ==External links== *ComicSpace.com, as captured by the Wayback Machine in July 2006, February 2007, January 2012, and December 2013 Category:Webcomic syndicates Category:Free webcomic hosting services Category:Blog hosting services Category:Internet properties established in 2006 Category:Internet properties disestablished in 2013 Category:American companies established in 2007 ","title":"ComicSpace"},{"id":"61698903","text":"\\"Ouni\\" (苧うに) from the Gazu Hyakki Yagyō by Toriyama Sekien \\"Wauwau\\" (わうわう) from the Hyakkai Zukan by Sawaki Suushi Wauwau (わうわう) from alt= The ouni (苧うに) is a yōkai depicted in the Gazu Hyakki Yagyō by Toriyama Sekien. It is a yōkai with a face like that of a demon woman (kijo) torn from mouth to ear, and its entire body is covered in hair. There is no explanatory text from Sekien, so it is unclear what kind of yōkai this is.高田衛監修 稲田篤信・田中直日編 『鳥山石燕 画図百鬼夜行』 国書刊行会、1992年、86頁。。 The \\"o\\" (苧) in \\"ouni\\" refers to the ramie plant or to bundles of string made from ramie, cannabis, among others, so it is said that Sekien gave it the name \\"ouni\\" because it conjures up the image of a yōkai with head and body hair made of layers of this \\"o\\". In the Hyakkai Zukan (1737, Sawaki Suushi), a yōkai emaki from the Edo period, it is given by the name \\"wauwau\\", and Edo period yōkai emaki would usually present it under that name. However, these presentations consisted of pictures, so it is not known what characteristics they had. In another instance, there is a drawing in the Hyakki Yagyō Emaki (Oda Gōchō, 1832) from after Sekien's era where it is depicted under the title of \\"uwan uwan\\", and it is thought that likewise the ouni is a yōkai that Sekien drew while referring to earlier emaki. ==Explanatory text starting in Heisei== There are no folk legends or records that are clearly about the ouni (or the \\"wauwau\\" based on Sekien's), so it is presently not clear what kind of yōkai they were intending to depict, but starting in the Heisei period, inferring from how there are many tales that seem highly related to the previous \\"o\\" and the yamauba, there have started to be many illustrated references, books, and other publications that suppose that these are yamauba who assisted in the making of threads and were taken in under the name \\"ouni\\", which would mean that the ouni is a type of yamauba. There are many areas with tales about yamauba who would make threads from o (苧), but the following example is from Kotaki, Nishikubiki, Echigo Province (now Itoigawa, Niigata Prefecture). There was a gathering of women who were spinning some bundles of strings with cannabis, when a yamauba appeared and said \\"I'll also spin some\\" and started to help along. The yamauba bit the cannabis and drew out strings and then spun bundles of string at a speed unbelievable for humans. After finishing the assistance, the yamauba left the house. The women tried to follow, but the yamauba abruptly disappeared. Before the proliferation of the idea that yamauba were related, they were often given the explanation that they would attack and eat people who come for a drink at a mountain stream.佐藤有文 『お化けの図鑑』 KKベストセラーズ 1978年 70頁 This can be said to be due to the picture drawn by Sekien. ==Notes== Category:Yōkai ","title":"Ouni"},{"id":"61698911","text":"Amtaedo () is the sixth largesthttp://eng.shinan.go.kr/home/eng/salt/page.wscms island in Sinan County, South Jeolla Province, South Korea.

However, on April 4, 2019 the Angel Bridge (천사대교) was completed connecting Amtaedo with the island of Aphaedo (압해도).http://www.doopedia.co.kr/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view&MAS;_IDX=190827001615689 Since Aphaedo is connected to the mainland by two bridges, it is now possible to drive to Amtaedo by car. The neighboring islands of Jaeundo (자은도), Palgeumdo (팔금도) and Chupodo (추포도) are connected to Amtaedo by bridges. == Amtaedo tenant's protest == From August 1923 to August 1924 there was a dispute on Amtaedo between land owners and their tenants over the high rent on farm land. Many of the tenants protested against these high rents by refusing to pay them.http://eng.shinan.go.kr/home/eng/tourism/tourism_01/tourism_01_02/tourism_01_02_14/page.wscms After some of the protesters were arrested, more than 400 Amtaedo residents traveled to Mokpo by boat and staged demonstrations in front of the police station and the courthouse. Eventually, the Japanese colonial government intervened and reached an agreement to reduce rents and release the protestors from jail. This triggered a number of tenancy protests on other island on the west coast of Korea.http://tour.shinan.go.kr/home/tour/island_tour/amtae/place/place_01/ To commemorate this event, the Amtaedo Tenant's Protest Monument was constructed on Amtaedo in 1998.http://eng.shinan.go.kr/home/eng/tourism/tourism_01/tourism_01_02/tourism_01_02_14/page.wscms == Amtaedo Lighthouse == Amtaedo Lighthouse is a small brick lighthouse built in 1913 on the north-eastern coast of Amtaedo. The lighthouse is painted white and emits two white flashes every five seconds. Due to the fact that the lighthouse is placed on a hill, the light source stands at approximately 38 meters (125 feet) above the water's surface.https://www.ibiblio.org/lighthouse/kor5.htm Since Palmido Lighthouse, the first western style lighthouse in Korea, was build off the coast of Incheon in 1903, Amtaedo Lighthouse is one of the oldest lighthouses in South Korea.http://www.chkorea.news/news/articleView.html?idxno=3563 While the site of the lighthouse is open to visitors, the tower itself is closed to the general public.https://www.ibiblio.org/lighthouse/kor5.htm == Noman Temple == Noman temple (노만사) was built in 1873 on the southern foot of Keunbong mountain. Although it is relatively small, this temple is notable for being the oldest Buddhist temple in Shinan County.http://eng.shinan.go.kr/home/eng/tourism/tourism_01/tourism_01_02/tourism_01_02_14/page.wscms When it was founded in 1873, Noman temple consisted of a singled building with a thatched roof. However, the temple underwent an expansion in 1944 that brought the number of building up to seven. Nomansa is also famous for a small fresh water well formed by water drops falling from gaps in the mountain rocks. It is claimed that the well has never dried up despite the fact that there have been a number of droughts since the construction of the temple.https://blog.naver.com/ttpp2002/221520368477 The water from this well is believed to have medicinal properties and to be an effective cure for gastrointestinal problems.https://blog.naver.com/janghaklee/221466263703 == Agriculture and fishing == The economy of Amtaedo is heavily dependent upon agriculture and fishing. The chief agricultural products of the island include rice, sesame seeds, beans, sweet potatoes and chili peppers. In terms of fishing, the main products include croakers, masu salmon, dotted gizzard shad, anchovies, hairtail and octopus.http://www.doopedia.co.kr/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view&MAS;_IDX=101013000851123 Although Amtaedo produces a variety of foodstuffs, it is most famous for the quality of its barley and garlic.http://www.shinan.go.kr/home/www/about/village_info/village_info_14/village_info_14_06/page.wscms == In literature == Amtaedo (암태도) is a novel by the Korean writer Song Gisuk.

It was designed by Frederic W.

The population had reached 5,000 by 1934 and expansion was set to double this number over the following few years. In February 1934, the Rev. C. W. C. Browne appealed before a meeting of the Bournemouth Ruri-Decanal Conference for £10,000 to construct a church. By February 1936, £7,080 had been raised towards the £9,500 building fund, while in September only £1,000 remained to be found. Mr. Frederic W. Lawrence of Bournemouth drew up the plans for the church which was influenced by Romanesque architecture. The foundation stone was laid on 14 August 1935 and the church was built by Mr. Frank Grigg & Sons. St Saviour's was consecrated by the Bishop of Winchester, the Right Rev. Cyril Garbett, on 22 September 1936. Described by the Bournemouth Graphic as a \\"most impressive ceremonial\\", the consecration marked the formation of Iford as a parish and St Saviour's as the parish church. ==Architecture== St Saviour's is built of multi-coloured bricks, with the interior walls rendered in plaster and the roof of tiles and asphalt. It was designed to seat 462 persons and made up of a nave, north and south aisle, chancel, Lady chapel, organ chamber, choir vestry, clergy vestry, warden's room and two west porches. ==References== ==External links== * St Saviour's Church website Category:Church of England church buildings in Dorset Category:1936 establishments in England ","title":"St Saviour's Church, Iford"},{"id":"61698981","text":"The Eureka Springs Cemetery is a historic cemetery located at the junction of County Road 205 and United States Route 62 in Eureka Springs, Arkansas.

It ended on 3rd October, 2020 amidst several rebellions for ending on such short notice despite being so popular. == Plot == The story started with two characters absolutely opposite in nature. Dr Ujaan Chatterjee; one of the best five heart surgeons in the world, with an attitude at its worse and an extreme workaholic, in short, he had no emotions and did not believe in love. Here comes Hiya Mitra, an aspiring doctor, a girl with a bubbly personality whose heart was filled with compassion to the brim. She took decisions not with her head, but with her heart. Initially, Hiya came to Kolkata to get admitted in the best medical college to get her degree, however unable to pay the high fees, she returned to her village,still passionate to help people.This medical college was a part of Tulip Hospital owned by Ujaan's father, Dr Samaresh Chatterjee. At a health camp in Hiya's village, Hiya encountered Dr Samaresh Chatterjee who had an age old knee pain which Hiya volunteered to cure with her Ayurvedic treatment. Interested by Hiya's enthusiasm, Dr Chatterjee invited her to his home in Kolkata for his treatment. Here, Hiya is absolutely delighted to meet Dr Ujaan Chatterjee and immediately idolises him and considers him to be her 'Guru' or greatest teacher. Ujaan on the contrary, is disgusted to encounter such a talkative, interfering girl. After a series of events, Ujaan and Hiya come close and it seemed as if they were destined to be together. However, Ujaan refuses to succumb to this truth as his mother, Basobi Chatterjee had been abandoned by his father and had remarried Minakshi, and Ujaan had had to live in his own house with the identity of his father's adopted child. This pained Ujaan to a great extent but he never exposed his feelings. Hiya became aware of this and tried to bring back his mother. Just as everything was coming together well and Ujaan was ready to express his true feelings for Hiya, she left him saying that she had never loved him. However, the truth was that she had a heart disease which could not be cured and she knew that Ujaan would not be able to bear this news. Ujaan was heartbroken. At this time, Jhinuk Sen enters Tulip Hospital. She had a psychologically challenged,abusive fiance and had escaped from his clutches along with her fiancé's daughter Oli, from his first wife. Ujaan develops a bond with Oli and he after knowing about her father's abusive nature, he enters into a fake marriage arrangement with Jhinuk Sen for six months so as to protect Oli. Then, destiny plays a part and Hiya again encounters Ujaan at Tulip in spite of trying hard not to meet him.They get married and Ujaan successfully operates Hiya and cures her of her heart disease. A few days later, they reveal their marriage to everyone while Ujaan's younger step brother Bihaan kills Dr. Jhinuk Sen whom he had drugged to kill Hiya. Bihaan gets arrested along with Minakshi who had made several attempts in the past to harm Hiya. Nilima, who had earlier intended to marry Ujaan and had tried to destroy Hiya and Ujaan's relationship, becomes friendly. A few years later Hiya became a doctor at Tulip Hospital. Further, Hiya and Ujaan welcomed their child, 'Hiyaan'.And then, they all lived happily ever after. ==Cast== ===Main=== *Sean Banerjee as Dr. Ujaan Chatterjee aka Raja (main male protagonist) – a heart surgeon, Hiya's husband.Hiyaan's father.

She is considered the most important representative of the feminist movement's moderate \\"bourgeois\\" wing in Nuremberg. Martin Schieber: Geschichte Nürnbergs. Beck, München 2007, , p. 115. ==Life== Helene Schmidmer was born in Nuremberg, the eldest of her parents' four recorded children. Christian Schmidmer, her father, was a prominent member of the city's business community and the owner of a factory producing wires and cables. Her mother, born Nanette Lotz, was the daughter of a top civil servant from the nearby Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. She attended the \\"Portsche Institut zur Städtischen Höheren Mädchenschule\\" (as it was known at that time), a prestigious school in the city's centre, and then, as was not unusual for daughters of the well-to-do at that time, concluded her formal education at a boarding school in Lausanne. From an early age she was exceptionally interested in literature. On 20 September 1882 Helene Schmidmer married the leading Nuremberg eye doctor, Dr. Sigmund von Forster (1851 - 1939) whom she had met at literary events. They made their home in Nuremberg. She helped him with his work: her humour and warm heartedness were appreciated by patients. The couple's daughter was born in 1894. While still a young woman she began to write lyric poems, as well as more light-hearted poetry, volumes of which she published. She donated the proceeds to charitable causes. She contributed a short comedy to a celebration of the Pegnesischer Blumenorden (a misleadingly named Nuremberg literary society). Further stage pieces followed, such as \\"Das Burgweiblein\\" (\\"The Burgess\\") in 1902, \\"Im Hause Martin Behaims\\" in 1907 (which premiered, appropriately, on German Geography Day) and \\"Historie einer Urne\\" (\\"History of an Urn\\") in 1913, a \\"Festspiel\\" written to celebrate the 44th congress of the German Society of Anthropology, Ethnology and Early History. Von Forster also deployed her literary talent and reputation in the service of the women's movement in which she engaged during or by 1893. That was when she teamed up with Bertha Kipfmüller and set up, formally on 16 November, the Nuremberg section of the Women's Welfare Association (\\"Verein Frauenwohl\\"), committed to improving conditions for women in the city and surrounding region. Helene von Forster became the association's the first chairwoman. Membership soon reached 2,000. The association oprganised evening classes covering matters such as home economics and budgeting, handcrafts and languages. They founded and ran the \\"New Nuremberg Women's Labour School\\" (\\"Neue Nürnberger Frauenarbeitsschule\\") and, from 1898, Bavaria's first post-natal women's hostel alongside the newly built city hospital in the St. Johannis quarter. This had what was seen as the important practical benefit of enabling working woman the chance to bring their babies into the world under medical supervision.Martin Schieber: Geschichte Nürnbergs. Beck, München 2007, , pp. 114-115 In 1894 she also organised a Nuremberg group of the Allgemeiner Deutscher Frauenverein literally, \\"General German Women's Association\\", a national umbrella organisation that had been in place since the 1860s, but which was undergoing major expansion nationally during the 1890s. She became a long standing member of the regional executive. This organisation took an interest in various issues associated with the evolving women's movement, but its principal focus was on women's training and education. Van Forster became the first chairwoman of the Nuremberg group. In her committee work she was commended for her nimble use of words and also for the human intuition and warmth with which she guided the meetings she chaired. Meanwhile her book \\"Die Frau, die Gehilfin des Mannes\\", which had been published the previous year, was finding a growing resonance. Between 1895 and 1909 she founded or co-founded several further organisations with the purpose of improving the condition of women.Forster, Helene von. In: Franz Brümmer: Lexikon der deutschen Dichter und Prosaisten vom Beginn des 19. Jahrhunderts bis zur Gegenwart. Band 2. Brockhaus, Leipzig 1913, p. 241. In 1908 the old (originally Prussian) ban on women's participation in politics, which for some years had been interpreted with varying levels of vigour in different parts of Germany, finally disappeared. Helene von Forster joined the \\"Fortschrittliche Volkspartei\\" (FVP / \\"Progressive People's Party\\"), remaining a member after 1918 when, following a party merger, the FVP became part of the new \\"Deutsche Demokratische Partei\\" (DDP / \\"German Democratic Party\\"). During the 1914/18 war she ran her organisation's own Red Cross hospital in Nuremberg. She also set up a women's education institution in the city. With many of the men away at war women were now expected to take a more prominent role in organising matters at home, and like many, by the end of the war she was convinced that women should be entitled to vote in national and local elections on the same basis as men. In the event, the new constitution introduced during the 1918/19 revolution, delivered equal voting rights for women (along with a number of other innovations which generated more discussion at the time), and in 1919 von Forster became a DDP city councillor. Membership of the city council in 1919 made her one of the first women in the new republican Germany to hold political office. Working with her party colleague and fellow councillor Agnes Gerlach she energetically promoted welfare measures, support for the blind, schooling for girls and women's health, along with measures in support of the arts and education more generally. According to one source it was the level of energy that Helene von Forster applied to her role as a campaigning city councillor that hastened her death. She died in Nuremberg on 21 March 1923, predeceasing her husband and survived, also, by the couple's daughter. ==Published output (selection)== ==Notes== ==References== Category:German women's rights activists Category:Writers from Nuremberg Category:German Democratic Party politicians Category:University of Basel faculty Category:Heads of universities in Germany Category:Nazi Party members Category:1859 births Category:1923 deaths Category:Politicians from Nuremberg ","title":"Helene von Forster"},{"id":"61699145","text":"Melvin Lyle Frederick (November 24, 1929 – August 19, 2019) was an American politician and businessman.

It was released in 1993 as a 119-minute video album and in 1994 as a 78-minute CD. ==Background== In 1992, New York City's Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts hosted two gala concerts commemorating the two hundredth anniversary of Rossini's birth. The concerts were filmed for EMI Records, who edited the best of their footage into a video album that they released in 1993 on both VHS tape and twelve-inch Laserdisc.Gramophone, June 1993, pp. 104-106 The following year, EMI issued most of the contents of their video album (arranged in a different running order) on CD: the omissions were the Overture to La gazza ladra, the quartet \\"Cielo il mio labbro inspira\\" from Bianca e Falliero, the trio \\"Pappataci! Che mai sento\\" from L'italiana in Algeri and the duet \\"Perché mi guardi\\" from Zelmira. ==Recording== The album was compiled from recordings of concerts that took place on 29 February and 2 March 1992 in the Avery Fisher Hall at the Lincoln Center, New York City.Rossini, Gioachino: The Rossini Bicentennial Birthday Gala, cond. Roger Norrington, EMI Records CD, 0777 7 54643 2 0, 1994 The audio was recorded digitally. ==Packaging== The covers of video and audio- only versions of the album feature photographs taken during the concerts at which the recording was made. ==Critical reception== Gioacchino Rossini, painted in the first half of the nineteenth century by an unknown artist Barrymore Laurence Scherer reviewed one of the concerts from which the album was derived in Gramophone in May 1992. The singer whose contribution he enjoyed most was Marilyn Horne, who performed not only \\"Mura felici\\" from La donna del lago but also a \\"Di tanti palpiti\\" that was to have been sung by an indisposed June Anderson. She was not as miraculous as in her prime. but \\"if steel [had] replaced the former velvet of Horne's tone, her passagework [remained] undiminished in splendour.\\" The runners-up for the palm of the evening were Thomas Hampson with his \\"delectable\\" if somewhat over-familiar \\"Largo al factotum\\" from Il barbiere di Siviglia, Deborah Voigt in the \\"Inflammatus\\" from the Stabat mater and Kathleen Kuhlmann in the \\"Agnus Dei\\" from the Petite messe solennelle. His view of some of the gala's other artists was harsher. Chris Merritt sang \\"Asile hérédetaire\\" from Guillaume Tell with \\"insensitivity to phrase and colour, merely treating the music as a build-up for a series of high notes that sounded like blood squeezed from a stone.\\" As for Rockwell Blake, \\"his grotesque rendition of 'Terra amica, ove respire' from Zelmira provided a series of bleats and squawks that were a travesty of bel canto.\\" The concert's opening number, the overture to La gazza ladra, was disappointing too, omitting its customary cymbals in order to achieve a \\"bloodless correctitude in the eyes of modern scholarship\\". It seemed to Scherer that Rossini's music had become an industry, in thrall to academia, in which all that mattered was that more and more of his scores should be performed. Whether his music was sung beautifully or wretchedly had ceased to be important.Gramophone, May 1992, p. 16 J. B. Steane reviewed the video version of the album in Gramophone in June 1993. The \\"happy event\\" began, he wrote, with the overture to La gazza ladra (The thieving magpie), \\"the only gazza recognized by the judicial bench\\", conducted by a man who appeared to be Jacques Offenbach but was in fact Roger Norrington. Marilyn Horne, still blessed with a royal, marvellously unwearied voice despite her advancing years, sang one of Malcom's arias from La donna del lago with rock-solid control and the precision of a pianist. Deborah Voigt was not quite so impressive in her \\"Inflammatus\\", singing with \\"some grandeur if little variety\\", but things looked up when Frederica von Stade presented an aria from La Cenerentola \\"with generous spirit and a winning smile\\". Rockwell Blake sang \\"runs prestissimo and high Cs galore, just as we knew he would\\", and his confrère, the \\"amazing\\" Chris Merritt, followed suit. Another high C came from the \\"hyperactive\\" barber of Seville, \\"more irrepressible than ever in the person of Thomas Hampson\\". Three less showy pieces were a reminder that there was more to Rossini's music than just an invitation to great singers to parade their scintillating technique. \\"As Kathleen Kuhlmann [sang] the 'Agnus Dei' and the chorus quietly [reiterated] 'Dona nobis pacem', there [was] a moment of something like depth.\\" A men's chorus joined Samuel Ramey in a \\"fine example of Rossinian mastery\\" from Le siège de Corinthe. And some \\"serious- minded dramatic tension\\" was introduced with a quartet from Bianca e Falliero. Finally a fourteen-voiced ensemble from Il viaggio a Reims gave all the concert's soloists the chance to bring the house down in an extravaganza of a finale. Avery Fisher Hall in 2014 Richard Osborne reviewed the CD version of the album in Gramophone in December 1994. Like Scherer and Steane, he singled out Marilyn Horne for special praise, lauding her contribution as the only \\"classically fine\\" one on the disc. He also mentioned Thomas Hampson's \\"over the top\\" aria from Il barbiere di Siviglia and the \\"Agnus Dei\\" from the Petite messe solennelle, the latter of particular interest because it was performed with Rossini's \\"reluctantly and tardily supplied orchestration\\". About the album as a whole, he was equivocal. On the one hand, he called it \\"spectacular\\", with \\"plenty that was fiery and eloquent\\", \\"set ablaze\\" by Roger Norrington's conducting. On the other hand, it had only a few items that he imagined himself wanting to hear again. He concluded by advising his readers that it was a concert best enjoyed when seen as well as heard. He had been amused, on returning from an evening out with his wife, to find his babysitter and her husband both engrossed in watching its video version on his television.Gramophone, December 1994, pp. 159-160 ==CD track listing== Gioachino Rossini (1792-1868) Le siège de Corinthe (Paris, 1826), libretto by Luigi Balocchi and Alexandre Soumet * 1 (10:11) Coro e cavatina, Act 1: \\"La flamme rapide...

The chair of RTVE is the chief executive of the corporation and chairs the Board, convene its meetings and execute its guidelines. The chair is appointed by the majority of the Congress of Deputies. Currently, both chair and board are vacant due to a parliamentary deadlock. Because of this, and until the Congress is able to reach an agreement, on July 27, 2018 Rosa María Mateo was appointed provisional sole administrator, a position which possesses all the powers of the chairship and bhe Board. ==Powers== The powers of the chair of the RTVE Board and of the RTVE Corporation are regulated in Section II of the Radio and Television of State Ownership Act of 2006: * To execute and enforce the agreements of the board * To prepare the formulation of the annual accounts of each fiscal year in accordance with commercial legislation * To prepare the operating and capital budget draft of the RTVE Corporation * To prepare the annual report on the management of the RTVE Corporation and its subsidiaries and on the fulfillment of the public service missions entrusted, the program contract with the State and the other economic and financial obligations assumed by the RTVE Corporation due to its public nature * To execute the general guidelines of action of the RTVE Corporation approved by the Board, as well as execute the principles that the said body approves on production, commercial activity and programming on state radio and television * To approve and celebrate the acts, contracts and legal business in matters and amounts agreed by the board * To propose to the Board the approval of the basic organization of the RTVE Corporation and its subsidiaries * To propose to the Board the appointment and removal of the first level officials of the RTVE Corporation * To direct and coordinate the activities of the governing bodies of the RTVE Corporation in accordance with the guidelines of the board * To propose to the Board the appointment and removal, at the General Meeting, of the administrators of the subsidiaries * The senior management of the staff and services of the RTVE Corporation under the basic guidelines established by the board * To be responsible for the automated files of the RTVE Corporation and ensure compliance with personal data protection legislation * During an electoral process, to act as a communication body between the electoral administration and the board ===Delegation of powers=== In accordance with article 21 of the Radio and Television of State Ownership Act, the Board may delegate to the President any other power of the Board, which will require the approval of the majority of two thirds of its components. However, the law itself limits this delegation; the Board cannot delegate its powers in matters related to the appointment of first-level personnel, to economic-budgetary matters, to internal control bodies, those related to the fundamental right of Article 20.3 of the Constitution or the proposal to remove a member of the Board. ==Appointment, removal and sole administrator== ===Appointment=== In accordance with Royal Decree-Law 4/2018, of June 22, which specifies, urgently, the legal regime applicable to the designation of the Board of the RTVE Corporation and its Chair, the Congress of Deputies is the body responsible for electing the Chair of the Corporation and of the Board, by a two-thirds majority, among the ten members that make up the Board. If this majority is not reached and, after 48 hours, the Congress must vote again and an absolute majority will be sufficient to confirm the candidate to Chair of RTVE. ===Removal=== The removal of the chair of the Corporation complies with the general requirements for the removal of the rest of the members of the Board: * Resignation * End of the term * Removal approved by a two-thirds majority of the Congress of Deputies, at the proposal of the RTVE Board, by: ** Permanent inability to exercise the office ** Firm conviction for any malicious crime ** A conflict of interest with other office or personal activity ** Reasoned agreement * Decision of the Congress of Deputies by a two-thirds majority of its members ===Sole administrator=== The position of sole administrator is a figure included in the Capital Companies Act of 2010. The sole administrator is a position that assumes all the powers of a company for its administration. The Radio and Television of State Ownership Act includes this possibility, although in its article 22 it prohibits that the Chair of the Corporation that has been removed, along with the rest of the Board, due to a bad economic management may occupy this position. In 2018, a reform was introduced in the form of the election of the chair, which requires that if after fifteen days, there were still not enough majorities to appoint the Board members, the Government shall propose a sole provisional administrator to assume the powers of both the Board and the Chair of the Corporation with the same previous procedure. This Sole Provisional Administrator shall be responsible for the administration and representation of the Corporation until the appointments of the Board members occur. This exceptional clause was first used on July 27, 2018, naming Rosa María Mateo as sole administrator with 180 votes in favor of the 350 possible. ==List of chairs== ===Director-Generals=== Source (until 2012): * Alfredo Guijarro Alcocer (1945–1951) * Jesús Suevos Fernández-Jove (1951–1957) * José María Revuelta Prieto (1957–1962) * Roque Pro Alonso (1962–1964) * Jesús Aparicio- Bernal Sánchez (1964–1969) * Adolfo Suárez (1969–1973) * Rafael Orbe Cano (1973–1974) * Juan José Rosón Pérez (1974) * Jesús Sancho Rof (1974–1975) * Gabriel Peña Aranda (1975–1976) * Rafael Ansón Oliart (1976–1977) * Fernando Arias-Salgado y Montalvo (1977–1981) * Fernando Castedo Álvarez (1981) * Carlos Robles Piquer (1981–1982) * Eugenio Nasarre Goicoechea (1982) * José María Calviño Iglesias (1982–1986) * Pilar Mercedes Miró Romero (1986–1989) * Luis Solana (1989–1990) * Jordi García Candau (1990–1996) * Mónica Ridruejo Ostrowska (1996–1997) * Fernando López-Amor García (1997–1998) * Pío Cabanillas Alonso (1998–2000) * Javier González Ferrari (2000–2002) * José Antonio Sánchez Domínguez (2002–2004) * María del Carmen Caffarel Serra (2004–2006) ===Chair or President=== * Luis Fernández Fernández (2006–2009) * Alberto Oliart Saussol (2009–2011) * Leopoldo González-Echenique (2012–2014) * José Antonio Sánchez Domínguez (2014–2018) * Rosa María Mateo (2018–) (as Sole Administrator) ==References== Category:RTVE ","title":"Chair of RTVE"},{"id":"61699201","text":"Little Baby is an Indian drama film, based on communication gap between Indian parents and their children.

In 1953, she was awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal for her contribution to saving Jews, resistance workers and allied pilots. ==Biography== Born on 30 March 1913 in the parish of Frejlev to the south west of Aalborg, Ellen Marie Christensen was the daughter of the farmer Peter Marinus Christensen (born 1885) and Christiane Hansen (born 1884). Brought up in a well-to-do family, after completing her school education, she trained to become a nurse. Under the German occupation, she was employed at Bispebjerg Hospital. She soon became a member of the resistance group Frit Danmark (Free Denmark) where she helped to produce and distribute illegal publications. Her commitment to the cause increased when the Germans began to arrest the Danish Jews in October 1943. Bispebjerg Hospital was used to house Jewish refugees until they could be transported to Sweden. Thanks to her active participation in this work, Christensen developed numerous connections with the resistance movement. Not only did she treat wounded refugees, but contributed to transporting weapons and explosives and to obtaining fake identity cards and other items to facilitate resistance work. She became the partner of the key resistance coordinator Jørgen Haagen Schmith, better known as Citronen (the Lemon). When he was seriously wounded by the Germans in September 1944, she cared for him every day. When the Gestapo discovered their hiding place in October, Schmith was killed but Christensen managed to escape, although her identity card had been found. As a result, she had to work underground for the rest of the war. After the war, she worked on several assignments abroad for the Red Cross, first in Greece and later in Israel during the Six Day War in 1967. ==Honours and awards== For her contribution to saving Jews, resistance workers and allied pilots during the German occupation, Ellen Christensen was awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal in 1953. ==References== Category:1913 births Category:1998 deaths Category:People from Aalborg Category:Danish resistance members Category:Danish female resistance members Category:Danish nurses Category:Florence Nightingale Medal recipients ","title":"Ellen Christensen"},{"id":"61699294","text":"Grover Francis Powers (August 12, 1887 – April 18, 1968) was an American pediatrician. He served as director of the Yale University department of pediatrics from 1927 to 1952. He won the second John Howland Award in 1953. Grover Powers was born in 1887 in Colfax, Indiana, and grew up in Lafayette, Indiana. He graduated from Purdue University with a B.S. in 1908 and from Johns Hopkins University with an M.D. in 1913. The first seven years of his career were spent at the Johns Hopkins Hospital department of pediatrics, where he worked with John Howland, Edwards A. Park, Kenneth Blackfan, and William McKim Marriott. He moved to the Yale University department of pediatrics with Edwards A. Park in 1921, and succeeded Park as chairman of the department in 1927, a position he remained in until his retirement in 1952. Powers' contributions to pediatrics included proposing guidelines for the care of premature babies and for the management of infantile diarrhea. He wrote an important paper in 1925 that outlined the principles of infant feeding, arguing that diets should be analyzed by a total caloric intake, including a combination of protein, fat and carbohydrates; these principles were adopted by nutritionists constructing adult diets in World War II. Another popular paper simplified the different options of cow's milk-based infant formulas, which received thousands of international reprint requests. He proposed giving liver extract as a nutritional supplement to children with celiac disease, and in 1949 he won the Borden Award in Nutrition for his research in pediatric nutritional deficiencies. Powers presented his ideas on creating residential institutions for intellectually disabled children to Wilbur Lucius Cross, the Governor of Connecticut, which eventually contributed to the creation of the Southbury Training School. Powers served as president of the American Pediatric Society and received the society's highest honor, the John Howland Award, in 1953. He also received a Lasker Award from U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson. He died in 1968 in New Haven, Connecticut. ==References== Category:1887 births Category:1968 deaths Category:American pediatricians Category:Johns Hopkins Hospital physicians Category:People from Clinton County, Indiana Category:People from Lafayette, Indiana Category:Physicians from Indiana Category:Johns Hopkins School of Medicine alumni Category:Purdue University alumni ","title":"Grover Powers"},{"id":"61699305","text":"Lafayette 148 is an American fashion house located in New York City.

She joined the Rōshigumi, Shinshengumi and later Shinchogumi forces, and worked as a pro-Tokugawa agent in the Boshin War. == Life == Nakazawa Koto was born in Kōzuke Province. She was very skilled in martial arts from childhood, especially in Kenjutsu. In 1863, she went to Kyoto dressed as a man, following her brother Sadamasa, who was a member of the Roshigumi group in Kyoto. At 170 cm (5'7\\"), she was tall for a Japanese woman at that time, so that she was taken for a man when she reported to the Shogunate officers in Kyoto. She took part in the Kyoto defenders group led by Kyokawa Hachirō. Although the Rōshigumi was funded by the Tokugawa Bakufu, the leader Kyokawa Hachirō and others had strong loyalties to the emperor and planned to gather other rōnin in Kyoto to combat insurgents in the city. On March 26, 1863, Kiyokawa led the Rōshigumi out of Edo as the vanguard of Shogun Iemochi's procession to Kyoto, where they arrived on April 10, 1863. When Kyokawa's scheme was revealed in Kyoto, he immediately commanded the Rōshigumi to return to Edo. The group was disbanded and the members returned to Edo. Nakazawa Koto and other officers went to Edo (Tokyo) and later became the founding members of the Shinchōgumi. == Boshin war == Nakazawa Koto and her brother joined the shogunate forces of Edo, the Shinchogumi. During the crisis between the empire and the Tokugawa Shogunate, Koto allied with the Tokugawa in the Boshin War. One cause of the war was Emperor Meiji's declaration that he would decree the abolition of the 200-year-old shogunate and impose direct command by the imperial court. Military action by the imperial forces and acts of violence by Meiji supporters in Edo led the Shogun Tokugawa Yoshinobu to attack and attempt to gain control of the court in Kyoto. Historical records indicate that, during the Boshin War, Nakazawa Koto defended the shogunate against the attack of the Satsuma and Ogi clans (the Satchō Alliance) in Edo in 1568. After those attacks, she and her brother participated in the Battle of Hokuetsu. During this battle, Nakazawa Koto, encircled by a dozen enemy samurai, broke the encirclement by defending herself with her katana and then pressing her attackers. == Legacy == While Nakazawa Koto worked as a member of the Shinchogumi, she always dressed as a man, even after the officers knew her true identity. In addition to being a great swordswoman, it is said that she had an exceptional beauty that left an impression on many people. A tale written about her says: \\"When Koto dresses as a man, many women fall in love with her. When Koto dresses as a woman, many men fall in love with her.\\" Koto was proud as a swordswoman and decided she would only marry a man stronger than she.

He was born on April 13, 1868 in Pinsk, White Russia (now Belarus) His father was a cantor; Solomon sang in his chorus from the age of 5. When his father died seven years later Solomon went into the tailoring trade while still singing in cantorial choirs in exchange for his meals. He left to join the chorus of a traveling theater troupe and was very successful in girls' roles. After being left behind in an inn as a mashkn (pledge that the others would come back and pay their bill) he went back to the cantor in Pinsk but was thrown out. He became a street singer. He wrote his first song at the age of 12: The desolate orphan, an autobiographical plaint. Having learned Russian he sang and played the fiddle from town to town, finally settling in Minsk, where he became a successful badchen, also writing songs for other local wedding singers. He wrote for Shomer's play productions in Warsaw. He published his first book in 1891. Solomon Smulewitz in 1903 In America he toured singing his own songs, which eventually totalled around 500 (in a letter to the press he claimed 300 written to his own melodies and 200 set to melodies by others).

His song \\"Khave\\" was so popular the famous Russian singer Feodor_Chaliapin included it in his repertoire. He was a prolific recording artist. Smulewitz had a strong and piercing tenor voice which suited early recording capabilities well; after 1920 both his manner of singing and style of composition went out of fashion. Smulewitz fell on hard times and to make a living continuously toured the United States and Canada from Halifax to Calgary and Winnipeg, often with his daughter Dorothy, without much success.

From 2007 to 2012 she was Minister of Social Solidarity. == Early life == Alves was born in Laclo, Manatuto. Her father was chief of a sub-district in Portuguese Timor, and then a member of the parliament of Manatuto during the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. Alves attended the Liceu Dr. Francisco Machado, Dili. She is married to Jacinto Alves, with whom she had four daughters and a son. == Resistance careers == During the Indonesian occupation of East Timor (1975-1999), Alves was one of the main female leaders of the resistance movement, especially around Laclubar and Laclo. She participated actively in the Organização Popular de Mulheres Timorense (Popular Organisation of East Timorese Women) (OPMT), the women's organization of FRETILIN. In 1978, Alves and her husband were arrested in the mountains and taken to Metinaro for interrogation. They were released after about sixteen days, and sent to Dili, where Alves worked as a civil servant in the Indonesian Industry and Trade Authority from 1983-1999. In 1997, she co-founded the women's rights organization Forum for Communication for East Timorese Women (FOKUPERS), and campaigned for independence in the run-up to the 1999 East Timorese independence referendum. == Political career == In 2000, Alves organized the first National Women's Congress. In the interim government under United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), Alves became a gender equality adviser on September 30, 2001. The same year, Alves was selected by Rede Feto, a network of about 15 women’s organisations, to stand as an independent candidate in the first parliamentary elections, but she was not elected to the national parliament of East Timor. Instead, she became an adviser to the Prime Minister on promoting equality, and in 2002, she was appointed director of the Office for the Promotion of Equality, a role she held until June 2006, when she was the first holder of public office to resign during the 2006 East Timorese crisis. In 2005, Alves was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of her role in the independence movement and her work for the rights of women. From May 2005 to 2007, Alves was an appointed member of the Council of State (Portuguese: Conselho de Estado), which advises the President of East Timor. From 8 August 2007 to 8 August 2012, Alves was Minister of Social Solidarity in the IV Government of East Timor, with Xanana Gusmão as president. In 2012, under a new government, it was reportedly proposed that she would be appointed Minister of Defence and Security, but according to press reports, President Taur Matan Ruak, who was a former military commander in chief of the army, opposed her appointment. Alves allegedly rejected a return to her old ministerial post because of the \\"insult\\". On October 23, 2012, Prime Minister Xanana Gusmão was finally sworn in as Minister of Defence. Alves was appointed a commissioner of the Civil Service Commission (Comissão da Função Pública) on 29 May 2015. == Awards == On November 28, 2006, Alves received from the government the Nicolau Lobato Order for her participation and contribution to the liberation of East Timor. == Publications == * c. 2004 - Written with blood, by Maria Domingas Fernandes Alves with Laura Soares Abrantes and Filomena B Reis.

Walsh was the eldest of six girls and two boys. Her father was a national school teacher and farmer. The farm he worked was his wife's sixteen-acre family farm. The dual income meant that Walsh was able to get a good education. She was sent to St Louis Convent, Monaghan town, and Dominican College, Eccles Street, Dublin. Following that she attended college in University College Dublin where she graduated in 1911 with a Bachelors in Arts in Irish, French, German and English. After college Walsh worked as a teacher. She completed the Cambridge higher diploma and worked in St Louis Convent teaching English and German. She then went to Germany to work in Altona High School in 1913 but left due to the outbreak of World War I in 1914. She moved to Belfast where she worked as a lecturer in Irish and English in the primary-school teacher training course for St Mary's Training College. ==Nationalism== Walsh was involved with the nationalist independence movement. She had helped Seán Mac Diarmada as a Sinn Féin organiser in Ulster and worked with Nora Connolly O'Brien and her sister Ina, daughters of James Connolly. She was a member of Cumann na mBan from its formation in 1915. She also assisted Mac Diarmada with correspondence to the United States in the lead up to 1916. Her local priest at home was an Irish Republican Brotherhood activist, Fr James O'Daly, who let her know the plan for the rising Easter 1916. Due to the confusion caused by Eoin MacNeill on Easter Sunday, the mobilisation planned for Tyrone was abortive. Various IRB activists along with the Walsh family, the Connolly sisters and Archie Heron tried to remobilise. Walsh and her brother Tom and sister Teresa helped to move armaments to the local company. Walsh remained involved in nationalist activities for the next few years and eventually had to quit her teaching position by 1919 because of harassment for her politics. Having returned home to Clogher from Belfast, Walsh was appointed by Tyrone County Council as their first woman rate collector in 1921. She was fired in 1922 for refusing to sign a declaration of allegiance to the King. When her family home was raided by the Royal Ulster Constabulary there were a number of documents found which were allegedly sedition and she fled Northern Ireland and moved to Dublin that month. An exclusion order was put against her by the authorities in Northern Ireland. ==Librarian== In Dublin by December 1922 her qualifications allowed Walsh to get a position as a children's library assistant librarian in Rathmines. It was a new library which opened the following May. Her family sold their land in Tyrone and moved to a farm in Templeogue, Dublin. Walsh herself spent time working in Galway in 1925 as an assistant librarian and in 1926 as chief librarian in County Dublin. She gained an associateship of the UK library Association in 1928 and began to ensure that the whole public library system gained a degree of professionalism that was new to the role. Walsh was elected to the executive board of the Library Association of Ireland in 1928. In 1941 she became chair of the board. Walsh was appointed to the position of chief librarian in 1931. There was a large scale reorganisation of Dublin local government which changed boundaries in the city. This marked the start of the modern library service in Dublin city. Walsh developed new library buildings in Inchicore, Drumcondra, Phibsborough and Ringsend. Walsh believed in 'revolution by education … for there can be no progress until the people have been educated first'. She ensured access to books in Irish and by Irish authors. She worked to increase foreign awareness of Irish literature and went on tours of United States cities giving presentations on Irish topics. Walsh continued to be a national activist using her home to launch the new party Saor Éire as well as working on the editorial board of The Bell with Peadar O'Donnell. She was a regular speaker at the meetings of the Women's Social and Progressive League founded by Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington and with Mary Hayden and Maud Gonne MacBride. Walsh died at home on 25 June 1949 in Templeogue and was buried in Templeogue cemetery. ==References and sources== Category:1889 births Category:1949 deaths Category:Irish women ","title":"Róisín Walsh"},{"id":"61699796","text":"1962 Soviet Class B was the 13th season of the Soviet Class B football competitions since their establishment in 1950.

They can also be written しゃうけら, せうけら, as well as 精螻蛄.This kanij is seen in publications like Mizuki Shigeru Furusato no Yōkai (ふるさとの妖怪) (Jakometei Publications (じゃこめてい出版), 1974), \\"Nihon Yōkai Daizen\\" (日本妖怪大全) (Kōdansha, 1991) but in the \\"Ketteiban (Authoritative Edition) Nihon Yōkai Daizen\\" (決定版 日本妖怪大全) (Kōdansha Publications, 2014), the 精螻蛄 kanji could no longer be found. ==Concept== In the Hyakkai Zukan, Gazu Hyakki Yagyō etc., they appear only in pictures with no explanatory text, so what kind of yōkai they are is a matter of speculation. In folk religion, there is a custom called the \\"shōkera\\" in the Kōshin-Machi where, due to a belief in an insect called Three Corpses inside the body that on the Kōshin night would rise to the skies and report that person's crimes to the Ten-Tei (heavenly god) resulting in the Ten-Tei taking that person's life, people would spend the night without sleeping so that the Three Corpses would not leave the body on Kōshin night. It is said that those who then proceed to quickly sleep during the day would receive some damage, and it is said that chanting \\"Is the shōkera still in the gut? At my lodging, will I not sleep? Will I sleep? If I don't sleep\\" (しょうけらはわたとてまたか我宿へねぬぞたかぞねたかぞねぬば, \\"shōkera wa wata tote mata ka waga yado e nenuzotaka zo netaka zo nenuba\\") would ward off this harm, so from this, it can be seen that the shōkera of Kōshin-Machi is a yōkai that causes harm to people. Also, in the writing Kōshinden (庚申伝) from the Genroku years, there is the passage \\"shōkera is an insect, and said in one theory to be the Three Corpses\\" (ショウキラハ虫ノコト也、一説三尸ノコトト云), so there is also the interpretation that shōkera refers to the Three Corpses, and it is also said that they are the personification of the three corpses or that their depiction was modeled after the Three Corpse's middle corpse, which took on the form of a beast. The Gazu Hyakki Yagyō by Toriyama Sekien depicts a shōkera looking in through the skylight of a house's roof. Yōkai-related literature starting in Shōwa and Heisei began to give the interpretation that this is surveillance to see whether people are following the rules of Kōshin-Machi day, and it is supposed that the shōkera would give a punishment by three fingers with sharp nails on those who break the rule. ==Notes== ==See also== *List of legendary creatures from Japan Category:Yōkai ","title":"Shōkera"},{"id":"61699908","text":"Kelly McKinley is the Deputy Director of the Oakland Museum of California.

He studied at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, playing first-class cricket for both and becoming one of the few people to gain a blue for both. He later worked for the World Bank from 1984, until his death in 2012. ==Early life, cricket and Oxford== Pathmanathan was born at Colombo, where he was educated at Royal College. He made his debut in List A one-day cricket for the Sri Lanka Board President's XI against the touring Marylebone Cricket Club at Colombo in February 1973. He followed this up by touring India with the Sri Lanka national cricket team the following month, during which he made his debut in first-class cricket against the Kerala Chief Minister's XI at Thiruvananthapuram, with Pathmanathan also featuring against Tamil Nadu. The following year he toured Pakistan with Sri Lanka, making one List A and five first-class appearances. After leaving Royal College, he travelled to England to study agricultural and forest sciences at University College, Oxford. While studying at Oxford, he played first-class cricket for Oxford University from 1975 to 1978, making 28 appearances. Pathmanathan scored 1,099 runs in these 28 appearances, at an average of 22.42 and a high score of 82, one of eight half centuries he made for Oxford. In addition to playing first-class cricket for Oxford, he also made ten appearances for the Combined Universities cricket team in the Benson & Hedges Cup between 1975-78. Returning to Sri Lanka after graduating, Pathmanathan played for the Sri Lanka Board President's XI against the touring West Indians in February 1979. He studied for his master's degree in the United States at Harvard University. ==Postgraduate studies and career== Sri Lanka gained Test status in 1982, though he did not pursue a career in cricket, with Pathmanathan returning to England in 1982 to study for a postgraduate degree at Darwin College, Cambridge. While studying at Cambridge, he played first- class cricket for Cambridge University in 1983, making seven appearances and scoring 263 runs, which included two half centuries. His time at Cambridge also coincided with his second spell playing for the Combined Services, with Pathmanathan making two List A appearances in the 1983 Benson & Hedges Cup. He generally struggled in one-day cricket, scoring 74 runs across twelve innings, with a high score of 58. He is one of the few people to gain a blue for both Oxford and Cambridge. He did not complete his postgraduate studies at Cambridge as he was headhunted by the World Bank Group, joining in 1984 as a young professional. His first six years with the bank involved a variety of postings across Africa and Asia, before working primarily in India and Kenya between 1990-2002\\\\.

Set in 2007, the novel is about a U.S. government coverup of contact with extraterrestrial life. Axiom's End entered The New York Times Best Seller list at number 7. ==Plot== In an alternate version of the United States in 2007, a famous whistleblower named Nils Ortega leverages his large online following to repeatedly attack the Bush administration, alleging a series of government cover-ups. The nature of Nils's work forced him to flee the country, abandoning his family. The story follows Nils's daughter Cora Sabino, a young college dropout living along with her mother and her two younger siblings in Southern California, where her paternal aunt also resides. Cora's family find themselves under constant supervision by agents of the U.S. government, including a high-ranking CIA official named Sol Kaplan. Following a meteor strike not far from where they live, Cora's family is abducted by government agents while Cora flees from a monstrous alien creature that broke into their house at night. The alien eventually catches Cora, implanting a tracking and communication device into her, using her as a human puppet to launch an infiltration of the Googleplex for unknown reasons. This infiltration fails when a mysterious pulse of energy knocks out the alien controlling Cora. It is revealed that the alien came to Earth to figure out how another member of his species died while being held in captivity by the government. Cora and the alien strike a wary alliance, as Cora wants to reunite with her abducted family members while the alien needs a human interpreter. Cora names the alien Ampersand. As the story unfolds, more and more dark secrets about both Cora's family and Ampersand's species come to light, with it being revealed that humanity will likely be wiped out by the hostile alien species Ampersand belongs to. Meanwhile, Nils and his followers continue to attack the government, embroiling George W. Bush personally in a scandal around an alleged attempt to cover up first contact with an alien species. Through it all, Cora and Ampersand forge a deep, romantic bond in spite of the vast differences between their species, biology, and culture. ==Reception== Reviewers liked Axiom's Ends fast pace and cultural commentary.\\"Axiom's End.\\" Publishers Weekly.

A complete NETDATA file consists of a number of control records, followed by data records and terminated by a trailer record. All records have the same format: * A one-byte length field containing the length of a logical segment of the file. A segment has a maximum length of 255 bytes. With the length and flags a segment can contain up to 253 bytes of data. * A one-byte flags field describing this segment: ** X'80' - this is the first segment of a record ** X'40' - this is the last segment of a record. If the record requires only one segment the flags will contain X'C0' ** X'20' - this segment is part of a control record ** X'10' - this segment contains the record number of the next record ** X'0F' - reserved ===Control records=== Control records have a six-character EBCDIC identifier in bytes 2-7 following the length and flags. They contain a number of self-defining fields, called text units. Each text unit consists of a two byte text unit key identifying this text unit, a two-byte big-endian binary number of length-data pairs that follow for this key (usually one), a two byte length field identifying the length of the text unit data, and a text unit of the specified length. Implementations are expected to ignore any text unit information not relevant to the receiving system. Header Control Record The header record must be the first record of a NETDATA file. It has the identifier \\"INMR01\\". It contains information identifying the sender: node (host), timestamp, and user id, the length of the control record segments, and the target (receiving) node and user id. It may optionally contain a request for acknowledgement of receipt, the version number of the data format, the number of files in the transmission, and a \\"user parameter string.\\" CMS allows only one file per transmission, but TSO/E and other systems may allow more than one. File Utility Control Record This record describes how the file's data is to be reconstituted. Its identifier is \\"INMR02\\". Bytes 8-11 contain the big-endian binary number of the file to which this record applies. If there are multiple files in a transmission they are numbered starting with one. The rest of this record describes the file's format, and one or more steps (\\"utility programs\\") which must be executed in order to rebuild this file. The text units identify the file's organization (INMDSORG: sequential, partitioned, etc.), its fixed of maximum record length (INMLRECL), its record format (INMRECFM: fixed, variable, etc) the approximate size of the file (IBMSIZE), and the utility program name(s) (INMUTILN). It may also contain the file's block size, creation date, number of directory blocks, name, expiration date, file mode number, last change date, last reference date, member name list (for partitioned datasets), a note file, and a user parameter string. Data Control Record The Data Control Record immediately precedes the data and describes its format, similar to the Utility Control Record. Its identifier is \\"INMR03\\". This record is ignored by CMS, but is used by TSO/E. It contains the file's organization (INMDSORG), its record length (INMLRECL), its record format (INMRECFM), and the file size (IBMSIZE). User Control Record The User Control record can appear at any point in the data stream. Its identifier is \\"INMR04\\". If present it is ignored by CMS, but may be used by other systems.

It inspired other works on the theme of military conscription, and the tune was still being played by musicians around the world more than a century and a half later. The original lyrics depict two young French lovers about to separate because of war. Jeannette expresses concern that Jeannot may forget her: Glover incorporated the title song into ‘The Jeannette and Jeannot Quadrille’, a dance music routine. The sheet music was illustrated by the well-known lithographic artist John Brandard (1812-1863). Combined with Glover’s music and lyrics, Brandard’s lithographs were then used to help put ‘Jeannette and Jeannot’ into British theatres. The prolific playwright Edward Stirling (1807-1894) produced ‘Jeannette and Jeannot’, also known as ‘The village pride’. Promoted as a ‘musical drama in two acts’, it was first performed at London’s Olympic Theatre in October 1848.Stirling, Edward, Jeannette and Jeannot or, The village pride: a musical drama, in two acts; C. Jefferys, London (1848)“If it had been produced earlier in the season, before the public had been almost cloyed with Glover's very pretty ballads, we should have anticipated a long run,” wrote The Theatrical Times. “The plot of course, is told in the title, and Miss Rebecca Isaacs, as Jeannette, looked very much like Brandard's clever lithographs on the music.”The Theatrical Times, November 11, 1848 A drawing by John Brandard depicting Jeannette and Jeannot farewelling each other. In Stirling’s play, Jeannot was leaving to fight in the French revolutionary wars as an army conscript. A new French system of conscription introduced in 1798, making men aged 20 to 25 liable for five years of army service, is seen as the beginning of modern European conscription.Linch, Kevin: Conscription, in: European History Online (EGO), published by the Leibniz Institute of European History (IEG), Mainz 2012-01-30. URL: http://www.ieg-ego.eu/linchk-2012-en In 1852, the London actor and singer William Hawthorne Eburne produced a second musical called ‘Jeannette and Jeannot or The Conscript’s Vow’. By the 1860s, the names ‘Jeannette’ and ‘Jeannot’ were being used by some publications to symbolically represent all young French lovers separated by the country’s conscription system.https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/01/archives/the-conscription-in- france.html The original lyrics of Glover’s ‘Jeannette and Jeannot’ have often been parodied. This is an extract from one example (sung to the same tune) from 1849:Monmouthshire Merlin, March 3, 1849, p. 4 The tune of ‘Jeannette and Jeannot’ is still played in the 21st Century by guitarists, violinists, pianists and other musicians.

Before her journalistic career, she trained as a midwife and studied law, becoming interested in poetry and writing. She studied journalism at the Mashal University in Kabul, Afghanistan. Mangal worked a number of jobs to financially support her siblings' educations. Mangal gained popularity hosting the television channels Tolo TV, Shamshad TV, Lemar TV, and the Ariana Television Network. She became known as a feminist and an advocate for women's rights in Afghanistan, particularly with regard to education and employment. Her arranged husband and his family saw Mangal's work and outspokenness on women's issues as a threat to their honour, and she had to leave her first job after he became violent towards her. A spokesperson for the Attorney General's Office told the BBC that the family had filed a complaint alleging domestic violence at the time. The couple were married for 10 years, but formally divorced following a lengthy appeal to the Human Rights Commission on the basis that Manga's life was in danger in his company. However, the former husband and his family continued to harass Mangal, urging them to remarry. Mangal's family allege the husband drugged Mangal and forcibly took her to Paktiya Province, where they tortured and beat her. Mangal's father says they eventually secured her release \\"with the help of some government officials and tribal elders\\". Prior to her death, she was a cultural commissioner to the House of the People, the lower house of the National Assembly. ==Death== According to a spokesperson of the Interior Ministry, Mangal was shot dead in broad daylight on the morning of 11 May 2019, in southeast Kabul. The spokesperson said that one or more assailants escaped the scene. It is unknown whether the murder was a terrorist attack or honour killing; the family suspect that Mangal's ex-husband or his family were involved, and filed a complaint against the former husband his parents. The former husband was also a police suspect immediately after the crime. She was 26 years old. In the days preceding the shooting, Mangal had detailed a number of threats made to her on Facebook. However, the police and authorities did not offer her protection. The circumstances of her death were criticised by Afghan women's rights activists such as Wazhma Frogh, who said \\"This woman had already shared that her life was in danger; why did nothing happen?\\", adding: \\"Why is it so easy in this society [for men] to keep killing women they disagree with?\\". Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the killing an \\"unacceptable tragedy\\", and the US Embassy in Kabul also offered their condolences. Her death was described by women's rights activists and parliamentary colleagues as part of a series of daylight killings of women in public life in Afghanistan, with many of Mangal's former colleagues calling for greater protection for women journalists. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 13 women journalists were killed in 2018 in Afghanistan, the most recorded in a single year. According to The Coalition For Women In Journalism Mina was one of five women journalists killed so far in 2019.http://womeninjournalism.org/detailed-reports-of-threats ==See also== * List of journalists killed during the War in Afghanistan (2001–present) ==References== Category:Afghan women journalists Category:Afghan political people Category:1992 births Category:2019 deaths ","title":"Mina Mangal"},{"id":"61700507","text":"The men's 81 kg judo event at the 2015 European Games in Baku was held on 26 June at the Heydar Aliyev Arena. ==Results== ===Finals=== ===Repechage=== ===Pool A=== ===Pool B=== ===Pool C=== ===Pool D=== ==References== ==External links== *Draw Sheet Men's 81 kg ","title":"Judo at the 2015 European Games – Men's 81 kg"},{"id":"61700533","text":"Gold digging may refer to: * Gold digger, a person, usually female, who enters a relationship purely for monetary gain * Gold mining, the process of mining for gold ore * Gold panning ","title":"Gold digging"},{"id":"61700537","text":"Jun Hee-kyung (Korean: 전희경, born 9 October 1975) is a South Korean conservative politician who is a member of the National Assembly from right- wing Liberty Korea Party (LKP) since 2016.

The content of the magazine was particularly addressed to writers and philosophers and intended to encourage intellectuals to write innovatively. It also included a special edition for women. In addition to numerous articles, poems, stories, essays, reviews and biographies, various visual materials, photographs and illustrations of political, intellectual and literary personalities, art works and public events were further edited. Well-known authors, like Köprülüzade Mehmet Fuat, Fazıl Ahmet, Mustafa Şekip Tunç, Mehmet İzzet, Ahmet Refik and Necmettin Sadık, publicized their articles. The themes were varied and aimed at arousing the readers' interest in various ways, as the main article in the first issue emphasizes. The spectrum ranged from political topics such as nationalism, reformism, progress, modernization, nationalization and economic development to art and science. In general, the magazine supported the legitimacy of the new government. For example, an article of 1929 promoting Mustafa Kemal shows its connection to the ideology of the new Turkish Republic.

Specifically, he accomplished most of his work in the Alice Memorial Hospital in Hong Kong, Cheeloo University in Jinan, China, and Severance Union Medical College in Seoul, Korea. Additionally, he is known for his contributions to the treatment of kala-azar, including his published chapter in Cecil’s Textbook of Medicine. He is described as a remarkable man, and a kind, outgoing, and endearing intellectual. == Early life and education == Ernest Black Struthers was born in Ontario, Canada to Mary Kerr and Robert G. Struthers. Specifically, he was born on Rose Street in the town of Galt. Although the Ontario Register states that he was born on May 28, 1886, his birthday was recorded as April 28, 1886, in his family's Bible. He was given the middle name Black after his great-grandfather Robert Black. His father owned a hardware store, and they were a religious family. Struthers was exposed to missionaries at a young age, since his family would often host them at their home. Robert Gordon Struthers, also a medical missionary, was his younger brother by two years. During his first year in college, Ernest Struthers decided to live his life in accordance with the principles of Christianity. Struthers obtained a B.A in 1910 from the University of Toronto and a M.B (Bachelor of Medicine) in June 1912. After graduating, Struthers made prints for his father’s business, “The Galt Electric and Gas Fixture Company,” and decided to go to England in 1912,University of Toronto Medical Building, university that Ernest Black Struthers received his M.B. from in 1912 == Personal life == Struthers became engaged to Margaret Walks on October 5, 1915, and they married on May 10, 1916. Their first child, Gilchrist Struthers, was born on April 11, 1917, and their second child, David Struthers, was born February 22, 1922. Mary Struthers, their third child, was born June 6, 1926. Margaret passed away December 3, 1948. Struthers married Elda Daniels on July 20, 1957 in Korea. Altogether, he had 12 grandchildren. == Missionary work == === Work in Hong Kong === In England in 1912, Struthers was accepted into the China Customs Service in Fuzhou. However family friends who he was staying with in London, the Merrys, disapproved of this because the China Customs Service was not “missionary” work. Ultimately, he changed his plans and traveled to Hong Kong under the London Missionary Society to replace Dr. Mitchell, due to Mitchell's illness, for a year and a half. Struthers arrived in Hong Kong February 20, 1913, and began working at the Alice Memorial Hospital. He lived with H.R. Wells. Along with a Dr Gibson, performed many unique operations, including a man with the congenital deformity of harelip and a boy with a tapering stone. He was responsible for the post- operative care and the eye ward. In September 1913, while still working at the Alice Memorial Hospital, Struthers also became the Warden of Morrison Hall, which was a hostel at the University of Hong Kong sponsored by the London Missionary Society. He oversaw students' activities and was responsible for the accounts. After his 18 month appointment in Hong Kong had ended, Struthers decided to leave for home and join the Canadian Presbyterian Board in September 1914 due to his lack of knowledge of Cantonese. However, in Welhei, he was convinced to stay and learn the language, and by 1915, he was working at the Henan province as part of a Canadian mission. === Work in the First World War === In 1916, Struthers received a message from the British Minister in Peking to the Presbyterian Mission asking for missionaries who knew the Chinese language to serve in France. Struthers volunteered and was a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps. He arrived in Noyelles-sur-mer, France, in July and started by running a gonorrhea and syphilis ward, helping at a hut with patients in serious condition, and monitoring the sanitation of a hospital. He also ran a hospital for the Chinese Labor Corps, and he worked in the Noyelles-sur-Mer hospital’s convalescent camp in the Crecy Forest as part of the Canada Army Medical Corps. In the summer of 1918, he worked 24 hours days at a shelter in Seignville. After the war, he completed five weeks of postgraduate study in New York. === Work in China === In February 1919, Struthers returned to China and became a physician at the Cheeloo University in Jinan, which was known as the Shantung Christian Union Medical College. It was considered the highest school of learning by 15 mission boards. In addition to practicing medicine, he taught pharmacology, therapeutics, tropical medicine, and internal medicine. In the summer of 1924, he went on furlough and did deputation work in Canada. He also spent six weeks doing clinical experience with Dr. Peabody at the Boston City Hospital. Bergen Hall Chemistry Building of Cheeloo University 1924, where Struthers was the Dean 1942-1948 At Cheeloo University, Struthers was appointed as a representative of the Canadian Presbyterians. In 1928, fighting occurred between the Chinese Nationalist troops and the Japanese in the Shandong province before the Nationalists gained control a year later. During this time, Struthers reported on the terrors that occurred, specifically at the Chinese military hospital. Life was dangerous and fearful during this time. Along with William McClure and George M. Ross, Struthers sent a cable to Dr. A. E. Armstrong, of the United Church Foreign Missionary Board, on May 7, 1928, stating \\"Expect aid. All well.\\" During his second furlough, Struthers studied in Calcutta at the School of Tropical Medicine and travelled to 39 cities. In 1930, he became the Associate Professor of Medicine, and from 1934-1950, Struthers was the Professor of Medicine. From October 1935 – 1936, Struthers initiated a successful program for about 20,000 flood refugees of the Yellow River. This program included vaccination for smallpox, supply of vitamins, and preventative measures of infectious diseases. These measures included supply of clean baths and solutions to anesthetize lice which spread diseases. Struthers was also the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of the Cheeloo University from 1942-1948. He took a leave of absence 1944-1945, and he gave the deanship to Hou Pao-chang during this time. During this leave, Struthers served as a Consultant on China to the Surgeon General in Washington, DC. He prepared descriptions of medical facilities, water supplies, and dangerous animals. After the Japanese left Cheeloo, Struthers was sent back to guard the hospitals from a Nationalist take over. He obtained support from General Oldum, who was the Canadian Ambassador in Chungking, the Governor of the Province, and the Minister of Education. Struthers worked hard to ensure no medical equipment was taken by the Nationalists, and he reopened the hospital. As Dean of Cheeloo, Struthers moved the medical school to Fuzhou in 1948 for a year due to a fear of a Communist attack, He left for Canada in 1950 after returning when Shanghai fell to the Communists. === Work in Korea === Shortly after returning to Toronto, Canada, during which he worked in tuberculosis surveillance, Struthers traveled to Korea in 1953. He became Professor of Internal Medicine and Tuberculosis at the Severance Union Medical College, Seoul, from 1953-1960. He established his first clinic there in 1954, and he believed that overcrowded housing and poor infrastructure were major issues causing a tuberculosis crisis. On December 22, 1956, New York financier John Hay Whitney gave Struthers $5,000 for his tuberculosis control project of the Korean Church Works service. Whitney told Struthers that this money was the first installment of $15,000 that he and his wife hoped to give to Struthers. Struthers believed about 6.5% of the population in Korea had tuberculosis. In Korea, he opened up a general hospital with a tuberculosis ward. He also was a consultant in tuberculosis to the Republic of Korea, Department of Health and Social Affairs, from 1961-1963. == Advancements in Kala-azar == Parasites of kala-azar, a disease that Struthers made notable research contributions to After receiving his diploma in tropical medicine and hygiene from the London School of Tropical Medicine in 1925, Struthers returned to the Cheeloo University and began to also study tropical and parasitic diseases. Specifically, Struthers became a leading researcher on kala-azar (leishmaniasis), a disease transmitted by sandflies which is caused by a parasite invading the blood-forming organs. Symptoms include an enlarged spleen, irregular fever, a dusky appearance, and anemia. In 1920, the mortality rate was 90% without treatment. In 1924, Struthers published his first article on kala-azar in the China Missionary Medical Journal. He began working with Dr. Jean Isabelle Dow at the Cheeloo University there. They worked together until her death in 1927. In 1928, Dr. Russell LaFayette Cecil of the Cornell Medical School in New York asked him to author the chapter on Leishmaniasis for his Textbook on Medicine, a notable achievement. On his furlough in 1930, Struthers studied kala-azar at the School of Tropical Medicine in Calcutta. Struthers also worked with Dr. Lionel E. Napier and his colleagues at this school. In 1933 and 1934, they promoted the hypothesis that the sand fly was the transmission vector for the disease. To diagnose patients, Struthers performed spleen punctures to confirm the presence of Leishman-Donovan bodies. He began treating patients with potassium antimony tartrate. Later, he used an organic preparation of antimony. Over time, about 80-95% of treated patients were cured, and the treatment time dramatically decreased from eight months to three weeks. == Death == Struthers passed away on May 22, 1977, at age 90. He is buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Toronto, Ontario. == Publications == Struthers primarily published in the Chinese Medical Journal, and his most notable publication includes his chapter titled \\"The Leishmaniases\\" in Cecil's Textbook of Medicine. *“The Leishmaniases” - Cecil’s Textbook of Medicine, 1929 * “Kala-azar, Criterion of Care” - Chinese Medical Journal, 1924 (March) * “The Globulin Precipitation Test and Formol Gel Test in the Diagnosis of Kala-azar”, Chinese Medical Journal, March, 1924 * “Neostam - Stibamine Glucoside in the Treatment of Kala-azar”, Chinese Medical Journal, January, 1927 * “The Treatment of Kala- azar by Stibosan (Hayden 471) and Anti-mosan (Hayden 661)”, Chinese Medical Journal, September, 1927 * “Splenomegaly in the Diagnosis of Kala-azar”, Chinese Medical Journal, August, 1929 * “Neostibosan in the Treatment of Kala- azar”, Chinese Medical Journal, January, 1931 * “Antimony in the Treatment of Kala-azar and its Toxic Effects”, Chinese Medical Journal, Vol. 47: 1421-33, 1933 * “The Treatment of Kala-azar with Solustibosan”, Chinese Medical Journal, Vol. 52: 335-338, September, 1937 * “Nephritis with Edema Caused by Malignant Nephritis”, Chinese Medical Journal, April, 1928 * “Report on Medical Relief for Flood Refugees”, Chinese Medical Journal, Vol, 50: 1670, 1936 * “Acute Leukemia, Seven Cases”, Chinese Medical Journal, Vol. 51: 471-478, 1937 * “Relation of Medical Schools to the Rural Health Program”, Chinese Medical Journal, Vol. 52: 447, 1937 * “Tuberculosis in Korea - a Control Project”, Journal American Medical Association, April 12, 1958 * “Tuberculosis Contacts in Seoul, Korea - an Analysis of 3002 Household Contacts”, American Review of Respiratory Diseases, Vol. 83, June, 1961 * “Tuberculosis in Korea”, Korea Calling, July 1962 * “Treating Tuberculosis in Korea”, The Medical Graduate, Vol. 10 No. 2, 1963-1964 * U.S. Army War Department Technical Bulletin - Medical Sanitary Data on Southeastern China” - June 1945 - 94 pages, Washington, D.C. - produced with the assistance of Dr. A.R.

Margaret Winstar's family background is unclear, although it has been suggested her family name was \\"Wenckstern\\" or \\"Venstermand\\". Robert Bowes noted that she was descended from a wealthy Danish family.Thomas Riis, Should auld acquaintance be forgot, vol. 2 (Odense 1988), pp. 296-7: CSP Scotland, vol. 10, p. 752 see TNA SP52/49 f.5. She was a favoured courtier of Anne of Denmark, whose Scottish household included ladies in waiting and servants from Denmark and the northern states of Germany. Winstar accompanied the queen went she went out riding.Michael Pearce, 'Anna of Denmark: Fashioning a Danish Court in Scotland', The Court Historian, 24:2 (2019) pp. 148-9 Winstar is remembered because of her relationship and marriage with John Wemyss of Logie, a servant or varlet in the bedchamber of James VI of Scotland, and the daring escape she planned for him, featured in ballads and chronicles. ==Logie's confession== In 1592, John Wemyss of Logie helped Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell who was a rebel against the king.Alan Stewart, The Cradle King (London, 2004), p. 133. He was a son of Andrew Wemyss of Myrecairnie and Logie and a cousin of David Wemyss, laird of West Wemyss whose sister Euphemia was a lady-in-waiting to the queen.William Fraser, Memorials of the family of Wemyss of Wemyss, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1888), pp. 62-4. Logie was probably the valet who attended the king at the wedding of Lilias Murray, the Laird of Tullibardine's daughter, and John Grant of Freuchie on 21 June 1591.Michael Pearce, 'Anna of Denmark: Fashioning a Danish Court in Scotland', The Court Historian, 24:2 (2019) p. 148: Jemma Field, Anna of Denmark: The Material and Visual Culture of the Stuart Courts (Manchester, 2020), p. 135. Another of Bothwell's supporters, Josias Stewart, was the son of Margaret Stewart, Mistress of Ochiltree, a senior lady in waiting whose three daughters were maidens of honour in the queen's household. Possibly Logie and Josias Stewart were friends, and Margaret Winstar came to know Logie through this connection. Winstar was still at court, in high favour and on 13 June 1592 Anna of Denmark ordered matching orange gowns with green sleeves for her, herself, and the Scottish maiden of honour Marie Stewart.Jemma Field, Anna of Denmark: The Material and Visual Culture of the Stuart Courts (Manchester, 2020), p. 139: Michael Pearce, 'Anna of Denmark: Fashioning a Danish Court in Scotland', The Court Historian, 24:2 (2019) p. 148 In August the Duke of Lennox arrested Logie and Michael Balfour of Burleigh. Logie confessed to planning four different attempts to capture the king. One of these schemes involved Margaret Winstar, identified as his mistress or fiancée. She would steal the keys to the back gate of Dalkeith Palace and let in Bothwell's men. When James interrogated him, Logie was immediately cooperative and withheld nothing. This full and unexpected confession was tantamount to his own death sentence. Logie said that many other royal servants were allies of Bothwell, in part because they had not been paid. He said that Bothwell received money from Spain but Burleigh explained this as a deliberate rumour to encourage Bothwell's supporters. The English diplomat Robert Bowes thought that James VI meant to have Logie executed, but guessed that the queen and Margaret Winstar, who was from a well-connected family and thought to be related to the queen, would intercede to save his life.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 751: Thomas Thomson ed., History of the Kirk of Scotland by David Calderwood, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), 207. ==Escape from Dalkeith Palace== Logie was imprisoned in Dalkeith Palace. He escaped with the help of Margaret Winstar who slept in the queen's bedchamber. Winster asked the guards to bring the prisoner to the queen, and then led him through the queen's bedchamber to a window where she had left a rope (or a pair of sheets). An accomplice was waiting below with a horse.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 752-5: Calendar of Border Papers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1894), p. 405: Thomas Thomson, History of the Kirk of Scotland by David Calderwood, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), pp. 173-4. The escape echoed the scheme of one of Logie's confessions. The story is the basis of the ballad, \\"The Laird of Logie\\" and its variant \\"The Laird of Ochiltree\\". The escape was highlighted in a contemporary narrative, The Historie and Life of King James the Sext. The anonymous author calls Margaret \\"Twynstoun\\". He draws attention to her role in the rescue as an act of charity and a good example for posterity, concluding that by \\"hir gude cheritable help he happilie escapit be the subteltie of loove\\".Thomas Thomson ed., The Historie and Life of King James the Sext (Edinburgh, 1825), pp. 253-4. His narrative of the escape is quoted here with spellings modernised; > \\"And because the event of this matter had such a success, it shall also be > praised by my pen, as a worthy turn, proceeding from honest, chaste love and > charity, which should in no way be obscured from posterity for a good > example. And therefore I have thought good to insert the same for a > perpetual memorial.

Logie made his getaway on a horse brought by his friend Archibald Wauchope of Niddrie.James Dennistoun, Moysie's Memoirs of the Affairs of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1830), p. 95. James VI asked the queen to send Winstar back to Denmark but she refused. A newsletter sent to England reported that the queen said she would rather go back to Denmark than part with Mistress Margaret or any other domestic servants.TNA SP52/49 f.6. Instead Winstar stayed at Wemyss Castle for a while. On 9 November 1592 Anne of Denmark wrote to the Laird of Wemyss to thank him for looking after her.William Fraser, Memorials of the family of Wemyss of Wemyss, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1888), p. 31 and plate. Margaret Winstar was back in favour at court. On the evening of 5 August 1593 the queen sent her with letters to the departing Danish ambassadors, Niels Krag and Steen Bille.'Acta Legationis Scotica, 1593', p. 82: A journal of the Danish embassy (Latin). Rigsarkivet ==Marriage== Logie was pardoned by James VI and he was married to Margaret in October or November 1593. A charter of December 1594 names his wife as \\"Margaret Weiksterne\\". A chronicle states that Sir Peter Young, the king's almoner and ambassador to Denmark, had paid her dowry.William Fraser, Memorials of the family of Wemyss of Wemyss, vol. 1, pp. 178-9; vol. 3, p. 31; Annie I. Cameron, Warrender Papers, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1932), p. 53. The exact date of their wedding is unknown, the marriage contract was dated November 1593 and March 1594, for Logie to inherit the lands of Myrecairnie, Wester Cruivie, Brighouse, and Logie. James VI also planned to make the lands of Logie a barony.Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1817), pp. 124-5; see the register of the privy seal, National Records of Scotland PS1/67 f.62-63. Anna gave her clothes, including blue velvet night-gear, and a present of an elaborate bed with rich curtain fabrics.Jemma Field, Anna of Denmark: The Material and Visual Culture of the Stuart Courts (Manchester, 2020), p. 135. Mary, Queen of Scots had given her lady-in-waiting Mary Livingston a bed on her marriage in 1565.Joseph Robertson, Inventaires de la Royne Descosse (Edinburgh, 1863), pp. lxxxii, 31, 153. Margaret, now called \\"Lady Logie\\" went to Denmark (or Holstein) in June 1594 to see her family and returned to Scotland after a year in July 1595. Roger Aston heard she had been to see the queen's mother Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow and brought back a message that the queen ought to obey the king in all things.Annie I. Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), nos. 346, 360, 373, 594, 636. ==Logie in Holstein and the Netherlands== Logie continued to be suspected, and in August 1594 was again implicated in Bothwell's rebellion. He was arrested on his way to Stirling Castle for the banquet for the baptism of Prince Henry. He was imprisoned at Blackness Castle then in Edinburgh Castle, and threatened with execution.David Laing, Original Letters of John Colville (Edinburgh, 1858), pp. 120, 123, 128: Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), no. 336. Again the queen intervened for his life and he was released and went abroad. His sister, Eufame Wemyss, was banished from the household and the queen's presence.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1882), p. 240. Logie wrote on 3 October 1595 to an associate of Sir Robert Cecil describing his journey from England and a meeting with an Italian at Kiel in Holstein, which may suggest that Margaret's family was in Holstein.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1952), pp. 29-30. He was arrested at Veere and questioned about his movements, his connections to Jesuits, and to the Earl of Essex. Logie answered that he had been travelling to see his wife in Holstein but had missed seeing her.Calendar of the Cecil Papers in Hatfield House, 1596, vol. 6 (London, 1895), 1 & 9 & 10 Dec. 1596; R. B. Wernham, List and Analysis of State Papers: January to December 1596 (London, 2000), 92, 117. He was accused of planning to capture for Spain the Gunpowder tower, the \\"Kruittoren\\", that overlooked the harbour at Veere. He confessed immediately when he was shown the rack. He blamed a Scottish Jesuit Dr Hamilton and two Spanish men who had approached him while he was in prison in Brussels for devising the plan.Thomas Birch, Memoirs of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, vol. 2 (London, 1754), pp. 216-7; Emmanuel van Meteren (trans. J. D. L. Haye), Belgica, l'histoire des Pays-Bas d'Emanuel de Meteren (Amsterdam, 1670), 397v. Robert Sidney requested a stay of execution on 5 December. John Wemyss of Logie was beheaded at Middelburg on 8 January 1597 (NS).Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1952), pp. 29-30, 153, 219, 419. Logie's confession was a political embarrassment for James. However, Margaret Winster seems to have remained in Anna of Denmark's household. The exact dates of Margaret Winstar's birth and death are unknown. ==References== ==External links== * Anna of Denmark's letter to the Laird of West Wemyss thanking him for showing hospitality to Margaret Winstar, 9 November 1592. * John Slezer's seventeenth-century view of Dalkeith Palace, image from the National Library of Scotland.

The army built the Laguna Army Airfield landing strip to support Camp Laguna's training activities. The runway was used for small planes, like the L-4 Piper Aircraft so the vast training grounds could be watched from the air. The runway was long enough for large planes to be used in training exercises also. It was one of many Arizona World War II Army Airfields.

Many Italian soldiers who became prisoners of war after the North African campaign turned and supported the United States in the Italian Service Units. These Italian were used at the Yuma Test Branch to help build the test combat bridges from 1944 to 1945. The Yuma Test Branch site was closed in 1949.

Brooks Historical Exhibit) site reads: *Camp Laguna operated from April 1942 to April 1944. It was one of twelve such camps built in the southwestern deserts to train United States troops during World War II. The Desert Training Center, a simulated theater of operations, included portions of Arizona, California and Nevada. The other camps were Young, Coxcomb, Iron Mountain, Ibis, Clipper, Pilot Knob, Bouse, Granite, Horn, Hyder, and Rice. Over one million soldiers from approximately 400 units were trained at the center. These units included 13 infantry divisions, 7 armored divisions and numerous non-divisional units. Camp Laguna was the training site for the 3rd and 9th Armored Divisions, 79th Infantry Divisions, Italian service units and special bridge test section. Erected 1998 by Lost Dutchman Chapter 5917, Ancient and Honorable order of E Clampus Vitus, In cooperation with The United States Army, Yuma Proving Ground. Marker at the Italians at the Yuma Test Branch site reads: * During World War II, the Yuma proving ground of the United States Army Corps of Engineers was known as the Yuma Test Branch, which was used as a floating- bridge test facility. By 1944, more allied troop support was needed to conduct the bridge tests at the Yuma Test Branch. By this time, Italy had surrendered to the United States. A group of Italian prisoners-of-war, who were captured in North Africa, pledged their loyalty and support to the United States. These Italians were then formed into two Italian service units and were stationed at the Yuma Test Branch from 1944 to 1945 to assist in testing floating bridges. In addition to their bridge-building capability, they were talented in fine art, culinary art and stonemasonry. This concrete-lined stone-faced paint shed, decorated with three castles bearing the United States Army Corps of Engineers insignia and one castle inscribed with the word \\"Italy\\" was constructed by them to facilitate the safe storage of paint at the Yuma Test Branch. Because the temperature was cooler underground, the paint was stored below ground under all of the stone decorations, a method which was free of fire hazards. ==See also== * Camp Hyder AZ * Camp Bouse AZ * Camp Coxcomb * Marine Corps Air Station Yuma * Arizona World War II Army Airfields ==Wahner E.

The actor relocated to Melbourne, where the show's studios are located, for the role of progressive high school teacher Finn. Mills began filming his first scenes in early November 2016, and he confirmed that he would be on-screen for around four to five months. He made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 15 March 2017. Finn was introduced as a replacement for fellow teacher Brad Willis (Kip Gamblin) at Erinsborough High. Finn initially had a charismatic, affable, easygoing persona. He schemes to win back his former girlfriend Elly Conway (Jodi Anasta) and become principal of the school, before a brain aneurysm kills him. He manipulates student Xanthe Canning (Lilly Van der Meer) into helping him by using inappropriate flattery. Finn interferes with Susan Kennedy's (Jackie Woodburne) multiple sclerosis medication, resulting in her hospitalisation and his subsequent promotion to principal. However, this soon leads to the character's downfall, and as his crimes are exposed, he tries to flee the country. After attempting to frame Xanthe and surviving a ruptured aneurysm, Finn departed on 29 June 2017. Mills reprised the role for another guest stint in May 2018. Finn returns to Erinsborough with Elly's sister Bea Nilsson (Bonnie Anderson), who believes him to be a disabled man called Patrick, in order to exact his revenge. He uses Bea to frame Elly for a hit-and-run on Xanthe, which he carries out. Finn later corners Susan, Elly, Bea and Xanthe on a cliff edge, and he is pushed over by Susan, resulting in a four month coma. Mills was promoted to the regular cast in March 2019 and Finn was redeemed through an amnesia storyline, which saw him move in with the Kennedys and start a new relationship with Bea. Mills enjoyed playing Finn's vulnerable side and hoped viewers would sympathise with him. Mills finished filming with the show in December 2019, and his final scenes aired on 24 March 2020. For his portrayal of Finn, Mills was longlisted for Best Daytime Star at the 2019 Inside Soap Awards. Finn was named \\"one of the nastiest characters Neighbours has ever seen\\" by Johnathon Hughes of Radio Times. Finn's redemption storyline and promotion to the regular cast has proved divisive among viewers. ==Casting== On 15 November 2016, Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy reported that actor Rob Mills had been cast in the guest role of high school teacher Finn Kelly. Mills began shooting his first scenes during the same week. Of joining the cast, Mills stated: \\"I can't wait to get started on the show. As a youngster, I played baseball just behind where Ramsay Street is located and I thought at the time, how great it would be to be on Neighbours, and now it has happened!\\" He later confirmed that his character's storyline would run for around four to five months. Mills made his first appearance as Finn on 15 March 2017. ==Development== ===Characterisation and introduction=== Finn was introduced as the former boyfriend of Elly Conway, played by Jodi Anasta (pictured), who worries that he will cause trouble for her professionally. Finn is hired by Erinsborough High principal Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) to replace Brad Willis (Kip Gamblin). He is described as being \\"charismatic and affable\\", as well as a \\"progressive and respected school teacher\\". Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy observed Finn was \\"warm, easygoing and friendly\\" upon his arrival. Claire Tonkin of Network Ten stated that Finn \\"brings an unexpected agenda, juicy secrets and oodles of charm.\\" As Finn settles in, it becomes clear that there is more to him \\"than meets the eye\\", and the serial's executive producer, Jason Herbison called him \\"a really intriguing character\\". On-screen it emerges that Finn had a relationship with fellow teacher Elly Conway (Jodi Anasta) when they both lived in Sydney. Anasta said that Elly was in love with Finn, but she was unaware that he was married and lying to her at the time. Anasta called him \\"the ultimate charmer and heartbreaker\\". She also said that Finn is the former boyfriend that Elly attempted to run down in her car, which had been briefly mentioned on-screen before his arrival. Finn's introduction also led to further exploration of Elly's background and behaviour. She is \\"taken aback\\" when she sees him at the school, and viewers are given an insight into the manipulation and embarrassment she suffered while working with Finn in Sydney. Elly worries that Finn is going to cause trouble for her, while Susan is impressed by him. Anasta stated that like Elly, Finn has been through \\"some tough times\\". He has issues, and does not necessary make the right choices, which makes him seem like a bad person, but he is not \\"intrinsically nasty or horrible.\\" He and Elly initially clash over their past history, before she asks him to resign and leave the school, which Finn refuses to do. He later finds her at a local bar and says he wants to make amends, but Elly does not forgive him and they cause a scene. Finn begins tutoring Elly's student Xanthe Canning (Lilly Van der Meer) and shows interest in her cousin Ben Kirk's (Felix Mallard) career plans. While he is talking with Xanthe, Elly confronts him about an online comment regarding the incident at the bar. She pushes him away from her and he falls down some stairs in front of Xanthe. ===Career ambitions and manipulation of Xanthe=== Finn wants to reunite with Elly and take the principal job from Susan. A writer for TV Soap said that relocating to Erinsborough to work at the high school was all part of Finn's plan to win Elly back, after ruining their relationship with his \\"vindictive scheming\\". Having realised that he is in love with Elly, Finn does not want to waste time as he has a brain aneurysm, that could rupture at any moment. He knows that he has the perfect opportunity to fulfil his dream of becoming a school principal, and begins keeping notes on every decision Susan makes. He also convinces Xanthe to be his spy at the school, after she learns about his aneurysm. Finn \\"turns on the charm\\" with Elly and they have sex. Following their night together, Elly avoids Finn and later says that she does not want to be in a relationship with him. Adding to his frustrations, she and Susan find Xanthe a new tutor, as they realise that she has become too involved in his personal life. Finn loses his temper with Elly and receives a warning about his behaviour, leading him to step up his plan to have Susan removed from her job. Finn starts by using his relationship with Elly to undermine Susan's role as principal. Finn also finds an opportunity to continue his manipulation of Xanthe when he finds her organising a picnic at the lake on Mother's Day. He plays on her sympathetic nature by admitting that he finds the day difficult, as his mother is dead. Finn later gifts Xanthe a necklace for her birthday, and allows her to attend a hospital appointment with him. The next step in Finn's plan sees him interfere with Susan's multiple sclerosis (MS) medication, resulting in her hospitalisation and his promotion to acting principal. While shooting the medication swap scene, the director asked Mills to make it clear that Finn did not find his decision easy, showing that he was not all bad and had chosen \\"the darker path\\" as it was the quickest way to achieve his goal. Mills said that Finn has to use Susan's collapse to remind others that she is not fit to run the school, which convinces them that he is the best person for the position. He also explained that he enjoyed being \\"Susan's nemesis\\" and playing out the tension between her and Finn, saying \\"there was no shouting or confrontation, they hate each other but both chose to play the long game.\\" After Xanthe realises that he is behind Susan's condition, Finn uses \\"inappropriate flattery\\" to make sure she keeps quiet. Johnathon Hughes of Radio Times observed that Finn is \\"borderline grooming\\" Xanthe with his manipulative behaviour, and Mills admitted to being worried about how far his character was going to go with her. He said, \\"I spoke to the writers early on and they explained it wasn't going to be that kind of relationship. Xanthe has fallen for Finn, but it's not reciprocated romantically by him at all. She lacks a positive male role model in her life and Finn is the first person in her life who has really nurtured her.\\" He also said that Finn needs Xanthe to keep his aneurysm a secret, and that he genuinely wants her and the other students to do well at school. Mills told Hughes that Finn does worry he has taken things with Xanthe too far. He realises that she has the information to cause his downfall, and he cannot risk her finding out that he has been using her. The actor later said that Finn will go as far as he can with Xanthe without their relationship becoming sexual, as he still loves Elly. However, he will tell Xanthe he loves her if it means she does not become suspicious about his intentions. ===Downfall and departure=== The character's downfall is sparked by student protests at the changes he has made to the school, including a vertical integration teaching scheme. Mills admitted that Finn \\"hasn't put any logistics in place for this system to work\\" and called his character \\"an idiot\\". He explained that Finn just assumed the students and teachers would be ready, which adds to his frustrations because he does not have the time to implement things slowly. Mills commented that it makes Finn's behaviour \\"more maniacal.\\" Piper and Ben later show Finn a petition and Piper films his reaction to send to the local newspaper. Finn then \\"goads\\" Ben over Xanthe's decision to break up with him. Finn's involvement in Susan's hospitalisation is also discovered after Nell Rebecchi (Scarlett Anderson) swallows some of the pills and collapses. Susan's husband Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) notices Susan tested positive for the same painkillers, and gives them to the police. With the medication swap exposed and the police wanting to question him, Finn decides to leave the country. However, Xanthe believes herself to be in love with him and books herself a ticket too, telling Finn that he needs someone to look after him. Mills told Ellis (Inside Soap) that Finn feels he cannot say no in case Xanthe tells everyone the truth about his crimes. He also revealed that they shot the plane scenes out of sequence, after he had only completed a couple of weeks filming. He called it \\"a good acting exercise\\" as he had to really think about the things Finn and Xanthe would go through to get to that point. Finn and Xanthe are found by the police and taken to the station, where Finn is questioned about poisoning Susan and having an inappropriate relationship with Xanthe. Finn tells the police that Xanthe poisoned Susan and frames her with false evidence. When faced with the accusation, Xanthe refuses to believe that Finn would do that to her, and does not cooperate with the police any further. After he is released, Finn goes into hiding. Mills told Soaplife's Alison James that Finn is waiting for \\"the heat to die down\\" over the \\"furore\\" he has caused at the school and with Xanthe. During a showdown with Xanthe, who realises that he has used her, Finn's aneurysm bursts. Mills said it had been just a matter of time before it did, and Finn had been experiencing headaches whenever he became frustrated or angry. Finn falls into a coma and Xanthe calls an ambulance. When he wakes up, he claims to be paralysed and later claims that he was almost smothered by Elly. Mills thought Finn was on a downward spiral and struggling to get out of the mess he has made. The actor told James that Finn becomes \\"a compulsive liar and he turns into something of a psychopath\\". Finn made his exit on 29 June 2017, following a confrontation with Susan, who realises that he is not remorseful. Mills would not rule out a return for his character in the future, saying \\"I'd be up for returning at some point if they'll have me. I want Finn to be redeemed, if that's at all possible...\\" ===Reintroduction=== The character returned alongside new cast member Bonnie Anderson (pictured), who plays Finn's victim and Elly's sister, Bea Nilsson. Mills reprised the role for another guest stint the following year, and Finn returned on 22 May 2018. Mills stated that he was \\"absolutely thrilled\\" when he received a call asking him to return. He praised the writers for the \\"magnificent job\\" they did scripting Finn's return, adding \\"this storyline is testament to just how psychotic Finn really is...\\" Mills said Finn's teaching ambitions had gone, but he still had a \\"desire to be a manipulator.\\" Instead, Finn returns to Erinsborough get his revenge, as he feels he has unfinished business. Mills explained, \\"He's been to prison and served his time and I'd like to say he's rehabilitated, but I really don't think he is. There's great hurt in him. He doesn't like to lose and if anything he's gotten a little worse this time round.\\" Mills confirmed that Finn is still obsessed with Elly, but he holds a grudge against her because his love is unrequited, leading to \\"some psychosis\\". Mills confirmed that Finn would not have much to do with Xanthe this time round, but when he does, his actions would have \\"a big impact\\" on her. He also said that Finn still does not like Susan, and there would be no reconciliation between them. It soon emerges that Finn is dating Elly's younger sister Bea Nilsson (Bonnie Anderson), who was introduced shortly before his return. Mills explained that Bea has been living on the streets and is estranged from her family, following a falling out with her mother. The actor joked, \\"So Finn thought it might be a good idea if they just patched things up, because he's such a good Samaritan!\\" Finn uses the pseudonym \\"Patrick\\", so Bea has no idea who he is really is. Mills told Johnathon Hughes of Radio Times that viewers would be left wondering whether his feelings for her were genuine, pointing out that she looks a lot like Elly, which is easier for his manipulation. He called Bea \\"savvy\\" and \\"resilient\\", and he thought she would be fine despite being around \\"a strong narcissist\\" like Finn. He also mentioned that Bea and Finn have formed \\"a close bond\\". Finn has also convinced Bea that he needs a wheelchair, and tries to avoid her seeing him out of it. He also manages to secure a job at the hospital as Karl Kennedy's assistant on an MS trial, but makes sure that he is not seen by Karl or Susan, who drops by the office to deliver her medical file, which Finn steals. Finn's plan starts to unravel when Bea finds his wheelchair at their apartment and he is nowhere to be found. He tells her that he has been getting some movement back in his legs, but sensing that Bea is sceptical and about to break up with him, Finn proposes and Bea accepts. She then asks him to meet her family, which he initially agrees to, but then cancels at the last moment. Finn tampers with the data from the MS trial, leading to good results that Karl plans to present at a medical conference. However, Finn contacts the hospital's COO Clive Gibbons (Geoff Paine) and tells him the data has been falsified, leading Clive to shut down the trial. Finn's revenge plan is revealed on the day of a local scavenger hunt when he deliberately strikes Xanthe with Elly's car, before kidnapping three of his victims. The storyline also saw the character make a temporary exit from the serial. Finn takes Elly's car and drives it at Xanthe and Chloe Brennan (April Rose Pengilly) at high speed. Xanthe pushes Chloe out of the way, taking the full impact of the car. Van der Meer commented, \\"She sees Finn staring at her behind the wheel, there's a split-second where they lock eyes then she's hit and knocked out.\\" Elly is blamed for the attempt on Xanthe's life, until Xanthe wakes from a coma and reveals that Finn was behind the wheel. Susan and Elly later come face to face with Finn, as they try to track down Bea. He lures them into a shipping container, where he has already put Bea, and locks them all in. He then flees the scene, leaving the women to die. Karl and Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) eventually rescue the women, and Elly is rushed to hospital with dehydration. Bea is left \\"heartbroken that she's been so betrayed\\" by Finn. ===Cliff fall and redemption=== Towards the end of 2018, the character reappears as Bea finds him at a remote cabin in the bush, where he has been hiding since leaving her for dead. Bea has been seeking closure on her relationship with Finn, and is \\"horrified\\" when she comes face to face with him. Mills explained that Finn \\"has had some time out\\", continuing \\"Obviously, you can't lock three people in a shipping container and expect to get away with it! The police are looking for him, so he's been waiting for the heat to subside. Now he's back for revenge!\\" Finn initially tells Bea that he wants to make things right between them and attempts to seduce her. Bea says she never stopped loving him, but Finn is aware that this is a lie. Mills described Finn's behaviour as \\"creepy\\", but said he has genuine feelings for Bea. As Bea strikes Finn and runs from the cabin, she meets Susan, Elly and Xanthe, who have tracked her location. The women are confronted by Finn at the edge of a cliff. Mills likened his character to \\"a kid in a candy store\\", as the women have been very important to him at one time or another. The confrontation ends with Finn being pushed over the cliff and the women agreeing to keep what happened to themselves. The scenes were filmed over a couple of days, and Mills came close to falling from the cliff for real, so the fearful reactions from the actresses was real. A stunt man then came in to shoot Finn's fall. Finn is found and taken to the hospital, where he remains in a coma. Bea, Xanthe, Susan and Elly keep quiet about their involvement, but Elly struggles and Susan starts having visions of Finn. They soon learn that Finn planted canisters of cyanide in the school air vents, after several student and teachers fall ill. This prompts Susan to almost smother Finn at the hospital, and then confess that she was the one who pushed him off the cliff. In March 2019, following scenes in which Finn woke from his coma, the show announced via its social media platforms that Mills had signed a permanent contract, meaning Finn would become a member of the regular cast. Producers plotted a redemption storyline arc for the character, after he is diagnosed with retrograde amnesia. Finn believes the year is 2007 and he is a nineteen year old university student. The producers also chose to introduce returning character Beverly Marshall (Shaunna O'Grady) into the storyline, as she carries out a series of tests and concludes that Finn's amnesia is genuine. Karl offers to help Finn recover his memories, by taking him to familiar places, but his plan fails. Mills told Inside Soap's Alice Penwill: \\"Finn doesn't remember anything. But I suppose that's the best thing for Finn – hopefully now he has the chance to start afresh.\\" Finn later seeks advice from lawyer Imogen Willis (Ariel Kaplan), knowing that if his memories return, he could be going to prison. Mills hoped viewers would believe that Finn has amnesia and might sympathise with him. He called the new Finn \\"a really good guy\\", and added \\"I've had to tap into different emotions to discover these different layers. He isn't one-dimensional, and it's been fun to play his vulnerable side.\\" The attitudes of the character's involved with Finn also begin to change, including Susan, who becomes more empathetic towards him as she spends time at the hospital. Bea plans to tell Finn how much he hurt her, but when she sees him save Imogen and Susan from a speeding car, it causes her to change her mind about him, leaving her conflicted when it comes to his sentencing hearing. Anderson said her character was \\"terrified\\" by Finn, but she has since seen \\"a complete transformation\\" in him. She continued, \\"Seeing him in court really opens up some old wounds for her. She has to relive her ordeal, yet Finn clearly has no recollection of what he did – so it's hard for Bea to hate him...\\" Instead of the expected \\"character assassination\\", Bea's statement to the court is sympathetic towards Finn. At the conclusion of the hearing, Finn is given a non-custodial sentence. Needing somewhere to live, Finn's half-brother Shaun Watkins (Brad Moller) asks the Kennedys to house him and Bea is \\"taken aback\\" when they agree, meaning she has to share a house with her abuser. Her boyfriend Ned Willis (Ben Hall) is also not happy with the arrangement, and later believes he has witnessed Finn intimidating Bea. ===Relationship with Bea=== Bea and Finn's romantic connection was revisited in May 2019, following the break down of Bea and Ned's relationship, due to his involvement in a revenge plan on Finn. Feeling guilty for the part he played in their break up, Finn attempts to get them back together. However, it makes Ned realise that Bea was right to end their relationship. Bea later thanks Finn for trying to help her out. The former couple later come close to kissing, leaving Bea confused and unwilling to talk about it. Finn also struggles and they turn to Karl and Susan for advice. Katie Baillie of Metro noted that Bea seemed \\"horrified\\" that she cares for Finn, and unaware that she never \\"quite buried her feelings\\" for him. Finn is \\"disappointed, but understanding\\" when Bea wants to forget the incident happened. Finn and Bea's feelings for one another are revealed when he deals with an obsessive fan, Alfie Sutton (Harry Borland), who has broken into the house to take a photo with him. Finn reacts violently when Alfie approaches Bea, and pulls him away. Alfie blackmails Finn and Bea into letting him go, knowing that Finn will get into trouble if they go to the police. Finn then explains to Bea that he was \\"overprotective\\" because he is in love with her, and she tells him she feels the same. As they attempt to keep their relationship a secret, Finn and Bea decide to go on a date outside of Erinsborough. Although Bea has a flashback to when she was manipulated by him, the date is a success. But later that day, Ned spots them kissing, putting their secret at risk. Finn and Bea eventually decide to tell their family and friends about their relationship, before they find out some other way. A shocked Karl and Elly urge Bea to break off the relationship, as they think she will get hurt again, but Bea remains committed to Finn. The relationship is tested by the reappearance of Alfie, who breaks into the Kennedy house and steals Finn and Bea's clothes. When Karl and Susan learn of the incident with Alfie and his obsession with Finn, they encourage Finn to go to the police or move out. Finn reports the break in and assault to the police, and is held at the station when Alfie contradicts his statement. After being informed that he will be held on remand, Finn has a panic attack. Lawyer Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) then asks that Finn be placed under house arrest instead. Writers introduced the character's estranged father Trent Kelly (Peter Houghton) in February 2020, leading to further exploration of his fictional backstory. Finn tells Bea and Susan that his father suffered with alcoholism, which \\"turned him into a mess\\" and they started to lose touch, which worsened when Finn went to university. Kilkelly (Digital Spy) explained that Finn feels that does not have closure on his past, so Bea contacts Trent on his behalf and meets him with Elly. They learn a secret about Trent \\"which could devastate Finn\\". The storyline also tests Finn's relationship with Bea again, as he becomes closer to Elly. ===Departure (2020)=== Mills finished filming with the show in December 2019. Of leaving, he commented \\"That was the end of my three years as the character of Finn Kelly. I have a lot of auditions coming up.\\" His character's exit scenes aired on 24 March 2020. Finn drowns in a shallow grave that he has dug for Susan. Although Finn's death is an accident, Elly's suspicious behaviour at the scene leads her to be questioned by the police and later charged. ==Storylines== Finn takes a teaching job at Erinsborough High, alongside his former girlfriend Elly Conway, who asks that he resigns immediately. Elly blames Finn for sabotaging a presentation at the last school they worked at, and for not telling her he was married when they dated. Finn plots to take the principal job from Elly's aunt Susan Kennedy. He also takes over Xanthe Canning's tutoring. Elly believes Finn is behind a critical online post about her, and accidentally pushes him down some stairs during a confrontation. Finn does not pursue legal action against Elly, as he still loves her. They soon get back together. Xanthe discovers that Finn has a brain aneurysm, and he asks that she is his spy at school. Finn keeps notes on Susan's failings, and encourages her grandson to leave school. He applies for the acting assistant principal position. He uses his relationship with Elly to get Susan removed from the interview board, citing a conflict of interest. Elly breaks up with Finn, as she is unable to trust him, and he is asked to stop tutoring Xanthe, but they continue to meet in secret. Finn alters several grades on essays Elly has marked, leading to an investigation. He also swaps Susan's vitamins for Piper Willis's pain medication, which leads to Susan having an MS relapse, and he manipulates Xanthe into keeping quiet it. While Susan is in hospital, Finn becomes acting principal and he attempts to force Elly out, after learning she spoke to his wife, Miranda Kelly (Dajana Cahill). His new teaching scheme is disliked by the teachers and students, who start a protest. The medication swap is also discovered, so Finn flees town and boards a plane to Hong Kong. Xanthe follows him, but they are soon brought back by federal police. Finn then frames Xanthe for the medication swap. She later meets with him and secretly records a confession. Finn's aneurysm haemorrhages and he undergoes surgery. He claims he is paralysed when he wakes up, and later accuses Elly of trying to smother him. Finn is found to be faking his paralysis and he confesses to his crimes. He is visited by Elly, Xanthe and Susan, who realises that he is not truly remorseful for his actions. Finn is then transferred to a prison hospital. Finn returns to Erinsborough with his girlfriend and Elly's younger sister, Bea Nilsson. Bea knows Finn as Patrick and believes he is confined to a wheelchair, after he saved her from being harassed by a group of men, who then assaulted him. Finn convinces Bea to spend time with her estranged family and befriend Xanthe. He also encourages her to accept a job at the local garage, which he later accesses to sabotages some invoices, so she gets into trouble with her boss. Finn berates Bea for talking to her family about him, but he gifts her a dress similar to one owned by Elly as an apology. Finn gains access to Susan's medical file after becoming an intern for an MS trial at the hospital run by Karl Kennedy. When Bea comes home early and finds Finn's empty wheelchair, she calls him in a panic and he tells her that he has been regaining movement in his legs, but fell when he went out. Sensing Bea is sceptical, Finn proposes to her and Bea accepts on the condition that he meets her family. However, Finn pulls out of the gathering at the last minute. Finn gifts Bea's family a tea chest, in which he has placed a hidden camera. Finn alters the data in the MS trial leading to false positive results. He contacts the hospital's COO, who shuts down the trial. Finn acquires the clues for a local scavenger hunt he knows Xanthe is taking part in. He see what Elly is wearing that day and provides Bea with an identical outfit, before suggesting they enter the scavenger hunt. Finn makes sure Bea is seen on CCTV cameras around town, before claiming he needs to return to the apartment as he is in pain. He later goes out and lures Elly to a national park using Bea's phone, so he can steal her car. He locates Xanthe and hits her at full speed with the car. Finn and Bea drive to Maryborough to get married, but Bea starts to become suspicious and pulls the car over. She gets out and Finn chases after her, revealing that he never needed the wheelchair. Susan and Elly later locate Bea's car and come face to face with Finn, who locks them in a shipping container with Bea. The women are eventually rescued, and Finn is believed to have fled the country. While on the run, Finn is assisted by Harry Sinclair (Paul Dawber), a principal from a school he previously taught at, and whose feelings he is manipulating. Months later, Bea finds Finn at a cabin in the bush, and he taunts her with her stolen therapist's file. Finn chases Bea through the bush and finds her with Elly, Susan and Xanthe at the edge of a cliff. Susan pushes Finn over the edge in self defence. He is later found and taken to the hospital, where he remains in a coma. Weeks later, several students and teachers fall ill from hydrogen cyanide poisoning, and it emerges that Finn placed canisters of cyanide in the air vents to kill those attending the school's graduation ceremony. Finn wakes from his coma with amnesia; he believes he is 19 and about to take his teaching exams. Finn receives several visitors, including Susan, Bea and his half-brother Shaun Watkins (Brad Moller). Karl suspects Finn is faking the amnesia and tells him about his crimes. Finn attempts to flee the hospital, but he collapses in the car park. Finn's mother Claudia Watkins (Kate Raison) reluctantly visits him, and suggests that he severs ties with Shaun. She later offers to pay his legal fees and keeps a photo of him from an album he made her. All of the physical evidence in Finn's case is destroyed in a fire, so Shaun tries to convince him to change his plea, but his lawyer Imogen Willis refuses to represent him at his sentencing hearing if he does. Finn saves Susan and Imogen from being hit by a speeding car, and Miranda is the prime suspect because Finn rejected her. Both Susan and Bea change their statements at the hearing, as they believe Finn is no longer the same man who hurt them. Elly also gives a less damning statement, which results in Finn receiving a non-custodial sentence. Elly suggests that the Kennedys house Finn, and they agree, despite the tension it causes with the neighbours. Finn becomes the subject of a case study for David Tanaka (Takaya Honda). He and Karl also deliver some home grown fruit to the neighbours, but razorblades are found inside and Finn is blamed. He later makes an anonymous donation to the Sonya Foundation. Finn realises his presence is causing problems for the Kennedys and he decides to leave town, but Bea finds and convinces him to return. Finn deduces that Elly is pregnant with Shaun's child and that she is being blackmailed by Dean Mahoney (Henry Strand). He pays Dean to change schools and tells Elly he will support her, as she keeps the truth from her husband, Mark Brennan. Finn is accused of planting cyanide canisters at the community centre during the Sonya Foundation launch, however, Ned Willis comes forward and reveals that Harry is responsible. Harry was also behind the attempted hit- and-run and the razorblades in the fruit. When Finn sees Harry, he suddenly remembers who he is and fears that his memories are returning. Harry eventually tells Finn that the memory he has is of their first meeting when Finn was an 18 year old student. Finn encourages Elly to tell Mark the truth about the baby, as it is causing her stress. Bea and Finn grow closer and almost kiss. Finn begins teaching adult education classes at the Sonya Foundation. Finn rescues Bea from intruder Alfie Sutton, who threatens to tell the police that Finn was violent with him. Finn admits that he was protective of Bea because he loves her. She admits that she is falling for him too and they start dating in secret, until Ned catches them kissing on the way back from a date. They decide to tell Bea's family, who worry that she will get hurt again. Finn develops anxiety after Bea recalls a memory of Patrick, and he struggles to move their relationship forward. Bea comes up with a striptease game and they consummate their relationship. Alfie breaks into the house again and steals clothes. Finn and Bea tell Karl and Susan about Alfie and they ask Finn to go to the police if he wants to continue staying with them. Finn is kept overnight at the station, while the police speak to Alfie. When Alfie's statement says Finn punched him, Finn has to go to a remand centre and he suffers a panic attack. Toadie convinces the DPP to place Finn under house arrest instead. The DPP later determine Alfie's assault claim is false. Finn becomes concerned about how much Elly is talking to Shaun about the baby, and her relationship with Chloe Brennan (April Rose Pengilly). Finn calls Shaun when he falls out with David and Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson) over their involvement in Elly's pregnancy. Shaun comes to Erinsborough to pull Finn into line. He apologises to David and Aaron, and the four take a baby swaddling class together. Shaun and Finn come up with an idea for the Foundation that pairs disadvantaged children with mentors. They present their idea to Toadie, who informs them that Finn will not receive police clearance to work with children due to his past. Shaun returns to Switzerland and Finn later learns that he is missing presumed dead after being struck by an avalanche. Bea helps him and Elly grieve by arranging a memorial in the park. Finn violates his parole when he steps onto school grounds to give Elly some pain medication. He startles student Olivia Lane (Grace O'Sullivan), who goes missing shortly after, forcing him to confess to the police and costing Elly her job. Finn bonds with Elly over the baby and offers her financial help. He finds a photo album of pictures from when they dated and keeps it, leading Susan to confront him about his feelings for Elly. Claudia returns to Erinsborough under the pretence of wanting to see him and bond with Elly, but Finn discovers that she hired a private investigator to dig up dirt on Elly's past. She asks him to watch Elly and report back to her, but Finn refuses. Claudia reveals to Finn that she was behind the fire that destroyed the evidence in his case, and then informs Bea of Finn's growing feelings towards Elly. Bea confronts Finn and Elly, who assure her that there is nothing between them. Finn helps deliver Elly's daughter Aster Conway (Isla Goulas; Scout Bowman) while they are being held hostage by Robert Robinson (Adam Hunter). Susan later catches the two having a moment and confronts them, reminding them that Bea can not be hurt. Elly moves into Number 32, but she asks for Finn's help when she has difficulties settling Aster. Wanting to prove how much he loves Bea, Finn proposes to her, but she turns him down. Finn explains that he wanted Bea to feel loved and it strengthens their relationship. Finn tutors Harlow Robinson (Jemma Donovan) in psychology, which raises the subject of his father, an alcoholic from whom he is estranged. Bea contacts Finn's father Trent Kelly (Peter Houghton), and she and Elly meet with him. They tell Finn that Trent lost the ransom money that would have led to his release from the Colombian kidnappers. Finn distances himself from Bea and relies on Elly's support, culminating in a kiss, which triggers some of Finn's memories to return. As the rest of his memories come back, Finn makes a video diary to help him cope. He struggles with his anger after becoming embroiled in a feud with Lucy Robinson (Melissa Bell), who bans him from attending Lassiters' events. Finn is invited to Elly's 35th birthday party on Pierce Greyson's (Tim Robards) island, after Toadie agrees to act as his guardian. Prior to leaving, he visits Harry Sinclair in prison to ask about a storage locker they owned. He also meets with Trent and attacks him, having remembered that Trent actually gambled the ransom money away. Finn declares his love for Elly and informs her of his intent to break up with Bea after returning. He returns to the storage locker and finds a map for the island, where he plans to kill Bea. When Lucy spots Finn at the Lassiters Wedding Expo, she asks him to leave and insults him. He then makes a bomb and places it inside a box containing Lucy's honeymoon destination, which will be opened after her wedding. Lucy switches the boxes, and the bomb instead kills Harlow's mother, Prue Wallace (Denise van Outen). After arriving on the island, Finn takes Bea on a hike and pushes her down an old mineshaft, causing her to break her leg. Finn tells Elly that he broke up with Bea and she left for Sydney. Harry arrives on the island after being paroled and tells Finn that he filmed him pushing Bea down the mine. Finn seduces Harry to keep him on side and asks that he finds them somewhere to hide once he is done on the island. Toadie finds the dinghy that Bea supposedly took off the island, so Finn hits him with a rock, places him in the dingy, punctures the bottom of it and pushes it into the sea. Discovering that Bea is still alive and Harlow is now trapped with her, Finn places a deadly snake in the mine, which bites Harlow. When Gary Canning (Damien Richardson) tries to rescue them, Finn shoots and kills him with an arrow. Elly discovers Bea's and Toadie's phones in Finn's possession and flees with Aster, discovering Gary's body. Finn finds them, kidnaps Aster, and leaves the island after setting it on fire, returning to Erinsborough, where he lies to Susan that Bea is at a cabin in the woods and convinces her to help him persuade her to come home. However he soon admits his memories have returned and tells Susan he wants them to start a new life together, as she has cared for him more than anyone else. When Susan tries to call the police, Finn ties her up and digs a grave for her in the woods, but slips climbing out and hits his head on a rock, paralysing him. The water he used to soften the ground then fills the grave, drowning him. After finding and rescuing Susan and Aster, Elly finds Finn's body and attempts to bury him when the police arrive. She is charged with his murder, which is later downgraded to voluntary manslaughter. ==Reception== For his portrayal of Finn, Mills was longlisted for Best Daytime Star at the 2019 Inside Soap Awards. Of Mills' acting skills in the role, Bridget McManus of The Sydney Morning Herald observed: \\"As , the new bespectacled teacher with wild ideas about bringing mindfulness into the classroom, Mills is no better or worse than any of his colleagues. He appears to have already mastered the skill of conducting outwardly jovial yet inwardly fraught exchanges from a cafe chair.\\" In his assessment of the character, Johnathon Hughes of Radio Times found that \\"on the surface, handsome Finn is charming, charismatic and an excellent addition to the school\\". He went onto name Finn as \\"one of the nastiest characters Neighbours has ever seen\\" for his scheming and grooming of Xanthe. He also thought Finn's obsession with Elly added \\"more menace to his wicked agenda\\", and branded him a \\"toxic teacher\\". Hughes added, \\"We're not used to this level of evil in sunny Erinsborough\\". Hughes later called Finn a \\"psychotic villain\\", \\"power-mad\\" and an \\"arch-manipulator\\". Alison James of Soaplife dubbed Finn \\"too power-mad for his own good\\". Mills found himself being verbally abused in the street for his portrayal of the character. McManus (The Sydney Morning Herald) thought that more time should have been spent on Finn's reintroduction storyline, saying \\"there's a sense that Rob Mills' storyline as wicked Finn, which tonight takes a dramatic turn in the bush, deserved a bit more time. Instead, some reckless decisions are made without due attention to detail or diction.\\" A reporter for the South Wales Echo observed that \\"Finn seems to be a magnet for problems\\" since his return. Similarly, Radio Times' Simon Timblick opined \\"after all the terrible things Finn Kelly (played by Rob Mills) has done in Neighbours, you'd think he’d be thrown in prison for a ker-zillion years.\\" However, Charlie Milward of the Daily Express said the redeemed Finn \\"has proven to be a reputable young man\\", whose \\"charismatic ways\\" made Bea fall for him again. The character's redemption arc and promotion to the regular cast was polarising among viewers. Digital Spy's Conor McMullan defended the storyline and implored viewers to give it a chance. He believed that the \\"numerous contrivances\\" to help Finn avoid prison was the problem for many viewers, who thought their \\"suspension of disbelief is being pushed too far.\\" But McMullan said while the plot was not perfect, the conflicts were \\"fresh ground\\" for the show, while \\"the moral grey area that the story has been exploring is an interesting one – and certainly caused a lot of conversation.\\" McMullan liked that Mills had the opportunity to show \\"a new side\\" to Finn and found himself feeling sorry for him. He concluded that the character's amnesia had potential for several future storylines, adding \\"Could he end up being one of the finest residents Ramsay Street has ever seen or will we find out that a leopard can't change their spots? Finn winning everyone around, just as he turns to the dark side again, is a thrilling thought for the future...\\" The changes to Finn's persona led McManus (The Sydney Morning Herald) to observe that \\"bad boy Finn has turned everyday hero\\". She also wrote, \\"If only people did 360 degree personality turns the way they do on Neighbours, the world would be a more cohesive place.\\" ==References== Category:Neighbours characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2017 Category:Fictional schoolteachers Category:Male villains Category:Fictional characters with amnesia Category:Crossover characters in television Category:Male characters in television Category:Fictional murderers ","title":"Finn Kelly"},{"id":"61701252","text":"is a Japanese skier.

In Venice, she was expelled from a female college. She remained in Venice under the auspices of the Zenobio counts, on whose behalf her family worked. In this period, she became fond of poetry, beginning to compose sonnets and other rhymes, which she collected under the name of Aglaia Anassillide (or Aglaja Anassillide), taken from the Arcadian tradition.

Although unsuccessful, she was the first woman in Albany county to seek elective office, attempting to represent the county in the New York State Assembly. Later, she was in charge of the Vital Statistics of the Albany Health Department under Mayor William Stormont Hackett. In March 1925, Gov. Al Smith appointed her to the State Motion Picture Censorship Commission, which led to a controversy between the \\"Governor and Republican leaders which ended when her appointed was finally accepted after the Governor had written a sharp message to the Senate charging a violation of constitutional principles in blocking the appointment.\\" In 1927, then Secretary of State Robert Moses appointed her as chief clerk and Second Deputy Secretary of State of New York. After her death, Smith appointed Susan V. Ord of Albany to succeed her. A prominent Democrat, she also served as vice-chairman of the Albany County Democratic organization. In 1920, she attended the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, California. According to a May 1920 profile: > \\"A real asset of the woman political boss is the exact knowledge of her > constituency.

Tilda Cobham-Hervey stars as Reddy alongside Evan Peters, as her manager husband Jeff Wald, and Danielle Macdonald as rock writer Lilian Roxon. == Plot == The film opens with Reddy, aged 24, arriving in New York in 1966 with her three- year-old daughter, a suitcase and just . Within five years she had become one of the biggest superstars of her time, with eight number one US singles, her own hourly TV show and an icon of the 1970s feminist movement, which adopted her power anthem. The film follows her troubled relationships with Roxon, author of the influential Lillian Roxon's Rock Encyclopedia, and husband/manager Wald, who also managed such artists as Sylvester Stallone, Donna Summer, Deep Purple and Tiny Tim. == Cast == * Tilda Cobham-Hervey as Helen Reddy * Danielle Macdonald as Lilian Roxon * Evan Peters as Jeff Wald * Matty Cardarople as Roy Meyer * Rita Rani Ahuja as Maree Alvarez * Molly Broadstock as Traci * Chelsea Cullen as the singing voice of Helen Reddy * Chris Parnell as Artie Mogull * Lily Donat, Reddy's granddaughter, as a nightclub singer == Production == Reddy lived in a care facility in LA before her death one month after the film's Australian release, and her family advised the filmmakers on the project. Moon said she felt great responsibility to Helen to ensure the story was told sensitively: \\"Before we locked the movie off, Producer Rosemary Blight (Goalpost Pictures) and I felt very strongly that we needed to show the movie to Helen and her family. We did a screening for Helen, her ex-husband Jeff Wald, and her two children. As a filmmaker, sitting in the cinema with Helen Reddy was, and it’s probably going to be, one of the hardest screenings I had to do for the film. I suddenly realised that this is her life and she was watching it through my eyes. During the screening, Helen sang along to her songs, and when she cried, it wasn’t because she was sad that we made the movie, she cried because she found the whole experience so touching, and I think really cathartic in a way.\\" Screen Australia is the principal investor in the film, alongside Cowlick Entertainment, and arts body Create NSW, with further funding from the Goodship Women's Fund, which supports films with strong social change messaging. ==Release == The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on 5 September 2019. It was shown at the 24th Busan International Film Festival in Busan, South Korea, in October 2019. The film was chosen to open the 10th annual Athena Film Festival at Barnard College of Columbia University in New York, which celebrates women, on 27 February 2020. It was reported on 31 March 2020 (before the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic was known) that I Am Woman was scheduled for release in Australia by Transmission Films, in North America through Aqute Media, and elsewhere by Metropolitan (France), Nos (Portugal), Inopia (Spain), Videovision (South Africa), Front Row (Middle East), Bliss Media (China), Scene & Sound (South Korea), Ale Kino+ (Poland), VTI (former Yugoslavia), Cineplex (Taiwan), Golden A Entertainment (Thailand) and Cinesky (airlines).

The site's critics consensus reads: \\"I Am Woman sticks disappointingly close to standard biopic formula, but Tilda Cobham-Hervey's performance keeps this affectionate, watchable tribute from falling flat.\\" Indiewire declared the film “a cut above other genre entries”, while David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter described it as “entertaining and sharply packaged” with “considerable appeal”. He said of Cobham-Hervey's performance: \\"The crucial thing is that you really root for Helen — to make it in the first place and then to make it through a nightmarish marriage and come out unbroken. The luminous Cobham-Hervey has you in the corner of this smart, pragmatic, quietly driven woman all the way.\\" Toronto movie review site That Shelf called it a “sure fire crowd pleaser”.

Sebastian served in the fort of Koprivnica (Kapronca) in Slavonia in the summer of 1272, when Stephen's son and heir, the 10-year-old Ladislaus was abducted and imprisoned there by the lord of the castle, Joachim Gutkeled. King Ladislaus' charter from 1274 (under the influence of Joachim and his allies), euphemistically and falsely narrates that Sebastian \\"served faithfully [...] in the castle of Koprivnica, where we retreated before [the wrath of] our dearest father [Stephen V]\\". During the Bohemian invasion of Northwest Hungary in the spring of 1273, Sebastian bravely fought at the forts of Győr in August and Detrekő (today near Plavecké Podhradie, Slovakia) in October. Sebastian elevated into the position of ispán of Torna County by August 1274. The last known predecessor was Buzád, who held the dignity in February 1272. For his military service and loyalty, Sebastian was granted a portion from Homokterenye in Nógrád County on 21 August 1274 by Ladislaus IV. The acquired land adjacent to Sebastian's estate there, previously belonged to the privilege property of the royal falconers and hunters (\\"darócs\\"). One day later, Sebastian obtained the estate of Nyilas in Torna County (today a waste near Lak) from the Hungarian monarch. Sebastian held his dignity until early 1277 at the latest, as Stephen, son of Tekesh was styled as \\"perpetual count\\" of Torna County in that year. The Tekesh sons were granted the whole county and its castle, Szádvár around that time. Sebastian died sometime before 1288, as the estate of Nyilas was already owned by a certain Dominic, son of Wulch in that year. His another village, Homokterenye also had different owners, the grandsons of Lawrence Baksa by 1296. == References == == Sources == * * - Category:13th-century Hungarian people Category:Medieval Hungarian soldiers ","title":"Sebastian, son of Bensa"},{"id":"61702135","text":"alt= \\"'Hope' is the thing with feathers\\" is a lyric poem in ballad meter written by American poet Emily Dickinson, The manuscript of this poem appears in Fascicle 13, which Dickinson compiled around 1861. It is one of 19 poems included in the collection, in addition to the poem \\"There's a certain Slant of light.\\" With the discovery of Fascicle 13 after Dickinson's death by her sister, Lavinia Dickinson, \\"'Hope' is the thing with feathers\\" was subsequently published in 1891 in a collection of her works under the title Poems, which was edited and published by Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd. == History of publication == \\"'Hope' is the thing with feathers\\" was first compiled in one of Dickinson's hand-sewn fascicles, which was written during and put together in 1861. In the 1999 edition of The Poems of Emily Dickinson: Reading Edition, R.W. Franklin changed the year of appearance from 1861, where the holograph manuscript exists, to 1862. It is listed in the appendix that poems numbered 272 to 498 were written during this year, which amounted to the third most poems Dickinson wrote in the span of years from 1860–1865, at 227. The edition that Dickinson included in the fascicle was text B, according to Franklin. No current holograph manuscript exists of the first written version of this selection. \\"'Hope' is the thing with feathers\\" first appeared in print in a second series of her poetry, titled Poems by Emily Dickinson, second series in 1891. It was published out of Boston. Upon the original publication, her poems were reassessed and transcribed by Thomas H. Jefferson in 1955. They became the first scholarly collection of Dickinson's work. His transcription of her works from her fascicles was taken from the earliest fair copy of her poetic works. Within the Johnson collection, \\"'Hope' is the thing with feathers\\" is poem number 254. Franklin, in his edition of her works, used the last fair copy of her poems. It is marked as number 314 in his collection and can be found under such in the Norton Anthology of Poetry. === Fascicle 13 === Fascicle 13 is the bound edition of her written poetry that contains \\"'Hope' is the thing with feathers\\" written in Dickinson's hand. According to the work done by Franklin, there are similarities in the materials used for this fascicle and with Fascicles 11–13, 14, as well as Fascicles 9,11, and 12. Some distinct markers of Fascicle 13 include a woven-style of stationary, with paper that is cream in appearance with a blue rule line on it. It also is decorated in an embossed style that frames the page with \\"a queen's head above the letter 'L'.\\" To view the holograph manuscript of this in person, the Houghton Library at Harvard University houses it. == Analysis == In her analysis of the poem, scholar Helen Vendler, states that the opening foot of the poem is \\"reversed,\\" adding more color and emphasis on the word \\"Hope.\\" Dickinson implements the use of iambic meter for the duration of the poem to replicate that continuation of \\"Hope's song through time.\\" Most of Dickinson's poetry contains quatrains and runs in a hymnal meter, which maintains the rhythm of alternating between four beats and three beats during each stanza. \\"'Hope' is the thing with feathers\\" is broken into three stanzas, each set alternating containing alternating lines of iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter, totaling in twelves lines altogether. In addition, despite Mr. Lin's theorizing, it is not actually about a bird. === Form === In Victoria N. Morgan's text, Emily Dickinson and Hymnal Culture: Tradition and Experience, she writes that Dickinson's poetry may have been influenced by eighteenth- century hymn culture, such as Isaac Watts, and female hymnal writers, Phoebe Hinsdale Brown and Eliza Lee Follen. Morgan postulates that their works were introduced to Dickinson early in her life when she was attending church regularly. She believes that the \\"simplicity\\" of the hymnal form allowed room for Dickinson to make this \\"an easy target for parody.\\" === Theme of poem === The poem calls upon the imagery of seafaring adventures with the use of the word \\"Sea\\" and \\"Gale.\\" Dickinson uses the metaphor of \\"Hope\\" being likened unto a bird that does not disappear when it encounters hardships or \\"storms.\\" Vendler writes that Dickinson enjoys \\"the stimulus of teasing riddles,\\" which is in use as she plays with the idea of \\"Hope\\" being a bird. Dickinson makes an allusion to \\"Hope\\" being something that does not disappear when the \\"Gale\\" and \\"storm\\" get worse and its song still sings on despite the intensity of whatever is attempting to unseat it. She also makes note that no matter what the speaker of the poem is doing, \\"Hope\\" does not leave even if they offer nothing in return to it. === Punctuation === Throughout the poem, Dickinson uses dashes liberally, ending nine lines out of twelve with them. In addition to the use of dashes, she employs capitalization of common nouns, such as \\"Hope,\\" \\"Bird,\\" and \\"Extremity.\\" Scholar Ena Jung writes that Dickinson's dashes are among the most \\"widely contested diacriticals\\" in contemporary literary discussions. John Lennard, in his Poetry Handbook, states that Dickinson's poems rely heavily her use of dashes, capitalizations of particular words and her line/stanza breaks, with \\"'Hope' is the thing with feathers\\" falling into that categorization. He continues on stating that her \\"intense, [and] unexpected play\\" with her use of capitalization and dashes makes her poetry \\"memorable.\\" When reading the poem aloud, the dashes create caesura, causing the brief poem to be read in a staccato'd rhythm. Jung claims that the use of Dickinson's dashes in her poetry creates a \\"visible breath\\" to the speaker that is delivering the poetry. === Symbolism === In her poem, Dickinson describes \\"hope\\" as a bird, which is being used as a metaphor for the idea of salvation. Dickinson has nine variations of the word \\"hope,\\" which can be interpreted in multiple ways. Morgan writes that Dickinson often writes about birds when she is describing acts of worship, which coincides with the format of the hymn. Birds in Christian iconography are often represented as a dove. Dickinson uses many illusions to nature in her poems. Within this poem, she takes the image of the bird and the violence of weather to create a balance between the destructive and the beneficent. It is also a juxtaposition of the interior world and exterior, with the soul considered \\"interior\\" and the storms that attempt to dismantle hope being the \\"exterior.\\" Due to the riddle-like nature of her poems, as well as the extensive use of her lexicon, \\"'Hope' is the thing with feathers\\" can be interpreted through multiple shades of meaning. == Critical reception == Dickinson's poems are lauded as mysterious and enigmatic and typically have a volta, or turn in topic, at the end, such as \\"Because I could not stop for Death.\\" \\"'Hope' is the thing with feathers,\\" while possessing a similar quality, is considered \\"childlike\\" by some critics due to the simplicity of the work. Vendler expands on this idea by stating it is also due to the way that Dickinson constructs her poems in quatrains and hymnal meter, which can be seen as simplistic. Morgan argues that because of Dickinson's \\"antagonistic relation\\" she has with nineteenth- century Christianity, the poet gives a \\"reassessment of spirituality\\" through this poem by the use of the image of the bird and the Christian conception of \\"hope.\\" == Derivative works == \\"'Hope' is the thing with feathers\\" has been adapted to music to be performed by choirs. There are multiple versions of the song. Most notable of the adaptations is the Susan LaBarr version that was written for women's choir and intended to be accompanied by piano. Additional musical adaptations of the poem are also done by Robert Sieving and Emma Lou Diemer. Alternative country band, Trailer Bride, titled their final album, Hope Is a Thing with Feathers. The title of the album is a variant of the name of the poem. The title track of the album is an adaptation of the poem written by Dickinson, where she receives a writing credit. == Citations == == External links == *\\"'Hope' is the thing with feathers\\"at the Poetry Foundation website *Michigan State University's Children's Choir performing \\"'Hope' is the thing with feathers *Trailer Bride's \\"Hope is a Thing with Feathers Category: Poetry by Emily Dickinson Category: Poems published posthumously Category:1891 poems Category:1861 poems Category: Works about emotions ","title":"&quot;Hope&quot; is the thing with feathers"},{"id":"61702148","text":"Weiss is an unincorporated community in Livingston Parish, Louisiana, United States.

Her father was in his seventies when she was born, and had been a wine merchant. She had one brother and sister and felt herself intellectually inferior as she had only learned cookery and art. She was sent to London to do social work by her parents. Walton first joined the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies around 1908. She became honorary secretary of the militant Women's Social and Political Union there. Walton was arrested on 21 November 1911 for her participation in the protest a proposed a franchise bill that would continue to exclude women. She served one week in Holloway Prison. alt= Walton was arrested again in 1912, for causing malicious damage at a Women's Social and Political Union window-smashing campaign in Oxford Street including at Marshall & Snelgrove premises with Eileen Casey. She was imprisoned in Aylesbury Prison where she was force-fed while participating in a hunger strike. At one point Walton said she heard outside the prison a band playing \\"The March of the Women\\" and flag waving 'people and our colours and they cheer and bravo us. It has all been grand but oh what a longing it gives one to be away from this place.' The hunger strikers were to be force fed three times a day and Walton had 'fine tussles before they get us tied into the chair\\". On other days the suffrage prisoners played games together to keep their spirits up like obstacle races, golf with sticks and stones, tennis with stone and dustbin lid using a prison bench as a net, although Walton's legs were 'very thin and shaky'. The women could reduce their sentence by working on making aprons, and the governor William Winder, ignored the suffragette slogans they embroidered 'Deeds not Words' and 'Dare to be Free' though they were made to unpick them before leaving gaol. Walton was given a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' by WSPU. Walton was arrested a third time in 1914 in Dundee, Scotland, for throwing a ball through the window of King George and Queen Mary's carriage. No charges were filed. In 1914, at the beginning of World War I Walton joined the Women Police Volunteers In 1920 she joined the Women's Auxiliary Service of the Royal Irish Constabulary. She became a hospital almoner after she was injured in a motorcycle accident. ==Personal life== Walton was estranged from her family due to her involvement in militant suffrage activities. Her personal style included wearing her hair short and dressing in suit and tie. She never married. She adopted an orphan girl and named her Christabel. She was a vegetarian and Labour voter. She supported the miners actions in the 1920s.

They were intended to decorated the seat-backs in its audience hall on piazza della Signoria. Charity was the first to be delivered in December 1469. The commission was temporarily transferred to Botticelli, probably after a delay by Pollaiolo. Botticelli produced Fortitude before loud protests from Pollaiolo and his brother Antonio that a second contract returned it to Piero and his studio produced the remaining six works in the series. In completing it, it is unclear how much of a contribution Antonio made to Piero's work and some art historians have attributed it instead entirely to Antonio. Billi, Albertini and Cruttwell argue from documents that the whole cycle was by Piero, whereas Ullman and others attribute all six works to Antonio based on stylistic comparisons with the few signed works by Antonio, including prints. Yet others attribute the composition of the work to Antonio but the paintings themselves to Piero. Gloria Fossi, Uffizi, Giunti, Firenze 2004. After the magistracy moved into the Uffizi, the paintings were exhibited in the gallery from 1717 onwards after the Tribunale was suppressed. In the 19th century the works were in such a poor state of conservation that only Prudence was exhibited. Faith was restored in 1999, revealing the painter's techniques, such as painting directly onto the panel without preparation in canvas and plaster and thus exploiting the panel's dark colour for dark parts of the modelling.

She is Professor of Justice Studies and Social Inquiry at Arizona State University, with affiliations in African and African American Studies, Women and Gender Studies, and Asian Pacific American Studies. Before her arrival at ASU in 1995, she taught at University of Oregon, San Francisco State University, and University of Wisconsin-Parkside. Professor Romero holds a bachelor's degree in sociology with a minor in Spanish from Regis College in Denver, Colorado. She holds a PhD in sociology from the University of Colorado. In 2019, she served as the 110th President of the American Sociological Association. Romero has received numerous honors and awards for her creative and scholarly works and her commitment to social justice and activism. She is a former Carnegie Scholar, she was awarded the Lee Founders Award (2004) from the Society for the Study of Social Problems in recognition of her scholarship and social justice activism. In 2009, she received the Founders Award from the American Sociological Association's Section on Racial and Ethnic Minorities. In 2012, she was awarded the Julian Samora Distinguished Career Award from the American Sociological Association's Section on Latina/o Sociology. Using an intersectional lens and feminist legal framework, much of her research program centers on the study of reproductive labor, care-giving, and social inequality in the United States and abroad. More recently, her research has focused on questions of anti-immigrant sentiment and the rise of nationalism and racism against immigrants in the United States, rooted in structural oppression across race, gender, and citizenship. == Early life == Romero was born on November 12, 1952 in Denver, Colorado, United States. She traces her ancestry to a Mestizo Mulatto indigenous Mexican-origin population who first arrived in New Mexico in the 1600s. Her parents were among the first to leave Mora County in Northern New Mexico. Following WWII, they moved to Denver, Colorado for the promise of work in new factories. Romerois a middle child of six children. Her mother worked as a domestic, cleaning houses, while her father worked at the Gates Rubber factory. Romero was the first child in her family born in a hospital, the first child to speak English as her first language, and was the first child in her family to attend college. == Education == Romero attended an integrated parochial high school in an effort to avoid the highly segregated Denver public school system; in 1973, Keyes v. School District No. 1, Denver argued that de facto segregation existed. Romero graduated high school in 1970. She began college at the University of Colorado at Denver and soon transferred to Regis University, a private Jesuit college in Denver. During college, Romero worked in the department of sociology part-time as an administrative assistant. Taking advice from faculty members there, many of whom were completing their PhD's at the University of Colorado, Boulder, she applied to their PhD program and was admitted. During graduate school, Romero worked as an English as a Second Language (ESL) and adult general education teacher for the St. Vrain Valley School District, and also ran a youth employment program in Lafayette, Colorado. During her time in Lafayette, she worked with a community group that set up the first bilingual education program in the local school district. Romero met her partner, Eric Margolis, during graduate school. They married in 1985. After graduate school in 1980, Romero worked for one year as a lecturer at the University of Texas, El Paso. She accepted a tenure-track position at the University of Wisconsin, Parkside, where she was an assistant professor. After four years, she left UW-Parkside to take the position of assistant dean at Yale College, where she also lectured in the Women's Studies and Sociology departments from 1985-1999. In 1989, after a two-year Presidential Fellowship at the University of California, she accepted the position of Associate Professor and Department Chair of La Raza Studies at San Francisco State University. She went on to work at the University of Oregon, with visiting professorships at Macalester and Colgate. In 1995, she was appointed Professor of Chicana and Chicano Studies (now in the School of Transborder Studies) at Arizona State, and in 1997 moved her position to the School of Social Transformation, where she has worked until the present. == Creative and scholarly works == === Books === Romero's contributions to the sociological canon began with Maid in the U.S.A., but since the publication of that work she has continued a prolific scholarly career. She is the author of Introducing Intersectionality (Polity, 2017), and the award-winning book, The Maid's Daughter, the 2012 Americo Paredes Book Award Winner and 2012 Outstanding Title by AAUP University Press Books. She is the co-editor of Intersectionality and Entrepreneurship (Routledge 2019), Blackwell Companion to Social Inequalities (Blackwell 2005), Latino/a Popular Culture (NYU Press 2002), Women’s Untold Stories: Breaking Silence, Talking Back, Voicing Complexity (Routledge, 1999), [ Challenging Fronteras: Structuring Latina and Latina Lives in the U.S. (Routledge, 1997), and Women and Work: Exploring Race, Ethnicity and Class (Sage, 1997).She has also published dozens of peer-reviewed articles in social science journals and law reviews.

Her work was instrumental in the development of the Kashmir Mission Hospital in Srinagar. She was the hospital's first Superintendent of Nursing and led education and cleanliness initiatives. Neve also recorded and published records of Kashmiri hospital practices in the American Journal of Nursing, contributing to the tool kits of other missionaries and preserving a part of Kashmir's cultural history. == Background == === Early life and influences === Nora Neve was born in England in 1873. Her family members were devout Christians and members of the Church of England. Two of her uncles, Arthur Neve and Ernest Neve, were medical missionaries in Kashmir by the time she was 11 years old. At the young age of 18, Nora traveled to Kashmir to visit her uncles and see the mission hospital where they worked. She decided to join them and the Church Missionary Society (CMS) and a year later, was officially announced as part of the society's ranks in the Church Missionary Gleaner July 1898 edition. === Education === Neve was sent by CMS to The Olives, a training home where they sent women missionary candidates. There, she received her nursing and additional Christian religious education. At the time of her attendance, The Olives was only a 4 year old private training school in the post-Nightingale era, when nursing schools were established in England that focused on providing future nurses practical education, promoting sanitation and cleanliness practices, and on fostering nursing theory and professionalism. == Missionary work == Neve left for Kashmir by sea in September or October 1898. She was supported financially by the church of St. Mary Abbots of Kensington. === Kashmir Mission Hospital === The Kashmir Mission Hospital Neve joined Ernest and Arthur Neve at the Kashmir Mission Hospital at Srinagar. The hospital was considered a modern, state of the art institution. It was known as far away as Balistan, more than 100 miles from Srinagar, from discharged patients who traveled and told others. Eventually, during Neve's time, it would grow to consist of 4 male doctors, 2 English nurses, and 120 hospital beds. In a year, they reported 22,735 new outpatients, 1,764 in patients, 5,038 surgical operations, with 15-18 operations on a busy day. The hospital also played a religious role and considered physical healing to be a vehicle to share the gospel, which they actively taught to patients. Neve shared this sentiment, expressing hope in an article she wrote for the American Journal of Nursing that increasing numbers of patients would be converted to Christianity.  Leadership at the mission hospital  Neve was the Superintendent of Nursing at the Kashmir Missions Hospital. She was an indispensable part of the team developing the hospital; Ernest Neve said that without her, it would have broken down. He also credited her with the efficiency of the hospital, the strict cleanliness, and the disciplined decor, which she maintained through inspections on her daily rounds. Through these practices, she brought the Kashmir Mission Hospital to modern European standards based on the germ theory which had been developed only decades before. Patients/students at the North India Leper Hospital She was described as a kind and patient nurse and was known for teaching her patients as well as caring for their physical ailments, although she reported finding more success teaching young patients than older. She was especially in charge of the women's wards in the Sir Petrabh Signh Pavilion, as nursing care was done by those of the same gender as the patient. She also camped at sites beyond the hospital that were in great need to provide aid temporarily. Neve led other nurses and staff at the hospital. Other nurses at the mission hospital who worked under her supervision include two English nurses, Lucy McCormick and H Smith, with visiting nurses helping during the busy summer months. She spent much of her time supervising eastern assistants, who were recorded to need more assistance because they lack \\"sense of duty\\". Few government hospitals in Kashmir had a nurse on staff at this time, and Neve's necessary and innovative work served as an example for other hospitals in the region. In addition to the Mission Hospital, Neve worked the North India Leper Hospital, a government hospital. == Legacy == Throughout her time in Kashmir, Neve actively corresponded with the American Journal of Nursing, describing her work in detail and offering advice to other missionaries. This included tips as small as how to deal with pesky flies and articles as long as to describe the complex workings of both the Kashmir Mission Hospital and the nearby Leper's Hospital. Through these, she created a guidebook for other nurse missionaries to follow, whether in South Asia or elsewhere, and written record of Kashmir's culture. === Additional published work ===  Nursing in Mission Stations  Neve's article \\"Nursing in Mission Stations\\" was published in the American Journal of Nursing in 1908. In it, she describes her work at the hospital in Srinagar, as described above in the Kashmir Mission Hospital section. She also refers to patients as being in \\"30 AD\\" while the hospital is in the 20th century, demonstrating a sentiment of cultural superiority and a savior complex. She describes the way that it is looked down on for men to care for women outside of their families, explaining why the hospital and its staff were segregated by gender.  A Leper Hospital in North India  \\"A Leper Hospital in North India\\" was published in the American Journal of Nursing a year later, in 1909. It describes another hospital where she worked, which specialized in care of people with leprosy. Although the hospital was managed by CMS, it was run by the state. She reports 173 admissions in 1908 and the average length of stay to be 1,104 days because leprosy is a chronic disease and those infected had to live in years of quarantine to protect others. Some of the patients were treated and no longer had leprosy symptoms, but stayed for care for their other ailments. Work at the hospital was done by orderlies, superintendents, and patients. She notes that just like at the Kashmir Mission Hospital, patients were only cared for by those who shared their gender, as this was a pervasive cultural standard that informed medical practices in Kashmir. === Death === Neve died in 1952 at the age of 73. She is remembered today for her pioneering nursing work in Kashmir, the written documentation of Kashmir culture and missionary service, and commitment to bringing education and Christianity to the people of Kashmir. == References == Category:Christian medical missionaries Category:English Protestant missionaries Category:Leprosy nurses and caregivers Category:Medical missionaries Category:British nurses Category:1873 births Category:1952 deaths ","title":"Nora Neve"},{"id":"61702437","text":"Kerbal Space Program 2 is an upcoming space flight simulation video game developed by Intercept Games and published by Private Division. It is the sequel to 2015's Kerbal Space Program and is scheduled for a release in Q3 2021 for Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One. ==Gameplay== The sequel will build on the sandbox features of Kerbal Space Program, while at the same time introducing new propulsion methods (e.g. the Orion drive), habitation modules for building on-surface, orbital and planetary colonies, a multiplayer mode, as well as interstellar travel. ==Development== Kerbal Space Program 2 was announced at Gamescom 2019 on August 19, with an initial release date set for early 2020. The game was in development by Star Theory Games, formerly Uber Entertainment, which changed its name in order to display a stronger association with the Kerbal Space Program franchise. Development was shifted to Star Theory in part so that Squad could focus on developing further updates for the original game. To ensure that the experience felt \\"grounded\\", the team consulted a panel of scientists and experts including Dr. Uri Shumlak, the associate chair of the University of Washington's Aeronautics and Astronautics department, and Dr Joel Green, who is an astrophysicist. The game also received feedback that the original game was too overwhelming for new players. Therefore, the team aimed to make the game more accessible by introducing more tutorials in order to give more guidance to players to ensure they understand the game's various gameplay systems. However for various reasons, the release date was pushed back to Q3 2021. Take-Two established a new unnamed studio under Private Division to continue development of Kerbal Space Program 2, with some of Star Theory's employees brought into it, leaving it unclear what Star Theory's role remains on the title. Later reporting by Bloomberg revealed that Take-Two was in talks to acquire Star Theory but abruptly changed course, set up a new studio to develop the game (Intercept Games), and then poached a third of Star Theory's developers including the creative director and the lead producer. Star Theory closed its doors three months later. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Open world video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Single-player video games Category:Space flight simulator games Category:Private Division games Category:Upcoming video games scheduled for 2021 Category:Video games about extraterrestrial life Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set on fictional planets Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Video games postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:Video game sequels ","title":"Kerbal Space Program 2"},{"id":"61702460","text":"Dr. Jean Isabelle Dow (25 June 1870 –16 January 1927) was a Canadian medical missionary, who was regarded as a pioneer in women's health care for her work as a member of, and one of the only women in, the Canadian Presbyterian Church Mission in the Honan (currently referred to as Henan) province of China. She played an important role in treating visceral leishmaniasis (kala azar) disease and in creating female specific hospitals where women could be treated as first-class citizens. == Early life and education== Dow was born in the town of Fergus in Ontario, Canada. She was the fifth of eight children. Her father, Peter Dow (married to Agnes Wilson), was the superintendent of his own school, named the Dow’s School. The family was progressive and valued education. They were members of the Melville Presbyterian Church in Fergus. Dow graduated from high school at the age of thirteen and went on to study at the Model School in Mount Forest to become a teacher. From 1885 to 1891, Dow taught at her father's school in Fergus. In 1891, no longer wanting to be a teacher, Dow enrolled in the University of Toronto’s Trinity College where she studied medicine. In 1895, she graduated from college as a licensed physician. ==Career and research== === Introduction to missionary service === Not wanting to practice medicine in Canada, Dow chose to take her medical skills to the Canadian Presbyterian Church Mission in the Honan province of China, otherwise referred to as the North Honan Mission. Growing up, Dow and her family were members of the Melville Presbyterian Church in Fergus. Melville Presbyterian Church was a mission-oriented institution. It was there that Dow was first exposed to missionaries and realized a potential interest in pursuing foreign mission work. In 1891, Dow joined the Presbyterian Women's Foreign Missionary Society which recruited women to engage in missionary service abroad. Notably, Dow critically thought about the impact of her missionary work. In a 1903 letter to her co-worker Margaret Griffith, who worked along side her in the North Honan Mission, Dow reflected on the motivations of medical missionaries working abroad, observing that some of their work was motivated by the “most subtle of all kinds of selfishness – religious selfishness – which seeks happiness, not helpfulness, as the goal.\\" === Missionary experience in the North Honan Province of China === For thirty years, from 1895 to her death in 1927, Dow served as a surgeon and as a member of the North Honan Mission. The North Honan Mission was a Presbyterian mission founded by Jonathan and Rosalind Goforth in 1888. The North Honan Mission had difficulty getting started due to distrust of foreigners. In 1895, immediately after her graduation from the University of Toronto’s Trinity College, Dow was appointed by the Presbyterian Women's Foreign Missionary Society to join the North Honan Mission as a medical missionary. She arrived at the mission on September 30, 1895 to take the place of the late Dr. Lucinda Graham, who had died of cholera. In the North Honan Mission, Dow maintained a varied medical practice treating everything from cataracts and wolf bites to more complicated obstetric issues. Notably, due to cultural traditions, Dow was only allowed to see female patients. Dow learned Chinese and was soon able to converse in it fluently with her female patients. “Oh, what an amount of work needs to be done before this North Honan is won for Christ!\\" Dow wrote in a letter to her friend Margaret Griffith in 1903. === Building gender-separated hospitals === In 1887, Dow established the first women’s hospital. She argued for gender separation in medical hospitals so that women’s medical care could take first priority. Her “chapel-dispensary” treated 400 patients within its first month. She opened similar operations in 1904 and 1913 by repurposing vacated male hospital buildings for her female patients. While some experts argued that creating gender specific wards led to worse medical facilities for both men and women, others, such as Dow, disagreed. Dow was adamant about treating women and men in separate facilities believing it improved the medical care for women. In a 1908 speech, Dow described one of her women's hospital as follows: > \\"It is very humble in appearance, a row of native buildings. Work goes on > native principles, that is, that women provide their own bedding, friends to > wait on them, food, etc., latterly a small fee has been charged to prevent > those coming from curiosity. \\"There are just three small rooms for wards > each holding two or three patients at a time, with the dispensary and > chapel. It may be in the near future greater demands may be made in the way > of developments, more modern appliances and methods of work involving > greater expenditure. There are many points of equipment still lacking; but > we have great opportunities for service. No field gives a great area of the > young women who is ambitious for a life of service. Our patients come from > great distances, even 100 miles off… Today the hospital stands in a unique > position and while first of all evangelistic, its outlook and aim is also > educational.” Dr. Jean Dow, her co-worker Margaret R. Griffith, and her Chinese staff working in Dow's medical clinic in North Henan, China. === Contributions to visceral leishmaniasis disease research === One of Dow’s greatest accomplishments during her missionary career was her contributions, via clinical studies, to visceral leishmaniasis disease research. She, along with Dr. William McClure, are credited with finding the cure for the disease in China. Largely unrecognized for her contributions, Margaret Griffith is one of the few to give Dow credit for her research: > Dr. Dow was among the first to isolate the microscopic organism which causes > the disease, and in subsequent years the Women’s Hospital entered upon a new > actively as methods of treating this scourge were introduced, necessitating > repeated and prolonged courses of extravenous injections.” Dr. Ernest Struthers, a medical missionary who joined the North Henon Mission in 1912, describes one of Dow’s cases in the fall of 1926 where she saved a boy with visceral leishmaniasis disease. Dr. Struthers noted that Dow’s approach was risky, but she had the “courage… to tackle what most would not attempt.” Unlike Dr. Struthers, Dow did not publish any of her research on visceral leishmaniasis. Rather, she prioritized her clinical work. She viewed her clinical work as her way of serving God. === Contributions to serving victims of the North China Famine (1920-1921) === Dow received recognition from the Chinese government for her work during the Famine of 1920-21 and was credited for saving over 400 mothers and children. === Religion and education remained important to Dow throughout her mission work === Evangelical work was central to Dow's life. In a pamphlet that Margaret Griffith wrote about Dow's missionary work, entitled a Beloved Physician, she noted that “[m]edicine was [Dow’s] profession, Evangelism was her passion.” Dow, along with her assistants, used to take off time from their practice to preach and teach the word of God in neighboring areas. Religion was incorporated into Dow’s medical missionary work, and in fact, medicine was, in some ways, a vehicle through which she was able to evangelize others. Several times during her tenure in the North Honan Mission, Dow took furloughs in order to deliver speeches in churches about her missionary work or to enroll in post graduate courses to study the latest advancements in tropical medicine. In 1901, in the wake of the Boxer Rebellion, Dow left Honan China to study Tropical Medicine at the New York University School of Medicine. In 1909, Dow took another furlough to continue her tropical medicine studies at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. She was one of two women in her graduating class. Lastly, in 1925, she became a fellow in Obstetrics at New York Presbyterian Hospital. == Death and legacy== Dow died in China on January 16, 1927, at the age of 56, after a short unknown illness. She never married and had no children. Despite Dow’s success in the medical field, her commitment to science is rarely acknowledged. Rather, she is more often remembered for her religious devotion and her appearance. Even the secretary of the Church’s Foreign Mission Committee, Dr. R.P. Mackay, who spoke at Dow’s funeral, did not mention her contributions to the medical field, but spoke about her physical beauty and her outstanding Christian character: > \\"To begin with Dr. Dow was favoured in personal appearance. Whilst that is > not an essential quality, yet a winsome face and graceful manner lie very > near to the essentials. Dr. Dow was so endowed… Yet with all this attainment > and assured appreciation, she could scarcely be induced to speak of her own > work. When home on furlough she had a great story to tell, but could not be > induced to tell it. She could speak but her words were always impersonal. > The … “I” was ever lacking.\\" For twenty years, Dow was the only female physician and surgeon practicing in North Honan. She was one of the first women to be admitted onto the North Honan Mission’s executive committee. She argued for gender separation in medical hospitals so that women’s medical care could be a first priority and so that they would obtain quality medical care – a pressing issue during the 1920s. She was a was a pioneer in regards to providing health care to women in North Honan, China and one of the first professionals to successfully isolate in China and treat the microorganism carrying the visceral leishmaniasis disease. ==References== Category:Canadian Presbyterian missionaries Category:Christian medical missionaries Category:19th-century women physicians Category:20th-century women physicians Category:19th-century Canadian physicians Category:20th-century Canadian physicians Category:Canadian women physicians Category:1870 births Category:1927 deaths Category:Presbyterian missionaries in China Category:Canadian expatriates in China ","title":"Jean Dow"},{"id":"61702480","text":"Laurent Joly (born 16 July 1976) is a French historian and a specialist of Vichy France and antisemitism. == Life and career == Born in 1976, Joly earned a doctorate in history at the Pantheon-Sorbonne University, following a thesis on \\"Vichy and the Commissariat-General for Jewish Affairs (1941-1944)\\".

His work considers cometary astrochemistry and the development of laser photochemistry to understand planetary atmospheres. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Physical Society and the American Chemical Society. In 2019 he was awarded the Astronomical Society of the Pacific Arthur B.C. Walker II Award for his research and commitment to promoting diversity. In 2021 he was awarded the American Physical Society Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize for outstanding contributions to fundamental chemical physics and spectroscopy associated with asteroids and comets, and for exemplary teaching at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as lifelong service and inspiration to a diverse community. == Early life and education == Jackson was born in Birmingham, Alabama. He grew up in a segregated society and spent part of his childhood in Dynamite Hill, an area in Birmingham that the Ku Klux Klan frequently bombed during the Civil rights movement. His father, a Tuskegee University graduate, owned the Apex Cab Company and also taught auto mechanics at Parker High School, whilst his mother, a Santa Barbara Junior High School graduate, worked for the US Government. At the age of nine Jackson contracted polio and he had to spend a year out of school. After completing tenth grade, Jackson joined Morehouse College as an early entrance student. He was awarded a full scholarship. At first Jackson considered majoring in mathematics, but decided to study chemistry after meeting Henry Cecil McBay. He graduated in 1956 and applied to several graduate schools, including Northwestern University and Purdue University. He received a response from Northwestern, who said that they had already fulfilled their three fellowships for African American students. Eventually he moved Washington, D.C., where he got a job and lived with his cousin. He studied at the Catholic University of America where he was awarded a postgraduate research fellowship. During his doctoral studies he worked in the Harry Diamond Laboratories, where he studied molten salt compounds. During the final year of his PhD, Jackson's wife became pregnant, and Jackson took time out of graduate school to earn money. During this time he worked at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. He returned to the Catholic University of America where he studied gasoline additives. After earning his PhD in 1961 he joined the Lockheed Martin, where he worked on formaldehyde resins and ways to protect missiles as they reenter the Atmosphere of Earth. He returned to the National Institute of Standards and Technology as a postdoctoral researcher, studying how radiant energy impacted chemical structures. He investigated how radiation impacted the coating applied to space vehicles. == Research and careers == In 1964 Jackson joined the Goddard Space Flight Center. It was here that he became interested in the origins of free radicals in comets. While at the Goddard Space Flight Center he proposed to use the International Ultraviolet Explorer satellite to look for comets. Using the Haystack Observatory, Jackson made measurements of water emission in comets. He joined the faculty at the University of Pittsburgh in 1969, where he spent a year researching and teaching. At the University of Pittsburgh he worked with Wade Fite and Ted Brackman on the detection of electron impact on molecules using mass spectrometry. A year later he returned to Goddard, where he developed a system to detect free radicals using laser beams. In 1974 one of Jackson's colleagues, a Professor of Chemistry at Howard University, died suddenly. Jackson agreed to teach his course for the rest of the term and was subsequently appointed to a joint position in chemistry and physics. Here he began working on laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) to study the rovibronic coupling in cyano radicals. He was the first person to demonstrate LIF could be used to study molecular photodissociation. He primarily studied comets using satellites ground-based telescopes, using experimental data and theoretical predictions to establish how the free radicals inside comets form. Despite having left Goddard Space Flight Center, Jackson served as team leader for the International Ultraviolet Explorer telescope, which observed Halley's Comet. He joined University of California, Davis in 1985 and was promoted to Distinguished Professor in 1998. The Jackson laboratory (\\"Jackson’s Photon Crusaders\\") developed tunable lasers which could be used to detect and characterise free radicals. These included excimer lasers, nitrogen-pumped lasers and an Alexandrite laser. By building laser systems in the laboratory, Jackson helped to establish the excited states of molecules that are present in planetary atmospheres. The experiments consisted of one laser for the photodissociation of the parent molecule, and another laser to excite the free radical into an excited state. When the excited molecule fluoresced back to the ground state, the fluorescence was captured in a photomultiplier tube. He has investigated the photochemistry of carbon monoxide, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. His laser systems exploit resonant four-wave mixing, which allows them to photodissociate gases observed in planetary atmospheres. He also showed that it is possible to ionise the resulting atomic fragments using a velocity imaging time-of-flight mass spectrometer. In 1996 The Planetary Society named asteroid 1081 EE37 as (4322) Billjackson in his honour. He served as Chair of the Department of Chemistry at University of California, Davis in 2000. He retired in 2006, but has continued to research and recruit students. In 2013 he was made the Emile A. Dickenson Professor at University of California, Davis. In 2019 the Journal of Physical Chemistry dedicated a special issue to Jackson. === Academic service and advocacy === Jackson has campaigned for equity, diversity and inclusion in science since he started his career. He was one of the founders of the National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers (NOBCChE). The organization began to promote and award minority scientists and engineers, as well as encouraging high school students to consider studying science or engineering. It was supported by Ted Kennedy and the National Science Foundation. Jackson served as NOBCChE's first treasurer from 1973. He stated that he was inspired to start the NOBCChE after attending a meeting of the American Chemical Society, and seeing no African Americans there. He has served in various capacities for the NOBCChE, attending every annual meeting other than one (San Diego, 1999) in protest of the 1996 California Proposition 209. He provided evidence to congress in an effort to increase research funding to historically black colleges and universities. When he arrived at U.C. Davis, only two students from underrepresented minorities had ever earned chemistry PhDs there. While at UC Davis, he secured funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and increased the department's minority student population to about 15% of the academic cohort. Jackson was known for bringing students and researchers to his laboratory “who were the stones the builders rejected, and he made them the cornerstones for future scientific research”. === Awards and honors === His awards and honours include; * 1986 NOBCChE Percy L. Julian Award * 1989 Guggenheim Fellow * 1991 Catholic University of America Alumni Award * 1995 Elected Fellow of the American Physical Society * 1996 Alexander von Humboldt Foundation Research Award * 1997 American Association for the Advancement of Science Lifetime Mentor Award * 2002, 2003 Sigma Xi Distinguished Lecturer * 2004 Elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science * 2010 Elected Fellow of the American Chemical Society * 2011 Morehouse College Bennie Trailblazer Award * 2015 University of California, Davis Emeritus Award * 2019 Astronomical Society of the Pacific Arthur B.C.

The earth is given enough energy in one hour to provide all electrical needs for a year. Available energy is not the issue, but energy storage is the problem and SAGE creates effective storage and electrical power delivery on demand. This technology is especially effective for geothermal wells that have demonstrated inconsistent heat or idle oil or gas fields that have demonstrated the proper geology and have an abundance of solar. == Technology == Thermal injection for oil stimulation was first used in 1907 California in Solar thermal enhanced oil recovery. Heated fluid was used to improve oil production and was one of the first attempts in enhanced oil recovery. Solar energy has been used in enhanced oil recovery as a thermal energy source since 1957 when Atlantic Richfield used it a California experimental facility. In the 1970s, research on the use of injecting CO2, or Carbon dioxide flooding, into wells for enhanced oil recovery led to better modeling techniques and understandings, especially in the area of the flow a heat injection into production wells. Since the 1970s, the geothermal industry has refined the technology behind solar augmented geothermal wells to performed in a predictable and commercially viable way. This is done by relying on concentrated solar heat to recharge heat extracted from the well. Geothermal exploration in the United States has been built around finding easily accessible (close to the surface) high-temperature sources of heat. During exploration, it was common for holes to be drilled and abandoned because they were “dry”, or failed to produce consistent heat for a commercially viable electricity generation. In response to these “dry” holes, the geothermal industry began developing Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS). In EGS, a “hot pan” in the earth is located and the heat is amplified by other means. This method allows for wells with insufficient or inconsistent heat to by viable candidates for synthetic geothermal electricity generation. Solar augmented geothermal uses an apparatus and method to store concentrated solar energy in a subsurface geologic reservoir. The method includes transferring solar thermal energy to a fluid, creating a supercritical fluid. The supercritical fluid is then injected into a subsurface geologic reservoir through an injection well. This method allows a wide array of subsurface geologic reservoirs to become commercially viable for electric production. This includes reservoirs with highly permeable and porous sedimentary stratum, a depleted hydrocarbon field, a depleting hydrocarbon field, a depleted oil field, a depleting oil field, a depleted gas field, or a depleting gas field. Once one of these is charged with a supercritical fluid, the subsurface formation creates a synthetic geothermal reservoir. Any heat added by nature will be taken as a further improvement to the thermal to the electricity conversion process. == History of Geothermal Energy== Geothermal power is power generated by geothermal energy. Existing technologies that are well known include dry steam power stations, flash steam power stations and binary cycle power stations. Geothermal power is a sustainable and renewable source of energy. Because heat is extraction in small amounts compared to the Earth's heat content, the Earth can replenish its heat and continue to provide an abundant source of thermal energy. The greenhouse gas emissions from geothermal energy are on average 45 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour of electricity. This is less than 5 percent of the conventional methods of electric production from coal-fired plants.Moomaw, W., P. Burgherr, G. Heath, M. Lenzen, J. Nyboer, A. Verbruggen, 2011: Annex II: Methodology. In IPCC: Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (ref. page 10) Geothermal electric energy production is currently used in 26 countries. As a source of renewable energy, geothermal has the potential to meet 3-5% of the global demand for energy by 2050. With economic incentives, it is estimated that by 2100 it will be possible to meet 10% of global demand. == History of Solar Thermal Energy== Solar thermal energy (STE) is a form of energy and a technology for harnessing solar energy to generate thermal energy or electrical energy for use in industry, and in the residential and commercial sectors. Augustin Mouchot demonstrated a solar collector with a cooling engine making ice cream at the 1878 Universal Exhibition in Paris. The first installation of solar thermal energy equipment occurred in the Sahara approximately in 1910 by Frank Shuman when a steam engine was run on steam produced by sunlight. Because liquid fuel engines were developed and found more convenient, the Sahara project was abandoned, only to be revisited several decades later. == Economics == In 2015, the worldwide geothermal power capacity amounted to 12.8 gigawatts (GW). 28 percent, or 3,548 megawatts (MW), came from installations in the United States. International markets continue to show greater demand and global geothermal power capacity is expected to reach 14.5–17.6 GW by 2020. The Geothermal Energy Association (GEA) has estimated that only 6.9 percent of the global's total potential has been captured so far. The IPCC reported that geothermal power had the potential to be in the range of 35 GW to 2 TW globally. Countries generating more than 15 percent of their electricity from geothermal sources include El Salvador, Kenya, the Philippines, Iceland, New Zealand, and Costa Rica. Geothermal power requires no fuel as it relies on thermal energy for the production of electricity. Because it is immune to fuel cost fluctuations, geothermal is more predictable for commercial pricing for consumers. However, capital costs tend to be higher than other methods of electric energy creation. Drilling wells accounts for over half the costs and exploration of potential sites entails significant risks and costs. In Nevada, a typical well costs about $10 million to drill, with a 20% failure rate. In total, electrical station construction and well drilling costs about 2–5 million € per MW of electrical capacity, while the levelised energy cost is 0.04–0.10 € per kW·h. Enhanced geothermal systems tend to have capital costs above $4 million per MW and levelized energy cost above $0.054 per kW·h. Geothermal power is highly scalable as it is a source of renewable energy. While initial capital costs can be high, it has the ability to efficiently and effectively provide energy for rural communities and towns disconnected from larger power grid infrastructure. ==U.S. Tax Credits and Subsidies== === Business Energy Tax Credit === The Business Energy Investment Tax Credit (ITC) is a U.S. federal corporate tax credit - applicable to commercial, industrial, utility, and agricultural sectors. Technologies that are eligible for the ITC are solar water heat, solar space heat, solar thermal electric, solar thermal process heat, photovoltaics, wind, biomass, geothermal electric, fuel cells, geothermal heat pumps, CHP/cogeneration, solar hybrid lighting, microturbines, and geothermal direct-use. This program is co-administered by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The tax credits were expanded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and most components will last until December 31, 2016. The credit is equal to 10% of expenditures, with no maximum credit limit stated. Eligible geothermal energy property includes geothermal heat pumps and equipment used to produce, distribute or use energy derived from a geothermal deposit. For electricity produced by geothermal power, equipment qualifies only up to, but not including, the electric transmission stage. == Current Projects== RenewGeo by UC-Won. == External links == Solar Augmented Geothermal Energy (SAGE) - US Patent 7472548 B2 * http://www.google.com/patents/US7472548 ==See also== *Enhanced geothermal system *Geothermal heating *Hot dry rock geothermal energy *Alternative Energy *Energy development *Geothermal energy *Solar power in Nevada *Hot dry rock geothermal energy *List of renewable energy topics by country == References == Category:Geothermal energy ","title":"Solar augmented geothermal energy"},{"id":"61702553","text":"The 1971 Soviet First League was the inaugural season of the Soviet First League and the 31st season of the Soviet second tier league competition. ==Final standings== ==External links== * 1971 season.

Dunn was born in Newport, Rhode Island, where he married Ann Atkinson on November 1, 1754. In 1762 he apparently enlisted in the New York Militia, and in 1765 he was made freeman of New York City, where he worked from 1759-1776 as a silversmith with his shop on Crown Street. In an invoice of January 28, 1775, he billed Philip Schuyler for making 9 gold mourning rings. When the British occupied New York in 1776, he fled to Morristown, New Jersey, where he worked from 1776–1782, and subsequently to Newark, New Jersey, where he worked from 1782–1783. However, in the New-York Packet of January 5, 1784, he advertised that: \\"Cary Dunn, Gold and Silver Smith, Begs leave to acquaint his friends and the public in general, that he is returned to this city from New Jersey, after a seven years exile—that he carries on his business as usual, at the old corner house, where he formerly lived, between the Fly Market and New-Dutch Church, No. 23 Crown-Street.\\" He was a member of Gold and Silver Smiths' Society in 1786, and from 1786-1792 he partnered in the city with his son Cary Dunn (born June 10, 1759) as C. Dunn & Son, then worked in his own practice from 1793–1796. Dunn's works are collected in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. == References == * \\"Cary Dunn\\", Silver Salon Forums. * \\"Cary Dunn\\", American Silversmiths. * American Silversmiths and Their Marks: The Definitive (1948) Edition, Stephen Guernsey Cook Ensko, Courier Corporation, 1983, page 78. * Crafts and Craftsmen of New Jersey, Walter Hamilton Van Hoesen, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1973, page 227. * Early American Silver in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Beth Carver Wees, Medill Higgins Harvey, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2013, page 62. * Catalogue of an exhibition of American paintings, furniture, silver and other objects of art, MDCXXV- MDCCCXXV, by Henry Watson Kent and Florence N.

Services at Ebenezer are conducted in the Welsh language. ==Early history== The chapel was founded in 1849 by baptists who previously worshipped at neighbouring Llandyfan and Saron. The earliest meetings are said to have taken place in a house in Field Street, with thirteen members in the first instance. The following year, a new chapel which was named Ebenezer was built near Quay Street adjacent to a property known as Primrose Cottage. Primrose Cottage was subsequently acquired by the chapel and served as the chapel caretaker's residence until it was demolished in the 1960s and replaced by a car park. The Rev. Daniel Jones of Felinfoel supported the church in its early years, baptising three female members in February 1850 and chairing the committee which oversaw the building of the chapel. The first minister was Dafydd Morris, a native of Pembrokeshire whose pastorate included Ebenezer and Soar, Llandyfan. Morris was minister for three years. The second minister, from 1862 until 1867 was Dafydd Williams. ==The ministry of T,F. Williams, 1867-1907== In 1867, the Rev T.F. Williams commenced his long ministry at Ebenezer. The pastorate included Saron, Llandybie, until 1891 but thereafter Williams restricted his minitry to Ebenezer alone. At the start of Williams's ministry there were around fifty members but by the time of his retirement in 1907 the membership numbered 670. During these decades the population grew rapidly as Cross Inn, renamed Ammanford in the 1880s, became a major centre of the anthracite coal trade. The chapel building proved to be too small, resulting in Ebenezer being rebuilt and enlarged in 1877. Ebenezer was again extended in 1895. In 1907, on completion of forty years as minister, Williams was presented with a testemonial \\"as a token of their regard and deep affection.\\" In the later years of Williams's ministry a number of smaller churches were formed in the locality as branches of Ebenezer. A schoolroom had been located at Pantyffynnon since the 1850s and this was established as a church in its own right in 1904, known as Bethel. Another schoolroom at Penybanc, built in 1893, became a church in its own right in 1912, known as Pisgah. An English Baptist Church was established at Ammanford in 1904 and finally, during the pastorate of John Griffiths, Seion, Tirydail was opened in 1913. ==The ministry of John Griffiths, 1908-1925== John Griffiths was inducted as minister of Ebenezer in 1908, having previously served at Ponciau near Wrexham. At that time, Ebenezer had around 600 members. In 1919, Griffiths was elected to represent Ammanford on Carmarthenshire County Council as a Progressive candidate, comfortably defeating a Labour candidate. A few months later, however, Griffiths resigned his pastorate to move to Llandudno. Within a few weeks, however, Griffiths reversed his decision and returned to Ammanford. He left for Cardiff some years later. ==Later history== Griffiths was succeeded in 1927 by R.T. Evans, who came to Ammanford from Newport, Pembrokeshire. Evans was minister for seven years before being appointed Secretary of the Welsh Baptist Union in 1934. On his retirement from that role twenty five years later, Evans was elevated to the presidency of the union and the annual meeting of the Union was held at Ebenezer, his former church, in 1959. The poet E. Llwyd Williams was minister of Ebenezer from 1936 until his early death in 1960. Williams won the chair at the National Eisteddfod at Rhyl in 1953 and the following years won the crown at the National Eisteddfod at Ystradgynlais. In 1962, Garfield Eynon moved from Seion, Cwmaman to become minister of Ebenezer and remained until his departure to Ebenezer, Aberavon in 1975. John Talfryn Jones became minister at Ebenezer in 1977 and has served for over forty years.

Today, the term applies mostly to sacred scripture. Examples of plene scripta appear frequently in classical Hebrew texts, and copyists are obliged to copy them unchanged, to ensure that biblical or other sacred texts are written with universal conformity. The expression plene scriptum ( yater, \\"excess\\"), sometimes simply described in Hebrew as מלא (malé, \\"full\\"), is often used in contrast with defective scriptum ( ḥaser, deficient), the latter implying a word in which a letter that is normally present has been omitted. Together, plene and defective scripta are sometimes described using the Hebrew phrase \\"haser ve yater\\" (). ==Implications== In the Hebrew Bible, in the first pericope of Devarim in Deuteronomy 3:21, the name \\"Joshua\\" is written in Hebrew in plene scriptum ( yhwšw’), as it possesses a superfluous \\"waw\\", and which word is normally written with only one \\"waw\\", as in יהושע (yhwš’). Other examples abound of this anomaly, such as the name \\"Jacob\\" ( y’qwb) in Leviticus 26:42. The Hebrew name \\"Issachar\\" (יִשָּׂשכָר), where there is a second letter shin (ש) having no function at all, is a classic example of plene scriptum. The word צידה in Genesis 27:3, where the he at the end of the word has no function at all, is another example of plene scriptum. The Babylonian Talmud discusses why the Hebrew Bible in writes for the plural word \\"booths\\" the Hebrew word סֻּכֹּת (in defective scriptum), but in the verse that immediately follows makes use of the plural word in its usual form, סֻּכּוֹת.Babylonian Talmud (Sukkah 6b) A biblical word's plene or defective characteristic has often been used in rabbinic hermeneutics to decide Halachic norms.Cf. the words of Rabbi Yishmael in Babylonian Talmud (Menahot 34b), regarding the word לטטפת (\\"frontlets\\"), in Exo. 13:16, Deut. 6:8, and Deut. 11:18, by which he learnt that Tefillin are made with four compartments; cf. Sanhedrin 3b–4b on the word קרנת (\\"horn of the altar\\"), in Lev. 4:7, vs. 18, and vs. 25, and by which verses the School of Hillel learnt how many blood oblations are required as a first resort to be put on the horns of the altar when bringing a sin-offering, and how many are actually indispensable. The Talmud and the rabbis explain the variations in plene and defective scriptum found in the Torah as being merely a Halacha le-Moshe mi-Sinai (a Law given to Moses at Sinai)., s.v. Part III, responsum # 594 (reprinted in Israel, n.d.)() In the Semitic languages (Hebrew, Aramaic and Arabic), paleographers often describe the addition of a plene consonantal letter, such as \\"waw\\" and \\"yod\\" (used in place of the vowels \\"o\\", \\"u\\", \\"i\\", and \\"ei\\"), as employing matres lectionis in its reading, although not all plene letters used in Hebrew words are indeed a matres lectionis., s.v. הרים (in ) ==Variant readings== The ethnographer, Jacob Saphir (1822–1886), in his 19th-century work Iben Safir, mentions the tradition of orthography found in the Halleli Codex of the Pentateuch, in which he laid down the most outstanding examples of plene and defective scriptum copied generation after generation by the scribes. (first printing Lyck 1866) The Catalan rabbi and Talmudist, Menachem Meiri (1249 – c. 1310), also brings down an exhaustive list of words in his Kiryat Sefer, showing which words are to be written by scribes in plene scriptum and which words are to be written in defective scriptum, based on the Masoretic Text. Rabbi Jedidiah Norzi (1560–1626) wrote a popular work on Hebrew orthography contained in the Five Books of Moses, and in the five Megillot, with examples of plene and defective writings, which was later named Minḥat Shai. In the Tikkun Soferim (the model text for copying Torah scrolls by scribes), the word plene is always used in relation to other words written in defective scriptum, not because there is necessarily anything unusual or abnormal about the word being written in such a way, but to ensure a universal layout (conformity) in scribal practices,; , reproduced from the author's thesis (Ph.D.), first submitted to the Department of Religion at Sir George Williams University, Montreal, Quebec 1971 where one word in a text must be written as though it were lacking in matres lectionis, and another word in a different text (sometimes even the same word) appearing as though it was not. Among Israel's diverse ethnic groups, variant readings have developed over certain words in the Torah, the Sephardic tradition calls for the word ויהיו (wyhyw) in the verse ויהיו כל ימי נח () to be written in defective scriptum (i.e. ויהי wyhy), but the Yemenite Jewish community requiring it to be written in plene scriptum (i.e. ויהיו).Yihya Saleh, Ḥeleḳ ha-Diḳdūḳ, San'a n.d. (in Hebrew), s.v. פרשת נח The word mineso in גדול עוני מנשוא () is written in Sephardic Torah scrolls in plene scriptum, with an additional \\"waw\\", but in Yemenite Torah scrolls, the same word mineso is written in defective scriptum, without a \\"waw\\" (i.e. מנשא mnš‘). ==Other usage== The word plene has also come to denote the horizontal bar or line written above the six double-sounding consonants in ancient Hebrew codices, whenever their assigned reading is to be read without a dagesh, or as a non-accentuated Hebrew character. These letters are the bet (), gimel (), dalet (), kaph (), pe (), and tau (). When the accentuation dot appears in the middle of these Hebrew characters, there is no plene bar written above them. In ancient Roman usage, the phrase plene scriptum may have simply referred to Latin characters written without abbreviation. == See also == * Mater lectionis * Hebrew spelling * * Parashah * Qere and Ketiv * Ktiv hasar niqqud == References == ==External link== * Vatican Library Heb.

He was the eight of eleven children born to Ebenezer Greene, a farmer who also taught at the local school during the winter. In 1828, Greene attended private school run by his brother, Rev. John Greene. The following year Greene began teaching in Belchertown. During the winter of 1830-31 he attended Leicester Academy. He enrolled in Brown University in 1833 and graduated in 1837. ==Teaching== After graduating from Brown, Greene became an assistant teacher at the Worcester County Manual Labor High School (later known as the Worcester Academy). He then served as its principal from 1838 to 1840, when he resigned due to ill health. He continued his association with the school as a trustee from 1852 until his death. During his time on the board of trustees, Greene successfully thwarted an effort to turn the school over to the Newton Theological Institution and in 1869 relocated the academy to its current location. In 1839, Greene married Edna Amelia Bartlett of Worcester. They had one son, Frank Bartlett Greene. In 1854 he married Mary Adaline Bailey of Salem, Massachusetts. They had two sons (John Stimson Greene and Samuel Stuart Greene) and one daughter (Alice Greene Comstock). In 1840, Greene became the first ever superintendent of schools in Springfield, Massachusetts. From 1842 to 1849 he taught in the Boston Public Schools. In 1846 he published his first of eight books on grammar. From 1849 to 1851 he was an agent of the Massachusetts Board of Education. In 1851 he was made superintendent of schools in Providence, Rhode Island. He concurrently served as a professor of didactics at Brown. In 1852, Greene and Dana P. Colburn, an instructor from the Bridgewater Normal School, began a course of lectures for those who wished to become teachers. Their efforts would result in the creation of the Rhode Island Normal School in 1854. In 1855, Greene resigned as superintendent to become chairman of Brown's mathematics and civil engineering department. In 1864 he became a professor of natural philosophy and astronomy. In 1875 he switched to mathematics and astronomy. In 1880, Greene supervised the construction of Brown's baseball field, Lincoln Field (his two youngest sons were members of the team). Greene also served on the Providence school committee for eighteen years.

In private ownership after the conclusion of her U.S. Government career she was renamed El Don. ==Bureau of Fisheries== === Construction and acquisition === The vessel was constructed in 1918NOAA Fisheries Alaska Fisheries Science Center AFSC Historical Corner: Blue Wing & Red Wing, Kodiak-Afognak Patrol Boats as the commercial purse seiner August. The United States Bureau of Fisheries (BOF) purchased her in 1924 and renamed her USFS Blue Wing. === Operational history === On 29 July 1924, Blue Wing departed Seattle, Washington, to head north to the Territory of Alaska to begin her first season of fishery patrol work. She patrolled in Southeast Alaska until early September 1924, then moved to Cook Inlet on the coast of Southcentral Alaska to patrol there. In 1925, Blue Wing was reassigned to summer patrol duties in the Kodiak Archipelago. Based at the BOF fish hatchery at Afognak Lake (also known as Litnik Lake) on Afognak Island, for the next ten years she served as tender to the hatchery and conducted fishery protection patrols around Kodiak Island and Afognak Island each summer. Each autumn, she usually moved to Southeast Alaska to patrol there for the remainder of the season. During either the winter of 1929–1930 or the winter of 1930–1931NOAA Fisheries Alaska Fisheries Science Center AFSC Historical Corner: Scoter, the Agency's Bristol Bay Boat (sources disagree), Blue Wing underwent a significant renovation during which her original Union engine was replaced by a three-cylinder Standard gasoline engine taken from the BOF fishery patrol vessel when Scoter received a new engine. Scoters original engine was rebored before being installed on Blue Wing. During the mid-1930s, Blue Wing added Bristol Bay to her patrol areas. In June 1936, her service in the Kodiak Archipelago came to an end and her summer patrol responsibilities shifted to Prince William Sound in Southcentral Alaska. During the spring of 1937, she assisted in the replacement of stream markers in the Ketchikan district in Southeast Alaska. ==Fish and Wildlife Service== US FWS Blue Wing in 1947 after a major renovation.In 1939, the BOF was transferred from the United States Department of Commerce to the United States Department of the Interior, and on 30 June 1940, it was merged with the Interior Department's Division of Biological Survey to form the new Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), an element of the Interior Department that was destined to become the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in 1956. The vessel thus became part of the FWS fleet as US FWS Blue Wing. In 1941, Blue Wing suffered engine damage during a severe gale off British Columbia, Canada, and narrowly avoided running ground. A search for her began when she was reported missing. After several days, Canadian police found her at anchor on the British Columbia coast while her crew attempted to repair her engine. In February 1951, Blue Wing was still in FWS service, based at Craig in Southeast Alaska. At some point thereafter she was sold into private ownership, and later had the name El Don. == References == Category:Fishery protection vessels Category:Ships of the United States Bureau of Fisheries Category:Ships of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service Category:1918 ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1941 ","title":"USFS Blue Wing"},{"id":"61702837","text":"Haplogroup D or D-CTS3946 is a Y-chromosome haplogroup. Both D-CTS3946 and E lineages also exhibit the single-nucleotide polymorphism M168 which is present in all Y-chromosome haplogroups except A and B, as well as the YAP+ unique- event polymorphism, which is unique to Haplogroup DE. Subclades of haplogroup D-CTS3946 are found primarily in East Asia, though they are also found regularly with low frequency in Central Asia and Southeast Asia, and have also been found sporadically in Western Africa and Western Asia. ==Overview== Proposed migration of haplogroup D according to Haber et al. Haplogroup D was formerly the name of the D lineage D-M174. However, a study (Haber et al. 2019) identified a haplogroup, termed \\"D0\\", in three Nigerian samples. The \\"D0\\" haplogroup is outside M174, but shares 7 SNPs with it that E lacks. The authors consider several possibilities, but in part because of the likely deep-rooting of haplogroup \\"D0\\", as well as recently calculated early divergence times for it and its parent haplogroup, DE, the authors conclude in favor of an African origin for D0 DE, as well as for the common ancestor (now known as D-CTS3946 or \\"D\\") of D0 and D-M174. According to Haber et al., D0 is a branch of the DE lineage near the DE split but on the D branch, diverging around 71,000 years ago. The authors find divergence times for DE*, E, and D0, all likely within a period of about 76,000-71,000 years ago, and a likely date for the exit of the ancestors of modern Eurasians out of Africa (and ensuing Neanderthal admixture) later, at around 50,300-59,400 years ago, which they argue, also supports an African origin for those haplogroups. Thus D-CTS3946 is proposed to have spread both within and outside of Africa: with one branch diverging into D0 in Africa, and another branch outside Africa eventually diverging into D-M174 (i.e. with the M174 mutation later arising from the D-CTS3946 that had spread to Asia). \\"D0\\" has also been named \\"D2\\", and former D (D-M174) has now also been termed \\"D1\\" due to this discovery. Three other samples of D2 were also found in West Asia (also in 2019): two in Saudi Arabia and another one in Syria. The sample found in Syria is to date the most basal sample of D2. The recent evidence (as also proposed by Haber et al.) suggests that D2 is a highly divergent haplogroup close to the DE split but on the D branch and lacking the M174 mutation possessed by the other known D lineages (belonging to its sibling D-M174). ==Phylogeny of the subclades== ISOGG (version: 14.151).Y-DNA Haplogroup D and its Subclades - 2019 *DE (YAP) **D (CTS3946) ***D1 (M174/Page30, IMS-JST021355) ****D1a (CTS11577) *****D1a1 (F6251/Z27276) ******D1a1a (M15) TibetHammer MF, Karafet TM, Park H et al.

The Polish National Alliance is a fraternal organization for Polish-Americans which was founded in 1880. The organization was founded to provide aid to new Polish immigrants, promote the preservation of Polish culture in America, and campaign for an independent Poland. Its headquarters building at 1514-1520 W. Division opened in 1938; the organization had been seeking a larger headquarters for some time before then, but the Great Depression and internal conflicts prevented them from building one.

This season contained the 300th episode of the long-running TV show; the milestone was reached on October 9, 2019, when the third episode of the season premiered. Like previous seasons, this season also had dark weeks (weeks during which no new episode would air), after episodes four and seven. Trey Parker and Matt Stone continued to write, direct, and edit every episode the week prior to air, as the duo has done since the series debuted in 1997. Similar to previous seasons, the season features continuing elements and a recurring storyline, from episodes 1 through 6, without adhering to a linear story arc, while lampooning ICE detention centers, the 2019 film Joker, media censorship in China, the antivaccine movement, plant based food, the Trump Administration, transgenderism in athletics, and the competition between traditional cable television and media streaming. ==Production== On July 8, 2015, two months prior to the season 19 premiere, Comedy Central announced they had renewed South Park for an additional 30 episodes over three seasons. This renewal was in addition to the two-year contract already in place with Parker and Stone, guaranteeing South Park would air until at least 2019. On September 12, 2019, the show was renewed for seasons 24 through 26 until 2022. ==Main theme== This season had multiple changes to the traditional theme song from the show. For the first six episodes of the season, an overall story arc focusing on Randy Marsh's marijuana farm named Tegridy Farms was featured. During these episodes, the theme song's lyrics and graphics were changed to focus on Tegridy Farms and also featured vocals by Randy Marsh and Towelie. In the episode \\"Board Girls\\", the regular theme was completely abandoned and replaced with a theme about the PC Babies, the politically correct children of PC Principal and Vice Principal Strong Woman. In the \\"Turd Burglars\\" episode, the theme returned to the show, but starring the women of South Park, in a fictional show titled \\"One for the Ladies\\". In the \\"Basic Cable\\" episode, the theme was abandoned again and replaced with a faux intro titled \\"The Scott Malkinson Show\\". The traditional theme song was put back in on the final episode \\"Christmas Snow\\". ==Controversy== On October 7, 2019, South Park was reportedly banned from the Chinese Internet with videos, mentions, and discussion forums for the animated series being removed and shut down in response to episode 2 of the season, \\"Band in China\\".

Her roles in the television series Breaking Bad (2010) and The Handmaid's Tale (2018–2019) were well-received. Dretzin has narrated multiple books, including for children, in different accents. ==Personal life== Julie Dretzin was born on May 24, 1968, in the United States. She said, \\"I had a theatrical childhood. I was doing Paul Lynde imitations at 4. And my mom was a casting director for Hal Prince for fifteen years\\". She attended Hampshire College and her final paper was a thesis about \\"the destruction of the black-Jewish relationship\\". She originally planned to attend Rutgers University for a master's degree in theater. When she was offered an audition for the Broadway production The Sisters Rosensweig, Dretzin assumed that she would not receive the role, but she received notice of her being chosen while she was shopping for an apartment that was located near her campus. She is married to the television writer Sam Catlin, who wrote for Breaking Bad. The couple has two children. ==Career== ===Stage=== Dretzin made her professional acting debut in the 1993 Broadway play The Sisters Rosensweig as Tess Goode. The play ran from March 3, 1993 to August 14, 1993. In 1994 she was a cast member of The Family of Mann and played in the off-Broadway revival of Uncommon Women and Others. In 1995 she appeared in a production of A Dybbuk by the Hartford Stage Company. ===Audiobooks=== Dretzin has narrated audiobooks, including some for children. These include There's a Girl in My Hammerlock, recorded for Recorded Books in 1999. In 2003, the Young Adult Library Services Association chose Dretzin's 2001 narration of The Beetle and Me: A Love Story by Karen Romano Young as part of the organization's Selected List of Audiobooks for Young Adults. In a 2001 review of the cassette audiobook Three Days by Donna Jo Napoli, the magazine AudioFile said: \\"Julie Dretzin's narration is low-key and consistently paced, building the suspense to the unexpected twists at the end. Dretzin's vocal characterizations are there but subtle as most of the story is told inside Jackie's head; we hear softness and pain in Claudia's voice, a gruff quality for the old man\\". An AudioFile review of the audiobook The Adventures of Flash Jackson by William Kowalski stated, \\"The book keeps the listener alert with its humor, colorful characters, suspense, and, as read by Julie Dretzin, considerable charm. Dretzin wonderfully impersonates our heroine and, without actually fully voicing them, such other characters as her idiot savant neighbor, her timorous mother, and the sweet little old lady neighbor who turns out to be a retired CIA operative\\". Dretzin was similarly commended for executing Russian accents for both young and old characters in her 2003 reading of The Impossible Journey, and a Maine accent for her 2004 reading of The Canning Season. Dretzin held free readings of a play by her husband titled Sea of Terror, in 2004. ===Television=== Dretzin received positive reviews for her role in the crime drama television series Breaking Bad in 2010 and The Handmaid's Tale in 2018–2019. Rebbekah Wiltons of Worldation wrote that \\"she is kind of a big deal\\" in reference to Dretzin's role in Breaking Bad. In a review of an episode of The Handmaid's Tale, Allison Shoemaker of The A.V. Club wrote that Dretzin was great in the episode as Eleanor.

Her work includes residential and commercial buildings and is notable for its emphasis on green and passive design concepts. She is known for her research on the American porch, which begun with her Masters in Architecture thesis at the University of California, Berkeley College of Environmental Design and continued throughout her career. Rochlin is LEED Homes and Living Future Accredited. == Early years == Davida Rochlin was born in October 1951Rochlin, Davida (July 29, 2019). \\"Bio-Davida Rochlin, AIA, LEED Homes AP, LFA Principal, Davida Rochlin Architecture.\\" in Los Angeles to Fred and Harriet Rochlin. Fred was born in Nogales, Arizona, and made his way to California as an architecture student at UC Berkeley. He went on to have a successful career as a Los Angeles based architect for decades. Not long after retiring, Fred discovered a second career as a performer in the late nineties when he began performing monologues of war stories from his time in World War II. This experience eventually led to the publication of his book Old Man in a Baseball Cap: A Memoir of World War II (). Harriet was born in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles and also attended UC Berkeley, which is where she met Fred. Harriet was a writer, historian, and lecturer who was regarded as an authority on Jewish heritage in the Western United States. Her research in this area was largely inspired by her experience growing up in Boyle Heights, then a diverse community made up of people of Jewish, Mexican, African, and Asian descent. Boyle Heights was once home to the largest West Coast Jewish community, a fact that Harriet's work, including her book Pioneer Jews: A New Life in the Far West (), co-written with Fred, focused on. The two were married in July 1947. Together they have four children Davida, Margy, Judy, and Michael. Rochlin followed in her parents' footsteps by attending University of California, Berkeley, where she earned both a Bachelor of Arts and Masters of Architecture in 1973 and 1976 respectively. It was there that she began her research on the American porch, completing a thesis on the topic under the mentorship of American architect Joseph Esherick. This research marked Rochlin early on in her career as an authority on American domestic vernacular architecture, particularly regarding the porch as both social custom and passive design. After graduating from UC Berkeley, Rochlin worked at Esherick, Homsey, Dodge, and Davis in San Francisco and Rochlin and Baran (currently RBB Architects) in Los Angeles. Many of the medical projects that Rochlin worked on came from her time as a project planner and architect a Rochlin and Baran. She also spent time in Atlanta, Georgia continuing with her porch research and compiling images, research, and writing on the topic. == Davida Rochlin Architecture (DRAIA) == Rochlin founded her architecture firm in 1986, which worked out of the modernist commercial building, The Barry Building, in Los Angeles, California for thirty years. After a developer bought the landmark building, DRAIA relocated to an office in Santa Monica, California. Rochlin's architectural work includes residential, commercial, educational, and health care facilities. The overall focus of Rochlin's work, starting with her porch research in the seventies and extending to her latest projects, is sustainability and energy efficiency. For example, the Net Zero Canyon Orchard residence, a LEED Gold home in Santa Monica, is designed to be completely passive. \\"Net zero\\" homes \\"are so air-tight, well insulated, and energy efficient that they produce as much renewable energy as they consume over the course of a year, resulting in a net zero energy bill, [and a] carbon-free home.\\" Rochlin's work emphasizes design with low impact, particularly through use of the porch. As Rochlin herself remarked, \\"depending on where you orient a porch, it can be a profound insulator in winter and source of shade in summer.\\" In architecture, the porch can serve as a mediator between the built environment and the natural landscape. Rochlin's architectural theory regarding the porch has been influential among other contemporary architects and researchers, as well. Most of Rochlin's residential designs feature a porch, the look of which varies depending on the local landscape. At the Honakai House in Hawaii and Rancho Girasol in Taos, New Mexico, the porch takes the form of a ground level space that blends with the surrounding vast, rugged landscape and single story, low slung nature of the homes. Houses such as the Four Porch House in Los Angeles and Sea Level House in Malibu, California. have many small pocket porches throughout, designed for different needs and uses. Rochlin's emphasis on mediation and synergy between landscape and abode can be seen in the attention paid to the space around her homes as well. For example, the Four Porch House is notable for an arbor of Santa Rosa plums planted out front. This arbor serves multiple purposes, including channeling the energy between inside and outside space and giving the home a distinctly California character. While Rochlin's architectural projects range in type, she is most noted for her domestic work. In addition to work on the American porch, Rochlin's theory on vernacular architecture is also cited regarding kitchen design, another aspect residential architecture. == Exhibitions == Much of the research Rochlin conducted during her thesis and tenure in Atlanta culminated in The Front Porch exhibition at the Craft and Folk Art Museum in Los Angeles, California. This exhibit was part of a city wide series of fifteen exhibitions shown at twelve different museums and galleries around Los Angeles. The series, Home Sweet Home, was organized by designer Gere Kavanaugh and architect Charles Moore through the Craft and Folk Art Museum, beginning in 1979. The focus of the series was domestic and vernacular architecture. An essay by each curator involved is highlighted in the exhibit catalog Home Sweet Home: American Domestic Vernacular Architecture () edited by Charles W. Moore, Kathryn Smith, and Peter Becker. The exhibits were on view across Los Angeles from October 1983 through January 1984. In 2010, Rochlin revisited the porch with The New American Porch, a pop-up exhibit at the LA Archive Gallery. Rochlin also curated an exhibition of her father's watercolors. Fred Rochlin Watercolors showed at the Art + Architecture Pop-Up Gallery in Los Angeles, California in 2009. Also in 2010, Rochlin was featured at the American Institute of Architects LA 2010 Design Awards Exhibition at the Architecture + Design Museum in Los Angeles, California. == Personal life == Rochlin is married to Fred Marcus and currently resides in Santa Monica, California.

Opened as the Sacred Heart Church in 1913 to serve the city's rapidly growing population, Sacred Heart has been a historic \\"nursery\\" for many of Edmonton's immigrant Catholic parishes. In 1991, facing an aging congregation and declining weekly attendance, the parish's inner-city location was seen as an opportunity to serve Edmonton's growing urban Indigenous population. On October 27 of that year, the Archdiocese of Edmonton's Native Pastoral Centre was moved into Sacred Heart as Archbishop Joseph MacNeil declared the church to be a First Nations, Métis, and Inuit national parish, the first of its kind in Canada. ==History== In the early 1900s, an ongoing immigration rush to the Canadian West caused a rapid expansion of the Catholic Church in the region. Immaculate Conception Parish, the antecedent of Sacred Heart, was established in 1906 to accommodate immigrants to Edmonton. By 1911, Immaculate Conception was also over capacity. The solution was to reserve Immaculate Conception for Francophone Catholics, erecting under the same boundaries a new Sacred Heart Parish for all others. Sacred Heart opened on December 25, 1913, in what is today the historic McCauley neighbourhood. A fire destroyed much of the church on November 16, 1966, but was used as an opportunity to remodel the building around the updated liturgy of the Second Vatican Council. A number of Edmonton's immigrant Catholic national parishes have operated out of Sacred Heart over the years, while gathering resources to build their own churches. These include Italian (Santa Maria Goretti), Spanish (Our Lady of Guadalupe), Portuguese (Our Lady of Fatima), and Croatian (Nativity of Mary). An Eritrean community is still present in the building today, with approximately 600 attending weekly mass, along with a local branch of the Cursillo movement. ==First Peoples== The interior of the church contains symbolism derived from Indigenous spirituality. Because of its proximity to downtown Edmonton and its attendant population of transient and homeless people, many of them Indigenous Canadians, Sacred Heart began to accrue more and more social responsibilities. An annual volunteer-run free Christmas dinner began in 1971, and a food bank started operating out of the church basement in 1980. At the same time, an aging congregation led to declining attendance. The Archdiocese made the decision to merge the faltering parish with its Native Pastoral Centre, then operating out of a converted downtown warehouse. On October 27, 1991, Archbishop Joseph MacNeil declared the church to be a First Nations, Métis, and Inuit parish, creating the Sacred Heart Church of the First Peoples. The parish was placed under the direction of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, an order historically specializing in Indigenous ministry and mission. As the first Catholic church in Canada so designated, Sacred Heart's interior is adorned with Indigenous symbolism, such as the medicine wheel, the rainbow as a bridge to the next world, and the eagle as a symbol of God. A number of murals and paintings by Indigenous artists are displayed in the nave. Sunday Mass begins with a smudging ceremony, and the tabernacle is housed inside a teepee. The poorest Catholic parish in Edmonton, Sacred Heart's outreach ministries are an important part of downtown Edmonton's network of social services. Holding free community meals on a monthly basis, the church also serves as the epicenter of a Christmas hamper charity program, and provides funerals at no cost for those who cannot afford them. Former pastor Jim Holland, who served at Sacred Heart from 1995 to 2017, has been recognized for his leading role in the parish's revitalization. In 2016, the City of Edmonton renamed 108A Avenue \\"Father Jim Holland Way\\", and in 2017, Holland was inducted into the Alberta Order of Excellence. ==References== Category:Churches in Edmonton Category:First Nations in Alberta Category:Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Edmonton ","title":"Sacred Heart Church of the First Peoples"},{"id":"61703268","text":"Driving Music is the third EP by Australian singer songwriter Mallrat.

In August 1901, the story was published in book form by Nokkrir Prentarar, mentioning Valdimar Ásmundsson, publisher and Editor-in-chief of Fjallkonan, as translator. His precise role in the creation of the Icelandic text remained a riddle until March 2017, when it became clear that it was a shortened and modified translation (with Icelandic elements added) of an earlier Dracula variant serialized in the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladets Halfvecko-Upplaga in 1899–1900.De Roos, Hans Corneel.\\"Early Serializations and Translations of Dracula, and the Internationalization of the Press 1890-1900. Keynote presentation at the Children of The Night International Dracula Conference, Brașov, Romania, October 2018. The annotated English translation of Makt myrkranna by Hans Corneel de Roos was released on 7 February 2017. The Swedish text of Mörkrets makter was published as a book in Sweden in November 2017 by Rickard Berghorn's Aleph Bokförlag, based on a longer variant serialized in the newspaper Dagen (1899-1900) and republished in the magazine Tip-Top (1916-1918). ==Makt myrkranna== The first variant of Powers of Darkness to receive international attention was Makt myrkranna. In 1986, literary specialist Richard Dalby published a translation of the foreword to Makt myrkranna (Powers of Darkness). He believed the Icelandic book edition by publisher Nokkrir Prentarar (August 1901) to be the first foreign translation of Bram Stoker's vampire novel, which had been released in London on 26 May 1897. In fact, as pointed out by Prof. Jenő Farkas in 2010, the first translation of Dracula was into Hungarian by the writer and newspaper publisher Jenő Rákosi, who serialized a translation of Dracula in the Budapest newspaper Budapesti Hírlap (79 parts, starting on 1 January 1898), later that year published in book form. Dalby characterised the Icelandic text as a strongly abridged version of the English original, only notable because a new, extended preface by Bram Stoker had been added. Without further examination, this assessment was adopted by all English-speaking Dracula experts, and \\"Stoker's Icelandic foreword,\\" mentioning the crimes by Jack the Ripper, started playing a major role in academic Dracula exegesis. In January 2014, the Dutch literary researcher Hans Corneel de Roos unearthed the original text of Makt myrkranna as originally serialized in Fjallkonan (Lady of the Mountain). He discovered that the Icelandic version was no (abridged) translation of Dracula at all, but featured a modified plot. Harker's adventures in Transylvania were described in an extended Part I, in the journal format known from Dracula, while Part II, set in Hungary, Transylvania, Whitby and London, read like a sketch-like cauda, with only 9,100 words. New characters had been added, such as a mute and deaf housekeeper woman, two detectives (Barrington and Tellet), a dark-eyed Countess Ida Varkony, Prince Koromezzo, the ravenous Mme. Saint-Amand, the hunchback violinist Giuseppe Leonardi, Lucy's uncle Morton and Arthur's sister Mary. Harker's host was named \\"Count Drakulitz,\\" who engaged in financing and organizing an international conspiracy aiming at overthrowing Western democracy, and vented Social-Darwinist ideas; he also acted as the high priest of a clan of ape-like followers, sacrificing half-nude girls during gruesome rituals in a secret temple underneath the castle. All in all, the Icelandic text showed to be less sentimental and more to the point than Dracula, with a heightened erotic stance. De Roos announced these findings in February 2014 in Letter of Castle Dracula, before starting to work on a complete translation from Icelandic to English. ==Mörkrets makter== Although six months older than Makt myrkranna, the Swedish Dracula adaptation remained unknown to international scholars until after Powers of Darkness by De Roos was published on 7 February 2017, with a preface by Dacre Stoker. The book attracted international attention, and ten days later, De Roos and Stoker were contacted by Swedish fantasy fiction specialist Rickard Berghorn, who claimed that Makt myrkranna must be based on an earlier serialization in the Swedish newspaper Dagen (The Day) under the title Mörkrets makter (equally meaning Powers of Darkness), from 10 June 1899 to 7 February 1900.Email from Berghorn to De Roos, 17 February 2017. In his interview with De Roos, Berghorn stated that Mörkrets makter was much longer than the ca. 160,000 words of Stoker's English Dracula, and - unlike Makt myrkranna - upheld the epistolary style known from Dracula throughout the novel. Checking these claims against scans he obtained directly from Stockholm, De Roos established that there must have existed two different Swedish variants.Various emails from De Roos to Berghorn and others, 11-13 March 2017 It soon turned out that the second serialization of Mörkrets makter, in the tabloid Aftonbladets Halfvecko-Upplaga (Evening Paper's Half- Weekly), from 16 August 1899 – 31 March 1900, as first obtained by De Roos, had been shortened to ca. 107,000 words, while dropping the diary style after Part I. Dagen, the sister paper Aftonbladet, and the Aftonbladets Halfvecko- Upplaga were owned by the same publishing company with the same editor, Harald Sohlman;Emails from De Roos to Rickard Berghorn, Dacre Stoker and others, 3 March 2017. Dagen was a daily Stockholm newspaper while Aftonbladets Halfvecko-Upplaga was a tabloid published twice a week for rural areas. As the structure of the Icelandic version corresponded to that of the abridged Halfvecko-Upplaga variant (same chapter titles, no epistolary format in Part II), De Roos concluded that Ásmundsson must have used the latter as his source text, replacing various cultural references with hints to Icelandic sagas, while shortening the text even further, to ca. 47,000 words. ==Differences between Dracula and Powers of Darkness== The plots of the two Swedish variants and the Icelandic version are essentially the same, and all differ from Stoker's Dracula, especially after the section describing Harker's stay at the Count's castle. In the Dagen and the Halfvecko-Upplaga variants, this first section is identical, and even was printed from the same print stock. In the Dagen variant, the following sections, maintaining the diary style of Part I, are rather wordy, while the Halfvecko-Upplaga variant, switching to a conventional narrative style, contains less dialogue and details. In the Icelandic version, Part I is only slightly shorter than in the two Swedish variants. In Part II, Makt myrkranna follows the Halfvecko-Upplaga variant, but reduces the text by more than 50%. As noticed by De Roos, this causes some loss of detail. In the Italian edition of Powers of Darkness, de Roos has added extra notes to explain such details.De Roos, Hans Corneel, updated introduction \\"Makt Myrkranna—non c'è due senza tre\\" (Makt Myrkranna—A triplet comes seldom alone) in the Italian translation of Powers of Darkness. Milan: Carbonio Editore, 2019:21-56. The annotation was equally updated. Written in April 2017, last updated 9 October 2018. The main differences between Dracula on the one hand, the Swedish and Icelandic variants on the other hand are:All differences quoted from De Roos, \\"Makt myrkranna: Mother Of All Dracula Modifications?\\" (4 Febr. 2014) and his introduction to Powers of Darkness (Febr. 2017). * In Dracula, Harker soon feels repulsed by the Count's \\"brides.\\" In the Nordic variants, he is continuously attracted to her and disobeys the Count's instructions to meet her secretly at various occasions. This and other elements add to an erotic atmosphere almost absent from Dracula. * In Dracula, the Count lives alone at his castle. In the Nordic variants, he has a deaf and mute housekeeper woman who cooks and serves Harker's meals, and he has a clan of followers. * In Dracula, the emphasis is on the Count's vampire nature, which forces him to drink the blood of his victims. Apart from a single scene in which Harker cuts himself while shaving, the Nordic Count focuses on his elitist political goals; during the sacrificial rituals, he does not drink the blood of the murdered girl. * In the Nordic variants, it is Mina, together with Harker's employer Hawkins and the detectives Tellet and Barrington, who conducts investigations in Transylvania and visits Castle Dracula. Mina is never attacked by Dracula, and Van Helsing's crew does not travel to Eastern Europe to eliminate the Count. Instead, the story ends while the Count is still in London. * In the Whitby and London sections of Dracula, the Count hardly appears in public; he is an invisible threat lurking in the shadows. In the Nordic versions, the vampire has pleasant chats with Mina and Lucy at the Whitby graveyard, openly visits Lucy when she is sick, and hosts a grand party with international guests at his Carfax estate. * In Dracula, the police never play an active role, while in the Nordic versions, they investigate the death of Lucy and her mother and two detectives join the ranks of Dracula's enemies. In the Swedish variants, the Hungarian Secret Police also play an active role. Despite these significant differences, the Nordic versions are clearly based on Stoker's 1897 narrative and - unlike later movie adaptations - include all of its main characters. The shortened ending and the Count's public appearance as an elegant socialite seem to anticipate the adaptations made for the 1931 Dracula film with Bela Lugosi. About Makt myrkranna, the shortest variant, De Roos wrote: \\"Although Dracula received positive reviews in most newspapers of the day... the original novel can be tedious and meandering... Powers of Darkness, by contrast, is written in a concise, punchy style; each scene adds to the progress of the plot\\". Remarkable is that Ásmundsson removed Dracula's favorable mentioning of the Viking berserkers as bloodthirsty warriors, although Makt myrkranna added various elements from the Icelandic sagas.First noted by De Roos in his annotation of Powers of Darkness (2017), note 308. Notes on references to Icelandic sagas added by Ásmundsson can be found throughout his detailed annotation. Likewise, Ásmundsson removed the vampire's power to shape-shift into an animal, even though Dracula's shape-shifting ability came from Icelandic folklore; Stoker had been inspired by The Book of Were-Wolves by Sabine Baring-Gould, who had lived in Iceland for a time. ==The Swedish Count as a Social Darwinist== Already in his 2014 essay, De Roos noted that in Makt myrkranna, the Count strongly expressed elitist and Social- Darwinist opinions. While discussing his family portraits at the gallery with Harker, he explains how the strong have the right to rule over the weaker and exploit them. In his analysis of November 2017, Berghorn elaborates on this observation, explaining that the völkisch movement had emerged as a major force in Germany by the 1890s and already some of the völkisch leaders were advocating killing the mentally and physically disabled as their very existence threatened the purity of the Herrenvolk (\\"master race\\"). Putting such Social Darwinist and racist language into the mouth of Count Dracula was a way of caricaturing the popularity of Social Darwinism with elites in both Europe and the United States in the 1890s. Before he goes insane, Dr. Seward thinks after reading a newspaper about the state of the world: > \\"By the way, the telegram section of the newspaper announces several strange > news – lunatic behavior and deadly riots, organized by anti-Semites, in both > Russia and Galicia as well as southern France – plundered stores, slain > people – general insecurity of life and property – and the most fabulous > tall tales about \\"ritual murders,\\" abducted children and other unspeakable > crimes, all of which is ascribed in earnestness to the poor Jews, while > influential newspapers are instigating an all-encompassing extermination war > against the \\"Israelites.\\" You would think this is in the midst of the Dark > Ages!...Now, once again, it seems that a so-called \\"Orlean\\" conspiracy is > tracked down – while at the same time the free Republicans in France are > celebrating with exaltation the exponent of slavery and despotism in the > East...It is a strange time in which we live, that is sure and true.--- > Sometimes it seems to me as if all the insane fantasies, all the crazy > ideas, the whole world of crazed and scattered notions, into which I, as a > madhouse doctor, for years have been forced to enter in the care of my poor > patients, now begin to take shape and form and gain practice in the course > of the world's major events and tendency\\". Passages such as this, Berghorn believes, reflect the widespread mood of pessimism in fin de siècle Europe as the 19th century closed and the 20th century began, as many in Europe believed that civilization was rotten to the core, and all that was left for European civilization now was the apocalypse. ==Similarities with Stoker's preparatory notes for Dracula.== Already in his first essay on Makt myrkranna, De Roos noted a number of parallels between the Icelandic plot and Stoker's preparatory notes for Dracula. Some of these early ideas, such as an evening party with the Count entering as the last guest, the use of a “secret room – coloured like blood,” the appearance of a silent housekeeper woman, or the active role of a police inspector, did not appear in the published version of Dracula. If Ásmundsson had not invented such ideas by himself, he only could have learned about them if Stoker had shared his early ideas for the plot with him. In his blog entry of 15 February 2017, Jason Colavito questioned whether these similarities actually evidenced that Stoker provided an early draft as a basis for an Icelandic (read: Swedish) adaptation. ==The Icelandic preface== The translation of the Icelandic preface by Joel H. Emerson, published by Richard Dalby in 1986 and again in 1993, over the years has caught the attention of several Dracula scholars, especially as it seemed to suggest a link with the Ripper murders. > “But the events are incontrovertible, and so many people know of them that > they cannot be denied. This series of crimes has not yet passed from the > memory -- a series of crimes which appear to have originated from the same > source, and which at the same time created as much repugnance in people > everywhere as the murders of Jack the Ripper, which came into the story a > little later. Various people’s minds will go back to the remarkable group of > foreigners who for many seasons together played a dazzling part in the life > of the aristocracy here in London; and some will remember that one of them > disappeared suddenly without apparent reason, leaving no trace.” Emerson's rendering suggests that Jack the Ripper will actually play a role in the Icelandic story. And as Makt myrkranna was believed to be an abridged translation of Dracula, some readers started looking for (concealed) appearances of the Ripper in the original text of Dracula, and other links between Bram Stoker and the Whitechapel murders of 1888. De Roos's essay of February 2014 established that Emerson's translation was incorrect: the Icelandic text indicated that the Ripper Murders \\"happened a little later\\", that is, later than \\"[t]his series of crimes [that] has not yet passed from the memory.\\" As the Count in his conversations with Harker later mentions \\"these murdered women, these people found in sacks in the Thames,\\" De Roos suspect that \\"[t]his series of crimes [that] has not yet passed from the memory\\" refers to the unsolved Thames Torso Murders of 1887-89, that started somewhat earlier than the Whitechapel homicide spree. In his introduction to Powers of Darkness (2017), De Roos addressed a number of other errors in the Emerson/Dalby translation. == The anonymous Swedish editor/translator == Directly under the title, both the Dagen and the Halfvecko-Upplaga variants present the story as a \\"novel by Bram Stoker,\\" then explicate that it is a \\"Swedish adaptation by A-e.\\" To understand how Dracula came to Sweden and what role Stoker actually played in the creation of the Swedish variants, identifying \\"A-e\\" is a crucial step. As a \\"first guess,\\" De Roos in his correspondence with Berghorn suggested that \\"A-e\\" might stand for \\"Aftonbladets editor,\\" that is, Harald Sohlman.Email from De Roos to Berghorn, 3 March 2017 Berghorn objected that the Swedish word for \\"editor\\" is redaktör. A few weeks later, De Roos followed up with an interview in Vampirisme.com, in which he proposed Anders Albert Andersson-Edenberg (1834-1913), a senior journalist and drama translator who cooperated with Harald Sohlman within the framework of Publicistklubben, the Swedish Publicists' Association; he frequently used the pseunonym \\"A.-E.\\" During the course of 2017, De Roos published around two dozen similarities between Mörkrets makter and articles Andersson-Edenberg had previously published in Svenska Familj Journalen. In Spring 2018, De Roos summarized his findings on Andersson-Edenberg in the online magazine Vamped.org. ==Who wrote Mörkrets makter? The \\"early draft\\" thesis== In his 2014 essay, De Roos was the first to demonstrate the parallels between Makt myrkranna and Stoker's early notes. But the Dutch author also was the first to question whether Makt myrkranna (and thus the Swedish variants from which it turned out to be derived) actually was authored by Stoker. In this 2014 text and in his introduction to the annotated translation, he extensively discussed the chance that Ásmunddson had radically modified Dracula, possibly even without Stoker's consent. But as the Icelandic preface showed traces of a translation from another language, these essays finally supported the idea that at least the preface had been supplied by Stoker, while Ásmundsson may have had a hand in modifying and shortening the narrative. Even after the link with Mörkrets makter had become evident, De Roos writes, the Icelandic prefaces continues to contain some riddles, now regarding the role of the Swedish translator/editor: How could \\"A-e\\" have learned about the Thames Torso Murders, that were hardly mentioned in the Swedish press? Why did \\"A-e\\" single Van Helsing out as a \\"real person,\\" just as Stoker had done in his interview with Jane Stoddart? Why would \\"A-e\\" have used a Hamlet quote - a stage play Stoker knew by heart? === David Skal's support for the \\"early draft\\" thesis === Echoing De Roos's discovery of parallels between Makt myrkranna and Stoker's early notes, Stoker biographer David J. Skal mentioned that Stoker's notes list the character of a police inspector. As no such police inspector is featured in Dracula, Ásmundsson could have only learned about him from using an early draft of Dracula as his source, Skal claimed. Similarly, he believed the Count's deaf and mute housekeeper to be taken from such a draft. By now, the discovery of the link between Makt myrkranna and Mörkrets makter has rendered Skal's suspicions about Ásmundsson's role obsolete. But as Makt myrkranna was based on the Swedish Halfvecko text, in turn derived from the Dagen serialization, these parallels now apply to all three Nordic variants, and raise the question whether \\"A-e\\" (instead of Ásmundsson) was familiar with Stoker's early ideas for the plot, or even had received an early draft from England. === The relationship with Dracula's Guest === In his analysis of December 2017, Berghorn pointed to the short story Dracula's Guest (published posthumously in 1914), claiming that Dracula's Guest originally was a chapter from Dracula, but was removed from the final draft. Although this theory is disputed, Berghorn adopted the idea that Mörkrets makter was based upon an abandoned early draft of Dracula. Especially, he believed that the mysterious blond vampire girl from Mörkrets makter/Makt myrkranna is based on the Countess Dolingen of Gratz, and on the blonde vampire bride from Dracula. He further argues that the ornate, flowery style of Dracula's Guest, written in 1892, resembles more closely the style of Mörkrets makter than that of Dracula. He concludes that Mörkrets makter was based upon a draft Stoker may have written in the early 1890s. The argument of a \\"flowery style,\\" however, might well apply to the rather verbose Dagen version, but does not fit the shortened Halfvecko-Upplaga variant. === The \\"early draft\\" thesis and chronological arguments === Berghhorn further proposed that \\"A-e\\" modified Stoker's text as he or she translated it, and noted that Stoker picked the names for his main characters already between 1890–92; the same names, with minimal variations, appear in Mörkrets makter. Berghorn also noted that in the account of the black mass and human sacrifice performed by Draculitz in Mörkrets makter, the scene is described as being lit by flames similar to the flickering lights of a cinematograph, the first film projector only invented in 1895 and not used commercially until 1896. On chronological grounds, Berghorn felt that the reference to a cinematograph was added in by \\"A-e\\" rather being based upon an early draft by Stoker from the early 1890s. Along the same lines, he concluded that several topical political references in Mörkrets makter such as the anti- Semitic riots in France caused by the Dreyfus affair; the Franco-Russian alliance, which was signed in 1894; and the 1898 \\"Orlean\\" conspiracy\\" for a royalist coup de etat in France must have been the work of \\"A-e\\". Other elements of Mörkrets makter, according to Berghorn, must have been come from Stoker himself, such as the highly favorable references to William Ewart Gladstone, who was Stoker's political hero. As to how an early draft of Dracula might have ended up in Sweden, Berghorn presented his \\"very strong working hypothesis\\" that the writer Anne Charlotte Leffler and her mathematician brother Gösta Mittag-Leffler, both of whom were friends of the Stoker family, had \\"something to do with it.\\" To further support his theory, Berghorn copied the parallels with Stoker's early notes, as first worded by De Roos, to his own his essay of November 2017, adding a further example regarding Lucy's brooch. === Dracula's connection with the London East End === In his book contribution \\"Dracula and the Psychic World of the East End of London,\\" Clive Bloom noted that the Dracula of Makt myrkranna is more closely associated with the East End of London than he is in Dracula, which he argued was meant to link the Count to Jack the Ripper, and to the East End as a \\"wild frontier\\" region of Britain. In the Victorian era, the East End was a center of poverty, disease and crime, especially prostitution. Given the preexisting popular image of the East End as a place of crime and sexual depravity, the \\"Jack the Ripper\\" murders of 1888 with five prostitutes gruesomely murdered caught the public's imagination as a symbol of \\"sexual danger\\" associated with London and above all the East End. Bloom also noted that the popular descriptions of the exotic \\"Oriental\\" Ashkenazi Jewish prostitutes from Eastern Europe, whose \\"voluptuousness\\" and dark looks made them popular with johns on the East End, matched the descriptions of the Count's female followers in both Makt myrkranna and Dracula. Bloom further argued that the description of the eroticism of Lucy after she is turned into a vampire by Dracula in both Dracula and even more so in Makt Myrkranna closely resembled the descriptions of the eroticism of the stereotype of the exotic \\"Oriental\\" Jewish prostitute found in contemporary Victorian accounts. Still unaware of the \\"Swedish connection\\" at the time he wrote his book contribution, Bloom argued that the way in which Makt Myrkranna echoed British fears and fascination with the \\"frontier\\" of the East End supports the \\"early draft\\" theory. In his eyes, it was unlikely that an Icelander like Ásmundsson would have been as interested in the East End as Stoker was. == Newest developments: parts of the Swedish preface plagiarized from the memoirs of a pastor == In May 2018, De Roos set out to create an English and German translation of the Swedish preface, which - unlike the Icelandic preface - continued after the Hamlet quote. He discovered that especially the last part, omitted from Makt myrkranna, was almost literally copied from the memoirs of a Lutheran pastor, Bernhard Wadstörm. This part of his memoirs had been released in March 1899, three months before the preface to Mörkrets makter appeared in Dagen. Furthermore, De Roos identified various elements in the main text of Mörkrets makter that seemed to be inspired by Wadström's memoirs, such as the appearance of a \\"White Lady\\" and the viewing of a fiery sky from a gallery placed on the top floor. As De Roos deems it highly improbable that Bram Stoker himself would have inserted these elements from a Swedish publication, or would have consented to such a plagiarism, he raises severe doubts whether Bram Stoker ever was aware of the Swedish serializations. Based on this discovery and the similarities with Andersson-Edenberg's articles in Svensk Familj Journalen, he now is open to the possibility that Mörkrets makter was a piracy production, with its own literary qualities. As Mörkrets makter and Makt myrkranna change Lucy's surname from \\"Westenra\\" to \\"Western,\\" just like in the announcements of the first American serialization of Dracula in the newspaper Chicago Inter Ocean (7 May-4 June 1899), in May 2017 De Roos suggested that \\"A-e\\" may have seen the American newspaper text or even may have used it as a source text for creating his/her own adaptation, instead of a copy of the British Constable edition. In a conference presentation in October 2018, De Roos outlined the possible links between the Hungarian, the Swedish and the US newspaper serializations, based on an analysis of growing international press cooperation in the 1890s.De Roos, Hans Corneel.\\"Early Serializations and Translations of Dracula, and the Internationalization Of The Press 1890-1900.

After checking the reults of the first round, De Roos organized a second one, then collected the remaining translation problems, which he resolved with the help of further volunteers, the Cleasby & Vigfusson Old Norse to English Dictionary and the Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies. Pienette Coetzee and Lounette Loubser helped giving the English result a native English flow.http://powersofdarkness.com/ Further rounds of editing followed with the help of Allison Devereux and John Edgar Browning. In this sense, this was an example of a crowd-sourced translation. In each stage, however, De Roos kept the final say. ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== *Berni, Simone Dracula by Bram Stoker The Mystery of The Early Editions, Morrisville: Lulu, 2016, . *Bloom, Clive \\"Dracula and the Psychic World of the East End of London\\" pages 119-139 from Dracula: An International Perspective, New York: Springer, 2017, . *Crișan, Marius-Mircea \\"\\"Welcome to My House: Enter Freely of your own will\\": Dracula in International Contexts\\" pages 1-21 from Dracula: An International Perspective, New York: Springer, 2017, . *De Roos, Hans Corneel \\"Count Dracula's Address and Lifetime Identity\\" pages 95-118 from Dracula: An International Perspective, New York: Springer, 2017, . *Skal, David Something in the Blood: The Untold Story of Bram Stoker, the Man Who Wrote Dracula, New York: Liveright, 2016, . *Stedman Jones, Gareth Outcast London: A Study in the Relationship Between Classes in Victorian Society, London: Verso, 1971, *Walkowitz Judith R.

It is notable for being one of the few titles by Toaplan that has not received any official port to home consoles as of date. Set on the colonized fictional planet of Dino in the future, where an alien race of metallic robots have invaded a police communication center and held its inhabitants as hostages, players assume the role of two fighter pilots taking control of the Sylfers bomber space fighter crafts in an revenge attempt to overthrow the invaders and free the surviving colonists after one of their comrades is killed by one of them during a reconnaissance assignment. Headed by Tamsoft co-founder and Battle Arena Toshinden producer Toshiaki Ōta, Dogyuun was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Toaplan such as Snow Bros. and who would later go on to work at one of its offshoots after the company declared bankruptcy in 1994, putting emphasis on visuals instead of gameplay. The team originally planned on making a mecha title but later settled on doing a vertically scrolling shooter instead after initial testings of the mech game proved to be unsuccessful, while integrating some of their original ideas from the former project into the final release. It also marked the debut of mangaka and Knuckle Bash designer Junya Inoue in the video game industry, serving as one of its graphic designers. Dogyuun has been praised by reviewers for its visuals, sound design, gameplay, multiplayer, challenge and overall intensity but others felt that some of its mechanics were underdeveloped and lamented the lack of a console release. As of 2019, the rights to the title is owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in 2017 by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge and now- affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other Toaplan IPs. == Gameplay == Gameplay screenshot. Dogyuun is a science fiction- themed vertically scrolling shoot 'em up game reminiscent of Aero Fighters and Recca, where players assume the role of two pilots who took a part on a reconnaissance mission on planet Dino taking control of the Sylfers bomber space fighter crafts through ten stages in a revenge effort to defeat an invading alien race of metallic robots who have captured a police communication center and its inhabitants after their comrade, Kyle, was killed by one of them as the main objective.Dogyuun arcade flyer (Toaplan, EU) As far as vertical scrolling shooters go, the game initially appears to be very standard; Players start with a single laser beam that can be held on at close range for dealing minimal damage against enemies when not firing and other weapons can be acquired by destroying incoming carriers, ranging from homing lasers to a lightning beam, which can be distinguished by their color. If a weapon module of the same color is picked up, a 5000-point bonus is granted. A unique gameplay feature is the \\"Unit Beam\\" system; players have the ability to combine the two ships into one and increase their firepower much further than normal but this can also prove to be a highly risky proposition, however, as both ships can be destroyed by a single enemy fire or colliding against enemies but players are able to detach their ships at any given time. When separated, players are also able to capture a small enemy to gain points continually or hold items for later use. There are only two types of item modules that can be attached to the ships; A single-use bomb module capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its blast radius that can also be triggered after taking enemy hits and a speed module that enhances the ship's speed to quickly avoid enemy fire, in addition of activating a set of two satellite \\"options\\" when using the default weapon. In some occasions, players can pick up a spinning 1UP icon with two different sides, with one side that grants an extra live after being picked up and another side that grants 100000 points instead. Similar to Gun Frontier, the game hosts a number of hidden bonus secrets to be found, which is also crucial for reaching high-scores to obtain extra lives. The title uses a checkpoint in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying. The original Japanese version employs a mechanism where the difficulty will max out. Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a live and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. Although there is an ending, the game loops back to the first stage after completing the last stage as with previous shoot 'em ups from Toaplan and each loop increases in difficulty, however reaching the fifth loop results in a kill screen that crashes the arcade hardware. == Synopsis == Dogyuun takes place in a future where transmission with a police communication center at the planet Dino has ceased. Three pilots were sent for a reconnaissance assignment in order to determine the current situation before one of them, Kyle, is assaulted and killed by a metallic robot from an invading alien race, indicating that the communication center has been overrun by them and held its personnel as hostages. Seeking revenge for the death of their comrade, the two pilots embark on a full counterattack against the aliens with their Sylfers bomber crafts. == Development == Most of the artwork were hand-drawn sketches created by the development team before being transpose to pixel art graphics. Dogyuun was created by most of the same team that worked on previous projects at Toaplan such as Snow Bros. and who would also later go on to work at one of its offshoots after the company declared bankruptcy in 1994. (Translation by Gamengai. ). (Translation by Shmuplations. ). Its development was helmed by a small team at the company with producer Toshiaki Ōta, who shared the role of programmer alongside Hiroaki Furukawa and composer Tatsuya Uemura, among other people collaborating in its development. The development team at Toaplan originally had plans on making a mecha game featuring a robot as the main protagonist in order to convey the experience of destruction by using a mech but after initial testings at the company, the team felt it would not work and they settled on doing a vertically scrolling shooter instead, although Uemura has since stated that remaining work done on the scrapped mech title was repurposed into Dogyuun, whose name was suggested and approved by himself. (Translation by Gamengai. ). (Translation by Shmuplations. ). (Translation by Shmuplations. ). (Translation by Shmuplations. ). When working on the project, Uemura and the team planned on putting emphasis towards visuals capable of making impact over gameplay as a response from their audience who felt their previous efforts did not impress in terms of presentation and graphics, though Uemura would later remark that gameplay suffered as a result due to graphics taking priority during the creation period that lasted longer than previous releases from Toaplan. Uemura also stated that the main reason the game crashes after reaching the fifth loop is due to nobody in the development team being able to complete all loops. Junya Inoue designed the game's graphics in his first video game role prior to Knuckle Bash. Inoue was first introduced to the gaming industry during his youth with Capcom's Ghosts 'n Goblins and joined Toaplan in 1991 after looking at a recruitment ad from the company on Gamest. == Release == Dogyuun was released in arcades on November 1992. Early previews prior to release at events such as the 1992 AOU Show showcased several differences compared to the final game. On February 19, 1993, an album was co-published exclusively in Japan by Scitron and Pony Canyon, featuring an arranged song co-composed by Uemura and Inoue. A promotional recording sent by Toaplan to arcade operators also features arranged songs not present in the 1993 album. == Reception and legacy == Dogyuun has become a well regarded title from Toaplan by reviewers in recent years. Electronic Gaming Monthly praised its intensity, gameplay and visuals. In Japan, Game Machine listed it on their December 15, 1992 issue as being the eleventh most-successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles like Aero Fighters. GamesMaster noted its \\"fast and furious\\" action. Nick Zverloff of Hardcore Gaming 101 praised Inoue and Uemura's artwork and soundtrack respectively, challenge, weapon set and the ability to combine two ships, among other aspects but lamented the lack of a console release. Malcolm Laurie from SHMUPS! praised the detailed graphics, boss fights and soundtrack, regarding it as one of Toaplan's lesser known but best titles, although he noted the weapon system to be one of its negative points. Likewise, Illusionware's Marco D'Andrea praised its visuals and music but deemed that some of the mechanics felt underdeveloped. Den of Geek noted it to be one of the titles from Toaplan which intensively pushed the formula established by their previous endeavors. In more recent years, the rights to Dogyuun and many other IPs from Toaplan are now owned by Tatsujin, a company named after Truxton's Japanese title that was founded in 2017 by former Toaplan employee Masahiro Yuge, who are now affiliated with arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia. == Notes == == References == == External links == * Dogyuun at GameFAQs * Dogyuun at Killer List of Videogames * Dogyuun at MobyGames * Dogyuun at The Toaplan Museum Category:1992 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Arcade-only games Category:Cooperative video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Shoot 'em ups Category:Toaplan games Category:Vertically scrolling shooters Category:Video games about mecha Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Tatsuya Uemura Category:Video games set in the future Category:Video games set on fictional planets ","title":"Dogyuun"},{"id":"61703693","text":"Joseph F.

He served as a leader of Greenpeace for nearly 30 years, including two decades as Executive Director. While on a mission to stop French nuclear testing in French Polynesia, he survived France's bombing of the Greenpeace boat Rainbow Warrior, which occurred on his 29th birthday. After leaving Greenpeace, he co- founded the Global Wind Energy Council in 2007 to promote wind power, and led the organization for ten years. == Early life == Sawyer was born on July 10, 1956, in Boston, Massachusetts. His mother, Frances (Wheeler) Sawyer, was a piano teacher, and his father, Winslow Allen Sawyer, an engineer. He grew up in Antrim, New Hampshire, where he learned how to sail on Gregg Lake. He was a member of the first freshman class at ConVal Regional High School, graduating in 1974. After graduating from Haverford College in 1978 with a B.A. in philosophy, Sawyer was uncertain of what to do next and lived with friends in Boston as a hippie. When a canvasser of Greenpeace sought donations from him, he decided to join the environmentalist organization, partly because he loved the idea of working at sea. == Rainbow Warrior == Rainbow Warrior in 1981, Amsterdam Sawyer led the refitting of Greenpeace's newly acquired boat Rainbow Warrior and joined its crew in 1980 to sail on protest voyages. In 1985, the Rainbow Warrior sailed to the Pacific Ocean on the dual mission to relocate residents of Rongelap Atoll in the Marshall Islands (\\"Operation Exodus\\"), and to stop French nuclear testing on Moruroa Atoll in French Polynesia. In the 1950s, the United States tested hydrogen bombs near Rongelap. The atoll's residents were evacuated in 1954 but returned after it was declared safe in 1957. They subsequently experienced a host of serious health issues, including birth defects, thyroid disorders and cancer, but the US government denied the link between radioactivity and the islanders' problems and refused to evacuate them again. In ten days, Sawyer led the Rainbow Warrior's a dozen crew members to move 300 residents of Rongelap to Mejato Island, about away, as well as over 100 tons of livestock and building materials. It was the first major humanitarian mission of Greenpeace, which had been generally engaged in protests, and a major challenge for the small crew of the Rainbow Warrior. === Bombing of the Rainbow Warrior === Rainbow Warrior in 1985, Auckland After accomplishing Operation Exodus, Rainbow Warrior sailed to Auckland, New Zealand, on her way to French Polynesia to stop French nuclear testing. On July 10, 1985, when the crew was ashore celebrating Sawyer's 29th birthday, a bomb exploded on the ship. When photographer Fernando Pereira went back on board to retrieve his equipment, a second bomb exploded, sinking the boat and killing Pereira. The bombing led to an international outcry, and it was soon discovered that the bombs were planted by French secret agents, two of whom were arrested by New Zealand authorities and sentenced to prison. One of the bombers had attended Sawyer's party and wished him happy birthday. The French government, tainted by the scandal, admitted wrongdoing and ultimately paid Greenpeace US$8 million in damage. == Leadership of Greenpeace == Sawyer's leadership in the Rainbow Warrior mission impressed his colleagues, and he became executive director of Greenpeace USA in 1986. Two years later, he was named executive director of Greenpeace International and moved to Amsterdam, the organization's headquarters. Under his leadership, Greenpeace achieved some of its greatest victories, including a 1991 treaty forbidding oil and gas exploration in Antarctica for half a century; the Montreal Protocol to phase out chemicals that cause ozone depletion; and a treaty banning the dumping of nuclear waste at sea. Greenpeace's persistent small-boat protests eventually forced France to abandon its nuclear testing in Polynesia, and the United States off Alaska. Sawyer later shifted Greenpeace's focus to fighting climate change and promoting renewable energy. == Global Wind Energy Council == In 2007, Sawyer left Greenpeace and co-founded the Global Wind Energy Council, based in Brussels, to promote wind power. He led the organization for the next ten years, and helped develop the wind power industry in many countries, including China. == Personal life == Sawyer married Kelly Rigg, also a Greenpeace activist, in 1988. They had a daughter, Layla, and a son, Sam. Sawyer was diagnosed with lung cancer in April 2019. He died on July 31 in Amsterdam from pneumonia caused by the cancer, aged 63. == References == Category:1956 births Category:2019 deaths Category:American environmentalists Category:Activists from Massachusetts Category:People from Boston Category:Haverford College alumni Category:People associated with Greenpeace Category:American emigrants to the Netherlands Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior ","title":"Steve Sawyer"},{"id":"61703721","text":"Naumovka () is a rural locality (a selo) and the administrative center of Naumovsky Selsoviet, Sterlitamaksky District, Bashkortostan, Russia.

Under Article 126.2 of the 1991 version of the Sudanese Penal Code, apostasy is punishable by the death sentence if the accused does not repent. Al-Boushi lodged an official complaint against Youssef. Information Minister Faisal Saleh stated that Youssef's comments constituted an attack against women's rights and said that the Sudanese cabinet requested the Ministry of Justice to take \\"the necessary legal measures\\" against Youssef. ==References== Category:1986 births Category:Government ministers of Sudan Category:Women government ministers of Sudan Category:Living people Category:People of the Sudanese Revolution Category:Alumni of Imperial College London ","title":"Wala'a Essam al-Boushi"},{"id":"61703780","text":"La usurpadora may refer to: *La usurpadora (Venezuelan TV series), a 1971 Venezuelan telenovela starring Marina Baura and Raúl Amundaray. *La usurpadora (1998 TV series), a 1998 Mexican telenovela starring Gaby Spanic and Fernando Colunga. *La usurpadora (2019 TV series), a 2019 Mexican telenovela starring Sandra Echeverría and Arap Bethke. ==See also== * * * El hogar que yo robé, a 1981 Mexican remake of the series * La intrusa (1986 TV series), a 1986 Venezuelan remake of the 1971 series * ¿Quién eres tú?, a 2012 Mexican remake of the series ","title":"La usurpadora"},{"id":"61703782","text":"Laurus is a genus of evergreen trees belonging to the laurel family, Lauraceae.

Polster had an interest in music, which happened to be her undergraduate major and a subject she integrated into her work. Once reaching graduate school, she became an advocate for Gestalt therapy; a therapy aimed towards self-awareness. Polster was the co-founder of The Gestalt Training Centre. Polster was the co-author of two novels (Gestalt Therapy Integrated and From the Radical Centre), and the sole author of Eve’s Daughters. Miriam Polster died due to cancer, in 2001. ==Early life== Miriam Polster was born Miriam Friedman on July 7, 1924 to Aaron Friedman and Minnie Rachbuch, a Jewish family in Cleveland, Ohio.Parlett, M. (2002). Miriam Polster. The British Gestalt Journal, 11(1). Retrieved from https://www.britishgestaltjournal.com/shop/volume-11-1-2002-1Gold, E., & Zahm, S. (2002). At the end of the day: In memory of Miriam Polster. Gestalt Review, 6(2), 124–134. doi:10.5325/gestaltreview.6.2.0124. Polster's family was consistently described as being loving and supportive of Polster's aspirations. Her father worked for the U.S. Postal Service at the time of the Great Depression, despite having a degree in law. Her mother was a housewife. Polster had one brother who was five years older than her, Larry. ==Career== Polster's initial passion was music. She attended Miami University and completed her bachelor's degree in music in 1946. She did additional studies at the Cleveland Institute of Music in regard to vocal performance. Miriam Polster met Erving Polster in 1949, and the two were married in October. They have two children, Adam and Sarah. Both children had poor health as Adam had cerebral palsy and Sarah died from colon cancer in July 2001. In 1953, the Gestalt Institute of Cleveland was founded by key figures in the history of Gestalt theory, including Fritz Perls, Laura Perls, Isadore From, and Paul Goodman.Gestalt Institute of Cleveland. (2016, August 31). Our story. Retrieved from https://www.gestaltcleveland.org/our-story Her husband, Erving Polster, was among the founding faculty members, and his involvement in workshops that trained individuals in new Gestalt therapeutic techniques piqued her interest in psychology. Polster went back to school and received her doctorate in clinical psychology from Case Western Reserve University in 1967. ==Theory== Gestalt therapy is an experiential and humanistic approach that aims to develop self-knowledge, acceptance, and growth.Yontef, G., & Jacobs, L. (2008, January). Gestalt therapy . Retrieved November 3, 2019, from https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283407833_Gestalt_therapy. One aspect of therapy is establishing contact with the environment and self through our sensory organs which is essential to healthy development.O'Leary, E. (2013). Gestalt therapy around the world. Chichester, West Sussex, UK: John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Polster and her husband Erving Polster are responsible for furthering the development of the concept of contact-boundary. Boundaries function to help people to connect to their environment and withdraw from it when necessary. A disturbance of these boundaries can result in confluence, isolation, retroflection, introjection, projection, and deflection. Confluence refers to losing the boundary between self and others which is on the opposite spectrum of isolation in which the boundary becomes impermeable and connection to others is lost. Retroflection is restraining parts of your self from being expressed. Introjection is the passive acceptance of other people's ideas. Projection refers to attributing parts of self onto others and Deflection is the fear of conflict. All of these disturbances can fluctuate between healthy and unhealthy depending on your level of awareness.Polster, E. & Polster, M. (1973) Gestalt therapy integrated: Contours of theory and practice. New York, NY: Brunner-Mazel. ==Literature== ===1973: Gestalt Therapy Integrated: Contours of Theory and Practice=== Gestalt Therapy Integrated is the first novel written by Erving and Miriam Polster. The Polsters wanted their book to serve as an extensive overview of Gestalt theory and therapeutic techniques, a textbook on the practices of Gestalt. In addition, Erving wanted to include personal interpretations of wider Gestalt theory and incorporated his own theories, including contact-boundary. Polster did not contribute a large part of her own theories and interpretations, but she aided Erving by discussing concepts in his theories with him that had been developed through his teachings and workshops at the Gestalt Institute of Cleveland. The novel is regarded by many scholars and students as a comprehensive introductory novel to Gestalt therapy. ===1992: Eve’s Daughters: The Forbidden Heroism of Women=== Eve’s Daughters is a novel that Miriam Polster wrote alone. The novel emphasizes women's abilities to be heroes in a world that views heroism as a male dominated role. Polster explains that heroism appears in different forms. Polster mentions that the trend of gender roles, places limits to the potential of everyone. Eve’s Daughters exemplifies the discrepancies of the male and female gender through the story of Eve, and the story of Prometheus. Prometheus stole fire from the Gods and received punishment. After sanction, Prometheus was seen viewed as a brave and likeable character. In the story of Eve, she had eaten an apple despite being told otherwise by God. Unlike Prometheus, Eve is disciplined and perceived as an unlikable and disobedient figure. The novel points out that in a sense, Eve leads a wave of women making their own decisions on how they live; because of her choice to not follow an unrationalized command. Furthermore, Eve’s Daughters justifies, that Eve's story provides lessons used today (i.e. the concept of consequences following our actions).Polster, M. F. (1992). Eve's daughters: The forbidden heroism of women. San Francisco. ===1999: From the Radical Centre: The Heart of Gestalt Therapy=== From the Radical Center: The Heart of Gestalt Therapy is a novel written by Miriam and Erving Polster. It is a collection of their selected writings that covers the history of psychotherapy touching on theoretical and practical applications. The novel first sets the stage by describing the principles of Gestalt therapy, illustrating the application and transformation of the theories. They then discuss the role and implications of the community on the individual. Various aspects of theory and therapy are integrated in this novel to encompass the full spectrum of psychotherapy.Polster, E., & Polster, M. (2000). From The Radical Center: the heart of gestalt therapy (1st ed.). New York: Gestalt Press. doi: https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203766910 ==Legacy== Miriam Polster and her husband Erving Polster started out by running couple and family workshops. They led groups together but did not do so in their own fields as much. Miriam and Erving Polster founded the Gestalt Training Centre in San Diego, California. They taught and trained many professionals in Gestalt therapy all around the world. Literature stated that they were known as some of the most influential Gestalt therapists, and their training inspired others to take on Gestalt therapy training themselves. Polster was also a member of the faculty of the Gestalt Institute in Cleveland, Ohio. She was involved with the Institute before and after she was a graduate student and was present at many workshops. ==Death== In 1994, Polster was diagnosed with, and survived, both breast cancer and endometrial cancer; she died on December 19, 2001 at the age of 77 after a relapse in the endometrial cancer. ==References== Category:1924 births Category:2001 deaths Category:20th-century American writers Category:American psychologists Category:20th-century psychologists ","title":"Miriam Polster"},{"id":"61703791","text":"Daniel Clark McElroy (born July 15, 1948) is an American politician and former public official in the state of Minnesota.

The album's title means \\"the foreign traveler\\" in the Tamashek language. The album features guest appearances by Noura Mint Seymali, Micah Nelson, Cass McCombs, Stephen O'Malley, Warren Ellis, and Rodolphe Burger. The album reached number 74 on the Ultratop albums chart in Belgium. ==Background== In 2018, Tinariwen finished an international tour in support of their previous album, Elwan. They were unable to return to their home area in northern Mali due to sectarian violence and threats from Islamist militants. The group instead decamped in Morocco and embarked on a multi-month journey through Western Sahara and Mauritania, collaborating with local musicians at several stops along the way and writing songs while camped out in the desert. Upon arriving in Nouakchott they were hosted by Mauritanian singer/griot Noura Mint Seymali and her husband Jeiche Ould Chighaly. The album was recorded outdoors in the Nouakchott area with mobile equipment, with additional overdubs recorded at studios in France and Morocco. The Guardian noted that the album's unusual genesis \\"places the listener entirely within the nomadic Tinariwen universe.\\" The album's lyrics reflect the group's recent struggles in trying to return to their homeland, their journey through Western Sahara and Mauritania, and their experiences as an unlikely international touring act. ==Reception == The album received positive reviews from critics. AllMusic praised the album as \\"a testament to their unyielding collaborative spirit, and on this hybrid of an album, they again summon a common musical language while sounding as authentic as ever.\\" In the words of PopMatters, \\"No one puts the soul of the Sahara into music so intimately and ingeniously as Tinariwen, and Amadjar is a particularly well-polished jewel.\\" The A.V. Club said that the album is possibly the best of Tinariwen's career, as \\"droning songs of interlocking (and mostly acoustic) guitar come together with an appealing slowness, as if each element is steadily wandering in from the wilderness, curious about the noise and ready to join in.\\" The Times of London described the album as having \\"a sound that feels ancient, empty and slightly scary.\\" Riff Magazine praised the album as \\"the closest anyone will get to the true essence of what Tinariwen represent as a cultural and musical force.\\" Glide Magazine said \\"Amadjar brims with a true roots essence\\" and \\"speaks of unity and togetherness, an understanding that the future needs to be fought together in community and harmony.\\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== All information from album liner notes. * Ibrahim Ag Alhabib – lead vocals and lead guitar (tracks 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11) * Abdallah Ag Alhousseyni – lead vocals and lead guitar (tracks 2, 5, 7, 12, 13), backing vocals (all tracks) * Alhassane Ag Touhami – lead vocals and lead guitar (track 6), backing vocals (all tracks) * Eyadou Ag Leche – bass (all tracks), guitar (tracks 4, 9), backing vocals (all tracks) * Elaga Ag Hamid – guitar (all tracks), backing vocals (all tracks) * Said Ag Ayad – percussion (all tracks), backing vocals (all tracks), guitar (tracks 6, 9) * Noura Mint Seymali – lead vocals (track 3), ardin (tracks 2, 3, 7), backing vocals (track 7) * Amar Chaoui – percussion (all tracks) * Lala, Aicha – backing vocals (tracks 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11) * Rodolph Burger – guitar (track 8) * Warren Ellis – violin loops (tracks 1, 2, 8, 11, 12) * Cass McCombs – guitar (tracks 9, 10), backing vocals (track 9) * Micah Nelson – charango, mandolin (track 4) * Stephen O'Malley – guitar (tracks 3, 10, 12) * Jeiche Ould Chighaly – guitar (track 2) ==Charts== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\"  - ! scope=\\"col\\" Chart (2019) ! scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - } ==References== Category:2019 albums Category:Tinariwen albums Category:Anti- (record label) albums ","title":"Amadjar"},{"id":"61704212","text":"Julie Jane Storm (born February 22, 1933) is an American politician in the state of Minnesota.

Blenkinsop and Mary Kelly Blenkinsop. Her father ran a Catholic publishing house and bookstore in Baltimore. Her maternal uncle was Archbishop Oliver Kelly of Tuam. One of her brothers, Peter J. Blenkinsop, became a Jesuit priest and college president. Her other brother, William Aloysius Blenkinsop, also became a priest. The Blenkinsop family immigrated to the United States in 1826. In 1831, Catherine Blenkinsop entered the Sisters of Charity community in Emmitsburg, Maryland. == Sisters of Charity == As Sister Catherine Euphemia, she taught in Roman Catholic schools in New York City and Baltimore for more than twenty years. She was a member of the order when it united with the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul in 1850. In 1866, she succeeded her mentor Mother Ann Simeon as visitatrix of the Daughters of Charity in the United States, and mother superior of the order's Mother House, St. Joseph's Sisterhood, in Emmitsburg. She was the head of the order in 1885 when a kitchen fire badly damaged two of the buildings on their campus. == During the Civil War == During the American Civil War, the Daughters of Charity worked as nurses, treating wounded soldiers. \\"The soldiers asked one another, 'How is it that the sisters do not tremble?'\\", Blenkinsop wrote in an 1862 report. \\"Others asked the sisters what we should do if the enemy should reach us in triumph! 'We should remain at our post!'\\" Sister Euphemia was appointed to represent the order's leadership in the American South. Because written communication was difficult in wartime, she was sent in person to visit Daughters of Charity congregations in Confederate territory, at some personal risk. She spent Christmas Day, 1863, in New Orleans. == Personal life and legacy == Mother Euphemia's failing health was announced by the order in dramatic terms: \\"A sorrow is slowly approaching, as the Grim Destroyer, with stealthy steps, draws nearer and nearer to the beloved Mother's couch.\\" She died March 18, 1887, in Emmitsburg.

Eberhardt has been responsible for major contributions on investigating the consequences of the psychological association between race and crime through methods such as field studies and laboratory studies. She has also contributed to research on unconscious bias, including demonstrating how racial imagery and judgment affect culture and society within the domain of social justice. The results from her work have contributed to training law enforcement officers and state agencies to better their judgments through implicit bias training. She has also provided directions for future research in this domain and brought attention to mistreatment in communities due to biases. Eberhardt has authored Biased: Uncovering the Hidden Prejudice That Shapes What We See, Think, and Do, was a recipient of the 2014 MacArthur \\"Genius Grant\\" Fellowship, been named one of Foreign Policy's 100 Leading Global Thinkers, and has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. ==Early life == Eberhardt was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the youngest of five children. She was raised in Lee–Harvard, a predominantly African-American middle-class neighborhood. When she was twelve, her family relocated to Beachwood, Ohio. Eberhardt credits her interest in race and inequality on her family’s move from the predominantly African-American working class neighbourhood of Lee-Harvard to the white suburb of Beachwood. The two neighbourhoods differed in terms of resources and opportunities despite their close proximity. She noticed that she and her non African-American classmates experienced life differently, such as her father and brothers being pulled over more frequently than other residents. This further increased her interest in racial inequality and changed her approach to understanding the world. == Education == After graduating from Beachwood High School, she received her B.A from the University of Cincinnati in 1987. She then attended Harvard University where she received her A.M in 1990 and Ph.D 1993. She is married to Ralph Richard Banks, a law professor at Stanford University. Eberhardt and Banks were elementary schoolmates who reconnected at Harvard. They currently reside in the San Francisco Bay Area with their three sons. ==Career== From July 1993 to July 1994, Eberhardt was a postdoctoral research associate in the Social and Personality Psychology Division at the University of Massachusetts. Here, she conducted research on stereotyping and inter-group relations. She was a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Psychology at Stanford University, from September 1994 to June 1995, where she researched the impact of stereotype threat on academic performance. From July 1995 to June 1998, Eberhardt worked as an assistant professor at Yale University in the Department of Psychology and the Department of African Studies and African-American Studies. In September 1998, she accepted a teaching position at Stanford University in the Department of Psychology as an assistant professor. In May 2005, she was appointed as an associate professor, and at some point she became a full professor. Eberhardt is also the co-director and faculty co-founder of Stanford’s SPARQ (Social Psychological Answers to Real-World Questions) program. This center at Stanford brings together many industry leaders, researchers and well known faces in society to inspire cultural changes using insights from the behavioral sciences. Through SPARQ, Eberhardt demonstrates the consequences of racial associations in criminal justice, education and business. == Research == === Implicit bias === Eberhardt and her colleagues developed research that introduced alternative approaches to considering race and ethnicity. In 2008, she published a study that sought to examine how the variations in beliefs regarding the root of racial differences can impact social interactions. The study’s findings revealed that those who believed racial differences arise due to biological differences differed from those who looked at race as a social construct. Those who view racial differences as biologically influenced are, according to this study, less likely to express interest in interracial relationships. These people were also at a higher risk of promoting race-based stereotypes, were less likely to set aside inequalities and defended these inequalities as a product of innate racial differences. When people perceive racial differences as biologically determined, they create strict barriers between themselves and racial out-groups. This impacts the well-being of members of historically disadvantaged racial groups. Golby and Eberhardt’s research focused on why humans are more likely to recognize people in their own race over those in another race. African-American and European-American subjects looked at images of unfamiliar African-American and European-American faces while getting fMRI scans. There was 1.5 times more activation in the right hemisphere of the brain, specifically the fusiform face areas (FFAs), when looking at same-race faces. Another finding was that memory recognition was greater for recognizing same-race faces in European-Americans which showed higher activation in the left fusiform cortex and the right hippocampal and parahippocampal regions. This demonstrates that own- and other-race faces stimulate differential activation in the FFAs, however it does not explain why activation for same-race faces takes place in right side of the brain and memory encoding takes place in the left side of the brain. This can be an area for future research. === Criminal justice === Eberhardt’s research demonstrated how the automatic effect of implicit racial stereotypes impacts one’s visual processing. A series of studies focusing on priming were conducted, specifically priming individuals with images related to crime. The intention was to see whether individuals would focus on White or Black faces when cued for crime. The study showed that people and officers specifically focused more on Black faces. The next study focused solely on officers who were separated into two groups, those who were primed for crime and those who weren’t. They were presented with a picture of a Black or White suspect and were asked to complete a memory task where they had to identify the suspect in a lineup with other suspects of the same race. Some lineups had suspects with highly stereotypical features of each respective race, whereas others had less stereotypical facial features. Crime-primed officers who viewed a Black suspect misremembered the suspect with someone who had more stereotypical Black features; but crime primed officers who saw a White suspect were less likely to identify a less stereotypical White suspect and more likely to associate it with a more stereotypical Black face. Eberhardt’s research shows how racial associations can impact the public's perception of Black people and crime and how this can influence how White people would misremember or neglect evidence that isn’t accurate for a Black defendant. This also introduces future directions for research such as the cognitive accessibility of primed information. In a 2006 study, Eberhardt and her colleagues examined databases in Philadelphia which examined whether the likelihood of being sentenced to death is related to the defendant looking stereotypically Black (thick lips, dark skin, dark hair, broad noses) when the victim was either Black or White. Those who were stereotypically Black were sentenced to death 57.5 percent of the time compared to 24.4 percent of the lighter African-Americans, especially if the victims were White. This research provides evidence that physical traits alone can influence sentencing decisions to quite an extent. In a related 2008 study, Eberhardt and her colleagues conducted an analysis on printed newspaper articles regarding Caucasian and African-American convicts in line for the death penalty. This study was rooted in the notion that African-American males are frequently wrongly accused, misjudged and wrongfully remembered as aggressors. During the analysis of the newspaper articles, the researchers’ main focus was on detecting “ape imagery” (this included characterizing a person as a beast, hairy, wild). They found this imagery was significantly more common for African-Americans than Caucasians. In the case of African-Americans, the ape imagery also predicted who would be sentenced to the death penalty. The research done by Eberhardt demonstrated not only the mistreatment of African-American detainees, but also the lack of civil rights available to members of other lower-status groups who are often misjudged as aggressors. In 2012, Eberhardt and colleagues studied how racial stereotypes can affect a juror’s perception of the legal distinction between a juvenile and adult criminal offender. Participants read non-homicide case studies depicting either a Black or White juvenile offender. They found White Americans were more likely to support severe sentences when they read case studies depicting a Black juvenile offender than when the offender’s race was changed to White. This was because white offenders’ behaviour was more likely to be attributed to youthful indiscretion while Black offenders were more likely to be perceived as having the maturity and criminal intentions of adults. In another study in 2014, Eberhardt and Hetey (a Stanford University colleague) examined how just the mere exposure of racial disparities can impact an individual's support for harsh criminal justice policies. White participants were split into two groups, in group one they watched a video clip in which 25 percent of the images were of Black inmates and in group two, 45 percent of the images were of Black inmates. They were then informed of strict criminal laws abiding in the state of California, followed by a petition form to sign to amend the laws and make them less harsh. From group one, more than 50 percent of the participants signed the petition, whereas only 28 percent of group two agreed to sign it. In 2015, The Oakland Police Department committed to participate in President Barack Obama’s Police Data Initiative. Through SPARQ, Eberhardt worked with the Oakland Police Department to analyze police stop data for racial disparities. They used computational linguistics to assess interactions between officers and members of the Oakland community. Although they found no explicit bias, they found that when speaking to white drivers, officers were reassuring, used positive words, and expressed concern for safety. In contrast, when officers were speaking to Black drivers, they more often used negative terms, stuttered, used informal language, and used less explanatory terms. The researchers made fifty recommendations for critical changes within the Oakland Police Department, many of which have been implemented as of the report’s 2017 release. The recommendations create a model that spans four categories: data analysis, policies and practices, training, and community engagement. As of 2017, Eberhardt and her team have since given bias training to ninety percent of the Oakland Police Department’s officers. === Bias in the education system === Okonofua and Eberhardt (2015) examined teachers' responses to students' misbehaviors, and whether there were racial differences in how these responses were directed. The study discovered teachers' responses contributed to racial disparities in discipline in the sense that Black students are more likely to be labeled as \\"troublemakers\\" than White students. It was also found that when students of color and White students commit similar behaviors, the behaviors are viewed as being more serious for students of color. Black students' misbehaviors are more likely to be viewed as a pattern than White students. The study also found that responses given by teachers may potentially drive racial differences in students' behaviors. In 2016, Okonofua, Walton, and Eberhardt ran a meta- analysis on past research literature examining how social-psychological factors play a role in the structure of racial disparities in teacher-student relationships. Findings in the research suggest pervasive negative stereotypes may give rise to mistrustful relationships between racially stigmatized students and teachers. For example, in instances where Black students are often given the label of ‘troublemakers’, students may feel stigmatized and have distrust for teachers, thus they are more likely to misbehave in the future. As a result, such teachers' interactions with students through frequent labelling can potentially produce a never-ending cycle of increased punishment and misbehaviors. Due to such issue, a discipline gap is produced, which results in Black students having less opportunity to learn. The meta- analysis also noted an approach that has been implemented in over 7000 schools in the U.S. called the Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports approach (PBIS), the authors argued although the approach aims to improve students’ behavior, the subject of positive teacher-student relationship is neglected. Therefore, future interventions should aim to solve psychological barriers in order to reinforce positive teacher-student relationships rather than placing the majority of emphasis on teaching social skills, or prescriptive rules. ==Awards== Eberhardt has received numerous awards: #National Academy of Education Spencer Postdoctoral Fellowship, 1995. #* Awarded for active contributions and efforts in researching prejudice and discrimination faced by Black students in academic settings. # Irvine Postdoctoral Teaching Fellowship, September 1995 - June 1996. # Junior Faculty Fellowship at Yale University, 1997. # Distinguished Alumnae Award at the University of Cincinnati, 2002. # Junior Faculty Professional Development Award at the Research Institute of Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity (RICSRE) of Stanford University, 2003- 2004. # Residential Fellow – Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford, CA, 2005-2006. # Gordon and Pattie Faculty Fellow at Stanford University in the School of Humanities and Sciences, 2006-2007. # Dean’s Award for Distinguished Achievements in Teaching at Stanford University, 2006-2007 and 2010-2011. # Clayman Institute for Gender Research at the Faculty Research Fellow at Stanford University, 2010-2011. # Institute for Research in the Social Sciences (IRiSS) Faculty Fellow at Stanford University, 2012-2013. #MacArthur Fellowship from the John D. and Catherine T.

In 1975 Pope Paul VI named him Permanent Observer of the Holy See to UNESCO. Throughout his tenure in that position he invited a variety of Church prelates to head the Holy See's delegation to UNESCO's annual meeting, either an Apostolic Nuncio, an official of the Secretariat of State, or a senior official of the Roman Curia. Frana allowed himself to take this role only once. In anticipation of his retirement the next year, he delivered the Holy See's principal address to a UNESCO meeting in October 2001. His tenure as Permanent Observer ended with the appointment of his successor on 11 May 2002. He retired to Gandino where he died in a retirement home on 7 November 2005, at the age of 79.

They stayed there until May 1940, returning to Paris on foot. Her family became supporters of Charles de Gaulle's Free French Army. Moet-Agniel's activities in the Resistance began with graffiti art near the Porte de Vincennes of the Free French emblem. In November, Moet-Agniel's former English teacher gave tasked her with retrieving a bundle of leaflets from Versailles and distributing them. From their home in Saint-Mandé, the Moets hid French, British, and American soldiers and provided them with false documents for the Burgundy Network. Moet-Agniel's father, working at his local town hall, forged and recycled the documents of deceased French citizens so that the errant Allied personnel could receive German- rationed food. In October 1943, aged 17, Moet-Agniel accompanied a member of her network to Britain and would personally assist downed Allied aviators getting to England. ===Arrest and deportation=== On 28 April 1944, German officials arrested the Moets with two Englishmen.

Familial multiple lipomatosis is a hereditary adipose tissue disorder that is characterized by the formation of multiple lipomas that occur in a particular distribution. The lipomas are well-encapsulated, slow-growing, benign fatty tumors. The distribution is defined as being focused in the trunk of the body and extremities. Familial Multiple Lipomatosis can be identified when multiple lipomas occur in multiple family members that span different generations. Some people may have hundreds of lipomas present. == Symptoms == The source of this disease is from family history, and symptoms most often arise in middle age. Newly formed lipomas frequently present themselves as a bead-like lump under the skin, and become rubbery and movable. They may be seen throughout the body and in some areas more than others, however, it does not make an appearance on the head or shoulders of the individual. The size of those bumps may vary and could possibly get in the way of an individual living their life peacefully. There are usually no feelings of discomfort or pain unless a lipoma has been aggravated or is directly on a nerve. Lipomas that sit over bony areas such as the ribs and lower back can cause discomfort when lying down or receiving any kind of pressure. The age at which familial multiple lipomatosis begins to make an appearance on the individual’s body varies; for some it may be as early as 5 years of age. == Diagnosis == Lipoma ultrasound 110322120428 1206550 Familial multiple lipomatosis is usually diagnosed through a physical exam via palpation, medical history and imaging studies such as ultrasound, CT scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A CT scan is an imaging method that uses x-rays to create images of cross sections of the body, while an MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create images of lipomas and surrounding tissues. Both tests are useful to establish the diagnosis of multiple symmetric lipomatosis, although magnetic resonance imaging provides more details and may be used when lipomas are large, deep, or have infiltrated muscle fibers or nerves. In some cases, a biopsy of the lipomas may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. === Differential diagnoses === •Liposarcoma •Dercum’s disease •Benign symmetric lipomatosis •Madelung’s disease •Cyst == Causes == The exact cause of FML is not yet known, but there are several theories of different causes: *Hormonal disorder due to the body's inability to properly metabolize fat *Increase in fat cells (adipocytes) *Enzymatic defect or a change in the surface of the cells that could prevent the breakdown of fat *Poor lymphatic drainage *Defective regulation of mitochondria in brown fat. Brown fat is responsible for causing heat in times of stress or cold. For general callus tissue is stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system and this response is mediated by a substance called norepinephrine. This process occurs in the mitochondria *In most families, the mode of inheritance has not been determined. However, changes (mutations) in mitochondrial DNA that involve the MT-TK gene have been identified in some families who have the disease and other conditions that affect many different body systems. == Treatment == alt= The only effective treatments for lipomas caused by familial multiple lipomatosis are liposuction or surgical removal. Steroid injections may also be used to shrink the tumors by causing local fat atrophy. Patients with the condition often seek removal when the lipomas are large, disfiguring, or cause pain. This may be done by a dermatologist or other surgeon. In the majority of cases where one to a few subcutaneous lipomas are being excised, the procedure is done under local anaesthetic and the patient can resume most normal activities immediately afterward. Over-the- counter pain medications are generally sufficient in the following days and long-term scarring is minimal. Regrowth is rare because lipomas are usually well-encapsulated and are therefore removed entirely although more new lipomas may start to grow in the same area. Therapeutic treatments that are recommended for adipose tissue disorders include improving lymphatic flow through exercise and massage, following an anti-inflammatory diet, and reducing non-disordered fat tissue when necessary . Weight loss has not been shown to eliminate lipomas but may help reduce overall inflammation and influence hormone levels. While there is no total cure for FML to stop the growth of new lipomas, most of the growths can remain untreated and rarely cause medical complications. == In the media == * April Wesson / Dr. Pimple Popper Season 2 Episode 1: “Nose No Bounds\\" on January 3, 2019 * Olivia Buckland / Love Island 2016: After 4 years of building the courage to get it checked, the lump located near the star’s left armpit was discovered to be a lipoma, which was removed before her wedding == References == Category:Lipid metabolism disorders ","title":"Familial multiple lipomatosis"},{"id":"61704675","text":"Evgenia A.

This is primarily visible in the Icelandic Monument found in Spanish Fork, as well as the festivals that have been held over the years to pay tribute to the Icelandic people who helped establish Spanish Fork. == Icelanders in Spanish Fork == There was a large religious component in the motivation of the early Icelandic settlers coming to Utah. A majority of the Icelandic people that settled in Spanish Fork were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, especially in the earlier years. These people learned of the Church while they were still in Iceland. The first people to bring word of the Church to the Vestmannaeyjar (Westman Islands), which is where many of these Icelandic immigrants lived before they came to America, were Thorarinn Haflidason and Gudmundur Gudmundsson. They had learned about the religion while they were in Denmark learning trade.Björnsson, Björn G. 1995. \\"The Promised Land.\\" Iceland: Saga Film Productions. https://catalog.spanishfork.bywatersolutions.com/cgi-bin/koha/opac- detail.pl?biblionumber=25723&query;_desc=kw%2Cwrdl%3A%20iceland%20and%20spanish%20forkSimundsson, Elva, and Nelson Gerrard.

The people who converted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints later moved from Iceland to Utah because that was the location of the Church headquarters, and prosperity was promised to the members who moved there. Vestmannaeyjar (Vestmannaeyjar) === Early life of the Icelanders in Spanish Fork === Spanish Fork Pioneer Cabin After first traveling to Salt Lake City, Utah and being directed by Brigham Young, the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to go south, the first three Icelandic settlers, Samuel and Margret Bjarnson and Helga Joónsdoóttir, arrived in Spanish Fork on September 7, 1855.Mendenhall, Mark E. “An Ambivalent Expatriate: The Life of Runólfur Runólfsson.” Mormon Historical Studies 17, no. 1 (Spring/Fall2016 2016): 315–36. https://blog.utc.edu/mark-mendenhall/publications/journal-articles/ Their journey from Iceland took 10 months over land and sea (information found on the plaques at the Icelandic monument). They were directed to settle in Spanish Fork by Brigham Young due to the area already being inhabited by other Scandinavian people. All the Icelanders who came after them chose to come to Spanish Fork as well in an effort to maintain their culture. By 1860 there were 16 Icelanders living in Spanish Fork, making it the first permanent Icelandic Settlement in the United States. The Scandinavian settlers already in Spanish Fork occupied different areas of the city, the Icelanders lived closely together in the south east part of town.Bearnson, Birdella & John Y.\\"The First Permanent Settlement of Icelander's in America.

Spanish Fork came to be known as “Little Iceland.” The Icelanders living in Utah saw it as not only a place of religious freedom, but also a place of great opportunity to build a new home and receive new opportunities.Hálfdanarson, Guðmundur. “‘Are You Leaving, My Dear Friend!’ Iceland in the Time of Immigration to America.” Mormon Historical Studies 17, no. 1 (Spring/Fall2016 2016): 243–61. https://www.academia.edu/32269126/_Are_You_Leaving_My_Dear_Friend_Iceland_in_the_Time_of_Immigration_to_America_ These new opportunities also inspired Icelanders who were not members of the Church to emigrate from Iceland to Utah. They wrote home to their friends and family about their experiences. Although in their letters they acknowledged the difficulty of cultural differences,Woods, Fred E.

In addition, some Icelanders who were members of the Church returned to Iceland between the years of 1860 and 1914 to share their religion and new home with other Icelanders, inviting them to join the Church and embark to Utah. By 1914 there was a total of 410 Icelandic people settled in Spanish Fork. == Icelandic Monument and dedication == Icelandic Monument, Lighthouse The Icelandic Monument is located at 785 E Canyon Road Spanish Fork, Utah.

KSL , June 26, 2005. https://www.ksl.com/article/77052/icelandic-memorial-dedicated-in-spanish-fork On the side of the lighthouse there is also a list of names, sixteen of the first Icelandic people to settle in Spanish Fork. The purpose of the monument was to pay tribute to the people who founded the town, and to create a bridge between Iceland and Spanish Fork today.Hardy, Rodger L. “Pres.

The monument was first erected and dedicated in 1938 by the Daughters of Utah Pioneers and the Utah Icelandic Association as part of the Icelandic Days celebration. It was dedicated on August 2,1938 by Andrew Jensen, the Assistant Church Historian for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at the time. Mary Hanson Sherwood, one of the 16 Icelandic settlers who came between 1855 and 1860 (name listed on plaque) was present and had the opportunity to speak. The original monument consisted of only the lighthouse with a plaque on the side containing the names of the first 16 Icelandic settlers. Icelandic Monument, Wall In 2005, the Spanish Fork Monument was renovated and received three new updates: a rock from the shore of Vestmannaeyjar where its sister monument is located, a wall with a list of the 410 names of the Icelanders that immigrated to Utah prior to 1914, and other plaques giving explanations of the historical events of Icelanders coming to Spanish Fork. Gordon B. Hinckley, the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 2005 requested, and was given permission, to dedicate the newly renovated Icelandic Monument. It was rededicated on June 25, 2005. Nearly 4,000 people, many of Icelandic descent and 120 of them visitors from Iceland were present for the dedication and the celebrations of that event. Olafur Ragnar Gimsson, President of Iceland at that time, was also present at the dedication. === Names of 16 Original Icelandic Settlers in Spanish Fork === Plaque with names The following is the list of the 16 Icelandic settlers that first came to Spanish Fork between 1855 and 1860 as found on the plaque at the Icelandic monument in Spanish Fork: * Samuel Bjarnason and his wife Margret * Thordur Didriksson and his wife Helga * Gudmundur Gudmundsson * Loftur Jonsson and his wife Gudrun * Jon Jonsson and his wife Anna * Gudrun Jonsdottir * Magnus Bjarnason and his wife Thuridur * Vigdis Bjarnadottir (Holt) * Gudny E. Haflidiason * Ragnhildur S. Hanson * Mary H. Sherwood === Sister Monument in Vestmannaeyjar, Iceland === On June 30, 2000, a sister monument to the Spanish Fork Monument in Vestmannaeyjar was dedicated by Elder William Rolfe Kerr, a leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at that time. It was built in order to remember the 410 Icelanders who emigrated from Iceland to Utah. This monument stands right next to the Atlantic Ocean in a place where many converts to the Church were baptized before embarking on their trip to Utah. The names of all those 410 Icelanders are found on the monument and were added in 2005 to the Spanish Fork monument as well. == Icelandic Celebrations in Spanish Fork == In an effort to help the Scandinavian settlers assimilate the leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encouraged members to have activities, including church meetings together. Until this point, members had congregated for church in their native language, however, they followed the counsel of church leaders and began meeting with those from different countries. Although this change caused them to be in an unfamiliar situation and culture,Christiansen, Alfred. 1972. “Scandinavians and the New Zion in the West.” American-Scandinavian Review 60 (3): 263–71. they were able to keep pieces of their culture. In order to spend time together, support one another, and remember their culture and heritage they began the celebration of Iceland Day (originally on August 2nd). In general, Icelanders are proud of their heritage and make efforts to hold on to their roots.Thor, Jonas. Icelanders in North America The First Settlers. Winnipeg: University of Manitoba Press, 2014. https://uofmpress.ca/books/detail/icelanders-in-north-america Evidence of this is found in the linguistic abilities of second generation Icelanders. The majority of second generation Icelanders living outside of Iceland can speak Icelandic just as well as their parents.Jackson, Thorstina. \\"Icelandic Communities in America: Cultural Backgrounds and Early Settlements.\\" The Journal of Social Forces 3, no. 4 (1925): 680-86. doi:10.2307/3005071. https://www.jstor.org/stable/i350571 In an effort to teach their posterity about their Icelandic heritage many celebrations have taken place in Spanish Fork. === Centennial Celebration === One of the most significant Icelandic celebrations that has taken place in Spanish Fork was the Centennial Celebration on June 15, 16, and 17 in 1955. It marked the 100 year anniversary of the first Icelanders coming to Spanish Fork. Icelandic celebrations usually involve dancing, singing, and other activities such as Glima that remind Icelanders of their heritage, the Centennial Celebration was no exception. The Centennial Celebration Program Pamphlet included the full schedule of events for those three days. Many of the activities were held outside or at Spanish Fork High School in the Auditorium, and were free to attend. The activities included a pageant (which was meant to symbolize the migration of early Icelanders), Glima (Icelandic wrestling), parades, city tours for visitors, and speeches by a representative from the U.S. State Department as well as an Icelandic Representative. Iceland Days; Fire and Ice Festival Booth === Annual Celebration === In addition to this special Centennial Celebration, Icelanders first celebrated what was called “Icelander Days” in 1897. Today in Spanish Fork, they hold an annual celebration which is often called “Iceland Days”. It is usually held in June and today involves Icelandic food, celebrations, and visiting the historic Icelandic sites in Spanish Fork.Hardy, Rodger L. “Icelandic Days in Spanish Fork through Sunday.” Deseret News.

Its southwest end is at its junction with Anteater Drive and Shady Canyon Drive, at the meeting point of the Turtle Rock, Turtle Ridge, and University Hills neighborhoods of Irvine. However, the road continues to the southwest under different names, Bonita Canyon Drive and then Ford Road, through a junction with California State Route 73 and into Newport Beach. At its northwest end, Culver Drive ends at its junction with Furrow in the Orchard Hills neighborhood of Irvine. Its length is split roughly into thirds by its junctions with Interstate 405 towards its southeast end and with Interstate 5 towards its northeast end. For much of its length it parallels California State Route 261, which runs to its northwest. Culver Drive is named after Fred \\"Humpy\\" Culver, a local farmer who leased a large amount of land from the Irvine Ranch and built a large house with a windmill in 1910 at what came to be known as \\"Culver's Corner\\". At the time this corner was the junction of Culver Drive, Trabuco Road, and U.S. Route 101; now it is where Culver Drive has its junction with Interstate 5. When the University Park neighborhood of Irvine was first developed in the mid-1960s (five years before Irvine's incorporation in 1971), Interstate 405 had yet to be built near the neighborhood. Culver, then a two-lane road, formed the main route into and out of the neighborhood.

The outbreak was the worst epidemic in New Zealand since an influenza epidemic in 1999, and is the worst measles epidemic since 1938. The Measles outbreak of 1999 was actually predicted two years prior. An \\"immunization campaign\\" was intended to vaccinate 90–95% of New Zealand, but ultimately failed as less than 80 percent of New Zealand's population was vaccinated, resulting in the epidemic. Australia has been linked to the New Zealand epidemic. An ongoing outbreak in Perth began in October 2019 after a New Zealander visited while infectious. The strain of this outbreak is the D8 strain and this epidemic has spread to Samoa killing more than 72 people and Tonga. The New Zealand Government has been criticised for its response to the epidemic, particularly due to shortages in the supply of vaccines. Scientists have also criticised the Ministry of Health for not acting on previous recommendations to conduct national 'catch-up' campaigns with the MMR vaccine prior to the outbreak. Although New Zealand has had a high demand for the MMR Vaccine, resulting in a shortage, there has also been an increase of .5% of people who have declined the vaccine since 2017. Two unborn fetuses in 2nd trimester have died as a result of the outbreak. 4 cases in Fiji, and 74 cases in Australia are directly or indirectly linked to the outbreak in New Zealand and have being included in the total. To compare, the United States has only had 1249 cases from 1 January 2019 – 1 October 2019 throughout the entire country. ==Cases== As of 29 January 2020, there had been 2,193 cases of measles reported throughout New Zealand since 1 January 2019. Auckland had been the worst-hit region, with 1,736 cases alone.

He helped develop social judgment theory and realistic conflict theory. Sherif was a founder of modern social psychology who developed several unique and powerful techniques for understanding social processes, particularly social norms and social conflict. Many of his original contributions to social psychology have been absorbed into the field so fully that his role in the development and discovery has disappeared. Other reformulations of social psychology have taken his contributions for granted, and re-presented his ideas as new. == Life and career == === Early life, education and political involvement === Muzafer Sherif was born as Muzaffer Şerif Başoğlu and grew up in a wealthy family that included five children, of whom he was the second born. He attended Elementary School in Ödemiş for six years and then attended Izmir International College from which he received a Bachelor of Arts in 1926. Sherif then obtained MA degree from the Istanbul University in 1928, where he also expressed his support for the modernization of Turkey during political debates and gathered interest in goal-oriented behaviour, or hormic psychology as proposed by British psychologist William McDougall. A picture of Ankara University in 1937, where Sherif published Irk Psikolojisi (1943) and The Changing World (1945) Sherif grew up through the Italo-Turkish War, the Balkan Wars, World War I and the Armenian deportations. Additionally, Izmir underwent occupation by Greek and Turkish soldiers from 1918-1924 in the Turkish War of Independence while he attended the College. Sherif went to America during the peak of the Great Depression, earning an MA from Harvard University where his teachers were Gordon Allport and Caroll Pratt. He visited Berlin in 1932 during the rise of the Nazi Party to attend Wolfgang Köhler's lectures on Gestalt Psychology, whereafter Sherif planned to use Gestalt principles for a new social perception theory. He returned to the U.S in 1933 and re-enrolled at Harvard for his Doctoral studies, but later switched to Columbia University, where he earned a Ph.D. in 1935 under Gardner Murphy. Sherif gained a position at Ankara University upon his return to Turkey and developed ties with the Communist Party of Turkey (TKP). He criticized members of the bureaucracy and Nazi-supporters in his works as fascism became more prevalent. He was briefly detained along with other members of the TKP in 1944 following political conflicts at Ankara University, where he sided with Communists. Sherif went back to the U.S permanently in 1945. === Early career and marriage === In 1945, Sherif married Carolyn Wood, and they collaborated productively on subsequent projects for many years, on scholarly books (e.g., Sherif & Sherif, 1953) and a textbook (Sherif & Sherif, 1969). They had three daughters: Ann, Sue and Joan. In 1947, he published his first book, The Psychology of Ego Involvements, co-written with Hadley Cantril. In it, he compared Soviet and American societies, by showing different values and beliefs of the nations which flowed from different social and cultural contexts. With it, he posited that individualistic, competitive and conflictual society is avoidable. === Life in the US === Sherif fled back to America shortly after his detainment in Turkey in 1945 due to fear of a harsher and longer punishment for his association with the Communist Party.Kayaoğlu, A., Batur, S., & Aslitürk, E. (2014). The unknown muzafer sherif. The Psychologist, 27(11), 830-833. Retrieved from The social academic environment during Sherif's first years in America supported Sherif's Marxist views and inspired The Psychology of Ego Involvements (1947), published from Princeton University.Russell, G. (2016). A variation on forced migration: Wilhelm peters (prussia via britain to turkey) and muzafer sherif (turkey to the united states). Journal of the History of the Neurosciences, 25(3), 320-347. doi:10.1080/0964704X.2016.1175 By 1951 Sherif's relationship with Turkey had been completely damaged. He’d lost all contact with close friends and colleagues during Turkey’s anti-Communist shutdown and his relationships with family dwindled. Despite Sherif's influence in the Social Psychology academic scene, he remained stateless.Harvey, O. J. (1989). Muzafer sherif (1906–1988). American Psychologist, 44(10), 1325-1326. doi:10.1037/h0091637 Sherif no longer held rights in Turkey and was not granted US citizenship. Sherif was listed on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Communist sympathizer list and was interrogated by the FBI, which caused him to be more discreet about his socio-political views. Sherif was officially fired as a Professor at Ankara University, and was legally liable for salary debt to the Turkish government during his residence in the U.S. Sherif's marriage to his American wife, Carolyn Wood, led to his dismissal because it violated policies banning the marriage of Turks to foreigners. Although mostly recognized as a psychologist, Sherif was the first to obtain the Cooley-Mead Award for Contributions to Social Psychology from the American Sociological Association. His academic appointments included Yale University, the University of Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania State University. === Mental illness and late life === Sherif had difficulties with mental illness as he was diagnosed with manic depression and had attempted suicide. Sherif's mental health worsened after his wife’s death in 1982. According to his daughter, Sue, with whom Sherif was living at that time, Sherif was in good spirits when he was stricken with a fatal heart attack. He died on October 16, 1988, in Fairbanks, Alaska, at the age of 82. == Contributions to psychology == Sherif made contributions to social psychological theory, field and laboratory methodology, and to the application of research to social issues. He wrote more than 60 articles and 24 books. The majority of his research was done with his wife, Carolyn Wood Sherif. === Autokinetic effect experiments === Sherif's dissertation was titled \\"Some Social Factors In Perception\\", and the ideas and research were the basis for his first classic book, The Psychology of Social Norms. The topic of the dissertation was social influence in perception, and the experiments have come to be known as the \\"autokinetic effect\\" experiments. Sherif's experimental study of autokinetic movement demonstrated how mental evaluation norms were created by human beings. In an otherwise totally dark room, a small dot of light is shown on a wall, and after a few moments, the dot appears to move. This effect is entirely inside the head, and results from the complete lack of \\"frame of reference\\" for the movement. Three participants enter the dark room, and watch the light. It appears to move, and the participants are asked to estimate how far the dot of light moves. These estimates are made out loud, and with repeated trials, each group of three converges on an estimate. Some groups converged on a high estimate, some low, and some in-between. The critical finding is that groups found their own level, their own \\"social norm\\" of perception. This occurred naturally, without discussion or prompting. When invited back individually a week later and tested alone in the dark room, participants replicated their original groups' estimates. This suggests that the influence of the group was informational rather than coercive; because they continued to perceive individually what they had as members of a group, Sherif concluded that they had internalized their original group's way of seeing the world. Because the phenomenon of the autokinetic effect is entirely a product of a person's own perceptual system, this study is evidence of how the social world pierces the person's skin, and affects the way they understand their own physical and psychological sensations. === Realistic conflict theory and the Robbers Cave experiment === In 1961, Sherif and Carolyn Wood Sherif developed realistic conflict theory, which has been described as \\"account[ing] for inner group conflict, negative prejudices, and stereotypes as a result of actual competition between groups for desired resources.\\" This theory was based in part on the 1954 Robber's Cave experiment. The 1954 experiment, and an abandoned 1953 experiment have come under recent scrutiny, with particular interest in the manipulation and provocation of the child participants by the scientists, and possible confirmation bias by Sherif. In the 1954 experiment, \\"22 white, fifth grade, 11 year old boys with average-to-good school performance and above average intelligence with a protestant, two parent background were sent to a special remote summer camp in Oklahoma, Robbers Cave State Park.\\" The participants were carefully screened to be psychologically normal, and they did not know each other. Sending them to such a remote location was done to reduce the influence of external factors and better allow “the true nature of conflict and prejudice” to be studied. Researchers, who doubled as counsellors at this summer camp, divided the participants into two different groups, and each group were assigned cabins far from the other. During the first phase, groups did not know the existence of the others. \\"The boys developed an attachment to their groups throughout the first week of the camp by doing various activities together: hiking, swimming, etc. The boys chose names for their groups, The Eagles and The Rattlers, and stenciled them onto shirts and flags\\". In this \\"ingroup formation\\" phase, members of the groups got to know each other, social norms developed and leadership and structure emerged. Then the second, group conflict or \\"friction\\" phase began, in which the groups came into contact with each other. Researchers set up a four-day competitions between those groups with promised prizes to the winners. Prejudice became apparent between the two groups. The prejudice was initially only verbally expressed, such as through taunting or name calling, but as the competition progressed, the prejudice began being expressed more directly, such as with one group burning the other's flag or ransacking their cabin. The groups became too aggressive with each other to control; the researchers had to separate them physically. Researchers then gave all boys a two-day cooling-off period, and asked them to list characteristics of the two groups. The boys tended to characterize their own group highly favourably and the other group very negatively. The researchers then attempted to reduce the prejudice between the groups, and found that simply increasing their contact with each other made matters worse. In contrast, \\"Forcing the groups to work together to reach superordinate goals, or common goals, eased the prejudice and tension among the groups\\". Thus, in this \\"integration\\" or conflict resolution phase, it was shown that superordinate goals reduce conflict significantly more effectively than communication or contact did. ===Crisis in social psychology=== Added: PsypriseSherif, M. (1977). Crisis in social psychology: Some remarks towards breaking through the crisis. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 3(3), 368-382. doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/014616727700300305 In 1977, while at Pennsylvania State University Sherif published a paper identifying problem areas in Social Psychology as well as solutions towards them. Publication Quality vs Volume Sherif begins by describing that social psychology (at the time of publication) was undergoing an increase in the amount of research taking place, and publications printed. To state his position he claims that the ratio of chaff (dry, unusable, straw material used to symbolize meaningless research) to wheat (meaningful and useful research) is off. He believes this is recognized by other social psychologists high in the field such as Harry Triandis, and acknowledges that some may disagree with his opinion. Thriving Research: Small Group Research and Attitude Change Research Sherif references Paul Hare and Fred Strodtbeck’s bibliographic compilation of all small group research studies from the July 1954 issue of Sociometry in which 584 citations were listed. This is compared with the March 1972 issue which listed 2021 items. Despite this vast increase, Sherif believes that the studies don’t build off of each other so it is hard to argue from common ground when variables, tasks, and measures are not consistent. He also mentions how social psychology has become more individualistic, focusing on internal states like “dissonance, attitudes, [and] attributions”, rather than properties of a group. Sherif blames reductionism, where the phenomena of groups was reduced to interpersonal reaction and ahistoricalism which removed situational factors from consideration. To remedy this he cites Albert Pepitone’s stance that social psychology should focus on research normative in substance (address sociocultural perspectives) and comparative methods. Sherif promotes the idea of attitude and attitude change due to its importance in a quickly changing world. He emphasizes that real world contexts are important, even if regarded as “messy” compared to controlled lab experiments. Increasing Pressure of the Crisis Sherif believes this “publish or perish” culture perpetuates a large output of studies that aren’t necessarily high quality, as researchers are forced to publish papers for their careers, rather than for good science. This leads to a loss of direction for the field as rather than working together on a shared paradigm, researchers are in “self-contained castles” within psychology, but also across disciplines in the social sciences. Clyde Hendrick, asked his colleagues about the “crisis” in the social psychology field and had researchers provide arguments on the following topics: \\\\- Scientific vs Historical \\\\- Environmental vs Social Psychologies \\\\- Field vs Experimental research \\\\- Grand theory vs Smaller operational theories vs belief that the field is doing well Following Psychologists participated: Y. Epstein, D. Stokols, H. Pronshansky, I. Altman, M. Mania, K. Gergen, B. Schlenker, A. Greenwald, C. Hendrick, W. Thorngate, R. Harris, P. Secord, M. B. Smith, D. Forsyth, S. Baumgardner, B. Earn, and R. Kroger (Fall, 1976) Sherif mentions that the crisis reproduces itself such that researchers who are in their “self-contained castles” write Social Psychology textbooks, but exclude positions which disagree with their own rather than educate students of a shared paradigm (such paradigms don’t exist, sheriff argues). This is likely as Akan Elm’s states that Social Psychology is still in its “pre- paradigmatic stage of development” and any sort of yield should be celebrated. To this Sherif asks why the field isn’t closer in the 70s than in the 50s, despite roughly 3000 publications being produced since the 50s. Sherif endorses the communication across discipline where it isn’t scientific vs historical to understand a problem, but scientific AND historical. This will help to create commonly shared paradigms, to remove those from their “castles” and disband “disorderly faction-infested tribes” for the greater good of science. Breaking Through the Crisis Sherif explains that some theory model- builders become fixated and create models of small trivial problems, and to break through the crisis is to ask some “unthinkable” questions. What is the nature of a social system in terms of its structure, and function. Sherif claims that psychologists may avoid this, as this is a social rather than psychological question. But ignoring the social aspects of a system is like avoiding the physics of light while studying vision. If Psychology wants to join the ranks of physical sciences, it has to be acknowledged that they asked their “unthinkable” questions during their establishment. They tested their phenomena through simulation models and studies, by viewing physical phenomena in the real world, psychologists need to do the same according to Sherif rather than standing at a far distance. The importance of cross-cultural comparisons is also mentioned by Sherif to insure the validity of methods. == Contributions to sociology == The social judgement theory examines how the assessment and perception of one's ideas are consistent with current attitudes. As new ideas are present, it is assessed by contrasting with one's current beliefs. Muzafer Sherif examined how one has their own latitudes of perception of their ideas and that may be opposing to others' point of view. As a result, he illustrated three forms of latitude which are the latitude of acceptance, rejection and non-commitment. The latitude of acceptance explores the variety of ideas that individuals perceive as considerable and acceptable. The latitude of rejection explores the variety of ideas that an individual perceives to be disagreeable and not deemed considerable. The latitude of noncommitment explores the ideas that are neither considerable or disagreeable. Furthermore, ego involvement is significant in the theory of social judgement as individuals who do not provide an importance to an issue, determine that they consist of broad latitude of noncommitment. As a result, the latitude of rejection of ideas and opposing ideas result in involvement of high ego. Moreover, Sherif explored contrast and assimilation in people's latitudes. Contrast latitude explains how individuals perceive perspectives and beliefs within the latitude of rejection than it actually should be considered and assimilation explains how individuals perceive perspectives and beliefs within their latitude of acceptance than it actually should be. The boomerang effect explored how one's beliefs and attitudes change directions in opposing way to what the message is conveying. Therefore, people are distant from the message of the idea instead of being conveyed to the message. == Books and editorial work == During his career, Sherif authored and coauthored 24 books and over 60 journal articles and chapters which are still influential in the field of psychology. ===1937-1944=== He established a small laboratory at Ankara University. The laboratory was on the social judgment from where he, along with his students translated many works in psychology into the Turkish language. The translation included but was not limited to 1937 Stanford-Binet, chapters from E. G. Boring's History of Experimental Psychology as well as Robert S. Woodworth's Contemporary Schools of Psychology. ===1945-1947=== Upon returning to the United States in January 1945, he joined Princeton University as a Fellow of the U.S. State Department. Here he collaborated with Hadley Cantril on The Psychology of Ego-Involvements, which was later published in 1947. ===1947-1949=== Sherif was a Rockefeller Research Fellow at Yale University from 1947 to 1949. His long and prolific collaboration with Carl Hovland began from here, which led to many influential papers on the anchoring effects of attitudes as well as the book, Social Judgement: Assimilation and Contrast Effects in Communication and Attitude Change which was published in 1961. ===1949-1966=== He moved to Oklahoma in 1949, where he worked as a professor, research professor, and director of the Institute of Group Relations, which he founded in 1952. This was the peak of his scholarly activity that resulted in 12 books and 43 research articles and chapters on various topics like attitudes, properties of natural and experimentally created groups on perception, anchoring effects of psychophysical scales, judgment, and self-functioning, etc. Sherif organized different seminars at Oklahoma and later wrote five books based on the papers delivered at those seminars. Some of the well-known volumes included Group in Harmony and Tension (with his wife Carolyn Sherif), Social Judgment (with Carl Hovland), Reference Groups: An Exploration Into Conformity and Deviation of Adolescents (with Carolyn Sherif), Attitude and Attitude Change: The Social Judgment-Involvement Approach (with Carolyn Sherif and R. Nebergall), In Common Predicament: Social Psychology of Inter-group Conflict and Cooperation, and a major revision of a textbook, An Outline of Social Psychology (with Carolyn Sherif). Although he wrote many texts and research in psychology, his best-known work during his 16 years stay at Oklahoma is the Inter-group Conflict and Cooperation: The Robber's Cave Experiment (with O. J. Harvey, B. J. White, W. R. Hood, and C. W. Sherif). This was initially distributed as a technical report in 1954 but was reprinted without the copyrights of the University Oklahoma Bookstore in 1961. In 1988, it was published by Wesleyan University Press for the first time. In 1966 he and his wife moved to Pennsylvania State University, where she became a member of the Psychology Department and he became a Sociology Professor. During this time, he authored, co-authored and co-edited several journal articles and five books with his wife, Carolyn. These five books were: Group Conflict and Cooperation; Attitude, Ego-Involvement and Change; Social Interaction, Process, and Products: Selected Essays of Muzafer Sherif; and Social Psychology, a revision of the 1966 edition of that textbook. ==References== Category:1906 births Category:People from Ödemiş Category:People from Aidin Vilayet Category:Social psychologists Category:Turkish psychologists Category:Gazi Eğitim Enstitüsü faculty Category:Turkish emigrants to the United States Category:Columbia University alumni Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Istanbul University alumni Category:1988 deaths Category:20th-century psychologists ","title":"Muzafer Sherif"},{"id":"61705056","text":"Mananthavady State assembly constituency is one of the 140 state legislative assembly constituencies in Kerala state in southern India.

In 1962, upon being elected as the Judge of Midland County, she became the first Republican (and female) to hold and oversee a county office in Midland. Due to how the county’s court system was constructed, Culver headed the commissioner’s court and presided over matters that included probate proceedings. On February 1, 1988, Culver became the second female appointed as a Justice of the Texas Supreme Court. She ran for election to keep in her seat in November of that same year, but lost to Jack Hightower. Culver remained on the bench until December 7, 1988. It was also in 1988 that Culver married her second husband James H. Clack, a retired judge. The Justice Barbara Culver Juvenile Justice Center, originally called the Culver Youth Home, in Midland, Texas was re- named in her honor after it was expanded. She died on September 12, 2016. ==See also== * List of justices of the Texas Supreme Court ==References== Category:1926 births Category:2016 deaths Category:20th-century American judges Category:20th-century American lawyers Category:American women lawyers Category:American women judges Category:Lawyers from Dallas Category:Southern Methodist University alumni Category:Texas lawyers Category:Texas Republicans Category:Justices of the Texas Supreme Court ","title":"Barbara Culver"},{"id":"61705087","text":"Garaud is a French surname.

Bowers is an American physicist, engineer, researcher and educator. He is the Fred Kavli Chair in Nanotechnology, the director of the Institute for Energy Efficiency and a distinguished professor in the Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Materials at University of California, Santa Barbara. He is also the deputy director of American Institute of Manufacturing of Integrated Photonics. Bowers' research is focused on silicon photonic integrated circuits for fiber optic communications. He has edited two books, published sixteen book chapters, 700 journal papers, and 1100 conference papers. He holds 67 patents. He has co-founded six companies, including Terabit Technology (acquired by Ciena), Aerius Photonics (acquired by FLIR), Aurrion (acquired by Juniper), Calient Networks, Nexus Photonics and Quintessent. Bowers is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, a fellow of the IEEE, OSA and the American Physical Society, and a recipient of the IEEE Photonics Award, OSA Tyndall Award, OSA Holonyak Prize, the IEEE LEOS William Streifer Award and the South Coast Business and Technology Pioneer and Entrepreneur of the Year Awards. == Education == Bowers received a B.S. in physics from University of Minnesota in 1976. He then received an M.S. in applied physics in 1978 and a Ph.D. in Applied Physics in 1981, both from Stanford University. After completing his Ph.D., he received his post-doctoral training at Ginzton Laboratory at Stanford University. == Career == In 1982, Bowers joined the AT&T; Bell Laboratories as a member of the technical staff. In 1987, he left AT&T; to join University of California, Santa Barbara as a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Since then, he has worked at UCSB. In 1996, he was appointed as the Director of Multidisciplinary Optical Switching Technology Center at UCSB and served in this position until 2003. He founded the Center for Entrepreneurship and Engineering Management at UCSB in 1998 and then served as its director until 2001. In 2008, he founded the Institute of Energy Efficiency to focus research at UCSB on reducing energy consumption and has served as its director since. From 2009 to 2014, Bowers served as the director of Center Energy Efficient Materials, an initiative at the Department of Energy, Energy Frontier Research Centers. He contributed in establishing the American Institute of Manufacturing Integrated Photonics and took on the position of its Deputy Director in 2015. The Institute's work is focused on driving low cost, high volume CMOS processing of photonic integrated circuits (PICs). === Entrepreneurship === Along with his career in academia, Bowers has also been involved in founding and managing several businesses for commercialization of technology. In 1996, Bowers co-founded Terabit Technology and served as its president for the next two years until it was acquired by Ciena. He later co- founded Calient Networks in 1999 and worked as the CTO of the company until 2002. With his students, he co-founded Aerius Photonics (acquired by FLIR), Aurrion (acquired by Juniper Networks), Nexus Photonics and Quintessent. Bowers taught classes in entrepreneurship at UCSB for over twenty years, and started the Center for Entrepreneurship and Engineering Management (CEEM) at UCSB, which grew into the Technology Management Program (TMP) at UCSB, which offers PhDs, Master of Technology Management and Certificates of Technology Management. == Research and work == Bowers is well known for leading research in high speed lasers, modulators and photodetectors which led to advances in fiber optic system capacities in the 1980s and 1990s. Fiber optic systems were first deployed at data rates of 50 Megabits per second in the late 1970s, and rapidly advanced by a factor of 1000 to data rates of 50 Gbits per second over the next forty years. All of his early work, and most of the commercial fiber optic systems utilized components made from InGaAsP materials, which became the dominant materials system for fiber optic components. Bowers' later research focused on silicon photonics in an effort to combine the large technological infrastructure developed for silicon integrated circuits, and to expand from conventional electrical integrated circuits to PICs. This enabled a much lower cost and much higher volume production of PICs than had been previously possible. High speed modulators and photodetectors were also demonstrated in this materials system, but lasers were a major problem due to the inefficient light emission from silicon, which is an indirect bandgap material. Bowers and his students, Alex Fang and Hyundai Park, solved this problem by developing heterogeneous integration of InGaAsP materials on silicon, and this process was commercialized by Intel, Juniper, and others. He then pursed heterogeneous integration of other materials on silicon, such as magnetic materials (YIG), and nonlinear materials (LiNbO3, GaAs). Bowers' most recent work involves monolithic growth of high gain materials on silicon. This approach was plagued by poor efficiency and poor lifetime due to the growth defects common to heteroepitaxy. He and graduate students, Rich Mirin now at NIST, developed quantum dot lasers that are robust against degradation and led to monolithic PICs. === Energy Efficiency === Bowers founded and led the Institute for Energy Efficiency at UCSB to reduce the demand for energy and consequently reduce the consumption of energy resources and reduce the production of greenhouse gasses and the impact on climate change and sustainability. This effort involved forty faculty members at UCSB in research on topics from more efficient light emitters to more efficient data centers. One outgrowth of more efficient light emitters, solar cells and batteries, is the impact on those without access to electricity because it is cheaper and far healthier to generate light for reading by using solar power reading lights than to burn candles, kerosene or wood. Bowers formed a nonprofit, Unite to Light, to make this technology accessible to the third world. == Awards and honors == *1996 - LEOS William Streifer Award, IEEE *1996 - Fellow, American Physical Society *2001 - Entrepreneur of the Year Award, South Coast Business and Technology *2002 - Fellow, Optical Society of America *2005 - Member, National Academy of Engineering *2007 - ACE Award for \\"Most Promising New Technology”, EETimes *2009 - Nick Holonyak, Jr. Award, Optical Society of America *2012 - Tyndall Award, Optical Society of America/IEEECogan, Sarah (2 April 2012). \\"The Optical Society Announces 18 Awards for 2012\\".

It is located in the most dangerous area in Korea.So it has a special feature that is different from the usual guard post. It consists of a bunker-type guard post and has small-scale personnel. == Details == Since 1963, North and South Korea have competitively installed guard posts (GPs) where armed soldiers are stationed at all times within the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), while some GPs and GPs have been equipped with barbed wire fences. In 1953, the DMZ was established under an agreement at the time of the end of the war, and soldiers were banned from entering the DMZ. As a result, the North has the status of a police officer named Min Kyung-dae and the South as a \\"DMZ Police,\\" but the substance is armed soldiers on both sides. Originally, the Demilitarized Zone was literally a place where armed personnel should not come in, but after the Korean War, the two Koreas built civilian and police posts and stationed troops within the DMZ area they were managing. Until the late '90s, search squads of the front division were stationed, and then search squadrons under the direct control of the regiment were stationed. However, depending on the situation of the GP unit, the division's search squads are stationed. Compared to the GOP in the front-line area, it is often confused with the GOP due to its low recognition. GOP stands for 'General Out Post' and refers to a general front post guarding the Southern Limit Line. To put it simply, GPs are in the DMZ and GOPs are in charge of outside the DMZ. Due to the specificity and security of GPs, there is little exposure to the private sector such as the media. As the 530GP incident took place, it became known to the public in earnest. While producing DMZ documentaries on Korean broadcaster KBS, he visited GPs and search teams in person with the cooperation of the military and covered them, which is the only data that is easily accessible to the general public. However, this is also not revealed in detail because of security. There are also differences in troop levels. The GOP guard is a general soldier, and the GP guards are considered elite soldiers as search soldiers. GPs face the danger of unconfirmed land mines in the DMZ (unarmed areas) and around 2KM on average, limiting the movement of GP residents and limiting the number of visitors due to the danger of provocation. As a result, DMZ operations and visitors are required to obtain permission from the United Nations Command in advance, and those who have not gone through the Defense Ministry's background checks cannot enter the GP. In addition, GOPs are free to stay out overnight and take vacations, but GPs are not allowed to stay out overnight except in special cases during the input period. Unlike ordinary units, fatigue levels during work are high, and CCTVs are installed in closed environments and GPs, so all actions are regimental and divisional. As can be seen in the military, mental fatigue is also high. Of course, GP employees get a lot of vacation time when they withdraw. The western front is flanked by GPs from the north and south, bordering the wide plain area along the Imjin River. The scenery is beautiful and the road situation from the GOP to the GP is smooth. In the case of the eastern front, most of them are very close to the North Korean GP and located in rough mountains, so the roads are twisted and unpaved. It has a different environment depending on the front. == GP Search Soldier == The search squadrons and search squadrons carry out DMZ guard missions over a period of time. A few months of training in the rear, months of guard operations at GPs. As a result, platoon troops are dispatched to each GP. The job of the search soldiers is to monitor the DMZ and patrol the DMZ. Most GPs are located on the top of the mountain for visibility. Therefore, it is very difficult to carry out search operations and guard operations in the DMZ with heavy bulletproof suits, various ammunition, grenades, and bayonets. From the moment they are put into GPs, their fatigue is enormous, as all the actions they do are real military operations, so they are always fully armed. They are supplied with a lot of equipment as high-quality human resources. New supplies will be given top priority and various special equipment will be provided to individuals. === Soldier === Due to the specificity of the unit in charge of GPs, there is an opportunity to apply to the search team and search company during the boot camp training period. Afterwards, the team will be selected based on the results of the training center and interview scores, and it will not be possible to transfer to the unit. === Cadre === They are selected through support, just like soldiers. The commander of the unit shall select based on the records, and if there are no personnel, the unit may be forcibly moved at the discretion of the commander. If it is advantageous for promotion due to GP characteristics and has a history of guard operations for GPs, there are significant benefits in long-term service screening, so executives who want long-term service usually go. === Facility === Most of Korea's GPs were built in the 1970s and 1980s, when construction technology was incomparable. Since it is an old facility, there are many places that are older than ordinary facilities. The military is making various efforts to detect and improve these shortcomings. == Accident == === GP shooting incident === On June 19, 2005, at the 530GP of the 28th Infantry Division of the Republic of Korea Army in Yeoncheon County, Gyeonggi Province, Army private Kim Dong-min threw a grenade with a pin released at the interior office and fired a gun, killing eight people and injuring two others, which is well known to the Korean public as the \\"Kim Il-byeong Incident.\\" The main cause of the incident was severe absurdity, and the military's culture of irrationality has disappeared since the \\"Kim Il-byeong Incident.\\" === 2018 GP Private First Class Gun Death === On November 16, 2018, a private was found with a gunshot wound to the head in the bathroom of the GP of the front division of the eastern front of Yanggu and died while being taken to a hospital. The squad leader, who moved to the scene after hearing the shooting, found Private Kim and took him to a nearby hospital, but died around 17:38. === 2018 GP Demonstration withdrawal === On July 24, 2018, the Ministry of National Defense decided to withdraw GP equipment and troops on a trial basis. On November 11, all 11 guard posts were withdrawn. Mutual verification of demolition of the South and the North was completed on December 12. This is the first time that the 9.19 military agreement has been implemented and verified. Among the withdrawn GPs, Cheorwon GP, where the Arrowhead Hill, where the Battle of Arrowhead Hill took place in 1952,1953, and Jangdan GP, west of Dora Observatory, are open to the private sector and can be visited in advance. === 2020 GP Shooting Incident === On May 3, 2020, he fired a GP of the 3rd Division of the Republic of Korea Army in Cheorwon-based in Gyeonggi Province. GP workers listened to gunshots three times in a row. Four bullets and bullets were found on the outer wall of the GP in Korea. Against this backdrop, the South Korean military fired warning shots with 15 K-3 machine guns and 15 K-6 machine guns. == Reference == ","title":"Guard posts in South Korea"},{"id":"61705351","text":"The 2019–20 Mizoram Premier League is the eighth season of the Mizoram Premier League, the top division football league in the Indian state of Mizoram.

Burke, and Commissioner of Parks and Recreation Robert Moses. Mafera Park was also known as Farmers' Oval due to the park's history hosting the semi- professional Glendale Farmers Base Ball Club for almost 50 years, from the 1900s until the 1950s. In the late 1940s and early 1950s it was also briefly called Ridgewood Park and Glen Ridge Park, as the park is between Glendale and Ridgewood.

In 1885, possibly because he thought he would find more opportunities in Europe, he left Australia for the United Kingdom and settled in Glasgow, around 1886. There, due to a long-standing interest in art, he became acquainted with several members of the Glasgow Boys, an artists' group that was influenced by the Barbizon School and credited with introducing Post-Impressionism to Scotland. This inspired him to become a serious artist. Despite his association with the group, he appears to have been largely self-taught. He focused on rural landscapes, although he also created genre works and urban scenes, and he was equally at home in watercolors or oils. Much of his work shows the influence of Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot and Charles-François Daubigny. He exhibited his works at the Royal Academy of Arts, Royal Scottish Academy and the Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour, which elected him a member in 1892. In addition, he held showings on the Continent, notably in Munich and Dresden, where he was awarded a gold medal. He eventually moved to London, which served as a base for his extensive travelling, but maintained his contacts with the Glasgow Boys.

Construction began in 1705, and the brick-built hall, designed by Smith, was completed about 1711. Fragments of the priory house remained as parts of the new building. The house was the favourite residence of William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth, grandson of the 1st Earl whom he succeeded in 1750. In the mid 18th century a park was created, and ponds, thought to have been part of the priory, were modified. In the early 19th century a portico was added to the house, and the house was extended on the west side.

Her marriage is also falling apart, as she and her husband has been struggling to conceive a child for years. But, an unlikely friendship with a student helps her reaffirm her identity as a woman. How will their story go? ==Plot== Ling (Yeo Yann Yann), a Malaysian Chinese teacher in her late 30s, and her husband Andrew (Christopher Lee) are struggling to conceive through In vitro fertilisation. Ling also has to take care of her bedridden father-in-law (Yang Shi Bin), who has suffered a stroke and is unable to speak, whilst Andrew is often absent from home. Ling sees a gynaecologist at a clinic to be informed that she has two mature follicles. Outside, she finds Kok Wei Lun (Koh Jia Ler), a student who is infatuated with her, on crutches because of his injuries sustained from his wushu trainings. Ling offers to send Wei Lun home, and learns that his parents are overseas on business and he lives alone. Ling holds a remedial class for selected students, but they left when Ling temporarily goes out of school to meet her durian-selling brother. Ling returns to class with a bag of durians offered by her brother to find that only Wei Lun has remained, an act ridiculed by his classmates. Ling and Wei Lun share the durians in the classroom, and their relationship deepens. Wei Lun starts to frequently consult Ling for remedial classes, and eventually goes to her house, encountering Ling's father-in-law while carelessly wandering around her house. Wei Lun invites Ling, who brings along her father-in-law, to support him at a national wushu competition. At the competition, Wei Lun wins first place and a gold medal. The trio celebrate by visiting Ling's brother's durian shop, and their ties deepen, forming a family. Eventually, Ling's father-in-law dies in his sleep. At his wake, Ling's cousins-in-law decide that they should sell their dead father's property, and she discovers that Andrew is cheating on her with another woman with a son, who have come to pay respects to him. Ling, lonely and without support, sends Wei Lun to his home. Ling goes up to Wei Lun's house to take care of his bleeding nose in his bedroom, where he coerces her into having sex. Ling gives into Wei Lun's sexual advances, and Wei Lun begins to initiate more inappropriate physical contact with her. Ling becomes reticent with Wei Lun, who begins stalking her frequently and harasses her on public transport after she crashes her car as a result of his rash actions. The affair is ultimately uncovered by the school principal after Wei Lun was caught in a fight with two schoolmates, who tried to expose covertly taken photos of Ling on his phone. The principal, expecting a promotion in the Ministry of Education, advises Ling to take a break from work to avoid complicating his promotion. Ling, sending Wei Lun home in her car one last time, informs him that they cannot continue the affair. A heartbroken Wei Lun leaves the car, causing Ling to chase him into the open field in the rain. Wei Lun tearfully hugs Ling, who tells him to get used to rejection. Ling and Andrew divorce. Andrew's lawyer highlighted an additional clause stipulating Andrew will not be held to paternal responsibilities in the event Ling becomes pregnant through his frozen sperm. Ling declares that she will not use them and wishes Andrew well with his newfound partner. They part ways. Having discovered she is pregnant through a spontaneous pregnancy test, Ling experiences a gamut of mixed emotions in her apartment, now stripped of its furniture, soon to be sold away. She returns to her hometown in Taiping, Malaysia, and helps her mother hang the laundry. She stands outside, gazing at the sun that never came while she was in Singapore. ==Cast== *Yeo Yann Yann as Ling *Koh Jia Ler as Wei Lun * Christopher Lee as Andrew * Yang Shi Bin as Father-in-law == Production == The film is Anthony Chen's second feature film, six years later after his first film Ilo Ilo which was released in 2013.

The fire broke out on Wednesday, September 4, 2019 and ballooned to over the course of two days. The blaze, dubbed the Tenaja fire after igniting along Tenaja Road and Clinton Keith Road in La Cresta, forced the evacuation of over 1,200 people and lead to the closure of multiple school districts in the Murrieta, Perris and Lake Elsinore area due to the poor air quality. The exact cause of the fire remains under investigation although several sources cited the possibility of lightning being the direct cause. Two structures were damaged as a result of the fire and one firefighter suffered minor injuries. The fire was contained on September 14 and had burned . ==Events== Reported at around 4:43 pm on Wednesday, September 4, the fire was initially pegged at 25 acres in size and moving with a critical rate of spread. Within five hours, that number would explode to nearly as mandatory evacuations orders were advised for over 400 homes in its surrounding communities. Those evacuations included homes on The Trails Circle in La Cresta and the Santa Rosa Plateau Visitor Center. By this time, more than 500 firefighters were actively engaging the fire as it burned to the northeast, towards Murrieta. During the evening time, the fire made a considerable run towards Murrieta causing the additional mandatory evacuations of residents in Copper Canyon South of Calle del Oso Oro between Clinton Keith Road and Murrieta Creek as containment was only set at 5 percent. The following day, the fire was reported to be 10% contained. Although the fire had remained calm throughout the early morning hours of Thursday, by the afternoon, the fire had flared up on several separate fronts and was expanding through Copper Canyon, where strong winds sent the fire line directly towards homes spurring additional evacuations along Montanya, Botanica and Belcara places and Lone Oak Way in Murrieta. It was at this time that two homes received minor damage from the fire. However, by 2:30 pm, fire activity had subsided considerably. By early Friday, September 6, the acreage of the fire was reported to have stagnated at and containment had increased to 20%. The lower temperatures and increasing in relative humidity aiding firefighters also was the cause of some evacuation orders being lifted in certain affected areas of the fire zone.All evacuation orders and warnings affecting the hundreds of homes in and around the fire area were lifted at 8 pm, Friday evening, as containment on the Tenaja fire grew to 35% as the acreage size had remained the same. On the morning of September 9, Cal Fire reported that the fire had burned , not as previously reported. The fire was contained on September 14. ==Impact== The Tenaja Fire on the hills behind an evacuated neighborhood Communities surrounding the fire were evacuated. The Tenaja fire also created poor air quality in the inland valley which caused the closure of several school districts throughout the area. The Murrieta Valley Unified School District closed all of its schools both Thursday, September 5, and Friday, September 6. Both the Romoland School District and Lake Elsinore Unified School District also canceled classes Friday, September 6, due to the mass amount of smoke in the area. ==See also== *2019 California wildfires Category:Wildfires in Riverside County, California ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 California wildfires ","title":"Tenaja Fire"},{"id":"61705679","text":"Elijah Amoo Addo (born 1 August 1990) is a Ghanaian chef and food stylist who has become a social entrepreneur through his creation of Food for All Africa. Established in 2014, Food for All Africa is a nonprofit social enterprise that operates West Africa's first community food support centre. Based in the capital of Ghana, Accra, the organization uses advocacy and a food-sharing mobile phone app to feed thousands of vulnerable children through food recovery and redistribution. Working with local restaurants, supermarkets, food distribution companies, and rural small-hold farmers, Addo’s organization collects leftover food or unwanted food that is close to its use-by date and redistributes it to disadvantaged children in orphanages, hospitals and lower- income schools. The organization is also working on the national policy level to make it easier for suppliers to donate food and claim tax benefits. Additionally, after discovering that as much as 46% of the food produced on farms in Ghana goes to waste because of poor roads, broken-down trucks and inefficient marketing, Food for All Africa is collaborating with a range of stakeholders in the Ghanaian food industry to find ways to reduce food wastage. In 2017, Addo was awarded a Queen’s Young Leaders Award by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace for his contribution towards the reforming of Ghana’s food distribution system to reduce waste, overcome hunger, and alleviate poverty and malnutrition. He also received a Takeda Young Entrepreneurship Award from the Takeda Foundation in 2018. == Early life and education == Addo was born on 1 August 1990 in Accra, Ghana but comes from Akuapem-Mampong. The only boy among four children, he lost his parents at the age of 12 and went to live with his aunt in Lagos, where he attended school. He continued his educational journey at St. Thomas Aquinas Secondary School in Accra, Ghana and then completed a course in culinary studies at Sphinx Hospitality school and catering services in Lagos, Nigeria. He holds a certificate in entrepreneurship and management from YALI West Africa RLC-GIMPA and earned a Leading Change certificate from the University of Cambridge in 2017. == Chef Career and Activism == Addo's journey as a chef started in Lagos, Nigeria when he took up a job in a restaurant as a kitchen porter to support his education. One day, in a hurry to go home, he threw out an olive sauce that the head chef had prepared, thinking it was waste. This made the chef angry to the extent of insulting him. He started crying and yelled out \\"Do you think if my parents were alive, I would be here as a cleaner while my colleagues are in school?\\" This touched the Head Chef who decided to mentor him and supported him through culinary studies at Sphinx Vocational Training School in Lagos. After training, he got a job in Marios restaurant, then one of the busiest restaurants in Lagos, and in 2010 returned to Ghana to help a Lebanese businessman who had seen his work in Lagos to open Chase Restaurant. After one year he returned to Lagos at the invitation of his mentor to work in their hotel for six months and rose to become the Sous Chef. Addo came back to Ghana and in 2011, he met a mentally challenged man who was recovering leftover food from street vendors to feed his mentally challenged colleagues on the streets. This inspired him to start the Chefs for Change Ghana Foundation, an NGO that recovered excess food from hospitality companies to feed the vulnerable and advocate against food wastage and hunger. In 2015, Chefs for Change became the Food for All Africa programme, a social enterprise that operates West Africa’s first food bank by creating sustainable means of nutrition for vulnerable children, the elderly and the mentally challenged through food banking, farming and a forum for stakeholders within Ghana’s food supply chain. In 2012, he was selected to head the kitchen at +233 Jazz Bar in Accra and became Secretary of the Greater Accra Chefs Association, where he worked with the leadership of the Association to rebrand and focus on training student chefs to improve the standards of delivery in the job market. He also worked at Burger and Relish but in 2015 resigned to focus on heading the Food For All Africa programme. In 2017, he started the Okumkom (\\"It Ends Hunger\\") mobile app as a platform to bring affordable local food products to target communities, with its first community store located in Teshie, Accra. His organization Food for All Africa recovers between $8,000 and $10,000 worth of food annually to support over 5485 beneficiaries across Ghana and in 2014 was selected as one of the 100 Global Best practices to end hunger and poverty in Ghana by Dubai International Awards for Best practices. It hopes to reach and impact 1 million low-income people by 2020. In 2017, he was selected as one of change-makers from Africa in the Commonwealth for the Queen’s Young Leaders Award by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of England at Buckingham Palace in recognition of his work towards social development across the Commonwealth, feeding the less privileged and reforming Ghana’s food distribution system to overcome food waste, hunger, poverty and malnutrition. In 2018, he was awarded the 2018 Takeda Young Entrepreneurship Award at the annual Takeda symposium in Tokyo, Japan for his Okumkom mobile app and community food stores initiative, which brings affordable and convenient local food products to communities through a mobile app, website and community target stores. == Awards and Recognitions == * 2015, Nominated for Future Award Africa award Prize in Community Action * 2017, Queen’s Young Leaders Award * 2017 100 Most Influential Young Africans * 2018, Takeda Foundation Young Entrepreneurship Award * 2019, Delivered a pitch at the EuroAfrican Forum == References == ==External links == *Elijah Amoo, Ghanaian Chef, 26, Running a Food Bank for the less privileged *Queen honors Ghanaian-born chef over passion for cooking Category:Living people Category:Ghanaian businesspeople Category:1990 births Category:Ghanaian activists Category:Alumni of the University of Cambridge Category:Ghanaian chefs ","title":"Elijah Amoo Addo"},{"id":"61705684","text":"The South Pacific Peacekeeping Force (SPPKF) was an Australian-led peacekeeping force established during the Bougainville Civil War. Hastily established to provide security for peace talks around Arawa, the force consisted of an infantry security force, supported by various logistic and aviation assets, which were deployed and air and sea from Australia. Troops were drawn from Australia, New Zealand, Tonga, Vanuatu and Fiji. The force was deployed between 4 and 21 October 1994 before being withdrawn. Further peacekeeping troops were deployed to the island in 1997 as part of the Truce Monitoring Group. ==History== Consisting of troops from the Australian 3rd Brigade, supported by the Special Air Service Regiment, the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) (HMAS Success and Tobruk) and Royal Australian Air Force, the force was deployed to Bougainville to provide security for peace talks at Arawa. The Pacific nations of Tonga, Fiji and Vanuatu also provided troops to support the operation, providing mainly infantry. Tonga also provided a patrol boat, Veoa Pangai. The overall commander was Major General Peter Arnison as the Australian Army's Land Commander, while the force in the joint force commander in the field was commanded by the 3rd Brigade commander, Brigadier Peter Abigail. The naval task group was commanded by Captain James O'Hara. Reconnaissance for the mission was undertaken between 21 and 23 September. Pre-deployment training was hastily undertaken in Townsville with 48 troops from Vanuatu, and 109 troops from Tonga being flown in by the RAAF on 26 September, followed by the Fijian contingent two days later. The force consisted of 669 ground troops, rising to a total of over 1,000 personnel including ships' crews and other support staff assigned to Task Group 627.5. The main body depart Townsville by air on 7 October, and arrived in Honiara, where the Tobruk sailed the following day. Air assets included Blackhawk and Sea King helicopters, and C-130 Hercules and Caribou transports. New Zealand provided support to the operation with Royal New Zealand Air Force Hercules aircraft. Logistics support was provided by the 2nd Field Logistic Battalion and the 3rd Brigade Administrative Support Battalion. The 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment and the 4th Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery provided liaison officers. Engineer support was provided by a troop from the 3rd Combat Engineer Regiment, which provided a high risk search element, that was bolstered by a small New Zealand Army detachment, a water purification element, plant support and construction support. Tobruk served as the force's headquarters afloat, and was anchored in Arawa Bay during the operation. After arriving, troops were ferried between key locations including Buin, Panguna and Wakunai aboard Black Hawk helicopters and LCM-8 landing craft. Operations, including patrols, checkpoints, security cordons and escort details, were undertaken around Arawa, as well as Buin, Panguna and Wakunai. During the deployment, one of the RAN Sea King helicopters was fired upon by Papua New Guinea Defence Force personnel while undertaking a surveillance mission. It sustained light damage but returned safely from the mission. The success of the peace talks was limited as some key members withdrew after ongoing military action by Papuan forces who failed to vacate the area. The deployment was hampered by its limited size, which meant it was unable to secure egress routes to the neutral zones that were established around the conference site that was established at Arawa High School; additionally, poor communications impacted upon command and control, and the ongoing presence of criminal gangs and restrictive rules of engagement undermined the confidence of stakeholders to participate in the conference. The hasty nature of the deployment also resulted in limited intelligence gathering, which impacted upon the development of coherent tactical, logistical and communications plans. It also led to inefficient loading of vessels, which had to be rectified once deployed. The Australian involvement was codenamed Operation Lagoon. The force was deployed until 19 October when it began withdrawing. The withdrawal was preceded by a farewell parade in Buka attended by the PNG Prime Minister Julius Chan. Final force elements, including Tobruk had completed withdrawal by sea and air on 21 October. The SPPKF was followed by the New Zealand-led Truce Monitoring Group in 1997 and then the Australian-led Peace Monitoring Group in 1998. ==Notes== ==References== * * ==External links== * Australian War Memorial image Category:1994 in Papua New Guinea Category:Peacekeeping operations Category:Military operations involving Australia Category:Military operations involving New Zealand ","title":"South Pacific Peacekeeping Force"},{"id":"61705689","text":"Sven-Olof Israelsson (born 13 May 1948) is a Swedish skier.

The Mate 30 comprises the Mate 30/5G, Mate 30 Pro/5G, and Mate 30 RS Porsche Design, which were unveiled on 19 September 2019 in Munich, Germany. Due to ongoing U.S. sanctions against Huawei that prevented it from licensing the Google-certified Android with Google mobile services for new devices, international models of the Mate 30 run an Android 10-derived operating system utilizing a Huawei- provided software stack and application store (similarly to other Chinese smartphones sold domestically, as Google does not do business in mainland China). ==Specifications== ===Design=== The Mate 30 and Mate 30 Pro have a similar design, with an aluminum frame and glass backing, and are available in Black, Space Silver, Cosmic Purple and Emerald Green colours, with artificial leather options also available. Both displays contain notches, with the Mate 30 Pro using a larger tab concealing additional infrared sensors used for a facial recognition system. The Mate 30's cutout for the front camera resembles the P20 and P20 Pro, and is larger than the Mate 20's, in order to accommodate a time-of-flight sensor. The camera arrays on the Mate 30 and the Mate 30 Pro are circular, as opposed to the squarish design of the Mate 20 and Mate 20 Pro, and the flash is now offset to the left, separate from the camera housing. The Mate 30 Pro's display has curved edges at 88-degrees which leaves no room for physical volume buttons; virtual controls are used instead. Edge detection and palm rejection are implemented to prevent accidental touches. The Mate 30 Pro also lacks an earpiece, opting to use the same \\"electromagnetic levitation\\" speaker as on the P30 Pro. ===Hardware=== Both models utilize the Kirin 990 system-on-chip, an octa-core SoC featuring Cortex-A76 and Cortex-A55 CPU cores, Mali-G76 MP16 GPU, and a pair of AI accelerators. Six of the Kirin 990's cores are overclocked on the 5G and Porsche Design models. The Mate 30 is available with 128 GB of storage and 6 or 8 GB of RAM, while the Mate 30 Pro is available with 128 or 256 GB of storage and 8 GB of RAM. Both have up to 256 GB of expandable storage via Huawei's proprietary Nano Memory format, which also serves as a hybrid SIM tray. The Mate 30 Pro is rated IP68 for dust and water resistance (up to 2m for 30 mins) while the Mate 30 has IP53 for dust and splash protection. An OLED panel is used for both displays. The Mate 30 uses a 19.5:9 1080p display, while the Mate 30 Pro has a 18.5:9 1080p+ display with curved edges. The Mate 30 Pro's display also supports hovering gestures and Huawei's M-Pen. The Mate 30 is powered by a 4200mAh battery while the Mate 30 Pro has a 4500mAh battery, and both are capable of fast charging at 40W wired and 27W wireless. Both models support Qi inductive charging and can charge other Qi-compatible devices from its own battery power. USB-C connectors are present on both, but only the Mate 30 includes a headphone jack. Both have an optical in-screen fingerprint reader as well. Camera Rear of a Huawei Mate 30 showing its centralised circular quad camera set-up The Mate 30 has three rear cameras: a 40 MP main camera, an 8 MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom and a 16 MP ultrawide lens, along with a 24 MP front camera; the Mate 30 Pro has four rear cameras: a 40 MP main camera, an 8 MP telephoto lens, a 40 MP ultrawide lens and a 3D ToF camera. The Mate 30's camera design is the same as the Mate 30's, and has the laser-autofocus in place of the time-of-flight sensor. The front cameras on both are assisted by a 3D ToF camera, but the Mate 30 Pro has a higher resolution 32 MP sensor compared to the Mate 30's 24 MP sensor. OIS is present on the telephoto lens for both, but the Mate 30 Pro also has OIS on its main lens unlike the Mate 30. While the resolution of the ultrawide-angle lens has been increased, the Mate 30 Pro has a regular telephoto camera and can only achieve 3x optical zoom, 5x hybrid and 30x digital zoom, compared to the P30 Pro's 5x optical, 10x hybrid and 50x digital zoom. The P30 Pro's camera modes have been carried over to the Mate 30 Pro. Night Mode has been improved, and the Mate 30 Pro can take 4K HDR Plus time- lapse and ultraslow-motion video, shooting 720p at 7680 frames per second. Like its predecessor, the Mate 30 series uses Leica optics. ===Software=== The Mate 30 and Mate 30 Pro ship with EMUI 10, which is based on the Android 10 source code. Due to ongoing United States sanctions against Huawei, international models of the Mate 30 do not ship with or support Google Mobile Services — the proprietary software suite (including Google Play-branded software) shipped on certified Android devices, and Huawei is not allowed to market the device using the Android trademark. Huawei is promoting the use of its own in-house platforms as a substitute, including the Huawei AppGallery store (which is already used on Chinese models of Huawei's devices due to Google not doing business there). Huawei stated that it would make a US$1 billion investment in promoting software development and growth of AppGallery. As with other Android devices, third-party apps can still be sideloaded via APK files, though full compatibility is not guaranteed if the app depends on Google services. A Huawei executive stated that the company had planned to allow bootloader unlocks for the Mate 30, which could have promoted the development of custom operating system ROMs that do support Google's apps. However, the company later stated that it had \\"no plans\\" to do so. In late- September 2019, a tool named \\"LZPlay\\" surfaced, which allowed the Google mobile services apps to be installed on the Mate 30. The app was found to use undocumented permissions within Huawei's mobile device management APIs. On October 1, 2019, after the publication of an article that revealed these mechanics, the app's website abruptly went offline, and devices that had used LZPlay began to fail Google's SafetyNet verification checks. In June 2020, Huawei announced the EMUI 10.1 update, which includes new first-party apps such as Celia and the video calling service MeeTime, multi-window mode, and various user interface tweaks. ==Model variations== ===Porsche Design=== The Porsche Design Huawei Mate 30 RS is a special edition of the Mate 30 Pro; its rear cover has a black or two-tone black and red racing stripe inspired glass/leather design, while it features 512 GB of storage and 12 GB of RAM. ==Reception== Engadget called the Mate 30 Pro \\"a device with staggering imaging and video capabilities that is hamstrung by its poor, or nonexistent, app selection\\", while Digital Trends concluded that the Mate 30 Pro is \\"the best smartphone you can't buy\\". Andrew Williams of Wired UK was more critical of the device, giving it a 5/10. He praised the cameras, battery life, design and hardware, while panning the lack of Google apps, the gesture volume control and screen vignetting. Huawei Mate 30 Pro received an overall score of 121 from DXOMARK, overtaking the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ 5G. The device had a photo score of 131, a video score of 100, and a selfie score of 93. ==See also== *Comparison of smartphones *List of Huawei phones ==References== ==External links== * Huawei Mate 30 * Huawei Mate 30 Pro Category:Smartphones Category:Android (operating system) devices Category:Huawei mobile phones Category:Phablets Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2019 Category:Phones with multiple rear cameras Category:Mobile phones with 4K video recording ","title":"Huawei Mate 30"},{"id":"61705707","text":"The International Dialogue on Population and Sustainable Development is an annual international conference that has been held in Berlin since 2002, organised by the German Foundation for World Population, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), KfW Entwicklungsbank in close cooperation with the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and Development (BMZ), Bayer AG.

Its leader is Carlo Calenda, a member of the European Parliament and former Minister of Economic Development (2016–2018). Calenda has described his party as \\"anti- populist\\" and \\"anti-souverainist\\". ==History== In January 2019 Calenda, a member of the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), launched a political manifesto named \\"We Are Europeans\\", with the aim of creating a joint list composed of the PD and other progressive and pro-Europeanist parties for the upcoming European Parliament election. His proposal was welcomed by new PD's leader, Nicola Zingaretti, but was rejected by the other parties within the centre-left coalition, like More Europe and Italy in Common, which decided not to join the alliance. Carlo Calenda in 2019 In the run-up to the European election, Zingaretti and Calenda presented a special logo including a large reference to \\"We Are Europeans\\" and the symbol of the Party of European Socialists. Additionally, they forged an alliance with Article One, a party established in 2017 by splinters from the PD led by Pier Luigi Bersani. In the election, the PD gained 22.7% of votes, coming second after the League, while Calenda, who ran in the North-East constituency, received more than 270,000 votes, becoming the most voted candidate of the list. In August 2019 tensions grew within the coalition supporting the Giuseppe Conte's first government, leading to the issuing of a motion of no-confidence by the League. During the following government crisis, the national board of the PD officially opened to the possibility of forming a new cabinet in a coalition with the M5S, based on pro-Europeanism, green economy, sustainable development, fight against economic inequality and a new immigration policy. The party also accepted that Conte might continue at the head of a new government, and on 29 August President Mattarella formally invested Conte to do so. Calenda strongly opposed the new government, stating the PD had renounced any representation of \\"reformists\\", so it became necessary to found a \\"liberal-progressive\\" movement. Calenda left the PD and on 5 September 2019, while Conte's second government was sworn in, and officially announced the transformation of SE into a full-fledged party. On 10 September Matteo Richetti, a prominent senator of the PD, announced his abstention from the vote of confidence on the new government and his subsequent exit from the party. He stated that he would join forces with Calenda. In November 2019 the new party was officially launched as \\"Action\\". After a few months, Calenda launched the \\"Action Groups\\", the party's local sections.Azione – Gruppi d'Azione, azione.it In August 2020 two deputies joined Action: former minister Enrico Costa, who left Forza Italia, and Nunzio Angiola, a former member of the Five Star Movement.Nunzio Angiola archivia M5s e passa con Calenda: è il secondo parlamentare per Azione, la Repubblica == Electoral results == === Regional Councils === {class= style=\\"width:50%; border:1px #AAAAFF solid\\" - !width=19%Region !width=13%Election year !width=16%Votes !width=7%% !width=1%Seats !width=6%+/− - !Emilia-Romagna !2020 into BP –  – } ==Leadership== *Leader: Carlo Calenda (2019–present) ==Symbols== Azione logo.pngAction logo Siamo Europei Logo.pngWe Are Europeans logo ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:2019 establishments in Italy Category:Liberal parties in Italy Category:Democratic Party (Italy) breakaway groups Category:Political parties established in 2019 ","title":"Action (Italy)"},{"id":"61705713","text":"Libor Foltman (born 11 July 1948) is a Czech skier.

Durgin Company, gold, circa 1900 The William B. Durgin Company (1853 - 1924) was a noted American sterling silver manufacturer based in Concord, New Hampshire, and one of the largest flatware and hollowware manufacturers in the United States. Over the period 1905-1924 it was merged into the Gorham Manufacturing Company. The company was founded by silversmith William Butler Durgin (July 29, 1833 - May 6, 1905). Durgin was born in Campton, New Hampshire, and from 1849-1853 apprenticed to Boston silversmith Newell Harding. In the 1840s Durgin moved back to Concord, where he opened a small shop making spoons opposite the Free Bridge Road. He incorporated as William B. Durgin Company in 1853, in 1854 added the manufacture of silverware, and in 1866 established a large brick factory on School Street. In 1905, after the death of both Durgin and his son, George E. Durgin, the company was acquired by Gorham through a long process that culminated with an official purchase in 1924. Production was moved to Providence, Rhode Island, in 1931. The company made the Davis Cup, the silver service for the battleship USS New Hampshire, and medals for St. Paul's School. Its Fairfax flatware was for some years the best-selling pattern in the United States. Other of the company's patterns included Bead, Chatham, Chrysanthemum, Cromwell, Dauphin, English Rose, Essex, Fairfax, Hunt Club, Iris, Lenox, Louis XV, Madame Royale, Marechal Niel, New Vintage, Orange Blossom, Sheaf of Wheat, Victorian/Sheraton, and Watteau. == References == * William B.

Her father was a civil servant and one of the founding members of the Gaelic Athletic Association while her mother was an Irish activist, feminist, politician and businesswoman. Her family ran a restaurant in Henry Street and leading Irish nationalists were regular visitors. Her sister, Máire, was also a Celtic scholar. Wyse Power joined the Gaelic League in 1902 and was on the Women's committee of Sinn Féin. She went to University College Dublin (UCD) where she graduated with a degree in 1912 in Celtic Studies. She followed the bachelor's degree with a doctorate in the University of Bonn, Germany. But in 1915 she was forced to return to Ireland because of the First World War. It took until 1920 before she was able to finish, studying under Julius Pokorny. She had specialised in Celtic Philology. ==Activism and career== When in Ireland in 1915 Wyse Power joined Cumann na mBan. She was active in the week leading up to the Easter Rising and knew that the rising was due to go ahead. Bulmer Hobson asked her to be a courier and she carried messages including to Terence MacSwiney in Cork and to Carlow on Easter Monday. She worked out of the General Post Office, Dublin during Easter week carrying messages and moving provisions. In 1917, she, with her mother, worked to provide relief for families who lost members or had members in prison. Late in 1917 she was appointed one of the secretaries of Cumann na nBan and helped to rebuild the organisation to over 500 branches by 1920. One of the events she was involved in was Lá na mBan, 9 June 1918. She was also recommended by Constance Markievicz to substitute for her if the leadership of Sinn Féin was arrested. Wyse Power was active throughout the Irish war of Independence. Wyse Power was recruited by the new Dáil's foreign service to work with their German affairs. In April 1921 she set up the offices of the Irish mission in Berlin where she was also involved in restarting the Irish Bulletin. John Chartres was later leader of the political office, Charles Bewley was leader of the trade mission in Berlin and he suggested both Wyse Power and Chartres had anti-treaty sympathies and had both of them recalled. However, since Wyse Power was not anti-treating she then joined Department of Industry and Commerce. She worked there from 1923 to 1932 when Sean T. O'Kelly requested her to work in the Department of Local Government and Public Health as his personal private secretary. As one of the first women to get to the position of principal officer in the civil service Wyse Power acted as an advocate for women. She also worked as a governor of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, a position to which she was appointed in 1940. Wyse Power retired from the civil service in 1954. She was president of the UCD Women Graduates' Association from 1959-62.

She became the first woman to complete the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales qualification but was denied membership because she was a woman. When the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act was passed in 1919, Harris Smith became the world's first female Chartered Accountant. == Early life == Mary Harris Smith was born to Susanna and Henry Smith in Kingsland, London in 1844. She developed an interest in accounting from helping her banker father with bookkeeping work that he brought home. When Harris Smith was sixteen, she studied mathematics at King's College School. She went on to take some of the first bookkeeping classes run by the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women (SPEW) in 1860. == Career == Smith worked for a mercantile firm in the City of London for nine years and then went to work as an accountant for the Royal School of Art Needlework. She also audited other organisations' accounts. Harris Smith set up her own accounting firm in 1887, listing herself as 'M. Harris Smith, Accountant and Auditor' except in women's periodicals where she described herself as a 'lady accountant'. Harris Smith sought to join the Society of Accountants and Auditors in November 1887, but the president blocked her application. A subsequent resolution on the admission of women was turned down in May 1891. In July 1891, Harris Smith applied to be a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The applications committee recommended her admission, but the solicitor of the organisation said that she was not eligible because the royal charter only referred to males; she was therefore rejected. Emily Davies, connected to Harris Smith via SPEW, then sought for women to be admitted in 1893, but this was also unsuccessful. Harris Smith requested to sit the Institute's examinations in 1896 but was refused. In 1919, following the passing of the Representation of the People Act 1918 and the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act, Harris Smith applied again to the Society of Accountants and Auditors, which had changed its rules. She was not eligible to be admitted because she had not passed the organisation's examinations, but she was made an honorary member on 12 November 1919. When Harris Smith was in her seventies, in May 1920, she was finally admitted to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and became a fellow of the Institute and the first woman chartered accountant. == Feminist campaigning == Harris Smith supported various causes seeking to advance women, including the Parliamentary Committee for Women's Suffrage, the Society for the Return of Women as Poor Law Guardians, the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women, the National Union of Women Workers, the Gentlewoman's Employment Club and the Soroptimist Club. == Death and commemoration == Mary Harris Smith, FCA and honorary incorporated accountant, died in a medical nursing home in St Leonards-on-Sea on 7 August 1934. Upon her appointment in 2019, Fiona Wilkinson, the first woman President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, announced that one of her aims was to celebrate the centenary of Mary Harris Smith becoming a chartered accountant and member.

The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) split up the competing countries into six different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot. On 28 January 2020, a special allocation draw was held which placed each country into one of the two semi-finals, as well as which half of the show they would perform in. Croatia was placed into the first semi-final, to be held on 12 May 2020, and was scheduled to perform in the second half of the show. However, due to 2019-20 pandemic of Coronavirus, the contest was cancelled. ==References== ==External links== * Eurovision Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 Category:Croatia in the Eurovision Song Contest ","title":"Croatia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020"},{"id":"61707623","text":"Kurt Sjolund (born 7 January 1955) is a Canadian skier.

Her southern Sami family was involved with reindeer herding, and her father was a pioneer in organizing the Sami community. At home, the family spoke southern Sami, and she did not learn Norwegian until she started at the Sami school in Havika outside Namsos in the late 1930s. Her interest in the South Sami language was aroused while attending school. When she took the examen artium at an early age, she had Southern Sami as a second language instead of Nynorsk. Jacobsen went on to study Northern Sami, German and South Sami at the university level, and became the first to be examined in South Sami. At her home in Majavatn, Jacobsen organized a language group to grow the Sami language. The participants were only allowed to speak Sami. She also taught Sami in several schools. In the 1970s, she was active in preserving the Sami school in Hattfjelldal, and she was also the spokeswoman for an action to create a Sami cultural center in the village, known later as Sijti Jarnge. She was also active in the work to start a Southern Sami theater. Jacobsen was a language consultant for the Sami Education Council from 1987 to 1991, and worked actively on publishing dictionaries. Samiske stedsnavn. Grane og Hattfjelldal. Anna Jacobsen intervjuet av Trond Raaum; NRK, 1988 (in Norwegian) For several years, she was responsible for South Sami at NRK. The children's book, Åvla (2013), is based on fairy tales she told in NRK Sápmi. Interviews and other audio recordings of Jacobsen are published by the National Archives of Norway. Jacobsen started her own publishing company where she published several texts. Together with Bierna Bientie, she translated the Gospel of St. Mark into Southern Sami. This was published by the Norwegian Bible Society in 1993 under the title, Jupmelen rijhke lea castskes (Kingdom of God is near). In Salmer 1997, there are four texts, which she translated into Southern Sami, and in Norsk salmebok 2013, she has four translations and a distinctive text.

He became best known for his breakthrough hit \\"Roller\\" in August 2019, which would be the first of several more Top 10 hits. ==Life and career== Little about Apache 207's private life is known to the public. He finished high school in 2017 with a high-school diploma in Ludwigshafen. The rapper started his mainstream career in June 2018 when he released his debut single \\"Kleine Hure\\" still without label support. The song was followed up by seven other singles, released over the course of six months. In early 2019, he was signed to musician Bausa's label TwoSides. The first single to be released under the label was \\"Kein Problem\\" in April 2019. Initially, the song garnered little attention and did not peak in Germany until late October 2019, at 17. However, the song's music video reached over eight million clicks on YouTube in the following months. In May 2019, he earned his first chart entry in Germany with the release \\"Brot nach Hause\\". Even though the single \\"2 Minuten\\" climbed up to 35 in Germany, his chart success remained moderate. On 23 August 2019, he released \\"Roller\\" which would debut at number two. In the following week, it reached number one on the chart. In Austria and Switzerland, the song peaked within the Top 10. His follow-up releases \\"200 km/h\\" and \\"2002\\" with Sido became Top 10 hits as well. He achieved his second number one in Germany with the single \\"Wieso tust du dir das an?\\" in October 2019.

She worked as a healer around the St Andrews area with a ghost of her uncle, William Simpson, as a spirit guide. Simpson's ghost associated with fairies and a vision of him had cured Pearson of illness when she was a child. == Witchcraft == She was investigated for witchcraft in 1583 by Patrick Adamson, Archbishop of St Andrews, however when he was ill and others could not cure him treatment by Pearson led to his full recovery. Adamson's enemies claimed this was witchcraft and Pearson was imprisoned in St Andrews Castle, from where Adamson helped her to escape.David Hay Fleming, Register of St Andrews Kirk Session, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1890), pp. 508-9. Scottish Ballad-writer, Robert Sempill, wrote about Pearson and Adamson. == Investigation and conviction == In 1588 she was again investigated and tried for witchcraft, which led to her conviction and execution by burning. One of the charges against her was that \\"she had concocted for the archbishop a beverage of ewe's milk, claret, herbs, &c.;, making ‘ane quart att anis, quhilk he drank att twa drachtis, twa sindrie dyetis’ (Pitcairn's Criminal Trials, i. 165).\\" Her confession included details of being taken by \\"ane lusty mane, with mony mene and wemen\\" to the fairy court.

Crozier spent the time between 1918–1925 as a professor at different schools including the University of Illinois Medical School and the University of Chicago. In 1927, he became a professor at Harvard where he worked until he retired. He ran a General Physiology laboratory at the University of Harvard, which attracted many young researchers, the most notable being B.F. Skinner. Crozier spent his time studying the different types of tropisms, as well as the different factors that affected the behaviour of tropisms. Crozier came up with the \\"parametric analysis\\" of behaviour, which he believed to be his greatest contribution. In terms of his work in the field of sensory processing, Crozier contributed to the Handbook of General Experimental Psychology, in 1934, by writing a chapter about chemoreception. Throughout his life, Crozier wrote a total of about 300 scientific papers. He died in Belmont in 1955 at the age of 63 due to a heart attack. ==Education and early life== William John Crozier was born on May 24, 1892 in New York City to William George Crozier and Bessie Mackay. Crozier started his education at the College of the City of New York, pursuing a degree in physical chemistry and biochemistry. He graduated with an undergraduate degree in 1912 before continuing his education in zoology at Harvard and obtaining a PhD in 1915. Having a passion for zoology, Crozier spent the next three years conducting research about the behaviours of various marine organisms at the Bermuda Biological Station. During these three years of conducting research on marine organisms, Crozier wrote a chapter about chemoreception for the Handbook of General Experimental Psychology. ==Research and academic career== Between the years 1918 and 1925, Crozier was named assistant professor at many different schools: in 1918–1919, he was named assistant professor of physiology at the University of Illinois Medical School; in 1919 he was named assistant professor of zoology at the University of Chicago; in 1920–1925, he was named professor and head of the department of zoology at Rutgers University; and in 1925, he was named associate professor and head of the Department of General Physiology at Harvard University. After years of being an assistant professor, Crozier was named a full professor at Harvard University in 1927. Crozier studied marine biology and animal behaviour using experimental design and parametric analysis. He used this methodology in order to study visual processes. Crozier and his students divided their research into two main fields: the first having to do with tropisms, and the second having to do with studying the effects that temperature had on the actions in poikilothermic organisms, as well as its effects on biological oxidation. Crozier spent most of his time studying different physiological phenomena. However, he influenced the field of experimental psychology through his works regarding animal behaviour as well as various sensory processes. Cozier also contributed to the field of ophthalmology through his focus on the mechanisms of light stimulus on vision. ==Influences== During Crozier’s time at Harvard, students became interested in him and his work, particularly in the general physiology lab. This helped Cozier gain more lab support. One of the students influenced by Crozier was B. F. Skinner. Crozier was exploring the ways in which different environmental forces could have an effect on an organism's behaviour, which he and Skinner both understood as the study of reflexes. Their research would go on to influence Skinner in his studies of behaviourism. Jacques Loeb, a teacher that Crozier was influenced by, and Crozier are linked to B. F. Skinner's application of the word organism. Skinner studied entire unharmed organism's behaviours instead of studying their reflexes by opening the organism and viewing mechanisms separately. He was influenced by Loeb who always talked about studying organisms without surgically harming them, and instead looking at them in their entirety. Skinner was able to go through with his studies on this topic by being under the watch of William John Crozier. ==Legacy== Crozier influenced Charles Winsor, a statistician, who later went on to develop the theory of Winsorization,Cochran, William G. (May 1951). \\"Charles Paine Winsor: Editor of \\"Human Biology\\"\\". Human Biology. 23 (2). JSTOR 41447995 and influenced B.F. Skinner and the field of psychology. Crozier's research also spanned to the United Kingdom where the British Journal of Ophthalmology published an obituary highlighting his research having influenced the Institute of Ophthalmology in London. ==References== Category:American psychologists Category:1892 births Category:1955 deaths Category:Writers from New York City Category:City College of New York alumni Category:University of Illinois at Chicago faculty Category:University of Chicago faculty Category:Rutgers University faculty Category:Harvard University faculty Category:Harvard University alumni Category:20th-century psychologists ","title":"William John Crozier"},{"id":"61708214","text":"Salako is a hat worn in French Antilles.

The first war crimes trial related to the atrocities committed in Syria, concluded on 12 July 2016 in Germany, was the case of Aria L. performed under the Völkerstrafgesetzbuch (Code of Crimes against International Law (CCAIL)). == Background == According to three international lawyers,Sir Desmond de Silva QC, former chief prosecutor of the special court for Sierra Leone, Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, the former lead prosecutor of former Yugoslavian president Slobodan Milošević, and Professor David Crane, who indicted President Charles Taylor of Liberia at the Sierra Leone court Syrian government officials were expected to risk facing war crimes charges in the light of a huge cache of evidence smuggled out of the country showing the \\"systematic killing\\" of about 11,000 detainees, constituting the 2014 Syrian detainee report. Most of the victims were young men and many corpses were emaciated, bloodstained and bore signs of torture. Some had no eyes; others showed signs of strangulation or electrocution. Experts said this evidence was more detailed and on a far larger scale than anything else that had emerged from the then 34-month crisis. The United Nations (UN) summarised the human rights situation by stating that \\"siege warfare is employed in a context of egregious human rights and international humanitarian law violations. The warring parties do not fear being held accountable for their acts.\\" Armed forces of both sides of the conflict blocked access of humanitarian convoys, confiscated food, cut off water supplies and targeted farmers working their fields. The report pointed to four places besieged by the government forces: Muadamiyah, Daraya, Yarmouk camp and Old City of Homs, as well as two areas under siege of rebel groups: Aleppo and Hama. In Yarmouk Camp 20,000 residents are facing death by starvation due to blockade by the Syrian government forces and fighting between the army and Jabhat al-Nusra, which prevents food distribution by UNRWA. In July 2015, the UN quietly removed Yarmouk from its list of besieged areas in Syria, despite not having been able deliver aid there for four months, and declined to explain why it had done so. ISIS forces have been accused by the UN of using public executions, amputations, and lashings in a campaign to instill fear. \\"Forces of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham have committed torture, murder, acts tantamount to enforced disappearance and forced displacement as part of attacks on the civilian population in Aleppo and Raqqa governorates, amounting to crimes against humanity\\", said the report from 27 August 2014. Enforced disappearances and arbitrary detentions have also been a feature since the Syrian uprising began. An Amnesty International report, published in November 2015, accused the Syrian government of forcibly disappearing more than 65,000 people since the beginning of the Syrian Civil War. According to a report in May 2016 by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least 60,000 people have been killed since March 2011 through torture or from poor humanitarian conditions in Syrian government prisons.Monitor: 60,000 dead in Syria government jails Al Jazeera In February 2017, Amnesty International published a report which accused the Syrian government of murdering an estimated 13,000 persons, mostly civilians, at the Saydnaya military prison. They said the killings began in 2011 and were still ongoing. Amnesty International described this as a \\"policy of deliberate extermination\\" and also stated that \\"These practices, which amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, are authorised at the highest levels of the Syrian government.\\" Three months later, the United States State Department stated a crematorium had been identified near the prison. According to the U.S., it was being used to burn thousands of bodies of those killed by the government's forces and to cover up evidence of atrocities and war crimes. Amnesty International expressed surprise at the claims about the crematorium, as the photographs used by the US are from 2013 and they did not see them as conclusive, and fugitive government officials have stated that the government buries those its executes in cemeteries on military grounds in Damascus. The Syrian government denied the allegations. === Perpetrators === Four key security agencies have overseen government repression in Syria: the General Security Directorate, the Political Security Branch, the Military Intelligence Branch, and the Air Force Intelligence Branch. All three corps of the Syrian army have been deployed in a supporting role to the security forces; the civilian police have been involved in crowd control. The shabiha, led by the security forces, also participated in abuses. Since Hafez al-Assad's rule, individuals from the Alawite minority have controlled (although they not always formally headed) these four agencies, as well as several elite military units, and comprise the bulk of them. Groups operated under the Syrian territory includes the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. === Syrian Legal framework === Four of the international instruments ratified by Syria and which apply to events in the civil war are particularly relevant: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR); the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the Convention on the Rights of the Child; and the UN Convention Against Torture. Syria is not a party to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, although it is bound by the provisions of the ICCPR that also prohibit enforced disappearances. === International (International law) - National courts (Universal jurisdiction)? === All governments manage their territories with national laws. Prosecution for war crimes under the national laws of a given country [Germany, Netherlands ...] would typically depend on either the accused, the victim's residence or the occurrence of the event being in that country. Universal jurisdiction bypasses this constraint. In this mechanism, the \\"cases\\" that have no connection to the territory [e.g. crimes in high seas] have been used by prosecutors and have been criticized by human rights organisations as leading to a de facto presence requirement [e.g. existence of a crime can not be solved through collecting unbiased evidence from the crime scene, as the court don't have untethered access]. There are many perpetrators residing in Syria [the occurrence, the accused (is a Syrian national), the victim (is a Syrian national)]. International crimes are typically state crimes. If [since] a state is connected to a crime (directly or indirectly), most of the powerful perpetrators (state officials) reside in Syria. In such situations, the International Court of Justice is the judicial organ to settle international legal disputes submitted by states (UN) against other states. == International court == Richard Haass has argued that one way to encourage top-level defections is to \\"threaten war-crimes indictments by a certain date, say, August 15, for any senior official who remains a part of the government and is associated with its campaign against the Syrian people. Naming these individuals would concentrate minds in Damascus.\\" Nevertheless, it remains unlikely in the short term, and some would argue this is a blessing in disguise, since this precludes the ICC's involvement while the conflict is still raging, a development that would arguably only increase the Assad government's violent obstinacy. The \\"United States cannot halt or reverse the militarization of the Syrian uprising, and should not try. What the United States can usefully do is manage this militarization by working with other governments, especially Syria’s neighbors in the region, to try to shape the activities of armed elements on the ground in a manner that will most effectively increase pressure on the regime\\". On 22 December 2016, with 105 votes in favour and 15 against, with 52 abstentions, the United Nations General Assembly has voted to establish an \\"independent panel to assist in the investigation and prosecution of those responsible for war crimes or crimes against humanity in Syria\\". === Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria === The U.N. General Assembly created a new entity, the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism, to build investigative files for future prosecutions, Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria (COI). On Wednesday, 7 August 2019, the UN Security Council was briefed on the recent findings [war crimes] by the COI. === International Criminal Court === The U.N. Security Council has refused to address the crimes in Syria through ICC. United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay and others have called for Syria to be referred to the International Criminal Court; however, it would be difficult for this to take place with within the foreseeable future because Syria is not a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, meaning the ICC has no jurisdiction there. Referral could alternatively happen via the Security Council, but Russia and China would block. Marc Lynch, who is in favour of a referral, noted a couple of other routes to the ICC were possible, and that overcoming Chinese and Russian opposition was not impossible. === Special Tasked Court === Outside of the ICC, \\"some believe it would be possible to set up an ad hoc tribunal with a mandate to prosecute atrocities in Syria and Iraq. Such a tribunal would likely come in the form of a hybrid court and include a mix of domestic and international prosecutors and judges. Numerous observers, primarily American scholars and lawmakers, have pushed the establishment of such an institution, going so far as to draft a 'blueprint' for institution's statute. As with an ICC referral, their efforts have been unsuccessful to date.\\"Mark Kersten, Calls for prosecuting war crimes in Syria are growing. Is international justice possible? , Washington Post (14 October 2016). Mark Kersten of the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, however, notes that it would be an \\"unprecedented challenge\\" to \\"prosecute all sides in the war that have committed war crimes\\" while at the same time retaining \\"the support of the major actors in the Syrian civil war, many of whom are implicated and would be prosecuted, for those war crimes.\\" == National courts == The European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR) is using both its own employees and other volunteers (Syrian lawyers working in EU member states) to gather evidence and establish cases. === Netherlands === Netherlands is using concept of universal jurisdiction (Dutch version) laws to prosecute their cases. On 2 September 2019, Ahmad al Khedr, also known as Abu Khuder, faced charges of murder and membership of a terrorist group. === Germany === Germany has legally enacted universal jurisdiction (used on pirates and slave traders) to allow prosecutions for war crimes committed anywhere, against any people of any citizenship. German authorities started conduct a background inquiry to gather information in 2011. The aim (Strukturverfahren) was to establish war crimes cases, whether in Germany or in courts elsewhere (such as the International Criminal Court). The investigative/protective units are organised under the federal prosecutor's office with 11 staff members, and 17 war-crimes police officers. The police war-crimes unit established a total of 17 cases from 2011 to 2013 and 2,590 from 2014 to 2016. Under the Völkerstrafgesetzbuch (Code of Crimes against International Law (CCAIL)), the first German war crimes trial related to atrocities committed in the Syrian Civil War was the case of Aria L., a German who had been involved in Islamist and Salafist groups in Germany since 2013 and had travelled to Idlib in Syria in 2014. Aria L. was photographed in three separate photos in front of severed heads of Syrian army members mounted on metal spears. He was convicted of the war crime of treating protected persons in a gravely humiliating or degrading manner and sentence to two years' imprisonment on 12 July 2016. German prosecutors charged two Syrians, Kamel T. and Azad R. in 2016 and Basel A. and Majed A. in 2018, for joining Salafist militant group such as Ahrar al-Sham and Jabhat al-Nusra. On 23 August 2019, a 33-year-old Syrian (name undisclosed) was charged in the western Germany city of Koblenz with committing war crimes. In late October 2019, two Syrians suspected of having been secret service officers, Anwar Raslan and Eyad al-Gharib, were arrested in Germany and charged with crimes against humanity. Anwar Raslan was charged with 59 counts of murder, and rape and sexual assault. Eyad al-Gharib was charged with aiding and abetting a crime against humanity. Part of the evidence was based on the photographs of the 2014 Syrian detainee report, taken by a former Syrian military police photographer, nicknamed Caesar for security reasons. In May 2020, a Syrian doctor, Hafiz A., from Homs was accused of beating and torturing rebel men by the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe. In June 2020, another Syrian doctor from Homs, Alaa Moussa, was arrested in Hesse on suspicion of crimes against humanity. In September 2020, during the trial of Anwar Raslan and Eyad al-Gharib in Koblenz, some documents were acquired from the Branch 251 intelligence unit in Syria, which showed the move of corpses from the unit to military hospitals. === Sweden === On 19 February 2019, nine torture survivors submitted a criminal complaint against Syrian officials. == Notes == == References == Notes Citations Category:Syrian Civil War crimes Category:Human rights in Syria Category:War crimes trials ","title":"Prosecution of Syrian civil war criminals"},{"id":"61708396","text":"In chemistry, an addition-elimination reaction is a two-stage reaction process of an addition reaction followed by an elimination reaction.

Mutual deceit is a situation wherein lying is both accepted and expected or that the parties mutually accept the deceit in question. This can be demonstrated in the case of a poker game wherein the strategies rely on deception and bluffing to win. == Concept == The idea of mutual deceit has been used during the ancient times. Homer and Hesiod, for example, cited it along with theft and adultery to describe the attributes of the Greek gods that men found reproachful. These were evident in the way the gods mistreated each other, a position that was also noted by Plato as part of his criticism of the poets in the Republic. Blaise Pascal also used mutual deceit to describe human society, citing man's capability for \\"disguise, falsehood, and hypocrisy both in himself and in regard to others\\". Mutual deceit today is considered one of the most cited exception to telling the truth, particularly when the receiver of the information recognizes that the message being communicated is untrue. Mutuality, however, is essential and that if the participants do not know the rules or do not accept them, then it is not considered mutual deceit. == Applications == Mutual deceit can be demonstrated in a film when an actor assumes a role. For example, if he plays Romeo in Romeo and Juliet, the audience watching understands what is happening - that the actor is not what he claims to be. Here, the untruth is given because everyone understands the fiction. In business, mutual deceit is phrased as a form of collusion that constructs a double reality for those inside of or participating in it. It is aligned with the notion that truthfulness does not have an intrinsic value in business. It is distinguished from the notion of dual morality, which holds that personal values, particularly on the part of managers, must be set aside in order to focus on generating profits for shareholders. In mutual deceit, the untruths are permissible because they do not constitute lies. The reason is that if the source of information knows that those who receive it understands that it is untrue, then, no deception occurs. The spot exchange market also has some mutual deceit characteristics. Participants understand and accept that the seller underreport their true willingness-to-accept while buyers do the same for their true willingness-to-pay. In some cases, even if the buyer does not accept that the seller lies, he is implicitly doing so by entering or participating in the market. Karl Marx, in his criticism of capitalism, cited mutual deceit as an offshoot of every new product created within the bourgeois society. The idea is that when such economic system creates a new need, man is willing to offer a new sacrifice in order to satisfy his own ego. This theme has been explored further in Marx's discourse of the power of money and its relationship with man's needs. == References == Category:Lying Category:Deception Category:Communication of falsehoods Category:Ethics Category:Disinformation Category:Psychological warfare techniques ","title":"Mutual deceit"},{"id":"61708447","text":"Deborah Hankinson was a justice of the Supreme Court of Texas.

Her father was known as the youngest bank manager in Irish history in the 1880s when he took on the job at age 24. Keogh Got her education in the Catholic girl's school at St. Mary's Priory, Warwickshire and Alexandra College Dublin as well as spending time studying in the Metropolitan School of Art. From 1922 Keogh spent two years of travel around Africa and Europe with a governess. After she returned to London to study she got a job offer from her father to work with Joseph Keogh and Company Stockbroking. ==Career== No stock exchange had ever had a woman working in one before and the suggestion was not completely accepted. But Ireland had a new constitution which guaranteed equality and there was no reason to reject Keogh except for her gender. With her education and wealth, she was fully qualified for the role. It took three weeks to be discussed and voted on but 4 May 1925 she joined the stock exchange. She worked there for fourteen years. It was 42 years before the next woman was admitted to a stock exchange. Keogh experienced typical difficulties of being the only woman in a male-dominated industry. In an interview in 1971, she said: Disagreements with her father encouraged her to take some time off and visit her sisters Eta and Genevieve in Hampshire in England. It was there she met her husband. ==Personal life== Keogh married Russian émigré Bayan Giltsof. When she married Keogh resigned from her father's company but not from the Stock Exchange. She gave them notice of her new name and status. However, initially, she moved to Taunton, Somerset, England with her husband. There they began a building business and developed Tudor houses. She had a daughter Tatiana born 1935 and two sons Rurik, in 1937 and Nicholi 1939. Her fourth child Bayan was born in 1945. After her father's business went bankrupt, there was a court case involving one of his creditors. Keogh had lodged shares with a bank which was now claiming that they were owed against the company debts. Her father had not removed her name from the company documents and Keogh was found to owe the money, and thus also the court costs. The family sold up the British home and moved back to Ireland. They bought land in Wicklow and created a set of houses known as The Russian Village. Irish President Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh retired there in 1976. In 1952 the family moved again to Ontario but they returned to England in 1953. Shortly after this, the couple separated. Giltsof returned to Wicklow until his death in 1977. Keogh moved with her daughter's family to Madrid. There she taught English in an international primary school. 1980 saw her return to Dublin with her daughter after her daughter's husband died. Both women died within eight days of each other in 1989, Keogh preceded by her daughter. They are buried in the family grave in Deansgrange Cemetery. ==References and sources== Category:1903 births Category:1989 deaths Category:People educated at Alexandra College Category:Women stockbrokers Category:People from Dublin (city) Category:20th-century Irish women Category:Alumni of the National College of Art and Design Category:Irish expatriates in Spain Category:Irish expatriates in England Category:Irish expatriates in Canada ","title":"Oonah Keogh"},{"id":"61708497","text":"Kytki-Yelga () is a rural locality (a village) in Nizhnebaltachevsky Selsoviet, Tatyshlinsky District, Bashkortostan, Russia.

A documentary film about the find — Dawson City: Frozen Time — was released in 2016. ==Description== The 533 film reels date from \\"between 1903 and 1929 and were uncovered in the rubble beneath [an] old hockey rink\\". Works by Pearl White, Helen Holmes, Grace Cunard, Lois Weber, Harold Lloyd, Douglas Fairbanks and Lon Chaney, among others, were included. Along with the lost feature films, there was also rare footage of historic events, including the 1919 World Series. ==History== Beginning in 1903, the Dawson Amateur Athletic Association (DAAA) began showing films in Dawson City, Yukon, Canada. The unreturned films were deposited in the local Canadian Bank of Commerce and later stored in the local Carnegie Library basement. The DAAA later converted a swimming pool to an ice rink, but because of improper conversion the ice rink suffered from uneven temperatures in the middle of the rink. In 1929, Clifford Thomson, then-employed by the Canadian Bank of Commerce and also treasurer of the hockey association, solved the problem of the library's stock of film and the inadequate ice rink. Thomson took 500,000 feet of film and stacked the reels in the pool, covered the reels with boards and leveled the rink with a layer of earth. The DAAA continued to receive new nitrate films which would later fuel the destruction of the entire complex in a fire in 1951. The films stored under the ice rink were preserved and uncovered in 1978 when a new recreation center was being built. The Dawson Film Find material was collected and preserved, with these prints becoming the last surviving records of some movie studios. Owing to its dangerous chemical volatility, the historical find was moved by military transport to Library and Archives Canada and the U.S. Library of Congress for both transfer to safety film and storage. ==List of Films in the Dawson Film Find== Not all films are complete, as some were too damaged to restore in their entirety. *A Trip through Palestine (1907) *Pasquali and co (1909) *The Girl of the Northern Woods (1910), Thanhouser *Birth of Flowers (1911) *Elephant Racing at Perak (1911) *The New Woman and The Lion (1912) *A Chrismas accident (1912) *Out of the Deep End (1912) *The Martyrs (1912) *His Madonna (1912) *The Frog (1912) *Giuseppe’s good fortune (1912) *Circumstantial evidence (1912) *A Winter's visit to Central Park (1912) *The Butler and the Maid (1912), Thomas A.

He was killed by police after attempting to entice a Swiss man to his death, and upon investigation, it was discovered that he had killed and eaten two women who had volunteered themselves to be murdered and cannibalized. Soon afterwards, police from Italy announced that the killer could be responsible for up to 28 other disappearances since 2009. ==Early life== Matej Čurko was born as one of two sons to a fairly average family, but his parents divorced at a young age. Matej and his brother, who were not close, were looked after by their mother and grandmother; although they kept in regular contact with their father. Despite being born with the help of a C-Section, Čurko had no recorded illness or injuries at preschool age, passed kindergarten without complications, and even attended a school for mathematically gifted pupils, as he was skilled in technical areas. He was not popular at school, but neither was he bullied or humiliated. Čurko's hobbies were mostly solitary ones, including cycling, playing guitar or drums, using computers and programming them. He was described as a rebel and provocateur by his teachers, as he had trouble keeping respect for the authorities. At age 13, he attacked his 11-year-old neighbor with a knife, causing the boy serious injuries. This stint got the young Matej transferred to a psychiatric clinic in Košice, where he spent more than a month. After that, he was treated at the Children's Psychiatric Hospital in Hraničné, where intellectual tests showed that he had an above- average IQ of 116. ===Adulthood=== After completing elementary school, Čurko successfully completed a vocational school with a GCSE before being drafted into the army as a technical specialist, which he also finished without any issues. After returning from the army, Matej sought employment in the technical industry, and also gained interest in two new hobbies: firearms and martial arts. Eventually, he gained employment as the head of the IT department of an unnamed insurance company. Most peculiarly, he devoted a lot of his time to filing criminal complaints to the Public Prosecutor's Office, which concerned matters ranging from parking issues to high-grade politics. What struck people as odd concerning Čurko was that he never showed interest in the opposite sex, only finding a partner at age 30, with whom he had two children. Psychiatrists and psychologists later proposed that he showed numerous signs of psychopathy (dislike towards social contact, preference for solitude, emotional coldness, weak empathy, inability to express his feelings and conflict with authority), and likely suffered from necrophilic sadism and a schizoid personality disorder. ==Modus Operandi and proven murders== At the time of the murders, Čurko lived in Sokoľ, and regularly traveled to the Kysak forest, where he would meet and subsequently kill the victims. He met them through cannibal forums, using the handle \\"kanibm\\". The victims, most of whom had suicidal tendencies and openly professed their desire to end their lives, voluntarily agreed to be killed and eaten by the cannibal. The procedure involved the pair meeting in the forest, where Čurko would drug the victim before stabbing them in the heart. Afterwards, he would cut up the body using a meat cleaver or one of his many knives, and mask the odor of rotten flesh using pepper. Then, at his pleasure, he would eat whatever part of the body he desired, storing the rest in his refrigerator in Kysak and burying the bodies in shallow graves on his property. During the search of his property, only two bodies were discovered: those of 30-year-old Elena Gudjakova, from Oravské Veselé, who went missing on June 23, 2010; and the other of 20-year-old Lucia Uchnárová, from Snina, who went missing on September 3, 2010. Both women had issues with mental health, with Lucia previously attempting suicide in 2008, and both had contacted Čurko through the Internet. Their bodies were later found in shallow graves on Čurko's property. ==Discovery and death== In the spring of 2011, a young Swiss man by the name of Markus Dubach, who had contemplated suicide due to work problems, posted an ad on the cannibal site where he asked for somebody to kill and eat him. Originally intended as a joke, he was surprisingly contacted by Čurko, who made an offer to do the job. Overtaken by curiosity, Dubach kept in contact with his anonymous would-be killer, even sending him pictures of his legs and buttocks to show his athletic build. Much to Markus' shock, Matej actually sent him pictures showcasing female body parts, as well as human meat being cooked in a pan. After this, he decided to contact the Swiss authorities, who did not believe him at first, but quickly changed their mind after seeing the messages between the two. The case was transferred over to their Slovak colleagues, and a special agent was quickly assigned to take Dubach's place in their meeting. Special armed forces were stationed around the meeting area, including a professional sniper, as information obtained by police suggested that the man was armed and very dangerous. Not long after, a man approached the agent. As he had a very casual appearance, he was mistaken for a tourist at first, but the man revealed himself to be the actual cannibal. At that moment, Čurko was ordered to stand down, but instead grabbed a gun from his belt and opened fire upon the agent, hitting him in the chest area. Matej himself was also hit, his wound proving fatal after falling into a coma. ==Investigation== While examining his backpack, the police discovered a wide variety of intriguing items which could be used to kill a person: three bottles of vodka, a folding knife, packs of black pepper (presumably to mask the smell), plastic bags, linen, latex gloves, plastic handcuffs, a large knife and a handsaw. Not long after, Čurko's house was searched, where they found several legally-owned weapons, a large number of cartridges, several mobile phones and his computer. An examination of the computer revealed GPS location of two bodies, and an arranged meeting with a 22-year-old man from the Czech Republic. The body locations were later found, with the corpses lacking their heads, legs, breasts and parts of their muscles. They were later identified as Gudjakova and Uchnárová. A ceremonial altar was also found in the woods, where it is supposed that Čurko cooked and ate body parts. It is unclear if it had any ritualistic purpose, and it was later destroyed by authorities in order to avoid it becoming a sacred site for \\"sickos\\". ==Other victims== Investigators from Italy managed to connect the profiles of 28 women with Čurko's victim type: age 25–28, suicidal and willingness to be killed and cannibalized. All of them disappeared between January 2009 and May 2011, while he was still active. This is supported by the emails shared between Dubach and Čurko, where a possible victim of Italian nationality was mentioned, and the fact that there were body parts found in his refrigerator which did not match those of Gudjakova or Uchnárová. Authorities followed up leads on the Internet, but due to a law in Slovakia, any information stored prior to 2009 is no longer available. ==References== Category:1968 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Male serial killers Category:Slovak serial killers Category:Cannibals Category:21st-century criminals Category:2009 murders in Europe Category:2011 murders in Europe Category:2000s murders in Slovakia Category:2010s murders in Slovakia Category:Deaths by firearm in Slovakia ","title":"Matej Čurko"},{"id":"61708584","text":"opened in Esashi, Hokkaidō, Japan in 1999.

It is six amino acids long, and is produced when a phage infects a bacterial host. It signals to other phages that a host has been infected. ==Discovery== Arbitrium was first observed by a team led by Rotem Sorek, a microbial geneticist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. They were studying communication in Bacillus subtilis bacteria - in particular, how bacteria infected with phages warn nearby uninfected bacteria about the presence of these viruses. They found that the phages (strain phi3T) communicated with each other to co-ordinate their infection. ==Mechanism== Many phages, known as temperate phages, when they infect a bacterium, may enter either the lytic or the lysogenic pathway. The lytic pathway causes the host to produce and release a large number of daughter phages, usually killing it in the process. The lysogenic pathway involves the virus inserting its genome into the bacterium's. At a later stage, the viral genome is activated, and it continues along the lytic pathway of producing several daughter phages. Arbitrium is used by at least some phages to decide how common fresh hosts are. Each infection causes the production of some arbitrium, and the remaining phages gauge the concentration of arbitrium around them. If the arbitrium concentration is too high, it may indicate that uninfected hosts are running out. The viruses then switch from lysis to lysogeny, so as to not deplete all available hosts. According to a team led by Alberto Marina at the Biomedical Institute of Valencia in Spain, also studying the Bacillus subtilis/ SPbeta phage system, arbitrium (AimP) binds to the AimX transcription factor AimR, and suppresses the activity of AimX, a negative regulator of lysogeny. Dou C, Xiong J, Gu Y, Yin K, Wang J, Hu Y, Zhou D, Fu X, Qi S, Zhu X, Yao S. Structural and functional insights into the regulation of the lysis–lysogeny decision in viral communities. Nature microbiology. 2018 Nov;3(11):1285. Marina has also shown in the same system that the virus's arbitrium receptor interacts not only with bacterial genes that help it reproduce, but also with several other stretches of DNA. He has suggested that arbitrium signals may be able to alter the activity of important bacterial genes. More recently, another team at the Sorek lab, headed by Avigail Stokar-Avihail and Nitzan Tal, has shown similar systems in other species of Bacilllus bacteria, the pathogenic species Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus thuringiensis. Stokar-Avihail A, Tal N, Erez Z, Lopatina A, Sorek R. Widespread Utilization of Peptide Communication in Phages Infecting Soil and Pathogenic Bacteria. Cell host & microbe. 2019 May 8;25(5):746-55. They speculate that \\"the occurrence of peptide-based communication systems among phages more broadly remains to be explored.\\" ==Applications== Sorek has suggested that since human viruses like HIV and herpes can cause active and latent infections, they might be using an arbitrium-like system to communicate. In this case, that analogue could be used to suppress infections by making the viruses completely latent. Prof. Martha Clokie, of the University of Leicester, has hailed the discovery of viral communication as 'transformative'. ==See also== * Quorum sensing - the corresponding phenomenon in bacteria ==References== Category:Viral proteins ","title":"Arbitrium"},{"id":"61708622","text":"František Zeman (born 10 October 1950) is a Czech skier.

It was their last studio album for 32 years until 2019's Psychedelic Country Soul. The album yielded two singles, a cover of NRBQ’s \\"I Want You Bad\\" and \\"Gunslinger Man\\". On Two-Fisted Tales, the Long Ryders moved further away from their country rock origins towards a more college rock direction. == Background == The recording sessions for Two- Fisted Tales took place in November and December 1986 at A&M; Studios and Eldorado Studios in Hollywood, California, and were produced by Ed Stasium (known for his work with the Ramones, Talking Heads, Motörhead, the Smithereens and Living Colour).Ed Stasium Biography. edstasium.com. Retrieved September 6, 2019. Guitarist Sid Griffin said of working with Ed Stasium, \\"He crafted a radio-friendly record that did not sacrifice our Americana/alt- country principles one iota. Ed drilled us and rehearsed us like the U.S. Marine Corps, even down to deciding kick drum patterns. It was terribly exciting.\\" The album features guest appearances by David Hidalgo of Los Lobos and Debbi and Vicki Peterson of the Bangles. Head of Island Records, Chris Blackwell, gave the band almost complete artistic freedom. \\"He just told us to give him two songs that AOR could play and we could live out our Hank Williams fantasies for the rest\\", Griffin said. The band's cover of NRBQ’s \\"I Want You Bad\\" was released as the album's first single. \\"Our label wanted a cover to help break us,\\" drummer Greg Sowders explained, \\"and we picked an obscure one\\". The single's B-side, \\"Ring Bells\\" – recorded but not finished at the Two-Fisted Tales sessions – was completed during mixing sessions in February 1987 at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas. The finished album was delivered to Island in March but the release was delayed for two months. \\"Tom Waits was selling better than Island expected, U2 were still shifting units, and so we were told to wait\\", Griffin said. In the two years since the Long Ryders signed with Island, several key employees had left the label's A&R; department, and the new team, according to Griffin, showed little interest in the band and the release of Two-Fisted Tales. Griffin: \\"The guy at Island that signed us ... they let him go. So, our defender at the record label was gone\\". When the band's rough album cover mockup was accidentally printed and went out as the final cover, they saw it as further proof of their label's indifference. Griffin: \\"No cleaning it up, no equalising the borders, no attempt to make our broad idea into something focused.\\" The album was finally released in June 1987 and despite \\"I Want You Bad\\" getting radio airplay, neither single nor album charted. By the end of the year, after the departures of bassist Tom Stevens and guitarist Stephen McCarthy, the Long Ryders had disbanded. According to Griffin, Two-Fisted Tales contains more Long Ryders songs that were covered by other acts than any other of their albums. == Musical style and reception == AllMusic described the album's sound as \\"a unique blending of McGuinn-esque guitar figures\\" with country-rock and traditional roots rock. They wrote that the Long Ryders' instrumentation, which includes mandolin, autoharp, lap steel and accordion, \\"reflects their allegiance to traditional Americana music.\\" In their artist biography, AllMusic wrote that the album blends \\"the upbeat jangle\\" of bands like R.E.M. with the Long Ryders' love of \\"classic twangy sounds.\\" Shindig! wrote that Two-Fisted Tales \\"ramps up the rock quotient somewhat and is musically a far harder-edged album\\" than the band's previous releases. The Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"The title of the album reflects why it's a lot better than the L.A. quartet’s 1985 major-label debut, State of Our Union. Whereas last time the band was making proclamations about the resurgence of American rock, this time it just wants to get tough. And that's just what it does with a variety of guitar-rock styles ranging from the rollicking riffing of \\"Gunslinger Man\\" to the moody, Byrds-like delicacy of \\"Baby's in Toyland\\" ... Ed Stasium's power- packed production gives the band's sound more dimension than it's had before, especially Greg Sowders’ strong drumming.\\" Record Collector noted the band's \\"social conscience\\" on \\"Harriet Tubman's Gonna Carry Me Home\\", and its political side on the anti-Ronald Reagan \\"Gunslinger Man\\" and anti-war \\"A Stitch in Time\\".\\" Louder Than War felt that the album has a good balance, \\"seamlessly blending hard-driving country rockers like \\"Gunslinger Man\\" with slow-burning numbers like ... epic ballad \\"Harriet Tubman's Gonna Carry Me Home\\" and melodic love songs such as \\"I Want You Bad\\".\\" Mojo thought the music ranks as some of the band's finest and Trouser Press called it \\"an enjoyable album nicely produced in a variety of appealing styles\\". Americana UK wrote, \\"Any subsequent lack of sales is clearly not the fault of the album itself\\". God is in the TV wrote that the album at times shows \\"flashes of visionary creativity\\" but that \\"all too often it's difficult to pin down any definite musical direction.\\" They felt that the album settles into a \\"safe radio- friendly sound\\" and that it isn't \\"coherent or cogent enough to be considered a stone cold classic.\\" ==Track listing== Adapted from the album's liner notes.Two Fisted Tales 2018 expanded edition on Discogs.

It was released in 1978. ==Background== The album omits some of Mozart's recitative, and also cuts two numbers in their entirety: No. 7, the duettino \\"Al fato dan legge\\" for Ferrando and Guglielmo, and No. 24, the aria \\"Ah lo veggio\\" for Ferrando.Stereo Review, August 1978, pp. 132-133 ==Recording== The album was recorded using analogue technology in May 1977 in the Palais de la Musique et des Congrès, Strasbourg.Mozart, W. A.: Così fan tutte, cond. Alain Lombard, Erato CD 2292-45683-2, 1991 ==Cover art== The cover of the first CD version of the album, designed by Mister Brown, features a detail of J. Pillement's painting \\"Les jardins de Benfica\\" (1785), a work in the collection of the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris. ==Critical reception== Mozart painted by Joseph Lange in 1790 The musicologist Stanley Sadie reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in May 1978. Comparing it with rival recordings conducted by Herbert von Karajan and Karl Böhm, he acknowledged that these classic readings offered singing of a \\"subtlety and poise\\" that Alain Lombard's version could not equal. On the other hand, the new album's students at Don Alfonso's school for lovers came to their classroom with \\"youthful timbre[s] and natural high spirits\\" that were nicely appropriate to their roles. As Fiordiligi, Kiri Te Kanawa was \\"magnificent\\", singing \\"in her best, creamiest voice\\". Aristocratic in \\"Come scoglio\\" and meditatively introspective in \\"Per pietà\\", she infused her role with tenderness and feminity. Her only fault was that she sometimes sang slightly flat. Frederica von Stade's Dorabella was \\"hardly less distinguished, with ample, broad phrasing, much well shaped detail in 'Smanie implacibili' and a graceful and spirited account of 'E' amore un ladroncello'.\\" David Rendall, although sharing Te Kanawa's tendency to sing below the note, offered a Ferrando with the requisite honey for \\"Un' aura amorosa\\" and the requisite fire for \\"Tradito, schernito\\". Philippe Huttenlocher gave a \\"very polished performance\\" as Guglielmo, acting the part convincingly, using his words intelligently and bringing a laudable legato to \\"Non siate ritrosi\\". Jules Bastin's Alfonso was sung forcefully but without much expressiveness, a charge that could not be levelled at Teresa Stratas. Her Despina was vivid and extremely musical, but it was \\"a pity that she felt the need to squeak and squawk so grotesquely in her impersonations of a doctor and a notary\\". The chief failings of the album, though, had nothing to do with any of its soloists. The orchestral playing suffered from \\"a lack of finesse\\", and the conducting from a dearth of dramatic conviction and \\"a general lack of sparkle\\". Sadie did not take exception to Lombard's bias towards slow tempi, but he was disappointed that the album evinced no care over appoggiaturas. (A further instance of negligence was the clipping of bar 49 of \\"Come scoglio\\" by a clumsy editor.) Overall, the album was a good one, but not good enough to compete with the best of its many illustrious predecessors,Gramophone, May 1978, pp. 1929-1930 An unattributed portrait of Lorenzo da Ponte in the library of Columbia University J. B. Steane reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in July 1978. He was sad that it was one of those opera recordings in which excellence was betrayed by the mediocrity surrounding it. The excellence in question was provided by the two ladies from Ferrara. Kiri Te Kanawa sang Fiordiligi with an acute sensitivity to her music's meaning, her voice \\"at its most beautiful, warm and well-rounded\\". As Dorabella, Frederica von Stade was Te Kanawa's perfect foil, her timbre complementing the soprano's so well that their voices blended in their duets in a way that could hardly be bettered. But Teresa Stratas, although a vivid Despina, sang with a tone that gave little pleasure. As Guglielmo, Philippe Huttenlocher was \\"inelegant\\". As Ferrando, David Rendall sang with a piano tone that lacked focus and a forte that sounded muffled. And worst of all, Alain Lombard seemed unable to distinguish between passages where a slow tempo was heavenly and others where it was laughable. \\"Instead of placing the partnership of Te Kanawa and von Stade in the place where it belongs, classic in freshness, beauty and character\\", the album's flaws had in Steane's view consigned it to the margins of the Così fan tutte discography. \\"You do not wear a diamond in a leaden ring.\\"Gramophone, July 1978, p. 167 Vienna's Burgtheater, where Così fan tutte was first performed George Jellinek reviewed the album on LP in Stereo Review in August 1978. Like Sadie and Steane, he singled out Kiri Te Kanawa for especial praise, lauding her \\"abundant musicality and tone of creamy richness throughout most of the range\\". However, he thought that the cruel vocal assault course that Mozart had created for Fiordiligi had been difficult for her to negotiate. Frederica von Stade sang just as beautifully, and it was not her fault if her timbre was too like Te Kanawa's to allow an ideal degree of contrast between them. Teresa Stratas was an older Despina than some, and she took the comedy of her notary too far, but the gaiety of her approach was mostly enjoyable. The album's gentlemen were not quite as impressive as its ladies. As Ferrando, David Rendall had an \\"agreeable and malleable light tenor\\" but his technique sometimes left something to be desired. Philippe Huttenlocher was a solid but bland Guglielmo. Jules Bastin sang stylishly, but without either the force or the comfortable upper notes that an Alfonso needed. Recitatives were hampered by some pedestrian harpsichord continuo work. The orchestra, if not the most sumptuous of ensembles, played with warmth and accuracy and was blessed with some first-rate woodwinds. Alain Lombard's conducting was animated and accommodating, although it was marred by an unfortunate bias towards slow tempi. The album's audio quality, if \\"not particularly spacious\\", was perfectly acceptable. All things considered, though, Lombard's Così fan tutte could not really compete with alternative recordings conducted by Karl Böhm, Erich Leinsdorf or Georg Solti.

The new facility, which was designed by Stefan von Haschenperg as a medieval fortress, was completed in 1541. It ceased to be a fortress and became a prison in 1611. The Eastern Tower was modified to designs by Thomas Telford and Sir Robert Smirke and converted for use as a Nisi Prius Court (i.e. civil courts) in 1812. The Western Tower was completely rebuilt to designs by Thomas Telford and Sir Robert Smirke and converted for use as the Crown Court in 1822. The citadel continued to be used as the local facility for dispensing justice but, following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, it also became the offices and meeting place for Cumberland County Council. After amalgamation with Westmorland County Council in 1974, Cumbria County Council continued to use the facilities at the Citadel as offices. The County Council also occupied a series of Victorian houses on Portland Square, Brunswick Street and Alfred Street North in Carlisle as well as Lonsdale House in Lower Gaol Yard. The citadel ceased to function as a judicial facility after the new Crown and County Courts Complex in Earl Street was completed in 1992. It also ceased to function as a municipal facility when, as a cost-saving measure, the County Council moved to a single facility, Cumbria House, in Botchergate in December 2016. The county council submitted proposals to the Government for funding to redevelop the Citadel area in April 2016 and published a plan to convert it into a campus for the University of Cumbria in May 2020. ==References== Category:Grade I listed buildings in Cumbria Category:Buildings and structures in Carlisle, Cumbria Category:Defunct prisons in England Category:County halls in England Category:Government buildings completed in 1541 ","title":"Carlisle Citadel"},{"id":"61708944","text":"Sonja Branting-Westerståhl (15 September 1890 - 18 July 1981) was a Swedish lawyer and politician. She was one of the first female lawyers in Sweden and specialised in matrimonial law. A social democrat, she was active in raising awareness of the rise of far-right politics in 1930s and 1940s. In 1948, she served in the lower house of the Riksdag, the Swedish Parliament, for a short period. ==Early life== Sonja Branting was born on 15 September 1890, the second child of Hjalmar Branting and Anna Branting (née Jäderin). Her father was leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Party and thrice Prime Minister of Sweden, while her mother was a journalist and writer. She attended the Palmgren school until 1909 and subsequently studied law, graduating in 1916. It was while studying law that she met her husband who was also studying the same subject. ==Career== After initially working for the Stockholm city legal aid office, Branting-Westerståhl started a practice with her husband in 1927. She developed a specialism in matrimonial disputes and, in 1930, was appointed an advokat by the city. Alongside her legal career, Branting-Westerståhl also followed in her parents' footsteps and was politically active, particularly around women's issues. She was a long-standing member of the Swedish Social Democratic Party which had been co-founded by her father and, between 1936 and 1952, served as a member of the executive board of the Social Democrat Women's Organisation. During the 1930s, Branting-Westerståhl was very active in raising awareness of the risk of nazism, including touring the United States in 1935 to speak out about the threat of totalitarianism and campaigning against the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. She also campaigned on behalf of those suffering during the Spanish Civil War and inspected refugee camps in France and Africa as international delegate. After the war, she continued to be politically active and briefly sat in the Andra kammaren for the Social Democrats in 1948. ==Selected works== *Branting-Westerståhl, Sonja. (1936) Kvinnor!

With her sister, she founded schools, translated textbooks, and edited a Chinese-language newspaper. ==Early life and education== Beulah Woolston was born near Vincentown, New Jersey, on August 3, 1828. She was raised in a Christian home, and was converted and united with the church when about fifteen years old. After receiving preliminary education in her native place, she went with Miss Sarah H. Woolston, her sister and her life associate in home and work, to the Wesleyan Female College, at Wilmington, Delaware, where she was graduated with honor from both English and classical departments. ==Career== She afterward taught for some years in the college, before responding to the call for missionary teachers in the China Mission. The sisters sailed for China, along with Phebe Potter (who soon married Erastus Wentworth), October 4, 1858. After a voyage of 147 days around the Cape of Good Hope, they landed at Shanghai, February 27, 1859, and reached Fuzhou, March 19. Their special work was to organize and superintend a boarding school for Chinese girls under the auspices of the China Female Missionary Society of Baltimore. The sisters were sent out by the parent board, American Methodist Episcopal Mission, but their school was supported by the Ladies’ China Missionary Society of Baltimore (founded in 1848). In 1859, they founded a training school for teachers in Fuzhou. Known as \\"Uk Ing\\", it was a girls’ boarding school. They overcome the natural prejudices of the people, emphasized by the wrongs done them by foreign traders, and the lack of books, maps, charts for a well-established school. When Bishop John Burdon, of the Church of England, visited the school, he declared it to be the best- conducted girls' school in China. The sisters' aim was to teach the girls such instruction as would make them useful in their own homes and in the spheres they must occupy in life, feeling that they could not conscientiously give time to teach anything that could be of no possible use to them in the future. In addition to the care of this school, hundreds of women visited them at their home. Every effort was made to utilize their visits for teaching. In addition to caring for the schools, the sisters provided many of the girls with clothing, teaching them to make their own, to cook, wash, and other details for the education of good housewives. Even vacation days were busy, as they had to provide homes for many of the girls during the time. They also established a number of day schools at different and often distant points in their work, which they visited regularly, and often at great inconvenience and exposure to themselves. With all of this work, they found time for literary work such as preparation and translation of schoolbooks, as well as the editing of the Child's Illustrated Paper in Chinese. During their twenty-five years' service they returned to the United States twice for rest and to recruit. In 1871, when the Ladies’ China Society became a part of the Methodist Episcopal Woman's Foreign Missionary Society, the Woolston sisters became its first missionaries. ==Later life== In December, 1883, both sisters were ill, and returned to the U.S. for the last time. At times, Beulah seemed to improve. On October 24, 1886, she grew much worse, and died, at Mount Holly, New Jersey. ==Selected works== * 1877, “Feet Binding” ==References== ===Attribution=== * ===Bibliography=== * Category:1828 births Category:1886 deaths Category:People from Southampton Township, New Jersey Category:American Christian missionaries Category:Methodist missionaries in China Category:American translators Category:Women newspaper editors Category:19th- century American women writers Category:Educators from New Jersey ","title":"Beulah Woolston"},{"id":"61708974","text":"Lieutenant-General Sir Herbert Campbell Holman (3 May 1869 − 25 July 1949) was a British officer of the Indian Army who served mostly in staff appointments.

The overhangs also provide shade and reduce solar gain, while slabs of each floor protrude around their entire circumference by a minimum of , easing construction and maintenance of the facades.

She was accused of practising witchcraft and fornicating with the devil but died in prison before sentence could be passed. Her grave is the only known one in Scotland of an accused witch – most were burned. == Biography == Lilias Adie's first name also appears as Lilly, and her last name was also recorded as Addie and Eddie. In 1704, Adie was held in prison for the crime of practising witchcraft.\\"Face of 18th century 'witch who had sex with the Devil' digitally reconstructed after she died in jail; Lilias Adie died in 1704 before she could be burned for her alleged crimes.\\" Daily Mirror [London, England], 31 October 2017. Gale General OneFile Accessed 9 September 2019. Her story is preserved in the 1704 Kirk session minutes. Illness among local residents created a brief but intense period of witch- hunting in the Fife area. A woman named Jean Bizet had accused Adie of witchcraft, proclaiming \\"beware lest Lilias Adie come upon you and your child.\\" This resulted in the arrest of Adie, who was likely upwards of 60 at the time. Adie was taken to the local minister, Rev. Allan Logan to answer to the crime of witchcraft. For over a month she was imprisoned and subjected to day after day of rough interrogation before she finally 'confessed'. == 'Confession' == Adie's 'confession' explained how the devil had been wearing a hat when he first visited her in a cornfield at sunset the first time they met. Under the minister's questioning, she described how the devil had lain with her carnally and made her renounce her baptism. She detailed his physical appearance as having \\"cold pale skin and cloven-hoofed feet like a cow\\". After that first encounter, the devil would then meet her at her house \\"like a shadow\\". Adie elaborated that she had gone to other meetings and cavorted with the devil with other witches. Despite repeated questioning Adie would not provide the names of these other witches. No commission for a witchcraft trial was ever issued and no trial was held. Lilias Adie died before her investigation was concluded. The ordeal she endured proved too much after over a month of prolonged torturous interrogations, involving sleep deprivation. == Burial site == Torryburn Bay In 2014, interest in Adie's story encouraged the historian and BBC broadcaster Dr. Louise Yeoman and Douglas Speirs, an archaeologist at Fife Council, to look for her burial site. Using 19th-century historical documents, they found a seaweed-covered slab of stone exactly where the documents described: in a group of rocks near the Torryburn railway bridge lay \\"the great stone doorstep that lies over the rifled grave of Lilly Eadie\\", and a rock with \\"the remains of an iron ring\\". Lilias Adie had been buried on the beach at Torryburn Bay, in a \\"humble\\" wooden box, under this sandstone slab between the low and high tide marks. The \\"hulking half-ton\\" stone was indicative of locals' fears that the devil might reanimate her to \\"torment the living\\". ==Missing remains== Her remains were dug up by antique-collecting grave robbers in 1852. At the time, it was reported that the coffin was 6 feet 6 inches (about 1.98 m) long. Her thighbones were found to be of comparable length with those of a man who was 6 feet (about 1.8 m) tall. She still had most of her teeth, which were \\"white and fresh\\". Exactly how much of her skeleton was removed is unknown but her skull, ribs and a femur are known to be definitely missing. The skull was in the private museum of Dunfermline antiquarian Sir Joseph Noel Paton in 1875. It was exhibited to the Fifeshire Medical Association in 1884 by a medical doctor from Dunfermline named Dow. It was eventually held at the Museum of the University of St Andrews, but has since disappeared. The skull was exhibited in 1938 at the Empire Exhibition at Bellahouston Park in Glasgow, its last known location. Adie's coffin was also a source of souvenirs: a walking stick, believed to be made from the wood of her coffin and with a silver band near the handle engraved with \\"Lilias Addie, 1704\\", was donated to the Pittencrieff House Museum in Dunfermline in 1927. == Digital reconstruction of her face == In 1904, two hundred years after her death, photographs were taken of Adie's remains which are now held at the National Library of Scotland. Using these photographs, in 2017 Dr Christopher Rynn and a team of forensic artists at the Centre for Anatomy and Human Identification (CAHID) at the University of Dundee constructed a 3D virtual model and created a digital image of what Adie's face might have looked like. == Legacy == Louise Yeoman said of Lilias Adie: Fife Council has launched a campaign to find out what happened to Adie's remains and give them a proper burial. Speirs stated \\"It's time to move the narrative away from the Halloween-style figure of the fun witch, and recognise the historic gender bias and suffering that women were exposed to in the name of witch-hunting.\\" Wooden walking sticks constructed from the pieces of the coffin have since been recovered following the campaign launch with Andrew Carnegie a notable recipient given one such walking stick. Councillor Julie Ford, leading the campaign, said: On 31 August 2019, 315 years after Adie died in custody, a memorial service was held in Torryburn and a wreath laid at the site of her grave to raise awareness of the persecution these women and men endured in Fife during the witchcraft panics. Plans have also been mooted for a permanent memorial at Torryburn, dedicated to Lilias and other women who were persecuted across Scotland. == See also == * Margaret Aitken (the Great Witch of Balwearie, Fife) == References == == External links == * View the digital image of what Lilias Adie's face may have looked like on the University of Dundee's website. * View Lilias Adie on the map of accused witches in Scotland.

The book draws on the distinctions between empathy, compassion, and moral decision making. Bloom argues that empathy is not the solution to problems that divide people and is a poor guide for decision making. However, he is not completely against empathy; he believes that empathy can motivate kindness to make the world a better place. Overall, the book received mixed reviews as some reviewers critiqued Bloom's case \\"against empathy,\\" maintaining their belief that empathy is a useful tool. == Definition of Empathy == Paul Bloom defines empathy the way that Adam Smith describes sympathy in Theory of Moral Sentiments. Bloom describes empathy as \\"a spotlight directing attention and aid to where it's needed\\". It is an emotion that people mistake as a moral guide for their decision making, and Bloom suggests it can blind morality. He explains that empathy is limiting because it directs people's attentions to individuals or individual events, which can misguide certain acts of kindness. Therefore, he suggests, empathy be thought of as \\"rational compassion,\\" or in his words \\"conscious, deliberative reasoning in everyday life\\". == Powers and Limitations of Empathy == In the book, Bloom develops his case for \\"rational compassion\\" by discussing acts of kindness and altruism. Bloom believes that people \\"can make decisions based on considerations of cost and benefits\\". He analyzes why and how people act altruistically and explains that oftentimes, empathy motivates people to act for self-serving reasons. Bloom also explores the neurological differences between feeling and understanding, which are central to demonstrating the limitations of empathy. He describes understanding the same way as Buddhist moral philosopher, Charles Goodman, defines compassion in the book Consequences of Compassion: An Interpretation and Defense of Buddhist Ethics. With this understanding, Bloom describes empathy as feeling what others feel whereas compassion is understanding what others feel. == Empathy vs. Compassion == Bloom also explains C. Daniel Batson's study on \\"empathy- altruism hypothesis\\" which highlights empathy's biases.This hypothesis argues that people do acts of kindness due to empathy, but those acts may result in unintended consequences. Part of this is because people's moral evaluations of the people and events around them are what determine whether one feels empathy towards them. For example, \\"you feel more empathy for someone who is cooperating And it's the feeling of empathy that may influence people to do acts of kindness, or according to Bloom, acts of destruction. On the flip- side, low empathy can merit bad behavior. To further his argument, Bloom describes effective altruism and its relationship with cost-benefit analysis decision making. He explains that rationalizing acts of kindness is a more effective guide for moral decisions than empathy. However, according to Bloom and a number of psychologists, people still make decisions using empathy without using rationality. == Rational Decision Making == Bloom finalizes the book by explaining how empathy is related to anger and evil. He explains how violence and anger can be products of empathy and that these things lead to evil. Evil, according to Bloom, is caused by dehumanization and objectification which are caused by empathy. In the same vein, Bloom explains that sometimes people commit evil acts in support of their morality, which can be blinded by empathy. The last chapter discusses concepts also touched in Daniel Kahneman's book, Thinking, Fast and Slow that suggest people make a series of rational and irrational decisions. He criticizes the argument that \\"regardless of reason's virtues, we just aren't any good at it\\". His point is that people are not as \\"stupid as scholars think they are\\". He explains that people are rational because they make thoughtful decisions in their everyday lives. For example, when someone has to make a big life decision they critically assess the outcomes, consequences, and alternative options. Ultimately, Bloom argues for a utilitarian approach to acts of altruism instead of empathy. == Reception == This book received mixed reviews. The New York Times questioned whether people should disregard empathy, because \\"maybe empathy still has a place to stave [envy] off…? [They] wish he’d said.\\" The Guardian agreed with Bloom's case for rational compassion on the basis that that rational compassion was more valuable than empathy. == See also== * Identifiable victim effect == References == Category:2016 non-fiction books Category:HarperCollins books Category:Books about emotions Category:Moral psychology books ","title":"Against Empathy"},{"id":"61709134","text":"George Austin Morrison (November 30, 1832 – February 26, 1916) was a Scottish- American merchant, banker and industrialist. ==Early life== Morrison was born on November 30, 1832 at Mondynes in the parish of Fordoun, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. He was a son of Alexander Morrison and Christian (née Lyall) Morrison, a relative of the Lyalls, Austins and Burns, all \\"old and well- established Aberdeenshire families\\". Morrison first attended the parish school at Fourdon, then Aberdeen Grammar School, before being sent to reside with his maternal uncle, George Lyall, at age sixteen. Lyall was a general merchant in Aberdeen with a branch of his business at Montego Bay in Jamaica. ==Career== After learning the merchant business in the house of his uncle, he left his uncles home, 99 Union Street, Aberdeen, and went to London in 1852 and joined George Moore's firm, Groucock, Copestake, Moore & Co., one of the leading mercantile houses, which was located in Bow Yard, London. Morrison stayed with the firm until 1856 when he moved to New York City to become the head of the one of the departments in Cochran & Company, a wholesale dry gods house, led by Thomas Cochrane. In New York, he was the European buyer for the firm, crossing the Atlantic Ocean twice a year (over 110 times), and was admitted as a partner in 1865. In 1869, when the firm was reorganized as Cochrane, McLean & Co., he left and started his own firm with John Herriman, known as Morrison, Herriman & Co. George was involved in the new house, which was a wholesale dry goods business including lace, linen and white goods, for twenty years until it was dissolved in 1889. After his retirement from the merchant business, he became involved with the banking, industrial and railroad businesses. He served as a director of the Third National Bank and the Northern Pacific Railroad. In 1895, he became president, and later chairman of the board of directors, of The American Cotton Oil Company (a predecessor company to Bestfoods, now part of Unilever), which was one of the original 12 industrials comprising the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1896. He retired from the company in 1911 but remained a member of the Executive Committee in an advisory capacity until his death in 1916. After his death, Clarence M. Woolley, president of the American Radiator Co., was elected to succeed Morrison as a director of the American Cotton Oil Co. ===Social and club life=== Morrison's second son, Charles King Morrison Morrison was a life member of the New-York Historical Society and the American Hackney Horse Society, a fellow of the National Academy of Design, a member of the New York Chamber of Commerce, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the American Museum of Natural History, the New York Botanical Gardens, the Holland Lodge of the State of New York, the St. George's Society, the Century Association, the Metropolitan Club, the Lawyers' Club and the New York Yacht Club. In November 1864, he was elected a member of the Saint Andrew's Society of the State of New York, becoming a life member in 1881. From 1884 to 1889, he was a manager, from 1889 to 1893, he served as first vice-president, and from 1893 to 1895, as president of the society. ==Personal life== On May 26, 1863, he married Lucy Anne King (1844–1891). Lucy, who was born in New Lebanon, New York, was the daughter of Eseck Clarke King and Sarah Coe (née McCullen) King. Together, they lived at 10 East 54th Street and were the parents of: * George Austin Morrison Jr. (1864–1916), a Harvard and Columbia graduate who married Magdalen S. Worden. * Charles King Morrison (1867–1920), also a Harvard and Columbia graduate who married Mildred Horsten Hoag, daughter of Dr. William E. Hoag. His wife died in 1891 and Morrison died at The Kenilworth, his residence in New York City, on February 26, 1916 and his funeral was held at his then residence, 151 Central Park West. His eldest son, and namesake, died shortly thereafter on November 29, 1916. Neither of his sons left children, therefore the Morrison name in this branch of the family became extinct upon his second son's death in 1920. ==References== Category:1832 births Category:1916 deaths Category:Scottish emigrants to the United States Category:American merchants Category:American bankers Category:Presidents of the Saint Andrew's Society of the State of New York Category:People from Aberdeenshire ","title":"George Austin Morrison"},{"id":"61709144","text":"Pain. Joy. Ecstasy. Despair is the first full-length studio album by English metalcore band SHVPES. It was released on 14 October 2016 through Spinefarm Records/Search And Destroy Records and it was produced by Jim Pinder and Carl Brown. == Background == In 2014, Ryan Hamilton, Youssef Ashraf, Oliver Pike and Harry Jennings were in a band called Cytota. Vocalist Joby Fitzgerald had just left the group and, in October, Griffin Dickinson joined them. At the beginning of 2015, they changed their name to SHVPES and released a track called \\"SHAPES\\". At the same time, they started working on more music with producers Jim Pinder and Carl Brown, who had previously worked with bands like Trivium, Machine Head and While She Sleeps. Dickinson explained: \\"Working with them was an absolute eye opener. For a load of amateur musicians such as ourselves, to go in and just learn about songwriting was great.\\" The recordings were completed in spring 2016. Shortly after, bassist Oliver Pike left the band and was then replaced by Grant Leo Knight. Dickinson also detailed the themes of the album: \\"As a concept, this album is about finding the beauty in whatever situation you’re in. Your ability to feel pain/to feel despair is ultimately what allows you to embrace the feeling of joy or ecstasy. It’s like yin & yang. ‘Pain. Joy. Ecstasy. Despair’ gave me a platform to expel 24 years’ worth of frustration and turn it into something positive; something I can be proud of and something, I hope, the listener can find solace in.\\" == Release and promotion == On 21 May 2015, they released the single \\"State Of Mine\\", along with a video directed by Storm + Shelter that \\"depicts an individual banned from the online world due to antisocial behaviour\\". On 16 May 2016, they revealed a second single \\"God Warrior\\". According to Dickinson, \\"this song’s about the stupidity in following something that’s quite obviously evil.” On 14 June 2016, \\"False Teeth\\" was released. On 25 July 2016, they premiered \\"Two Minutes Of Hate\\". The song was inspired by George Orwell's novel \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\". On 6 October 2016, \\"Skin And Bones\\" was released, along with a music video, representing \\"someone who feels like an alien in their surroundings, alone & encircled by people who take them as some sort of gimmick, but they do their own thing regardless\\". On 30 January 2017, they released the title track \\"Pain. Joy. Ecstasy. Despair\\", accompanied by a video directed by Video Ink. == Critical reception == The album has been defined an impressive success, with critics highlighting the influence of nu metal and alternative metal. Griffin's vocals have been compared to Rage Against the Machine's Zach de la Rocha. Considered \\"bold and dynamic, packed with thunderous drum work and gritty riffs that you can really sink your teeth into\\", Pain. Joy. Ecstasy. Despair has been appreciated as debut effort of a young band with still much to offer. At the same time, it has been noted that the band need to solidify their sound and to narrow their focus, because \\"that special something, the magic ingredient that makes a really great record\\" seems somehow missing. == Track listing == == Personnel == * Griffin Dickinson - lead vocals * Ryan Hamilton - lead guitar, backing vocals * Youssef Ashraf - rhythm guitar, backing vocals * Oliver Pike - bass * Harry Jennings - drums == References == Category:2016 debut albums Category:SHVPES albums Category:Spinefarm Records albums ","title":"Pain.

In connection with the ongoing military reform of the Armed Forces of Russia, military construction and the improvement of formations, it was evidently necessary to increase the number of initial people in the main unit of the Russian Armed Forces of that time – the regiment, and therefore it was decided to introduce new ranks. According to the charter of the Russian Imperial Army, 1716, the responsibilities of the major were divided between two new ranks in the regiment, so the prime major and second major appeared, that is, the first and second senior in the regiment. The prime major was an assistant to the regiment commander, colonel, and the second major was an assistant to the deputy commander of the regiment, lieutenant colonel (another source indicates that he was the closest assistant to the prime major and commanded the 2nd battalion), but the Small Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary states that second major existed before the establishment of the rank of lieutenant colonel, in return for the rank of prime major. The second major was in charge of the drill and guard service in the regiment, and was the fourth officer in the regiment. He also carried out the actual command of the 2nd battalion of the regiment (where the chief was the lieutenant colonel), that is, he was the battalion commander. The division into prime and second majors was abolished in 1797, under Emperor Paul I. All prime and second majors became known as majors. In 1827, the majors received two stars on staff officer epaulettes as insignia. ==Personalities== *Velovsky, second major, commandant of the Rassypnaya fortress, which was located on the Orenburg line, in 1773, for their resistance to the Pugachev's rebels was chopped up by them, another source indicates that he was hanged;Velovsky // Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary: In 86 Volumes (82 Volumes and 4 Additional Volumes).

Poster It was not shortlisted. ==Overview== Location of the Aristarchus crater and Aristarchus Plateau on the Moon. Herodotus (right) from Apollo 15. ISOCHRON would address fundamental questions about the composition of the lunar crust and the time-stratigraphy of lunar volcanic processes, with implications for all of the terrestrial planets. There is a stretch of nearly 2 billion years of lunar history that planetary scientists have not been able to date because the Apollo missions did not retrieve any young rocks. Lunar mare basalts formed through partial melting of the mantle, thus serve as probes of the structure and composition of the interior. The stated scientific objective of the mission is: \\"[To] make high-precision radiometric age measurements on these relatively young basalts to fill the existing gap in age-correlated crater size-frequency distributions (CSFDs), thereby greatly improving this widely-used tool for estimating the ages of exposed surfaces on rocky bodies.\\" The proposed ISOCHRON mission concept would have a robotic lander land just south of Aristarchus Plateau and retrieve about of a basalt sample estimated to be 1.5 to 2.0 billion years old. The sample would be placed in a small container, launched to Earth, and it would be curated at NASA's Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility. The Principal Investigator is Dave Draper, at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Texas. ==Location== The sample would be obtained from the Aristarchus Plateau, located in the midst of the Oceanus Procellarum, a large expanse of lunar mare. This is a tilted crustal block, about 200 km across, that rises to a maximum elevation of 2 km above the mare in the southeastern section. ==See also== *Geology of the Moon *Internal structure of the Moon *Relative dating ==References== Category:Discovery program proposals Category:Proposed space probes Category:Missions to the Moon Category:Sample return missions ","title":"ISOCHRON (spacecraft)"},{"id":"61709391","text":"Rumex sanguineus, commonly known as bloody dock or red veined dock, is a perennial flowering plant species in the family Polygonaceae.

She set up the Aldershot Mission Institute in 1863 to cater to the town's garrison. Robinson spent much of the 1860s travelling around British Army camps and garrisons distributing bibles, holding prayer meetings and providing games and reading material to the soldiers. She established the Portsmouth Soldiers' Institute in 1874 to cater for soldiers travelling through the port. For her efforts she was nicknamed the \\"Soldier's Friend\\" and received some recognition from the government. Robinson suffered from a spinal problem that limited her mobility in later life, though she continued to travel widely to raise funds for her missions. She retired to Burley, Hampshire and wrote a number of books before her death. == Early life == Sarah Robinson was born on 1 August 1834 at Peckham, Surrey. She was the fourth child (out of six) of Rebecca and John James Robinson – who farmed a 150-acre estate near Lewes, Sussex. Sarah attended a ladies' academy in Brighton from 1844 to 1848 but was withdrawn following an illness and the death of Rebecca. As a child she was described as \\"delicate in health, reserved, sensitive and timid\\". She was, however, fascinated with the military, having played toy soldiers with her brothers and read widely on military heroes. Despite being baptised in the Grove Independent Chapel in Camberwell and her father being a strict Calvinist Robinson's faith was more fluid, affiliating to the Church of England from 1851 and to Presbyterianism from 1866. == Aldershot temperance movement == In 1858 the Robinson family moved to Guildford where Robinson worked as a Sunday school singing teacher and lecturer on the bible. She also visited the homes of the sick and poor. Robinson was inspired by reading Julia Wightman's 1860 book Haste to the Rescue, Sarah began visiting the nearby Aldershot Garrison to promote the temperance movement. She founded the Aldershot Mission Institute in 1863 with Louisa Daniell, an army officer's widow, to provide an alcohol-free place for entertaining servicemen. The Institute was initially opposed by the Royal Army Chaplains' Department (RAChD) and the Chaplain-General of the Forces George Gleig forbade one Aldershot chaplain from attending the opening event. Together with Agnes Weston, who led the movement in the navy, she was instructed by the National Temperance League to promote a series of initiatives in the armed forces and campaigned for better accommodation, entertainment and education facilities for the men. From 1865 to 1873 she travelled widely across garrisons in England, including nine weeks spent camping in Dartmoor observing units on manoeuvres where she set up two marquees selling cheap food and non-alcoholic drinks. She also distributed bibles, held prayer meetings and provided games, newspapers and books to the troops. Robinson also visited brothels with a view to improving the health of the sex workers and their clients. ==Portsmouth Institute == Robinson founded the Portsmouth Soldiers' Institute in a converted public house in 1874 to house troops and their families awaiting ships abroad or newly arrived from overseas service. Robinson's efforts here were again opposed by the RAChD which was quite high church and ritualist in this period. The town's senior chaplain particularly disagreed with Robinson's bible classes. As a result, the army chaplains were not invited to meetings at the institute and no attempt was made to encourage them to visit. The Institute was later expanded to provide accommodation for officers and additional educational and entertainment facilities despite opposition from the town (which she referred to as \\"Satan's very seat\\"). Robinson's success in the army led her to become known as the \\"Soldier's Friend\\" and helped bring about an increase in the army's concern for the welfare of the troops. She also received recognition by the government, being allowed to use army facilities and listed in a parliamentary blue book as a lecturer in military education. One of her canteens was visited by the secretary of state for war and in 1874 the Portsmouth Institute was inspected by Prince George, Duke of Cambridge – the commander-in-chief of the army. Robinson was also mentioned by Jeannie Chappell in her 1900 book Noble Work by Noble Women. Robinson herself published several works on temperance including an essay in Hatford Battersby's 1868 work Temperance Reformation, the 1876 book Christianity and Teetotalism and the autobiographical A Life Record of 1898. == Later life == In the early 1880s Robinson founded the Soldier's Institute in Alexandria, British Egypt and had also expanded the remit of the Portsmouth Institute to the general working classes. She established night schools, a coffee shop and a public laundry in the town. Robinson spent the years of 1889–1891 travelling across the UK to raise money for her institute which was in debt. Suffering from a chronic spinal problem, and long warned by doctors in England that she would soon become permanently immobile, she used a steel apparatus that lessened the weight from the spine. Also, she travelled more than 3,000 miles in a specially constructed coach; ultimately, despite these measures, she was forced to retire for health reasons to Burley, Hampshire, though she remained superintendent of the Institute. She published The Soldiers Friend: A Pioneer's Record in 1913 and her last autobiography My Book: a Personal Narrative in 1914. Robinson died at home on 26 November 1921; her wealth at probate was £1207 14s 10d and she was cremated in Woking. Robinson has been described as the \\"most widely known female reformer in the field of rescue work among soldiers\\". == References == Category:1834 births Category:1921 deaths Category:People from Peckham Category:Temperance activists Category:British women activists Category:19th-century British writers Category:19th-century British women writers Category:Converts to Anglicanism Category:Converts to Presbyterianism ","title":"Sarah Robinson (activist)"},{"id":"61709401","text":"Rumex britannica is a flowering plant species in the family Polygonaceae. britannica ","title":"Rumex britannica"},{"id":"61709406","text":"Rumex bucephalophorus, also known as horned, red, or ruby dock is an annual herbaceous plant that is part of the family Polygonaceae. The scientific name Rumex bucephalophorus was first described and published by Linnaeus in 1753 in Species Plantarum. Other scientific names have also been given to Rumex bucephalophorus such as Bucephalophora aculeata and Lapathum bucephalophorum. R. bucephalophorus is most commonly found in subcoastal or coastal regions, but also are \\"casual aliens\\", few and far between, among inland populations. Rumex bucephalophorus is native to the Mediterranean Basin and grows best in areas with little human intervention. == Description == The stems of R. bucephalophorus are thin and branch off the base of the plant about 5 to 50 centimeters long. The leaves of the plant vary as they can be circular and ovate or lengthened and lancelate anywhere in between. The pedicels are known to be heteromorphic often distinguishing this plant from others. Flowers are often found in groups of 2 to 3 in clusters and are also often heteromorphic. Like its leaves, the flowers of R. bucephalophorus often vary greatly but are generally triangular and 2–4 mm long. The Rumex bucephalophorus flowers appear red and blossom between the months of December and May. == Distribution == The genus Rumex is mostly distributed throughout North America and Europe. However, Rumex bucephalophorus flourishes in habitats that are quite sandy and rocky therefore it often is found by the sea. The Atlantic coast of southwestern Europe, the northwestern region of Macaronesia and Morocco, and the coastlands of the Mediterranean Basin are where R. bucephalophorus is most widely distributed. == Subspecies == Rumex bucephalophorus is unique as it is a polymorphic species resulting in 8 different subspecies as well as dozens of variants and subvariants. * Rumex bucephalophorus ssp. aegaeus * Rumex bucephalophorus ssp. bucephalophorus * Rumex bucephalophorus ssp. canariensis * Rumex bucephalophorus ssp. graecus * Rumex bucephalophorus ssp. fruticescens * Rumex bucephalophorus ssp. gallicus * Rumex bucephalophorus ssp. hipporegii * Rumex bucephalophorus ssp. hispanicus == Uses == R. bucephalophorus does not have any known uses, but it is an edible plant. There is a danger, however, because its leaves contain a high level of oxalic acid that can be potentially dangerous in large amounts. This oxalic acid gives the leaves an acid-lemon flavor. == References == bucephalophorus ","title":"Rumex bucephalophorus"},{"id":"61709419","text":"The Dechi Laot'i First Nations is a Tłı̨chǫ First Nations band government in the Northwest Territories.

It was reassigned from the genus Rajania to Brunnichia by Lloyd Shinners in the publication Sida in 1967. Formerly it had been placed in Rajania by Thomas Walter in Flora Caroliniana in 1778. Brunnichia ovata plants grow near riverbanks, the perimeters of lakes, wet woods and thickets. This species is found in the buckwheat family, Polygonaceae. Brunnichia ovata is referred to by two other common names including American buckwheat vine and redvine. ==Description== Brunnichia ovata is made up of an alternate leaf arrangement of its simple leaves. It is regarded as deciduous and the blades of its leaves are ovate or having an oval shape. Its leaves can range anywhere from 2 to 5 inches in length and its petioles are usually short. The flowering of the Brunnichia ovata species is typically seen from June to July and they are greenish in color. The fruit of the species is coined by its common name, “ear-drops” due to its appearance of hanging earrings. The stems shows proximal portions to be woody and the distal portions of the shoots to be herbaceous. Hence the species is regarded as a semi-woody vine. The optimum temperature found for germination of the species is 35 °C in both soil and Petri dishes. Below or above, 25 °C and 40 °C, respectively will yield no germination or emergence. Furthermore it requires altitude ranges of 0 to 200 meters and can grow up to 40 feet tall. ==Geographic distribution== Brunnichia ovata is a native vine to North America. Due to its need for wet woods and riverbanks it is typically found in Southeastern regions of North America specifically coastal plains from Texas to Alabama, as far north as southern Illinois, and eastward to Georgia. ==Uses== There are no known uses for this species.

The difference in flowering identifies the difference between the two species. However, the two species are synonymous which is why there is a difference in their common names--Prickly smartweed and Bunge's smartweed. Bunge's smartweed refers to Turczaninow's original identification in 1840 while prickly smartweed is in reference to the accepted name of the species which was identified by Nakai. ==References== bungeana ","title":"Persicaria bungeana"},{"id":"61709459","text":"Persicaria meisneriana is a flowering plant species in the family Polygonaceae. ==References== meisneriana ","title":"Persicaria meisneriana"},{"id":"61709463","text":"Rumex lapponicus, known commonly as Lapland mountain sorrel is a perennial flowering herb species in the family Polygonaceae. It is commonly found in meadows and rock outcrops, as well as montane, arenicolous, and alluvial habitats. ==Description== Rumex lapponicus is a herbaceous perennial plant with several or a single branched erect stem. Branching in the distal portion of the stem and inflorescence differentiates R. lapponicus from other species of Rumex, namely R. acetosa, of which R. lapponicus was initially mischaracterized as a subspecies. It has stems usually reaching 20-60 centimeters (8-24 inches) high, and broadly ovate, terminally sagittate leaves that are 3–10 cm long and 1–4 cm wide. It is dioecious. ==Distribution== Rumex lapponicus occurs between 0–2500 meters in elevation in montane and submontane meadow and outcrop environments throughout Canada (British Columbia, Alberta, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories), the United States (Montana, Wyoming, and Alaska), Greenland, and throughout North Eurasia. It is most successful in silty, fine soils along rivers and streams in montane and tundra zones. ==Taxonomy== Rumex lapponicus belongs to the genus Rumex, known commonly as the docks or sorrels, and is placed in the subfamily Polygonoideae within the family Polygonaceae. It is of the order Caryophyllales, or the buckwheats, and it is a Eudicot. As a result of the aggregation of morphologically distinct montane R. acetosa and R. lapponicus species from the Rocky Mountains to Beartooth Plateau under the name R. alpestris, R. lapponicus was originally thought to be a subspecies of first R. alpestris, then, following nomenclatural studies suggesting R. alpestris to be an ambiguous/polymorphic name, R. acetosa. However, R. lapponicus differs in habit and branching, and exceeds the leaf size of R. acetosa. Additionally, is more closely related to morphologically unique arctic Rumex species, R. pseudoxyria, than any other Rumex member, suggesting independent development as a species from R. acetosa. ==Uses== The Norwegian name for Rumex lapponicus, setersyre, has led to some speculation that it was used on Mid-Norwegian summer farms as an acidifying agent. The United States Department of Agriculture has listed Rumex lapponicus as a noxious weed in the state of Arkansas, indicating that members of the genus Rumex \\"can directly or indirectly injure or cause damage to crops (including nursery stock or plant products), livestock, poultry or other interests of agriculture, irrigation, navigation, the natural resources of the United States, the public health, or the environment\\", in an official profile on the USDA website, and thus subject to interstate travel restrictions within the US. ==References== lapponicus ","title":"Rumex lapponicus"},{"id":"61709465","text":"Rumex floridanus is a perennial flowering plant, in the family Polygonaceae. The common name for this species is Florida dock. ==Description== The stems are upright and the leaves have lateral veins. They are lanceolate in shape. The flowers are attached in a whorled pattern. The whorls are closer together towards the top of the plant. The flowers have tepals, as it is difficult to differentiate between the petals and sepals. Flowers are in the deltoid shape. Its fruits are brown and achenes. ==Distribution== R. floridanus is native to the Southeastern United States. It has been found in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, South Carolina, Mississippi, New Jersey, and Maryland. R. floridanus is common in marshes, swamps, and bogs. ==Taxonomy== R. floridanus was first described by Carl Daniel Friedrich Meisner in Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis in 1856.

This specific plant species experiences perennial growth and is originally found in North Carolina. Rumex fascicularis is from the genus Rumex, which are herbs and it is commonly seen growing near swamps, shores of rivers and lakes. ==Description== Rumex species are known to grow their tuberous roots in a cluster that ranges from 3-5 cm. Rumex fascicularis is closely related to Rumex verticillatus and Rumex floridanus. It is especially characterized by its taproots, with broad crenate leaves and are generally hermaphrodites. These leaves have teeth like or jagged edges. The leaves, like the roots, are clustered and are unique in shape. There is an inflorescence (petals, sepals and flower all attached at one point on the stem) and as a result of the weak stems, tends to hang over to the side. The stems of the plant are generally weak and grow up to 6 cm but are thicker at the bases. The floral arrangement of Rumex fascicularis goes up to 20 whorls, starting as low as 10. Rumex fascicularis is an angiosperm (flowering plant) whose fruit is slender and very dense. ==Distribution== Rumex fascicularis can be found growing in swampy areas or along the shores of rivers. In the swamps there is little to no water movement. A sample of this plant discovered by G.V. Nash, was found in Florida along swamps and shorelines. The soil found in the swamp areas have a high nutrient content and may be washed by salt or fresh water.

Born in Lambeth, Gordon completed an apprenticeship as a sheet metal worker with Pender & Baker, and then joined the East London Society of Tin and Iron Plate Workers. He quickly came to prominence in the union, serving on its executive, and then as the union's president. He advocated a single union of sheet metal workers, and in 1889 he persuaded both his own union, and the West London Tin Plate Workers, to affiliate to the National Amalgamated Association of Tin Plate Workers of Great Britain. As a result, in 1895, he was elected as president of this loose federation, and he also served as the part-time organiser of the federation's London district, proving highly successful at recruitment. He began touring the country to recruit to the federation's other affiliates, and so in 1901 he was made the federation's first full-time national organiser and secretary. In 1920, Gordon persuaded the federation's various affiliates to merge with the General Union of Tinplate Workers, and form the more centralised National Union of Sheet Metal Workers and Braziers. He became the union's first general secretary. However, two years later, he retired due to poor health, and he died in 1929.

His father was a prominent Glasgow merchant and banker who could trace his lineage back to Admiral Sir Andrew Wood, a hero of the British Navy. At age 7, he went to William Angus' Grammar School in St Mungo for two years, followed by the Glasgow Grammar School and Dr. Duncan's School at Ruthwell. In October 1821, he entered The Glasgow Academy until age sixteen, when he matriculated at the University of St Andrews, where he took the second and third mathematical prizes. After St Andrews, he attended the University of Glasgow where he took the highest prize in Natural Philosophy. ==Career== Shortly after his graduation, he began working in the family mercantile business J. & R. Dennistoun & Company. On November 3, 1828, he came to the United States for the firm, remaining only a short time before he returned to Scotland. In 1830, he returned to New York on Hibernia, married there, and returned to Glasgow, where he stayed until 1832 when he relocated to Liverpool to manage the branch of the business there. While in Liverpool, \\"in conjunction with Richard Cobden, he canvassed South Lancashire in the interests of the senior partner of Brown Brothers, the eminent banking house, who was about to seek the votes of that constituency for election to Parliament.\\" In 1844, Wood returned to the United States and opened Dennistoun, Wood & Co., remaining a partner until his retirement from the firm on December 31, 1860. In 1863, he assumed the management of the British and American Bank, where he worked until 1869. ===Public office=== In May 1869, Mayor A. Oakey Hall appointed Wood a Commissioner of Public Instruction and in May 1870, he was made a Commissioner of Docks and Ferries, serving through the administration of Mayor William F. Havemeyer until May 21, 1873. In June of 1870, he was appointed to the commission to expand Broadway to succeed Alexander Turney Stewart who retired. Wood served on the Board of Education until April 4, 1873 \\"when the Reform Party legislated him out of office.\\" He was reappointed by Mayor William H. Wickham as a Commissioner of Education and eventually became President of the Board, serving almost twenty years where he was instrumental in the establishment of the Normal College for the training of teachers. ===Social and club life=== Wood was a member of the Century Association and served as an elder of the Collegiate Dutch Reformed Church, although a member of the Congregational Church. In December 1828, he was elected a member of the Saint Andrew's Society of the State of New York and served as president of the society from 1865 to 1867. ==Personal life== Wood's daughter, Elizabeth Kane, .

Bundy (born 1972) of Bunkerville, Nevada, is an American cattle rancher and Independent candidate for Nevada's 2018 Gubernatorial Election. He is the brother of Ammon Bundy and the son of Cliven Bundy, who was a central figure in the 2014 Bundy standoff in Bunkerville, Nevada over his unpaid grazing fees on federally-owned public land. Ryan Bundy was noted as a participant and leader in both the 2014 Bundy standoff and the 2016 Occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. == Early life == Bundy was born in Nevada in 1972, the son of Cliven Bundy, and his first wife, Jane Marie Brown Bundy. When he was seven, a Ford LTD ran over and stalled over his head. The driver, unaware of Bundy's location, hit the gas and spun the car with Bundy's head still under the vehicle. This incident resulted in Bundy having a broken arm, a cracked skull, and a severely ripped motor nerve that left part of his face immobile. == Protests and legal trials == Bundy spoke at a 2014 protest against the Bureau of Land Management's decision to bar all- terrain vehicles from Recapture Canyon, an environmentally sensitive area of southeastern Utah. The protest drew 40-50 protesters, and the Salt Lake Tribune said Bundy shouted down one of the protest event's organizers who got cold feet about driving ATVs near protected archeological sites. === 2014 Bundy standoff in Bunkerville === For over twenty years, Bundy's father Cliven Bundy had been illegally grazing his cattle on public land near his melon farm in Mesquite, Nevada. Cliven believed that the federal government did not have the jurisdiction over the grazing rights on this public land and refused to pay his grazing fees. By 2014, he owed over $1 million in unpaid grazing fees and fines to the national government. The Bureau of Land Management attempted to collect by impounding some of Bundy's cattle and closing some of the public land that he had been using. In response, the Bundy family called on militia groups across the county to help them defend their property rights. Tensions between the Bundys with their militia followers and the BLM ran high until the federal officers pulled out to prevent unnecessary bloodshed. Ryan Bundy was cited as a leader during this standoff and announced to their followers what he saw as a victory for their movement. === Malheur Wildlife Refuge Standoff === In 2015, Bundy and his brother heard about the story of Dwight and Steven Hammond, two Oregon ranchers who had been previously convicted of arson on federal land and jailed for that crime. In support of their fellow ranchers and in protest of the Hammond's renewed jail sentence, the Bundys rallied hundreds of people to march through the town of Burns with their firearms and then moved this protest to the nearby Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. The two brothers led their militia group, known as the Citizens for Constitutional Freedom, to take over the U.S. Fish and Wildlife buildings at the refuge and occupied the land for 41 days. The standoff ended on February 11, 2016 after the FBI forced the final four protesters to surrender. The occupation resulted in several arrests, including Ryan and Ammon Bundy, and the shooting and killing of one of the organizers, LaVoy Finicum. Bundy was also reportedly injured during this shooting and was one of the 26 people indicted as a result from this armed standoff. === Acquittal and Mistrial === In October 2016, jurors voted to acquit Ryan Bundy, his brother Ammon, and five others of charges ranging from conspiracy to possession of firearms in federal facilities and depredation of government property. There is uncertainty about why jurors found for acquittal, with some saying the prosecutors failed to prove conspiracy and others arguing that it was due to nullification. The jury was undecided on only one charge facing Ryan Bundy: theft of government property over allegations that he removed surveillance cameras at the refuge. Soon after, the Bundy brothers and their father Cliven were tried in Nevada on charges related to the 2014 Bunkerville standoff. During this trial, Bundy represented himself and forced prosecutors to admit that they had illegally withheld evidence that might have helped his defense. The judge declared a mistrial and ordered all charges dropped against the Bundy trio, citing \\"flagrant prosecutorial misconduct\\" by government prosecutors. Ryan Bundy was then released from jail after being held there for nearly two years after the government argued that he was too dangerous to await trial in the community. == 2018 Nevada election == In 2018, Bundy ran for Governor of Nevada as an Independent Candidate. Throughout the course of the race he raised $37,000. Most of these donations came from out of state and $24,000 of it was from in- kind donations. His father Cliven reportedly did not donate to his campaign. He ran his campaign based on a strict interpretation of the Constitution, support for state sovereignty, and vehement opposition to public lands. Bundy, like his father, believes that the federal government has no authority to own and manage the public land in the West, harkening back to the beliefs of the Sagebrush Rebellion in the late twentieth century. The general election was held on November 6, 2018 and Bundy received 13,891 votes out of 971,799 for a total of 1.9% of the electorate. He came in third place behind Adam Laxalt and current Governor Steve Sisolak. === Controversial beliefs === Bundy was met with controversy over his anti-gay views, belief in conspiracy theories, and extreme ideology. He has said that being gay is \\"sick and wrong\\" and that homosexuality \\"is a disease.\\" He believes that chemtrails are being sprayed from aircraft onto the general population for unknown but nefarious reasons and that former president Barack Obama is not a US citizen. He maintains a distaste of politicians and the criminal justice system, and has said that the people who live in Nevada are not free. Bundy has called for securing the sovereignty of the state of Nevada as more than just a US province. This echoes the ideology of the sovereign citizen movement, which generally consists of individuals in the US who believe they can declare themselves sovereign and not be bound by federal laws or agencies. When asked about the phrase sovereign citizen, Bundy said \\"You're either a sovereign, or you're a citizen. I believe that I am a sovereign. People created government, government didn't create people. So the government is not my master, I am theirs.\\" == Personal life == Bundy is married to Angie Huntington Bundy, and the couple has eight children. Just like his father Cliven and his brother Ammon, Bundy is a devout Mormon. Arizona court records show Ryan Bundy accumulated traffic violations from 2007 through 2015, including failure to show evidence of financial responsibility, no current insurance, no current registration and no valid license. In 2016, Bundy and his wife lived in Cedar City, Utah. At that time, he owned a construction company and ran a melon business. In 2018, Bundy and his wife lived in Mesquite, Nevada, where he ranched and worked in construction while he mounted his bid for Governor of Nevada. == References == ==External links== * Bundy family's official blog Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Nevada Independents Category:Latter Day Saints from Nevada Category:American prisoners and detainees Category:Bundy standoff Category:Dudley–Winthrop family Category:People from Bunkerville, Nevada Category:People from Mesquite, Nevada Category:Prisoners and detainees of the United States federal government ","title":"Ryan C.

Porus created by Swastik Productions was one of the most expensive and acclaimed shows on Indian television. Satyarth's biography of screen legend Sridevi titled Sridevi - The Eternal Screen Goddess published in 2019 by Penguin Random House also went on to win high praise. Satyarth has been named one of the Top 50 Indian authors to follow on social media. ==Early life== Satyarth was born in Cuttack, Odisha.

During this phase, his short stories won the British Council prize and also appeared in the Chicken Soup for the Soul series. In 2011, he quit journalism to become a full-time author and screenwriter. ==As Author== ===The Emperor's Riddles=== Satyarth with Shobha De at Bangalore Lit Fest 2014 The idea for The Emperor's Riddles was born out of a random Internet search by Nayak after reading the Dan Brown thriller Angels & Demons to find out if there was something similarly esoteric and mysterious hidden in the history of India. The surfing yielded an obscure but fascinating conspiracy theory involving one of the greatest Emperors of ancient India. Nayak was intrigued by the Emperor's legend and the imperial secret believed to be still alive and functioning and decided to capture this story. The first draft took about six months and was ready in 2011. The manuscript was accepted by Red Ink Literary Agency and subsequently underwent another round of editing. Nayak received publishing offers from Rupa & Co. and Amaryllis and he eventually signed the deal with Amaryllis in 2012. The book was first released at the New Delhi World Book Fair in February 2014. The Emperor's Riddles was met with a positive response.

The New Indian Express declared the thriller \\"a hit with young readers\\" and said it \\"opened a completely different avenue for budding writers to experiment with\\". While English Vinglish director Gauri Shinde called the book \\"an acclaimed thriller\\" via Twitter, the SpectralHues book review said the thriller's \\"shock twist towards the end makes you feel so ignorant\\" and that \\"a Christopher Nolan of the West or our very own Anurag Kashyap can pretty well give it a thought to bring The Emperor’s Riddles to life on screen\\". Since its release, The Emperor's Riddles has been likened to the mystery novels of Dan Brown. In an interview with The Times of India, Nayak stated that \\"the fact that the book's earning comparisons with Dan Brown is overwhelming\\" and \\"If Brown has codes, my book has riddles.\\" Satyarth's upcoming thriller sees his central protagonist Om Patnaik in the center of a mystery with mythological overtones. ===Sridevi : The Eternal Screen Goddess=== Delhi Launch Satyarth Nayak with Karan Johar In 2019, Satyarth announced his first non-fiction book on India's First Female Superstar Sridevi.

Talking to the media, Satyarth stated that \\"I have always been a huge admirer of Sridevi and this book gave me the perfect opportunity to celebrate the journey of India's beloved screen goddess. It was wonderful interacting with various film personalities that she worked with over the years, and put together their memories and stories into a narrative that charts her saga from a child star to India's first female superstar\\" while Penguin head endorsed \\"Sridevi by Satyarth Nayak is a tribute to the actor and a gift for her fans.

Deepthi Talwar from Westland told the media \\"We’re very excited about the collection that Satyarth has put together. He takes us through popular legends and lesser known stories from the Puranas, delving into the minds of several characters to psychoanalyse their actions.\\" In October 2020, The Telegraph featured the book on their list of highly anticipated books of 2021 saying \\"Dabbling into Indian mythology this time, he promises to write stories from the Puranas that still find resonance in today’s time and impart the wisdom that can find relevance in our lives.

They were intended to decorated the seat-backs in its audience hall on piazza della Signoria. Charity was the first painting to be completed and was delivered in December 1469. The commission was temporarily transferred to Botticelli, probably after a delay by Pollaiolo. Botticelli produced Fortitude before loud protests from Pollaiolo and his brother Antonio that a second contract returned it to Piero and his studio produced the remaining six works in the series. In completing it, it is unclear how much of a contribution Antonio made to Piero's work and some art historians have attributed it instead entirely to Antonio. Billi, Albertini and Cruttwell argue from documents that the whole cycle was by Piero, whereas Ullman and others attribute all six works to Antonio based on stylistic comparisons with the few signed works by Antonio, including prints.

The main provisions of the Act were triggered if the House of Commons did not give its consent to either a withdrawal agreement or leaving without a deal by 19 October 2019. The Act proposed a new withdrawal date of 31 January 2020, which the Prime Minister was obliged to accept if the proposal was accepted by the European Council. The Act also contained provisions that detailed the course of action if an alternative date were proposed by the European Council, required regular reports on the progress of any negotiations between the EU and the UK, and set out the format of the letter the Prime Minister was required to send to the President of the European Council should he be required to seek an extension. It also removed the discretion of the Prime Minister not to amend exit day in response to an extension. The Act was given Royal Assent on 9 September 2019 and commenced the same day. The bill was proposed by opposition and backbench MPs after Boris Johnson became Prime Minister. It was passed after they took control of the parliamentary agenda in the run-up to the controversialand later ruled voidprorogation of Parliament. The Government fiercely opposed the bill, and Boris Johnson and other eurosceptics repeatedly referred to the Act as the \\"Surrender Act\\". The Government had been suspected of examining options on how to nullify the Act's effect. On 19 October, Johnson sent the letter to the president of the European Council Donald Tusk requesting an extension to the Brexit withdrawal date per the Act. This was formally approved on 28 October. On 30 October 2019, the day named as \\"exit day\\" in UK legislation was accordingly changed to 31 January 2020 at 11.00 p.m.The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (Exit Day) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations 2019 SI 2019 No. 1423, 30th October 2019. The Act was repealed on 23 January 2020 by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020. == Background == In June 2016, the United Kingdom voted in a referendum to leave the European Union by a margin of 52% to 48%. Nine months later, on 29 March 2017, the Government, by then led by Theresa May, invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, after Parliament voted to approve the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017 by a vote of 498 to 114. After a General Election in June 2017, May's Conservative Party lost their majority, but were supported by the Democratic Unionist Party to enact their legislative agenda. The Brexit withdrawal agreement was published in November 2018, and was rejected three times by Parliament in early 2019. Facing the prospect of leaving the EU without a deal, Parliament voted to also reject a \\"no deal\\" scenario and to request an extension to the Article 50 process with the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2019. The Government and the European Council subsequently agreed to delay Brexit, until 12 April 2019 in the first instance, and then to 31 October 2019. Due to opposition from her own party to her handling of Brexit, May resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party on 7 June 2019 and Prime Minister on 24 July 2019. She was succeeded after the following leadership election as leader and Prime Minister by Boris Johnson, who pledged, \\"do or die\\", to withdraw the UK from the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal. On 28 August 2019, Johnson advised Queen Elizabeth II to prorogue Parliament from the second week of September 2019 until 14 October 2019, days before a scheduled summit of the European Council on 17 October. The prorogation reduced the amount of time that was available to Parliament to scrutinise Government business, and was criticised outwith the government as a tactic to force a \\"no deal\\" Brexit without the consent of Parliament: in particular the Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow called prorogation in the circumstances a \\"constitutional outrage\\"; and protestors at an impromptu demonstration saw the government as effecting a coup d'état or self- coup. == Contents of the Act == The Act contained four substantive sections and a schedule that contained the form of a letter to request an extension of the negotiating period: * Section 1 obliged the Prime Minister to request an extension to the Article 50 negotiating period for the purpose of negotiating a withdrawal agreement, unless the House of Commons has passed a motion which either approved a withdrawal agreement or approves departure without a deal, and the House of Lords had debated the same motion. If such a motion was not approved, the Prime Minister was obliged to make the request no later than 19 October 2019. * Section 2 obliged the Government to publish a progress report on negotiations before 30 November 2019, and if rejected or amended, publish a second report which detailed its plans for further negotiations. Section 2 also obliged the Government to make progress reports every four weeks from 7 February 2020 unless directed otherwise. * Section 3 obliged the Prime Minister to accept an extension to 31 January 2020, and allowed the Prime Minister to either accept an offer or ask the House of Commons to accept an offer of any other date. * Section 4 amended legislation to ensure the date of departure is synchronised with European law. * The Schedule specified the required layout and wording of the letter that requests the extension. ==Legislative history== On 3 September 2019, Conservative MP Oliver Letwin tabled a motion that would allow the House of Commons to undertake proceedings on the second reading, committee stage, consideration and third reading of a backbench Brexit bill on the following day. The motion was passed with a majority of 27. A total of 21 Conservative MPs voted in favour of the motion and against the Government; this led to the whip being withdrawn from the rebels, and pushed the government further away from a majority (after Conservative MP Dr Phillip Lee lost the government its working majority of 1 earlier in the day by defecting to the Liberal Democrats). The rebels included the Father of the House and former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Ken Clarke, eight other Cabinet ministers under Cameron and May, and Winston Churchill's grandson, Nicholas Soames.The full list of MPs who were suspended from the Conservative whip were: Guto Bebb, Richard Benyon, Steve Brine, Alistair Burt, Greg Clark, Kenneth Clarke, David Gauke, Justine Greening, Dominic Grieve, Sam Gyimah, Philip Hammond, Stephen Hammond, Richard Harrington, Margot James, Oliver Letwin, Anne Milton, Caroline Nokes, Antoinette Sandbach, Nicholas Soames, Rory Stewart, and Ed Vaizey. In response to the suspension of the rebel MPs, Jo Johnson—Boris's brother—and Amber Rudd resigned from the Cabinet in protest shortly after. The legislation was introduced to the House of Commons by Labour MP Hilary Benn as the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill on the following day. The Government made clear its opposition to the bill from the beginning, and said that, were it to pass through the House of Commons, the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, would immediately bring forward a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act for a General Election. The bill passed Second Reading by 329 votes to 300. The bill was amended once at the committee stage, by a Stephen Kinnock amendment that would allow the Withdrawal Agreement to be discussed again, which passed as there were not any ‘no’ tellers provided for the division. The bill passed its third reading on the same day, by 327 votes to 299. The bill then moved to the House of Lords on the same day, and there were suggestions that the bill could be filibustered; unlike in the House of Commons, the House of Lords typically does not restrict the content of debates. The Shadow Leader of the House of Lords, Baroness Angela Smith, tabled a guillotine motion that would allow the bill to clear the Lords by 5pm on Friday 6 September; Conservative peers tabled 102 amendments to the guillotine motion in an attempt to prioritise other parliamentary business over the bill. By 1:30am on 5 September, the Government announced it would discontinue the filibuster and allow the bill to return to the House of Commons, if amended by the House of Lords, for the 9 September sitting. The bill passed Second Reading without a division on 5 September, and passed the Committee, Report, and Third Reading stages unamended on 6 September. The bill received Royal Assent and became law on 9 September 2019, several hours before Parliament was suspended. == Reactions == ===Political response=== In response to the bill's passage on 4 September, the Government immediately brought a motion for an early general election under the terms of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. The motion failed 298–56, short of the two-thirds supermajority of all MPs (434) needed to trigger an election; opposition parties either voted against or abstained on the motion as they believed the intention of the government was to ensure departure from the EU without a deal while Parliament was dissolved for such an election. On 9 September, a second attempt at triggering an early election failed 293–46. On 5 September, at a press conference at a police training school in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, Johnson said he would rather be \\"dead in a ditch\\" than request an extension to Article 50. Johnson was criticised by the Police Federation of England and Wales and others for using the speech for partisan purposes, thus bringing into question the impartiality of the police. In a press release on 6 September, Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police, John Robins, stated the speech was intended to announce new policing policy and the force was not given prior notice of the speech being expanded to include other matters. In response to continuing concerns of the possibility of Johnson breaking the law, Secretary of State for Justice Robert Buckland stated on 8 September he had discussions with Johnson over the importance of the rule of law—which Buckland, as Lord Chancellor, has a legal obligation to uphold—but denied rumours he would resign from the Cabinet if Johnson did break the law. By 9 September, reports surfaced that the Government would seek to bypass the law by sending a request for an extension as required by the Act alongside another letter that declared the request invalid; former Supreme Court justice Lord Sumption described such an act, in the face of judicial action, as a possible contempt of court that would risk the resignations of the law officers in his Cabinet, while former Director of Public Prosecutions Ken Macdonald said Johnson was risking imprisonment for the same offence. In response, Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn tabled an emergency motion for debate on that day on the importance of the rule of law; the motion passed without a vote in a symbolic victory for the opposition, although the Government stated in the debate that their policy would be to not request an extension, despite the legal requirement to do so. Polling undertaken by YouGov over the weekend of 6–8 September 2019 indicated 50% of respondents disapproved and 28% of respondents approved of the proposition of Johnson breaching the law; Leave (52%–28%) and Conservative (50%–34%) voters were most supportive whereas Remain (8%–77%), Liberal Democrat (11%–76%) and Labour (14%–69%) were the most opposed. On the same day, Liz Saville Roberts, the leader of Plaid Cymru in the House of Commons, announced she had entered discussions with other parties to gather support for impeachment if Johnson refused to obey the law. Impeachment is an arcane parliamentary procedure that has never been successfully levelled towards a Prime Minister or a Cabinet Minister; the last individual to be impeached was Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville in 1806. Plaid Cymru had spearheaded the last serious impeachment attempt, an unsuccessful 2004 effort to indict then-Prime Minister Tony Blair for lying to Parliament regarding the Iraq War. Johnson, then a member of the opposition frontbench, was another high-profile supporter of the effort to impeach Blair and wrote a column in The Daily Telegraph that accused him of \\"treating Parliament and the public with contempt\\". On 26 September 2019, former Prime Minister John Major said in a speech to the Centre for European Reform that he \\"feared\\" that Johnson would use an Order of Council to nullify the Act until after 31 October. Orders of Council, in contrast to the similarly named Orders in Council, are decisions taken by the Privy Council alone, as opposed to with the consent of the Queen; such orders are typically made for technical reasons—such as regulating the medical profession—and not to disapply statute law. The option to use Orders of Council would likely utilise provisions of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 that allow for the Government, in times of emergency, to temporarily disapply laws. The following afternoon, 10 Downing Street denied Johnson would use Orders of Council to bypass the Act, but reiterated the Government's commitment to leaving the EU on 31 October. ===Court cases=== On 12 September 2019, an application was made to the Court of Session in Scotland by Jo Maugham and Joanna Cherry to require the Prime Minister to sign the extension letter in the event no withdrawal agreement could be agreed in time. The applicants hoped that the Court's power of nobile officium, unique among UK courts, would enable it to send the extension letter on Johnson's behalf if he declined to do so. Cherry, the justice spokeswoman for the Scottish National Party, and Maugham had successfully brought a case before the Court of Session to challenge Johnson's prorogation of Parliament, which had delivered a judgment that declared it unlawful on the previous day. On 24 September 2019, the Supreme Court ruled in R (Miller) v The Prime Minister and Cherry v Advocate General for Scotland that the prorogation was unlawful and void; as a response, Parliament was recalled to sit the following day. That morning, the Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox, said there was \\"no question of this government not obeying the law\\" with regard to the Act, and that the Government believed what legal obligations the Act contained was an open question. On 7 October 2019, the Cherry/Maugham petition to the Court of Session to force Johnson to comply with the Act was denied. The Outer House of the Court of Session ruled that there was no \\"reasonable apprehension of a breach of statutory duty\\" and that, in the light of averments before the Court that the Government would comply with the act, there was no need for a coercive order to enforce compliance. On 9 October, the Inner House of the Court of Session decided that a final ruling on the petition would not be made until 21 Octobertwo days after the deadline in the Act for the Prime Minister to request an extension. Separately in the Inner House, the campaigners requested a ruling that, if such a letter came to be required and Johnson failed to write it, the Court would write the letter itself using nobile officium powers Following a special sitting of Parliament on 19 October, the Benn Act required the prime minister immediately to write to the European Council with a request for an extension of withdrawal until 31 January 2020. Prime minister Boris Johnson sent two letters to the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk: one, which was stated to be from the UK prime minister but was not signed, referred to the requirements of the Benn Act and requested an extension until 31 January 2020; the other, signed personally by Johnson and copied to all Council members, stated that it was his own belief that a delay would be a mistake and requested support from the president and Council members for his continuing efforts to ensure withdrawal without an extension. The letters were delivered by the British permanent representative in Brussels, together with a cover note signed by himself which affirmed that the first letter complied with the Benn Act.Letters and note: unsigned letter and cover note ; signed letter . On 21 October, the case resumed in the Inner House. The campaigners conceded that Johnson had fulfilled the requirement of the Act that he write seeking an extension, but contended that his second letter negated the first. The Court refused the government's request to dismiss the case, deciding that it should remain before the Court \\"until it is clear that the obligations under [the Benn Act] have been complied with in full\\". On 7 October, government lawyers had undertaken to the Outer House that Johnson would abide by all requirements of the Act. These included responding to the EU's reaction to his letter. Any breach of that undertaking could have placed Johnson in contempt of the Court. ===Parliamentary language debate=== The Prime Minister's description of the law as a \\"Surrender Act\\" in Parliament was criticised by Dewsbury MP Paula Sherriff, who said his language was unnecessarily inflammatory and said that opposition politicians routinely received death threats that similarly called the law a \\"Surrender Act\\" and accused MPs of \\"betrayal\\" and that Johnson should moderate his language; Johnson received heckles of \\"shame\\" when he described Sherriff's comments as \\"humbug\\". Tracy Brabin, the MP for the neighbouring constituency of Batley and Spen, also asked Johnson for moderation to prevent violence against MPs; her predecessor, Jo Cox, was murdered in June 2016 by a neo-Nazi. Johnson declined and elicited further outrage from MPs when he said that \\"the best way to honour [Cox's] memory\\" was \\"to get Brexit done\\". == Outcome == On 19 October 2019, a special Saturday sitting of Parliament was held to debate a revised withdrawal agreement. Prime minister Boris Johnson moved approval of that agreement. MPs passed, by 322 to 306, Sir Oliver Letwin's amendment to the motion, to delay consideration of the agreement until the legislation to implement it has been passed; the motion was then carried as amended, implementing Letwin's delay. This delay activated the Act, requiring the prime minister immediately to write to the European Council with a request for an extension of withdrawal until 31 January 2020. Later on that day, prime minister Johnson sent two letters to the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk: one, which was stated to be from the UK prime minister but was not signed, referred to the requirements of the Act and requested an extension until 31 January 2020; the other, signed personally by Johnson and copied to all Council members, stated that it was his own belief that a delay would be a mistake and requested support from the president and Council members for his continuing efforts to ensure withdrawal without an extension. The letters were delivered by the British permanent representative in Brussels, together with a cover note signed by himself which affirmed that the first letter complied with the Act. On 22 October, the legislation to implement the withdrawal agreementthe EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Billwas approved in the Commons (second reading) by 329 votes to 299. However, the accompanying \\"programme motion\\", to get all stages of the bill completed in three days and thus before 31 October, was defeated by 322 votes to 308 after MPs objected that this would not allow time for adequate consideration. On 28 October, the extension of the Brexit withdrawal date to 31 January 2020 was formally approved between the prime minister and the EU. He called for a general election on 12 December, which MPs voted for on 29 October, and Johnson went on to win an 80-seat majority. == See also == *Padfield v Minister of Agriculture, a 1968 House of Lords case which set the precedent that it is impermissible for government officers to seek to frustrate statutory law. == Notes == ==References* Category:Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom relating to the European Union Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 2019 Category:Brexit Category:Repealed United Kingdom Acts of Parliament ","title":"European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019"},{"id":"61709847","text":"Hung Chia-chun (born 28 June 1977) is a Taiwanese taekwondo practitioner.

Irianna V.L. was found innocent after she appealed. Because Irianna was found guilty based on insufficient DNA sample, the case hit the headlines. Another issue that also caused controversy was that the court took into consideration the social contacts and relations of Irianna, most notably a trip to Barcelona, a city that hosts many anarchists. Irianna's sentence of 13 years was met with skepticism as the principle of presumption of innocence was shaken. == Timeline == It was 2011 when Greek police was surveilling the house of a group of notorious anarchists, then suspects for links with \\"Conspiracy of Fire Nuclei\\". Irianna visited the specific place some times as those anarchists were friends of her boyfriend. After a police raid, Irianna gave a testimony to Greek police and voluntarily a DNA sample. In November 2011, arms were found in Polytechnic School of Athens, by accident, a small sample of DNA was spotted on them, below the threshold for reaching safe conclusion. In 2013, Irianna was arrested solely based on the tiny DNA sample found on the arms the police found in 2011. The issue was that the sample was so small that it was less that it was required by the law- so little that the sample was consumed for the first examination of the DNA and there was no left for cross-examination to validate the results. The first degree trial that followed, found Irianna guilty and sentenced her to 13 years in prison, based on the DNA sampling. In 2018, she was found not guilty by a second decree trial and was freed. === Concerns raised about the DNA sample in Irianna's case === *The DNA sample collected from the guns were 174pg when the required mass of DNA is legally defined as 200pg. *The two samples (from the guns and Irianna's) matched in 7 from total 16 sequences identified. *The European Ombudsman in 2008 (decision 2008/C 89/01) reported that because of false positive results in DNA matching, every sample should be cross examined at least once. == Criticism of the trial == The acceptance by the court of the DNA evidence has been widely criticized. Professor of the philosophy of Law at University of Athens, Aristides Hatzis, highlighted various police shortcomings regarding the DNA sampling, from collecting the sample to its interpretation, that should have led to the rejection of the DNA matching and hence Irianna should have been found not guilty. Hatzis also claimed that Irianna was punished by the police and the court for having an affair and social relations with anarchists- which constitutes a fundamental violation of the rule of law. Likewise, Gregoris Kalfetzis, professor of Law at AUTH raised his concern on the handling and interpretation of the DNA sample and noticed parallels between Irianna's case and the notorious Dreyfus affair- where the judiciary decision was predetermined before the trial and the evidence was manipulated to fit the decision. ==See also== *Anarchism in Greece *DNA profiling ==References== Category:Anarchism in Greece Category:Trials in Greece Category:2013 in Greece Category:Wrongful convictions ","title":"Case of Irianna V.L."},{"id":"61709880","text":"Dioscorea hispida, also known as the Indian three-leaved yam, is a species of yam in the genus Dioscorea, native to South and Southeast Asia.

Both the manor and the village belonged to the Fief of Bråde, which again belonged to the Bishops of Roskilde. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Snedinge was owned by members of the noble Grubbe and Daa families. Herluf Trolle Daa placed the village of Snedinge's remaining land under the manor and later sold the estate to his relative Alexander Rabe von Papenheim. Snedinge, c. 1919 In 1731, Papenheim was succeeded as owner of the estate by his widow Regitze Grubbe. Their heirs sold Snedinge to Niels Trolle in 1767. He was already the owner of Trolholm. His son, Herluf Trolle, inherited the estate in 1667. In 1707, he sold it to his broither, Ulrik Adolph Holstein. In 1708, he established the Countship of Holsteinsborg from Snedinge and the farms Fyrendal and Trolholm. The Countship of Holsteinsborg existed until it was dissolved as a result of the lensafløsningen (abolition of legal titles and entailment of property) of 1921. ==Architecture== The two-winged main building is built in red brick.

He is best known for his collaborations with rapper Yung Gravy as well as his 2019 single, \\"Lalala\\" with producer Y2K, which has reached over 600 million plays on the streaming service Spotify. == Early life == Gumuchian was born in Vancouver in 1995 to a family of Armenian descent. He was home schooled before he began high school. While growing up, his mother had encouraged him to learn piano but he had always struggled with music theory. Gumuchian claims that he was good with rhythm and that he enjoyed playing Djembe drums, but did not listen to music for recreation until the age of 15. Before his fame, a viral video from the dance crew TFBoys features one of his early singles == Career == === 2014–2016: Broke Boy Gang and SoundCloud === Gumuchian started working with music after experiencing a back injury which prevented him from pursuing his dream as a professional swimmer. He became interested in rapping and music production in 2014 when experimenting on GarageBand with a group of friends. Gumuchian began simply making music for enjoyment with this group of friends who later deemed themselves Broke Boy Gang. After five or six months of performing live as a group and releasing multiple tracks online, the group broke up. He began posting tracks on SoundCloud in September 2016 under the moniker of \\"bbnomula\\" where he quickly gained millions of streams and followers. He gained popularity in China where he sold out his first few \\"back-to-back\\" headlining tours. He credited his overseas popularity to the Chinese dance crew TFBoys, after one of the members, Jackson Yee, danced to the track \\"Yoyo Tokyo\\" at his own birthday party. === 2017–2018: Baby Gravy EP and Bb Steps=== In 2017, Gumuchian released his first EP, Baby Gravy, as a collaboration with Yung Gravy, shortly before releasing his debut studio album, Bb Steps, and his second collaborative EP, Whatever, with So Loki in 2018. === 2019: Recess, \\"Lalala\\" and I Don't Care At All === In early 2019, Gumuchian released his second studio album, Recess, which draws inspiration from the original Disney show of the same name, and includes features from Y2K and Trippy Tha Kid. Many tracks off of Recess gained millions of streams on Spotify. Gumuchian and Y2K have been recognized for marketing their single \\"Lalala\\" online by using various websites and online apps, namely Tinder, Instagram meme accounts, TikTok and Craigslist. The song was able to peak on over 20 charts around the world and gain over 400 million streams and 500,000 sales in the United States. Later in 2019, Gumuchian would go on to release another album, I Don't Care At All. The album featured various pre-released singles, \\"Slop\\", \\"Pouch\\", and \\"Shining On My Ex\\", the latter of which featured frequent collaborator Yung Gravy. The album was solely produced by Y2K. == Artistry == === Musical style === Gumuchian has described his own music as “oxymoronical rap” that is \\"ignorant but melodic\\". === Influences === Gumuchian grew up listening to straight bass dubstep and house music from names like Datsik and Excision, before listening to hip-hop artists, namely Tupac, Gucci Mane and Chief Keef. He has cited Yung Lean and Pouya as his main inspirations as a white rapper. == Personal life == Gumuchian lives in Vancouver but has previously lived in Kelowna where he received a degree in human kinesiology at University of British Columbia Okanagan in 2019. == Discography == === Studio albums === { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\"  !

Designed by Benjamin Ferrey, it was built in 1855-56 to replace an earlier church on the same site and became redundant in 1972. The church, now a private residence, has been a Grade II listed building since 1955. In the churchyard, an early 18th century chest tomb of the Slade family also became Grade II listed in 1986. ==History== All Saints was built in 1855-56 to replace Curland's parish church, which had become dilapidated. Plans for the new church were drawn up by Benjamin Ferrey and its construction largely paid for by Rev. Prebendary Lance, the rector of Buckland St Mary, alongside public subscription. The committee of the diocese's Church Building Association also granted £60 towards the estimated £420 cost of the church in 1855. The foundation stone was laid on 28 August 1855 by Rev. Charles Leigh Pemberton, the rector of Curry Mallet and Curland. The church was rebuilt from the foundations, with Mr. H. Davis of Taunton as the contractor and Mr. J. Billing of Buckland St Mary as the supervisor. Stonework from the Curland's previous church was reused and additional stone salvaged from the chancel of the church at Buckland St Mary, which at the time was also undergoing reconstruction according to designs by Ferrey. All Saints reopened on 28 October 1856. As the new church was constructed according to the exact shape of its predecessor, reconsecration was not necessary. It remained a place of worship until it was declared redundant on 27 October 1972. The church was used for storage from 1974 and later converted to residential use in 1991. ==Architecture== All Saints is built of flint with dressings of Hamstone and a clay tile roof, in the Perpendicular style. The west three-light window and four of the five side two-light windows were sourced from the chancel of Buckland St Mary's church. The east three-light window was new and fitted with glass by James Powell and Sons of Whitefriars. The church was designed to accommodate 70 persons and made up of three-bay nave, chancel and south porch. A small bell-turret for two bells was added to the west gable. The low pitched roof was built of stained deal and the altar laid with encaustic tiles. The pulpit and reading desk were made of stained oak. The glazing work was carried out by Mr. Gould of Chard, the painting and diaper work of the reredos by Mr. A. Stansell of Taunton and the tablets containing the commandments (gifted by Mr. J. Stephens of Musgrove) was engraved by Mr. T. D.

Author Kathryn H. Fuller-Seeley is a professor and graduate advisor at the University of Texas Moody College of Communication in Austin, specializing in Media Studies. ==Synopsis== Jack Benny was a 20th-century American violinist and comedic entertainer who achieved success in vaudeville, radio, television and film. He played one role throughout his radio and television careers, a caricature of himself as a minimally talented musician and penny pincher who was the butt of all the jokes. Fuller-Seeley takes the reader through Benny's transition from vaudeville to radio success. Benny's on-air persona and that of the roles of supporting players, were a reworking of his self-deprecating vaudeville act, in collaboration with his head writer Benny Cohn. The radio broadcasts originated on May 2, 1932, from the Roof Garden at New Amsterdam Theatre in New York. Broadcast headquarters were moved to Hollywood, California in 1936, to accommodate Benny's film career. Over the course of its run, sponsors included Canada Dry, Chevrolet and Jell-O. Announcer Don Wilson was brought on to read product commercials, after Benny had already run through eight previous announcers. Wilson proved himself not only adept at pushing the advertiser's products, but also as a jovial foil to much of Benny's comedy. Like many of the show's core group, Wilson remained with Benny when the show ran on national television. Fuller-Seeley illustrates how the early stars of radio broadcasts were able to draw in their audiences through running gags, in the form of feuds, contests, or other methods. Among the publicity gags that ran for years, was a mock feud between Benny and Fred Allen. The latter had his own radio show rivaling Benny's popularity. The two were close friends in real life, and the mock feud helped both build their audience ratings. Actor Ronald Colman and wife actress Benita Hume were brought into the cast as Benny's sophisticated British neighbors who were always aghast at Benny's lifestyle. The \\"Why I Can’t Stand Jack Benny Contest” generated 300,000 entries, half of them in the form of poetry, and featured Fred Allen as the judge. The winning entry was a poem written by a Carroll Craig of Pacific Palisades, read on the air by Colman. Group photograph of Eddie Anderson, Dennis Day, Phil Harris, Mary Livingstone, Jack Benny, Don Wilson, and Mel Blanc Two of Benny's gags that highlighted his image of a tightwad, were his Maxwell automobile, and the money vault beneath his home. The Maxwell sputtered and popped as either Benny or his valet Rochester drove it. In radio, the sounds of the automobile were provided by veteran voice actor Mel Blanc who provided many of the show's other sound effects. Blanc would also find fame providing cartoon voices for Looney Tunes. Both the Maxwell and Blanc carried over into the television show. For Benny's vault, radio audiences were given an audio tour of the subterranean fortress-like moat and alligators, though creaking doors to an entrance guarded by an old soldier who was a veteran of a previous century's war. The concept of his vault was transformed to visual reality on television. After tenor Kenny Baker left the radio show, Dennis Day was added to the cast and remained with the transition to television. The author posits that part of the show's uniqueness for its time, was the portrayal of women as independent characters who held their own with the men. The fictional mother of Dennis Day drove a steamroller, and was portrayed by Verna Felton on both the radio and television incarnations of the show. Mrs. Day's radio sister was Mary Livingstone, Benny's real-life wife. Livingstone's characterization of a sassy, independent woman made her an instant hit with the audience, and over time, elevated her popularity levels to equal that of Gracie Allen. Two chapters of the book focus on the addition of African-American vaudeville performer Eddie Anderson as Benny's valet Rochester Van Jones. Their inter-racial partnership was a rarity during a time of racial segregation in the arts, an era when black radio characters such as Amos and Andy were played by white actors. Anderson faced criticism from the black community that he was playing a subservient character, but Rochester usually got the last laugh. == Release information == * ==See also== *The Jack Benny Program == Bibliography == * * * == References == Category:2017 non- fiction books Category:1932 radio programme debuts Category:1955 radio programme endings Category:1930s American radio programs Category:1930s in comedy Category:1940s American radio programs Category:1950s American radio programs Category:American comedy radio programs Category:Books about actors Category:Radio programs adapted into television shows Category:NBC radio programs Category:NBC Blue Network radio programs ","title":"Jack Benny and the Golden Age of American Radio Comedy"},{"id":"61710259","text":"Walter Hurschler (born 25 April 1959) is a Swiss skier.

Having completed his eight grade of school in 1940, he went on to enter the military in 1941 and became a cadet at the Krasnodar Military Aviation School of Pilots. Hen then trained at the Konotop Military Aviation School of Pilots, which he graduated from with the rank of junior lieutenant in 1943 before being assigned to the 20th Reserve Aviation Regiment as a flight instructor. In December 1945 he was transferred to the 49th Separate Transport Aviation Regiment, where he served as a flight instructor until being sent to teach at the Stalingrad Military Aviation School of Pilots, and in 1950 he was promoted to the position of flight commander and made a military pilot 1st class; earlier that year he was reassigned to the 176th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment. He did not see combat before the Korean War. In November 1950 the regiment was sent to China, having been sent to the Russian Far East earlier that year. ==Korean War== Before entering combat in April 1951, Suchkov helped train other pilots in his regiment. There he was appointed deputy commander of flight in the 3rd squadron. Having made his first sortie on 3 April 1951, he was soon credited with his first shootdown on 7 April - a B-29. He then was shot down another B-29 on 12 April, but then went several months without any credited aerial victories until 9 September despite having been promoted to squadron commander in July. In that aerial battle that day he and Grigory Ges each shot down one F-86 according to Soviet records, but America documents did not confirm losses from that incident. On 12 September he was credited with shooting down two F-80s ; the Soviets claimed to have shot down 11 F-80 and F-84 aircraft that day. US records indicate the loss of only one F-84, but Korean War historian Diego Zampini estimated that at least three American F-84s were lost that day, with two of the losses being recorded several days later. Aviation historian Igor Seidov says that the two aircraft Suchkov shot down on 12 September were probably F-84E No.51-666 and F-84E No. 51-663. Having earned the title of ace, he continued to fly in combat, and on 4 November his colleagues witnessed him shoot down an F-84. The Soviets claimed to have shot down three other F-84s that day, but only one F-84 was recorded as lost. Four days later he claimed another aerial victory, which was listed as an F-84 by Soviet documents; however, American records and historians indicate that it was probably an F-80. After being credited with his last three aerial victories in December, he gained a possible victory on 12 January 1952, although ground units were not able to provide any sort of confirmation. He was withdrawn from the Korean War in February 1952 and nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union, but he did not receive the title. During the war he flew an estimated 120 sorties and engaged in 50 aerial battles. Most Russian historians credit him with 10 aerial victories, but some Western sources credit him with 12. ==Postwar== After the Korean War Suchkov became the deputy commander of his combat regiment, and in 1954 he was promoted to regimental commander, but in 1955 be became the deputy chief of staff of the 324th Air Defense Administration. Later that year he went on to hold the same position in the 78th Fighter Aviation Corps, but he retired and entered the reserve in 1956. He died in Kaluga on 2 August 1981 at the age of 57. ==Awards== * Three Order of the Red Banner (2 June 1951, 10 October 1951, and 22 February 1955) * Two Order of the Red Star (29 April 1954 and 20 December 1956) * Three Medal \\"For Military Merit\\" (23 February 1945, 18 August 1945, and 17 May 1951) ==References== ===Bibliography=== * Category:1923 births Category:1981 deaths Category:Soviet Air Force officers Category:Soviet Korean War flying aces Category:Recipients of the Order of the Red Banner ","title":"Ivan Suchkov"},{"id":"61710344","text":"Elizabeth (Beth) Smith Shortt (18 January 1859 – 14 January 1949) was one of the first three women to earn a medical degree in Canada. She was one of the women medical students expelled from Queen's University, Ontario following a hostile backlash from male staff and students at the presence of women in the medical school. Shortt went on to complete her studies at a newly established women's college and practised medicine in Hamilton, Ontario. She was a long- serving and active member of the National Council of Women of Canada and spearheaded a number of public health and women's welfare initiatives. == Early life and education == Shortt was born on 18 January 1859 in the community of Winona, which is now located in the city of Hamilton, Ontario. Her parents were Sylvester Smith (died in 1885) and Damaris Isabella Smith (McGee) (1831-1913).Typescript Elizabeth Smith Shortt, WA10,1A, Elizabeth Smith Shortt fonds, University of Waterloo Archives, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Damaris was a school teacher, and Sylvester's family were the founders of the E.D. Smith preserves company.Transcript Damaris Isabella Smith, W10A, File 2148, Elizabeth Smith Shortt fonds, University of Waterloo Archives, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada Shortt received her education from a governess as well as attending Winona School and Hamilton Collegiate Institute. She also attended Ottawa Normal School in January 1880. Even though she enjoyed her time at the school, she recalls rarely being challenged. While attending she frequently received the weekly Honourable Mentions;Extracts From Letters of Elizabeth Smith Attending Ottawa Normal School. Session January to April,1880/,1880, WA10, File 3, Elizabeth Smith Shortt Fonds, University of Waterloo Archives, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. she also attended many parliamentary sessions and frequented the House of Commons. === Queen's University === In February 1880 Shortt read in the newspaper about prospective separate classes for women in medicine; in April of the same year, she started her training at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. She was one of the first three women to attend Queen’s, accompanied by who she refers to in her personal writings as Mrs. Mae and Miss Betty. Shortt was required to be up every morning at 6:00 am and had classes until 8:00 pm; she then would continue studying until 11:00 pm. One of the first things she recalls when beginning her studies is that many found it odd for someone of her young age to be in medical school. She took physiology, histology, therapeutics, chemistry, and botany, and spent her free time reading about the physiology of hearing and sight. The medical course Shortt and others enrolled in was, in every regard, identical to the course for men: the same degree, material and qualifications. Though men and women learned the material separately, the degree examination was taken collectively.Typescript of Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons in affiliation with Queen’s University: announcement of a course of lectures for women to begin April by Fife Fowler, 1879, WA10, File 1782, Elizabeth Smith Shortt fonds, University of Waterloo Archives, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada Shortt recalls in 1882 a younger male lecturer speaking against having women students in the college, and although she did not take it personally she did state that the worst thing about it was that it would incite men in the college to be obnoxious.Typescript Elizabeth Smith Shortt, WA10, 1816, Elizabeth Smith Shortt fonds, University of Waterloo Archives, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. She also recounts unwillingly taking her obstetrics class in a connecting room beside the men's class, learning through an open door; she was also required to use a separate dissecting room from the men.Typescript of Queens Medical Education of Women by Elizabeth Smith Shortt, 1879, WA10, File 1816, Elizabeth Smith Shortt fonds, University of Waterloo Archives, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada These incidents were part of a larger backlash in the university against the presence of women in the medical school, and in 1883 the university expelled the women students due to the complaints of the men, who had threatened to leave if the women were permitted to continue studying. Sympathetic staff established a women's college, named the Kingston Women's Medical College, and Shortt and her women classmates continued their studies there. == Career == After finishing medical school in 1884, Shortt opened her own medical practice in Hamilton, Ontario. Early in her professional career, Shortt had professional mentorship from Emily Stowe and her cousin J. W. Smith, also consulting on their cases occasionally. Shortt often felt inexperienced as a physician and lacked the resources to hire a nurse, so she operated on patients alone. In order to protect her reputation as a woman practising medicine, Shortt refused to treat male patients. In 1887 Shortt returned to Kingston and lectured at the Women's Medical College at Queen's University on medical jurisprudence and sanitary science. In 1908 she moved to Ottawa and worked in a voluntary capacity for women's and mother's organisations, as well as campaigning on public health matters. === National Council of Women === Shortt was a highly active member of the National Council of Women of Canada, as well as the local and provincial councils. Throughout her time of being a member of these councils she worked, wrote and spoke about issues dealing with housing, inspection of markets, fly control, PXS pasteurization of milk, care of mentally deficient, child welfare, and mother’s pension.Elizabeth Smith Short fonds, WA10, File #2148, University of Waterloo Archives, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada In 1911, she became the first Convener of the Public Health and Mental Hygiene Committee of the National Council of Women, which worked to combat mental health disorders.Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene: Medical Directors report, 1926, WA 10, Folder 2121, Elizabeth Smith Shortt fonds, University of Waterloo Archives, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. She was also Convener of the Committee on Immigration of the National Council of Women, which was active in organizing a hostel for female immigrants in Ottawa. In 1913, after a year's study, Shortt wrote a report on behalf of the National Council of Women about the necessity of establishing mothers' allowances. This report petitioned for welfare to be given to mothers in need, ranging from widows to mothers whose husbands were unable to provide, provided there were at least two or more children in the family that were 16 years old or younger, and requiring that those between 14–16 years old were in school (with the exception of qualifying children above 16 if they are also incapacitated).The Alumnae News, 1926, WA10, File 2035, Elizabeth Smith Shortt fonds, University of Waterloo Archives, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada This petition went on to become an official act passed through legislation and became known as the Mothers' Allowance Act. Elizabeth Smith Shortt and husband Adam Shortt, 1914 Shortt also drew attention to issues surrounding the stigma of tuberculosis in the 1900s, calling it a social issue. She mentioned the topics of alcoholism, the meat and dairy supply, hereditary causes, immigration, industrial conditions and the necessity of good conditions for mothers in relation to the epidemic and how it was being handled by the public and governments. Shortt suggested that movements needed to be made in these areas in order to prevent the spread of tuberculosis and help those who already had it, rather than stigmatizing the disease.Some Social Aspects of Tuberculosis by Elizabeth Smith Shortt , WA 10, File 2046, Elizabeth Smith Shortt fonds, University of Waterloo Archives, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Her pamphlet The Social Aspects of Tuberculosis aided in the eventual founding of the Canadian Tuberculosis Society.Tribute to a Pioneer, 1949, WA10, 2249, Elizabeth Shortt Fonds, University of Waterloo Archives, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Shortt wrote a memorandum outlining the outbreaks of milk borne typhoid and the regulations that were put in place, in Ottawa and elsewhere, as a result. This memorandum explains the process of pasteurizing milk to kill unhealthy bacteria to non-certified milk and reports the process of inspectors sampling milk to be tested in a laboratory.Milk Regulations In Ottawa And Elsewhere, WA10, 1846, Elizabeth Smith Shortt fonds, University of Waterloo Archives, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. In 1914, she became the vice president of the Provincial Council of Women. In 1919, Shortt was given Life Patronship in the National Council of Women in recognition of the admiration and esteem of the Ottawa Local Council of Women. She had been the President of this council since 1911. === Work with other community organisations === Shortt was the president of the Kingston YWCA, Kingston Musical Club, and the Queen's University Alumnae Association. In her position with the Alumnae Association, she organised a fundraising campaign for a residential hall for women to be opened on the Queen's campus. The campaign opened in 1910, and by 1919 had raised $42,000. Shortt was also active in the Women's Canadian Club. === Diaries === Two collections of Shortt's diaries have been published: her diaries for the years 1872-1884, which include her experiences at medical school, were published under the title A Woman with a Purpose (University of Toronto Press, 1980); her diaries while travelling in Europe with her husband in 1911 were published as Travels and Identities: Elizabeth and Adam Shortt in Europe, 1911 (Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 2017). == Personal life == In November 1882 Shortt met Adam Shortt, a fellow Queen's student. The couple were married on December 23, 1886; they had two daughters and one son together.McLaren, Sheryl (2001).

Her works have been widely exhibited throughout the southeastern United States and are collected in museums and collections, both private and corporate, across the country. == Biography == Bradford's North Carolina roots go back to the early 1700s; the farm she lives on was bought by her great grandfather in 1890. Growing up in rural North Carolina, Elizabeth Bradford says that as a child, she felt \\"caged\\", but that in making art, she found freedom from control. While in college at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, she took a trip to the Sahara desert which influenced her appreciation for the greatness of the outdoors. Her paintings, which depict wild landscapes, are a way of breaking free for her. She raised three sons on her grandfather's farm in Mecklenburg County, NC. Her family and family history often feature prominently in her paintings, including some of the 366 paintings that make up The Painted Journal, a printed record of her 49th birthday challenge to create a painting every day for a year over the course of 1999-2000. These subjects include paintings from a lily pool made by her great grandfather to eggs gathered from her brother's chickens. == Work == Duck Pond Bradford's work, most often large landscapes painted with bright colors, displays \\"a startling and unusual sense of color\\" according to art critic and curator Carla Hanzal. She draws her inspiration from the \\"really big cathedral\\" of outdoor life, often venturing into the woods and the National parks, hiking or kayaking, to find subjects for her paintings. She calls her work \\"existential landscapes\\" and states bluntly the reason behind her paintings: \\"It's about human life and what it's like to live in the world.\\" Trees and tree roots, rocks and rivers, feature prominently in her paintings. Her canvases capture landscapes spanning from the North Carolina hills to the Everglades, Cumberland Island in Georgia, and even to international locations such as Greece and France, where she has spent time in artist residences. Lee Carol Giduz, executive director of the Blowing Rock Art and History Museum emphasizes the powerful evocation of nature in Bradford's work: \\"Her bold strokes and vibrant palette make trees grow and water flow.\\" Bradford admits the influence of painters such as Neil Welliver and Herb Jackson in her pursuit to create art, as well as the iconic Vincent Van Gogh. Additional influences include the Pattern and Decoration movement of the 1970s, late 19th century painters, and the artists of Abstract Expressionism. She began her art career drawing with colored pencils on paper before advancing to painting with gouache.

It was built by the Santa Fe Railroad as Mojave Desert rail station. Santa Fe rail workers lived in the town. Before 1931 Goffs was busy stop on the famous Route 66. when a more direct route between Needles and Amboy was built. Near by town are to the east the town of Homer, to the southwest the town of Fenner and to the north the towns of Blackburn and Purdy. From 1893 to 1902 the town was called 'Blake after Isaac Blake who constructed the Nevada Southern Railway. The Nevada Southern Railway later became part of the California Eastern Railway that operated from 1895 to 1923. To serve the travels and the Santa Fe rail workers there was a large general store, now abandoned. To teach the children of the rail workers, in 1914 a schoolhouse was built. The schoolhouse is now a mining and military museum called the Mojave Desert Heritage and Cultural Association (MDHCA).

She expressed interest in cognition and systematic psychology, and the experimentation on personality traits and its characteristics. She also did work testing the normal inferiority complex and studied systemic problems in her later work. Heidbreder earned a doctorate in psychology, and was the first Knox graduate to do so. She was a high school teacher, an instructor at the University of Minnesota, and later on became a professor at Wellesley College. Some of Heidbreder's long-lasting contributions include her involvement in the Minnesota Mechanical Abilities Test, her dissertation, An Experimental Study of Thinking, and her publication, Seven Psychologies which taught the history and seven systems of psychology. Heidbreder was an active member of the American Psychological Association (APA), the APA Division of General Psychology, and the National Research Council representing APA. She was an advocate of women’s education and of the destigmatization of stereotypes towards women in psychology. == Early life == Heidbreder was born on May 1, 1890 in Quincy, Illinois. Her parents were raised in Quincy and were German immigrants. Her father, William Henry Heidbreder, and her mother, Mathilda Emelie Meyer, had five children, Bertha, Lousie, Edna, Helen, and Ralph. In 1907, Edna graduated from Quincy High and pursued college in Galesburg, Illinois. == Education == In 1907, Heidbreder attended Knox College, in Galesburg IL, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1911. She noted that all professors, and virtually all staff, at the college were men. In her third year of study, Heidbreder took mandatory courses in psychology and philosophy. She recounted that reading Berkeley, Hume, and Kant led her to be increasingly skeptical of the validity of human knowledge, which kickstarted her interest in psychology. After graduating, she was pulled toward the fields of biology, history, philosophy, and psychology. Rather than continuing to do graduate work after graduation, Heidbreder became a high school history teacher. She credits this decision to her conservative upbringing where women got married, lived at home, and had very stereotypical occupations such as nurse or secretary. In her free time she was involved in community literacy clubs and indulged in philosophical and psychological writings. During WWI, Heidbreder undertook work related to the war effort. Several years later, without an obvious incentive, Heibreder began graduate work at the University of Wisconsin. She graduated in 1918 with a Masters in Philosophy, which at the time was blended with psychology. Her favourite course was experimental psychology, and inspired her decision to pursue a PhD in Psychology. Heidbreder attended Columbia University in New York in 1921 and earned her PhD by 1924. Her dissertation was entitled An Experimental Study of Thinking. At Columbia, she attended lectures by psychologists John B. Watson, William McDougall, and Bertrand Russell. Additionally, she took courses with R.S. Woodworth, H.L. Hollingworth, and John Dewey. Heidbreder recounts that the psychology department at Columbia was “perfectly hospitable but not encouraging to women”. She took this seriously and advocated for women to prosper in education. == Career == After completing her PhD, Heidbreder taught at the University of Minnesota from 1924 to 1934. During her time there, she researched thinking, problem solving, attainment of concepts, introversion versus extroversion, and inferiority attitudes. The chair of the psychology department urged Heidbreder to write a book on history and psychological systems. She agreed and published Seven Psychologies in 1933 which outlined American trends of psychological thinking. At the university, Heidbreder was also asked to help assemble, edit, and put together a draft of reports for The Minnesota Mechanical Ability Tests which were being developed. Her contribution was indispensable, as indicated by R.M. Elliott who said her work was “greater than that of anyone else in the group”. In 1934, Heidbreder was contacted by Wellesley College who offered her a teaching position. The college was looking for “the most distinguished woman psychologist in the country”. She published several papers in systematic psychology in her time at Wellesley, and remained there until her retirement in 1955. Despite retiring, she taught at Radcliffe College, the women-equivalent of Harvard, for six years. == Published works == ===Thinking as an Instinct (1926) === As a psychologist in the field of research, Heidbreder was interested in the notion that the mechanism of thinking could possess identical properties similar to a biological instinct. In 1926, she published a psychological review called Thinking as an Instinct, in which she compared and connected to previous works from John Dewey’s Essays in Logical Theory and How We Think, as well as William James’ The Principles of Psychology to her new functionalist school of thought around the topic of thinking. Heidbreder stated that the reason the notion of thinking has been disregarded within the field of psychology was because it was brought upon a philosophical manner rather than a testable subject that could be studied within the realm of empirical research. This led her to thoroughly examine the criteria in which thinking could be classified as scientific and nature-based, in relation to the nature-nurture debate. Her psychological review emphasized the ever-changing theories, ideas, and school of thoughts within psychology as she explored its fluidity. A topic that was once solely looked at within a metaphysical point-of-view could essentially be renewed and relooked at with just a change of direction and perception - in this case, a biological point of view. She looked towards science to explain thinking that was once viewed as a philosophical matter. In her account on the basis of thinking as an instinct, Heidbreder believed that as natural as eating could be for human survival, thinking could be regarded in a similar sense. She thought that both eating and thinking were naturally occurring without the influence of an outer or inner force to do so. Both were mindless activities in which humans engage in and essentially was something that they needed to do but there wasn’t an exact explanation behind it for doing so. She also stated that the mechanisms behind the drive of our thought process could be compared to other biological processes that humans possess; in a sense that it functioned, occurred, and goal-orientated within the same way. To build on, Heidbreder also broke down the mechanisms of thinking and compared it to the other functions that occur within the human body classified as instincts. She suggested that thinking is similar to an impulse in which there isn’t a reason behind the creation of thoughts but rather thoughts occur spontaneously and out of one’s control. This led her to believe that thinking is based on its native capacity to function. She strayed away from the philosophical thoughts of reasoning to explain occurrences and wanted to examine it within a scientific manner - it wasn't that philosophical explanations were wrong, but more so she was fascinated by her own interests. Heidbreder also credited from Dewey and James as a reference to their biological perspectives within psychology. She used their ideas explicitly to support and contrast her change in paradigm when looking at the process of thinking. Drawing from James’ idea that the need for thinking has been rooted and innately present within the upbringing of animals, including humans, Heidbreder elaborated on how thinking can relate to a variety of survival reasons. She believed that animals were, by nature, creatures that survive off of their instincts and that humans were a category of animals. She also thought that distinctiveness was key to determining if something was classified as an instinct or not. In accordance to distinctiveness, she believed that one main characteristic of an instinct is whether it provides an importance within an organism and that the behaviour of the instinct functions within a constant pattern. Thinking is one of the important characteristics that define humans and thinking occurs almost homogeneously between humans - thus, thinking is an instinct. Heidbreder hoped that her analyses would provide a new perspective on viewing the concept of thinking within psychology. She emphasized the fundamental need to start understanding phenomena within a much more diverse manner and within a multi- comparison level in order to grasp the essence of what it is, how it functions, and how it developed, rather than within a singular, structured perspective. ===Seven Psychologies (1933) === Published in 1933, Seven Psychologies was one of Edna Heidbreder's most acclaimed pieces. The book’s target audience were individuals outside of the field of psychology who were fascinated by the main theories and theorists who influenced American psychology. Heidbreder focused on seven theories/schools of thought and their associated theorists: structuralism and Edward Bradford Titchener; the psychology of William James; functionalism and the University of Chicago psychologists (including, Dewey, James Rowland Angell, and Harvey A. Carr); behaviourism and Watson; dynamic psychology and Columbia (including Woodworth); Gestalt psychology; and psychoanalysis and Sigmund Freud. Heidbreder’s approach was to examine the perspective of each theorist’s viewpoint on psychology through their different schools of thought while discussing the positives and deficiencies of each theory. Heidbreder evaluated the theories based on their ability to progress the scientific approach to psychology rather than on their accuracy. For instance, in regard to Titchener, she discussed how he wanted psychology to be researched through a metaphysical approach while removing intuition-based explanations of the mind—something he viewed as a barrier to advancing the scientific approach to psychology. Heidbreder acknowledged the limitations of her book, namely that she did not incorporate all of the key influencers at the time, such as Charles Edward Spearman, and that, for the theories she did incorporate, she did not delve into deviations, such as Carl Jung’s influence on psychoanalysis. She also discussed the potential pitfalls of her approach to writing the book, such as the illusion of cohesion within a theory and the oversimplification of concepts. However, in defending her decisions, Heidbreder reiterated that the purpose of the text was for a non-psychologist to gain a brief insight into the main sources of influences on American psychology. Heidbreder received praise for her objective approach from prominent psychologists. For instance, Kurt Koffka, one of the founders of Gestalt psychology, commented: “Throughout I was struck by the clearness, impartiality and the fairness of your exposition. You have the progress of psychology at heart, and you try to present the different and conflicting systems in such a way that psychology may derive some benefit from your stock- taking.\\" == Women's right to education == Edna Heidbreder strongly advocated for women’s rights, particularly women’s rights in learning and education. She was also aware of the discrimination and inequality women had to continuously face in science and research as it was studied predominantly by men at the time. When learning at school, she found it hard being in the field of science and psychology as she was surrounded by men, including the professors that taught her. She was observant of the school’s tolerance of women within education, and how hospitable they were to them. Heidbreder believed that women eventually came to understand that they live in a society that was more favorable to men. This included fields of study such as psychology, the sciences, and other ambitious disciplines. She believed that while women did acknowledge this reality, it did not mean they supported it; it was simply a conformity that people were expected to follow. The cause of men being favored in most academic fields, Heidbreder believed, was due to the nature of the conditions outside the workplace and disciplines. She suggested that this was because of stereotypes that people associated with gender within society. These stereotypes affected how the opposite sex see each other and how they interact with each other, accordingly. Women in non-stereotypical positions, working in male-dominant fields of science and research, was difficult to become accustomed to for some, even subconsciously, according to Heidbreder. == Committees and awards == === Affiliations with the American Psychology Association === Edna Heidbreder was involved with the American Psychology Association (APA), and provided services to them for over a decade, until her retirement in 1955. She was an active member of the Board of Directors from 1939 to 1940, and again from 1942 to 1944. In 1944, she was a representative of the APA to the National Research Council until 1947, and she started again from 1952 to 1955. In 1950, she became the president of the Division on General Psychology - now known as the Society for General Psychology. In 1967, Heidbreder was one of thirty-seven senior members honored by the Association as part of its 75th anniversary celebration. Her work on thinking and cognition, and her book Seven Psychologies were specially mentioned. === Other affiliations === Heidbreder was president of the Eastern Psychological Association (EPA), from 1943 to 1944. Apart from her, only one other woman had been in this position. She remained in the EPA for three years as a member of their Board of Directors. In 1940, Heidbreder began work as a secretary for the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). She was a secretary for seven years until she became vice-president in 1947. She also became the chairperson for the AAAS’ section on psychology, and she remained there as the chairperson until 1948. == References== Category:American psychologists Category:1980 births Category:Knox College (Illinois) alumni Category:1985 deaths Category:People from Quincy, Illinois Category:Writers from Illinois Category:Activists from Illinois Category:American women's rights activists Category:Wellesley College faculty Category:20th-century psychologists ","title":"Edna Frances Heidbreder"},{"id":"61710672","text":"The 1974–75 NCAA Division III men's ice hockey season began in November 1974 and concluded on March of the following year.

Campa-Najjar has twice been a candidate for the United States House of Representatives, first running unsuccessfully in the 2018 election against incumbent Duncan D. Hunter. Campa-Najjar announced that he would again campaign to represent California's 50th congressional district, which encompasses the northeastern segments of San Diego County, and a small section of Riverside County. He is the first Latino-Arab American to run for Congress. Running as a blue dog Democrat, Campa-Najjar has stated his intention to become an independent if elected in 2020. == Early life and education == Campa-Najjar was born in La Mesa, California. His father, Yasser Najjar, is Palestinian, and his mother, Abigail Campa, is Mexican American. In 1997, when he was eight years old, he and his family moved to the Gaza Strip. In 1998, he attended a Catholic school in the Gaza Strip. After living in Gaza for four years, he, his mother, and brother moved back to San Diego County. He said he was not \\"Arab enough in Gaza, Latino enough for the barrio, or American enough in my own country.\\" When he was 15, he worked as a janitor to help his single mother pay bills. While in high school, Campa-Najjar converted from Islam to Christianity. He considers himself to be Latino and Arab- American, and is fluent in English, Spanish, and Arabic. He attended community college at Southwestern College, and earned a dual Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy and Psychology from San Diego State University. === Family === His father Yasser Najjar is Palestinian and his mother Abigail Campa is Mexican American. His mother is a practicing Catholic. Following the killing of his parents by Israeli Special Forces for Abu Najjar's involvement in Black September and role in the 1972 Munich Massacre, Yasser Najjar and his siblings were sent to Cairo by King Hassan II of Morocco. The siblings were separated over the following years with Yasser attending school in England before immigrating to the US and obtaining American citizenship. He moved to San Diego in 1981 and earned an MBA from San Diego State University. Abigail Campa grew up in the Logan Heights neighborhood of San Diego, and she and Yasser married in the 1980s. In 1994, Yasser traveled to Gaza to work for the newly legitimized Palestinian National Authority and explore his family's roots. While working for the PNA he was seen as a moderate who advocated for peace. In his later years he was an important internal critic of Palestinian hardliners. During his time in Gaza he attempted to counteract the rising influence of Hamas. Campa-Najjar's grandfather Abu Yusuf al-Najjar has been the subject of significant controversy. In 1965, while working in Kuwait, Abu Yusuf al-Najjar founded Fatah along with Yasser Arafat and other exiled Palestinians. Abu Yusuf al-Najjar was long believed to have been affiliated with the Munich massacre. Al-Najjar was among those targeted in Israeli retribution attacks known as Operation Wrath of God. On April 9, 1973 al- Najjar and his wife were assassinated in front of their children in their home in Beirut, Lebanon by Israeli commandos including future Prime Minister Ehud Barak. In February 2018, a book published by Ronen Bergman, Rise and Kill First, challenged this historical assumption. In 2019 in response to this new information, Campa-Najjar withdrew some of the condemnations he had made against his grandfather. == Career == Campa-Najjar worked as a deputy regional field director for the Barack Obama 2012 presidential campaign. During the Obama Administration, Campa-Najjar served in the Labor Department's Office of Public Affairs for the Employment and Training Administration. He was tasked with reading and helping select the 10 letters that President Obama would read each day. He has also worked for the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce as the communications and marketing director. In this capacity, he prepared to interview then-candidate Donald Trump, who ultimately pulled out of the scheduled event, despite having earlier told Geraldo Rivera in an interview that he would attend. Following the election, NBC News and the San Diego Union-Tribune published his op ed, with a slightly different version published by The Washington Post a few days later, expressing his faith in America despite Trump's election. \\"Let's not seek comfort in the easy traps of either normalizing or demonizing the decision half of America has made. We must do what is hard, what is necessary and what is right.\\" In 2017, The Hill published another op ed by Campa-Najjar where he advocated for enhanced vetting and the empowerment of moderate Muslims to help end terrorism. He has advocated for apprenticeship programs that pay people as they learn, for example the Registered Apprenticeship job training initiative, which has bipartisan support. === 2018 congressional campaign === Campa-Najjar cited the call to service in Barack Obama's farewell address as an inspiration to run for Congress. Campa-Najjar supports environmentally sustainable developments, including solar farms. Campa-Najjar advocated for registering young people to vote, especially those who would be 18 by 2018, because they would be on the receiving end of climate change and increasing levels of indebtedness. His top domestic issue was training Americans to fill job vacancies, and his top international issue was the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and he opposed Trump's suggested wall with Mexico and travel ban. He cited economic inequality as a top issue facing California, \\"other than the severe droughts and fires.\\" The district in which he ran for office was about 35% Latino and 15% voters of Middle Eastern descent. On February 2, 2018, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported that Campa-Najjar had out-raised both the Republican incumbent, Duncan Hunter, and his Democratic rival, Josh Butner. On June 5, 2018, Campa-Najjar placed second in the nonpartisan blanket primary, earning a chance to compete against Hunter in November. Campa-Najjar credited support from Our Revolution as an important factor in the primary victory. The San Diego Union-Tribune endorsed Campa-Najjar, citing the \\"lunacy\\" of incumbent Hunter. He lost the 2018 election with 48.3% of the votes to Hunter's 51.7%.  Campaign controversies  During the campaign, the Duncan D. Hunter campaign ran an ad in which it claimed that Campa-Najjar had received support from Council on American–Islamic Relations and the Muslim Brotherhood. PolitiFact found the claim to be false. In October 2018, Duncan L. Hunter, Hunter's father, attacked Campa-Najjar as a security risk. Campa-Najjar's 2018 candidacy attracted international attention due to allegations that Muhammad Youssef al-Najjar, his paternal grandfather, was involved with the 1972 Munich massacre. He acknowledged and denounced the alleged crimes of his grandfather, who died 16 years before he was born. Campa-Najjar's campaign received a notable degree of coverage following the indictment of his opponent for stealing campaign funds for personal use. Hunter's scandal gave his campaign a boost. His loss garnered additional coverage because of the use of anti-Muslim stereotypes against a non-Muslim candidate. However, Campa-Najjar said that he did not blame bigotry for his defeat. === 2020 congressional campaign === In 2019, Campa-Najjar announced that he would run for the same seat again in 2020. He announced his candidacy on Twitter a day after filing his paperwork with the FEC. He stated that his 2020 campaign will run on the dual platform of economic security and national security. Campa-Najjar said that for this election he will make a more concerted effort to reach out to conservative voters, especially veterans. Initially characterized as a progressive during his 2018 run, Campa-Najjar has since walked back his support of Medicare For All and a Green New Deal, calling the latter \\"impractical\\". Under election rules in California, the top two vote-getters in the March 3, 2020, primary, regardless of party affiliation, will later face each other in the general election. Campa-Najjar placed first in the primary, and will face a November runoff election against Republican former Congressman Darrell Issa. Polls show a competitive election in the 50th district, which The San Diego Union-Tribune described as \\"a statistical dead heat\\". == References == ==External links== *Ammar Campa-Najjar for Congress campaign website * Category:1989 births Category:American political candidates Category:American politicians of Mexican descent Category:American politicians of Palestinian descent Category:California Democrats Category:Candidates in the 2018 United States elections Category:Converts to Christianity from Islam Category:Living people Category:People from La Mesa, California Category:People from San Diego County, California Category:People from the Gaza Strip Category:Politicians from San Diego Category:San Diego State University alumni Category:Candidates in the 2020 United States elections ","title":"Ammar Campa-Najjar"},{"id":"61710730","text":"Noapara () is a major town and municipality in Jessore District in the division of Khulna, Bangladesh.

It operates primarily in the US state of Ohio and is the Family Policy Council (a Focus on the Family affiliate organization) for that state, with branches in Indiana, Wisconsin, and Kentucky. CCV was designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center from 2015 to 2017 because CCV vilified LGBT people as categorically destructive to society and families. ==History== === 1983 founding === Citizens for Community Values was founded by Jerry Kirk in 1983 as an anti-obscenity organization. The organization's first aim was that the Cincinnati City Council would ban the Playboy Channel from local cable television. CCV opposed \\"the growing impact of the Playboy philosophy upon America\\" which members described as \\"the philosophy that the ultimate good is pleasure and happiness for the individual.\\" In the 1980s and 1990s CCV organized hundreds of people to attend city council meetings in Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana urging city governments to outlaw pornographic movies from video stores. === 1990 Mapplethorpe censorship === CCV gained national attention for prosecuting the Contemporary Arts Center of Cincinnati in 1990; an unsuccessful attempt to censor an exhibition of photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe. Mapplethorpe's work included homoerotic images. According to Smithsonian Magazine, this was the first time in American history that a museum was taken to court on criminal charges for an exhibition. \\"Citizens for Community Values launched a publicity and letter-writing campaign against the show\\" in addition to the criminal prosecution, resulting in \\"thousands of letters demanding the exhibition be cancelled and that funding be pulled from the Fine Arts Fund (an umbrella campaign to raise funds for eight cultural organizations in the city).\\" === 1991 presidency of Phil Burress === In 1991 CCV of Ohio became officially affiliated with Focus on the Family, and the Wisconsin branch became affiliated with American Family Association. Phil Burress, a self-described former \\"porn addict\\", became head of the organization in 1991. Saying that his addiction made him unable to safely consume pornography, Burress's wife examined pornographic movies and magazines on her husband's behalf, writing summaries for him so that he could speak about them to legislators and prosecutors. Burress lead legislative efforts against pornographic movies available in hotel rooms, dedicating a budget of over one million dollars. CCV created a consumer website to rate hotels as \\"clean\\" or \\"dirty\\" depending on if the hotel made adult movies available. Ohio pornographer Larry Flynt, opposing CCV, commented \\"when you check into a hotel room and order up a movie, it doesn't have any effect on Phil Burress.\\" CCV also fought to remove works from libraries that Burress considered indecent, such as The Advocate and other LGBT publications. In 2001 John Ashcroft, then United States Attorney General, agreed to a meeting with \\"representatives of about a dozen anti-porn groups\\" organized by Burress and CCV. CCV would end up disappointed in Ashcroft, complaining that the Justice Department prosecuted only extreme pornography creators while \\"we have not seen one major Internet provider busted.\\" === 2004 opposition to LGBT rights === CCV spearheaded the successful 2004 effort to make gay marriage unconstitutional in Ohio. This ban would be challenged in 2013 by James Obergerfell of Cincinnati, leading to the court case Obergefell v. Hodges which would legalize gay marriage throughout the United States. Community activists in 2004 sought to repeal a part of the Cincinnati city charter that prohibited the city from offering employment protection to people \\"because of homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation.\\" CCV opposed the repeal, which CCV head Phil Burress described as \\"anti- religious bias.\\" The repeal passed with tri-partisan support. === 2007 restrictions on strip clubs === Approximately 50 strippers, calling themselves Dancers for Democracy, showed up at the Ohio House of Representatives in 2007 to oppose restrictions on strip clubs drafted by CCV. Charity Fickisen, a dancer who spoke at a Columbus news conference, said \\"This is America, where consenting adults should be able to do what they want, as long as no one is getting hurt.\\" Most dancers are young women with children who use their wages to pay for college, according to Fickisen. The law restricting strips clubs passed in the Ohio legislature, so Ohio strippers canvassed the streets to gather the quarter million signatures needed to put the law on hold and onto the November 2007 ballot. CCV successfully disputed the validity of the signatures Dancers for Democracy had gathered; the referendum to undo the law did not appear on the ballot. Famous stripper Stormy Daniels was charged under this law in 2018 because she touched undercover detectives posing as customers. === Recent history === In 2019 the Ohio House introduced a non- binding resolution backed by CCV to declare pornography a public health hazard, saying that \\"the #MeToo movement has exposed how dangerous and harmful it is.\\" == Issues == Citizens for Community Values has described its mission as: \\"Seeking to eliminate all activities that debase individuals by catering to that which is obscene, pornographic, or indecent.\\" To this end they lobby to prohibit movies, artwork, dance, and writing with sexual content, particularly if connected to homosexuality, and to prohibit publications connected to LGBT social movements. The organization lists support of \\"Free Speech\\" as a \\"Core Issue for a Thriving Ohio\\" in spite of their extensive censorship efforts. CCV opposes legal same-sex marriage and LGBT employment protections. They also oppose gay-straight alliances and student support groups in schools, saying that \\"the 'safe school' message of these organizations is nothing more than a deceptive ploy.\\" ==Board of directors== The board of directors for Citizens for Community Values of Ohio includes: *Joseph L. Trauth, Jr., CCV Chairman and senior partner at Keating Muething & Klekamp law firm in Cincinnati *Alex Tornero, Vice Chairman and Republican political consultant *Sally Alspaugh, Director of Estate Giving at Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden *Ken Taylor, president of Caterpillar Inc. Ohio *Seth Morgan, Ohio politician *David Myhal, Ohio lobbyist for debt collection firms ==Hate group designation== The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) designated CCV as a hate group in 2015 because of anti-LGBT statements on the CCV website, such as \\"homosexual behavior is unhealthy and destructive to the individual, to families, and thus to communities and to society as a whole.\\" SPLC defines a hate group as an organization with \\"beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics.\\" CCV removed these statements from their website 2017. ==References== Category:Anti-pornography movements Category:Focus on the Family Category:Christian organizations established in 1983 Category:American Christian political organizations Category:Censorship of pornography Category:Obscenity controversies in art Category:Conservative organizations in the United States ","title":"Citizens for Community Values"},{"id":"61710734","text":"The Deninu Kųę́ First Nation is a Dene First Nations band government in the Northwest Territories.

The two families remained unknown to one another for nearly thirty years, until Cicero's parents, Frank, Sr. and Mary, met while working at the nearby LaMantia Brothers produce house. They courted and privately wed in early 1935 over the opposition of their families, due to religious and cultural (northern/southern Italy) differences. Cicero, Jr. and his siblings, James and Nancy, were raised in his mother's Protestant faith; his family's unique history served as the springboard and subject of his first book. After his family moved to suburban Western Springs, Frank, Jr. became the first in his family to go to high school or college, attending Lyons Township High School in La Grange and Amherst College in Massachusetts (1953–4), before transferring to Wheaton College in Illinois, where he earned a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science (1957). After marrying Jan (née Pickett) Cicero in 1959, Cicero enrolled at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, where he earned a Master in Public Affairs degree in 1962. That fall, they returned to Chicago and Cicero attended the University of Chicago Law School (J.D., 1965), where he was chosen for the Board of Editors of the Law Review and selected for the Order of the Coif.University of Chicago Law School. \\"Alumni News,\\" Chicago Unbound, The University of Chicago Law School Record, Spring 2012, p. 44.The Art Institute of Chicago, Artists Oral History Archive, Jan Cicero.

In the initial 1984 court decision, Amoco was found liable, however Cicero succeeded in having Astilleros also found responsible, and in limiting damages based on incompetent clean-up efforts.

She first came into the public eye anonymously after she was sexually assaulted on the campus of Stanford University in 2015 by Brock Allen Turner. The victim impact statement she wrote and read at her assailant's sentencing hearing the following year went viral after it was published online by Buzzfeed, and was read 11 million times within four days. Miller was referred to as Emily Doe in court documents and in media reports until September 2019, when she relinquished her anonymity and released her memoir Know My Name which won the 2019 National Book Critics Circle Award in the Autobiography category. She is credited with sparking national discussion in the United States about the treatment of sexual assault cases and victims by college campuses and court systems. She is also a public speaker. ==Early life== Chanel Miller was born in 1992 in Palo Alto, California, the elder of two daughters of a Chinese mother and an American father. Her mother emigrated from China to become a writer and her father is a retired therapist. She attended the University of California, Santa Barbara's College of Creative Studies where she graduated with a degree in literature in 2014. ==2015 assault and victim impact statement== On the evening of January 17, 2015, Miller accompanied her sister to a Kappa Alpha fraternity party at Stanford University; later that night, two Stanford graduate students found Miller lying on the ground behind a dumpster with another Stanford student, 19-year-old Brock Turner, on top of her. Miller was unconscious, with alcohol in her system. When Turner tried to flee, he was caught and held down on the ground by the other two men as they waited for police to arrive. Turner was arrested and indicted on five felony sexual assault charges, to which he pleaded not guilty. In 2016, he was convicted of three of these charges and was sentenced to six months' imprisonment—a sentence which sparked public outrage due to its leniency. Sentencing judge Aaron Persky was recalled two years later. The 7,137-word-long victim impact statement by Miller, who was referred to in court documents and media reports as \\"Emily Doe\\" for the sake of her anonymity, was published by Buzzfeed on June 3, 2016, the day after Turner was sentenced, and was reprinted in other major news outlets such as The New York Times. The victim impact statement was read 11 million times in four days after it was published, going viral. ==Know My Name== In September 2019, Miller relinquished her anonymity. She was interviewed on 60 Minutes, where she was reunited with the two Swedish graduate students who had stopped her assailant. Miller wrote a memoir entitled Know My Name, which was published by Viking Books, became a best-seller. It was named one of the top ten books of 2019 by The Washington Post and was nominated for Best Memoir & Autobiography at the 2019 Goodreads Choice Awards. The New York Times also selected Know My Name for its \\"100 Notable Books of 2019.\\" ==Artwork== In 2020, a mural drawn by Miller appeared in the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco. The mural, which is long and tall, shows three vignettes of a cartoon figure, and the phrases \\"I was\\", \\"I am\\", and \\"I will be\\". The museum is closed to the public due to COVID-19, though the mural is visible through the windows facing the street. == Legacy == Miller's story and the legal case \\"sparked a nationwide discussion about rape on college campuses and how survivors were not being heard\\", and \\"became part of the intense debates around rape, sexism and sexual misconduct over the past years,\\" including the Me Too movement. On November 1, 2016, Glamour named Miller a woman of the year for \\"changing the conversation about sexual assault forever\\", citing that her impact statement had been read over 11 million times. Miller attended the award ceremony anonymously. In November 2019, after the publication of her book, Miller attended Glamour's award ceremony again, where she was again recognized as a Woman of the Year. She delivered a poem on stage, in which she advocated for the well-being of sexual assault survivors. She was listed as an influential person in Time's 2019 100 Next list. ==Publications== * Know My Name (2019) == References == == External links == * * Victim Impact Statement as Published by Buzzfeed Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century American women writers Category:American writers of Chinese descent Category:American women of Chinese descent Category:American victims of crime Category:Sexual abuse victim advocates Category:University of California, Santa Barbara alumni Category:Writers from San Francisco Category:Writers from Palo Alto, California Category:American women non- fiction writers Category:American women memoirists ","title":"Chanel Miller"},{"id":"61710771","text":"opened in Chūō-ku, Ōsaka, Japan in 2001.

Following shoulder surgery in August 2015, he sat out the 2015 season. Over those three seasons, he accumulated 89 solo tackles, 39 assisted tackles, one sack, and three interceptions, returning one for a touchdown. He was also featured on punt and kick returns, recording 40 kick returns for a 26.3-yard average with two touchdowns and 19 punt returns for a 10.0-yard average.

Only three prototypes were built and only two of them flew. ==Design and development== After Vladimir Petlyakov's death in January 1942 Vladimir Mikhailovich Myasishchev continued the development of the Petlyakov Pe-2, beginning with the DB-108. DB stood for long range bomber and 108 was a NKVD, rather than design bureau, number. The three prototypes were identified by their designer's initials, VM. All three had the same basic layout. Their cantilever wings were mid-mounted and had rectangular panels between roots and engines, with radiators in their leading edges. The engines were mounted ahead of the leading edges in long fairings that also housed the main landing gear. The oil radiators were nearby in the leading edges of the outer wing panels which tapered strongly to semi-elliptical tips and had about 5° dihedral. Their fuselages were oval in cross-section and tapered rearwards to pointed extremities. Each had a glazed or semi-glazed nose and a cockpit, under raised, multi-part glazing, placed ahead of the leading edge. At the rear tetragonal plan, mid-mounted tailplanes with marked dihedral carried vertical endplate fins which, with their rudders, were roughly oval in profile. The trailing edges of broad chord elevators were slightly curved, with inboard trim tabs. A retractable tailwheel was positioned just ahead of the tailplane leading edge. The first prototype, the VM-16, was crewed by just a pilot and navigator/gunner/bomb-aimer, seated alongside but facing rearwards. He remotely operated a calibre tail gun from this position but went into the semi-glazed nose for bombing. Development concentrated on increasing defensive armament. The ground-tested but unflown second prototype, the VM-17, added another crew member to operate its four guns. It was eventually modified into the Myasishchyev VB-109, described briefly below. The final prototype, the VM-18, had a 16% increase in span and 10% in length, with a fourth crew member in an extended rear cockpit to operate its guns, one in his cockpit and two more in remotely operated dorsal and ventral barbettes. There was also a forward firing gun. The VM-16 was first flown on 30 December 1944. The VM-17 was not flown until late 1945, after modification into the VB-109; the VM-18 was flown in 1946, though flight tests were not completed before programme cancellation. ==Variants== Data from Russian Aircraft 1875-1995 ;VM-16: Two- seater.

The Xixime are noted for their reported practice of cannibalism and resistance to Spanish colonization in the form of the Xixime Rebellion of 1610. == Language == The Xixime spoke Xixime, a poorly documented, now-extinct Uto-Aztecan language. Dialects of Xixime included Hine and Hume (to the north and south of the Xixime territory, respectively). The exact classification of the language is unknown although it may belong to the Taracahitic branch. == Cannibalism == A considerable amount of the scholarship and media attention devoted to the Xixime has focused on the group's reported practice of cannibalism. While a variety colonial Spanish accounts of the Xixime report the culture engaged in frequent, ritual consumption of enemy peoples, the historical accuracy of the allegations is disputed. A number of historians including Susan M. Deeds apply theories developed by Gananath Obeyesekere on Aztec sacrifice to suggest that the practice of cannibalism was \\"exaggerated or contrived\\" by the Xixime to intimidate their Spanish enemies. In 2011 José Luis Punzo argued that newly discovered bones from Cueva del Mague, Durango constituted proof of the practice, citing evidence of \\"boiling and defleshing.\\" == Relationship with the Spanish == === Impressions === Conquistador Nuño de Guzmán first documented the existence of the Xixime via reports collected by scouts during a 1530 expedition. In comparison with their neighbors, the Xiximes were regarded as relatively civilized by the Spanish given their urban settlements and stone buildings. === Xixime Rebellion of 1610 === Map of approximate Xixime and Acaxee territories Despite initially tolerating the presence of Spanish missions in neighboring territories, the Xiximes, in 1610, began organizing violent resistance to colonial incursions. The Xiximes solicited help from the Acaxees (their northern neighbors and historical enemies) and Tepehuán arguing that Jesuit churches were \\"temples of disease\\" and that destroying them would bring immortality. In response to Acaxee unwillingness to cooperate in anti-Spanish rebellion, the Xiximes began organizing attacks on Acaxee villages. Francisco de Urdiñola To fend off the attacks, the Acaxee requested protection from the Spanish. In response, Francisco de Urdiñola attempted to secure peace through diplomatic means, though such efforts were spurned by the Xiximes. Aided by 200 Spanish soldiers and 1,100 indigenous allies, Urdiñola attempted to quell the Acaxee-led. By October, the surrender of key rebel leaders had effectively ended the uprising. === Tepehuán Revolt === The Tepehuán Revolt of 1616, which proved significantly harder to contain than the Xixime Rebellion, enjoyed widespread Xixime support. == References == Category:Indigenous peoples of Aridoamerica Category:Indigenous peoples in Mexico Category:Extinct ethnic groups Category:Cannibalism in North America ","title":"Xiximes"},{"id":"61711147","text":"The following is a list of Rhode Island Rams football seasons. ==Seasons== ==References== Rhode Island ","title":"List of Rhode Island Rams football seasons"},{"id":"61711149","text":"Mary Gonzaga Grace (February 22, 1812 – October 8, 1897), born Anne Grace, was an American religious sister, a member of the Sisters of Charity order based in Emmitsburg, Maryland. She was longtime executive at the St. Joseph's Orphan Asylum in Philadelphia, and during the American Civil War she was Superioress at the Satterlee Hospital in the same city. == Early life == Anne Grace was born February 22, 1812, in Baltimore, Maryland. Her father died in 1814, and her mother died in 1816; the orphaned Anne Grace was taken in by a Roman Catholic family and baptized \\"Agnes Mary Grace\\". In 1822, ten-year-old Agnes was enrolled as a student at St. Joseph's Valley, a school run by the Sisters of Charity. There she marked her First Communion as \\"Ann Grace\\" and her Confirmation as \\"Mary Joseph Grace\\" in 1823. == Sisters of Charity == By 1826, Grace had decided to pursue a religious life in the Sisters of Charity. She received the order's \\"candidate's cap\\" in 1827, as \\"Sister Gonzaga\\". She taught school in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, with two fellow sisters; while in Harrisburg in 1830, she took her vows, committing to life in the order. Months later, she was assigned to serve at St. Joseph's orphanage in Philadelphia. She was still with the orphanage in 1836 when they moved to a new location in the city. In 1843, Grace became superioress at the orphanage. In 1844, she was reassigned to the Sisters of Charity house in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, and in 1845 reassigned again, to New Orleans. She returned to St. Joseph's orphanage in Philadelphia in 1851. By that time, the Sisters of Charity in Maryland had united with the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul. Sister Mary Gonzaga stayed at the latter order's mother house in Paris from 1855 to 1856, to work on the details of that union. She was back to Philadelphia in 1857. == During the Civil War == During the American Civil War, from 1862 to 1865, Sister Mary Gonzaga Grace worked at Satterlee Army Hospital in Philadelphia, in charge of the Sisters of Charity who staffed the hospital's wards and cared for tens of thousands of wounded and dying soldiers. She kept a diary of her wartime work, including a smallpox outbreak at Satterlee in 1865. She was remembered fondly by veterans after the war as a \\"ministering angel\\" and a calm presence. \\"In her demise there passed out of this life a woman of boundless charity, whose ministrations among thousands of Union and Confederate soldiers contributed a note of beauty to the many harassing details of the war,\\" remarked Rhode Island congressman Ambrose Kennedy in the Congressional Record in 1918. == Later years and legacy == After the war, Sister Mary Gonzaga continued running the St. Joseph's orphanage. She marked her fiftieth year in religious life there in 1877. She was blind in her last years and broke her hip in 1896. She was said to be the oldest living member of the Sisters of Charity before she died at St. Joseph's on October 8, 1897, aged 85 years. Her funeral was attended by many, including several prominent Catholic clergy. The Gonzaga Memorial Orphans' Asylum in Germantown was named for her patron saint in 1898 and opened in 1899. One of her former students, poet Eleanor C. Donnelly, wrote a book-length biography of Sister Mary Gonzaga in 1900, as a fundraiser for the work of the new orphanage. == References == == External links == * Lou Baldwin, \\"Ladies first – Daughters of Charity mark 200 years in city\\" CatholicPhilly.com (October 7, 2014).

The Attorney General, Article 40(3) and Article 41 of the Constitution of Ireland were cited as the basis for a claim to marital privacy. ===United States=== Under the old common law, judges insisted that a husband had a legal prerogative to beat his wife. This changed during the Reconstruction Era, when judges instead spoke of a \\"curtain\\" protecting marital privacy, that should not be disturbed by the courts except in extreme cases. Reva Siegel notes, \\"Jurists reasoning in this discourse of 'affective privacy' progressively abandoned tropes of hierarchy and began to employ tropes of interiority to describe the marriage relationship, justifying the new regime of common law immunity rules in languages that invoked the feelings and spaces of domesticity.\\" In State v. Oliver, for example, the court ruled, \\"If no permanent injury has been inflicted, nor malice, cruelty nor dangerous violence shown by the husband, it is better to draw the curtain, shut out the public gaze, and leave the parties to forget and forgive.\\" Likewise, in State v. Rhodes, the court found:https://la.utexas.edu/users/jmciver/357L/61NC453.html Marital privacy was recognized in Justice Harlan's dissent in Poe v. Ullman, arguing against \\"the intrusion of the whole machinery of the criminal law into the very heart of marital privacy requiring husband and wife to render account before a criminal tribunal of their uses of that intimacy\\". These views were accepted by the majority in Griswold v. Connecticut, in which Justice Douglas wrote, \\"Would we allow the police to search the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives? The very idea is repulsive to the notions of privacy surrounding the marriage relationship.\\" Justice Goldberg's concurrence expressed similar sentiments. According to Robert P. George and David L. Tubbs of the National Review, after Griswold, \\"the Supreme Court soon transformed the 'right to privacy' (the reference to marriage quickly disappeared) into a powerful tool for making public policy.\\" In contrast to the earlier opinions, in Eisenstadt v. Baird, Roe v. Wade, Doe v. Bolton, and Planned Parenthood of Missouri v. Danforth, the privacy rights of the individual woman were emphasized. However, in Doe v. Commonwealth's Attorney and Cotner v. Henry, heterosexual married couples were held to have the right to engage in sodomy that homosexuals, or unmarried couples, respectively, were prohibited from having. (Homosexual sodomy was legalized, though, in 2003 by Lawrence v. Texas.) In Roe v. Wade, the court ruled that the Loving v.

The film is based on the 1917 novel The Abandoned Room by Charles Wadsworth Camp and was adapted by Violet Clark. The film starred Olive Tell and James W. Morrison, and featured Mario Majeroni, Ivo Dawson, and Floyd Buckley. The film is currently lost. == Plot == An old and wealth recluse named Silas Blackburn (Mario Majeroni) lives in his mansion and is cared for by his long-time butler as well as his ward, Katherine (Olive Tell). During a stormy night, Katherine finds Silas extremely agitated and nervous. The old man accuses Katharine of colluding with his wastrel grandson, Robert (James W. Morrison), to steal his money. Katharine denies his allegations and declares any romance between her and Robert long dead, but Silas threatens to remove her from his will. Katherine retreats to her room but is unable to sleep. She eventually goes back to find Silas and sees him about to retire in an abandoned room. Katharine begs Silas not to spend the night in the room because it had not been used since three generations of Blackburns died sleeping there. Silas shrugs off her concern saying that he is too afraid to sleep anywhere else. Katharine leaves Silas and returns to her room. Later that night, a restless Katherine returns with the butler and finds Silas dead with a pin-like wound at the base of his skull. The two conclude the old man was murdered. All while this is happening, Robert is drinking heavily at an actress's apartment. Carlos Paredes (Ivo Dawson), a family friend, urges him to sober up and go to his grandfather's home where he has an appointment. Unable to convince Robert to leave, Carlos departs alone while the young man remains with Maria (Peggy Parr), the actress. Robert wakes up the next morning in a derelict farmhouse near his uncle's mansion. While Robert pulls himself together, a detective and coroner, Dr. Groome (Charles McKay) arrive at the mansion to investigate Silas's murder. The detective sharply interrogates Katherine and identifies Robert as the prime suspect. Just then, a disheveled Robert appears at the door and is questioned about his activities during the previous night. Robert explains that he was with Maria all night, but Carlos refused to support his alibi. All the people present begin to wonder if Robert had something to do with his grandfather's death. Even Robert, who cannot remember how he ended up in the farmhouse, questions his own innocence. The detective continues his investigation and cannot understand how the murder was committed in the abandoned room with Silas securely locked inside. He decides to sleep in the room. Just before he retires to the room, he boasts that he will have enough evidence to arrest the killer in the morning. The detective is found dead in the room the following morning. A few days later, after Silas is buried, a new detective is brought in to investigate what has grown into a double homicide. Meanwhile, Katherine learns that Carlos has been secretly communicating with Maria. She also learns that the two are planning a clandestine meeting, so she decides to spy on them. Robert spots Katherine skulking through the woods and begins wondering if she killed Silas. He keeps his suspicions to himself and announces to everyone that he has decided to spend the night in the abandoned room to uncover the truth behind the murders. Instead of sleeping in the abandoned room, Robert conceals himself near a window and keeps watch over the bed. Late in the night, he sees a hand reaching through the wall at the head of the bed. Rushing forward, he seizes the arm and discovers it belongs to Katharine, who had entered the room through a secret door. Robert accuses her of the murders, but she protests and scolds him for believing she would have anything to do with such a crime. The next night, Silas is found sitting in his favorite chair in front of the fireplace. He refuses to explain where he has been and scoffs at the suggestion that he was ever dead at all. Confusion ensues and the coroner suggests they excavated Silas's grave. When this is done, the casket is found to be empty. Suddenly, Maria arrives at the Blackburn mansion. At the sight of the actress, Silas draws a pistol from his jacket and shoots himself. More confusion ensues, but the butler begins to tell a story that made sense of what just occurred. The butler explains that Silas had a twin brother in South America. At some point, Silas had stolen a vast sum of money from his twin and fled. The butler confessed that the twin had come to the house the night of Silas's death, and threatened to expose the old man as a thief and fraud. He recounted that the brothers finally agreed that the twin should stay overnight in the abandoned room to settle his feud with Silas the following morning. While Silas was at the door plotting his next move, Katherine had arrived and interrupted his scheming. He had intended to kill his twin and hide the body, but he was forced to let the body be mistaken for his own after he told Katherine that he was spending the night in the abandoned room. The butler continues by explaining that Maria, the actress, was actually the twin's daughter, and that she had known that either her uncle or father was murdered. The reason she had been communicating with Carlos (who was also her secret lover) was that she wanted to find out if her was father was dead. Silas, the butler concludes, had killed himself because he feared Maria would expose him. The mystery now revealed, Robert promises to mend his way and rekindles his romance with Katharine. == Cast == * Olive Tell as Katherine * James W. Morrison as Robert Blackburn * Mario Majeroni as Silas Backburn * Ivo Dawson as Carlos Paredes * Charles McKay as Dr. Groome * Gordon Hamilton as Robinson * Peggy Parr as Mario (Note: While the Peggy Parr's character is referred to as \\"Maria,\\" the film credits and press-book misspelled the character's name as \\"Mario.\\" ) * George S. Stevens as Jenkins * Floyd Buckley as Howells == Production == Love Without Question was the first production of Jans Pictures, Inc. The young company produced its films at Peerless Picture Studios in Fort Lee, New Jersey, and released them through States' Rights. It was also one of C. Wadsworth Camp (father of writer Madeleine L'Engle) and James W. Morrison's first works since returning from the front lines of World War I. During production of the film, Herman F. Jans and Fred C. Backer traveled throughout the western and southern United States securing contracts with film brokers and theaters to show their first movie. Production of the film completed on March 13, 1920. == Release == Still with Olive Tell and James W. Morrison in the American film Love Without Question (1920), from an ad on page 4356 of the May 22, 1920 Motion Picture News. It premiered at the Strand Theater in New York City on March 24, 1920. The film was heavily promoted in a 23-page spread in the Motion Picture News. Frank Backer, the general manager of Jans Pictures, was pleased with its reception. He reported that within six weeks of its release the film \\"had sold its territorial rights throughout the entire world except for 11% of the United States,\\" adding that it marked \\"a new record for rapid selling of territorial rights on a States' Rights production.\\" The movie's producers advised theaters showing Love Without Question to decorate their lobbies like the film's abandoned room. They also urged them to place a wax figure of Silas on a bed with a sinister wax hand holding a hat pin above his head. Furthermore, a woman wearing a veil and black cloak should walk around mysteriously and scurry away when approached by movie-goers. == Reception == The film received positive reviews from critics. Joshua Lowe (writing as \\"Jolo\\") of Variety called the film \\"an intensely absorbing mystery yarn, fairly reeking with suspensive interest,\\" although he thought the ending was \\"disappointing and commonplace.\\" He noted that Tell, an established Broadway star, was underutilized and had \\"relatively little to do but look pretty and 'emote' occasionally.\\" Agnes Smith of the New York Telegraph also reviewed the film positively, writing \\"It is a plot with many twists and turns and director Rolfe did his very best to give it the proper sort of spooky atmosphere. He has succeeded very well and there are several excellent 'scares' in the picture.\\" == References == Category:Silent films Category:1920 films Category:American mystery films Category:Lost American films Category:American films Category:1920 lost films Category:1920s mystery films ","title":"Love Without Question"},{"id":"61711276","text":"Katrina Wan Ka Kai (; born 8 March 1988) is a snooker player from Hong Kong.

The blaze was reported on Wednesday, September 4, 2019 and immediately expanded in size over its several days of burning. The fire actively threatened homes from Genesee Valley to Antelope Road. Areas of the Plumas National Forest remain closed. ==Events== Early in the afternoon of Wednesday, September 4, a fire was reported burning south of the Flournoy Bridge in Genesee Valley. First responders estimated the size of the fire to be roughly between 3 and 5 acres, however, burning with a critical rate of spread due to strong and erratic winds. By late evening of that day, the fire was over 750 acres in size as the community of Genesee Valley was placed under a mandatory evacuation order. On Thursday, September 5, firefighters were reportedly making good progress as the fire was at 5% containment with 850 acres burned. However, later in the day, downdraft winds from late afternoon thunderstorms caused spotting ahead of the fireline which expanded the burn area to encompass up to . By Friday, September 6, fire activity had picked up significantly as further erratic, unpredictable winds and dry conditions lead the advancing fireline further out of Plumas National Forest towards the northeast spurring new voluntary evacuations of structures below Forest Road 26N11. The fire, originally burning Friday morning, had exploded to well over acres by Friday night due to the severe weather conditions, sending up a massive smoke column that was reportedly seen from as far as Reno. The fire was then over acres in size by Saturday morning as containment remained at 0%. On September 10, the Walker Fire had grown to and was 12 percent contained. The Lassen County Fairground evacuation center was closed that morning. The majority of residential evacuation orders were lifted, except the Murdock Crossing and Stoney areas. The next evening, the fire continued to grow, but was 28 percent contained. Crews extended dozer lines and handlines to expand the containment. Structural defense was put in place for buildings at Murdock Crossing and mop up continued at Antelope Lake, Round Mountain and the eastern side of the fire. However, by the morning of September 14, the fire had expanded to and was 97 percent contained. ==Evacuations and closures== Select areas of Plumas National Forest were closed, specifically within the Mt. Hough and Beckwourth Ranger Districts. Road closures included : Janesville Grade, Genesee Valley Road at the Flournoy Bridge, Antelope Lake Road from the Flournoy Bridge to Antelope Dam, and beginning at the Flournoy Bridge turnoff, and 111 Beckwourth-Genesee road through the fire area. Highway 395 remained open to the public. The Antelope Lake Road is still closed as of 5/22/2020. ==Impact== Communities along Highway 395 from Thunder Mountain Road (Wales Canyon) to the Laufman Grade (Old Highway 59), including the communities of Murdock Crossing, Stoney, Milford and Brockman Canyon, were under mandatory evacuation. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 California wildfires Category:September 2019 events in the United States Category:Wildfires in Plumas County, California ","title":"Walker Fire"},{"id":"61711285","text":"Crystal L.

It grows in both New South Wales and Western Australia. ==Description== Xanthosia atkinsoniana is an erect, perennial herb growing to 60 cm high. It is sparsely hairy, becoming smooth with age. The flowering stems are almost leafless. The leaves (on a petiole of length 2–12 cm) mostly occur at the base of the plant, with the leaf-blade being 2–4 cm by 1.5–4 cm. They are dissected in threes with the segments often being divided again, and the lower surfaces have sparse stellate hairs. The umbels are 16–36-flowered, and on a stout peduncle up to 40 cm long. The white bracteoles are like petals and 3–8 mm long. The sepals are about 1–1.6 mm long, and the white to pinkish petals are about 1.5 mm long, white to pinkish. The disc-like enlargement of the base of the style (the stylopodium) is hairy. The fruits are 1.8–2.7 mm long and split into 9-ribbed mericarps. In New South Wales it flowers from September to April. In Western Australia, it flowers from October to December, or January to April. ==Taxonomy and naming== Xanthosia atkinsonia was described in 1861 by Ferdinand von Mueller. The specific epithet, atkinsoniana, honours Louisa Atkinson who collected the type specimen: \\"In montibus coeruleis Novae Austro- Cambriae prope amnem Grose stirpem detexerunt L. Atkinson et W.

Upon graduation from medical school, he conitnued working in New York and was appointed as \\"Medical Superintendent at the Madison Street Medical Mission[New York City] under the supervision of the Methodist Episcopal Church.\\" As a result of his work with the M.E. Church in New York City, Hall met his future wife, Rosetta Sherwood, who also applied to serve in the mission alongside Hall. Both Sherwood and Hall dedicated their professional life to mission work, serving in Korea starting on October 10, 1890, for Rosetta, and December 15, 1891, for William James. During his three year stay in Korea, Hall greatly expanded the Methodist Mission, providing medical, emotional and spiritual care for Korean soldiers and Pyongyang residents during the First Sino-Japanese War. Hall was a victim of political transgressions, and ultimately died of typhus on November 24, 1894, while tending to wounded men on the banks of the Taedong River. == Early life == Hall was born in a log cabin in Glen Buell, Ontario, Canada – a remote area between Ottawa and Toronto – on January 16, 1860. As the eldest of five children, he blossomed and showed great leadership skills from a young age. He devoted his life to the Presbyterian Church beginning at fourteen years old, but always suffered from poor health. Concerned that his life, and its impact, would be cut short due to consumption, Hall left the Glen Buell schoolhouse to pursue an early career in carpentry at the age of seventeen. == Education == After suffering from a severe fever due to consumption, Hall left the manual trades of carpentry to return to school and pursue academics, ultimately gaining acceptance to Athens High School in 1880. Hall received his Teaching Certificate in 1883 and entered Medical College at Queens University in Kingston, Ontario in 1885. During his time at Queens College, Hall became inspired by a presentation by his future volunteer leader, Reverend John Forman of India, and decided to pursue a missionary path. His training included attending the Dwight L. Moody Summer School in Northfield, Massachusetts. Here, Hall met George D. Dowknott, the Director of the International Medical Missionary Society, who offered training in New York City to become a medical missionary. Hall traveled to New York City in 1887, where he finished and graduated from medical school at Bellevue Hospital Medical College in 1889. Hall was appointed as Medical Superintendent at the Madison Street Medical Mission (under the province of the Methodist Episcopal Church). == Personal life == Hall was very religious based on his Presbyterian upbringing and his personal and early call to service with the Church. Hall's work was claimed to be a \\"romance of grace\\" by J. Summer Stone who was on the Board of Managers of the Medical Mission on Madison Street. === Marriage and family === Hall met his wife and fellow medical missionary, Rosetta Sherwood, through their work at the Madison Street Medical Mission at the Roosevelt Street Dispensary in New York City. Hall was initially placed by the Methodist Episcopal Church of Canada to the China Mission. Sherwood applied for a job through a separate missionary board in 1887 in China under Hall's supervision but was instead placed in Korea to replace another missionary in 1890. Hall then applied and was granted reassginment to Korea. The two were ultimately married when they \\"met in the foreign field\\" when Hall was placed in Korea in 1891; they took their vows of matrimony in June 1892 in Korea while serving in Asia for three years of mission work. They had one son Sherwood Hall (b.1893), a medical missionary to Korea and India, and a daughter Edith Margaret Hall born after his death (b.1895, d.1898). == Service == After receiving his initial \\"call\\" during his college years in Ontario and Northfield, MA, his official call to Korean Missionary Service came on September 19, 1891. As noted later, Hall claimed this later summons to be both a call \\"from the Canadian Mission Board and from the Heavens above.\\" Hall traveled by ship from Vancouver in November 19, 1891, for an arduous five weeks, to arrive in Pyongyang in December 1891. Upon arrival, he worked in Seoul for four months prior to his departure for the interior of Korea. To work in the interior, Hall was required to walk 700 miles with other missionaries to his proposed station as well as for itinerant service. In August 1892, he was posted to the Pyongyang Circuit mission. He was \\"the first missionary appointed to exclusive work in the interior\\" and he went without his spouse. Upon landing in Pyongyang, Hall's two helpers as well as the Korean individuals who rented him his lodging and medical supplies, were thrown in jail by the Korean governor's police. The Canadian was released through discussion with the Korean Missionary Service.Through political appeasement and the provision of medical care to the Korean Governor, Hall gradually made peace with the Korean people and eventually ended the seal of the Hermit Kingdom. During his three year stay in Korea, Hall greatly expanded the Methodist Mission, provided care for Korean soldiers and Pyongyang residents during the First Sino-Japanese War. He was victim of multiple political transgressions. During his last trip on the Pyongyang circuit, Hall cared for numerous war injuries. He, however, contracted malaria and had to return to Seoul. On his return, he contracted typhus a Japanese transport while tending to wounded men on the banks of the Taedong River. He died of typhus on November 24, 1894, after arriving back in Seoul. == Legacy == Hall never left Asia, neither returning to his homeland of Canada or his adopted United States. His rugged spirit and intense, religious devotion for helping and healing the people of Korea kept him in his new \\"motherland\\" of only three short years. His legacy lived on through his influential missionary wife, Rosetta, as well as the Hall Memorial Hospital, Pyongyang, Korea which was started with funds initially raised by Hall.

In regimental formation, the grenadier company constituted the right flank of the regiment and the light infantry constituted the left flank, with the other companies of the regiment referred as \\"battalion companies\\" or \\"centre companies\\". They were still referred to as flank companies even if they were detached from their regiment. James, Charles A New and Enlarged Military Dictionary: Volume 1 T. Egerton, 1810 Frequently flank companies of several regiments were placed together in their own unit. Major-General Sir Isaac Brock stated ==Grenadiers== The grenadier company comprised the tallest soldiers in the regiment and when in combat were used as assault troops McGuire, Thomas J. The Philadelphia Campaign: Brandywine and the Fall of Philadelphia Stackpole Books, 27 Oct 2006, though by the end of the 18th Century the hand grenade had fell out of use, the grenadiers still wore a special headgear such as a bearskin or mitre originally designed to facilitate the effective throwing of hand grenades. In 1667 France created the first Grenadiers by having four or five of them in each company. By 1670 separate Grenadier companies were created with the British Army having Grenadiers in 1685 James, Charles A New and Enlarged Military Dictionary, Volume 1 T. Egerton, 1810. Frederick William I of Prussia was renown for recruiting the tallest soldiers in Europe for his grenadier regiment with various European monarchs presenting their tallest young males as gifts for Frederick. p. 171 Hall, Stephen S.

Greek-Dutch singer Stefania was internally selected by the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) with the song \\"Supergirl\\", written by Dimitris Kontopoulos, Sharon Vaughn, Pavlos Manolis, Anastasios Rammos, Diverno and Gabriel Russell. Due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Europe, the contest was cancelled in mid-March. ERT has stated Stefania will instead represent Greece at the 2021 contest. == Background == Prior to the 2020 contest, Greece had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest forty times since their debut in . The nation has won the contest once, in with the song \\"My Number One\\" performed by Helena Paparizou. Following the introduction of semi-finals for the 2004 contest, Greece managed to qualify for the final with each of their entries for several years. Between 2004 and 2013, the nation achieved nine top ten placements in the final. To this point, Greece in with Argo's \\"Utopian Land\\" failed to qualify from the semi-finals for the first time ever, being absent from the final for the first time since 2000, marking Greece's worst result at the contest. In the 2018 contest, Greece failed to qualify for the second time with Yianna Terzi and the song \\"Oniro mou\\" finishing 14th in the semi-final. Greece returned to the final in 2019 with Katerine Duska and the song \\"Better Love\\", placing 21st with 74 points. The Greek national broadcaster, Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT), broadcasts the event within Greece and organises the selection process for the nation's entry. ERT had been in charge of Greece's participation in the contest since their debut in 1974 until 2013, when the broadcaster was shut down by a government directive and replaced with the interim Dimosia Tileorasi (DT) and later by the New Hellenic Radio, Internet and Television (NERIT) broadcaster. On 28 April 2015, a legislative proposal that resulted in the renaming of NERIT to ERT was approved and signed into law by the Hellenic Parliament; ERT began broadcasting once again on 11 June 2015. The new ERT then confirmed their intentions to participate at the 2016 Eurovision Song Contest on 28 August 2015. The Greek broadcaster has used various methods to select the nation's entry in the past, such as internal selections and televised national finals to choose the performer, song or both to compete at Eurovision. In early September 2019, Maria Koufopoulou, ERT's Director of International Relations, confirmed that the country would participate in the 2020 contest. She also stated that they were still evaluating how to select the entry and were in discussions with local fan clubs to solicit ideas. ==Before Eurovision== Greek-Dutch performer Stefania was selected as the entrant for Greece. === Internal selection === Similar to 2019, ERT announced that the Greek entry would be selected internally by the broadcaster. On 15 January, it revealed the names of the people who would comprise the jury panel involved with the selection of the entrant. The jury consisted of music composer and ERT board member Dimitris Papadimitriou, music producer Petros Adam, Yiorgos Markakis, music producer Yiannis Petridis, and ERT's Director of International Relations Maria Koufopoulou. Prior the official announcement of the performer, Star Channel reported that seven acts had been shortlisted to represent Greece in Rotterdam, including Irini Papadopoulou, Stefania, Ian Stratis, and the boy band One. They reported that the jury would listen to the songs submitted by each act before selecting their preferred entry. On 3 February 2020 during an ERT newscast, Stefania was announced as the Greek entrant with the song \\"Supergirl\\". The song was written by Dimitris Kontopoulos, Sharon Vaughn, and the production team ARCADE (Pavlos Manolis, Anastasios Rammos, Diverno, Gabriel Russell). Born in the Netherlands to a family with Greek ancestry, Stefania had previously represented the Netherlands at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2016 as part of the group Kisses, placing eighth. The song and accompanying music video were released the following month on 1 March 2020, during the premiere of ERT's new program Eurovision Song Contest - Final Countdown, hosted by Mihalis Marinos. The music video was directed by Konstantinos Karydas. == At Eurovision == The Eurovision Song Contest 2020 was originally scheduled to take place at Rotterdam Ahoy in Rotterdam, Netherlands and consist of two semi-finals on 12 and 14 May, and a final on 16 May 2020. According to Eurovision rules, each country, except the host nation and the \\"Big 5\\" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom), would have been required to qualify from one of two semi-finals to compete for the final; the top ten countries from each semi- final would have progressed to the final. On 28 January 2020, the allocation draw was held at Rotterdam City Hall, placing Greece into the first half of the second semi-final. Fokas Evangelinos was hired to organise the staging and choreography for the performance. However, due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Europe, the contest was cancelled on 18 March 2020. The EBU announced soon after that entries intended for 2020 would not be eligible for the following year, though each broadcaster would be able to send either their 2020 representative or a new one. ERT responded that its intention was to continue its cooperation with Stefania for the next contest in 2021. === Alternative song contests === Some of the broadcasters scheduled to take part in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 organised alternative competitions. Austria's ORF broadcast Der kleine Song Contest in April 2020, which saw every entry being assigned to one of three semi-finals. A jury consisting of ten singers that had represented Austria at Eurovision before was hired to rank each song; the best-placed entry in each semi-final advanced to the final round. In the third semi-final on 18 April, Greece placed seventh in a field of 13 participants, achieving 51 points. Greece's song also partook in Sveriges Television's Sveriges 12:a in May, and was qualified for the final round, finishing 15th. ==References== Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 Category:Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest Eurovision ","title":"Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020"},{"id":"61711456","text":"Wołodko is a Polish-language surname.

Authorities suspect that she was killed in a violent attack at her home in New Canaan. Her husband, Fotis Dulos, and his girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, were arrested on charges of tampering with evidence and hindering prosecution in connection with the disappearance. Later, the two along with Fotis' attorney Kent Mawhinney faced additional charges related to Jennifer's murder. Police suspect that Fotis Dulos had been lying in wait for Jennifer and attacked her when she arrived at her home, after dropping her children off at school. Police allege that Fotis Dulos and Troconis went to Hartford, Connecticut, to dispose of garbage bags containing items with Jennifer Dulos' blood on them on the night that Jennifer disappeared. Police further allege that Mawhinney participated in the murder conspiracy. Jennifer and Fotis Dulos were in the midst of both a contentious divorce and child-custody proceedings. == Background == Jennifer Farber Dulos (born September 27, 1968) was born in New York City to Gloria Ortenberg and Hilliard Farber, a banker and philanthropist. She had an older sister, Melissa Irene Farber. Jennifer’s maternal aunt and uncle, Elizabeth Claiborne and Arthur Ortenberg, founded the fashion company Liz Claiborne Inc. Jennifer graduated from Brown University in 1990, and later earned a master's degree in writing from New York University Tisch School of the Arts. Jennifer was a stay-at-home mother; she also was a writer for Patch.com and ran her own blog. Fotis Dulos (August 6, 1967 January 30, 2020) was born in Turkey, and grew up in Athens, Greece. He moved to the United States in 1986. He graduated from Brown University in 1989, and later earned an MBA in finance from Columbia Business School. He married Hilary Vanessa Aldama, also a Brown University graduate, in Athens, Greece, in June 2000. The marriage lasted 4 years, and they were divorced on July 12, 2004. In 2004, Dulos founded Fore Group Inc., a luxury home developer company in Connecticut. Dulos started emailing Farber, whom he'd also met at Brown University, whilst still with his first wife. Dulos and Farber married just over a month after Dulos' divorce, on August 28, 2004, in Manhattan and moved to Farmington, Connecticut. They had five children together, including two sets of twins, all named after Greek Orthodox saints three sons: Petros, Theodore, and Christiane; and two daughters: Constantine and Cleopatra Noelle. In a blog post on March 12, 2012, Jennifer said of the marriage, “I wish I were a strong person and that confrontation did not both scare and appall me.” After the slow break down of their marriage, in which Jennifer claimed Fotis was living an increasingly independent life, she filed for divorce on June 20, 2017, at Superior Court in Stamford, Connecticut. In the same month she started renting a house in New Canaan, Connecticut, about 70 miles southwest of Farmington, and moved there with her five children. In divorce court documents she wrote, “I know that filing for divorce, and filing this motion will enrage him. I know he will retaliate by trying to harm me in some way.” She also stated she believed he was having an affair with his colleague, Michelle Troconis from South America. Jennifer also alleged that Fotis had a threatened to kidnap their children if she did not agree to his terms in the divorce settlement, and that he had bought a gun that year, to which Fotis denied and claimed he bought the gun legally for home security. Both parents filed numerous motions claiming that the other was disparaging them. Despite Jennifer requesting an emergency order of custody, they were given temporary joint custody of their children until the end of the divorce proceedings. In January 2018, Jennifer again requested an emergency order of custody. The judge found that Fotis had broken numerous court orders. In March 2018 the judge ruled that Jennifer Dulos have sole physical custody of the children, and both parents would share joint legal custody. Fotis was granted supervised visitation and monitored phone calls. In February 2018, after Jennifer’s father's death, Gloria Farber, Jennifer’s mother, sued Fotis Dulos for unpaid loans. She claimed he owed them $1.7 million loaned to him by his father-in- law Hilliard Farber. == Disappearance == Jennifer Dulos was last seen at around 8:00 am on May 24, 2019, when she dropped her children off at New Canaan Country School and then at 8:05 am on a neighbor’s security camera returning home. The same day, she missed two doctor appointments that she had scheduled for 11:00 am and 1:00 pm in New York City. Later that evening, at around 7:00 pm, two of her friends, including Lauren Almeida, her children’s nanny, reported her missing after they failed to get in contact with her. Family and friends of Jennifer stated that it would be out of character for her to leave her home on her own without telling anyone. Almeida, who had arrived at the house at 11:30 am that day, later told detectives she was surprised to see Dulos' Range Rover in the garage because she had planned to take it to her doctors appointments, instead of her Chevrolet Suburban, which was no where to be seen. When detectives arrived at the house, they found blood splatter on the floor, door and a wall in the garage, as well as on the exterior of the Range Rover parked in the garage. Blood was also found in the kitchen. DNA tests revealed most of the blood to be Jennifer’s, apart from blood on the kitchen faucet, a mixture belonging to both her and her husband, Fotis Dulos. Police also found other evidence of Jennifer being the victim of a serious assault. Jennifer’s black Chevrolet Suburban had been captured on the neighbor’s security camera leaving her home at around 10:25 am that morning. Fotis Dulos was believed to be the one driving the victim’s vehicle, carrying the body of Jennifer and other items associated with the probable cleanup. That same evening around 7:30 pm, Fotis Dulos and his girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, were captured on video dumping garbage bags in 30 bins in Hartford, Connecticut. The trash bags were found to contain various pieces of bloodied clothing, as well as blood stained cleaning items. The blood was determined to be that of Jennifer Dulos. Fotis’ DNA was found on the inside of a glove in one of the trash bags, and on one of the trash bags. Jennifer's Chevrolet Suburban was later found on the road side, near Waveny Park in New Canaan, just over 3 miles away from her home. At the time Jennifer went missing, she and her husband were estranged and still engaged in a tumultuous divorce. They were also involved in the ongoing contentious child-custody proceedings. Police searched numerous properties and around Farmington, near Fotis Dulos’ home, and in Fairfield County, around Jennifer’s home without success. Investigators believe Fotis arrived by bike to her home, due to tire marks found and other evidence. They believe he was lying in wait for his estranged wife to return home, and killed her in the garage when she returned from dropping their kids at school. Helicopters were used to look for signs of Jennifer, as well as canine units on the grounds and divers used to search the local ponds. There has been no activity on her credit cards and no calls made from her cell phone as of May 24. == Initial arrests == On June 1, 2019, Fotis Dulos and Michelle Troconis were arrested at a hotel in Avon, Connecticut, and charged with tampering with evidence and hindering prosecution. Not enough evidence existed at that time to warrant any more severe charges. The Dulos' five children, then aged between 8 and 13, moved to live with Jennifer's mother, Gloria Farber, in New York City, to whom a judge granted temporary custody. Fotis Dulos hired attorney Norm Pattis to represent him. In an interview, prior to being hired by Fotis, Pattis had appeared convinced that Jennifer was dead. Dulos and Troconis both pleaded not guilty to the charges. In September 2019, both Dulos and Troconis were again arrested for tampering with evidence. They both pleaded not guilty. Dulos appeared in court on October 4 to seek a dismissal of the charges against him. The judge said he would review arguments by the defense and prosecution. In late October, it was reported Troconis, along with her 10-year-old daughter, had moved out of the $5 million home in Farmington, Connecticut, that they had been living in with Fotis. == 2020 arrests == On January 7, 2020, Fotis Dulos was arrested at his home by Connecticut State Police and charged with capital murder, murder, and kidnapping in relation to the disappearance of Jennifer. His former girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, was also arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit murder. Fotis Dulos's friend and former attorney, Kent Douglas Mawhinney (often misreported as Mahwinney), was also detained on January 7 and charged with conspiracy to commit murder. Despite these arrests, the body of Jennifer is yet to be found. Following the arrests, court documents released highlighted the backgrounds of both Dulos and Mawhinney. Mawhinney became estranged from his wife after being accused of spousal rape. His wife went to South Windsor police and told authorities that she feared Fotis and Mawhinney were working together to kill her. After Jennifer disappeared, a shallow grave was discovered at a secluded property that Mawhinney owned, filled with two bags of lime and a blue tarp. Authorities and K9 dogs discovered the grave in August 2019, but no body was found in the grave, and said items were found to have been removed. Jennifer's family issued a statement after the arrests; “Although we are relieved that the wait for these charges is over, for us, there is no sense of closure. Nothing can bring Jennifer back. We miss her every day and will forever mourn her loss.” On January 8 Dulos' bond was set at $6 million. He was released the following day and was due to return to court on February 28, 2020. In a statement issued in May 2020, Michelle Troconis, said it was a \\"mistake\\" to have trusted Dulos. However she still maintained that she does not know what happened to Jennifer, or of her whereabouts. Troconis, who is out on bail, is next scheduled to appear in court on August 6, 2020 to face the charges. Mawhinney is being held in lieu of $2 million bond and is scheduled to appear in court on September 3, 2020. == Fotis Dulos suicide == While out on bail, Dulos failed to appear at Stamford court house on January 28, 2020, for an emergency bond hearing. He was found in an unresponsive state by police at his $5 million home in Farmington, Connecticut, after intentionally poisoning himself with carbon monoxide by running a vacuum-cleaner hose from the exhaust pipe of his SUV into the interior of the car while it was parked in the garage. Initially, it was reported by some news outlets that Dulos had been found dead, but responders had performed CPR and restored a faint pulse. They transported him by ambulance to UConn Medical Center in Farmington, Connecticut, and from there he was airlifted to Jacobi Medical Center in The Bronx, New York, to undergo hyperbaric oxygen therapy. His five children visited him at the medical center before he was taken off life support. This marked the first time they had seen their father since he was accused of murdering their mother. Dulos was pronounced dead at Jacobi Medical Center on January 30, 2020. He was 52 years old. He left a suicide note in his car that read \\"I refuse to spend even an hour more in jail for something I had NOTHING to do with\\". In the police report, it states that Dulos' new girlfriend, Anna Curry, was at his home the morning of his suicide. They had planned to drive to the court house together, but Dulos said that they should drive separately. On the way to the court house Curry received a call from Dulos' attorney, asking where his client was. She told him that they were driving separately, but the lawyer informed her that Dulos' GPS tracker showed that he was still at home, at which point Curry said that she knew Fotis must have done something to harm himself and asked his lawyer to call 911. == Media == A documentary, Vanished in New Canaan: An ID Mystery, premiered on ID Discovery on June 1, 2020. Investigation Discovery attempts to put pieces together of Dulos' disappearance. The documentary gives an insight into how Jennifer and her estranged husband met at Brown University and started a family. A group of experts and witnesses dissect the events of the case. == See also == * Crime in Connecticut * List of people who disappeared mysteriously: post-1970 * Murder conviction without a body == References == == External links == * New Canaan mom Jennifer Dulos is missing: Here’s what we know Category:2010s missing person cases Category:2019 in Connecticut Category:Crimes in Connecticut Category:May 2019 events in the United States Category:Missing person cases in Connecticut Category:New Canaan, Connecticut ","title":"Disappearance of Jennifer Dulos"},{"id":"61711696","text":"Shiekh Ubaidullah (born c. 663 AD) was a Muslim Arab saint from Medina. He is believed to be a close relative of Abu Bakr from whom Ubaidullah learnt about Islam in an environment free from desire and greed of materialism for developing his moral and spiritual beliefs. == Early life == The name Ubaidullah is an indirect Quranic name that means “little servant of Allah”. Ubaidullah is the diminutive form of the name Abdullah and is formed from Ubaid (“little servant”), -u- (“of”) and Allah (“God”). Nothing is known about the early life of the saint except his lineage which is traced to Caliph Abu Bakr, the Ist rightly guided Caliph, of whom he is believed to be in some close relation == Career == By profession, the Saint is believed to be a merchant before undertaking the holy mission to preach Islam. Tradition has it that Saint Ubaidullah, once praying in the Holy prophet's mosque in Medina fell asleep and saw a dream in which he saw Prophet Muhammad and was told by the Prophet to go to distant lands from the east of Jeddah to preach Islam to the people. He interpreted the dream as a divine vision from Allah for his salvation and the people of those distant lands, so he proceeded to Jeddah where he travelled across the ocean for accomplishing his mission. ==Preaching Islam in Lakshadweep India== On his journey his vessel capsized in a storm and he had to continue his journey by drifting on a plank till he reached Amini in AH 41 (663 AD). He started his act of preaching from Amini and was able to convert the Pondambelli family despite the initial linguistic challenges. After facing opposition there he left Amini with some of his new Muslim fellows and moved to Andrott where he got significantly high conversions. He then went to Kawaratti and Agatti, preaching there and then came back to Amini. This time unlike his first arrival in Amini, he was welcomed and via his preaching could successfully influence and convert almost the whole of population to Islam. At last stage of his life, he travelled to Andrott where he lived the rest of his life preaching and teaching. Ubaidullah never went back to his home land of Hijaz and devoted his life for dawah. Sheikh Ubaidullah advanced Islam in Lakshadweep (now in India) Islands by delivering sermons before the islanders. == Dealth and Legacy == Apparently, the saint died at Andrott Island with his remains buried in Juma Mosque. Juma Mosque, one of the top attractions in Lakshadweep is said to have been built during his time. His tiring work was rewarded as 97% of the population in Lakshadweep are Muslims at present. ==References== Category:Muslim saints Category:600s births Category:Year of death unknown Category:Muslim missionaries ","title":"Sheikh Ubaidullah"},{"id":"61711734","text":"Ralph Henry Gabriel (April 29, 1890 – April 25, 1987) was an American historian. He held the Sterling Professor Emeritus of History at Yale University and was the founding father of the American Studies Association. ==Early life and education== Gabriel was born on April 29, 1890, in Reading, New York, to parents Cleveland and Alta Monroe Gabriel. He earned his Bachelor of Arts, Masters of Arts and Ph.D. at Yale University before serving in the U.S. Army Infantry during World War I. ==Career== Gabriel joined the faculty of Yale in 1915. Simultaneously, Gabriel was hired as a general editor of The Pageant of America, an eventual 15-volume series of pictorial history of the development of the United States. In 1931, he collaborated with Stanley Thomas Williams, an English professor, to teach a course entitled \\"American Thought and Civilization.\\" He claimed the course \\"stressed the systematic study of the history of the viewpoints of American writers, scholars, statesmen and reformers.\\" Afterwards, Gabriel served as chairman of the history department from 1931 to 1934. Fellow professor William Robert Hutchison cited Gabriel as a mentor in the history department and called him a \\"perennial teacher and friend\\". In 1938, Gabriel worked alongside Mabel B. Casner, a Connecticut schoolteacher, to publish The Rise of American Democracy. A few years later, in 1940, Gabriel published The course of American democratic thought through the Ronald Press Company. Although writing as a historian, Gabriel used anthropology to examine how America's \\"climate of opinion\\" affected society. He would go on to serve as director of Yale Studies for Returning Service Men from 1944 to 1946 and lecture at the United States School of Military Government. He held the title of Larned Professor of American History from 1935 to 1948 before he was appointed to a Sterling Professor. In 1941, Gabriel published a biography on Elias Boudinot through the University of Oklahoma Press. In 1946, Gabriel founded a new department at Yale, entitled the American Studies Department, and later went on to be a founding father of the American Studies Association. However, Gabriel would end up resigning from the American Studies Department in protest during the Cold War. Gabriel was upset that Yale accepted a $500,000 donation on the condition the department focus on \\"the fundamental principles of American freedom in the field of politics and economics in order to combat the meaning of foreign philosophies\\". As he remained a professor at Yale, Gabriel achieved the rank of a professor emeritus in 1958 after he retired that June. In 1958, Gabriel served as a committee member on the US National Commission for UNESCO and was a US delegate at the UNESCO conference in Paris. During his lengthy tenure at Yale, Gabriel also served as the editor of the Library of Congress Series in American Civilization. ==Awards and honors== In 1958, Gabriel was the recipient of an honorary degree from Williams College. In 1966, Gabriel was awarded a DeVane Medal from Yale's Phi Beta Kappa chapter. In 1975, he was the recipient of the Wilbur Cross Medal for \\"distinguished achievements in scholarship, teaching, academic administration, and public service\\". Every year, the American Studies Association awards the Ralph Henry Gabriel Prize to the best doctoral dissertation in American studies, ethnic studies, or women's studies. ==Personal life== Gabriel married Mary Christine Davis in 1917 and they had three children together. ==Selected publications== The following is a list of selected publications: *Elias Boudinot, Cherokee & his America (1941) *The Rise of American Democracy (1951) *The course of American democratic thought: an intellectual history since 1815 (1956) *Traditional values in American life (1960) *American values: continuity and change (1974) == References == == External links == * Ralph Henry Gabriel papers (MS 228).

Dennis collection of stereoscopic views The cemetery was established on February 28, 1856 and is located directly across Ridge Avenue from Laurel Hill Cemetery. The property was originally part of the colonial estate of Robert Ralston named Mount Peace. Another portion of the estate was purchased by the Oddfellows organization for Mount Peace Cemetery. John Notman, the architect of Laurel Hill Cemetery's Italianate gatehouse was hired to design a larger and grander gatehouse for Mount Vernon Cemetery which was completed in 1858. Gardel Memorial in 2006 In 1864, the Gardel Memorial was added to Mount Vernon. It is a memorial to Julia Hawks Gardel, who died in 1859 while traveling in Syria. Her husband, Bertrand Gardel, commissioned Philadelphia architect Napoleon LeBrun and Belgian sculptor Guillaume Geefs to create a 25-foot pyramid made of sandstone, marble and imported granite. The front of the pyramid is adorned with large marble statues which represent the continents of Asia, Europe and Africa to depict Julia's love of travel. Two statues above the pyramid door depict Hope and Faith holding a carved relief of Julia. The statue atop the pyramid represents America surrounded by emblems of the physical sciences. The memorial cost $36,000 which is the equivalent of about $2 million in current dollars. Bertrand Gardel died in 1895 and is interred in the vault beneath the memorial with his wife. Gardel Memorial from Robert N. Dennis collection of stereoscopic views In 1867, the Second Presbyterian Church burial ground on Arch Street was closed and 2,500 bodies were reinterred at Mount Vernon many from the 1700s including several Revolutionary War heroes. The Drew family plot at Mount Vernon contains generations of the Barrymore family. John Barrymore left in his will that he wished to be buried in the Drew family plot but was originally interred in Calvary Cemetery in Los Angeles, California. In 1980, his son John Drew Barrymore had his father's remains removed from the family mausoleum, cremated and reinterred in Mount Vernon Cemetery. His grave was unmarked until 1992, when fans had a stone installed which had engraved upon it, \\"Alas poor Yorick\\" in a reference to his stage performance of Hamlet. The cemetery is not abandoned, however no plots have been sold since 1968 and it has become heavily overgrown. Mount Vernon is not open to the public. The owner requires an appointment to be made for visitations 24 hours in advance and only for people who have a family plot in the cemetery and know the location. ==Notable burials== *John Barrymore (1882-1942), stage, screen and radio actor *Maurice Barrymore (1849-1905), stage actor *George C.

This is due to the comparatively low temperatures, the filter systems, and physical design. The composition of what is produced is complex. The main toxicants found in the emissions of cigarette smoke (i.e., tar, nicotine, carbonyl compounds, and nitrosamines) are also found in the emissions of these products in varying concentrations. The aerosol generated contains levels of nicotine and cancer- causing chemicals that are comparable to regular cigarettes. The emissions contained 84% of the nicotine found in regular cigarettes. The available research on the mainstream and exhaled aerosol generated by these products is limited, as of 2018. They do not generate side-stream emissions. The exhaled aerosol is highly volatile because it is made up of liquid particles that evaporate quickly. The particle size of their emissions have a median aerodynamic diameter that is somewhat bigger than those found in cigarette smoke. There is a lack of agreement on the composition of the emissions in the documented literature, as of 2018. These products, however, still pose health risks. Lower levels of harmful emissions has been shown, but lowering the risk to the smoker who transitions to using them has not been shown, as of 2018. As a result of the various types of heated tobacco products, the characteristics and effects for each type will be different. Since the 1960s heated tobacco products were in development by tobacco companies. Safer heated tobacco products that deliver nicotine but limit emissions of tar or carbon monoxide (CO) is a half-century old idea, which had been unsuccessfully market-tested since 1988, first as Premier by the RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company (RJR) and later as Eclipse (RJR) and Accord Philip Morris International (PMI). Various heated products were reintroduced to the market, as of 2018. == Introduction == Heated tobacco products are electronic devices that heat processed tobacco to supposedly deliver an aerosol with fewer toxicants than in cigarette smoke. Commercially available heated tobacco systems like glo (produced by British American Tobacco (BAT)) or IQOS (Philip Morris International (PMI)) include a charger, a holder and tobacco sticks, plugs or capsules. Inserted into the holder, tobacco sticks are heated with an electronically controlled heating element. Other products, like iFuse from BAT or Ploom Tech from Japan Tobacco (JT), produce aerosol from a non-tobacco source and pass it through a tobacco plug to absorb flavor and nicotine. Heated tobacco products aim for a niche between combustible tobacco smoking and electronic cigarettes that aerosolize nicotine suspended in humectants. Since the 1960s heated tobacco products were in development by tobacco companies. Safer heated tobacco products that deliver nicotine but limit emissions of tar or carbon monoxide (CO) is a half- century old idea, which had been unsuccessfully market-tested since 1988, first as Premier by the RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company (RJR) and later as Eclipse (RJR) and Accord (PMI). As of 2018, various heated tobacco products were reintroduced to the market. Japan, where manufacturers have marketed several heated tobacco brands since 2014, has been the focal national test market, with the intention of developing global marketing strategies. According to a 2018 report, the launching of the latest incarnation of heated tobacco products is a reiteration of similar efforts in the past to use similar products to undermine tobacco control, particularly efforts that present the tobacco industry as a harm reduction partner. As of 2018, of the current heated tobacco products, IQOS was launched in several cities in Japan, Italy and Switzerland in 2014, iFuse was released in Romania in 2015 and glo and Ploom Tech were introduced to Japanese cities in 2016. Due to regulations restricting the sale of nicotine-containing e-cigarettes, Japan was a fertile market for heated tobacco producers, suggesting that the products have potential 'for explosive global growth'. By 2017, IQOS was available in 30 countries and was being considered by United States Food and Drug Administration for a reduced-risk product approval, and the UK was one of the first countries to assign a separate taxation category for heated tobacco products. == List of substances == Substances emitted exist as gases, liquid droplets, and particulate matter. *Acenaphthene *Acetaldehyde *Acrylonitrile *Acetone *Acrolein *Aerosol (vapor) *Ammonia *Aldehydes *1-Aminonaphthalene *2-Aminonaphthalene *4-Aminobiphenyl *Benzine *Benz(a)anthracene *Benzo(a)pyrene *1,3-Butadiene *Carbonyl compounds *Carbon monoxide *Cotinine *Crotonaldehyde *Ethylene oxide *Flavorings *Formaldehyde *Glycerin *Isoprene *Menthol *Nicotine *Nicotine equivalents *Nicotine derived agents *Nitric oxide *Nitrosamines **Nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone **N-nitrosonornicotine *Nitrogen oxides *o-Toluidine *Particulate metals *Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon *Pyrene *Propylene glycol *Propionaldehyde *Solanesol *Styrene *Tar (The solids in the emissions have been called nicotine-free dry particulate matter rather than tar in papers written by people related to the tobacco industry.) *Toluene *Volatile organic compounds *Water == See also == * Composition of electronic cigarette aerosol * List of heated tobacco products == References == == Bibliography == * Category:Cigarette types Category:Heated tobacco products Category:Products introduced in 2014 Category:Philip Morris brands Category:Tobacco smoke carcinogens Category:Nicotine products with harm-reduction claims Category:Electronic cigarettes ","title":"Composition of heated tobacco product emissions"},{"id":"61711802","text":"There are various types of heated tobacco products in the marketplace. Some examples include products that use tobacco sticks such as glo and IQOS, or products that use loose-leaf tobacco such as PAX and Ploom. Some use product- specific customized cigarettes. There are devices that use cannabis. Heated tobacco products usually heat up tobacco, rather than use liquids. In contrast, electronic cigarettes heat liquids that can contain nicotine. They are not e-cigarettes. They can overlap with e-cigarettes such as a combination of an e-cigarette and a heated tobacco product, for the use of tobacco or e-liquid. == Background == A wide variety of new tobacco- and smoking-related products have emerged on the market in recent years, as of 2018. Moreover, tobacco companies will keep developing new products to keep meeting the changing needs of their consumers and fulfill changing regulatory requirements. These tobacco-related products can quickly gain popularity, even before there is sufficient scientific evidence to determine their effects on the user and bystander. For instance, recently products marketed as \\"harm reduction,\\" \\"reduced risk,\\" or \\"next generation\\" products were introduced making claims of being up to 90% less harmful than traditional cigarettes, as of 2018. Even though these products seem very attractive to consumers, independent scientific research to support these claims is lacking. In addition, these products may be attractive for smokers, but may also be used by non-smokers. Besides, regardless of their own harmfulness, popular new products could also serve as a gateway to the use of tobacco or tobacco- related products. According to a 2018 report, given their potential harmful health effects, and the possibility that these products serve as a gateway to the use of more harmful products, it is important for national authorities and scientists to closely monitor product development of new tobacco and tobacco- related products. Data on product development, marketing strategies, and consumer interest in new products could help to understand potential implications for public health and guide tobacco control efforts. The World Health Organization recognizes the importance of monitoring the availability and regulation of new tobacco and tobacco-related products entering national and global markets. == Introduction == The tobacco control community is still deciding how to address the unexpected rise in popularity of e-cigarettes. However, there is another product innovation already emerging: Heated tobacco products. These products are being introduced in markets around the world by tobacco companies seeking to appeal to consumers who still demand the \\"throat- hit\\" delivered by traditional cigarettes but not by e-cigarettes. Japan has been the focal market to test the potential of heated tobacco products as a cigarette alternative, where manufacturers have marketed several heated tobacco brands nationwide, including Japan Tobacco's \\"Ploom TECH\\" device in March 2016, Philip Morris International\\"s \\"iQOS\\" device in April 2016, and British American Tobacco’s \\"glo\\" device in December 2016. As of 2017, tobacco industry leaders have predicted that heated tobacco products are poised to further displace traditional cigarette smoking and, by extension, tobacco control strategies typically framed around traditional cigarettes. == Difference between regular cigarettes, heated tobacco products, and electronic cigarettes == A regular cigarette consists primarily of tobacco leaves wrapped in cigarette paper. It may also contain a filter, chemical additives, or other components. The user lights the tip of the cigarette to burn the tobacco and inhales the smoke through the unlit end. A heated tobacco product consists of a heating source and tobacco. The tobacco may be wrapped in paper, which makes it a type of cigarette. However, the tobacco is heated to a lower temperature than a combusted cigarette to create an aerosol that the user inhales. An electronic cigarette uses an e-liquid that may contain nicotine (typically derived from the tobacco plant), glycerin, propylene glycol, flavorings, and other ingredients. The device has an electric heat source that heats the e-liquid to create an aerosol that the user inhales. alt=Three components of a heat-not-burn type product. == Functionality == There are two types of heated tobacco products currently allowed to be sold in the US, as of 2019. One product type, which has been on the US market at various times since the 1990s, uses a carbon tip wrapped in glass fibers. The user lights the carbon tip, which heats the dried tobacco inside to a temperature that does not cause the product to create ash or burn down in size. Another heated tobacco product called IQOS that recently obtained US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA} authorization in April 2019 consists of an electronic heating device and sticks made from dried tobacco wrapped in paper. The user places the stick into the electronic heating device, which pierces the stick with a glass- covered ceramic blade that heats the tobacco, creating an aerosol. alt=TCross- sectional view of a tobacco stick (tobacco sheets wrapped in paper). == Various types of heated tobacco products == There are a variety of products colloquially called heated tobacco products and heated tobacco products that do not appear to fit easily into universally agreed upon product categories. Products currently sold in global markets may function in various ways. For example, these products heat to various temperatures, can contain dry, moist, or liquid tobacco ingredients, and appear in a wide variety of shapes. For the US FDA's purposes, if a tobacco product meets the legal definition of a cigarette but the tobacco is not heated to a temperature high enough to cause combustion, the product would be currently categorized as a non-combusted cigarette and regulated as a cigarette. As of 2019, the types of heated tobacco products currently authorized for sale in the US are all non-combusted cigarettes. alt=Various types of heat-not-burn products. == Heated tobacco predecessors == *Accord *Eclipse *Heatbar *Premier. *Revo *Steam Hot One == List == alt=eTron 3T organic red, gold and menthol products. alt=Interior view of IQOS store. alt=A US Food and Drug Administration official, Priscilla Callahan-Lyon, discussing heat-not-burn products. *eTron 3T *Firefly *Firefly 2 *glo *glo iFuse *i-glo *IQOS *IQOS 2.4 *IQOS 3 *IQOS 3 Multi *iSmoke OneHitter *IUOC 2 *lil *lil Hybrid *Mok *Neocore *PAX *Pax 2 *Pax 3 *Ploom S *Ploom Tech *Ploom TECH+ *Pulze *TEEPS == See also == * Composition of heated tobacco product emissions * List of electronic cigarette and e-cigarette liquid brands * List of cigarette brands == Bibliography == * * == References == Category:Cigarette types Category:Heated tobacco products Category:Products introduced in 2014 Category:Philip Morris brands Category:Tobacco smoke carcinogens Category:Nicotine products with harm-reduction claims Category:Electronic cigarettes ","title":"List of heated tobacco products"},{"id":"61711824","text":"is the third single by Japanese idol group Hinatazaka46.

Deel 1, Malmberg, 1978, pp. 476–478 He published the Psalms of the Bible in Dutch verse and also wrote poems and songs.James Clifton, The Triumph of Truth in an Age of Confessional Conflict, in: Walter Melion, Bart Ramakers, 'Personification: Embodying Meaning and Emotion', Brill, 2016, pp 166–167 A supporter of the Calvinist cause, he fled to Aachen in 1567 when the religious persecution of Calvinists in the Low Countries intensified upon the arrival of the new governor, the Duke of Alva. Van Haecht returned to Antwerp in the early 1570s, but left his home town again after the Fall of Antwerp in 1585 as Calvinists were then forced to choose between renouncing their religious allegiance or leaving the Spanish Netherlands. ==Life== ===Early years=== Willem van Haecht was born in Antwerp around 1530 in a family of painters and engravers.Van Bruaene, Anne-Laure. Om beters wille: rederijkerskamers en de stedelijke cultuur in de Zuidelijke Nederlanden 1400–1650, Amsterdam University Press, 2008, pp. 133–134 He is believed to have trained as a draughtsman. He enjoyed a humanist education and could likely read Latin.Anke van Herk, Fabels van liefde, Amsterdam University Press, 2011, p. 52 Rhetoric enthroned, invitation to the 1561 Landjuweel Willem van Haecht was active as a cloth merchant. As early as 1552, van Haecht was affiliated with the chamber of rhetoric De Violieren, which was the most prominent chamber of rhetoric in Antwerp. It was linked to the local artists' Guild of Saint Luke and included among its members leading Antwerp sculptor and architect Cornelis Floris de Vriendt and painter Marten de Vos. Van Haecht became a factor (poet in title) of De Violieren in 1558, probably succeeding Jan van den Berghe who was ill. ===Literary career=== In May 1558, van Haecht wrote a morality play called Het spel van Scipio (The Game of Scipio), which was performed by his companions before the magistrate and other chambers of rhetoric.De liggeren en andere historische archieven der Antwerpsche sint Lucasgilde van 1453–1615, edited and published by Ph. Rombouts and Th. van Lerius, Antwerp, 1872–1876, p. 211 This play has not been preserved. In 1561 a large competition of 13 chambers of rhetoric in the Duchy of Brabant was organised by the Antwerp chamber of rhetoric De Violieren in Antwerp. The competition called 'landjuweel' in Dutch ('jewel of the land') was held at 7-year intervals between 1515 and 1541. But because of the public turmoil in the Low Countries there was an interruption of 20 years before De Violieren, which had won the last landjuweel, organised another edition of the competition. A landjuweel involved performances of drama, processions, tableaux vivants and recitations of poetry.John Cartwright, The Politics of Rhetoric: The 1561 Antwerp Landjuweel, in: Comparative Drama Comparative Drama Vol. 27, No. 1, Continental Medieval Drama (Spring 1993), pp. 54–63 An estimated 5,000 participants from twelve different cities traveled to Antwerp for the 1561 event.Jeroen Vandommele, Als in een spiegel: vrede, kennis en gemeenschap op het Antwerps Landjuweel van 1561: vrede, kennis en gemeenschap op het Antwerpse Landjuweel van 1561 (Middeleeuwse studies en bronnen, Band 132), Hilversum Verloren, 2011 Stage of the 1561 Landjuweel Van Haecht as the factor of De Violieren wrote the invitations and introductory material for the 1561 landjuweel.Mak, Jacobus Johannes, et Dirk Coigneau, De Nederlandse en Vlaamse auteurs van middeleeuwen tot heden met inbegrip van de Friese auteurs (red. Gerrit Jan van Bork et Pieter Jozias Verkruijsse), Weesp, De Haan, 1985, p. 244-245 This material was intended as a sort of mission statement for the event and gave it a political, literary and economic framing. In the 1561 competition the participating chambers were required to provide a solution for the issues of peace, knowledge and community in every part of the competition. The invitation and moralities of the competition, as well as other poetic works, were published in 1562 under the title Spelen van sinne, vol scoone moralisacien, vvtleggingen ende bediedenissen op alle loeflijcke consten with a preface by van Haecht.Spelen van sinne, vol scoone moralisacien, vvtleggingen ende bediedenissen op alle loeflijcke consten, by M. Willem Siluius, drucker der Con. Ma., 1562, at archive org The Caerte or invitation letter for the landjuweel was written by van Haecht in the form of a poem of 13 stanzas of 11 lines (rhyme scheme AABAABBCBBC) and starting and ending with the motto of De Violieren which was Vvt ionsten versaemt (gathered in a spirit of goodwill). The prologue to the actual plays written by van Haecht describes how Rhetorica has been sleeping in the protective lap of Antwerp where it was discovered by three nymphs. The first two plays performed prior to the actual start of the landjuweel were by the hand of van Haecht. The first play called Oordeel van Tmolus tusschen Apollo en Pan, deals with the mythological theme of the judgement of Midas. Midas had ruled in favour of Pan in a musical performance competition between Apollo and Pan. As punishment Apollo had transformed Midas' ears into ass' ears. Midas tried to hide his ears from god but failed to do so. Apparently, the author wanted to produce a Renaissance work, while drawing his material from classical mythology. However, in the second part of the play, it turns into medieval sotterny (farce). Van Haecht also wrote the second preliminary play that was called the Prologue in which he extolled the virtue of unity. Van Haecht also wrote the farewell piece, Oorloff oft Adieu, and the closing piece of another theatre competition held at the same time as the landjuweel referred to as haagspel. In the farewell piece, he advances the thesis that the decadence of Rome and that of other ancient empires should not be attributed to the disbelief or rejection of God, but to the decline of the arts. The emblem of the Violieren van Antwerpen for the Landjuweel The Royal Library of Belgium holds a bundle of documents referred to as the Landjuweel van Antwerpen, 1561 (catalogue number II 13.368 E (RP)).Online copy of the Landjuweel van Antwerpen, 1561 in the Royal Library of Belgium It is made up of all kinds of loose, unnumbered papers of different sizes, some printed and others handwritten. The date 1561 is incorrect, since a chorus dated to 1578 is included. This heterogeneous collection of papers, a number of which are related to the landjuweel of 1561, was likely bundled by Willem van Haecht. He added the following pieces written by himself: a chorus on Om datmen vianden moest voor vrienden houwen (Because one has to treat enemies as friends) (1576), a chorus on Godt slaet en geneest, den droeuen hy blijde maeckt (God hits and heal and makes the sad happy) and a chorus on De rijcke weet qualijck hoe daerme te moey is (The rich do not understand how tired the poor are). The last page of the bundle of papers has about 20 verses, probably from a chorus on Betrout in Godt, Hy en sal v niet verlaten (Trust in god anf he will not leave you).G. Jo Steenbergen, Refereynen en andere kleine gedichten van Willem van Haecht in: De Nieuwe Taalgids. Jaargang 42 (1949), pp. 161–134 Van Haecht produced three plays on the acts of the Apostles, which were performed by De Violieren in 1563, 1564 and 1565. In the manuscript, preserved in the Royal Library of Belgium, the plays are entitled Spel van Sinnen van dwerck der Apostelen (Morality on the Acts of the Apostles). In these plays van Haecht gives expression to his moderate Lutheran views and his interest in antiquity. In the plays van Haecht criticises the clergy and the persecution of Protestants. His moderate views based on the Augsburg Confession are clear from the fact that he distances himself from sects that were considered more radical such as the anabaptists and argues for civic unity in religious and social matters. In the plays he further shows that he rejected religious dogmatism in favor of tolerance and was opposed to the iconoclasm of certain Calvinists. According to his nephew Godevaert van Haecht the plays were liked by the general public but angered the Catholic clergy. Through these plays the chambers of rhetoric De Violieren tried to exert an influence on the religious and social conversation in Antwerp of the time.Louis Peter Grijp, Conformisten en rebellen: rederijkerscultuur in de Nederlanden (1400–1650) (red. Bart A. M. Ramakers), Amsterdam University Press, 2003, During the performance of the play some books were burned on the stage according to the stage directions.W.M.H. Hummelen, Inrichting en gebruik van het toneel in de Amsterdamse Schouwburg van 1637. Amsterdam 1967, p. 78 In 1564 van Haecht won the third prize at the competition of another chamber of rhetoric in Antwerp, the Goudbloem. He was likely the author of an untitled publication, which is usually referred to as Dry Lamentatien oft Beclaghinghen (Three Lamentations), printed in 1566 by an unknown publisher at an unknown location. A copy in the Ghent University Library is listed in the library catalogue as being the work of Laurens van Haecht Goidtsenhoven even though it is signed with the initial W.V.H.Laurens van Haecht Goidtsenhoven, Drye Lamentatien oft beclaginghen ... at the Ghent University Library Above each piece in the publication is a detailed title, in which the author calls each poem an \\"argument\\", which is consistent with the content. ===Exile and return=== Avarice, the danger of wealth, from a series on poverty and wealth With the arrival of the Duke of Alva in the Low Countries in 1567 the fairly tolerant religious climate was replaced by one of persecution of those who no longer adhered to the Catholic faith. Van Haecht fled to Aachen and subsequently to the northern Netherlands. Van Haecht returned to Antwerp in the 1670s. When, in 1578 the Lutheran congregation was restored in the city, he started openly practicing his Protestant faith again. In the same year he published engravings which represented the Lutheran doctrine of grace. The following year, his rhymed translation of the Psalms was published for the benefit of the Lutheran congregation of Antwerp. Its editions carry the privilege of two Catholic princes: the first, from 1579, that of the Archduke Mathias, and that of 1583, strangely, that of the Duke of Parma. This indicates that at the time, the followers of the Augsburg Confession in Brabant were hardly oppressed by the Reformers. The second edition also contains an appendix containing a Dutch translation of the Gloria Patris, translated in seven ways.Witsen Geysbeek, Pieter Gerardus, Biographisch anthologisch en critisch woordenboek der Nederduitsche dichters, vol. 3, HAE-IPE, C.L. Schleijer, Amsterdam, 1822, p. 1-4 Achtergrondinformatie over de vier kerkboeken in: De Psalmen Dauids(1583)–Willem van Haecht Van Haecht was a friend of the Brussels-based humanist and author Johan Baptista Houwaert. He compared Houwaert to Cicero in the opening eulogy of the Lusthof der Maechden written by Houwaert published in 1582 or 1583. In his eulogy van Haecht further states that every sensible man should recognize that Houwaert writes eloquently and excellently.Kalff, Gerrit, Geschiedenis der Nederlandsche letterkunde, vol. 3, Groningue, J.B. Wolters, 1907, p. 272-273, 278–282, 286–287, 289–290 The last record about van Haecht dates from 1583. If he was still alive in 1585, he would likely have left Antwerp again, for parts unknown, in 1585 or shortly thereafter, upon the take-over of Antwerp by the Catholics, unless he had already died. ==Poetry== He also wrote smaller poems, including some highly religious songs and choruses, some dialogues, three 'lamentations', a translation of the five lamentations of Jeremiah and arrangements of the Psalms, partly recorded in the hymnbook of the Dutch Lutheran church. He published many prints during a fairly brief period between 1577 and 1580. During this period he worked closely with the Antwerp engravers Hieronymus Wierix, Johannes Wierix and Anton Wierix the younger. Some of the prints were engraved by Hans Bol. Artists such as Maerten de Vos, Marten van Cleve and Chrispijn van den Broeck. The prints were issued as single sheets, in pairs or in the form of a series. Most of their subject matter was political and was treated in an allegorical manner. In some cases, Willem van Haecht shared the credit for conceiving and publishing some of these works with his nephew Godevaert van Haecht. ==Lyricist== Van Haecht wrote the lyrics to various songs usually of Christian inspiration. This includes the Dutch lyrics to a polyphonic song in five voices, Ghelijc den dach hem baert, diet al verclaert.{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzz4KlzG3-M Ghelijc den dach hem baert, diet al verclaert] at youtube This song was presumably composed by Hubert Waelrant for the opening play of De Violieren at the landjuweel of 1561 that van Haecht had written himself. The poem was also printed on a flying sheet with the musical notation. Van Haecht's poem Hoe salich zijn die landen that he wrote for De Violieren was set to music by Jacob Florius and was included in the Geuzenliedboek, a collection of songs of those who revolted against Spanish rule in the Low Countries.Jan Willem Bonda,, De meerstemmige Nederlandse liederen van de vijftiende en zestiende eeuw, Hilversum, Verloren, 1996, pp. 206, 216 Willem van Haecht had two songs included in the Refereynen ende liedekens van diuersche rhetoricienen vvt Brabant, Vlaenderen, Hollant, ende Zeelant: ghelesen en ghesonghen op de Corenbloeme Camere binnen Bruessele ... op de vraghe, wat dat de landen can houden in rusten?, printed by Michel van Hamont in Brussels in 1563. The song were a chorus on Den wysen Raet die de Kennis des Heere heeft (The wise counsel that the knowledge of the Lord entails) and a song that starts with the Aenhoort ghy Adams saet (Listen to Adam’s seed). A further three songs are in a collection of documents by Willem de Gortter (Royal Library of Belgium): a chorus on In Christus woort is verborghen d'eeuwich leuen (In Christ’s word is hidden the eternal life) (1563); a chorus on Eyghen liefde die elcx herte verblinden can (Self love can blind every heart) and a song which starts with Ontwecket mensch tis meer dan tijt (Wake up everyone, it's more than time).Handschrift van Willem de Gortter in the Royal Library of Belgium ==References== ==External links== * Category:1530 births Category:Flemish publishers Category:Flemish poets Category:Flemish Christian hymnwriters Category:Flemish writers (before 1830) Category:Artists from Antwerp ","title":"Willem van Haecht the Elder"},{"id":"61711937","text":"STARBRIGHT Asthma CD-ROM Game: Quest for the Code is an interactive asthma adventure game developed by Starbright.

B. Cebulski and Tom Brevoort, stating that issue will \\"shape the future of Marvel Comics into 2020 and beyond. From a single moment in the pages of the Dark Phoenix Saga to the events of Marvel Comics of today.\\" ==Premise== On New Year's Eve, a mysterious murder brings every hero to search for the killer, but the trial will lead them to unforeseen results for the Marvel Universe, especially after the identities of both the victim and killer are revealed. ==Plot== Arriving on a crime scene, where the murder victim appears to be strangled in his apartment, the Masked Raider asks Matt Murdock and Elektra Natchios for help to investigate, but Matt calls Jessica Jones instead who deduces the victim's apartment has a photo with the phrase \\"2Faced\\" written, along with a large code of numbers and a familiar star brand. Jessica calls for Carol Danvers, who delivers this information to T'Challa, who leads her to Adam Brashear. Adam deduces that \\"2Faced\\" is hiding a hexadecimal number, so Dwayne Taylor calls Richard Rider, with no avail. Therefore, the Agents of Atlas search for Amadeus Cho, who becomes the target from the public eye after talking with Bruce Banner, who has declared war against corporations like Roxxon. Johnny Blaze still hunts Mephisto in Las Vegas before finding Wong. Eddie Brock gets worried for his son Dylan who has visions of Knull. Peter Parker and Miles Morales discuss about Senator Geoffrey Patrick forbidding teenage superheroes. Teddy Altman accepts a mysterious offer at the cost of leaving Billy Kaplan. On the nation of Krakoa, Nathaniel Essex takes interest in Franklin Richards. Meanwhile, Mister Fantastic receives Adam to investigate the murder in the apartment. When a plane carrying Kiren Khanna goes haywire by its A.I. program, he and his pilot are saved by Iron Man (Arno Stark). When Adam asks him about the mysterious code, Stark deduces it is a cipher hiding a three-word message, but Adam leaves before Stark could tell him. Reed asks Jane Foster to perform an autopsy on the victim's corpse. Reed later recognizes the victim as Bel-Dann, a former Kree warrior. He also deduces the message in numbers means \\"beneath the trees\\". Reed reunites Jessica, Carol and Adam, who initially suspect the killer was Raksor, Bel-Dann's Skrull partner and former enemy. However, after learning of Bel-Dann's death, Raksor reveals the others that the mysterious message was sent directly to him and whoever killed him wants to start another war. Raksor and Bel-Dann only wanted to leave the Earth and return to their home planets once their new asset was activated. Before Raksor could tell them more about the case, his body mutates into a tree, killing him. At the end, Teddy accepts the offer of becoming the new ruler of the Kree–Skrull Alliance, adopting the mantle of \\"Dorrek VIII\\" and beginning the preparations of invading the Earth for \\"the final war\\".Incoming! #1.

The events were the result of a general strike by the Berlin working class to enforce the widely anticipated socialization of key industries, as well as the legal safeguarding of the workers' and soldiers' councils and thus the democratization of the military. The strike action was met with violence from the paramilitary Freikorps, resulting in street fighting and house-to-house fighting around the Alexanderplatz and the city of Lichtenberg. On 3 March, workers from AEG Hennigsdorf drafted a resolution for a general strike in order to enforce the so-called \\"Hamburg Points\\" that had been approved by the Reichsrat Congress in Berlin in December 1918. The strike was supported by the Communist Party of Germany and the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany. The German government, under the leadership of the Majority Social Democratic Party of Germany, responded with the imposition of a siege on Berlin and Spandau by the military on the orders of Defence Minister Gustav Noske. The Volksmarinedivision, which had previously taken a neutral role during the Spartacist Uprising, distributed weapons to the strikers and fought government troops after a member was fatally wounded. The general strike was ended on 8 March by the orders of the strike leadership led by Richard Müller. There were some concessions made by the Weimar government following negotiations with the workers' councils. However, the clashes only ended on 16 March with the lifting of the shooting order by Noske. The fighting ended, according to Noske, with more than 1,200 dead, 75 of them on the government side. Estimates from Richard Müller suggest as much as 2,000 deaths, with other estimates being as high as 3,000. There was no official count conducted by government authorities. Much of this bloodshed can be attributed to orders from Freikorps commander Waldemar Pabst that permitted the summary execution of all individuals caught with a firearm, which resulted in the killing of many civilians and war veterans who were uninvolved in the strike. Among those killed was Leo Jogiches, the personal partner of murdered revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg. The March Battles represent one of the bloodiest but largely forgotten conflicts within the revolutionary struggles in Germany after the First World War. == Background == The cause of the March Battles was rooted in the demands of the increasingly radicalized German working class. Among the popular demands was the socialization of key industries, introduction of the council system and the democratization of the military. These demands had first emerged in the November Revolution, which itself had been carried out by the working class. On 18 December 1918, the Reichsrat Congress confirmed these demands in the Hamburg Points. The January 1919 elections saw the left-wing political camp fall short of a majority, and the Majority Social Democratic Party formed a moderate coalition government known as the Weimar Coalition that encompassed itself, the liberal German Democratic Party and the conservative German Centre Party. This government proved unwilling to enforce the Hamburg Points, and the military high command actively worked against democratization and reform. The months following the election saw great labour unrest across the country, with the Spartacist Uprising and a general strike in Upper Silesia in January, a general strike in the Ruhr in February and yet another general strike in Central Germany around Halle, Merseburg, Leipzig and Erfurt from February to early March. Simultaneous were attempts to enforce council rule on a local level in Bremen, Brunswick and Munich.Broué, p. 269–271 Also notable was the presence of the \\"Republican Soldiers' Army\\" in Berlin, composed of the remnants of the Volksmarinedivision as well as other revolutionary-minded soldiers. The publicist Sebastian Haffner described this period as a \\"civil war\\" in Germany: \\"In reality, there was only one thing at stake: the existence of the workers' and soldiers' councils and thus the legitimacy of the revolution.\\" == General strike in Berlin == The workers' councils in Berlin had, since mid-February, sought to reorganize the Reichsrat Congress in order to enforce the demands of the November Revolution. The soldiers' councils sought similar goals, seeing the dominance of the Freikorps and former imperial officers over the military as a threat to democratization and reform. The Central Council, solely controlled by the MSPD and in charge of the reorganization of a new Reichsrat Congress, hesitated in addressing the demands. In the general assembly of the Berlin Workers' Council from 26–28 February, a resolution that called for the institution of the Hamburg Points and condemned the Weimar National Assembly was passed with a wide majority that included MSPD-aligned members. The outcome of the resolution as well as information about the general mood of the factory workers was telegraphed to the government in Weimar.Müller, p. 660 Although supportive of the demands, the USPD and KPD were cautious about engaging in street protests due to previous experiences with the Freikorps. Instead they believed the workers should focus on organizing in their workplaces: \\"Do not let yourselves be drawn into fresh gun-fights! Noske is waiting just for that to provoke fresh bloodshed!\\"Broué, p. 272 On February 28 delegates from AEG Hennigsdorf requested a vote on a resolution for a general strike. However, the vote would be postponed until the next meeting on 3 March. Before the conclusion of the meeting, an election was held to the Central Council in which the Independent Social Democrats won 7 seats, followed by 7 for the Majority Social Democrats, 2 for the Communists and 1 for non-left \\"Democrats\\". This gave the Independents and Communists a majority.Broué, p. 271 In the next meeting on 3 March, delegates from many large industries reported that the strike had already begun, which prompted nearly all MSPD-aligned members to support the general strike resolution in spite of the Berlin MSPD's warning against a strike in a Vorwärts article just the previous day. The final vote was decisively in favor of the call for a general strike. Several strike goals were outlined:Broué, p. 273 * Recognition of the workers' and soldiers' councils * Complete implementation of the Hamburg Points * Release of all political prisoners * Lifting of the state of siege * Arrest of all those involved in political murders * Organization of the workers' guard * Dissolution of the Freikorps * Resumption of political and economic relations with the Soviet Republic Gustav Noske, the Defence Minister at the time of the strike On the same day, the Prussian state government declared a state of siege over Berlin. Gustav Noske, the Defence Minister, was subsequently provided with extensive civil and military powers. Public demonstrations were banned by his decree along with the distribution of newspapers. Force was authorized against those infringing on the decree. From 3–4 March, violent encounters occurred between police and striking workers. The industry, commerce and transport of Berlin had largely ceased to function by 4 March. Looting of shops by strikers was reported, which was denounced by the revolutionaries. However, Noske used these incidents as a pretext to send the Freikorps into Berlin. On the same day, the Communists withdrew from the strike committee in opposition to the participation of the MSPD. In particular there was a conflict over the printing of newspapers. The printers did not initially join the strike, which allowed the MSPD newspaper, Vorwärts, to be published. The Berlin Workers' Council agreed that no newspapers should be published, but the Communists insisted that only the KPD newspaper Die Rote Fahne and USPD newspaper Die Freiheit should be published.Broué, p. 273–274Müller, p. 664 On 6 March, the fourth day of the strike, USPD delegates proposed that water, gas and electricity workers should join the strike amidst the increasingly violent situation in Berlin. The MSPD delegates opposed the extension, but were outvoted. This prompted their withdrawal from the Berlin Workers' Council and the strike committee, and the MSPD soon appealed for the strike to be called off. The MSPD's control of the Berlin Trade Union Commission proved decisive, as they too called for the strike to end. The printers were the first to return to work.Müller, p. 666Broué, p. 275–276 Attempts to negotiate a conditional end to the strike under terms drafted on 7 March proved fruitless. This prompted the resignation of Richard Müller from the strike committee, which was followed up with the unconditional cancellation of the general strike on 8 March.Müller, p. 668 == Deployment of the Freikorps == Wilhelm Reinhard, commander of the Freikorps in Lichtenbergalt= Violence between government forces and striking workers began almost immediately after the approval of the general strike resolution on 3 March. The publishing office for Die Rote Fahne was raided and destroyed by government forces that same day. In the afternoon and evening, many workers gathered in the Scheunenviertel and Alexanderplatz, and clashes began with police. This was followed with the looting of shops and the storming of police stations for weaponry. These actions were denounced by the strike leadership as being staged by \\"provocateurs\\". Even the MSPD newspaper, Vorwärts, stressed that such actions were not those of the strikers.Broué, p. 274 On 4 March government troops invaded the city. On the side of the counterrevolutionaries was five formations: the Freikorps Reinhard, Freikorps Lützow, Freikorps Hülsen, Guards Cavalry Rifle Division and German Protection Division. Walther von Lüttwitz was in command of all Freikorps in Berlin and the surrounding area, while Wilhelm Reinhard commanded the Freikorps Reinhard and Waldemar Pabst, known as a perpetrator of the murders of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, commanded the Guards Cavalry Rifle Division. In Spandau, revolutionary soldiers guarding a weapons depot were fired on and eventually disarmed. The news of the incident inflamed the anger of the strikers. A unit of Freikorps tried to drive through a crowd, and the commanding officer was intercepted by the strikers. Freikorps forces soon intervened with armored cars and tanks and fired on the crowd, resulting in a massacre. In an attempt to calm the situation, Richard Müller publicly disassociated the strike effort from those engaging in \\"trouble-making\\". The Communists warned in a leaflet against engaging in putschism. The situation grew more volatile on 5 March after Freikorps forces attacked a detachment from the Volksmarinedivision that had attempted to negotiate the occupation of the police headquarters. As the delegation left the negotiations, a sailor, Rudolf Klöppel, was fatally shot in the back. The incident shifted the opinion of the sailors, who distributed weapons to strikers and began to actively fight the Freikorps. Barricades were erected in the Alexanderplatz and the most brutal fighting of the strike commenced. The Freikorps attacked with planes, tanks, armored cars, artillery, mortars and machine guns. The Communists denounced the Volksmarinedivision under the context of their previous neutrality during the Spartacist Uprising.Broué, p. 274–275 The fighting continued over the following days in the areas north and east of the Alexanderplatz. The insurgents were primarily from the Republican Soldiers' Army, including the remnants of the Volksmarinedivision, who were aided by armed civilians and members of the KPD- aligned \\"Red Army Confederation\\". The conduct of the fighting, especially the indiscriminate usage of artillery by the Freikorps in heavily-populated residential areas, contributed greatly to the large death toll. === The \\"Lichtenberg police murder\\" and other hoaxes === On 8 March, the Lichtenberg Post Office, occupied by Freikorps, was conquered by insurgents. The insurgents then stormed the police headquarters, which was also taken after heavy fighting. 20 police officers were taken prisoner but then released that night, while the rest including the police chief were able to escape. The escaped officers gave inaccurate reports of supposed atrocities to government troops and the media, alleging that the insurgents ordered all officers to be executed. The story spread rapidly throughout bourgeois newspapers, and eventually spread to Vorwärts as well. Press reports gave figures from 60 to 200 officers killed. In reality, only 2 officers were killed during the fighting.Müller, p. 683Broué, p. 276 Other hoaxes reported by the media included that of \\"Spartacist-minded\\" airmen dropping bombs on civilians, as well as supposed \\"Spartacist piles\\" of civilian bodies. It was not until 13 March that the press would begin to correct the stories. > \\"All these messages were lost. It was not until 13 March that the BZ > reported that the officers had actually been released. On the same day, > 'Vossische' and 'Vorwärts', based on the statements of Mayor Ziethen, > declared 'that all the news about the mass shootings of guards and > detectives in the conquest of the Lichtenberg police headquarters have > proved untrue'. Finally, after the BZ issue of 14 March and the obituary of > the fallen, it turned out that only two police officers were dead. One of > them fell in battle and nothing could be ascertained about the death of the > other.\\" === The actions of the military === Alleged Spartacist being searched by a soldier On 9 March, using the misreported atrocities as justification, Gustav Noske decreed: > \\"The brutality and bestiality of the Spartacists who fight against us compel > me to give the following order: any person who is caught with arms in his > hands in the struggle against the government will be shot on the spot.\\" The military took the order further, ordering the shooting of anyone caught with weapons in their homes. Firearms searches commenced at random resulting in numerous summary executions, including against those uninvolved in the strike. The Freikorps indiscriminately attacked residential buildings under the claim that they had been shot at, leaving entire areas in complete ruin from artillery and aerial bombs. Residents fled to their cellars but supported the insurgents by providing food and drink. On 11 March, 29 sailors of the Volksmarinedivision were murdered with machine guns when they went to surrender and collect their discharge pay. The sailors were picked out of several hundred prisoners because they \\"looked intelligent\\". Colonel Reinhard had ordered the shooting allegedly because the prisons were overcrowded.Gumbel, p. 21Broué, p. 276–277 The conservative mayor of Lichtenberg, Oskar Ziethen, sought a truce between Noske and the insurgents to avoid further bloodshed. These advances were rejected, as Noske insisted on \\"unconditional surrender or nothing\\".Müller, p. 689 The last barricade fell on 12 March. By 13 March the fighting had almost completely ended, although the shooting order would not be lifted until 16 March. Estimates of death tolls range from 1,200 to 3,000, with small losses for government forces. Among those killed was KPD leader Leo Jogiches on 10 March, who was shot while allegedly trying to escape from the police. Alongside the deaths were thousands of arrests, with about 4,500 prisoners being crowded into the Moabit and Plötzensee prisons. Conditions were inhumane and prisoners were often mistreated or had their injuries neglected, leading to additional deaths. == Results == The military, dominated by former imperial officers, had long planned to disempower the population and revolutionary soldiers. The March Battles would see the dissolution of the Volksmarinedivision and the weakening of the Republican militias. On 6 March the Freikorps was legally integrated into the provisional Reichswehr, a move that would be important later in the Kapp–Lüttwitz Putsch. The Lichtenberg city council established a commission to determine the cost of the damage, which presented its analysis in April 1919. They estimated a loss of 1.5 million Reichsmark in the public sector and 450,000 Reichsmark in the private sector. The collaboration of the MSPD with the Freikorps did not go unnoticed, with the events contributing to their loss of influence both locally and nationally. Lichtenberg would become a stronghold for the USPD and KPD, and relations between the Communists and the Social Democrats were left permanently in tatters. The June 1920 elections would see a collapse in votes for the MSPD, with the USPD emerging in second place. The historian Ralf Hoffrogge sees the general strike and the March Battles as a turning point in the history of the November Revolution and emphasizes its supraregional significance: > \\"Unlike the January Uprising , the March strikes were a supra-regional > movement and therefore far more dangerous for the government. In the Ruhr > area, central Germany and Berlin, mass strikes called for the recognition of > workers councils and the immediate socialization of key industries. The > National Assembly in Weimar was virtually surrounded by the general strike > and unable to act. [...] But the strikes were not coordinated temporally and > spatially. While they were gaining momentum in one region, they were already > crumbling elsewhere. Although they forced the government to make verbal > concessions, they later could be individually beaten down.\\" == See also == * German Revolution of 1918–19 * Skirmish of the Berlin Schloss * Spartacist Uprising * Bavarian Soviet Republic * Bremen Soviet Republic * March Action * Ruhr Uprising * Hamburg Uprising == Further reading == * Alfred Döblin: Der deutsche Maskenball von Linke Poot.

Built by Arrow Dynamics, the ride opened in 1972 as Dexter Frebish's Electric Roller Ride, until the name was changed in 1980. At the time of its closure, it was the 2nd oldest roller coaster at the park after Serpent. == Ride experience == After leaving the station, the ride would turn right, entering a tunnel that doubled as a storage area for extra trains for the coaster. Riders would then enter the lift hill and would turn around before finally going through the first drop. The ride would then go through a banked left turn before going through a left downward helix. Riders would then turn left again before going down a slight drop and over a bunny hop. Another banked turn to the right would lead riders to another bunny hop followed by another banked drop to the right. Finally, the coaster would enter the brake run, leading riders back into the station. == Closure == At the end of the 1998 season, Excalibur was removed in order to be sent to Frontier City in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Unfortunately, somewhere between the dismantling process and the shipping to Frontier City, the ride was damaged and would end up never being built at the park. The trains were eventually sent to Six Flags Over Texas and the track for the ride was scrapped in 2005.

Set in the 1970s, the game centers around Carl Faubert, a private investigator, who arrives at a snowy town in Nord-du- Québec, only to find the place deserted with something that's lurking around. ==Gameplay== Kona includes survival and supernatural elements with buildings to explore, which contain loot (tools, light) and can serve as shelters. Some of the threats include cold (solved by setting up fire) and wolves (which will turn away in case they get a raw meat). There is a stress level, which increases by seeing upsetting scenes, dealing with tough situations, or getting into accidents. Having a higher stress level will decrease the sprint speed and add a shakier aim, but Carl can calm himself down by smoking cigarettes and drinking beers that are spread around. The navigation of the region is done by Carl’s truck in a first-person viewpoint. While driving, Carl can hold the zoomable map in his right hand in case something needs to be checked. The game has Carl's thoughts being narrated as he goes through clues to find out what has happened to the town, along with puzzles that support the story. ==Development== Kona was developed by Canadian-based company Parabole. Initial funding for the game came through a crowdfunding campaign on the website Kickstarter. The campaign was launched on August 7, 2014 with a goal of CA$40,000; it ended on September 6, 2014 with CA$44,271 raised by 1,304 people. Lead developer Alexandre Fiset later said the funding from Kickstarter would have produced a five-minute game. Later funding for the game came from the Canada Media Fund, which accounted for roughly half. It was released on Steam Early Access in March 2016, later released a year later. ==Reception== On its release, Kona was met with \\"mixed or average\\" reviews from critics on Metacritic, with an aggregate score of 73% for Microsoft Windows, 71% for PlayStation 4, and 63% for Nintendo Switch. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Kickstarter-funded video games Category:2017 video games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Adventure games Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Video games set in Canada Category:Stadia games ","title":"Kona (video game)"},{"id":"61712651","text":"The Queenstown Winter Festival is an annual event held in and around the alpine New Zealand town of Queenstown.

It took place on the same day as other district council elections in the United Kingdom. These were the first elections to the new district council, which would come into effect on 1 April 1974. The previous all-Cardiff elections to the old Cardiff City Council took place in May 1972. Future elections would take place every three years, with the next election scheduled for 6 May 1976. The 1973 election saw the Labour Party win a significant majority on the Council. ==Background== Previously a unitary authority from 1889, Cardiff's council was to become a second-tier district authority to South Glamorgan County Council from 1 April 1974. This followed local government reorganisation enacted by the Local Government Act 1972. The 1973 election was the first to the new local authority, with councillors acting in a shadow capacity until April 1974. The election to South Glamorgan County Council had taken place in April 1973, with many Cardiff councillors standing for election to this authority. Until 1973, elections to Cardiff City Council had been annual, with each of the three ward councillors standing down for election in rotation. In May 1973 all ward councillors were elected at the same election, to sit for three years. ==Wards== The wards to the new council remained the same in 1973 as the previous Cardiff City Council, but with the addition of two new wards: Lisvane, Llanedeyrn and St Mellons (1 seat); and Radyr, St Fagans, Tongwynlais (2 seats).

The character is considered to be the leader of \\"The Losers Club\\" and initiates finding and killing Pennywise the Dancing Clown after his younger brother Georgie is killed by the clown. The character was first portrayed in the 1990 miniseries by Jonathan Brandis as a child, and by Richard Thomas as an adult, then in the 1998 television series by Mamik Singh as an adult. In the 2017 adaptation and its 2019 sequel, the character was portrayed by Jaeden Martell as a child and James McAvoy as an adult. == Fictional character biography == Bill Denbrough was born in 1946 (1947 in the 1990 miniseries and January 4, 1976 in the 2017 film). He is the son of Zach and Sharon Denbrough and the older brother of Georgie Denbrough and resides in Derry, Maine. Bill has a speech impediment, due to being hit by a car at the age of three, which leads to him being outcast. In late fall of 1957 (1959 in the miniseries; 1988 in the 2017 film), Bill is suffering from a cold, and he helps construct a paper boat for his younger brother Georgie to play with outside, despite the downpour of rain. Moments later, Georgie is attacked and eaten by Pennywise the Dancing Clown in a storm drain. After this incident, in the summer of 1958 (1960 in the miniseries; 1989 in the 2017 film), Bill and his friends Eddie Kaspbrak, Richie Tozier and Stanley Uris all have encounters with Pennywise. Their shared encounters with Pennywise lead them to Beverly Marsh, Ben Hanscom and Mike Hanlon, forming \\"The Losers Club.” Along the way, the group members all have more individual encounters with Pennywise and local bully Henry Bowers—who later falls under the influence of Pennywise—until they decide to head to where they believe Pennywise to be hiding, on Neibolt Street, and believe they have killed the clown. However, they make an oath that, if Pennywise is not in fact dead, they will all return to Derry to defeat him. In his adult life, Bill has become a successful writer and married an actress, Audra Phillips. Bill has controlled his stutter and, due to the nature of It, cannot remember Derry, Georgie, or The Losers Club. After Pennywise kills a gay man named Adrian Mellon, Bill gets a phone call from Mike Hanlon, who has remained in Derry, asking him to come back and help kill Pennywise once and for all. Each member of The Losers Club returns to Derry except for Stanley, who commits suicide due to not being able to face his fears again. The group meets in a Chinese Restaurant where the members catch up until they realize Stanley is missing and are confronted by It. Eventually, after each member has respective encounters with Pennywise, the group returns to Neibolt Street and performs the Ritual of Chud to reveal Pennywise's true form and be able to kill It. However, Pennywise has already taken Bill's wife Audra and put her under the influence of It's deadlights, causing her to fall into a state of catatonia. Even after defeating Pennywise, Audra remains in a catatonic state until Bill takes her on a bicycle ride, causing her to come out of her paralysis. == Adaptations == === 1990 miniseries === Bill was portrayed by Jonathan Brandis as a child and Richard Thomas as an adult in the 1990 miniseries directed by Tommy Lee Wallace. This interpretation remains faithful to the novel version of the character with little to no notable differences. === Woh === Bill was portrayed by Mamik Singh as an adult (named \\"Rahul\\") in the 1998 television series directed by Glen Baretto and Ankush Mohla. This series remains similar to the 1990 miniseries, however, in this iteration, Georgie stays alive but mentally unstable due to his encounter with Pennywise. === Cary Fukunaga's failed adaptation === In Cary Joji Fukunaga's adaptation of the novel, Bill was to be called \\"Will\\" Denbrough, rather than Bill. When Fukunaga left the project and Andy Muschietti came aboard to produce and direct, Martell was cast. === 2017 and 2019 films === Bill was portrayed again by Jaeden Martell as a child and James McAvoy as an adult in the 2017 remake and its 2019 sequel. In this interpretation, the sequel reveals that he pretended to be sick the day Georgie was killed, resulting in his guilt over his brother's death. The first movie depicts Bill deluding himself that Georgie is still alive to the point of causing the Losers Club to scatter following their first encounter with Pennywise at the Neibolt House. This interpretation also has Pennywise recognising Bill as a threat, attempting to barter the other Losers into sacrificing Bill to survive. The sequel has a tongue-in-cheek reference to Stephen King's main criticism, wherein he rarely has satisfying endings to his novels. This is ironic considering many fans and critics's main criticism with the movie was that the ending was disappointing. The sequel also features Bill coming across a young boy at the drain where Georgie was killed, and learns that the boy will become Pennywise's next victim. This leads Bill to a local carnival where he follows the boy through a house of mirrors, where Pennywise murders him right in front of Bill. The young boy had also been seen earlier in the film at the Chinese restaurant as a fan of Richie, whom Richie believes is another version of Pennywise. Audra's role in the story is removed with Pennywise instead tormenting Bill through both his guilt and being forced to watch It kill another child in front of him. Bill overcomes his personal demons while performing the Ritual of Chud. The film also deviates from the novel and the miniseries by ending with Bill and the remaining Losers retaining their memories. === Differences from novel === Neither adaptation features Bill and the rest of the Losers meeting with Maturin the Turtle – a god-like figure in the novel who is the antithesis to Pennywise. Despite not featuring Maturin, It Chapter Two does feature the Ritual of Chud as a key plot device in the film's narrative. Multiple references are still made throughout It: Chapter One as well, such as the Loser's Club at the quarry stating to have seen a turtle, and Bill holding a Lego turtle in Georgie's bedroom, as well as a clay turtle being seen in a classroom in It Chapter Two. The film series also deviates from the source material by not including the Loser's Club members losing their virginity to Beverly Marsh in the sewers after defeating Pennywise for the first time. This scene was reportedly to be featured in Fukunaga's original screenplay, but was removed by Muschietti during his rewrites once he came aboard the project. == Themes of PTSD and Survivor's guilt == Bill's deceased brother Georgie being used by Pennywise to taunt Bill in It In It: Chapter Two, the element of post traumatic stress disorder is hinted at once the characters get the phone call from Mike Hanlon asking them to return to Derry. Bill is shown to have symptoms of PTSD and Survivor's guilt throughout the first film as well, refusing to believe that Georgie could be dead and blaming himself for not supervising Georgie. While the rest of The Loser's Club is shown to struggle with returning to Derry and are consumed with grief and fear once they receive the call from Mike, Bill is shown to have the hardest time coping with his Survivor's guilt. Bill's struggles lead to his failed attempts to save another young boy from suffering the same fate as Georgie, only to be murdered by Pennywise right in front of him. Pennywise often taunts Bill for his failure to save Georgie throughout the film as well, including a scene which takes place during the events of the first film in which Bill returns to the drain where Georgie was killed and demands answers from Pennywise on why he took Georgie. The clown only retorts with \\"Because You Weren't There\\", in an attempt to further Bill's Survivor's guilt. == Reception == Denbrough's development throughout the novel and adaptations reflects the overall theme of loss of innocence. Bill's development into a maturing adult due to the loss of his brother, Georgie, and the threat of Pennywise was widely acclaimed by fans and critics. The portrayals of the character by Brandis, Martell and McAvoy were all highly praised as well for embodying the spirit of the character. Martell's portrayal in particular was noted for the more adult themes explored in the 2017 adaptation and for Martell's commitment to perfecting the character's stutter. While Brandis's portrayal of Denbrough in the 1990 miniseries was acclaimed, Thomas' portrayal of the adult Bill received mixed reactions from fans and critics. The character is referenced in other Stephen King novels: 11/22/63 and Bag of Bones. In Bag of Bones, the character of Johanna is seen to be a fan of Denbrough's novels and considers him one of her favorite contemporary authors. Bill is briefly mentioned again in 11/22/63, and fellow members of the Loser's Club, Beverly Marsh and Richie Tozier make physical appearances. == References == Category:It (novel) Category:Stephen King characters Category:Male characters in literature Category:Literary characters introduced in 1986 Category:Fictional stutterers Category:Male horror film characters Category:Fictional writers Category:Horror television characters Category:Fictional characters from Maine Category:Fictional characters with post-traumatic stress disorder ","title":"Bill Denbrough"},{"id":"61712691","text":"Digital eMation, Inc.

EBQ is basically a refinement of the economic order quantity (EOQ) model to take into account circumstances in which the goods are produced in batches. The goal of calculating EBQ is that the product is produced in the required quantity and required quality at the lowest cost. The EOQ model was developed by Ford W. Harris in 1913, but R. H. Wilson, a consultant who applied it extensively, and K. Andler are given credit for their in-depth analysis. Aggterleky described the optimal planning planes and the meaning of under and over planning, and the influence of the reduction of total cost. Wiendahl used Harris and Andler’s equation for the determination of the optimal quantity. Härdler took into account the costs of storage and delivery in determining the optimal batch quantity (EBQ). Muller and Piasecki asserted that inventory management is explained only with the basics of an optimal quantity calculation. == Background == There are basically two options of planning the batch quantity: planning a large batch of a product in long intervals, and planning a small batch of a product in short intervals. The advantages of planning a large batch of product are that the price of ordering a large batch, administrative costs, costs of tests and shipping are lower, and there is a lower risk of interruption of production because of the large stock. The disadvantages of planning a large batch are that there is higher tied-up capital, and storage costs of product inventory are also higher. The advantages of planning a small batch of product are that there is less tied-up capital, storage costs of product inventory are low, and there is a higher flexibility if quantities change at suppliers and buyers. The disadvantages of planning a small batch are that there will be costs of frequent ordering, and a high risk of interruption of production because of a small product inventory. Somewhere between the large and small batch quantity is the optimal batch quantity, i.e. the quantity in which the cost per product unit is the lowest. == Variables and assumptions == Cost per piece v/s Batch size Chart In the EOQ model, it is assumed that the orders are received all at once. However in the EBQ model, this assumption is relaxed. There are two types of costs: those which increase with the batch size such as working capital investment in materials and labor, cost of handling and storing materials, insurance and tax charges, interest on capital investment, etc., and those which decrease with the batch size such as cost (per unit) of setting up machines, cost of preparing paper work that enters and controls the production of the order, etc. These costs, i.e., (a) and (b) are plotted and added graphically (figure). The figure graphs the holding cost and ordering cost per year equations. The third line is the addition of these two equations, which generates the total inventory cost per year. The lowest (minimum) part of the total cost curve will give the economic batch quantity as illustrated in the next section. This graph should give a better understanding of the derivation of the optimal ordering quantity equation, i.e., the EBQ equation. Thus, variables Q, R, S, C, I can be defined, which stand for economic batch quantity, annual requirements, preparation and set-up cost each time a new batch is started, constant cost per piece (material, direct labor and overheads), inventory carrying charge rate per year, respectively. Some assumptions have been made for calculating economic batch quantity. They are: * Demand is known and constant within a certain period of time * Unit cost of the inventory item is constant * Production time is known and constant * Setup cost is constant and does not change == Calculations == If C_O is the cost of setting up a batch, D is the annual demand, d is the daily rate at which inventory is demanded, C_C is the inventory holding cost per unit per annum, and p is the rate of production per annum, the total cost function (TC) is calculated as follows: \\\\text{Maximum Inventory Level}=Q-\\\\frac{Q}{p}=Q(1-\\\\frac{d}{p}) \\\\text{Average Inventory}=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\bigg[Q(1-\\\\frac{d}{p})\\\\bigg]=\\\\frac{Q}{2}\\\\bigg(1-\\\\frac{d}{p}\\\\bigg) \\\\text{Total carrying cost}=\\\\frac{C_CQ}{2}\\\\bigg(1-\\\\frac{d}{p}\\\\bigg) In this case the ordering cost, C_O is often the setup cost for production. \\\\therefore \\\\text{Total cost TC} = \\\\bigg(\\\\frac{C_O D}{Q}\\\\bigg) + \\\\bigg[\\\\frac{C_C Q}{2}(1-\\\\frac{d}{p})\\\\bigg] The EBQ is calculated as the point where the total cost is minimum as follows: \\\\text{For TC to be minimum,}{dT \\\\over dQ}=0. \\\\therefore Q = \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{ 2 \\\\cdot C_O \\\\cdot D }{ C_C \\\\bigg(1-\\\\frac{d}{p}\\\\bigg) } } Where C_O is the cost of setting up a batch, D is the annual demand, d is the daily rate at which inventory is demanded, C_C is the inventory holding cost per unit per annum, and p is the rate of production per annum. It is evident from this equation that the economic batch quantity increases as the annual requirements or the preparation and setup costs increase that is, they are (not directly) proportional to each other. Similarly, it is also clear that the economic batch quantity decreases as the cost per piece and inventory carrying rate increase. === Example === Set-up cost = $ 20 per set-up, Annual requirements = 1000, Inventory carrying cost = 10% of value/year, Cost per part = $ 2 EBQ=\\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{ 2\\\\times1000\\\\times20 }{2\\\\times0.1} }=447 \\\\text{ parts} Therefore the number of batches to be made for manufacturing the parts are 1000/447 = 2.24. Nearest, 2 batches can be made and therefore the modified EBQ = 1000/2 = 500 parts. == See also == Economic Order Quantity Operations Management Inventory Control == References == Category:Inventory optimization ","title":"Economic batch quantity"},{"id":"61712737","text":"Camellia chinmeii is an endemic species of small evergreen tree.
